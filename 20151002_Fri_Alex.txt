[00:00:05.512 --> 00:00:06.813]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.813 --> 00:00:08.575]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:10.337]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.337 --> 00:00:11.919]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.480]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.665]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:22.350]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.934]  You know why Homeland Security says that veterans are the number one enemy?
[00:00:26.374 --> 00:00:37.864]  The number one terror threat, because every time there's a mass shooting, every time there's criminal activity going on and a vet is nearby, they either take out who's doing it or die trying.
[00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:46.572]  And that's why they want to single out vets in this country, is because they're afraid of empowered individuals who will take action and aren't cowards.
[00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:52.578]  And that's all you need to know about the people running this government, is they fund Al-Qaeda, they criticize Russia for bombing Al-Qaeda,
[00:00:54.332 --> 00:01:06.537]  And they would demonize veterans when statistically veterans commit some of the lowest levels of crime out there after old women.
[00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:08.798]  And they know it.
[00:01:08.798 --> 00:01:15.881]  But the difference is a lot of vets out there aren't going to be pushed around by a bunch of scum in this government.
[00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:19.682]  That's how I opened the show today because I was just looking at the story on NBC News.
[00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:23.704]  Oregon shooting heroic veteran Chris Mintz was shot seven times.
[00:01:25.202 --> 00:01:32.283]  Trying to save people as they were being killed by this cowardly scumbag who wanted attention and hated Christians.
[00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:34.924]  Another big Obama supporter.
[00:01:34.924 --> 00:01:39.285]  And they advertised a new fetish going into victim disarmament zones and shooting people.
[00:01:39.285 --> 00:01:41.925]  And so it happens again.
[00:01:41.925 --> 00:01:47.486]  A month or so ago it was a racially motivated crazy black guy.
[00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:51.187]  A few months before that it was a racially motivated crazy white guy.
[00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.091]  And now there's some racially Christian motivated mixed race guy.
[00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.535]  What they all got in common is they're crazy scum.
[00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:06.661]  And people have a right to defend themselves against trash like this.
[00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.768]  That's what it comes down to in the final equation.
[00:02:09.768 --> 00:02:15.030]  Another armed Air Force vet was prevented from stopping Oregon gunmen.
[00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.252]  They were at the military center on the edge of the campus and were blocked from getting in there and were locked down by the police.
[00:02:22.252 --> 00:02:24.453]  It's a total death trap.
[00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:28.454]  That's what these mass execution centers are.
[00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:35.877]  When you put your children in it, when you put your money in them, you support these dumb universities that are giving you worthless degrees eight times out of ten.
[00:02:37.773 --> 00:02:39.354]  Yeah, about 20% of the degrees are worse.
[00:02:39.354 --> 00:02:48.821]  Something engineering, science, medical, business, but not all the rest of the degrees.
[00:02:48.821 --> 00:03:05.012]  You put your money in these institutions without reforming them, you allow them to take over the culture and allow them to continue their disgusting, anti-human, anti-family, anti-male, anti-female, anti-child, anti-life agenda.
[00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:07.177]  You know, it hit me this morning.
[00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:09.058]  I woke up at about 6 a.m.
[00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:10.799]  with a pounding headache, and I'll just be honest.
[00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:11.920]  I'm not going to be a hypocrite here.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.621]  I'm not going to put on airs or lie.
[00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:20.586]  I went out to see Billy Idol last night, and then I guess the crew was down there, a nearby establishment.
[00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:21.727]  I heard I was there.
[00:03:21.727 --> 00:03:32.995]  Joe Biggs, Joe Jennings, Darren McBreen, Marcus Morales, and I have not had a lot to drink like that since I was in college, and they bought me a bunch of shots of, uh, what was it?
[00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:37.806]  JÃ¤germeister.
[00:03:37.806 --> 00:03:42.549]  And I feel like my brain has been taken out with a melon baller right now.
[00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.191]  But I think you're going to have a good broadcast today.
[00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:48.692]  But back to what I was getting to.
[00:03:48.692 --> 00:03:51.033]  See, I have to tell a story in the context.
[00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:51.994]  I wasn't going to tell that story.
[00:03:51.994 --> 00:03:52.614]  It was just part of it.
[00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:53.475]  I went back to 6 a.m.
[00:03:53.475 --> 00:03:57.237]  this morning waking up.
[00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.617]  The good news is I was not driving.
[00:03:58.617 --> 00:03:59.438]  I'm very proud of myself.
[00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:03.567]  Uber's a wonderful thing, even though it's a horrible thing.
[00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:05.368]  Uber's the worst of times, the best of times.
[00:04:05.368 --> 00:04:21.660]  It's a horrible Democrat-run monopoly where they keep regulations on the cab drivers on purpose so that they can't compete and don't let anybody else in business but only Rahm Emanuel's brother so they can make billions while raking it all in worldwide in liberal cities, running game on their moron constituents, but anyway, side issue.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.221]  See, that's the key to regulations.
[00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:27.464]  They're always applied selectively by socialists, but I digress.
[00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.092]  It just hit me how uncool it is to be anti-human.
[00:04:33.092 --> 00:04:38.256]  With all the epic things humanity's done, how amazing we are, with how fun humanity is.
[00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:41.078]  These people just are not fans of humanity.
[00:04:41.078 --> 00:04:46.142]  And so they need to... Well, you know what they need to do, don't you?
[00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:48.683]  And if they didn't have us to feed on, that's what they'd do.
[00:04:48.683 --> 00:04:50.885]  They'd crawl in their holes and they'd die.
[00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:57.830]  You human-hating, weak, chicken-necked collections of cowards that want to urinate on the corpses of humanity.
[00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:58.551]  I got a better idea.
[00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:01.858]  Do you know what it means to be an American?
[00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:03.339]  It's more than a flag.
[00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:06.200]  It's more than knowing the star-spangled banner.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.801]  It's knowing the Constitution.
[00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:10.882]  It's understanding those rights and fighting for them.
[00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:17.365]  Our country's falling apart because people have forgotten to fight, to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing.
[00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:22.829]  It's putting your life on the line to protect your country from enemies both foreign and domestic.
[00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:31.016]  The Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse or rest on inference.
[00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:36.020]  So the Tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:41.745]  I'm Joe Biggs with Infowars.com, and I believe our flag is more than cloth and ink.
[00:05:41.745 --> 00:05:44.827]  It is a symbol that stands for liberty and freedom.
[00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:49.971]  It is a history of our nation, and it's marked by the blood of those who died defending it.
[00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:51.712]  So join me in this Infowar.
[00:05:51.712 --> 00:05:56.176]  Turn off your TV, put your Cheetos down, get off your butt and join the resistance.
[00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.892]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.892 --> 00:06:11.138]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:16.562]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[00:06:16.562 --> 00:06:19.084]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[00:06:19.084 --> 00:06:21.185]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[00:06:29.324 --> 00:06:30.445]  Brain Force is here.
[00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:32.646]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[00:06:32.646 --> 00:06:37.629]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of Brain Force.
[00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:40.931]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:44.413]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:06:44.413 --> 00:06:46.154]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:48.495]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:06:48.495 --> 00:06:50.497]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:06:50.497 --> 00:06:57.261]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:06:57.261 --> 00:07:08.049]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:16.154]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:16.454 --> 00:07:21.316]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:21.316 --> 00:07:28.119]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:07:28.119 --> 00:07:35.281]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:42.144]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:42.304 --> 00:07:46.787]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:46.787 --> 00:07:50.189]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:56.473]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:07:56.473 --> 00:08:00.155]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:00.155 --> 00:08:05.178]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:16.278]  From the front lines of the information war, we come to you from Old Texas.
[00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:18.058]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:18.058 --> 00:08:24.200]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday, October 2nd, Global Transmission.
[00:08:37.192 --> 00:08:51.396]  I wonder what he's talking about.
[00:08:51.396 --> 00:08:56.577]  We're the Rebel, yeah!
[00:08:56.577 --> 00:09:03.099]  Monday through Friday, from 11am to 2pm Central Standard Time, we are live.
[00:09:09.488 --> 00:09:14.491]  Then we return, 7 o'clock Central, with InfoWars Nightly News.
[00:09:14.491 --> 00:09:18.693]  And yes... She doesn't like slavery?
[00:09:18.693 --> 00:09:21.335]  What's wrong with her?
[00:09:21.335 --> 00:09:25.057]  Then I'll be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:09:25.057 --> 00:09:26.338]  Central Standard Time.
[00:09:26.338 --> 00:09:27.399]  That song is poetry.
[00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:29.340]  It says a lot, for folks that don't know.
[00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:34.323]  It has three layers to it.
[00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:36.124]  I need you here by me.
[00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.031]  All right, Billy Idol bringing us in.
[00:09:40.031 --> 00:09:44.753]  Put on a great show last night, by the way.
[00:09:44.753 --> 00:09:46.833]  Hey, look at this little doozy story.
[00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:53.396]  HHS, Health and Human Services, boosting nation's stockpile of burn treatments in case of nuclear attack.
[00:09:53.396 --> 00:10:08.102]  Yeah, I'd say rolling in cruise missiles and truck-launched missiles and frogs, tactical nuclear weapons up against the Russian border, you might want to stock up on your burn treatment supplies doing that.
[00:10:10.777 --> 00:10:18.899]  Iraq would welcome Russian strikes against Islamic State, says their president.
[00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:23.440]  Former security guard at Oregon College, where 10 were killed.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.501]  Lockdown procedures were a death trap.
[00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:29.202]  Well, that's what they're designed to do.
[00:10:29.202 --> 00:10:32.542]  Then they advertise this is where you go to kill people.
[00:10:32.542 --> 00:10:33.563]  Selective outrage.
[00:10:33.563 --> 00:10:38.244]  Obama hasn't said a single word about routine mass shootings in Chicago.
[00:10:39.565 --> 00:10:40.766]  Two of which happened yesterday.
[00:10:40.766 --> 00:10:45.351]  And that brings me, of course, to our top story today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:45.351 --> 00:10:55.622]  It's not that foreign troops from China, Iran, and Russia are piling into Syria to fight the United States of America and Europe bankrolling Al Qaeda.
[00:10:56.621 --> 00:10:57.862]  No, that's not our top story.
[00:10:57.862 --> 00:11:18.136]  It's not our top story that was in the Associated Press, Reuters, the New York Times, just that I saw yesterday, with the State Department criticizing Russia, and the Pentagon criticizing Russia, and the Secretary of Defense criticizing Russia for bombing al-Qaeda.
[00:11:20.703 --> 00:11:22.544]  Instead of ISIS.
[00:11:22.544 --> 00:11:27.027]  I actually read that in headlines and saw that on the news with a straight face.
[00:11:27.027 --> 00:11:28.808]  They are testing you.
[00:11:28.808 --> 00:11:30.569]  They know the words coming out.
[00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:32.350]  It's going to come out in the 28 pages.
[00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:37.032]  The criminal elements of our government with Saudi Arabia ran 9-11.
[00:11:37.032 --> 00:11:41.375]  And so they're just, I guess they'll come out and announce, yeah, we did it because we're patriots.
[00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:46.318]  And if you don't support the government blowing up the World Trade Centers and Building 7, you're not a patriot.
[00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:51.852]  If you don't support blowing up the World Trade Centers, I get it, you're a Russian spy.
[00:11:51.852 --> 00:11:53.833]  Yeah, that'd be a good headline.
[00:11:53.833 --> 00:11:55.774]  And I'm not even joking anymore.
[00:11:55.774 --> 00:12:03.238]  They're mainlining that our government runs Al-Qaeda right now, thinking the public's so dumb they'll go, big deal!
[00:12:03.238 --> 00:12:04.138]  What, you're not a patriot?
[00:12:04.138 --> 00:12:04.999]  You don't support Al-Qaeda?
[00:12:09.028 --> 00:12:12.190]  This is the level of satire we've reached.
[00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:17.613]  Because Karl Rove, but also Nancy Pelosi, they all make similar statements, said they control reality.
[00:12:17.613 --> 00:12:20.354]  No you don't, you dumb witch!
[00:12:20.354 --> 00:12:27.598]  You may control giving the orders to get Botox every week, where you look like a rubber face, a rubber chicken.
[00:12:27.598 --> 00:12:30.220]  With Secretary of State Kerry, you both look like the same person.
[00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.471]  But you don't control reality, you dumb witch!
[00:12:34.471 --> 00:12:38.212]  You're not going to live forever, you're not a god, you're a pile of you-know-what.
[00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:41.994]  A steaming pile of horse manure.
[00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:49.576]  But that's not even kind, because horse manure has nutrients for the soil and the insects and the grass in it.
[00:12:49.576 --> 00:12:52.277]  I mean, we just have to hate these people.
[00:12:52.277 --> 00:12:56.799]  We just have to fully throw them up like poison in our stomach.
[00:12:56.799 --> 00:12:58.019]  We have to get them out of us.
[00:12:58.019 --> 00:12:59.340]  They are anathema.
[00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:07.271]  And evil always tends to take over historically during cycles because good people just are blind.
[00:13:07.271 --> 00:13:08.191]  We are blind.
[00:13:08.191 --> 00:13:21.679]  We just cannot get our minds around the dishonor, the cowardliness, the scumminess, the weakness, the filth of wanting to inject billions of people with vaccines to cripple their minds and give them cancer at a young age.
[00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:26.802]  The globalists get off on that and so we can't even get our minds around it because it's
[00:13:27.262 --> 00:13:33.264]  A thousand, trillion, trillion miles away from where we are.
[00:13:33.264 --> 00:13:44.388]  These people have crawled out of the pit of hell to feed on our children and sell their body parts and to splice every creation God's made together in abominations.
[00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:48.030]  See, for the globalists, the journey is the destination.
[00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.371]  Dominating us, poisoning us, hurting us.
[00:13:52.318 --> 00:13:54.079]  Destabilizing us.
[00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:55.480]  Is there God?
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:02.964]  And the minute, see, once the illusion breaks, once the trance breaks, we'll just be like, whoa, whoa, I was in a trance.
[00:14:02.964 --> 00:14:03.985]  Why'd I ever put up with this?
[00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:05.906]  And you see the trance is falling.
[00:14:05.906 --> 00:14:09.848]  When they have one failure, and I've always explained this to everyone, like they've had taken our guns.
[00:14:09.848 --> 00:14:12.069]  I said this five years ago.
[00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:18.753]  When they have one failure on a major initiative, every domino starts falling.
[00:14:20.885 --> 00:14:28.251]  And these churches are there to tell you that it's the end of the world, and that there's nothing we can do, and we have to give in, because it's all over.
[00:14:28.251 --> 00:14:29.873]  Folks, it's free will.
[00:14:29.873 --> 00:14:31.794]  We have free will.
[00:14:31.794 --> 00:14:33.596]  Yes, the world will end.
[00:14:33.596 --> 00:14:35.538]  Yes, the Antichrist will come to power.
[00:14:35.538 --> 00:14:40.322]  Yes, all this will happen, if we let it happen.
[00:14:40.322 --> 00:14:42.464]  People say, oh, it's all in God's plan.
[00:14:42.464 --> 00:14:43.645]  We are God's plan.
[00:14:45.871 --> 00:14:58.536]  And yes, undoubtedly to test humanity, the technology, the evil, will get to a point, whether it's five years from now or a hundred years from now, where it will overwhelm humanity to such a core level that God will step in.
[00:14:58.536 --> 00:15:01.258]  But God's already stepping in through you.
[00:15:01.258 --> 00:15:02.618]  Who do you think you are?
[00:15:02.618 --> 00:15:04.419]  Who do you think I am?
[00:15:04.419 --> 00:15:06.680]  We are manifestations of God's will on this planet.
[00:15:08.086 --> 00:15:22.098]  And the sooner we start realizing that and realize why the enemy hates us and desperately poisons us because we're like 5,000 foot shining platinum giants to the New World Order.
[00:15:22.098 --> 00:15:24.860]  Do you understand that?
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:30.525]  We're fire-breathing Godzillas to them.
[00:15:32.264 --> 00:15:33.745]  They hate us, folks.
[00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:34.566]  They hate you.
[00:15:34.566 --> 00:15:35.587]  They hate your children.
[00:15:35.587 --> 00:15:36.508]  They hate your wife.
[00:15:36.508 --> 00:15:37.649]  They hate your husband.
[00:15:37.649 --> 00:15:39.471]  They hate corn.
[00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:40.572]  They hate wheat.
[00:15:40.572 --> 00:15:41.814]  They hate watermelons.
[00:15:41.814 --> 00:15:42.935]  They hate sunlight.
[00:15:42.935 --> 00:15:44.156]  They hate the sky.
[00:15:44.156 --> 00:15:49.461]  Why do you think the EPA came out and attacked sunlight two days ago and said it's bad?
[00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:54.166]  Why do you think Cass Sunstein wants to make a law where you can't say sunlight's good for you?
[00:15:58.112 --> 00:16:03.298]  Every doctor until 20 years ago said, your kid's sick, you're sick, get out and get some sunlight.
[00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:07.102]  Yeah, sunlight will kill you, but not having it will kill you quicker.
[00:16:07.102 --> 00:16:09.084]  Do you understand that?
[00:16:09.084 --> 00:16:11.247]  The sun will set you free, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:11.247 --> 00:16:12.148]  That's why they hate it.
[00:16:12.148 --> 00:16:14.691]  These people are literally vampires.
[00:16:16.001 --> 00:16:26.684]  And by literally, the legends of vampires are only a wives tale around the fire to describe what the elite are to kids that aren't that complex to understand.
[00:16:26.684 --> 00:16:30.845]  You stay away from the castle and you don't get near the castle at night.
[00:16:30.845 --> 00:16:40.248]  And you don't fish down there in those ponds by the castle because there are people that will grab you and will put you in a dungeon and will drink your blood.
[00:16:40.248 --> 00:16:41.568]  Now, do those people live forever?
[00:16:41.568 --> 00:16:45.389]  No, but they will grab you and they will torture you and they will drink your blood.
[00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:49.130]  They are vampires.
[00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:50.751]  And that's what we're facing, folks.
[00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:59.636]  And until we realize that these are people that hate the sun, these are people that hate life, these people are from hell.
[00:16:59.636 --> 00:17:01.237]  They're from another dimension.
[00:17:01.237 --> 00:17:02.698]  They don't like us.
[00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:05.079]  And it's time to stop liking them.
[00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.900]  Do you understand that?
[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.882]  You do not admit they're evil.
[00:17:08.882 --> 00:17:10.602]  You do not admit they're out to get you.
[00:17:10.602 --> 00:17:11.443]  They win.
[00:17:11.443 --> 00:17:12.624]  You're under a trance.
[00:17:12.624 --> 00:17:13.444]  You're blind.
[00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:15.205]  You must break your trance.
[00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:16.086]  You must admit it.
[00:17:16.946 --> 00:17:19.848]  And only then can you transcend these people.
[00:17:19.848 --> 00:17:21.588]  That's the moment you're free.
[00:17:21.588 --> 00:17:23.049]  It's the moment you put the glasses on.
[00:17:23.049 --> 00:17:27.811]  That's why I love Roddy Piper, rest his soul, a listener and a great patriot.
[00:17:27.811 --> 00:17:39.037]  Such an allegorical key scene of coming out of Plato's cave, when he says to his good friend, the only friend he's got, his whole family's died from what the globalists are putting the food in the water.
[00:17:39.037 --> 00:17:41.618]  The society's crumbling, they're telling him it's great.
[00:17:41.618 --> 00:17:45.300]  He says, man, it all makes sense now, just put these glasses on or start eating concrete.
[00:17:46.613 --> 00:17:52.361]  Because I love you enough that I'm going to get in a fight with you, and we're going to hurt each other real bad, but it doesn't matter.
[00:17:52.361 --> 00:17:53.322]  You're going to put these on.
[00:17:54.209 --> 00:17:57.271]  And then once you put these glasses on, you're going to realize how stupid it is.
[00:17:57.271 --> 00:17:59.452]  You think I want to fight with cops?
[00:17:59.452 --> 00:18:01.273]  You think I want to fight with black people?
[00:18:01.273 --> 00:18:02.754]  You think I want to fight with Mexicans?
[00:18:02.754 --> 00:18:05.476]  You think I want to fight with Midwestern white people?
[00:18:05.476 --> 00:18:07.577]  You think I want to fight with Arabs or Muslims?
[00:18:07.577 --> 00:18:09.038]  You think I want to fight with Christians?
[00:18:09.038 --> 00:18:10.299]  You think I want to... No!
[00:18:10.299 --> 00:18:12.580]  I want to empower and see people free.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:19.204]  And the minute you put the glasses on, it's a decision, and really look at what we're facing, it'll all be a joke.
[00:18:19.204 --> 00:18:21.266]  It won't matter that we just beat the hell out of each other.
[00:18:22.344 --> 00:18:30.507]  It won't matter all the stupid stuff they put between us once we understand it was all done to us on purpose to keep us blind from the truth.
[00:18:30.507 --> 00:18:32.968]  You can break that trance just like that.
[00:18:32.968 --> 00:18:34.929]  The minute you want to, you can be free.
[00:18:34.929 --> 00:18:38.390]  The second you decide, it's all about free will.
[00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:41.451]  But let me warn you about something.
[00:18:41.451 --> 00:18:44.852]  And I'm not copying the Matrix, it's an allegory, it's always been true.
[00:18:44.852 --> 00:18:46.733]  All I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
[00:18:47.737 --> 00:18:52.101]  Because once you realize the true horror of this, it's gonna change your world forever.
[00:18:52.101 --> 00:19:00.547]  And you're not gonna be able to just sit there calmly anymore and go through your bumbling life, worried about fantasy football, or acting tough to your buddies.
[00:19:00.547 --> 00:19:06.832]  Because when you hit the rock bottom of this situation, you're gonna get the million mile view of the whole stinkin' thing.
[00:19:06.832 --> 00:19:10.115]  And there's no coming back from that rabbit hole.
[00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:11.736]  But here's the secret.
[00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:12.997]  You're already in the rabbit hole.
[00:19:12.997 --> 00:19:15.039]  The secret is...
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.443]  This is all about the choice you're going to make.
[00:19:20.443 --> 00:19:22.524]  You want to sign on to funding Al-Qaeda?
[00:19:22.524 --> 00:19:26.127]  You want to sign on to babies having their organs harvested?
[00:19:26.127 --> 00:19:28.709]  You want to sign on to mutating God's creation?
[00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:30.931]  You want to sign on to this?
[00:19:30.931 --> 00:19:31.892]  Because you're scared of it?
[00:19:31.892 --> 00:19:33.553]  You think maybe you cozy up to it?
[00:19:33.553 --> 00:19:35.815]  And the Stockholm Syndrome is going to take care of you?
[00:19:35.815 --> 00:19:37.536]  It's going to tear you apart.
[00:19:37.536 --> 00:19:39.658]  It's going to suck you dry.
[00:19:39.658 --> 00:19:40.558]  You will die.
[00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:42.880]  You will go through pain either way.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.401]  But doing it in an honorable way is
[00:19:45.819 --> 00:19:46.860]  Heavenly.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:48.963]  It's Valhalla.
[00:19:48.963 --> 00:19:54.169]  Compared to submitting to these vampires and letting them slow bleed us.
[00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:57.193]  We join them on the field of combat.
[00:19:57.193 --> 00:19:59.796]  We politically and spiritually hack them to pieces.
[00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:03.941]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega 3s is a good idea.
[00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:08.223]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in Omega-3s?
[00:20:08.223 --> 00:20:15.586]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% Omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[00:20:15.586 --> 00:20:20.829]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[00:20:20.829 --> 00:20:29.533]  If you want to boost your Omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.

[00:20:32.694 --> 00:20:32.934]  I think so.

[00:24:10.322 --> 00:24:12.843]  I'll be cleaning up the house.
[00:24:12.843 --> 00:24:15.925]  Sometimes digging through my desk.
[00:24:15.925 --> 00:24:20.328]  Multiple desks at my house and here at the office.
[00:24:20.328 --> 00:24:24.930]  And I'll just come across these notebooks.
[00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:29.753]  And they're just full of things that are beautiful and wonderful about the world.
[00:24:29.753 --> 00:24:30.774]  I always intend
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:48.905]  To do a radio show or a TV show or a documentary or maybe a book about the fabulous universe we live in and just how amazing humans are, but also animals and just creation and how fabulous everything is.
[00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:51.145]  I mean, I don't want folks to think I'm negative.
[00:24:51.145 --> 00:24:54.126]  I mean, you are fabulous.
[00:24:54.126 --> 00:24:58.887]  Even in your stunted, brain-damaged form that the globalists have put us in, you are amazing.
[00:24:58.887 --> 00:25:00.508]  And I mean, I'm not just saying that.
[00:25:01.854 --> 00:25:20.847]  The act of being able to stand up, the act of being able to walk, the act of being able to see the universe around you and then commune with it and see the beauty in it is the transcendence to the fifth dimension, into God's realm.
[00:25:20.847 --> 00:25:26.050]  The love of creation, the love of the Creator.
[00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.012]  And I didn't read any of this in a book, it's written on my heart.
[00:25:28.012 --> 00:25:29.793]  It's written on my mind.
[00:25:31.533 --> 00:25:46.544]  And I follow my instinctive spiritual understanding of things with the assurance of a sleepwalker.
[00:25:46.544 --> 00:25:48.005]  And I see people in bondage.
[00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:54.049]  I see men who are so insecure and feel so inadequate.
[00:25:54.049 --> 00:25:55.831]  And I just want to see them be free.
[00:25:55.831 --> 00:25:57.212]  They've had their manhood stolen from them.
[00:25:57.212 --> 00:25:57.812]  I've seen women
[00:25:59.278 --> 00:26:11.981]  Incredibly powerful women just everywhere with all their energy and all their creativity and all their magic that God gave them, having no idea that they've been set against men and against that incredible communion that God gave men and women.
[00:26:11.981 --> 00:26:14.461]  I mean, how dare the government?
[00:26:14.461 --> 00:26:16.742]  How dare the establishment church?
[00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:19.202]  How dare the social engineers?
[00:26:19.202 --> 00:26:27.004]  How dare the twisted, failed, ugly feminists get in the middle of that magical event?
[00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.992]  That goes back with all of our ancestors and the hell they went through together.
[00:26:32.992 --> 00:26:41.077]  Conquering the earth, conquering the animals, conquering the big bears, the big cats, the wolves.
[00:26:41.077 --> 00:26:46.240]  We carry that incredible struggle together.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:57.906]  The kinship we have with each other as humans, the deep kinship, whether you're black or white, Hispanic, old, young, the incredible kinship of being human together, that shared experience.
[00:27:00.253 --> 00:27:02.174]  The enemy hates it.
[00:27:02.174 --> 00:27:05.176]  Because the enemy doesn't have honor or love.
[00:27:05.176 --> 00:27:06.077]  Joe Biggs is coming in.
[00:27:06.077 --> 00:27:11.120]  We've got some big guests today.
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:14.162]  We've got the big article that was in the New York Times.
[00:27:14.162 --> 00:27:15.923]  It was on Drudge last week.
[00:27:15.923 --> 00:27:17.184]  The Pentagon's Brain.
[00:27:17.184 --> 00:27:23.848]  An Uncensored History of DARPA, America's Top Secret Military Research Agency.
[00:27:23.848 --> 00:27:25.529]  Annie Jacobson.
[00:27:25.529 --> 00:27:27.731]  Let me tell you, I haven't read this book yet, but I've read
[00:27:28.985 --> 00:27:38.453]  The Boil Down, and I know most of what's in it, but what I'm saying is I know it's accurate from what I read in the synopsis.
[00:27:38.453 --> 00:27:41.656]  But when you read it all together, it just is crazy.
[00:27:41.656 --> 00:27:50.083]  And then the stuff that's not in the book that I can bring up when this lady's on, and some of it's classified, it's just crazy, man.
[00:27:50.905 --> 00:28:04.991]  They've got vaccines that are basically nanotech already, but they're not using them because it is a galactic crime to end free will without people accepting.
[00:28:04.991 --> 00:28:11.114]  That's why they say vaccines are the law, but they're not really, and they want to intimidate you into it, because you've got to do it by free will.
[00:28:11.114 --> 00:28:14.075]  Even if it's coercion, you've still got to do it.
[00:28:17.022 --> 00:28:19.443]  I mean, these people are so bad.
[00:28:19.443 --> 00:28:25.325]  Can you imagine wanting to brain damage the entire population so you can rule a bunch of zombies?
[00:28:25.325 --> 00:28:28.207]  I mean, that is so satanic.
[00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:31.648]  That is Satanism.
[00:28:31.648 --> 00:28:34.309]  See, Satanists claim they're about free will and human empowerment.
[00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:36.490]  No, you're not.
[00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:42.773]  And once your teeth are down your throat, you'll understand that.
[00:28:42.773 --> 00:28:43.693]  These people are so weak.
[00:28:46.257 --> 00:28:52.803]  You seek after power when it was laying right in front of you the whole time.
[00:28:52.803 --> 00:28:57.487]  I don't know why the weak are attracted to evil.
[00:28:57.487 --> 00:29:06.195]  But I tell you this, you people who've gathered yourselves together in big armies, in your lust to bring down the strong and the brave and the true, you're gonna fail.
[00:29:06.195 --> 00:29:07.496]  Know that.
[00:29:07.496 --> 00:29:11.500]  It was written on your head from the beginning, before you were born.
[00:29:13.186 --> 00:29:19.152]  You were destined to follow your God straight to hell.
[00:29:19.152 --> 00:29:20.173]  So, enjoy yourselves.
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.221]  He says it's routine.
[00:29:39.221 --> 00:29:40.262]  Another routine shooting.
[00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:46.385]  What's routine is they take every shooting, that's incredibly rare on average, and act like it's the end of the world.
[00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:53.309]  What a bunch of guilt-tripping, disgusting drama queens.
[00:29:53.309 --> 00:29:54.590]  As if they care about human life.
[00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:00.718]  Selective outrage.
[00:30:00.718 --> 00:30:04.661]  Obama hasn't said a damn word about routine mass shootings in Chicago.
[00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:14.810]  Following the mass shooting in Oregon Thursday, the president delivered a 12-minute tirade about the need for stricter gun control laws and admitted he was politicizing the incident before the body count was even in.
[00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:20.294]  When he wasn't referring to himself 28 times, a visibly angry Obama called mass shootings in the U.S.
[00:30:20.294 --> 00:30:20.755]  routine.
[00:30:21.215 --> 00:30:23.336]  Somehow this has become routine, Obama said.
[00:30:23.336 --> 00:30:25.976]  My response here at this podium has become routine.
[00:30:25.976 --> 00:30:31.238]  And what becomes routine is the response from those who oppose any sort of gun control legislation.
[00:30:31.238 --> 00:30:33.518]  Hey Obama, leave the guns alone!
[00:30:33.518 --> 00:30:40.340]  Stop trying to disarm people who are law-abiding citizens who want to protect themselves, their family, their property.
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.420]  That is the right.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.081]  We don't need a gun law.
[00:30:43.081 --> 00:30:44.581]  Our law is a Second Amendment.
[00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:50.510]  You keep attacking people day in and day out, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it.
[00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:54.236]  This is on you, your anti-gun agenda, Obama.
[00:30:54.236 --> 00:30:54.917]  I'm Joe Biggs.

[00:32:32.198 --> 00:32:37.199]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[00:32:37.199 --> 00:32:40.500]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.961]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:45.941]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:48.062]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[00:32:48.062 --> 00:32:50.062]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[00:32:50.062 --> 00:32:55.643]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[00:33:16.295 --> 00:33:18.576]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:18.576 --> 00:33:20.237]  Crashing the lies.
[00:33:20.237 --> 00:33:21.959]  Disinformation.
[00:33:21.959 --> 00:33:23.399]  I'm not a hypocrite, folks.
[00:33:23.399 --> 00:33:25.040]  I'm just a man, just like you.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.182]  And I'm here to tell you, you have incredible power.
[00:33:28.182 --> 00:33:29.863]  You have a destiny to be free.
[00:33:29.863 --> 00:33:32.065]  Your progeny have a destiny to be free.
[00:33:32.065 --> 00:33:37.088]  All of our ancestors dreamed for us to be more successful and to build a great world together.
[00:33:37.748 --> 00:33:48.816]  And their love, their honor, their strength, even though we become dishonored, even though we become decadent and weak on everything they gave us, their strength, still as a spirit, carries us on as God's gift.
[00:33:48.816 --> 00:33:50.298]  Don't you see eternal life is real?
[00:33:50.298 --> 00:33:55.722]  It's real in genetics at one level, and it's real at levels above that as well.
[00:33:55.722 --> 00:34:02.467]  Life goes on over and over and over again in the mastermind of the Creator.
[00:34:02.467 --> 00:34:05.149]  And it's in the face of incredible corruption and deceit
[00:34:06.598 --> 00:34:11.303]  That I quote the famous statement that I think is from an unknown person scribbled it on a wall.
[00:34:11.303 --> 00:34:14.928]  I know in World War II there are no atheists and foxholes.
[00:34:14.928 --> 00:34:16.349]  But let's look up the providence of that quote.
[00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:20.995]  I believe it's attributed to someone who was anonymous.
[00:34:20.995 --> 00:34:25.039]  And the elite know that there is more in heaven and earth than in all our books.
[00:34:26.124 --> 00:34:39.044]  And that's why they try to make us... I mean, psychologists say that animals, dogs, don't feel joy, and don't smile, and don't get excited, and that we project our emotion onto it and imagine.
[00:34:39.044 --> 00:34:41.527]  That is absolute, total bull!
[00:34:42.438 --> 00:34:45.078]  Your dog will starve to death before it eats you.
[00:34:45.078 --> 00:34:46.199]  Your dog gets excited.
[00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:47.619]  Your dog loves you.
[00:34:47.619 --> 00:34:58.561]  You can see that in your dog and they tell you that your dog doesn't have free will, that your dog is inhonorable, that your dog doesn't love you because they don't want you to love anything but them.
[00:34:58.561 --> 00:35:02.301]  They say that women don't love men, that men don't love women.
[00:35:02.301 --> 00:35:10.263]  They say that there is no honor in the world because they want you to give up.
[00:35:10.263 --> 00:35:11.463]  That's right, it is unknown.
[00:35:13.612 --> 00:35:16.314]  World War II.
[00:35:16.314 --> 00:35:17.895]  Biggs, are there atheists in foxholes?
[00:35:45.182 --> 00:35:53.352]  I mean, there was one scenario when we were sitting on a mountaintop, and these guys are shooting these, the Taliban's shooting at us, these huge, like, you know, anti-aircraft guns towards us.
[00:35:54.502 --> 00:36:09.872]  And we have to sit here and my back is against a sand berm and I've got about four inches between me and where the bullets are flying and I'm trying to like barely breathe so my chest doesn't expand out and it catch my bulletproof vest and spin me around and then hit me.
[00:36:09.872 --> 00:36:24.282]  So I'm sitting here and it's nighttime and you can see the tracers just going by and you're sitting there like oh my god I hope there is a god I hope that something's going on and you'll hear these guys who are always like there's no god there's no god screaming and crying the top of their lungs help me god help me god I'm sorry I'm sorry.
[00:36:25.927 --> 00:36:26.549]  So, yeah.
[00:36:26.549 --> 00:36:28.877]  I don't think there's any atheists in foxholes.
[00:36:31.653 --> 00:36:33.374]  This is a true tragedy that happened.
[00:36:33.374 --> 00:36:38.198]  I actually feel for these people, like you do, because they were in a victim disarmament zone.
[00:36:38.198 --> 00:36:38.819]  They were ignorant.
[00:36:38.819 --> 00:36:43.703]  Now they'll be used as a sacrifice to demonize human independence, human's right to defense.
[00:36:43.703 --> 00:36:51.869]  They'll be used as a burnt offering to sell the further enslavement and domestication of the people by a bunch of cold-blooded vampires.
[00:36:51.869 --> 00:36:54.832]  And Obama, we're going to play a clip in a moment about this Oregon shooting.
[00:36:55.532 --> 00:36:56.933]  He says, oh, this is so routine.
[00:36:56.933 --> 00:37:05.797]  Yeah, it's routine that they exploit every tragedy when statistically, I'm going to say it again, 166, 167 people a year die in mass shootings.
[00:37:05.797 --> 00:37:08.038]  200 plus people die from white-tailed deer.
[00:37:08.038 --> 00:37:11.640]  Is he going to go out and give a speech every time white-tailed deer kill somebody?
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.500]  Or honeybees kill 300?
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:15.121]  Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[00:37:15.121 --> 00:37:20.864]  I mean, the only thing that's routine is the fact that he said he exploits every single thing that he can use to help push his anti-gun agenda.
[00:37:22.054 --> 00:37:23.675]  They don't want you to be able to protect yourself.
[00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:34.141]  I mean, it was discussing yesterday, we're out there at the campus of UT, and these people are sitting there screaming, giving these sob stories, and, you know, you know, we don't need guns on campus, you know, that's going to cause more drama.
[00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:40.704]  You're out there because Texas is passing a law to let folks be armed on campus, explain that to them, and then this happens while you're out there covering it.
[00:37:40.704 --> 00:37:50.290]  Yeah, so next year in August 2016, they have, well, they've already passed it, but it'll go into effect for campus carry, so students with CHL 21 and up who go and take the class,
[00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:55.793]  And go through all the proper stuff, fingerprints and all that, they can conceal carry on campus.
[00:37:55.793 --> 00:38:00.055]  Now right now you're able to carry on public sidewalks, in the parking garages, all that.
[00:38:00.055 --> 00:38:02.876]  You can carry long rifles, anything like that you want.
[00:38:02.876 --> 00:38:04.197]  Conceal carry is well out there.
[00:38:04.197 --> 00:38:08.939]  Like where we were at yesterday protesting, there were people carrying guns, but they were concealed and you couldn't see them.
[00:38:08.939 --> 00:38:12.381]  And no one was going, you know, crazy over that because obviously you're not going to see concealed carry.
[00:38:12.381 --> 00:38:15.623]  And so UT and others with Bloomberg are trying to just throw fits and stop it.
[00:38:16.434 --> 00:38:18.495]  When it just shows their disconnect.
[00:38:18.495 --> 00:38:22.116]  A criminal, a crazy is going to go on there, even though Oregon was a gun-free zone.
[00:38:22.116 --> 00:38:24.297]  That's what the criminals, the cowards choose.
[00:38:24.297 --> 00:38:25.418]  Well that's what people don't understand.
[00:38:25.418 --> 00:38:28.959]  Criminals don't follow laws, that is why they are criminals.
[00:38:28.959 --> 00:38:37.763]  So when you put these strict gun laws everywhere, all you do is you disarm people, take away their ability to protect themselves, and you empower the criminals who want to go out and do bad.
[00:38:38.183 --> 00:38:42.024]  Now, yesterday there was a guy, an armed Air Force veteran was there.
[00:38:42.024 --> 00:38:48.966]  He says an Air Force veteran who had a license to conceal carry was present at the school yesterday during the shooting.
[00:38:48.966 --> 00:38:52.107]  He said there were a few people in the Vet Center and then we heard shooting happened.
[00:38:52.107 --> 00:38:54.688]  We got up and we were going to head out and see what we could do.
[00:38:54.688 --> 00:38:59.409]  He said at that point in time, the faculty immediately told him to stop and held us inside the building.
[00:38:59.409 --> 00:39:02.330]  Essentially, they would not let us go and assist.
[00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.530]  Now, it's a gun-free zone.
[00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:06.051]  He illegally had the gun in there, but he could have saved some lives.
[00:39:06.371 --> 00:39:09.474]  Well, I mean, I think the guy's great, but I would have just ignored those people, wouldn't you?
[00:39:09.474 --> 00:39:11.076]  Yeah, I would have told them to go screw off.
[00:39:11.076 --> 00:39:13.178]  I would have just knocked one of them out if I had to.
[00:39:13.178 --> 00:39:17.602]  If me punching a teacher is going to save ten people's lives, by all means, you're going to get knocked out.
[00:39:17.602 --> 00:39:23.688]  Well, you notice, I'm not bragging, but you don't see a lot of this going on in Texas, or when they start it, when the Al-Qaeda folks show up, they just get killed.
[00:39:23.688 --> 00:39:24.949]  I mean, I'm not bragging here.
[00:39:24.949 --> 00:39:25.850]  I'm not doing anything special.
[00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.254]  Everybody I know, my dad, anybody else, people, somebody's killing somebody across the street.
[00:39:29.634 --> 00:39:30.234]  They're gonna charge in?
[00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:33.897]  What about this vet that got shot seven times who was unarmed?
[00:39:33.897 --> 00:39:37.319]  You know, maybe they should have chopped his arms off so he couldn't fight back.
[00:39:37.319 --> 00:39:41.582]  Oregon shooting heroic veteran Chris Mintz was shot seven times trying to save people.
[00:39:41.582 --> 00:39:43.743]  Also in my old unit at Fort Bragg, airborne.
[00:39:43.743 --> 00:39:46.885]  The guy got a lot of mutual friends of mine.
[00:39:46.885 --> 00:39:48.847]  I found that out this morning.
[00:39:48.847 --> 00:39:53.109]  So yeah, this guy was shot five times and his family released a statement today.
[00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:54.790]  I got on his Facebook and looked.
[00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:56.892]  Said he's okay, but he is gonna have to learn how to walk again.
[00:39:57.512 --> 00:39:59.993]  And after he was shot five times, he was laying on the ground, you know.
[00:39:59.993 --> 00:40:01.353]  They were saying seven, it's five.
[00:40:01.353 --> 00:40:06.014]  Yeah, five times, what I saw in here, but who knows, they keep misreporting stuff.
[00:40:06.014 --> 00:40:09.995]  He was laying on the ground screaming, today's my son's birthday, today's my son's birthday.
[00:40:09.995 --> 00:40:15.397]  And this guy, without a gun, ran beeline towards this gunman to try to take him out.
[00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:18.130]  That's the kind of people that are out there.
[00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.973]  That's the kind of guy that you want to conceal carry to have a gun.
[00:40:20.973 --> 00:40:22.574]  He could have taken that guy out immediately.
[00:40:22.574 --> 00:40:26.497]  And that's who the globalists hate and say is the number one enemy of quote homeland security.
[00:40:26.497 --> 00:40:28.279]  Well then who the hell is homeland security?
[00:40:28.279 --> 00:40:29.620]  I'll tell you who runs it.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.522]  Foreign banks that took over this country.
[00:40:32.522 --> 00:40:35.205]  How dare them say that the vets are the number one enemy.
[00:40:35.205 --> 00:40:37.547]  It's because they're criminals and they know vets aren't cowards.
[00:40:38.404 --> 00:40:39.064]  That's why they hate him.
[00:40:39.064 --> 00:40:42.366]  Then you got this coward, Chris Harper Mercer, the guy who was the gunman.
[00:40:42.366 --> 00:40:44.228]  This guy hated Christianity.
[00:40:44.228 --> 00:40:51.152]  He told people in the school to lay down on the ground, sprawl out, and then he told them one by one to stand up and goes, are you a Christian?
[00:40:51.152 --> 00:40:52.833]  If they answered yes, boom, execute.
[00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:53.873]  Just like Columbine.
[00:40:53.873 --> 00:40:54.454]  Yep.
[00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:55.675]  Executed him right there.
[00:40:55.675 --> 00:40:57.836]  And if they said no, he wounded him, shot him in the leg.
[00:40:57.836 --> 00:41:00.678]  This is a satanic spirit rising up in this country.
[00:41:00.678 --> 00:41:01.838]  It's out of control.
[00:41:01.838 --> 00:41:03.980]  Well, they're mad that we're exposing the babies being killed.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.601]  They're mad we're winning.
[00:41:05.601 --> 00:41:06.901]  And, you know, we're going to keep on winning.
[00:41:08.783 --> 00:41:16.756]  You know, yesterday, Tom Jefferson, he's a big gun rights activist, was arrested and held in jail last night until about 9.35, 9.40 for holding a sign at a protest.
[00:41:21.018 --> 00:41:22.139]  Like, really?
[00:41:22.139 --> 00:41:28.763]  And then the feminist professor gets out there and goes, we're not open to any kind of debate at all out here.
[00:41:28.763 --> 00:41:35.828]  We're just here to basically cram our agenda down your throat, and if you have anything to say against what we're saying, and you're pro-gun, we're gonna arrest you.
[00:41:35.828 --> 00:41:39.871]  There was a guy in the crowd walking around looking for any pro-gun signs.
[00:41:39.871 --> 00:41:40.951]  He found two.
[00:41:40.951 --> 00:41:41.912]  And had them arrested.
[00:41:41.912 --> 00:41:42.732]  And had them arrested.
[00:41:42.732 --> 00:41:45.374]  I mean, that's a sensational story right there.
[00:41:45.374 --> 00:41:48.937]  That's what I grew up with as a kid, hearing about in China or Soviet Russia.
[00:41:48.937 --> 00:41:50.698]  And now it's just, oh, that's what we did in America.
[00:41:52.019 --> 00:41:54.942]  I mean, never in a million years did I think that I would see something like that.
[00:41:54.942 --> 00:41:57.805]  And I saw the video of those Bloomberg security goons.
[00:41:57.805 --> 00:42:01.989]  They enjoyed violating the first amendment, just like they liked the second to go down.
[00:42:01.989 --> 00:42:05.332]  They just enjoy it, like they think they're on some winning team.
[00:42:05.332 --> 00:42:07.014]  They love their dishonor.
[00:42:07.014 --> 00:42:08.855]  Well, my favorite thing is what Jakari said yesterday.
[00:42:08.855 --> 00:42:10.117]  Jakari was pissed.
[00:42:10.117 --> 00:42:11.218]  I've never seen Jakari this pissed.
[00:42:11.718 --> 00:42:13.620]  I mean, he was pissed yesterday when he came back.
[00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:18.505]  When those two guys were pulled away and arrested, people started screaming and clapping, all these women in the crowd.
[00:42:18.505 --> 00:42:19.826]  Yay!
[00:42:19.826 --> 00:42:21.087]  And Jakari goes... Hey, don't worry.
[00:42:21.087 --> 00:42:22.769]  They're going to have their pension funds taken.
[00:42:22.769 --> 00:42:24.090]  All these fools don't get it.
[00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.053]  What made America great was the right to defense and speech.
[00:42:27.053 --> 00:42:27.894]  They're taking it all.
[00:42:27.894 --> 00:42:30.777]  They're going to lose everything by pulling a plug in a bathtub.
[00:42:31.698 --> 00:42:31.998]  Yeah.
[00:42:31.998 --> 00:42:37.781]  I mean, all our, everything, the wealth, the prosperity, it's all going down the toilet, you dumb witches!
[00:42:37.781 --> 00:42:38.201]  Sorry.
[00:42:38.201 --> 00:42:46.666]  What they didn't realize is they were clapping not for him being taken away because he was pro-gun, he was getting taken away for his First Amendment rights.
[00:42:46.666 --> 00:42:50.008]  That means that could happen to each and every one of you that are out there clapping in the crowd.
[00:42:50.008 --> 00:42:51.969]  The so-called left wants to get rid of free speech.
[00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:54.289]  And it was amazing.
[00:42:54.289 --> 00:42:57.572]  I went and tried to open up dialogue and speak to all these people in the crowd.
[00:42:57.572 --> 00:43:01.214]  Not one of them that had on their Gun For You t-shirt, no I'm not here to talk.
[00:43:01.214 --> 00:43:02.596]  I don't have anything to say.
[00:43:02.596 --> 00:43:06.078]  That's because they're all... Socialists, communists never talk.
[00:43:06.078 --> 00:43:07.700]  They only repeat what their dear leader says.
[00:43:08.561 --> 00:43:09.202]  I mean, it was ridiculous.
[00:43:09.202 --> 00:43:10.082]  They're not individuals.
[00:43:10.082 --> 00:43:12.024]  These are literally stupid people.
[00:43:12.024 --> 00:43:13.245]  Oh yeah, they completely.
[00:43:13.245 --> 00:43:16.328]  I mean, there were so many times yesterday I was going to lose my cool.
[00:43:16.328 --> 00:43:18.730]  And I had to keep telling myself, don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:19.811]  Just keep doing what you gotta do.
[00:43:19.811 --> 00:43:21.232]  Go to the next person.
[00:43:21.232 --> 00:43:24.515]  I mean, as soon as you said something, it was like, you better check your privilege.
[00:43:24.515 --> 00:43:26.157]  Oh, you can't talk to a woman like that.
[00:43:26.157 --> 00:43:28.899]  Why are you being loud?
[00:43:28.899 --> 00:43:29.680]  Stop talking to us.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.541]  We don't want to debate you.
[00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:34.664]  That's all, I'm feminist, I'll take your speech.
[00:43:34.664 --> 00:43:37.366]  And they're at the UN trying to get rid of free speech right now.
[00:43:37.366 --> 00:43:41.790]  Isn't a university campus supposed to be a place where you can debate and discuss things?
[00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:49.897]  Well think about how racist they are, that inherently you're a white male, but then they'll come up to black males that are libertarian or conservative and say, you're a male.
[00:43:49.897 --> 00:43:51.879]  See, there's no getting out of this.
[00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:52.799]  There's no getting out of this.
[00:43:52.799 --> 00:43:54.161]  You're bad because you're a male.
[00:43:54.761 --> 00:44:01.205]  But if you're some emasculated weird little guy in a pink shirt with them going, men are bad, men are bad, then the girls will pat you on the head.
[00:44:01.205 --> 00:44:02.967]  Is that woman going to take care of you when you got the flu?
[00:44:02.967 --> 00:44:04.568]  Is she going to take care of you when you have a heart attack?
[00:44:04.568 --> 00:44:06.969]  Is she going to take care of you when you're in a frickin' nursing home?
[00:44:06.969 --> 00:44:07.950]  Is she honorable?
[00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:09.571]  They've taken our families away.
[00:44:09.571 --> 00:44:11.212]  They've taken our honor away.
[00:44:11.212 --> 00:44:12.173]  Don't you people get it?
[00:44:12.173 --> 00:44:13.454]  They've made you alone.
[00:44:13.454 --> 00:44:16.576]  You're miserable because the state isn't your husband.
[00:44:16.576 --> 00:44:17.697]  It isn't your wife.
[00:44:17.697 --> 00:44:19.218]  It won't take care of you.
[00:44:19.218 --> 00:44:20.339]  It doesn't love you.
[00:44:21.459 --> 00:44:25.802]  There was this guy out there, I don't even know if I can call him a guy, he was about as big as a toothpick.
[00:44:25.802 --> 00:44:30.485]  And he had a little voice like this, and he goes, so you guys are pro-gang?
[00:44:30.485 --> 00:44:32.146]  That's just so horrible.
[00:44:32.146 --> 00:44:33.547]  I'm pro-Hillary Clinton.
[00:44:33.547 --> 00:44:34.548]  I like Elmo.
[00:44:34.548 --> 00:44:36.569]  And I was like, wow, have you been castrated?
[00:44:36.569 --> 00:44:38.790]  Did you hand your man card over to the gun-free UT crowd?
[00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:42.413]  I was like, this guy was the opposite of what any man should be.
[00:44:42.413 --> 00:44:44.214]  He didn't care, he was just a little robot.
[00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.571]  Oh, I don't like Jones at all.
[00:44:46.571 --> 00:44:48.372]  It's so bad, okay?
[00:44:48.372 --> 00:44:49.933]  Yeah, let's get rid of him.
[00:44:49.933 --> 00:44:51.214]  Look at some of the other signs.
[00:44:51.214 --> 00:44:52.515]  Why you should be a socialist.
[00:44:52.515 --> 00:44:54.396]  This is the trash that they got out there.
[00:44:54.396 --> 00:44:54.877]  Yeah, that they have.
[00:44:54.877 --> 00:44:57.719]  Yeah, why you should live in a hellhole where people give you whatever you've got.
[00:44:57.719 --> 00:44:59.100]  It's called being a slave.
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.561]  So it's just saying why you should be a slave.
[00:45:01.181 --> 00:45:02.002]  That was everywhere.
[00:45:02.002 --> 00:45:03.303]  That was a giant sign.
[00:45:03.303 --> 00:45:04.564]  That was about four foot big.
[00:45:04.564 --> 00:45:05.865]  I took that picture.
[00:45:05.865 --> 00:45:07.206]  Or maybe Kit got that one as well.
[00:45:07.206 --> 00:45:09.448]  But that one was out there.
[00:45:09.448 --> 00:45:10.148]  There was another one.
[00:45:10.148 --> 00:45:11.849]  The whole board where they hang up posters.
[00:45:11.849 --> 00:45:13.471]  All these socialist clubs.
[00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:14.492]  How to be a socialist.
[00:45:14.492 --> 00:45:15.632]  What it means to be a socialist.
[00:45:15.632 --> 00:45:16.533]  Why you should be a socialist.
[00:45:16.533 --> 00:45:17.414]  I can't stand these people.
[00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:19.135]  It's everywhere at UT.
[00:45:19.135 --> 00:45:21.337]  It is so liberal there now.
[00:45:21.337 --> 00:45:22.398]  It is completely.
[00:45:22.398 --> 00:45:23.579]  It's like its own world.
[00:45:24.673 --> 00:45:25.434]  Within Texas.
[00:45:25.434 --> 00:45:27.555]  It's completely unlike everywhere else in Texas.
[00:45:27.555 --> 00:45:30.877]  And they admit they're going to battleground it and just destroy everything.
[00:45:30.877 --> 00:45:36.001]  Well, I mean, my argument was yesterday was like, all right, one in five women at the UT campus have a good chance.
[00:45:36.001 --> 00:45:36.861]  They've even been raped.
[00:45:36.861 --> 00:45:37.982]  They've been sexually harassed.
[00:45:37.982 --> 00:45:39.203]  Look at this communist sign.
[00:45:39.203 --> 00:45:43.726]  I was like, don't you want women to have the ability to be able to fight off someone like that?
[00:45:43.726 --> 00:45:44.987]  Some sexual predator?
[00:45:44.987 --> 00:45:45.708]  Wouldn't you want that?
[00:45:45.708 --> 00:45:47.449]  And I even asked the woman, I was like, wouldn't you want that?
[00:45:47.449 --> 00:45:50.191]  Yeah, isn't it female empowerment to have women be armed?
[00:45:50.191 --> 00:45:50.431]  Yeah.
[00:45:51.718 --> 00:45:52.578]  He's like, it's just ridiculous.
[00:45:52.578 --> 00:45:53.679]  We don't need to have them.
[00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:57.421]  I don't feel comfortable being in a classroom where other people have guns and I don't know their agenda.
[00:45:57.421 --> 00:45:59.962]  I guarantee you those women didn't have fathers.
[00:45:59.962 --> 00:46:00.803]  That they are the problem.
[00:46:00.803 --> 00:46:02.023]  I'm not knocking people that didn't have a dad.
[00:46:02.023 --> 00:46:02.323]  I get it.
[00:46:02.323 --> 00:46:03.224]  Some dads are bad.
[00:46:03.224 --> 00:46:06.105]  But I mean, just these are women that didn't have a man around.
[00:46:06.105 --> 00:46:07.006]  So it's alien to them.
[00:46:08.177 --> 00:46:11.641]  And the weird thing is these women, if they do get men, always have the worst guys.
[00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:19.429]  Oh, the men that were there were like popped collar polos, pink shirts, jeans tighter than, I mean, that's probably why that one guy was talking the way he was.
[00:46:19.429 --> 00:46:27.058]  I mean, little loafs and just kind of skipping around everywhere with their gun-free signs and stuff like, we're just here to empower everyone.
[00:46:27.058 --> 00:46:28.719]  We think we should be armed with reason.
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:30.580]  What are you talking about?
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.321]  This is the definition of useful.
[00:46:32.321 --> 00:46:34.962]  Yeah, I wonder how many people were armed with reason yesterday in Oregon.
[00:46:34.962 --> 00:46:35.642]  How'd that help?
[00:46:35.642 --> 00:46:36.282]  How'd that work out?
[00:46:36.282 --> 00:46:36.862]  Not too good.
[00:46:36.862 --> 00:46:39.823]  I want to get to this Obama clip, this Obama Nation clip.
[00:46:39.823 --> 00:46:46.505]  This is Obama exploiting the tragedy, saying nothing about two shootings, mass shootings in Chicago yesterday, saying, oh, it's so routine.
[00:46:47.205 --> 00:46:47.465]  There's 166, 167, 168.
[00:46:47.465 --> 00:46:48.325]  It varies.
[00:46:48.325 --> 00:46:48.865]  It's in the 160s.
[00:46:48.865 --> 00:46:49.426]  Look it up yourself.
[00:46:49.426 --> 00:46:50.006]  Mass shootings.
[00:46:50.006 --> 00:46:50.166]  168 people.
[00:46:50.166 --> 00:46:50.186]  167.
[00:46:50.186 --> 00:46:50.766]  Let's just say 170 to be safe.
[00:46:50.766 --> 00:46:51.066]  Every year.
[00:46:51.066 --> 00:46:51.746]  I mean, wasps, 300 and something.
[00:46:51.746 --> 00:46:52.486]  Brown recluse, 400 and something.
[00:46:52.486 --> 00:46:55.007]  Honeybees, 300 and something dead.
[00:46:55.007 --> 00:46:56.527]  White-tailed deer, 200 and something.
[00:46:56.527 --> 00:46:57.627]  I mean, look it up in the World Almanac, folks.
[00:47:10.066 --> 00:47:15.448]  I mean, do we have toilet safety police, you know, to save us because a black widow might bite you on the butt?
[00:47:15.448 --> 00:47:18.069]  I mean, this is pure lunacy.
[00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.969]  So let's go ahead.
[00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:20.229]  I'm going to skip this break.
[00:47:20.229 --> 00:47:25.191]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip right now of his lordship yesterday.
[00:47:25.191 --> 00:47:26.211]  Here it is.
[00:47:26.211 --> 00:47:28.872]  Somehow this has become routine.
[00:47:28.872 --> 00:47:31.573]  Hit pause.
[00:47:31.573 --> 00:47:31.893]  Back it up.
[00:47:32.984 --> 00:47:41.648]  Yeah, what's routine is 300 plus thousand dead, about 80% of them on the Syrian government side, innocent Christians, non-radical Muslims.
[00:47:41.648 --> 00:47:56.476]  When you put Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra, ISIS in there, and you've done it in Libya, you tried to overthrow our allies, and did for a year, and they blew up almost every church in the country, attacked the military bases, the government did, and crucified people at the government ministry upside down.
[00:47:57.576 --> 00:47:59.838]  And Anderson Cooper of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:47:59.838 --> 00:48:01.340]  I mean, people think I just say that.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:02.281]  No, people send emails.
[00:48:02.281 --> 00:48:03.041]  He really is CIA.
[00:48:03.041 --> 00:48:03.682]  I thought you were joking.
[00:48:03.682 --> 00:48:05.303]  No, he is CIA, admittedly.
[00:48:05.303 --> 00:48:16.333]  This is who runs our CIA now, is some cowardly little piece of garbage who gets up there and overthrows our allies who had stability and freedom, comparatively, in Egypt, to put the Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda, in charge.
[00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:20.317]  That's who that is, to murder over 50,000 Christians in Egypt alone.
[00:48:20.938 --> 00:48:28.212]  Our government wants to murder Christians, just like this dirtbag, asking folks if they're Christian, and to Christian's credit, they would say, yes, I'm a Christian.
[00:48:28.212 --> 00:48:29.334]  Blam!
[00:48:29.334 --> 00:48:30.035]  That's conviction.
[00:48:31.425 --> 00:48:33.507]  Quite frankly, that guy's not worth the truth for me.
[00:48:33.507 --> 00:48:34.888]  I'd just lie to him.
[00:48:34.888 --> 00:48:35.808]  I'm not denying Christ.
[00:48:35.808 --> 00:48:41.153]  When I get it, it goes back to the Christian deal, you know, to three times, you know, before the cock crows, you're gonna deny me.
[00:48:41.153 --> 00:48:42.113]  I get that.
[00:48:42.113 --> 00:48:44.735]  But, you know, I mean, I lied sneaking into Bohemian Grove.
[00:48:44.735 --> 00:48:46.637]  I don't lie on issues that affect people.
[00:48:46.637 --> 00:48:48.238]  But, I mean, I'm gonna be honest.
[00:48:48.238 --> 00:48:48.879]  I lie.
[00:48:48.879 --> 00:48:50.960]  I mean, did you ever lie when you were in combat?
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.882]  Like, when you were doing something, like, with foreigners?
[00:48:52.882 --> 00:48:54.163]  Oh, of course.
[00:48:54.163 --> 00:48:56.745]  Just to keep things calm so stuff doesn't escalate.
[00:48:56.745 --> 00:48:59.087]  Yeah, so, I mean, I'm not defending lies.
[00:48:59.087 --> 00:49:00.548]  I'm being honest about lying here.
[00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:03.168]  I don't know why I just digressed off into that.
[00:49:03.168 --> 00:49:05.451]  I mean, I would never lie about a product.
[00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:07.232]  I never lie about serious issues.
[00:49:07.232 --> 00:49:08.253]  I never lie about the news.
[00:49:08.253 --> 00:49:09.735]  I wouldn't lie about an issue.
[00:49:09.735 --> 00:49:21.065]  But if I'm sneaking onto a military base 15 years ago to videotape Delta Force training to take out governors, when they asked me, I mean, I had to lie.
[00:49:21.065 --> 00:49:21.986]  Yeah, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[00:49:21.986 --> 00:49:24.689]  They still figured it out, put a gun to my... took our camera.
[00:49:25.776 --> 00:49:27.157]  Somehow this has become routine.
[00:49:27.157 --> 00:49:27.958]  The reporting is routine.
[00:49:54.457 --> 00:50:00.499]  My response here at this podium ends up being routine.
[00:50:00.499 --> 00:50:08.181]  The conversation in the aftermath of it, we've become numb to this.
[00:50:08.181 --> 00:50:09.601]  Oh, because we know you're a line pick.
[00:50:09.601 --> 00:50:16.503]  After Columbine and Blacksburg, after Tucson, after Newtown, after Aurora, after Charleston,
[00:50:22.256 --> 00:50:30.238]  It cannot be this easy for somebody who wants to inflict harm on other people to get his or her hands on a gun.
[00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:30.918]  Oh no!
[00:50:30.918 --> 00:50:33.619]  So we have to take everybody's guns, if you've got a bunch of Prozac, anti-Christian supporters.
[00:50:33.619 --> 00:50:35.900]  And what's going to be the result, of course, is the response of you.
[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.860]  Of those who oppose any kind of common sense gun legislation.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.501]  Common sense uses these words.
[00:50:40.501 --> 00:50:41.661]  Like smart meters?
[00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:44.902]  Right now, I can imagine the press releases being cranked out.
[00:50:48.134 --> 00:50:49.355]  We need more guns.
[00:50:49.355 --> 00:50:50.235]  Yes.
[00:50:50.235 --> 00:50:51.836]  You got guns protection, you turn.
[00:50:51.836 --> 00:50:54.317]  Fewer gun safety laws.
[00:50:54.317 --> 00:50:56.858]  Yes.
[00:50:56.858 --> 00:50:59.339]  If everyone has a gun and someone goes and shoots something.
[00:50:59.339 --> 00:51:00.220]  Back in five seconds.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:00.900]  Exactly.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:01.560]  42 people are going to get killed.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.381]  They hate it.
[00:51:02.381 --> 00:51:04.922]  Guns are getting more popular, abortion is getting unpopular.
[00:51:07.365 --> 00:51:08.907]  69% of Hispanics don't want open borders.
[00:51:08.907 --> 00:51:10.648]  They always go, if you're Hispanic, we don't want open borders.
[00:51:10.648 --> 00:51:11.008]  Why?
[00:51:11.008 --> 00:51:17.194]  So, whether you're from Japan, China, Mexico, India, anybody can just come here.
[00:51:17.194 --> 00:51:17.994]  We gotta pay for them?
[00:51:17.994 --> 00:51:19.496]  People aren't stupid.
[00:51:19.496 --> 00:51:20.356]  And I don't even believe Gallup.
[00:51:20.356 --> 00:51:22.778]  It's like 85% of the Mexicans I know don't want open borders.
[00:51:22.778 --> 00:51:24.039]  Because they're Americans.
[00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:27.142]  It's like, I don't say I'm German and English.
[00:51:27.142 --> 00:51:30.165]  I mean, what I'm saying is, Joe, they're losing the battle.
[00:51:30.165 --> 00:51:31.446]  They know they're losing.
[00:51:31.446 --> 00:51:32.467]  What do you say about, what are you saying?
[00:51:33.916 --> 00:51:34.897]  I think it's BS.
[00:51:34.897 --> 00:51:36.699]  I mean, his response is routine.
[00:51:36.699 --> 00:51:39.621]  The fact that he wants to take away your right to protect yourself.
[00:51:39.621 --> 00:51:45.125]  Every time there's something happen, he jumps on it, like a dog, and just starts, just attacks it.
[00:51:45.125 --> 00:51:48.208]  All right, let's use this to push our anti-gun agenda.
[00:51:48.208 --> 00:51:49.969]  Let's push it, let's push it, let's push it.
[00:51:49.969 --> 00:51:54.733]  No, what we should be doing is arming people so they have the ability to take that guy out quicker.
[00:51:54.733 --> 00:51:55.954]  Well, obviously he knows that.
[00:51:55.954 --> 00:51:57.495]  He wants to disarm us.
[00:51:57.495 --> 00:52:00.477]  Joe, the leader of the free world, no longer.
[00:52:00.477 --> 00:52:01.958]  Russia's the leader of the free world because of him.
[00:52:02.719 --> 00:52:04.740]  And the globalists and their failure.
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:08.363]  He's saying you are the number one terror threat in America.
[00:52:08.363 --> 00:52:12.725]  And I guess if America's firing globalists, they want to enslave us, I guess you are the number one threat.
[00:52:12.725 --> 00:52:13.366]  Yeah, I guess.
[00:52:13.366 --> 00:52:21.671]  How does it feel when you actually fought al-Qaeda and al-Nusra and all these similar groups in four tours or whatever, how does it feel to be called a terrorist?
[00:52:22.938 --> 00:52:25.519]  It pisses me off, and it pisses off all my buddies, too.
[00:52:25.519 --> 00:52:51.004]  I mean, to know that you went over there and you bled for this country because you cared about it, you volunteered to go over there, you weren't forced to do it, so you made that conscious decision to go step out there and take a bullet, and shoot, and do what you had to do to help make America better, and to find out that it's all a lie and you're going to be treated like garbage, you're going to come back with wounds that are seen and unseen, you can't even get healthcare at the VA, you're treated like an animal, you're thrown out there in the street, I mean, homeless vets are out of control, I mean, they're everywhere now.
[00:52:51.781 --> 00:52:53.666]  I'll tell you, I want to do some stories on this.
[00:52:53.666 --> 00:52:59.360]  I'm always so shocked when I run into a listener that's a vet that I don't ever have a camera and I don't get their numbers.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.643]  I usually have a cell phone, but it'll be like...
[00:53:01.601 --> 00:53:07.545]  Like a white guy who looks like Clark Kent and is on a bicycle with a backpack.
[00:53:07.545 --> 00:53:09.766]  But you notice they kind of smell, and they look kind of wild-eyed.
[00:53:09.766 --> 00:53:10.747]  You can tell they got PTSD.
[00:53:10.747 --> 00:53:12.768]  And they'll say, well, I really appreciate you.
[00:53:12.768 --> 00:53:14.730]  And I'll say, are you living on the street?
[00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:16.491]  They go, yeah, but I'm saving money.
[00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:17.432]  I'm going to get back on my feet.
[00:53:17.432 --> 00:53:17.972]  I don't need any help.
[00:53:17.972 --> 00:53:18.993]  And they ride off.
[00:53:18.993 --> 00:53:20.273]  Or I was a big black guy.
[00:53:20.273 --> 00:53:23.536]  He looked like a black Clark Kent down at the Capitol one time.
[00:53:23.536 --> 00:53:24.877]  He goes, I heard you on the radio.
[00:53:24.877 --> 00:53:25.197]  I came over.
[00:53:25.197 --> 00:53:25.897]  I want you to know I'm a listener.
[00:53:25.897 --> 00:53:27.018]  He was on a bike.
[00:53:27.018 --> 00:53:28.939]  And he was just like, this guy looks like a linebacker, man.
[00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:31.101]  He was a super smart, well-spoken, nice guy.
[00:53:31.821 --> 00:53:33.442]  I've got a lot of friends who are struggling right now.
[00:53:33.442 --> 00:53:34.863]  I mean, I thought that was going to happen to me.
[00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:35.143]  I got scared.
[00:53:35.143 --> 00:53:37.164]  Both these guys I talked to were former Special Forces.
[00:53:51.371 --> 00:53:52.992]  Living on the streets in Austin.
[00:53:52.992 --> 00:53:57.735]  Yeah, the last year when I knew I was getting out from my injury, I started going through panic attacks.
[00:53:57.735 --> 00:54:00.837]  I started going through depression, all that, because I was like, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:54:00.837 --> 00:54:03.018]  My mom's telling me the economy's collapsed and all this.
[00:54:03.018 --> 00:54:06.020]  I was deployed, saying the gas prices were through the roof.
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:06.060]  2008?
[00:54:06.060 --> 00:54:06.620]  Yeah, 2008.
[00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.082]  And I'm sitting there like, man, I don't want to leave.
[00:54:09.082 --> 00:54:11.803]  I tried to volunteer to stay in Afghanistan again because it was almost better.
[00:54:11.803 --> 00:54:12.744]  Even though your life got blown up?
[00:54:12.864 --> 00:54:22.290]  Yeah, it was almost better for me to stay in Afghanistan than it would be to come back here and face what's going on in this country because, like you said, all my friends started getting out and I started hearing these stories.
[00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:27.733]  I was, quite frankly, scared to be a civilian because I knew I wasn't going to get taken care of.
[00:54:27.733 --> 00:54:32.095]  I was going to be just thrown at the curb and not even paid attention to.
[00:54:32.095 --> 00:54:37.739]  My buddies were telling me that they were spending months and months trying to get help at the VA, trying to be seen, trying to be heard.
[00:54:38.439 --> 00:54:39.100]  Nothing happens.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.202]  They would get another doctor, and they'd have to go through the whole process again.
[00:54:42.202 --> 00:54:47.846]  Or they'd miss an appointment, and then the VA kicked them out of the system, and then you had to go back and re-enter all that stuff.
[00:54:47.846 --> 00:54:52.750]  Think about it, these globalists have you fight their wars, and then they treat you like dog crap.
[00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:57.073]  Oh yeah, and then you've got to fight for years to even get the benefits you really are supposed to get.
[00:54:57.073 --> 00:54:58.634]  You shouldn't even have to do that.
[00:54:58.634 --> 00:55:03.878]  You should just be able to go in, scan your ID card, alright, here's my paperwork, my DD-214, this is what I did.
[00:55:04.338 --> 00:55:06.379]  They've done the actuaries.
[00:55:06.379 --> 00:55:08.401]  They can send you to the best doctors for the money they spend.
[00:55:08.401 --> 00:55:09.821]  It's all meant to waste stuff.
[00:55:09.821 --> 00:55:10.902]  It's all meant to not give you care.
[00:55:10.902 --> 00:55:12.083]  It's meant to screw you over.
[00:55:12.083 --> 00:55:13.904]  It makes you worse.
[00:55:13.904 --> 00:55:15.745]  The surgeries I've had are still my right foot.
[00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:17.446]  I went and had an x-ray not too long ago.
[00:55:17.446 --> 00:55:19.607]  The guy's like, do you know your foot's still broken in a few places?
[00:55:19.607 --> 00:55:21.689]  I was like, it does hurt, but I didn't know that.
[00:55:21.689 --> 00:55:24.010]  He goes, yeah, whoever did your surgery last jacked it up.
[00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.331]  I was like, the VA?
[00:55:25.331 --> 00:55:29.133]  He goes, uh, yeah, I guess that might have been us.
[00:55:29.133 --> 00:55:31.234]  Uh, do you want to refer you somewhere?
[00:55:31.234 --> 00:55:31.595]  I was like,
[00:55:32.435 --> 00:55:33.116]  Yeah, maybe.
[00:55:33.116 --> 00:55:36.218]  I was like, I don't want to have a broken foot for the rest of my life.
[00:55:36.218 --> 00:55:39.340]  And I'm sick and tired of my ACL being torn and not fixed.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:42.503]  The VA will completely ignore me and never even see me.
[00:55:42.503 --> 00:55:44.444]  And what was that, a shrapnel on the foot?
[00:55:44.444 --> 00:55:45.485]  Uh, the foot?
[00:55:45.485 --> 00:55:47.406]  Yeah, but the knee was in a rollover.
[00:55:47.406 --> 00:55:52.070]  The vehicle got hit and rolled over and my foot got caught in the gas pedal.
[00:55:52.070 --> 00:55:53.531]  By hit, you mean IED'd?
[00:55:53.531 --> 00:55:57.954]  Yeah, and got yanked and it stuck in there and I'm bouncing around and it ripped my leg out.
[00:55:58.835 --> 00:56:00.876]  So, that was painful.
[00:56:00.876 --> 00:56:01.817]  And it's still painful.
[00:56:01.817 --> 00:56:03.138]  Every day.
[00:56:03.138 --> 00:56:04.799]  And they won't give you treatment?
[00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:05.319]  They don't care.
[00:56:05.319 --> 00:56:18.287]  They just want to, they go, uh, alright, so, we just did your x-rays, we see that your ACL's torn, that's gotta be painful, there's a lot of scar tissue in there, here's a whole bunch of drugs, uh, we'll try to make another appointment for you in the next few days.
[00:56:18.287 --> 00:56:19.408]  Can you go back and do the same thing?
[00:56:19.808 --> 00:56:22.449]  Well, I get a call and then the appointment's six months down the road.
[00:56:22.449 --> 00:56:25.611]  And then I get about a week out from that six months finally waiting.
[00:56:25.611 --> 00:56:27.531]  They go, yeah, we're gonna have to reschedule that.
[00:56:27.531 --> 00:56:30.213]  This doctor, he's been transferred to another location.
[00:56:30.213 --> 00:56:37.196]  You're gonna have to go back through the process again, be reevaluated by another doctor, and then we'll look into it from there.
[00:56:37.196 --> 00:56:40.317]  So then I have to go back through the whole process again, waiting another six months.
[00:56:40.317 --> 00:56:42.598]  Then it gets there, and then they cancel it and move it, and then it never happens.
[00:56:43.138 --> 00:56:43.779]  Unbelievable.
[00:56:43.779 --> 00:56:46.143]  Well, they're not getting our guns one way or another.
[00:56:46.143 --> 00:56:48.146]  They may want to start a civil war and come for them.
[00:56:48.146 --> 00:56:51.791]  Obama's announced they're coming after the guns to announce that at the start of the show, but you already know that.
[00:56:51.791 --> 00:56:52.592]  Joe, thank you, brother.
[00:56:52.592 --> 00:56:53.934]  You'll be on the Nightly News tonight.
[00:56:53.934 --> 00:56:55.236]  Great job to you and the crew.
[00:56:55.236 --> 00:56:56.778]  I had fun last night, by the way.
[00:56:56.778 --> 00:56:56.919]  Oh, yeah.
[00:56:58.268 --> 00:57:00.150]  All right, folks.
[00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:06.895]  We've got the Pentagon's brain coming on, an uncensored history of DARPA, America's top secret military research agency.
[00:57:06.895 --> 00:57:11.960]  It's not America's, it's the eugenicist, globalist top secret research agency now.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.681]  So we're going to be getting into that.
[00:57:13.681 --> 00:57:20.627]  And then we got Peter Schiff joining us on the economy, because there's been big developments on the numbers, the economy numbers coming on.
[00:57:20.627 --> 00:57:25.211]  Even the Cook numbers are bad, so we'll be breaking that down, just being honest about what's happening, these potholes coming up.
[00:57:27.392 --> 00:57:34.535]  I was going to just let everybody know that we have a lot of products back in stock that have been sold out.

[00:57:57.601 --> 00:58:04.023]  But if you actually do this cleanse, in my experience, just for myself, you've heard the callers, the reviews are

[01:00:21.717 --> 01:00:24.599]  Peter Schiff's coming up in the third hour.
[01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:26.600]  Been really accurate on his predictions.
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.082]  A record 94,610,000 Americans not in the labor force.
[01:00:31.082 --> 01:00:32.782]  Dissipation rate lowest in 77.
[01:00:34.603 --> 01:00:39.005]  Record 56 million women not working.
[01:00:39.005 --> 01:00:42.046]  How's that being married to the state working out for you?
[01:00:42.046 --> 01:00:44.387]  Jobs up only for immigrants.
[01:00:44.387 --> 01:00:47.828]  Down 262,000 for native-borns.
[01:00:47.828 --> 01:00:50.630]  Payrolls is a disaster going down.
[01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:52.971]  Fed never going to raise rates.
[01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:53.511]  It's ugly.
[01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:55.532]  We have a flashback.
[01:00:55.532 --> 01:00:56.472]  They were saying how great it would be.
[01:00:56.472 --> 01:00:58.653]  That's some of the stories up at DrugsReport.com.
[01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:03.918]  Not a happy face under the New World Order.
[01:01:03.918 --> 01:01:06.180]  Meanwhile, I saw the headline on InfoWars.
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.681]  I got the story right here.
[01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:13.045]  Colorado College bans the words, Lord, God, and Jesus.
[01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:14.326]  Just don't say them.
[01:01:14.326 --> 01:01:15.267]  Don't write them.
[01:01:15.267 --> 01:01:16.848]  It's hurtful to other people.
[01:01:16.848 --> 01:01:18.609]  Just like the word father or mother is hurtful.
[01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:19.970]  You don't have a father or mother.
[01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.251]  It's hurtful that you have one.
[01:01:21.251 --> 01:01:23.393]  See, the ultimate collectivism.
[01:01:23.393 --> 01:01:25.254]  It's like, you have two legs.
[01:01:25.254 --> 01:01:26.415]  We have to chop them off.
[01:01:26.415 --> 01:01:27.496]  Somebody else is upset.
[01:01:30.851 --> 01:01:34.433]  Tell ya, that takes some Cajones, as they say, to do that.
[01:01:34.433 --> 01:01:45.440]  But, they've got, we laugh at this, they have a servile population that waits every day as, like, religious cult fervor.
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:57.808]  MKUltra, like Pavlovian, Skinnerian service to the establishment, and just whatever the latest cutting-edge vomit is that comes out of the establishment's mouth, they just lick it all up.
[01:01:59.463 --> 01:02:02.624]  Oh, it's so poisonous.
[01:02:02.624 --> 01:02:04.524]  Oh, it's meant to destroy me.
[01:02:04.524 --> 01:02:05.684]  Thank you.
[01:02:05.684 --> 01:02:07.645]  Oh, you hate me.
[01:02:07.645 --> 01:02:11.906]  Oh, thank you for screwing me over and wanting to destroy my free will.
[01:02:11.906 --> 01:02:13.206]  Oh, you're so anti-liberal.
[01:02:13.206 --> 01:02:14.066]  I love you.
[01:02:14.066 --> 01:02:17.067]  Oh, that's why we call you liberal because everything's a deception with you people.
[01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.607]  Oh, thank you for your tyranny.
[01:02:18.607 --> 01:02:20.207]  Oh, it's so loving.
[01:02:20.207 --> 01:02:24.328]  Those who hammer their guns into plowshares will plow for those who do not.
[01:02:24.328 --> 01:02:27.169]  Founder of the Democratic Party, Thomas Jefferson.
[01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:30.317]  But what do you people even know?
[01:02:30.317 --> 01:02:31.358]  You don't know anything.
[01:02:31.358 --> 01:02:36.863]  You don't know who your daddy or your mommy was, or your greedy greedy granny that goes beep beep beep down Sesame Street.
[01:02:36.863 --> 01:02:40.106]  You don't know your head from a hole in the ground.
[01:02:40.106 --> 01:02:50.075]  All you know how to do is to be cowardly, pathetic failures who love it, and who want to make us join you in your servile weakness.
[01:02:50.075 --> 01:02:51.176]  Well, no thanks.
[01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:54.171]  You're like heavyweight.
[01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:58.113]  I've got a squat or I've got a bench or I've got a deadlift or I've got a cling.
[01:02:58.113 --> 01:02:59.654]  You're like a mountain I've got to climb.
[01:02:59.654 --> 01:03:01.415]  You're there as an obstacle.
[01:03:01.415 --> 01:03:12.282]  Your weakness, your giant piles of fraud, your lies, your deception, your disdain for humanity, your hatred, your greediness, your insolence is nothing but an obstacle to make me strong.
[01:03:12.282 --> 01:03:13.603]  You understand that?
[01:03:13.603 --> 01:03:16.365]  You're an inanimate dead object.
[01:03:16.365 --> 01:03:18.906]  Like a boulder that I'm going to climb.
[01:03:18.906 --> 01:03:20.607]  And I'm going to climb you.
[01:03:20.607 --> 01:03:21.728]  And I'm going to make it past you.
[01:03:23.476 --> 01:03:29.260]  And you're not going to stop us in our long march to humanity's ultimate destiny.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.602]  Oh, you never thought about an ultimate destiny?
[01:03:31.602 --> 01:03:33.243]  You don't like things like that.
[01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:35.365]  People want destinies.
[01:03:35.365 --> 01:03:37.287]  People want to do big things.
[01:03:37.287 --> 01:03:39.528]  I hate myself, so I hate you.
[01:03:39.528 --> 01:03:45.333]  And I'm going to project it on you, and I'm going to screw up your life.
[01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:46.654]  Yeah, go ahead and try then.
[01:03:50.242 --> 01:03:53.644]  You were forged by your God to be weak.
[01:03:53.644 --> 01:03:56.645]  I wasn't made that way.
[01:03:56.645 --> 01:04:03.408]  And as weak as I am, because believe me, I'm only flesh and blood, I am transcendent compared to you people.
[01:04:03.408 --> 01:04:04.728]  I've already won.
[01:04:04.728 --> 01:04:12.692]  Thank Jesus Christ for that one.
[01:04:12.692 --> 01:04:18.655]  One of the devil's biggest tricks is selling the idea that Satanism gives you free will and empowerment.
[01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:19.155]  No, it doesn't.
[01:04:20.396 --> 01:04:22.076]  Christ gives you power.
[01:04:22.076 --> 01:04:23.557]  Christ gives you will.
[01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:24.997]  Christ gives you strength.
[01:04:24.997 --> 01:04:41.980]  And the churches, on purpose, sell this image of an incredibly weak Christ figure so that you don't understand the power that it took to lay down to all that weakness and that patheticness to a bunch of bugs.
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:43.621]  That was strength.
[01:04:43.621 --> 01:04:44.961]  That was honor.
[01:04:44.961 --> 01:04:45.601]  That was will.
[01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:50.916]  And to take on, at the same time, all of our weakness.
[01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:52.879]  And then to transcend it.
[01:04:52.879 --> 01:04:55.923]  That's the great animating contest.
[01:04:55.923 --> 01:04:58.307]  And we're only a shadow, an expression of that same journey.
[01:04:59.321 --> 01:05:01.142]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[01:05:01.142 --> 01:05:06.325]  Now, armed Air Force vet was prevented from stopping Oregon gunman, article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:05:06.325 --> 01:05:15.210]  An Air Force veteran who had a licensed concealed carry gun was prevented by staff from intervening in the shooting yesterday at the Oregon Community College during which 10 people were killed.
[01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:19.212]  John Parker was situated in a building about 200 yards away from where the shooting began.
[01:05:19.212 --> 01:05:22.674]  There were a few people in the vet center and then we heard the shooting happen.
[01:05:22.674 --> 01:05:25.135]  We got up and we were going to go over and see what we could do.
[01:05:25.515 --> 01:05:28.897]  Immediately, the school staff stopped us and told us to get inside of the building.
[01:05:28.897 --> 01:05:31.559]  Essentially, the staff wouldn't let us go to assist.
[01:05:31.559 --> 01:05:37.783]  One courageous man who also tried to apprehend the shooter, Army veteran Chris Mintz, ended up being shot five times.
[01:05:37.783 --> 01:05:39.044]  Mintz was unarmed.
[01:05:39.044 --> 01:05:45.328]  In asserting his right to concealed carry, Parker was knownly violating a rule which declared the college to be a gun-free zone.
[01:05:45.328 --> 01:05:48.851]  This is why we need to arm our students.
[01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:55.235]  I guarantee you, the students in Oregon wish they had the ability to be able to defend themselves and those around them.

[01:08:02.091 --> 01:08:08.736]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.736 --> 01:08:11.699]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:27.962]  You know, I have mixed feelings about the next hour.
[01:08:27.962 --> 01:08:39.306]  Because I've studied DARPA, the government's advanced research laboratories, the Defense Department's advanced research programs.
[01:08:39.306 --> 01:08:47.009]  Eisenhower in 1961, when he gave his farewell address, we've played the full 21 minute address here many times.
[01:08:47.009 --> 01:08:49.710]  We've played the clip, in fact we ought to cue it up, where he talks about
[01:08:50.686 --> 01:09:16.725]  A technological elite in control of the military industrial complex creating a breakaway civilization and using these super advanced technologies to basically build back doors into all of the culture and society to create a brain trust that did not deploy that knowledge to the general public but kept it to itself as a way to gain total hegemonic power.
[01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:20.911]  I haven't read this book yet.
[01:09:20.911 --> 01:09:27.696]  I just got it a few days ago, scanned over it this morning, looked at some of the pictures, read the synopsis, read the reviews.
[01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:29.077]  I've read some of the articles about it.
[01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:46.329]  And let me tell you, this weekend, when I go to the local pool with my kids, I'm going to be trying to sneak in an hour or so while they're swimming and fighting with each other or whatever, over floats, fighting friendly, trying to read this, because
[01:09:48.075 --> 01:09:49.156]  It's important.
[01:09:49.156 --> 01:09:52.818]  And you know, this show, we get into all this, we research it, we think we know it all.
[01:09:52.818 --> 01:09:58.002]  You read it all together, because I've already started reading it, it's just, you learn a lot from it.
[01:09:58.002 --> 01:10:00.364]  Because this is the real world.
[01:10:00.364 --> 01:10:08.109]  I mean, you think secret government programs ended with the Manhattan Project and the A-bomb, I will assure you that was just the beginning of the shadow government.
[01:10:08.109 --> 01:10:10.011]  And the National Security Act and the rest of it.
[01:10:10.011 --> 01:10:13.113]  I'll never forget, it was in the Baltimore Sun, I've talked about this many times,
[01:10:15.735 --> 01:10:24.739]  Like 18 years ago, and they talked about DARPA practicing, just testing in major cities through cell towers, putting out calming waves for the public.
[01:10:24.739 --> 01:10:35.524]  Now, usually it's schizophrenics that have had heavy metal toxification, that they're not actually under cell phone tower control, but I'd always heard that from people, and then they're always reading it in the paper, and I'm like, what is this?
[01:10:35.524 --> 01:10:38.406]  Is this something to condition me, to get me ready for this?
[01:10:38.406 --> 01:10:40.987]  So how deep does the rabbit hole really go?
[01:10:41.954 --> 01:10:46.755]  We're not selling this book, but it is a great pitch I'm giving it.
[01:10:46.755 --> 01:10:52.817]  The Pentagon's Brain and Uncensored History of DARPA, America's top secret military research agency.
[01:10:52.817 --> 01:10:59.358]  Annie Jacobson, author of the New York Times bestseller, Area 51 and Operation Paperclip.
[01:10:59.358 --> 01:11:10.941]  You know, I knew about Operation Paperclip, and I'm going to go to our guest, when I was about six or seven and my grandfather would be sitting there around his round kitchen table
[01:11:11.926 --> 01:11:19.708]  Talking about reentry devices and MIRV technology and space bases and Werner Von Braun and all the rest of it.
[01:11:19.708 --> 01:11:24.109]  And he would talk about damn Nazis because he was in World War II a pilot.
[01:11:24.109 --> 01:11:29.731]  And how he would, in Texas, go to these military bases when he was doing work for
[01:11:31.567 --> 01:11:34.028]  DARPA, I've never been told all of it.
[01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:36.470]  It was basically crowd control robots and stuff.
[01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:38.511]  It was secret.
[01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:44.834]  And he would just talk about how much he hated Nazis because he got out of whatever it was because it was Nazis that he would run into.
[01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:48.416]  And I remember sitting around and my mom would be like, he's a little eccentric.
[01:11:48.416 --> 01:11:49.917]  My dad would be like, no, he's not eccentric.
[01:11:49.917 --> 01:11:51.218]  Your grandfather's really smart.
[01:11:51.218 --> 01:11:53.619]  But imagine you're six, seven years old hearing about Nazis at U.S.
[01:11:53.619 --> 01:11:54.680]  military bases.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.981]  Believe me, it'll get your attention.
[01:11:58.945 --> 01:12:05.491]  But, that said, let's now move on to our guest, the Pentagon's brain, Annie Jacobson.
[01:12:05.491 --> 01:12:06.973]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:12:06.973 --> 01:12:08.614]  Congratulations on your new book.
[01:12:08.614 --> 01:12:10.236]  Oh wow, where does this start?
[01:12:10.236 --> 01:12:12.618]  I mean, where should we go talking about something as big as DARPA?
[01:12:14.224 --> 01:12:17.267]  Well, thank you so much for having me, and I loved that intro.
[01:12:17.267 --> 01:12:18.469]  Fascinating about the Nazis.
[01:12:18.469 --> 01:12:19.750]  So how about we start right there?
[01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:23.114]  How about I tell you a fascinating story about Nazis and DARPA?
[01:12:23.114 --> 01:12:25.236]  Let's do it!
[01:12:25.236 --> 01:12:31.603]  Okay, so the way I got interested in this book in the first place, I was finishing up my Operation Paperclip Nazi Scientist book.
[01:12:32.383 --> 01:12:35.205]  And I learned that there was a new agent.
[01:12:35.205 --> 01:12:42.030]  I was wondering what von Braun was doing in the 50s after he had kind of settled in and was building rockets for the government.
[01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:51.276]  And I learned that he was the first choice in 1958 for this brand new agency at the Pentagon called, it was then called ARPA.
[01:12:51.276 --> 01:12:52.297]  Now we know it as DARPA.
[01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:53.070]  Wow.
[01:13:21.181 --> 01:13:26.264]  And then they spun off and sent him over to NASA, I guess, and then he brought in Goddard and everybody else.
[01:13:26.264 --> 01:13:26.924]  Yes, yes.
[01:13:26.924 --> 01:13:33.748]  But here's another little Nazi link you might enjoy, which is that, you know, you spoke of the military-industrial complex.
[01:13:33.748 --> 01:13:36.070]  You've run Eisenhower's speech.
[01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:47.937]  So, specifically, Herb York, that chief scientist of DARPA, first chief scientist, wanted to know, he was troubled, he said in his memoirs, to whom Eisenhower was referring specifically.
[01:13:48.507 --> 01:14:00.379]  So when Eisenhower retired, Herb York went to go see him at Eisenhower's home here in the California desert, and got him to say who specifically it was he was afraid of.
[01:14:00.379 --> 01:14:06.865]  And the two people he named were Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb, and Wernher von Braun.
[01:14:09.468 --> 01:14:13.349]  Wow, so much of our world has been shaped by these people.
[01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:14.789]  It's just mind-boggling.
[01:14:14.789 --> 01:14:16.089]  That's why I can't wait to read your book.
[01:14:16.089 --> 01:14:20.590]  I'm greedily looking at it like it's a big cake I want to carve into.
[01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:25.011]  Accelerating into what got a lot of news, you were talking about DARPA and brain chips and troops.
[01:14:25.011 --> 01:14:26.771]  Tell us about that.
[01:14:26.771 --> 01:14:28.591]  Yes.
[01:14:28.591 --> 01:14:32.592]  So much of this book I wrote is really about man and machine.
[01:14:32.592 --> 01:14:34.712]  Man's relationship with machines.
[01:14:34.712 --> 01:14:38.793]  As we came out of World War II, technology just takes off.
[01:14:39.625 --> 01:14:56.188]  And when you get to the end of the book, you learn about this new future idea, which is actually very much part of the present, but is accelerating us into the future, which is the Pentagon, specifically DARPA's plan to couple man and machine.
[01:14:56.188 --> 01:15:01.669]  So that science fiction idea of cyborgs is now becoming a reality at the Pentagon.
[01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:04.569]  And by the way, this is all dogma.
[01:15:04.569 --> 01:15:07.650]  These are, you know, I pull quotes out of Pentagon
[01:15:08.619 --> 01:15:15.523]  Unclassified reports that talk about, we must accelerate our artificial intelligence weapon system.
[01:15:15.523 --> 01:15:20.026]  We must take advantage of this new brain technology.
[01:15:20.026 --> 01:15:25.749]  The Pentagon calls it neuroprosthetics, but you or I might call it brain chips.
[01:15:25.749 --> 01:15:34.695]  And those are the plans to begin these, and they are beginning these clinical trials, where soldiers who have come back from Iraq and Afghanistan
[01:15:35.659 --> 01:15:37.000]  With cognitive impairment.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.121]  They're called brain-wounded warriors by the Pentagon.
[01:15:40.121 --> 01:15:54.109]  There's 300,000 of them who came home from those wars and in the clinical trials where they are now, they're putting these brain chips into the soft tissue of the brain to restore cognitive functioning.
[01:15:54.109 --> 01:15:55.329]  That's the plan.
[01:15:55.329 --> 01:16:00.332]  But what I also found in interviewing, for example, the Jason scientist, that
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:10.624]  The Pentagon is being advised this is not a good idea, and this is a direct quote, because it could lead to high-quality brain control.
[01:16:10.624 --> 01:16:12.664]  Wow.
[01:16:12.664 --> 01:16:13.325]  Direct quote.
[01:16:13.325 --> 01:16:17.706]  That is not Annie Jacobson's idea about what might happen.
[01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:21.908]  That's the Jason scientists who, by the way, have been advising DARPA
[01:16:23.163 --> 01:16:24.064]  Since 1960.
[01:16:24.064 --> 01:16:26.184]  I interviewed Murph Goldberger for the book.
[01:16:26.184 --> 01:16:30.146]  He was the co-founder of the Jason Scientist, and he just died.
[01:16:30.146 --> 01:16:40.089]  But he shared with me a lot of fascinating information about, you know, advising DARPA about what weapon systems to design over the decades.
[01:16:40.089 --> 01:16:42.850]  And then there were other futures depending on like Marshall and others.
[01:16:42.850 --> 01:16:44.551]  I want to try to walk through some of those, but...
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:51.184]  My issue with it is it's like Volkswagen putting cheating software on their emissions testing.
[01:16:51.184 --> 01:16:53.446]  The problem is my uncle was in a motorcycle accident.
[01:16:53.446 --> 01:16:55.787]  He has epilepsy from it.
[01:16:55.787 --> 01:16:58.289]  They gave him a brain chip and a stimulator.
[01:16:58.289 --> 01:17:00.330]  It's really helped his quality of life.
[01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:01.011]  I'm all for it.
[01:17:01.011 --> 01:17:02.032]  I'm not against technology.
[01:17:02.032 --> 01:17:15.061]  The problem is these companies and corporations always want to piggyback something into it and it's so complex that how do you stop Trojan horses or how do you stop hacks once we start taking brain chips?
[01:17:16.503 --> 01:17:18.644]  Well, absolutely, and this is the heart of the matter.
[01:17:18.644 --> 01:17:24.265]  It's the double-edged sword of these military systems that DARPA creates.
[01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:29.687]  Yes, there are these amazing benefits that make their way into the population.
[01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:30.047]  Like the Internet!
[01:17:30.047 --> 01:17:31.628]  Like your uncle.
[01:17:31.628 --> 01:17:33.408]  Yes, and also like your uncle's brain chip.
[01:17:33.408 --> 01:17:37.450]  I mean, every side has two sides, in essence.
[01:17:37.450 --> 01:17:41.751]  But here's the thing, is that that which keeps you safe can also harm you.
[01:17:41.751 --> 01:17:45.472]  And so, for me, just as a journalist, I mean, my job is to inform the public.
[01:17:46.081 --> 01:17:57.509]  And so, it's like, and I love that you play Eisenhower's speech, because he says in that second part of his military-industrial complex speech, you know, these two ideas can live together.
[01:17:57.509 --> 01:17:59.751]  You can have a very strong military.
[01:17:59.751 --> 01:18:02.953]  You can have a necessary national defense.
[01:18:02.953 --> 01:18:09.137]  But it must be in balance with what he calls an alert and knowledgeable citizenry.
[01:18:09.137 --> 01:18:10.118]  And there's the rub.
[01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:15.742]  That's why people, it behooves them to know about these programs.
[01:18:16.004 --> 01:18:20.227]  These are not, you know, things of science fiction novels.
[01:18:20.227 --> 01:18:28.693]  Look, the DARPA director said just the other day at the Aspen Conference, everything is science fiction until it becomes real.
[01:18:28.693 --> 01:18:29.074]  It is!
[01:18:29.074 --> 01:18:32.496]  Everything is magic until it becomes real.
[01:18:32.496 --> 01:18:39.502]  Yes, and the thing is that DARPA, because their job is to create revolution in military affairs.
[01:18:39.502 --> 01:18:40.542]  Think about that word.
[01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:45.346]  I mean, a revolution is not a revolution if there's not an element of surprise.
[01:18:45.848 --> 01:18:50.490]  And so, DARPA is working on weapon systems 20, 25 years out.
[01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:51.450]  They invented stealth.
[01:18:51.450 --> 01:18:55.111]  I mean, they didn't invent it, but they're scientists created stealth.
[01:18:55.111 --> 01:19:03.254]  And then when stealth was unveiled during the Gulf War, you know, it took the enemy by surprise.
[01:19:03.254 --> 01:19:06.195]  So what's the, what is DARPA doing now?
[01:19:06.195 --> 01:19:13.157]  And when I show you in the book what DARPA is doing that's unclassified, that I was able to report on from interviewing scientists,
[01:19:13.766 --> 01:19:15.327]  You get to decide for yourself.
[01:19:15.327 --> 01:19:19.030]  Okay, so what is really going on?
[01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:20.411]  Well, I can't wait to read the book.
[01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:22.092]  I'm going to come back from break.
[01:19:22.092 --> 01:19:24.713]  I want to just talk about what you think are some of the most important parts of the book.
[01:19:24.713 --> 01:19:28.976]  It is a big book, a lot of photos, a lot of diagrams, a lot of information.
[01:19:28.976 --> 01:19:31.158]  And, you know, for me, this is the real world.
[01:19:31.158 --> 01:19:33.519]  People talk about sports icons, Hollywood.
[01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:41.445]  It's all really boring when you realize that what we see with DARPA is only the tip of the iceberg of a giant, submerged,
[01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:51.309]  Shadow technological system and as you said the stealth technology was 25-30 years old when they rolled it out in 1987-1988.

[01:21:47.141 --> 01:21:49.902]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[01:22:02.828 --> 01:22:03.449]  It's true.
[01:22:03.449 --> 01:22:07.613]  Some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[01:22:07.613 --> 01:22:09.995]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[01:22:09.995 --> 01:22:14.779]  But with a trusted Big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[01:22:14.779 --> 01:22:27.371]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.

[01:22:59.272 --> 01:23:01.073]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowitz.
[01:23:01.073 --> 01:23:03.615]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:23:03.615 --> 01:23:07.477]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic pickpocketing.
[01:23:07.477 --> 01:23:16.283]  Ten years ago, I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip called RFID.
[01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:19.565]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:23:20.425 --> 01:23:23.567]  Soon after, it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S.
[01:23:23.567 --> 01:23:28.950]  passports, hotel room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:33.872]  It was then I formed IDStronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with the world.
[01:23:33.872 --> 01:23:37.034]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:23:37.034 --> 01:23:40.115]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:23:40.115 --> 01:23:46.359]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallets, sleeves, or badge holders you need to protect your personal financial data.
[01:23:47.139 --> 01:23:52.742]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[01:23:52.742 --> 01:23:55.123]  It is as though the protection is free.
[01:23:55.123 --> 01:23:56.744]  Visit IDStronghold.com today.
[01:24:06.238 --> 01:24:07.358]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:24:07.358 --> 01:24:13.661]  Alex Jones here, broadcasting live on this Friday, the second day of October, 2015 broadcast.
[01:24:13.661 --> 01:24:17.002]  I'll be back this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:24:17.002 --> 01:24:22.323]  Central, with the abbreviated two-hour live original broadcast as well.
[01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:29.626]  The Pentagon's brain, an uncensored history of DARPA, America's top secret military research agency, Annie Jacobson is our guest.
[01:24:30.916 --> 01:24:46.019]  And Gerald Posner, author of God's Bankers, said Annie Jacobson's considerable talents as an investigative journalist prove indispensable in uncovering the remarkable history of one of America's most powerful and clandestine military research agencies.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:55.382]  And she is a great storyteller, making the tantalizing tale of the Pentagon's brain from the depths of the Cold War to the present day, come alive on every page.
[01:24:55.382 --> 01:25:04.523]  You know, you've been nice, and kind of let me lead the interview at first, but you're the expert on this, and obviously the expert on your book.
[01:25:04.523 --> 01:25:05.884]  You heard my point going into break.
[01:25:05.884 --> 01:25:08.204]  I mean, this is a shadow government.
[01:25:08.204 --> 01:25:11.825]  It did basically become what Eisenhower warned about to a certain extent.
[01:25:13.406 --> 01:25:25.832]  And I think that adds the arrogance of Washington, because imagine what they've got they're not telling us about, but at a certain point, still it's just humans that are running this whole thing.
[01:25:25.832 --> 01:25:29.094]  Yes, shall I tell you about one of the spooky programs?
[01:25:29.094 --> 01:25:29.654]  Yes, please.
[01:25:29.654 --> 01:25:40.560]  Okay, so we were talking about coupling man and machine, that's the goal for the future, but DARPA is already able to create what they call bio-hybrids.
[01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:47.121]  That is their actual term for it, and it's like part animal, part machine.
[01:25:47.121 --> 01:25:52.665]  And this is now 12, 13 years old, this program, the success of it.
[01:25:52.665 --> 01:25:57.608]  So back in 2002, they had their first public success.
[01:25:57.608 --> 01:26:02.111]  DARPA scientists wired up a rat's brain.
[01:26:02.111 --> 01:26:06.854]  These were like with tiny wires the size of human hairs connected to electrodes.
[01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:14.217]  And also connected to a microprocessor that was sewn into the rat's back, like a backpack.
[01:26:14.217 --> 01:26:22.459]  Then from 500 meters away, the scientists remotely controlled this rat through a maze, okay?
[01:26:22.459 --> 01:26:31.722]  And this process has been ongoing of coupling more animals with machines, and just last year, DARPA scientists did the same thing with a moth.
[01:26:31.722 --> 01:26:36.063]  So they inserted the electrodes, these neuroprosthetics,
[01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.910]  Thank you.
[01:27:06.843 --> 01:27:08.844]  So it was like a short experiment.
[01:27:08.844 --> 01:27:16.146]  But you can see this movement toward being able to control humans in the same manner.
[01:27:16.146 --> 01:27:20.007]  Absolutely, it's the end of free will.
[01:27:20.007 --> 01:27:21.628]  You know, if you sign up for it.
[01:27:21.628 --> 01:27:23.328]  I mean, and I think that's the rub.
[01:27:23.328 --> 01:27:33.872]  I think that there's a lot to be said about being aware of how these military applications, you know, are or not are not appropriate.
[01:27:33.872 --> 01:27:34.952]  The government calls it
[01:27:36.072 --> 01:27:37.473]  The super soldier program.
[01:27:37.473 --> 01:27:38.375]  I mean that's what it is.
[01:27:38.375 --> 01:27:42.580]  Giving war fighters enhanced cognition.
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:44.603]  Enhanced physiology.
[01:27:44.603 --> 01:27:48.208]  Sure, we all know there's governors lifting weights or marching.
[01:27:48.208 --> 01:27:50.391]  They can just flip a switch and you can march a hundred miles.
[01:27:52.986 --> 01:28:00.991]  Or you can wear the super suit, which by the way, DARPA has teamed up with special forces now to create this TALOS super suit.
[01:28:00.991 --> 01:28:02.852]  I mean it has, you know, it does everything.
[01:28:02.852 --> 01:28:06.955]  It even has like blood hemorrhage control mechanisms inside of it.
[01:28:06.955 --> 01:28:09.676]  Good God!
[01:28:09.676 --> 01:28:15.440]  But you have to ask yourself, where it's really going toward is a concept called transhumanism.
[01:28:15.914 --> 01:28:22.856]  This idea, and people who are pro-transhumanism believe that it's actually a good idea, that why not?
[01:28:22.856 --> 01:28:34.218]  Why shouldn't man, with all his intelligence, all his technology, all his science, be able to kind of control his own evolution by merging himself with machines?
[01:28:34.218 --> 01:28:36.679]  But of course, many other people think this is a really bad idea.
[01:28:37.298 --> 01:28:48.143]  Well, I'm not against it in general, but the elite we have basically sheep-dipped eugenics, as you know, at the end of World War II, because Hitler gave it a bad name, and turned it into transhumanism.
[01:28:48.143 --> 01:28:53.086]  I'm not saying transhumanists are all eugenicists, but that's what it came from.
[01:28:53.086 --> 01:28:58.328]  Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, at the UN wrote papers admitting all this.
[01:28:58.328 --> 01:29:04.031]  So, my problem is, a lot of the elite want to use this for population control, not to empower people.
[01:29:04.691 --> 01:29:13.535]  And so I don't see us being given a choice, as Ray Kurzweil says, well you may not be augmented, but you'll be like a bug, basically.
[01:29:13.535 --> 01:29:17.116]  I mean, look, this is definitely something worth discussing.
[01:29:17.116 --> 01:29:27.520]  I think that's the whole point, is that, you know, just to kind of like ignore it all is a bit like putting your head in the sand like an ostrich and leaving your neck exposed.
[01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.581]  I mean, you want you, people,
[01:29:30.248 --> 01:29:33.350]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:33.350 --> 01:29:35.471]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.466 --> 01:30:00.687]  Selective outrage.
[01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:04.630]  Obama hasn't said a damn word about routine mass shootings in Chicago.
[01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:14.777]  Following the mass shooting in Oregon Thursday, the president delivered a 12-minute tirade about the need for stricter gun control laws and admitted he was politicizing the incident before the body count was even in.
[01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:20.261]  When he wasn't referring to himself 28 times, a visibly angry Obama called mass shootings in the U.S.
[01:30:20.261 --> 01:30:20.721]  routine.
[01:30:21.181 --> 01:30:23.303]  Somehow this has become routine, Obama said.
[01:30:23.303 --> 01:30:25.944]  My response here at this podium has become routine.
[01:30:25.944 --> 01:30:31.208]  And what becomes routine is the response from those who oppose any sort of gun control legislation.
[01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:33.489]  Hey Obama, leave the guns alone!
[01:30:33.489 --> 01:30:37.792]  Stop trying to disarm people who are law-abiding citizens who want
[01:30:37.912 --> 01:30:38.472]  We're good to go.
[01:30:59.244 --> 01:31:04.386]  Introducing Secret 12, the new InfoWarsLife vitamin B12 formulation.

[01:33:08.971 --> 01:33:13.874]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:33:13.874 --> 01:33:19.618]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:19.618 --> 01:33:26.762]  I've thought about this probably more deeply than any other subject because it is the subject.
[01:33:26.762 --> 01:33:32.686]  Shadow government, shadow technology, super technology, super science that was science fiction is now reality.
[01:33:34.389 --> 01:33:51.464]  And just from my own family experiences with my grandfather and then some other members of the family, I know there are huge secret government programs going on that are way more 20, 30, 40, 50 years in advance, depending on the science of what we even know about.
[01:33:53.647 --> 01:33:59.830]  And we understand that from television and so many of these other technologies, it's dumbing us down.
[01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:02.050]  Our physical IQ is dropping.
[01:34:02.050 --> 01:34:09.974]  So that's not just the nurture, it's the nature as well.
[01:34:09.974 --> 01:34:14.916]  Humanity is falling apart in many respects.
[01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:18.037]  And so the answers to our future could be in the technology.
[01:34:18.037 --> 01:34:23.079]  The problem is elites are very predatory on average, historically, and they're using it to control.
[01:34:26.798 --> 01:34:34.681]  And everything they're doing is about ending free will and making us take what the government wants into our bodies, i.e.
[01:34:34.681 --> 01:34:35.682]  vaccines.
[01:34:35.682 --> 01:34:39.483]  They act like we're against vaccine technology because we're just ignorant hillbillies.
[01:34:39.483 --> 01:34:47.547]  No, we know about all the recalls, the problems, the additives, the immunity of the vaccine makers, the fact they want to make a hundred and something vaccines mandatory.
[01:34:48.547 --> 01:34:51.009]  We know it's linked to major problems.
[01:34:51.009 --> 01:34:53.711]  And then they just sell this thing of, it's science, take it.
[01:34:53.711 --> 01:34:55.493]  And GMO, it's science, eat it.
[01:34:55.493 --> 01:34:55.773]  Oh, really?
[01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:56.754]  I got all these studies.
[01:34:56.754 --> 01:34:57.735]  Shut up and take it.
[01:34:57.735 --> 01:34:59.716]  You know, glyphosate never hurt anybody.
[01:34:59.716 --> 01:35:00.657]  You can drink it.
[01:35:00.657 --> 01:35:01.938]  Okay, lobbyists, drink it.
[01:35:01.938 --> 01:35:06.582]  I'm not going to drink that.
[01:35:06.582 --> 01:35:11.005]  So that's my problem, is so many of these corporate leaders are delusional.
[01:35:11.943 --> 01:35:13.484]  They're on power trips.
[01:35:13.484 --> 01:35:15.045]  They're narcissistic.
[01:35:15.045 --> 01:35:19.807]  And who wouldn't be with billions of dollars in helicopters and all the power you want?
[01:35:19.807 --> 01:35:22.448]  And hey, I get a Manhattan Project to live forever.
[01:35:22.448 --> 01:35:23.589]  That's really what this is.
[01:35:23.589 --> 01:35:26.090]  The Manhattan Project for eternal life.
[01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:36.375]  They're just using the Pentagon and all of these operations as the focused, compartmentalized template to siphon off the goodies.
[01:35:36.375 --> 01:35:38.156]  And what happens when they do
[01:35:39.346 --> 01:35:39.767]  I think so.
[01:35:55.026 --> 01:35:56.607]  The ones that'll talk to me?
[01:35:56.607 --> 01:35:58.347]  They say, yeah, you're right.
[01:35:58.347 --> 01:36:02.668]  When I go to these big meetings and I go to these big events, I've talked to folks that have been to Bilderberg.
[01:36:02.668 --> 01:36:07.590]  They go, we discuss, why haven't we just released a bioweapon and wiped everybody out?
[01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:10.951]  Because, you know, the profane public doesn't deserve all this.
[01:36:10.951 --> 01:36:13.612]  Only us, these ascended gods deserve it.
[01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:16.274]  So that's being discussed.
[01:36:16.274 --> 01:36:17.494]  You need to understand that.
[01:36:17.494 --> 01:36:19.756]  That's a pretty heavy talk.
[01:36:19.756 --> 01:36:21.417]  Annie Jacobson is our guest.
[01:36:21.417 --> 01:36:22.918]  AnnieJacobson.com.
[01:36:22.918 --> 01:36:25.440]  The new book, The Pentagon's Brain.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.744]  So I've set the table now and I'm going to try to give you the floor to really walk through all this.
[01:36:30.925 --> 01:36:34.186]  I've laid out my fears, my concerns, where this is going.
[01:36:34.186 --> 01:36:38.848]  The elite already kind of act like they've had some major breakthroughs and we don't exist anymore.
[01:36:38.848 --> 01:36:39.688]  They don't even really care.
[01:36:39.688 --> 01:36:41.129]  Their propaganda doesn't work anymore.
[01:36:41.129 --> 01:36:50.732]  And I'm seeing a lot of digging in, a lot of bunkers being built, a lot of elites running off that find out about this, to armored redoubts in New Zealand.
[01:36:50.732 --> 01:36:52.512]  I talked about this a decade ago.
[01:36:52.512 --> 01:36:53.273]  It's now in the news.
[01:36:54.401 --> 01:37:03.644]  Whatever the billionaires, whatever the top technicians that are given entry into this are being told, makes them cry.
[01:37:03.644 --> 01:37:09.246]  So, kind of a heavy interview, Annie, but where do you want to go with that?
[01:37:09.246 --> 01:37:16.348]  Well, let's talk about fear for a moment, and narrative, because, you know, you and I are in the same business, in essence.
[01:37:16.348 --> 01:37:18.488]  I mean, I inform the public, and so do you.
[01:37:18.488 --> 01:37:20.769]  That's the job of the journalist, okay?
[01:37:20.769 --> 01:37:23.050]  So, what I found really
[01:37:24.289 --> 01:37:27.412]  Just at the edge of sinister.
[01:37:27.412 --> 01:37:30.514]  Trying to maintain objectivity, I find that word, okay?
[01:37:30.514 --> 01:37:36.679]  So, because DARPA now has a program that has to do with trust.
[01:37:36.679 --> 01:37:51.131]  And it seems to have been born out of this idea that at the Pentagon, as the Pentagon is moving toward autonomous robots, toward hunter-killer robots, as we've been talking about, merging man and machine, merging animal and machine,
[01:37:51.624 --> 01:37:56.606]  Getting an army of drones on the battlefield that are part and parcel man-machine.
[01:37:56.606 --> 01:37:58.487]  There's been pushback inside the Pentagon.
[01:37:58.487 --> 01:38:06.971]  These are documents I refer to in the book where people from the military commanders to the drone operators say this is a bad idea.
[01:38:06.971 --> 01:38:10.373]  They mistrust the idea of coupling man and machine.
[01:38:10.373 --> 01:38:16.176]  We need to build a world for humans and not just give ourselves over to it until we know it works properly.
[01:38:17.283 --> 01:38:24.946]  Yes, and these are actually individuals inside the military establishment saying, you know, the probability and consequences of failure are too great.
[01:38:24.946 --> 01:38:25.767]  We don't want to go there.
[01:38:25.767 --> 01:38:38.972]  And so what does the Defense Science Board, so you talk about the elite, I'll tell you, the Defense Science Board is a group of elite advisors in the Pentagon that very few people have heard of, DSB.
[01:38:38.972 --> 01:38:42.833]  And they advise both the President and they advise the Pentagon.
[01:38:42.833 --> 01:38:44.734]  And the DSB looks at this idea
[01:38:45.533 --> 01:38:51.418]  Uh, about mistrusting robots, and they say, this attitude must change.
[01:38:51.418 --> 01:38:59.045]  We must have, they call unambiguously for the rapid acceleration and the development of these AI weapon systems.
[01:38:59.045 --> 01:39:00.306]  Okay, hold that thought.
[01:39:00.306 --> 01:39:09.454]  Separate from that, right around the same time, DARPA teams up with IARPA, which is the CIA's DARPA, which stands for Intelligence
[01:39:10.057 --> 01:39:12.057]  Advanced Research Projects Agency.
[01:39:12.057 --> 01:39:17.278]  And they begin a program, and this is where I talk to you about fear and about narration, narratives.
[01:39:17.278 --> 01:39:20.379]  It's called Narrative Networks, N2.
[01:39:20.379 --> 01:39:30.681]  And they're looking at how to develop techniques, this is language from them, to look at the effects of narrative on human cognition.
[01:39:30.681 --> 01:39:33.581]  To look at the effects of how people can be influenced.
[01:39:33.581 --> 01:39:36.442]  But specifically, they're looking at it through chemical means.
[01:39:36.442 --> 01:39:38.722]  And this is what I found sinister.
[01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:46.789]  There's a chemical in the brain called oxytocin, and it's often called the moral molecule.
[01:39:46.789 --> 01:39:52.030]  It's released, I'll give you an example, when a mother is breastfeeding, oxytocin is released.
[01:39:52.030 --> 01:39:56.912]  That's that ultimate bond of trust between mother and breastfeeding child, okay?
[01:39:56.912 --> 01:39:58.212]  Oxytocin.
[01:39:58.212 --> 01:40:06.114]  Well, DARPA has a program to look at oxytocin and see how it can be used in terms of trust.
[01:40:06.676 --> 01:40:20.430]  Separate from that, a researcher in Germany told Scientific American recently that she did a study injecting oxytocin in the nose of 64 men to see if she could erase fear.
[01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:22.492]  And she said that's exactly what happened.
[01:40:22.492 --> 01:40:27.757]  So you have to ask yourself, what is going on with this idea of getting rid of fear?
[01:40:29.957 --> 01:40:31.459]  Well, I've got the answer to DARPA.
[01:40:31.459 --> 01:40:40.590]  If you just get your life together and get a purpose-driven life to stand up for honor and good people, I can dose myself immediately and I have no fear knowing I'm doing it for children.
[01:40:40.590 --> 01:40:42.472]  I mean, that's why they always say it's for the children.
[01:40:42.472 --> 01:40:43.313]  It's for the children.
[01:40:43.313 --> 01:40:48.719]  They know with psych warfare terms how to get us to release that, at least people that are moral and manipulate us.
[01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:51.462]  This is so advanced.
[01:40:51.462 --> 01:40:55.526]  There's obviously chemical warfare going on through so many of the additives.
[01:40:55.526 --> 01:40:56.687]  I know you're an investigative journalist.
[01:40:56.687 --> 01:40:59.550]  You don't go off into that, but I can pull articles up and show you right now.
[01:40:59.550 --> 01:41:00.571]  You're highly informed.
[01:41:00.571 --> 01:41:02.873]  Undoubtedly, everything we're being told about is
[01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:07.072]  Super ancient in modern terms.
[01:41:07.072 --> 01:41:08.732]  You know, 10 years ago it was ancient.
[01:41:08.732 --> 01:41:19.895]  I remember seeing science papers when I was a kid, you know, laying around the house of like roaches that had silicon microchips they could control.
[01:41:19.895 --> 01:41:20.375]  Yes.
[01:41:20.375 --> 01:41:23.075]  So DARPA talks about RoboRat being 12 years old.
[01:41:23.075 --> 01:41:24.976]  That's their rollout of RoboRat.
[01:41:24.976 --> 01:41:26.116]  Yes.
[01:41:26.116 --> 01:41:27.256]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:41:27.256 --> 01:41:28.376]  You're absolutely right.
[01:41:28.376 --> 01:41:30.197]  I mean, you're talking, what is going on 10, 25,
[01:41:31.744 --> 01:41:32.785]  We're good to go.
[01:41:53.832 --> 01:42:00.754]  Most people think drones made an appearance on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2002.
[01:42:00.754 --> 01:42:14.418]  I know, my grandfather sold it, and then it was classified, but he sold a crowd control robot that he developed at Fort Hood to the Pentagon in like the 70s.
[01:42:14.418 --> 01:42:22.860]  That was part of the non-lethal weapons program, that was crowd control, that was born out of, you know, what are we going to do about these Vietnam protesters?
[01:42:24.443 --> 01:42:28.665]  Absolutely, and the Vietnam ended so they didn't buy them.
[01:42:28.665 --> 01:42:30.646]  But those non-lethal weapons have continued.
[01:42:30.646 --> 01:42:33.307]  Those really have a lot to do with crowd control.
[01:42:33.307 --> 01:42:52.875]  And they, you know, where they were developed, many of the laboratories were actually in Saigon during the war, in Thailand during the war, because it was much easier to keep them far away from the public and disguise them as if they were being used, you know, against the Viet Cong in Vietnam, when in fact,
[01:42:53.484 --> 01:42:59.467]  As I report in the book, they were actually being designed for use back home.
[01:42:59.467 --> 01:43:03.889]  I covered a story about 16, 17 years ago, the Sunshine Project out of UT.
[01:43:03.889 --> 01:43:12.533]  A professor, and this was one of the only times we actually got visited, and then they agreed to reclassify and they shut down the Sunshine Project.
[01:43:12.533 --> 01:43:19.256]  But this was drones to be used to deploy chemicals for crowd control across the United States.
[01:43:19.256 --> 01:43:20.337]  Did you ever run into anything like that?
[01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:23.542]  Well, I didn't run in.
[01:43:23.542 --> 01:43:24.302]  That's interesting.
[01:43:24.302 --> 01:43:25.924]  Drones dropping chemicals.
[01:43:25.924 --> 01:43:34.690]  I mean, I learned about them, the DARPA programs that had to do with kind of like shooting them out of cannons or conventional weapons.
[01:43:34.690 --> 01:43:43.056]  But obviously, helicopter pilots might say no to spray a hallucinogen on Austin, Texas or an opiate knockout gas.
[01:43:43.056 --> 01:43:46.679]  The problem is it causes a lot of fatalities as a car wrecks and fires and stuff like that.
[01:43:46.679 --> 01:43:48.120]  That's why they call it unethical.
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:49.021]  They keep it classified.
[01:43:49.021 --> 01:43:52.003]  But they declassified this and then they reclassified it.
[01:43:53.161 --> 01:43:58.564]  And it was, they were so threatening to us that I just said, fine.
[01:43:58.564 --> 01:43:59.624]  I'd covered it.
[01:43:59.624 --> 01:44:01.585]  Then they went and shut down the UT project.
[01:44:01.585 --> 01:44:06.128]  And then DARPA left it on the archive of Google.
[01:44:06.128 --> 01:44:07.788]  You can actually look it up.
[01:44:07.788 --> 01:44:10.150]  They didn't have, Google, I guess, refused to remove it.
[01:44:10.150 --> 01:44:12.031]  I don't know.
[01:44:12.031 --> 01:44:12.351]  Wow.
[01:44:12.351 --> 01:44:12.531]  Yeah.
[01:44:12.531 --> 01:44:13.832]  It's that way back machine.
[01:44:13.832 --> 01:44:14.852]  I found some stuff that way.
[01:44:14.852 --> 01:44:15.732]  That is interesting.
[01:44:15.732 --> 01:44:22.436]  I mean, and how ironic that the internet used to be called the ARPANET because it is a DARPA invention.
[01:44:22.436 --> 01:44:22.576]  Yes.
[01:44:23.587 --> 01:44:30.529]  Well, I just don't get why they'd have UT shut it down, and the Sunshine Project shut it down, and have us shut it down, and then they just left it on Google.
[01:44:30.529 --> 01:44:32.129]  Well, they might not be able to get rid of it.
[01:44:32.129 --> 01:44:34.230]  I mean, that is what is interesting, you know.
[01:44:34.230 --> 01:44:39.511]  There are little stories about that all the time, about researchers finding documents in, say, the National Archives.
[01:44:39.511 --> 01:44:43.572]  I read about one of them, this giant program for the apocalypse.
[01:44:43.572 --> 01:44:45.712]  It was called the Doomsday Project.
[01:44:45.712 --> 01:44:48.933]  And, you know, a researcher uncovers it, makes it public,
[01:44:49.338 --> 01:45:06.485]  Then the Department of Defense steps in, reclassifies it, but it's still out there, as it should be, and so there's really nothing that the government can do about it at that point, once it's on the internet as a PDF file or as part of the Wayback Machine.
[01:45:06.485 --> 01:45:13.168]  What about, I've read your book yet, I'm reading it this weekend, as I said, if folks just tuned in, we're talking to the Pentagon's brain author, Annie Jacobson.
[01:45:13.168 --> 01:45:17.369]  What about other governments and their DARPAs or their ARPAs?
[01:45:17.369 --> 01:45:18.810]  What's your expert take on that?
[01:45:19.986 --> 01:45:30.777]  Well, again, there's where you have to really acknowledge that DARPA is a major force, and it's a major significant force for Americans for national security.
[01:45:30.777 --> 01:45:33.079]  I mean, you must give credit where credit is due.
[01:45:33.079 --> 01:45:36.783]  The agency was created when the Russians beat us into space.
[01:45:37.236 --> 01:45:37.736]  We're good to go.
[01:45:58.866 --> 01:46:06.870]  Artificial intelligence cloning to embarrass the United States and, you know, kind of score that propaganda coup.
[01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:18.296]  The Russia has its own DARPA and in a couple statements, its defense minister has actually said, you know, something along the lines of our DARPA is better than your DARPA.
[01:46:18.296 --> 01:46:25.400]  There's this sinister menace idea that, you know, one day they're going to come out with their revolution in technology.
[01:46:27.793 --> 01:46:30.515]  Well, I'll tell you, America has been exceptional in many ways.
[01:46:30.515 --> 01:46:31.916]  Putin says you're not exceptional.
[01:46:31.916 --> 01:46:35.398]  We've been exceptionally decadent, exceptionally had other problems.
[01:46:35.398 --> 01:46:38.321]  We've also done a lot of exceptional things in a good way.
[01:46:38.321 --> 01:46:49.328]  And there's no way to doubt that America's free market system, coupled with corporate and government coordination, has led the new renaissance.
[01:46:49.328 --> 01:46:53.752]  But there's just such an attitude of statist in people to not deploy that renaissance to the people.
[01:46:54.912 --> 01:46:56.974]  And I think that's DARPA's biggest failure.
[01:46:56.974 --> 01:46:58.315]  They did deploy the internet.
[01:46:58.315 --> 01:47:01.998]  Now they wish, according to Jay Rockefeller and others, they never would have.
[01:47:01.998 --> 01:47:07.882]  So I guess maybe that's why they're scared, is that they don't want to give Promethean Fire to the public.
[01:47:07.882 --> 01:47:10.744]  Well, you know, that's an interesting point you make.
[01:47:10.744 --> 01:47:12.766]  And look at GPS technology, okay?
[01:47:12.766 --> 01:47:20.071]  Researching this book, I was really surprised to learn that GPS technology goes back to DARPA's first year in 1958 when they put satellites up.
[01:47:21.519 --> 01:47:23.660]  So it was originally targeting technology.
[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:25.340]  I mean, think about it, of course it was.
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:25.740]  Artillery.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:27.101]  Right?
[01:47:27.101 --> 01:47:37.583]  Yes, it was like once laser-guided bombs made an appearance in the end of the Vietnam War, now you could have this GPS coordinate, but you say, how did it get into the public?
[01:47:37.583 --> 01:47:41.604]  So the story goes like this, you know, it's secret.
[01:47:41.604 --> 01:47:45.345]  It was actually very easy to hack into, believe it or not.
[01:47:45.345 --> 01:47:50.947]  And so the military created a feature called selective availability, and it was essentially an offset
[01:47:51.437 --> 01:47:53.180]  By several hundred feet.
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:48:00.493]  So if somebody hacked into the military's GPS system to drop a bomb in essence or target something, they would be off by a couple hundred feet.
[01:48:00.493 --> 01:48:03.799]  Well, during the Clinton administration, word came in
[01:48:04.474 --> 01:48:04.634]  Yes.
[01:48:22.236 --> 01:48:22.896]  We're good to go.
[01:48:43.999 --> 01:48:47.601]  And, of course, that goes right along with my idea, which is just educate the people.
[01:48:47.601 --> 01:48:49.102]  I mean, just know what is going on.
[01:48:49.102 --> 01:48:51.344]  Be alert and knowledgeable.
[01:48:51.344 --> 01:48:55.026]  People often think that they, you know, well, what does that, what does that do?
[01:48:55.026 --> 01:49:10.235]  I mean, you and I both know from being in the business of information that, you know, what you look at, what you read, your eyeballs, what you put, all of that gets paid attention to and it all matters and it all has an effect.
[01:49:10.235 --> 01:49:13.037]  And I believe absolutely to my core
[01:49:13.536 --> 01:49:15.860]  That, you know, you talk about human augmentation.
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:19.306]  Well, you can augment yourself just essentially by learning.
[01:49:19.306 --> 01:49:21.750]  You really don't need a brain chip.
[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:22.211]  Exactly.
[01:49:22.211 --> 01:49:24.355]  We become what we ingest, what we look at.
[01:49:26.018 --> 01:49:30.321]  I know it keeps the public busy to have them watch football all day, but man, these people are stupid.
[01:49:30.321 --> 01:49:31.682]  And I mean, I get folks that like football.
[01:49:31.682 --> 01:49:35.884]  I played football, but that's not... Men I talk to, that's all they talk about.
[01:49:35.884 --> 01:49:37.765]  It's just, it's bizarre.
[01:49:37.765 --> 01:49:38.786]  I didn't grow up around that.
[01:49:38.786 --> 01:49:43.769]  You know, and hell, my grandfather played, you know, football with, you know, folks like...
[01:49:44.369 --> 01:49:45.430]  Tom Landry at UT.
[01:49:45.430 --> 01:49:46.950]  I'm not against football.
[01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:47.631]  I played football.
[01:49:47.631 --> 01:49:49.092]  My dad played football.
[01:49:49.092 --> 01:49:57.476]  It's just it's so weird where that's our culture when American culture really was about inventions, trailblazing, exploration.
[01:49:57.476 --> 01:50:04.320]  And so I have a love-hate relationship with DARPA because it seems so Americana, so good, so innovative, so wonderful.
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:07.022]  But then it's got a dark side.
[01:50:07.022 --> 01:50:09.463]  Well, you know, don't get me wrong.
[01:50:09.463 --> 01:50:10.464]  I interviewed 75
[01:50:11.451 --> 01:50:38.014]  Scientists and engineers uniquely affiliated with DARPA programs going back to the agency's beginning and almost the 100% majority raves about DARPA for this very American ideal of excellence that they say all these scientists say look DARPA gave me money let me give you an example there's a limb regeneration lab yes I said that correctly a limb regeneration lab here at UC
[01:50:39.042 --> 01:50:47.890]  Uh, Irvine, where scientists are working because they believe 25, 30 years out, humans will be able to regrow their limbs if they can do the research.
[01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:48.950]  Annie Jacobsen, stay there.
[01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:50.051]  Final segment, riveting.
[01:50:50.051 --> 01:50:55.436]  I want to come back with some of the incredible things they're looking at, what they could be deploying.
[01:50:55.436 --> 01:50:56.156]  Just amazing.
[01:50:56.156 --> 01:50:57.357]  What's the next big revolution?

[01:54:03.467 --> 01:54:05.268]  Final segment with our guests.
[01:54:05.268 --> 01:54:14.390]  We have Peter Schiff joining us on the really bad jobs and unemployment and economic numbers.
[01:54:14.390 --> 01:54:16.331]  And the bottom line is, this is nothing new to our audience.
[01:54:16.331 --> 01:54:20.792]  This is what quantitative easing brought to us by the technocrats the Federal Reserve is going to do.
[01:54:20.792 --> 01:54:22.453]  It's a rigged economy.
[01:54:23.729 --> 01:54:30.492]  Brings some final comments from my guest, who I hope will come back as an expert on Operation Paperclip and Area 51 and do an interview about some of her previous books.
[01:54:30.492 --> 01:54:32.393]  Can't wait to read the book, The Pentagon's Brain.
[01:54:32.393 --> 01:54:36.915]  We'll talk with Annie Jacobson here in just a moment, AnnieJacobson.com.
[01:54:36.915 --> 01:54:39.557]  Briefly, it's been sold out for months.
[01:54:39.557 --> 01:54:42.098]  It is now back in stock, but not for long.
[01:54:42.098 --> 01:54:43.219]  That's not a sales tactic.
[01:54:43.219 --> 01:54:45.640]  People love our products, love our nutraceuticals.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:47.281]  They're game changers.
[01:54:47.281 --> 01:54:48.281]  They're super high quality.
[01:54:48.281 --> 01:54:50.763]  They have 4.8 reviews out of 5.
[01:54:50.763 --> 01:55:03.710]  That's basically the highest reviews you're going to find on Power Reviews and other big third-party respected sites because it's concentrated hardcore herbs, in the case of liver shield, that are known to have detoxifying effects.
[01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:09.314]  You do it with the oxy powder and the apple cider vinegar and the olive oil on a six-day
[01:55:10.374 --> 01:55:13.619]  With the Epson salts and well you've heard what callers have said.
[01:55:13.619 --> 01:55:15.362]  We have informational videos about it.
[01:55:15.362 --> 01:55:17.184]  I'm not going to go into details here.
[01:55:17.184 --> 01:55:18.266]  Infowarslife.com
[01:55:19.994 --> 01:55:23.196]  For me, at least, it was explosive.
[01:55:23.196 --> 01:55:26.717]  And certainly made me feel a lot better, have a lot more energy.
[01:55:26.717 --> 01:55:27.498]  It's amazing.
[01:55:27.498 --> 01:55:29.939]  Some people, you know, they feel pretty bad, too.
[01:55:29.939 --> 01:55:31.440]  I mean, it's not a joke.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:32.460]  It's real.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:37.603]  Consult a health care provider, medical person, you know, before you do it.
[01:55:37.603 --> 01:55:40.424]  But it's generally recognized as safe.
[01:55:40.424 --> 01:55:43.045]  It's all FDA grass certified.
[01:55:43.045 --> 01:55:44.906]  You know, stuff that they say is safe herbs.
[01:55:44.906 --> 01:55:47.348]  The point is, together, in conjunction, it's not a game.
[01:55:47.348 --> 01:55:47.988]  It's not a joke.
[01:55:48.368 --> 01:55:50.589]  We don't sell stuff that's a placebo or a joke.
[01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:52.251]  We sell stuff that's the real deal.
[01:55:52.251 --> 01:55:54.732]  So, again, InfoWars, it's a good free market idea.
[01:55:54.732 --> 01:55:56.753]  People keep buying it.
[01:55:56.753 --> 01:55:59.115]  Wow, old-fashioned ideas, wow!
[01:55:59.115 --> 01:56:03.818]  So, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:03.818 --> 01:56:15.645]  And we've got a lot of great Pro Liberty t-shirts, a lot of other great films, books, just over 600 items now on InfoWarsStore.com is the big umbrella site or InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:56:17.387 --> 01:56:24.857]  And also, again, I just want to add to folks, we will be back this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., with the Sunday transmission.
[01:56:24.857 --> 01:56:26.258]  But a whole other hour is coming up.
[01:56:26.258 --> 01:56:27.180]  I meant to go to calls.
[01:56:27.180 --> 01:56:28.081]  I meant to give the number out.
[01:56:28.081 --> 01:56:31.185]  I just hogged the time with our guests and didn't, so I apologize.
[01:56:31.185 --> 01:56:32.406]  We'll open phones up with Schiff.
[01:56:33.087 --> 01:56:35.709]  In the next hour with your economic comments or questions at 800-259-9231.
[01:56:35.709 --> 01:56:42.554]  Well, Annie, I'm impressed with your book that I've read so far, just 30 pages or so.
[01:56:42.554 --> 01:56:43.315]  I'm impressed with you.
[01:56:43.315 --> 01:56:44.716]  I want to read your other books.
[01:56:44.716 --> 01:56:45.877]  We've got about three minutes left.
[01:56:45.877 --> 01:56:49.479]  In closing, what are some of the other big advances that are coming out of DARPA?
[01:56:49.479 --> 01:56:51.961]  I mean, people talk about NASA and all these inventions.
[01:56:51.961 --> 01:56:53.022]  Isn't most of it DARPA?
[01:56:55.054 --> 01:56:56.155]  Most of it is DARPA.
[01:56:56.155 --> 01:56:59.917]  I mean, DARPA, for example, has a robot that will go to Mars.
[01:56:59.917 --> 01:57:04.919]  It's called Valkyrie, and NASA designed it for DARPA Challenge.
[01:57:04.919 --> 01:57:10.402]  But it's going to go to Mars and act like an avatar, so it'll be controlled back here on Earth.
[01:57:10.402 --> 01:57:18.407]  But this Valkyrie robot will be on Mars, ideally, building a habitat, which then the humans will go into.
[01:57:18.407 --> 01:57:18.987]  So there's
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:22.542]  No doubt that DARPA is so future thinking.
[01:57:22.542 --> 01:57:25.884]  DARPA likes to say DARPA makes the future happen.
[01:57:25.884 --> 01:57:35.469]  But, again, people just will really benefit from having a handle on what that future may or may not look like.
[01:57:35.469 --> 01:57:48.316]  Because the one really spooky element of all of this that I came to was learning at the end of my book how, you know, defense contractors have become advisors to DARPA.
[01:57:48.846 --> 01:57:55.829]  And that's a real problem because it, you know, it's what Eisenhower warned against with the military-industrial complex.
[01:57:55.829 --> 01:58:11.595]  When you have a closed loop, when the guys who are actually making money building these robotic systems, building these drones, are the ones who are advising the Pentagon to create more drones, create a system of robotic warfare.
[01:58:11.595 --> 01:58:13.075]  So they are controlling the future.
[01:58:13.075 --> 01:58:15.136]  They're not just getting the money.
[01:58:15.136 --> 01:58:17.357]  They are now controlling the evolution of human development.
[01:58:18.749 --> 01:58:19.790]  Well, absolutely.
[01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:23.772]  And this is literally science fact, not science fiction.
[01:58:23.772 --> 01:58:29.454]  And it's why it's worth being an alert and knowledgeable citizen.
[01:58:29.454 --> 01:58:29.995]  Amazing.
[01:58:29.995 --> 01:58:31.415]  Well, thank you so much.
[01:58:31.415 --> 01:58:32.516]  I'm going to read your book.
[01:58:32.516 --> 01:58:33.576]  Hopefully you'll join us again.
[01:58:33.576 --> 01:58:35.477]  Thank you so much.
[01:58:35.477 --> 01:58:35.717]  Anytime.
[01:58:35.717 --> 01:58:36.818]  Thanks for having me.
[01:58:36.818 --> 01:58:37.038]  Wow.
[01:58:37.038 --> 01:58:37.738]  Amazing interview.
[01:58:37.738 --> 01:58:38.139]  Stay with us.
[01:58:38.139 --> 01:58:38.999]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:38.999 --> 01:58:39.299]  Wow.
[01:58:39.299 --> 01:58:40.920]  Can't wait to read this.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:41.720]  Nico wants it, too.
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:44.442]  I only have one copy, but he doesn't get it until I read it.

[01:58:49.110 --> 01:58:52.633]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:52.633 --> 01:59:00.880]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:06.304]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[01:59:20.134 --> 01:59:22.335]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[01:59:22.335 --> 01:59:27.338]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[01:59:27.338 --> 01:59:30.619]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[01:59:30.619 --> 01:59:34.101]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[01:59:34.101 --> 01:59:36.082]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[01:59:36.082 --> 01:59:38.223]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[01:59:38.223 --> 01:59:40.184]  It has natural things that do it clean.

[01:59:51.781 --> 01:59:54.386]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.325 --> 02:00:06.626]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.626 --> 02:00:08.407]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.407 --> 02:00:10.168]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.168 --> 02:00:11.749]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.749 --> 02:00:13.290]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.290 --> 02:00:17.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.493 --> 02:00:21.816]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.816 --> 02:00:24.998]  My fist is sore from trading punches with Joe Biggs.
[02:00:24.998 --> 02:00:26.759]  You think I'm 14 years old again last night?
[02:00:28.635 --> 02:00:30.256]  You wanna know how good brain force is?
[02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:31.618]  I didn't mean to do a plug right now.
[02:00:31.618 --> 02:00:33.319]  I wanted one because I'm a little bit tired.
[02:00:33.319 --> 02:00:33.880]  I'm taking one today.
[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:36.022]  I forgot this morning.
[02:00:36.022 --> 02:00:37.383]  I had a brain force sitting here.
[02:00:37.383 --> 02:00:39.104]  There's like 10 pills left in it.
[02:00:39.104 --> 02:00:42.547]  And some little mouse around here has eaten my brain force.
[02:00:42.547 --> 02:00:45.850]  So I just had to go get another bottle during that break.
[02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:48.112]  It opened it up and then it was a painful opening.
[02:00:48.112 --> 02:00:51.956]  That's why I made the fist comment.
[02:00:51.956 --> 02:00:54.157]  It wasn't punching bigs that made my fist hurt though.
[02:00:54.157 --> 02:00:55.439]  It was punching a steel door.
[02:00:56.676 --> 02:00:57.537]  But I've still got it.
[02:00:57.537 --> 02:01:00.218]  I put a little dent in it.
[02:01:00.218 --> 02:01:02.560]  That was a little parlor trick in high school.
[02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.341]  Punched the school doors in denim.
[02:01:04.341 --> 02:01:08.184]  Girls got impressed by that.
[02:01:08.184 --> 02:01:10.465]  And the next guy would try it, break his hand.
[02:01:10.465 --> 02:01:15.729]  Of course, the big secret is you gotta have your hand basically broken pretty much all the time, and then it doesn't hurt so bad.
[02:01:17.409 --> 02:01:19.610]  It's like a spongy smash knuckle.
[02:01:19.610 --> 02:01:20.711]  I'm joking, that didn't happen.
[02:01:20.711 --> 02:01:23.532]  I'm trying to act tough to impress everybody, folks.
[02:01:23.532 --> 02:01:28.354]  Anyways, getting back to what I was covering earlier on the whole DARPA situation.
[02:01:28.354 --> 02:01:35.317]  The secret is not minding the pain.
[02:01:35.317 --> 02:01:36.898]  Pain almost reminds you you're alive.
[02:01:36.898 --> 02:01:38.779]  It's weird.
[02:01:38.779 --> 02:01:40.559]  You have pain long enough, it just becomes part of you.
[02:01:40.559 --> 02:01:41.660]  It's weird.
[02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:43.821]  Anyways, side issue, Peter Schiff's coming up.
[02:01:45.089 --> 02:01:46.289]  Let me put this addendum.
[02:01:46.289 --> 02:01:54.072]  In fact, when we put this on YouTube or Facebook, let's cut that last minute and a half of rant that made no sense, because I'm literally just babbling.
[02:01:54.072 --> 02:02:04.075]  The addendum to that whole DARPA interview is that if I just sit here and attack DARPA, it's not going to be effective reaching out to people like the Pentagon and these big corporations and companies.
[02:02:04.075 --> 02:02:06.116]  Obviously, I want life extension technologies.
[02:02:06.116 --> 02:02:08.897]  Obviously, I want my kids to have access to it.
[02:02:08.897 --> 02:02:10.917]  Obviously, I want humans to progress.
[02:02:10.917 --> 02:02:12.658]  A lot of what DARPA does is super sexy.
[02:02:13.837 --> 02:02:17.838]  The problem is they are eugenicists, they are transhumanists that set it up.
[02:02:17.838 --> 02:02:19.939]  It's not being evenly distributed.
[02:02:19.939 --> 02:02:21.659]  It's our money.
[02:02:21.659 --> 02:02:28.881]  Our tax money is paying for this and it's being given to globalist corporations that build their factories in communist China and India.
[02:02:28.881 --> 02:02:30.361]  And it doesn't even help those people.
[02:02:30.361 --> 02:02:32.762]  They're so greedy.
[02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:37.743]  They sold globalism that we're going to build factories in the third world and make them paradises and build them up.
[02:02:37.743 --> 02:02:39.604]  I would go for that.
[02:02:39.604 --> 02:02:40.704]  You guys don't do that.
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:03:07.005]  It'd be one thing if you had a 600-foot yacht, you know, the size of an aircraft carrier or whatever, and then you actually did that off, say, book sales or something, or a widget, but you do it through government contracts you've robbed, then you are so greedy, you don't have a 200-foot yacht, you got a 600-foot yacht from stolen money, and you won't even build it here when we paid for it, you jerks?
[02:03:07.005 --> 02:03:07.925]  I mean, what's your problem?
[02:03:09.155 --> 02:03:13.139]  You got bad will towards people, and so you're not fit to direct anything.
[02:03:13.139 --> 02:03:20.606]  And you sat there, and you got all the smartest kids out of high school and college since the 50s, and you built this thing, and you didn't build it.
[02:03:20.606 --> 02:03:30.014]  You were smart enough to swindle it with a bunch of good-willed people, but you didn't build it, and it's not yours, and you're not giving it to the people, and you're disgusting.
[02:03:30.905 --> 02:03:34.408]  Instead you give us mercury and shots.
[02:03:34.408 --> 02:03:35.689]  You give us cancer viruses.
[02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:36.670]  Oh, thank you!
[02:03:36.670 --> 02:03:37.790]  You're so nice!
[02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:39.412]  What great gods you are!
[02:03:39.412 --> 02:03:40.733]  You claim you're becoming gods.
[02:03:40.733 --> 02:03:44.295]  You don't act like any god I ever heard of that was any good.
[02:03:44.295 --> 02:03:46.517]  You act like punks.
[02:03:46.517 --> 02:03:48.198]  You act like pieces of trash.
[02:03:48.198 --> 02:03:49.660]  You act like psychopaths.
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:52.242]  My god's not somebody that grabs kids out of backyards and tortures them.
[02:03:53.117 --> 02:03:54.417]  That's not my God.
[02:03:54.417 --> 02:03:57.679]  I know you got a brand new God and you're really cool and everything.
[02:03:57.679 --> 02:04:04.021]  What you got is a bunch of smart people you hijacked who are waking up to you right now and you hope the fluoride is going to dumb us down.
[02:04:04.021 --> 02:04:04.901]  It doesn't work, buddy.
[02:04:04.901 --> 02:04:06.922]  It doesn't work on some people.
[02:04:06.922 --> 02:04:08.382]  You know that.
[02:04:08.382 --> 02:04:17.646]  And so they want to make all their drones autonomous to get the military and the Pentagon out of the equation and to give the technocrats military control.
[02:04:17.646 --> 02:04:18.726]  That's their big dream.
[02:04:18.726 --> 02:04:21.167]  That's why the military is fighting the
[02:04:22.486 --> 02:04:28.932]  Pentagon Advanced Research Science Boards that are saying just make everything autonomous.
[02:04:28.932 --> 02:04:33.957]  And the way you kill it is you bring up stuff like, oh, look at the Trojans inside the cell phones.
[02:04:33.957 --> 02:04:38.842]  Look at the Trojans inside the emissions testing of VW.
[02:04:38.842 --> 02:04:40.764]  Stuff like that.
[02:04:40.764 --> 02:04:42.966]  Obviously, you don't say because you can't sell that to the public.
[02:04:42.966 --> 02:04:43.947]  They're too naive right now.
[02:04:43.947 --> 02:04:44.688]  I mean, I'll do that.
[02:04:45.819 --> 02:04:49.922]  You can't say, oh, you know, a foreign government will hack it or it'll take control of the AI.
[02:04:49.922 --> 02:04:53.244]  Well, that's inevitable if you keep down this road.
[02:04:53.244 --> 02:04:56.867]  So, are you guys smart enough to not go the Atlantean route?
[02:04:56.867 --> 02:04:57.868]  Because you're about to be there.
[02:04:59.289 --> 02:05:01.110]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[02:05:01.110 --> 02:05:06.273]  Now, armed Air Force vet was prevented from stopping Oregon gunman, article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:05:06.273 --> 02:05:15.178]  An Air Force veteran who had a licensed concealed carry gun was prevented by staff from intervening in the shooting yesterday at the Oregon Community College during which 10 people were killed.
[02:05:15.178 --> 02:05:19.180]  John Parker was situated in a building about 200 yards away from where the shooting began.
[02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:22.622]  There were a few people in the vet center and then we heard the shooting happen.
[02:05:22.622 --> 02:05:25.084]  We got up and we were going to go over and see what we could do.
[02:05:25.484 --> 02:05:28.845]  Immediately, the school staff stopped us and told us to get inside of the building.
[02:05:28.845 --> 02:05:31.506]  Essentially, the staff wouldn't let us go to assist.
[02:05:31.506 --> 02:05:37.729]  One courageous man who also tried to apprehend the shooter, Army veteran Chris Mintz, ended up being shot five times.
[02:05:37.729 --> 02:05:38.989]  Mintz was unarmed.
[02:05:38.989 --> 02:05:45.292]  In asserting his right to concealed carry, Parker was knowingly violating a rule which declared the college to be a gun-free zone.
[02:05:45.292 --> 02:05:48.813]  This is why we need to arm our students.
[02:05:48.813 --> 02:05:55.196]  I guarantee you, the students in Oregon wish they had the ability to be able to defend themselves and those around them.
[02:05:55.356 --> 02:05:57.782]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com

[02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:37.252]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[02:06:37.252 --> 02:06:40.533]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[02:06:40.533 --> 02:06:44.014]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[02:06:44.014 --> 02:06:46.014]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.

[02:06:58.678 --> 02:06:59.258]  I want more candy!
[02:06:59.258 --> 02:07:00.419]  I want more video games!
[02:07:00.419 --> 02:07:00.599]  Mine!
[02:07:00.599 --> 02:07:01.900]  Mine!
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:02.000]  Mine!
[02:07:28.558 --> 02:07:28.938]  I think so.
[02:08:08.894 --> 02:08:11.515]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:11.515 --> 02:08:17.916]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:08:17.916 --> 02:08:26.277]  Man, look, wind been blowin' on my back.
[02:08:26.277 --> 02:08:33.139]  I was born to bring trouble wherever I'm at.
[02:08:40.936 --> 02:08:45.198]  That's right, we're called America.
[02:08:45.198 --> 02:08:47.820]  Got 1776 tattooed as well.
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:49.441]  Black gon' turn to red.
[02:08:49.441 --> 02:08:51.562]  Let's be clear.
[02:09:10.037 --> 02:09:24.446]  We're not trying to be alarmists.
[02:09:24.446 --> 02:09:28.268]  I am alarmed, though, so I'm not gonna lie to you.
[02:09:28.268 --> 02:09:28.949]  It is what it is.
[02:09:34.292 --> 02:09:42.276]  Russia has completely upstaged the United States and made our criminal government look like absolute fools.
[02:09:42.276 --> 02:09:47.799]  Which I don't even particularly like, because it's our country, not the globalists, that they're using and running in the ground.
[02:09:47.799 --> 02:09:56.063]  A lot of people are all happy that the Russians are going in and killing Al-Qaeda and blowing up Al-Nusra and going after IS.
[02:09:56.063 --> 02:10:02.807]  And yes, I'm happy about that, but this is part of a larger globalist operation
[02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:06.183]  In the final equation that discredits this country.
[02:10:06.183 --> 02:10:19.510]  Because we could take this country back anytime and turn the prosperity engine on, cut the taxes, cut the spending, make all the welfare folks start working, stop paying for the anchor babies, and this country would go to 10% growth rates in a few years.
[02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:22.131]  Historically, I mean, we did until we got the Federal Reserve.
[02:10:22.131 --> 02:10:26.854]  We did until the Great Depression.
[02:10:26.854 --> 02:10:29.535]  The first 150 years of this country was like heaven.
[02:10:33.066 --> 02:10:42.309]  I mean, it was foreign, Russian, and Japanese, and French historians came over here and were just like, this is awesome!
[02:10:42.309 --> 02:10:43.729]  We had most of the inventions.
[02:10:43.729 --> 02:10:46.530]  We had most of the discoveries.
[02:10:46.530 --> 02:10:49.251]  We were the trailblazers.
[02:10:49.251 --> 02:10:50.751]  We had the best boxers.
[02:10:50.751 --> 02:10:52.452]  We had the best horsemen.
[02:10:52.452 --> 02:10:54.693]  If you got in a war with us, we'd kick your butt.
[02:10:54.693 --> 02:10:56.233]  We'd beat the British Empire.
[02:10:56.233 --> 02:11:00.915]  Nobody could beat them.
[02:11:00.915 --> 02:11:02.155]  They were just more British than the British.
[02:11:06.883 --> 02:11:09.224]  And now, look at us.
[02:11:09.224 --> 02:11:11.284]  Serving Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:11.284 --> 02:11:15.465]  Reuters yesterday, I read that article three, four times an hour on air.
[02:11:15.465 --> 02:11:15.825]  Reuters.
[02:11:15.825 --> 02:11:17.186]  In fact, can you guys dig in the stack and find it?
[02:11:17.186 --> 02:11:24.788]  It was one about Russia against airstrikes and it said, the Pentagon and the UN and blah blah blah.
[02:11:24.788 --> 02:11:32.990]  And right there in the article, it talked about the President and the Defense Department criticizing Russia for not bombing ISIS, but bombing Al-Qaeda bases.
[02:11:34.209 --> 02:11:36.951]  That are, quote, the Pentagon sees as moderate.
[02:11:36.951 --> 02:11:39.432]  I mean, this is how disconnected our elite are.
[02:11:39.432 --> 02:11:45.876]  That they will put in Reuters and the Associated Press and the New York Times, they all reported it yesterday, I couldn't believe it.
[02:11:45.876 --> 02:11:54.721]  I couldn't believe it, that you shouldn't bomb the moderates, and then it said Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:54.721 --> 02:12:00.244]  I don't know if our elite are, I mean, maybe Peter Schiff's right, it's not a conspiracy.
[02:12:00.244 --> 02:12:02.326]  Maybe they were just living off our smart ancestors.
[02:12:03.380 --> 02:12:10.606]  And this elite is completely inept, and that's even scarier.
[02:12:10.606 --> 02:12:15.130]  I don't know how they get away with giving trillions of dollars to select banks that taxpayers got to pay for.
[02:12:15.130 --> 02:12:18.873]  I don't know how they get away with fixing the interest rates and fixing the currency rates.
[02:12:18.873 --> 02:12:23.417]  I don't know how they've held it up this long, but the truth is they didn't hold it up this long.
[02:12:23.417 --> 02:12:24.158]  As Peter Schiff said,
[02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:30.613]  The job numbers are fake, but even the fake numbers are hellish.
[02:12:30.613 --> 02:12:32.874]  94,610,000 Americans not in labor force.
[02:12:32.874 --> 02:12:37.857]  Participation rate lowest since 1977.
[02:12:37.857 --> 02:12:41.359]  Record 56 plus million women not working.
[02:12:41.359 --> 02:12:43.961]  Yeah, like black unemployment's doubled.
[02:12:43.961 --> 02:12:45.422]  I mean, where's the liberal empowerment?
[02:12:45.422 --> 02:12:48.103]  Jobs up only for immigrants.
[02:12:48.103 --> 02:12:51.605]  That's because immigrants, you gotta give it to them, are smart enough to get on welfare and get a job.
[02:12:51.605 --> 02:12:54.127]  Because you sure can't live on those paychecks.
[02:12:58.049 --> 02:13:03.411]  Remember the Fed said they're never going to raise the rates, and that's what... They've just come out and said that.
[02:13:03.411 --> 02:13:05.611]  Peter Schiff said they never can.
[02:13:05.611 --> 02:13:07.952]  He's pretty much the only guy saying they never will.
[02:13:07.952 --> 02:13:12.754]  And then they said a month ago, oh, we're not going to raise it, but we are going to raise it down the road.
[02:13:12.754 --> 02:13:18.536]  Peter Schiff joins us because we have people on that are accurate, people that are right, people that actually want to tell the truth.
[02:13:18.536 --> 02:13:20.576]  But I always thought mainstream media just wanted to lie.
[02:13:20.576 --> 02:13:22.737]  I guess Peter would say they're stupid.
[02:13:22.737 --> 02:13:23.677]  Maybe Peter's right.
[02:13:23.677 --> 02:13:25.738]  You know, I'm not saying I'm the smartest guy around.
[02:13:26.954 --> 02:13:41.672]  But I make pretty good decisions in my life, and I think I've got a blind spot that I think other people are smart like I am, and maybe I need to get smarter and realize that no, a lot of people are super stupid.
[02:13:41.672 --> 02:13:44.976]  But regardless, I don't care if the government's got a mass of people.
[02:13:48.905 --> 02:13:54.390]  That will go along with, say, turning our guns in or opening our borders up and paying for everything for free.
[02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:57.293]  I have a right to not be a slave and pay for all this.
[02:13:57.293 --> 02:13:58.414]  That's what the Bill of Rights states.
[02:13:58.414 --> 02:14:04.479]  It doesn't matter if you get 51% selling horse manure and saying it's chocolate cake.
[02:14:04.479 --> 02:14:05.981]  I don't have to eat it.
[02:14:05.981 --> 02:14:09.284]  And I hate to use a gross analogy, but if it fits, you gotta use it.
[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:11.802]  Peter, I'm ranting here.
[02:14:11.802 --> 02:14:13.184]  I'm not happy that you've been proven right.
[02:14:13.184 --> 02:14:14.785]  I'm not happy we've been proven right.
[02:14:14.785 --> 02:14:17.448]  Because I realize the public has no idea, on average, what's going on.
[02:14:17.448 --> 02:14:18.109]  Not our audience.
[02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:21.093]  A lot of them are smarter than I am.
[02:14:21.093 --> 02:14:26.619]  I just have this intellectual view, but also this feeling that I'm like in an insane asylum or something.
[02:14:26.619 --> 02:14:28.241]  I mean, how crazy is this going to get?
[02:14:29.195 --> 02:14:34.459]  Well, you know, I think a lot more data is going to come out before the general public can accept that I'm right.
[02:14:34.459 --> 02:14:39.223]  Or maybe not the general public, the so-called experts on the economy.
[02:14:39.223 --> 02:14:45.789]  The very experts that basically said that there was about a 90% chance the Fed was going to raise rates by December.
[02:14:46.329 --> 02:14:49.691]  Now, I was saying that the chance was closer to zero.
[02:14:49.691 --> 02:15:02.519]  Now that we got today's horrible jobs report, and I'm going to talk about that, but now those experts are changing their forecasts, and now they're saying, well, now that we got this new information, maybe the Fed is going to wait until March.
[02:15:02.519 --> 02:15:09.083]  Look, I didn't need to see this job data to know the Fed wasn't going to raise rates, because they will prick their own bubble.
[02:15:09.503 --> 02:15:14.065]  But let's look at how bad this jobs report was, because it was really, really bad.
[02:15:14.065 --> 02:15:16.906]  They were expecting 203,000 jobs.
[02:15:16.906 --> 02:15:17.506]  We only got 142,000.
[02:15:17.506 --> 02:15:21.848]  That's way less than even the lowest end of the estimate.
[02:15:21.848 --> 02:15:24.629]  And that's them pumping, with giant fire hoses, $1,000 bills.
[02:15:25.689 --> 02:15:30.392]  Yeah, but they went back and they revised last month, which was originally reported at 173.
[02:15:30.392 --> 02:15:35.356]  Everybody was expecting that to be revised up to above 200.
[02:15:35.356 --> 02:15:43.162]  I remember on CNBC, Mark Zandi, chief economist, Moody's.com, when that 173 number came out, he said, ignore it.
[02:15:43.162 --> 02:15:43.962]  It means nothing.
[02:15:43.962 --> 02:15:45.143]  They're going to revise it up.
[02:15:45.143 --> 02:15:45.844]  It's well over 200,000.
[02:15:45.844 --> 02:15:46.985]  We're going to get another 200,000 next month.
[02:15:46.985 --> 02:15:47.365]  Everything is great.
[02:15:50.647 --> 02:15:50.828]  That's
[02:16:07.006 --> 02:16:11.787]  They went back to the month before that and they revised that down too.
[02:16:11.787 --> 02:16:13.808]  So they revised down two months.
[02:16:13.808 --> 02:16:15.228]  This month was lousy.
[02:16:15.228 --> 02:16:20.669]  Then look at, you alluded to labor force participation dropped to 62.4.
[02:16:20.669 --> 02:16:22.670]  That's a new low for this cycle.
[02:16:22.670 --> 02:16:26.811]  You got to go back to the 1970s to get a participation rate that low.
[02:16:26.811 --> 02:16:27.251]  But you know,
[02:16:27.791 --> 02:16:35.601]  That doesn't tell the real story, because as you remember, back in the early 1970s, most married women didn't work.
[02:16:35.601 --> 02:16:39.325]  Because they didn't have to, because their husbands could afford to support them.
[02:16:39.325 --> 02:16:45.113]  But today, you have all these women working, because men can't afford to support themselves, let alone their wives.
[02:16:45.113 --> 02:16:45.773]  Isn't that wonderful?
[02:16:46.394 --> 02:16:53.061]  Yeah, but if you look at male labor force participation, it has never been this low in the history of the Republic.
[02:16:53.061 --> 02:16:58.127]  There have never been such a small percentage of men who have jobs than now.
[02:16:58.127 --> 02:16:59.088]  Look at the wages.
[02:16:59.088 --> 02:17:01.831]  They were expecting real wages to go up 0.2.
[02:17:01.831 --> 02:17:02.592]  They were flat.
[02:17:02.972 --> 02:17:07.275]  You know, and that doesn't adjust for inflation and average work week went down.
[02:17:07.275 --> 02:17:09.316]  This was a horrible report.
[02:17:09.316 --> 02:17:16.020]  And of course, if you look at the jobs by category, we lost manufacturing jobs.
[02:17:16.020 --> 02:17:18.102]  We lost mining and logging jobs.
[02:17:18.102 --> 02:17:20.163]  We lost wholesale trade jobs.
[02:17:20.163 --> 02:17:21.424]  These are the good paying jobs.
[02:17:21.824 --> 02:17:23.265]  What jobs did we create?
[02:17:23.265 --> 02:17:31.547]  Government jobs, waiters, bartenders, people that ring cash registers, orderlies in hospitals.
[02:17:31.547 --> 02:17:38.650]  We created low-paying, minimum wage jobs, and we destroyed the good jobs that you can support a family on.
[02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:39.470]  That's what's going on.
[02:17:40.734 --> 02:17:44.738]  Now, as I introed it, is it on purpose or is it just ineptitude?
[02:17:44.738 --> 02:17:49.282]  I mean, they got a lot of professors cloward and pivots saying they want to make everybody dependent.
[02:17:49.282 --> 02:17:51.624]  Look, they're not smart enough to do this on purpose.
[02:17:51.624 --> 02:17:54.347]  If the government was trying to wreck the economy, it'd be booming.
[02:17:54.347 --> 02:18:00.372]  I mean, the fact of the matter is, you know, these politicians just want to get elected.
[02:18:00.372 --> 02:18:03.535]  Wall Street is concerned about stimulating stock prices.
[02:18:03.535 --> 02:18:04.196]  They don't care.
[02:18:04.196 --> 02:18:06.238]  So they're just giving us happy pills and we're drug addicts.
[02:18:06.838 --> 02:18:16.403]  Yeah, I mean, even Carl Icahn came out with this video recently, Danger Ahead, you know, when you got mainstream billionaires starting to figure it out, right?
[02:18:16.403 --> 02:18:18.143]  It's getting near the end of the game.
[02:18:18.143 --> 02:18:27.288]  Except, you know, he thought that the Fed had been giving the economy medicine, and he was worried what was going to happen when the medicine went away, you know, the 0% rates.
[02:18:27.288 --> 02:18:28.668]  He's got the metaphor wrong.
[02:18:28.668 --> 02:18:31.850]  It's not medicine, because medicine implies that it's helping.
[02:18:32.290 --> 02:18:37.452]  It's monetary heroin, it's a steroid, it's a painkiller.
[02:18:37.452 --> 02:18:43.194]  Whatever the Fed's been giving us has been making the economy sicker, but numbing us to the pain.
[02:18:43.194 --> 02:18:55.718]  But he did have an image, a photograph, and I've used this analogy myself too, of everybody partying on a bus, and then Janet Yellen pushing a bus, and you can see in the picture that the bus is going to go over the edge of a cliff.
[02:18:56.218 --> 02:19:01.062]  But no one cares because they're having so much fun partying on the bus.
[02:19:01.062 --> 02:19:02.283]  They're not paying attention.
[02:19:02.283 --> 02:19:05.406]  Because the elite are the recipients of the money up front.
[02:19:05.406 --> 02:19:07.748]  They just can't help themselves.
[02:19:08.666 --> 02:19:13.270]  Oh yeah, and you know, the thing is, you know, this number came out, gold's up 20, 25 bucks.
[02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:14.732]  I mean, that's nothing.
[02:19:14.732 --> 02:19:16.093]  It's still below $11.40.
[02:19:16.093 --> 02:19:18.255]  The dollar's down a little bit.
[02:19:18.255 --> 02:19:19.796]  People still don't get it.
[02:19:19.796 --> 02:19:26.663]  They're still clinging to the idea, okay, well the Fed won't raise by December, but they'll do it early next year.
[02:19:26.663 --> 02:19:27.604]  They're not going to raise.
[02:19:27.904 --> 02:19:29.925]  Right, they still think this is a recovery.
[02:19:29.925 --> 02:19:30.946]  It's not.
[02:19:30.946 --> 02:19:33.888]  And these job numbers are only going to get worse.
[02:19:33.888 --> 02:19:37.851]  And wait until next year comes and we start losing jobs.
[02:19:37.851 --> 02:19:46.878]  In fact, if you look at the numbers that came out today on factory orders, horrible numbers, the 10th consecutive year over year... Well sure, I don't have to look at the numbers.
[02:19:46.878 --> 02:19:47.818]  I've got family and friends.
[02:19:47.818 --> 02:19:49.680]  I know the economy is literally in the toilet.
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:52.802]  But we'll go over those numbers with Peter Schiff and ask what's coming next straight ahead.
[02:19:52.802 --> 02:19:53.903]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:19:53.903 --> 02:19:55.344]  He's with Europact.com.
[02:19:55.344 --> 02:19:55.724]  Stay with us.
[02:19:59.685 --> 02:20:03.486]  Just recently, we've witnessed some of the most catastrophic disasters in history.
[02:20:03.486 --> 02:20:10.127]  Be sure to prepare yourself with great-tasting, high-quality, GMO-free food that has a 25-year shelf life.
[02:20:10.127 --> 02:20:13.948]  Of course, we're talking about the foods from SurvivalFoodAlliance.com.
[02:20:13.948 --> 02:20:19.949]  And don't forget, the human body needs up to 3 quarts of water every day to remain healthy and hydrated.

[02:20:29.312 --> 02:20:30.293]  Hey, Berkey Guy here.
[02:20:30.293 --> 02:20:32.114]  Are you still drinking unfiltered tap water?
[02:20:32.114 --> 02:20:33.874]  Does your water contain chlorine or fluoride?
[02:20:33.874 --> 02:20:35.836]  Will you have drinkable water in an emergency?
[02:20:35.836 --> 02:20:41.839]  The Berkey Guy is here to help you remove these and other potential contaminants from your water, thus helping you drink clean, purified water.

[02:20:45.481 --> 02:20:47.442]  Don't go another moment without a Berkey system.
[02:20:47.442 --> 02:20:50.544]  Over the last 10 years, we've helped thousands drink clean, purified water.
[02:20:50.544 --> 02:20:53.825]  Join them by visiting GoBerkey.com or call me, the Berkey Guy, at 877-886-3653.
[02:20:53.825 --> 02:20:54.005]  That's 877-886-3653.
[02:20:59.008 --> 02:21:05.713]  My name is Bill Bonner, and I'm the president of the largest private news and research network in the world.
[02:21:05.713 --> 02:21:11.197]  And I paid for this airtime because I have an important message to the American people.
[02:21:11.197 --> 02:21:15.740]  There's a change coming that the government isn't telling you about.
[02:21:15.740 --> 02:21:20.024]  This change has deep implications for life in America.
[02:21:20.024 --> 02:21:24.287]  From where you shop, to the doctors you visit and the family you want to protect,
[02:21:24.867 --> 02:21:27.989]  Look, I've made predictions like this before.
[02:21:27.989 --> 02:21:30.950]  Thing is, I was right then, too.
[02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:35.353]  A few years ago, I warned that housing prices would collapse.
[02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:36.453]  They did.
[02:21:36.453 --> 02:21:41.516]  Before that, I warned that dot-com companies would crash.
[02:21:41.516 --> 02:21:42.676]  They did.
[02:21:42.676 --> 02:21:46.518]  Those who listened had a chance to save themselves.
[02:21:46.518 --> 02:21:48.900]  But this has nothing to do with the stock market.
[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:50.400]  This will affect us all.
[02:21:50.400 --> 02:21:51.681]  You can watch the video for free
[02:21:51.681 --> 02:21:52.142]  We're good.
[02:21:59.022 --> 02:22:02.564]  Young people are supposed to be full of energy and recover quickly from exercise.
[02:22:02.564 --> 02:22:06.166]  Their age should give them a great advantage to feeling good all the time.
[02:22:06.166 --> 02:22:12.090]  However, young people of today are dealing with the same nutrient-deficient food as everyone else in America.
[02:22:12.090 --> 02:22:14.211]  So it does not matter whether you are 15 or 85.
[02:22:14.211 --> 02:22:17.914]  If your biochemistry is off, you cannot feel your best.
[02:22:17.914 --> 02:22:20.475]  Listen to the real-world results of James.
[02:22:20.475 --> 02:22:22.336]  My name is James Ashley.
[02:22:22.336 --> 02:22:23.317]  I'm 25 years old.
[02:22:23.317 --> 02:22:26.279]  At the end of a tiring work shift, I used to not do much around the house.
[02:22:26.519 --> 02:22:36.906]  Since I started taking the new Technology Enhance One World Way after work, I have so much energy when I get home that I'm able to take long walks, do chores, and even honey to-do lists from the wife.
[02:22:36.906 --> 02:22:41.589]  It's plenty enough energy to get things done around the house and time to settle down before bedtime.

[02:23:18.205 --> 02:23:21.727]  It's robbery by contract and it can cost you thousands.

[02:24:03.471 --> 02:24:06.074]  This song's about Janet Yellen.
[02:24:06.074 --> 02:24:07.875]  I love Elvis.
[02:24:07.875 --> 02:24:11.399]  I like the Elvis movies.
[02:24:11.399 --> 02:24:14.501]  They're so stupid.
[02:24:14.501 --> 02:24:18.065]  They're fun to watch with the kids, you know?
[02:24:27.097 --> 02:24:33.891]  I used to not get, like, escapist stuff when I was younger because I liked real serious stuff, but now that I'm always focusing on serious stuff, I like the stupider the better.
[02:24:34.662 --> 02:24:39.923]  When I'm trying to deprogram myself from the world on the weekend or whatever, I get it now.
[02:24:39.923 --> 02:24:40.724]  I click.
[02:24:40.724 --> 02:24:42.324]  I'm an old man now, I guess.
[02:24:42.324 --> 02:24:44.025]  Peter Schiff is our guest.
[02:24:44.025 --> 02:24:45.425]  If you want to talk to him, I'm sure you do.
[02:24:45.425 --> 02:24:50.966]  You have an economic question, or you agree with him, you disagree with him, or you agree with me, disagree, whatever.
[02:24:50.966 --> 02:24:54.267]  By the way, folks who disagree, go to the head of the line.
[02:24:54.267 --> 02:24:55.248]  We've still got a bunch of calls.
[02:24:57.608 --> 02:24:58.128]  From the DARPA.
[02:24:58.128 --> 02:24:59.089]  We're going to clear those out.
[02:24:59.089 --> 02:25:01.110]  We got folks that want to talk about the economy.
[02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:04.091]  Larry, Tim, Jerry, Wild and others.
[02:25:04.091 --> 02:25:04.992]  800-259-9231.
[02:25:04.992 --> 02:25:06.432]  800-259-9231.
[02:25:06.432 --> 02:25:12.055]  You know, Peter, it really is gallows humor.
[02:25:12.055 --> 02:25:14.296]  Peter Schiff of Europac.com joins us.
[02:25:14.296 --> 02:25:16.718]  Billions under management predicted that...
[02:25:17.677 --> 02:25:21.400]  Big bubble in 2008 when no one believed it and a lot of other predictions.
[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:25.483]  Predicted three, four years ago that there'd be a crash last year, basically.
[02:25:25.483 --> 02:25:26.924]  Well, there is a crash all over the world.
[02:25:26.924 --> 02:25:30.247]  We're just drinking Jim Jones Kool-Aid here and don't know it yet.
[02:25:30.247 --> 02:25:33.229]  So I think his prediction and Gerald Salente's and others was accurate.
[02:25:33.229 --> 02:25:36.652]  But clearly it's going on now more intensely.
[02:25:36.652 --> 02:25:37.913]  They're trying to paper over it.
[02:25:39.051 --> 02:25:45.033]  How do you see this unfolding now with the technicals, without getting too technical, in the next few years?
[02:25:45.033 --> 02:25:53.697]  I mean, in your gut, when you're talking to your wife or talking to one of your investors, sitting around a cocktail, what does Peter Schiff really think is going to happen?
[02:25:53.697 --> 02:25:55.037]  I mean, just be honest with us.
[02:25:55.037 --> 02:25:59.159]  Nobody's holding you to a prediction, but specifically, what do you think is going to happen?
[02:25:59.699 --> 02:26:10.508]  Yeah, well, first of all, I wanted to continue where I left off about the other data that came out today, the factory orders, which were down for the 10th month in a row, down more than expected.
[02:26:10.508 --> 02:26:13.050]  This has never happened outside of a recession.
[02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:15.512]  You've never seen this unless we were in a recession.
[02:26:16.613 --> 02:26:26.786]  The Atlanta Fed GDP Now numbers, they predicted, they came out a couple days ago or yesterday and revised their forecast for Q3, third quarter, to just .9.
[02:26:26.786 --> 02:26:34.675]  But I think now that this new jobs data is out and we got these factory orders, there's a good chance that we're going to have a negative quarter.
[02:26:35.336 --> 02:26:36.597]  In the third quarter.
[02:26:36.597 --> 02:26:43.860]  And if we're negative in the third quarter, I bet we're also negative in the fourth quarter because the fourth quarter tends to be pretty weak.
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:46.221]  They've been very weak during the last seven years.
[02:26:46.221 --> 02:26:50.162]  So I think if we get a negative third quarter, we'll have a negative fourth quarter.
[02:26:50.162 --> 02:26:52.523]  We'll have two negative quarters back to back.
[02:26:52.523 --> 02:26:53.664]  There's your recession.
[02:26:54.404 --> 02:26:55.384]  Now what happens?
[02:26:55.384 --> 02:26:57.905]  Now the Fed has to react to that recession.
[02:26:57.905 --> 02:27:00.726]  Rates will still be at zero, so they can't cut them.
[02:27:00.726 --> 02:27:02.026]  What are they going to do?
[02:27:02.026 --> 02:27:03.847]  QE4, right?
[02:27:03.847 --> 02:27:08.168]  And that is when the bottom drops out of the dollar, if it hasn't already done it by then.
[02:27:08.168 --> 02:27:13.590]  I think there is a great opportunity for your listeners to get out of dollars.
[02:27:13.590 --> 02:27:15.270]  I mean, the dollars are still up.
[02:27:15.270 --> 02:27:20.252]  We've had this huge rise in the dollar because these currency speculators just don't get it.
[02:27:20.652 --> 02:27:23.033]  They still think the economy is in great shape.
[02:27:23.033 --> 02:27:25.153]  They still think the Fed is going to raise rates.
[02:27:25.153 --> 02:27:26.774]  Even though the Chinese are exiting?
[02:27:26.774 --> 02:27:28.294]  Even though the Chinese are exiting?
[02:27:28.294 --> 02:27:34.576]  Yeah, when reality comes crashing into their expectations, this is going to be a huge event.
[02:27:34.576 --> 02:27:38.238]  Like the collapse of the subprime, like collapse of the dot coms.
[02:27:38.238 --> 02:27:41.459]  Think of it as the dollar dot com or a subprime currency.
[02:27:41.459 --> 02:27:43.059]  This thing is going to implode.
[02:27:43.059 --> 02:27:46.160]  And I think when it drops, it's going to drop quickly.
[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:49.101]  But people are going to make some serious money or they're going to pretend
[02:27:49.241 --> 02:27:53.985]  So you think the dollar will plunge or basically jackknife or will it go down and bounce back up?
[02:27:53.985 --> 02:27:54.825]  What do you expect to see?
[02:27:54.825 --> 02:27:55.266]  No, no.
[02:27:55.266 --> 02:27:57.147]  I think it's going to go down for the count.
[02:27:57.147 --> 02:28:02.291]  Remember, it's risen based on the expectations of all these rate hikes.
[02:28:02.291 --> 02:28:04.112]  These rate hikes aren't coming.
[02:28:04.112 --> 02:28:08.075]  The dollar has risen because everybody thinks the Fed has finished printing money.
[02:28:08.075 --> 02:28:09.596]  They're only getting warmed up.
[02:28:09.596 --> 02:28:11.878]  They've got a lot more printing yet to come.
[02:28:11.878 --> 02:28:14.199]  So this is an opportunity before people wake up
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:20.363]  For people that, you know, open up accounts with me or other people that can do foreign investing, get out of U.S.
[02:28:20.363 --> 02:28:27.427]  dollars, buy some foreign stocks, get your money into Switzerland, get it into Singapore, get it into New Zealand, get some gold stocks.
[02:28:27.427 --> 02:28:28.267]  They are dirt cheap.
[02:28:28.267 --> 02:28:32.750]  They are giving these things away because people are clueless as to what's going to happen.
[02:28:32.750 --> 02:28:33.370]  I know this.
[02:28:33.370 --> 02:28:36.212]  I'm no rocket scientist, but folks should hedge their bets, obviously.
[02:28:36.992 --> 02:28:39.073]  I mean, everybody is making bad bets.
[02:28:39.073 --> 02:28:40.873]  And that's how you make money in the market.
[02:28:40.873 --> 02:28:42.894]  Take the other side of the bad bets.
[02:28:42.894 --> 02:28:44.794]  People made money shorting Subprime.
[02:28:44.794 --> 02:28:46.495]  They made money shorting dot-coms.
[02:28:46.495 --> 02:28:51.296]  People are going to make a ton of money... How much money did you make predicting the 2008 for your customers?
[02:28:51.296 --> 02:28:54.277]  Well, my customers lost in 2008, right?
[02:28:54.277 --> 02:28:58.878]  I had customers that made a lot of money in 2007 on the collapse of Subprime.
[02:28:58.878 --> 02:28:59.119]  But in 2008,
[02:29:00.919 --> 02:29:03.442]  All the foreign stocks that we owned went down.
[02:29:03.442 --> 02:29:04.744]  The dollar went up in 2008.
[02:29:04.744 --> 02:29:07.327]  The dollar didn't go down until 2009.
[02:29:07.327 --> 02:29:09.850]  That's when foreign stocks came back up.
[02:29:09.850 --> 02:29:10.311]  That's what I meant.
[02:29:10.311 --> 02:29:11.973]  But down the road you made money, yeah.
[02:29:11.973 --> 02:29:14.616]  But we haven't had a dollar collapse yet.
[02:29:14.616 --> 02:29:17.019]  I've been preparing for a dollar collapse for a long time.
[02:29:17.179 --> 02:29:18.059]  I want to talk about oil.
[02:29:38.005 --> 02:29:38.386]  Exactly.
[02:29:38.386 --> 02:29:39.206]  We gotta go to break.
[02:29:39.206 --> 02:29:40.628]  Definitely things are volatile.
[02:29:40.628 --> 02:29:43.691]  Definitely we're built a house on top of a volcano that's active.
[02:29:43.691 --> 02:29:46.914]  So, I don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but it's not good.
[02:29:46.914 --> 02:29:48.576]  I'm trying to figure out what to do, just like you are.
[02:29:48.576 --> 02:29:49.637]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.637 --> 02:29:52.179]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.179 --> 02:29:54.842]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.361 --> 02:30:00.582]  Selective outrage.
[02:30:00.582 --> 02:30:04.546]  Obama hasn't said a damn word about routine mass shootings in Chicago.
[02:30:04.546 --> 02:30:14.695]  Following the mass shooting in Oregon Thursday, the president delivered a 12-minute tirade about the need for stricter gun control laws and admitted he was politicizing the incident before the body count was even in.
[02:30:14.695 --> 02:30:20.160]  When he wasn't referring to himself 28 times, a visibly angry Obama called mass shootings in the U.S.
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:20.621]  routine.
[02:30:21.101 --> 02:30:23.203]  Somehow this has become routine, Obama said.
[02:30:23.203 --> 02:30:25.865]  My response here at this podium has become routine.
[02:30:25.865 --> 02:30:31.109]  And what becomes routine is the response from those who oppose any sort of gun control legislation.
[02:30:31.109 --> 02:30:33.391]  Hey Obama, leave the guns alone!
[02:30:33.391 --> 02:30:40.216]  Stop trying to disarm people who are law-abiding citizens who want to protect themselves, their family, their property.
[02:30:40.216 --> 02:30:41.297]  That is the right.
[02:30:41.297 --> 02:30:42.678]  We don't need a gun law.
[02:30:42.938 --> 02:30:44.821]  Our law is a Second Amendment.
[02:30:44.821 --> 02:30:50.368]  You keep attacking people day in and day out, and quite frankly, I'm sick of it.
[02:30:50.368 --> 02:30:54.093]  This is on you, your anti-gun agenda, Obama.
[02:30:54.093 --> 02:30:54.773]  I'm Joe Biggs.
[02:30:54.773 --> 02:30:56.996]  You can find more reports at InfoWars.com.

[02:34:21.053 --> 02:34:24.534]  And necessarily out of that they develop a hatred for humanity.
[02:34:24.534 --> 02:34:30.056]  Because who wants to do something they don't enjoy?
[02:34:30.056 --> 02:34:33.798]  And so Peter Schiff has been pretty accurate predicting what's going to happen is our guest.
[02:34:33.798 --> 02:34:36.559]  I want him to be able to roll with what he thinks is going to unfold now.
[02:34:37.938 --> 02:34:42.559]  Other areas of the economy, and then I want to go to your phone calls here on this live Friday edition.
[02:34:42.559 --> 02:34:58.843]  Before we do that, just briefly, we did get Liver Shield back in, and you can see the video about it, you can read all about it, hear Dr. Grip talk about it, read the testimonials for yourself, read people's reviews, basically, they're not even testimonials.
[02:34:58.843 --> 02:34:59.863]  4.8 of 5 stars.
[02:34:59.863 --> 02:35:01.284]  That's unprecedented.
[02:35:01.284 --> 02:35:03.084]  Third-party review site, Power Reviews.
[02:35:05.310 --> 02:35:07.351]  And the really good reviews, we're not even able to put up.
[02:35:07.351 --> 02:35:08.632]  Those get excised and removed.
[02:35:08.632 --> 02:35:11.213]  It's like, we're not like only showing the good reviews.
[02:35:11.213 --> 02:35:13.774]  We're actually getting rid of the incredible reviews.
[02:35:13.774 --> 02:35:16.275]  So it's the opposite of what somebody might think.
[02:35:16.275 --> 02:35:17.776]  It's ridiculous.
[02:35:17.776 --> 02:35:19.317]  But you can just do this regularly.
[02:35:19.317 --> 02:35:22.498]  I've had amazing benefits personally.
[02:35:22.498 --> 02:35:25.240]  Or you can do the big cleanses.
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:28.421]  And I'll be honest, I've only done one fully.
[02:35:28.421 --> 02:35:29.822]  I'm not a very regimented person.
[02:35:29.822 --> 02:35:31.302]  I'm not very good at taking care of myself.
[02:35:31.302 --> 02:35:32.143]  It was spectacular.
[02:35:32.796 --> 02:35:34.717]  Liver Shield, sold out for months, is back in.
[02:35:34.717 --> 02:35:37.258]  You can get it with Oxy-Powder, discounted right now.
[02:35:37.258 --> 02:35:43.762]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:35:43.762 --> 02:35:48.504]  We also have back in stock, sold out for a few weeks, the Hillary for Prison t-shirt.
[02:35:48.504 --> 02:35:50.325]  We have it back in all sizes.
[02:35:50.325 --> 02:35:53.007]  It's a dark blue shirt, classic political shirt.
[02:35:54.335 --> 02:36:20.300]  and it's there's also a black version and it says Hillary for prison 2016 on the back it says legalized freedom to quote Ron Paul InfoWars.com and it has a 5.0 review we don't have anything else that has that top review but if you're looking for folks to buy a drink at the bar or whatever this is the way to do it at least from our experiences so InfoWarsStore.com InfoWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139
[02:36:24.798 --> 02:36:28.259]  And we've got BrainForce, we've got ChildEase back in stock.
[02:36:28.259 --> 02:36:30.439]  We've got just a bunch of great products.
[02:36:30.439 --> 02:36:36.180]  And you can know when you shop with us, you are funding the tip of the spear, the good guys in the fight against the globalists.
[02:36:36.180 --> 02:36:42.881]  So, InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site where it's all at.
[02:36:42.881 --> 02:36:47.262]  And we've got non-GMO seeds for your fall garden, Christmas presents.
[02:36:47.262 --> 02:36:48.542]  I mean, it's all there.
[02:36:48.542 --> 02:36:49.982]  And that's how we built this organization.
[02:36:49.982 --> 02:36:50.983]  So, thank you.
[02:36:50.983 --> 02:36:51.983]  Please don't.
[02:36:51.983 --> 02:36:53.203]  It's really an oxymoron.
[02:36:54.229 --> 02:36:57.754]  When callers call in and thank me, that's why I get tired of it.
[02:36:57.754 --> 02:37:00.417]  I mean, you are the ones that listen.
[02:37:00.417 --> 02:37:02.019]  You are the ones that buy the products.
[02:37:02.019 --> 02:37:03.541]  You are the ones that spread the word.
[02:37:03.541 --> 02:37:05.463]  You are the ones that send us the show tips.
[02:37:05.463 --> 02:37:06.505]  You are the eyes and ears.
[02:37:06.505 --> 02:37:06.705]  You!
[02:37:06.705 --> 02:37:06.925]  You!
[02:37:06.925 --> 02:37:07.146]  You!
[02:37:07.146 --> 02:37:07.326]  You!
[02:37:07.326 --> 02:37:07.466]  You!
[02:37:09.116 --> 02:37:11.658]  You make the clock go round.
[02:37:11.658 --> 02:37:13.199]  You make the world go round.
[02:37:13.199 --> 02:37:15.120]  You put the gas in the tank.
[02:37:15.120 --> 02:37:17.541]  You load the bombs on the Info Bomber.
[02:37:17.541 --> 02:37:18.122]  Figured that out yet?
[02:37:18.122 --> 02:37:19.502]  You're part of the same team.
[02:37:19.502 --> 02:37:30.709]  Just like Russian bombers, fighter bombers being loaded up with weapons to go attack ISIS and Al Qaeda targets, God bless them, because our criminal government won't do it.
[02:37:30.709 --> 02:37:36.733]  The people fueling those jets, the people loading those bombs on those jets are just as important as the pilot going in to pull the trigger.
[02:37:38.049 --> 02:37:40.411]  Now, Peter Schiff, I like getting interviews with you.
[02:37:40.411 --> 02:37:43.355]  We get into politics, the world, and not just economics.
[02:37:43.355 --> 02:37:46.618]  It's not like it's a five-minute interview on CNBC.
[02:37:46.618 --> 02:37:51.163]  So I've got a few political questions and calls for you, but other points you want to telegraph to folks.
[02:37:51.163 --> 02:37:53.966]  Saying the economy would get worse, saying this would continue.
[02:37:53.966 --> 02:37:55.387]  You've been proven right on that.
[02:37:55.387 --> 02:37:56.648]  So what do you say is coming next?
[02:37:57.529 --> 02:38:13.203]  Well, let me finish up what I was talking about before the break on, you know, why my clients did so well with me from 2001 to 2008 was because the dollar bubble that had inflated in the late 1990s burst, and then the dollar fell for seven years.
[02:38:13.203 --> 02:38:16.806]  Well, we have a bigger dollar bubble now than we had then.
[02:38:16.806 --> 02:38:18.287]  The fundamentals for the U.S.
[02:38:18.287 --> 02:38:19.348]  economy are much worse.
[02:38:19.768 --> 02:38:20.028]  I think?
[02:38:42.515 --> 02:38:43.315]  Thank you very much.
[02:39:01.005 --> 02:39:05.368]  No one has any idea how quickly and how much value the dollar is going to lose.
[02:39:05.368 --> 02:39:10.591]  And, you know, I just put up another video of some of my predictions from 2006.
[02:39:10.591 --> 02:39:16.675]  If you go on YouTube and you search it for 2006 all over again, look at the things I was saying.
[02:39:16.675 --> 02:39:21.919]  And the reason I did 2006 was the real estate market blew up in 07, not 08.
[02:39:21.919 --> 02:39:25.621]  The financial crisis happened in 08, but the real estate market blew up in 07.
[02:39:25.621 --> 02:39:26.562]  And in 2006, nobody saw it coming.
[02:39:29.984 --> 02:39:31.565]  And watch some of those videos from 2006.
[02:39:31.565 --> 02:39:40.649]  This is how clueless the mainstream can be, including the Federal Reserve, when there is a disaster right around the corner and they can't see it.
[02:39:40.649 --> 02:39:57.976]  So we have another disaster, it's around another corner, I can see it, and I think people need to protect themselves and they need to get their financial ducks in a row now, because if you wait too long it's going to be too late, because once the dollar collapses, if all you got is dollars, you know, you're holding a bunch of paper.
[02:39:57.976 --> 02:39:58.897]  Let me put it to you this way.
[02:39:59.727 --> 02:40:03.310]  I said before the break, we built a house on top of an active volcano.
[02:40:03.310 --> 02:40:09.474]  Smoke's coming out, some lava's boiling around, the ground's rumbling, some rocks are bouncing down the side of the cliff.
[02:40:09.474 --> 02:40:10.615]  I don't know what it's going to blow up.
[02:40:11.897 --> 02:40:13.898]  The seismologists don't know.
[02:40:13.898 --> 02:40:15.820]  The volcanologists don't know.
[02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:18.121]  All I know is I've looked at history.
[02:40:18.121 --> 02:40:19.662]  This never goes well.
[02:40:19.662 --> 02:40:21.583]  Let's say you're wrong.
[02:40:21.583 --> 02:40:25.886]  Could the laws of economics be suspended with computers or whatever?
[02:40:25.886 --> 02:40:27.927]  Could this just go on forever?
[02:40:27.927 --> 02:40:30.049]  I mean, what are some of the other scenarios if you're wrong?
[02:40:30.629 --> 02:40:32.791]  It can't go on forever, right?
[02:40:32.791 --> 02:40:37.136]  And the fact that 2008, really, that was the beginning of the end.
[02:40:37.136 --> 02:40:40.380]  The process has already started, so we're already here.
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:46.746]  But yes, they have found ways to delay the process, stretch it out, but only at the cost of making it worse.
[02:40:47.327 --> 02:40:56.715]  Realizing the Fed now is really in a box, because they've been pretending they were going to raise rates for years, and now their backs are to the wall, and they have to admit that they're not going to do it.
[02:40:56.715 --> 02:41:10.847]  And when they have to launch QE4, and when everybody thought the Fed was finished, and that it had worked, and now they find out that it didn't work, and they have to do it all over again, the Fed's credibility is gone, and the next leg of the dollar bear market
[02:41:11.207 --> 02:41:11.267]  Is
[02:41:26.966 --> 02:41:27.226]  I think so.
[02:41:55.532 --> 02:42:01.435]  I think, my gut tells me, looking at the economics and history, I think you're on the money.
[02:42:01.435 --> 02:42:05.016]  I think other weird stuff could happen, stuff so upside down and so crazy.
[02:42:05.016 --> 02:42:08.098]  But regardless, we're headed into some very unstable times.
[02:42:08.098 --> 02:42:10.479]  I want to make this point, get your take on it, and then go to calls.
[02:42:10.479 --> 02:42:12.400]  Peter Schiff again is our guest right now.
[02:42:12.400 --> 02:42:15.321]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:15.321 --> 02:42:18.742]  I see Putin being worshipped, being lionized.
[02:42:18.742 --> 02:42:24.005]  The commenters on my site, but other mainstream sites, YouTube, as if he's Jesus or something.
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:37.004]  I see that as a bellwether of the incredible disdain, discontent, hatred the American people have, the disillusionment with our government and the mainstream media.
[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:43.501]  Look at how popular Trump is, or look at Bernie Sanders.
[02:42:43.501 --> 02:42:48.502]  People are fed up and they are reaching for anything that's different.
[02:42:48.502 --> 02:42:50.923]  Anybody that sounds like maybe they can make a difference.
[02:42:50.923 --> 02:42:55.184]  One of the things I like about Trump is he's got a lot of the problems right.
[02:42:55.184 --> 02:43:04.566]  He identifies the problems that a lot of other candidates don't want to address, but he doesn't really offer solutions that will work, because the solutions that will work
[02:43:05.086 --> 02:43:07.068]  You're unpopular.
[02:43:07.068 --> 02:43:09.270]  Yeah, it involves cutting programs.
[02:43:09.270 --> 02:43:10.931]  But he doesn't want to talk about that.
[02:43:10.931 --> 02:43:12.792]  He says, I'm going to save Social Security.
[02:43:12.792 --> 02:43:14.634]  I'm going to give out free health care.
[02:43:14.634 --> 02:43:26.384]  So he doesn't want to really say, I've got the bitter tasting medicine, he's got the right problems, but he's got quackery type of solutions that aren't going to work.
[02:43:26.384 --> 02:43:26.724]  I agree.
[02:43:26.724 --> 02:43:29.646]  So let's get into Putin, because I want your take on this specifically to finish it.
[02:43:30.715 --> 02:43:36.121]  I see the collapse in American confidence, mainstream news saying Putin's not a leader of the free world.
[02:43:36.121 --> 02:43:47.113]  Not that Putin's not a leader of the free world, it's that we've lost so much confidence the world has that this serious situation in Syria, pun intended,
[02:43:47.874 --> 02:43:55.703]  Is really the iceberg peeking up above the surface, showing that the world is beginning to turn on America.
[02:43:55.703 --> 02:43:59.807]  I mean, I really think the full confidence of the world is beginning to shift.
[02:43:59.807 --> 02:44:01.369]  And once it goes, it's going to go quick.
[02:44:02.148 --> 02:44:15.431]  Yeah, and what's going to accelerate that process is the drop of the dollar and then piercing this mystique that we've got this great economy, this sound economy, that our leaders know what they're doing, that our central bankers are somehow geniuses.
[02:44:15.431 --> 02:44:25.813]  When that myth is pierced, right, this is a whole new ballgame and the world is going to look at America through a whole different perspective.
[02:44:25.813 --> 02:44:27.253]  What do you expect that fallout to be like?
[02:44:28.388 --> 02:44:29.849]  It's not going to be pretty.
[02:44:29.849 --> 02:44:37.334]  You know, I mean, we're going to have to get used to living in a whole new reality where, you know, the dollar is not the center of the monetary system.
[02:44:37.334 --> 02:44:39.656]  And that means Americans can't live beyond our means.
[02:44:39.656 --> 02:44:44.239]  I mean, Americans take for granted that we can buy all kinds of stuff that we don't produce.
[02:44:44.239 --> 02:44:46.581]  We don't have the factories that make all the stuff.
[02:44:46.581 --> 02:44:48.242]  You know, our production is so low.
[02:44:48.242 --> 02:44:55.647]  In fact, you know, my brother was doing some calls of reporters asking, you know, why are you not, you know, covering all this horrible
[02:44:56.007 --> 02:44:57.128]  They're totally delusional.
[02:45:15.562 --> 02:45:18.524]  If we want to consume, we have to produce.
[02:45:18.524 --> 02:45:22.886]  So we live because the world is dumb enough to trade the stuff that we produce for the paper we produce.
[02:45:22.886 --> 02:45:24.126]  We produce paper money.
[02:45:24.126 --> 02:45:26.468]  And these people don't think that's a problem.
[02:45:26.468 --> 02:45:34.772]  It just shows the fundamental disconnect that when things do collapse, which it will, what goes up must come down, they are going to be just a nightmare force to deal with.
[02:45:34.772 --> 02:45:39.034]  Can you imagine these hordes of ignorant trendies, Peter, what they're going to be like during a depression?
[02:45:39.941 --> 02:45:45.385]  Oh, look, you know, America had a lot more stability during the 1930s when we had that depression.
[02:45:45.385 --> 02:45:48.306]  Can you imagine what would go on on bread lines today?
[02:45:48.306 --> 02:45:51.709]  I mean, what would Americans do in this situation like the 1930s?
[02:45:51.709 --> 02:45:57.532]  I mean, look what happens, you know, look how they riot and loot just, you know, when something goes wrong.
[02:45:57.532 --> 02:46:01.935]  Or look at what they do when their team wins a sporting event, you know.
[02:46:01.935 --> 02:46:04.737]  I mean, imagine something really bad, you know.
[02:46:04.737 --> 02:46:05.838]  Imagine what's going to happen then.
[02:46:06.698 --> 02:46:09.979]  You know, the sad part is pretty soon we're not going to have to imagine it.
[02:46:09.979 --> 02:46:11.600]  We're going to live through it.
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:13.461]  It's a time bomb.
[02:46:13.461 --> 02:46:16.002]  We live on top of a time bomb.
[02:46:16.002 --> 02:46:18.583]  We are sitting on top of a time bomb.
[02:46:18.583 --> 02:46:22.804]  And our politicians and leaders are not doing anything to try to reverse this.
[02:46:22.804 --> 02:46:24.605]  But they are buying armored redoubts.
[02:46:24.605 --> 02:46:27.926]  So I guess they... I think the establishment knows where this is going, Peter.
[02:46:27.926 --> 02:46:30.027]  They're just trying to put it off as long as they can and trying to milk it.
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:32.241]  Well, absolutely.
[02:46:32.241 --> 02:46:38.408]  And, you know, by postponing it, they extend and pretend, but the problems get worse.
[02:46:38.408 --> 02:46:41.512]  That means the solution ultimately is more painful.
[02:46:41.512 --> 02:46:48.000]  But it does provide a window of opportunity for people who have not yet prepared themselves financially to do so.
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:50.661]  And that's, you know, one of the reasons I come on your program.
[02:46:50.661 --> 02:46:53.402]  I think it's important for people to be prepared.
[02:46:53.402 --> 02:46:59.464]  I mean, when this thing collapses, I want as many Americans as possible not to go broke.
[02:46:59.464 --> 02:47:00.845]  Because so many will.
[02:47:00.845 --> 02:47:09.808]  And the important thing is to have people that understand, you know, why the country's in so much trouble, to have the resources to help do something, to help build it back up again.
[02:47:11.274 --> 02:47:14.896]  Well, if government just would cut its size and cut taxes, we'd be fine.
[02:47:14.896 --> 02:47:15.717]  You're absolutely right.
[02:47:15.717 --> 02:47:17.138]  Folks need to be prepared.
[02:47:17.138 --> 02:47:19.639]  Everything the system wants is for us to be dependent.
[02:47:19.639 --> 02:47:22.101]  Let's take some phone calls here.
[02:47:22.101 --> 02:47:24.502]  Let's go ahead and talk to Wylde in Wisconsin.
[02:47:24.502 --> 02:47:26.904]  You're on the air with Peter Schiff.
[02:47:26.904 --> 02:47:29.685]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[02:47:29.685 --> 02:47:36.970]  To interlink these two guests, Mr. Schiff, can you please explain to me the dynamic ways money has become a tool
[02:47:38.028 --> 02:47:41.285]  Number one for population control and brainwashing.
[02:47:43.322 --> 02:47:44.943]  Well, money is used for social engineering.
[02:47:44.943 --> 02:47:46.224]  Go ahead, Peter.
[02:47:46.224 --> 02:47:47.925]  Well, I don't know about brainwashing.
[02:47:47.925 --> 02:47:51.487]  I mean, they certainly do that in the public school system, that's for sure.
[02:47:51.487 --> 02:47:55.529]  But, you know, money, the government uses money to buy votes.
[02:47:55.529 --> 02:47:57.230]  And those votes give it power.
[02:47:57.230 --> 02:47:58.070]  And that's what happens.
[02:47:58.070 --> 02:48:01.412]  You know, we encourage bad behavior through the tax code.
[02:48:01.412 --> 02:48:03.313]  We give people money not to work.
[02:48:03.313 --> 02:48:05.915]  We give people money to have children out of wedlock.
[02:48:05.915 --> 02:48:07.515]  We punish people when they work hard.
[02:48:07.515 --> 02:48:08.216]  We take their money.
[02:48:08.556 --> 02:48:14.399]  You know, when you really realize how few rights you have in America is when you go out and start a business.
[02:48:14.399 --> 02:48:16.099]  That's when the government really starts putting a hat on.
[02:48:16.099 --> 02:48:18.500]  Oh yeah, you find out, don't you?
[02:48:18.500 --> 02:48:23.082]  So, we encourage all the wrong things and we discourage all the right things.
[02:48:23.082 --> 02:48:28.645]  And sure, money is a tool that they use and the Federal Reserve is creating those tools.
[02:48:28.985 --> 02:48:34.908]  And there are a lot of people that are getting rich, and of course the people who are getting rich are recycling their wealth back to the politicians.
[02:48:34.908 --> 02:48:39.291]  That's one of the other things that Trump has right, that all these politicians are for sale.
[02:48:39.291 --> 02:48:45.794]  You know, they raise taxes way up, and now people have to give them money to get special tax breaks to avoid those taxes.
[02:48:45.794 --> 02:48:54.459]  That's one of the reasons they're so high in the first place, because they use them as a club to shake people down to get some extra money so that people can be exempted from taxes.
[02:48:55.619 --> 02:49:04.822]  Absolutely on target.
[02:49:04.822 --> 02:49:05.862]  Peter Schiff's our guest.
[02:49:05.862 --> 02:49:06.702]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:49:06.702 --> 02:49:08.223]  Jerry in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:49:08.223 --> 02:49:10.343]  Go ahead.
[02:49:10.343 --> 02:49:12.364]  Greetings and salutations.
[02:49:12.364 --> 02:49:12.984]  Go ahead, brother.
[02:49:12.984 --> 02:49:17.285]  I don't really have a question, just a comment.
[02:49:17.285 --> 02:49:22.647]  I don't worry too much about them rounding us up as much as we already live in a financial prison.
[02:49:23.602 --> 02:49:31.348]  Uh, you can't hardly make a dollar beyond, if you're not already in the middle class, trying to climb your way up is nearly impossible.
[02:49:31.348 --> 02:49:33.890]  It's like pounding a nail in with a piece of Play-Doh.
[02:49:33.890 --> 02:49:35.451]  You're just not gonna get it done.
[02:49:35.451 --> 02:49:42.336]  There's so many men out there, Peter touched on it, that are just frustrated from just trying to feed their families.
[02:49:42.336 --> 02:49:45.898]  Exactly, the harder you work, the more they tax you and screw you over, so why not?
[02:49:45.898 --> 02:49:47.499]  Exactly.
[02:49:47.499 --> 02:49:51.222]  Yeah, I mean, I get, in between my insurance and my taxes, I pay 38% of my income.
[02:49:52.887 --> 02:49:54.368]  Well, we don't want to do that.
[02:49:54.368 --> 02:49:55.128]  Let me ask Peter this question.
[02:49:55.128 --> 02:49:58.090]  Aren't more and more people just going to stop complying with the system?
[02:50:12.691 --> 02:50:14.493]  Well, it's eventually out of necessity.
[02:50:14.493 --> 02:50:19.377]  I mean, if you can't even survive and pay the taxes, I mean, yes, compliance is going to go down.
[02:50:19.377 --> 02:50:25.382]  That's one of the reasons I got my dad dying in prison, is because he's there to discourage people from not paying taxes.
[02:50:25.382 --> 02:50:26.263]  Hey, don't pay your taxes!
[02:50:26.263 --> 02:50:28.705]  Look, you're going to end up like Erwin Schiff.
[02:50:28.705 --> 02:50:33.469]  But look, you know, the income taxes created more cheaters than golf.
[02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:36.412]  I mean, most people cheat because that's the only way they can survive.
[02:50:36.872 --> 02:50:37.432]  Exactly!
[02:50:59.761 --> 02:51:08.346]  Just a lawless group, 50 different CPAs, give you 50 different answers, 50 different tax lawyers, 50 different answers.
[02:51:08.346 --> 02:51:10.427]  Now the IRS won't even give you advice.
[02:51:10.427 --> 02:51:12.769]  They just wait for you to stick your neck in the bear trap.
[02:51:14.407 --> 02:51:20.711]  And you know, I was even explaining this to my 13-year-old in the car today when I was driving him to school this morning.
[02:51:20.711 --> 02:51:27.196]  But, you know, it's like the government creates a situation where they, you know, you figure everybody's pulling this wagon.
[02:51:27.196 --> 02:51:31.018]  And the government starts incentivizing some people to get in the wagon.
[02:51:31.018 --> 02:51:32.559]  And now some people jump in the wagon.
[02:51:32.559 --> 02:51:35.901]  And initially, you know, it's okay because there's still a lot of people pulling it.
[02:51:35.901 --> 02:51:39.584]  And, you know, they don't have to pull much harder because there's not that many people in the wagon.
[02:51:39.884 --> 02:51:51.991]  But as more and more people look inside the wagon and realize it's more lucrative to be pulled around than to pull, eventually, you know, all of a sudden, the people that are pulling have to pull really hard because there's so many people in that wagon.
[02:51:51.991 --> 02:51:58.274]  And so finally, the people who are pulling say, you know what, they all decide to jump in the wagon because it's too hard to pull.
[02:51:58.274 --> 02:51:59.515]  Everybody wants to ride in it.
[02:51:59.515 --> 02:52:00.015]  But you know what?
[02:52:00.015 --> 02:52:04.177]  Then the wagon doesn't go anywhere because everybody can't be in a wagon that nobody pulls.
[02:52:04.177 --> 02:52:05.118]  And this is the key.
[02:52:05.498 --> 02:52:11.840]  This is why the political left, the political correctness bullies workers, bullies men, bullies families.
[02:52:11.840 --> 02:52:23.583]  They know they're parasites and they want to intimidate us and dominate us under totalitarianism so they can sit there and spit on us while we pull the wagon and keep us intimidated and following their order.
[02:52:23.583 --> 02:52:24.463]  But that illusion is a...
[02:52:25.385 --> 02:52:30.729]  Alex, I think by next year you're going to have over 100 million Americans sitting in that wagon.
[02:52:30.729 --> 02:52:34.371]  That's going to be a huge burden for the people who are still pulling it.
[02:52:34.371 --> 02:52:41.056]  And then it's all of a sudden it's going to be a big switch where people are just going to give up and that's, you know, it doesn't work.
[02:52:41.056 --> 02:52:47.561]  The economy can't work with so many people expecting other people to do the work because that's what the government has promised.
[02:52:48.866 --> 02:52:53.210]  Exactly, so we are reaching that moment where any amount of intimidation is not going to work.
[02:52:53.210 --> 02:52:55.212]  Just like in the Soviet system, people are going to stop working.
[02:52:57.109 --> 02:52:59.471]  Oh yeah, and don't wait for it to happen.
[02:52:59.471 --> 02:53:01.832]  Prepare yourself financially now.
[02:53:01.832 --> 02:53:05.594]  Don't wait until you're staring at this crisis in the rearview mirror.
[02:53:05.594 --> 02:53:10.077]  That's what I tell my clients is, look, we've got to be early because you can't be late.
[02:53:10.077 --> 02:53:12.878]  You do not want to arrive late.
[02:53:12.878 --> 02:53:20.643]  You've got to be early because that's the only way you'll survive this thing financially is if you're already prepared when it hits.
[02:53:20.643 --> 02:53:23.344]  It's going to be like a tornado coming.
[02:53:23.344 --> 02:53:26.026]  You never see those things coming until they're right on top of you.
[02:53:26.286 --> 02:53:30.969]  So you gotta have some preparation, otherwise by the time you see it, you know, it's too late to do anything about it.
[02:53:30.969 --> 02:53:32.690]  Undoubtedly we now have radar.
[02:53:32.690 --> 02:53:35.471]  We know there's storms, we know there's tornadoes.
[02:53:35.471 --> 02:53:43.116]  The debate is what are the tornadoes going to do, and I think you've been pretty accurately saying where they're going to go, but who can call this stuff?
[02:53:43.116 --> 02:53:50.220]  It's very frustrating, and then to see the politicians getting themselves ready while telling us don't get ready is one of the most frustrating parts.
[02:53:50.220 --> 02:53:52.061]  Tim in Illinois, you're on the air with Peter Schiff, go ahead.
[02:53:53.510 --> 02:53:55.291]  Yeah, I got two questions.
[02:53:55.291 --> 02:53:59.352]  One, do you think we'll see record youth unemployment in America like in Greece?
[02:53:59.352 --> 02:54:07.615]  And then my second question is, what can the young Americans like in their early 20s learn from Greece and other countries and how to prepare for what's coming?
[02:54:09.315 --> 02:54:21.523]  Yeah, well, I don't know that we're ever going to get real record unemployment because the records aren't honest anymore, you know, because so many people lose their jobs and they're not considered unemployed the way the government counts them.
[02:54:21.523 --> 02:54:30.548]  But I do think the official unemployment rate is going to go up and we might get back up closer to 10% in this next downturn from the 4.1% we're at now.
[02:54:31.829 --> 02:54:36.833]  But if we ever get back up to 10% officially, it's probably 25-30% unofficially.
[02:54:36.833 --> 02:54:47.442]  In fact, it'll probably be higher than it was during the Great Depression if we actually measured it using the same methodology that we use to measure unemployment during the Great Depression.
[02:54:47.442 --> 02:54:54.447]  But the government is not honest about these statistics because it wants to hide the truth beneath a blanket of these phony statistics.
[02:54:55.308 --> 02:54:58.310]  And that is the $64 million question.
[02:54:58.310 --> 02:55:03.735]  We know about them cooking the interest rates, the currencies, the insurance, just all of it.
[02:55:03.735 --> 02:55:06.317]  But imagine what we don't know they're cooking.
[02:55:06.317 --> 02:55:19.147]  That's the new variable in the equation to where I would agree with you on everything except who knows what rabbits they've got, weird new political economic drugs to introduce into the system.
[02:55:19.907 --> 02:55:21.608]  I'm not saying they're miracles.
[02:55:21.608 --> 02:55:27.291]  I mean, obviously, the economy's rotting on the vine, but it's just who knows what's going to happen.
[02:55:27.291 --> 02:55:32.574]  Look, there's a limit to how far they can push this, this phony engineered, you know, economy.
[02:55:32.574 --> 02:55:38.637]  But the average person in the street living in the actual economy knows it's getting worse.
[02:55:38.637 --> 02:55:41.958]  Americans know their financial futures are slipping away.
[02:55:41.958 --> 02:55:43.099]  They have no savings.
[02:55:43.399 --> 02:55:44.782]  They have no net worth.
[02:55:44.782 --> 02:55:45.683]  They're living paycheck to paycheck.
[02:55:45.683 --> 02:55:46.545]  That's at record level.
[02:55:46.545 --> 02:55:47.647]  Your kids move in with you.
[02:55:47.647 --> 02:55:48.909]  They have a part-time job.
[02:55:48.909 --> 02:55:49.951]  You keep up appearances.
[02:55:49.951 --> 02:55:51.514]  You don't say we're in a depression.
[02:55:51.514 --> 02:55:52.556]  You just keep your mouth shut.
[02:55:53.888 --> 02:56:01.613]  Yeah, you know, and the powers that be, whether it's on Wall Street or in Washington, they don't want to acknowledge the reality.
[02:56:01.613 --> 02:56:04.135]  They still want to hide behind these statistics.
[02:56:04.135 --> 02:56:06.137]  The stock market's at a record high.
[02:56:06.137 --> 02:56:07.718]  Home prices are at a record high.
[02:56:07.718 --> 02:56:09.519]  Yeah, who can afford to buy a house?
[02:56:09.519 --> 02:56:12.421]  We have record numbers of people renting, and the rents are going up.
[02:56:12.421 --> 02:56:15.663]  That is the problem, and so are the utility bills, and so are the property taxes.
[02:56:15.663 --> 02:56:16.404]  That's inflation.
[02:56:16.624 --> 02:56:22.266]  You know, people are spending now 30, 40, 50 percent of their incomes on rent.
[02:56:22.266 --> 02:56:24.826]  You know, this is a poor country.
[02:56:24.826 --> 02:56:29.628]  When you have to spend more and more of your money on rent, then you're going to have to spend more and more of your money on food.
[02:56:29.628 --> 02:56:32.288]  This is characteristic of what happens in a poor country.
[02:56:32.288 --> 02:56:34.569]  This is not a wealthy country, an industrial country.
[02:56:34.569 --> 02:56:34.989]  Exactly.
[02:56:34.989 --> 02:56:36.830]  Those costs should be going down.
[02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:38.470]  Housing costs should be going down.
[02:56:38.470 --> 02:56:39.871]  That's a sign of wealth.
[02:56:39.871 --> 02:56:44.432]  Let's go to Jonathan in Central America, south of Mexico, Guatemala.
[02:56:44.992 --> 02:56:46.114]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[02:56:46.114 --> 02:56:46.514]  Go ahead.
[02:56:46.514 --> 02:56:48.997]  You're on the air with Peter Schiff.
[02:56:48.997 --> 02:56:50.159]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[02:56:50.159 --> 02:56:58.910]  Actually, what I'm going to make is particularly more in the sense of a comment instead of a question.
[02:56:58.910 --> 02:56:59.191]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:56:59.191 --> 02:57:00.052]  We're not screening your call.
[02:57:00.052 --> 02:57:00.673]  Go ahead and say it.
[02:57:02.034 --> 02:57:02.874]  Okay, thanks.
[02:57:02.874 --> 02:57:16.020]  So, well, of course, being from Guatemala, I'm sure both of you and everyone in the audience know that I'm actually from the main country that sends people to the United States.
[02:57:16.020 --> 02:57:18.561]  That, of course, being the illegal immigrants.
[02:57:18.561 --> 02:57:24.844]  And if you take a look at the statistics, actually, for the migrant crisis that happened last year,
[02:57:26.434 --> 02:57:31.498]  I'm not entirely sure about the percentage, but the majority of people are from Guatemala.
[02:57:31.498 --> 02:57:37.583]  And there is something that Trump says in which he is absolutely right.
[02:57:37.583 --> 02:57:53.276]  And it is that, for some reason, many of our people are going up and onto the North and onto the slavery and everything and riding on trains, crossing on deserts, becoming prostitutes, etc.
[02:57:55.623 --> 02:58:02.675]  One thing that I've noticed that no one has spoken about, and I actually would like to address this, is that
[02:58:04.767 --> 02:58:22.072]  One of the main reasons that people are fleeing Guatemala and Central America, actually, because our countries are completely turned over by the gangs that were... Sure, absolute crime waves.
[02:58:22.072 --> 02:58:23.153]  Absolutely.
[02:58:23.153 --> 02:58:26.094]  Peter Schiff, I want to thank you for joining us today.
[02:58:26.094 --> 02:58:29.495]  Look forward to having you back on again, and we'll track what you're doing over at Europack.com.
[02:58:29.495 --> 02:58:29.795]  Thank you.
[02:58:30.555 --> 02:58:31.095]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:58:31.095 --> 02:58:31.836]  Have a good weekend.
[02:58:31.836 --> 02:58:32.796]  You bet.
[02:58:32.796 --> 02:58:33.676]  You too.
[02:58:33.676 --> 02:58:36.518]  Fourth Hour with Anthony Gucciardi coming up.
[02:58:36.518 --> 02:58:37.618]  I'm going to do five more minutes.
[02:58:37.618 --> 02:58:39.839]  Stay with us.
[02:58:39.839 --> 02:58:41.100]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:42.475 --> 02:59:44.918]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.832 --> 03:00:08.457]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.457 --> 03:00:20.645]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:20.645 --> 03:00:25.629]  Well, Senator Blumenthal introduced gun-grabbing legislation after the tragic shooting in Oregon.
[03:00:27.338 --> 03:00:29.119]  You knew that was coming.
[03:00:29.119 --> 03:00:32.260]  That's some of the news up on Infowars.com.
[03:00:32.260 --> 03:00:33.580]  We went into DARPA today.
[03:00:33.580 --> 03:00:38.202]  We went into advanced technologies, breakaway civilizations.
[03:00:38.202 --> 03:00:39.322]  We got into the economy.
[03:00:39.322 --> 03:00:41.923]  I mean, really, the mainstream media calls me all the time.
[03:00:41.923 --> 03:00:42.623]  They want to do interviews.
[03:00:42.623 --> 03:00:48.045]  I don't really do them anymore because they just want to talk to you like it's a prop.
[03:00:48.045 --> 03:00:49.945]  To act like they're journalists.
[03:00:49.945 --> 03:00:54.407]  To act like they actually went out and investigated something.
[03:00:54.407 --> 03:00:54.827]  That's all it is.
[03:00:56.920 --> 03:01:00.761]  But they always want to ask you, you know, how do you define your show?
[03:01:00.761 --> 03:01:08.722]  I mean, we are defined by what happens in the world and that we're trying to cover it from a perspective of individuals.
[03:01:08.722 --> 03:01:11.503]  You know, I want to own guns to protect myself.
[03:01:11.503 --> 03:01:12.383]  I want to innovate.
[03:01:12.383 --> 03:01:14.083]  I want to live in a free country.
[03:01:14.083 --> 03:01:17.124]  I don't want to have a corrupt government.
[03:01:17.124 --> 03:01:20.605]  I want safe, healthy, clean medicine.
[03:01:20.605 --> 03:01:22.265]  I want safe, healthy, clean water.
[03:01:23.351 --> 03:01:24.892]  I want a good future.
[03:01:24.892 --> 03:01:26.432]  That's what you want.
[03:01:26.432 --> 03:01:34.615]  And when you really study stuff and get past the propaganda, you find out you don't get the elite club unless you got really bad intentions for people.
[03:01:34.615 --> 03:01:38.497]  And again, I used to not understand this, but now I totally get it.
[03:01:38.497 --> 03:01:41.038]  You couldn't have morals and do the stuff you're doing.
[03:01:41.038 --> 03:01:41.938]  You'd kill yourself.
[03:01:41.938 --> 03:01:43.139]  You would disintegrate.
[03:01:43.139 --> 03:01:48.141]  I mean, I can't do anything bad and not just have incredible guilt over it.
[03:01:48.141 --> 03:01:50.021]  That's just how I'm genetically designed.
[03:01:50.021 --> 03:01:51.202]  I'm programmed that way.
[03:01:53.502 --> 03:01:56.583]  Other people, they don't have that programming.
[03:01:56.583 --> 03:02:06.127]  And we have the programming to overcome and defeat these people, but the globalists have done everything they can to block that programming.
[03:02:06.127 --> 03:02:08.988]  And so I'm just here to hack that program.
[03:02:08.988 --> 03:02:10.029]  I'm angry.
[03:02:10.029 --> 03:02:10.849]  I'm upset.
[03:02:10.849 --> 03:02:12.309]  I'm not afraid of these people.
[03:02:12.309 --> 03:02:13.870]  I'm committed.
[03:02:13.870 --> 03:02:16.191]  And in that is a great liberty.
[03:02:17.955 --> 03:02:20.876]  It is the animating contest of liberty.
[03:02:20.876 --> 03:02:26.979]  And you as listeners and as viewers and as supporters, you are as integral to this operation as anything we do.
[03:02:26.979 --> 03:02:28.679]  And I'm not here doing a pep talk, folks.
[03:02:28.679 --> 03:02:30.780]  It's the truth.
[03:02:30.780 --> 03:02:36.102]  In that lies the secret to everything.
[03:02:36.102 --> 03:02:37.603]  The animating contest of liberty.
[03:02:38.547 --> 03:02:39.707]  Be part of it.
[03:02:39.707 --> 03:02:42.428]  Anthony Gucciardi has got a lot coming up in the next hour.
[03:02:42.428 --> 03:02:48.390]  Anthony, joining us from Studio A, from the old radio studio, what's some of the news you're going to be covering?
[03:02:48.390 --> 03:02:49.350]  Well, we've got a lot of stuff.
[03:02:49.350 --> 03:02:51.030]  We've got stacks that you didn't cover.
[03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:55.651]  We've got some of the stores that aren't opening on Black Friday and what it means.
[03:02:55.651 --> 03:03:05.394]  But overall, I want to talk about the secret of our societal controllers and how they keep us enslaved, how the consumers are being deconsumed, and ultimately what we can do about it.
[03:03:06.331 --> 03:03:11.654]  And again, they're creating a consumer society that consumes us in a game.
[03:03:11.654 --> 03:03:15.997]  People say, well, the globalists going offshore are going to end up destroying their own market.
[03:03:15.997 --> 03:03:17.158]  That's the point.
[03:03:17.158 --> 03:03:22.981]  It's a military consolidation, a full control ahead of the eugenics agenda.
[03:03:22.981 --> 03:03:26.423]  They've got to shut down the economy to make us dependent on them.
[03:03:26.423 --> 03:03:28.204]  It is a scientific blueprint.
[03:03:28.204 --> 03:03:32.547]  And only admitting how diabolical it is can we try to avert it.
[03:03:33.487 --> 03:03:42.970]  Exactly, and it's at a societal level, a global level, an individual level, and so many of us don't even understand that we're being consumed on a daily basis by everything you just said.
[03:03:44.264 --> 03:03:47.287]  Well, why don't you just let the globalists consume you?
[03:03:47.287 --> 03:03:54.173]  I mean, why not just lie down in the ditch and be trendy and do what they say and pretend you're a winner and let them laugh at you and control your life?
[03:03:54.173 --> 03:03:55.394]  I think that's the right thing to do.
[03:03:55.394 --> 03:04:02.000]  I think it's not a good idea to stand up and actually take your health in your own hands, your ideologies in your own hands and have your own brain.
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:07.364]  I think it's good to be consumed and get upset that Staples isn't open on Black Friday like so many people are.
[03:04:07.364 --> 03:04:09.106]  And that's one of the stories I want to talk about.
[03:04:09.206 --> 03:04:14.170]  I also want to talk about, you know, just seizing commercial property to house migrants is good too.
[03:04:14.170 --> 03:04:16.612]  That's not stealing, that's fine.
[03:04:16.612 --> 03:04:22.216]  Yeah, and what's ruining relationships is now partners using their cell phone instead of talking to each other.
[03:04:22.216 --> 03:04:24.078]  A new study confirms, and it's making people depressed.
[03:04:24.378 --> 03:04:25.740]  All part of the dehumanization.
[03:04:25.740 --> 03:04:26.161]  Absolutely.
[03:04:26.161 --> 03:04:29.285]  So it's a plan, obviously, but people don't seem to realize it.
[03:04:29.285 --> 03:04:30.086]  And I think it's good, though.
[03:04:30.086 --> 03:04:31.688]  We should just be on our cell phones.
[03:04:31.688 --> 03:04:33.591]  Actually, we shouldn't be talking on the radio right now.
[03:04:33.591 --> 03:04:34.832]  We should just be texting.
[03:04:34.832 --> 03:04:36.735]  Well, it's racist against texting.
[03:04:36.735 --> 03:04:37.536]  It is actually racist.
[03:04:37.536 --> 03:04:40.139]  Well, it's kind of a patriarchal deal because it belonged to the past.
[03:04:40.620 --> 03:04:44.104]  Yeah, migrant texters are what we should be focused on.
[03:04:44.104 --> 03:04:48.909]  Well, and again, it is an open invasion when you bring in people and then take people's houses for them.
[03:04:48.909 --> 03:04:51.631]  That is the definition of genocide.
[03:04:51.631 --> 03:04:58.378]  That is the definition of an override, which is now happening by the folks that hate our guts that run the civilization, who are mortal enemies.
[03:04:59.199 --> 03:05:01.020]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com.
[03:05:01.020 --> 03:05:06.204]  Now, armed Air Force vet was prevented from stopping Oregon gunman, article up by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:05:06.204 --> 03:05:15.089]  An Air Force veteran who had a licensed concealed carry gun was prevented by staff from intervening in the shooting yesterday at the Oregon Community College during which 10 people were killed.
[03:05:15.089 --> 03:05:19.092]  John Parker was situated in a building about 200 yards away from where the shooting began.
[03:05:19.092 --> 03:05:22.554]  There were a few people in the vet center and then we heard the shooting happened.
[03:05:22.554 --> 03:05:25.016]  We got up and we were going to go over and see what we could do.
[03:05:25.396 --> 03:05:28.779]  Immediately, the school staff stopped us and told us to get inside of the building.
[03:05:28.779 --> 03:05:31.441]  Essentially, the staff wouldn't let us go to assist.
[03:05:31.441 --> 03:05:37.665]  One courageous man who also tried to apprehend the shooter, Army veteran Chris Mintz, ended up being shot five times.
[03:05:37.665 --> 03:05:38.926]  Mintz was unarmed.
[03:05:38.926 --> 03:05:45.211]  In asserting his right to conceal carry, Parker was knowingly violating a rule which declared the college to be a gun-free zone.
[03:05:45.211 --> 03:05:48.734]  This is why we need to arm our students.
[03:05:48.734 --> 03:05:55.119]  I guarantee you, the students in Oregon wish they had the ability to be able to defend themselves and those around them.

[03:08:03.802 --> 03:08:06.586]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:14.486 --> 03:08:16.408]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:16.408 --> 03:08:18.890]  This is the fourth hour of Overdrive.
[03:08:18.890 --> 03:08:20.752]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi, your host.
[03:08:20.752 --> 03:08:35.464]  We're going to open up the phone lines, cover more news, talk about the decline of society, talk about the new relationship killer, which is couples not talking to each other anymore and just sitting on their cell phone, and it's called fubbing.
[03:08:36.465 --> 03:08:38.847]  And a new study says it's ruining relationships.
[03:08:38.847 --> 03:08:48.474]  We're going to talk about Google executives saying that with robots and our brains will be godlike and a new app that will let you rate real-life human beings.
[03:08:49.471 --> 03:08:51.492]  Lots of interesting news.
[03:08:51.492 --> 03:08:52.632]  The phone number is 800-259-9231.
[03:08:52.632 --> 03:08:53.652]  800-259-9231.
[03:08:53.652 --> 03:09:01.274]  I'm going to be going to your calls throughout the hour.
[03:09:01.274 --> 03:09:14.057]  And, you know, stories like these remind me, and I was just looking at some stories before I came on the air today, about the complete enslavement of our brains on a societal and individual level.
[03:09:15.111 --> 03:09:24.100]  You know, it's pretty quick to turn from a consumer to being eaten by the corporations that we are supposedly consuming.
[03:09:24.100 --> 03:09:28.705]  And it's about this story, too, really kind of put me on that track.
[03:09:28.705 --> 03:09:30.987]  Staples will remain closed on Thanksgiving Day.
[03:09:30.987 --> 03:09:35.091]  Quote, we want our customers and associates to enjoy Thanksgiving their own way.
[03:09:36.112 --> 03:09:40.337]  They're closed on Thanksgiving Day, which should be, you know, a normal thing.
[03:09:40.337 --> 03:09:52.250]  But if you think about it, you think about the path that we've gone on to Black Friday starting the day before, starting lines, starting two weeks ahead of time, just so they can save 30% on a television.
[03:09:53.672 --> 03:10:07.249]  And it really, it's messed up at a consumer sense and a corporate sense in the way that they brainwashed everyone with their marketing techniques that they need to get that television in the first place, but also think about the reality that we have failed to even do basic math anymore.
[03:10:08.237 --> 03:10:14.322]  We can't even understand that, let's say, the first five people get 40% off of television, that's $300.
[03:10:14.322 --> 03:10:29.615]  Well, after those five people, the deals aren't even that good, because they raise the prices anyway, and then the discounts are crap, and you end up saving like $20 by sitting in a line for hours or days, apparently sometimes weeks.
[03:10:29.615 --> 03:10:34.360]  So it's a cost analysis that we can't even do anymore, because we have been reduced
[03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:39.981]  At such a mind-wave level that we can't even do the most basic levels of analysis.
[03:10:39.981 --> 03:10:51.083]  It's just like if you will go to a Best Buy, let's say, and, oh, well, this television for $600 has this feature, which is a little bit better than the one for $400.
[03:10:51.083 --> 03:10:53.444]  You're like, oh, sure, well, I'll just spend $200 more.
[03:10:53.444 --> 03:10:54.624]  It's a better television.
[03:10:54.624 --> 03:10:59.865]  But then you'll drive around for 10 extra miles in order to save 3 cents on gas.
[03:11:01.072 --> 03:11:05.194]  We can't even do basic valuations in our brains anymore.
[03:11:05.194 --> 03:11:08.516]  But it also comes at an individual level.
[03:11:08.516 --> 03:11:24.766]  Fubbing Ruining Relationship Study says, this is from Fox News, the act of ignoring someone in a social setting by looking at your phone instead, partner phone snubbing, is leading to higher levels of depression and ruining relationships, researchers at Baylor University in Texas have found.
[03:11:25.606 --> 03:11:34.030]  Phone snubbing or fubbing was found to create conflict among partners leading to low levels of reported relationship satisfaction.
[03:11:34.030 --> 03:11:41.094]  These lower levels of relationship satisfaction in turn led to lower levels of life satisfaction and ultimately higher levels of depression.
[03:11:42.369 --> 03:11:57.005]  We can't even have a conversation with our relationship partners anymore because we're too busy on our cell phones, phone snubbing or fubbing, which is such a... I kind of like that word now, fubbing.
[03:11:57.005 --> 03:11:59.628]  You guys are just fubbing everywhere.
[03:11:59.628 --> 03:12:04.313]  So we're too busy on our cell phones that we can't even hold a conversation with another human being.
[03:12:05.282 --> 03:12:12.051]  And it's making people depressed because it feels like their girlfriends or boyfriends or whatever, they don't even pay attention to them anymore.
[03:12:12.742 --> 03:12:13.882]  I see this all the time.
[03:12:13.882 --> 03:12:15.243]  I was at a restaurant the other day.
[03:12:15.243 --> 03:12:17.363]  I was sitting there talking to somebody.
[03:12:17.363 --> 03:12:23.924]  You don't have to talk the entire meal, but you look across the room and there's a couple and they don't even talk one time.
[03:12:23.924 --> 03:12:37.367]  They're too busy taking out their cell phone, checking it compulsively, even though no one's probably texting them, and then doing whatever, using whatever app or Snapchat or something for the whole entire dinner, that they're so locked into the Borg system, they can't even have a real
[03:12:38.356 --> 03:12:40.939]  Communication with anyone, any human being.
[03:12:40.939 --> 03:12:44.343]  And it kind of reminds me of why everyone's so afraid of silence.
[03:12:45.387 --> 03:13:04.893]  Have you noticed that everyone, everyone is so awkward, so awkward now they can't even have a real conversation with you, and it's partially because everyone is locked into cell phones and everyone watching others online makes them feel like they have a relationship with other people online but they don't have any actual real relationship in the real world.
[03:13:04.893 --> 03:13:10.635]  But anyway, if you are sitting at a dinner table and there's silence or a regular conversation for just a second,
[03:13:11.275 --> 03:13:13.818]  It gets weird, and someone has to take their cell phone out.
[03:13:13.818 --> 03:13:17.803]  They take out their cell phone, they start texting, like, oh my god, there's a moment of silence, what am I gonna do?
[03:13:17.803 --> 03:13:19.725]  It's so embarrassing!
[03:13:19.725 --> 03:13:25.432]  People can't even hold a regular conversation anymore, but that's okay.
[03:13:25.432 --> 03:13:29.556]  Because this Google executive says that with robots in our brains, we'll be godlike.
[03:13:30.137 --> 03:13:35.719]  Because the robot CPUs that we use in our cell phones are helping us be god-like too.
[03:13:35.719 --> 03:13:40.041]  It's helping us be social anxiety-driven hive minds.
[03:13:40.041 --> 03:13:42.122]  Google Exec, with robots in our brains, will be god-like.
[03:13:42.122 --> 03:13:43.542]  This is from CNET.
[03:13:43.542 --> 03:13:52.026]  Futurist and Google Exec Ray Kurzweil thinks that once we have robotic implants, we'll be funnier, sexier, and more loving, because that's what artificial intelligence can do for you.
[03:13:53.468 --> 03:14:04.760]  And, you know, I'm sure if we had chips in our brains there could be some benefits, absolutely, but we would most likely be giving away our humanity and just further fubbing ourselves, as they call it.
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:09.706]  Yelp for People app will let you rate real-life human beings from Entertainment Weekly.
[03:14:10.580 --> 03:14:12.461]  Imagine you're about to go on a first date.
[03:14:12.461 --> 03:14:16.262]  You Yelp the restaurant naturally to make sure it has something edible on the menu.
[03:14:16.262 --> 03:14:20.022]  Then you Google the person naturally to make sure they're not obnoxious on social media.
[03:14:20.022 --> 03:14:21.043]  Simple enough.
[03:14:21.043 --> 03:14:31.485]  In a perhaps inevitable new development, these two perfectly innocuous internet searches are coming together in Peeple, P-E-P-L-E, an app that will allow you to rate and search other human beings.
[03:14:31.485 --> 03:14:34.646]  It's Yelp for people and it's coming in November.
[03:14:34.646 --> 03:14:36.807]  Let me tell you why this could be the biggest disaster ever.
[03:14:37.904 --> 03:14:39.665]  And the worst idea ever.
[03:14:39.665 --> 03:15:01.494]  Because, number one, Yelp is well known to be highly corrupt, and I know people that run businesses and use Yelp, and according to these sources and documentaries that have come out, Yelp really is a pay-for-play type deal, in the sense that if you advertise with them, they sometimes apparently get rid of bad reviews and all sorts of things like that.
[03:15:01.494 --> 03:15:03.095]  You can look it up online.
[03:15:03.095 --> 03:15:04.396]  Imagine a website
[03:15:05.396 --> 03:15:09.618]  That is driven by rating other human beings.
[03:15:09.618 --> 03:15:21.784]  And not only the libel consequences, the slander consequences, your ex-girlfriend hates you and wants to write a review about how insane you are and how you, you know, killed the Easter Bunny or whatever.
[03:15:21.784 --> 03:15:29.748]  All of the possible things that could go on with the payment systems, paying for better reviews, the popularity contest of the Internet.
[03:15:29.748 --> 03:15:32.029]  Totally insane, terrible idea.
[03:15:33.160 --> 03:15:35.082]  New Yelp that will rate people.
[03:15:35.082 --> 03:15:36.323]  And yeah, here's an article.
[03:15:36.323 --> 03:15:37.384]  Think Yelp is unbiased?
[03:15:37.384 --> 03:15:38.925]  Think again from Forbes.
[03:15:38.925 --> 03:15:43.710]  Many of us rely on Yelp advice on restaurants, direct cleaners, retailers, handymen, blah blah blah.
[03:15:43.710 --> 03:15:47.934]  Nothing could be farther from the truth in terms, this is from Forbes on their rating system.
[03:15:47.934 --> 03:15:48.534]  It's true.
[03:15:48.534 --> 03:15:49.115]  It's actually true.
[03:15:49.115 --> 03:15:54.100]  You can go on and find out that Yelp is pretty much, in many people's opinions, a major scam.
[03:15:55.691 --> 03:15:57.812]  Grocery-carrying robots come with new homes.
[03:15:57.812 --> 03:15:59.453]  Some of these things are good, though.
[03:15:59.453 --> 03:16:02.434]  I mean, you know, we could actually use probably grocery-carrying robots.
[03:16:02.434 --> 03:16:15.340]  But all it does, though, at the same time as we have these luxuries that we enjoy, is further devolve us into human caricatures of ourselves that can't do anything like carry our own groceries.
[03:16:15.340 --> 03:16:20.003]  We can't do anything like have a real relationship because we're too busy on our cell phones.
[03:16:20.683 --> 03:16:22.503]  Pretending that we have something to do.
[03:16:22.503 --> 03:16:23.404]  We're just too busy.
[03:16:23.404 --> 03:16:24.444]  We're too busy.
[03:16:24.444 --> 03:16:25.544]  We're too busy.
[03:16:25.544 --> 03:16:26.384]  We have stuff to do.
[03:16:26.384 --> 03:16:28.885]  We can't be talking to real human beings.
[03:16:28.885 --> 03:16:31.666]  RoboCab driverless taxi experiment to start in Japan.
[03:16:31.666 --> 03:16:36.007]  It seems like there's every one of these articles seems like it's robots coming in to do more stuff.
[03:16:36.007 --> 03:16:38.787]  Driverless taxi experiment to start in Japan.
[03:16:38.787 --> 03:16:40.788]  Driverless cars can't even drive anymore.
[03:16:40.788 --> 03:16:42.348]  We just can't do anything.
[03:16:42.348 --> 03:16:43.048]  We really can't.
[03:16:43.048 --> 03:16:46.189]  We just are just human slug creatures that sit around
[03:16:47.367 --> 03:16:52.629]  And look for brain implants and go on our cell phones and don't talk to other human beings.
[03:16:52.629 --> 03:16:53.929]  Now let's take some calls.
[03:16:53.929 --> 03:16:56.250]  Let's jump into some calls before we go to the break.
[03:16:56.250 --> 03:17:02.772]  Let's go ahead and talk to Anthony in Florida.
[03:17:02.772 --> 03:17:06.033]  How's it going, man?
[03:17:06.033 --> 03:17:06.793]  Hello?
[03:17:06.793 --> 03:17:08.694]  Hey, Anthony in Florida, you're on the air.
[03:17:08.694 --> 03:17:10.414]  What's on your mind?
[03:17:10.414 --> 03:17:13.315]  Hey, can't believe I already got through.
[03:17:15.692 --> 03:17:45.196]  I was hoping to speak with Alex, but I received a phone call from Midas Resources a few hours ago, and they told me that they're no longer able to sell gold in their estate, and that they're going to be refunding me my money.
[03:17:47.092 --> 03:17:55.977]  And they're going to be laying off the young lady that was working there for 14 years.
[03:17:55.977 --> 03:17:59.059]  I was wondering if you guys knew anything.
[03:17:59.059 --> 03:18:00.079]  I personally do not.
[03:18:00.079 --> 03:18:07.043]  It probably would be a better question for maybe Alex or I guess we'll ask the producers if they know anything, but I unfortunately do not know anything about that.
[03:18:07.043 --> 03:18:08.384]  That is unfortunate to hear.
[03:18:08.384 --> 03:18:10.705]  I am sorry to hear that.
[03:18:10.705 --> 03:18:12.046]  Let's jump on the next call.
[03:18:12.046 --> 03:18:14.848]  Let's go to Mia in Kansas.
[03:18:14.848 --> 03:18:15.408]  What's on your mind?
[03:18:17.031 --> 03:18:18.612]  Hi, actually, it's Maya.
[03:18:18.612 --> 03:18:20.854]  Maya, I deeply apologize, Maya.
[03:18:20.854 --> 03:18:21.775]  Oh, that's okay.
[03:18:21.775 --> 03:18:23.657]  I'm glad to hear you.
[03:18:23.657 --> 03:18:25.038]  Here's the question.
[03:18:25.038 --> 03:18:27.280]  Let me start it this way.
[03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:34.526]  I'm in a relationship where my husband... Boy, I hope I'm not giving away too much here.
[03:18:34.526 --> 03:18:36.507]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:18:36.507 --> 03:18:44.193]  My husband is not as concerned or as focused on what's happening around us today.
[03:18:46.697 --> 03:18:50.180]  I don't consider myself a conspiracy theorist.
[03:18:50.180 --> 03:18:53.142]  I consider myself someone who is paying attention.
[03:18:53.142 --> 03:18:54.483]  I watch news.
[03:18:54.483 --> 03:19:00.627]  I read because I am concerned and frightened.
[03:19:00.627 --> 03:19:09.073]  He is holding totally the opposite reaction to this and this could be a really big problem in the future because it affects how you prepare.
[03:19:09.073 --> 03:19:11.214]  It affects how you purchase.
[03:19:11.214 --> 03:19:14.837]  It affects everything in your life when your partner is not
[03:19:15.427 --> 03:19:41.313]  on the same page and so when you started talking about the telephone and the cell phone and how it distances couples I found that to be really interesting because part of the concern or part of the issue that's going to come up should we get worse rather than better and I see worse coming first is how do we deal with the members of our family especially the close ones who are not
[03:19:43.124 --> 03:19:45.226]  You know what?
[03:19:45.226 --> 03:19:46.126]  This is a great call.
[03:19:46.126 --> 03:19:46.886]  Maya, stay there.
[03:19:46.886 --> 03:19:48.267]  I want to talk to you after the break.
[03:19:48.267 --> 03:19:49.868]  This is a great question.
[03:19:49.868 --> 03:19:53.810]  We'll be right back with some more news and take some more calls and talk to Maya.

[03:24:11.923 --> 03:24:15.924]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show in Overdrive.
[03:24:15.924 --> 03:24:19.345]  This is Anthony Gucciardi, your host, for the rest of the hour.
[03:24:19.345 --> 03:24:25.407]  We're talking about societal decline, the collapse of what makes us really function as human beings.
[03:24:25.407 --> 03:24:34.289]  The ability to communicate, the ability to associate with other human beings, the ability to do things without robots that are going to carry in your groceries.
[03:24:34.289 --> 03:24:37.570]  We've got a caller on the line that I want to go back to in a second, and she called in
[03:24:38.570 --> 03:24:42.898]  And she was talking about, hey, I have a husband that just doesn't seem to get it.
[03:24:42.898 --> 03:24:43.879]  He doesn't seem to care.
[03:24:43.879 --> 03:24:45.081]  He doesn't want to be awakened.
[03:24:45.081 --> 03:24:51.672]  He's definitely not awake and he doesn't seem to be conscious to these things that are going on and it's a tough position to be in.
[03:24:52.714 --> 03:24:59.939]  And you know, Maya is the caller, I've been in the exact situation where it's the opposite, where a girlfriend of mine really just didn't care.
[03:24:59.939 --> 03:25:10.245]  You know, she thought it was stupid to care, and she kind of bought into the whole system ideology that, you know, you're just really a nerd if you care about any of that stuff, and history's boring, you know.
[03:25:10.245 --> 03:25:18.551]  And it's not that she was really stupid or anything like that, it was just that it's easy to fall into what the system kind of comforts you with.
[03:25:18.931 --> 03:25:37.637]  That it's okay to just suck on the teat of, really, system ideology, which is, everything's fine, let's just go back to sleep, it's not a big deal, you know, most people in the government are just good, the corporations are just good, companies make some mistakes sometimes, but overall, it's overall fine, you're just making a big deal out of nothing.
[03:25:38.763 --> 03:25:47.315]  And not to, you know, I mean ultimately we have to have a good outlook overall that we're going to have victory and that there are a lot of good people out there.
[03:25:47.315 --> 03:25:54.044]  But it's also, it's silly to not identify the problems that are going on so we can actually go ahead and fix them.
[03:25:54.044 --> 03:25:55.446]  Maya, you were talking about
[03:25:56.462 --> 03:25:58.282]  Your husband not getting it.
[03:25:58.282 --> 03:26:04.484]  And I think there are ways in which you can help that, obviously, by showing him something that he can be passionate about.
[03:26:04.484 --> 03:26:08.804]  Because most people, the problem I find, is they're just not passionate about anything.
[03:26:08.804 --> 03:26:17.746]  So when they sit there and they say, everything's fine, or, you know, you're crazy, or whatever, it's because they've never actually found something that they're passionate about doing.
[03:26:17.746 --> 03:26:21.547]  So they don't understand that drive that you have to help people and inform other people.
[03:26:22.327 --> 03:26:39.015]  There is definitely a war on our ability, whether it's from the health front, with the toxic substances we're exposed to on a daily basis dumbing us down, or the ideological front, which it's really tough to not get brought into the comfort of watching television all day.
[03:26:39.015 --> 03:26:42.797]  Maya, so tell us what happens when you talk to your husband and you say, hey, look, things are going on.
[03:26:42.797 --> 03:26:44.458]  Does he just not care, say you're crazy?
[03:26:44.458 --> 03:26:46.538]  What happens?
[03:26:46.538 --> 03:26:47.099]  Hello?
[03:26:47.099 --> 03:26:47.499]  Hey, yep.
[03:26:48.621 --> 03:26:50.042]  Oh, okay, great, okay.
[03:26:50.042 --> 03:26:52.885]  Yeah, I wanted to try and stop you because I agree with you.
[03:26:52.885 --> 03:27:11.322]  I think that is partially what's happening, but I also think what's happening is the reality that with everything that's being put upon America today, and I also believe that a good portion of it is intentional, that a lot of Americans have become so overloaded
[03:27:11.775 --> 03:27:13.996]  That they choose not to think.
[03:27:13.996 --> 03:27:20.018]  They're not denying what's happening, but their brain is just shutting down.
[03:27:20.018 --> 03:27:24.960]  And it's almost easier, it's the frog in the pot syndrome.
[03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:25.880]  Oh, it's 100% right.
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:26.841]  I mean, if you work a 9 to 5 job...
[03:27:27.941 --> 03:27:47.664]  If you wake up in the morning and you have to get ready, you have to, you know, do your daily routine, take the dogs out, whatever, go to work, get yelled at by your boss all day or whatever you do when you're 9 to 5 and it's tough and it really exerts your brain, you're using your brain all day, you're not in a conscious state, you're not trying to do things that are actually beneficial to you, you don't worry about your own growth or anything like that, you're just kind of giving yourself
[03:27:48.204 --> 03:27:51.107]  Up to the nine-to-five corporation, then you get home, and what do you have to do?
[03:27:51.107 --> 03:27:52.388]  You have to deal with your relationship.
[03:27:52.388 --> 03:27:53.689]  You have to deal with the home stuff.
[03:27:53.689 --> 03:27:55.090]  Your house is falling apart.
[03:27:55.090 --> 03:27:55.850]  You don't have money.
[03:27:55.850 --> 03:27:56.671]  You gotta pay taxes.
[03:27:56.671 --> 03:27:58.272]  You don't have money for the bills.
[03:27:58.272 --> 03:28:03.537]  All those things are absolutely gonna hit you like a brick in the head, and there's not a lot of energy left after that.
[03:28:04.947 --> 03:28:10.351]  And also you're stuck then with the reality that the world is going to hell in a handbasket.
[03:28:10.351 --> 03:28:14.795]  That there's a president who seems to be not incompetent.
[03:28:14.795 --> 03:28:27.104]  As a matter of fact, I'm someone who insists that this is not incompetence that we're looking at, but we are watching as all of the things that even at their most imperfect
[03:28:27.626 --> 03:28:40.051]  We relied on and trusted in, because of the Constitution, because of the documents that made this country possible, we're watching it being dismantled.
[03:28:40.051 --> 03:28:49.054]  And then we're watching the servants, who were supposed to be working for us, turn around and actually provide the ammunition to do it.
[03:28:49.054 --> 03:28:52.835]  And nothing is more defeating than the feeling that you can't do anything about it.
[03:28:52.835 --> 03:28:54.776]  There's nothing in this world that's more defeating.
[03:28:55.680 --> 03:28:57.962]  Just like a plane going down.
[03:28:57.962 --> 03:29:02.846]  Then the concept of understanding that there's nothing I can do about this problem.
[03:29:02.846 --> 03:29:11.694]  That is the worst feeling in the world and that's why millions of people are depressed and feel like crap every single day after they get home and they have to go through work all day.
[03:29:11.694 --> 03:29:16.077]  They don't have enough money and then they get home and they realize the system is so screwed up.
[03:29:16.798 --> 03:29:23.020]  They realized that an article that just flashed on screen, I remember, this woman was told by her psychologist to pour bleach in her eyes because she wanted to be blind.
[03:29:23.020 --> 03:29:24.320]  She was mentally ill.
[03:29:24.320 --> 03:29:27.381]  Talk about the robot chips in our brain, all this crazy stuff.
[03:29:27.381 --> 03:29:29.882]  How are you supposed to possibly survive all this?
[03:29:29.882 --> 03:29:31.902]  How are you supposed to get over all this?
[03:29:31.902 --> 03:29:34.603]  I'm going to talk about some solutions coming up in the next segment.
[03:29:34.603 --> 03:29:38.564]  This is Anthony Gucciardi with the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:38.564 --> 03:29:40.065]  Stay tuned, Faking More Calls.
[03:29:40.065 --> 03:29:41.025]  This is going to be a powerful show.
[03:29:48.621 --> 03:29:51.626]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:51.626 --> 03:29:55.231]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:59.246 --> 03:30:03.128]  Just when you think the government couldn't get any more ludicrous, the U.S.
[03:30:03.128 --> 03:30:11.031]  Environmental Protection Agency has taken to social media to point out the harmful effects of sunny days on plant life.
[03:30:11.031 --> 03:30:11.751]  That's right.
[03:30:11.751 --> 03:30:15.153]  The agency tweeted, Think sunny days are good for plants?
[03:30:15.153 --> 03:30:16.093]  Not always.
[03:30:16.093 --> 03:30:20.635]  Sunlight causes ozone to form, which harms foliage and weakens trees.
[03:30:21.115 --> 03:30:27.397]  Makes you wonder, how did the planet survive for millennia before a big bloated government came along to protect it?
[03:30:27.397 --> 03:30:38.601]  Let's just point out the absurdity of the EPA highlighting the alleged danger of sunlight as the world is facing numerous legitimate environmental issues, some of which have been caused by the agency itself.
[03:30:38.601 --> 03:30:48.064]  Let's not forget this is the same agency that polluted the Animas River with more than 3 million gallons of toxic waste last month in an effort to cover up that disaster.
[03:30:48.544 --> 03:30:52.969]  EPA officials refused to provide data to the press on the extent of the damage.
[03:30:52.969 --> 03:30:59.095]  Read the article, Obama's EPA warns sunlight dangerous to plants at InfoWars.com.
[03:30:59.095 --> 03:31:02.598]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:02.598 --> 03:31:07.223]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[03:31:07.483 --> 03:31:07.883]  We're good.
[03:31:28.985 --> 03:31:30.085]  BrainForce is here.
[03:31:30.085 --> 03:31:32.286]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[03:31:32.286 --> 03:31:37.288]  You've probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy, and it's because of BrainForce.
[03:31:37.288 --> 03:31:40.569]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[03:31:40.569 --> 03:31:44.050]  Staring at the computer all day, working, doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[03:31:44.050 --> 03:31:46.031]  Ultimately, we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[03:31:46.031 --> 03:31:48.151]  It doesn't have stimulants, it doesn't have garbage in it.
[03:31:48.151 --> 03:31:50.152]  It has natural things that do it clean.
[03:31:50.152 --> 03:31:55.734]  You will find BrainForce and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:31:58.735 --> 03:32:04.501]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[03:32:04.501 --> 03:32:18.935]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fuse it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[03:32:19.195 --> 03:32:27.201]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[03:32:27.201 --> 03:32:32.625]  And when you visit Infowarslife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[03:32:32.625 --> 03:32:36.327]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[03:32:36.327 --> 03:32:40.470]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[03:32:40.470 --> 03:32:44.333]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[03:32:44.773 --> 03:32:48.898]  Liver Shield can also be used daily by itself for overall upkeep of the liver.
[03:32:48.898 --> 03:32:53.964]  Secure your Liver Shield today exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com for the lowest price available.
[03:32:53.964 --> 03:32:55.807]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:33:00.397 --> 03:33:05.940]  I feel like this all the time, trying to politically awaken people that they're being lied to, that there's an agenda.
[03:33:05.940 --> 03:33:06.960]  It's not left or right.
[03:33:06.960 --> 03:33:09.442]  It's, hey, there's mind control going on.
[03:33:09.442 --> 03:33:12.943]  The signal's broadcast 24 hours a day through all this media.
[03:33:12.943 --> 03:33:15.925]  Just become aware of it, and they'll say, there's nothing going on.
[03:33:15.925 --> 03:33:20.027]  And I want to say, put on these glasses or start chewing concrete!
[03:33:25.503 --> 03:33:31.045]  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.
[03:33:31.045 --> 03:33:33.766]  They have recruited the rich and the powerful!
[03:33:33.766 --> 03:33:36.446]  And they have blinded us to the truth!
[03:33:36.446 --> 03:33:39.447]  The question is, do we all work for central bankers?
[03:33:39.447 --> 03:33:41.688]  That's what I want to address to our guest tonight.
[03:33:41.688 --> 03:33:45.329]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[03:33:45.329 --> 03:33:50.551]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[03:33:50.971 --> 03:33:57.577]  An estimated 50 to 70 million Americans suffer from a sleep disorder or sleep deprivation.
[03:33:57.577 --> 03:34:07.707]  Outside the limit of our sight, feeding off us, perched on top of us, from birth to death, are our owners!
[03:34:07.707 --> 03:34:14.614]  Latest census numbers prove the United States has the biggest gap between rich and poor compared to all westernized countries today.
[03:34:15.074 --> 03:34:25.797]  Our projections show that by the year 2025, not only America, but the entire planet will be under the protection and the dominion of this power alliance.
[03:34:25.797 --> 03:34:37.521]  The gains have been substantial, both for ourselves and for you, the human power elite.
[03:34:37.521 --> 03:34:41.102]  And for the first time in all of human history,
[03:34:43.596 --> 03:34:46.198]  Mankind is politically awakened.
[03:34:46.198 --> 03:34:48.840]  That's a total new reality.
[03:34:48.840 --> 03:34:51.721]  I've got one that can see.
[03:34:51.721 --> 03:34:54.203]  We can't be the only ones who can see.
[03:34:54.203 --> 03:35:04.930]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's got at the root of all our problems.
[03:35:04.930 --> 03:35:06.371]  It's a new morning in America.
[03:35:07.054 --> 03:35:07.975]  Fresh.
[03:35:07.975 --> 03:35:08.995]  Vital.
[03:35:08.995 --> 03:35:11.276]  The old cynicism is gone.
[03:35:11.276 --> 03:35:13.818]  We have faith in our leaders.
[03:35:13.818 --> 03:35:18.180]  We're optimistic as to what becomes of it all.
[03:35:18.180 --> 03:35:21.942]  It really boils down to our ability to accept.
[03:35:21.942 --> 03:35:23.983]  We don't need pessimism.
[03:35:23.983 --> 03:35:26.904]  I have two words for you.
[03:35:26.904 --> 03:35:27.945]  Predator drones.
[03:35:27.945 --> 03:35:34.348]  And who are you, little fella?
[03:35:34.348 --> 03:35:35.409]  You will never see it coming.
[03:35:36.218 --> 03:35:44.598]  I'm predicting the first guy who uses a Second Amendment weapon to bring a drone down that's been hovering over his house is going to be a folk hero in this country.
[03:35:49.260 --> 03:35:58.808]  I'm just trying to warn you folks that television is a giant LED weapon system.
[03:35:58.808 --> 03:36:00.630]  It's so advanced.
[03:36:00.630 --> 03:36:02.552]  They got a monkey farm in Bastrop, folks.
[03:36:02.552 --> 03:36:06.695]  They do all sorts of testing on great apes, rhesus monkeys, the whole nine yards.
[03:36:06.695 --> 03:36:12.601]  And they go, oh, you didn't see this, and punch a button and it'd be hundreds of monkeys with wires in their brains with television sets brainwashing them.
[03:36:13.792 --> 03:36:17.334]  All I ever have to do is be famous.
[03:36:17.334 --> 03:36:18.515]  People watch me.
[03:36:18.515 --> 03:36:20.376]  And they love me.
[03:36:20.376 --> 03:36:22.377]  You can have a little taste of that good life, too.
[03:36:22.377 --> 03:36:23.518]  I know you want it.
[03:36:23.518 --> 03:36:25.439]  Hell, everybody does.
[03:36:25.439 --> 03:36:27.820]  Do it to your own kind.
[03:36:27.820 --> 03:36:29.421]  What's the threat?
[03:36:29.421 --> 03:36:31.142]  We all sell out every day.
[03:36:31.142 --> 03:36:32.983]  Might as well be on the winning team.
[03:36:32.983 --> 03:36:40.508]  The real men of the world have to stand up and say, I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass.
[03:36:42.355 --> 03:36:45.437]  I'm all out of bubble gum.
[03:36:45.437 --> 03:36:48.038]  Time to take a stand, boys.
[03:36:48.038 --> 03:36:48.738]  You know what?
[03:36:48.738 --> 03:36:50.399]  You got a little courage.
[03:36:50.399 --> 03:36:53.681]  Stand up for yourself.
[03:36:53.681 --> 03:36:56.282]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:36:56.282 --> 03:37:02.746]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[03:37:02.746 --> 03:37:09.129]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat as... Long live the Republic!
[03:37:14.972 --> 03:37:21.317]  That's right, it is time to stand up and it is time to take your reality into your own hands.
[03:37:21.317 --> 03:37:26.340]  And this is Anthony Gucciardi for the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:37:26.340 --> 03:37:33.765]  Last segment we took a caller who was talking about her significant other not wanting to be awakened, not caring about being conscious, not caring about what was going on.
[03:37:33.765 --> 03:37:40.430]  And we talked about how a lot of us work all day and we don't have enough energy at the end of the day to even care.
[03:37:40.430 --> 03:37:41.311]  And at the same time,
[03:37:42.376 --> 03:37:45.136]  We feel defeated because of all the insanity that's going on.
[03:37:46.647 --> 03:37:53.052]  I believe that it is extremely challenging to overcome the feeling of defeat with all the madness.
[03:37:53.052 --> 03:37:54.192]  I mean, we talked about it earlier.
[03:37:54.192 --> 03:38:01.077]  The chips that are going to go in our brains, the driverless cars, the grocery-carrying robots that are coming with new homes.
[03:38:01.077 --> 03:38:03.719]  Science says cell phone use could be hurting a relationship.
[03:38:03.719 --> 03:38:11.304]  Thubbing is the new thing that people can't even talk to their friends and family because they're too busy on their cell phones and it's ruining their relationships.
[03:38:11.304 --> 03:38:15.728]  Ultimately, I believe the answer is to, at an individual level,
[03:38:16.608 --> 03:38:18.529]  Be completely free of the system.
[03:38:18.529 --> 03:38:22.631]  And that does not mean going off the grid, you know, not getting anything.
[03:38:22.631 --> 03:38:30.154]  We can still all enjoy ourselves and not be completely insane, but getting out of the system's ideology that you're not worth enough.
[03:38:30.154 --> 03:38:35.056]  Because you are worth enough, and you are powerful enough to do whatever it is that you want to do.
[03:38:35.916 --> 03:38:45.346]  If you want to do something like start your own business, spend 20 minutes a day towards doing that, the system's main weapon is telling you that you are worthless.
[03:38:45.346 --> 03:38:52.113]  And that keeps you controlled and conformed because it molds you into an enslaved human being.
[03:38:52.714 --> 03:38:55.879]  That unfortunately many of which exist on this planet.
[03:38:55.879 --> 03:39:05.995]  Speaking of enslaved human beings, Ray Kurzweil also has a message that he would like to tell you and that is the next level of human enslavement is coming with brain chips.
[03:39:05.995 --> 03:39:06.896]  Let's listen to that video.
[03:39:08.362 --> 03:39:10.943]  We create our tools to extend our reach.
[03:39:10.943 --> 03:39:15.366]  We couldn't reach that fruit at that higher branch a thousand years ago, so we fashioned a tool.
[03:39:15.366 --> 03:39:21.249]  We then were able to create new tools with those tools and create a whole other evolutionary process.
[03:39:21.249 --> 03:39:28.793]  And we will literally expand not only the size of our neocortex, but the number of levels of abstraction.
[03:39:28.793 --> 03:39:34.276]  And those additional levels we added two million years ago enabled us to create music and art and humor.
[03:39:34.776 --> 03:39:37.679]  This is billions of times more powerful than the computer.
[03:39:37.679 --> 03:39:39.741]  I use this as an undergraduate per dollar.
[03:39:39.741 --> 03:39:42.663]  But that's not even the most interesting thing about it.
[03:39:42.663 --> 03:39:47.688]  If I want to access 10,000 computers for two seconds, I can do that wirelessly.
[03:39:47.688 --> 03:39:50.891]  It multiplies itself in the cloud 10,000-fold.
[03:39:50.891 --> 03:39:52.813]  That's what we're going to do with our neocortex.
[03:39:53.633 --> 03:40:00.517]  So, you know, I'm walking along and I see Larry Page coming and I say, ah, I better think of something clever to say.
[03:40:00.517 --> 03:40:03.579]  My 300 million modules in my neocortex isn't going to cut it.
[03:40:03.579 --> 03:40:06.601]  I need a billion for two seconds.
[03:40:06.601 --> 03:40:12.905]  I'll be able to access that in the cloud just like I can multiply the intelligence of my smartphone.
[03:40:13.678 --> 03:40:24.283]  Thousands full today, but we're going to add additional levels of abstraction and create more profound Means of expression, so we're going to be more musical.
[03:40:24.283 --> 03:40:25.263]  We're going to be funnier.
[03:40:25.263 --> 03:40:29.565]  We're going to be sexier Gonna be better at expressing loving sentiments.
[03:40:29.565 --> 03:40:39.330]  That's my vision of what we'll do with AI evolution creates structures and patterns that over time are
[03:40:40.296 --> 03:40:49.698]  More complicated, more knowledgeable, more intelligent, more creative, more capable of expressing higher sentiments like being loving.
[03:40:49.698 --> 03:40:56.860]  So it's moving in the direction that God has been described as having these qualities without limit.
[03:40:56.860 --> 03:41:01.621]  And so I think evolution is a spiritual process that makes us more God-like.
[03:41:01.621 --> 03:41:06.883]  And there is beauty and love and creativity, intelligence in the world.
[03:41:06.883 --> 03:41:08.243]  It all comes from the neocortex.
[03:41:09.364 --> 03:41:16.033]  And we're going to be able to expand the neocortex as I described, so we're going to become more god-like.
[03:41:16.033 --> 03:41:21.700]  We're all going to become gods with the new computer microchips implanted in your brain by Ray Kurzweil.
[03:41:22.588 --> 03:41:26.229]  You know, I'm not anti-advancements when it comes to science and technology.
[03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.869]  I think it's great.
[03:41:26.869 --> 03:41:28.069]  I'm all about optimization.
[03:41:28.069 --> 03:41:30.970]  That's why I try and have a super good health regimen.
[03:41:30.970 --> 03:41:33.910]  I try and take supplements that really boost your brain power.
[03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:37.671]  I try to do morning routines every single day and exercise in the right ways.
[03:41:37.671 --> 03:41:41.232]  I'm all about optimization, even productivity optimization.
[03:41:41.232 --> 03:41:45.672]  I use all the apps that I need to enhance my productivity and I love scientific advancement.
[03:41:45.672 --> 03:41:47.873]  I actually like driverless cars if it could be trusted.
[03:41:48.613 --> 03:41:52.975]  And, you know, I like a lot of things that are advancements that can be sometimes scary.
[03:41:52.975 --> 03:42:12.723]  But when it comes to putting computer chips in your brain that are owned and operated by a company that is a for-profit corporation that's been caught in the past doing some questionable things and integrated into a cloud, which is basically a free sharing flow of information that is stored on their servers,
[03:42:13.323 --> 03:42:23.929]  That obviously is extremely questionable, but then once it starts turning into, well, we're going to become gods through this technology, that's when it definitely turns much more cult-like.
[03:42:23.929 --> 03:42:40.700]  And there's a reason that super-intellectual, powerful thinkers like Elon Musk have already taken a stand, as well as top professors at universities and thousands of others who have signed along with his petition, to go up against the out-of-control creation of artificial intelligence.
[03:42:40.700 --> 03:42:42.321]  Because it's not a game.
[03:42:43.288 --> 03:42:50.678]  with the creation of artificial intelligence in such of the ways that Ray Kurzweil eventually, I believe it appears, wants to do.
[03:42:50.678 --> 03:42:59.610]  It's not a fun game to mess with and you're not anti-intellectual if you go up against and say, hey, I don't really want to have artificial intelligence in every single
[03:43:00.151 --> 03:43:02.512]  Yeah, I just wanted to touch base about the Hawaii, state of Hawaii.
[03:43:28.661 --> 03:43:29.603]  We're good to go.
[03:43:45.106 --> 03:43:49.528]  They're poisoning Hawaii with the GMO ground level testing over there.
[03:43:49.528 --> 03:43:57.932]  They've been doing it for 15 years and I think the Hawaiian people are pretty much getting sick of it and they want their sovereign Hawaii back.
[03:43:57.932 --> 03:43:58.713]  They want to take their
[03:43:59.648 --> 03:44:16.634]  They're state backed and it's been there for a hundred years they've occupied over there and you know they're leading by example for the rest of the world and you know touching base is basically uh yeah I just I just wanted to ask you what do you think about that or have you heard anything about Hawaii or
[03:44:17.605 --> 03:44:24.972]  You know, I know a lot of Hawaiians, I mean specifically in Maui where they enacted anti-GMO laws, are fed up for good reason.
[03:44:24.972 --> 03:44:27.415]  And we should all be fed up though because of the D.A.R.K.
[03:44:27.415 --> 03:44:31.739]  Act, which is coming and apparently it's going to be voted on October 7th by the Senate.
[03:44:31.739 --> 03:44:35.682]  So it's an act, it's ironically called the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act.
[03:44:36.283 --> 03:44:40.506]  And what it does is it bans GMO labeling from states.
[03:44:40.506 --> 03:44:46.190]  States can't enact mandatory GMO labeling, but it bans it at a federal level.
[03:44:46.190 --> 03:44:50.693]  So it already passed the House, and amazingly, right?
[03:44:50.693 --> 03:44:52.114]  Most of you probably don't even know what it is.
[03:44:52.114 --> 03:44:53.335]  Again, it's the Dark Acts.
[03:44:53.335 --> 03:44:56.196]  But now it's going to the Senate, so it may soon become a law.
[03:44:56.196 --> 03:45:04.162]  I guess next week they're set to vote on it, so that could become a law, and they'll just say states, you're not allowed to mandatory label GMOs anymore.
[03:45:04.602 --> 03:45:12.186]  So that would not only affect Hawaii, that would affect all the 50 states, and we would literally not be able to know what's in our food anymore.
[03:45:12.186 --> 03:45:22.551]  So there is definitely a statewide fight in Hawaii, there's Vermont enacted mandatory GMO labeling, but if this DARK Act passes, we will no longer be able to know
[03:45:23.516 --> 03:45:26.118]  At the state level, if we're eating GMOs anymore in our food.
[03:45:26.118 --> 03:45:28.800]  And in fact, doing so would be illegal.
[03:45:28.800 --> 03:45:33.644]  So states like Texas has a GMO labeling bill that's set to be voted on.
[03:45:33.644 --> 03:45:37.467]  If they pass it, then the Fed would come in and say, well, that's actually illegal.
[03:45:37.467 --> 03:45:42.431]  You're not allowed to label genetically modified organisms from Monsanto that are in the food supply.
[03:45:42.431 --> 03:45:49.956]  Even if your health experts say that it's a good idea, or that 95 plus percent of the United States wants GMO labeling, that's too bad.
[03:45:49.956 --> 03:45:51.237]  It does not matter.
[03:45:51.237 --> 03:45:52.558]  And of course, there's a reason
[03:45:53.579 --> 03:46:01.631]  That 96 plus percent of Monsanto shareholders, when asked in a vote if they would like to label GMOs, said absolutely not.
[03:46:01.631 --> 03:46:09.522]  See, 96 percent of the shareholders of Monsanto don't want to label it, but 95 plus percent of the United States public wants it labeled.
[03:46:10.003 --> 03:46:12.484]  You see the disparity there, right?
[03:46:12.484 --> 03:46:16.745]  It's obvious that if Monsanto had a product that was so great, they should want to label it.
[03:46:16.745 --> 03:46:17.465]  They should be proud!
[03:46:17.465 --> 03:46:28.329]  There should be a whole section of GMOs in the grocery store, so we can all know we're getting such an amazing product from the helm of Monsanto, where 90 plus percent of the corn supply is genetically modified.
[03:46:28.329 --> 03:46:30.530]  Alright, let's go to the next caller.
[03:46:30.530 --> 03:46:32.770]  Let's talk to Paul in New Mexico.
[03:46:32.770 --> 03:46:36.071]  Paul, are you there?
[03:46:36.071 --> 03:46:37.452]  Yeah, I wanted to say, like,
[03:46:38.353 --> 03:46:52.860]  I think society we're just like we're drinkers we're not thinkers anymore we just we want to be distracted because if we look inside ourselves we might not like what we see we're afraid to get in that quiet place and think about our lives because if we did that
[03:46:53.726 --> 03:46:57.709]  We might be, uh, not like what we see.
[03:46:57.709 --> 03:46:58.770]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:46:58.770 --> 03:46:59.211]  Absolutely.
[03:46:59.211 --> 03:47:08.198]  We have an ego in our brain that, you know, kind of constructs ourselves and our identities based on our experiences in life and sometimes in a calm,
[03:47:09.139 --> 03:47:16.264]  contemplative state, we freak out and experience some craziness because we can't come to terms with our own realities.
[03:47:16.264 --> 03:47:17.926]  And I've had to do that time and time again.
[03:47:17.926 --> 03:47:22.649]  It's one of the hardest things you can do is to actually sit down and analyze yourself.
[03:47:22.649 --> 03:47:24.871]  Because you might not like what you see, like you just said.
[03:47:24.871 --> 03:47:26.752]  And that's why not just alcohol.
[03:47:26.752 --> 03:47:27.092]  Why?
[03:47:27.092 --> 03:47:30.235]  Drinking alcohol feels great because it turns your brain off.
[03:47:30.235 --> 03:47:32.016]  It makes you more present in the moment.
[03:47:32.016 --> 03:47:33.517]  It makes you able a lot of times.
[03:47:33.517 --> 03:47:35.579]  Some people, it just makes them more upset.
[03:47:35.579 --> 03:47:37.961]  But for a lot of people, it makes them happier and it makes them
[03:47:38.641 --> 03:47:45.306]  Enjoy themselves more because their brain that always wants to be in the future or the past is shut off for a little while.
[03:47:45.306 --> 03:47:53.671]  So the number one cause of stress is wanting to do something that you're not able to do at that moment, wanting to go in the past and fix something, wanting to go in the future.
[03:47:53.671 --> 03:47:54.532]  You know, what about the future?
[03:47:54.532 --> 03:47:55.332]  What's going to be crazy?
[03:47:55.332 --> 03:47:56.413]  What am I going to do?
[03:47:56.413 --> 03:47:58.174]  Or reminiscing about the past in your brain.
[03:47:58.174 --> 03:48:02.177]  You're having your own internal dialogue all day for like 24 hours a day.
[03:48:02.177 --> 03:48:04.038]  Even you wake up in the middle of the night, I can't sleep.
[03:48:04.038 --> 03:48:04.678]  Why can't you sleep?
[03:48:04.678 --> 03:48:07.540]  Because you have your own internal dialogue in your brain.
[03:48:07.540 --> 03:48:08.141]  So what do we do?
[03:48:08.841 --> 03:48:21.105]  We satiate the body's desire to turn that off by drinking alcohol, by eating comfort foods that make us feel good, by watching television which shuts our brain off, by playing video games, whatever it is.
[03:48:21.105 --> 03:48:23.446]  And all these things in moderation, not a bad thing.
[03:48:23.446 --> 03:48:24.466]  But as long as you understand.
[03:48:25.583 --> 03:48:33.350]  That when you have a chronic addiction to any of those things, you're turning your brain off because you just can't handle actually thinking about all of it.
[03:48:33.350 --> 03:48:39.575]  And I understand and I feel for the people who do that, and I've done that before in my life, because it is crazy out there.
[03:48:39.575 --> 03:48:43.839]  All the stuff we talk about on a daily basis, it's easy to want to shut your brain off.
[03:48:43.839 --> 03:48:49.144]  It's easy to want to go home and turn on the television and just sit there and stare at it and not think for a little while.
[03:48:49.364 --> 03:49:05.851]  Sometimes that is therapeutic, but ultimately it's better to come to terms and talk to yourself, really, in an inner dialogue, and understand that, hey, you don't have to worry all day long, you don't have to be frantic and be crazy, and you don't have to feel defeated, because we are actually rising up against the evil on this planet.
[03:49:05.851 --> 03:49:12.394]  We are actually having a great victory, and humanity really, really is coming together, because just as things are getting so terrible,
[03:49:12.834 --> 03:49:22.416]  And worse than we've ever seen before, with the possibility of World War III escalating every single day, and nuclear threats, and ISIS saying they're going to cleanse the planet, all this crazy stuff.
[03:49:22.416 --> 03:49:27.117]  There is a deep escalation of good, and the mainstream media fails to ever look at that good.
[03:49:27.117 --> 03:49:28.657]  They totally, totally do.
[03:49:28.657 --> 03:49:36.479]  They only want to harp on the negativity every single day on ISIS and all that kind of stuff, and they fail to cover the fact.
[03:49:37.099 --> 03:49:46.950]  That just listeners of this broadcast, the millions that are listening to this broadcast, overall are good people that want real action and just want to save this country.
[03:49:46.950 --> 03:49:55.299]  And if we just understood the masses of people that could come together and do that in a peaceful way, we would have amazing victories by tomorrow.
[03:49:55.998 --> 03:50:09.748]  But unfortunately we are so divided from our brothers and sisters in this actual fight that we ultimately are not achieving that in a large way, but we are breaking away like a chisel on a mountain.
[03:50:09.748 --> 03:50:18.315]  We are just breaking away and sometimes we get a bulldozer and we just hit a huge chunk out of that mountain and ultimately we are achieving victory.
[03:50:18.315 --> 03:50:19.055]  Thank you for your call.
[03:50:19.055 --> 03:50:23.178]  Let's go to Doug in Minnesota.
[03:50:23.178 --> 03:50:23.779]  How's it going, Doug?
[03:50:25.046 --> 03:50:26.207]  Hey, how are you doing?
[03:50:26.207 --> 03:50:28.228]  I'm doing great.
[03:50:28.228 --> 03:50:43.960]  See, you know, what people have to understand is the 30-below generation, they were raised on TV and video games, so they've been bombarded this whole time with kind of like their human bobblehead.
[03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:45.341]  Absolutely, hold your point.
[03:50:45.341 --> 03:50:47.283]  We'll come back in the next segment and finish up.
[03:50:47.283 --> 03:50:50.085]  I'm Anthony Guicciardi hosting Alex Jones' 4th Hour Overdrive.
[03:50:50.085 --> 03:50:51.646]  We'll be back with more news and more calls.
[03:50:59.705 --> 03:51:10.792]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens that often get the upper hand on conventional medical treatments.
[03:51:10.792 --> 03:51:15.054]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[03:52:38.866 --> 03:52:42.168]  And the final reason to try X2 is that it's so hard to keep in stock.
[03:52:42.168 --> 03:52:46.312]  We ordered the biggest shipment ever six months ago and that is about to sell out.
[03:52:46.312 --> 03:52:48.614]  It may be a month or two until more comes in.
[03:52:48.614 --> 03:52:55.599]  I want to challenge all of you in the next week to stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:52:59.062 --> 03:53:03.483]  Most of us already know that taking a fish oil supplement to boost omega-3s is a good idea.
[03:53:03.483 --> 03:53:07.544]  But did you know that about 60% of Americans are actually deficient in omega-3s?
[03:53:07.544 --> 03:53:14.886]  Did you know that most fish oil products contain only about 25% omega-3s, and the remaining 75% is undesirable fish fat?
[03:53:14.886 --> 03:53:20.127]  Heck, did you know that more than 90% of fish oil supplements sold in the USA are not even made here?
[03:53:20.127 --> 03:53:28.589]  If you want to boost your omega-3s using the finest American-made fish oil, check out Nutrigold fish oil supplements on www.fishoil.best.
[03:53:28.829 --> 03:53:34.193]  Nutrigold fish oils are independently 5-star certified and guaranteed to be exceptionally pure.
[03:53:34.193 --> 03:53:35.814]  That means no more fish burps.
[03:53:35.814 --> 03:53:41.878]  Best of all, just one Nutrigold fish oil capsule contains more Omega-3s than four standard fish oil capsules.
[03:53:41.878 --> 03:53:52.105]  Go to www.fishoil.best or call 888-920-1497 and use promo code BESTFISHOIL to get a free one-month supply.

[03:54:10.691 --> 03:54:14.973]  Welcome back to the fourth hour overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:14.973 --> 03:54:18.894]  I am Anthony Gucciardi, your host for the remainder of the program.
[03:54:18.894 --> 03:54:20.154]  And it's been a jam-packed show.
[03:54:20.154 --> 03:54:21.795]  We talked about a lot of interesting things.
[03:54:21.795 --> 03:54:23.675]  We took a lot of interesting calls.
[03:54:23.675 --> 03:54:30.597]  We are going to finish up with one more caller, but first I want to tell you that this entire show is made possible by your support.
[03:54:30.597 --> 03:54:36.659]  Alex does not receive funding from outside sources like the government, unlike many news corporations out there.
[03:54:37.299 --> 03:54:49.383]  So you can go to Infowarslife.com and check out the flagship products on there, including Survival Shield X2 Nascent Iodine, which of course is the flagship leader of the Infowarslife brand.
[03:54:49.383 --> 03:54:56.465]  It is true, super powerful, ultra nascent iodine from 8 to 12,000 feet below the Earth's surface.
[03:54:57.085 --> 03:54:59.306]  It's taken from purple salt crystals.
[03:54:59.306 --> 03:55:02.327]  It sounds insane, but it's actually 100% true.
[03:55:02.327 --> 03:55:07.429]  Massive drills go underneath the Earth's surface and drill out purple iodine crystals.
[03:55:07.429 --> 03:55:13.371]  And then we take those and we extract the iodine, because it's the salt crystals that are 200 plus million years old.
[03:55:13.371 --> 03:55:18.694]  We take them out, we screen them for radiation, and then we create the Survival Shield X2.
[03:55:18.694 --> 03:55:21.635]  Here's a couple of the reviews from the Infowarslife.com product page.
[03:55:22.395 --> 03:55:25.856]  This is from BLYN.
[03:55:25.856 --> 03:55:30.918]  I've had iodine issues for a while, but this has helped greatly in improving my energy levels.
[03:55:30.918 --> 03:55:32.518]  Thank you.
[03:55:32.518 --> 03:55:34.799]  And good self me.
[03:55:34.799 --> 03:55:37.200]  Sometimes I really love the names.
[03:55:37.200 --> 03:55:41.741]  The drops under the tongue every morning followed by sips of water is how I take my nascent iodine.
[03:55:41.741 --> 03:55:47.183]  In months past, my 71 years was producing long pauses between some words.
[03:55:47.183 --> 03:55:50.364]  This has lifted since taking iodine for just one week.
[03:55:51.377 --> 03:55:59.098]  That is amazing, and I have had similar experiences taking the Survival Shield X2 Nasal Iodine, which I take every single morning in my protein shake.
[03:55:59.098 --> 03:56:07.880]  The taste doesn't bother me, but I still just put it into the shake and drink it first thing in the morning with the Super Mel Vitality and all the other products at InfoWars Life.
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:12.281]  And I wanted to finish up in the quick couple minutes we've got left with Doug.
[03:56:12.281 --> 03:56:13.721]  Let him finish his point.
[03:56:13.721 --> 03:56:20.262]  Doug, you were talking about how the newest generations are raised on television and assimilated into the board quite quickly.
[03:56:20.262 --> 03:56:20.582]  Go ahead.
[03:56:21.764 --> 03:56:36.227]  Oh yeah, and you know, they don't understand that they've been conditioned and if they use something that's been around forever, reverse psychology or the Pee Wee Herman theory, I know you are but what am I?
[03:56:36.227 --> 03:56:41.887]  You know, we bombard them back with the information they're throwing at us.
[03:56:41.887 --> 03:56:46.508]  So it's either going to negate it or they're going to start looking at the other end.
[03:56:46.508 --> 03:56:50.469]  When you fight back with them, if we just lay back and let them do whatever they want,
[03:56:50.936 --> 03:56:51.457]  We're good to go.
[03:57:14.540 --> 03:57:15.040]  Absolutely.
[03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:21.182]  Not everybody's going to look at it, but that's the simplest way to do it.
[03:57:21.182 --> 03:57:24.724]  And just taking one second to share something on social media.
[03:57:24.724 --> 03:57:36.888]  Just going to any website that has powerful information, whether it's InfoWars.com or my websites, anything that is powerful, and sharing it on social media takes one second, but it could reach millions of people.
[03:57:36.888 --> 03:57:42.530]  Because once something actually really goes viral and gets shared out on Facebook, it can truly change
[03:57:43.090 --> 03:57:49.612]  The perspective of the entire planet and I've seen that firsthand and I have participated in doing so firsthand.
[03:57:49.612 --> 03:57:50.753]  Thank you for your call Doug.
[03:57:50.753 --> 03:57:58.375]  I think ultimately every generation has the ability to stand up and decide that they're not going to take it anymore and to join the ideological revolution.
[03:57:58.375 --> 03:58:03.217]  Thanks so much for joining us on this fourth hour of Overdrive on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:03.217 --> 03:58:06.418]  Alex will be back this Sunday at 4 p.m.
[03:58:06.418 --> 03:58:10.279]  Central Standard Time and I'm sure he will have a lot more to break down.
[03:58:10.819 --> 03:58:12.119]  Thanks a lot for joining us.
[03:58:12.119 --> 03:58:25.723]  We've got so much more news that I'm sure he'll want to cover, including some more crazy stuff on patients' exposure to toxic compounds causing cancer, diabetes, Sanjay Gupta's admitting it, bacteria reducing risk of asthma, the list goes on.
[03:58:25.723 --> 03:58:27.284]  Thanks so much for joining the program.
[03:58:27.284 --> 03:58:28.064]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
