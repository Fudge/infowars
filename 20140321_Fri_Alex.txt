[00:00.000 --> 00:13.520]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.520 --> 00:38.640]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones here we are another
[00:38.640 --> 00:45.680]  Friday lays out before us thank you so much for joining us ladies and gentlemen it is of
[00:45.680 --> 00:57.040]  course already the 21st day of March 2014 we will have open phones throughout the transmission
[00:57.040 --> 01:04.720]  today a fiery controversial member of the UK Parliament George Galloway is scheduled to
[01:04.720 --> 01:11.280]  be joining us to talk about Ukraine the Middle East prosecuting Tony Blair for war crimes and more
[01:11.840 --> 01:18.160]  he's going to be joining us and then we have UKIP the Nationalist Libertarians on then we have
[01:18.720 --> 01:23.680]  George Galloway kind of represents what I would call more actual liberals not the
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.160]  authoritarian type liberal but an actual liberal joining us from the other side of the opposition
[01:28.160 --> 01:33.760]  spectrum against all of the establishment people that are in the middle pushing the status quo of
[01:33.760 --> 01:42.080]  accelerated tyranny and oppression so we will be taking your phone calls as I said in covering a
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.360]  ton of news wow where to start we've got a bunch on Obamacare as it continues to unravel and
[01:47.360 --> 01:54.400]  Obama goes on these big news blitzes to push it we're going to be looking at a really serious
[01:54.400 --> 02:02.960]  report about more and more drug resistant strains of bacteria in this country I personally have had
[02:02.960 --> 02:09.040]  multiple family members die from drug resistant bacteria this year and lung infections I personally
[02:09.040 --> 02:13.920]  have known other people who've lost family members and I know folks who've been on antibiotics for
[02:13.920 --> 02:21.120]  three four months different types who cannot get rid of the chest infections that have been going
[02:21.120 --> 02:25.840]  around and this is happening all over the country I've talked to medical doctors they call it the
[02:25.840 --> 02:33.440]  mystery illness they've been trying to basically keep it quiet from national news that it's going
[02:33.440 --> 02:40.720]  on but it's a very serious situation it's a whole bunch of different drug resistant bacteria a bunch
[02:40.720 --> 02:46.560]  of straps a bunch of staff other types of bacteria and we've got a list of them here we're going to
[02:46.560 --> 02:53.120]  be talking about that because the antibiotics more and more just aren't working or the antibiotics
[02:53.120 --> 02:58.960]  make you have kidney failure and it says on the inserts can you know screw up your kidneys but
[02:58.960 --> 03:04.080]  people don't have a choice so it's it's it's becoming serious Russian roulette I mean you've
[03:04.080 --> 03:12.080]  got to take poison so strong to kill these bacteria that it kills your kidneys and people are putting
[03:12.080 --> 03:18.080]  kids on antibiotics for no reason for 50 60 years don't even test to see if it's viral they just throw
[03:18.080 --> 03:28.400]  them on the antibiotics and now we are all going to pay the piper big time and governments predict
[03:28.400 --> 03:34.880]  it could kill hundreds of millions when some really drug immune bacteria shows up that it will
[03:34.880 --> 03:42.640]  just go through the population and basically like a slow motion disintegrator ray basically
[03:42.640 --> 03:48.080]  flesh eat everybody it comes in contact with we're already seeing a lot of this pop up I mean
[03:48.080 --> 03:54.080]  well I tell you the folks that got to work in hospitals I feel sorry for them and more and
[03:54.080 --> 03:59.600]  more you're seeing the elite go to private clinics that have all sorts of advanced medical care in
[03:59.600 --> 04:05.440]  them that are very high dollar so that they don't have to be around the unwashed masses and quite
[04:05.440 --> 04:12.800]  frankly that's the way to go that's what you want to do now if you've got the money because it's that
[04:12.800 --> 04:23.120]  dangerous and all over the third world the system is just pumping antibiotics out over the counter
[04:24.640 --> 04:29.760]  and the bacteria are becoming immune just like bugs become resistant and immune to pesticide
[04:29.760 --> 04:37.280]  and it is creating a cocktail that I think is one of the biggest threats to humanity
[04:38.480 --> 04:44.320]  you throw in GMO and all the toxic waste dumping and the rest of it it is a nasty combination
[04:45.120 --> 04:48.080]  all right I'm going to get to the main transmission our top stories

[08:16.000 --> 08:22.800]  the truncheon may be used lieu of conversation words will always retain their power words are for
[08:22.800 --> 08:30.560]  the means to meaning and for those who will listen the annunciation of truth there is something
[08:30.560 --> 08:35.360]  terribly wrong with this country isn't that you decided sir you wanted it foolproof you told me
[08:35.360 --> 08:41.520]  every television in longer cruelty and intolerance and oppression and where once you have the freedom
[08:41.520 --> 08:47.280]  to object you don't think and speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[08:47.280 --> 08:53.600]  coercing your conformity and setting your submachine cameras how did this happen who's to blame
[08:54.560 --> 08:59.520]  well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable
[08:59.520 --> 09:05.120]  but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror
[09:06.160 --> 09:14.000]  i know why you did it i know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were a
[09:14.000 --> 09:20.800]  million probably conspired to corrupt your reason and rub you with your common sense fear got the
[09:20.800 --> 09:27.520]  best of you and in your panic you turn to the now high chancellor adam subtler he promised you order
[09:27.520 --> 09:32.640]  he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent
[09:32.640 --> 09:46.640]  there is a war it's happening now it will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides
[09:46.640 --> 09:51.520]  has come we are the resistance we are the info war
[09:55.280 --> 10:00.000]  and we have chosen liberty we have chosen due process we have chosen the way of our ancestors
[10:00.000 --> 10:06.240]  the bill of rights and constitution the true revolutionary idea of human freedom the great
[10:06.240 --> 10:15.680]  expression of the bible and european and british common law and the magna carta and the flower of
[10:15.680 --> 10:23.360]  the renaissance we want the latest newest proven best system we want our republic back and we want
[10:23.360 --> 10:30.320]  it right now we are not going to stand by and watch the globalist create crony centralized
[10:30.320 --> 10:35.680]  monopoly capitalism and blame free market capitalism for what their system has done we're
[10:35.680 --> 10:41.040]  not going to sit back and watch the police being federalized militarized and have that blamed on
[10:41.040 --> 10:46.560]  the republic or even on the police themselves we're going to blame it on the rand corporation
[10:46.560 --> 10:50.720]  and the globalists that are incrementally engineering our country into a police state
[10:50.720 --> 10:56.320]  we're not going to blame the poor starving immigrants that pour across our borders from
[10:56.320 --> 11:04.160]  globalist destroyed nations for the destruction of our wages we're going to blame the globalist
[11:04.160 --> 11:11.280]  that created the atmosphere to allow this to happen we're not going to blame the average
[11:11.280 --> 11:15.840]  mainline street liberal that's scared of guns and really thinks they're dangerous and wants to save
[11:15.840 --> 11:22.720]  people and who doesn't understand that guns protect people many more times a day than they hurt people
[11:24.560 --> 11:28.480]  we're going to deprogram them we're not we don't we don't want to fight with the average dumb
[11:28.480 --> 11:34.240]  down person the average zombie who's been brainwashed since birth we want to reach out to them and
[11:34.240 --> 11:42.080]  wake them up and show them the hat trick show them the magician scam we want unity we want to bring
[11:42.080 --> 11:47.680]  humanity together ran paul two days ago gave an extremely powerful 30 minute speech at berkeley
[11:47.680 --> 11:53.200]  we heard the whole thing on the nightly news last night and extended coverage we heard excerpts
[11:53.200 --> 11:58.320]  yesterday here on the radio show and he said whether you're black or white older young
[11:59.040 --> 12:07.200]  conservative libertarian liberal you shouldn't want the nsa to be illegally spying on you
[12:07.200 --> 12:18.160]  who watches the watchers we are all unified in the fact that our rights are being universally
[12:18.160 --> 12:28.240]  abused and we should come together based on freedom and have that be the unifying cultural
[12:28.240 --> 12:38.160]  moray msnbc predictably went into conniption fits we're going to play a clip of this later
[12:39.280 --> 12:44.320]  with al sharpton so angry that he couldn't even get his name right and called him ron paul
[12:45.120 --> 12:53.440]  and said that ran paul wanted to get rid of the civil rights movement and different acts that
[12:53.440 --> 13:00.960]  were brought in no ran paul pointed out that we replaced one evil with another form of discrimination
[13:00.960 --> 13:05.760]  just like many black leaders i've had on have done that's the point it isn't endorsing the
[13:05.760 --> 13:11.200]  previous system and he was clear in that he was saying we replaced one evil with another evil and
[13:11.200 --> 13:16.240]  everybody who actually studies these facts knows that but but this is the type of division because
[13:16.240 --> 13:21.440]  if we ever come together around private property family the second amendment the right to practice
[13:21.440 --> 13:26.240]  religion as we see fit are not to practice it the right to live as we see fit as long as it
[13:26.240 --> 13:33.360]  doesn't hurt someone else our bodies are ours because any control freak movement from the left
[13:33.360 --> 13:39.040]  or the right will only end up getting distorted and used to oppress and to selectively enforce
[13:39.040 --> 13:45.680]  that doesn't mean we endorse using hard drugs it doesn't mean you endorse someone's sexual
[13:45.680 --> 13:52.720]  activity it means you don't want them in your life and you respect them enough to stay out of
[13:52.720 --> 13:58.320]  their life that doesn't mean though you then let them recruit five-year-olds in the public schools
[13:58.320 --> 14:05.120]  and promote different activities because that's pedophilia so it all is a balance but we need to
[14:05.120 --> 14:08.880]  go back to common sense and realize that we're under social engineering the reason i raised that
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.280]  out of all the stories i've got look how crazy this one is i reported this years ago and people
[14:13.280 --> 14:20.080]  didn't believe me just like it was in the associated press years ago that a million plus state
[14:20.080 --> 14:27.120]  employees in california they got a million state employees folks plus it was in the
[14:27.120 --> 14:31.280]  san francisco chronicle first time i saw it like 10 years ago it was 900 and something thousand
[14:31.280 --> 14:37.360]  were exempt and last time i saw it in ap it was over a million were exempt and that's just in
[14:37.360 --> 14:41.520]  california it's all over the country where they're allowed to run red lights the red light cameras
[14:41.520 --> 14:46.960]  can't even scan their plates their plates are blocked the license plate scanners can't read them
[14:48.400 --> 14:53.600]  they're above the law in the name of security so people can't look in the database and find out
[14:53.600 --> 14:57.840]  where they live well how about my security how about i'm not in all these databases
[14:59.200 --> 15:02.720]  la just got caught using the license plate readers to track everybody in the state
[15:03.440 --> 15:08.160]  it first broke in la but it's the whole state and the state police said well everyone is a
[15:08.160 --> 15:13.920]  suspect that was the headline yesterday in california no judge no jury no probable cause no
[15:13.920 --> 15:19.840]  reasonable suspicion no nothing you're not running out of bank with a mask on your head in the back
[15:19.840 --> 15:25.600]  of money in your hand and a gun in the other hand that's probable cause to draw a beat on the person
[15:25.600 --> 15:30.320]  and say stop or i'll shoot i don't care if you're a citizen or a cop they don't stop shoot them
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.600]  cops just have the power of citizens arrest just like we do they're just sworn and bonded
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.400]  and professionally work for us but there's no probable cause
[15:42.560 --> 15:48.640]  should just say all of you are suspects but that's what la and then the state police came out and
[15:48.640 --> 15:55.120]  said yesterday they said every one of you is a suspect well how about you're a suspect government
[15:55.120 --> 16:00.880]  historically is a suspect of dominating and abuse and killing more people than any other system
[16:00.880 --> 16:07.680]  democide doesn't mean we're saying you're guilty but it means historically you are the plague
[16:07.680 --> 16:12.640]  you are the danger and that's what our founders stated and it's true now speaking the next article
[16:12.640 --> 16:17.520]  this is out of ap again if you're a radio listener i'm not joking because i've mentioned this before
[16:17.520 --> 16:22.960]  as an example of tyranny and people don't believe me because it's so over the top let me read this
[16:22.960 --> 16:31.520]  to you right now hawaii law lets police have sex with prostitutes hana lulu hana lulu police
[16:31.520 --> 16:36.320]  officers have urged lawmakers to keep an exemption in state law that allows undercover officers to
[16:36.320 --> 16:42.800]  have sexual prostitutes during investigations to touching off a heated debate authorities say
[16:42.800 --> 16:48.960]  they need the legal protection to catch lawbreakers in the act yeah right critics including human
[16:48.960 --> 16:53.920]  trafficking experts and other police say it's unnecessary and could further victimize sex
[16:53.920 --> 17:01.440]  workers many of whom have been forced into the trade police haven't said how often or even if
[17:01.440 --> 17:07.040]  they use the provision and they ask legislators to preserve it folks let me tell you just studying
[17:07.040 --> 17:15.520]  news and criminology for 20 years who usually operates as the master pimps over prostitutes
[17:15.520 --> 17:20.800]  in big cities and serpacos exposes and others is the police and i'll tell you why the police like
[17:20.800 --> 17:29.200]  to have sex with the women i don't need to give you a little newsflash here and this is so they
[17:29.200 --> 17:36.320]  can basically run the prostitutes the ones that have been forced into it in many cases i am for
[17:36.320 --> 17:43.520]  decriminalization of prostitution and it's not because i endorse the breadth and width of the
[17:43.520 --> 17:48.640]  trade keeping any legal just like the drug war this is not my opinion it's absolute fact
[17:49.440 --> 17:54.800]  allows women to be kept in captivity allows it to stay illegal allows to keep the prices
[17:54.800 --> 18:00.960]  sky high for the system and the banks that launder the money to control the trade and the traffic
[18:02.240 --> 18:07.520]  you understand that sex slavery should be life in prison folks but they don't they allow it to
[18:07.520 --> 18:14.000]  operate and then meanwhile you've got the high end whole escort situation that the government
[18:14.000 --> 18:20.800]  wants to keep illegal just so they can extort payoffs in the major cities and europe in many
[18:20.800 --> 18:26.080]  areas of decriminalized it actually makes prostitution go down it cleans it up this has been
[18:26.080 --> 18:31.360]  going on forever it's going to continue to go on forever and all we do is let the government come in
[18:31.360 --> 18:38.400]  and run the stinking thing so hey i got an idea police how about we get you out of the prostitution
[18:38.400 --> 18:47.600]  racket and how about we say everybody's exempt huh how about that i mean it's such common sense
[18:47.600 --> 18:52.080]  i mean what are you going to say uh taking a woman out to dinner or giving her some money
[18:52.720 --> 18:58.240]  is a prostitution i mean what's next ladies and gentlemen what's next i mean i see downtown
[18:58.240 --> 19:02.560]  all these older women that are out there with young boy toys who i guarantee are they're paying for
[19:02.560 --> 19:07.840]  his rent i guarantee they're paying for his car in fact i've talked to these people they are
[19:08.800 --> 19:12.000]  i talked to these people i've seen before and i go hey man i've seen you with that lady
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.080]  it you know are you her basically male mistress well yeah yeah she takes care of me i mean you
[19:18.080 --> 19:23.200]  see a 60 year old woman with a 25 year old bodybuilder folks he's a jiggalo ladies and gentlemen
[19:23.200 --> 19:31.200]  but it's all legal she's the sugar mama it's all listen stop letting the government criminalize

[38:00.880 --> 38:07.360]  for charity in the ring and so that's now in the news it's a 50 000 pound to charity for pierce
[38:07.360 --> 38:18.400]  morgan and jeremy clarkson boxing fight you know i think clarkson will win you can just look at the
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.040]  look in that guy's eyes in the size of his neck compared to pierce morgan pierce morgan is a complete
[38:23.040 --> 38:28.080]  nanny and unless the thing staged i think morgan's going to get his head butt handed to him

[43:23.680 --> 43:29.520]  that is literally like satan's left hand telling satan's right hand to stop scratching its rear end

[44:24.800 --> 44:28.960]  and uh there's video this uh house democratic leader nancy palosi defend the president's
[44:28.960 --> 44:34.240]  health care law as a winner that's a new thing everybody loves it we should be thankful to kim

[44:40.080 --> 44:46.960]  moons made of cheese there's no tyranny despite worries of increasing premiums and the drag it
[44:46.960 --> 44:51.360]  could have on democrats this fall the worries of increasing premiums they're going up across the
[44:51.360 --> 44:56.400]  board but that's okay look at this symbol if you're watching on tv if not the articles on info
[44:56.400 --> 45:03.520]  wars dot com daughter of palosi mox gadston don't tread on my obama care and they create a little
[45:03.520 --> 45:10.080]  snake in the design of a stethoscope the apple doesn't fall far from the degenerate tree christine
[45:10.080 --> 45:16.000]  palosi the daughter of california senator nancy palosi's not a senator she's a house you did get
[45:16.000 --> 45:20.560]  that corrected in that article that's not my article but seems to be right on board with the
[45:21.280 --> 45:26.640]  movement to further centralize all aspects of american life in a recent twitter post palosi
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.880]  proudly displayed a knockoff image of the famed gadston flag which has been a hallmark of the
[45:32.880 --> 45:38.000]  liberty movement in america's inception amidst the american revolution in 70 75 yeah it's
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.440]  proliferating everywhere now that's what they're trying to ban it on military bases make the marine
[45:41.440 --> 45:47.920]  corps get rid of it it's it's older than the american flag when the war started they started
[45:47.920 --> 45:52.800]  using it already as a state militia flag was used in virginia and other states so it's an
[45:52.800 --> 45:57.840]  older the american flag and they're making the marines and others in the navy navy seals
[45:57.840 --> 46:04.880]  it's now been outlawed on their official patches so and of course the navy was one of the first to
[46:04.880 --> 46:11.680]  use it as well under john paul jones with the ship sinking fighting a british ship three times the size
[46:11.680 --> 46:17.360]  he said they said surrender and he said i've only begun to fight righted the ship rammed the enemy
[46:17.360 --> 46:24.080]  took it and won anyways continuing but the navy seals can't have that the founder of the us navy
[46:24.080 --> 46:28.000]  you can't have the founder of the us navy's flag on your on your patch because it's racist because
[46:28.000 --> 46:34.000]  al sharpon said so and he's god daughter polosi in support of the health care initiative champion
[46:34.000 --> 46:41.680]  by her money the younger parasite polosi revealed and released the following image on her unwavering
[46:41.680 --> 46:46.400]  support for the mandated legislation that is thus far triple prizes for most working americans
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.920]  and left millions more with no insurance coverage well why not i mean we're a helpless group of slaves
[46:51.920 --> 46:57.120]  they think why not abusers as long as it's a bunch of trendies prancing around talking with lisp
[46:57.120 --> 47:01.680]  everyone thinks it's okay the image being offered as a bumper sticker replaces the traditional
[47:01.680 --> 47:07.040]  gadsden snake where they coiled stethoscope which is about right i guess obama care is a snake
[47:07.040 --> 47:14.320]  about to bite you the gas and flag is a rattlesnake warning you don't step on me i'll bite you
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.280]  rattlesnakes are more of a noble snake they don't usually want to bite humans they're not aggressive
[47:19.280 --> 47:27.840]  they like to kill rats mainly eat the mice they're a uh infrared hunting viper and they're not really

[54:47.360 --> 54:56.720]  phone calls let's talk to kathryn in canada thanks for calling hi alex hey all right there's been
[54:56.720 --> 55:03.200]  an article surfacing on the internet a russian article from 2008 the headline reads obama to
[55:03.200 --> 55:09.440]  start world war three and inside the article it states it's going to start in Crimea and i'm just
[55:09.440 --> 55:14.480]  wondering if there's revelance to this have you heard about this yeah no it's been a official
[55:14.480 --> 55:19.600]  state department plan and brzezinski put in this book in 2007 that they've always planned to take
[55:19.600 --> 55:24.880]  ukraine and they knew the russians would take Crimea so the news is russians take Crimea
[55:24.880 --> 55:29.360]  which is a tiny part of the country now the news is nato in the EU just grabbed almost the whole
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.560]  country and overthrew the government but in lawland they spin it back the other way now regardless
[55:34.560 --> 55:40.880]  of whether you're pro russia or pro e you or you're neutral like i am two predatory arms
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.920]  you know fighting over something the issue is the west started it and our media lies to people
[55:45.920 --> 55:51.120]  about what's going on so uh yeah it's in Serbia reported that obama to initiate world war three
[55:51.120 --> 55:57.680]  with Crimea a starting point 2008 political analyst forecast and uh i mean that's been that's
[55:57.680 --> 56:05.120]  official pentagon nato plan is to take over all the former soviet union satellites and then put in

[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.960]  every cartoon everywhere the gun owners are the terrorist literally wearing three-corner hats
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.440]  and a bunch of shows i've seen like green lantern and you name it the superheroes fight guys in
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.160]  tri-corner hats that look like george washington who are going to kill all the children i mean
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:21.840]  that's what they're trying to do it's not working i see tri-quarter hats at regular parties now i see
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.320]  people wearing them on the streets i see women wearing them i see people wearing patriot apparel
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.960]  all the people that i know moving here from california if you go out to a rockabilly club
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.000]  or something the women are all dressing like they're in the country they all want to go shooting uh
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.760]  the men all want to go shooting and they all hate obama and are waking up and they're not
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:44.960]  even really conservative they're just deprogramming so so maybe instead of the global is taking over
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.840]  california with all their propaganda maybe they're going to come to texas and convert to texas i don't
[01:12:49.840 --> 01:13:15.840]  know but but all i can say is you're losing new world order listen to this
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:19.920]  on the corner of the plastic wrap around the money i remember that it didn't match anyone in your
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.760]  system your gene also gave us a glass of lemonade that buck handled his fingerprint looks like it
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:32.400]  matches the partial print that means he handled the wrap if not the money buck is working at my shop
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.640]  this afternoon which is why i need your people to keep an eye on him until i get there where
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:43.760]  you lead i'm off to another lead a place called the old ross compound that's near trickle lake
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:50.720]  tell me what you know about it well old ken ross was a militant militia conspiracy theory type
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:56.800]  with a whole compound to keep the enemy out which is just about everyone he was arrested
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:02.320]  after federal agents caught him making bootleg whiskey and now he's in jail they also found an
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.840]  entire arsenal of weapons yeah and i'll wait you there's an entire arsenal of counterfeit money up
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:14.400]  there now there you go guns are associated with counterfeit money and illegal whiskey and you
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:19.040]  can listen to these episodes they glorify the fbi and stuff but overall they're pretty wholesome
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:26.480]  not anymore suddenly they're anti-gun adventures in odyssey is the evangelical christian radio drama
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:32.640]  and comedy series created and produced by focus on the family the series first aired in 1987 and
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:39.920]  now it's run by obama obviously i mean it's like every episode's anti-gun now so i guess
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:49.360]  them sending the shooter in there got their attention man i tell you so uh there you go
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:55.920]  ladies and gentlemen i mean is there nothing i can let my children here even though the show
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:01.680]  is pro police and pro fbi i let my kids listen to it because at least the fbi agents in it sound
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:10.640]  moral and act moral not anymore it's just everything is corrupted by this evil and that's not the only
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:16.000]  time i've heard this lately so it's about to be no more adventures in odyssey for my children
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.040]  because now i can't trust it now i if they're going to listen to an hour of it while we're
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:26.080]  driving somewhere i'm going to have to listen to it because you know they'll they'll be in the back
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.320]  with it on a little ipad or something listening to it with headphones not anymore i'm going to
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:36.480]  have to listen to every stinking thing they're allowed to listen to and it's outrageous so
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:40.880]  that's the type of propaganda we're talking about here ladies and gentlemen continuing
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:45.840]  connecticut state police no door-to-door gun confiscations don't trust google to protect
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:50.080]  email from the nsa curtain memo an article breaks that down yet because they are the nsa
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.320]  protester crashes live bbc protest a warrant of pedophile rings at the bbc we're going to be playing
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:03.040]  that expert warns the next kerington event will plunge the u.s. back into the dark ages that's
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:08.720]  a solar flare folks did the u.s. deploy snipers against peaceful occupy protesters the answer is yes
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.440]  that is just some of the news up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and i'm going to get
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:22.160]  to a tax on free speech after we take phone calls and then a tax on ran paul al sharpton thinks the
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.400]  speech at markley was racist because it said everybody should come together around freedom
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:34.480]  that scares the race hustling pimps really bad uh let's go ahead and talk to robin massachusetts
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:41.920]  you're on the air welcome how's it going alex pretty good brother yeah man so like i've called
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.840]  i haven't called for years i'm gonna tell you i've been listening for many many years but uh last
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:53.040]  time i think i was talking to you with eustace mollins uh the curse of canaan writer and um
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:59.920]  yeah i've been doing a lot of research into epigraphy at you know archaeology and interpreting
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:05.920]  ancient inscriptions well i go all the way back to genesis and i'm stuck there for one main reason
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.760]  that's going to be of interest to you and your listeners and that's the new world order it's
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:15.920]  actually mentioned in the bible um i have a copy of the jerusalem bible and that originally came
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:24.800]  out in 1966 uh with some new slants of of english language for readers um it actually is genesis
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:31.040]  chapter nine and heading is the new world order so if your readers can go to that or if you can go
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:36.000]  to that it wouldn't take long to uh to research just getting a copy of that bible it's not the
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.960]  you know not the gideon bible not the king james we've got limited time here so to discuss different
[01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:46.800]  bible versions uh i don't what's the providence of the jerusalem bible and that interpretation
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:52.080]  i mean you read the bible it's all about corrupt empires rising and and country's going into bondage
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:59.920]  i mean it just it just absolutely is valuable info to decipher what's happening today see it in print
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:05.040]  in bold letters as a heading of chapter nine of genesis it's called the new world order i mean that
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:11.440]  is the heading is that translated out of the greek that it is it is it's well not that actually the
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.440]  old testament was in hebrou but see the hebrou scholar the hebrou got translated into greek
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:20.960]  yeah and they but the the hebrou scribes they translated everything from the original samaritan
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:25.200]  about no i understand i just said you can find a bible translation it'll basically tell you
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.000]  anything you want there's so many different versions of this why don't get into the whole deal
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.640]  i understand that um i just i disagree with you about something you said um you know recently
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:40.080]  about superman um the the new movie that just recently came out the man of steel um i didn't
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:46.160]  think it was a good influence on kids and that is because it shows superman uh stealing and killing
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:51.360]  and i was those are two superman broke the drone and he was against eugenics and against centralized
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.400]  government and against rewriting the genetic code of the earth and killing everybody and he
[01:18:56.400 --> 01:19:01.200]  didn't trust the federal government i mean i mean the new uh captain america is about that
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:05.600]  about a rogue group staging terror attacks i mean i thought compared to most of propaganda you see
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.320]  i thought it had a really good message it had that message but um looking back on it i don't
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:14.080]  get a good feeling of the memories of it sure sure let me know who did he kill
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.440]  right he only killed zod because he was about to kill a bunch of innocent people
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:24.000]  which he'd never done before in the comments or any any other and he also stole that and
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.400]  justifies the means right he stole some clothes at the beginning when he came out of the water
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:33.840]  superman has been against stealing i mean come on so so well i think i think we should then
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.600]  send him back to krypton should i think we got a bless you i appreciate your call sir
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:45.600]  it doesn't mean i endorse everything in the movie i was just saying i'm seeing the movie up i thought
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:51.040]  had a wholesome message i mean i just we've got to say what's wholesome in the system versus what's
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:55.680]  bad we can't just say it's all bad we have to say what we see is good so the good gets promoted
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:00.400]  like i want to be able to say adventures and odyssey's good it's not i think obama runs it

[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:23.680]  we've been destroying some of their biggest lies and propaganda we're continuing to seek out enemy
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:32.960]  vessels and attack them i appreciate all of you joining us we're going back to your phone calls
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.920]  here when i take totally open phones some of them are incredible some of them are weird we went from
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:43.600]  the bible and the jerusalem translation to superman it was an interesting call we've gone from the
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:48.320]  police are allowed to be with hookers in hawaii but no one else is i think government should be
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:52.240]  above the law i think that's great that big banks are allowed to bring in the drugs on the aircraft
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:56.880]  that shipped in and have police military guard it when the drugs are brought off and then if you
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:01.120]  get caught with them you go to jail i think that's totally reasonable too i think it's great obama's
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:08.720]  above the law as well i'm being sarcastic the toll free number to join us is 800-25-99-231
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:12.960]  now i'm not going to be able to get to all the calls if i don't go quick so each caller one
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:18.000]  minute terry and then we're going to go to scott then we're going to go to michael then we're going
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:23.600]  to go to brian we're going to go to pax terry you're on the air go ahead hey don't ask all right
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:28.880]  brother you're doing a great job there man um i went ahead to go into connecticut for a job
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.680]  interview on wednesday and when i came out to get the car the guy was in the parking lot at the
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:38.720]  machine yet in his parking ticket and i told him i pointed to the license plate and i said hey you
[01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.200]  guys are going to have to take constitutional to your license plate and he just looked at me with
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:49.600]  six heads i could tell you oh yeah oh yeah i mean the constitution state or whatever i mean that's
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.400]  illegal should to have a dirty word like that i mean they're demonizing that in federal and state
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.480]  court saying they don't want to hear the word constitution and so all these states that talk
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:04.240]  about liberty and constitution they've got to get those dirty words down it might be a good idea for
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:08.640]  you to make up a connecticut license plate with the communist state on it to place on the under
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:16.160]  broker i think that would be more a more accurate wouldn't it yeah definitely uh yeah
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:21.840]  just one more thing is uh i uh you should go through commute to new york city and you wouldn't
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.800]  believe how many um FEMA train cars that i see in the rail yards there and nobody has a clue what
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:34.000]  they are there's a massive hundred multi-billion dollars it's i mean it's hundreds and hundreds
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.920]  of billions no one knows massive shadow government buildup and then the manuals for the grunt troops
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:46.000]  are veterans gun owners george washington's not good i mean this is in the news show there's a
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.600]  giant secret army being trained for war with us and even forbes reports the war against the tea
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.160]  party how the pentagon's training to fight its new enemy it's not the russians it's not the chinese
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:05.920]  it's not al-qaeda it's john wane folks literally i've i've never believed i'm 62 years old i never
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.000]  believed i'd see the country turned into what it's turned into today well i mean look there's a lot

[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:07.680]  and in fact try to pull this up i'm meant to do this just type in matt drudge calls diane feinstein
[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:13.280]  a fascist i believe that was the quote or an authoritarian or matt drudge lashes out at
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:18.320]  at senator feinstein i remember that a few months ago when this bill got introduced it's passed
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.800]  and if you read it it's all solved like you know the affordable care act is going to increase your
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.040]  prices so or the patriot acts really patriotic destroys america's checks and balances and the
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:36.640]  whole bill of rights well it's the same thing with this journalism protection act it destroys
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:43.440]  journalists protections there's the headline from world net daily matt drudge eviscerates fascist
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:50.240]  diane feinstein new media pioneer matt drudge called senator diane feinstein a fascist after
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:56.480]  she suggested only real reporters close quote deserve protection under the new media shield law
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:00.400]  we already had law shielding media so they bring in a new law to shield it which gets rid of the
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:06.960]  shield comments from senator feinstein yesterday on who's a reporter were disgusting drudge tweeted
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:13.440]  adding that a 17 year old blogger is as important as wolf blitzer well i agree with that i mean
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:22.560]  wolf blitzer is totally discredited uh government mouthpiece now that passed the senate i don't
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.800]  know if it'll pass the house because you know those nasty republicans that are trying to repeal
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:30.800]  obama care and trying to save the second amendment and trying to protect our borders those nasty
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:37.680]  libertarian republicans that are fighting with blue blood john bainer aka boner aka mageret
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.080]  i mean all of this is going on and i'm telling you if we didn't have those house republicans
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:53.120]  our goose would be cooked royally what do they call that were they stuffed multiple animals in
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.640]  them and then roast them or trip dunkin you know you got our kids future our financial future our
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:05.280]  future all stuffed into one creature and put in the obama care oven well now here's the article
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:11.920]  by curt nemo just went up at info wars dot com senate has voted to pass law shielding corporate
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:17.680]  journalists it doesn't even really do that legislation designed to put damper on alternative
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:25.360]  media and that's a great headline by curt but i would say senate passes law defining corporate
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:32.560]  journalist as only media or i mean how do you how do you properly there's no way it's so horrible
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:39.200]  i guess his headlines right it just states what they've done um senate passes law
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:47.200]  law defining journalism eviscerating new media protections i don't know i guess curt's headlines
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:55.440]  right senate has uh voted or senate has votes excuse me i was reading that wrong to pass law
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:58.720]  shielding corporate journalists so they haven't passed it but they say they have the votes to
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:03.840]  be technical and correct there legislation designed to put damper on alternative media
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:09.520]  then they now say it's a formality to pass it new york democrat senator chuck schumer said
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:14.000]  today the senate has the votes to pass a bill that will protect corporate journalists from
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.360]  court issued demands to reveal their sources the white house of democrats and independents
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:24.960]  and five republicans in the senate support passing legislation the law will protect quote
[01:42:24.960 --> 01:42:31.200]  covered journalist defined as an employee independent contractor agent of an entity
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:35.440]  that disseminates news or information according to the associated press in other words if the law
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:41.120]  is enacted citizen journalists and bloggers not affiliated with corporations may be subpoenaed
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:46.560]  and forced by law to reveal sources the first amendment does not explicitly protect journalists
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:51.280]  however the 1970s most states had shield laws in place to protect journalists from revealing
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:55.920]  their sources and going to jail for failure to do so well yeah if you're exposing criminal or
[01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:59.920]  corrupt activity you're protected however with the rise of the internet journalism outside the
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:04.000]  controlled arena of establishment and corporate media the government began to consider making
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:08.160]  that distinction between citizen journalists and quote official that's a quote or professional
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.880]  journalist if pass there will be two standards of journalism the united states citizen journalists
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:19.600]  let me they always say we're not real media i've got 50 crew members and break news every day that
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:25.520]  goes international and a recognized news source but they they don't give us press passes to any
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:30.720]  big major events they say no no info wars is just we're not issuing it no no you're not media google
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:36.400]  says we're not media has his d-listed off news because we are real news and then also have
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:41.360]  a pundit hat as a radio host and i'm going to get into really key stuff here in a moment
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:47.200]  citizen journalists and bloggers will be held to one standard as corporate media journalists will
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.080]  be held to another the former may go to jail if attempting to protect sources from government
[01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.960]  intimidation and legal action while they spy on the media we should add drudges tweet in his
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:44:02.480]  warning to this ask her to add he showed the world that daily article add drudges tweet in a little
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:07.120]  tweet box and then maybe link to that pentagon announced but they're gonna go after the alternative
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.560]  media from four months ago very important article by curtain demo now we're gonna go to your calls
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:19.600]  in a moment but that ties into this stack this is out of the daily caller conservative professor
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:27.360]  who was denied promotion wins first amendment lawsuit the first amendment enthusiast are thrilled
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.600]  that mike adams a criminology professor at the university of north carolina wilmington
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:37.200]  won his lawsuit against administration who deemed and denied him a promotion based on his
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:42.640]  conservative christian views adams joined the university in 93 he was an atheist at the time
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:47.520]  by the year 2000 he had converted to christianity became an outspoken political conservative he
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:54.960]  eventually wrote columns for town hall in 2006 he was denied a promotion administrators were
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:59.760]  retaliating against him for conservative views he claimed the jury agreed because he was able
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:05.040]  to show proof i was just an example folks of how if you're not a total communist you don't get a job
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:11.200]  in hollywood now let's continue here russia limbaugh this is seeing it in they report this and
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:17.440]  actually got my son the book i think overall it's a good book it's got you know the tea party
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:23.600]  folks on the cover taken over the ship and it glorifies the founding fathers and free market
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:27.760]  russia limbaugh and he's come up with a whole whole chain of these and i was already thinking of this
[01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:31.040]  i went on record i'm gonna do children books if i ever get the time to get around to it because
[01:45:31.040 --> 01:45:35.760]  this is exactly what i would do we have got to reach out to the youth but the system has had the
[01:45:35.760 --> 01:45:40.640]  public schools and controlled them forever and they think those children belong to them and again
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.520]  i'm endorsing all of russia limbaugh's ideas but his book and i've now scanned over it is light
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:51.680]  night and day compared to what's being taught in the public schools i mean they're teaching
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.840]  heather has two mommy's or is washington's bad they teach the military the founding fathers wouldn't
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:06.240]  be uh allowed in today's military and now they come out and say oh my gosh he's won a preliminary
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:12.720]  vote for his book to be number one children's book remove it ban it it's evil it's racist it's
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:19.360]  homophobe i mean these people are book burners folks this is how you burn books high-tech this is
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:25.120]  how you lynch books 21st century is you don't allow them to be reviewed covered seen or to win
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:29.440]  awards and when they start winning and when it's set in the queue to go to the finalist phase and
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:35.920]  win oh no you got to have it removed which is a total strizan effect of where you try to cover
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:40.720]  something up it only makes it bigger you people are losing control and you hate it and again if they
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:46.160]  can if they can take away rush limbaugh's book listen if there was a communist book that had been
[01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:50.800]  selected and being promoted and was being voted to win i wouldn't say take them out of the running
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:55.200]  because then you can take my book out of the running don't you understand that these are
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:00.960]  authoritarian dirtbags folks listen to this article rush limbaugh radio host conservative
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:06.320]  firebrand and children's book author of the year the children's book council and its every child
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:12.240]  reader program released a thursday their author of the year finalists for their annual children's
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:19.040]  t choice book awards limbaugh is one of the four finalists and his nomination has promoted outrage
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:26.000]  on social media given the host often insinuating nature rush revere and the brave pilgrims time
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:29.840]  travel adventures he's written a book about my family i appreciate it rush revere and the brave
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.080]  pilgrims time travel adventures and exceptional americans a time traveling tale of colonial america
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:40.480]  and the latest of two books in the rush revere series and then it goes in to say they want it
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:48.400]  pulled and then the groups that want it pulled here's another one i mean they are just going
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:52.880]  after the first amendment on every front here's another one rand paul comes out and calls for
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:58.720]  unity all race colors religion creed for the first amendment for the fourth and i have the nsa spying
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.600]  on us that we're all under attack that congress is being blackmailed al sharpton comes out and
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:09.440]  tries to say he's a racist or or tries to basically lie about what rand paul has stood for
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.320]  and he can't even get the name right we're going to play that clip folks right now
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:22.800]  where does ron paul get off talking about race and civil rights at all yeah you on that this is the
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:29.280]  man who once said he would have modified this i want to point out he calls him ron paul he can't
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:35.920]  even read teleprompter right i mean this guy is a mega race pimp on record do i have to give you
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.080]  the quotes of al sharpton about jews and stuff i mean the point is the guy's just really a piece of
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:44.320]  work and then he's got the nerve to claim rand paul's another race remember when the democrats
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:49.760]  got caught dressing up with in like a seat outfits with racist signs and then we pointed out that it
[01:48:49.760 --> 01:48:54.480]  was no democratic operatives our listeners did and they found the same photo of the guy and the guy
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.960]  had to admit it was a quote joke democrats did that down in houston they go to tea party events
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:05.200]  and dress up in kkk outfits folks but that's what the fbi does right in the clan they go out and
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:09.440]  go to everybody's gun event the clan outfit this is how they do it and i'm sick of it let's go back
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:16.080]  to al sharpton who can't even read a teleprompter where does ron paul get off talking about race
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:22.720]  and civil rights at all this is the man who once said he would have modified the civil rights act
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:27.920]  if he'd been a senator at the time should walworth lunch counter should have been allowed to stay
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:35.360]  segregated sorry just yes or no what i think would happen what i'm saying is is that i don't
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:41.040]  believe in any discrimination there's ten different titles you know to the civil rights act and nine
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:47.600]  out of ten deal with public institutions and i'm absolutely in favor one deals with private
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:53.520]  institutions and had i've been around let's it pause that's famous because we've talked to him
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:57.200]  where they were fading his audio up and down they do that and i've been on tv where you can't hear
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:02.960]  and they're playing stuff in your ear and then he's explaining but you know should christians
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:08.640]  have a right to not rent a room to a satanist that that's the full article he wrote a few years ago
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:13.920]  and and yeah i should be able to rent a room to who i want and sure there may be races out there
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.640]  who don't want to rent a room you know to somebody they don't like there's black races white race
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:23.760]  but sure that's your issue private property they're now telling the catholic church they have to pay
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:29.120]  for abortions and they have to hire satanist should the catholic church be able to say no
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:33.920]  well of course folks because congress will make no law respecting an establishment of religion
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:39.360]  or prohibit this exercise thereof the government doesn't have a jurisdiction in your private life
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:43.600]  to hopi indians have to let me show up to one of their dances and take mescaline dance around no
[01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:47.520]  can the feds arrest them for taking mescaline no it's their religion
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:54.240]  that's the first amendment not what they say it is not what al sharp and he's the boss he owns

[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:29.920]  and should we have war crime charges for the gulf war on tony blare and others well they
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:36.720]  premeditatedly did lie right now let's talk to michael in florida thanks for holding her on the air
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:43.760]  hey alex uh i just want to ask you a question about i listened to you as a college listener
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.360]  i just wanted to get your opinion on the status of college education and also if you have any
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:55.200]  advice for students like me who are kind of aware of what's going on uh within the government and
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.520]  all this stuff they try to uh deploy on the college student and uh if you have any advice for any
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:07.280]  college listeners who are aware of what's going on around well they try to get you in a group
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:13.440]  thinks a great question and then make you think that leftist ideology is the only moral ideology
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.200]  and they try to restrict and ban everybody else but then they also deftly act like only
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:25.440]  conservatism is the only other choice mainline republicanism that's that's absolutely despicable
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:31.840]  on many fronts so that's basically it there's libertarianism uh you know there's classic
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:37.040]  liberalism you shouldn't let them define what they're setting up as liberal thomas jefferson
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:41.520]  was a liberal what they promoted the colleges today predominantly is the opposite of liberalism
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:48.720]  it's authoritarianism so so much of it is labeling uh and so that's what it goes down to they're very
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:55.280]  anti-man very anti-family they want to domesticate you uh also the colleges most people i've seen
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:55:59.920]  different numbers but it's over 80 percent will never get the money back for what they've spent on
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:06.080]  college in job markets most the the degrees they're giving out are pretty much worthless
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:12.720]  unless it's in engineering or in you know the law or other areas and there's a glut of lawyers uh so
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:19.200]  there's a lot of problems out there and uh i'm not saying college isn't for everybody if you're
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:26.400]  trying to send your daughter to the best sorority to find the best rich man to marry it or vice versa
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:31.120]  with your son it's a great way to keep your you know to send them to the right sorority and keep
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:36.480]  them in the right families if you want them to marry into wealth uh or if you want to go to west
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:40.480]  point you know if you want to end up being the chairman of the joint chiefs someday you better
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:44.960]  go to west point and your grandpa better have been the chairman of the joint chiefs on top of it
[01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:50.240]  uh and and then you better also get you know three purple hearts in combat and have 160 IQ and
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:55.360]  you know stuff like that but i mean there are reasons to go to college but most of you are
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:00.000]  there to just pay for the institution and you're being used does that answer the question
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:05.600]  yeah that answers the question uh because to me sometimes school almost seems secondary to me
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:11.040]  because it's not because i'm unintelligent but just because i'm not motivated to do the work that they
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.840]  have the most important thing in college is to join the golf team and hang out with the elites
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:20.080]  so that they know you when you get out of college to get a job the most important thing in business
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:25.040]  in life is social skills so if you want to go to college to learn social skills and get into the
[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:32.720]  right groups and hang out with the right people and never screw anyone never cheat anyone never gossip
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:38.160]  never backstab be a fun person you'll be successful the degree part means nothing unless you're an
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:43.840]  engineer that's what all these people don't get out there and alternative media that backstab
[01:57:43.840 --> 01:57:47.520]  and freak out and act mentally ill all day they always wonder why they're not successful why they're
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:55.200]  quote black bald no one's black bald them no one associates with losers no one associates with with
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:01.840]  with this arrested development junior high you see it in business everywhere lazy lying cheating
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:08.880]  delusional fantasy land stuff and if you want to be successful work hard be charming be nice
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:15.600]  study the trade publications and whatever industry you're in you'll dominate your only problem will be

[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:45.280]  about predictive programming in a movie that just came out recently with uh leon nison called non-stop
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:52.960]  and it's basically a federal marshal who uh you know does his job and uh what he ends up doing
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.480]  basically is stopping a terrorist attack that gets blamed for it uh if you had the opportunity to
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:03.120]  actually see the movie no but that's actually what they do the movie arlington road is totally
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.680]  accurate there's a secret shadow group you don't even know if they're government or not uh and then
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:12.080]  they trick the professor to show up at a time and place as a libertarian to blow up the federal
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:18.000]  building and that's exactly what they do and he gets framed for it basically because there are
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.720]  terrorists no no no they'll tell sheet military people they'll be part of this drill they'll
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:29.040]  blow it up and say they did it that's what they do so check this out though so they you know he's
[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:34.320]  watching case in every every person that's basically on the flight and there's you know the standard
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:39.520]  you know token muslim basically who ends up being a doctor move you know they're going to london
[02:01:39.520 --> 02:01:47.520]  basically but the terrorists that end up in sorry for the spoiler are basically two uh let me let me
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:53.920]  look at this they're basically two v as basically they're two veterans oh no listen i know and there's
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:58.560]  no veterans doing anything other than maybe commit suicide or kill in their neighbor uh
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:02.640]  statistically veterans have very low crime rate i have the fbi numbers but no every show every
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.680]  movie the veterans are the terrorists the branding is total the veterans are going to kill everybody
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:10.960]  because when they purge this country they're going to try to go after all the veterans
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:15.280]  disgusting you i'm going to send my crew out to watch it and do a review of it or i'll do it

[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:52.160]  the spoiler basically they're two veterans basically that are upset and appalled by the
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:59.760]  lack of security at the u.s airports before 9 11 totally ridiculous and that's how they're
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:06.800]  tying veterans to 9 11 in a roundabout way in the official west point training manuals the new
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:13.520]  enemy is veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians and the officer corps is being
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:18.800]  taught how to be total traders i appreciate your call great points chad in canada go ahead you're

[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:30.480]  want uh you to have to answer and burn bridges in i don't care just ask the question i see what
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:34.640]  you want to ask on screen go ahead okay well the question is i'm just curious you know i've
[02:03:34.640 --> 02:03:39.680]  been a coast listener for years in fact that's how i got on to your show and when i started
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.400]  listening to coast i didn't realize that george norrie was the the host i thought john b wells
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.960]  was the host because i always found him to do a way better job and to be more informative and
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:55.680]  i'm just curious if you found anything kind of sneaky suspicious of his release and do you think
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:00.800]  that coast to coast is maybe being opened in the back side by the you know the uh the elite
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:07.520]  you know here's the deal here's the deal i go on coast to coast shows have never been censored
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:11.680]  for 11 years i've reached tens of millions of people george norrie's a total gentleman and a
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:16.080]  friend of mine i like john b wells that have met him a few times had him down to the studio hung
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:21.200]  out with him god he was a really nice guy i like him i love his show he does his own private show now
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:28.000]  a no he was not released because of censorship i can tell you that because i do know the inside
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:34.160]  baseball but it's it kind of like dishonorable let john b wells speak for himself i didn't have him
[02:04:34.160 --> 02:04:38.800]  back on soon and george norrie i just don't get involved in all this he started his own show
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.360]  didn't tell them about it i don't think he thought it was wrong when he was doing but you know
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:48.800]  companies don't want you doing your own thing outside of it and so they released him and i'm
[02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:53.920]  not in the middle of that i like all of them i'm friendly towards all of them i stay out of it my

[02:08:54.640 --> 02:09:01.280]  british politician writer broadcaster and respect party member of parliament from bradford west
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:08.320]  and he is very well known for testifying before the u.s congress he's very well known for exposing
[02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:13.520]  the iraq war as a lie and a fraud before it happened then they of course murdered dr. david kelly to
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:20.000]  try to cover that up he helped expose that he's been pushing for tony blare and others to be held
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.800]  for war crimes which they clearly have done by every yardstick we've had members of the u.s senate
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:29.920]  look at it and say clearly it's a war crime they fix the intelligence the white house memo the
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:35.520]  downing street memos have all come out we know prima facia cookie you know jar hand in the cookie

[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:53.600]  everything he warned of and was demonized i mean they tried to put him in jail for stuff they tried
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:10:01.280]  to go after him they absolutely hate him and he's an amazing orator i don't agree with everything
[02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:04.560]  he says but but i do agree with the fact that i believe he's a real guy who believes what he's
[02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:08.400]  saying and believes he's standing up for human liberty and dignity so we've got him on about
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:15.840]  that and a whole host of other issues to discuss today i want to get his take on the russia situation
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:21.920]  the new cold war that's getting kicked off right now and where he sees civilization going so he
[02:10:21.920 --> 02:10:26.480]  joins us via video skype of your tv viewer radio listeners can go to info wars dot com
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:31.280]  four slash show to see the free feed george thank you for coming on the show it's a pleasure alex
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:36.720]  nice to talk to you again where would you like to start there's so much to talk about well i think
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:45.760]  the most immediate crisis is the one now in the ukraine the Crimea with russia and the cold war
[02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:54.080]  beginning to encroach upon our toes my toes are feeling distinctly frosty with all the rhetoric
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:03.280]  which takes us back to the 1970s 1980s and having had a period of honeymoon russia appears to be
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:12.000]  back as public enemy number one and the hypocrisy that's being deployed would be laughable if it
[02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:23.680]  were not so serious in britain for example we have a government which in 1982 sailed 7 000 miles
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:31.680]  all the way to the south atlantic to defend the rights of self-determination of 2300
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:39.440]  british settlers on what they call the falkland islands they fought a devastating war in which
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:46.480]  many hundreds were killed many more were maimed and billions of pounds in treasure were burned
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:55.040]  in order to come to the aid of what we said were our compatriots even though we planted them there
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:12:03.920]  in the first place equally our government if spain were to have the temerity to just severely increase
[02:12:03.920 --> 02:12:12.400]  the traffic restrictions on traffic going from spain to Gibraltar and vice versa we'd be ready to go
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:20.640]  to war with spain because we say that the rock which is attached to spain actually belongs to us
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:30.800]  and yet the same government warns russia of condemned punishments to come because they intervened to
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:39.920]  safeguard their vital national interests and millions of their compatriots russian nationals
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:49.520]  russian speakers whose lives and property were very obviously at risk from a western sponsored and
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:58.960]  paid for and logistically armed in every way coup d'etat in the neighboring country of ukraine
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:07.040]  i could go on but i just will give one more example of the hypocrisy or perhaps two the
[02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:16.960]  kosovo which is a part of syria declared itself unilateral to be an independent state
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:25.680]  and 110 countries in the world have recognized it recognized this self-declared independence
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:33.120]  and guess what both my country and yours are amongst the 110 countries that have recognized
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:40.000]  and look at south syria exactly look at south syria one more permit yeah just yes south syria
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:48.400]  but permit me one more irony john kerry with a solemn face said that we can have countries
[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:56.640]  invading others and seizing territory on trumped up pretext and he didn't even have the grace to laugh
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:06.880]  when just 11 years ago exactly yesterday britain and the united states in their shock and awe
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:15.440]  invasion and attack on iraq began a process which has murdered a million souls destroyed iraq
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:23.840]  shattered the interpieces and sent cascading around the world islamist fundamentalist fanatic
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:32.240]  extremism all over the globe all in the name of britain and america arrogating to themselves the
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:38.960]  right to do whatever they please irrespective of the decision of the united nations or of
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:44.800]  anything called international law you couldn't make it up alex incredible the way george galloway
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:50.560]  puts it total veritas i agree with you 100 and ron paul on the libertarian right came out and wrote
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:54.640]  articles and said exactly what you just said almost word for word because it is just the truth
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:59.440]  neither one of you is plagiarizing the other it's just the truth and they are calling him
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:06.160]  basically a kgb agent they are demonizing me for it we just lost the skypher and getting back up
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:12.880]  it is insane to sit here and watch this and and you talk about radical islam cascading around the
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:20.480]  world what is the larger plan that's what i want to ask george galloway again a member of the
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:27.920]  respect party from bradford west in the united kingdom and we're going to be talking about some
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:36.960]  about that party as well today again folks a new cold war being launched right now a new cold war
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:45.440]  being expanded and george just basically broke down the hypocrisy of 11 years later what has
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:51.280]  happened with iraq and if his skype's not working guys just go to telephone back up we're going
[02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:55.920]  to telephone right now good all right it was a bad skype anyways but it was good to be able to
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:59.600]  see him even though it looked like we're looking him through a fog and that's the beauty of skype
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:04.480]  and these technologies that are not yet perfected but they still it still is amazing to be able to
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:11.680]  talk to anybody we want uh across the world and and it it is the hypocrisy of people like
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:19.680]  john carrey that is so staggeringly ridiculous you think it's dr strange love satire to have
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:24.560]  him saying you can't just go around you know invading countries when the russians are grabbing a
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:31.200]  small area that's pretty much always been part of russia uh to secure their pipelines now now sir
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:37.200]  continuing uh you were getting into iraq and the cascading radical islam is there a method to the
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:44.480]  madness in syria in libya because i mean this looks like something the devil would do uh to
[02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:51.360]  just try to wreck any stability what's the game plan well i wish i knew i shared a lift with
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:58.080]  william hayg the british foreign minister just a week or two ago and i said to him william you've
[02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:05.280]  been wrong all of your life but i've never known you to be actually insane yet the policy you're
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:16.320]  following in syria is literally insane you have inflated financed and armed al qaeda in syria
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:23.840]  on the principle that your enemy's enemy was your friend yet now you tell us that returning
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:32.640]  fanatics coming back from syria now that they're losing the war are britain's number one security
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:40.400]  concern so you've made more dangerous the very people that you say are our number one
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:49.600]  national security threat this has to be defined as insanity doesn't it it is and and i've i've
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:54.640]  been following politics for decades but never have seen something this surreal again george galloway
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:17:59.360]  member of uk parliament one of the most outspoken people in europe not just england against all
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:05.760]  these wars proven absolutely right about iraq and spades uh where is it going as as the open
[02:18:05.760 --> 02:18:14.080]  mental illness the fascist mental illness just explodes and metastasizes well it is metastasizing
[02:18:14.080 --> 02:18:20.560]  that's a very good image to conjure up and it is a cancer that has spread all over the world and i
[02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:28.320]  said this to tony blair man to man outside the gentleman's lavatory to be precise in the library
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:35.920]  corridor of the house of columns just a few days before he and george bush invaded iraq i told them
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:43.040]  i think four or five things number one there is no al qaeda in iraq but if you invade it there will
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:50.480]  be hundreds of thousands of al qaeda in iraq number two the fall of bagdad will not be the
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:57.120]  beginning of the end but merely the end of the beginning number three the iraqis will not welcome
[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:04.960]  you with flowers they will walk welcome you with hot lead and fire and number four to believe
[02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:12.880]  that iraqis would welcome a foreign invasion of their country means that you think they love
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:21.200]  their country less than we love ours because nobody in britain or the united states would
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:29.680]  dream of welcoming a foreign invader and occupier to their country and lastly i said that though
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:37.440]  there is no al qaeda in iraq if you invade al qaeda will be everywhere it will spread everywhere
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:44.000]  like a cancer metastasizing as you say all over the globe because you will fanaticize
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:54.320]  radicalize extremize millions and millions of muslims who can see the grotesque double
[02:19:54.320 --> 02:20:01.520]  standard that you are practicing your best friends in the region are the worst dictators
[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:08.160]  in the region you are supporting those tyrants giving them money and weapons where they need them
[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:16.960]  and you're supporting israel which has for more than 60 years wiped off the map the country that
[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:22.720]  used to be called palestine and scattered their millions of people all over the globe
[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:30.640]  and anyway you cut it it's meant to radicalize islam and and in the final equation he stabilized
[02:20:30.640 --> 02:20:34.960]  the whole region you've been really accurate predicting what would unfold what do you predict
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:41.600]  one fold now in syria in libya all over the place where the al qaeda jihadis are running around and
[02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:45.360]  now as you mentioned your government other governments are saying brace for al qaeda to
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:49.920]  attack with surface-to-air missiles that they got in Benghazi and there's no discussion of
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:55.200]  why were they given this i mean clearly they're helping create the threat to then set up a police
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:03.120]  state continent wide uk wide us wide looks to me like they want to use this al qaeda threat
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:09.760]  that they're funding and supporting to take our liberties well up to a point but the point about
[02:21:09.760 --> 02:21:15.760]  the frankenstein analogy that i keep making is that once you've made the monster it quickly moves
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:22.720]  moves out of your control and we found that in the 1980s in afghanistan when on the same immoral
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:31.040]  principle that my enemy's enemy is my friend we supported the fathers of these current extremists
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:37.920]  in the so-called mojahedin in afghanistan we gave them guns we gave them money which they later
[02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:44.640]  deployed against us and most uh atrociously uh in the united states of america but also in
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:50.880]  london in madrid and elsewhere so the point about frankenstein is you've got to read it to the end
[02:21:51.520 --> 02:22:00.080]  because you then realize the dr frankenstein's monster turned on his creator and uh whilst a bit
[02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:09.680]  of a threat of fanaticism or communism or russia can be useful to the military industrial complex
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:17.840]  to the security state apparatuses who wish to uh boost other budgets give themselves more power
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:25.200]  and centrality in the state only up to a point because once you've made this enemy more powerful
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:32.480]  as we've done with the fanatics then you are in very real and present danger from them they have
[02:22:32.480 --> 02:22:42.000]  come up though against some serious reality the syrian people have rejected their uh jihad they
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:49.760]  have stuck by their regime even where they may hate their regime and there are many good reasons
[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:57.520]  to hate the syrian regime but the syrian people will never agree to live under an islamist code
[02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:05.680]  that owes more to bin laden owes more to afghanistan than they ever could to a sophisticated
[02:23:05.680 --> 02:23:14.560]  civilized leventine population where people mix men and women christians and muslims where the
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:21.040]  minority religions are protected and cherished and so on and that's the way the majority of people
[02:23:21.040 --> 02:23:28.960]  in syria wanted to continue so they have stuck by their government the state has not broken the
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:36.480]  army has not broken and they are winning success after success on the battlefield but that of course
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:43.040]  means that these fanatics are now beginning to return from whence they came and whence did they
[02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:50.720]  come your country my country other european countries we are now blooded and with the
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:58.000]  skills of four years of terrorist war they'll be looking for targets in our own countries
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:04.560]  well sure to attack well sure libya is another example that you have raised a couple of times
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:17.840]  they painted gadafi as a foolish brutal idiotic dictator and he was but they have managed with
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:26.560]  an act of genius to make libya worse under their so-called liberators and they admit that that it
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:32.080]  was under gadafi just like i like they're all murdering each other in large numbers they're
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:38.160]  kidnapping the prime minister forcing him from office murdering the american ambassador
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:43.120]  in ben gazi killing each other killing anyone that they can get their hands on and now there's
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:49.440]  not one libya but three shouldn't it be 33 what is wrong with these al-qaeda people i mean why are
[02:24:49.440 --> 02:24:58.640]  they just so insane and nasty well al-qaeda's mentality is rooted in and based on the narrowest
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:07.280]  possible most sectarian interpretation of islam that is possible to imagine and anybody who doesn't
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:17.440]  share this dogmatic tiny narrow interpretation of islam is an apostate who must be killed
[02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:23.760]  that's just other muslims by the way never mind when it comes to christians or jews
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:32.720]  or non-believers all of them have to go and so this narrow interpretation of islam is supported
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:40.400]  in only one place on the earth saudi arabia and that's saudi arabia and guess what saudi arabia
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:46.800]  is your country and my country's best friend prince charles was there just the other week
[02:25:46.800 --> 02:25:54.320]  done up like an arab sheikh with a sword in his hand doing a sword dance the very kind of sword
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:00.240]  that's cutting off people's heads christian clerics included in syria
[02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:08.240]  included in syria having already stampeded virtually all of the christians in iraq out of
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:16.960]  their country for fear of their lives that's right so it's one of the great puzzles of all time
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:23.680]  how your country could be back in bed with al-qaeda after everything that's happened
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:29.280]  over the last decade all it is incredible you know it it's so insane george galloway
[02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:34.960]  that i can't even believe it it's very hard to believe but the blood and treasure of young
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:43.200]  american servicemen and women and british servicemen and women and your taxpayers and mine have been
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:50.880]  expended in the trillions of dollars in the name of fighting al-qaeda when we are now arming
[02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:58.000]  and funding al-qaeda in syria as i say you couldn't make that up in fact i'm somewhat of a history
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.920]  buff i can't think of really a lot of examples are really any historically except for 1984 and
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:08.000]  that's fiction where you're always at war with east asia and the next day you're never at war
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:13.840]  with east asia it is that crazy so looking forward because you made a lot of accurate predictions
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:19.680]  i've read your writings and watch you when you're in parliament uh i mean it's always informative
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:25.920]  where do you see this going and will the political class pay any price on the left and the right
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:31.040]  for the war crimes that have been committed here and and and now the new war crimes of turning
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.600]  al-qaeda loose i know you're working towards punishing those those war crimes with a lot of
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:43.200]  courage break that down well i'm now making a movie called the killing of tony blair it's not a
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:48.000]  snuff movie it doesn't involve me killing tony blair though that would probably be quite a popular
[02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:55.520]  movie it's about the killings of tony blair the killings carried out by tony blair and the financial
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:03.840]  killing that he is making as a result of the other killings that he had been doing and so i hope
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:09.840]  that we'll get him sacked as the middle east peace envoy the most grotesque appointment since
[02:28:09.840 --> 02:28:17.200]  caligula appointed his horse as a full council of ron i hope that it will stop companies from
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:25.440]  hiring him he's made more than 75 million pounds so a hundred million dollars since leaving office
[02:28:25.440 --> 02:28:32.720]  working for the tyrants and the companies that he saw handsomely profited and benefited
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:39.760]  when he was in office and i'm about to start making a movie to try and punish the american
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:48.400]  political class it's called where's kenny boy it fastens on the criminal kenneth lay who may or may
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:56.240]  not have died of a heart attack just before being sentenced for his crimes in the collapse of enron
[02:28:57.040 --> 02:29:06.640]  and may or may not be living on a hundred thousand acre ranch owned by george bush in paraguay cheek
[02:29:06.640 --> 02:29:14.320]  by jowell with the biggest american base in the region just so uh people who want to look over the
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:21.040]  fence might be discouraged from doing so oh absolutely we're now crowding we're now crowdfunding
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:26.960]  for that movie george allaway we got to go to break it's called where's kenny boy and your
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:33.280]  viewers and listeners i hope will go to start join and support it okay george stay there we're
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:37.120]  gonna come back from break and we'll talk about the film because i've followed this and i'm glad
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:40.960]  you're making it and i hope folks will support it because clearly he staged his death two days
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:46.080]  before sentencing and has been seen down there at the bush ranch i mean they keep dipping folks they
[02:29:46.080 --> 02:29:52.160]  stage deaths all the time george galloway is our guest stay with us we're on the march the empires

[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:32.320]  jones that's right we're liberals here like thomas geverson i don't accept the mainline
[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:38.880]  liberal establishment or the mainline conservative establishment i judge each issue on its own
[02:33:40.240 --> 02:33:46.160]  and geopolitically study it or domestically look at it and then try to say what is the most
[02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:54.960]  honorable balanced way to address this and to focus on it most people just choose their political
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:34:00.960]  ideas according to what they think is fashionable what they think is cool most people as you know
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:05.280]  are not informed about the world especially americans either americans are extremely informed
[02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:10.080]  or they're very uninformed national statistics show the most uninformed in the world other than
[02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:15.600]  like afghanis who can't even find the us on a map in most cases the equivalent of cavemen i'm not
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:18.960]  knocking them a lot of those folks have never you know even really watched television in the
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:24.080]  rural areas so you can't blame them most americans don't have passports they just think this is the
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:31.520]  earth and it's it's it's very very frustrating because clearly russia just saw 90 percent of
[02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:35.920]  ukraine grabbed they only took an area used to be part of russia the media spends it that they've
[02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:42.560]  invaded and stolen something and clearly the west with the eu just gobbled the country up
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:47.760]  and over through an elected government is trying to start a new cold war now that's what ron paul
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:51.520]  agrees with that's what george galloway's saying not because we all get together on the phone and
[02:34:52.080 --> 02:34:57.680]  decide what we believe we are informed it's fun to be informed about the world the regions the
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:05.200]  players that's my soap opera not football not sitcoms not you know that's that when i'm home at
[02:35:05.200 --> 02:35:08.240]  night or got my friends over we're sitting around we talk about something like this because it's
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:14.240]  interesting to us to learn more and i'm not saying i'm even that smart it's very frustrating
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:19.760]  to know the facts and to know it's not your opinion and then you just see the cheap political
[02:35:19.760 --> 02:35:24.240]  porn that's out there that the controlled left to control right spew out it's very frustrating
[02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:30.320]  we'll get george galloway's take on that talk about kin lay who clearly it's the evidence is amazing
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:35.360]  people that go down there get harassed by the way has been sent down to south america we're
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:39.920]  going to talk about that another film he's working on and where he thinks the future is going with
[02:35:39.920 --> 02:35:43.760]  george galloway and then when he leaves us a little bit of overdrive and take your phone calls he
[02:35:43.760 --> 02:35:51.200]  leaves us at 50 after briefly remember this hour is brought to you by info wars store dot com with

[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:05.360]  at george galloway i've been ranting here i want to give you the floor tell us about the film
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:10.720]  you're a serious guy basically everything you said about iraq came true more than anybody
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:16.880]  even more than ron paul and myself what you said came true like it was you know prophetic so
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:21.280]  you're a serious guy if you think ken lay's really so alive we're investigating it i think he is the
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:27.600]  evidence is there tell us about your film your crowdsourcing and then let's move forward to
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:32.320]  the big picture what else is happening in the world and where you see us going thank you alex
[02:37:32.320 --> 02:37:40.000]  um at the there's no evidence that he's dead uh and all the circumstantial evidence is that he's
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:48.640]  still alive and he cheated the american justice system uh and allowed his family to remain in
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:55.600]  control and ownership of his millions his estates and so on by mysteriously dying of a heart attack
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:02.800]  in colorado uh just three days before being sentenced for then one of the biggest frauds in
[02:38:02.800 --> 02:38:11.680]  corporate history it prefigured the crash of 2008 and indeed kenith lay prefigures the kind of
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:20.560]  villains that walked across the stage uh during the crash of 2008 kenith lay was george w bush
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:30.000]  he was the sponsor primary sponsor of the political class not just in the republican party but in the
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:39.680]  democratic party too and when bush flew down to florida to uh to fight the recount which made him
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:48.000]  president in the first place he flew down in an enron jet covered in enron insignia and then
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:57.680]  quickly enron collapsed uh billions of dollars were lost he was convicted of a massive fraud three
[02:38:57.680 --> 02:39:05.600]  days before sentencing and thus able to his family able to retain his millions he went he was given
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:12.720]  permission to go to colorado where he died in the night of a heart attack and then was promptly
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:19.120]  cremated and nobody from the federal government nobody from the fbi nobody from the justice
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:28.480]  department actually saw his dead body before it was supposedly burned and at his funeral the entire
[02:39:28.480 --> 02:39:35.040]  american political class turned out to pay their respects to a man who had just been convicted
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:45.440]  of a gigantic super fraud of billions of dollars uh both the bushes were there uh but president
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:52.640]  clinton was also there uh president carter was also there what were they even doing at the funeral
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:59.680]  of a convicted criminal uh in this way and of course he went up in smoke or did he because
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:06.560]  conveniently at the same time a hundred thousand acre ranch now i know you're in texas and everything's
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:14.400]  bigger in texas but for me the idea that bush owns a hundred thousand acre ranch that he bought it
[02:40:14.400 --> 02:40:20.240]  right next door to the american military base and that your risk being shocked for looking over the
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:28.640]  fence to see if you can spot kenneth lay is all deeply suspicious so i'm going to go to paraguay
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:35.680]  i'm going to insist on looking over that's a great movie idea that you and max kaiser have
[02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:42.480]  that is max came up with the idea and him and i are working on it now and we're seeking crowdfunding
[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:48.880]  for it on max's crowdfunding platform which is called start join and the movie's called
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:55.360]  where's kenny boy because that was george w bush's famous cry whenever he needed anything
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:02.080]  especially the green folding stuff it was a case of where's kenny boy well i'm asking where's kenny
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:09.120]  boy and i'm an elected british member of parliament 27 years elected to the parliament six times
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:15.280]  elected let's see if they shoot me walking up the drive of the hundred thousand acre ranch
[02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:22.080]  kenneth lay if you're out there i'm coming to get you well when you look at everything you just
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:27.520]  said it's all on record and they they routinely stage military personnel's death to give them new
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:35.840]  personalities we've studied in ron it was a giant multi hundred billion dollar front that they were
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:40.800]  putting money in the cayman islands the bahamas switzerland they would on a single week make a
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:46.240]  billion dollars extra lying and claiming there was no electricity and triple and quadruple
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:51.920]  charging people you know power bills would go from a thousand dollars to six thousand dollars in a month
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:59.120]  in california and surrounding states he was a master criminal and the fact is is that they
[02:41:59.120 --> 02:42:03.680]  were protecting him and undoubtedly it's been reported he keeps getting seen down there
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:09.760]  and only uses that as a home base and it's and you going down there because you've got the courage
[02:42:09.760 --> 02:42:16.880]  to do it will become a sensational film regardless they've got to be concerned i hope so and just to
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:22.640]  add to the masterful summary you just gave there of lay's role in things and then ron's role in
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:30.320]  things he took care to spread money around the political class to make sure that he would not
[02:42:30.320 --> 02:42:37.200]  have any difficulties on either side of the aisle whoever was in control of the american political
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:43.680]  system and that's the very corporate takeover of politics the on both sides of the atlantic
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:49.760]  we've been suffering from so grievously in the last decades well that's right because when they
[02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:53.840]  take the money they then also get basically corrupted into it and that's right he came up with
[02:42:53.840 --> 02:42:58.640]  the carbon tax playing with al gore you can say what you want about climate change or this and that
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:05.360]  but clearly paying the political class carbon money is what has basically tainted the whole thing
[02:43:05.360 --> 02:43:11.040]  and and kin lane came up with smart meters to gouge people i mean so many things that we now
[02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:16.880]  see today were the brainchild of kin lane why do you think if he had yeah he was a very bad man
[02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:23.840]  but we're not just going after him because he was a very bad man it's because he exemplifies
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:30.720]  personifies literally personifies this corrupt political corporate class that has ruined the
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:38.080]  lives of so many tens of millions on both sides of the atlantic and by telling his story by going
[02:43:38.080 --> 02:43:44.720]  looking for him we're also going looking for the corrupt politicians sure that he bought and paid
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:51.440]  for and who undoubtedly protected him and may even have faked his death of course they did
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:57.440]  let's shift gears over into maybe gonna steal a million why not steal a trillion if you're gonna
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:01.600]  lie a little and launch a whole war that kills a million people according to land's it why not
[02:44:01.600 --> 02:44:06.000]  stage the death of one guy of course they did the evidence is overwhelming but but let's get back
[02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:09.840]  into the other film you guys are crowdsourcing and kaiser better make these because i always got
[02:44:09.840 --> 02:44:12.960]  the money to make them anyways the point is people should support it because i want to see these
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:20.400]  films especially with you in them what about um tony blair i mean he clearly with the downing
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:24.800]  street memo the white house memo well you're the expert on it i mean we've got the evidence he's a
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:30.000]  war criminal and if we can punish one of these criminals even in the court of public opinion
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:35.840]  it won't it will it will stop them doing it next time well alex in the court of public opinion
[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:43.040]  tony blair has already tried and convicted he's like uh that character in the movie ghostwriter
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:49.600]  he spends most of his time out of britain because he can't walk down any street in britain every time
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:56.320]  he sits down in a restaurant somebody tries to perform a citizen's arrest upon him and his
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:05.760]  gauliters and his lieutenants who suffer similar fates and so in public opinion this man is destroyed
[02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:12.560]  in britain because it's seen that he lied us into a war in which a million people perished
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:18.640]  and which cascaded this extremism around the world that we've been talking about but companies
[02:45:18.640 --> 02:45:25.760]  keep hiring him banks in particular but oil companies and other corporate interests to a
[02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:32.640]  fantastic tune it's never been known in british politics before for a former prime minister
[02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:40.800]  to do other than retire to a country estate sedately advise us from time to time on international
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:49.120]  it's a delayed it's a delayed payoff yeah but now we've got a situation where the new class
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:56.400]  of politicians are being told if you play ball with the right interests they'll look after you
[02:45:57.040 --> 02:46:04.080]  after your term of office is over and that is just fatal for the political system all right
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:10.480]  because if you're legislating for banks and the military industrial complex and other
[02:46:10.480 --> 02:46:16.320]  commercial interests in their interests with a view to them hiring you when you're finished
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:21.360]  how can the public expect good governance as a result sure so how does it all end how does it
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:26.160]  all end because it's clearly the fruit is rotting now they're getting away with everything and
[02:46:26.160 --> 02:46:30.000]  historically that causes megalomania how does it end you mean you predicted how all the other
[02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:35.200]  stuff would go the last decade what's going to happen now i think it'll end okay alex and that's
[02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:41.200]  where maybe you and i would part company at this point in this sense because i believe that the
[02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:49.040]  fruit is rotting is falling off the trees in the sense that people have absolutely no faith
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:54.880]  in the political class which governs them and they're right not to do so i know i agree with him
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:47:00.880]  i agree with him that does not yet have a form a physical form of an alternative power at least
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:08.400]  not in your country or mine in many other parts of europe for example an anti-political class is
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:16.800]  beginning to germinate to continue your your metaphor and is bearing new fruits some of
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:24.080]  it i like some of it i don't like but it's all new power coming through because people have
[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:32.480]  entirely lost faith in the old ways and the old ways are no longer able to govern as they were
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:38.960]  otherwise we'd now be a war with syria and iran and with russia and china on the other side of
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:45.760]  that war in the british parliament we stopped dead the juggernaut of war which was about to
[02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:52.560]  take off and begin bombing syria because we did so president obama was not able to take off
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:59.200]  and do the heavy lifting the majority of the bombing we stopped the war on syria no george i agree with
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:05.920]  you in it and iran would be belligerent and goodness knows where that would have all ended up
[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:12.880]  we stopped that because the political class is now terrified of the public in britain the politicians
[02:48:12.880 --> 02:48:18.960]  know that the public hate them regard them as thieves who fill their own pockets with the
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:25.040]  public's money sure and legislate for corporate interests for vested interests rather than in
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:31.440]  the interests of the people and sooner or later that will find its expression in new political
[02:48:31.440 --> 02:48:38.560]  parties new political personalities or radical changes in the direction of the parties let me
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:43.040]  add this let me add this george when i was in the uk last year to cover in protest bill deberg
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:48.080]  that almost all the police you name it we're telling us hey we're on your side we hate the
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:53.680]  people in there we know this is going on we know there's a shadow government and and i and it was
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:58.720]  across the political spectrum people were really angry in england uh you know they're north of
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:03.680]  london and wadford they're in the uk so no we don't disagree there's a huge awakening but the
[02:49:03.680 --> 02:49:10.400]  political class is militarizing and racing to authoritarianism and having the nsa and you
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:16.560]  know your nsa spy on parliament spy on the senate to the point of i mean the battle's being joined
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:23.120]  is what i'm saying no well i agree with that i i'm just i think a little more confident than you
[02:49:23.120 --> 02:49:29.280]  perhaps i'm not forgive me if i'm wrong that we will prevail i don't believe we will go to
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:35.200]  authoritarianism fascism is not possible in the united states or the united kingdom i don't think
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:40.080]  the people would tolerate it but that's not a fruit that falls off the tree you have to shake the
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:48.640]  tree to make sure that people avoid that perilous fate on that definitely we would agree all that's
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:54.160]  required for the triumph of evil is that good men and women do nothing that's right and we've got to
[02:49:54.160 --> 02:50:00.240]  make sure and you're busy on that so am i we've got to make sure that the people do what's necessary
[02:50:00.240 --> 02:50:05.440]  to do to stop that fate well i want to get you back as soon as you go down there to try to cover
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:10.880]  his ranch and give us coverage and george galloway dot com respect party dot org i really appreciate

[02:54:36.800 --> 02:54:40.640]  look at this the economist says paramilitary police cops or soldiers
[02:54:40.640 --> 02:54:44.960]  america's police have become too militarized suddenly i'm seeing wall street journal new york
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:50.560]  times the economist all saying we have dangerous paramilitary armies being built in the us
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:56.000]  well the issue is i'm not even worried if they had militarized trained units of police
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:00.400]  to deal with that you know the the heavily armed threats sometimes because i want us
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.640]  to be able to have guns so sometimes it's gonna be bad guys that are heavily armed my issue is
[02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:08.240]  that they're trained with the citizens where you don't instantly do what they say they start
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:15.760]  tazering you or attack you that's all military type checkpoint training and you know the tsa
[02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:21.440]  training and the checkpoint training that's all militarization martial law stuff it's the martial
[02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:28.640]  law that's bad not the cops you know in SWAT team outfits the problem is is that now all the units
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:33.760]  want to be in SWAT teams and now they come do a regular you know visit because they heard about
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:37.920]  a domestic dispute so they come with a SWAT team that is the militarization that is the problem
[02:55:37.920 --> 02:55:45.120]  the overuse of it and now the establishment's talking about it which just means it's become so
[02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:50.880]  ubiquitous that people are getting scared of it uh poach the military is routinely in plain
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:55.040]  clothes with the SWAT teams just everybody knows since the late 80s we've got all the documents on
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:56:03.440]  that in my film the road to tyranny which really is a seminal documentary um let's uh go right now
[02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:09.040]  to Scott in Washington go ahead you're on the air thanks for holding oh yes uh like i'm so glad
[02:56:09.040 --> 02:56:14.800]  you brought up that piece with uh Al Sharpton and the race hustling and all of that let me give you
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:23.280]  the irony of mr reverend matt and daddy pimp Sharpton now go back to 1964 and i know you had
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:30.640]  reverend uh brian on and you've mentioned this in passing about Robert Byrd being a part of the kkk
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:37.600]  and you know this is the guy that filibustered the uh 1964 act but most there's a little fact
[02:56:37.600 --> 02:56:42.720]  toward that most people either don't know or are forgotten about is the fact that not only
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:49.520]  did he filibuster it but what he used to filibuster was some scientific study from a guy by the name
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:56.080]  of boas stating that the black brain was inferior to the white brain because it didn't weigh as much
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:57:02.000]  so it wasn't because he uh ejected on some kind of a you know constitution of well and that was
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:07.360]  all a eugenics thing like with scamming weights when the people they chose to do the test so none
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:12.960]  of it even means anything no i mean obviously Al Sharpton got mad and so the rest of ms mbc about
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:18.640]  that unifying speech ran paul gave so he basically did you know what in the punch pole i mean that
[02:57:18.640 --> 02:57:25.360]  that's all he's doing get to 46 years later when that piece of experiment died here you've got him
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:30.640]  sitting up there one of the people you were jive and that is being on top of all yeah well he was
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:35.440]  a part of it and step up the guy change which was a kind of part because never actually did
[02:57:36.080 --> 02:57:42.080]  but he's sitting up here talking about what ram paul might have done in 1963 when he was all
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:47.600]  of maybe a year old when that thing passed so you know that's one of the ironies you know exactly
[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:52.720]  they've taken the civil rights act and used parts of it to make christians pay for abortions i mean
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:59.440]  churches shouldn't have to do that and you should be able to you know not rent to somebody if if
[02:57:59.440 --> 02:58:04.000]  if they're a devil or should burn your christian or vice versa if you're atheist and and you know
[02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:08.720]  the whole issue is there's problems there's evils on both sides ram paul's is trying to be honest
[02:58:08.720 --> 02:58:13.440]  and saying look you know uh should be able to have private clubs should it be able to have
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:18.400]  stuff you know private golf course where you know say black folks say we don't this or that just
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:23.280]  because it's racist or whatever it is or white folks do it that's somewhat of the freedom and we
[02:58:23.280 --> 02:58:30.080]  can debate that the point is is that rand paul is not a racist rand paul's trying to unify people
[02:58:30.080 --> 02:58:34.320]  and that's why they don't like it because we're all getting spied on by the nsa we're all getting
[02:58:34.320 --> 02:58:37.600]  far and banks looting our bank accounts thank you so much for the call we're gonna come back and

[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:27.680]  all right we're in overdrive let's cut a patrick in oklahoma you're on the air thanks for calling
[03:00:27.680 --> 03:00:35.680]  me hi alex yon patrick i'm a pastor in oklahoma and i just wanted to give you a kind of my view
[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:40.320]  on your show i've been listening for a number of years i really enjoy particularly the news
[03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:45.680]  that you'll hear from your show you can't hear anywhere else but noticing more and more over
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:51.680]  the last two years alex that your show has a lot more to do with spiritual things to talk about
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:56.000]  you know evil and you know what satan is doing on the earth and everything and i understand that
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:01:00.800]  i agree with a lot of the things you have to say about that but i did just want to bring up to you
[03:01:00.800 --> 03:01:06.880]  and and make aware to you something about that in particular that when you are you know searching
[03:01:06.880 --> 03:01:14.160]  and looking at you know in looking in the face of the evil day to day it really can have an effect
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:22.560]  on you and um you know the word says for instance that uh we are to be wise concerning what is good
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:27.520]  and simple concerning what is evil and so of course i mean it also you know you probably know
[03:01:27.520 --> 03:01:31.760]  this well undoubtedly i know when you start getting into preacher territory the preachers will start
[03:01:31.760 --> 03:01:36.480]  judging you for what you do or what you say and i'm the first person to tell you you know that i
[03:01:36.480 --> 03:01:40.160]  come off you know more like a drill sergeant than a preacher and i'm not saying i'm a preacher
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:45.120]  and i am desperately wicked so i'm not judging anybody here i mean i just you know what it is
[03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:50.720]  i'm getting more and more real with people on air what you get on air now in the 19 years i've been
[03:01:50.720 --> 03:01:56.880]  on air is exactly what i'm like i was never fake but i'd hold back and stuff man i just say what i'm
[03:01:56.880 --> 03:02:02.560]  thinking i and i am who i am you are getting what i'm like if we were out on the dock fishing i mean
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:08.880]  this is who this is who i am this is it and i understand um the only thing that i wanted to
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:15.360]  mention to you was just this that um there is a danger in only searching and looking for what is
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:19.360]  evil in this world it actually absolutely has an effect on you i've seen it happen in too many
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:23.120]  many times oh my gosh i was thinking that this morning that the big point i wanted to have as
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:28.880]  a talking point was look at the good in the world because we only cover the bad in the world uh then
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:33.680]  it almost becomes a disease but i'm exposing the evil so that we can protect the good but i get
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:37.840]  what you're saying and i've told my reporters let's cover good stuff cops do and good things
[03:02:37.840 --> 03:02:41.760]  politicians do and i was doing that earlier in the show you know about movies with good messages
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:47.600]  versus bad i did and i agreed with you there um the only thing i want to get at is that when it
[03:02:47.600 --> 03:02:54.640]  comes to you exposing spiritual wickedness i also maybe suggest that hey perhaps we also make it uh
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:58.640]  it aware about spiritual good things i don't know if that would ever be something you could talk about
[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:02.640]  on your show or not well i do talk about the good stuff but listen god bless you and i appreciate
[03:03:02.640 --> 03:03:08.000]  your call man you know one good thing about the broadcast is it's totally real and see the pants
[03:03:08.000 --> 03:03:12.080]  that's also a bad thing about it because i mean i'll have my earpiece going my ear and say give me
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:15.600]  pliers on air not even thinking i just want the thing out of my ear should just go off the air
[03:03:15.600 --> 03:03:20.320]  going got pliers got them out i mean it looked ridiculous what i did that day but it just was
[03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:25.600]  spur of the moment it was like sliding into my ear and i just did it i mean i'm real folks i don't
[03:03:25.600 --> 03:03:30.080]  have time or energy to put on an act it is all i'm trying to say so you got to put up with me
[03:03:30.080 --> 03:03:35.120]  uh let's talk to ed in florida you're on the air go ahead hey how you doing Alex good brother
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:40.160]  hey i was calling in regard to uh the president's visit to orlando florida yesterday came to
[03:03:40.160 --> 03:03:44.080]  valencia college and i it was a private meeting so i'm assuming he wasn't there to promote the
[03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:48.400]  portable health care act but uh one thing we've been noticing turn i'm trying to come to orlando
[03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:53.200]  is that the chemtrol stopped the day before and the day off in the day after so it's always like
[03:03:53.200 --> 03:03:57.520]  you know we have perfect weather as i told my wife there is a geo engineering program going on and
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:01.920]  it's declassified the details aren't and it's aluminum dioxide barium salt the soil's building
[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:06.560]  up with it and they just play god they put stuff in our water they put stuff in our food it's all
[03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:11.840]  funny to them yeah it's crazy have you seen that trend other also in the country like for washington
[03:04:11.840 --> 03:04:16.720]  dc for example the not chemtrol there because a lot of the people who are involved in this are
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:21.280]  staying in that area for most yeah i don't know if it's what they call circumstantial evidence but
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:26.720]  i have heard about that trend yes interesting okay well care of currently good work i appreciate
[03:04:26.720 --> 03:04:31.520]  your let me call doctor sure but one thing when they're spraying something 10,000 20,000 30,000 feet
[03:04:32.800 --> 03:04:36.240]  it's creating persistent contrails to manipulate the weather and other things
[03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:41.040]  that stuff's coming down thousands of miles away in the jet stream so it's not like they don't spray
[03:04:41.040 --> 03:04:45.760]  up there that day because old bomb is there um so i don't know man all i know there's a
[03:04:45.760 --> 03:04:49.520]  bunch of secret stuff going on i'm sorry the other callers i've tried my best we're out of
[03:04:49.520 --> 03:04:54.320]  time great job to the crew nightly news back tonight seven o'clock central prison planet
