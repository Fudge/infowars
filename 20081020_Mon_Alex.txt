[01:24.960 --> 01:31.200]  of a lot of extremely important financial news today that I'll be covering also I just want to
[01:31.200 --> 01:38.320]  spend five ten minutes sometime today reviewing the film W thought my parents to come over last
[01:38.320 --> 01:45.840]  night after the Sunday radio show took my wife to CW getting all these great reviews and it was
[01:46.560 --> 01:55.520]  just an unspeakable piece of propaganda a film trying to endear George W Bush to the public
[01:55.520 --> 02:00.480]  liberals were going oh and you can tell they were liberals somewhere even wearing Barack
[02:00.480 --> 02:06.240]  Obama shirts around us and understanding him and loving him and he was being resuscitated
[02:06.240 --> 02:12.400]  basically he was being built back up as some type of idiot savant poor little darling and
[02:12.400 --> 02:17.360]  and you know he can't help but he's a mindless holy rolling Christian meanwhile all the real
[02:17.360 --> 02:24.080]  reports are George Bush is vicious to all of his underlings George Bush constantly is partying
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.440]  still he's part of skull and bones bohemian grove all the gay porn stars being shipped into the
[02:29.440 --> 02:37.840]  White House just just just unbelievable activities by him and it doesn't matter you know it's just
[02:37.840 --> 02:43.440]  it's all a left-right paradigm crazy well-meaning stupid Christians on one side and loving liberals
[02:43.440 --> 02:48.240]  on the other and George Bush senior is wonderful and electable who wants to give us a wonderful
[02:48.240 --> 02:54.400]  new world order they even talk about the new world order and oh it's we need the new world order
[02:54.400 --> 02:59.920]  you know not that not this not a system of the world falling apart that George W is proud of us
[02:59.920 --> 03:04.960]  and oh my goodness I wrote a whole page of notes once I got home last night but I was real tired
[03:04.960 --> 03:10.640]  at like 10 o'clock and for some reason and what I'm going to talk about won't even scratch the
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.960]  surface of what I witnessed and it isn't that we're just reviewing some movie in Oliver Stone
[03:17.360 --> 03:23.760]  you know isn't just about this movie W it's about the sales job of the coincidence theorist in our
[03:23.760 --> 03:29.280]  society who say governments just a bunch of well-meaning idiots and they just screw up and
[03:29.280 --> 03:34.640]  they don't know how to tie their shoelaces or even talk and they don't mean anything and
[03:35.440 --> 03:39.680]  you know they they really thought the WMDs were in Iraq when all the documents show they
[03:39.680 --> 03:45.920]  premeditatedly lied but not once you've seen this movie I mean there were people going oh
[03:45.920 --> 03:51.760]  and some woman behind me crying and and and all these neocons in the audience just lovingly looking
[03:51.760 --> 03:58.800]  up at George Bush the person playing George Bush and again Josh Brolin I've met him I think he's a
[03:58.800 --> 04:05.040]  great actor but I'm really disappointed in the fact that you know he's a handsome smart articulate guy
[04:05.040 --> 04:10.480]  and he looks a lot like Bush in a way but but you know like a good-looking George Bush whereas George
[04:10.480 --> 04:16.720]  Bush is a seedy burnout looking demonic looking George Bush he's kind of like James Brolin is
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.920]  is kind of like Superman James Brolin that's his dad and I don't know if they're Josh Brolin his son
[04:21.920 --> 04:29.280]  it let's say Superman and then we have the bizarro bush that's the real bush is kind of the parallel
[04:29.280 --> 04:39.280]  I would draw there so I hope Paul Watson Steve Watson or Kurt will do a review off of my rant
[04:39.280 --> 04:42.800]  I mean Kurt you live in New Mexico you can go see it I don't know if it's in theaters yet in England
[04:42.800 --> 04:48.640]  but I don't have the time or energy to write a review I got too much going on we're at Russian TV

[08:15.360 --> 08:19.360]  on the economic front i was on press tv for a full hour
[08:19.360 --> 08:28.800]  with their news breaks and commercial breaks was 46 minutes of airtime
[08:31.760 --> 08:38.320]  and i was up against a money magazine reporter out of england and a russian reporter obviously
[08:38.320 --> 08:44.480]  out of moscow and both these guys had no clue what was going on on the basics
[08:44.480 --> 08:51.040]  and then up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we posted the video sunday
[08:52.400 --> 08:56.960]  and i noticed that in both postings people commented in the comment section
[08:58.480 --> 09:07.040]  under the story and in other stories that alex is making this up he needs to show the proof
[09:07.040 --> 09:11.040]  he needs to show the documents that he's claiming on this tv show
[09:11.040 --> 09:18.960]  you know he's lying he's putting out this info i went on and i talked about how they were calling
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.960]  for a trilateral currency as they've been setting up since the 70s publicly with the
[09:22.960 --> 09:28.240]  trilateral commission i mentioned afp and said the videos linked up on info wars dot com
[09:28.240 --> 09:42.000]  of them calling for a global currency and i mean we had scores of stories posted and then
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.480]  a couple articles written the last few days by steve watson and paul watson and curtain emmo
[09:47.120 --> 09:51.120]  where in each story they'll link the three four five six ten you know depending on the story
[09:51.120 --> 09:57.600]  some of them have more than 10 links to every claim we make bloomberg ap roiders afp bbc
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.120]  financial times of london videotape of gordon brown press conferences prime minister of england
[10:03.120 --> 10:06.800]  uh... the president of france uh... sarcosi nicolas sarcosi
[10:06.800 --> 10:15.120]  merkel of germany borosso all of them and and i know that's disinformation when somebody takes
[10:15.120 --> 10:20.480]  the time out to go through story after story after story after story and say there's no proof he's lying
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.400]  when it's all right there so see all these years they said we were making it up there was no plan
[10:26.400 --> 10:30.880]  for north american union european union a mediterranean union an asian union an african union
[10:30.880 --> 10:37.840]  they've all been officially set up and i go on shows today and they and they and the and the
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.040]  british reporter said you're making that up it's a conspiracy theory and that's what i'd
[10:43.040 --> 10:48.000]  laughing at me and i said but i've got it all linked up on the site and people go on the message
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.440]  board say nope not real i have to believe this is not some most of this is not willful denial
[10:55.440 --> 11:00.960]  this is a disinformation now the pentagon admits they have think tanks and private grips and hired
[11:00.960 --> 11:06.400]  pr firms and regular troops at cent com quote fighting the blogging war quote countering
[11:06.960 --> 11:12.560]  anti-american disinfo anti-american is anything that tries to save the u.s save our sovereignty
[11:12.560 --> 11:19.040]  and stop the global corporate takeover that's the code word for it but uh... i'm not even here
[11:19.040 --> 11:23.440]  talking about myself being attacked or people trying to discredit me i'm talking about the
[11:23.440 --> 11:28.720]  the the tactics themselves that we don't just see with my website's prison planner dot com and
[11:28.720 --> 11:33.440]  info wars dot com and the others info wars dot net but but mainly info wars dot com prison
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.920]  planet dot com truth news dot us where there are comment sections on the stories
[11:41.440 --> 11:46.160]  i'm just talking about myself being attacked i'm talking about these these tactics themselves
[11:46.160 --> 11:54.960]  just the amazing denial that is going on in fact john i don't think i sent you
[11:56.560 --> 11:59.280]  this clip friday i played it on the sunday show yesterday
[12:00.640 --> 12:03.600]  but for a lot of people out there driving around their cars they won't believe it
[12:04.480 --> 12:10.640]  will you go to google because it's now from friday's news and actually thursday's news you
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.160]  won't be able to probably find out on the main page e u leaders call for global currency curtain
[12:16.160 --> 12:21.520]  memo info wars dot com e leaders call for global currency because instead of just reading the link
[12:21.520 --> 12:28.880]  to this a lot of people actually believe propaganda they will not even go find it they will just say
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.800]  out of hands are preconditioning that i'm lying right now so will you please go to that story
[12:34.800 --> 12:45.440]  because in it is an afp agency french press clip it's one minute two seconds long
[12:46.080 --> 12:50.640]  where they have the leaders on the podium calling for a one world government currency a one currency
[12:53.840 --> 12:59.280]  and uh we will play that it's for those that don't know why it's not the studio in minnesota
[12:59.280 --> 13:03.920]  i was in the austin studio we have two studios in austin the k lbj studios i know live out of
[13:03.920 --> 13:09.680]  my office studios are personal corporate headquarters and then we have the minnesota
[13:10.320 --> 13:15.680]  studios up there but but i mean this is the type of denial we're dealing with but but again
[13:15.680 --> 13:24.960]  is it really denial is it really denial that i can post links to literally it's got to be more
[13:24.960 --> 13:30.000]  than 25 mainstream news stories in the last week probably 50 or something the last two weeks i mean
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.360]  it's three or four stories a day i don't know what is three or four times seven yeah it's it's more
[13:35.360 --> 13:40.880]  than 20 to be upwards of 30 stories a week i haven't counted them up i mean they're just everywhere
[13:41.840 --> 13:47.840]  where mainstream news is saying this but i'm not allowed to comment on it if i say g uh the old
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.400]  timers told us 30 years ago and the government documents told us 25 years ago and all the
[13:52.400 --> 13:57.760]  think tank documents told us a decade ago that they were going to set up a global financial meltdown
[13:57.760 --> 14:02.160]  controlled by the private central banks they would then propose a world government body run by the
[14:02.160 --> 14:07.840]  private banks who would set the daily value of currencies and they would regulate basically all
[14:07.840 --> 14:13.760]  financial transactions stocks bonds derivatives your bank account world taxes on wiring money or
[14:13.760 --> 14:22.000]  any other financial uh type of digital transfers so the tubin tax expanded radically carbon taxes
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.080]  they propose that it's in the bank or takeover bill of three weeks ago it's in the bills that
[14:26.080 --> 14:32.160]  have passed in europe and in england and japan i mean it's all happening exactly as we told you
[14:32.960 --> 14:36.960]  because like i said it's like opening a tv guide up and they tell you what shows are coming on and
[14:36.960 --> 14:45.040]  what's going to happen and even as it's happening i have people emailing me and laughing at me and
[14:45.040 --> 14:49.360]  going and commenting on the sites and i know a lot of more people who bought into the lie bought
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.440]  into the disinfo it's cognitive dissidents they can't admit they've been calm they can't admit
[14:53.440 --> 14:58.080]  they were wrong they can't admit all this is really happening but the people that start the ball
[14:58.080 --> 15:04.160]  rolling that start the snowball going as it builds up our government disinfo and their fellow
[15:04.160 --> 15:08.960]  travelers with the system who work for major corporations in the media and the system who
[15:08.960 --> 15:13.600]  have a vested interest in and again saying they were right and saying we're wrong and and it
[15:13.600 --> 15:19.040]  didn't matter if i'm on iranian international tv you know Saudi Arabia's aljazeera that ranians have
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.800]  press tv i've got to say when i'm on these shows it's always two to one even on iranian tv they're
[15:24.800 --> 15:33.440]  that buffaloed with iranian tv international tv that every time i go on there it's it's two to one
[15:33.440 --> 15:40.880]  against me uh where so i mean they're quote being trying to be fair and balanced how is it fair
[15:42.480 --> 15:46.320]  i've seen national debates on tv where they're trying to be fair and they have one person on
[15:46.320 --> 15:51.440]  saying polar bears can't swim you know the debate about the ice is melting they're going to drown
[15:51.440 --> 15:57.040]  when the ice actually got 13 bigger in both Antarctic and arctic this year 13 percent
[15:57.600 --> 16:03.760]  its circumference increased they'll have a debate about oh no a polar bear is dying can't swim and
[16:03.760 --> 16:08.080]  and say well we're being fair and balanced we're showing someone that's lying and saying something
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.800]  on its face is ridiculous they're the strongest swimmer of any land animal
[16:12.800 --> 16:20.960]  that's a uh you know early stage re-entrant i guess you could call it turn into a dugon or
[16:20.960 --> 16:27.200]  a manatee if they keep it up and swim 300 miles recorded 150 routine swims they float on ice packs
[16:27.200 --> 16:33.680]  hunting seal hunting beluga smaller whale it's a fact doesn't matter i got people emailing me calling
[16:33.680 --> 16:38.800]  me it's in news polar bears can't swim look at them they're stuck on this ice flow with their babies
[16:38.800 --> 16:45.360]  they're all going to die and they go well we're going to be balanced uh so we'll just go ahead
[16:45.360 --> 16:50.560]  and say that they can't swim well it's the same thing with saying well we're going to be balanced
[16:50.560 --> 16:55.200]  our other guests say there is no call for a trilateral global currency set by one group but
[16:55.200 --> 17:02.720]  an asian controlled index a european controlled index that encompasses africa and the mediterranean
[17:02.720 --> 17:08.960]  union and the north american core group a core system with the subgroups i mean that's in the
[17:08.960 --> 17:15.200]  club of rome that's in the un back in the 60s in game covers it thousands of documents all admitted
[17:16.480 --> 17:21.680]  and now it's all coming out in all the mainstream news and people are in denial
[17:23.440 --> 17:28.000]  folks we can no longer be in denial about this we have to face the problem instead of always
[17:28.000 --> 17:41.040]  being stuck in the debate of does it exist here is um afp clip the last 10 seconds this is this is
[17:41.040 --> 17:48.960]  the Reuters of europe agency french press reporting you can go read the transcripts of all this it's
[17:48.960 --> 17:53.280]  far worse than what you're just hearing here carbon taxes all of it admitting a global currency
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.480]  listen this is real i promise you please listen here it is
[18:01.840 --> 18:06.320]  another whiff of panic hit asian and european stock markets on thursday
[18:06.320 --> 18:09.840]  just as european leaders were meeting for a summit in brussels
[18:09.840 --> 18:15.120]  their aim show a unified front in efforts to reform the financial system bringing it back
[18:15.120 --> 18:20.480]  under control what's been the recipe for our recent success our unity coordination the will
[18:20.480 --> 18:26.640]  to move forward we can't give up faced with this crisis EU members have put pressure on the united
[18:26.640 --> 18:31.920]  states for an early meeting of the g8 with emerging countries the french president and the EU
[18:31.920 --> 18:36.720]  commission chief are to meet with the u.s president this weekend to discuss the proposal

[18:45.440 --> 18:54.960]  and the consultation with all our partners would allow us to make great progress europe

[24:58.080 --> 25:03.040]  defense in england saying the cameras and the face scanning cameras in the license plate scanning
[25:03.040 --> 25:08.560]  system is a control grid to track and trace you and that they're illegally taking dna from

[25:15.280 --> 25:20.480]  to you know get a cell phone so they can track it they're already tracking all the cell phones we
[25:20.480 --> 25:25.840]  told americans the nsa is listening to you they're listening to almost every phone conversation
[25:25.840 --> 25:32.320]  with ai computers for keywords emails faxes they built hubs in the 80s they expanded them in the
[25:32.320 --> 25:38.240]  90s and 96 well the telecommunications act uh where everything you fax or email goes through
[25:38.240 --> 25:45.920]  the nsa through computers i told you that whole floors at every major phone company are the nsa
[25:45.920 --> 25:56.240]  are run by the nsa i told you exactly specifically in 1996 over and over again in 97 98 99 2000
[25:56.240 --> 26:05.040]  2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 and in 2007 different people at at&t and other companies come out and
[26:05.040 --> 26:12.240]  say look whole floors are nsa everything goes through it now how did i know that i didn't
[26:12.240 --> 26:15.920]  have secret sources though i interviewed people like james bamford and others who's
[26:15.920 --> 26:23.200]  leading expert on the nsa former producer for nightline it was in the telecommunications act
[26:23.760 --> 26:31.360]  the funding for all of this states what's going on the truth is none of this is even really hidden
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.920]  it's just not put on the nightly news in fact they want people in the know to know they're
[26:35.920 --> 26:40.000]  under surveillance and it's come out the whole congress is listened to by a criminal element
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.360]  of the executive branch the executive branch isn't above them they can't do that they're not
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.800]  above the fourth amendment the parliament's spied on by the queen and mi five and six the real
[26:48.800 --> 26:53.040]  corporate government over the phony elected government that has no power it's like a bug
[26:53.040 --> 26:58.320]  that's had all its legs pulled off just kind of rolling around on its back does parliament get mad
[26:58.320 --> 27:02.640]  as parliament say we're the real government and you're in trouble and order people's arrest no
[27:04.000 --> 27:08.160]  and the members of parliament stick their head up they die of heart attacks or they get shot
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.600]  or they get run over or they die they slit their wrists and there's no blood at the scene
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.400]  and people see five guys in black uniforms run away from the dead body police say that
[27:18.400 --> 27:22.880]  and still the government says dr david kelly died splitting his wrist i mean they they they
[27:22.880 --> 27:31.440]  talked to us like we're little kids and then it comes out exactly as i told you the nsh is built
[27:31.440 --> 27:41.440]  in to all the hubs they paid nine billion dollars in 96 alone to upgrade the hubs everything goes
[27:41.440 --> 27:50.960]  through them all of it do you read me do you understand they have giant listening posts
[27:50.960 --> 27:58.000]  in every city picking up cb baby monitors baby cameras that runs into the nsa goes into boosters

[28:17.040 --> 28:22.160]  keep a record of it then it finally came out in 19 and 2005 remember when janet jackson

[28:26.960 --> 28:33.280]  it's two-way we watch you and still the public giggles and smirks and says oh the government
[28:33.280 --> 28:38.720]  doesn't spy on us then bush gets caught in a lie okay only al-qaeda phone calls and then abc news
[28:38.720 --> 28:41.520]  comes out and admits that's on the tip of the iceberg because they're just letting you know

[28:59.840 --> 29:06.080]  compartment that went public most the nsa stuff goes to private companies that are doing more
[29:06.080 --> 29:12.080]  intelligence gathering than the nsa and the national reconnaissance office and most of them
[29:12.080 --> 29:17.840]  are foreigners they have the english this is mainstream news spy on the americans they have
[29:17.840 --> 29:23.520]  the israeli spy on the americans the americans spy on the israelis and on the british the british
[29:23.520 --> 29:28.080]  spy on the germans the german spy on the british but it's all one integrated global government

[37:27.520 --> 37:28.520]  Here it is.
[37:28.520 --> 37:33.340]  Tonight's edition of Four Corners, we will examine the political and economic implications
[37:33.340 --> 37:36.840]  of this current rise and fall and other prices.
[37:36.840 --> 37:44.600]  With the help of an esteemed panel of guests joining me from Austin, we have Mr. Alex Jones,
[37:44.600 --> 37:51.400]  he's from the infowars.com website and also he's a documentary filmmaker and a nationally
[37:51.400 --> 37:59.920]  syndicated radio talk show host from Moscow will be joined by Anatoly Utkin from the USA
[37:59.920 --> 38:06.920]  and Canada Research Institute and finally by phone will be joined by Dominic Frisbee,
[38:06.920 --> 38:10.920]  a commentator from the Money Week magazine.
[38:10.920 --> 38:13.480]  A warm welcome to you all gentlemen.
[38:13.480 --> 38:19.640]  Now if I may begin with you Mr. Jones, back before the mortgage meltdown turned into the
[38:19.640 --> 38:26.080]  worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the country's, most countries basically biggest
[38:26.080 --> 38:29.600]  economic problem was perceived to be energy.
[38:29.600 --> 38:35.760]  Now a highly publicized view of oil markets is that the only thing wrong with the market
[38:35.760 --> 38:38.200]  is actually the market itself.
[38:38.200 --> 38:45.600]  Now have the fundamentals of the market disappeared altogether and what's the change?
[38:45.600 --> 38:51.760]  Well two things are happening, you have global liquidation going on as people, institutions
[38:51.760 --> 38:56.400]  and individuals worldwide especially the United States, England and Europe get out of the
[38:56.400 --> 39:02.360]  stock market because of fears and so yes then there's less money in the market for speculation
[39:02.360 --> 39:08.120]  in oil but over 70% of the increase in the price of oil in the last five years has really
[39:08.120 --> 39:14.240]  been due to inflation and devaluation of the dollar which of course is the world reserve
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.840]  currency but what we're seeing now with the multi-trillion dollar bailouts in Europe and
[39:18.840 --> 39:25.600]  the United States being put into less than 10 central banks which are predominantly owned
[39:25.600 --> 39:31.080]  by private families is they are over capitalizing themselves while cutting off capital for the
[39:31.080 --> 39:33.920]  rest of the markets liquidity and credit.
[39:33.920 --> 39:38.280]  So by design they are bringing in, we have the documents on this, it's being headed up
[39:38.280 --> 39:42.440]  of course by Goldman Sachs, the entire operation is being run by former and current Goldman
[39:42.440 --> 39:48.480]  Sachs operatives to bring the world into a deep contraction and so that's also part of
[39:48.480 --> 39:55.280]  the oil prices going down as markets worldwide factor in the fact that we have an expanding
[39:55.280 --> 40:00.240]  global recession but this is being engineered by design.
[40:00.240 --> 40:09.360]  Now in Moscow Anatoly Utkin what's your assessment of the changing fundamentals of the market?
[40:09.360 --> 40:18.680]  It happened quite unexpectedly that such countries as China and India became giants of the world
[40:18.680 --> 40:28.360]  economy and they are now asking the same amount of petroleum as it was enough only for western
[40:28.360 --> 40:31.160]  Europe or America.
[40:31.160 --> 40:39.840]  You know this world is living in inequality, if you imagine that the whole world is taking
[40:39.840 --> 40:48.160]  the amount of petroleum as America has, United States of America, we need seven more planets
[40:48.160 --> 40:52.600]  because one planet is not enough even for this one country.
[40:52.600 --> 41:01.240]  So in my opinion we are now coming straight on to the depth of economic depression and
[41:01.240 --> 41:11.960]  the reason of it, I remember the 1970s, approximately the same period and we saw the small cars
[41:11.960 --> 41:17.520]  all over the world built in Japan and different other countries.
[41:17.520 --> 41:26.680]  Nowadays huge tanks are coming all over the roads in western Europe, in the United States,
[41:26.680 --> 41:28.920]  in Russia nowadays.
[41:28.920 --> 41:37.240]  So we are unreasonable, we are provoking the biggest possible crisis in our time.
[41:37.240 --> 41:46.160]  The gold is standing high and the petroleum is coming twice less, you know, 145.
[41:46.160 --> 41:55.840]  It was in May this year and nowadays around 70 billion, 70 dollars per barrel.
[41:55.840 --> 42:02.200]  Okay, now Dominic Frisbee, given what we heard from the other two panelists, do you agree
[42:02.200 --> 42:08.400]  with the sense that there is a major problem facing humanity on this planet and that is
[42:08.400 --> 42:10.840]  inadequacy basically of resources?
[42:10.840 --> 42:16.880]  Yes, well, hello Jubeen and thank you very much for having me on your show.
[42:16.880 --> 42:17.880]  Our pleasure.
[42:17.880 --> 42:23.520]  Yes, I do agree with your other two panelists that we have a major shortage of resources
[42:23.520 --> 42:24.520]  in the world.
[42:24.520 --> 42:28.840]  I think there's a, I believe in peak oil, I also happen to believe that there are major
[42:28.840 --> 42:33.840]  shortages in other essential items such as copper.
[42:33.840 --> 42:41.840]  But what we have seen since July and whether this is engineered or not remains to be seen.
[42:41.840 --> 42:47.840]  But what we have seen since July is a huge trend reversal.
[42:47.840 --> 42:56.880]  Now over the past three or four, five years, the central trade has been short the dollar
[42:56.880 --> 43:04.240]  and long commodities and other anti-dollar trades and the dollar has been in this massive
[43:04.240 --> 43:13.560]  decline and suddenly in July, the dollar turned around and reversed up and we had, and the
[43:13.560 --> 43:20.440]  dollar has been in an uptrend ever since and that has meant that all those anti-dollar
[43:20.440 --> 43:28.120]  trades, be it gold, be it oil, be it base metals, whatever it is, have suddenly switched
[43:28.120 --> 43:30.360]  and gone into a downtrend.
[43:30.360 --> 43:39.320]  Now the problem is that various investors and funds worldwide in order to maximise their
[43:39.320 --> 43:46.760]  gains on their anti-dollar trade were leveraging up their positions.
[43:46.760 --> 43:52.640]  Now when you leverage up a position, you just need the market to go against you to just
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.840]  a few per cent and suddenly you've lost all your capital.
[43:56.840 --> 44:04.560]  So this change in direction in the dollar since July has brought about this sudden immense
[44:04.560 --> 44:11.960]  global deleveraging and it's meant that everyone has suddenly had to close their positions and
[44:11.960 --> 44:17.080]  that has exaggerated the fall in everything.
[44:17.080 --> 44:22.800]  As a kind of extra note, the oil, the way oil trades, if you look at the patterns it
[44:22.800 --> 44:29.000]  makes out, it always exaggerates to the upside and it always exaggerates to the downside.
[44:29.000 --> 44:36.960]  It's just one of the characteristics of that particular commodity and $147 went to that
[44:36.960 --> 44:41.840]  price quickly and the same is happening in reverse.
[44:41.840 --> 44:42.840]  Okay.
[44:42.840 --> 44:43.840]  Austin?
[44:43.840 --> 44:44.840]  Let me comment on that.
[44:44.840 --> 44:48.920]  Sure, I'd like to comment on that.
[44:48.920 --> 44:49.920]  None of this is my opinion.
[44:49.920 --> 44:54.920]  If you go to my news websites, infowars.com and prismplanet.com and go back a year ago,
[44:54.920 --> 44:59.880]  two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, we put out the news reports.
[44:59.880 --> 45:03.720]  We had the people inside Bilderberg Group and other European elite organisations.
[45:03.720 --> 45:07.480]  They planned to by design run oil up.
[45:07.480 --> 45:13.440]  They planned to also pop the subprime mortgage and cause the derivatives crisis we're seeing.
[45:13.440 --> 45:14.760]  So I just want to be clear.
[45:14.760 --> 45:17.040]  I do not believe we're running out of resources.
[45:17.040 --> 45:22.360]  In fact, there's more oil than ever and we see that being illustrated by the price of
[45:22.360 --> 45:24.560]  oil almost being cut in half.
[45:24.560 --> 45:30.080]  That shows how much manipulation was in the market and I agree with the last guest, Mr.
[45:30.080 --> 45:36.360]  Frisbee, on the point of a lot of this speculation being anti-dollar and then now that the dollar
[45:36.360 --> 45:40.320]  has gone up, it's gyrated way in the other direction.
[45:40.320 --> 45:42.600]  But that's only in the short term.
[45:42.600 --> 45:46.360]  By next summer, I think clearly from all the evidence we have, oil is going to be back
[45:46.360 --> 45:48.680]  up to about $100 a barrel.
[45:48.680 --> 45:53.680]  We're going to see hyperinflation in the United States but also in Europe and we're
[45:53.680 --> 46:01.760]  going to see upwards of 25% inflation by 2009 in the United States, about 15% in Europe
[46:01.760 --> 46:03.400]  and that's going to compound.
[46:03.400 --> 46:05.320]  So we have two things happening here.
[46:05.320 --> 46:11.280]  We have massive depressionary consolidations and liquidation going on in mid-level banks,
[46:11.280 --> 46:16.800]  institutions, corporations, private individuals, city governments, county governments, national
[46:16.800 --> 46:17.800]  governments.
[46:17.800 --> 46:20.480]  That's all contracting with tax bases, contracting.
[46:20.480 --> 46:25.040]  So we have a depression in the real economy forming but over that, we have the international
[46:25.040 --> 46:30.080]  financial order in their own documents and Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner for economics
[46:30.080 --> 46:31.280]  has talked about this.
[46:31.280 --> 46:33.840]  The Financial Times of London last week talked about it.
[46:33.840 --> 46:38.880]  One business week this week admitted that six private banks that are the shareholders
[46:38.880 --> 46:44.560]  of the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, these private families, they are massing
[46:44.560 --> 46:46.640]  capital and power.
[46:46.640 --> 46:50.920]  The bailouts are not for them, are not for the people.
[46:50.920 --> 46:56.680]  It is for the big central banks so they'll be flushing cash and liquidity while by design
[46:56.680 --> 47:02.120]  they implode the real economy, then they have all the real assets and capital as the implosion
[47:02.120 --> 47:07.240]  happens, they can then buy up world stock markets, companies, defense contractors and
[47:07.240 --> 47:09.140]  others worldwide.
[47:09.140 --> 47:13.960]  So this is a global consolidation by design and if you'd like I can go through some of
[47:13.960 --> 47:17.320]  those documents and facts and give your viewers the proof of it.
[47:17.320 --> 47:18.840]  This is the new world order.
[47:18.840 --> 47:23.840]  Five years ago we said in 2008 this would really start and it's on record, I made films
[47:23.840 --> 47:29.680]  about it, three years ago I released a film about it, last year I released a film documenting
[47:29.680 --> 47:34.960]  it showing how after they had started the implosion they would then call for a world
[47:34.960 --> 47:39.720]  banking system run by the private banks that would set the price of currencies each day
[47:39.720 --> 47:45.240]  and have global regulation over the financial system worldwide in the name of stopping the
[47:45.240 --> 47:47.920]  type of crisis we're now seeing.
[47:47.920 --> 47:52.480]  The very global banks that engineered the derivatives crisis and everything we're seeing, the very
[47:52.480 --> 47:56.520]  global banks that are still suppressing the price of gold, the very global banks that
[47:56.520 --> 48:01.960]  are manipulating all the commodities, they're the ones that engineered all this, Paulson's
[48:01.960 --> 48:07.520]  the one that changed the rules here in the U.S. in 1999 so they could do all this leveraging
[48:07.520 --> 48:13.200]  with unlimited fractional reserve banking and now they're posing as the saviors saying
[48:13.200 --> 48:19.680]  we need a global government run by the banks, a global government run by the banks, they're
[48:19.680 --> 48:24.120]  the very ones that depart from you for a moment, only engage with the panelists.
[48:24.120 --> 48:26.920]  Then they go back to the British guy and the Russian guy and the British guy basically
[48:26.920 --> 48:32.400]  says oh that's all imaginary, it's all a coincidence, it's all by accident, yes the banks are the
[48:32.400 --> 48:36.760]  ones that caused all of it but they're going to save us basically.
[48:36.760 --> 48:40.040]  I mean it's ridiculous when we have all the documents, we tell you what they're going
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.920]  to do not years but decades before.
[48:43.920 --> 48:48.320]  This is a global plan, a global operation, we'll play part two later, like I said there's
[48:48.320 --> 48:56.600]  another 30 something minutes of it up on PrisonPlanet.com right there, meanwhile you have secret
[48:56.600 --> 49:01.360]  banking meetings every week in Europe, England, the United States where the details are not
[49:01.360 --> 49:07.080]  released but then we learn that hundreds of billions a week of taxpayer money are being
[49:07.080 --> 49:10.760]  handed over to the private banks and then they say oh we promised to buy up all the
[49:10.760 --> 49:13.800]  bad debt, we promised to buy up the subprime mortgages and share those up but we're not
[49:13.800 --> 49:17.520]  even going to do that now, we're going to have the government take a position in the
[49:17.520 --> 49:21.920]  banks but with no control, no voting stock so it's the private corporations, the private
[49:21.920 --> 49:26.200]  banks taking over government and being given government immunity and government power through
[49:26.200 --> 49:30.080]  the banker takeover bills known as banker bailout bills which are all basically the
[49:30.080 --> 49:35.000]  same being passed worldwide to merge into this larger system.
[49:35.000 --> 49:39.920]  And then the unbelievable happened, there are multiple mainstream news articles like
[49:39.920 --> 49:46.320]  this Jonathan Tyrone story, European Central Bank members, tripolar currency will emerge,
[49:46.320 --> 49:53.440]  European Central Bank Council member Ed Wald notony said a tripolar global currency system
[49:53.440 --> 49:58.240]  is developing between Asia, Europe and the United States and that his skeptical US dollar
[49:58.240 --> 50:02.480]  centrality or the US dollar being a world reserve currency can be revived.
[50:02.480 --> 50:07.120]  What I see is a system where we have more centers of gravity, he said today in an interview
[50:07.120 --> 50:13.920]  with Austrian state broadcaster ORFTV, I see the future of tripolar development, I don't
[50:13.920 --> 50:18.880]  think that there will be fixed exchanges rates between these polls.
[50:18.880 --> 50:24.120]  The leaders of the US of France and the European Commission will ask other world leaders to
[50:24.120 --> 50:29.680]  join in a series of summits on the global financial crisis beginning in the US soon after the
[50:29.680 --> 50:34.160]  number four potential election, President George Bush, Prince President Nicholas Arcozz
[50:34.160 --> 50:42.280]  the European president, Jose Barroso said in a statement yesterday and it goes into
[50:42.280 --> 50:44.760]  the Bretton Woods saying the dollar system is dead.
[50:44.760 --> 50:50.080]  Now what do we always say they do, implode the dollar, set up a world system, implode
[50:50.080 --> 50:53.240]  the currencies of the planet, not just the dollar, they have a battle between the three
[50:53.240 --> 50:57.800]  trilateral currencies controlled by the same groups and out of that a centralized monetary
[50:57.800 --> 51:00.800]  system you're watching unfold.
[51:00.800 --> 51:02.280]  Honey have you seen the remote?
[51:02.280 --> 51:04.440]  Sweetie have you seen my car keys?
[51:04.440 --> 51:06.720]  I can't find my wallet.
[51:06.720 --> 51:07.720]  Sound familiar?
[51:07.720 --> 51:11.620]  Why not save time looking for lost things and lose the stress instead introducing our
[51:11.620 --> 51:16.280]  patent and find one find all key finders or FOFAXD for short.
[51:16.280 --> 51:20.400]  Once a FOFA key finder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can find
[51:20.400 --> 51:22.440]  and be found by all the rest.
[51:22.440 --> 51:26.840]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control or any of them to
[51:26.840 --> 51:28.840]  find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[51:28.840 --> 51:32.760]  The possibilities are endless, FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets
[51:32.760 --> 51:36.880]  up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90 plus decibel beep.
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.360]  Got the remote.
[51:38.360 --> 51:40.480]  Oh my keys.
[51:40.480 --> 51:41.680]  Here's my wallet.
[51:41.680 --> 51:46.680]  Order your FOFA today with batteries included along with a 30 day money bag guarantee by
[51:46.680 --> 51:51.760]  calling find one find all at 866-245-8670.

[51:58.040 --> 52:00.200]  That's find one find all dot com.
[52:00.200 --> 52:06.000]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[52:06.000 --> 52:07.500]  against this country.
[52:07.500 --> 52:11.760]  The enemy struck America on September 11th, but who is the enemy?
[52:11.760 --> 52:12.760]  bin Laden.
[52:12.760 --> 52:13.760]  This is his ammo.
[52:13.760 --> 52:14.760]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[52:14.760 --> 52:16.880]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:16.880 --> 52:21.520]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[52:21.520 --> 52:24.120]  networks inside the United States.
[52:24.120 --> 52:28.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying
[52:28.560 --> 52:30.760]  in and on the U.S.
[52:30.760 --> 52:34.440]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.440 --> 52:39.880]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[52:39.880 --> 52:43.920]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much
[52:43.920 --> 52:44.920]  much more.
[52:44.920 --> 52:45.920]  Fabled Enemies.

[52:51.200 --> 53:01.760]  titles at prisonplanet.tv either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[53:01.760 --> 53:06.480]  This is Mike from Baker Creek heirloom seed company.
[53:06.480 --> 53:12.440]  We carry America's largest selection of heirloom seed, all non-hybrid, non-GMO, and non-Monsanto.
[53:12.440 --> 53:16.600]  We offer 1200 varieties that our grandparents grew, vegetables that helped us survive the
[53:16.600 --> 53:20.680]  Great Depression, varieties that our founding fathers grew, and varieties that not only

[53:57.640 --> 53:58.640]  Unbelievable.
[53:58.640 --> 54:27.240]  Bloomberg, other publications, all over the foreign press, trot polar world currency,
[54:27.240 --> 54:31.680]  set by their national consortium of private banks that are going to levy taxes on money
[54:31.680 --> 54:35.680]  transfers, stock transfers, banking.
[54:35.680 --> 54:39.160]  That's a worldwide control grid tracking all money.
[54:39.160 --> 54:45.000]  They will set the interest rates worldwide over three regions.
[54:45.000 --> 54:50.200]  Under those sub regions, North American Union, Caribbean Union, Asian Union, they have the
[54:50.200 --> 54:54.200]  sub directorates, the nine sub regions under each one.
[54:54.200 --> 54:58.280]  Those sub regions fit into 10 larger regions.
[54:58.280 --> 55:07.280]  You have 10 total kingdoms as it's called the Club of Rome CFR-UN, 10 kingdoms.
[55:07.280 --> 55:15.240]  And then over those 10 kingdoms, you have the three central kingdoms that then the other
[55:15.240 --> 55:18.080]  seven sit under.
[55:18.080 --> 55:19.080]  You understand that?
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.680]  You have three global kingdoms with 10 under it.
[55:22.680 --> 55:25.880]  And each one of those kingdoms is broken into 10 regions.
[55:25.880 --> 55:28.680]  It's like we have 10 FEMA regions.
[55:28.680 --> 55:35.120]  The European Union has 10 main regions, even with its 25-member bloc now.
[55:35.120 --> 55:38.200]  You can go pull this up, but this is real.
[55:38.200 --> 55:42.720]  This is happening in your face.
[55:42.720 --> 55:47.040]  And then a lot of people on the left say, well, global governments, first we were hunter-gatherer
[55:47.040 --> 55:58.240]  than agrarian farmers, then city-states in Egypt and what was then Babylon, on the Tigris
[55:58.240 --> 56:05.480]  Euphrates, China.
[56:05.480 --> 56:11.920]  Then we went from the city-states into empires, and we went into the Renaissance and the re-emergence
[56:11.920 --> 56:16.440]  of the nation-states setting up their own empires, and they say, oh, that's the logical
[56:16.440 --> 56:21.600]  extension of global confederation and global system, global governance.
[56:21.600 --> 56:24.360]  It'll be loving and wonderful, and the machines will do everything for us.
[56:24.360 --> 56:28.360]  That's what the UN says what they all say, but what are the machines they're setting
[56:28.360 --> 56:29.360]  up to do?
[56:29.360 --> 56:33.800]  Control, track, trace, make humans obsolete.
[56:33.800 --> 56:35.400]  What do the top New World Order people say?
[56:35.400 --> 56:38.920]  Like Bill Jo and others, they say the elite plan to exterminate 80% of us.
[56:38.920 --> 56:42.720]  Dr. Michael Kaufman coming up in about five minutes, and he's going to get into that.
[56:42.720 --> 56:50.160]  Let's get him on right at the start of this next hour.
[56:50.160 --> 56:51.520]  You know what this means to your family?
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.480]  What this means to your future?
[56:53.480 --> 56:57.240]  You know what hyperinflation is going to do to your standard of living, but so you're
[56:57.240 --> 57:00.280]  comfortable right now, even though the economy is shutting down, you can still get plenty
[57:00.280 --> 57:07.360]  of food, plenty of entertainment, you're mesmerized by the idiot box, and so you can't break
[57:07.360 --> 57:10.960]  out of the controlled paradigm.
[57:10.960 --> 57:15.320]  Even many of us that are awake, I mean, I'm so busy fighting the New World Order, I don't
[57:15.320 --> 57:19.800]  even prepare myself for everything that's coming down the pipe.
[57:19.800 --> 57:23.920]  Controlled chaos, controlled breakdown of society where the public will beg for martial
[57:23.920 --> 57:24.920]  law.
[57:24.920 --> 57:31.240]  I mean, how do you even deal with the fact that they're poisoning our water supply on
[57:31.240 --> 57:32.240]  its face?
[57:32.240 --> 57:36.680]  How do you even deal with the fact of the insanity that we're living under with these
[57:36.680 --> 57:43.360]  global architects that openly brag they've set up a world system?
[57:43.360 --> 57:48.440]  How are we going to do this?
[57:48.440 --> 57:50.600]  How are we going to do this?
[57:50.600 --> 57:53.800]  How are we going to deal with this?
[57:53.800 --> 57:57.360]  I mean, people say, solutions, solutions, I'm here pointing out who's taking over, I'm
[57:57.360 --> 58:01.760]  here pointing out who the bad guys are, I say take over your local governments.
[58:01.760 --> 58:05.320]  Local governments, the key to say no to all this federalization, which is controlled internationally,
[58:05.320 --> 58:10.160]  which is really internationalization, globalization, foreigners having control, foreign and elected
[58:10.160 --> 58:16.840]  boards having control, identifying the enemy, expose them, get self-sufficient, create communities.
[58:16.840 --> 58:24.160]  But I don't get up here and give you simple silver bullet made up garbage, pie in the
[58:24.160 --> 58:25.460]  sky.
[58:25.460 --> 58:29.400]  It's enough to even properly track everything the enemy's doing, and it tricks me out because
[58:29.400 --> 58:33.680]  most of the other patriots shows and websites don't even fully get what's going on.
[58:33.680 --> 58:35.160]  I mean, this is so simple.
[58:35.160 --> 58:37.800]  It's an enemy battle plan, our own movement.
[58:37.800 --> 58:40.440]  Most people can't even understand it.
[58:40.440 --> 58:47.560]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[58:47.560 --> 58:53.160]  On surveillance, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and
[58:53.160 --> 58:56.480]  we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[58:56.480 --> 59:01.760]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[59:01.760 --> 59:03.680]  to tell their story.
[59:03.680 --> 59:12.320]  And EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[59:12.320 --> 59:17.080]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[59:17.080 --> 59:19.360]  take action against their global masters.
[59:19.360 --> 59:22.360]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[59:22.360 --> 59:28.320]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom.
[59:28.320 --> 59:35.280]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and
[59:35.280 --> 59:40.400]  aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:40.400 --> 59:44.080]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[59:44.080 --> 59:49.600]  and bring in martial law.
[59:49.600 --> 1:00:01.400]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:06.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:07.160]  You want answers?
[1:00:07.160 --> 1:00:09.320]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:09.320 --> 1:00:13.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:22.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:29.520]  We have Alan Watt joining us in P-minus 60 minutes.
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:33.920]  We have Russia today scheduled to be here in the third and fourth hour, international
[1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:36.520]  Russian television on almost every country in the world.
[1:00:36.520 --> 1:00:40.480]  Going to be here interviewing me and videotaping the live show.
[1:00:40.480 --> 1:00:45.080]  And we have a lot of other news and information we're going to be covering for the next 60
[1:00:45.080 --> 1:00:46.080]  minutes.
[1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:54.600]  We're joined by environmental scientist, climate expert.
[1:00:54.600 --> 1:01:03.360]  His, Dr. Michael Kaufman, his Ph.D., is in Forestry and Ecosystem Ecology.
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:06.640]  He is a documentary filmmaker and author and his own writer who's instrumental in stopping
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:12.240]  some of the big biological diversity takeover programs in the mid-'90s in Congress.
[1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:16.080]  He put together off UN documents the maps of areas that will be inaccessible to humans,
[1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:21.240]  the control grids, the roads being used with the corridors to wall-off populations.
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:27.080]  He is in in-game one, the extras and in-game 1.5 of prison-planet.tv members, hour-and-a-half
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:31.960]  extra, with all the documents about how they plan to create a football-watching, drug-doubt
[1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:37.760]  zombie population by the year 2000, this is official government program.
[1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:41.880]  And he talked about how off the Club of Rome documents how they wanted 10 regions with
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:48.800]  the three mega-controlling empires over the seven subregions, the North American Union,
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:55.280]  Asian Union, European Union, the African Union, Mediterranean Union, Caribbean Union, Central
[1:01:55.280 --> 1:02:02.280]  South American Union, subgroups under it, they've now officially set up the Asian Union
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:03.280]  out of APEC.
[1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:09.040]  They've now set up the African Union, they've set up the European Union, Ireland saying no
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:14.680]  to entering it, but they're demanding another vote on it, the Lisbon Treaty.
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:17.800]  They've now set up the Mediterranean Union, it's all unfolding right now.
[1:02:17.800 --> 1:02:22.680]  And so I wanted to bring him on to talk about how we're only going after the documents here.
[1:02:22.680 --> 1:02:26.800]  People can't believe we're right about everything, and they've now proposed this last week a trilateral
[1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:30.760]  world government run by the banks where you buy carbon taxes from them, cap and trade
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:35.440]  taxes, Tobin taxes, it's all in the bank or takeover bill in the US, same thing in Europe,
[1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:36.440]  it's happening.
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:43.520]  We're going to break here in a moment, this is a short segment, and Dr. Michael Kaufman,
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:46.640]  it's one thing for us to intellectually have the documents and know it and have people
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:50.920]  in denial, but it's another thing to really see through world government.
[1:02:50.920 --> 1:02:54.920]  They've been building the architecture for a long time by stealth, but to really see
[1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:59.880]  it emerge publicly and to still have denial, is that blowing you away, doctor?
[1:02:59.880 --> 1:03:00.880]  It really is.
[1:03:00.880 --> 1:03:06.920]  I cannot believe how much they have been able to really snow the American people, not only
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:13.120]  the American people, but the people of the world about what they're doing, and Obama,
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:18.200]  in my opinion, is the master at sidetracking your attention away from exactly what he is
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:22.000]  and who he represents and what he's going to do, and it's something that you might
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.320]  agree with, and these people are the same way.
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:30.800]  These international financiers and so forth have got it down to a science as to how to
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:35.440]  say they're doing one thing when in fact they're actually doing something totally different,
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:40.120]  and the average American, the average world citizen totally believes them, absolutely
[1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:45.120]  believes them.
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:50.200]  We're seeing it all unfold right now, doctor, when we get back, let's break down the world
[1:03:50.200 --> 1:03:54.000]  government structure from their own documents, and now that we see them getting to the point
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.640]  of trying to set up a world government oven by the bankers, where we pay taxes directly
[1:03:57.640 --> 1:04:05.720]  to them, what that larger expansion, the next phase, will look like, and also Barack Obama
[1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:10.600]  and John McCain backing the global carbon tax listing, carbon dioxide as a deadly poison
[1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:16.160]  toxic waste, how that will affect our lives, as you warned over a decade ago from their
[1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:20.160]  own documents, the New York Times is now reporting attacks on breathing.
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:24.760]  School kids come home, five, six, seven-year-olds and rebuke their parents for big cars or taking
[1:04:24.760 --> 1:04:30.000]  a bath at night, that was in the New York Times two weeks ago, the climate cop kids
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:35.240]  reporting on people, keeping dossiers on their parents, you can't make this type of stuff
[1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:36.240]  up.
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:39.920]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, and he's one of the key contributors to end game blueprint for global
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:40.920]  enslavement.
[1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:48.440]  He is our guest for the next 55 minutes after this quick break, so we're going to break
[1:04:48.440 --> 1:04:51.880]  down who these new world order people are, their basic structure they're setting up,
[1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:57.760]  how far along we're on the road to world government stay with us.
[1:04:57.760 --> 1:04:59.760]  SurvivalProperty.com.
[1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:04.160]  Long time survivalist author Ragnar Benson wrote, a survival retreat is a place you go
[1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:05.960]  to live, not die.
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:10.080]  It is a place out of the mainstream of events that contains the means to survive without
[1:05:10.080 --> 1:05:11.320]  outside support.
[1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:17.200]  A place where you find shelter, protection, food, water, medicine and warmth you prepared
[1:05:17.200 --> 1:05:18.400]  for yourself.
[1:05:18.400 --> 1:05:22.840]  It is defensible and is put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers
[1:05:22.840 --> 1:05:23.840]  will be.
[1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:26.920]  Ragnar Benson also said, why retreat?
[1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:31.400]  This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer.
[1:05:31.400 --> 1:05:36.120]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:37.200]  are now.
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:41.520]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat, something completely impossible
[1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:43.800]  for the average American to do.
[1:05:43.800 --> 1:05:45.680]  Act now before it's too late.

[1:05:55.780 --> 1:06:02.100]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:06:02.100 --> 1:06:03.600]  against this country.
[1:06:03.600 --> 1:06:05.800]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:07.800]  But who is the enemy?
[1:06:07.800 --> 1:06:08.800]  bin Laden.
[1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:09.800]  This is his M.O.
[1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:10.800]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:12.800]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:17.600]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:20.200]  networks inside the United States.
[1:06:20.200 --> 1:06:24.080]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[1:06:24.080 --> 1:06:26.800]  spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:26.800 --> 1:06:30.400]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:35.960]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:39.760]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and
[1:06:39.760 --> 1:06:41.120]  much, much more.
[1:06:41.120 --> 1:06:42.120]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:06:49.080 --> 1:06:56.760]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:06:56.760 --> 1:07:01.640]  Led from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings, vaccines, arsenic
[1:07:01.640 --> 1:07:06.480]  in the water, these heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:10.440]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[1:07:10.440 --> 1:07:14.360]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure,
[1:07:14.360 --> 1:07:18.560]  including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders,
[1:07:18.560 --> 1:07:22.040]  neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[1:07:22.040 --> 1:07:26.200]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and
[1:07:26.200 --> 1:07:28.200]  potentially deadly toxins.
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:30.640]  That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple Creek.
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:34.920]  PuraClear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients, including a cilantro extract
[1:07:34.920 --> 1:07:40.160]  and alphalipoic acid, among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:45.280]  PuraClear also has ingredients selected to promote improved circulation to enhance activity,
[1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:49.080]  so that heavy metals may be more effectively captured and removed from the body.
[1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:56.920]  Order PuraClear now by calling Ripple Creek at 203-331-0363 or go to RippleCreek.com.
[1:07:56.920 --> 1:08:02.840]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[1:08:02.840 --> 1:08:04.840]  a war on for your mind.
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:09.840]  All right, Dr. Michael Hoffman, you've got the floor.
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:14.440]  I know a lot of listeners understand big pieces of this, many of them understand it all, but
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:18.880]  let's break down the basics of what's being set up and the point we're now getting to,
[1:08:18.880 --> 1:08:23.800]  this key point where the trilateral world government run by the banks, taxes paid directly
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:25.440]  to them, is now emerging.
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:31.200]  Well, it's one of those issues that you have to go back probably 30 to 40 years to see the
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:35.480]  first elements of what they were trying to do in putting this whole thing together.
[1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:39.520]  In fact, you can go back to the creation of the IMF and the World Bank and all the rest,
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:40.520]  and that was the first step.
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:46.400]  But now with this current crisis, which I believe strongly that was created deliberately
[1:08:46.400 --> 1:08:51.600]  so that they can knew this next step, is to consolidate all this into one particular unit.
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:56.520]  But let's go back into the 1990s with Secretary General Kofi Annan.
[1:08:56.520 --> 1:09:02.280]  Kofi Annan basically created what he calls the track two documents of basically making
[1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:07.960]  the United Nations the world headquarters or the world government for the world.
[1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:12.600]  Now they eventually wound up calling it global governance rather than world government, but
[1:09:12.600 --> 1:09:17.200]  you can't have global governance without a government.
[1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:22.640]  So it's a matter of semantics as to what they're actually trying to snow you with, and by saying
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:25.320]  that this is really not a world government.
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:30.720]  And in those track two documents, you find a process by which they will be consolidating
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:36.560]  all their power into the United Nations, both financially, socially, and so forth, using
[1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:44.240]  a series of international treaties to lay out the legal structure for them to take control.
[1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:48.040]  The Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on
[1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:55.040]  Desertification, you name it, the treaty on the rights of child, children, and so forth.
[1:09:55.040 --> 1:10:01.120]  All of those are designed basically to provide an interlocking network of legal mechanisms
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:05.240]  by which the United Nations will control the world.
[1:10:05.240 --> 1:10:11.680]  That was in the 1990s, entered in the year 2000s, late in the 1990s, they came up with
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:19.320]  a document that was talking about restructuring the financial structure of the world.
[1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:30.520]  And in that, in 2002, in the Monterey, Mexico meeting conference on economics and development,
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:37.320]  what they did is lay down a series of goals, which we are very far along now, of creating
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:43.600]  a financial structure, headquartered, and run basically out of the United Nations with
[1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:48.240]  the global banks basically controlling what is happening in the United Nations.
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:52.240]  They're always going to be the invisible portion of what we're seeing.
[1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:56.440]  You have to realize that these bankers and so forth are not going to be visible to the
[1:10:56.440 --> 1:10:58.640]  average world citizen.
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:02.400]  The visibility is going to be at the United Nations, at least the way they have it designed
[1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:03.400]  right now.
[1:11:03.400 --> 1:11:08.640]  They're going to be controlling the United Nations and what happened and be out of the
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:15.120]  basal operations of the Bank of International Settlements, yes.
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:20.520]  Everything, they came out of this 2002 meeting in Monterey, Mexico, basically ascribed all
[1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:27.400]  control out of the Bank of International Settlements, which is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland.
[1:11:27.400 --> 1:11:31.960]  That is going to, they're going to be able to control the economies of every nation in
[1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:33.120]  the world.
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:38.200]  They're consolidating the number of currencies down to two, possibly three currencies on
[1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:42.240]  their way to a total global currency.
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:47.000]  They're dividing the world up into these economic units or economic regions.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:50.360]  They're well along on that, he talked about before the break.
[1:11:50.360 --> 1:11:52.480]  All of these things came out of that Monterey meeting.
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:57.160]  And it's all been done under the term harmonization through treaties.
[1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:03.720]  It looks like a local currency, looks like a local ID, but it's already globally standardized.
[1:12:03.720 --> 1:12:05.120]  That's correct.
[1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:12.120]  And the same thing with our security, the SPP, the Security and Prosperity Program.
[1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:17.000]  That particular issue, the United States, even though they have said that the SPP is
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:21.200]  dead because there's been too much exposure, they can get enough on it, they just donated
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:28.760]  $8 billion to secure Mexico-Southern border, which is one of the key phases of this plan
[1:12:28.760 --> 1:12:32.040]  to create the North American Union.
[1:12:32.040 --> 1:12:33.120]  It's still ongoing.
[1:12:33.120 --> 1:12:35.120]  They say one thing and do another.
[1:12:35.120 --> 1:12:36.120]  It's one of those issues where you can do anything.
[1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:42.920]  They just came out with North American ID cards for Americans if you want to go get one.
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:47.680]  It's not a passport, it's to travel in North America, Mexico, Canada, the U.S.
[1:12:47.680 --> 1:12:48.840]  Right.
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:54.200]  All of these things are done, as you just said, to harmonize our regulatory legal structure
[1:12:54.200 --> 1:12:57.160]  so that they're pretty transparent from the three nations.
[1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:04.720]  And of course, that's nested within the free trade zones of the Americas and the emerging
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:05.720]  North Atlantic.
[1:13:05.720 --> 1:13:13.560]  I can't remember what the exact name is, but the North Atlantic Union or whatever you
[1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:14.560]  want to call it.
[1:13:14.560 --> 1:13:15.560]  I can't remember the exact name.
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:20.000]  They announced that last year, early last year, that's actually in in-game where they
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.960]  announced they're already merging Canada, the United States, Mexico, the European Union
[1:13:23.960 --> 1:13:25.360]  for agreements.
[1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:29.120]  They have banking agreements, they have military agreements, they have trade agreements, they
[1:13:29.120 --> 1:13:31.840]  have social agreements, they have environmental agreements.
[1:13:31.840 --> 1:13:35.640]  They all integrate in to set up this world government.
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:36.640]  That's right.
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:40.560]  And it's all being harmonized by the central banks of the world.
[1:13:40.560 --> 1:13:43.760]  And I think what you're going to see coming out over the next couple of months is having
[1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:48.200]  a global or world central bank, not the world bank, as we have understood it for the last
[1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:49.200]  year.
[1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:50.200]  Yeah, they're now proposing that.
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:51.200]  Right.
[1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:52.200]  And it's probably going to come out.
[1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:57.600]  And that was right in the heart of this 2002 meeting in Monterey, Mexico.
[1:13:57.600 --> 1:14:02.760]  This is one of the things that they said in this restructuring of financial structure
[1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:08.000]  of the world is that the IMF is likely to become a retapped and reformulated into the
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:13.720]  central world bank, just like the US Federal Reserve is for the United States.
[1:14:13.720 --> 1:14:20.360]  And so what we're seeing here is a rapid consolidation of this agenda that's been precipitated
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:24.480]  by this economic collapse that you and I and many others out there that are knowledgeable
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:27.000]  about this have been predicting that's going to happen for over 10 years.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.240]  I mean, this is nothing new to us.
[1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:32.000]  It's been predicted it's going to happen for a long, long time.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  Well, SPP said in 2005 when they set up the North American Union by stealth that they would
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.520]  use economic crises, environmental crises, terror crises as a pretext to get the public
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:44.960]  to accept this.
[1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:45.960]  That's correct.
[1:14:45.960 --> 1:14:46.960]  And of course they are.
[1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:47.960]  They're Biden, Clinton, and Saker.
[1:14:47.960 --> 1:14:53.040]  In fact, they're liable to be voting in the very people that created the crisis or the
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:58.080]  crisis in the first place in our November 4th elections.
[1:14:58.080 --> 1:14:59.240]  It's literally astonishing to me.
[1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:06.160]  I never thought I would see the day when we would be so indoctrinated and so dazed by
[1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.080]  what the mainstream media is doing that they have turned right into wrong and wrong into
[1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:12.080]  right.
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:16.600]  I'm sure the good news is 90 plus percent of the American people, 1,000 to one phone
[1:15:16.600 --> 1:15:21.360]  calls, were against the banker takeover bill, but the system did it anyways.
[1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:27.880]  The problem is the public isn't aware of the full magnitude of what's actually happening.
[1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:33.920]  I mean, the banks that engineered this are now cutting off capital to all the other free
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:39.160]  market systems, corporations, Main Street, while amassing all the currency and wealth
[1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:43.360]  to themselves as they depress the real economy so they can consolidate it, which was in all
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:48.360]  their Club of Rome, CFR, Trilateral Commission documents in the 70s.
[1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:49.760]  Absolutely.
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:54.800]  You go back into the Club of Rome documents in the 1970s, and some of the CFR, even the
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:16:00.760]  Foreign Affairs publication, which is public information, they all elude to exactly what's
[1:16:00.760 --> 1:16:01.760]  happening today.
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:06.400]  I mean, what they said in the 1970s, they wanted to do is literally coming true right
[1:16:06.400 --> 1:16:12.360]  before our eyes today, and very few people understand that.
[1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:17.240]  Even people in our own awakening, movement, whatever you want to call it, don't understand.
[1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:18.240]  It's here.
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:19.240]  It's now happening.
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:24.600]  Just last week, it was in Canadian papers that Canada is merging its laws and harmonizing
[1:16:24.600 --> 1:16:25.600]  with the EU.
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:27.400]  I mean, there it is right there.
[1:16:27.400 --> 1:16:28.400]  There it is.
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:33.240]  And you know, it's very, very interesting that the very same people that thought that
[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:37.840]  when, like the John Birch Society, I'm not knocking the John Birch Society, but they thought
[1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:41.960]  that when they made their final move, which is happening right now before our eyes, people
[1:16:41.960 --> 1:16:43.720]  would wake up and see it.
[1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:48.040]  And I've always suspected that the way they would do it would be such a, creating such
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:52.520]  a shock to the American people that the American people would be blinded by what's happening.
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:56.680]  And that's, of course, exactly what's happening.
[1:16:56.680 --> 1:17:01.400]  If we had truly had an economic collapse where we went back to the Great Depression days,
[1:17:01.400 --> 1:17:05.480]  I think the American people would be more astute than they are right now because they've had
[1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:07.200]  a control collapse.
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:14.080]  We've seen a control collapse so that the average person who's out there really wants
[1:17:14.080 --> 1:17:18.160]  to see the fact that we will not go into a total collapse, so they're willing to support
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:22.560]  anything basically that the government does except, as you said, they did not want this
[1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:23.560]  bailout package.
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:29.080]  And I'll have to take my hat off to them, but they should be throwing all those Democrats
[1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:31.520]  out of office that voted for that, and they're not going to do it.
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:32.520]  They're going to vote more Democrats.
[1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:33.520]  Absolutely.
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:35.440]  And they think they're getting changed with Barack Obama.
[1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:36.440]  Oh, they're getting changed already.
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:40.600]  I mean, this guy is Madison Avenue, Wall Street, all the way, and he says he's going
[1:17:40.600 --> 1:17:44.040]  to name carbon dioxide as a deadly pollutant.
[1:17:44.040 --> 1:17:45.560]  Explain what that means, Dr.
[1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:52.680]  Well, basically, the polar bear, for instance, was just listed as an endangered, not an endangered,
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:55.560]  but a threatened species in June of this past year.
[1:17:55.560 --> 1:18:00.960]  Now what that means is that the environmental groups and a whole flurry of government agencies
[1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:06.640]  could now start to take action to protect the polar bears from melting ice caps, which
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:13.080]  means then controlling carbon dioxide, because carbon dioxide has been declared a pollutant,
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:14.440]  a toxic pollutant.
[1:18:14.440 --> 1:18:17.560]  Well, it's totally ridiculous.
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:22.600]  First of all, there is no scientific, absolutely no scientific supporting evidence that the
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:26.520]  polar bear isn't even threatened, let alone endangered.
[1:18:26.520 --> 1:18:30.160]  It is basically increased in populations since the 1970s.
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:34.120]  You have higher populations in all the segments of the polar bear populations.
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:38.320]  We know the polar bears can swim hundreds of miles without drowning in spite of what
[1:18:38.320 --> 1:18:41.200]  you hear on the CBS Evening News.
[1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:42.600]  They are not being threatened.
[1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:47.760]  In fact, the reason they have probably been increasing in numbers is because of the decreasing
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:52.880]  polar ice cap, there's more food out there for them now because it's not covered with
[1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:53.880]  ice.
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:19:00.680]  And as a consequence, they have passed this law basically by declaring them an endangered
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:06.040]  or threatened species, which allows the government then to start controlling carbon dioxide to
[1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:11.480]  protect that polar bear from going extinct, when in fact it's all bogus right from the
[1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:13.200]  very start.
[1:19:13.200 --> 1:19:18.520]  And once that happens, when you start to seek the, and you mentioned it very early in the
[1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:24.080]  program, you know, I mean, I really, when I was talking in the 1990s, I was, this was
[1:19:24.080 --> 1:19:25.080]  really funny thing.
[1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:29.760]  I would just talk about the fact that eventually they're going to regulate our breathing.
[1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:35.840]  And you said that before the ad, that they now have worked in the Congress to actually
[1:19:35.840 --> 1:19:36.840]  regulate breathing.
[1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:42.360]  Well, the New York Times had a headline like a year ago, attacks on breathing, and we're
[1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:43.360]  not joking.
[1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:48.040]  Sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen, that's the four main basic ingredients for
[1:19:48.040 --> 1:19:55.280]  life on terra firma, this planet, orbiting the sun, and it means total control.
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:20:02.640]  Stay with us, doctor.
[1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:09.160]  What will you do when it happens, when you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation
[1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:16.840]  and fear or confidence because you knew what was coming and got prepared with patriotfood.com?
[1:20:16.840 --> 1:20:18.760]  The signs are everywhere.
[1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:20.800]  You have no excuses.
[1:20:20.800 --> 1:20:25.800]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:31.560]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:39.360]  Patriotfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound, at patriotfood.com

[1:20:57.080 --> 1:21:03.000]  Give newcomer from Midas Resources October 20th, 2008, gold opened this morning at $794.20.
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:09.440]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $818.24, $409.12 for half ounce and $204.56 for quarter
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:10.440]  ounce.

[1:21:14.440 --> 1:21:21.240]  On June 4th, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, executive order 11,110 was signed
[1:21:21.240 --> 1:21:25.440]  with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United
[1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:27.040]  States government in interest.
[1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:30.160]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:34.400]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency, however the executive
[1:21:34.400 --> 1:21:36.800]  order still stands unrepealed.
[1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:43.800]  Midas has the Kennedy v. Fed document, call 800-686-2237, unlike your liberty, the paper
[1:21:43.800 --> 1:21:44.800]  is free.

[1:21:57.320 --> 1:22:01.800]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in Internet history comes
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:08.040]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:10.520]  destroys the official fable forever.
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:14.800]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:19.600]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:21.520]  crime are brought to justice.
[1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:25.040]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:29.480]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:32.800]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:38.320]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:42.240]  While you're visiting the online video store, be sure to check out the huge discounts on
[1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:47.320]  films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslaviment, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds
[1:22:47.320 --> 1:22:48.320]  of other titles.
[1:22:48.320 --> 1:22:51.280]  We're in a no-olds bar information war.
[1:22:51.280 --> 1:22:55.680]  This is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back
[1:22:55.680 --> 1:22:57.720]  to Big Brother.
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:01.000]  Would you walk around with your credit card number displayed on your back for anyone to
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  read?
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  Of course not.
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.760]  But if you have one of the 50 million new contactless credit and debit cards in circulation
[1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:09.400]  in your wallet, that's exactly what you're doing.
[1:23:09.400 --> 1:23:13.520]  I'm Wal Augustino, its founder of Identity Stronghold, and we think this is information
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:14.920]  you need to know.
[1:23:14.920 --> 1:23:18.400]  You may not even realize you already have one of these cards because they look physically
[1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:20.080]  just like the old card.
[1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:24.280]  The difference is an RFID chip hidden inside the card that makes radio communication with
[1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:29.040]  the card possible right through your wallet, purse, or pants pocket without you ever removing
[1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:30.040]  the card.
[1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:33.320]  Pickpockets no longer even have to touch you to get your information.
[1:23:33.320 --> 1:23:37.520]  Our company realizes the privacy danger this represents, and that's why we manufacture
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:38.520]  the SecureSleeve.
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:43.040]  The SecureSleeve is a patent pending card sleeve that contains a radio frequency barrier,
[1:23:43.040 --> 1:23:45.360]  preventing radio signals from reaching your card.
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:50.360]  You can get more information and purchase the SecureSleeve online at idstronghold.com.
[1:23:50.360 --> 1:24:16.360]  Or call us at 800-610-2770.
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:34.840]  You can go over it in a general way and then go back through to Tells if you want.
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:37.120]  We covered a lot in in-game 1.5 that's up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:39.920]  You can go through all the documents there.
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:41.760]  What life will be like under these people?
[1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:48.520]  A, who they are, what they believe, the bizarre, occultic earth worship that dominates all
[1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:49.680]  of it.
[1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:53.520]  This population reduction cult that runs it, turns out, I didn't even know this, I was
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:58.440]  doing more research on Henry Paulson, turns out he's the biggest contributor to nature
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:02.240]  conservancy involved in land grabbing, part of weird religious cults.
[1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:06.200]  There's an article called The Secret Life of Henry Paulson that was in Money Magazine,
[1:25:06.200 --> 1:25:07.200]  I'm going from memory.
[1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:09.440]  Folks can pull that up.
[1:25:09.440 --> 1:25:12.400]  Everywhere you turn a rock over, there are these occultists who always claim that they're
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:17.600]  atheist, and they believe what's in the United Nations biological diversity assessment.
[1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:22.240]  That's in my film, Road to Tyranny, where they say we need to re-enact human sacrifice.
[1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:25.440]  This is official U.N. policy, and again, that sounds nuts, folks.
[1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:26.920]  We're not the one writing it.
[1:25:26.920 --> 1:25:30.600]  We're the ones reporting it, so who these people are and what life will be like under
[1:25:30.600 --> 1:25:31.600]  them?
[1:25:31.600 --> 1:25:32.600]  Real crazy thing.
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:36.320]  In fact, that's one of the reasons they've been so successful, because people just can't
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:45.120]  believe us when we tell them that these people are true pantheists, and basically, one in
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:50.320]  the world of two-thirds of the human population, they don't care how it's really done as long
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:54.040]  as they can do it efficiently, they don't want to expose themselves too soon, or they'll
[1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:55.880]  lose the power to do it.
[1:25:55.880 --> 1:25:59.040]  But it's really basically a fundamental pantheistic religion.
[1:25:59.040 --> 1:26:00.040]  Now what is pantheism?
[1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:04.200]  Pantheism is the belief that basically, nature is God.
[1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:05.200]  There's a lot of a cat...
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:11.760]  And the load of the earth is what all government decisions must be made by, and then they set
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:18.680]  the load of the earth at a full, slow level to make humans, quote, bad as the head of
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:22.840]  the CFR, Club of Rome writer, Richard N. Haas said.
[1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:23.840]  Absolutely.
[1:26:23.840 --> 1:26:28.640]  Every law, in fact, former Vice President Gore said this in his book, Earth and the
[1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:35.280]  Balance, that every law has to be conformed to protect Mother Earth at its best state,
[1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:37.680]  which is basically without human beings.
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:41.640]  And that's why they basically say that the population of the human population of earth
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:46.000]  must be reduced to between one and two billion people.
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:51.120]  They believe that we cannot leave any kind of ecological footprint on the earth.
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:56.000]  These guys are really fanatics, but they're also very smooth, and it's hard to tell exactly
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:27:00.440]  who's being fanatical and who's just being following the leader type of thing in this,
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:01.760]  in the elite.
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:05.520]  But for instance, I'll just give you one of the examples.
[1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:09.160]  One of Governor Nelson Rockefeller's daughters, I'm trying to think of her name, I'll think
[1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:15.680]  of it hopefully before I finish with this, but she was giving a speech at one of the
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:20.560]  environmental grant makers meetings back in 1992, and I have the recordings of all the
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:23.000]  speeches given at that particular meeting.
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:24.560]  It's done in secret.
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:29.280]  They're not supposed to be able to tell anybody from the outside what is going on and so forth,
[1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:35.280]  but she literally talks about being up from the 42nd story of her New York apartment on
[1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:43.960]  Park Avenue, and she can feel Mother Earth, the vibrations of Mother Earth, assusing her
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:47.680]  psyche and so forth, and how she can contact Mother Earth.
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:49.920]  Now, this is the Rockefeller family.
[1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:55.600]  Stephen Rockefeller, her brother, is basically behind the Convention on Biological Diversity.
[1:27:55.600 --> 1:28:01.200]  All of the environmental organizations, he basically was in charge of writing the Earth
[1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:04.800]  Charter, which we stopped in Johannesburg, South Africa.
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:11.640]  It's key to add, in reality, they are hardcore people who love death and destruction and
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:18.960]  are always financing GMO destruction of something that could be irreversible, that could be
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:25.280]  irrevocable, the chimera cross species plant and animal creations that are already wreaking
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:26.360]  true havoc.
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:29.760]  The Earth can deal with volcanoes and explosions and even toxic waste.
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:32.880]  That's just bad for humans and animals, so I'm against it.
[1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:37.160]  So they're never really about environmentalism, that's what's sick, it's an anti-human blood
[1:28:37.160 --> 1:28:38.160]  lust.
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:39.160]  And it really is.
[1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:43.200]  And that's what the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on Climate Change
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:48.320]  is really designed to do, is to basically stop us dead on our tracks from any progression
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:56.200]  and to actually bring us back to a pre-Columbian culture in which man has little impact on
[1:28:56.200 --> 1:28:57.200]  planet Earth.
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:03.640]  It's an astonishing thing, when I introduced this map to the U.S. Senate floor in 1994,
[1:29:03.640 --> 1:29:08.440]  showing what the Convention on Biological Diversity was designed to do, it literally
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:11.320]  sent the U.S. Senate into shock.
[1:29:11.320 --> 1:29:15.200]  And Senator Mitchell, who was the majority leader at the time, while he's a Democrat,
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:18.920]  he's also, and I don't agree with many of these policies, but at least he's an honest
[1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:25.120]  individual, he pulled that treaty from being on the ratification right off the calendar.
[1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:27.920]  It was never voted on because it was so horrible.
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:29.880]  Thank God for you, Dr. Kaufman.
[1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:33.920]  Another example of solutions, lots of little solutions, of course not letting them totally
[1:29:33.920 --> 1:29:37.280]  take the U.S. over, that was a huge solution, but that's it.
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:42.360]  Little people doing lots of little things together, having a huge effect, that's your
[1:29:42.360 --> 1:29:43.360]  solution.
[1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:47.080]  Stay there, Dr. Kaufman, we'll be right back.
[1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:50.840]  We're on the march, the empires on the run.

[1:30:56.400 --> 1:31:02.200]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:31:02.200 --> 1:31:03.200]  against this country.
[1:31:03.200 --> 1:31:05.880]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:31:05.880 --> 1:31:07.880]  But who is the enemy?
[1:31:07.880 --> 1:31:08.880]  Bin Laden.
[1:31:08.880 --> 1:31:09.880]  This is his MO.
[1:31:09.880 --> 1:31:10.880]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:12.880]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:17.680]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[1:31:17.680 --> 1:31:20.280]  networks inside the United States.
[1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:24.160]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:26.920]  spying in and on the U.S.
[1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:30.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:31:30.560 --> 1:31:36.040]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:40.200]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much,
[1:31:40.200 --> 1:31:41.200]  much more.
[1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:42.200]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:28.120]  great research.
[1:33:28.120 --> 1:33:35.120]  We also carry a film he made, Global Warming or Global Governance.
[1:33:35.120 --> 1:33:39.080]  That's available at info-awards.com as well as in-game that he's in.
[1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:45.200]  Okay, continuing with the world I want to set up, I overuse the example because it's
[1:33:45.200 --> 1:33:47.080]  one that's close to home.
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:51.240]  It's in all the literature, and you're right, in the main line literature they say two-thirds
[1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:58.640]  to 80%, but more and more they're saying no, 90% or no, 1% of humans, only a few million
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:02.240]  left, or they talk about some of them killing everyone.
[1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:08.600]  You know, Dr. Eric Pionk, a UT biologist, two years ago made headlines giving speeches
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:13.680]  all over the world where he would project with his PowerPoint images of human skulls
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:18.800]  piled up with a red filter over it, and would say 90% need to die and die now, and I can't
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:23.240]  wait for my family and I to die, it's going to be sad, but we have to do it for the earth.
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:27.680]  He gets standing ovations according to mainstream newspapers that have been there, and by the
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:31.800]  way they always ban filming or recording, but multiple newspapers have gotten the same
[1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:38.120]  transcripts in shorthand, and everyone, I mean 95%, I mean over 95% was what one reporter
[1:34:38.120 --> 1:34:43.760]  said, standing and tears start flowing, I mean two, three minute standing ovations when
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:48.480]  they talk about death, and then I've had his graduate students who, then you Google their
[1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:54.240]  name, you see them in white lab coats at biological labs connected to weapons development, you
[1:34:54.240 --> 1:34:59.200]  know, they send you a threatening email and they're a doctorate, and saying look, you
[1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:04.160]  know, he's old fashioned, only wanting 90% dead, we believe that humans are a parasite
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:08.600]  and all must die, sorry to say it, but the animals come first in the earth, you know,
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:12.080]  we're scientific about this, and then you Google their names, and they're in white
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:17.120]  lab coats and weapon facilities, I mean, and the FBI did get concerned about this and did
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:23.840]  go and visit some of them, but it's just like 13 monkeys, I mean this is really going on,
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:28.600]  and it is religious to them, it's like a control freak orgy, what's the most control freakish
[1:35:28.600 --> 1:35:32.120]  thing you can imagine, well that's total of human extermination, doctor?
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:36.520]  Absolutely, there is no question that the environmental movement at its core is very
[1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:40.240]  nihilistic, it believes that the humans are the cause of all the problems and therefore
[1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:45.080]  the only solution is the elimination of humans, in the public documents as they say, two-thirds
[1:35:45.080 --> 1:35:49.960]  to three-quarters, 80% of the human population must go, if that were the case, now I'm not
[1:35:49.960 --> 1:35:55.920]  talking about the 95% or even 100%, but looking at their public documents now, if their public
[1:35:55.920 --> 1:35:59.920]  documents are correct, then also one of the other things that we saw the U.S. sent back
[1:35:59.920 --> 1:36:04.400]  in 1994 is that they wanted to take us back to a feudal form of government where you had
[1:36:04.400 --> 1:36:11.400]  a few ruling elite, the nobility, and the rest of the human population, about 5% or
[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:17.720]  so of that remaining 20% would be the elite, the rest of the 20% would be the sports staff
[1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:21.840]  as it were as serfs, in other words, we would be under their direct control, we would be
[1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:27.920]  totally dependent upon their whims, and so whether or not they can actually, we could
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:33.360]  survive and so forth would be totally up to them, and the laws that are coming down
[1:36:33.360 --> 1:36:37.920]  are moving us more and more in that direction, in fact, we're, as you just said, going to
[1:36:37.920 --> 1:36:43.560]  meet me in a huge adjustment with this so-called economic crisis that we're in right now,
[1:36:43.560 --> 1:36:48.160]  in order to control basically our lives through controlling our currencies, controlling our
[1:36:48.160 --> 1:36:54.480]  financial structure, controlling over who gets a job, who can actually build a plant.
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:57.880]  That's why they had to deindustrialize this so that we had no industry so we couldn't
[1:36:57.880 --> 1:37:03.640]  start over and it became a purely fiat banking system which gives them total control.
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:05.440]  It gives them total control.
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:09.360]  We've always known, and I've said on your program many times, that private property
[1:37:09.360 --> 1:37:15.360]  rights are the most important foundational structure for our freedoms.
[1:37:15.360 --> 1:37:19.400]  Now gun rights and all the rest are very, very important, they'll get me wrong.
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:22.920]  But true independence springs from being self-sufficient.
[1:37:22.920 --> 1:37:28.880]  Being self-sufficient means you have the right to go out there and plant your crops or build
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:32.320]  a widget or whatever the case might be without government interference.
[1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:36.400]  But under this, they say what type of washing machine you can have, what type of light bulbs
[1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:39.720]  you can have when you can build your house, when you can build a shed.
[1:37:39.720 --> 1:37:43.200]  As they did in Australia and England over a decade ago, they're now turning the NSA
[1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:47.960]  satellites over to local police under federal control to surveil for environmental crimes
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:48.960]  and other things.
[1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:52.160]  The whole military grid is being turned inward on us.
[1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:56.280]  Yes, and we've long, long known that was going to happen.
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:38:00.600]  The actual template for that was established by the establishment of the Adirondack Park
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:06.800]  Agency in New York, upstate New York back in 1972, basically giving the control over
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:10.960]  people's lives, their property, everything else to this park agency.
[1:38:10.960 --> 1:38:15.400]  And it has been to the people that live there an absolute disaster.
[1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:19.720]  If you drive through the Adirondacks today, you're driving back through the 1950s and
[1:38:19.720 --> 1:38:23.200]  1960s, there's no new development, there's basically nothing.
[1:38:23.200 --> 1:38:27.240]  People have had to tear their house down because it conformed with the whims of the
[1:38:27.240 --> 1:38:28.240]  agency.
[1:38:28.240 --> 1:38:31.680]  I mean, there is a microcosm of what we can expect in the future.
[1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:35.480]  And even the San Francisco Chronicle a couple years ago had a report about it.
[1:38:35.480 --> 1:38:39.680]  Memory says 9,000 acres, or it may be more, I'm going from memory.
[1:38:39.680 --> 1:38:44.040]  But I remember in the report, these were private homes, private areas, rural areas across the
[1:38:44.040 --> 1:38:50.760]  bridge from San Francisco, and the city took it over, said it would be a park, then kicked
[1:38:50.760 --> 1:38:57.280]  everybody out of it, and now city officials in the environmental heads, they own the houses,
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:00.440]  and they ride around on four-wheelers and party and do whatever they want.
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:01.440]  It's feudalism.
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:02.440]  It's feudalism.
[1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:06.880]  And that's what's happening in the Adirondack parks as well, is that the environmentalists,
[1:39:06.880 --> 1:39:10.560]  the leaders, and somebody that has a lot of money can basically do anything they want
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:15.480]  they can build anywhere they want, they can put a road across the swamp without any problems.
[1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:18.200]  They can do whatever they want, and they're not punished.
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:19.200]  Take Austin, Texas.
[1:39:19.200 --> 1:39:20.200]  The average Joe.
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:21.200]  No, sir, go ahead.
[1:39:21.200 --> 1:39:22.200]  The average Joe.
[1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:26.320]  You and I try to do anything, and we have to go through three years of permitting and
[1:39:26.320 --> 1:39:31.800]  expensive surveys and everything else just to build a small home or something of that
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:32.800]  nature.
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:35.160]  It is unbelievable, and this is where we're headed.
[1:39:35.160 --> 1:39:36.600]  They want us in the compact cities.
[1:39:36.600 --> 1:39:42.520]  I want to talk about the controlled corridors, which match the Napa Super Highway grid walling
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:49.280]  off the highway exits so people can't go into rural areas as we see up in Oklahoma and Kansas.
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:53.280]  But first off, I remember when I first really woke up to all this in the early 90s here
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:58.480]  in Austin, and then through the mid-90s, and I went to smart growth conferences, by the
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:02.520]  way, it turned out Paulson was one of the ones I went to, and was all these bank chiefs
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:05.000]  admitting it was a business, a way to take land.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:11.040]  They weren't even hiding it, and I would have radio debates in 95, 96, 97.
[1:40:11.040 --> 1:40:15.160]  Even before I was on the radio, just on access TV, I got some radio debates on local stations
[1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:18.840]  in 95, and during the break, they would say, Alex, everything's always been planned.
[1:40:18.840 --> 1:40:23.200]  The local head of SOS and others save our springs, and this is going to be a great
[1:40:23.200 --> 1:40:24.200]  new world order system.
[1:40:24.200 --> 1:40:25.200]  What are you afraid of?
[1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:30.320]  It's going to be wonderful, and they wouldn't let farmers and ranchers all around Austin
[1:40:30.320 --> 1:40:34.480]  and Travis County, mainly in Southwest Austin and the beautiful Barton Creek area.
[1:40:34.480 --> 1:40:38.080]  They would come in and harass the farmers, the ranchers say you can't build on it, but
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:41.920]  still increase their taxes, threaten them, force them to sell.
[1:40:41.920 --> 1:40:46.960]  They bought a 15,000-acre piece, a 5,000-acre piece, a 2,000-acre piece, all these giant
[1:40:46.960 --> 1:40:51.880]  pieces, and then I learned at the smart growth conference in 98 after they'd just gotten it
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:57.800]  that they were planning to allow multimillion-dollar ranchettes, little 40 and 50-acre pieces,
[1:40:57.800 --> 1:40:59.480]  to be sold to elites.
[1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:04.680]  The contracts were then given to select global corporations and builders, and they built
[1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:12.160]  five-star hotels, salons, golf courses, two, three, four, five, $10 million homes, security
[1:41:12.160 --> 1:41:13.260]  guards.
[1:41:13.260 --> 1:41:17.320]  There's weird environmental entrances and little weird environmental preserves next to
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:18.320]  it.
[1:41:18.320 --> 1:41:21.080]  They claimed the whole thing was going to be parkland.
[1:41:21.080 --> 1:41:22.680]  They're not playing games.
[1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:25.200]  This is feudalism, and they stole the land.
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:26.200]  They basically have it.
[1:41:26.200 --> 1:41:30.640]  This is happening, sweeping across the United States, the smart growth idea.
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:34.080]  It sounds so wonderful, and so forth, it's going to solve all these environmental problems.
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:35.080]  It doesn't.
[1:41:35.080 --> 1:41:37.040]  It actually creates more environmental problems.
[1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:38.040]  It creates more pollution.
[1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:40.040]  It creates all of this other stuff.
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:43.560]  Smart growth is the worst thing that your local government could ever get involved in.
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:48.240]  If you want to double, triple, quadruple your taxes, if you want to make your cost of living,
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:52.400]  just skyrocket right out through the roof and implement smart growth, because that's
[1:41:52.400 --> 1:41:53.400]  what it does.
[1:41:53.400 --> 1:41:54.880]  That's the best thing it does.
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:00.360]  The best increase is the cost of everything, and it gives the central government, usually
[1:42:00.360 --> 1:42:06.160]  the non-elected bureaucrats, absolute control over your lives.
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:07.160]  This is...
[1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:08.160]  That's right.
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:12.120]  I can't emphasize enough how important it is for you all in the listening audience to
[1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:17.360]  understand this and become active when you start to see this happening in your local area.
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:20.440]  Go to your city council meetings, or go to your county commissioner meetings, or whatever
[1:42:20.440 --> 1:42:23.240]  the case might be, and voice your concerns.
[1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:26.400]  We have information and so forth to prove what we're saying.
[1:42:26.400 --> 1:42:29.040]  This is only one small part of the scam.
[1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:34.160]  They will, whether it's toll roads or environmental control zones or any of this, cities and counties
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:42.640]  will vote to cede irrevocably power through statutes to unelected private boards.
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:47.840]  Then they come in, and the city says, well, we're just following the regulations, and
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:42:52.120]  it's incredible scams, like the city will take taxpayer money, a bond for something
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:55.000]  else, and build a 30, 40, 50-story condo.
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:59.440]  That'll then be a private bankers condo.
[1:42:59.440 --> 1:43:03.560]  They will then openly give lofts for free to the city officials.
[1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:05.560]  It's just total corruption.
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:08.680]  They will allow them to bulldoze neighborhoods, take whatever land they want.
[1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:15.960]  That was part of the kilo versus Connecticut deal in Connecticut, where they said, oh,
[1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:19.520]  if private interests are allowed to come, lobby city government to take your private
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:21.960]  property without even just compensation.
[1:43:21.960 --> 1:43:23.480]  I mean, this is feudalism.
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:28.720]  It is feudalism in its worst form, and the Supreme Court actually supported that particular
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:37.400]  lawsuit, establishing the fact that local school, it is corruption that has been unleashed,
[1:43:37.400 --> 1:43:41.840]  and what we're seeing in the media today with this election and what you're seeing within
[1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:45.960]  Congress, what you're seeing within the Obama camp, and to some extent, the McCain camp.
[1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:53.080]  I'll have to admit, even though I don't agree with many of McCain's policies, he is at least
[1:43:53.080 --> 1:43:58.280]  an honest individual, at least from my impression, but Obama, I don't know if he knows how to
[1:43:58.280 --> 1:43:59.280]  tell the truth.
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:01.960]  I just cannot believe how he's getting away with it.
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:04.720]  It's the press, the press is basically his mouth.
[1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:06.200]  Well, here's the headline today.
[1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:09.440]  Obama says he will change the world, London Telegraph.
[1:44:09.440 --> 1:44:13.440]  Barack Obama has vowed that he will change the world, even as he urged his supporters
[1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:15.640]  to guard against complacency.
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:19.600]  He says we're going to have to have this new stoic minimalism.
[1:44:19.600 --> 1:44:21.120]  We're not going to have as much money or things.
[1:44:21.120 --> 1:44:26.000]  I've heard NPR and all of them for decades, how they can't wait to make us feudal serfs.
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  It's happening.
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:31.680]  It's happening, and hopefully the American people will wake up, hopefully the John Burt
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:36.600]  Society back in the 1960s and 70s were right, and when this happens, people will start waking
[1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:38.280]  up, but I don't see it happening.
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:41.440]  In fact, I see just the opposite.
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:45.280]  Other than programs like you, you're listening to audiences probably very much aware, and
[1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:50.160]  they're doing what they can to do it, but we need to have people in the tens of millions
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:55.520]  wake up to what's going on, and even then, I'm not sure it will work, because as you
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:45:00.520]  said, 98% of the American people, at least 80% of the American people were against the
[1:45:00.520 --> 1:45:03.680]  bailout, and yet Congress voted for it anyway.
[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.000]  All right, I've been throwing out a lot of questions and comments.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.960]  We've got about 15 minutes in broadcast time left.
[1:45:10.960 --> 1:45:13.880]  Other areas you think are important to cover, Dr.?
[1:45:13.880 --> 1:45:18.400]  Well, I'm just concerned, I'm putting out another DVD for high schools right now on
[1:45:18.400 --> 1:45:23.240]  this global warming issue, because the kids are being brainwashed, but their textbooks
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:27.720]  are being brainwashed by Al Gore's inconvenient truth and so forth, and we just have to try
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:33.640]  to reach them, because our generation, Alex, and maybe down to the 20s and so forth, we
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:39.360]  may be able to convince that generation that this is a hoax, but these kids coming out
[1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:44.040]  of high school today are literally totally indoctrinated.
[1:45:44.040 --> 1:45:48.040]  Well, they're using reverse psychology, well, not even that, they're saying, your parents
[1:45:48.040 --> 1:45:51.920]  are bad, they're stupid, I've seen it in Time Magazine for kids, Newsweek for kids, they're
[1:45:51.920 --> 1:45:55.720]  telling them, your parents are bad, they're backwards, go home and enforce new environmental
[1:45:55.720 --> 1:45:59.880]  rules on them, and as I said earlier, even the New York Times reports that the kids literally
[1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:02.960]  bossed their parents around, and they show the parents saying, oh, I love it, that they're
[1:46:02.960 --> 1:46:06.640]  enforcing on me, I mean, this is classical tyranny.
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:11.400]  It is, it literally is, and you have these kids who have no framework or understanding
[1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:19.080]  whatsoever, basically saying that they are going to do this when they become adults and
[1:46:19.080 --> 1:46:23.000]  vote and so forth, and we have to reach that generation.
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:28.080]  If we have any other target that's more important is probably our educational system in the
[1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:32.920]  public schools and trying to get it to them with the truth, because right now, on the
[1:46:32.920 --> 1:46:37.640]  other hand, Alex, I made a debut of my new DVD even though it's not quite finished yet
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:42.480]  in Washington D.C. to well over 50 kids from all, high school students from all over the
[1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:49.040]  United States, and they just softed it up, they loved it, because they sensed, you know,
[1:46:49.040 --> 1:46:53.720]  these kids are not stupid, and they sense that there's something wrong with what they're
[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:54.720]  being taught.
[1:46:54.720 --> 1:47:01.080]  And when you've got the NFL and all the mainstream media and everything, and Pat Robertson and
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:05.920]  Al Sharpton together, and John McCain, the Republican saying, global warming's real,
[1:47:05.920 --> 1:47:11.760]  global tax, you know, make a CO2, a toxic waste, tax it regulated, when all of that's
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:15.680]  being illustrated, when all of that is coming out, they're starting to figure out, wait,
[1:47:15.680 --> 1:47:18.160]  the whole establishment is pushing this.
[1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:20.400]  Yes, it really is.
[1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:23.800]  It's like it's the absolute truth, and I'll tell you this right now, you know, it's been
[1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:30.760]  a while since we've done an interview on global warming, there is now almost no scientific
[1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:36.360]  evidence that man is causing global warming, almost none, in fact, I can say none, period.
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:40.480]  Well, the Arctic just got 13% bigger, the sun's cooling down.
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.200]  The sun is cooling down, and that in itself is a major thing.
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:49.040]  We had all these tornadoes last spring and so forth, it probably wasn't because, you
[1:47:49.040 --> 1:47:52.520]  know, it's hard to say what they were caused by, and I'm not going to make an absolute
[1:47:52.520 --> 1:47:53.720]  statement here.
[1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:57.480]  But generally speaking, the colder it gets, the more tornadoes and more hurricanes and
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:02.000]  violent storms you're going to have, there's good scientific reasons for that, and I explained
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:08.080]  it in my new DVD, but it's one of those things where we had all these violent tornadoes this
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:13.960]  past spring, not because it was getting warmer, but because it was getting cooler, it's much
[1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:17.880]  cooler, it's over a half a degree cooler now than it was in 2005.
[1:48:17.880 --> 1:48:22.520]  Antarctic just exploded, both the Arctic's, Antarctic and the Arctic just exploded in
[1:48:22.520 --> 1:48:23.520]  size.
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:29.880]  I know it, the Antarctic reached record sizes this year, right on the heels of 2007 when
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:32.840]  it reached a record size, because why?
[1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:39.440]  It's getting colder, much colder than it has been for a long, long time.
[1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:48.360]  And the Arctic itself, now back in early part of 2007, they were saying that the North Pole
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:55.960]  is likely to totally melt this in 2008, well not only did it not melt, but the reduction
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:01.680]  in size during the summer was much less than it was in 2007, like about 30% less than it
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:02.680]  was in 2007.
[1:49:02.680 --> 1:49:04.840]  And it always expands and contracts.
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:06.320]  It always expands and contracts.
[1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:07.320]  It always expands and contracts.
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:12.600]  Now, I'll have to admit that back in 1972, the contraction during the summer was much
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:17.920]  less than it is right now, but if it continues to go like it is right now, we have not seen
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:23.880]  an active sun for about four or five years, and it's been pretty quiet for over 10 years
[1:49:23.880 --> 1:49:24.880]  now.
[1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:29.320]  There has been no earth warming at all over the last 10 years, and now the temperature
[1:49:29.320 --> 1:49:30.320]  is plummeting.
[1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:31.320]  Why?
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:32.480]  Because the sun is no longer being active.
[1:49:32.480 --> 1:49:36.400]  Well, what a novel approach that all the climatologists on record are saying, it's
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:37.400]  the sun, it's the sun.
[1:49:37.400 --> 1:49:40.880]  It's like when I had Rothschild on the show, and I said, well, why are the polar ice caps
[1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:42.120]  of Mars getting smaller?
[1:49:42.120 --> 1:49:43.120]  Why?
[1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:45.160]  And he said, because it's closer to the sun than the earth.
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:46.160]  And I said, no, it's not.
[1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:47.280]  He just laughed at me.
[1:49:47.280 --> 1:49:54.760]  He thinks our audience is so dumb that they don't know that Saturn, Mars, Jupiter, Uranus,
[1:49:54.760 --> 1:49:56.360]  Pluto are further away.
[1:49:56.360 --> 1:49:57.360]  Absolutely.
[1:49:57.360 --> 1:49:58.360]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:00.600]  All their bears can swim.
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:02.800]  Mars is further away from the sun than the earth.
[1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:03.800]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:04.800]  It's just true, folks.
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:05.800]  I'm sorry.
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:09.400]  I mean, I can't believe that we have to argue with people about this.
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:14.360]  Final segment of Dr. Michael Kaufman straight ahead, go to infowars.com, click on the shop,

[1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:37.840]  Is a dismal growth rate or rapid inflation affecting the bottom line of your retirement
[1:50:37.840 --> 1:50:38.840]  savings accounts?
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:42.480]  Do you worry about uncontrollable economic events, which could suddenly wipe out some
[1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:44.240]  or all of your hard earned savings?
[1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:46.080]  You can turn adversity into opportunity.

[1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:57.920]  There are definitely some do's and don'ts with this rollover process, and that's where

[1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:09.960]  History has shown that metals will maintain your buying power even if other financial
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:11.480]  assets are failing.
[1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:15.480]  It's not a question of if you'll need precious metals in your portfolio, it's a question
[1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:16.480]  of when.
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:20.680]  So whether you're planning for an economic rainy day or a Category 5 hurricane, the solution

[1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:26.680]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:27.680]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:28.680]  9-11 was an inside job.
[1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:29.680]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:51:29.680 --> 1:51:30.680]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:51:30.680 --> 1:51:31.680]  How do the American people know that?
[1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:41.680]  9-11 was a state.
[1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:46.240]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.
[1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:47.240]  Park.
[1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:54.240]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[1:51:54.240 --> 1:51:56.240]  to grow at our own door.
[1:51:56.240 --> 1:52:03.240]  It's been 20 years and after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken
[1:52:03.240 --> 1:52:04.240]  place.
[1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:05.240]  An inside job?
[1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:06.240]  How dare you?
[1:52:06.240 --> 1:52:12.240]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:14.240]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:20.240]  And if the government has not told the truth, in five years we will be here on the 10th
[1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:21.240]  anniversary of 9-11.

[1:52:29.240 --> 1:52:34.240]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes
[1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:38.400]  a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right
[1:52:38.400 --> 1:52:39.400]  thing for liberty.
[1:52:39.400 --> 1:52:43.240]  Her face was every face I've ever known.
[1:52:43.240 --> 1:52:45.240]  Her face was my own face.

[1:53:57.400 --> 1:54:01.520]  One of their camera guys is going to be in the studio when we're live at prisonplanted.tv
[1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:02.520]  in five minutes.
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:08.080]  Go ahead and get Alan Watt on at about, now get him on at the five after, but I want to
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:11.920]  know that we have him, so go ahead and call him about two after, please John, and we're
[1:54:11.920 --> 1:54:16.840]  going to be talking with him and then in that next hour, I'm going to be going over financial
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:17.840]  news.
[1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:21.000]  I'm going to give you my review of the film W. They also want me to talk to them about
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:27.040]  electronic voting machines and the fraud that they're involved with because they're going
[1:54:27.040 --> 1:54:30.160]  to be playing pieces throughout the next few weeks up to election night where I'm going
[1:54:30.160 --> 1:54:33.720]  to be live on international and national Russian TV.
[1:54:33.720 --> 1:54:37.040]  I mean, Russia today is the biggest channel Russia has, period.
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:39.680]  In their country, outside their country, it's their English channel.
[1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:45.680]  Huge response when we go on there, only been on there twice, and I am really looking forward
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:54:46.680]  to this.
[1:54:46.680 --> 1:54:50.640]  Dr. Michael Coffman, in closing, you're right, just like you went to the Senate with those
[1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:54.760]  maps of the areas they wanted to take over, briefly describe that and help stop it.
[1:54:54.760 --> 1:54:58.600]  If other people just stop, suck on their thumbs and stop complaining and get informed and
[1:54:58.600 --> 1:55:02.720]  get educated and take your material, my material, the other, there's only frankly a few good
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:07.360]  places to get the real material on what's happening and get those to counties and cities.
[1:55:07.360 --> 1:55:10.520]  People then understand, everything suddenly makes sense.
[1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:11.520]  Dr. Coffman.
[1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:20.360]  Yes, it does, and if you want to get those maps, you can go to discerningtoday.org, discerningtoday.org
[1:55:20.360 --> 1:55:31.480]  E-P-I-U-S.com, and you can get 11 by 17-inch maps to show, they're the one of those effective
[1:55:31.480 --> 1:55:34.920]  tools that we have had to expose what they're trying to do.
[1:55:34.920 --> 1:55:39.800]  I mean, I know that you burn with the same desire that I do, because we've had you down
[1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:43.400]  here for Austin to make end game, but I mean, for those that don't know what it's like to
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:47.960]  be in this fight, we are driven, we are called, I mean, I burn with desire to warn people,
[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:48.960]  we're being conned.
[1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:53.600]  It's like if I saw people robbing my neighbor, you know, while he was at work carrying out
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:57.800]  his washing machines and TVs, I would freak out and go out there and try to stop him or
[1:55:57.800 --> 1:56:00.520]  I would freak out and call the police or call him at work.
[1:56:00.520 --> 1:56:03.680]  I mean, this is much bigger, this is our future, everything.
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:07.880]  They're carrying out eugenics against us, and I, I mean, can you talk about your passion?
[1:56:07.880 --> 1:56:13.280]  It is the same passion that you have in different areas, you can do a much more effective job
[1:56:13.280 --> 1:56:14.640]  across the broad front.
[1:56:14.640 --> 1:56:20.440]  I have to be really focused in on certain key environmental types of issues at the global
[1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:25.280]  level as well as the local level, but at least I can become expert on that, and we can talk
[1:56:25.280 --> 1:56:29.800]  about it on your show and actually get it out to the information, out to the American
[1:56:29.800 --> 1:56:34.240]  people that are listening, because if we don't stop this thing, we're going to be in a world
[1:56:34.240 --> 1:56:36.920]  of hurt, and it's happening fast.
[1:56:36.920 --> 1:56:41.520]  It's, I mean, we're, we've always talked about it in a few years, if we don't do something
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:45.080]  that's going to be really bad, well, folks in a few months, if we don't do something
[1:56:45.080 --> 1:56:46.680]  that's going to be really bad.
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:52.120]  And they phase it in incrementally, taxes, regulation, 3 million in viral cops, Obama's
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:57.840]  talked about that, invading your house, I mean, you mean feudalism, you mean control,
[1:56:57.840 --> 1:56:59.440]  that's what we're talking about here.
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:00.440]  That's right.
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:03.280]  And they have it written right out there that the feudalistic form of government is probably
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:06.280]  the best form of government they can have to protect the environment.
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:08.320]  This is right in the congressional record.
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:15.040]  It's also in two biological diversity assessments that we've got an end game and in road to
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:16.040]  tyranny.
[1:57:16.040 --> 1:57:18.040]  But I forget what years were those in 96 and
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:23.960]  Well, the treaty itself was defeated in 94, but we've done, we actually stopped the Earth
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:28.760]  Charter, which is the new religion, global religion from being enacted in 2002 in Johannesburg,
[1:57:28.760 --> 1:57:29.760]  South Africa.
[1:57:29.760 --> 1:57:35.480]  And we've done several specials on with you on this whole biodiversity issue.
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:39.560]  But I was talking specifically about those two biological diversity assessments, they
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:47.320]  talk about how they're going to set up governmental human sacrifice, feudalism 1995, 1995 biological
[1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:48.320]  diversity assessment.
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:57:49.320]  Yep.
[1:57:49.320 --> 1:57:50.800]  I mean, that is official UN policy.
[1:57:50.800 --> 1:57:52.480]  You can't make this up.
[1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:53.480]  It's so bizarre.
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:56.040]  Give your website out again, doctor.
[1:57:56.040 --> 1:57:57.040]  You bet.
[1:57:57.040 --> 1:57:59.680]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:02.360]  Go ahead and fire that out again for us real fast.
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:07.360]  Oh, he thought I said bye to him, Dr. Kaufman, I think he was having some fun.
[1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:12.720]  All right, we'll be right back with our next guest, Salomon.
[1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:13.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:58:13.720 --> 1:58:14.720]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:26.600]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[1:58:26.600 --> 1:58:30.320]  against this country, the enemies struck America on September 11th.
[1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:31.800]  But who is the enemy?
[1:58:31.800 --> 1:58:32.800]  bin Laden.
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:33.800]  This is his MO.
[1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:34.800]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:58:34.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:41.360]  The fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:58:41.360 --> 1:58:48.000]  to intelligence networks in our Israelis, again, in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:51.720]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:57.160]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:58:57.160 --> 1:59:00.960]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings and war games, the shadow government, and
[1:59:00.960 --> 1:59:03.400]  much, much more, fabled enemies.

[1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:32.400]  Raging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:37.160]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:59:37.160 --> 1:59:38.160]  You want answers?
[1:59:38.160 --> 1:59:40.320]  Well, so does he.
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:44.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:44.520 --> 1:59:51.520]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:51.520 --> 1:59:58.440]  Okay, Alan Watt coming up after the next break.
[1:59:58.440 --> 2:00:03.320]  Got Russia Today TV in here with me.
[2:00:03.320 --> 2:00:05.840]  They're getting set up.
[2:00:05.840 --> 2:00:09.320]  I'm going to pay some bills here with some sponsors for a moment.
[2:00:09.320 --> 2:00:15.480]  Hey, folks, Eat Foods Direct, with all the uncertainty going on in the world today, it
[2:00:15.480 --> 2:00:25.600]  really is important for folks out there to get self-sufficient, to get prepared, to take
[2:00:25.600 --> 2:00:27.840]  care of their families.
[2:00:27.840 --> 2:00:32.960]  And with the increase in food prices, with all the things that are happening, it is insane
[2:00:32.960 --> 2:00:38.640]  to not call and get a free brochure or a free audio CD about eatfooddirect.com, which is
[2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:42.080]  called StevensGrip, the long-s continually operating affordable food company in the United
[2:00:42.080 --> 2:00:50.280]  States, 1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or EatFoodsDirect.com.
[2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:54.080]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:00:54.080 --> 2:00:55.080]  800-409-5633.
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:01:00.800]  Also, I'm going to tell you about a cola blue.
[2:01:00.800 --> 2:01:04.200]  A cola blue is really neat stuff.
[2:01:04.200 --> 2:01:10.080]  A cola blue is a atmospheric water generator that grabs upwards of seven and a half gallons
[2:01:10.080 --> 2:01:16.560]  a day out of the atmosphere, and then it purifies it through five different filters.
[2:01:16.560 --> 2:01:19.760]  The water passes through an activated carbon filter, then a silver and pregnant carbon
[2:01:19.760 --> 2:01:26.120]  filter, then a reverse osmosis system, then a taste and odor removal filter, and is stored
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:30.240]  in a tank eliminated by an antibacterial fungal UV light.
[2:01:30.240 --> 2:01:34.720]  All of the machine comes in colors red, black, white, green, silver, and blue, and Russia
[2:01:34.720 --> 2:01:36.440]  today finds this very interesting.
[2:01:36.440 --> 2:01:38.160]  I'm going to give this some news for you guys just a moment.
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:46.280]  I'm doing the ads right now, 866-585-4044, really a neat system, 866-585-4044, or a
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:53.360]  colablue.com, check them out, fabulous atmospheric water generation system.
[2:01:53.360 --> 2:01:55.960]  Willie Nelson is promoting a similar system.
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:01.000]  It's getting very, very popular, and I'm excited to see that.
[2:02:01.000 --> 2:02:04.720]  Coming up today, we're going to be talking about electronic voting machines and the documented
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:09.440]  fraud that we've seen carried out by three of these major companies.
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:13.840]  Their own engineers have gone public, admitted that they've designed the machines so that
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:19.720]  they can be remote controlled, remotely accessed for fraud.
[2:02:19.720 --> 2:02:26.200]  We also have the mainstream media focusing on retail voter fraud, not election fraud.
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:30.840]  Now, voter fraud has always been a problem, dead people voting in Chicago and LBJ having
[2:02:30.840 --> 2:02:36.200]  dead people vote for him for his first congressional race, an old box 13 right here in Texas, and
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:41.200]  Acorn certainly has been involved in some skull-duggery and been caught with sports
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:46.000]  figures in Mickey Mouse being registered to vote all over the country, but that's a very
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.320]  small percentage of it.
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:52.280]  It certainly goes on, certainly is a problem, but it's nothing like the integrity of the
[2:02:52.280 --> 2:02:55.600]  system itself from the top down being controlled.
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:03:00.320]  We'll be talking about election fraud, some anti-economic news coming up in the fourth
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:01.320]  hour today.
[2:03:01.320 --> 2:03:04.680]  I was already going to cover some of that today, but that's what our friends from Russia
[2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:10.840]  today want me to cover some of, so we'll be covering that here as well on the syndicated
[2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:15.200]  broadcast going out on the MNFM dial across the United States, simulcasting on Global
[2:03:15.200 --> 2:03:21.720]  Shortwave and of course the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, not to mention on three
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:28.000]  different satellite systems, very, very happy to be on those systems as well for everybody
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.200]  out there watching.
[2:03:30.200 --> 2:03:35.280]  Some of the financial news we're going to be covering later in the broadcast, Kucinich
[2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:43.280]  calls for probe of bonuses for Wall Street aid recipients, the trillion plus dollars,
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:46.640]  it's more than 700 billion, being pumped in, it's going directly into the coffers of the
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:50.240]  bankers that have engineered it and Congressman Kucinich says he's going to be investigating
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:51.240]  that.
[2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:56.200]  I hope he doesn't have any plane crashes or anything or any automobile accidents.
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:04:00.880]  Also globalist exploit financial meltdown and move towards one world government.
[2:04:00.880 --> 2:04:03.720]  Unbelievable things are now happening as they announce a world government run for and by
[2:04:03.720 --> 2:04:07.960]  the bankers for the trilateral three region currency as they told us they would set up
[2:04:07.960 --> 2:04:12.680]  in the 70s via the club of Rome and the trilateral commission CFR statements.
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:18.080]  Unprecedented things that are happening, EU leaders again call for global currency,
[2:04:18.080 --> 2:04:22.920]  it's all coming up, we'll get Alan Watt and amazing researchers take on this and a lot
[2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:28.160]  more straight ahead, stay with us.
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:32.120]  Phase one of the insiders plan for a one world government has been initiated with the recent
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:33.120]  bailout.
[2:04:33.120 --> 2:04:37.200]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:42.040]  new currency and a new world bank to act as savior, but we've only seen the beginning.
[2:04:42.040 --> 2:04:46.560]  Your next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:50.000]  Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:54.600]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[2:04:54.600 --> 2:04:58.920]  Phase one is a one world currency which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[2:04:58.920 --> 2:05:02.920]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.

[2:05:27.920 --> 2:05:32.000]  Our beloved republic is on her knees, the forces of globalism are destroying national
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:35.960]  sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:39.600]  The first time in modern history the people are beginning to wake up, it is essential
[2:05:39.600 --> 2:05:43.720]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order
[2:05:43.720 --> 2:05:44.720]  master plan.
[2:05:44.720 --> 2:05:49.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:07:20.560 --> 2:07:46.960]  Bracks of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:07:46.960 --> 2:08:14.380]  Thank you.
[2:08:14.380 --> 2:08:20.140]  So that is coming up over the next 51 minutes. We're joined by Alan Watt cutting through the matrix Alan Watt
[2:08:20.700 --> 2:08:29.460]  First I want to get into the fact that the trilateral Commission documents the CFR statements the club of Rome statements back in the 70s and 80s of
[2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:32.020]  engineering a world financial
[2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:37.320]  Collapse that will be managed by the very inner group of private banks and the Anglo-American
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:43.800]  New World Order system so they can then pose as the saviors and bring in a world government oven by the banks where they will
[2:08:43.880 --> 2:08:48.240]  Regulate all the other banks and financial systems and government's currencies of the world
[2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:53.080]  They always said it would first after the collapse happened be a trilateral or three tier
[2:08:53.920 --> 2:09:02.480]  system a Asian Union European Union American Union with seven subregions under it with with all of those currencies pegged to the
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:09.760]  Central government in that tripolar world. They then intend to merge those three systems
[2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:16.240]  We already see this merger going on by the time they announced the trilateral plan that we'd already been in it for years and
[2:09:16.680 --> 2:09:18.840]  In my film in game. You've also covered it
[2:09:19.000 --> 2:09:25.520]  It's admitted that the North American Union of the Security and Prosperity Partnership is already being merged Bush even give speeches with
[2:09:25.520 --> 2:09:28.360]  Baroso and Merkel on the White House lawn over a year ago
[2:09:28.920 --> 2:09:31.400]  Where they admit that they are already?
[2:09:31.400 --> 2:09:35.080]  Merging the European Union and the North American
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:40.360]  Integration group they're already merging those together in front of us
[2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:42.360]  so we're being told about the
[2:09:42.800 --> 2:09:49.720]  The the the trilateralist plan for the world when we're already in that as we really move into the merger of the trilateral system
[2:09:49.720 --> 2:09:53.560]  So break down what we're currently seeing with this financial situation
[2:09:53.560 --> 2:10:03.280]  We are seeing the implementation of a plan lead long ago even before Britain Woods in World War two
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:10.480]  At the beginning of the 1900s it talked about the creation of this world system under the League of Nations
[2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:13.480]  And how they'd eventually have to bring in a World Bank
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:18.440]  People didn't go for the League of Nations too well, especially in the US and
[2:10:18.440 --> 2:10:23.760]  And so they quieted it down. They brought in World War two to bring us to her knees and
[2:10:24.440 --> 2:10:31.280]  Even then they tried to bring in the whole world global system and people still wanted to retain nationalism
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:34.080]  So they worked covertly from then on
[2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:39.600]  In fact that they bypassed any idea of democracy. There is no democracy
[2:10:40.240 --> 2:10:42.240]  they ignore the public and
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:49.280]  This is the next part of the plan is to say Maurice Strong who is a frontman for Rockefeller
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:54.640]  was instrumental in setting up this world banking system. He was ahead of it for a while and
[2:10:55.760 --> 2:10:57.760]  It will be the big big stick
[2:10:59.400 --> 2:11:01.400]  The economy plus
[2:11:02.520 --> 2:11:08.600]  Nature the world environment are going to be used to bring in a new type of world order
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:16.760]  Where it's scientifically designed run by technocrats and bureaucrats who will decide who lives who dies who will be born
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:20.880]  Who is needed who will not be needed as a whole regulated society
[2:11:21.640 --> 2:11:27.640]  That's to come out of this and it's to be a hundred years war going on right up for the whole century
[2:11:28.280 --> 2:11:32.360]  Until they bring up their new types of servants the new carefully made
[2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:35.680]  society through cloning etc. and genetics
[2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:37.480]  but a much
[2:11:37.480 --> 2:11:43.560]  Smaller population will serve this global elite who've said in their own writings that they will not alter
[2:11:44.200 --> 2:11:48.880]  Themselves mentally the brain capacity. They'll keep their abilities for self-preservation
[2:11:49.480 --> 2:11:54.840]  But the public won't need them anymore because the state will be making all the decisions for them
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:12:01.400]  That is the brave new world scenario that we're going through now and as I say it's been going on professor Carl Quigley
[2:12:01.800 --> 2:12:04.920]  Said in the 1960s in his own books the tragedy and hope
[2:12:04.920 --> 2:12:06.920]  that this
[2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:12.280]  Parallel government had run America for 60 years in his day
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:19.800]  So basically for a hundred years they've been working towards this great utopia as a utopia for the elites
[2:12:19.960 --> 2:12:23.040]  and they all openly admit that they're setting up a
[2:12:23.640 --> 2:12:28.280]  World government for and by run by the private central banks that they would use
[2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:34.760]  Environmentalism as a pretext to demonize human life and to cheapen it so the state can carry out the orderly
[2:12:35.080 --> 2:12:43.520]  Force reduction of at least 80% of the population. Yes, and also I read recently from the CFR's own website
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:49.000]  And the Royal Institute of International Affairs, which is just the British branch of it
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:55.680]  That they're now ready the public are ready. They've been conditioned and they said scientifically conditioned to accept this
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:13:02.840]  And you'll don't realize that everything they watch on television. Everything they read is nothing but propaganda to shape their minds
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:06.760]  Along a road to accept all that is coming down today
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:08.920]  they are literally
[2:13:08.920 --> 2:13:10.920]  brainwashed and controlled and
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:17.040]  Being noted at the top because they have constant surveys on the internet. They know what we're all thinking and doing and
[2:13:17.920 --> 2:13:23.280]  They can tell that the conditioning and their propaganda has worked to the maximum
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:29.600]  there's only a few people who have functioning brains anymore and an intellect that actually works in reasons and
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:34.480]  The masses unfortunately have been conquered. So
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:36.760]  That's the key problem right now
[2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:43.640]  They did say to a hundred years ago that eventually after all the wars that they would create to bring the world in
[2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:47.680]  to world governments through conflict and resolution and
[2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:49.480]  treaties
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:53.960]  That they also said that the power of the purse would be used at the end
[2:13:54.280 --> 2:14:00.880]  Because everyone is dependent on a monetary system for everything they need to live and so we're seeing that now
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:04.080]  governments in collusion with the banks is
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:12.960]  Basic fascism is classical fascism and the government now this in with the banks will be into your bank account
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:19.440]  Setting what you can withdraw what you can buy of what you can eat and so on and so on all for environmental and
[2:14:20.200 --> 2:14:26.960]  It's a pincer attack anti-terrorism as Richard and Haas in 1991 in the club of Rome documents said they would use phony
[2:14:27.280 --> 2:14:32.200]  environmentalism to create neofutilism and serfdom to control and regulate the public and then
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:36.120]  Collectivize the wealth for the control of the banks and the global elite above the nation state
[2:14:36.120 --> 2:14:39.600]  Then the other side of the pincer attack is the threat of terrorism
[2:14:39.600 --> 2:14:45.760]  That they have to take our liberties and freedoms and surveil us to keep us safe from these boogeymen that they create and that they
[2:14:45.920 --> 2:14:50.960]  Promote Alan. I want you to specifically talk about the human mind and TV and cognitive dissonance and brainwashing
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:56.680]  For decades. We told people they would set up a world financial crisis. They would get the population into debt
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:14:58.040]  They would then restrict liquidity
[2:14:58.040 --> 2:15:01.840]  They would then have a quote bailout that would give the central banks even more power
[2:15:01.840 --> 2:15:03.960]  They would openly set up a world banking
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:09.520]  Government that regulated all the currencies of the world in a trilateral system in the last two weeks
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:15.880]  We've seen it all announced in detail global government new world order. I went and saw the film double you last night
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:19.400]  They admitted it's about a new world order, you know through Oliver Stone
[2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:21.600]  They're just throwing it all in our face
[2:15:21.760 --> 2:15:30.680]  But still my message board on info wars calm the comments on the pages are saying when I post AFP and Bloomberg and Reuters all admitting this
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:35.640]  They say no, you're a liar. None of it's happening. Those aren't real links now
[2:15:35.640 --> 2:15:36.920]  I know a lot of those are government agents
[2:15:36.920 --> 2:15:42.960]  But some of them aren't they are people so wedded to the delusion and the old lie that none of this existed while they were
[2:15:42.960 --> 2:15:49.280]  Building it that now that they're unveiling it the public is still denying it. Can you speak to that psychological system?
[2:15:49.360 --> 2:15:51.360]  That's right. You see most people never
[2:15:51.960 --> 2:15:58.720]  Live in a state of consciousness and awareness. They live in a world of fantasy
[2:15:58.720 --> 2:16:05.720]  Surrounded by their ego centonic behavior of what they like to do what's gonna be pleasing exactly their ego tells them
[2:16:05.720 --> 2:16:11.080]  They don't like being slaves so they can be in bondage sitting in a pile of their own crap in a concentration camp
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:14.720]  And they're gonna say they're not in a camp because they don't want to admit they've been enslaved
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:20.040]  Yes, and I'm sure you've heard the same thing too with the futurists and all those guys
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:26.480]  Who are all for this genetic engineering and creating new types a small type of of selected people
[2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:31.920]  They truly believe they all have what will be chosen to come through this because they're superior in other words
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:39.440]  They're calling themselves clone worthy. That's that's a term they're using now and it's so amazing to me how they've used the new age again through a
[2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:40.720]  massive
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:46.600]  Builds up a creation of a religion is no big deal if you have big powerful wealthy
[2:16:47.480 --> 2:16:53.480]  Foundations backing you you can turn up thousands of books to promote what's called the new age and they will openly
[2:16:53.480 --> 2:17:01.240]  Announce that they're a cultist that they're into the office and in Lucifer, but then they'll tell you if you criticize it
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:05.400]  Oh, you're just a religionist you have a closed mind, and I'm saying no
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:07.200]  I'm secularly
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:13.600]  Analyzing what you're saying and doing and they just use double-think and say no it doesn't exist as they announce it themselves
[2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:17.720]  as they know to themselves they all belong to the the various
[2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:21.720]  societies with secrets as they call it themselves and
[2:17:21.720 --> 2:17:29.920]  They all swear oaths to obey this great plan to the to the great work and work towards it diligently
[2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:36.200]  And it's to be done covertly because everyone else they call the profane it goes in the world of darkness
[2:17:37.080 --> 2:17:43.480]  Non-understanding are called the profane now that ties in with the war on terror because if you read the American
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:44.960]  psychiatric
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:51.480]  Books the association's books on the population and American journals of psychology
[2:17:51.560 --> 2:17:53.400]  You'll find many many
[2:17:53.400 --> 2:17:58.040]  Professors in there talking about the world and the population and it being technically insane
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:05.200]  So they are therefore the terrorists and they say the family is insane and must also be broken down
[2:18:05.200 --> 2:18:09.520]  And that people shouldn't breed or people shouldn't have children. It's a culture of death
[2:18:09.520 --> 2:18:16.720]  It's really the most ancient form of total war is to conquer a people through siege and then not let them appropriate
[2:18:17.240 --> 2:18:23.760]  That's exactly right and we find it. It's a blend of what we thought is the communist system the Soviet system
[2:18:24.600 --> 2:18:26.400]  with capitalism
[2:18:26.400 --> 2:18:32.520]  They're coming together as it was designed to do after 70 odd years Lenin talked about this and
[2:18:32.520 --> 2:18:40.160]  And and sure enough the club of Rome announced that they looted all the different systems in the world and the one that they
[2:18:40.600 --> 2:18:43.520]  Promoted most or thought was the best kind to rule the people
[2:18:43.840 --> 2:18:50.160]  Was collectivism which is basically the Soviet times system and that was coming in. That's why the big
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:56.120]  Services like childcare are now authorities. Everything is an authority over the public
[2:18:56.120 --> 2:19:03.220]  That's right or the prison guards to boil it down the schools or prisons to induct your children into official prison
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:08.600]  Or to get them on welfare or to give them a psychiatric designation so they have no liberties or freedoms
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:10.880]  It's all about enslaving the population
[2:19:10.880 --> 2:19:15.880]  We're gonna skip this break for the online listeners at info wars comm and prison planet dot TV viewers
[2:19:16.120 --> 2:19:22.360]  Everybody else will be back in four minutes. It's gonna be a victim of page on I'm gonna continue with discussions Alan
[2:19:22.360 --> 2:19:26.180]  I mean, this is so hellish and then I see so many mainline liberals
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:32.080]  You know that the right wing is all for police state and total tyranny and surveillance to keep them safe from you know
[2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:36.160]  The the the evil Arabs or the evil Muslims. They're being sold on that
[2:19:36.160 --> 2:19:40.680]  But the more sophisticated paradigm is the left. They'll say yes, we're against the right wing world government
[2:19:40.680 --> 2:19:43.360]  But we're for the loving you in utopia
[2:19:44.360 --> 2:19:49.160]  System of not having to work and milk and honey and the withering away of the state and we see the big banks
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:54.080]  Funding that and then the left says what do you mean big banks fund us? No, we want to shut down the big banks
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:19:56.680]  Can you explain the brainwashing there? Please Alan what?
[2:19:57.760 --> 2:20:00.960]  It's the dialectic the dialectical procedure
[2:20:01.800 --> 2:20:04.720]  Has been understood since the days even before Plato
[2:20:05.640 --> 2:20:07.640]  Existed but it's a technique of
[2:20:08.360 --> 2:20:13.040]  Using always you see to change society in any direction. You must have a conflict
[2:20:13.040 --> 2:20:19.960]  So you must create another you must create one group which comes up with proposals to change society that will automatically
[2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:23.040]  foment a group that will oppose them and
[2:20:23.760 --> 2:20:30.440]  through their conflicts and resolutions and resolutions of the key that means like treaties for instance and laws signed into law
[2:20:30.840 --> 2:20:35.640]  Then then you are guiding both of them along a pre-planned path
[2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:42.840]  And that's how you get it. Now most folk about to choose one side or another. That's the nature of humanity and
[2:20:43.200 --> 2:20:49.880]  Through the use of politics and sides you're being conned because eventually the two paths end up on the same road
[2:20:49.880 --> 2:20:53.560]  I always say there's two there's two wings on the bird there
[2:20:54.040 --> 2:21:00.280]  On the emblem of the US and they're both joined to the same body and the body is hidden behind a shield
[2:21:00.280 --> 2:21:05.800]  That's not for public view. Those that really run the government are not elected
[2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:11.280]  The social engineering is really heating up again
[2:21:12.120 --> 2:21:14.120]  How do they condition someone?
[2:21:14.880 --> 2:21:19.840]  You got someone into but I want to get deeper into it to where they're admitting they're setting up the North American Union
[2:21:19.840 --> 2:21:23.000]  They're admitting they're setting up the Caribbean Union the African Union the Asian Union
[2:21:23.360 --> 2:21:29.480]  They're they're setting up this global nanny state the children are being trained to tattle on their parents spy on their parents to
[2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:34.120]  Rebuke them for taking a hot bath at night. That was in the New York Times as you know a week and a half ago
[2:21:34.680 --> 2:21:40.240]  For driving a car that's you know uses too much fuel and the parents are saying oh, I'm so proud of my children
[2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:44.320]  Telling me what to do, but that's the state coming in and becoming the parents
[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:49.680]  But not just parents turning the children into little little Nazis to report on the parents
[2:21:49.680 --> 2:21:54.480]  I mean, this is classical hard-core tyranny, but it's okay because it's for the environment
[2:21:54.480 --> 2:22:00.680]  There's a few wells talked about the need to use children and indoctrinate them heavily
[2:22:01.440 --> 2:22:06.480]  Limits of course the information because children see things either black or white. There's no great area
[2:22:06.720 --> 2:22:11.360]  They're too young and and show them injustice and they will become young fanatics
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:13.360]  they will then go out into society and
[2:22:14.080 --> 2:22:16.600]  force the appearance to comply
[2:22:17.080 --> 2:22:23.480]  Many authors in the past use the same terminology and we find that Lord veteran Russell was the guy who put it into an actual
[2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:28.360]  Science on how to do it from kindergarten in England for instance right now
[2:22:29.200 --> 2:22:31.120]  many many schools
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:33.480]  Will bring in teachers who are applicants
[2:22:34.320 --> 2:22:35.720]  to teach and
[2:22:35.720 --> 2:22:42.960]  The students will give you the teacher the interview and the first thing all out of their mouths is what will happen to be
[2:22:43.360 --> 2:22:46.920]  Are you care for the environment? You're all for the environment aren't you?
[2:22:46.920 --> 2:22:52.560]  Or do you care about gear rights and so on these are young and again. That's petty power training the children
[2:22:52.560 --> 2:22:56.920]  They're going to be the enforcers and when they become teenagers the military and police admit
[2:22:56.920 --> 2:23:02.800]  They're hurting a lot of public schools into military encampments into military schools that the children will then be the enforcers
[2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:09.400]  Of the state. I mean this is this is so classical tyranny. This is such classic tyranny. It just blows the mind
[2:23:09.480 --> 2:23:11.520]  Yes, and to do that to get to that stage
[2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:17.680]  They had to destroy the family unit and that was what was so interesting in the books that were written in the late 1800s
[2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:20.920]  Stay there. We're coming back to the full audience. Let's make this point. Here we go
[2:23:24.840 --> 2:23:31.280]  Talking to Alan what an amazing researcher cut into the matrix give you out his websites here in the next segment
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.800]  There's links to them up on info wars.com
[2:23:35.920 --> 2:23:41.480]  Under the guise of anti-terrorism the guys of the environment they're training children all over the country
[2:23:41.480 --> 2:23:46.760]  Not just in public schools, but private schools that follow the same curriculum your parents are bad having children are bad
[2:23:47.920 --> 2:23:50.800]  The police state is good rebuke your parents
[2:23:50.800 --> 2:23:53.880]  Do you know don't let them use too much food eat too much meat?
[2:23:54.040 --> 2:23:59.640]  Don't let them take a hot bath. Don't let them drive an SUV and the parents are saying oh, I'm so glad to have my parents
[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:04.040]  I mean my children bossing me around. It's so good to have my children bossing me around
[2:24:04.040 --> 2:24:07.160]  So first they teach the parents don't be parents don't be involved
[2:24:07.160 --> 2:24:12.000]  Don't tell your children what to think that's so they're a clean slate for the state to indoctrinate them
[2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:17.520]  Then they get the children on these power trips and Alan Watt was talking about that how they're turning them into good little
[2:24:18.320 --> 2:24:21.240]  Good little stazis break that down for us
[2:24:21.680 --> 2:24:27.240]  Yes, well Lord better and Russell was given experimental schools at the beginning of the 1900s
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:35.720]  By permission of the crown the royal crown was behind it and he found it through experimentation and scientific indoctrination
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:41.600]  that the children would get the total loyalty to their teachers and the school and
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:49.320]  They would listen to nothing that their parents gave them on a moral basis or try to pass on through their through the tradition or culture
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:55.600]  In other words, the state was to eventually give the children any more of the new morality that they would grow up in and
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:59.120]  That's been successful. They always go for the children. We saw that
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:01.280]  used and
[2:25:01.280 --> 2:25:07.920]  In the Soviet system, they had the young communist society who were absolutely rabid in their beliefs
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:10.840]  They were completely indoctrinated and Hitler youth
[2:25:11.400 --> 2:25:14.480]  Was the same thing now have the same thing. Yes
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:19.440]  And so now we're using it globally and it's part of what they call that the First Earth Army
[2:25:19.720 --> 2:25:26.200]  That was mentioned back in the I think it was the 70s because Jean Roddenberry who gave us the great
[2:25:26.200 --> 2:25:31.240]  Star Trek series of predictive programming
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:36.200]  About the future done on a science on a space type
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:40.800]  Area, but it's all about the planet Earth if you look through the stories of the planet
[2:25:40.800 --> 2:25:45.680]  Well, the symbol of the Federation is the UN symbol over the Milky Way
[2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:52.960]  That's right, and you saw the multiculturalism you saw a specialized society. Everyone was a specialist in a certain area and
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:59.640]  And and anyone who wouldn't join the Free Trade Federation was a bad guy and ugly and nasty and
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:04.320]  So that was all about the world and United Nations, etc. And free trade
[2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:10.600]  But Jean Roddenberry was a member of NASA and that's where he got all the predictive programming for that
[2:26:10.600 --> 2:26:12.600]  He was to put into his stories
[2:26:12.840 --> 2:26:19.520]  To raise a generation who were already prepared mentally through fiction for the society that we've brought in in reality
[2:26:19.520 --> 2:26:27.640]  How they actually lived in their lifetime, and that's how all media works, especially fiction. It's heavily funded
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:34.320]  The Pentagon has been funding Hollywood for since even before World War two Alan Watt
[2:26:34.320 --> 2:26:39.520]  How do we break out of this matrix? I mean not only do we have the children eight nine hours a day?
[2:26:39.520 --> 2:26:43.040]  They're they're expanding the school year in many areas to not nine months
[2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:46.880]  But ten or eleven months in Europe and Canada and in some places in the US
[2:26:46.880 --> 2:26:52.160]  They're having after-school programs and encouraging the parents to go have fun at the bar leave your children here
[2:26:52.160 --> 2:26:57.280]  And then when they get home, they sit down children for an average about four and a half to five hours a day
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:26:59.640]  Parents about three and a half hours a day
[2:26:59.880 --> 2:27:03.000]  So there's really not real human interaction going on
[2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:09.120]  There's less and less of that and if it is it's a big gladiatorial diversion or distraction and these big communal
[2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:15.920]  Group think events. I mean the social engineers know exactly what they're doing and then they have an overlay that I constantly hear
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:21.960]  Everything's an accident governments are idiots. They couldn't plan that they couldn't do that when we have all their documents and plans
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:26.540]  Where they were saying they're doing I mean and actually doing it
[2:27:27.040 --> 2:27:29.040]  I say Lord Bertrand Russell
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:36.200]  See initially their idea of the lead in Britain and the delete throughout Europe their idea was to follow the plan of play
[2:27:36.200 --> 2:27:40.960]  So where they'd remove the children from their parents at birth or from their mother at birth and
[2:27:41.720 --> 2:27:43.960]  Bring them up and communally
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:50.640]  But they found that if they could get them as young as two into kindergarten with that scientific indoctrination
[2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:57.120]  Then as I say that the parental input would be simply cancelled out and that has happened
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:03.560]  They will not listen to their parents at all and of course they use the media big-time entertainment for those young children
[2:28:03.560 --> 2:28:06.720]  Even true cartoons to indoctrinate them further
[2:28:06.720 --> 2:28:15.080]  Therefore they feel more estranged from their parents. In fact, it's all they are are being brought up economically and paid for by their parents
[2:28:15.080 --> 2:28:19.200]  And that's that was a good thing according to Russell would save the state having to fork out the money
[2:28:19.520 --> 2:28:21.840]  We found the same thing in the Soviet Union
[2:28:21.840 --> 2:28:26.280]  They tried that because pure communism was to be based on Plato's Republic
[2:28:26.440 --> 2:28:32.240]  Where they did remove the children they tried it in certain areas, but the parents still like to have their children
[2:28:32.240 --> 2:28:38.920]  It was a natural time actual bond like China. They let them visit a little bit now and then meanwhile more more people work for the state
[2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:46.320]  Or dependent on the state to where you have this horde of dependent brain dead zombies that work for the system now honing in on us
[2:28:46.320 --> 2:28:53.120]  I'm getting confirmed reports of people walking up to people at coffee shops and in restaurants saying why are you reading a book?
[2:28:53.120 --> 2:28:58.000]  What is that book about is that bad like what the people are starting to not trust readers?
[2:28:58.000 --> 2:29:01.800]  So Alan wants to stay there riveting information so important
[2:29:01.800 --> 2:29:05.720]  I want to get more into what we're gonna see under this new ruler system on the other side
[2:29:07.280 --> 2:29:10.480]  We're on the March the empires on the run
[2:29:11.280 --> 2:29:14.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:23.560]  You know as a father and a husband one of the enjoyable things in my life has been walking in at night and checking on my children
[2:29:23.560 --> 2:29:31.200]  Checking on my children checking up on my wife making sure she has the things she needs but mostly providing for my family and knowing that they're secure
[2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:34.000]  That they feel comfortable every day in their little skins
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:38.360]  They don't have to worry about the oddities of the world taking over and wrecking their lives
[2:29:38.360 --> 2:29:45.160]  I've always wanted to be a good provider and I'm not gonna change that now just because the economy is in up evil and because there's a lot of
[2:29:45.160 --> 2:29:51.960]  Political and social uncertainty and I hear about global famines and I see the escalating prices and gas and food and oil
[2:29:51.960 --> 2:29:55.320]  Electricity is gonna go way up. I'm told this winter. Hey, I'm not gonna sweat it
[2:29:55.320 --> 2:29:58.560]  I've done the right thing. I got rid of a bunch of junk and toys out in the garage
[2:29:58.560 --> 2:30:04.280]  I converted that money into food that foods out there. I've got a two or three year supply of food in the garage my family's secure
[2:30:04.280 --> 2:30:08.440]  I don't gotta worry. Okay. I do hope that you'll join me in this new sense of American security

[2:32:58.120 --> 2:33:00.120]  county by county country by country
[2:33:00.120 --> 2:33:05.160]  Social engineers eugenicists are in control of our society
[2:33:05.720 --> 2:33:11.080]  We have to say no we have to resist we have to get informed and get involved
[2:33:11.720 --> 2:33:15.480]  Don't just sit by ladies and gentlemen and watch history go by
[2:33:16.120 --> 2:33:21.800]  With a bunch of tyrants controlling it get involved today and resist the new world order
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:27.240]  If you think i'm going to sit by and be a slave not fight back
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:34.520]  You got another thing coming. I am not going to live on my knees as a slave
[2:33:38.920 --> 2:33:41.720]  I am not going to go quietly into the night
[2:33:42.520 --> 2:33:45.320]  We may be going down but not without resistance
[2:33:45.880 --> 2:33:49.720]  I am not going to sit in a ditch and lick the boots of the new world order
[2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:56.120]  I am going to go 110 against him. I'm gonna be the best job I can to activate my fellow humans
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:34:02.200]  Not to even believe what I'm saying but to look into the true nature of the global power structure
[2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:08.840]  All right, alan watch fire out your website for folks so they can find out more about the great research
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:11.080]  You're doing on a daily basis
[2:34:11.240 --> 2:34:14.280]  Yeah, they can cut they can look into cutting through the matrix dot com
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:17.480]  and alan walk sent sentinel dot eu
[2:34:18.280 --> 2:34:24.600]  Websites for lots of previous talks have given filling in a lot of the histories led up to a present state
[2:34:24.600 --> 2:34:26.600]  And where we're going with it all
[2:34:26.840 --> 2:34:32.840]  And I named the big foundations and the think tanks that work with them this parallel government
[2:34:32.840 --> 2:34:34.680]  That's really what it is
[2:34:34.680 --> 2:34:41.400]  It also consists of ex prime ministers and presidents the work in the cfr and the royal institute of international affairs
[2:34:41.880 --> 2:34:45.160]  All working together globally on a long-term strategy
[2:34:45.400 --> 2:34:52.600]  I mean for instance when they set up the cfr in the us as a branch of the royal institute of international affairs
[2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:57.640]  They also set up specialized departments the institute for specific relations was one of them
[2:34:58.200 --> 2:35:00.200]  And their job was to work
[2:35:00.280 --> 2:35:07.320]  80 years ago in getting the asian the far eastern states to to come in under a block a treating block
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:13.240]  So that's how long they've been working on all of this intergenerationally towards the same goal and people are ignorant
[2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:19.640]  I mean they love the cliche of something couldn't last hundreds of years. They couldn't pass it on generationally
[2:35:19.640 --> 2:35:23.880]  How do you have the marine corps 240 something years old?
[2:35:23.880 --> 2:35:25.400]  How do you have the army?
[2:35:25.400 --> 2:35:32.920]  240 something years old in the u.s. Or the british army been constituted under the same name and system for 500 plus years
[2:35:33.240 --> 2:35:40.680]  How do you have universities that are 500 600 700 800 years old or churches, you know like the catholic church
[2:35:41.160 --> 2:35:47.080]  1800 years old. I mean these are generational systems where people sit in the seats of power
[2:35:47.080 --> 2:35:53.240]  As the chancellors or chairman of those corporations of those companies of those universities
[2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:54.840]  And then they
[2:35:54.840 --> 2:35:59.240]  Intermarry with other elites they expand their power while they're in their seat of power
[2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:05.960]  It's human nature to want more power. It's a fraternal thing and it's how history works and somehow they convince the public
[2:36:06.520 --> 2:36:08.520]  That no no no none of that's going on
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:11.960]  Yeah, they gave us a thing called democracy
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:18.360]  Democracy which was a good panacea because the idea of democracy is you can always vote this bunch out
[2:36:19.160 --> 2:36:23.800]  That's what you do in democracy. You don't vote a new bunch and you're really so sick of the last bunch
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:24.920]  You're voting them out
[2:36:24.920 --> 2:36:30.760]  So they play this ping-pong game and that stops people from having revolutions every four or five years
[2:36:31.000 --> 2:36:32.760]  That's why they gave us democracy
[2:36:32.760 --> 2:36:39.000]  But all along they say the parallel government has run since they get the birth of so-called democracy
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:42.360]  This parallel government has been here under many different names
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:45.800]  and now it's so well funded and organized
[2:36:46.360 --> 2:36:52.040]  And funds their NGO groups that create policy. It's now emerging as the official
[2:36:52.440 --> 2:36:55.400]  Government, I mean, why are they now emerging? Why are they now admitting?
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:36:58.360]  It's going to be a global government with the global controlled currencies
[2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:00.760]  Uh under their system
[2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:04.520]  Because now as you see with the cfr on their own website to say that they've
[2:37:04.520 --> 2:37:10.280]  Used enough scientific indoctrination that the public are ready for it. They have altered
[2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:13.960]  The perceptions of the public their outlooks on life
[2:37:14.760 --> 2:37:17.160]  Through massive propaganda for their whole life long
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:23.560]  That they believe that they're ready to accept anything that's presented to them most people truly truly believe
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:29.000]  Already with this campaign that we are causing problems on the environment
[2:37:29.000 --> 2:37:34.520]  They truly believe this and they truly do believe that there are better people more intelligent people above them
[2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:40.200]  That will take care of it all and that's the key the elite have hoped for hundreds and hundreds of years
[2:37:40.520 --> 2:37:45.800]  That the public would just accept that their betters should rule back. Well, yes to their lives
[2:37:46.200 --> 2:37:49.320]  Capitulate give in uh ellen. Let's talk about
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:56.280]  What's going to happen in the future as we capitulate and what the system's going to try to do as there is a great awakening
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:02.040]  Because there are a lot of people, you know, it's exponential who are waking up to this or at least a certain levels of it
[2:38:02.600 --> 2:38:03.160]  Yes
[2:38:03.160 --> 2:38:05.480]  Well, the people i tell you now is the time because
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:11.720]  They better start taking to the streets and doing as mass demonstrations till they cannot be ignored anymore
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:17.560]  Because all the talking in the world amongst each other over the internet is not going to stop this
[2:38:18.440 --> 2:38:23.400]  Um, it has to be literally people people contact is what they need with other people
[2:38:23.400 --> 2:38:26.680]  And mass demonstrations to stop this from coming in
[2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:32.520]  Because a horror show has been planned for the rest of society. We're already being called off every day
[2:38:33.160 --> 2:38:36.920]  In newspapers the reporting at new zealom just today
[2:38:37.720 --> 2:38:40.120]  The men in new zealom are almost sterile now
[2:38:40.840 --> 2:38:42.840]  Uh, this is a planned takedown
[2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:49.400]  Because population control was one of the main mandates from the league of nations back in in 1919
[2:38:49.400 --> 2:38:55.000]  Oh, that's right. There is no doubt that different fluorides different poisons are being put in the water that
[2:38:55.240 --> 2:38:56.840]  There are hundreds of different types of plastics
[2:38:56.840 --> 2:38:59.240]  But the one type that was chosen for universal adoption
[2:38:59.800 --> 2:39:03.000]  Worldwide is the type that let that gives off massive amounts
[2:39:03.480 --> 2:39:07.240]  Of estrogen mimicking chemicals that uh, feminized
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:09.240]  boys
[2:39:09.240 --> 2:39:15.400]  Uh sterilized them, uh, and and then hyper feminizes women massively increasing all sorts of reproductive problems
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:23.480]  And breast cancer they admit it. It's mainstream news, but they're not stopping it. They're actually intensifying what is lined with this even 10 cans and
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:25.960]  most other uh packaging
[2:39:26.120 --> 2:39:27.400]  for food
[2:39:27.400 --> 2:39:33.240]  And then the tetanus shots the u.n. Has been caught adding hormones to sterilize women there. Uh, this is very very serious
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:34.840]  Can you break that down?
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:38.920]  Yes, this was intentional the the new back in 1920s and 30s
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:47.880]  The the effects of bisphenol from the plastics, etc. They knew by testing it in fact with with they polluted in the united states
[2:39:47.880 --> 2:39:50.600]  And I think it was Monsanto. They polluted um
[2:39:51.240 --> 2:39:52.840]  Certain villages
[2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:55.320]  Drinking water with chemicals that were coming out of pipes
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:03.320]  They studied the people and they found that the young men were growing breasts and and and stuff like this the the females were having
[2:40:03.880 --> 2:40:07.080]  menstrual menstruation at the age of six and seven
[2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:13.080]  So they understood the effects of this and and like always they always have been uses to our advantage as a key word term
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:18.520]  They always use and they have been using it. However, I do believe that inoculations were also
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:24.280]  Weaponized to also attack certain reproductive well, you don't believe you know
[2:40:24.280 --> 2:40:27.240]  It's been proven and you've gone over that that research
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:32.280]  They also love the compartmentalization the average city a facility doesn't know what they're putting in the water
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:38.440]  Uh, there's only a few companies that sell them the systems per nation. They ship it to them. Even those mixing it are just told
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:43.400]  This is what we put in there. You know, it's good for the people. They love that compartmentalization. They love putting
[2:40:44.200 --> 2:40:50.200]  These toxins into the environment where we basically have no way of getting away from it now that people are getting away from fluoride toothpaste and
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:54.280]  Fluoride water they're now saying we're going to spray it on the crops as a pesticide
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:59.160]  It'll kill bugs, but it'll also go through the membranes through the cell walls of the plants
[2:40:59.160 --> 2:41:03.160]  And and adulterate them and pregnant them with this as well
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:08.680]  Yeah, this is the plan takedown and one of the top players said back in the 60s
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:14.520]  They've got to bring the population down and and cancer is a good way to do it as any
[2:41:15.240 --> 2:41:17.800]  And sure enough, you've had the cancer explosion
[2:41:18.360 --> 2:41:24.520]  Ever since they've been tampering heavily with the food and the pesticides and stepping up the inoculations as well
[2:41:24.520 --> 2:41:29.640]  That this is planned. It's hard for people. You said yourself that just a minute ago
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:36.120]  That everything is based on trust even the doctors who give you those shots truly believe
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:40.520]  It contains what it says it does, but they have no way of proving it. Look, everyone I know
[2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:44.680]  Takes their children and gives them shots and says, oh, I should have listened to you
[2:41:44.680 --> 2:41:48.600]  My child had an autoimmune response swole up had to be given all these drugs
[2:41:48.600 --> 2:41:55.000]  Or everybody I mean everybody I talked to won't listen or they want to get their dog a checkup and the vets won't see them now
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:58.120]  They're not injected every year. I know a bunch of vets and say it's ridiculous
[2:41:58.120 --> 2:42:01.320]  It should only be every 10 according to you know, even conventional stuff
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:04.280]  And then they give the dog the shot and the dogs die or almost die
[2:42:04.920 --> 2:42:13.720]  I mean, it's there but but they also institutionalize the breast cancer and the and the other cancers caused by the injections and the hormones
[2:42:14.120 --> 2:42:17.160]  And then they make it a fad they make it. Oh, everybody's got autism now
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:20.600]  You know from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 86 and you know
[2:42:20.600 --> 2:42:26.440]  Then it becomes a campaign issue and the government's going to help you or or now I'm hearing ads all over the country radio TV and print
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:33.160]  About how children foster children are more, you know highly susceptible to suicide drugs being killed
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:36.520]  Having post-traumatic stress disorder than even our troops
[2:42:36.840 --> 2:42:39.400]  And so the government needs more funds in power
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:44.120]  Because the foster children have got it so bad when that's all been done by design
[2:42:44.120 --> 2:42:49.160]  And we have the heads of the state health departments on video in in-game saying they have bad gene pool
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:52.200]  So we're doing this to them. That's right. That all ties together
[2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:55.960]  Because even with the human genomic experiment the secretive
[2:42:57.080 --> 2:43:01.000]  worldwide campaign to try and and type everyone's genes
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:05.480]  Had many different aspects to it and what's a eugenics program?
[2:43:05.480 --> 2:43:09.080]  They want to find out those people with input. They call inferior genes
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:12.760]  Because those are the types who will not be allowed in the future to breed
[2:43:12.760 --> 2:43:14.520]  You'll die off
[2:43:14.520 --> 2:43:16.440]  at rather quickly probably
[2:43:16.440 --> 2:43:22.760]  And only those with the with the specified genes will be allowed to procreate with permission that is
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:29.960]  At least for one phase off this agenda. This is a long-term multi-level phase. That's right. They're testing each phase
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:32.600]  Then it goes mainline and they start testing the next
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:39.560]  Operation it's just so incredible and even in the movie gattica, which is well worth the seeing
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:42.200]  They show you the genetically enhanced
[2:43:42.920 --> 2:43:45.720]  People in the future society not too far in the future
[2:43:46.040 --> 2:43:49.640]  That actually creates a class a new class of people those who are
[2:43:50.280 --> 2:43:55.960]  Past is genetically perfect and superior and the rest of the people have have the rotten jobs at the bottom
[2:43:55.960 --> 2:43:57.800]  They're inferior types
[2:43:57.800 --> 2:44:00.200]  That's that's actually coming in shortly. Yeah
[2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:08.440]  And then we have control groups african tribes that won't take inoculations a huge populations of over 150 000
[2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:10.120]  Amish in illinois alone
[2:44:10.120 --> 2:44:16.680]  Where major university studies have been done none of them have autism their cancer rates are thousands of percentile lower
[2:44:17.480 --> 2:44:20.520]  And it's because they're not taking the inoculations. They're drinking well water
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:26.840]  And they're not eating the modified food the modified food and i this is much where i've come to realize
[2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:33.800]  After studying the scientists who helped put it all together a lot of these scientists came from warfare institutes
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:35.800]  They have weaponized the food
[2:44:35.800 --> 2:44:39.480]  They have weaponized the food and and so for police officers
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:43.160]  For fbi agents for people in the system for governors listening
[2:44:43.720 --> 2:44:46.760]  Uh, you know for high level people you you think you're part of the system
[2:44:47.240 --> 2:44:50.920]  It's happening to your children. It's happening to all of you and you can laugh all day
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:54.360]  But everything we've told you is coming true. This is real
[2:44:54.920 --> 2:44:57.320]  And and i'm sorry that reality is so horrifying
[2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:00.440]  But you can't be like a child and say well i choose to not believe it
[2:45:00.760 --> 2:45:05.160]  Whether you deny it or whether you accept it and decide to fight it it is still there and still going on
[2:45:05.160 --> 2:45:07.160]  I got an article on my website
[2:45:08.040 --> 2:45:10.040]  It was from a mainstream paper
[2:45:10.760 --> 2:45:14.920]  Where their main headquarters in the united states from insanto
[2:45:15.480 --> 2:45:17.080]  Their cafeteria
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:19.320]  Banned the use of gm food
[2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:22.920]  For for the staff who work there. They said it was dangerous
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:29.480]  Yeah, i saw that so that's how it works and of course we have these giant people don't realize
[2:45:29.480 --> 2:45:38.120]  I've been to london a few times, but what's the uh, isn't it windsor palace that is like 50 something square miles?
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:43.320]  Yeah, yeah windsor castle. Yeah, but i know there's a whole bunch of the uh,
[2:45:43.720 --> 2:45:46.120]  Buckingham palace in london's like a huge part of the city
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:50.040]  But but but but i've seen documentaries with prince philip and prince charles
[2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:53.320]  Where they'll go on and they have hundreds of these palaces
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:46:00.520]  And you see them throw this in our face in in the movie children of men where the government's put something out to basically sterilize
[2:46:01.000 --> 2:46:06.120]  The the the the population and the government staging terror attacks. They tell you three times of the film
[2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:08.360]  It's the government staging the terror attacks
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:13.080]  But all of a sudden when they drive into buckingham palace and however many square miles that is
[2:46:14.200 --> 2:46:19.720]  Uh, you know, they've everything's clean everything's nice. They have good food. They have good water right outside
[2:46:19.720 --> 2:46:25.560]  It's dirty and poisonous and i've saw prince philip admit they grow all their own food raise all their own beef
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:30.200]  On those palaces tens of thousands live on those grounds
[2:46:30.680 --> 2:46:36.360]  And and and they all are openly eugenics. He goes in and buys himself the organic beef
[2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:43.800]  You know everything is is is and i've read about the rocker fellers are all obsessed. They'll have wine and water and food
[2:46:44.200 --> 2:46:48.840]  Uh, you know that is is is hyper clean non-gmo
[2:46:48.840 --> 2:46:53.800]  You grown on their own farms and it's trucked and flown everywhere they go
[2:46:54.360 --> 2:46:57.480]  Yes, I watched a program on bar moral castle in scotland
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:01.320]  Where they have the biggest the biggest uh herds for the royalty
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:07.640]  Herds of cattle and so on and they eat the natural grass etc. There's not no gm anything no pellets eat there
[2:47:08.280 --> 2:47:14.280]  And eat and send their chef up there to pick which ones are to be slaughtered to be brought down for the royal banquets
[2:47:14.280 --> 2:47:16.280]  Meanwhile
[2:47:18.280 --> 2:47:28.280]  They're sending give up all your rights for the environment save the earth while they are involved these elites in cross species open air planting of plants and animals
[2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:34.280]  They announced in Canada in the u.s. Hey, guess what you've already been i've been eating clone food for years shut up and like it
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:36.760]  They're already getting all sorts of mutations
[2:47:38.040 --> 2:47:40.040]  Oh alan i can't believe it's so serious
[2:47:40.040 --> 2:47:47.000]  Yes, and this was planned. It's a warfare. Is it she they declared war on the people a long time ago?
[2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:52.680]  Uh, and according to them the common people are obsolete. This is part of their religion
[2:47:53.160 --> 2:47:57.400]  We are obsolete they believe they're the most evolved type because they have been
[2:47:57.880 --> 2:48:01.080]  Into specialized breeding for centuries in the centuries
[2:48:01.800 --> 2:48:07.000]  And having their mates picked up for them for specific qualities whereas we the commoners
[2:48:07.000 --> 2:48:14.280]  Uh, are the low end of the gene pool and we're the junk genes. It's time to eradicate the junk genes who are now our problem to them
[2:48:16.280 --> 2:48:21.400]  And then they claim more junk genes but in true eugenics as you know, it's not even positive or negative eugenics
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:26.040]  It's truly to dumb the mass down so they're more easily controlled and that's stated
[2:48:26.040 --> 2:48:31.240]  I mean that's so cold-blooded that everything this world is going to is a horror show what's coming in
[2:48:31.240 --> 2:48:37.560]  And there's never been done on such a scale before where you won't be able to do anything at all
[2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:45.720]  Uh, and for yourself you can make any decision for yourself an agency of one form or another will decide something for you
[2:48:46.120 --> 2:48:53.320]  You'll have to have check-ins to see where you are report ins to see where you are and they're the authorities weekly environmental
[2:48:53.720 --> 2:48:55.000]  visits
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:00.600]  Monthly this they're announcing this in europe and england and us cps visits to everyone's homes
[2:49:00.600 --> 2:49:03.160]  Yeah, all of us under the social workers control
[2:49:04.040 --> 2:49:09.080]  That's correct. They want to give you annual psychological tests to see if you harbor terrorist thoughts
[2:49:09.880 --> 2:49:17.400]  Right out of james or of orwell's book. Yeah, they're claiming these quackish electronic machines will decide if you're a terrorist or a liar
[2:49:19.160 --> 2:49:21.160]  and also
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:24.520]  As I say the financial stick is the big one because
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:31.480]  Russell and his big think tank back in the 50s said they'll bring in a new type of financial system
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:34.200]  where the state
[2:49:34.280 --> 2:49:39.720]  Will issue credits into your bank account every week. You can't save them up
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:46.040]  Therefore, and that's the new carbon credit. Yes, and in carbon rationing. It's actually happening
[2:49:46.280 --> 2:49:51.400]  Yes, and he said we use as a form of social punishment if you are against the system
[2:49:51.400 --> 2:49:56.280]  They will draw your funds and you either starve or you're out because there be no private property
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:49:59.720]  You'll be rental only and you won't be able to afford the roof over your head
[2:50:00.120 --> 2:50:00.680]  Good god
[2:50:00.680 --> 2:50:07.400]  We're going to skip this break too for the info wars.com audio stream listeners exclusively and prison planet tv viewers for those folks
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:13.320]  Because this is too important ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back everybody else in the m&m dial global shortwave and satellite
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:18.440]  This is the one the only gcn radio network spread the word however you're listening. Alan wants our guest
[2:50:18.440 --> 2:50:21.000]  Have you okay, Alan?
[2:50:21.640 --> 2:50:26.760]  I mean i'm jumping in here because everything you're saying is so true and everything you say that i think of a thousand plus examples
[2:50:27.000 --> 2:50:31.240]  Of where it's backed up. I mean we are so far along. We already have the elite sequestered
[2:50:32.280 --> 2:50:38.280]  In their research communities sequestered in their government reservations and compounds sequestered in their elite government facilities
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:40.920]  In their underground facilities in their palaces
[2:50:41.560 --> 2:50:45.800]  You know, it's a governmental system, you know the saddam palaces the royalty palaces in england
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:48.840]  And and and they're in this higher level technological system
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:52.920]  We're down here being mass poisoned and it's such a few
[2:50:53.560 --> 2:50:57.080]  Of the actual even elite that are even aware of what's going on
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:51:00.600]  Uh, I think the key here is not just waking up the general public
[2:51:00.840 --> 2:51:06.920]  But waking up people at higher level strata's of the compartmentalized system just like an orwell's 84 and the real stasi system
[2:51:07.240 --> 2:51:13.400]  Or the malice system, you know, they're really watching the outer party and the inner party more than anybody
[2:51:13.400 --> 2:51:18.680]  Does it the resistance as winston said start within uh, he first he thought it was the proles
[2:51:18.680 --> 2:51:23.080]  But really the resistance is going to be in the inner and inner and outer party
[2:51:24.200 --> 2:51:28.920]  Yes, uh, that will happen. And of course the ones at the top know this too
[2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:35.080]  Uh, I read books years ago on on the intelligence agencies and how they operated
[2:51:36.040 --> 2:51:42.280]  And what was interesting was the soviet union had more files on their employees
[2:51:42.280 --> 2:51:44.280]  Uh, then the common people
[2:51:45.080 --> 2:51:50.760]  And masses of data on them and their movements and who they met and who the talk to what they said on the phones
[2:51:51.400 --> 2:51:53.400]  That is the same with the lower enchilons
[2:51:53.800 --> 2:51:59.560]  Who work and bring in this system and now that's all being standardized with the cell phones the the face scanning
[2:52:00.040 --> 2:52:03.960]  Uh, the satellites that can scan your heat resonance and how you walk. That's all admitted
[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:07.560]  Now they have computers to do it where they can just pull up a file
[2:52:07.560 --> 2:52:13.640]  So it increases that power of surveillance infinitely. Yes, and so those who are in the lower enchilons
[2:52:13.640 --> 2:52:20.520]  But who are workers towards this system eventually will start to see their own demise when they no longer become necessary
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:23.880]  Because other departments are taking over their functions
[2:52:24.440 --> 2:52:31.000]  gradually all the organizations that have been built up and the multi branches now of police is incredible how many
[2:52:31.400 --> 2:52:35.400]  Agencies police have now and that's the real reason it's all being phased in
[2:52:35.400 --> 2:52:42.280]  Yes, and so this was ones who were the quiet bureaucratic type workers who did their job and kept their mouth shut
[2:52:42.920 --> 2:52:48.200]  Will shortly be obsolete, but they know too much and that's when they become afraid
[2:52:48.760 --> 2:52:54.600]  Very very afraid and they should be afraid too. All right, ellen. I want to come back in the final main segment talk about solutions
[2:52:55.480 --> 2:53:00.840]  Uh, how we get around this. I know you've got another program coming up. Can you stay for five more minutes five after sure
[2:53:00.840 --> 2:53:06.040]  Okay, so you can stay till the five after next hour. Yeah, okay, but but no longer correct
[2:53:06.440 --> 2:53:09.400]  Maybe ten past and okay. Well, that's
[2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:14.280]  Exactly ten past because we can come back at there's a quick break at five and we can come back for a few more minutes
[2:53:14.280 --> 2:53:19.320]  Or you want to leave it five? I'm not on to 39 minutes past. All right. Well, we'll just let you go ahead after that
[2:53:19.320 --> 2:53:21.320]  Okay, here we go. Alan. We're going live right now
[2:53:25.400 --> 2:53:27.400]  You have to understand something ladies and gentlemen
[2:53:27.400 --> 2:53:33.240]  I read the british ministry of defense public documents the pentagon plans
[2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:39.320]  They've admitted on c-span with thomas barnett naval war college that there's a global government. They're enslaving us period
[2:53:40.840 --> 2:53:42.840]  And one time I was on the phone with barnett
[2:53:43.160 --> 2:53:46.680]  Trying to get him on the show and he said no your alex jones. I'm not coming on and he said we're gonna beat you
[2:53:46.680 --> 2:53:49.240]  I want you to know that and I said no, we're gonna beat your new old lord
[2:53:49.240 --> 2:53:52.360]  He said no, you're not and literally growled at me on the phone
[2:53:52.840 --> 2:53:56.120]  So when you're actually talking to one of their planners, they're like, listen, you're gonna be beaten
[2:53:56.120 --> 2:53:57.720]  We're gonna win
[2:53:57.720 --> 2:54:01.880]  And I want you to understand something they're ready for you to try to storm london storm washington
[2:54:01.960 --> 2:54:05.720]  They will use a neutron bomb on you. They state this in mainline government documents
[2:54:05.960 --> 2:54:07.960]  They're ready for the old front on the soul
[2:54:08.040 --> 2:54:10.680]  They can't handle a societal awakening to their
[2:54:11.240 --> 2:54:16.040]  Technocracy and their system the information alan watt and I cover and only a few others unfortunately
[2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:18.600]  Instead of the rest, it's all new age, you know
[2:54:18.600 --> 2:54:25.960]  Control, which is another new order arm and I have to tell you it's sad that so much of the awakening movements co-opted
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:29.320]  But thank god, we're some of the most prominent people out. There's some folks are listening
[2:54:30.520 --> 2:54:35.320]  Bottom line here. We need to get this information get it out because they are scientifically
[2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:38.440]  Preparing for us to resist them and they're worried about you
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:43.800]  Activating person to person getting healthy talking to neighbors educating them about the system
[2:54:43.800 --> 2:54:49.160]  And then just having a general awakening and saying no and then stop arguing with the new world order
[2:54:49.400 --> 2:54:53.400]  Openly announcing and declaring we see you. We know the scientific dictatorship
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:54:58.760]  We are saying no to you and that's one of the only ways to get around this stop watching
[2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:04.280]  You know mainline brainwashing tv start spending more time with your family stop being so materialistic
[2:55:04.600 --> 2:55:11.640]  Stop letting them control you stop making them, you know, let you feel inadequate through madison avenue being empowered individually
[2:55:11.640 --> 2:55:19.240]  Because they're ready for the frontal assault alan. How do you see us getting around their system solutions for this segment the next?
[2:55:20.200 --> 2:55:22.200]  The solutions i'll tell you
[2:55:22.600 --> 2:55:24.600]  Have to be based on a value system
[2:55:25.560 --> 2:55:33.880]  We've been raised with a a generation of moral relativism where anything goes to the extent they're now displaying corpses
[2:55:34.600 --> 2:55:36.600]  In art galleries
[2:55:36.600 --> 2:55:43.400]  And they say it's all very wonderful and pretty what i've done you see over the last 50 years especially is to help us to believe
[2:55:43.880 --> 2:55:46.280]  And go into this dehumanizing agenda
[2:55:46.600 --> 2:55:51.160]  We participate in it with everything that we do when we go along but when there's no disgust
[2:55:51.800 --> 2:55:56.600]  At what's been done to humans uh fetuses and jars of urein on display as art
[2:55:56.920 --> 2:56:00.680]  You see what they're doing is dehumanizing us and saying you're nothing special
[2:56:01.160 --> 2:56:05.640]  You're you're just a bunch of protoplasm and nerve endings and so on and synapse. You're ugly
[2:56:05.640 --> 2:56:09.240]  Yes, and and therefore there's nothing special about you
[2:56:09.640 --> 2:56:13.160]  That's why they had to eradicate the vestiges of religion
[2:56:13.480 --> 2:56:19.560]  Which said every person who had something sacred within them. That was their first war was against religion
[2:56:19.960 --> 2:56:21.960]  Now it's into secular humanism
[2:56:22.280 --> 2:56:28.440]  For the public at least and when you believe that that's all you are you've just allowed yourself
[2:56:29.000 --> 2:56:34.760]  To be dictated to they will tell you when to walk into the gas chamber or the extermination chamber
[2:56:34.760 --> 2:56:39.000]  After all you're not an endangered species. You're just a freak of nature
[2:56:39.800 --> 2:56:42.280]  That this is you're a parasite. You're a disease
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:45.720]  You're a cancer and and they use the peer pressure to teach us
[2:56:45.720 --> 2:56:52.280]  We're worthless to sell us on seeing our own species and simulated and real murders being torn apart on tv 100
[2:56:52.600 --> 2:56:54.040]  Plus times a day
[2:56:54.040 --> 2:56:58.520]  All of this and they teach us with peer pressure to say and do what the tv says
[2:56:58.840 --> 2:57:03.960]  Folks if you don't break out of not caring what your neighbors think and of screaming bloody murder and breaking out of the
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:08.600]  Conditioning and shaking it off. If you don't do that. It's over. We're being enslaved. We're being controlled
[2:57:08.600 --> 2:57:15.560]  We're being euthanized in slow motion. I mean, isn't that key to just not care what people think anymore and realize we're being brainwashed
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:23.160]  Yes, and really that's the key to it people's emotions have truly been blunted for the majority of the public
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:31.160]  They live in a world of myth and fantasy. They get upset by my outrage at being a slave with my family under attack
[2:57:31.160 --> 2:57:34.760]  Yeah, they think it's abnormal. I mean, I'm just a primitive human
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:39.880]  I just had my instincts intact told to see enslavement and get upset and say we got to fight this
[2:57:40.120 --> 2:57:46.040]  That's a normal propulsion system for protection of the species and they've gone in and turned that off alan
[2:57:46.360 --> 2:57:49.960]  We're gonna be back in 70 seconds. I'm gonna want you to continue on that thought
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:56.680]  Gonna tell you sit down relax. It's okay. No, we've been successful because we have told people it's serious. We'll be right back
[2:57:56.680 --> 2:58:02.120]  You are listening to gcn
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:05.880]  Visit gcnlive.com today
[2:58:09.160 --> 2:58:11.160]  It is a big idea
[2:58:11.720 --> 2:58:14.520]  A new world order in the near future
[2:58:15.240 --> 2:58:20.120]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the builder bird
[2:58:20.120 --> 2:58:26.440]  So their objective being world domination for thousands of years their dark order grew
[2:58:27.160 --> 2:58:34.600]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order their great dream of exterminating 80 percent of humanity is at hand
[2:58:37.480 --> 2:58:40.520]  For the first time in history, they will learn the secret the
[2:58:41.560 --> 2:58:47.400]  World Order agenda. Builder bird is making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money
[2:58:47.400 --> 2:58:53.960]  They have all the money they need. They're after power. Yes, they're after music order in game on dvd at prisonplanet.com

[2:58:59.480 --> 2:59:03.560]  In game blueprint for global enslaved you have been warned
[2:59:03.560 --> 2:59:13.560]  Waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:59:23.320 --> 2:59:26.520]  The global engineers of tyranny bringing in this nightmare
[2:59:26.520 --> 2:59:33.640]  Technocracy this scientific dictatorship are counting on you not having the will and the focus to take action
[2:59:34.360 --> 2:59:36.360]  To reach out to wake up your friends and family
[2:59:38.440 --> 2:59:41.480]  Folks, we don't have a choice. They're already killing us with the soft-kill weapons
[2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:45.800]  The fluoride the poisons in the water the gmo food. We have all their documents
[2:59:46.520 --> 2:59:51.720]  By all their documents thousands of them sure there's tens of thousands more we don't have but we have it all documented
[2:59:51.720 --> 2:59:56.280]  That's how we can tell you what's going to happen two three four five years ahead of time
[2:59:57.000 --> 3:00:01.160]  This is such precious information and I burn with desire to warn you
[3:00:01.720 --> 3:00:05.560]  But look at my neighbors and people they'll quietly go. Yeah, I know what you're telling me is true
[3:00:05.560 --> 3:00:08.760]  Yeah, yeah, I know but I don't want to speak out my neighbors will think I'm a cook
[3:00:09.640 --> 3:00:16.760]  You know, it's it's it's just just just waiting there these pathetic people waiting for the government and people to take care of
[3:00:16.760 --> 3:00:21.960]  And tell them what to do people have to have some self-respect and take action and take control of their destiny
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:24.120]  Alan want four minute closing statement
[3:00:24.840 --> 3:00:32.200]  Yes, the people now have to realize that they can't sit back any longer and allow this to go much further because
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:35.000]  There's a
[3:00:35.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  It's actually a step you go beyond
[3:00:37.560 --> 3:00:39.560]  But you cannot turn back on
[3:00:39.560 --> 3:00:42.440]  Uh, if we go into this new monetary system for instance
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:50.280]  Uh, that's the big big stick to control everyone's lives because you have government involved now with how you
[3:00:50.920 --> 3:00:54.440]  Accumulate money spend it on what and so on how you live
[3:00:54.840 --> 3:00:58.840]  That's all what's about how you live are you living the way you're supposed to
[3:00:59.240 --> 3:01:01.480]  Uh, according to the experts and so on
[3:01:02.040 --> 3:01:04.360]  So we can't allow it to get to that stage
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:08.600]  And we have to start taking to the streets and mass demonstrations
[3:01:08.600 --> 3:01:12.680]  It's all on a way to to start to bring public awareness to this
[3:01:13.160 --> 3:01:19.240]  And even people who scoff at it eventually become curious and approach the big groups that are marching
[3:01:19.720 --> 3:01:25.960]  And and ask the right questions. We can't sit back just chattering over the internet. It doesn't work that way
[3:01:26.440 --> 3:01:30.120]  Well, we're seeing coordinated inflation. They're saying they want to have three
[3:01:30.600 --> 3:01:36.120]  Global systems controlled by one groups. They can have coordinated inflation to destroy and enslave all of us
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:39.000]  I mean, they're so cold blood of these predatory banks
[3:01:40.040 --> 3:01:43.720]  Oh, they're they're very arrogant now because they really do see the end in sight
[3:01:44.440 --> 3:01:49.080]  Uh, they've said that they have through scientific means brought the public to this
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:55.240]  acceptance of being ruled by their betters their the elite the experts the scientists
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:01:58.040]  And uh, but they don't have all of us
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:01:59.560]  That's the key to it
[3:01:59.560 --> 3:02:03.800]  And it's the rest of us who must start making all as much noise as possible right now
[3:02:03.800 --> 3:02:10.360]  And seeing no to this. Well, let's take a kansas city cop or a noxville officer an austin police officer listening
[3:02:10.920 --> 3:02:13.240]  I mean, if they just go check what we're saying they're going to find out it's true
[3:02:13.240 --> 3:02:18.600]  Then what are you going to do? I mean, they're putting stuff in you and your children and your wife or your husband that are killing you
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:20.760]  And they are stating it
[3:02:21.160 --> 3:02:25.400]  I mean, this is I mean, why aren't you with us? Why do you defend the system?
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:28.760]  I mean, why don't you have enough respect for yourself?
[3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:35.640]  Yeah, and that's the key to it again. You see this money is odd thing called money. We've all been trained to go out and
[3:02:35.960 --> 3:02:37.960]  accumulate or earn
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:42.520]  Uh, it's the key to it. They love their paychecks. They love the status to get the love the power
[3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:47.720]  And they love the fraternity in a society for the bonds between people have been broken
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:52.360]  The need for the bonding is still there and the military and the police
[3:02:52.920 --> 3:02:57.240]  Supply that they give you they bring you into for they understand our mammalian needs
[3:02:57.240 --> 3:03:00.920]  And so they give us wicked counterfeits of our brotherhood of warriors
[3:03:01.160 --> 3:03:02.360]  That's correct
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:06.280]  And they are loyal to each other. They will fight to the death for each other
[3:03:06.920 --> 3:03:08.920]  against the public if need be
[3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:13.560]  Unfortunately while they're with the public being destroyed by the new world order. Yeah, that's correct
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:17.240]  See the useful idiots are always eliminated once their use is over
[3:03:17.720 --> 3:03:21.400]  And what to realize that through tectonatronic warfare and they're talking about it now
[3:03:21.480 --> 3:03:23.480]  They're putting up the polls across the planet
[3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:30.520]  I think some of them been mainstream news. Mm-hmm. And these tectonatronic weaponry that brisinski talks about and between two ages
[3:03:30.920 --> 3:03:35.800]  They are in use now people are getting headaches with them, but it's meant to literally put you into
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:40.680]  Um, a state of a non-think that was in the baltimore sun about four years ago
[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:43.580]  They admitted that darpa was quote testing in american cities
[3:03:44.280 --> 3:03:48.520]  Electronic systems to calm us and then publicly. Oh, we put out the skeeter system
[3:03:48.520 --> 3:03:54.680]  Ultra low frequency to drive crowds away on the streets. If your business doesn't want loiterers
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:04:00.040]  Yes, and I've got photographs of them being built. I've seen the cables that go into them. They're massive cables
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:04.440]  And there's the big tall gray battleship gray antennas. You know what stay there
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:08.280]  We you've got to go in three minutes, but for the prison planet on tv viewers right now
[3:04:08.280 --> 3:04:11.960]  We're going to continue with the final statement from alan on that and we'll come back with all the news. Stay with me
[3:04:14.840 --> 3:04:17.720]  Hey alan, I'm going to give you the last three minutes here, but I've got a tv crew
[3:04:17.720 --> 3:04:21.160]  I'm going to run out of the room. I trust you to take over for about two and a half minutes
[3:04:21.240 --> 3:04:23.160]  Talk about the technocratic
[3:04:23.160 --> 3:04:26.680]  Technotronic systems that are already in place. Yes
[3:04:28.680 --> 3:04:30.120]  Okay, the um
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:31.960]  the technotronic
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:34.920]  Equipment is as fast as a vast array of techniques
[3:04:34.920 --> 3:04:42.280]  They can use from microwave technology which they are using you can't walk through a city and not be exposed to it
[3:04:42.280 --> 3:04:48.440]  It's everywhere. They have really is everywhere. It also tracks the new ID cards that have chips in them and so on
[3:04:49.480 --> 3:04:55.800]  Very advanced equipment monitors all of this and puts all together and tracks you at every moment of your life
[3:04:56.360 --> 3:05:01.320]  But also it affects on the mind and they know that by altering the frequencies
[3:05:01.800 --> 3:05:08.120]  Of it from one level to another. They can either make you very calm or aggressive or depressed even
[3:05:08.120 --> 3:05:12.680]  Uh, they use harp technology as well a different frequency
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:17.480]  They can cover the entire planet with an array of harp institutes
[3:05:18.120 --> 3:05:22.760]  Or setups from alaska all through the world. They can still have the one in rega
[3:05:23.720 --> 3:05:29.080]  In the Baltics, they're all working in concert. But this new type they're putting up throughout the cities
[3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:35.160]  Is literally like a massive thick pole, maybe two feet three feet wide at the base
[3:05:35.160 --> 3:05:38.360]  It's um, it's a straight antenna
[3:05:38.920 --> 3:05:40.920]  at 30 40 feet high
[3:05:41.880 --> 3:05:51.160]  And these are meant to set up fields and within certain different distances and affect and control the minds of everyone within that quadrant
[3:05:51.800 --> 3:05:53.640]  They can cam you and that's the key to it
[3:05:53.640 --> 3:05:59.320]  They want everyone to be in an almost drugged cam state as they go through the biggest changes
[3:05:59.320 --> 3:06:05.640]  That the world has ever experienced and they'll do it camly without a thought. They're higher
[3:06:06.920 --> 3:06:12.120]  Survival mechanism will not be working at all. That's the purpose of them
[3:06:12.920 --> 3:06:16.520]  These have been well documented by top scientists
[3:06:16.920 --> 3:06:18.920]  The sebrazinski himself who worked
[3:06:19.480 --> 3:06:21.480]  alongside the nsa
[3:06:21.800 --> 3:06:27.240]  Um, talks about it as far back as the 70s. He said in the coming technotronic era
[3:06:27.240 --> 3:06:30.840]  He says the public will be have induced opinions
[3:06:30.840 --> 3:06:39.320]  They will be unable to really rationalize why they come to various opinions because they'll be downloaded into them through technotronic means

[3:07:35.160 --> 3:07:37.160]  alex jones
[3:07:37.720 --> 3:07:42.360]  Okay, we're gonna play a little clip here alan watt has left us a little clip about 10 minutes from press tv
[3:07:42.440 --> 3:07:45.720]  I was on there for about 50 minutes total on the hour long program
[3:07:45.720 --> 3:07:50.280]  Uh, this is a part two three four and five. It gets even more heated
[3:07:50.520 --> 3:07:54.200]  Where i'm breaking down what's really happening with the financial system. Here's part of part two
[3:07:54.200 --> 3:07:57.080]  We haven't aired yet. I'm gonna come back into the financial news
[3:07:57.560 --> 3:08:02.920]  Uh, and of course get into the electronic voting machines and what's happening in election 2008
[3:08:03.320 --> 3:08:09.480]  I'm gonna take a little bit of a little bit of a break here. We have russian international television russia today here as well
[3:08:09.880 --> 3:08:11.880]  in studio with us
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:14.280]  But here we go right now into
[3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:16.280]  press tv
[3:08:16.760 --> 3:08:19.000]  Leveraging with unlimited fractional reserve
[3:08:19.480 --> 3:08:26.840]  Uh banking and now they're posing as the saviors saying we need we need a global government run by the banks a global government
[3:08:27.720 --> 3:08:31.480]  alex jones if i may uh depart from you for a moment
[3:08:31.800 --> 3:08:36.040]  I want to engage the other panelists now addressing you moscow and until it would came now
[3:08:36.200 --> 3:08:42.680]  It's been well argued and documented that essentially the prices of oil price of petroleum has been
[3:08:42.680 --> 3:08:50.200]  Inherently wrongly valued and that's been due to the distortions caused by traders and that it has
[3:08:50.600 --> 3:08:57.560]  Little to do if not none with the amount of oil being produced or consumed now do subscribe to this notion
[3:08:59.480 --> 3:09:02.280]  Uh, first of all, I would like to say that there is
[3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:07.640]  There is world government and this world government is washington
[3:09:07.640 --> 3:09:15.640]  So you see that the biggest trade between two countries is china and the united states
[3:09:16.200 --> 3:09:20.200]  All petroleum in the world is sold in dollars
[3:09:21.160 --> 3:09:25.960]  And the united states can easily solve the problem. They use small paper
[3:09:26.760 --> 3:09:28.760]  They make several
[3:09:28.760 --> 3:09:38.840]  Movements and they produced a nice benjamin franklin 100 dollars per small piece of paper
[3:09:39.400 --> 3:09:46.680]  This is not fair. Okay, because uh before 1971 there was strict
[3:09:49.160 --> 3:09:51.160]  Deficiency
[3:09:51.080 --> 3:09:52.840]  and
[3:09:52.840 --> 3:09:54.840]  It was
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:10:00.600]  Dollars per oonsia of gold the gold and and dollar
[3:10:01.400 --> 3:10:02.680]  They were
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:07.960]  Together at that time, but since 1971 we have that they
[3:10:08.760 --> 3:10:11.640]  The oonsium of gold is coming to
[3:10:12.200 --> 3:10:14.200]  600 dollars
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:19.480]  And the dollar is losing position and nowadays we have a terrific
[3:10:19.480 --> 3:10:26.120]  Uh inflation now, let me let me let me get a quick reaction from our panelists on the phone line
[3:10:26.440 --> 3:10:30.600]  Now a dominic frisbee now. Why don't you throw in a challenge or a thought here?
[3:10:32.280 --> 3:10:34.280]  well
[3:10:34.360 --> 3:10:39.160]  Listen, I'm not a believer in conspiracy theories and and uh, um
[3:10:40.040 --> 3:10:43.020]  I don't want to dismiss. They're openly calling for world government by the banks
[3:10:44.760 --> 3:10:46.520]  Well
[3:10:46.520 --> 3:10:53.560]  Okay, it looks like it looks like i'm a believer in the in the notion that never as stride as as as
[3:10:54.120 --> 3:10:58.200]  Um malice that which can be explained as incompetent and i'm really
[3:10:59.080 --> 3:11:01.080]  Gordon brown isn't calling for a new world order
[3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:05.400]  Listen, if you just give me a moment
[3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:11.800]  Gordon brown if you think gordon brown would say that's a conspiracy theory. They're talking about where the government run by banks
[3:11:11.800 --> 3:11:17.720]  For goodness sake, will you stop at gordon brown if you have any no, you're the conspiracy theorist
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:21.160]  Well, you're the conspiracy theorist, but i'll go ahead
[3:11:22.680 --> 3:11:28.840]  If you think gordon brown is competent enough to manage a new world order and to put something like that into practice
[3:11:29.160 --> 3:11:31.160]  I'm afraid you have an unduly high
[3:11:32.200 --> 3:11:36.760]  He does not have the capability to do that. He's not clever enough nor is he organized enough
[3:11:36.760 --> 3:11:42.440]  Okay, austin alex, why don't you take over?
[3:11:45.560 --> 3:11:48.040]  Well, I mean i don't want to interrupt him. I want him to be able to make this point
[3:11:48.360 --> 3:11:54.920]  It's just i mean people are tired of these throwaway lines of o conspiracy theories the wall street journal the bbc
[3:11:55.560 --> 3:12:00.760]  Um, it was just on agency french press. I mean on info wars.com right now
[3:12:00.760 --> 3:12:07.240]  We have like 50 plus mainstream news articles the last week where they're calling for a global government
[3:12:07.240 --> 3:12:10.440]  They call it a new world order run by the world's private
[3:12:11.160 --> 3:12:17.640]  Central banks where a private group of banks will internationally set the price of all the currencies every day
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:19.960]  essentially
[3:12:21.160 --> 3:12:23.160]  Nicholas sarkozy
[3:12:24.920 --> 3:12:26.920]  I'll go ahead and you go ahead
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:34.200]  They may want to be calling for such a thing, but whether they're confident enough to be competent enough to organize it with any sense of
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:40.600]  Success is another matter and I can assure you as an englishman gordon brown is not competent enough to do that
[3:12:42.920 --> 3:12:46.920]  I'm not saying what he wants and i'm saying go it's if we're heading to the
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:52.200]  Alex we've seen the leaders like we might be it's as a result of events. It's not as a result
[3:12:52.200 --> 3:12:57.000]  Okay. Dominic if you're done there Alex make make your point very quickly. I want to go to musko
[3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:04.360]  Sure, sir. Look, I mean we've had all these presidents and prime ministers
[3:13:04.760 --> 3:13:11.240]  Calling for a new world order in a global currency all I do is hold up the associated presser of french news agency
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:18.440]  And they're calling for it. I mean they're on tv and all he says is conspiracy theory the global banks engineered this
[3:13:18.520 --> 3:13:20.520]  We have their own documents
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:27.320]  Uh, and and they're setting up a world collapse so they can come in as the saviors and rebuild it like they did post
[3:13:27.880 --> 3:13:29.880]  And knows
[3:13:31.240 --> 3:13:35.080]  And on russia and on china and alex on the note and uh dominic
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:41.560]  I want you to hold your thoughts on that trail now addressing you mr. Utkin and musko now. What do you know about this conspiracy?
[3:13:41.560 --> 3:13:48.920]  Oh in my opinion. I never believed in any conspiracy. It's objective. Uh
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:52.600]  Situation
[3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:56.120]  There is one billion of people average
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:04.840]  35,000 american dollars per capita a year and plus five billion
[3:14:04.840 --> 3:14:09.720]  And inhabitants of this planet who are getting
[3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:15.160]  Around one thousand a year. So this is terrific
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:19.080]  You know
[3:14:19.320 --> 3:14:21.720]  In convenience, there is a terrible
[3:14:23.880 --> 3:14:30.280]  Non-existence of justice. This is uh, uh, what's making this world so explosive
[3:14:30.280 --> 3:14:37.560]  And I would say I'm not trying to say that it's a conspiracy from white house or anywhere
[3:14:37.880 --> 3:14:39.320]  Okay, okay
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:44.360]  You I think you made your point. Uh, mr. Utkin. I want to address you dominic now dominic now
[3:14:44.680 --> 3:14:50.040]  Uh, well, clearly, uh, the state of affairs is rather topsy turvy as described
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:58.200]  But while we're in it in this state of confusion, if not panic now, uh, the world economy is suffering and the world governments are
[3:14:58.200 --> 3:15:03.640]  Uh stepping up efforts to rescue it with certain packages. Now the u.s. Has taken
[3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:05.080]  needed measures
[3:15:05.080 --> 3:15:11.720]  But the measures taken by the european union seem to be suffering from a lack of unity if not harmony. Now, what's the reason there?
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:18.440]  Um, before I answer that question jupy, if I could just finish off on the last subject very quickly
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:22.440]  With the american gentleman that we are facing a global economic collapse
[3:15:22.440 --> 3:15:29.480]  But this global economic collapse is because there's too much speculation too much debt and too much leverage in the system
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:32.200]  It hasn't been engineered by central banks
[3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:37.720]  But it has been caused by central banks because they put interest rates at artificially low levels
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:41.000]  Causing businesses and borrowers to take on too much debt
[3:15:41.400 --> 3:15:45.960]  It is a result of central bank incompetence not central bank engineering
[3:15:46.440 --> 3:15:50.280]  All right. Well, can I counter go ahead Austin go ahead? Look look
[3:15:50.280 --> 3:15:55.080]  Sure regardless of whether they designed it. He is right
[3:15:55.240 --> 3:16:01.160]  They certainly are behind it and now they're posing as saviors and they're having secret meetings here in the united states
[3:16:01.160 --> 3:16:04.680]  That's on our news where they get hundreds of billions of dollars to companies
[3:16:04.920 --> 3:16:09.800]  Which they previously have worked for government officials and then it's secret what they're going to do with the money
[3:16:10.200 --> 3:16:17.480]  They are taking all this new liquidity and giving it to these international organizations. That's where all of the quote rescue money
[3:16:17.480 --> 3:16:22.520]  Is going it's not going to the american people or the british people or the people of
[3:16:23.080 --> 3:16:23.880]  Germany now
[3:16:23.880 --> 3:16:28.840]  I know in some of the european plans actually some of it is going to the people and they pledged 2.2 trillion
[3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:32.920]  Last week but but but the lion's share of that is going to the very
[3:16:33.400 --> 3:16:38.520]  Private central banks and brokerage firms that engineered this and they're saying out of the crisis
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:44.440]  Give us unlimited global government power over the world banking system. I mean they cause the crisis
[3:16:44.440 --> 3:16:48.840]  They offer the solution so regardless they need to be in serious trouble
[3:16:49.160 --> 3:16:55.240]  congressman ron paul and others on my radio show have called for the current fed chairman vimbernacky to be arrested
[3:16:55.560 --> 3:17:01.560]  They've listed reasons why they have called for paulson to be arrested total insider trading
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:04.200]  Absolutely, you know on its face
[3:17:04.920 --> 3:17:10.120]  Hiring the former vice vice president of goldman sacks to secretly hand out the money part of it
[3:17:10.120 --> 3:17:15.320]  To goldman sacks. I mean we need to bring these people to justice for what they've done
[3:17:15.640 --> 3:17:20.520]  We don't need to be giving them more power and then two weeks ago. I had two members of congress on
[3:17:20.920 --> 3:17:26.520]  This was on c-span on national news. They were threatened with martial law by the bush white house
[3:17:27.160 --> 3:17:30.520]  If they didn't pass that banker immunity banker takeover bill
[3:17:30.680 --> 3:17:36.280]  So we're having a financial dictatorship being set up and that's not just me saying that so we're in very strange
[3:17:36.280 --> 3:17:42.680]  All right, that's just part of part two. There's part three four and five up on info wars dot com
[3:17:43.080 --> 3:17:47.480]  And prison planet dot com and russian tv's here covering this live right now
[3:17:47.800 --> 3:17:52.120]  I'm going to be speaking to them afterwards. They're making a documentary and I'm going to be live on russian tv
[3:17:52.680 --> 3:17:56.120]  For several hours on election day and that isn't just in russia
[3:17:56.120 --> 3:18:01.720]  It's on in japan in england in germany in france in africa in latin america
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:08.040]  It's on most basic cable systems and satellite systems worldwide. So we are certainly getting the word out in a big way
[3:18:08.600 --> 3:18:13.400]  And and listen, I don't talk about this being my exploits, but our job is to be successful
[3:18:13.880 --> 3:18:15.880]  Getting the word out against the new world order
[3:18:16.760 --> 3:18:18.760]  That's what we're doing here
[3:18:18.840 --> 3:18:22.440]  And uh, I would just invite other patrons and people to come in for the big win here
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:26.360]  And we should all be happy uh that people are finally listening to us
[3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:28.360]  We shouldn't be happy that the new world order is
[3:18:28.360 --> 3:18:33.000]  Carrying out the exact criminal operations. We said they would but people are listening to us right now
[3:18:33.400 --> 3:18:36.840]  And i'm proud of the success we've had against the new world order
[3:18:37.320 --> 3:18:39.800]  And that's why I work really seven days a week
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:44.280]  In this fight and I do it because I understand we have no future
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:46.920]  Uh, if we don't resist these people and I know that
[3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:49.960]  They can be defeated
[3:18:49.960 --> 3:18:53.080]  I know the new world order can be stopped

[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:41.080]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door
[3:19:41.560 --> 3:19:46.440]  Seven years after the attacks of september 11 a global awakening is taking place

[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:20.840]  Louise in boston you're on the air welcome
[3:24:21.480 --> 3:24:24.840]  Hey, Alex. I haven't talked to you for a while last time I was on a
[3:24:25.400 --> 3:24:31.880]  I sounded like a crazy woman some kid was pulling on my leg. You had to go away. So i'm gonna apologize now in case I get
[3:24:32.680 --> 3:24:36.280]  Some kids yanking on me before I can finish the call. That's okay. Go ahead
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:43.640]  Um, well since we last talked I uh, I've been featuring all your documentaries on a cable show that I started back in May
[3:24:44.520 --> 3:24:50.600]  And I've been playing movies of yours over at the library and the following at the library hasn't been so good
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:53.560]  But I'm starting to get a little following on the cable show
[3:24:54.200 --> 3:24:58.040]  Late at night and I'm in the process of starting a uh talk show
[3:24:58.760 --> 3:25:03.880]  Where I'm I'm not going to talk. I'm just going to take clips and kind of like do a report
[3:25:03.880 --> 3:25:10.920]  Uh of the events that are going on and take snips from your show and play it for the public and it's going to be through the local cable
[3:25:11.640 --> 3:25:12.680]  radio station
[3:25:12.680 --> 3:25:18.040]  So I wanted to know that um, that's been going for let me break down the briefly the power of that
[3:25:19.160 --> 3:25:21.160]  Everybody I know says yeah at public school
[3:25:21.160 --> 3:25:27.160]  They're sitting in federal reserve representatives and bank representatives to tell them how good the bailout is and how good the banks are
[3:25:27.160 --> 3:25:29.960]  And the crisis that's coming the banks are going to help you
[3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:33.960]  I mean they understand talking to crowds of 10 20 30 children are important
[3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:37.880]  Well, I mean your show is I guarantee you how big's the town you're in
[3:25:38.600 --> 3:25:44.040]  It's about um, I don't know between five and eight thousand people and then I would imagine what half of them have a local cable
[3:25:44.680 --> 3:25:51.400]  Um, everybody's got a cable connection either files or a comcast and then sometimes it broadcasts out to the surrounding town
[3:25:51.400 --> 3:25:56.760]  Let's just say let's just say that there's a hundred people watching every time it's on that's a hundred people
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:02.200]  You're reaching out to and getting to think the enemies out there programming everybody to go along with what they're doing
[3:26:02.440 --> 3:26:08.040]  We're there telling the truth. So what you're doing is just immeasurable. I don't care if you have an internet radio show with 10 listeners
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:11.000]  I don't care if you have a cable access show with a thousand viewers
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:13.240]  Or if you have a little local newsletter
[3:26:13.240 --> 3:26:19.720]  All of it together moves mountains and it's so important. It's the information that's key. Go ahead
[3:26:20.200 --> 3:26:23.160]  Well, what I've been doing in addition to that is I go out to the local
[3:26:23.160 --> 3:26:28.440]  Pizzerias and cafe shops and I put up a posting of the time of the show
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:31.720]  What's broadcasting and the channel and I do it?
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:37.480]  I rotate it every couple of weeks so that everybody knows what's going on and people talk to me and say I can't believe
[3:26:38.040 --> 3:26:40.680]  what I saw on your show the other night and
[3:26:41.160 --> 3:26:46.280]  You know, it's it's actually waking up people and I talk to strangers people
[3:26:46.760 --> 3:26:49.880]  I mean and it's not because they see my show. I'll be in other locations
[3:26:50.520 --> 3:26:52.520]  and somebody will say something about
[3:26:52.520 --> 3:26:59.960]  Um, you know how they they can't stand the fact that we have done this bailout or you know, it's exponential
[3:27:00.040 --> 3:27:03.320]  It's fertile ground to wake people up. That's why they're moving
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:08.360]  I've got a stack of news with it regulating shutting down controlling the web 100 different ways
[3:27:08.520 --> 3:27:12.280]  It's now happening. We've got to use it while we still got it
[3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:14.760]  it is working because
[3:27:15.240 --> 3:27:19.960]  It's it's more people are willing to talk than ever before about this topic
[3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:25.240]  And before like five years ago if I had said something to the effect of
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:28.200]  Uh, you know new world order or whatever
[3:27:28.840 --> 3:27:31.080]  They'd look at you like you had two heads, but now
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:35.080]  People are thinking about it. They're that's right. I mean, I'm not against sports
[3:27:35.160 --> 3:27:37.720]  But she'll be at a restaurant people walk by and ask you about sports
[3:27:38.200 --> 3:27:40.680]  All day, you know that we're supposed to only interact on sports
[3:27:40.760 --> 3:27:45.160]  Now we should be interacting about the corrupt system. We have running things. You got about a minute left
[3:27:45.160 --> 3:27:46.680]  What else you want to add one?
[3:27:46.680 --> 3:27:50.840]  One other thing is I have a an international figure coming to the town
[3:27:52.040 --> 3:27:56.600]  Uh, he he goes by the name of amir. He's from israel and he gives inside his his
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:28:04.600]  Quote-unquote inside information about the events that are unfolding and from the israel and from the israeli perspective of things
[3:28:05.000 --> 3:28:06.280]  and how um
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:10.440]  Last time he was here. He's talked about 9 11 and how those events unfold now
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:12.280]  I don't know that he believes
[3:28:12.280 --> 3:28:17.880]  9 11 is an inside job or anything, but reason I'm bringing this up is I intend to videotape the uh
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:22.840]  To speak, you know his engagement when he comes to speak in in this particular town
[3:28:23.400 --> 3:28:27.960]  And I wanted to get an idea of what kind of questions to bring to him if you have any suggestions
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:34.840]  I would ask him why israel and haraach and jerusalem post admits they stage terror attacks fake al-qaeda attacks
[3:28:35.320 --> 3:28:41.240]  And that if he understands that israeli intelligence can is controlled just like us and british by the new world order
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:46.280]  Uh, and uh, so I would basically bring those type of issues up keep it up
[3:28:46.600 --> 3:28:51.080]  You're doing a great job. Appreciate your call more calls straight ahead after this quick break

[3:33:19.320 --> 3:33:27.160]  And it also has a viral spread of the aggressiveness but in a nice way going out and confronting them getting involved fighting back saying no
[3:33:27.720 --> 3:33:29.720]  It's scaring the system
[3:33:29.720 --> 3:33:34.040]  And so I want to commend all of those that engage in guerrilla information warfare
[3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:38.200]  Let's rampage through your calls because I want to play some of these clips david gurghan and bob bear
[3:33:38.600 --> 3:33:44.360]  Uh, let's talk to david in wisconsin. You're on the air david. Welcome. Yeah, alex. I have a comment and a question
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:49.960]  The comment is it's a little scary to hear those people on tough tv how ignorant they are
[3:33:50.280 --> 3:33:55.000]  You know that but you did begin to change them as as you talk more and more they
[3:33:55.000 --> 3:34:02.040]  Especially by the way, it sounded like I was interrupting people there. The iranians kept saying pop in go ahead say something
[3:34:02.360 --> 3:34:05.560]  I mean, I had the producers they were telling me what fans they were during the breaks
[3:34:05.880 --> 3:34:09.320]  Same thing with russian tv. They're saying the boss of the network's like a huge fan
[3:34:09.800 --> 3:34:14.520]  It's blowing me away man. How big this show's gotten worldwide on and again. I'm not bragging about me
[3:34:14.840 --> 3:34:16.840]  I'm giving folks the good news
[3:34:16.920 --> 3:34:23.080]  That just this show alone not to mention all the other great people and groups that are breaking through is breaking through internationally
[3:34:23.080 --> 3:34:25.960]  But go ahead. Oh, yeah, and then the question was
[3:34:26.600 --> 3:34:32.280]  Um, I noticed oil going down and you had a guest a pastor. Lindsey williams were getting back on
[3:34:32.840 --> 3:34:39.560]  Oh, yeah, now. What did he say? Would you enlighten the audience on what the way before I forget go go tell distrails
[3:34:40.040 --> 3:34:42.040]  out tomorrow
[3:34:42.600 --> 3:34:45.080]  Will you go tell try to set up williams for this week sometime
[3:34:46.360 --> 3:34:50.360]  Before I forget lindsay williams. I keep forgetting to tell him that I think I did and he hadn't gone around to it
[3:34:50.360 --> 3:34:53.800]  By the way, will now since on first hour wednesday. That's what it's scheduled for right now
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:56.280]  I have a big guess tomorrow, but but um, I mean
[3:34:57.560 --> 3:35:02.360]  Articles were written at info wars and prison planted about lindsay williams. What specifically you want me to recap?
[3:35:02.520 --> 3:35:07.800]  I was so excited that he said they were going to drive the oil price down to 50 dollars a barrel
[3:35:08.040 --> 3:35:14.440]  And that was going to do something and he said he said in just the next few months and there it was at 148 dollars a barrel and
[3:35:15.000 --> 3:35:17.880]  I mean, he's got real oil company executive connections
[3:35:17.880 --> 3:35:20.440]  He really did work for him. Everything he said has come through
[3:35:20.440 --> 3:35:25.560]  But he said it was because giant oil fields were going to be discovered in russia and in asia
[3:35:26.280 --> 3:35:28.280]  Predominantly off the coast of indonesia
[3:35:29.240 --> 3:35:34.600]  And I haven't really seen that happen. I saw an indonesian field a small one discovered the big thing is
[3:35:35.800 --> 3:35:37.480]  Alex I was really
[3:35:37.480 --> 3:35:44.280]  Getting to was how does driving the price of oil down to 50 dollars a barrel ruin our economy or
[3:35:44.280 --> 3:35:48.760]  And or the arab economy look look look it's a very complex issue
[3:35:48.760 --> 3:35:50.840]  And I appreciate your call because I want to time go over the calls
[3:35:50.840 --> 3:35:54.920]  I don't cut you off. I could talk to you for 10 hours. You're a great caller. It's a great catch 22 there
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:35:57.800]  But if I'm going to answer the question, I will
[3:35:58.360 --> 3:36:01.800]  they the the the social engineers created the
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:06.760]  Housing bubble to artificially get people to be enticed in a deeper debt
[3:36:07.160 --> 3:36:11.560]  To have a hundred thousand dollar house get up to five hundred thousand dollars on average in the last 10 years
[3:36:11.560 --> 3:36:17.560]  Uh to have a million dollar house be, you know 10 million dollars have a 500 thousand dollar house be two million dollars
[3:36:18.040 --> 3:36:19.720]  I mean here in austin
[3:36:19.720 --> 3:36:23.320]  five six seven years ago you you can buy a nice four bedroom house
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:26.200]  uh for
[3:36:26.200 --> 3:36:29.640]  200 grand or cheaper depending on the area maybe 150
[3:36:30.840 --> 3:36:33.800]  Now a four bedroom in just a decent neighborhood
[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:36.520]  Got up to about 700 000
[3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:38.920]  okay
[3:36:38.920 --> 3:36:42.680]  I mean efficiency apartments were like 600 bucks a piece
[3:36:43.640 --> 3:36:45.640]  okay, um
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:50.440]  A decent apartment like two grand. I mean I don't know how people afford this stuff
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:52.680]  so
[3:36:52.680 --> 3:36:54.680]  They then popped
[3:36:55.160 --> 3:36:57.160]  That bubble
[3:36:57.160 --> 3:37:07.880]  The same thing with oil 30 percent of its increase roughly according to the economists we've had on was speculation
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:11.800]  And the rest of that was dollar devaluation
[3:37:14.600 --> 3:37:16.600]  But you've seen the dollar that plunged
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:25.720]  Uh, they they claim it's climbed. That's not true other world currencies as we said once the true recessionary system started into a depressionary
[3:37:25.720 --> 3:37:31.880]  Collision within the real economy. There's going to be less oil less fuel used
[3:37:32.520 --> 3:37:38.360]  People are going to pull their money the general public and and and mid-level investors out of speculative
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:43.400]  Uh operations in the stock market. So the speculation money's left oil
[3:37:44.760 --> 3:37:46.760]  And the dollar
[3:37:46.920 --> 3:37:51.400]  Has not strengthened other currencies plunged as we kept saying the more it plunges
[3:37:51.400 --> 3:37:55.160]  It's going to drag other currencies down the pound the euro the yen the yon
[3:37:56.840 --> 3:38:01.720]  The dnr. I mean all of them have plunged the the russian currency as well the ruble
[3:38:03.800 --> 3:38:10.120]  And so worldwide you have a depression in the real economy because people and institutions don't have money
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:15.720]  And then overlaying that you have all this liquidity the only liquidity being pumped into the few private
[3:38:16.360 --> 3:38:18.360]  central banks so
[3:38:18.360 --> 3:38:25.080]  That's the real reason also, uh, the oil companies were profit-taking because they knew with all this new deep drilling
[3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:30.840]  Technology that Cheshire peak and hundreds of other big oil companies have come up with and that is by old companies
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:32.840]  I mean exploration companies
[3:38:32.840 --> 3:38:35.880]  Not the big larger consortiums like Exxon mobile and
[3:38:36.840 --> 3:38:38.840]  BP and
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:42.040]  Shell and others
[3:38:42.040 --> 3:38:47.480]  Very complex issues how it all interconnects in i'm trying to be simplistic here
[3:38:48.920 --> 3:38:51.080]  But they are just discovering oil and gas everywhere
[3:38:51.080 --> 3:38:54.280]  I mean you ought to see texas from north of dallas all the way down to houston
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:39:01.320]  All the way down i45 and then 20 30 miles on each side there there's gas wells in some cases every 200 yards
[3:39:02.040 --> 3:39:08.280]  I mean they're just because now they're going 15 20 000 feet and i mean they're hitting levels of gas levels of oil
[3:39:08.680 --> 3:39:10.680]  I mean it comes out at
[3:39:10.680 --> 3:39:13.640]  The millions of cubic feet of gas a day
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:20.280]  I mean you got people that own 20 30 acres who are you know making a million dollars a day with their 20% off gas
[3:39:20.920 --> 3:39:22.920]  I mean it's just like
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:25.720]  I mean the oil the oil fields the gas fields
[3:39:26.120 --> 3:39:28.840]  Before they could they don't they would only drill a few thousand feet
[3:39:29.320 --> 3:39:33.000]  Well now they're drilling 10 15 20 25 30 000 40 000 feet
[3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:36.280]  And the truth is the earth is just
[3:39:36.280 --> 3:39:40.040]  The tectonic plates are floating on seas of oil and gas
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:44.120]  And uh whereas there is some
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:52.120]  Fossil fuels they do find ferns and you know shark teeth and dinosaur bones in coal deposits
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:55.640]  They do find petrified forests where it's just solid coal
[3:39:56.680 --> 3:39:59.800]  A lot of lignite a lot of that in texas all over the world
[3:40:00.520 --> 3:40:02.520]  There's lignite mines everywhere
[3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:05.640]  but
[3:40:05.640 --> 3:40:08.920]  When they go deeper with the coal and oil and gas it's not animal
[3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:13.480]  It is some type of process with the magma in the mantle
[3:40:14.280 --> 3:40:16.520]  And the core interacting with the crust
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:21.800]  And it just we're floating on oil. There's so much oil. It's insane. I mean
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:29.560]  That's why they want global government and environmentalism to regulate who can drill who can have what it's to keep the oil company safe and keep us
[3:40:29.560 --> 3:40:37.720]  Through a new neo serfdom and feudalism to suppress new technologies all the big government funding for renewable resources and renewable technologies and clean technologies
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:42.840]  Is to fund the direction it goes in a controlled system that doesn't let us have the real technologies
[3:40:44.440 --> 3:40:46.440]  And folks that's coming from somebody whose
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:48.840]  family
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:51.960]  Is in every part of the oil business
[3:40:52.600 --> 3:40:59.000]  I mean in texas. That's what's down here from rough necks to people that work at the plants to petroleum geologists
[3:40:59.000 --> 3:41:01.000]  And I just grown up around this
[3:41:01.000 --> 3:41:06.680]  And uh, you know to see him on the news say there's no more oil. It's running out. That's just ridiculous. Just saying look at the polar bears
[3:41:06.840 --> 3:41:08.840]  They're going to drown
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  And they're the best swimmers of any land animal
[3:41:12.680 --> 3:41:14.680]  When they hot on the ice flows
[3:41:15.640 --> 3:41:18.760]  All right now i'm really out of control. I got a lot of clips and a lot of calls to get to
[3:41:19.640 --> 3:41:21.640]  Gerard in florida. You're on the air welcome
[3:41:23.560 --> 3:41:27.880]  It looks like he dropped off he just dropped off as I went to him. Well gerard. It's not your lucky day
[3:41:27.880 --> 3:41:31.160]  I'm sorry. I wanted to talk to you. Roy in ohio. You're on the air
[3:41:32.040 --> 3:41:34.040]  loyal shortwave
[3:41:34.040 --> 3:41:40.040]  Listener for years, but lately all the other programming comes through except yours
[3:41:41.320 --> 3:41:43.160]  Very bad
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:46.360]  Yeah, well, we did we need to talk to wwcr get a better frequency
[3:41:46.840 --> 3:41:51.880]  I remember years ago being on two different shortwave stations wwcr and another one
[3:41:51.880 --> 3:41:57.160]  And wherever we would move they would move voice of america to ride on to the band over us
[3:41:57.800 --> 3:42:02.520]  And then like the and I have family that are you know ham radio operators and they're not the types to say
[3:42:02.840 --> 3:42:06.600]  You know a phone system goes down as the government or you know, our computers go down
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:08.680]  It's you know, most of the time it's not the government
[3:42:08.680 --> 3:42:10.680]  Uh, one time we did catch him doing something
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:13.000]  uh, but uh
[3:42:13.160 --> 3:42:19.000]  The point is is that most of the time it isn't but but no, I mean there has clearly been jamming and clearly been problems
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:21.720]  Uh with the radio show. I mean, what are you hearing?
[3:42:23.720 --> 3:42:26.360]  It's uh very staticky and very weak
[3:42:27.080 --> 3:42:34.440]  What frequency are you listening on 12.160 and 5.0 70 which are the two premium channels to be on
[3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:41.640]  Yes, and all the other programming comes in clearly. No other people record it for me and people have done youtube videos with their shortwave
[3:42:42.280 --> 3:42:45.000]  You know in their house and and the shortwave is totally clear
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:50.040]  And and then it's like am radio and then the show ends and mine starts it goes
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:54.200]  Or
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:57.480]  You can barely hear me there. I mean there's youtube videos that show that there
[3:42:57.480 --> 3:43:00.760]  I've seen them from australia, canada, england. They'll go look at this
[3:43:00.840 --> 3:43:05.000]  I've got the I've got the shortwave the show is going to begin watch this and we've done our own test
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:07.960]  It does it now. It's kind of a slash scottish
[3:43:08.840 --> 3:43:10.760]  Slash iris accept to get it right
[3:43:10.760 --> 3:43:15.960]  But I mean they'll be you know going or like crikey watch this in australia. Look. He's the show sounds good
[3:43:16.200 --> 3:43:19.720]  All right. Alex is coming on in just a minute. Watch this. I'm not touching it
[3:43:20.280 --> 3:43:22.280]  And all of a sudden it goes to me and
[3:43:22.760 --> 3:43:27.480]  wwcr worldwide christian broadcasting and now the alex joneshow done done
[3:43:31.400 --> 3:43:34.200]  What do you think's going on brother? Oh, I don't know
[3:43:34.920 --> 3:43:36.920]  But is that what you're hearing the show will be clear and then
[3:43:37.800 --> 3:43:39.800]  Exactly. I mean to the minute
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:41.800]  To the minute
[3:43:41.880 --> 3:43:44.360]  Well, I'm sure they go for the last two months
[3:43:45.640 --> 3:43:47.000]  I know it's been getting really bad
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:51.080]  There's you know, I meant to play some of those youtube videos or post them on the site
[3:43:51.160 --> 3:43:53.560]  Like I sent one to kurti may have posted. I may have missed it
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:43:56.200]  Uh, I forget the headline. I've seen a bunch of them
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:44:00.760]  But but everybody should do this get your shortwaves out if you got youtube aim your camera
[3:44:01.720 --> 3:44:07.400]  And then you know have the show five minutes before and then show how my show starts within one minute to two minutes
[3:44:07.400 --> 3:44:10.600]  It just goes ladies and gentlemen big show lined up for it
[3:44:12.440 --> 3:44:17.560]  Yeah, that's my experience over and over but don't get discouraged keep up the good work alex
[3:44:17.720 --> 3:44:21.480]  Well, you know, I get excited by that because that means that they are scared to death of this show
[3:44:23.160 --> 3:44:25.160]  A lot of people waking up
[3:44:26.040 --> 3:44:33.160]  Uh, I live in ohio. We got an attorney general that's rigged the election here. Oh, yeah, even people got a prison there for it
[3:44:33.160 --> 3:44:35.160]  Okay
[3:44:37.800 --> 3:44:39.480]  Hey, I appreciate your call
[3:44:39.480 --> 3:44:43.640]  That's why our am and fm's are the most precious affiliates support their sponsors tell everybody about it
[3:44:43.720 --> 3:44:48.520]  If you're listening to me on an am or fm station close to 70 now, we just got four more in the last few weeks
[3:44:49.320 --> 3:44:53.960]  And by the way, john, I'll say it on air. They say they sent me all these liners from the network for these stations
[3:44:53.960 --> 3:44:55.800]  They're starting to get mad
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:45:00.200]  Aaron can't find them in his box. Will you get with the affiliate guys get all of them bundled together?
[3:45:00.200 --> 3:45:04.760]  And I will cut those suckers today or tomorrow because I got the network calling me on one hand
[3:45:04.760 --> 3:45:08.360]  Say cut these liners and we can't find them and Aaron's out there. He's a smart guy
[3:45:10.120 --> 3:45:14.280]  John, will you right? Well, will you wrangle up the affiliate guys and just get it all in one email to Aaron?
[3:45:14.920 --> 3:45:16.760]  Sure. I'll resend that
[3:45:16.760 --> 3:45:17.880]  Maybe our
[3:45:17.880 --> 3:45:21.000]  Spam blockers block blockings. I know you do what you say you're doing
[3:45:21.720 --> 3:45:26.280]  Go back to your email you find them and then send them and we'll do a test there and see if I'm getting them. Okay
[3:45:26.280 --> 3:45:29.480]  No rest for us around here. Um
[3:45:32.040 --> 3:45:34.280]  Jason in the uk go ahead sir. You're on the air
[3:45:35.240 --> 3:45:37.240]  Hey, man, how you doing? Good
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:39.560]  all right, um
[3:45:39.560 --> 3:45:46.360]  I was wondering, um, do you remember a few months back when it was uh, it was a bomber hillary and
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:48.040]  Richardson
[3:45:48.040 --> 3:45:52.120]  They were all singing a national anthem and the bomb was the only one he didn't have his hand on his heart
[3:45:52.120 --> 3:45:53.320]  Yeah, he wouldn't put his hand on his heart
[3:45:53.320 --> 3:45:57.960]  That was a signal to the globalist that he's anti-american and they said that's it triple his money
[3:45:58.680 --> 3:46:02.120]  Well, I would think okay. Well, have you read uh, we know you must have read it
[3:46:02.120 --> 3:46:08.760]  But if you read a text Mars's book, Codex Magica, he talks about how hand on heart is a Masonic symbol
[3:46:09.640 --> 3:46:10.920]  Yes
[3:46:10.920 --> 3:46:12.440]  Well, I mean
[3:46:12.440 --> 3:46:17.800]  Doesn't the fact that Obama isn't doing that to be specific the hand on the heart like when I see somebody being violated
[3:46:17.800 --> 3:46:19.800]  Or a woman being tortured by the police on video
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:24.840]  My heart burns. We'd like a desire to help them as a normal mammalian instinct
[3:46:25.400 --> 3:46:29.160]  And so I've been driving on the road before thinking about people I love and I literally
[3:46:29.720 --> 3:46:35.640]  Is it feels good? You know, I literally oh, you know, I think of my children my wife my parents my grandmother
[3:46:35.720 --> 3:46:37.000]  I'll just oh
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:40.840]  Oh, I feel the love so the enemy always appropriates all our symbols
[3:46:40.920 --> 3:46:45.080]  This is the lion's paw for a particular degree showing people on tv
[3:46:45.080 --> 3:46:52.840]  This is what pat robertson others do on tv. The lion's paw is a particular degree. Forget which one at the 12th or 14th
[3:46:53.880 --> 3:46:56.280]  Do you know which one it is? Which degree is the lion's paw?
[3:46:58.280 --> 3:47:00.120]  I forget I got to pull the book out
[3:47:00.120 --> 3:47:04.440]  Point is they've got the lion's paw. So they do the fingers like that it is but anything else
[3:47:05.640 --> 3:47:08.200]  Okay, well, I'm not sure if I agree with you there because I mean
[3:47:08.680 --> 3:47:11.640]  What so if the bomber is signaling that he's anti-american?
[3:47:11.640 --> 3:47:16.920]  You're trying to tell me that hillary and british in a program. No, I'm not saying that. I'm no. I'm not I'm not
[3:47:17.400 --> 3:47:20.600]  Look, don't worry. You'll probably get a bomber. He'll save us. I mean everything's fine
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:25.240]  I'm not I'm not for a bomber. Actually, it's quite interesting how we are changed
[3:47:25.560 --> 3:47:28.760]  They confronted a bomber in the federal reserve and he just goes well, you know
[3:47:28.760 --> 3:47:30.760]  If we have a strong economy, we have a strong dollar
[3:47:31.320 --> 3:47:34.200]  You just completely ignore the fact that it's just backed by paper say
[3:47:34.920 --> 3:47:36.200]  Yes, sir
[3:47:36.200 --> 3:47:38.520]  It's pretty amazing. Actually, can I just say one last thing? Yeah
[3:47:38.520 --> 3:47:42.200]  I'm sure one two things but um google CEO
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:48.040]  Eric Schmidt, he's recently said that he expects this to be a carbon tax. So I thought I just throw that out
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:53.160]  Well, yeah, I mean that's in our bill was to start assessments for carbon taxes in the new irs code
[3:47:53.400 --> 3:47:56.760]  In the banker takeover bill known as the bailout and it's in the european ones
[3:47:56.840 --> 3:48:01.480]  I mean, obama said he's gonna do it. So is mccain. I appreciate your call. I mean, we're in deep trouble
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:03.240]  I want to start now
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:07.320]  With uh great calls by the way. I want to start now with this is david gergen
[3:48:07.320 --> 3:48:10.840]  It's like 15 minutes of it total. It's up on info wars.com right now, but
[3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:15.880]  From we are changing Ohio, but this is david gergen the alumnus the carl robe of five administrations
[3:48:16.040 --> 3:48:19.000]  I said four in a film order of death. It's really five administrations
[3:48:19.560 --> 3:48:22.120]  Uh and uh getting upset. Here it is
[3:48:23.080 --> 3:48:25.080]  And you would not run around naked
[3:48:25.080 --> 3:48:28.760]  That's annual bohemian broke encampment and assisting each other
[3:48:36.200 --> 3:48:38.200]  Yes, this is actually the first
[3:48:38.680 --> 3:48:40.680]  I don't have a direct quote
[3:48:40.760 --> 3:48:41.960]  Um
[3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:43.960]  Gergen quits bohemian club
[3:48:43.960 --> 3:49:00.600]  Uh, I don't know where that came from. There's no direct call. And I just said yeah, I did resign from the club when I went to the club last year
[3:49:01.400 --> 3:49:03.400]  Uh, but that wasn't a question
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:08.520]  Okay, now I'm assuming this is correct that you also resigned from these other 17 organizations
[3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:14.440]  Or is that a time for a long time for us to get up there and do the orientation of another type of administration?
[3:49:14.440 --> 3:49:17.960]  Okay, if you're interested, I know I'm not going to go into the first year
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:19.960]  But that's a good idea
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:24.760]  Maybe to film what's going on there. Um, we're just journalists
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:26.760]  Is this a film or a movie?
[3:49:26.760 --> 3:49:28.760]  No, I'm just talking about
[3:49:28.760 --> 3:49:32.760]  I've never been to a film or a film for the first place. I've never been to a film
[3:49:32.760 --> 3:49:34.760]  I've never been to a film or a movie
[3:49:34.760 --> 3:49:36.760]  I've never been to a film
[3:49:36.760 --> 3:49:38.760]  I've never been to a film or a film
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:40.760]  I've never been to a film or a film
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:42.760]  Oh, you didn't notice the camera?
[3:49:42.760 --> 3:49:44.760]  Of course I didn't
[3:49:44.760 --> 3:49:46.760]  Any more questions?
[3:49:46.760 --> 3:49:48.760]  We're going to ask another question
[3:49:48.760 --> 3:49:50.760]  Okay
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:52.760]  Okay
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:54.760]  My bad, I thought you noticed
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:49:56.760]  I was just going to thank you for answering this question, that's all
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:49:58.760]  Just know
[3:49:58.760 --> 3:50:00.760]  I've been ambushed before
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:02.760]  We weren't trying to act though
[3:50:02.760 --> 3:50:04.760]  You can do whatever you want
[3:50:04.760 --> 3:50:06.760]  You can do whatever you want
[3:50:06.760 --> 3:50:08.760]  But it's not professional
[3:50:08.760 --> 3:50:10.760]  All right, hold on, we're going to come back and play the rest of this
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:12.760]  This is the Bob Barrow one
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:14.760]  Just the key clip where he talks about
[3:50:14.760 --> 3:50:16.760]  The insider trading
[3:50:16.760 --> 3:50:20.760]  Hey John, you want to cut audio and cut
[3:50:20.760 --> 3:50:22.760]  Okay
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:24.760]  Okay
[3:50:24.760 --> 3:50:26.760]  Am I right?
[3:50:26.760 --> 3:50:28.760]  Yeah, I'm just going to keep going live here on
[3:50:28.760 --> 3:50:30.760]  The AM and FM dial for those carrying it
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:32.760]  And on the internet during this break
[3:50:32.760 --> 3:50:34.760]  Just total transparency
[3:50:34.760 --> 3:50:36.760]  Everything behind the scenes, just get it all folks
[3:50:36.760 --> 3:50:38.760]  Okay, there's a couple more stations
[3:50:38.760 --> 3:50:40.760]  They need to send me
[3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:42.760]  I think you only have one of them
[3:50:42.760 --> 3:50:44.760]  Because there was a Florida station
[3:50:44.760 --> 3:50:46.760]  And another one in Idaho
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:48.760]  And another one in Oregon
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:50.760]  So there's two affiliate guys
[3:50:50.760 --> 3:50:52.760]  You were saying I could just cut this over the line
[3:50:52.760 --> 3:50:54.760]  To you
[3:50:54.760 --> 3:50:56.760]  Can I just record this now?
[3:50:56.760 --> 3:50:58.760]  Right now
[3:50:58.760 --> 3:51:00.760]  Or is this not going on the recording computers?
[3:51:00.760 --> 3:51:02.760]  We could just do it during a break tomorrow
[3:51:02.760 --> 3:51:04.760]  That'd just be just fine
[3:51:04.760 --> 3:51:06.760]  It's just kind of hectic right now
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:08.760]  But with the station thing
[3:51:08.760 --> 3:51:10.760]  Yeah, we did
[3:51:10.760 --> 3:51:12.760]  I did go back and talk to Branigan
[3:51:12.760 --> 3:51:14.760]  And just one station once those liners
[3:51:14.760 --> 3:51:16.760]  No, he was saying the others wanted it
[3:51:16.760 --> 3:51:18.760]  Yeah, but then he said
[3:51:18.760 --> 3:51:20.760]  Oh, never mind, hold off on that
[3:51:20.760 --> 3:51:22.760]  Because they're not quite sure
[3:51:22.760 --> 3:51:24.760]  They wanted to do some kind of promotion thing
[3:51:24.760 --> 3:51:26.760]  So I just said hold off on that for now
[3:51:26.760 --> 3:51:28.760]  Because they're still
[3:51:28.760 --> 3:51:30.760]  Years ago I did this all the time
[3:51:30.760 --> 3:51:32.760]  And stations like it and I'm happy to do it for them
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:34.760]  But I need to
[3:51:34.760 --> 3:51:36.760]  And people always ask on the web
[3:51:36.760 --> 3:51:38.760]  Why we don't list all our affiliates
[3:51:38.760 --> 3:51:40.760]  Because people then
[3:51:40.760 --> 3:51:42.760]  Internationally and nationally put them on
[3:51:42.760 --> 3:51:44.760]  List to be harassed
[3:51:44.760 --> 3:51:46.760]  And then people also
[3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:48.760]  From other networks call up
[3:51:48.760 --> 3:51:50.760]  And attack them and attack us
[3:51:50.760 --> 3:51:52.760]  And so we just try to shield our wonderful affiliates
[3:51:52.760 --> 3:51:54.760]  From the scallywags out there
[3:51:54.760 --> 3:51:56.760]  So that's the reason
[3:51:56.760 --> 3:51:58.760]  We cut the liners for everybody
[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:00.760]  Maybe I shouldn't cut these liners on there
[3:52:00.760 --> 3:52:02.760]  For the enemy operatives out there
[3:52:02.760 --> 3:52:04.760]  No, we could just do it tomorrow during a break
[3:52:04.760 --> 3:52:06.760]  Would you just rather me have Rob cut them here
[3:52:06.760 --> 3:52:08.760]  And then email them to you
[3:52:08.760 --> 3:52:10.760]  That's fine
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:12.760]  Well, there was Branigan and who's the other affiliate guy
[3:52:12.760 --> 3:52:14.760]  Because he was saying there was some other stuff
[3:52:14.760 --> 3:52:16.760]  There was at least another Florida one
[3:52:16.760 --> 3:52:18.760]  That did want liners
[3:52:18.760 --> 3:52:20.760]  Yes, sir, there was one
[3:52:20.760 --> 3:52:22.760]  Rockford, Illinois, they definitely wanted the liners
[3:52:22.760 --> 3:52:24.760]  And then it was the
[3:52:24.760 --> 3:52:26.760]  Florida station
[3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:28.760]  They wanted some kind of promotion thing
[3:52:28.760 --> 3:52:30.760]  Put together, but he said just hold off on
[3:52:30.760 --> 3:52:32.760]  They want us to put a promotion thing together?
[3:52:32.760 --> 3:52:34.760]  No, not necessarily
[3:52:34.760 --> 3:52:36.760]  Just tell them, look, we're here to cater to them
[3:52:36.760 --> 3:52:38.760]  Tell them whatever they want, we'll get it done
[3:52:38.760 --> 3:52:40.760]  If they want me to come on as a guest on some of their morning shows or something
[3:52:40.760 --> 3:52:42.760]  Let's get this done
[3:52:42.760 --> 3:52:44.760]  And I'm glad we've got better affiliate relations
[3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:46.760]  That are trying to take care of our stations
[3:52:46.760 --> 3:52:48.760]  Whatever stations want from me, I'll do it
[3:52:48.760 --> 3:52:50.760]  I'm here to kiss their big fat butts
[3:52:50.760 --> 3:52:52.760]  Big fat butts
[3:52:52.760 --> 3:52:54.760]  You said you would definitely get back to us
[3:52:54.760 --> 3:52:56.760]  Everybody knows we have big fat butts
[3:52:56.760 --> 3:52:58.760]  In radio
[3:52:58.760 --> 3:53:00.760]  So yeah, just to cut the liners
[3:53:00.760 --> 3:53:02.760]  For the Rockford, Illinois
[3:53:02.760 --> 3:53:04.760]  And then new ones for us
[3:53:04.760 --> 3:53:06.760]  I'm just entertaining the guys out there
[3:53:06.760 --> 3:53:08.760]  I'll get it done
[3:53:08.760 --> 3:53:10.760]  Tell them send it to Aaron
[3:53:10.760 --> 3:53:12.760]  OK, pal
[3:53:12.760 --> 3:53:14.760]  All right, here we go
[3:53:14.760 --> 3:53:16.760]  All right
[3:53:16.760 --> 3:53:18.760]  The David Gergen thing goes on and on
[3:53:18.760 --> 3:53:20.760]  About him getting out of Bohemian Grove
[3:53:20.760 --> 3:53:22.760]  Not being part of it
[3:53:22.760 --> 3:53:24.760]  He blew up at me and got in my face
[3:53:24.760 --> 3:53:26.760]  2004 at the RNC, so I'm walking in
[3:53:26.760 --> 3:53:28.760]  He was outside
[3:53:28.760 --> 3:53:30.760]  The first security perimeter
[3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:32.760]  There were two more yet to go through
[3:53:32.760 --> 3:53:34.760]  We went up to him and hit him with some questions about that
[3:53:34.760 --> 3:53:36.760]  And he blew up and said, I won't talk about the rituals
[3:53:36.760 --> 3:53:38.760]  It's none of your believe in business
[3:53:38.760 --> 3:53:40.760]  Classic from the order of death
[3:53:40.760 --> 3:53:42.760]  But do you have the Bob Bear clip?
[3:53:42.760 --> 3:53:44.760]  Do you have the part
[3:53:44.760 --> 3:53:46.760]  Where he's talking about insider trading?
[3:53:46.760 --> 3:53:48.760]  I recorded the part that Aaron told me to
[3:53:48.760 --> 3:53:50.760]  OK, go ahead and play it
[3:53:50.760 --> 3:54:18.760]  That's what we're trying to do, we're trying to have dialogue
[3:54:18.760 --> 3:54:20.760]  We appreciate your talking with us
[3:54:20.760 --> 3:54:22.760]  OK, thank you very much
[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:24.760]  And the last thing I would leave you with is
[3:54:24.760 --> 3:54:26.760]  National Reconnaissance Office
[3:54:26.760 --> 3:54:28.760]  Was running a drill, a plane crashing into their building
[3:54:28.760 --> 3:54:30.760]  And you know their staff by DOD and CIA
[3:54:30.760 --> 3:54:32.760]  I know the guy that went into his broker in San Diego
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:34.760]  And said, cash me out, it's going down tomorrow
[3:54:34.760 --> 3:54:36.760]  Really?
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:38.760]  Yeah
[3:54:38.760 --> 3:54:40.760]  That tells us something
[3:54:40.760 --> 3:54:42.760]  Let's run to work in the White House
[3:54:42.760 --> 3:54:44.760]  Can you say that we've hear things
[3:54:44.760 --> 3:54:46.760]  From the American people about Iran
[3:54:46.760 --> 3:54:48.760]  For 30 years
[3:54:48.760 --> 3:54:50.760]  Are you talking about this?
[3:54:50.760 --> 3:54:52.760]  You can go watch the whole thing
[3:54:52.760 --> 3:54:54.760]  I know We Are Change Ohio has a couple sites
[3:54:54.760 --> 3:54:56.760]  I should plug that side address
[3:54:56.760 --> 3:54:58.760]  Regardless, the Bob Bear
[3:54:58.760 --> 3:55:00.760]  And the latest Gergen thing
[3:55:00.760 --> 3:55:02.760]  Is up on infowars.com right now
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:04.760]  You've got him up well done
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:06.760]  Lord Dykes
[3:55:06.760 --> 3:55:08.760]  Doing a fabulous job
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:10.760]  He's a literal OG
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:12.760]  I'm going to go live here
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:14.760]  I'm going to get the camera
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:16.760]  On the window
[3:55:16.760 --> 3:55:18.760]  I want to show everybody out there
[3:55:18.760 --> 3:55:20.760]  It was Ohio and LA
[3:55:20.760 --> 3:55:22.760]  I thought that sounded like Stuart
[3:55:22.760 --> 3:55:24.760]  LA did a great job
[3:55:24.760 --> 3:55:26.760]  Those guys are doing too much
[3:55:26.760 --> 3:55:28.760]  To be able to comment on all the great stuff they're doing
[3:55:28.760 --> 3:55:30.760]  Here, here's the camera
[3:55:30.760 --> 3:55:32.760]  Have the Rusky show back up yet
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:34.760]  From the hamburger
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:36.760]  Here we are ladies and gentlemen
[3:55:36.760 --> 3:55:38.760]  Here's the original OG
[3:55:38.760 --> 3:55:40.760]  Look at that dirty window
[3:55:40.760 --> 3:55:42.760]  Spoiled creatures out there
[3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:44.760]  Piece of plexiglass we just threw up
[3:55:44.760 --> 3:55:46.760]  Was making noise, we're about to move into the bigger studio
[3:55:46.760 --> 3:55:48.760]  Maybe I should yell
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:50.760]  So people can hear me out there
[3:55:50.760 --> 3:55:52.760]  Alright, good job commander
[3:55:52.760 --> 3:55:54.760]  We'll see some more of the guys out there
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:56.760]  There's Aaron working hard
[3:55:56.760 --> 3:55:58.760]  Over there
[3:55:58.760 --> 3:56:00.760]  The original OG as well
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:02.760]  I got a quit screwing around here
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:04.760]  You know what the secret is
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:06.760]  You know what the secret is folks
[3:56:06.760 --> 3:56:08.760]  I can't stay serious all the time
[3:56:08.760 --> 3:56:10.760]  There's just too much going on
[3:56:10.760 --> 3:56:12.760]  I mean all we do is battle
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:14.760]  The New World Order 24-7
[3:56:14.760 --> 3:56:16.760]  I got the
[3:56:16.760 --> 3:56:18.760]  Red Dawn attack
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:20.760]  In fact here in the Russians pulling up right now
[3:56:20.760 --> 3:56:22.760]  I like the Russians, they're waking up to the New World Order
[3:56:22.760 --> 3:56:24.760]  But
[3:56:24.760 --> 3:56:26.760]  It's like a red dawn around here
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:28.760]  What a stupid joke
[3:56:28.760 --> 3:56:30.760]  Clashaze man
[3:56:30.760 --> 3:56:32.760]  I'm the king of them
[3:56:32.760 --> 3:56:34.760]  Oh, I meant to plug this
[3:56:34.760 --> 3:56:36.760]  Don't forget
[3:56:36.760 --> 3:56:38.760]  By 9 o'clock at night
[3:56:38.760 --> 3:56:40.760]  Central, it's going on all day
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:42.760]  From like 3 to midnight
[3:56:42.760 --> 3:56:44.760]  But Willie Nelson goes on at like 9.30-10
[3:56:44.760 --> 3:56:46.760]  I'm going to speak
[3:56:46.760 --> 3:56:48.760]  Willie Nelson's going to speak
[3:56:48.760 --> 3:56:50.760]  Jesse Ventura is going to be speaking
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:56:52.760]  And
[3:56:52.760 --> 3:56:54.760]  We're not doing the free event
[3:56:54.760 --> 3:56:56.760]  Willie's having myself come and speak
[3:56:56.760 --> 3:56:58.760]  Because that was easier
[3:56:58.760 --> 3:57:00.760]  And Jesse Ventura at a current event
[3:57:00.760 --> 3:57:02.760]  The last backyard event
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:04.760]  So I'm explaining that to people
[3:57:04.760 --> 3:57:06.760]  But never fear, you can watch for free
[3:57:06.760 --> 3:57:08.760]  At infowars.com
[3:57:08.760 --> 3:57:10.760]  Sunday night
[3:57:10.760 --> 3:57:12.760]  9 o'clock on
[3:57:12.760 --> 3:57:14.760]  We're going to be
[3:57:14.760 --> 3:57:16.760]  Out there off their ISDN
[3:57:16.760 --> 3:57:18.760]  Off their ISDN, off their cable modem
[3:57:18.760 --> 3:57:20.760]  And off our wireless system
[3:57:20.760 --> 3:57:22.760]  So we'll have two different feeds, one of them
[3:57:22.760 --> 3:57:24.760]  We'll surely be up all the time, if not both
[3:57:24.760 --> 3:57:26.760]  But we always have backup for you
[3:57:26.760 --> 3:57:28.760]  And that is coming up
[3:57:28.760 --> 3:57:30.760]  We have a big guest tomorrow
[3:57:30.760 --> 3:57:32.760]  The big comedian Colleen Doe
[3:57:32.760 --> 3:57:34.760]  Yeah, he's on the show tomorrow
[3:57:34.760 --> 3:57:36.760]  And we got Willie Nelson on Wednesday
[3:57:36.760 --> 3:57:38.760]  With another surprise guest coming up
[3:57:38.760 --> 3:57:40.760]  This week
[3:57:40.760 --> 3:57:42.760]  Talk to Willie quite a bit this weekend
[3:57:42.760 --> 3:57:44.760]  He has such a sweet heart
[3:57:44.760 --> 3:57:46.760]  Retransmission starts now with Alan Watt
[3:57:46.760 --> 3:57:48.760]  And a bunch of other key guests
[3:57:48.760 --> 3:57:50.760]  At one place on the web at infowars.com
[3:57:50.760 --> 3:57:52.760]  Tune in right now
[3:57:52.760 --> 3:57:54.760]  And please keep spreading the word about the show
[3:57:54.760 --> 3:57:56.760]  That's how we're reaching more people
