[00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.990]  Just-on-time deliveries.
[00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.292]  High-tech, AI-run societies.
[00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:17.416]  They're not just perfect for surveillance and control and giant Enron-style scams where they can manipulate your bills and triple and quadruple charge you.
[00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:22.719]  They're not just designed to shut down all the small competitors in every industry and consolidate control.
[00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:38.982]  They are designed to remove humans from the decision-making process so that humans are obsolete and humans can be depopulated without it shutting down the sectors that the globalists still want for themselves.
[00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:43.226]  All US domestic flights grounded after software glitch.
[00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:47.390]  So how does one software have a glitch
[00:00:48.735 --> 00:00:57.980]  The system that's used for the air traffic systems to warn the pilots about dangerous conditions and other events.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:10.988]  How could one piece of software go out and the entire aircraft system of commercial flights, and also screwed up private flights I've been reading, how could that be used to then ground everything?
[00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:23.724]  And it's similar to how they now have introduced legislation sponsored by the big airlines to get rid of two pilots even on 777s and larger aircraft.
[00:01:23.724 --> 00:01:32.928]  Because most of the flights are taking off and going to their destinations and landing without human control.
[00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:35.789]  It's all on autopilot.
[00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.191]  And statistics and research has been coming out for a decade that autopilot
[00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:47.826]  It's causing pilots to get worse and worse and worse, and then glitches in autopilot have grounded large fleets of aircraft.
[00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:52.397]  Because they'll do things like flip an airplane upside down and nosedive it.
[00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:58.022]  This is all in the WEF Post-Industrial World Playbook.
[00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:15.918]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[00:02:17.984 --> 00:02:30.567]  The COVID-19 crisis would be seen, in this respect, as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack.
[00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:35.848]  Pete Bootyjudge called out after FAA system failure grounds all flights.
[00:02:35.848 --> 00:02:37.689]  He has no idea what happened.
[00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:40.826]  But he's gay, so that's all that matters.
[00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:48.968]  I think this gives us a really important data point and a really important moment to understand what we're going to need moving forward.
[00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:54.169]  But obviously our more immediate focus is technical, understanding exactly how this happened.
[00:02:54.169 --> 00:03:01.592]  The system we live under that's becoming more and more centralized every single day.
[00:03:01.592 --> 00:03:06.373]  And it's being done in farming, it's being done in energy, it's being done in transportation, it's being done in education.
[00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:19.944]  All of it is to centralize so that only mega massive corporations can scale up to the regulations and the software and the cost that is in the billions for these systems per industry.
[00:03:19.944 --> 00:03:24.087]  And then by regulatory fiat, all competition is destroyed.
[00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:26.029]  You vertically integrate the economy.
[00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:30.212]  You consolidate control for the post-industrial world.
[00:03:30.552 --> 00:03:45.798]  Today, I'm proud to say that under the UK's presidency, the group of the world's seven most advanced economies, the G7, is launching a set of public policy principles for retail central bank digital currencies, CBDCs.
[00:03:45.798 --> 00:03:55.882]  Digital cash could be programmed to ensure it is only spent on essentials or goods which an employer or government deems to be sensible.
[00:03:55.882 --> 00:03:56.342]  Holy shit.
[00:03:57.363 --> 00:04:03.829]  For many, many years, we've seen digital technology move to build a corral.
[00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.111]  Fences around each of us.
[00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:08.633]  Digital fences of control.
[00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:09.934]  Surveillance systems.
[00:04:09.934 --> 00:04:12.797]  Systems that influence propaganda.
[00:04:12.797 --> 00:04:18.622]  And as they come up, it's like a herd of cattle who have fences coming up around them.
[00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:23.527]  So think of us as having three fences around each one of us.
[00:04:23.527 --> 00:04:33.117]  And what CBDC and digital IDs and vaccine passports will do is they will snap into place a fourth fence.
[00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:40.045]  And when that fence snaps into place, we are locked down financially and digitally.
[00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:41.786]  They want the ring of Mordor.
[00:04:41.786 --> 00:04:43.586]  They want that total control.
[00:04:43.586 --> 00:04:50.209]  And they want there to be a group of competing AI systems that basically merge into one global mind.
[00:04:50.209 --> 00:05:00.414]  And the AI's power is that it directs us, and we follow its orders, and then it takes control of the processes until humans don't know how to do basic tasks anymore.
[00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:05.890]  Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.092]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[00:05:11.092 --> 00:05:15.933]  And InfoWars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:20.274]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:30.397]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a historical memento, so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[00:05:30.397 --> 00:05:43.380]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now, while supplies last, at 1776coin.com.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.321]  And just like an NPR pledge drive, where they mark up a coffee cup, or a t-shirt, or a DVD,
[00:05:48.842 --> 00:05:49.342]  300%.
[00:05:49.342 --> 00:05:51.885]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[00:05:51.885 --> 00:05:56.309]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.211]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:18.020]  InfoWars.
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.206]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:06:19.206 --> 00:06:19.569]  Today.
[00:06:33.762 --> 00:06:42.126]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:42.126 --> 00:06:43.887]  It's Monday, January 16, 2023.
[00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:47.068]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:47.068 --> 00:06:48.189]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:06:50.566 --> 00:07:02.937]  Well, every broadcast is important, but this one will be particularly powerful, and I would imagine the next day will be more powerful, and the next show, and the next, because everything is hitting a quickening right now.
[00:07:02.937 --> 00:07:11.364]  I want everybody, listening to the sound of my voice or watching me right now, to do what I'm about to do.
[00:07:11.364 --> 00:07:14.787]  Take a couple deep breaths, and then sit back,
[00:07:16.112 --> 00:07:16.412]  I think
[00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:40.484]  Saying, okay, the British government arm that studies vaccines says this one should be recalled.
[00:07:40.484 --> 00:07:41.865]  It's hurting people.
[00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:46.267]  And CDC, FDA board members saying they should halt the shots.
[00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:54.111]  And the CDC and FDA coming out saying, okay, it is linked to heart attacks and strokes and blood clots.
[00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:55.251]  Incredible.
[00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:56.072]  Why are they doing that?
[00:07:56.886 --> 00:07:58.107]  Because they can't hide it anymore.
[00:07:58.107 --> 00:08:08.954]  Because we, together, not just this broadcast, not just you, but many other people like Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and all of us together, overpowered their asses.
[00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:15.098]  This has been a first big test inside the New World Order, inside Agenda 2030, when they went from beta to operation.
[00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:16.900]  I'm getting huge chills right now.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.402]  The first big battle of their full-on assault.
[00:08:20.402 --> 00:08:23.124]  And we are winning, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:08:26.254 --> 00:08:33.461]  The whole future of our species stands in the balance right now.
[00:08:33.461 --> 00:08:42.109]  And it's just such an incredible time to be alive and to be witnessing all of this happening.
[00:08:42.109 --> 00:08:47.535]  Then we've got the Davos Group meeting in Davos, Switzerland, being guarded by
[00:08:49.609 --> 00:09:00.458]  5,000 troops and we have even mainstream media and their own admissions by Klaus Schwab that they're in trouble and that the world doesn't trust them if they're being targeted.
[00:09:00.458 --> 00:09:08.605]  And we now have confirmed reports that more than half the attendees that were on the list that leaked last Monday, eight days ago,
[00:09:11.618 --> 00:09:14.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've cancelled going.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.402]  People like George Soros.
[00:09:17.402 --> 00:09:23.687]  Because you're so villainized and so demonized when you go, because we've done our job.
[00:09:23.687 --> 00:09:28.711]  They tried to have their coming out party, their big three year assault, where they're the heroes over the virus.
[00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:32.293]  They created the poison shot they created.
[00:09:32.293 --> 00:09:35.636]  And now the rats are running around on the deck of the ship as it sinks.
[00:09:38.556 --> 00:09:40.997]  Wow, do I have stacks for you on that.
[00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.118]  Wow.
[00:09:42.118 --> 00:09:44.859]  Victory.
[00:09:44.859 --> 00:09:46.120]  I can smell it.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.880]  I can taste it.
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.540]  I can feel it.
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.421]  I can see it.
[00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:51.242]  But they're going to hit us, and I know how they're going to hit us.
[00:09:51.242 --> 00:09:52.302]  They already pre-programmed it.
[00:09:52.302 --> 00:10:00.386]  They're going to hit us with power outages and massive cyber attacks, taking down airlines, you name it, as I predicted in the last year now happening.
[00:10:00.386 --> 00:10:04.048]  Why, in absence of a-listers at Deimos, is not just deeply troubled.
[00:10:04.997 --> 00:10:06.018]  That's Sky News, Fox News of the UK.
[00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:06.378]  Look at that.
[00:10:06.378 --> 00:10:09.439]  And it goes on from there, where Klaus Schwab is at the event
[00:10:27.423 --> 00:10:29.203]  They will create trust again.
[00:10:29.203 --> 00:10:30.944]  They will trust us again.
[00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:34.344]  And don't worry, they've got a new system they're offering.
[00:10:34.344 --> 00:10:40.625]  Universal basic income and reparations for Africans in Africa and black people in America.
[00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:46.766]  Just like Joe Biden was going to give you free tuition and forgive your student loans, and he went, oh, here it is.
[00:10:46.766 --> 00:10:50.947]  Oh, after you voted for me, you thought, sorry, bye bye.
[00:10:50.947 --> 00:10:56.768]  It's called dangling a carrot in front of your face.
[00:10:58.239 --> 00:11:09.262]  Oh, and wait till you see their agenda, their public agenda of how they're going to save us and all the wonderful things they're going to be doing for us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:11.178 --> 00:11:12.299]  So that's a huge victory.
[00:11:12.299 --> 00:11:13.640]  We're going to go through all that.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:24.269]  Matt Gaetz went on Tim Pool's show and did a really great five minute summation about how the deep state really operates and how it comes after you when you don't take the carrot, they come after you with a stick.
[00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:26.270]  We're going to be looking at that.
[00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:30.213]  But this is just insane level information.
[00:11:30.213 --> 00:11:35.317]  Then we've got Democrats in California and in D.C.
[00:11:35.317 --> 00:11:39.301]  and other states, but also the federal government, introducing legislation
[00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:42.492]  To criminalize the First Amendment.
[00:11:42.492 --> 00:11:43.952]  You heard me right.
[00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:47.173]  Here is the headline.
[00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:53.896]  Congress introduces a bill that criminalizes criticism of any non-white person.
[00:11:53.896 --> 00:11:55.596]  That's actually in the bill.
[00:11:55.596 --> 00:12:01.078]  That's all they've got to fall back on is racial division and control.
[00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:03.880]  They think that is their ace in the hole.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.701]  And that ties into Martin Luther King Day and the abomination that
[00:12:08.956 --> 00:12:36.081]  was unveiled we'll be getting to a little bit later over the weekend that people when they saw it they thought it was a joke from one side it's a person putting their face in a butt crack from the other side it's a giant bronze penis even with the penis head circumcised head being held up and you ask why would they do such a thing why would they pay fifteen million dollars for that
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:42.063]  Because it's all about ugly art and about a joke on us, and that's why they do it.
[00:12:42.063 --> 00:12:44.304]  It's in declassified CIA documents.
[00:12:44.304 --> 00:12:47.105]  We're going to be getting to that as well.
[00:12:47.105 --> 00:12:52.868]  If you make the art ugly and weird and bizarre and a joke, they believe that you make the culture a bizarre joke.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.921]  And that ties in with how they're bringing down the joke Joe Biden.
[00:12:57.921 --> 00:12:58.621]  He's done.
[00:12:58.621 --> 00:13:00.181]  They're bringing him down.
[00:13:00.181 --> 00:13:01.462]  They always had the documents.
[00:13:01.462 --> 00:13:03.382]  They always knew he was a Chinese spy.
[00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:05.643]  They always knew he was a pedophile.
[00:13:05.643 --> 00:13:07.263]  And now he's lived his usefulness.
[00:13:07.263 --> 00:13:13.524]  Now they want him to get out of the way for Big Mike, Michelle Obama, to run.
[00:13:13.524 --> 00:13:15.005]  And that's all being lined up.
[00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:19.466]  Gavin Newsom's fluttering around like a flying monkey as well, ready to be brought in.
[00:13:20.578 --> 00:13:27.043]  But now New York City Mayor Eric Adams lays blame squarely at the feet of Joe Biden during a visit to the border.
[00:13:27.043 --> 00:13:33.687]  So now the Democrats are visiting the border and blaming the guy that deserves to be blamed, except he's just the puppet.
[00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:36.189]  This is a globalist Obama policy.
[00:13:36.189 --> 00:13:41.493]  So now it's open season on Biden, USA Today, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times.
[00:13:41.493 --> 00:13:43.754]  I've got stacks of articles.
[00:13:43.754 --> 00:13:45.515]  He's a spy.
[00:13:45.515 --> 00:13:46.696]  He's got to go.
[00:13:46.696 --> 00:13:48.838]  More documents found by his staff.
[00:13:50.014 --> 00:13:52.656]  He's a senile guy that doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[00:13:52.656 --> 00:13:57.000]  Now the Obama operatives are getting ready to bring him down.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.242]  And so many conservatives are going, Yay!
[00:13:59.242 --> 00:14:00.282]  We're vindicated!
[00:14:00.282 --> 00:14:01.524]  Yay!
[00:14:01.524 --> 00:14:02.604]  Down with Biden!
[00:14:02.604 --> 00:14:10.291]  Biden is an evil old degenerate puppet who can't even keep from pooping his pants.
[00:14:10.291 --> 00:14:18.598]  That's why it came out three weeks ago that he hates the Secret Service and refuses to talk in front of him or bring him with him when he's in buildings because we told you
[00:14:19.753 --> 00:14:30.176]  According to the Secret Service, in New York and D.C., on a two-day trip, he crapped himself three times last year.
[00:14:30.176 --> 00:14:37.119]  And if he gets mad in an argument with his staff, he just craps himself.
[00:14:37.119 --> 00:14:40.560]  Then they take him in the bathroom, and they clean it up.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.280]  And he likes making them do it.
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.581]  LBJ liked to have
[00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:44.952]  We're good to go.
[00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:28.219]  Well, they know their brain-dead robot has totally failed, and so now, he was a placeholder for them so they could implode the economy, bring in world government, get rid of the border, launch all these wars, and have him to blame for the disaster that comes, so that they can now pre-position, as they destroy him over the next year, the next person so he doesn't announce that he is about to run for president.
[00:15:28.219 --> 00:15:30.041]  Because he still thinks he's the president.
[00:15:30.041 --> 00:15:34.064]  He's still on a power trip, so they need to let him know, if you run for president,
[00:15:35.003 --> 00:15:40.886]  The Attorney General will indict you, even though they're not supposed to be able to do that.
[00:15:40.886 --> 00:15:42.567]  It's his own branch indicting him.
[00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:43.948]  They don't care.
[00:15:43.948 --> 00:15:46.049]  It's the bureaucracy flexing its muscles.
[00:15:46.049 --> 00:15:50.291]  They'll flex them on Trump as much as they'll flex them on Biden.
[00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:52.392]  Also, we've got the latest transgender news.
[00:15:52.392 --> 00:15:54.593]  You're going to wait till you hear this.
[00:15:54.593 --> 00:15:55.754]  So much more coming up.
[00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:56.694]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:59.996]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:59.996 --> 00:16:03.658]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance.
[00:16:04.522 --> 00:16:15.189]  To get a historic signed copy of my number one bestselling book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:27.418]  Yes, you can get the book in stores, you can find it online, but if you want to get a historic signed copy and be part of our fundraiser to stay on air, go to InfoWarsTore.com and go to the book section and get your signed book.
[00:16:28.058 --> 00:16:32.342]  There are only about a thousand of these left, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:16:32.342 --> 00:16:35.884]  I'm never going to sign the book again.
[00:16:35.884 --> 00:16:41.609]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later that's a piece of art that goes with the book, but I haven't even decided when I'm going to do that.
[00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:42.670]  It may never happen.
[00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:52.078]  But for just simple, straight-up signed books, and to be part of this fundraiser, this is the last time you'll be able to get the signed book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:52.458 --> 00:16:53.720]  I thank you all for your support.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.864]  Please go to mflaworthrow.com and get your signed book today.
[00:16:56.864 --> 00:16:59.487]  And I thank you for keeping us in the fight against the globalists.
[00:17:00.003 --> 00:17:07.209]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.
[00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:18.238]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[00:17:18.238 --> 00:17:26.805]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.
[00:17:26.805 --> 00:17:27.385]  Introducing
[00:17:28.206 --> 00:17:32.769]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:32.769 --> 00:17:38.052]  InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com has 10 new products.
[00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:46.257]  Turmeric 95, Lipido RX, Better Mood, Nitric Boost, Mushroom Max, Atropine, Angel's Vitality Collagen,
[00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:52.781]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[00:18:08.892 --> 00:18:12.434]  Rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:18:12.434 --> 00:18:16.456]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[00:18:16.456 --> 00:18:18.737]  And it's the same psy-op today.
[00:18:18.737 --> 00:18:23.139]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[00:18:23.139 --> 00:18:25.600]  Because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:35.130]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:40.817]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:18:41.317 --> 00:18:43.258]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[00:18:43.258 --> 00:18:50.521]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[00:18:50.521 --> 00:18:51.941]  It is all in your hands.
[00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:53.262]  So thanks for your support.
[00:18:53.262 --> 00:18:54.482]  Stand up against the globalists.
[00:18:54.482 --> 00:18:57.744]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[00:18:57.744 --> 00:18:58.244]  It's up to you.
[00:19:00.003 --> 00:19:02.224]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:06.245]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[00:19:06.245 --> 00:19:07.565]  There's a solution.
[00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:08.546]  The Wellness Company.
[00:19:08.546 --> 00:19:11.847]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[00:19:11.847 --> 00:19:28.372]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online
[00:19:28.872 --> 00:19:29.532]  We're good to go.
[00:20:01.252 --> 00:20:07.173]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:20:30.868 --> 00:20:33.291]  Alright, let's do this.
[00:20:33.291 --> 00:20:35.914]  I've got three clips today that are...
[00:20:37.026 --> 00:20:40.887]  New and several that have never been discovered.
[00:20:40.887 --> 00:20:46.189]  I've certainly never seen them that are going viral that are just all mind-blowing.
[00:20:46.189 --> 00:20:50.710]  Each one of these is mind-blowing and I'm gonna hit those next segment.
[00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.910]  I mean this is just insane.
[00:20:52.910 --> 00:21:00.352]  It is the UN openly admitting they're in an information war with the people of America and Europe and that they control the media, that they direct it all.
[00:21:00.352 --> 00:21:03.233]  You already saw a couple months ago the UN head of information said that.
[00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:04.734]  There's more clips.
[00:21:04.734 --> 00:21:05.494]  And then we've got
[00:21:06.394 --> 00:21:16.117]  The Davos Group and other meetings where they're currently saying, we're taking over the genes of everybody's body and are going to reprogram all your genes.
[00:21:16.117 --> 00:21:28.281]  Then they go on to say, like with mice or rats, we can make them have white hair or black hair with this mRNA, as an example, and we're going to use the whole COVID situation to bring this in and take full control.
[00:21:29.178 --> 00:21:37.425]  Now they already said that five years ago on C-SPAN with Fauci, we played the clip a lot, but it's just, they're admitting the whole thing!
[00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:51.858]  And we've got, we've got, we've got still all these shills getting paid by Big Pharma, while Big Pharma announces they're taking over our bodies.
[00:21:53.226 --> 00:21:59.993]  And getting rid of any process of any type of testing and going right to the public, totally evil, saying none of this is happening.
[00:21:59.993 --> 00:22:08.261]  So they're in this paradox where they're normalizing it by admitting they're doing it, demonizing those of us that criticize it, and then having other people come out and say it doesn't exist.
[00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:12.765]  Because they want their cake and to eat it too.
[00:22:12.765 --> 00:22:17.430]  But I wanted to hit this first, because this is a big, big deal.
[00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:24.344]  Why an absence of A-listers at Davos is not just deep trouble for the World Economic Forum, but for globalists too.
[00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:37.031]  The world Davos thrived in is disintegrating, and the summit has fewer heavyweights attending than in years gone by, as the era of globalism itself appears to be ending.
[00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:40.693]  The New World Order folks is in big trouble.
[00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:45.416]  When Hillary lost, they said they'd probably already lost in internal documents that leaked out of the UN.
[00:22:46.775 --> 00:23:07.192]  And they launched the virus as a pretext to get us to buy into the control, bring in the World ID, bring in the SDRs, bring in the global currencies, but now because... I mean, there's hundreds of top scientists today, I can't even keep track of it, literally coming out saying, don't take it, it's deadly, oh my God, it's on purpose, they killed us, here's the studies where they knew what happened.
[00:23:07.192 --> 00:23:11.296]  Everything we reverse engineered three years ago through now is all over the news now.
[00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:19.313]  So a lot of you are going to see us report on things we said years ago because it's just now coming out.
[00:23:19.313 --> 00:23:30.976]  It's the same thing with the Spars war game that the Rockefellers and the UN and John Hopkins did two years before they released the virus.
[00:23:30.976 --> 00:23:33.917]  It describes how they were going to mitigate this and how they blame
[00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:43.732]  Big Pharma win the shot for a new virus, destroyed our immune system, how they'd make the public think it was a mistake.
[00:23:43.732 --> 00:23:50.781]  See, so they already had their plan to admit to a lot of it, but now it's gotten out of control.
[00:23:50.781 --> 00:23:51.902]  They've lost control, folks.
[00:23:51.902 --> 00:23:52.723]  They think they're God.
[00:23:52.723 --> 00:23:53.124]  They're not.
[00:23:54.246 --> 00:24:06.610]  So you look at this whole report, Davos and the World Economic Forum, WEF and its founder Klaus Schwab have become more famous than ever before in the past couple of years, albeit not for the reasons they might have wanted.
[00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.932]  Penetrating governments, trying to destroy governmental control by the people, which they admit they're trying to do.
[00:24:12.772 --> 00:24:17.594]  Trying to cut your carbon, trying to bankrupt the old system and create a new system.
[00:24:17.594 --> 00:24:27.878]  The minute the public knows the New World Order is bad for you and your family, and it's meant to enslave you, and that opposing them is the answer to freedom and prosperity, it's game over.
[00:24:27.878 --> 00:24:31.499]  I've said that probably 3,000 times the last few years.
[00:24:31.499 --> 00:24:33.520]  I say it every day.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.902]  And our job is to say, they're the authors of your pain.
[00:24:37.902 --> 00:24:40.263]  And as soon as we light their ass up with the truth,
[00:24:41.547 --> 00:24:48.970]  Just like in the military, they put the special forces in to laze the target so that when the missiles come in, they know where to hit.
[00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:50.130]  Now I'm using that as an allegory.
[00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.751]  I'm not saying shoot missiles at them.
[00:24:51.751 --> 00:24:59.994]  I'm saying our job was to take the heat, laze the target, light it up so that people knew what was happening.
[00:24:59.994 --> 00:25:01.175]  And we did it, folks.
[00:25:01.175 --> 00:25:02.095]  You did it.
[00:25:02.095 --> 00:25:04.076]  We lit their ass up.
[00:25:04.076 --> 00:25:05.837]  We lit their ass up.
[00:25:05.837 --> 00:25:07.237]  You lit their ass up.
[00:25:07.237 --> 00:25:08.518]  And now their ass is grass.
[00:25:11.032 --> 00:25:13.173]  But they're gonna strike back.
[00:25:13.173 --> 00:25:13.994]  Look at these headlines.
[00:25:13.994 --> 00:25:14.714]  Trusted U.S.
[00:25:14.714 --> 00:25:16.615]  institution hits record low.
[00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:18.656]  National poll finds Forbes.
[00:25:18.656 --> 00:25:21.197]  And they've got international polls.
[00:25:21.197 --> 00:25:22.678]  They've got global polls.
[00:25:22.678 --> 00:25:25.519]  All finding the exact same thing.
[00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:30.982]  Trusted government hits all-time low.
[00:25:30.982 --> 00:25:33.964]  Australian National University.
[00:25:33.964 --> 00:25:36.105]  Public trusted government lowest ever recorded.
[00:25:38.354 --> 00:25:43.418]  So, they thought they'd execute this plan and get away with it, and we would just blame our national leaders.
[00:25:43.418 --> 00:25:50.282]  In fact, Schwab talked about, as we bring in our system and destroy the old system, it will be the politicians and others that will get the blame.
[00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:52.004]  Then we will be the saviors.
[00:25:52.004 --> 00:25:54.605]  No, you won't, buddy boy!
[00:25:54.605 --> 00:25:55.786]  We've got your plan!
[00:25:55.786 --> 00:25:57.307]  We've blown your plan!
[00:25:57.307 --> 00:26:01.210]  Praise God!
[00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.912]  And pass the information warfare ammunition.
[00:26:05.438 --> 00:26:11.802]  And you got the eco-groups that would never do it, now suddenly slamming Davos Summit for the global elites arriving on their private jets.
[00:26:11.802 --> 00:26:13.563]  They thought they could have it both ways.
[00:26:13.563 --> 00:26:19.807]  Soros pulls out of World Economic Forum due to unavoidable scheduling problem.
[00:26:19.807 --> 00:26:27.231]  And now up to half the group that are on the list that we're going to attend are suddenly announcing they're not coming.
[00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:30.993]  They don't want to be associated with it.
[00:26:30.993 --> 00:26:33.195]  They thought we'd all fight over race and everything else.
[00:26:33.195 --> 00:26:34.816]  They thought they'd distract us.
[00:26:36.147 --> 00:26:43.009]  But now their 5,000 troops won't protect their reputations, their names for the actions and crimes they've committed.
[00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:44.129]  Guard them all day.
[00:26:44.129 --> 00:26:45.490]  We don't want them to die.
[00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:48.470]  We don't want anybody to shoot them or bomb them or poison them.
[00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:54.292]  We want them arrested for Nuremberg 2, for the crimes against humanity they've committed.
[00:26:54.892 --> 00:27:01.796]  For the plan to implode the world economy and flood the borders and roll out the poison shot and try to take over our bodies and create a world ID.
[00:27:01.796 --> 00:27:10.040]  All of it is classical tyranny and we want you kept nice and healthy.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:23.247]  For when you get marched up to those gallows after you've been found guilty and before that trap door opens and you fall those three feet and your neck is broken.
[00:27:27.941 --> 00:27:30.903]  A new system inside the Davos Summit 2023.
[00:27:30.903 --> 00:27:33.925]  It's up on Infowars.com from ZeroHedge.com.
[00:27:33.925 --> 00:27:44.833]  And they have met and say, oh, here's our agenda addressing the current energy and food crisis, which they've engineered, cutting off power all over the world, cutting off food production all over the world.
[00:27:45.613 --> 00:27:47.174]  Literally having the Davos Group and U.N.
[00:27:47.174 --> 00:27:50.697]  direct the biggest food producers in the world to massively cut food production.
[00:27:50.697 --> 00:27:57.703]  And then they cut the fertilizer off, they cut the fuel off, they cut the machine parts off, and then they're going to address it with bugs.
[00:27:57.703 --> 00:27:58.703]  That's right.
[00:27:58.703 --> 00:28:05.529]  Addressing the current energy and food crisis in the context of a new system for energy, climate, and nature will save you.
[00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:06.790]  Just go to our new system.
[00:28:08.268 --> 00:28:16.783]  Addressing the current high inflation, low growth, high debt economy in context of a new system, a new system for investment, trade infrastructure run by them.
[00:28:18.041 --> 00:28:19.803]  As they blow up the old system.
[00:28:19.803 --> 00:28:30.372]  Addressing the current industrial headwinds in the context of a new system for harnessing frontier technologies that they own and control that don't work, for private sector innovation and resilience.
[00:28:30.372 --> 00:28:36.418]  Four, addressing the current social vulnerabilities in context of a new system, social credit score, skills and care.
[00:28:36.418 --> 00:28:42.664]  Number five, addressing the current geopolitical risk in the context of a new system for dialogue cooperating in a multipolar world.
[00:28:44.127 --> 00:28:48.132]  Positioning the West for its fall into a global crisis they control.
[00:28:48.132 --> 00:28:54.419]  Except they need to be positioned as the boss and the savior, and you're positioned as the villain!
[00:28:54.419 --> 00:28:57.303]  Not where you wanted to be, Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates!
[00:28:57.303 --> 00:28:58.083]  We have you!
[00:28:59.889 --> 00:29:03.432]  It's your last chance to own a piece of real history.
[00:29:03.432 --> 00:29:06.034]  Your support of InfoWars has made history.
[00:29:06.034 --> 00:29:10.858]  We've had the most devastating effects against the globalists and their whole agenda is in deep trouble.
[00:29:10.858 --> 00:29:13.920]  But now it's more important for us to stay on air than ever.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.063]  And if you don't support us, we will shut down.
[00:29:17.063 --> 00:29:26.971]  I am asking you from the bottom of my heart to commit even harder to the support you've given to this fight and to go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and get one of the last signed copies
[00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:28.171]  We're good to go.
[00:29:59.712 --> 00:30:01.374]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[00:30:01.374 --> 00:30:03.235]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[00:30:03.235 --> 00:30:11.320]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most affected individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.463]  But ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[00:30:15.463 --> 00:30:18.145]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[00:30:20.026 --> 00:30:24.690]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down.
[00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.712]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[00:30:26.712 --> 00:30:28.534]  So please, keep me on the field.
[00:30:28.534 --> 00:30:33.739]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy, while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:44.930]  Big red banner at the top of InfoWarsTore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.671]  But I thank you all for your support.
[00:30:46.671 --> 00:30:51.094]  Please commit now to go to infowarestore.com and get great products and make donations.
[00:30:51.094 --> 00:30:52.074]  I thank you for your support.
[00:30:52.074 --> 00:30:53.275]  Now take action!
[00:30:53.275 --> 00:30:56.017]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[00:30:59.611 --> 00:31:02.852]  InfoWars MD is finally here.
[00:31:02.852 --> 00:31:19.535]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through InfoWars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[00:31:19.535 --> 00:31:25.416]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the InfoWars MD line.
[00:31:25.996 --> 00:31:28.538]  The highest quality, triple testing.
[00:31:28.538 --> 00:31:32.500]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.003]  You'll get them at InfoWarsStore.com under our exclusive label.
[00:31:37.003 --> 00:31:42.927]  We're bringing you the highest quality supplements directly from the factory, right here in the USA, to your door.
[00:31:42.927 --> 00:31:48.791]  It'll make your life healthy, better, boost your immune system, and it keeps InfoWarsStore on the air.
[00:31:48.791 --> 00:31:55.776]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com with massive, massive savings.
[00:31:59.718 --> 00:32:01.539]  Infowars is winning.
[00:32:01.539 --> 00:32:03.580]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:06.381]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[00:32:06.381 --> 00:32:09.123]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[00:32:09.123 --> 00:32:11.224]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[00:32:11.224 --> 00:32:13.285]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[00:32:13.285 --> 00:32:14.265]  None of that's true.
[00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:15.146]  It's all being appealed.
[00:32:15.626 --> 00:32:24.589]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[00:32:24.589 --> 00:32:28.030]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.751]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[00:32:30.751 --> 00:32:40.635]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[00:32:41.095 --> 00:32:42.456]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[00:32:42.456 --> 00:32:46.778]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:32:46.778 --> 00:32:50.960]  Because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.341]  The majority of you have not been signed off, but some of you have.
[00:32:54.341 --> 00:32:56.302]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[00:32:56.302 --> 00:33:01.385]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:07.288]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:13.135 --> 00:33:15.759]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:20.887]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:39.565 --> 00:33:41.486]  All right, let me hit this group of clips.
[00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:45.847]  At least we'll get to some of them.
[00:33:45.847 --> 00:33:55.990]  Of the WF, the UN, and other globalist organizations admitting the plan to take over your body, to take over your DNA, and use COVID as the pretext to do it all.
[00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.851]  Let me tell you about what's coming up tomorrow.
[00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:02.492]  We're going to do a fundraiser tomorrow, but it's going to be a very special broadcast.
[00:34:02.492 --> 00:34:06.294]  We've got more than 30 guests that are being set up.
[00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:07.114]  From 8 a.m.
[00:34:07.114 --> 00:34:07.494]  tomorrow,
[00:34:09.215 --> 00:34:10.056]  From 8 a.m.
[00:34:10.056 --> 00:34:14.218]  tomorrow until past midnight.
[00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:18.200]  And here is the list of some of the guests we're going to have.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:23.544]  We have a new website that simply has the live show feed on it and donate buttons.
[00:34:24.822 --> 00:34:28.565]  And a place to put your email in if you want news alerts.
[00:34:28.565 --> 00:34:31.107]  And that is conspiracyfact.info.
[00:34:31.107 --> 00:34:32.908]  The site's not built yet.
[00:34:32.908 --> 00:34:34.029]  There's some basic info on it.
[00:34:34.029 --> 00:34:36.030]  It'll be done in the next few hours.
[00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:39.052]  But conspiracyfact.info is not a redirect.
[00:34:39.052 --> 00:34:44.596]  It's a completely new website that's not been blacklisted by Google, Twitter, Facebook, or any of them yet.
[00:34:44.596 --> 00:34:45.957]  They probably will.
[00:34:45.957 --> 00:34:50.621]  But for now, you can say, hey, Alex Jones is on air breaking down the secrets of the New World Order.
[00:34:52.915 --> 00:34:57.017]  While the Dabos Group meets in Switzerland, their whole program is imploding.
[00:34:57.017 --> 00:34:58.758]  Humanity's awakening.
[00:34:58.758 --> 00:35:06.802]  Share the link and tell those you give it to to share the link and tell them to tell the people that they give it to to share the link and so forth and so on.
[00:35:06.802 --> 00:35:10.004]  So, conspiracyfact.info.
[00:35:10.004 --> 00:35:11.985]  Conspiracyfact.info.
[00:35:11.985 --> 00:35:12.805]  One word.
[00:35:12.805 --> 00:35:15.187]  Conspiracyfact.info.
[00:35:15.187 --> 00:35:18.008]  And here is who is going to be on the show tomorrow.
[00:35:18.008 --> 00:35:21.150]  A bunch of big guests, including myself with Harrison Smith.
[00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:24.485]  We're gonna line up a bunch for him tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[00:35:24.485 --> 00:35:24.926]  kickoff.
[00:35:24.926 --> 00:35:25.787]  11 a.m.
[00:35:25.787 --> 00:35:40.325]  with me, Paul Joseph Watson, Mark Passio, Jotep Jesus, Drew Hernandez, Gavin McGinnis, Dr. Judy Mikovits, don't want to miss that, Maria Zee, with a bunch of special guests, Roger Stone, Savannah Hernandez, Darren Beattie,
[00:35:41.286 --> 00:36:03.682]  Dan Dix, Tom Renz, Jay Dyer with the Big Spars Update, incredible info he's got on that front, Edward Dowd doing the actuaries on the death numbers, Mickey Willis in studio, Alex Stein, Dr. Stella Emanuel, Robert Barnes, and a bunch of other surprise guests that we are lining up right now but we've not put on the list.
[00:36:03.682 --> 00:36:06.364]  So, conspiracyfact.info.
[00:36:06.364 --> 00:36:07.465]  And look, here's the deal.
[00:36:09.292 --> 00:36:15.237]  Our information is more pertinent and more authoritative now than it's ever been.
[00:36:15.237 --> 00:36:17.239]  People are really ready to hear the truth.
[00:36:17.239 --> 00:36:19.101]  The censorship's all coming out.
[00:36:19.101 --> 00:36:20.842]  The poison shots are coming out.
[00:36:20.842 --> 00:36:22.143]  Their world government's coming out.
[00:36:22.143 --> 00:36:25.726]  Their plan to implode the economy and the borders is coming out.
[00:36:25.726 --> 00:36:28.369]  But they're only intensifying their attacks on the tip of the spear.
[00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:31.852]  That's why Elon Musk didn't bring me back to Twitter, but brought back almost everybody else.
[00:36:32.543 --> 00:36:38.325]  Because the system knows I've got their number, and knows that we have given them the majority of their opposition.
[00:36:38.325 --> 00:36:39.145]  That means you have.
[00:36:39.145 --> 00:36:41.206]  They hate this audience of activists.
[00:36:41.206 --> 00:36:45.447]  So please tell folks about the special broadcast tomorrow.
[00:36:45.447 --> 00:36:49.428]  Please get millions of extra folks to tune in, because we're going to be hard-hitting.
[00:36:49.428 --> 00:36:52.189]  And for a lot of the broadcasts, it's going to be commercial-free.
[00:36:52.189 --> 00:36:58.231]  During my show, and Owen's show, and Harrison's that are on a lot of TV and radio stations, we'll be taking some of the breaks.
[00:36:58.231 --> 00:36:59.031]  We're going to skip our
[00:37:00.478 --> 00:37:01.098]  Network breaks.
[00:37:01.098 --> 00:37:02.739]  We'll run the local breaks for local stations.
[00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:04.481]  So they get those, they need those.
[00:37:04.481 --> 00:37:06.002]  But this is going to be very powerful.
[00:37:06.002 --> 00:37:09.964]  A lot of breaking news tomorrow and a fundraiser.
[00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:15.848]  I need you to go to mfulworthstore.com, make a $5, $10, $20 donation, or do a recurring if you want, canceling time for free.
[00:37:15.848 --> 00:37:18.029]  Just click a button.
[00:37:18.029 --> 00:37:26.075]  I need you to go there and get products you already need, like the Real Red Pill Plus and Down and Out Sleep Aid, our strongest sleep aid that's back in stock.
[00:37:26.075 --> 00:37:28.556]  Real Red Pill is 50% off.
[00:37:28.556 --> 00:37:29.176]  The Sleep Aid is 40% off.
[00:37:31.769 --> 00:37:33.970]  Talk about intensifying the quality of your life.
[00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:37.573]  These products are incredible.
[00:37:37.573 --> 00:37:43.056]  It's also your last chance to get a signed copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, part of that fundraiser.
[00:37:43.056 --> 00:37:46.779]  If you want to pay a lot less, just get the regular book unsigned.
[00:37:46.779 --> 00:37:53.803]  But if you have the money and want to donate, have a memento of your support, you get a signed copy of the book at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:37:53.803 --> 00:37:54.364]  We have the great
[00:37:55.464 --> 00:38:05.409]  Infowars MD line with turmeric 95, mushroom max that's a next level nootropic, and the CBD full spectrum highest end for about half the price you'd pay in stores.
[00:38:05.409 --> 00:38:09.431]  The very same CBD oil that's so great for pain, so amazing for joints and more.
[00:38:09.431 --> 00:38:12.712]  That's all under the Infowars MD banner at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:38:12.712 --> 00:38:20.376]  And one last thing, all of the founding members
[00:38:22.025 --> 00:38:27.648]  Who got the coins at InfowarsStore.com and 1776coin.com.
[00:38:27.648 --> 00:38:30.569]  I'm six, eight months behind all our projects.
[00:38:30.569 --> 00:38:36.752]  But finally, we're going to start launching some of those projects at the end of this week and in the next week.
[00:38:36.752 --> 00:38:40.794]  Everybody that got a founding member coin are going to get some real benefits for that.
[00:38:40.794 --> 00:38:43.276]  But I told you up front, if we can shut down, you'll never get any benefits.
[00:38:43.276 --> 00:38:51.140]  You know, you just kept us on air for a while and changed the world and have that historical piece of history that you know you had skin in the game.
[00:38:52.045 --> 00:38:56.912]  But thank God we've gone through all these hurdles, gone through all these hoops, we're still on air.
[00:38:56.912 --> 00:39:05.423]  And so anybody that got any one of the first three coins, or if you get the Teddy Roosevelt coin, only a few thousand left of that as well, we'll extend founding membership to you as well.
[00:39:06.493 --> 00:39:06.813]  You're not
[00:39:25.189 --> 00:39:25.789]  We're good to go.
[00:39:43.806 --> 00:39:45.027]  I'm a few minutes out from break and
[00:40:14.813 --> 00:40:20.498]  I'm going to come back and hit that big news and those clips I mentioned that are so incredible.
[00:40:20.498 --> 00:40:31.167]  Also, I intend to open the phones up throughout the broadcast today in the second and third hour until Ezra Levant of The Incredible.
[00:40:31.167 --> 00:40:33.629]  For the size of the organization, they're the most powerful out there.
[00:40:33.629 --> 00:40:42.376]  I mean, when it comes to hardcore reporters around the world breaking incredible news, Ezra Levant and his team are just incredible.
[00:40:42.376 --> 00:40:43.397]  He is in Davos.
[00:40:44.656 --> 00:40:45.756]  He is there covering it.
[00:40:45.756 --> 00:40:50.838]  He joins us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour.
[00:40:50.838 --> 00:41:04.483]  But in the second and the first half of the third hour, we are going to be taking your phone calls on any issue or any item or any area that you want to get into today.
[00:41:04.483 --> 00:41:06.144]  So I really look forward to opening the phones up.
[00:41:06.144 --> 00:41:10.485]  That's always informative, always takes us in angles and directions we wouldn't have gone in.
[00:41:10.485 --> 00:41:12.666]  But I'll also be interspersing a ton
[00:41:13.626 --> 00:41:15.907]  Because this is all not a prop up here in front of me.
[00:41:15.907 --> 00:41:24.129]  These are all real articles, real stories, real insanity that we're going to be getting to here today.
[00:41:24.129 --> 00:41:31.571]  But these particular clips I'm about to play are so criminal.
[00:41:31.571 --> 00:41:32.811]  Every one of these clips
[00:41:34.005 --> 00:41:43.035]  Should have the Justice Department getting indictments of Deimos Group members in Big Pharma and in government and in corporations.
[00:41:43.035 --> 00:41:52.205]  I mean, if you go to Wikipedia, it's linked to their website, they say we want to capture governments, we want to capture democracies and remove the people from the governing process.
[00:41:52.205 --> 00:41:55.729]  That's on Wikipedia with a link to Klaus Schwab's own website.
[00:41:56.209 --> 00:42:07.793]  When you want to capture governments and bring the people out of the decision-making process, that's a fancy way of saying totalitarianism, dictatorship.
[00:42:07.793 --> 00:42:14.955]  And that's what's so wild about this, is they're just rebranding stuff that we know is bad.
[00:42:14.955 --> 00:42:17.576]  I mean, if you had a bottle of cyanide, one drop will kill you.
[00:42:17.576 --> 00:42:24.198]  Instead of having a skull and bones on it saying, cyanide, deadly poison, don't touch, don't drink, don't inhale, and you put flowers on it,
[00:42:25.177 --> 00:42:31.840]  And said, uh, this is, this is, uh, sugar water or something.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.741]  People would drink it and die.
[00:42:33.741 --> 00:42:41.124]  But I mean, you still see the effects, you still know what it is, and it's just beyond wild.
[00:42:41.124 --> 00:42:43.425]  Absolutely beyond insane.
[00:42:43.425 --> 00:42:47.707]  Absolutely just, it's so weird to still be on air during the New World Order takeover.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.161]  But we're here, we're still on air, because there's not just evil, there's good.
[00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:56.723]  And so we're still on air fighting, and we're having victory, so we've got to push harder now than ever.
[00:42:56.723 --> 00:43:02.066]  InfoWars has made history.
[00:43:02.066 --> 00:43:04.687]  You have made history by supporting InfoWars.
[00:43:04.687 --> 00:43:07.868]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[00:43:07.868 --> 00:43:11.310]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.850]  Let's win the war.
[00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:14.631]  The information war.
[00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:16.592]  There's nothing you can do more important
[00:43:17.072 --> 00:43:17.813]  We're good to go.
[00:43:46.952 --> 00:43:51.737]  If you want the coin, it's exclusively available right now for a limited time at 1776coin.com.
[00:43:51.737 --> 00:43:53.018]  $30 off when you use promo code 1776.
[00:43:53.018 --> 00:43:54.059]  Thank you for your support.
[00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:03.233]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[00:44:03.233 --> 00:44:06.056]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[00:44:06.056 --> 00:44:08.779]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:10.060]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:13.963]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[00:44:13.963 --> 00:44:19.168]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[00:44:19.168 --> 00:44:21.771]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad.
[00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:33.959]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[00:44:33.959 --> 00:44:39.523]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[00:44:39.523 --> 00:44:45.087]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[00:44:45.307 --> 00:44:47.788]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[00:44:47.788 --> 00:44:50.510]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:51.971]  So go check out the store.
[00:44:51.971 --> 00:44:53.151]  Go support their store.
[00:44:53.151 --> 00:44:54.392]  Go support InfoWars.
[00:44:54.392 --> 00:44:56.033]  Leave a donation right now.
[00:44:56.033 --> 00:45:00.075]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[00:45:00.075 --> 00:45:03.437]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[00:45:03.437 --> 00:45:12.342]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections, to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[00:45:13.732 --> 00:45:21.196]  But, through Mother Nature, the Creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[00:45:21.196 --> 00:45:26.319]  And I gotta tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game-changer now.
[00:45:26.319 --> 00:45:28.701]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[00:45:28.701 --> 00:45:32.663]  It's M4 Wars Platinum, now exclusively available at 40% off at m4warsware.com.
[00:45:34.784 --> 00:45:46.388]  This is private labeled three of the top best sellers in the country right now, but it's exclusively available under the brand name and private label of InfoWars Platinum at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:46.388 --> 00:45:53.491]  It's HGH Boost Max, it's Pain MD, and it's 1776 Testosterone Boost.
[00:45:53.491 --> 00:45:58.633]  Yield it to yourself and your way of life and your well-being to try these out and fund the InfoWar.
[00:45:59.775 --> 00:46:01.977]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:46:01.977 --> 00:46:03.759]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[00:46:03.759 --> 00:46:05.821]  This is an information war.
[00:46:05.821 --> 00:46:10.526]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[00:46:10.526 --> 00:46:16.993]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms.
[00:46:17.453 --> 00:46:18.214]  We're good to go.
[00:46:39.025 --> 00:46:46.949]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[00:46:46.949 --> 00:46:49.291]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:51.112]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[00:46:51.112 --> 00:46:52.232]  We're going over the top.
[00:46:52.232 --> 00:46:53.753]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[00:46:53.753 --> 00:46:56.855]  So please go to m4wrestore.com and donate now!
[00:46:56.855 --> 00:46:57.475]  Donate now!
[00:46:57.475 --> 00:46:57.855]  Donate now!
[00:46:57.855 --> 00:46:58.396]  Donate now!
[00:46:58.396 --> 00:46:58.856]  Donate now!
[00:46:58.856 --> 00:47:01.558]  Donate now!
[00:47:01.558 --> 00:47:07.481]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:11.693 --> 00:47:14.576]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[00:47:14.576 --> 00:47:17.458]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:47:17.458 --> 00:47:20.401]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:47:20.401 --> 00:47:22.303]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[00:47:37.817 --> 00:47:41.939]  Yeah, well the good guys ain't losing now.
[00:47:41.939 --> 00:47:44.480]  And we're updating the site, adding a lot of new information.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:49.441]  Theconspiracyfact.info, that's the URL in the next 48 hours to share.
[00:47:49.441 --> 00:47:52.923]  Because they're blocking InfoWars, they're blocking Man.Video everywhere.
[00:47:52.923 --> 00:47:56.444]  But that site is a whole new site that has the live feeds and everything on it.
[00:47:56.444 --> 00:47:59.125]  They'll block that too and we'll just keep fighting to promote a new URL.
[00:47:59.465 --> 00:48:05.530]  We're never giving up, and we're actually having big victory right now, in our lifetimes, in live time.
[00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:11.756]  Even if we were losing, we'd keep fighting, because God's watching, and it's the right thing to do.
[00:48:11.756 --> 00:48:13.277]  Okay.
[00:48:13.277 --> 00:48:14.598]  Let's start getting to this.
[00:48:14.598 --> 00:48:24.307]  This first clip is the WEF event, saying, we will use mRNA to correct genetic mutations.
[00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:34.152]  And that's why they've blown up the whole authorization process and don't do animal testing now, which they started three years ago by executive action.
[00:48:34.152 --> 00:48:39.358]  Now they passed a bill last year in December, just a month ago, to legalize this here in the U.S.
[00:48:39.358 --> 00:48:41.801]  And it's all the agenda of the U.N.
[00:48:41.801 --> 00:48:43.143]  and the WEF.
[00:48:43.143 --> 00:48:44.024]  So here they are.
[00:48:44.785 --> 00:48:46.667]  Admitting that they're taking over your bodies.
[00:48:46.667 --> 00:48:47.988]  What did Klaus Schwab say?
[00:48:47.988 --> 00:48:50.410]  In the new revolution, we don't change the world.
[00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:51.851]  We change you.
[00:48:51.851 --> 00:48:53.672]  And what did Harari say last week?
[00:48:53.672 --> 00:48:56.114]  We're going to make the government force you to do it.
[00:48:56.114 --> 00:48:58.036]  We're going to make sure you do this for your own good.
[00:48:58.036 --> 00:49:02.520]  Here it is.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:02.740]  Clip 20.
[00:49:07.917 --> 00:49:25.062]  So this is a precision tool that now allows us to take this protein RNA complex and introduce it into cells or tissues to correct mutations at sites where we know there's a deleterious change in the genetic code.
[00:49:25.942 --> 00:49:29.385]  So I wanted to show you an example of how this can be utilized.
[00:49:29.385 --> 00:49:43.616]  This protein complex can actually be injected directly into fertilized eggs of a mouse and in the experiment you'll see we're targeting a gene that is responsible for the black coat color in mice.
[00:49:43.616 --> 00:49:51.983]  And so normally these mice have beautiful glossy black coats and once we make this targeted change we then implant these
[00:49:52.563 --> 00:49:52.924]  Edited
[00:50:10.325 --> 00:50:10.926]  Thank you so much.
[00:50:30.689 --> 00:50:37.919]  So this is a technology that's been very exciting over the last two and a half years to see this technology taking off.
[00:50:37.919 --> 00:50:40.703]  These are publications in the scientific literature.
[00:50:40.703 --> 00:50:47.252]  It's been sort of exponential growth of publications, people using this technology for all sorts of applications.
[00:50:48.113 --> 00:51:10.308]  And so some of these include making changes, targeted genetic changes in plants, in fungi, in animals that are important agriculturally, in animals that are important to us as pets, and also for, in thinking about human health, also to do things like make changes in stem cells, which are cells that can give rise to new organs.
[00:51:11.149 --> 00:51:18.300]  Also to make changes in animals that are important as models of human disease such as mice and monkeys.
[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:24.691]  And we think within the not too distant future it will be possible to actually use this technology to make changes in humans.
[00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:33.495]  And of course, they now in major studies admit that the mRNA vaccines do change the DNA in your cells, and it's passed on for generations.
[00:51:33.495 --> 00:51:37.899]  Of course, she lies and says it doesn't change any of the other genes, which they now admit it does.
[00:51:37.899 --> 00:51:41.702]  All lies from these criminals, and the first major thing they launched on us...
[00:51:43.103 --> 00:51:45.424]  Hurts us with spike protein and kills us
[00:52:01.911 --> 00:52:02.232]  We're good.
[00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:23.950]  We're good to go.
[00:52:37.244 --> 00:53:05.041]  You know, we've warned many times about health issues in the Global Risk Report over the last 15 years, from Ebola to, well, before Ebola, SARS and MERS, Ebola in 14-15, and as Adrian was saying, you know, that had an impact because there were organisations like the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Centre for Epidemic Preparedness put in place to help organisations like the World Health Organisation
[00:53:05.741 --> 00:53:06.161]  I think?
[00:53:21.391 --> 00:53:26.074]  There was some political challenges in the sense that not everybody wanted to listen to that.
[00:53:26.074 --> 00:53:29.116]  Very good advice from those organizations.
[00:53:29.116 --> 00:53:32.759]  But eventually, yes, we did get the vaccine development in place.
[00:53:32.759 --> 00:53:49.930]  We did see incredible collaboration in the pharmaceutical industry in particular to look through the long lists of drugs to see whether any of them would have some effect on reducing the symptoms of COVID-19.
[00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.011]  So I think the
[00:53:51.711 --> 00:53:53.693]  You know, all of that is still in place.
[00:53:53.693 --> 00:53:56.255]  Pandemics don't just come and go.
[00:53:56.255 --> 00:53:58.757]  They come and go and they come back again.
[00:53:58.757 --> 00:54:00.358]  And so we should be prepared for that.
[00:54:00.358 --> 00:54:03.340]  Of course, that's all lies.
[00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.182]  Other than the fact that they controlled the information.
[00:54:06.182 --> 00:54:07.083]  It didn't protect you.
[00:54:08.274 --> 00:54:10.336]  They blocked the therapeutics.
[00:54:10.336 --> 00:54:19.046]  But here's the UN official admits Google algorithm manipulates climate info, vaccine info, borders info, election info.
[00:54:19.046 --> 00:54:28.497]  Melissa Fleming, who is UN Undersecretary, UN Undersecretary General for Global Communications, made the remarks while speaking at the World Economic Forum.
[00:54:28.497 --> 00:54:28.978]  Here she is.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.585]  You know, we partnered with Google, for example.
[00:54:32.585 --> 00:54:40.102]  If you Google climate change, you will, at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources.
[00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:51.478]  We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled climate change, we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.
[00:54:51.478 --> 00:54:54.801]  So we're becoming much more proactive.
[00:54:54.801 --> 00:55:02.368]  We own the science and we think that the world should know it and the platforms themselves also do.
[00:55:02.368 --> 00:55:07.812]  But again, it's a huge, huge challenge that I think
[00:55:08.633 --> 00:55:13.536]  All sectors of society need to be very active in.
[00:55:13.536 --> 00:55:14.476]  We own the science.
[00:55:14.476 --> 00:55:16.597]  We own your body.
[00:55:16.597 --> 00:55:19.659]  We'll put you in a FEMA camp if you don't agree with us now in Australia and Canada.
[00:55:19.659 --> 00:55:23.061]  They're already arresting people that disagree with it.
[00:55:23.061 --> 00:55:25.342]  In fact, I have new footage that I meant to send to the crew.
[00:55:25.342 --> 00:55:27.423]  It was a big story up yesterday.
[00:55:27.423 --> 00:55:33.106]  So you guys go back through Sunday and Monday and print me the articles on InfoWars.
[00:55:34.191 --> 00:55:39.878]  Because we have the footage of a woman being murdered in Canada because she wouldn't wear a mask in the hospital.
[00:55:39.878 --> 00:55:42.821]  And they admitted to the coroner's report that she was asphyxiated.
[00:55:42.821 --> 00:55:45.043]  She was strangled to death.
[00:55:45.043 --> 00:55:49.929]  And the judge just threw the case out and said, well, that's just the way it is.
[00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:51.671]  So that's who these people are.
[00:55:53.607 --> 00:55:55.508]  Animal testing drugs for U.S.
[00:55:55.508 --> 00:55:58.450]  FDA approval no longer mandatory.
[00:55:58.450 --> 00:56:02.232]  Called the FDA modernization two-point bill, signed into law by U.S.
[00:56:02.232 --> 00:56:05.814]  President Joe Biden, saw support from Republicans and Democrats.
[00:56:05.814 --> 00:56:06.675]  Now no testing.
[00:56:06.675 --> 00:56:13.779]  It just goes directly to the public, and that's spun like it's an innovation.
[00:56:13.779 --> 00:56:16.721]  So it's not good to test this stuff on animals.
[00:56:16.721 --> 00:56:20.103]  Is it good to test it in a forced way on the people?
[00:56:21.072 --> 00:56:24.014]  All right, here's what's going to happen in the next hour.
[00:56:40.259 --> 00:56:50.764]  Also, more and more economists predict the world is headed for stagflation, not just inflation, and the majority of economists agree the world is in a recession.
[00:56:50.764 --> 00:57:01.389]  We've already been having multiple quarters of this, folks, so we are going into a worldwide depression, and we need to be honest about that and exactly what the central banks have done.
[00:57:02.776 --> 00:57:06.661]  We'll also look at how they're trying to stoke racial division in this country.
[00:57:06.661 --> 00:57:10.505]  Congress introduces a bill that criminalizes criticism of any non-white person.
[00:57:10.505 --> 00:57:22.159]  We'll look at Martin Luther King Day and this hideous new $15 million sculpture they unveiled in Boston that is Martin Luther King's wife holding what looks like a
[00:57:23.715 --> 00:57:27.136]  Two hundred foot long penis.
[00:57:27.136 --> 00:57:29.737]  So it's just all about flaunting it in our face.
[00:57:29.737 --> 00:57:33.239]  Got so much on the whole transgenderism cult front as well.
[00:57:33.239 --> 00:57:38.200]  Big second and third and fourth hours today ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:38.861]  Central.
[00:57:38.861 --> 00:57:39.761]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:39.761 --> 00:57:40.781]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[00:57:40.781 --> 00:57:41.722]  Don't forget that.
[00:57:41.722 --> 00:57:45.183]  Please share the links to InfoWars.com, Ford slash show, ConspiracyFact.info.
[00:57:50.376 --> 00:58:02.885]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[00:58:06.107 --> 00:58:15.934]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[00:58:15.934 --> 00:58:27.784]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[00:58:27.784 --> 00:58:29.305]  This is why they attack us.
[00:58:29.785 --> 00:58:32.329]  This is why we need your support.
[00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:34.131]  Because we tell the truth.
[00:58:34.131 --> 00:58:36.234]  Alex Jones was right.
[00:58:36.234 --> 00:58:38.737]  Join the resistance this Tuesday.
[00:58:38.737 --> 00:58:39.978]  All day long.
[00:58:39.978 --> 00:58:42.882]  The Alex Jones was right marathon.
[00:58:42.882 --> 00:58:45.245]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[00:58:45.245 --> 00:58:47.368]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[00:58:50.228 --> 00:58:56.390]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:09.373]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting InfoWarStore.com right now and taking action.
[00:59:09.373 --> 00:59:14.314]  I thank you for your past support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[00:59:14.754 --> 00:59:16.395]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[00:59:16.395 --> 00:59:18.676]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[00:59:18.676 --> 00:59:20.137]  They're coming for you and your family.
[00:59:20.137 --> 00:59:21.398]  They're coming for me.
[00:59:21.398 --> 00:59:22.639]  They're coming for the children.
[00:59:22.639 --> 00:59:25.200]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.582]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[00:59:28.582 --> 00:59:29.883]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[00:59:30.123 --> 00:59:32.224]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[00:59:32.224 --> 00:59:37.645]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two trimesters after these poison shots.
[00:59:37.645 --> 00:59:41.567]  We can and will save the children and they are counting on us.
[00:59:41.567 --> 00:59:42.767]  Let's do it together.
[00:59:42.767 --> 00:59:45.068]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[00:59:45.068 --> 00:59:48.889]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:59:48.889 --> 00:59:53.250]  Now take action now!
[00:59:53.250 --> 00:59:57.212]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:06.289 --> 01:00:19.176]  As we've discussed recently, the word occult means hidden, and the dark satanic occult which has been ruling over humanity maintains its power by hiding knowledge from the public.
[01:00:19.176 --> 01:00:31.343]  This hidden knowledge can be described as natural law or universal law, inescapable laws of reality that affect each and every one of us from moment to moment.
[01:00:32.123 --> 01:00:41.745]  They have been hidden from the public as a means of keeping humanity ignorant, and thereby controllable, and ultimately enslaved.
[01:00:41.745 --> 01:00:46.686]  So long as we remain ignorant of them, mankind will never be free.
[01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:56.528]  The etymology of the word apocalypse reveals its occulted meaning, which is to uncover or reveal something that was hidden.
[01:00:57.308 --> 01:01:05.456]  One can argue that the apocalypse already happened, and that we are now living in the post-apocalyptic world.
[01:01:05.456 --> 01:01:20.509]  In 1928, Manly P. Hall published The Secret Teachings of All Ages, a comprehensive introduction to all of this occulted knowledge which has been used to manipulate the ignorant masses of humanity for millennia.
[01:01:20.509 --> 01:01:23.372]  And while many people choose to educate themselves,
[01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:27.216]  Many others have chosen to remain ignorant.
[01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.578]  Ignorance is not bliss.
[01:01:29.578 --> 01:01:35.043]  It is the reason why humanity continues to fall deeper into bondage.
[01:01:35.043 --> 01:01:40.008]  These laws are fairly simple, and they can be found in every culture on Earth.
[01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:47.815]  In the Hermetic Sciences, revealed to the public in 1908, we have seven laws.
[01:01:47.815 --> 01:02:00.845]  The first three, Mentalism, Correspondence, and Vibration, teach us how everything is connected, that everything begins with our thoughts, and that everything in this reality is a frequency.
[01:02:00.845 --> 01:02:06.490]  You could say that we are all living within the mind of God, and our thoughts matter.
[01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:14.233]  The principle of polarity teaches us that things which appear to be opposites are actually related.
[01:02:14.233 --> 01:02:19.475]  Love and hate are merely polar opposites of the same thing.
[01:02:19.475 --> 01:02:25.358]  And knowing this makes it easier for us to transform our hate into love.
[01:02:25.358 --> 01:02:28.299]  It allows us to turn a negative into a positive.
[01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:33.965]  The principle of rhythm teaches that everything in nature has its rhythm.
[01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:39.611]  The measure of the swing to the right is equal to the measure of the swing to the left.
[01:02:39.611 --> 01:02:43.155]  This allows us to better navigate the waves of reality.
[01:02:44.016 --> 01:02:49.480]  The principle of cause and effect may be the most important to understand.
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:58.765]  Each and every one of our thoughts and corresponding actions in this life has an inescapable effect on everything around us.
[01:02:58.765 --> 01:03:08.412]  And the principle of gender teaches us that there are only two genders and that everything in this reality has its masculine and feminine aspects.
[01:03:09.372 --> 01:03:20.079]  One could argue that the apocalypse happened thousands of years ago with the Ten Commandments, the laws of how to liberate oneself from the land of slavery.
[01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:26.403]  These natural laws were taught in the East by the Buddha, who taught us of right action.
[01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:34.008]  And these natural laws were perhaps most eloquently simplified in the teachings of Christ with the Golden Rule.
[01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:39.533]  In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you.
[01:03:39.533 --> 01:03:42.175]  Do not take another person's life.
[01:03:42.175 --> 01:03:45.478]  Do not assault or rape another person.
[01:03:45.478 --> 01:03:51.483]  Do not steal another person's property and do not trespass upon them in any way.
[01:03:51.483 --> 01:03:55.067]  Do not coerce or manipulate another person.
[01:03:55.067 --> 01:03:59.671]  In the most simple terms, do not steal anything from anyone.
[01:04:00.352 --> 01:04:01.796]  Live and let live.
[01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:05.325]  This is the path to freedom.
[01:04:05.325 --> 01:04:08.734]  And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.
[01:04:09.813 --> 01:04:15.680]  Each and every one of us is affecting this reality with every thought and every action.
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:23.609]  And if we choose to remain ignorant of this, then we are choosing to be sheep, and we will always be enslaved.
[01:04:23.609 --> 01:04:30.857]  Understanding these natural laws and treating others with love and respect is the only way to true freedom.
[01:04:31.557 --> 01:04:36.920]  Today's politics is nothing other than fighting for your favorite prison guard.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:42.323]  Prison guards who will ultimately coerce you and trespass against you.
[01:04:42.323 --> 01:04:53.770]  True freedom comes from our actions because a society of ignorant and belligerent sheep deserve to be in prison and that will never change.
[01:04:53.770 --> 01:04:56.171]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:59.838 --> 01:05:01.800]  Infowars has made history.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.422]  You have made history by supporting Infowars.
[01:05:04.422 --> 01:05:07.624]  The globalists are being defeated on every front.
[01:05:07.624 --> 01:05:11.067]  And now is the time to not just sit on our laurels because we're winning battles.
[01:05:11.067 --> 01:05:12.608]  Let's win the war.
[01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:14.370]  The information war.
[01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:19.153]  There's nothing you can do more important than keeping Infowars on air in the fight for liberty.
[01:05:19.153 --> 01:05:20.955]  I don't think anybody denies that fact.
[01:05:21.235 --> 01:05:35.341]  And I thank you for your past support, but I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four-coin series, the Teddy Roosevelt Man of the Arena coin, exclusively at 1776coin.com.

[01:06:10.994 --> 01:06:17.459]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:17.459 --> 01:06:34.631]  Alright, Ed Zalouf, the man of rebel media, who's in Switzerland at the Globalist Confab Davos, the real people that run the planet, or who are trying to run the planet, the most powerful power block out there, he'll be joining us the last 30 minutes of the next hour, but I want to start going to your phone calls next segment.
[01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:51.759]  On the Deimos Group, on all the vaccine news coming out, on the politics that you see unfolding, on how they're getting ready to flush Joe Biden just like we said they would, and the whole system, including the Democratic Party, and not just people in the federal government, but the state governments turning against him.
[01:06:51.759 --> 01:06:53.519]  What do you see coming out of that?
[01:06:53.519 --> 01:06:55.440]  Does that concern you?
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:01.081]  And look, I'm happy to get rid of Biden, but he'll get the blame for the whole agenda, and then they'll put in their next group of puppets.
[01:07:02.182 --> 01:07:03.703]  Just like shark teeth.
[01:07:03.703 --> 01:07:06.566]  One group gets defeated, the next group rolls forward.
[01:07:06.566 --> 01:07:11.710]  I want to target, with the information, the controllers of the Democratic Party and the Deep State.
[01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:15.254]  But it's also a big part of the Republican Party as well.
[01:07:15.254 --> 01:07:17.976]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:07:17.976 --> 01:07:19.117]  We're taking first-time callers.
[01:07:19.117 --> 01:07:19.177]  877-789-2539.
[01:07:19.177 --> 01:07:20.799]  Now, I want to talk about this.
[01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:36.798]  I covered it last hour, but we should be thanking God and also I want to thank all of you for the action you've taken.
[01:07:36.798 --> 01:07:53.210]  I read to you the mainstream news headlines from all over the world that up to half of the attendees on the list are now announcing they're canceling and not going because Devos is rated as the most unpopular organization in the world.
[01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:55.112]  So in an ugly contest, they're the ugliest.
[01:07:56.397 --> 01:08:01.860]  Conversely, freedom and anti-globalism is extremely popular, so we're winning the hearts and minds.
[01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:14.106]  They may have stolen the money, they may have controlled the military, they may have controlled the propaganda, they may have controlled the borders, and they're certainly assaulting us, but humanity is coming roaring back.
[01:08:14.106 --> 01:08:16.548]  I'd like to talk about that with listeners.
[01:08:17.711 --> 01:08:23.214]  And the new system they're quote announcing, the Great Reset, they've gotten even more detailed about it.
[01:08:23.214 --> 01:08:30.957]  Sky News headline, why an absence of A-listers at Davos is not just deep trouble for the World Economic Forum, but for globalists too.
[01:08:30.957 --> 01:08:35.079]  And I can look at the body language of Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and tell you they're scared.
[01:08:35.079 --> 01:08:37.020]  They should be.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.881]  But more importantly I can tell you what's going on.
[01:08:40.165 --> 01:08:40.985]  They're controllers.
[01:08:40.985 --> 01:08:42.466]  There's people above them.
[01:08:42.466 --> 01:08:43.906]  They know it's not working.
[01:08:43.906 --> 01:08:54.290]  That's why Schwab just came out this weekend on the eve of the launch of this globalist corporate government, world government, confab.
[01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:54.950]  That's why.
[01:08:56.530 --> 01:09:00.072]  He came out and said, oh, we're going to restore trust in our meeting.
[01:09:00.072 --> 01:09:00.873]  You can trust us.
[01:09:00.873 --> 01:09:07.157]  We're going to fix all the problems that they literally have created or exacerbated.
[01:09:07.157 --> 01:09:08.057]  Toll-free number 877-789-2539.
[01:09:08.057 --> 01:09:08.398]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:09:08.398 --> 01:09:10.239]  There's the number on your screen for TV viewers.
[01:09:18.871 --> 01:09:20.652]  So your calls are coming up.
[01:09:20.652 --> 01:09:27.717]  But again, we can't just announce this on Friday and announce it on Saturday and talk about it on Sunday and forget about it.
[01:09:27.717 --> 01:09:30.019]  I'm going to play the clips again.
[01:09:30.019 --> 01:09:32.261]  I already played the new ones on Friday and Saturday and Sunday.
[01:09:32.261 --> 01:09:33.982]  I'm not going to play them again.
[01:09:33.982 --> 01:09:41.528]  But CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, ABC, NBC, CBS, all reporting
[01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:58.636]  That board members on the FDA are upset at the CDC and at Big Pharma for not telling them that they did quiet studies and found that the vaccines didn't work and that they were linked to heart attacks and strokes.
[01:09:58.636 --> 01:10:01.898]  How huge is that?
[01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:09.603]  And I wondered on Thursday and Friday as it started to break, I told you it was coming for months, I wondered how they'd respond and they had.
[01:10:11.053 --> 01:10:19.342]  All the usual suspects, while on one hand they admit it's happening on the same programs, and they have folks like Dan Abrams come out and say, it's a conspiracy.
[01:10:19.342 --> 01:10:20.543]  Nobody's been hurt.
[01:10:20.543 --> 01:10:21.504]  Take your shot.
[01:10:21.504 --> 01:10:22.265]  It's perfect.
[01:10:22.265 --> 01:10:23.346]  It's wonderful.
[01:10:23.346 --> 01:10:24.588]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:24.588 --> 01:10:32.716]  No, it's in the insurance company numbers that we have the highest increase in death the last two and a half years, since the shots, not COVID, the world's ever seen.
[01:10:33.871 --> 01:10:36.892]  Vietnam's every month worldwide.
[01:10:36.892 --> 01:10:40.414]  Vietnam's every six months or so in the U.S.
[01:10:40.414 --> 01:10:44.875]  Millions and millions and millions and millions of dead people.
[01:10:44.875 --> 01:10:51.018]  So it sounds negative to announce that, and it is, but at least we're not taking it lying down.
[01:10:51.018 --> 01:10:54.479]  At least it's all coming out.
[01:10:54.479 --> 01:11:01.822]  Absolutely incredible to be living in this day and time and watching all this.
[01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:06.532]  Now, the clip he does is really powerful.
[01:11:06.532 --> 01:11:07.713]  It's five and a half minutes long.
[01:11:07.713 --> 01:11:10.836]  So I'm going to play it at the start of the next segment.
[01:11:10.836 --> 01:11:13.139]  Who pulls the strings in Washington, D.C.?
[01:11:13.139 --> 01:11:15.241]  Matt Gaetz really goes deep.
[01:11:15.241 --> 01:11:17.424]  And this is so incredibly important.
[01:11:17.424 --> 01:11:22.069]  But since I mentioned that, let me go ahead and go over.
[01:11:23.837 --> 01:11:26.958]  This news, because this is big.
[01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:27.798]  Look at these headlines.
[01:11:27.798 --> 01:11:36.961]  FDA vaccine committee member calls for end to mass COVID vaccine, saying it's not supporting people and children shouldn't take it.
[01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:39.421]  Now, this is really sophisticated.
[01:11:39.421 --> 01:11:48.384]  Why did the SPARS document that came out two years before they launched this say they would do that by the beginning of the third year of the shot?
[01:11:48.384 --> 01:11:51.084]  Because they're going to kill a bunch of people they knew would kill you.
[01:11:51.084 --> 01:11:52.885]  Now they've got to act like it was a mistake.
[01:11:54.116 --> 01:11:54.476]  I don't
[01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:17.891]  We knew it was the war plan.
[01:12:17.891 --> 01:12:21.055]  And General Flynn looked at it after my analysis and said, yes.
[01:12:21.055 --> 01:12:22.076]  That's what the military does.
[01:12:22.076 --> 01:12:25.399]  And I'm not saying the military ran this, but it's a military-style operation.
[01:12:25.399 --> 01:12:32.887]  Is that they have war games, but when they actually launch a war, when they're sending their operatives out, they've got the war game on them, so they get caught.
[01:12:32.887 --> 01:12:33.929]  Oh, that's just a war game.
[01:12:33.929 --> 01:12:34.930]  It's not a war game.
[01:12:34.930 --> 01:12:35.851]  It's a battle plan.
[01:12:37.026 --> 01:12:42.232]  In the Spars document alone, there's addendums that are restricted, so we don't have the full document.
[01:12:42.232 --> 01:12:51.523]  They have hundreds of tweets written five years ago, two years before they released this stuff, where all they do is change the acronyms and a little bit of the tweet.
[01:12:51.523 --> 01:12:53.065]  The tweets are 60-70% the exact same words.
[01:12:57.304 --> 01:12:59.867]  Where, oh, it's safe and effective, you need to take it.
[01:12:59.867 --> 01:13:01.949]  Okay, it's 90% effective.
[01:13:01.949 --> 01:13:02.909]  It's 80% effective.
[01:13:02.909 --> 01:13:04.751]  It's 50% effective.
[01:13:04.751 --> 01:13:07.374]  And then, oh, people start to get mad at industry.
[01:13:07.374 --> 01:13:09.656]  People find out industry didn't do the test.
[01:13:09.656 --> 01:13:10.517]  People get mad.
[01:13:10.517 --> 01:13:16.523]  I mean, they've already war-gamed how to roll this out, break the system, discredit the government, implode society.
[01:13:16.523 --> 01:13:20.647]  It's a plan to make us blame the government.
[01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:21.978]  We're good to go.
[01:13:39.141 --> 01:13:43.804]  People understand what's happening and they understand they've already war-gamed how you're going to respond.
[01:13:43.804 --> 01:13:51.749]  But if you're aware of the war-game and how the card game's rigged or how the game is being manipulated, then they can't win.
[01:13:51.749 --> 01:14:02.116]  And my whole job has been like, one of the most hated groups out there in the world to magicians is the famous magicians that decide to go ahead and show you how the tricks work.
[01:14:02.116 --> 01:14:04.538]  But those are more interesting shows, aren't they?
[01:14:04.538 --> 01:14:05.499]  They go show you the trick.
[01:14:06.513 --> 01:14:09.995]  Then in slow motion, they show you how they did the trick.
[01:14:09.995 --> 01:14:13.497]  Those people are so hated by magicians.
[01:14:13.497 --> 01:14:25.282]  I love those people, because it's still cool to see the tricks, still cool to see the illusion, still really interesting to sit there and see your brain fooled, and then have somebody go, here's how we fooled you.
[01:14:25.282 --> 01:14:26.863]  That's what I do.
[01:14:26.863 --> 01:14:27.964]  That's what my guests do.
[01:14:27.964 --> 01:14:31.606]  That's our whole goal, is to get you to start noticing how the tricks work,
[01:14:32.532 --> 01:14:38.879]  And so you're not just going to be sitting there having them bombard you, having them brainwash you, have them control you.
[01:14:38.879 --> 01:14:40.822]  We're giving you the cheat sheet.
[01:14:40.822 --> 01:14:45.967]  We're giving you, and you're as smart as I am, once you figure this out, you'll see stuff we didn't see.
[01:14:45.967 --> 01:14:47.349]  You'll catch things we didn't catch.
[01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:49.952]  The best thing I do is check the M4's email.
[01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:51.754]  I don't have an M4's email because I get too many of them.
[01:14:51.754 --> 01:14:52.935]  I got rid of it over a decade ago.
[01:14:54.079 --> 01:14:55.581]  I get into the InfoWars email.
[01:14:55.581 --> 01:14:57.302]  I have them print me hundreds of them a day.
[01:14:57.302 --> 01:15:01.467]  And just the cool stuff you say, the comments on the website, the comments elsewhere.
[01:15:01.467 --> 01:15:05.431]  I mean, it's so thought-provoking how smart you are.
[01:15:05.431 --> 01:15:07.914]  And by the way, I'm not patronizing you.
[01:15:07.914 --> 01:15:14.461]  I learn so much from comments on YouTube, so much from comments on InfoWars, so much from comments on Bandai Video.
[01:15:14.461 --> 01:15:16.222]  I learn so much from letters we get in the mail.
[01:15:16.823 --> 01:15:27.787]  We're all sitting here with hundreds of letters, trying to read them each week, and I don't get to them all every time, I'm not going to lie to you, but man, the stuff you say, the insights you have, you're leaders.
[01:15:27.787 --> 01:15:33.289]  You understand what's going on, and you could be white, you could be black, you could be brown, it doesn't matter.
[01:15:34.568 --> 01:15:38.671]  You want freedom, you got red blood, and you see through this, so it's so exciting.
[01:15:38.671 --> 01:15:47.236]  So the Matt Gaetz clip is coming up, and then, your phone call, straight ahead at 877-789-2539.
[01:15:47.236 --> 01:15:59.403]  And remember, we have the new URL, they haven't blocked it yet, to share to some people, right to the show, conspiracyfact.info, conspiracyfact.info, conspiracyfact.
[01:15:59.403 --> 01:16:03.066]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance
[01:16:03.942 --> 01:16:14.608]  To get a historic signed copy of my number one best-selling book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:16:14.608 --> 01:16:26.835]  Yes, you can get the book in stores, you can find it online, but if you want to get a historic signed copy and be part of our fundraiser to stay on air, go to InfoWarsTore.com and go to the book section and get your signed book.
[01:16:27.475 --> 01:16:31.757]  There are only about a thousand of these left, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[01:16:31.757 --> 01:16:34.739]  I'm never going to sign the book again.
[01:16:34.739 --> 01:16:41.022]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later that's a piece of art that goes with the book, but I haven't even decided when I'm going to do that.
[01:16:41.022 --> 01:16:42.082]  It may never happen.
[01:16:42.082 --> 01:16:51.487]  But for just simple, straight-up signed books, and to be part of this fundraiser, this is the last time you'll be able to get the signed book at infowarrestore.com.
[01:16:51.887 --> 01:16:53.108]  I thank you all for your support.
[01:16:53.108 --> 01:16:56.289]  Please go to InfoWarsWare.com and get your signed book today.
[01:16:56.289 --> 01:16:59.310]  And I thank you for keeping us in the fight against the globalists.
[01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:03.831]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[01:17:03.831 --> 01:17:16.276]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:17:16.276 --> 01:17:17.457]  These are high-end.
[01:17:17.457 --> 01:17:18.537]  These are the very best.
[01:17:18.837 --> 01:17:21.319]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[01:17:21.319 --> 01:17:21.840]  Well guess what?
[01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:27.625]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:30.247]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:17:30.247 --> 01:17:37.153]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high quality full spectrum CBD.
[01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:41.918]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:42.338 --> 01:17:52.403]  The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:17:52.403 --> 01:17:54.384]  M4 Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com.
[01:17:59.628 --> 01:18:07.294]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[01:18:07.294 --> 01:18:09.356]  Because they know we're pro-human.
[01:18:09.356 --> 01:18:11.057]  They know we're telling the truth.
[01:18:11.057 --> 01:18:12.618]  They know we've got their number.
[01:18:12.618 --> 01:18:17.362]  They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[01:18:17.362 --> 01:18:19.944]  And God gave us, through Mother Nature, incredible compounds.
[01:18:20.484 --> 01:18:25.210]  That will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy and immune systems.
[01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:35.624]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglanone and so much more to supercharge your body.
[01:18:36.658 --> 01:18:37.459]  I'm good to go.
[01:18:59.997 --> 01:19:03.919]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[01:19:03.919 --> 01:19:12.784]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself, because it is a very strong, high-quality formula.
[01:19:12.784 --> 01:19:14.585]  Gallon-ounce sleep support.
[01:19:14.585 --> 01:19:15.365]  Liquid.
[01:19:15.365 --> 01:19:16.646]  It's very fast-acting.
[01:19:16.646 --> 01:19:17.866]  Take it under the tongue.
[01:19:17.866 --> 01:19:20.248]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin.
[01:19:20.948 --> 01:19:26.130]  Passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:32.513]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[01:19:32.513 --> 01:19:37.195]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[01:19:37.195 --> 01:19:39.676]  And we've got some other great sleep eggs as well, and they're excellent.
[01:19:39.676 --> 01:19:40.516]  They're all different formulas.
[01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:45.177]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[01:19:45.177 --> 01:19:50.459]  So Down and Out, sold out for more than five months, is now back available at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:19:50.459 --> 01:20:00.723]  So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system, and support the InfoWar with Down and Out Sleep Support at InfoWarstore.
[01:20:00.723 --> 01:20:06.605]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:13.345 --> 01:20:27.975]  We just gotta get conscious of the enemy programs.
[01:20:27.975 --> 01:20:31.097]  And then it's over for them.
[01:20:31.097 --> 01:20:36.081]  We can outthink them, we can defeat them, but they program us to do the same things over and over again.
[01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:38.562]  And they get into these ruts.
[01:20:39.617 --> 01:20:45.927]  We can't wake up, we can't come together, and we can't recognize who they are and stop them.
[01:20:45.927 --> 01:20:47.749]  They believe you're junk, they believe you're garbage.
[01:20:47.749 --> 01:20:50.714]  They believe you're going to roll over and die.
[01:20:50.714 --> 01:20:51.895]  Are you really going to do that?
[01:20:51.895 --> 01:20:54.339]  Are you going to promote the link conspiracyfact.info?
[01:20:57.472 --> 01:20:59.834]  And I'm going to give you a few tricks to get around the censors here.
[01:20:59.834 --> 01:21:01.415]  And I love the crew, they're great.
[01:21:01.415 --> 01:21:11.982]  I told them last week before we prepared this, I said, the image we send around to all of the guests that are going to come on, they're going to promote the show, and the listeners promote, should not have my face on it.
[01:21:11.982 --> 01:21:17.186]  They use AI to see my face, and they block it on Instagram and Twitter and everywhere.
[01:21:17.186 --> 01:21:19.347]  The promo has my face on it, and it's okay.
[01:21:19.347 --> 01:21:21.669]  Maybe if I talk about it on air, it won't.
[01:21:24.016 --> 01:21:26.257]  Everybody can create their own images to promote the show.
[01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:30.760]  Just say, forbidden information is being discussed live right now.
[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.961]  Follow this link and share this link.
[01:21:32.961 --> 01:21:36.083]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:21:36.083 --> 01:21:37.704]  Don't put my face on it.
[01:21:37.704 --> 01:21:38.964]  Don't put my name on it.
[01:21:38.964 --> 01:21:48.650]  We've done tests with Twitter accounts we work with where they get millions of views, routinely hundreds of thousands, but all the time millions, because we don't put Alex Jones
[01:21:49.915 --> 01:21:52.859]  In the thumbnail or Alex Jones's name on it.
[01:21:52.859 --> 01:21:56.825]  And I sit there and I tell everybody that we can beat the freaking AI.
[01:21:56.825 --> 01:22:00.851]  It ain't that smart.
[01:22:00.851 --> 01:22:03.034]  But we have to promote and that's why.
[01:22:03.936 --> 01:22:08.940]  What they really can't stop is the fact that everybody's duplicating my research information, which I want.
[01:22:08.940 --> 01:22:22.951]  Whether it's Dr. Robert Malone, or you name it, everybody gets I'm right now, everybody knows I've done the research, our guests have done the research, so everybody just takes our research now and does their own shows, and does their own research on top of it, and makes it even more informative, and that's great.
[01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:26.894]  And I'm almost to the point of being obsolete.
[01:22:26.894 --> 01:22:31.818]  Because so many people are going to be awake, so many people are going to get the information, and then I can bow out.
[01:22:32.762 --> 01:22:34.524]  And that's my goal.
[01:22:34.524 --> 01:22:36.126]  My goal is to disappear.
[01:22:36.126 --> 01:22:38.348]  But it's not this year, it's not next year.
[01:22:38.348 --> 01:22:39.430]  The fight is now.
[01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:44.175]  And our work is too important, it's too influential right now with everything we do.
[01:22:44.175 --> 01:22:50.062]  Right now, everything we do is having a bigger ripple effect ever in its history.
[01:22:51.385 --> 01:22:58.173]  And so, we're going to stay on air under massive attack at the most critical point to keep our information going forward.
[01:22:58.173 --> 01:23:01.037]  But we can't do it without your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[01:23:01.037 --> 01:23:02.899]  Go to infowarshpower.com right now.
[01:23:02.899 --> 01:23:03.760]  Please make a donation.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.902]  Get some of the great supplements.
[01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:07.405]  Get a signed copy or an unsigned copy of my book.
[01:23:07.405 --> 01:23:09.447]  But whatever you do, take action.
[01:23:10.268 --> 01:23:13.251]  And his listeners, when you promote the show, don't say Alex Jones.
[01:23:13.251 --> 01:23:15.693]  Say, hey, here's forbidden information on this topic.
[01:23:15.693 --> 01:23:16.614]  It's really powerful.
[01:23:16.614 --> 01:23:19.096]  I think you should check it out and send it to the URL.
[01:23:19.096 --> 01:23:22.479]  They're not blocking conspiracyfact.info.
[01:23:22.479 --> 01:23:23.400]  Then they'll block that.
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.101]  We'll give you a new URL.
[01:23:25.101 --> 01:23:26.222]  This is a war.
[01:23:26.222 --> 01:23:27.724]  It's not a game.
[01:23:27.724 --> 01:23:29.886]  But games operate the same.
[01:23:29.886 --> 01:23:31.607]  So you learn from each move.
[01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:35.050]  Here's Matt Gaetz on Tim Pool, who really pulls the strings in Washington, D.C.
[01:23:37.195 --> 01:23:47.980]  If you're part of the prevailing way of thinking, the national security state, the neoconservative worldview, there's an entire infrastructure there to build out your career.
[01:23:47.980 --> 01:23:50.441]  There are endowed professorships.
[01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:53.342]  There are think tanks that are ready to give you six-figure jobs.
[01:23:53.342 --> 01:23:55.983]  There's a career progression of jobs on the Hill.
[01:23:55.983 --> 01:23:58.784]  But if you think differently, you're kind of hunted.
[01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.145]  You're hunted, canceled.
[01:24:00.145 --> 01:24:01.765]  They do everything to compromise you.
[01:24:01.765 --> 01:24:03.346]  And if that doesn't work, they try to destroy you.
[01:24:04.466 --> 01:24:10.709]  There's a lot of compromise, especially in Washington, D.C., but how deep does the rabbit hole go?
[01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:19.072]  Because there's a lot of people talking about the deep state, the intelligence agencies having a lot of control, using a lot of extortion, special interest groups pulling the strings here.
[01:24:19.072 --> 01:24:24.494]  What's your understanding of how things really work in Washington, D.C., compared to what the average American kind of sees?
[01:24:24.494 --> 01:24:26.534]  Well, I think the most corrupt,
[01:24:29.503 --> 01:24:29.903]  for a
[01:24:59.823 --> 01:25:19.773]  These are the key lobbyists that round up the defense money, and they put you with them from the very beginning, and you sort of get the joke that if you give your vote card to the leadership and your calendar to the lobby corps, you just kind of get enveloped into a system that's there to nurture you and protect you and keep you out of harm's way, and all it costs you is your own belief set.
[01:25:19.773 --> 01:25:22.394]  And I don't think that's compromise so much as selling out.
[01:25:24.435 --> 01:25:25.416]  Step one.
[01:25:25.416 --> 01:25:29.898]  And that catches a whole lot of the people who get here.
[01:25:29.898 --> 01:25:49.547]  And then beyond that, if you kind of resist that system, then they do try to extort you, engage in anything they can do to compromise you, cancel you, find some joke that you liked on Instagram years ago that like doesn't fit with the mores of this time, find some email that you are on like the forward chain of,
[01:25:49.947 --> 01:25:50.047]  It's
[01:26:04.757 --> 01:26:11.401]  Many, many dollars lined up solely for the extermination of those who push back against the narrative.
[01:26:11.401 --> 01:26:17.084]  Yeah, this is detailed extensively in books like The Economic Hitman that I think are definitely worth reading and checking out here.
[01:26:17.084 --> 01:26:25.309]  But talking to previous members of Congress, it's really kind of daunting to see what they have to go through, how much pressure they have to go through, how much agreement they have to
[01:26:25.769 --> 01:26:26.310]  I agree.
[01:26:49.252 --> 01:26:52.915]  You know, part of you wants to say, screw you, or like, are you wearing a wire?
[01:26:52.915 --> 01:26:59.100]  If I could ask you, and again, you don't have to answer this, but who do you think is more influential and powerful in Washington, D.C.?
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:02.123]  The lobbyists or the intelligence agencies?
[01:27:02.123 --> 01:27:05.445]  Well, I mean, the answer to the question is yes, they're one and the same.
[01:27:05.445 --> 01:27:12.291]  Because oftentimes they are fused with precisely the same personnel, where people will roll out of
[01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:13.472]  We're good to go.
[01:27:37.378 --> 01:27:49.954]  So they literally have a place in their law firm where they can try to convert political dirt into intelligence investigations, counterintelligence investigations, criminal investigations, and the like.
[01:27:49.954 --> 01:27:51.175]  And let's not forget all the Epstein cases.
[01:27:51.175 --> 01:27:52.196]  And it's up and running today.
[01:27:52.196 --> 01:27:53.358]  It's up and running today.
[01:27:53.678 --> 01:27:55.740]  And they have all the Epstein tapes too, but that's another thing.
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:28:01.265]  Do you have any hope in the Jim Jordan new committee when it comes to investigating the weaponization of government?
[01:28:01.265 --> 01:28:04.368]  Do you think that's going to be akin to maybe a church committee?
[01:28:04.368 --> 01:28:17.721]  Yeah, that's our objective, and the specific agreement we have with McCarthy is that that select committee will have the budget, resources, personnel, no less than the Democrats' January 6th committee.
[01:28:19.298 --> 01:28:19.818]  Well, what do you think?
[01:28:19.818 --> 01:28:21.840]  Do you think it'll work out?
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:30.328]  Look, it's hard to promise outcomes when we don't have the ability to throw handcuffs on anybody or put anybody in jail, right?
[01:28:30.328 --> 01:28:33.090]  All we can do is expose facts.
[01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:36.933]  And so it relies on other features of our system to kind of
[01:28:37.934 --> 01:28:40.597]  Go end to end on that accountability.
[01:28:40.597 --> 01:28:46.063]  And so I don't want to promise people like, yeah, you know, you're going to see Hunter Biden hauled off in cuffs.
[01:28:46.063 --> 01:28:51.449]  You're going to see the Joe Biden, University of Penn, like China money laundering stuff.
[01:28:51.449 --> 01:28:58.296]  And, you know, because that may be out there, but it may not result in precisely what people would hope.
[01:29:08.499 --> 01:29:10.881]  What if you had the plans to the Death Star?
[01:29:10.881 --> 01:29:14.163]  What if you knew the globalist operations that could stop it?
[01:29:14.163 --> 01:29:15.624]  Well, we've done the research.
[01:29:15.624 --> 01:29:18.306]  We've got the number one best-selling book in the country.
[01:29:18.306 --> 01:29:20.408]  Not just in politics, but period.
[01:29:20.408 --> 01:29:22.129]  It's the great reset in the world.
[01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:24.311]  And you get a signed copy of this, the last 1,400.
[01:29:24.311 --> 01:29:26.773]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:29:26.773 --> 01:29:27.713]  Please take action.
[01:29:27.713 --> 01:29:29.835]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[01:29:29.835 --> 01:29:35.179]  Get one of these signed copies and know you kept InfoWars on the air at the most critical juncture in our history.
[01:29:35.499 --> 01:29:39.463]  Again, 2023 is here, the last run of signed copies of the book.
[01:29:39.463 --> 01:29:43.848]  We also have unsigned copies as well, but signed copies are limited and are about to run out.
[01:29:43.848 --> 01:29:45.550]  Thank you for your support.
[01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:48.533]  Again, get yours at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:29:58.399 --> 01:30:01.981]  It's your last chance to own a piece of real history.
[01:30:01.981 --> 01:30:04.583]  Your support of Infowars has made history.
[01:30:04.583 --> 01:30:09.405]  We've had the most devastating effects against the globalists and their whole agenda is in deep trouble.
[01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:12.467]  But now it's more important for us to stay on air than ever.
[01:30:12.467 --> 01:30:15.589]  And if you don't support us, we will shut down.
[01:30:15.589 --> 01:30:17.330]  I am asking you from the bottom of my heart,
[01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:31.078]  To commit even harder to the support you've given to this fight and to go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get one of the last signed copies of The Great Reset and The War for the World, my number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:30:31.078 --> 01:30:34.880]  You can buy the unsigned book at InfoWars, you can buy it at Amazon, buy it anywhere.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:47.188]  But if you want to get the signed copy and be part of a fundraiser to keep us on air at this critical point, you want to answer our bat signal, please go to InfoWarsTore.com and get your signed copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World right now.
[01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:54.372]  I want to thank all of you that did get signed copies, and I want to encourage those of you that didn't to take action now, and please keep us on air.
[01:30:54.372 --> 01:30:55.333]  Thank you so much.
[01:30:55.333 --> 01:30:58.214]  Please take action.
[01:30:58.214 --> 01:31:05.819]  Like a rock thrown into a pond, your actions, even though they may seem little, have a massive ripple effect throughout time and space.
[01:31:05.819 --> 01:31:07.420]  We're actually winning the Info Award.
[01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:14.504]  And when you realize that Bandot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts,
[01:31:14.864 --> 01:31:15.144]  We're good.
[01:31:29.861 --> 01:31:30.441]  We're good to go.
[01:32:00.408 --> 01:32:05.293]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[01:32:05.293 --> 01:32:11.698]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[01:32:11.698 --> 01:32:16.843]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[01:32:16.843 --> 01:32:18.544]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[01:32:18.544 --> 01:32:24.970]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we have this success.
[01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:31.111]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[01:32:31.111 --> 01:32:35.252]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[01:32:35.252 --> 01:32:44.594]  And that's why, today, it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[01:32:44.594 --> 01:32:46.014]  God bless you all.
[01:32:46.014 --> 01:32:47.055]  I salute you.
[01:32:47.055 --> 01:32:47.915]  I thank you.
[01:32:47.915 --> 01:32:53.536]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:32:54.136 --> 01:32:55.497]  The fight is my fight.
[01:32:55.497 --> 01:32:56.138]  It's your fight.
[01:32:56.138 --> 01:32:56.879]  It's our fight.
[01:32:56.879 --> 01:33:00.922]  God bless you all.
[01:33:00.922 --> 01:33:15.475]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:15.475 --> 01:33:20.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.714 --> 01:33:25.896]  When I say I've got huge news, I've got hundreds of huge stories.
[01:33:25.896 --> 01:33:37.963]  I'm going to hit a few of them right now, briefly, and then go right to Jeff and Mark and Michael and Dave and Brent and Clem and Ken and Jeremiah and Ben and Carol and others.
[01:33:37.963 --> 01:33:43.946]  But I want to just clarify what I was complaining about last segment, and I'm not mad at the crew, it's just we're up against AI.
[01:33:43.946 --> 01:33:48.289]  I said, hey, for the promo, and what we're going to send out as a promo image,
[01:33:49.465 --> 01:33:51.987]  We don't want an image of me, and we don't want my name on it.
[01:33:51.987 --> 01:33:59.152]  Just say Alex was right, not Alex Jones was right, because the AI sees that and blocks it on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, everything.
[01:33:59.152 --> 01:34:08.198]  And then people started trying to promote the image that pops up, not on the site, but the image that feeds when you send the link out.
[01:34:08.198 --> 01:34:09.339]  And what does Instagram do?
[01:34:09.339 --> 01:34:09.940]  Here it is.
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:11.521]  This just got sent to us.
[01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:14.143]  We checked it, it's happening.
[01:34:14.143 --> 01:34:15.444]  InfoWarsRedAlert put out
[01:34:16.388 --> 01:34:20.449]  A link to ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:34:20.449 --> 01:34:21.749]  That's ConspiracyFact.info.
[01:34:21.749 --> 01:34:24.930]  It's on screen if you're a TV viewer.
[01:34:24.930 --> 01:34:26.970]  And they said, false information.
[01:34:26.970 --> 01:34:30.031]  The same information was reviewed by independent fact checkers.
[01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:32.212]  Deep State CIA.
[01:34:32.212 --> 01:34:35.512]  The same information was reviewed by independent ADL fact checkers.
[01:34:35.512 --> 01:34:36.633]  Yeah.
[01:34:36.633 --> 01:34:42.374]  It actually says, the same information was reviewed by independent fact checkers in another post.
[01:34:42.374 --> 01:34:42.914]  See why.
[01:34:45.034 --> 01:34:47.335]  And they divert you over here to hear I'm a big liar.
[01:34:47.335 --> 01:34:50.616]  All it is is a page saying our free speech is under attack.
[01:34:50.616 --> 01:34:52.576]  We're doing a marathon broadcast tomorrow.
[01:34:52.576 --> 01:34:53.877]  Tell everybody you know, tune in.
[01:34:53.877 --> 01:34:56.457]  And they tell you that's false information.
[01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:59.398]  No, they're the ones that lie on purpose.
[01:34:59.398 --> 01:35:03.280]  And it's because the AI sees my face, sees my name.
[01:35:05.865 --> 01:35:11.826]  We're going to put an image on the page, ConspiracyFact.info, that doesn't have my face or InfoWars on it.
[01:35:11.826 --> 01:35:16.327]  You can say, forbidden information is happening right now that will affect the future of the world.
[01:35:16.327 --> 01:35:19.987]  Please tune in and tell others, share this link, and tell them to share it.
[01:35:19.987 --> 01:35:21.148]  And tell them to share it.
[01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:25.708]  See, it's them, tell them, tell them, tell them, tell everybody that shares it, tell them to share it.
[01:35:25.708 --> 01:35:30.869]  And that is what human power can do to override the algorithm.
[01:35:30.869 --> 01:35:35.030]  Now, let me give you some of the news we've got here, then I'll go to your calls.
[01:35:39.013 --> 01:35:59.723]  I've been critical of Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, because he'll send some National Guard down with guns standing there, it's a photo op, and they have no power because the federal government's there with NGOs and the UN taking the illegals and shipping them all over the country.
[01:35:59.723 --> 01:36:05.246]  So all our military does, whether it's the feds that send them or whether it's the governor that sends them on the border,
[01:36:06.596 --> 01:36:09.198]  is direct the people into the United States.
[01:36:09.198 --> 01:36:13.881]  We have to go after the UN NGOs that Biden two years ago put in charge of it.
[01:36:13.881 --> 01:36:15.102]  That's completely illegal.
[01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:17.364]  We've done whole shows on that.
[01:36:17.364 --> 01:36:21.346]  And finally, the governor's opened a criminal investigation in Texas into the NGOs.
[01:36:21.346 --> 01:36:24.889]  Yes, that's the answer.
[01:36:24.889 --> 01:36:29.092]  But here's a story just now breaking out of town hall.
[01:36:29.092 --> 01:36:31.193]  Now listen to this.
[01:36:31.193 --> 01:36:33.175]  Biden's DHS launches app
[01:36:34.338 --> 01:36:34.658]  I think?
[01:36:51.849 --> 01:37:06.889]  Are people to load them on buses, trains, and planes, and vans, and cars, to be shipped all over the country, to be given new identities, and signed up in sweatshops, and signed up to work as slaves, and the Democrats take the money off the top, and sign them up for welfare.
[01:37:06.889 --> 01:37:07.931]  That's what's going on!
[01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:12.469]  And finally Breitbart gets it.
[01:37:12.469 --> 01:37:14.270]  Finally people are reporting on this.
[01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:15.671]  And that's what's so frustrating.
[01:37:15.671 --> 01:37:18.113]  I don't want to be the one always breaking this.
[01:37:18.113 --> 01:37:19.734]  I want to be made obsolete.
[01:37:19.734 --> 01:37:25.439]  I don't want to have the responsibility to work seven days a week fighting this.
[01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:29.081]  I want to see people realize what's going on and get involved.
[01:37:29.081 --> 01:37:36.127]  Biden's Department of Homeland Security launched a mobile app that allows illegal immigrants to schedule appointments
[01:37:37.284 --> 01:37:38.025]  We're good to go.
[01:38:02.264 --> 01:38:05.886]  But Homeland Security's watching and controlling you.
[01:38:05.886 --> 01:38:09.067]  So, you see the photo ops.
[01:38:09.067 --> 01:38:10.808]  I had some friends and family in town yesterday.
[01:38:10.808 --> 01:38:12.689]  They wanted to see the Texas Capitol.
[01:38:12.689 --> 01:38:16.670]  So we went down there and they had all these guys with assault rifles standing around, guarding it.
[01:38:16.670 --> 01:38:22.693]  And it was all just theater for the governor's inauguration.
[01:38:22.693 --> 01:38:24.974]  As if terrorists are going to attack.
[01:38:24.974 --> 01:38:26.395]  Oh look, the government's powerful.
[01:38:26.395 --> 01:38:31.217]  They've got guns.
[01:38:31.217 --> 01:38:31.597]  And really,
[01:38:32.461 --> 01:38:39.667]  All the Border Patrol and all the military do is drive around picking up illegals that pour across these neighborhoods.
[01:38:39.667 --> 01:38:45.111]  By the way, this very neighborhood you're seeing, I've been in that one on the border.
[01:38:45.111 --> 01:38:50.495]  And that's all they do is pick them up and deliver them to where they're going.
[01:38:50.495 --> 01:38:53.818]  And now they're telling them, stop running, we'll just let you in.
[01:38:57.008 --> 01:39:02.530]  We don't want politically incorrect footage of guys on horseback grabbing Haitians.
[01:39:02.530 --> 01:39:03.550]  Just come here.
[01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:04.770]  The border's open.
[01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:05.511]  Let's be honest.
[01:39:05.511 --> 01:39:07.511]  It's open.
[01:39:07.511 --> 01:39:08.752]  That's the policy.
[01:39:08.752 --> 01:39:09.532]  It's illegal.
[01:39:09.532 --> 01:39:10.952]  It's allowing human trafficking.
[01:39:10.952 --> 01:39:11.933]  It needs to stop.
[01:39:11.933 --> 01:39:14.154]  The impeachment of Joe Biden should begin.
[01:39:14.154 --> 01:39:15.474]  But they don't want an impeachment.
[01:39:16.781 --> 01:39:18.542]  Alex, thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:39:18.542 --> 01:39:23.725]  I am a baby to InfoWars and I'm calling because I want you to know the impact that you have on your listeners.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:49.341]  I didn't know you existed until about four weeks ago.
[01:39:49.341 --> 01:39:55.564]  I consumed my information through the likes of Sean Hannity, Dan Bongino, and Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:55.564 --> 01:40:07.429]  Somebody must have mentioned your name, and out of curiosity, I went online, and I found you, and I found InfoWars, and I started watching, and I'll be honest, the first couple of days I watched you, I thought you were crazy.
[01:40:07.429 --> 01:40:12.852]  But you were so convicted in what you were saying, and your presentation is so compelling.
[01:40:13.499 --> 01:40:22.622]  And then you started playing videos, and the camera is zooming down onto your desk, and you're seeing articles, you're showing articles, you're backing up everything that you're saying.
[01:40:22.622 --> 01:40:24.403]  And so I continued to watch.
[01:40:24.403 --> 01:40:38.608]  And I will never forget the day that you red-pilled me was when you played the clip from the X-Files, and my jaw hit the floor, and suddenly I was Neo, waking up on the other Kinezer, realizing that everything I thought I knew, I didn't.
[01:40:38.608 --> 01:40:42.590]  And so now I watch you every day, I watch repeats of you every day,
[01:40:43.109 --> 01:40:45.331]  I've sent links to friends and family.
[01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:53.978]  Last week was the first time I received my first shipment from InfoWarsStore.com, and so I'm hooked, and I want to finish with this.
[01:40:53.978 --> 01:40:56.140]  I know you like to keep these concise.
[01:40:56.140 --> 01:41:03.346]  We as listeners cannot imagine the spirit of oppression at times that must be on you, the weight that you carry on your shoulders.
[01:41:03.346 --> 01:41:10.952]  You're a cross between John the Baptist and Paul Revere trying to warn all of us, and I'm sure that it's exhausting at times, and I want you to know
[01:41:11.451 --> 01:41:20.439]  That for me personally, I'm somebody whose eyes you opened, whose heart that you touched, and whose mind that you've awakened.
[01:41:20.439 --> 01:41:25.084]  And I pray that God blesses you, and that God blesses InfoWars.
[01:41:25.084 --> 01:41:26.025]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:41:26.025 --> 01:41:30.489]  Well, don't hang up, because we've got another minute to break, and I'm going to finish with the other callers next segment.
[01:41:30.489 --> 01:41:34.432]  But listen, what's exhausting is I know the next part of their plan.
[01:41:34.432 --> 01:41:35.774]  More bioweapon releases.
[01:41:36.354 --> 01:41:38.176]  More control, totally collapse borders.
[01:41:38.176 --> 01:41:39.016]  I have children.
[01:41:39.016 --> 01:41:42.619]  I am literally desperate to stop this because we're all in this together.
[01:41:42.619 --> 01:41:44.200]  But I appreciate your support.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:47.783]  But once people know the truth, Jeff, they can't do anything but fight.
[01:41:47.783 --> 01:41:48.404]  And I get it.
[01:41:48.404 --> 01:41:56.470]  The truth is crazy that they had a $15 million new Martin Luther King sculpture that's a giant 80-foot penis.
[01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:57.371]  I mean, who could make it?
[01:41:57.371 --> 01:41:59.413]  It sounds insane till you go see it.
[01:42:00.093 --> 01:42:19.169]  It's like it sounds insane they have convicted pedophiles running drag queen story time funded by Disney, but it's It's happening and and absolutely that X-Files thing that Chris Carter put out in 2016 where it describes the whole virus release the lockdowns it erasing our immune system
[01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:28.519]  I didn't realize how important that was at the time, even though Chris Carter said it was based on my show, influenced by my show, and the character that was saying it was based on me.
[01:42:28.519 --> 01:42:31.903]  I didn't get what he was getting from my show and how powerful it was.
[01:42:31.903 --> 01:42:33.624]  So you're not the only one waking up.
[01:42:33.624 --> 01:42:34.786]  Thank you, brother.
[01:42:34.786 --> 01:42:36.507]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:42:36.507 --> 01:42:38.409]  All right, we're going to come back with more calls.
[01:42:38.409 --> 01:42:39.530]  I've gotten to one call.
[01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:40.291]  I get started slow.
[01:42:41.112 --> 01:42:44.477]  I'll take five calls, next segment, straight ahead.
[01:42:44.477 --> 01:42:46.880]  But yes, we've had too big an effect.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:47.821]  I'm exhausted.
[01:42:47.821 --> 01:42:48.562]  I want to give up.
[01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:49.744]  I want to go off air.
[01:42:49.744 --> 01:42:51.666]  But I have a responsibility not to.

[01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:20.710]  We were listeners.
[01:44:20.710 --> 01:44:21.911]  The owner's a fan.
[01:44:21.911 --> 01:44:24.534]  And they've given us this huge deal off of retail.

[01:46:07.537 --> 01:46:17.699]  And when you realize that BandDot Video has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors and investigative journalists and talk show hosts whose information is beyond incredible.
[01:46:17.699 --> 01:46:23.420]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists, all of them, right now, telling the truth at BandDot Video.
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:25.601]  Millions of people a day visiting BandDot Video.
[01:46:25.981 --> 01:46:35.565]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect, and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[01:46:35.565 --> 01:46:38.127]  You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[01:46:38.127 --> 01:46:41.288]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:46:41.288 --> 01:46:46.530]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:53.934]  So I thank you all for your past action, and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now, because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:47:00.822 --> 01:47:05.464]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:05.464 --> 01:47:14.169]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:14.169 --> 01:47:18.911]  We're in a fight to not just educate those that are already awake, but to reach out to other people.
[01:47:18.911 --> 01:47:20.732]  That's the war.
[01:47:20.732 --> 01:47:21.833]  Michael in New York.
[01:47:21.833 --> 01:47:22.493]  Thanks for holding.
[01:47:22.493 --> 01:47:23.173]  You're on the air.
[01:47:23.173 --> 01:47:25.434]  Welcome.
[01:47:25.434 --> 01:47:26.535]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[01:47:26.535 --> 01:47:28.036]  I just want to talk about all the
[01:47:29.062 --> 01:47:31.243]  The carnage I'm seeing from the shots personally.
[01:47:31.243 --> 01:47:34.624]  My step-mom got diagnosed with cancer.
[01:47:34.624 --> 01:47:37.285]  My brother's mother-in-law cancer.
[01:47:37.285 --> 01:47:43.007]  My father got some like radiation burns, but he just can't put two and two together.
[01:47:43.007 --> 01:47:44.888]  He's on five shots.
[01:47:44.888 --> 01:47:48.869]  And so I'm watching all these different things happen.
[01:47:48.869 --> 01:47:52.190]  I'm watching the clots, the fiber blood clots.
[01:47:52.190 --> 01:47:56.692]  And then when Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was a diagnostic system,
[01:47:57.466 --> 01:47:58.486]  I did some research.
[01:47:58.486 --> 01:48:04.928]  I looked up, and sure enough, the mRNA came up as radio-labeled.
[01:48:04.928 --> 01:48:10.629]  The definition, any material bound to a radioactive substance.
[01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:17.150]  So, all these symptoms that we're seeing, the myocarditis, is right on par with radiation thickness.
[01:48:17.150 --> 01:48:18.431]  And that's what they did.
[01:48:19.864 --> 01:48:20.344]  We're good to go.
[01:48:36.641 --> 01:48:37.281]  You're absolutely right.
[01:48:55.237 --> 01:49:04.024]  I focus on the myocarditis and the heart attacks because that's the most obvious, but the cancers and remissions and other cancers exploding is bigger than the heart attacks.
[01:49:04.024 --> 01:49:08.788]  This is definitely like miracle growth for cancer.
[01:49:08.788 --> 01:49:12.431]  Yeah, well actually if you look at it, what it is, it's radiation poisoning.
[01:49:12.431 --> 01:49:23.220]  All you have to do is look up mRNA radiolabeled and then you can go back to the 1950s where the original use was to study how amoeba is correlated with the DNA and
[01:49:24.088 --> 01:49:26.009]  It was all from a whole gecko.
[01:49:26.009 --> 01:49:29.491]  It was always a diagnostic system using radiation.
[01:49:29.491 --> 01:49:33.313]  It was always radio labeled, which means that... Sure, sure, sure, sure.
[01:49:33.313 --> 01:49:37.255]  They put the trace elements in you, then they use 5G and other systems to scan what's going on.
[01:49:37.255 --> 01:49:41.537]  And it's not just Netanyahu admitting he turned all Israelis into guinea pigs.
[01:49:41.537 --> 01:49:46.179]  I played clips earlier where the WF says, we're testing on everybody now.
[01:49:46.179 --> 01:49:47.580]  We don't test on animals.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:48.760]  We test on you.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:50.041]  How damn criminal is that?
[01:49:51.637 --> 01:49:57.742]  It's really unbelievable, but we have a chance right now if we get out into the public that this is really... I agree with you.
[01:49:57.742 --> 01:50:02.825]  What do you think of all the people coming out against him and the board saying they were lied to?
[01:50:02.825 --> 01:50:06.168]  Looks like a lot of people are turning against the system inside the system.
[01:50:07.045 --> 01:50:17.255]  Well, we can't get caught up in anything right now other than treating people, because we have a chance to expose this, and if it is radiation thickness, there is a way to treat people.
[01:50:17.255 --> 01:50:18.976]  And we could save billions of people.
[01:50:18.976 --> 01:50:20.638]  If not, we are in big trouble.
[01:50:20.638 --> 01:50:21.519]  All right, all right.
[01:50:21.519 --> 01:50:22.460]  I appreciate your call, Michael.
[01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:30.747]  I think what you're saying is the metal compounds that cause chain reactions
[01:50:31.834 --> 01:50:35.477]  The graphene oxide you're saying is resonating and we know in studies it does.
[01:50:35.477 --> 01:50:35.977]  I don't know.
[01:50:35.977 --> 01:50:37.719]  Overall, I'd say that's what's causing the sickness.
[01:50:37.719 --> 01:50:44.805]  It's the spike protein, but definitely this is a major test that they've well-tested out and they know it's poisonous and it's out of control.
[01:50:44.805 --> 01:50:46.086]  Brett in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:50:46.086 --> 01:50:47.947]  Go ahead.
[01:50:47.947 --> 01:50:48.608]  Hey, Alex.
[01:50:48.608 --> 01:50:49.969]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:50:49.969 --> 01:50:52.391]  I'm a listener and supporter of your show.
[01:50:52.391 --> 01:50:55.814]  I'd like to encourage everybody... Thank you, but back off your phone or get closer.
[01:50:55.814 --> 01:50:57.716]  Something's happening.
[01:50:57.716 --> 01:50:58.576]  Can you hear me better, Alex?
[01:51:00.635 --> 01:51:08.858]  Okay, so I'd like to encourage everybody to buy your products at InfoWars.com and thank you for everything you do.
[01:51:08.858 --> 01:51:12.700]  I'm getting ready to have my first child with an amazing woman.
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:20.163]  She's due next month and I'm a little concerned about what the doctors might try to pump into her.
[01:51:20.163 --> 01:51:23.904]  I didn't know if you had any advice, if there's anything I need to avoid.
[01:51:23.904 --> 01:51:26.145]  Just any advice you could give me would be great, Alex.
[01:51:26.667 --> 01:51:39.960]  Well, I'm not a doctor, but a lot of women have issues because of lack of iodine, lack of trace elements and minerals, and obviously just find a hospital that's highly rated by the Liberty Movement for not trying to force shots.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:42.223]  Let the doctors know you're informed up front.
[01:51:42.223 --> 01:51:43.644]  I would not go to a city hospital.
[01:51:44.565 --> 01:51:47.147]  Or any of the biggest hospitals in your area.
[01:51:47.147 --> 01:51:49.509]  That's going to have to be your own research.
[01:51:49.509 --> 01:51:53.432]  But they're trying to push these shots on pregnant women.
[01:51:53.432 --> 01:51:56.775]  But the worms already turned to say, look, I know nobody's taking it.
[01:51:56.775 --> 01:51:57.876]  I know there's a huge backlash.
[01:51:57.876 --> 01:51:59.377]  So stop thinking I'm stupid.
[01:51:59.377 --> 01:52:00.758]  Move on to the next person.
[01:52:00.758 --> 01:52:11.407]  But if they're pushing shots on your wife, or, you know, six, seven, eight mammograms, or excuse me, sonograms, she only needs maybe one or two towards the end.
[01:52:11.407 --> 01:52:13.929]  I would not, I would not go to a hospital that's doing that.
[01:52:15.757 --> 01:52:17.158]  Okay, I appreciate that.
[01:52:17.158 --> 01:52:23.680]  I didn't know if there was any kind of vaccine they're going to try to give the child after she's born.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:26.121]  But listen, up to half their patients aren't taking the shots.
[01:52:26.121 --> 01:52:28.601]  So act like you've got five heads and you're a weirdo.
[01:52:28.601 --> 01:52:31.362]  Just say, we're not taking any of these shots.
[01:52:31.362 --> 01:52:33.743]  And they go, oh, the hepatitis we recommend.
[01:52:33.743 --> 01:52:36.944]  Only if you're an intravenous drug user having anal sex.
[01:52:36.944 --> 01:52:39.665]  Why would a baby need the dangerous hepatitis shot?
[01:52:39.665 --> 01:52:41.786]  Say, we're not taking any of the shots.
[01:52:41.786 --> 01:52:43.046]  And don't act like you're intimidated.
[01:52:43.046 --> 01:52:44.507]  Just say, no, there's no law.
[01:52:44.507 --> 01:52:45.107]  They can't do it.
[01:52:46.584 --> 01:52:51.125]  So I can say I don't want any of the shots then.
[01:52:51.125 --> 01:52:55.446]  There's no law, sir, that they can make them take the shots.
[01:52:55.446 --> 01:52:56.546]  Okay.
[01:52:56.546 --> 01:52:58.907]  Okay, Alex, I appreciate you taking my call.
[01:52:58.907 --> 01:52:59.527]  Thank you.
[01:52:59.527 --> 01:53:00.767]  I appreciate you, brother.
[01:53:00.767 --> 01:53:03.808]  It's a big deal to have a baby coming, and I'm honored you called.
[01:53:03.808 --> 01:53:06.969]  Ben in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[01:53:06.969 --> 01:53:08.149]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.669]  How you doing?
[01:53:08.669 --> 01:53:09.450]  I love you, brother.
[01:53:09.450 --> 01:53:09.910]  All right, brother.
[01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:10.290]  Love you, too.
[01:53:10.290 --> 01:53:11.950]  What's up?
[01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:15.631]  I just wanted to bring up a couple topics.
[01:53:16.398 --> 01:53:22.702]  Um, I remember catching you back on Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.
[01:53:22.702 --> 01:53:25.503]  And I remember hearing your voice and I was like, who is this guy?
[01:53:25.503 --> 01:53:30.706]  And you know, and that's when I started listening to you and I found InfoWars and all that.
[01:53:30.706 --> 01:53:37.550]  But I remember even on Beavis and Butthead, uh, you'd always hear InfoWars.com and I was like a little kid.
[01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:40.431]  I was born in 88, you know?
[01:53:40.431 --> 01:53:45.654]  And, uh, but anyhow, I've been, uh, listening for a long time and get the products.
[01:53:46.328 --> 01:53:59.591]  Spider-Man Real Fusion is great, and I want to mention that I like to promote a bunch of things on my Facebook and whatnot, and I've gotten like 400, 200, 300 views.
[01:53:59.591 --> 01:54:01.531]  That's huge.
[01:54:01.531 --> 01:54:06.212]  Because everybody doing that together reaches millions.
[01:54:06.212 --> 01:54:07.552]  Beautiful.
[01:54:07.552 --> 01:54:08.072]  Yep.
[01:54:08.072 --> 01:54:09.813]  I'll tell you where the Beavis and Butthead comes from.
[01:54:09.813 --> 01:54:10.793]  I'm friends with Mike Judge.
[01:54:12.059 --> 01:54:13.320]  And I just had one question for you.
[01:54:13.320 --> 01:54:19.225]  About a month ago, me and my niece were looking up at the stars in the sky, a nice clear night, and we see a bunch of drones.
[01:54:41.672 --> 01:54:45.875]  I mean not like four or five, I mean like 18, 20, 20 to 30.
[01:54:45.875 --> 01:54:52.438]  Now there's massive satellites, low earth satellites, drones, it's just a massive program.
[01:54:52.438 --> 01:54:55.920]  So I called the police.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:55:03.885]  I had the cops come down and they barely did anything like, oh we'll take a look around and so do you think that has anything to do with like the
[01:55:05.123 --> 01:55:08.825]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:55:08.825 --> 01:55:10.326]  I'll make this quick.
[01:55:10.326 --> 01:55:11.107]  I think that we should
[01:55:34.787 --> 01:55:39.470]  ...accelerate the death of the New World Order by exposing their controllers.
[01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:49.897]  Charles Baudelaire wrote in his book, Quakerism Examined, one of the artifices of Satan is to induce men to believe that he doesn't exist.
[01:55:49.897 --> 01:55:55.080]  So, I've been researching who their controllers are and it's these entities.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:02.565]  I've called before, they're known as the Vailon, but the Anunnaki primarily control the Democratic Party and the Deep State.
[01:56:03.263 --> 01:56:11.469]  The Junda control the globalists, all the technocrats, and the Hathor control all these spiritual gurus of the new age.
[01:56:11.469 --> 01:56:21.277]  But them, like, triangulate, and they're the ones who are bringing about this whole world plan, because they want the world for themselves.
[01:56:21.277 --> 01:56:25.921]  They see themselves as God's chosen people, which is absurd.
[01:56:25.921 --> 01:56:26.461]  But I think
[01:56:27.077 --> 01:56:29.839]  Once you call them out by name, you'll have them.
[01:56:29.839 --> 01:56:36.045]  Because yeah, we can try all these globalists and hang them, but we still gotta deal with these ETs.
[01:56:36.045 --> 01:56:39.107]  And it's good to know them by name and their pattern.
[01:56:39.107 --> 01:56:39.928]  But I'll leave it at that.
[01:56:39.928 --> 01:56:40.969]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:56:41.448 --> 01:56:42.509]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:42.509 --> 01:56:46.813]  There's no doubt the globalists believe they're in contact with other earthly creatures.
[01:56:46.813 --> 01:56:48.814]  There's no doubt that we're on a planet in the middle of all this.
[01:56:48.814 --> 01:56:50.416]  There's a lot of weirdness going on.
[01:56:50.416 --> 01:56:53.779]  But God overpowers all of that, and we have a connection to God.
[01:56:53.779 --> 01:57:01.886]  We have a spiritual, electromagnetic, chemical, next-dimensional connection to God, and we can't beat this without God.
[01:57:01.886 --> 01:57:04.068]  We just say, God, direct us, guide us.
[01:57:04.068 --> 01:57:05.409]  We have free will.
[01:57:05.409 --> 01:57:05.769]  Ask us.
[01:57:06.610 --> 01:57:08.451]  To do what we should do.
[01:57:08.451 --> 01:57:09.592]  Tell us what we should do.
[01:57:09.592 --> 01:57:10.493]  Free will.
[01:57:10.493 --> 01:57:11.393]  Lead God and direct us.
[01:57:11.393 --> 01:57:13.315]  And I think that really is what it comes down to.
[01:57:13.315 --> 01:57:19.659]  We're going to start hour number three with Jeremiah and many others, Carol, you name it.
[01:57:19.659 --> 01:57:24.703]  Your calls are coming up on the other side of this break.
[01:57:24.703 --> 01:57:26.984]  Hour number three is about to take place.
[01:57:26.984 --> 01:57:32.308]  And then later in the hour, we've got a special guest from Davos.
[01:57:33.590 --> 01:57:34.871]  In Switzerland.
[01:57:34.871 --> 01:57:40.698]  So that's all coming up in the third hour that's only two minutes away.
[01:57:40.698 --> 01:57:44.302]  Check out the new website conspiracyfact.info and share it.
[01:57:48.803 --> 01:57:53.368]  Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[01:57:53.368 --> 01:57:58.574]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[01:57:58.574 --> 01:58:03.420]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:07.764]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[01:58:08.345 --> 01:58:17.872]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission, and you get a historical memento, so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[01:58:17.872 --> 01:58:30.882]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now, while supplies last, at 1776coin.com.
[01:58:30.882 --> 01:58:34.665]  And just like an NPR pledge drive, where they mark up a coffee cup, or a t-shirt, or a DVD,
[01:58:35.685 --> 01:58:36.826]  300%.
[01:58:36.826 --> 01:58:39.367]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[01:58:39.367 --> 01:58:45.651]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on WhatCoinsRemain.
[01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:48.533]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[01:58:48.533 --> 01:58:50.214]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[01:58:50.214 --> 01:58:52.075]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[01:58:52.075 --> 01:59:00.160]  Well, so do I. And I've been the most effective individual in the fight against the globalists, and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:00.921]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[01:59:01.901 --> 01:59:04.283]  I can't do it without your support.
[01:59:04.283 --> 01:59:08.845]  And the good news is, we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[01:59:08.845 --> 01:59:13.508]  The bad news is, the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not gonna back down.
[01:59:13.508 --> 01:59:15.509]  And I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:59:15.509 --> 01:59:16.910]  So please, keep me on the field.
[01:59:17.330 --> 01:59:22.552]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[01:59:34.015 --> 01:59:35.496]  But I thank you all for your support.
[01:59:35.496 --> 01:59:39.937]  Please commit now to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get great products and make donations.
[01:59:39.937 --> 01:59:40.898]  I thank you for your support.
[01:59:40.898 --> 01:59:42.098]  Now take action!
[01:59:42.098 --> 01:59:44.839]  The globalists are counting on you not taking action!
[01:59:50.347 --> 01:59:54.929]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:54.929 --> 01:59:59.690]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:59:59.690 --> 02:00:17.276]  I'm Alex Jones!
[02:00:17.276 --> 02:00:18.737]  It's always the same!
[02:00:25.305 --> 02:00:27.046]  Well, incredible things are happening.
[02:00:27.046 --> 02:00:31.248]  Humanity's waking up to globalist tyranny.
[02:00:31.248 --> 02:00:32.329]  They're not all powerful.
[02:00:32.329 --> 02:00:37.892]  There is a fight going on this planet for the future of our species.
[02:00:37.892 --> 02:00:40.113]  But I wanted to play a clip.
[02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:50.143]  of an autistic man in a restaurant coffee shop literally under mind control with a six feet separation and the people that are there.
[02:00:50.143 --> 02:00:55.085]  We make fun of this guy, but the general public that's under his control are basically in the same position.
[02:00:55.085 --> 02:01:02.027]  Then we have a BBC News top cardiologist that advises the government talking about what's really causing the increases in heart attacks.
[02:01:02.027 --> 02:01:04.707]  It's not the lack of the public taking statins.
[02:01:04.707 --> 02:01:09.029]  They want to give kids statins down in the UK because heart attacks are exploding.
[02:01:09.029 --> 02:01:10.249]  Here's both clips back to back.
[02:01:15.592 --> 02:01:16.373]  He don't work here.
[02:01:16.373 --> 02:01:18.975]  I don't know why he holding his hand up.
[02:01:18.975 --> 02:01:20.256]  Like... What the f***?
[02:01:20.256 --> 02:01:21.056]  I don't know.
[02:01:21.056 --> 02:01:22.817]  I don't know what he think he's doing.
[02:01:22.817 --> 02:01:23.358]  You rascal.
[02:01:23.358 --> 02:01:24.499]  You need to go home.
[02:02:13.675 --> 02:02:14.717]  Wow!
[02:02:14.717 --> 02:02:16.720]  We did well.
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:54.292]  But what is almost certainly, if you allow me to say this, what my own research has found, and this is something that is probably a likely contributory factor, is that the COVID mRNA vaccines do carry a cardiovascular risk.
[02:02:54.292 --> 02:03:01.878]  And I've actually called for the suspension of this pending an inquiry, because there's a lot of uncertainty at the moment about what's causing the excess deaths.
[02:03:01.878 --> 02:03:03.159]  Some of it will be ambulance delays.
[02:03:03.159 --> 02:03:05.781]  My own father, who was reported on BBC News in late 2021,
[02:03:07.902 --> 02:03:14.469]  I was the first to actually highlight the ambulance delays because my own father suffered a cardiac arrest at home and the ambulance took 30 minutes.
[02:03:14.469 --> 02:03:19.094]  And when his post-mortem came out, he had very severe coronary artery disease, which is unexplainable.
[02:03:19.094 --> 02:03:27.843]  I then published in a peer-reviewed journal, they accepted my findings that the likely cause of his death was two doses of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine he had six months earlier.
[02:03:30.285 --> 02:03:32.566]  I just want to jump in on that point.
[02:03:32.566 --> 02:03:42.088]  So what you're saying in terms of the mRNA link to cardiovascular risk, is that it's been proven medically, has it?
[02:03:42.088 --> 02:03:43.288]  Scientifically?
[02:03:43.288 --> 02:03:50.170]  Yes, so in medicine, in any research that we do, it's very difficult to always be absolutely conclusive.
[02:03:50.170 --> 02:03:51.330]  So we go on likelihoods.
[02:03:51.970 --> 02:03:54.131]  And there are lots of data now.
[02:03:54.131 --> 02:03:57.372]  The highest quality data is what we call randomised controlled trial evidence.
[02:03:57.372 --> 02:04:08.417]  So there was a re-analysis in the journal Vaccine published recently, where they found that the original trials of Pfizer and Moderna with mRNA vaccines showed, and I just want to put this in absolute terms, we don't want to scare people unnecessarily,
[02:04:08.897 --> 02:04:11.819]  But the absolute risk of serious adverse events was at least 1 in 800.
[02:04:11.819 --> 02:04:11.939]  OK.
[02:04:11.939 --> 02:04:15.442]  And a lot of those are cardiovascular.
[02:04:15.442 --> 02:04:21.747]  And then you were more likely in those trials to suffer a serious adverse event than to be hospitalized with COVID early on.
[02:04:21.747 --> 02:04:24.549]  And I think the vaccine has certainly helped people who are high risk.
[02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:29.833]  But now we should be reassured that Omicron and what's circulating is really no worse than the flu.
[02:04:29.833 --> 02:04:33.816]  And this is really time to pause the vaccine rollout and to really investigate this properly.
[02:04:34.036 --> 02:04:51.735]  OK, so I just want to clarify one point here, is that, is using statins a cheaper, less resistant, but short-sighted approach to lowering the risk?
[02:04:51.735 --> 02:04:53.557]  Yeah, I think you've summed it up perfectly.
[02:04:59.246 --> 02:05:05.487]  In early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[02:05:05.487 --> 02:05:13.869]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[02:05:13.869 --> 02:05:16.110]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:19.590]  Now that was a three-coin series, the founding member coin.
[02:05:19.590 --> 02:05:22.951]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time
[02:05:23.673 --> 02:05:30.397]  Is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[02:05:30.397 --> 02:05:36.160]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:39.402]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[02:05:39.602 --> 02:05:40.343]  We're good to go.
[02:06:05.166 --> 02:06:10.650]  Andrew Levin of Rebel Media is in Davos, Switzerland and he's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:06:10.650 --> 02:06:11.971]  Right now we're taking your phone calls.
[02:06:11.971 --> 02:06:16.455]  I have a clip to start the next segment I'm going to play of Shirley Temple
[02:06:32.768 --> 02:06:45.422]  In 1988, one of the most famous child actresses ever, if not the most famous, talking about a casting call where they tried to have sex with her when she was 12 years old, and Larry King laughs about it like it's funny.
[02:06:45.422 --> 02:06:46.503]  But I get he's uncomfortable.
[02:06:47.563 --> 02:06:59.948]  I can't judge the heart, but this is how long this demonization, these demonic operations have been taking place, and how long this dehumanization has been taking place.
[02:06:59.948 --> 02:07:02.269]  But right now, let's ram through more calls.
[02:07:02.269 --> 02:07:04.409]  Jeremiah in California, you're on next.
[02:07:04.409 --> 02:07:05.950]  Go ahead.
[02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:07.671]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[02:07:07.671 --> 02:07:09.852]  I'm super stoked to be on.
[02:07:09.852 --> 02:07:14.833]  I just took my multivitamins, my Red Pill Plus, the vitamin D3.
[02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:19.543]  I live in Sebastopol, California.
[02:07:19.543 --> 02:07:20.644]  I didn't hang up on you, Jeremiah.
[02:07:20.644 --> 02:07:22.085]  Are you there?
[02:07:22.085 --> 02:07:23.205]  I'm here.
[02:07:23.205 --> 02:07:24.146]  You know what just happened?
[02:07:24.146 --> 02:07:25.526]  My headset just cut out.
[02:07:25.526 --> 02:07:26.226]  That wasn't you.
[02:07:26.226 --> 02:07:27.047]  I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[02:07:27.047 --> 02:07:28.668]  My headset just dropped.
[02:07:28.668 --> 02:07:30.468]  Start over.
[02:07:30.468 --> 02:07:31.009]  All right.
[02:07:31.009 --> 02:07:34.770]  I just took my multivitamin, my vitamin D3.
[02:07:34.770 --> 02:07:37.732]  I got the Red Pill Plus, the DNA 4 Plus.
[02:07:37.732 --> 02:07:40.553]  I live in Sebastopol, California.
[02:07:40.553 --> 02:07:44.015]  It's like 35 minutes from the Bohemian Grove.
[02:07:45.623 --> 02:07:52.372]  And I'm probably one of the only people in Sebastopol that's just rocking the InfoWars shirts and hats like on a daily basis.
[02:07:52.372 --> 02:07:56.757]  And I'm super stoked to make it through, to call with you first time.
[02:07:58.616 --> 02:08:06.201]  Your trial, when you took the fifth, it reminds me of this documentary about Benjamin Franklin, put out like 20 years ago.
[02:08:06.201 --> 02:08:11.984]  He goes to England, they put him on trial to make fun of him and all that, and he doesn't say anything.
[02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:17.747]  He comes back, and that's the pivotal point where he becomes a revolutionary, solid person.
[02:08:17.747 --> 02:08:21.109]  And it just reminds me of your trial, you know.
[02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:24.772]  And also, something else he said was, if
[02:08:25.925 --> 02:08:31.430]  We can make whatever we need and whatever else they import, you know, we don't need it.
[02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:32.972]  And so it's like that's it.
[02:08:32.972 --> 02:08:35.614]  And what happened in those show trials was the judge already found me guilty.
[02:08:35.614 --> 02:08:39.959]  And then she said, if you say you're innocent, I will hold you in contempt.
[02:08:39.959 --> 02:08:40.940]  You can't even do that.
[02:08:40.940 --> 02:08:46.145]  So I said, well, she said like a list of 20 things I couldn't say so that I couldn't answer the questions.
[02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:50.867]  Like the other side's lawyer would say, you're in bankruptcy.
[02:08:50.867 --> 02:08:55.188]  She gave an order that I'd serve six months in jail if I said I was in bankruptcy.
[02:08:55.188 --> 02:08:56.929]  So I said, I can't answer the question.
[02:08:56.929 --> 02:09:00.990]  She sent the jury out and said, good job, you're right, you can't ask that.
[02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:02.951]  Since when can you not say you're innocent?
[02:09:02.951 --> 02:09:04.431]  Since when can you not answer questions?
[02:09:04.431 --> 02:09:05.791]  It's a joke!
[02:09:05.791 --> 02:09:09.692]  But they're all seeing how far they can go because no one's standing up against them.
[02:09:12.243 --> 02:09:18.347]  When I first started listening to your show, I heard a co-worker mention Nam-El.
[02:09:18.347 --> 02:09:19.507]  He's a genius.
[02:09:19.507 --> 02:09:23.530]  And I just heard you on the radio just driving around, bioseptic pros, you know?
[02:09:23.530 --> 02:09:29.093]  And I was like, yeah, this is... Once I really started listening to the show after the commercial, I was like, oh man.
[02:09:29.093 --> 02:09:33.656]  You know, I list all the stuff on Facebook and Twitter and all that.
[02:09:33.656 --> 02:09:37.478]  You know, Charlie Kirk and all the other good patriots out there.
[02:09:37.478 --> 02:09:40.980]  But as soon as I started listening to you, I was like, man, he goes way, way deeper.
[02:09:41.764 --> 02:09:50.052]  My cousin showed me you like around like because when you expose the bio bohemian you know that blew back in the day.
[02:09:50.052 --> 02:09:57.779]  What happens to you there in Northern California beautiful area around Monterio just west of Santa Rosa?
[02:09:57.779 --> 02:10:01.283]  What happens to you when you wear the InfoWars shirt?
[02:10:01.283 --> 02:10:05.587]  I get more hate for the Trump stuff like when I wear my Trump 1 shirt like I
[02:10:06.178 --> 02:10:11.920]  People either don't know what InfoWars is, or they do, you know, they either laugh or they don't know.
[02:10:11.920 --> 02:10:13.581]  Got it, got it.
[02:10:13.581 --> 02:10:18.343]  Alright brother, keep it up, we love you, we're gonna stand strong, thank you.
[02:10:18.343 --> 02:10:21.924]  Dave in Colorado, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:10:21.924 --> 02:10:23.785]  Hi Alex, can you hear me okay?
[02:10:23.785 --> 02:10:25.786]  I can, go ahead.
[02:10:25.786 --> 02:10:26.946]  Excellent.
[02:10:26.946 --> 02:10:33.429]  Alex, I haven't talked with you since about 2007, but you did have me on your show a couple of times.
[02:10:34.764 --> 02:10:36.965]  I worked for the Smithsonian.
[02:10:36.965 --> 02:10:41.247]  I'm a professional anthropologist, archaeologist.
[02:10:41.247 --> 02:10:45.229]  I started out working in the Andes in the mid-70s.
[02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:46.550]  Well, remind us who you are.
[02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:47.870]  I've been interviewing a lot of folks.
[02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:49.451]  Tell me who you are.
[02:10:49.451 --> 02:10:51.652]  Well, my name's Dave.
[02:10:51.652 --> 02:10:53.113]  Is it okay if I use my last name?
[02:10:53.113 --> 02:10:53.513]  Yeah, sure.
[02:10:53.513 --> 02:10:54.814]  Go ahead.
[02:10:54.814 --> 02:10:56.154]  My name's Dave Edwards.
[02:10:56.154 --> 02:11:01.617]  I was teaching at the University of Maryland and working at the Smithsonian.
[02:11:02.307 --> 02:11:23.183]  You wanted me to talk about, you know, many years ago, how when I was recruited by the DIA and I refused to work with them, they did several attempts on my life and I had to run out here where I am now, out in the boonies in southwestern Colorado.
[02:11:23.183 --> 02:11:25.725]  Anyway, so that's who I am.
[02:11:25.725 --> 02:11:31.370]  The reason why I called today, and it was really kind of amazing because I said a prayer
[02:11:32.159 --> 02:11:37.200]  And I got through, and I was shocked, and then I got cut off.
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:41.521]  And then I dialed again and said a prayer, and I got through again.
[02:11:41.521 --> 02:11:44.202]  So it's a real miracle.
[02:11:44.202 --> 02:11:45.102]  It's hard to get through.
[02:11:45.102 --> 02:11:47.163]  We have thousands of people trying to call.
[02:11:47.163 --> 02:11:48.543]  So what's on your mind here?
[02:11:48.543 --> 02:11:51.164]  What about climate change and the churches?
[02:11:51.164 --> 02:12:01.506]  Okay, so what I wanted to bring up, I keep thinking about this over and over again, especially as they're going green with this bullshit agenda.
[02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:12.275]  Is, you know, Richard Hoagland did incredible work demonstrating that all the planets in the solar system are heating up.
[02:12:12.275 --> 02:12:29.083]  And it has to do with the twin star, Alpha Centauri, and our star, our sun, starting to get so close to each other that it's really exponentially increasing the amount of heat that's coming from both.
[02:12:29.083 --> 02:12:29.724]  Anyway, so...
[02:12:30.948 --> 02:12:33.710]  I've done a considerable amount of research about that.
[02:12:33.710 --> 02:12:37.492]  Well, it is true that the solar system was heating up until about five years ago.
[02:12:37.492 --> 02:12:39.314]  Now it's basically stopped.
[02:12:39.314 --> 02:12:39.794]  I mean, you're right.
[02:12:39.794 --> 02:12:41.335]  The peak was five, six years ago.
[02:12:41.335 --> 02:12:44.917]  And the sun is the main driver of our climate.
[02:12:44.917 --> 02:12:50.681]  And so it really has very little or nothing to do with fossil fuels.
[02:12:50.681 --> 02:12:53.263]  And so... Well, they obviously know that.
[02:12:53.263 --> 02:12:55.324]  And look, I have a graph I gave the crew.
[02:12:55.324 --> 02:12:57.206]  I mean, let me find it here.
[02:12:57.206 --> 02:12:58.226]  It was on Zero Hedge.
[02:12:58.226 --> 02:13:00.148]  It was like, this is the most important video you'll see.
[02:13:01.533 --> 02:13:01.953]  Here it is.
[02:13:22.148 --> 02:13:25.451]  Other countries are going down, but China's exploding.
[02:13:25.451 --> 02:13:26.412]  Even India's going down.
[02:13:26.412 --> 02:13:28.734]  That's designed to only let China operate.
[02:13:28.734 --> 02:13:32.617]  That's a tariff against other countries for China and the globalists.
[02:13:32.617 --> 02:13:33.138]  Great points.
[02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:34.399]  Thank you, Dave.
[02:13:34.399 --> 02:13:36.581]  Okay, Mark in Texas on spiritual warfare.
[02:13:36.581 --> 02:13:38.282]  Go ahead.
[02:13:38.282 --> 02:13:38.822]  Hey, Alex.
[02:13:38.822 --> 02:13:41.144]  It's Mark, and I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:13:41.144 --> 02:13:41.385]  Thank you.
[02:13:41.385 --> 02:13:48.491]  I'm calling from McKinney today, and I did want to let you know I'm watching your program quite widely now, and I've also got that book, The Great Reset.
[02:13:48.491 --> 02:13:48.731]  Thank you.
[02:13:49.526 --> 02:13:55.391]  And I appreciate the guy before you that says he's calling because you had said a prayer, so I was praying a little bit whether or not I should give you a call.
[02:13:55.391 --> 02:13:56.392]  I am a first-time caller.
[02:13:56.392 --> 02:13:57.152]  Thank you, brother.
[02:13:57.152 --> 02:13:59.434]  Appreciate all the stuff you're doing.
[02:13:59.434 --> 02:14:09.542]  I want to tell you, I read the book Great Reset, and I appreciate what you had to say about Saul being the wanted king instead of God, and I appreciate all the stuff you're saying about scriptures.
[02:14:09.542 --> 02:14:12.864]  But I just wanted to add a couple of things here and give you maybe some food for thought.
[02:14:12.864 --> 02:14:17.468]  You know there are four dispensations between the Fall and the New Heaven and the New Earth.
[02:14:18.078 --> 02:14:23.283]  And we are in the third dispensation, the dispensation of grace, and you're reading your Bible, so you probably understand that.
[02:14:23.283 --> 02:14:28.547]  So we have the first dispensation, which is the faith, you know, Noah and Abraham.
[02:14:28.547 --> 02:14:32.951]  Then we have the second dispensation, dispensation of the law with Moses.
[02:14:32.951 --> 02:14:34.713]  The law made nothing perfect.
[02:14:34.713 --> 02:14:36.454]  The bringing in of the better hope did.
[02:14:36.454 --> 02:14:40.738]  The law only had the shadow of the good things to come, but not the very image of those things.
[02:14:41.198 --> 02:14:45.021]  And it could never make the coverage that came there continually perfect.
[02:14:45.021 --> 02:14:47.524]  The law was only a schoolmaster who brings to Christ.
[02:14:47.524 --> 02:14:53.769]  Then Christ came, and he said about these people that were his leaders at that point in time, he said, you know what?
[02:14:53.769 --> 02:14:55.610]  You shut up the kingdom of heaven.
[02:14:55.610 --> 02:14:59.033]  You won't go in yourselves, and those you would, you've hindered.
[02:14:59.033 --> 02:15:02.216]  And then he set up a new one called this dispensation of grace.
[02:15:02.216 --> 02:15:03.937]  And I hope I'm not taking too much of your time.
[02:15:03.937 --> 02:15:05.159]  I just wanted to make sure everybody understood.
[02:15:05.159 --> 02:15:05.559]  No, you're right.
[02:15:05.559 --> 02:15:06.700]  Christ came to complete everything.
[02:15:07.837 --> 02:15:08.557]  You got it!
[02:15:08.557 --> 02:15:13.138]  And we're only in the third one, because remember, it was a mystery that had been hid from agents.
[02:15:13.138 --> 02:15:14.478]  And everything comes in threes.
[02:15:14.478 --> 02:15:16.159]  The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
[02:15:16.159 --> 02:15:18.379]  Jesus is the completion.
[02:15:18.379 --> 02:15:18.799]  Amen.
[02:15:18.799 --> 02:15:19.459]  But you know what?
[02:15:19.459 --> 02:15:20.939]  We have another dispensation.
[02:15:20.939 --> 02:15:25.520]  The angel's not yet come down out of heaven clothed with the cloud, with his feet like pillars of fire.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:30.261]  I know you're reading the book of Revelation, so you understand that, because when he comes down, he's still... No, you're right.
[02:15:30.261 --> 02:15:33.502]  Jesus is the clock beginning, ticking down to that.
[02:15:33.502 --> 02:15:35.042]  He's the beginning of the end of the devil.
[02:15:36.104 --> 02:15:38.905]  So there is a thousand-year millennium coming up.
[02:15:38.905 --> 02:15:39.626]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:15:39.626 --> 02:15:40.466]  Finish your point, Mark.
[02:15:40.466 --> 02:15:41.007]  Don't hang up.
[02:15:41.007 --> 02:15:42.687]  Don't hang up, Mark.
[02:15:42.687 --> 02:15:45.929]  And believe me, folks, the globalists know this.
[02:15:45.929 --> 02:15:47.770]  This is all going down on this planet.
[02:15:47.770 --> 02:15:49.711]  We'll come back and finish up with Mark, and we'll go to everybody else.
[02:15:49.711 --> 02:15:50.571]  Stay with us.
[02:15:50.571 --> 02:15:51.212]  InfoWars.com.
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:00.561]  Infowars MD is finally here.
[02:16:00.561 --> 02:16:16.827]  It's the very same high quality products you've been getting through Infowars Life, but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies that we were buying our high quality products from.
[02:16:16.827 --> 02:16:23.129]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the Infowars MD line.
[02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:26.251]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[02:16:26.251 --> 02:16:30.195]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves for more than twice the cost.
[02:16:30.195 --> 02:16:34.718]  You'll get them at InfoWarsTore.com under our exclusive label.
[02:16:34.718 --> 02:16:40.643]  We're bringing you the highest quality supplements directly from the factory, right here in the USA, to your door.
[02:16:40.643 --> 02:16:46.508]  It'll make your life healthy, better, boost your immune system, and it keeps InfoWarsTore on the air.
[02:16:46.508 --> 02:16:51.993]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD, now exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com with
[02:16:52.233 --> 02:16:57.314]  Massive, massive savings.
[02:16:57.314 --> 02:17:00.335]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[02:17:00.335 --> 02:17:02.976]  If we're so stupid, we let them kill us.
[02:17:02.976 --> 02:17:04.817]  We deserve it.
[02:17:04.817 --> 02:17:10.458]  Except, children don't deserve it, do they?
[02:17:10.458 --> 02:17:17.480]  And I looked, and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat
[02:17:22.831 --> 02:17:30.359]  On the horse was named death.
[02:17:30.359 --> 02:17:40.129]  Now the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[02:17:40.129 --> 02:17:42.211]  The book of Revelation.
[02:17:44.284 --> 02:17:45.925]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[02:17:45.925 --> 02:17:47.646]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[02:17:47.646 --> 02:17:49.207]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[02:17:49.207 --> 02:17:50.568]  This is our fight.
[02:17:50.568 --> 02:17:51.929]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[02:17:51.929 --> 02:17:53.390]  The Globalists even admit it's leaked.
[02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:58.554]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[02:17:58.554 --> 02:18:01.676]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[02:18:01.676 --> 02:18:03.997]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:18:03.997 --> 02:18:07.940]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:11.863]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:18:13.291 --> 02:18:16.833]  They really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:18:16.833 --> 02:18:23.736]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[02:18:23.736 --> 02:18:24.637]  It's really just incredible.
[02:18:25.658 --> 02:18:28.539]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:18:28.539 --> 02:18:35.082]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:18:35.082 --> 02:18:38.123]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:18:38.123 --> 02:18:46.346]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:18:47.026 --> 02:18:50.608]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[02:19:06.577 --> 02:19:10.102]  Rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[02:19:10.102 --> 02:19:14.127]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[02:19:14.127 --> 02:19:16.430]  And it's the same psy-op today.
[02:19:16.430 --> 02:19:20.835]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[02:19:20.835 --> 02:19:23.298]  Because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[02:19:23.979 --> 02:19:32.349]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:19:32.349 --> 02:19:38.496]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:19:38.996 --> 02:19:40.936]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[02:19:40.936 --> 02:19:48.198]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[02:19:48.198 --> 02:19:49.618]  It is all in your hands.
[02:19:49.618 --> 02:19:50.959]  So thanks for your support.
[02:19:50.959 --> 02:19:52.159]  Stand up against the globalists.
[02:19:52.159 --> 02:19:55.440]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:59.001]  It's up to you.
[02:19:59.001 --> 02:20:04.882]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:11.653 --> 02:20:12.574]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:20:12.574 --> 02:20:20.878]  Coming up next segment for one segment, Ezra Levant from Switzerland and the Davos Group joins us for a news download, then I'll continue with calls.
[02:20:20.878 --> 02:20:27.382]  And then I've got the whole latest download on the pedophile armies and different ways they're abusing and attacking children.
[02:20:27.382 --> 02:20:29.123]  Then we'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:20:29.123 --> 02:20:30.424]  But finishing up with Mark.
[02:20:31.204 --> 02:20:40.974]  Mark, the point you're getting at here is spiritual warfare and the fact that this is all a test, or what's the gist of what you're saying?
[02:20:40.974 --> 02:20:44.798]  Because I agree with what you're saying, but what's the cherry on top?
[02:20:44.798 --> 02:20:49.123]  So I just want to point out that the globalists know that there's ten kings.
[02:20:49.844 --> 02:21:00.412]  And this beast that's going to appear on the scene, God is going to put it in their heart to perform His mind in one mind, and to give their kingdoms to the beast until the word of the Lord is accomplished.
[02:21:00.412 --> 02:21:12.282]  Because Christ is going to come down from heaven, defeat this Antichrist person and his kingdom is reigning over this planet, the globalists know that, and then Christ is going to be installed for a thousand year millennium.
[02:21:12.282 --> 02:21:18.847]  That's the scriptures, and that's what I was trying to get across to you, that we have this hope because of what God has done for us.
[02:21:19.246 --> 02:21:26.652]  Well, there's no mistake that the devil and his minions, these world leaders, follow the Bible exactly.
[02:21:26.652 --> 02:21:27.513]  You got it, man.
[02:21:27.513 --> 02:21:28.674]  You are so onto it.
[02:21:28.674 --> 02:21:30.595]  That's what I was reading your book, man.
[02:21:30.595 --> 02:21:33.338]  I appreciate you, brother.
[02:21:33.338 --> 02:21:34.318]  Thank you for the support.
[02:21:34.318 --> 02:21:35.319]  Thank you, brother.
[02:21:35.319 --> 02:21:38.202]  All right, let's talk to 5G activists in Rhode Island.
[02:21:38.202 --> 02:21:39.903]  Go ahead.
[02:21:39.903 --> 02:21:41.504]  Hello, Alex.
[02:21:41.504 --> 02:21:44.527]  I'd like to talk about evolved technologies.
[02:21:44.527 --> 02:21:47.369]  Have you ever heard about them?
[02:21:47.369 --> 02:21:48.010]  It rings a bell.
[02:21:48.010 --> 02:21:48.250]  Tell me.
[02:21:49.344 --> 02:21:52.990]  Okay, so they're spelled EVOLVE without the E on the end.
[02:21:52.990 --> 02:21:56.216]  They're backed by Bill Gates and their board of directors and...
[02:21:56.954 --> 02:22:02.318]  Advisors on the company, they're all evil CIA, FBI people.
[02:22:02.318 --> 02:22:08.203]  These are 3D scanners that they scan your body profile, your gait, everything, and they can tell.
[02:22:08.203 --> 02:22:12.807]  The point is they want to put them in so they can see if you have a plastic gun.
[02:22:12.807 --> 02:22:18.071]  The way they look, they look just like the anti-theft devices at any store, right?
[02:22:18.071 --> 02:22:20.173]  That read the barcode if you didn't pay for it.
[02:22:20.173 --> 02:22:24.917]  They look just like that, so they don't look like a big magnetic scanner or whatever.
[02:22:25.641 --> 02:22:29.324]  Uh, but it's pretty insidious because, uh, they're putting them everywhere.
[02:22:29.324 --> 02:22:34.908]  They didn't have a lot of them in places like two years ago, but they're at Disney World, Universal.
[02:22:34.908 --> 02:22:36.430]  Uh, they're putting them in schools.
[02:22:36.430 --> 02:22:39.772]  They're going to like a superintendent's conference soon.
[02:22:39.772 --> 02:22:42.995]  Uh, I, or it may have already happened.
[02:22:42.995 --> 02:22:45.377]  Um, they got them at sports stadiums.
[02:22:45.377 --> 02:22:54.604]  I don't know if they have them in Austin, Texas yet, but, um, they also tied a facial recognition because, um, basically during COVID Disney was using them.
[02:22:55.282 --> 02:22:59.385]  With facial recognition to see if you were wearing a mask or not.
[02:22:59.385 --> 02:23:06.731]  But they could also basically like trespass you and never even have your photo, just like have your biometrics on there.
[02:23:06.731 --> 02:23:08.092]  I'm aware of the technology.
[02:23:08.092 --> 02:23:08.873]  We put it on screen.
[02:23:08.873 --> 02:23:14.017]  I know Bill Gates is at the forefront of biometric stuff that even scans through your clothes.
[02:23:14.017 --> 02:23:17.480]  So we all heard about the law firm that banned people that were suing
[02:23:19.221 --> 02:23:19.682]  We're good.
[02:23:31.144 --> 02:23:35.026]  You can't really opt out of them unless you say you got a medical condition.
[02:23:35.026 --> 02:23:36.948]  So I think that really sucks.
[02:23:36.948 --> 02:23:39.769]  And there's one other point on 5G.
[02:23:39.769 --> 02:23:48.375]  I think the main way we stop it is by getting people riled up about property values because they're putting them on top of utility poles so they could... You're right.
[02:23:48.375 --> 02:23:49.776]  That's the angle.
[02:23:49.776 --> 02:23:53.138]  Property values drop where they go as long as people know how sick they make you.
[02:23:53.138 --> 02:23:55.179]  Anybody near them should sue and say no.
[02:23:55.179 --> 02:23:56.240]  Thank you.
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:23:57.701]  JT in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:23:59.292 --> 02:24:02.173]  Hey Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:24:02.173 --> 02:24:05.694]  X2 and X3 have changed my life.
[02:24:05.694 --> 02:24:07.494]  Recently ordered the Red Pill Plus.
[02:24:07.494 --> 02:24:09.915]  Can't wait to try it.
[02:24:09.915 --> 02:24:11.595]  I'll get straight to my point.
[02:24:11.595 --> 02:24:22.158]  You had Dr. Ben Marble on last week and he projected up to a billion vaccine deaths in the next year.
[02:24:22.158 --> 02:24:26.979]  And I heard a similar forecast with Mike Adams interviewing Ed Dowd.
[02:24:27.734 --> 02:24:34.918]  So I wanted to get your take on what the U.S.
[02:24:34.918 --> 02:24:41.743]  and worldwide economic and societal implications will be if that goes down.
[02:24:41.743 --> 02:24:45.405]  And specifically what goes down?
[02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:52.465]  It will if a billion vaccine deaths happen next year like Dr. Marble projected.
[02:25:09.706 --> 02:25:16.132]  A billion sick people, which is conservative, will weigh down society and further break down civilization.
[02:25:16.132 --> 02:25:22.698]  So we don't have 2.1 children on average per country for every two people.
[02:25:22.698 --> 02:25:23.879]  That'll break down society.
[02:25:23.879 --> 02:25:31.886]  But if you make billions of people sick, that will make society be untenable and fall apart, which will cause a post-industrial world.
[02:25:31.886 --> 02:25:32.447]  So that's their plan.
[02:25:33.635 --> 02:25:34.396]  Wow.
[02:25:34.396 --> 02:25:39.078]  Hey, I do see the awakening has started.
[02:25:39.078 --> 02:25:42.741]  I've got your Arrest Fauci bumper sticker on my truck.
[02:25:42.741 --> 02:25:43.781]  Love it.
[02:25:43.781 --> 02:25:46.203]  I used to get a lot of middle finger hate.
[02:25:46.203 --> 02:25:50.345]  That's recently changed to lots of thumbs ups.
[02:25:50.345 --> 02:25:54.288]  So what, you put it on there a while ago and got some hate, now you're getting love?
[02:25:54.288 --> 02:25:55.048]  Yes.
[02:25:55.048 --> 02:25:57.550]  Yeah, it's completely changed.
[02:25:59.366 --> 02:26:05.209]  Well, see, if you're not a public figure, which is a great thing, a bumper sticker lets you experience what's really going on.
[02:26:05.209 --> 02:26:08.671]  So how long ago did you put the sticker on?
[02:26:08.671 --> 02:26:21.479]  I put it on six months ago, and you know, I've got it on a magnet in case I'm parked in a liberal area, so I don't get a lot of vandalism, but I pretty much leave it on all the time now.
[02:26:21.479 --> 02:26:24.081]  So you had a little bit of friction before, and now hardly any?
[02:26:26.103 --> 02:26:32.527]  Now it's positive horns honking, thumbs up in my rear view mirror.
[02:26:32.527 --> 02:26:33.988]  I'm telling you folks, it's beautiful.
[02:26:33.988 --> 02:26:35.269]  Thank you, JT.
[02:26:35.269 --> 02:26:36.630]  So exciting.
[02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:37.991]  Let's go to Barry in Georgia.
[02:26:37.991 --> 02:26:40.753]  Go ahead.
[02:26:40.753 --> 02:26:46.876]  Hey Alex, just wanted to ask you about Davos and Brian Kemp.
[02:26:46.876 --> 02:26:53.741]  Is it for sure he's going over there or was he invited?
[02:26:53.741 --> 02:26:53.921]  Hello?
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:55.180]  I didn't vote for him.
[02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:56.401]  I voted for, what's her name?
[02:27:26.821 --> 02:27:28.082]  You're having the same thing I had.
[02:27:28.082 --> 02:27:30.384]  So here's the question.
[02:27:30.384 --> 02:27:33.067]  You're reading he's going to be there or you're reading he's not going to be there?
[02:27:34.179 --> 02:27:41.123]  I heard he got an invitation and I want to know if he goes there, I'm going to go score a serve on him.
[02:27:41.123 --> 02:27:41.923]  We'll look into that.
[02:27:41.923 --> 02:27:45.285]  Guys, look at the Governor Brian Kemp is going to Davos.
[02:27:45.285 --> 02:27:53.870]  What Sky News is reporting and what the numbers show is that more than half the attendees that were going aren't going now because they see it as a bad PR move.
[02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:58.032]  So, we've taken that globalist organization that arrogantly tried to control our lives
[02:27:58.652 --> 02:28:00.814]  Yeah, if he goes, I'm not very far from Atlanta.
[02:28:00.814 --> 02:28:04.796]  I can be in Atlanta in 30 minutes, I can be in Macon, Georgia in 30 minutes.
[02:28:04.796 --> 02:28:06.157]  It don't make a difference to me.
[02:28:06.157 --> 02:28:11.921]  And I've got a big truck and I put a sign on it and drive around the square.
[02:28:24.672 --> 02:28:25.133]  I agree.
[02:28:25.133 --> 02:28:29.676]  We should identify everybody that is part of this group and expose them and point out they're anti-American.
[02:28:29.676 --> 02:28:30.457]  Great idea, Barry.
[02:28:30.457 --> 02:28:34.600]  Alright, we got Donna, we got John, we got Carol, who's actually up next.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:36.861]  We got Rasheed, we got Ken.
[02:28:36.861 --> 02:28:41.525]  I will get to your calls, but I've got a guest on from Davos in Switzerland.
[02:28:42.975 --> 02:28:45.880]  Ezra Levant of Rebel Media, the owner of it, when we come back.
[02:28:45.880 --> 02:28:50.187]  Then I've got that pedo news concerning Shirley Temple.
[02:28:50.187 --> 02:28:51.890]  We're going to hit it all on the other side.
[02:28:51.890 --> 02:28:53.352]  InfoWars.com.
[02:28:53.352 --> 02:28:54.214]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:28:57.697 --> 02:29:01.258]  It's your last chance to own a piece of real history.
[02:29:01.258 --> 02:29:03.859]  Your support of InfoWars has made history.
[02:29:03.859 --> 02:29:08.680]  We've had the most devastating effects against the globalists, and their whole agenda is in deep trouble.
[02:29:08.680 --> 02:29:11.721]  But now it's more important for us to stay on air than ever.
[02:29:11.721 --> 02:29:14.861]  And if you don't support us, we will shut down.
[02:29:14.861 --> 02:29:24.824]  I am asking you from the bottom of my heart to commit even harder to the support you've given to this fight, and to go to InfoWarsStore.com right now and get one of the last signed copies
[02:29:25.444 --> 02:29:25.864]  Thank you so much.
[02:29:57.647 --> 02:29:59.489]  Infowars is winning.
[02:29:59.489 --> 02:30:01.532]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[02:30:01.532 --> 02:30:04.315]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[02:30:04.315 --> 02:30:07.059]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[02:30:07.059 --> 02:30:09.162]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[02:30:09.162 --> 02:30:11.224]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[02:30:11.224 --> 02:30:12.205]  None of that's true.
[02:30:12.205 --> 02:30:13.087]  It's all being appealed.
[02:30:13.547 --> 02:30:22.529]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air.
[02:30:22.529 --> 02:30:25.970]  But if they convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:28.671]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[02:30:28.671 --> 02:30:38.553]  Go to InfoWarsHore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[02:30:39.013 --> 02:30:40.374]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.

[02:30:52.261 --> 02:30:54.242]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[02:30:54.242 --> 02:30:55.963]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[02:30:57.512 --> 02:31:03.917]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow InfoWarriors here in the United States and around the world.

[02:32:16.844 --> 02:32:18.825]  These products work great for women as well.

[02:32:34.433 --> 02:32:37.836]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[02:32:37.836 --> 02:32:39.358]  Don't do it during the day.
[02:32:39.358 --> 02:32:42.380]  1776 testosterone boost.

[02:33:11.233 --> 02:33:17.737]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty, it's Alex Jones!
[02:33:18.803 --> 02:33:26.187]  Alright, Ezra LeVant out of Canada has one of the most hard-hitting international organizations exposing the globalists and the lockdowns, the tyranny.
[02:33:26.187 --> 02:33:31.710]  RebelNews.com, he joins us driving down the road at Davos right now.
[02:33:31.710 --> 02:33:35.572]  He's been there in the last few days, has huge breaking news for us.
[02:33:35.572 --> 02:33:39.874]  Ezra LeVant, I know we only have you for one segment, please give us a report on what you witnessed.
[02:33:41.472 --> 02:33:41.932]  Absolutely.
[02:33:41.932 --> 02:33:47.295]  Well, the first thing to know is that the World Economic Forum does not want scrutiny.
[02:33:47.295 --> 02:33:49.956]  They don't want journalists that they don't control.
[02:33:49.956 --> 02:33:54.278]  Now, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of journalists here, but they're on the inside.
[02:33:54.278 --> 02:33:56.339]  They actually pay to play.
[02:33:56.339 --> 02:34:01.882]  They're here to harmonize their messaging with big government and big business.
[02:34:02.262 --> 02:34:03.764]  So that's the first thing to know.
[02:34:03.764 --> 02:34:09.533]  You will see CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, New York Times here.
[02:34:09.533 --> 02:34:10.514]  They're all here.
[02:34:10.514 --> 02:34:11.836]  They're all advertising it.
[02:34:11.836 --> 02:34:15.522]  But not a single one is asking an accountability question.
[02:34:15.522 --> 02:34:16.043]  Point two.
[02:34:16.846 --> 02:34:21.089]  They want to make it as difficult as possible for uninvited people to attend.
[02:34:21.089 --> 02:34:25.471]  So they book every single hotel room and Airbnb in Davos.
[02:34:25.471 --> 02:34:34.997]  So for example, our ragtag team of citizen journalists have to stay one town away because they literally bought up every hotel room in Davos.
[02:34:34.997 --> 02:34:35.738]  Now that's fine.
[02:34:36.258 --> 02:34:38.119]  But then they do another thing, Alex.
[02:34:38.119 --> 02:34:46.345]  They deploy up to 5,000 police and soldiers to lock this town tighter than a drum.
[02:34:46.345 --> 02:34:52.990]  So far we have been pulled over twice by police checkpoints, but I got a flicker of good news for ya.
[02:34:52.990 --> 02:34:54.971]  Call it a white pill moment.
[02:34:54.971 --> 02:35:00.295]  Twice the cops have pulled us over and said, you guys aren't gonna film anything, are ya?
[02:35:01.218 --> 02:35:05.702]  And I looked one cop in the eye and I said, well, that's exactly what we're going to do.
[02:35:05.702 --> 02:35:07.243]  It's still a free country, isn't it?
[02:35:07.243 --> 02:35:11.527]  And he hesitated for a moment and he said, carry on.
[02:35:11.527 --> 02:35:13.889]  I think these Swiss police.
[02:35:14.597 --> 02:35:20.299]  Don't like being pressed into service as Klaus Schwab's personal bodyguards.
[02:35:20.299 --> 02:35:29.141]  So in fact, both times we were pulled over by police, we held our ground, said we're free journalists, and we were led on our merry way.
[02:35:29.141 --> 02:35:31.742]  So I think that's a flicker of hope.
[02:35:31.742 --> 02:35:38.884]  And what you said earlier about how some of the head honchos no longer coming around, I hope that's a sign to come.
[02:35:38.884 --> 02:35:41.284]  But there is still a lot of darkness here.
[02:35:41.284 --> 02:35:43.865]  Last point, Black Rock.
[02:35:44.557 --> 02:35:50.021]  One of the largest asset managers in the world, led by Larry Fink, a radical activist.
[02:35:50.021 --> 02:35:53.063]  Oh boy, they've got such a big pavilion here.
[02:35:53.063 --> 02:35:57.066]  They're trying to shape global policy.
[02:35:57.066 --> 02:36:02.871]  If BlackRock wants to make... Oh, by the way, I'm turning the camera.
[02:36:02.871 --> 02:36:04.932]  This is one of the police checkpoints.
[02:36:04.932 --> 02:36:05.633]  Can you see it?
[02:36:05.633 --> 02:36:06.834]  This is the checkpoint.
[02:36:06.834 --> 02:36:07.634]  I was pulled over.
[02:36:07.634 --> 02:36:09.476]  Do you see these military vehicles?
[02:36:09.476 --> 02:36:10.497]  Do you see this?
[02:36:10.497 --> 02:36:12.238]  I don't know if you can see it because it's dark out.
[02:36:13.314 --> 02:36:16.596]  That's the checkpoint that I was pulled over earlier today, Alex.
[02:36:16.596 --> 02:36:17.756]  We saw you go through.
[02:36:17.756 --> 02:36:20.018]  Please continue.
[02:36:20.018 --> 02:36:24.000]  So BlackRock, here's the thing.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.741]  If someone wants to make money, God bless them.
[02:36:25.741 --> 02:36:27.762]  That's the American way, the Canadian way.
[02:36:27.762 --> 02:36:31.744]  If you want to reduce taxes and, you know, bullet to you.
[02:36:31.744 --> 02:36:37.167]  But what gets me about Larry Fink and BlackRock, which has over $10 trillion in assets under management,
[02:36:37.981 --> 02:36:39.883]  Is they want to be politicians.
[02:36:39.883 --> 02:36:47.028]  They want to shape policy, foreign policy, domestic policy, cultural Marxism, but they don't want to bother being elected.
[02:36:47.028 --> 02:36:49.050]  They don't want to bother going through the legislature.
[02:36:49.050 --> 02:36:55.375]  So the Larry Fink's of the world and the Bill Gates is of the world and the Al Gore's of the world.
[02:36:55.375 --> 02:36:59.738]  By the way, Gates and Fink are on the board of directors of the World Economic Forum.
[02:36:59.738 --> 02:37:03.902]  They meet in this secret conclave and they're on par with world leaders.
[02:37:03.902 --> 02:37:06.444]  So you'll have the odd world leader attend here.
[02:37:07.310 --> 02:37:13.155]  And they're on a panel as equals with some billionaire who just paid to play.
[02:37:13.155 --> 02:37:25.266]  So what they're trying to do here is take decision-making for ordinary citizens out of the Congress, out of the Canadian Parliament, out of the hands of elected legislators.
[02:37:25.266 --> 02:37:28.048]  And I was reading your own deputy leader under Trudeau.
[02:37:28.048 --> 02:37:30.370]  She's there.
[02:37:30.370 --> 02:37:31.091]  Absolutely.
[02:37:31.091 --> 02:37:33.433]  In fact, Chrystia Freeland is her name.
[02:37:33.433 --> 02:37:34.774]  You won't even believe this, Alex.
[02:37:35.584 --> 02:37:45.290]  She was the authorized biographer of George Soros before she became Canada's Deputy Prime Minister.
[02:37:45.290 --> 02:37:45.810]  That's my point.
[02:37:45.810 --> 02:37:49.613]  She was on the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum.
[02:37:49.613 --> 02:37:51.254]  So I got a question for you.
[02:37:51.254 --> 02:37:55.757]  Are you loyal to the Canadian government and the Canadian people and the Canadian Constitution?
[02:37:55.757 --> 02:37:57.738]  You better be because you're in our cabinet.
[02:37:58.504 --> 02:38:07.408]  Or are you loyal to the Board of Trustees of the World Economic Forum run by some crazy Bond villain caricature named Klaus Schwab?
[02:38:07.408 --> 02:38:09.769]  You can't ride two horses, Alex.
[02:38:09.769 --> 02:38:15.651]  And Chrystia Freeland, I don't know whose side she's loyal to, but let me close with one more point.
[02:38:15.651 --> 02:38:18.732]  You know what they talk about a lot here at the World Economic Forum, Alex?
[02:38:18.732 --> 02:38:19.993]  They talk about something
[02:38:20.774 --> 02:38:23.956]  They call it global citizenship.
[02:38:23.956 --> 02:38:25.656]  Global citizenship.
[02:38:25.656 --> 02:38:26.497]  Well, what does that mean?
[02:38:26.497 --> 02:38:28.358]  I know what it means to be a citizen of Canada.
[02:38:28.358 --> 02:38:29.418]  That's who I am.
[02:38:29.418 --> 02:38:33.780]  And you sure know what it means to be a citizen of the United States of America.
[02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:42.425]  You know what rights it gives you, and what responsibilities, and what power, and you know how you relate to your elected officials.
[02:38:42.425 --> 02:38:44.205]  But what does it mean?
[02:38:44.205 --> 02:38:45.366]  Global citizenship.
[02:38:46.152 --> 02:38:48.134]  Who is my boss?
[02:38:48.134 --> 02:38:50.455]  How do I get my voice heard?
[02:38:50.455 --> 02:38:52.197]  Who's the king?
[02:38:52.197 --> 02:39:06.067]  Well, the king is a tyrant named Klaus Schwab and his right-hand man Larry Fink and the other people who either pay to play like other billionaires or oligarchs or other progressives in the global citizenship that they are promoting.
[02:39:06.067 --> 02:39:07.608]  You actually have no rights.
[02:39:07.608 --> 02:39:10.350]  You can't throw the bums out.
[02:39:10.350 --> 02:39:13.052]  And so it's a perversion of the words.
[02:39:13.052 --> 02:39:14.533]  It's not citizenship at all.
[02:39:15.211 --> 02:39:19.555]  You're now being a subject, maybe even a bit of a slave.
[02:39:19.555 --> 02:39:26.680]  That's what they're working on here and the mass of the media just love it, Alex.
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:32.285]  Well, the good news is the world's waking up and they're reporting Soros isn't going.
[02:39:32.285 --> 02:39:33.506]  Up to half the list isn't going.
[02:39:33.506 --> 02:39:36.708]  I agree they're more powerful than ever, but they're being identified.
[02:39:38.109 --> 02:39:43.911]  And in the international polls, the Davos group, we just lost our link there, that happens to these live feeds.
[02:39:43.911 --> 02:39:46.012]  I mean, this is just an incredible time.
[02:39:46.012 --> 02:39:47.872]  We're back to Ezra Levin.
[02:39:47.872 --> 02:39:53.694]  Ezra, the forced injections, it coming out the vaccines aren't vaccines, and hurt people.
[02:39:53.694 --> 02:39:59.516]  All this news about the government suppressing the peaceful caravan last year.
[02:39:59.516 --> 02:40:01.237]  I really feel like humanity's on the march.
[02:40:01.237 --> 02:40:03.858]  We're not winning yet, but I think we're starting to turn the tide.
[02:40:03.858 --> 02:40:04.318]  What do you think?
[02:40:05.726 --> 02:40:06.586]  I think so, too.
[02:40:06.586 --> 02:40:14.348]  You know, I was there, as you know, in Canada during the trucker convoy, and I want to remind you and all your viewers who sometimes despair.
[02:40:14.348 --> 02:40:15.588]  Well, remember those truckers.
[02:40:15.588 --> 02:40:18.108]  They didn't have any political party backing them.
[02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:20.009]  They didn't have any super PAC.
[02:40:20.009 --> 02:40:26.690]  They didn't have any... They were an organic group of grassroots people who stood up.
[02:40:26.690 --> 02:40:31.331]  It was a spontaneous, authentic movement, as George Orwell said in his book of 1984.
[02:40:33.197 --> 02:40:35.098]  The proles will save us.
[02:40:35.098 --> 02:40:36.319]  He meant the proletariat.
[02:40:36.319 --> 02:40:41.701]  Ordinary working people saved Canada from Justin Trudeau's tyranny.
[02:40:41.701 --> 02:40:44.002]  And maybe there's a flicker of hope out there.
[02:40:44.002 --> 02:40:51.246]  So, can we possibly win against the Klaus Schwab's and the Larry Fink's of the world?
[02:40:51.246 --> 02:40:54.928]  I mean, they got so much money, they got everything stitched up from the inside.
[02:40:54.928 --> 02:40:57.849]  Can we possibly, possibly win?
[02:40:57.849 --> 02:40:59.930]  Well, where there's life, there's hope, Alex.
[02:40:59.930 --> 02:41:01.871]  And I put to you that the case of the Canadian
[02:41:02.741 --> 02:41:08.283]  Trucker says, just when things look awful, don't count out the human spirit, my friend.
[02:41:08.283 --> 02:41:12.365]  I'm going through a tunnel in Switzerland, so you might lose me here.
[02:41:12.365 --> 02:41:14.066]  But boy, it's been good to catch up with you.
[02:41:14.066 --> 02:41:20.789]  We're putting all our videos up on wefreports.com in case people want to see them for themselves.
[02:41:20.789 --> 02:41:23.830]  And I'm happy to keep in touch with you in the days ahead if you want more.
[02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:26.111]  I'm just going in that tunnel now, just FYI.
[02:41:26.511 --> 02:41:27.752]  Well, you're still there, yes.
[02:41:27.752 --> 02:41:29.915]  I want you to come on Harrison Smith's show tomorrow.
[02:41:29.915 --> 02:41:31.096]  We're kicking off at 8 a.m.
[02:41:31.096 --> 02:41:32.017]  on Emergency.
[02:41:32.017 --> 02:41:33.719]  Alex Jones is right.
[02:41:33.719 --> 02:41:37.282]  Broadcasts and so much positive things are happening.
[02:41:37.282 --> 02:41:39.344]  I mean, look at all the poison shot news.
[02:41:39.344 --> 02:41:43.829]  The FDA admitting they got lied to, admitting the shots don't work, admitting it's killing people.
[02:41:43.829 --> 02:41:45.531]  I mean, we're seeing devastating victories.
[02:41:47.429 --> 02:41:54.455]  Well, you know, Albert Bourla, the head of Pfizer, you know, they're thick as thieves with the World Economic Forum.
[02:41:54.455 --> 02:42:05.724]  And you probably know that clip where Bourla was brainstorming with Klaus Schwab and others about a fantasy pill for the future that Pfizer was daydreaming of.
[02:42:05.724 --> 02:42:08.526]  I don't know if you know the clip I'm talking about, where the pill
[02:42:09.184 --> 02:42:11.906]  Yeah, where the pill literally had a chip in it.
[02:42:11.906 --> 02:42:20.491]  Now that used to be the stuff of conspiracy theories, but that's how they talk at the World Economic Forum when they think they're just amongst friends.
[02:42:20.491 --> 02:42:22.273]  That's the crazy thing.
[02:42:22.273 --> 02:42:25.695]  They actually say the secret part out loud.
[02:42:26.275 --> 02:42:33.119]  And so now that citizen journalists are catching on, they're thinking, oh, maybe we better take this to another secret gathering.
[02:42:33.119 --> 02:42:33.599]  Well, that's right.
[02:42:33.599 --> 02:42:41.523]  The shadow government, because we know Davos is the Bilderberg Group's public mouthpiece, they're being exposed, and that's at the battle.
[02:42:41.523 --> 02:42:42.863]  Thank you so much, Ezra Levant.
[02:42:42.863 --> 02:42:45.125]  We'll talk to you again tomorrow from rebelnews.com.
[02:42:45.125 --> 02:42:47.406]  God bless you and be safe.
[02:42:47.406 --> 02:42:48.046]  Thanks, you too.
[02:42:48.046 --> 02:42:49.327]  Bye-bye.
[02:42:49.327 --> 02:42:49.647]  Wow.
[02:42:49.647 --> 02:42:51.328]  We'll be right back with your phone calls and breaking news.
[02:42:51.328 --> 02:42:51.628]  Stay with us.
[02:42:58.266 --> 02:43:13.454]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance to get a historic signed copy of my number one best-selling book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[02:43:13.454 --> 02:43:18.137]  Yes, you can get the book in stores, you can find it online, but if you want to get a historic signed copy,
[02:43:18.237 --> 02:43:18.697]  I think so.
[02:43:34.147 --> 02:43:36.148]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later.
[02:43:36.148 --> 02:43:39.869]  There's a piece of art that goes with the book, but I haven't even decided when I'm going to do that.
[02:43:39.869 --> 02:43:40.929]  It may never happen.
[02:43:40.929 --> 02:43:50.753]  But for just simple, straight-up signed books, and to be part of this fundraiser, this is the last time you'll be able to get the signed book at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:43:50.753 --> 02:43:52.013]  I thank you all for your support.
[02:43:52.013 --> 02:43:57.735]  Please go to InfoWarsTore.com and get your signed book today, and I thank you for keeping us in the fight against the globalists.
[02:43:57.935 --> 02:44:03.937]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you The Wellness Company.
[02:44:05.228 --> 02:44:15.616]  An alternative healthcare system for this COVID and post-COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors and healthcare systems.
[02:44:15.616 --> 02:44:28.345]  This new online virtual platform is nationwide providing uncensored content, virtual appointments, laboratory testing, diagnostics, prescriptions,
[02:44:29.025 --> 02:44:29.545]  Thank you.
[02:44:58.129 --> 02:45:04.294]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war, and it takes money to fund an information war.
[02:45:04.294 --> 02:45:17.285]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level, and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear, and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting infowarestore.com right now and taking action.
[02:45:17.285 --> 02:45:22.249]  I thank you for your vast support, and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[02:45:22.669 --> 02:45:24.290]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:45:24.290 --> 02:45:26.591]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[02:45:26.591 --> 02:45:28.052]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:45:28.052 --> 02:45:29.313]  They're coming for me.
[02:45:29.313 --> 02:45:30.554]  They're coming for the children.
[02:45:30.554 --> 02:45:33.115]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[02:45:33.115 --> 02:45:36.477]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[02:45:36.477 --> 02:45:37.798]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[02:45:38.038 --> 02:45:40.139]  Look, it's not hype when you've delivered.
[02:46:01.110 --> 02:46:03.912]  And InfoWars has been the tip of spear against tyranny.
[02:46:03.912 --> 02:46:09.295]  And when it comes to products we sell to fund our operation, they're just like our news and information.
[02:46:09.295 --> 02:46:11.516]  They are powerful and they change the world.
[02:46:12.196 --> 02:46:18.060]  The Real Red Pill Plus is one of our top sellers, but for over two years, it's been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:46:18.060 --> 02:46:20.781]  It's finally back in stock.
[02:46:20.781 --> 02:46:22.442]  We're 50% off at Infolreshore.com.
[02:46:22.442 --> 02:46:28.386]  Now, in the limited time we have, I can't get into all the ingredients they're in, but this sucker is amazing.
[02:46:28.386 --> 02:46:33.689]  Look for yourself at how loaded each bottle is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:33.689 --> 02:46:38.032]  Every one of these will supercharge your day and everything you do.
[02:46:38.032 --> 02:46:40.834]  Just look at the Preglanone that we've got that's in this product.

[02:46:50.799 --> 02:46:54.401]  This is as close as the Matrix Red Pill as you're going to get.
[02:46:54.401 --> 02:46:59.444]  Red Pill Plus, 50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:59.444 --> 02:47:05.348]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:11.237 --> 02:47:13.298]  Alright, these aren't words I'm saying right now.
[02:47:13.298 --> 02:47:15.460]  These are important facts.
[02:47:15.460 --> 02:47:24.825]  I need everybody on your email, your text message, your word of mouth, everybody to tune in tomorrow to ConspiracyFact.info and to share that link.
[02:47:24.825 --> 02:47:27.826]  We've got a raft of incredible guests at 8 a.m.
[02:47:27.826 --> 02:47:30.448]  right through midnight tomorrow and it's a fundraiser.
[02:47:30.788 --> 02:47:32.230]  I'm not going to belabor this.
[02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:34.494]  It's your decision whether we stay on air or not.
[02:47:34.494 --> 02:47:36.317]  Our goals are very easy to reach.
[02:47:36.317 --> 02:47:37.879]  These are products you already need.
[02:47:37.879 --> 02:47:40.303]  Go get Real Red Bill Plus.
[02:47:41.323 --> 02:47:44.065]  Go get Down and Out, our great sleep aid.
[02:47:44.065 --> 02:47:49.029]  Go get Tumor 95, that's the same as bodies, 95% Humanoid.
[02:47:49.029 --> 02:47:52.932]  Go get our great products at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[02:47:52.932 --> 02:47:55.214]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[02:47:55.214 --> 02:47:59.678]  I encourage you now to take action at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:47:59.678 --> 02:48:06.723]  Okay, I want to go back to your phone calls, but here's a video that I remember seeing decades ago, but I only saw it last night on Twitter.
[02:48:08.104 --> 02:48:11.065]  It reminded me of it, that I'd seen it years ago.
[02:48:11.065 --> 02:48:13.326]  Video, child actress Shirley Temple.
[02:48:13.326 --> 02:48:16.788]  Shirley Temple exposes Hollywood pedophilia.
[02:48:16.788 --> 02:48:31.374]  And here she is, the biggest child star in history, a big actress after that, on Larry King Live, talking about pedophilia when she was 12 years old, and her mother, and all the rest of the stuff.
[02:48:31.374 --> 02:48:33.095]  And it ties into the next story we're going to cover.
[02:48:33.095 --> 02:48:33.415]  Here it is.
[02:48:34.511 --> 02:48:37.633]  When I left Fox, I went to MGM for one picture.
[02:48:37.633 --> 02:48:39.055]  Thank goodness, only one.
[02:48:39.055 --> 02:48:42.577]  And when I got there with my mother, we were separated.
[02:48:42.577 --> 02:48:47.281]  She went into the office of Louis B. Mayer, and I went into the office of Arthur Fried.
[02:48:47.281 --> 02:48:50.463]  And he was going to talk to me about a movie he wanted to put me in.
[02:48:50.463 --> 02:48:52.104]  I'm 12 years old, you know.
[02:48:52.104 --> 02:48:57.068]  And I thought he was a producer, but instead he was an exhibitor.
[02:48:57.068 --> 02:49:00.271]  And I'd never seen anyone naked before, except myself.
[02:49:00.271 --> 02:49:02.212]  So I had no clue about what was happening.
[02:49:04.384 --> 02:49:06.885]  So it struck me so funny, I laughed at him.
[02:49:06.885 --> 02:49:08.445]  And I laughed uproariously.
[02:49:08.445 --> 02:49:09.545]  I had tears, you know.
[02:49:09.545 --> 02:49:10.606]  And he got infuriated.
[02:49:10.606 --> 02:49:12.566]  And he said, out, out, out, go!
[02:49:12.566 --> 02:49:13.606]  Did you tell your mother?
[02:49:13.606 --> 02:49:14.266]  Well, I went down.
[02:49:14.266 --> 02:49:14.967]  It was very quiet.
[02:49:14.967 --> 02:49:17.767]  I went down and met her in the lobby of the administration building.
[02:49:17.767 --> 02:49:20.488]  She came out very quietly from Louis B. Mayer's office.
[02:49:20.488 --> 02:49:23.929]  And we walked hand in hand, silently, to the car, which was unusual.
[02:49:23.929 --> 02:49:25.129]  We got in the car, driving home.
[02:49:25.129 --> 02:49:28.510]  I said, Mom, you won't believe what happened to me.
[02:49:28.510 --> 02:49:31.231]  And I told her what happened, and she got kind of quiet.
[02:49:31.231 --> 02:49:32.791]  And she said, well, you don't know what happened to me.
[02:49:34.202 --> 02:49:38.583]  So Shirley Temple at 12 goes into a room at MGM and the head of the studio is naked trying to have sex with her.
[02:49:38.583 --> 02:49:40.384]  Total domination.
[02:49:40.384 --> 02:49:40.864]  Total control.
[02:50:00.182 --> 02:50:03.224]  But now they don't want to just rape our daughters and sons.
[02:50:03.224 --> 02:50:05.606]  They want to cut their testicles and breast off.
[02:50:05.606 --> 02:50:09.208]  They make it trendy and fun and promote it like it's normal everywhere.
[02:50:09.208 --> 02:50:16.553]  Instead of hiding it in an office or in a dungeon, they make it normal and, oh, everybody's for this.
[02:50:16.553 --> 02:50:22.597]  So there's a video of your TV viewer of little Shirley Temple, and then she's 12 years old,
[02:50:23.516 --> 02:50:31.480]  And they march her in to a room where the head of the studio wants to have sex with her, and there's Larry King laughing about it.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:36.082]  So New York moves to allow biological males to be housed in women's prisons.
[02:50:36.082 --> 02:50:38.043]  That's the governor.
[02:50:38.043 --> 02:50:43.186]  Attacking women's spaces, attacking women in the name of women.
[02:50:43.186 --> 02:50:45.567]  Monstrous.
[02:50:45.567 --> 02:50:51.130]  But they just thought of a new Martin Luther King sculpture, $50 million, a giant penis.
[02:50:52.588 --> 02:50:55.108]  Welcome to the Miss Universe Organization!
[02:51:22.608 --> 02:51:26.370]  From now on, it's going to be run by women.
[02:51:26.370 --> 02:51:27.351]  Women.
[02:51:27.351 --> 02:51:29.652]  Owned by Kwon Sooman.
[02:51:29.652 --> 02:51:31.493]  For all women.
[02:51:31.493 --> 02:51:38.137]  Women.
[02:51:38.137 --> 02:51:39.758]  This is wild.
[02:51:39.758 --> 02:51:45.262]  For all women really around the world to celebrate the power of feminism.
[02:51:45.262 --> 02:51:47.363]  The power of feminism is a man.
[02:51:47.363 --> 02:51:48.804]  Diverse cultures.
[02:51:50.109 --> 02:52:01.556]  Social inclusion, gender equality, creativity, all funded by the big corporations, all meant to take over society.
[02:52:01.556 --> 02:52:03.697]  This is their weapon system.
[02:52:03.697 --> 02:52:08.120]  All they offer is poison and death.
[02:52:08.120 --> 02:52:10.181]  Think about that.
[02:52:10.181 --> 02:52:14.404]  But again, I'm actually resigned now.
[02:52:14.404 --> 02:52:16.105]  I'm going to do the show as good as I can.
[02:52:16.105 --> 02:52:18.367]  I'm going to cover the news as hardcore as I can.
[02:52:19.312 --> 02:52:24.898]  But if listeners don't want to go to M4Shore.com and help us stay on air, that's fine.
[02:52:24.898 --> 02:52:28.882]  In fact, maybe Alex Jones has served his time.
[02:52:28.882 --> 02:52:31.145]  Because I see societal breakdown.
[02:52:31.145 --> 02:52:33.327]  I see what's going on.
[02:52:33.327 --> 02:52:34.729]  But I think I should stay in the fight.
[02:52:35.657 --> 02:52:36.978]  We have products you already need.
[02:52:36.978 --> 02:52:40.379]  I think you should go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and get those.
[02:52:40.379 --> 02:52:42.420]  Because our goal is so easy.
[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:44.160]  $200,000 a month extra.
[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:44.901]  We can pay the bills.
[02:52:44.901 --> 02:52:46.021]  We can stay on air.
[02:52:46.021 --> 02:52:47.422]  That's what we need.
[02:52:47.422 --> 02:52:48.882]  And that's in your court.
[02:52:48.882 --> 02:52:50.483]  That's in your hands.
[02:52:50.483 --> 02:52:52.243]  I'm not a quitter, folks.
[02:52:52.243 --> 02:52:53.604]  I'm not.
[02:52:53.604 --> 02:52:56.785]  But it's really up to you.
[02:52:56.785 --> 02:52:57.846]  We have products you need.
[02:52:57.846 --> 02:53:00.287]  Amazing products that will change your life.
[02:53:00.287 --> 02:53:01.267]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:53:02.782 --> 02:53:12.327]  You can go to 1776coin.com, 1776coin.com, and get the last Teddy Roosevelt coins, $30 off the promo code 1776.
[02:53:12.327 --> 02:53:14.868]  But it's really up to you.
[02:53:14.868 --> 02:53:19.691]  You've got to decide whether you want a signed copy of The Great Reads Set in the World for the World from Foursquare.com.
[02:53:20.231 --> 02:53:28.296]  You've got to decide whether you want the highest quality turmeric out there, Turmeric 95, 95% Humanoid for your body, your immune system, your joints, everything.
[02:53:28.296 --> 02:53:34.079]  You've got to decide whether you want the very best CBD oil, 50% off at InfoWorkshore.com.
[02:53:34.079 --> 02:53:35.640]  You've got to make those decisions.
[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:36.961]  I can't make those for you.
[02:53:36.961 --> 02:53:39.403]  You've got to make those and I appreciate your support.
[02:53:39.403 --> 02:53:41.284]  Donna in Texas, thanks for holding your own here.
[02:53:43.007 --> 02:53:44.428]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:44.428 --> 02:53:50.632]  First of all, God bless you for ultimately guiding people to God.
[02:53:50.632 --> 02:53:58.037]  And if anybody's going to support InfoWars, it's supporting, ultimately, the message of the Divine, of the Creator.
[02:53:58.037 --> 02:53:59.998]  So I want to say that.
[02:53:59.998 --> 02:54:05.322]  I believe everything that we're in, it's just a test of where we put our faith.
[02:54:05.322 --> 02:54:07.684]  Is our faith in the Divine and our Creator?
[02:54:07.684 --> 02:54:09.465]  For me, in Christ?
[02:54:09.465 --> 02:54:11.786]  Or is it in COVID?
[02:54:11.786 --> 02:54:12.807]  Which is our cause?
[02:54:13.294 --> 02:54:15.477]  Christ or COVID?
[02:54:15.477 --> 02:54:18.020]  And what I want to say about the jab is this.
[02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:19.702]  I've been in ministry for many years.
[02:54:19.702 --> 02:54:29.994]  My life is devoted to Christ and have been speaking and teaching, but also in the field of quantum physics and understanding wellness
[02:54:30.902 --> 02:54:33.644]  Human behavior and spirituality.
[02:54:33.644 --> 02:54:39.348]  Well, even Tim Robbins came out a month ago and said, or three weeks ago, the new religion is COVID.
[02:54:39.348 --> 02:54:40.169]  And he went along with it.
[02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:40.930]  He apologized.
[02:54:40.930 --> 02:54:45.033]  It is a new religion of worshiping Big Pharma.
[02:54:45.033 --> 02:54:45.593]  Yes.
[02:54:45.593 --> 02:54:49.636]  And it's deception because here's the point I wanted to make on your call.
[02:54:49.636 --> 02:54:58.603]  The elite know that when they put people, humanity, in a position to be a receiver of the jab, not a giver,
[02:54:59.386 --> 02:54:59.926]  We're good.
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:27.214]  It splits their left and right brain hemisphere into darkness and a black hole gravity pull that sucks in the negatives of the giver, the negatives of the jab.
[02:55:27.214 --> 02:55:31.480]  And so you lose the receiver, which is deceiver.
[02:55:31.480 --> 02:55:33.523]  The ones that receive are deceived.
[02:55:34.065 --> 02:55:40.071]  They are sucking in the negative and lost their life force and power to the giver.
[02:55:40.071 --> 02:55:43.835]  Whoever is the giver gets the power and the life force.
[02:55:43.835 --> 02:55:47.919]  And the receiver is deceived and suffers the consequences.
[02:55:47.919 --> 02:55:48.840]  I agree with you.
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:51.483]  That's why they always want to put us in a victim mentality.
[02:55:52.509 --> 02:56:01.236]  Yes, and so ultimately, of course, God is the answer, but there is a way, Alex, to correct for people to heal.
[02:56:01.236 --> 02:56:02.597]  But here's what I've found.
[02:56:02.597 --> 02:56:05.439]  I have tried to scream this out to the rooftops.
[02:56:05.439 --> 02:56:08.581]  Christ doesn't want people to just heal and feel comfortable.
[02:56:08.581 --> 02:56:10.063]  Christ wants a relationship.
[02:56:10.063 --> 02:56:13.925]  The divine wants the relationship to then heal them.
[02:56:13.925 --> 02:56:19.470]  But they can heal by ultimately correcting their relationship with the Creator first.
[02:56:19.470 --> 02:56:21.531]  Secondly, give back.
[02:56:21.531 --> 02:56:22.252]  This is energy.
[02:56:22.958 --> 02:56:32.821]  The way to correct the jab, the heart, the stroke, all heart and stroke stuff energetically in terms of quantum physics is because they've lost their life force to the giver.
[02:56:32.821 --> 02:56:33.341]  It's gone.
[02:56:33.341 --> 02:56:34.582]  They're suffering from that.
[02:56:34.582 --> 02:56:36.362]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:56:36.362 --> 02:56:37.163]  Very interesting.
[02:56:37.163 --> 02:56:38.703]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:38.703 --> 02:56:40.304]  Ken and Carol, last callers.
[02:56:41.044 --> 02:56:42.425]  Then our guest hosts are about to take over.
[02:56:42.425 --> 02:56:44.166]  They're going to knock it out of the park.
[02:56:44.166 --> 02:56:48.788]  And then in one hour, Owen Schroyer, The War Room, is going to be hosting.
[02:56:48.788 --> 02:56:50.809]  And then tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:55.531]  with Harrison Smith, American Journal, a raft of huge guests.
[02:56:55.531 --> 02:56:58.553]  And these are great guests, but these are not the only guests we've got on tomorrow.
[02:56:59.656 --> 02:57:16.087]  Savannah Hernandez, Alex Jones, Alex Newman on American Journal, Paul Joseph Watson on my show, Mark Passio, Hope Tepjesus, Drew Hernandez, Gab McGinnis, Dr. Judy Migovich, Maria Z, Roger Stone, Savannah Hernandez, Darren Beattie,
[02:57:16.727 --> 02:57:31.390]  Matt Baker, Dan Dix, Tom Renz, Jay Dyer with a SPARS update, with the newest information, Edward Dowd, Mickey Willis in studio, Alex Stein, Dr. Stella Emanuel, Robert Barnes, and more tomorrow.
[02:57:31.390 --> 02:57:33.910]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:38.351]  You share that link to your email, your text message, your word of mouth, it changes the world.
[02:57:38.351 --> 02:57:39.791]  Take action now.
[02:57:39.791 --> 02:57:42.292]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[02:57:42.292 --> 02:57:44.632]  ConspiracyFact.info.
[02:57:47.270 --> 02:57:59.790]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[02:58:02.584 --> 02:58:12.833]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame, exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind.
[02:58:12.833 --> 02:58:24.663]  And by the time they launched their attack in 2020, Alex Jones' InfoWars and our audience were there to warn the people of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[02:58:24.663 --> 02:58:26.205]  This is why they attack us.
[02:58:26.685 --> 02:58:29.208]  This is why we need your support.
[02:58:29.208 --> 02:58:31.009]  Because we tell the truth.
[02:58:31.009 --> 02:58:33.111]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:58:33.111 --> 02:58:35.634]  Join the resistance this Tuesday.
[02:58:35.634 --> 02:58:36.875]  All day long.
[02:58:36.875 --> 02:58:39.778]  The Alex Jones Was Right Marathon.
[02:58:39.778 --> 02:58:42.120]  Join us in the fight for freedom.
[02:58:42.120 --> 02:58:44.262]  And help us defeat the New World Order.
[02:58:46.957 --> 02:58:49.158]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:58:49.158 --> 02:58:50.959]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[02:58:50.959 --> 02:58:53.000]  This is an information war.
[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:57.682]  InfoWars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[02:58:57.682 --> 02:59:06.886]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump, or Governor DeSantis, or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms that InfoWars has popularized.
[02:59:06.886 --> 02:59:10.127]  Because we understand the enemy's operations, and we know how to beat them.
[02:59:10.547 --> 02:59:12.170]  But we can't do it without funding.
[02:59:12.170 --> 02:59:17.797]  And we make it easy to fund with great products that empower you and your immune system and your family as well.
[02:59:17.797 --> 02:59:21.743]  You can also make straight donations at mfulworthstore.com clicking on the big red banner.
[02:59:21.743 --> 02:59:23.145]  A one-time or recurring.
[02:59:23.145 --> 02:59:24.987]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[02:59:24.987 --> 02:59:25.788]  We're non-violent.
[02:59:26.209 --> 02:59:34.132]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products, every time you keep us on air, you are literally, non-violently, politically, punching the New World Order in the nose.
[02:59:34.132 --> 02:59:36.473]  Punching their lies in the nose.
[02:59:36.473 --> 02:59:38.293]  We are going to defeat the New World Order.
[02:59:38.293 --> 02:59:39.414]  We're going over the top.
[02:59:39.414 --> 02:59:40.934]  But right now is the critical juncture.
[02:59:40.934 --> 02:59:44.035]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com and donate now!
[02:59:44.035 --> 02:59:44.595]  Donate now!

[02:59:48.877 --> 02:59:54.779]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:00.998 --> 03:00:04.000]  All right, Jason Bernis is a great researcher.
[03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:05.440]  He takes over next segment.
[03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:08.802]  Right now we're taking calls from Carol in Florida, then Ken in Ohio.
[03:00:08.802 --> 03:00:12.684]  Go ahead, Carol.
[03:00:12.684 --> 03:00:14.985]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:14.985 --> 03:00:17.407]  Welcome.
[03:00:17.407 --> 03:00:17.987]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:17.987 --> 03:00:18.787]  This is Carol.
[03:00:18.787 --> 03:00:27.092]  I wanted to let you know I was looking into the Armed Services Blood Program, and it alarmed me because they had a
[03:00:27.979 --> 03:00:40.164]  All through January, they're having a military-wide blood drive, and I find that really, I don't think that's very good because of the spike proteins, and we know the troops all had to have the shot.
[03:00:40.164 --> 03:00:57.152]  And so I went on Armed Services Blood Program at Health.no, and it says that they provide blood products for service members, veterans, and their families, and it also goes on to say that
[03:00:57.731 --> 03:01:01.094]  They work closely with civilian counterparts.
[03:01:01.094 --> 03:01:10.121]  Now, all of the blood from our military could potentially be given to people all through the United States and around the world.
[03:01:10.121 --> 03:01:11.782]  Yeah, it's a lot worse than that.
[03:01:11.782 --> 03:01:12.903]  It's confirmed.
[03:01:12.903 --> 03:01:18.287]  They're now giving cows, pigs, and other animals the mRNA shots to infect their meat.
[03:01:18.287 --> 03:01:19.368]  It's a total takeover.
[03:01:19.368 --> 03:01:21.009]  Yes, you're definitely on target.
[03:01:22.316 --> 03:01:31.238]  Okay, so Dr. Peter McCullough said that the blood product will, it does contain the spice protein up to four months.
[03:01:31.238 --> 03:01:31.698]  No, it does.
[03:01:31.698 --> 03:01:32.778]  And so the U.S.
[03:01:32.778 --> 03:01:36.578]  blood product is totally infested and contaminated.
[03:01:36.578 --> 03:01:40.979]  Switzerland is offering non-vaccinated blood versus vaccinated blood.
[03:01:40.979 --> 03:01:49.241]  They are taking children from people in places like Australia who don't take the poison shot or who won't take a blood transfusion.
[03:01:49.241 --> 03:01:50.721]  This is a total takeover.
[03:01:52.213 --> 03:01:53.033]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:01:53.033 --> 03:01:55.835]  I appreciate all you've done for everyone.
[03:01:55.835 --> 03:02:02.999]  And my son was coerced into getting the vaccine, and Dr. Zeb Zelenko's protocol, I believe, saved his life.
[03:02:02.999 --> 03:02:03.920]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:02:03.920 --> 03:02:04.680]  Great news, Carol.
[03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:05.200]  Thank you.
[03:02:05.200 --> 03:02:09.062]  Ken in Ohio, go ahead.
[03:02:09.062 --> 03:02:10.223]  Yes, Alex.
[03:02:10.223 --> 03:02:10.983]  Yes.
[03:02:10.983 --> 03:02:15.406]  Reporting live from Columbus, where they've taken down all the Columbus statues.
[03:02:15.406 --> 03:02:20.889]  I just want to say, I'll get right to my main point, and that is monetizing Band.Video.
[03:02:21.488 --> 03:02:24.229]  And that is, I think you should monetize your greatest skill.
[03:02:24.229 --> 03:02:29.591]  And I see you with the conspiracyfact.info, so I'm definitely going to check that out.
[03:02:29.591 --> 03:02:38.094]  But if you were interested in, you know, getting, you know, monetizing Bandot Video, I think I have a simple strategy for doing so.
[03:02:38.094 --> 03:02:46.157]  And I think what you could do is, you could remove that little 10-second ad that you have before many of your videos on Bandot Video.
[03:02:46.157 --> 03:02:48.978]  So like, say, for premium subscribers could sign up for, say,
[03:02:49.477 --> 03:03:02.001]  Yeah, so I'm thinking, you know, often you'll say something that by the end of the week I want to go back and I want to review it, but I don't remember exactly what day you said it on, so I bounce around and do a few different videos, but I hit that ad every time.
[03:03:17.406 --> 03:03:23.471]  So I'm saying, you know, you offer me the ability to say, you know, you could undercut YouTube at like $10, $11, you know, $12.
[03:03:23.471 --> 03:03:26.513]  I would pay that because I'm on Bandai Video as much as I can.
[03:03:26.513 --> 03:03:32.537]  So just like YouTube has YouTube Red, we should have Bandai Video ad-free.
[03:03:32.537 --> 03:03:37.721]  Yeah, Bandai Video Red, Bandai Video Premium, Bandai Video Platinum, whatever you want to call it.
[03:03:37.721 --> 03:03:39.002]  You know, and I see you doing all those different stuff.
[03:03:39.002 --> 03:03:39.743]  No, that's a great idea, brother.
[03:03:39.743 --> 03:03:40.423]  That's a great idea.
[03:03:43.247 --> 03:03:47.851]  I think, you know, I definitely would sign up and I think that's a way to fund the InfoWars.
[03:03:47.851 --> 03:04:08.967]  You know, I think your broadcasting, you are underappreciated as your broadcasting and your journalism and I see people like, I don't even want to say the guy's name, but that interview you did recently, I think you did excellent on and the idea that he wants to position himself as a journalist and somehow you're not, I think that's laughable and I think you should completely own your journalistic integrity
[03:04:10.858 --> 03:04:14.659]  I don't care about any of that.
[03:04:14.659 --> 03:04:16.360]  I just want to beat the globalists.
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:16.920]  But I hear you.
[03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:17.961]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[03:04:17.961 --> 03:04:18.321]  Thank you.
[03:04:18.321 --> 03:04:19.041]  All right.
[03:04:19.041 --> 03:04:21.482]  Jason Bermas is a great researcher, filmmaker.
[03:04:21.482 --> 03:04:25.424]  He's about to take over and cover the waterfront of big issues that are breaking now.
[03:04:25.424 --> 03:04:29.185]  And then in an hour from now, Owen Schroyer and the War Room.
[03:04:29.185 --> 03:04:30.066]  And then tomorrow,
[03:04:31.328 --> 03:04:33.530]  Hashtag Alex was right.
[03:04:33.530 --> 03:04:34.511]  We want to promote that.
[03:04:34.511 --> 03:04:35.792]  We want to get everybody to tune in.
[03:04:35.792 --> 03:04:43.017]  We want to get all the listeners, all the guests that are coming on, to promote the show and get millions of new people to tune in and really expose the Globals.
[03:04:43.017 --> 03:04:44.519]  We're having big victories.
[03:04:44.519 --> 03:04:46.680]  The Poison Shots are being exposed.
[03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:48.422]  The Deimos Group is being exposed.
[03:04:48.422 --> 03:04:51.744]  We're actually winning right now, which is very, very positive.
[03:04:51.744 --> 03:04:53.366]  Hashtag Alex was right.
[03:04:58.854 --> 03:05:02.778]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[03:05:02.778 --> 03:05:11.646]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsTore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[03:05:11.646 --> 03:05:16.730]  Gallon out sleep support, liquid, it's very fast acting, take it under the tongue.
[03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:19.113]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin.
[03:05:19.793 --> 03:05:24.998]  Passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[03:05:24.998 --> 03:05:31.364]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[03:05:31.364 --> 03:05:35.568]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[03:05:35.928 --> 03:05:38.529]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well, and they're excellent.
[03:05:38.529 --> 03:05:39.950]  They're all different formulas.
[03:05:39.950 --> 03:05:44.031]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[03:05:44.031 --> 03:05:49.314]  So Down and Out, sold out for more than five months, is now back available at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:05:49.314 --> 03:05:57.097]  So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system, and support the InfoWar with Down and Out Sleep Support and InfoWarStore.
[03:06:04.423 --> 03:06:10.430]  Hey everybody, Jason Burmess here, and happy Martin Luther King Jr.
[03:06:10.430 --> 03:06:11.591]  Day.
[03:06:11.591 --> 03:06:21.882]  I would like to invite all of you to now come into and take part in what I believe is the second civil rights movement.
[03:06:22.481 --> 03:06:33.964]  Not only in this country, but around the world, because it is literally team human, team humanity, against a transhumanist predator class.
[03:06:33.964 --> 03:06:44.547]  And it was so hard for me to figure out what I wanted to start and lead with today, because so many things that were discussed, at least on the portion of the show that I watched,
[03:06:45.742 --> 03:06:56.765]  We could start, for instance, with the Albert Borrella clip, where he's talking about the Internet of Bodies, essentially, and this new medical tyranny that makes sure what?
[03:06:56.765 --> 03:06:58.146]  Compliance?
[03:06:58.146 --> 03:07:00.026]  You will take your medication.
[03:07:00.026 --> 03:07:02.747]  In fact, we will be playing that clip.
[03:07:02.747 --> 03:07:11.049]  You just saw the absurdity of a man talking about feminism and women's rights in a beauty pageant.
[03:07:11.049 --> 03:07:12.250]  Well, I've got news for you.
[03:07:12.250 --> 03:07:13.330]  It's something we're going to have to hit.
[03:07:14.289 --> 03:07:23.172]  The transgender movement is a transhuman movement, and they want you to disassociate from biology.
[03:07:23.172 --> 03:07:26.073]  And if you dare to question it, you are a bigot.
[03:07:26.073 --> 03:07:42.239]  If you think I'm wrong about that, we've actually done a much longer piece, but I would suggest that you check out From Transgender to Transhuman, a manifesto on the freedom of form, where the very first paragraph is billions of sexes.
[03:07:42.239 --> 03:07:42.379]  Now,
[03:07:43.018 --> 03:07:47.622]  If you know anything about the people at the top, they don't really want billions of people, but billions of sexes?
[03:07:47.622 --> 03:07:49.063]  You bet!
[03:07:49.063 --> 03:08:06.636]  It tells you that there are not two sexes, and that when this birthing process is through, when they have their agenda pushed, okay, it will be like labeling somebody black or white in South African Apartheid.
[03:08:06.636 --> 03:08:08.998]  And you could say, oh, well that's just some coup, Jason.
[03:08:08.998 --> 03:08:10.159]  Who wrote that?
[03:08:10.896 --> 03:08:18.879]  The most powerful, rich, transgender person on the planet, Martine Rothblatt.
[03:08:18.879 --> 03:08:22.160]  This is indeed an agenda.
[03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:23.701]  It is out in the open.
[03:08:23.701 --> 03:08:28.743]  This person has started their own movement and religion called TerraSim.
[03:08:28.743 --> 03:08:29.543]  It's right here.
[03:08:29.543 --> 03:08:30.723]  You can go to their foundation.
[03:08:30.723 --> 03:08:32.484]  It's lovely.
[03:08:32.484 --> 03:08:37.866]  They're at the forefront of another type of transhumanism because what's going on right now
[03:08:38.931 --> 03:08:55.250]  With the mRNA injections, the hate and lies shots that are being distributed, the multitude of these medications, okay, and what I would call DARPA-driven bioweapons that are being injected into everything at this point, that's one part of the experiment.
[03:08:56.997 --> 03:09:04.200]  Human Xenotransplantation, where you're growing organs in pigs and distributing them, is another part of that experiment.
[03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:08.362]  They want you to merge with the machines while they take hold of humanity.
[03:09:08.362 --> 03:09:12.884]  Alex isn't, you know, blowing smoke up your bottom about that.
[03:09:12.884 --> 03:09:20.508]  Unzipped Genes, written by Rothblatt in 97, said they would take charge of the birthing process.
[03:09:21.920 --> 03:09:30.462]  These people are very out in the open about changing the genetics of the human species and bringing in a virtual environment.
[03:09:30.462 --> 03:09:31.362]  We're going to cover it all.
[03:09:31.362 --> 03:09:39.324]  And all of it, all of it is out in the open and being driven by the globalists.
[03:09:39.324 --> 03:09:42.805]  And when I say globalists, let me be really specific with everybody.
[03:09:42.805 --> 03:09:50.807]  The Davos crew, the United Nations, and the World Health Organization are all down like a clown Charlie Brown.
[03:09:52.495 --> 03:10:09.398]  I almost started this broadcast like I started my broadcast earlier today with when silence becomes betrayal from Martin Luther King now I get that I have a dream stuff great there's a ton of great stuff out there via Martin Luther King jr.
[03:10:09.398 --> 03:10:20.960]  but silence when silence becomes betrayal he talks about conformity he talks about a war on the poor class doesn't matter if you're white or black he also talks about
[03:10:21.613 --> 03:10:25.856]  Betraying himself and not speaking out enough.
[03:10:25.856 --> 03:10:36.883]  Well, if you were hip to what was going on initially during the COVID 1984 nightmare and you tried to keep your head down, you knew that you were betraying humanity.
[03:10:36.883 --> 03:10:38.044]  Step up now.
[03:10:38.044 --> 03:10:38.764]  Come into the fray.
[03:10:38.764 --> 03:10:41.626]  Because we got a ton of videos illustrating this.
[03:10:41.626 --> 03:10:43.167]  We're going to be talking about not only
[03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:50.023]  This virtual reality and this transgender movement that is 100% backed by these people.
[03:10:50.023 --> 03:10:52.324]  We're going to talk about automation.
[03:10:52.324 --> 03:10:53.685]  OK.
[03:10:53.685 --> 03:10:56.126]  And really, I think.
[03:10:56.126 --> 03:10:59.248]  Wolves in sheep clothing, Trojan horses.
[03:10:59.248 --> 03:11:00.068]  All right.
[03:11:00.068 --> 03:11:04.690]  But just to illustrate why this is important, let's take a look.
[03:11:04.690 --> 03:11:05.671]  This is Rolf Blatt.
[03:11:06.793 --> 03:11:13.058]  And the wife of RawBlood is actually a robot and an AI built for Terrasim.
[03:11:13.058 --> 03:11:14.859]  You can't make this stuff up.
[03:11:14.859 --> 03:11:17.001]  That is a reality.
[03:11:17.001 --> 03:11:22.485]  They're saying that this person is the richest CEO, woman CEO, in the world.
[03:11:22.485 --> 03:11:23.986]  Okay?
[03:11:23.986 --> 03:11:26.287]  Again, this is the absurdity you have to live under.
[03:11:26.287 --> 03:11:26.908]  And here we go.
[03:11:28.107 --> 03:11:32.929]  So promoting gender ideology under the World Health Organization.
[03:11:32.929 --> 03:11:35.730]  This is absolutely 100% out in the open push.
[03:11:35.730 --> 03:11:38.351]  It's part of their sustainability agenda.
[03:11:38.351 --> 03:11:39.572]  Okay?
[03:11:39.572 --> 03:11:44.213]  This is the World Health Organization, gender and health, right here.
[03:11:44.213 --> 03:11:55.018]  And Biden has echoed all of these things, especially over at the Global Fund, where he said, investing in this, you know, you thought Gates at Davos with
[03:11:56.022 --> 03:12:03.505]  Vaccine investment at a 20-to-1 return where he said, well that's just about better than anything else out there!
[03:12:03.505 --> 03:12:05.066]  31-to-1.
[03:12:05.066 --> 03:12:09.688]  Remember when he was shaking around like, I think I'm going to shake someone here and they're going to put me in.
[03:12:09.688 --> 03:12:11.829]  He was introduced by Bill Gates at that thing.
[03:12:11.829 --> 03:12:14.350]  He could barely speak for the five minutes he did.
[03:12:14.350 --> 03:12:20.733]  He got like a standing ovation when he said 31-to-1 return and then when he went off to the side,
[03:12:21.420 --> 03:12:30.262]  They pushed him back into the middle so he could take pictures with other puppets, like Trudeau, Macron, the usual suspects.
[03:12:30.262 --> 03:12:31.442]  The worst of the worst.
[03:12:31.442 --> 03:12:32.322]  This is the agenda.
[03:12:32.322 --> 03:12:40.804]  And yes, he did speak about a haven in the United States for young, misgendered people.
[03:12:40.804 --> 03:12:41.624]  You understand?
[03:12:41.624 --> 03:12:43.665]  They want your kids.
[03:12:43.665 --> 03:12:45.485]  They're openly promoting this.
[03:12:46.400 --> 03:12:48.942]  The WHO's Global Health for Peace Initiative.
[03:12:48.942 --> 03:12:52.545]  You see it's Health for Peace and Peace for Health.
[03:12:52.545 --> 03:12:56.969]  And their logo, okay, is this thing.
[03:12:56.969 --> 03:12:58.710]  And they're incorporating the climate into it.
[03:12:58.710 --> 03:13:00.712]  That's why it's all the same agenda.
[03:13:00.712 --> 03:13:02.113]  It's all under global governance.
[03:13:02.113 --> 03:13:05.455]  We're going to get to the virtual part of that in a moment.
[03:13:05.455 --> 03:13:14.743]  So, you have the mRNA agenda getting you ready and really beginning to change the genomic
[03:13:16.002 --> 03:13:17.283]  The genomics of the entire planet.
[03:13:17.283 --> 03:13:28.687]  You know, I have Dennis Bushnell, the chief scientist at NASA currently, been there since the Apollo days, total defense department guy, saying that evolution is over.
[03:13:28.687 --> 03:13:32.608]  We're in charge of the evolution of everything.
[03:13:32.608 --> 03:13:33.069]  Everything.
[03:13:33.069 --> 03:13:36.170]  This guy has a crazy war document we're going to be going over as well.
[03:13:36.170 --> 03:13:39.111]  I constantly go to it because it needs to be gone over.
[03:13:39.111 --> 03:13:39.831]  Okay?
[03:13:39.831 --> 03:13:41.572]  So they want to take care of the climate.
[03:13:42.737 --> 03:13:48.321]  The genomes of the entire species of not only humanity, but of the planet.
[03:13:48.321 --> 03:13:49.281]  And you can see it here.
[03:13:49.281 --> 03:13:53.584]  Oh, there's bikes and windmills and they got the nice little heart thing.
[03:13:53.584 --> 03:14:00.028]  Meanwhile, you know, I think I'm going to open with Musk on the other end of this, because talk about a Trojan horse.
[03:14:00.028 --> 03:14:05.252]  A guy like Musk actually prints up the hate and lie shots.
[03:14:05.252 --> 03:14:08.614]  OK, all of this is Defense Department driven at the very heart of it.
[03:14:09.230 --> 03:14:12.031]  And he's the guy that what?
[03:14:12.031 --> 03:14:15.133]  That helps distribute CRISPR tech.
[03:14:15.133 --> 03:14:17.013]  mRNA tech.
[03:14:17.013 --> 03:14:21.716]  Tesla's not just a car company as you're going to see when we get back from the break.
[03:14:21.716 --> 03:14:22.196]  Okay?
[03:14:22.196 --> 03:14:30.940]  I'm going to show you how Tesla is very involved in not only automating you out and getting you to accept human-like robots.
[03:14:30.940 --> 03:14:32.020]  Okay?
[03:14:32.020 --> 03:14:34.561]  But take a look.
[03:14:34.561 --> 03:14:37.362]  They printed up the hate and lies shots.
[03:14:37.362 --> 03:14:38.503]  How else did this guy
[03:14:39.622 --> 03:14:44.064]  Okay, get so much wealthier during COVID.
[03:14:44.064 --> 03:14:48.386]  You know, it was on paper, he just lost $135 billion!
[03:14:48.386 --> 03:15:00.972]  When you're backed by the Defense Department, and things like Tesla and SpaceX, you probably don't have to worry about it, especially because you're being erected as the current savior.
[03:15:00.972 --> 03:15:05.634]  Okay, so on the flip of this, I got a couple short clips of Musk,
[03:15:06.434 --> 03:15:10.276]  At the Optimist launch, we're going to talk about over-promising, etc.
[03:15:10.276 --> 03:15:19.001]  But I want to leave people with this before the commercial break, especially since we have Alex Jones doing this marathon broadcast tomorrow.
[03:15:19.001 --> 03:15:21.802]  Where are the Twitter files on Alex Jones?
[03:15:21.802 --> 03:15:25.144]  Where are the Twitter files on InfoWars and the people that have worked there?
[03:15:25.144 --> 03:15:27.846]  They were obviously suppressed at times.
[03:15:27.846 --> 03:15:30.067]  There was obviously a decision to
[03:15:30.856 --> 03:15:33.377]  To be made to de-platform Alex.
[03:15:33.377 --> 03:15:34.717]  Where's all that, Elon?
[03:15:34.717 --> 03:15:37.238]  Oh, we can't have that?
[03:15:37.238 --> 03:15:42.579]  There's so much more to these files, and I want a WikiLeaks-style dump.
[03:15:42.579 --> 03:15:44.119]  That's what we need.
[03:15:44.119 --> 03:15:53.041]  Alright, and I need you guys to go to InfoWarsTore.com, support the broadcast, and get ready for tomorrow morning's epic 8 a.m.
[03:15:53.041 --> 03:15:55.002]  to midnight marathon show.
[03:15:56.667 --> 03:16:00.010]  Everybody that's watching this needs to support Alex Jones.
[03:16:00.010 --> 03:16:02.833]  Needs to support InfoWars and Band.Video.
[03:16:02.833 --> 03:16:05.495]  You know, the Bible says, let another mouth praise you.
[03:16:05.495 --> 03:16:06.857]  I'm gonna do that right now.
[03:16:06.857 --> 03:16:10.760]  Alex Jones has helped so many people in this industry.
[03:16:10.760 --> 03:16:15.665]  You guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like Savannah Hernandez.
[03:16:15.965 --> 03:16:22.128]  How many people have just been put on a launch pad to outer space because of Alex Jones, including myself?
[03:16:22.128 --> 03:16:30.773]  I've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform, and I would probably not even be half of where I am right now if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[03:16:30.773 --> 03:16:36.276]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan and TimCast, the super TimCast IRL.
[03:16:36.276 --> 03:16:41.859]  Listen, what I'm saying is, do not take Alex Jones and Bandot video for granted.
[03:16:42.099 --> 03:16:44.602]  Because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[03:16:44.602 --> 03:16:47.286]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[03:16:47.286 --> 03:16:48.767]  So go check out the store.
[03:16:48.767 --> 03:16:49.949]  Go support their store.
[03:16:49.949 --> 03:16:51.451]  Go support InfoWars.
[03:16:51.451 --> 03:16:52.832]  Leave a donation right now.
[03:16:52.832 --> 03:16:54.314]  Don't wait until they're gone!
[03:16:56.969 --> 03:17:01.491]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line in 4 Wars MD.
[03:17:01.491 --> 03:17:13.938]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[03:17:13.938 --> 03:17:15.138]  These are high-end.
[03:17:15.138 --> 03:17:16.199]  These are the very best.
[03:17:16.519 --> 03:17:19.000]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:19.520]  Well, guess what?
[03:17:19.520 --> 03:17:25.303]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[03:17:25.303 --> 03:17:27.924]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[03:17:27.924 --> 03:17:34.806]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[03:17:34.806 --> 03:17:40.009]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:17:40.009 --> 03:17:40.989]  The highest quality.
[03:17:41.269 --> 03:17:50.083]  Directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%, in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[03:17:50.083 --> 03:17:52.066]  M4 Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com
[03:17:56.832 --> 03:17:58.674]  Infowars is winning.
[03:17:58.674 --> 03:18:00.715]  Infowars is reaching more people than ever.
[03:18:00.715 --> 03:18:03.498]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago.
[03:18:03.498 --> 03:18:06.240]  Mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[03:18:06.240 --> 03:18:08.342]  They told you we were going to be shut down.
[03:18:08.342 --> 03:18:10.403]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[03:18:10.403 --> 03:18:11.384]  None of that's true.
[03:18:11.384 --> 03:18:12.265]  It's all being appealed.
[03:18:12.745 --> 03:18:14.847]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[03:18:14.847 --> 03:18:21.713]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars, we've got years and years of appeals, and we will not be taken off the air.
[03:18:21.713 --> 03:18:25.156]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[03:18:25.156 --> 03:18:27.859]  Don't let the globalists psyop you and your family.
[03:18:27.859 --> 03:18:37.768]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get incredible products, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, that fund the InfoWars and empower your life, and let the globalists know their psyop has not worked.
[03:18:38.208 --> 03:18:39.569]  Thanks for keeping us on air.
[03:18:39.569 --> 03:18:43.871]  Take action at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[03:18:43.871 --> 03:18:48.074]  Because the only people who can take us off the air is you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:18:48.074 --> 03:18:50.155]  The majority of you have not been signed off.
[03:18:50.155 --> 03:18:51.456]  Well, some of you have.
[03:18:51.456 --> 03:18:53.217]  Do not let the gloveless brainwash you.
[03:18:53.217 --> 03:18:55.158]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com to keep us on the air.
[03:18:56.730 --> 03:19:02.892]  Everyone watching should realize that this is an information war and it takes money to fund an information war.
[03:19:02.892 --> 03:19:15.876]  And everyone should decide to take the fight to the next level and to take the fight to the very tip of the spear and ensure we stay in the field in this war against the new world order by visiting Infowarstore.com right now and taking action.
[03:19:15.876 --> 03:19:20.818]  I thank you for your vast support and I ask you now to count the cost and realize that only your commitment
[03:19:21.258 --> 03:19:22.901]  Steve, InfoWars on the air.
[03:19:22.901 --> 03:19:25.184]  We'll ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[03:19:25.184 --> 03:19:26.646]  They're coming for you and your family.
[03:19:26.646 --> 03:19:27.908]  They're coming for me.
[03:19:27.908 --> 03:19:29.150]  They're coming for the children.
[03:19:29.150 --> 03:19:31.714]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[03:19:31.714 --> 03:19:35.219]  These monsters are all over television, wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[03:19:35.219 --> 03:19:36.401]  They're already giving them to pregnant women.
[03:19:36.641 --> 03:19:38.722]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[03:19:38.722 --> 03:19:44.145]  80 plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two primesters after these poison shots.
[03:19:44.145 --> 03:19:48.068]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[03:19:48.068 --> 03:19:49.288]  Let's do it together.
[03:19:49.288 --> 03:19:51.590]  And the fight starts at InfoWars.com.
[03:19:51.590 --> 03:19:55.392]  And the fight continues with your financial support at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:19:55.392 --> 03:19:59.294]  Now take action now!
[03:19:59.294 --> 03:20:05.198]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:13.160 --> 03:20:14.041]  We are back.
[03:20:14.041 --> 03:20:15.382]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:15.382 --> 03:20:29.658]  I am Jason Vermas sitting in the fourth hour and before we go to this clip of Elon Musk introducing the Optimus Bot and really over promising and introducing a humanoid robot
[03:20:30.416 --> 03:20:53.115]  To get you accustomed to being automated out and interacting with AI and interacting, believe it or not, with the metaverse as well because these entities are going to start to become more and more lifelike and the programmable mind files, if you will, the software, are often going to be based on real people you knew.
[03:20:53.115 --> 03:20:54.737]  That's actually the plan.
[03:20:55.347 --> 03:20:59.789]  But before we go to that clip, I don't want to make this broadcast all about Elon Musk.
[03:20:59.789 --> 03:21:01.169]  You know, I've done that in the past.
[03:21:01.169 --> 03:21:02.750]  I've spent a whole hour on Musk.
[03:21:02.750 --> 03:21:04.610]  You can watch those.
[03:21:04.610 --> 03:21:09.712]  You can also read a piece that I did, Five Reasons Why Elon Musk Should Not Be Trusted.
[03:21:09.712 --> 03:21:12.653]  It's over at thercreader.com.
[03:21:12.653 --> 03:21:16.814]  That's a local publication here that actually goes to print in this day and age of 2023.
[03:21:16.814 --> 03:21:16.874]  And...
[03:21:18.995 --> 03:21:42.149]  At the top of Band.Video, where I have a channel, Reality Rants with Jason Burmess, I just did a spectacular, just awesome roundtable with Derek Brose of The Conscious Resistance, James Corbett of The Corbett Report, Whitney Webb, who just put out One Nation under blackmail, and of course, Ryan Christian, the last American vagabond.
[03:21:42.149 --> 03:21:43.290]  So we went over a lot.
[03:21:43.950 --> 03:21:48.034]  We didn't play a lot of clips, but I definitely went over a lot of documentation.
[03:21:48.034 --> 03:21:53.138]  I almost feel like I talked too much, but there's so many things to talk about with Musk.
[03:21:53.138 --> 03:22:05.988]  And in that vein, before we get going, I want everybody to understand, you're being psychologically manipulated, okay, in fifth generation warfare.
[03:22:05.988 --> 03:22:12.954]  They've got the hip billionaire up there, the Tony Stark-like figure in his cool leather jacket,
[03:22:13.638 --> 03:22:20.966]  With a robot, again that's not even a robot, that's a display piece, later on they show you what they got and it does like this thing, we're not even going to get into that.
[03:22:20.966 --> 03:22:27.353]  Again, over promising, under delivering, and then you hear what he says, okay?
[03:22:27.353 --> 03:22:33.560]  After it gets wheeled away and we're going to do a little jump, it's not the cleanest video that I've ever had here, but again,
[03:22:34.443 --> 03:22:51.647]  You're given this savior type person and he's gonna promise you the world just like I played clips of Walter Cronkite back in the day showing you all these devices and saying, you know, you're gonna have a 30-hour work week, there's gonna be month-long vacations, all this automation, everything's gonna be great.
[03:22:51.647 --> 03:22:52.567]  What happened?
[03:22:52.567 --> 03:23:00.389]  Well, instead of one person going from their 40 or 40 plus hour work week and being able to have like a family of
[03:23:01.036 --> 03:23:02.977]  Really, four or five people easy.
[03:23:02.977 --> 03:23:08.579]  You know, might be stressing it with three to five kids, but yeah, that five mark, you could probably make it.
[03:23:08.579 --> 03:23:12.560]  Have a house, have a couple cars on top of it, no problem.
[03:23:12.560 --> 03:23:23.644]  To both people working 40 plus hours, sometimes having part-time jobs on top of that, and barely able to afford two children renting, not owning anything.
[03:23:23.644 --> 03:23:29.146]  That's how technology improved our standard of living in this country, believe it or not.
[03:23:29.895 --> 03:23:37.117]  Okay, so be very wary of Musk when he makes these open and very empty promises, in my opinion.
[03:23:37.117 --> 03:23:38.277]  So here we go, let's start it off.
[03:23:38.277 --> 03:23:46.359]  So he's telling you here, we're making a robot that's going to be in the millions of units and he's going to promise it to you for under the price of a car.
[03:23:46.359 --> 03:23:46.820]  That part's true.
[03:23:56.817 --> 03:24:03.159]  And it is expected to cost much less than a car.
[03:24:03.159 --> 03:24:08.221]  I would say probably less than $20,000 would be my guess.
[03:24:08.221 --> 03:24:11.062]  And let me explain why that is important.
[03:24:11.062 --> 03:24:14.383]  And by the way, this is where it kind of like gets wheeled past them.
[03:24:14.383 --> 03:24:16.164]  They're coming in hot with this thing.
[03:24:16.164 --> 03:24:18.284]  I want to get to this part of the clip right here.
[03:24:18.284 --> 03:24:21.365]  Because this is where it takes place.
[03:24:21.365 --> 03:24:22.926]  This is where you're promised everything.
[03:24:23.712 --> 03:24:24.553]  All right?
[03:24:24.553 --> 03:24:30.757]  Oh, just like the brain chip that he's pushing, the Neuralink is going to solve all these problems.
[03:24:30.757 --> 03:24:35.661]  This automation is going to change the entire economy.
[03:24:35.661 --> 03:24:48.711]  And if it's used in a benign sense, as we know everything is, especially technology, oh yes, it's been used so well to empower humanity and not enslave it in large factions.
[03:24:48.711 --> 03:24:50.112]  I'm sure that's exactly what's going to happen.
[03:24:50.112 --> 03:24:51.373]  So just hear what he has to say here.
[03:24:51.946 --> 03:24:57.871]  A lot of work to be done to refine Optimus and improve it.
[03:24:57.871 --> 03:25:01.374]  Obviously, this is just Optimus version 1.
[03:25:01.374 --> 03:25:14.125]  And that's really why we're holding this event, which is to convince some of the most talented people in the world, like you guys, to join Tesla and help make it a reality.
[03:25:14.125 --> 03:25:19.450]  And bring it to fruition at scale, such that it can help millions of people.
[03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:25.331]  And the potential, like I said, really boggles the mind.
[03:25:25.331 --> 03:25:28.412]  Because you have to say, what is an economy?
[03:25:28.412 --> 03:25:35.514]  An economy is sort of productive entities times their productivity.
[03:25:35.514 --> 03:25:39.175]  Capital times productivity per capita.
[03:25:39.175 --> 03:25:45.636]  At the point at which there is not a limitation on capital, it's not clear what an economy even means at that point.
[03:25:45.636 --> 03:25:47.417]  An economy becomes quasi-infinite.
[03:25:48.371 --> 03:25:53.872]  So, what he's really talking about here, when he talks about a quasi-infinite economy.
[03:25:53.872 --> 03:26:09.116]  Notice, he never talked about it as a vehicle or an engine for an individual to have a higher standard of living or socially or economically climb, right?
[03:26:09.116 --> 03:26:11.177]  Which is what you want in a good economy.
[03:26:11.177 --> 03:26:15.718]  You want individuals to have property ownership and rights
[03:26:16.643 --> 03:26:18.648]  Okay, and good working conditions, all those.
[03:26:18.648 --> 03:26:20.193]  That's not even in the discussion.
[03:26:21.167 --> 03:26:35.135]  But, on the other end of that, when you hear the Davos crowd talk about the new economies, they're not only pushing CBDCs, which we're going to talk about, okay, and really, they already have blockchain people out there.
[03:26:35.135 --> 03:26:37.377]  That's already a real thing.
[03:26:37.377 --> 03:26:38.878]  Davos has a whole thing on it.
[03:26:38.878 --> 03:26:46.122]  Already running refugee camps on the blockchain via this type of digital cryptocurrency.
[03:26:46.122 --> 03:26:47.923]  Remember, SDRs, IMF,
[03:26:49.088 --> 03:26:57.512]  International Monetary Fund, well over a decade ago, started distributing money through special drawing rights or zeros and ones on a computer.
[03:26:57.512 --> 03:27:01.053]  Now that's not blockchain technology, but it shows you where it's moving.
[03:27:01.053 --> 03:27:03.795]  And then, the Davos crowd is going to try to sell you on what?
[03:27:03.795 --> 03:27:05.875]  Stakeholder capitalism.
[03:27:05.875 --> 03:27:06.996]  Oh!
[03:27:06.996 --> 03:27:09.237]  Stakeholder capitalism is so benevolent.
[03:27:09.887 --> 03:27:11.889]  That's the reality of this thing.
[03:27:11.889 --> 03:27:15.293]  And they're going to say it's, what, how well you behave?
[03:27:15.293 --> 03:27:17.235]  And then it gets into your carbon credit system.
[03:27:17.235 --> 03:27:19.338]  And by the way, you got an Apple device?
[03:27:19.338 --> 03:27:19.958]  Look it up.
[03:27:19.958 --> 03:27:22.721]  Apple's got a social credit score on you already.
[03:27:22.721 --> 03:27:27.367]  And now here's the big push, the big promise from Elon Muskernuts.
[03:27:31.514 --> 03:27:42.636]  What, you know, taken to fruition in the hopefully benign scenario, this means a future of abundance.
[03:27:42.636 --> 03:27:47.037]  A future where there is no poverty.
[03:27:47.037 --> 03:27:50.878]  Where people, you can have whatever you want.
[03:27:50.878 --> 03:27:53.698]  You can have whatever you want.
[03:27:53.698 --> 03:27:57.119]  You can have whatever you want.
[03:27:57.119 --> 03:27:58.699]  No more poverty.
[03:27:59.531 --> 03:28:02.353]  Again, he even kind of shrugs into the benign sense.
[03:28:02.353 --> 03:28:08.176]  When has any of this stuff ever been used in the benign sense?
[03:28:08.176 --> 03:28:14.680]  Look, mRNA technology, in some cases, could be empowering humanity.
[03:28:14.680 --> 03:28:16.821]  What did the establishment use it for?
[03:28:16.821 --> 03:28:26.487]  Well, on the other side of this, I'm going to show you the Moderna CEO bragging about how their new mRNA shot is straight to the heart!
[03:28:27.293 --> 03:28:29.393]  Or after you have a stroke or a heart attack.
[03:28:29.393 --> 03:28:38.475]  And by the way, the only way we're able to produce this are from the profits from our only product, the Hate and Lies COVID-19 84 Shot.
[03:28:38.475 --> 03:28:40.595]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:40.595 --> 03:28:43.436]  Marathon show starts tomorrow, 8 a.m.
[03:28:43.436 --> 03:28:43.856]  Central.
[03:28:43.856 --> 03:28:44.596]  Hey, catch me.
[03:28:44.596 --> 03:28:45.756]  I'm live at 7 a.m.
[03:28:45.756 --> 03:28:47.697]  Central, an hour before.
[03:28:47.697 --> 03:28:50.257]  Then you can go hardcore into the night.
[03:28:50.257 --> 03:28:55.778]  Infowarsstore.com is where you can financially support this broadcast and this outfit.
[03:28:57.093 --> 03:29:04.297]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the rave reviews.
[03:29:04.297 --> 03:29:15.303]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States, and it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[03:29:15.303 --> 03:29:23.887]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements, and in some cases, even better.
[03:29:23.887 --> 03:29:24.448]  Introducing
[03:29:25.288 --> 03:29:29.871]  InfoWarsMD at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:29:29.871 --> 03:29:35.134]  InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com has 10 new products.
[03:29:35.134 --> 03:29:43.339]  Turmeric 95, Libido RX, Better Mood, Nitric Boost, Mushroom Max, Anitropic, Angel's Vitality Collagen,
[03:29:43.739 --> 03:29:49.863]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirists and minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[03:30:05.974 --> 03:30:09.496]  Rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[03:30:09.496 --> 03:30:13.558]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[03:30:13.558 --> 03:30:15.819]  And it's the same psy-op today.
[03:30:15.819 --> 03:30:20.141]  InfoWars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[03:30:20.141 --> 03:30:22.682]  And because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[03:30:23.382 --> 03:30:32.212]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[03:30:32.212 --> 03:30:37.899]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down InfoWars, and that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[03:30:38.399 --> 03:30:40.340]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[03:30:40.340 --> 03:30:47.604]  If you decide to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[03:30:47.604 --> 03:30:49.025]  It is all in your hands.
[03:30:49.025 --> 03:30:50.366]  So thanks for your support.
[03:30:50.366 --> 03:30:51.567]  Stand up against the globalists.
[03:30:51.567 --> 03:30:54.849]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now and keep us on air.
[03:30:54.849 --> 03:30:55.329]  It's up to you.
[03:30:57.935 --> 03:31:01.057]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[03:31:01.057 --> 03:31:03.379]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:31:03.379 --> 03:31:07.322]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:31:07.322 --> 03:31:16.249]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[03:31:16.249 --> 03:31:23.134]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week.
[03:31:23.134 --> 03:31:24.035]  It's really just incredible.
[03:31:25.043 --> 03:31:28.667]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:31:28.667 --> 03:31:34.493]  I only encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[03:31:34.493 --> 03:31:35.434]  I know you spread the word.
[03:31:35.434 --> 03:31:36.956]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful.
[03:31:36.956 --> 03:31:37.517]  Keep doing it.
[03:31:37.517 --> 03:31:44.584]  But most viewers and listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[03:31:44.584 --> 03:31:45.766]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[03:31:46.446 --> 03:31:50.748]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:31:50.748 --> 03:31:55.691]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsaw.com, our funding problems will be over.
[03:31:55.691 --> 03:31:56.672]  Please take action now.
[03:31:56.672 --> 03:32:00.774]  The second American revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[03:32:01.434 --> 03:32:06.638]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[03:32:06.638 --> 03:32:11.481]  And Infowars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[03:32:11.481 --> 03:32:15.825]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[03:32:16.425 --> 03:32:25.951]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you made to freedom.
[03:32:25.951 --> 03:32:38.940]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coin series, Teddy Roosevelt, Man of the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[03:32:38.940 --> 03:32:42.022]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt,
[03:32:43.583 --> 03:32:47.426]  That's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[03:32:47.426 --> 03:32:53.730]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at $17.76 on what coins remain.
[03:32:53.730 --> 03:32:59.154]  Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[03:32:59.154 --> 03:33:05.058]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:12.495 --> 03:33:13.115]  We are back.
[03:33:13.115 --> 03:33:14.216]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.216 --> 03:33:16.056]  I am Jason Burmas sitting in.
[03:33:16.056 --> 03:33:25.399]  And one of the biggest reasons that I am focused on transhumanism, that I am focused on the Internet of Bodies and not so much the Internet of Things.
[03:33:25.399 --> 03:33:27.880]  The Internet of Things is over.
[03:33:27.880 --> 03:33:28.760]  It's in place.
[03:33:28.760 --> 03:33:35.282]  It's something I was talking about a decade plus ago as they were refining it and have now refined it.
[03:33:35.282 --> 03:33:40.684]  What we need to be discussing is this next step of automation
[03:33:41.448 --> 03:33:47.250]  And biomedical tyranny on a level most people think is just science fiction.
[03:33:47.250 --> 03:33:52.533]  But let me tell you right now, news stories are telling you otherwise.
[03:33:52.533 --> 03:33:52.893]  All right?
[03:33:52.893 --> 03:33:55.014]  Anybody can look this stuff up right now.
[03:33:55.014 --> 03:33:56.794]  This is about three weeks old.
[03:33:56.794 --> 03:34:00.456]  You're having social robot market exploding.
[03:34:00.456 --> 03:34:01.817]  What does that mean?
[03:34:01.817 --> 03:34:02.177]  All right?
[03:34:02.177 --> 03:34:03.417]  And that's just 2023 to 2035.
[03:34:03.417 --> 03:34:06.058]  So they're telling you it's taking off now.
[03:34:06.058 --> 03:34:09.960]  Well, other than the AI and the bots,
[03:34:10.626 --> 03:34:12.788]  And spot the DARPA robot.
[03:34:12.788 --> 03:34:21.136]  And eventually, Optimus, if they have their way, they want that automated car in there.
[03:34:21.136 --> 03:34:21.937]  Vehicles.
[03:34:21.937 --> 03:34:22.677]  All right?
[03:34:22.677 --> 03:34:25.900]  So much automation and robotics.
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:27.742]  And what else are they bringing in?
[03:34:27.742 --> 03:34:29.564]  The genetic testing market.
[03:34:29.564 --> 03:34:29.924]  All right?
[03:34:29.924 --> 03:34:32.066]  That's going to surpass $28 billion.
[03:34:34.941 --> 03:34:36.844]  Within five years.
[03:34:36.844 --> 03:34:40.289]  These are the new markets because your biology is the market.
[03:34:40.289 --> 03:34:42.812]  That's how stakeholder capitalism works.
[03:34:42.812 --> 03:34:44.775]  That's how the Internet of Bodies works.
[03:34:44.775 --> 03:34:48.100]  That's how the Fourth Industrial Revolution works.
[03:34:48.100 --> 03:34:50.784]  And I honestly thought they would try to institute
[03:34:52.504 --> 03:35:06.612]  Global governance is more of a solidified unit, but they've instituted their New World Order on so many levels, and now in westernized nations like Canada and Australia, in a manner most people could never believe.
[03:35:06.612 --> 03:35:09.313]  And don't worry, they're trying to bring it here.
[03:35:09.313 --> 03:35:20.059]  Aside from their absurd and ridiculous blockchain, okay, looking into CBDCs, which is dangerous enough,
[03:35:21.087 --> 03:35:25.548]  This right here tells you they're looking to build an economy out of your biology.
[03:35:25.548 --> 03:35:41.693]  We need to develop a genetic engineering technology and technique to be able to write circuitry for cells and predictably program biology in the same way in which we write software and program computers and again and again and again in their own papers.
[03:35:41.693 --> 03:35:45.354]  That's how they describe it.
[03:35:45.354 --> 03:35:45.594]  Okay?
[03:35:46.334 --> 03:35:51.275]  So what I want to do now is I want to play the Moderna CEO.
[03:35:51.275 --> 03:35:55.376]  Again, this is a company that had nothing going for it.
[03:35:55.376 --> 03:35:57.956]  No, no, no products.
[03:35:57.956 --> 03:36:00.457]  Partners with the Defense Department in 2013.
[03:36:00.457 --> 03:36:03.237]  I'm going to show you the documentation.
[03:36:03.237 --> 03:36:07.018]  And lo and behold, COVID-19-84 saves them.
[03:36:07.018 --> 03:36:13.680]  And they laugh about it here as they tell you about the new injection that's going to help with heart attacks.
[03:36:13.680 --> 03:36:15.380]  You can't make this up.
[03:36:17.677 --> 03:36:22.341]  The other side of this is that right now, Moderna, though it has this pipeline, has one commercial product.
[03:36:41.474 --> 03:36:42.934]  And that's the spike fax.
[03:36:42.934 --> 03:36:45.595]  That's the actual COVID vaccination.
[03:36:45.595 --> 03:36:53.936]  So that's the irony of COVID, is it really has, in some ways, allowed you to go and develop these other areas because of the revenues that came through the door.
[03:36:53.936 --> 03:36:55.576]  You're 100% right.
[03:36:55.576 --> 03:36:57.057]  You're 100% right.
[03:36:57.057 --> 03:37:00.777]  Now imagine a world that you live in, OK?
[03:37:00.777 --> 03:37:04.558]  Just imagine it, you know, that it's not fiction.
[03:37:04.558 --> 03:37:06.918]  But you've got to do some imagining because it's tough.
[03:37:06.918 --> 03:37:08.799]  It's tough to understand this.
[03:37:08.799 --> 03:37:09.519]  All right.
[03:37:09.519 --> 03:37:10.659]  Where Elon Musk,
[03:37:11.610 --> 03:37:17.092]  prints up a bunch of mRNA shots through CureVac, okay?
[03:37:17.092 --> 03:37:38.879]  Alright, through CureVac and Tesla, does that, based on a spike protein, okay, from a virus, that you just can't believe it, but the virus itself, I'm sorry, that's not what I was looking for, I believe it's right here, yes, they find that Moderna has a patent in 2016, after they partnered with the Defense Department,
[03:37:39.818 --> 03:37:47.740]  That has a chunk of DNA, I believe it is a 12-sequence DNA nucleotide, identical to the virus.
[03:37:47.740 --> 03:37:52.741]  And the Defense Department has no reason to tell you the truth, ever.
[03:37:52.741 --> 03:37:53.681]  Okay?
[03:37:53.681 --> 03:37:55.342]  Ever, ever, ever.
[03:37:55.342 --> 03:38:09.265]  And they start the partnership, okay, for mRNA, what, to go after pandemics and engineered biological weapons, even in the case where the infectious agent or pathogen is unknown.
[03:38:09.901 --> 03:38:11.682]  This is their own press release.
[03:38:11.682 --> 03:38:13.343]  It's on their own website.
[03:38:13.343 --> 03:38:14.824]  Take a look, everybody.
[03:38:14.824 --> 03:38:27.390]  And then on top of that, so they partner in 2013, two and a half years later, they patent a cancer drug, mRNA drug, because everybody knows at this point, okay, that these are drugs.
[03:38:27.390 --> 03:38:34.854]  They specifically tell you that they are not vaccines in any way, shape, or form at all, okay, at all.
[03:38:34.854 --> 03:38:35.875]  They're not the same thing.
[03:38:36.644 --> 03:38:40.727]  The idea of using mRNA drugs is quite different.
[03:38:40.727 --> 03:38:45.972]  These are synthetic compounds that can be designed and manufactured in just about three weeks.
[03:38:45.972 --> 03:38:47.893]  Based on what?
[03:38:47.893 --> 03:38:51.496]  The genetic coding that they're doing with CRISPR-Tek.
[03:38:51.496 --> 03:39:05.007]  And then they partner, okay, their strategic collaborators, AstraZeneca, Merck, Virtex, BARDA, DARPA, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Karolinska Institute, and Institut Pasteur.
[03:39:07.114 --> 03:39:22.101]  Amazingly, AMAZINGLY, you had a man who won the Nobel Prize, okay, Luc Monnier, who's now passed away, saying, hey, there's actually HIV components in the virus.
[03:39:22.101 --> 03:39:23.702]  Now, you've got what?
[03:39:23.702 --> 03:39:35.247]  That weird sequence, that weird sequence, that comes from a patent of Moderna after they get with the Defense Department, and it also has HIV in it.
[03:39:36.494 --> 03:39:38.436]  Nothing suspicious there.
[03:39:38.436 --> 03:39:39.797]  Nothing suspicious there.
[03:39:39.797 --> 03:39:41.858]  And then they try to sell you on the leak theory.
[03:39:41.858 --> 03:39:43.900]  On top of that, you think to yourself, well, wait a minute.
[03:39:43.900 --> 03:39:51.125]  If you're going to get injected with anything that resembles this virus, maybe you should be worried about HIV and autoimmune disorders.
[03:39:51.125 --> 03:39:54.248]  We talk a lot about the heart stuff, right?
[03:39:54.248 --> 03:39:56.930]  And that's coming out in public, and it's hilarious to the Moderna guy.
[03:39:56.930 --> 03:39:58.711]  They now have a heart medication.
[03:39:58.711 --> 03:39:59.792]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[03:39:59.792 --> 03:40:02.954]  That's only been made possible by this whole thing.
[03:40:02.954 --> 03:40:04.015]  Right?
[03:40:04.015 --> 03:40:05.777]  But you have Forbes articles.
[03:40:05.777 --> 03:40:06.097]  Forbes.
[03:40:07.328 --> 03:40:15.054]  In October 2020, warning people of their risk of HIV infection from some of these.
[03:40:15.054 --> 03:40:15.475]  Alright?
[03:40:15.475 --> 03:40:16.215]  And then what happened?
[03:40:16.215 --> 03:40:18.797]  That was in the Lancet!
[03:40:18.797 --> 03:40:24.622]  And then they said some of them induced false positive HIV test results.
[03:40:24.622 --> 03:40:33.229]  So, am I allowed to ask why a biologically engineered
[03:40:34.338 --> 03:40:45.286]  A virus, period, that has connections to the Defense Department and HIV, those same people get to inject you later?
[03:40:45.286 --> 03:40:48.748]  Through the Emergency Use Authorization Act and nobody can be sued?
[03:40:48.748 --> 03:40:51.470]  Well, that sounds reasonable, right?
[03:40:52.344 --> 03:40:54.406]  So, you may mistake these two guys.
[03:40:54.406 --> 03:40:56.228]  So that's the Moderna guy.
[03:40:56.228 --> 03:40:57.429]  Okay, that's the Moderna guy.
[03:40:57.429 --> 03:41:03.354]  And by the way, I have him on camera being questioned about that association.
[03:41:03.354 --> 03:41:04.656]  I could play that as well.
[03:41:04.656 --> 03:41:07.198]  About that 12-sequence DNA nucleotide.
[03:41:07.198 --> 03:41:09.000]  He's like, oh, our experts are looking into it.
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:09.720]  It could have been a leak.
[03:41:10.985 --> 03:41:12.305]  And again, no leak.
[03:41:12.305 --> 03:41:13.706]  I don't believe leak theory at all.
[03:41:13.706 --> 03:41:18.587]  I'm talking about engineered bioweapon that was what seeded on humanity.
[03:41:18.587 --> 03:41:19.227]  That's what happened.
[03:41:19.227 --> 03:41:22.108]  And then a ton of other things facilitate this.
[03:41:22.108 --> 03:41:24.929]  From false tests to telling you what?
[03:41:24.929 --> 03:41:27.629]  That the flu disappeared for the first time in humanity.
[03:41:27.629 --> 03:41:31.150]  I mean, you think that Jason, that couldn't have happened?
[03:41:31.150 --> 03:41:33.751]  Guys, WHO said it.
[03:41:33.751 --> 03:41:34.951]  NPR put out a thing.
[03:41:34.951 --> 03:41:37.172]  And when I say gone, I mean gone.
[03:41:38.102 --> 03:41:39.363]  Think about this number.
[03:41:39.363 --> 03:41:43.785]  2019-2020 flu season, 400,000 people were hospitalized.
[03:41:43.785 --> 03:41:44.246]  Alright?
[03:41:44.246 --> 03:41:52.230]  As of February, including 22,000 deaths, by the way, 165 flu-related hospitalizations from October to February.
[03:41:52.230 --> 03:41:54.011]  For four months.
[03:41:54.011 --> 03:41:58.274]  Not 165,000, which would be suspect enough, because it would be more than half disappeared.
[03:41:58.274 --> 03:41:59.114]  165.
[03:41:59.114 --> 03:42:02.376]  And by the way, 400,000, that's a round number.
[03:42:02.376 --> 03:42:05.398]  It's a round number.
[03:42:05.398 --> 03:42:06.578]  Alright.
[03:42:06.578 --> 03:42:07.399]  When we come back,
[03:42:08.024 --> 03:42:16.721]  We're going to play Albert Borrella talking about, with the Davos crowd, this new biomedical tyranny.
[03:42:16.721 --> 03:42:19.566]  You will comply with the medicine we give you.
[03:42:19.566 --> 03:42:20.448]  I'm going to be showing you
[03:42:21.232 --> 03:42:26.954]  Other aspects of that biomedical tyranny via DARPA, the Defense Department.
[03:42:26.954 --> 03:42:28.095]  This is the real deal.
[03:42:28.095 --> 03:42:34.357]  We back everything we say up here with documentation, facts and people quoting it.
[03:42:34.357 --> 03:42:38.259]  I'm so glad Alex is playing that Netanyahu clip because Israel's on board.
[03:42:38.639 --> 03:42:40.041]  The Saudis are on board.
[03:42:40.041 --> 03:42:41.382]  The United States are on board.
[03:42:41.382 --> 03:42:43.284]  The Davos crowd is on board.
[03:42:43.284 --> 03:42:47.048]  And right now, they are currently trying to enslave humanity.
[03:42:47.048 --> 03:42:47.989]  Fight back.
[03:42:47.989 --> 03:42:51.092]  Join Alex Jones bright and early tomorrow, 8 a.m.
[03:42:51.092 --> 03:42:54.296]  Central, for the mega broadcast going until midnight.
[03:42:54.296 --> 03:42:55.517]  We'll be back after this.
[03:42:55.517 --> 03:42:56.398]  It's InfoWars.com.
[03:42:57.290 --> 03:43:03.311]  Early 2022, InfoWars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[03:43:03.311 --> 03:43:11.693]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalists and having incredibly successful results.
[03:43:11.693 --> 03:43:13.933]  So I thank you for your passionate support.
[03:43:13.933 --> 03:43:17.434]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[03:43:17.434 --> 03:43:22.835]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt
[03:43:23.348 --> 03:43:28.232]  Man in the Arena coin exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[03:43:28.232 --> 03:43:34.017]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[03:43:34.017 --> 03:43:37.620]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[03:43:37.620 --> 03:43:42.825]  The coin is a collector's item memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[03:43:43.365 --> 03:43:49.052]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast, and you can get $30 off on the coin with promo code 1776 at 1776coin.com.
[03:43:49.052 --> 03:43:50.153]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[03:43:57.119 --> 03:43:59.340]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[03:43:59.340 --> 03:44:03.363]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the health care system.
[03:44:03.363 --> 03:44:04.684]  There's a solution.
[03:44:04.684 --> 03:44:05.664]  The Wellness Company.
[03:44:05.664 --> 03:44:08.966]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[03:44:08.966 --> 03:44:16.171]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[03:44:16.431 --> 03:44:42.513]  Prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies, in-home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care, but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new
[03:44:43.507 --> 03:44:43.748]  Thank you.
[03:45:06.696 --> 03:45:09.058]  What if you had the plans to the Death Star?
[03:45:09.058 --> 03:45:12.340]  What if you knew the globalist operations that could stop it?
[03:45:12.340 --> 03:45:13.761]  Well, we've done the research.
[03:45:13.761 --> 03:45:16.502]  We've got the number one best-selling book in the country.
[03:45:16.502 --> 03:45:18.584]  Not just in politics, but period.
[03:45:18.584 --> 03:45:20.305]  It's the Great Reset and the War for the World.
[03:45:20.305 --> 03:45:22.506]  And you get a signed copy of this, the last 1,400.
[03:45:22.506 --> 03:45:24.948]  Keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:45:24.948 --> 03:45:25.888]  Please take action.
[03:45:25.888 --> 03:45:28.010]  I want to thank you all for your past support.
[03:45:28.010 --> 03:45:33.353]  Get one of these signed copies and know you kept InfoWars on the air at the most critical juncture in our history.
[03:45:33.693 --> 03:45:34.775]  Again, 2023 is here.
[03:45:34.775 --> 03:45:37.660]  The last run of signed copies of the book.
[03:45:37.660 --> 03:45:39.623]  We also have unsigned copies as well.
[03:45:39.623 --> 03:45:42.026]  The signed copies are limited and are about to run out.
[03:45:42.026 --> 03:45:43.709]  Thank you for your support.
[03:45:43.709 --> 03:45:46.694]  Again, get yours at mfulworthstore.com.
[03:45:57.475 --> 03:46:01.397]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[03:46:01.397 --> 03:46:10.282]  I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWareStore.com and check it out for yourself because it is a very strong, high quality formula.
[03:46:10.282 --> 03:46:14.885]  Gallon out sleep support, liquid, it's very fast acting, take it under the tongue.
[03:46:15.345 --> 03:46:23.632]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passionflower, valerian root extract, lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[03:46:23.632 --> 03:46:29.998]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[03:46:29.998 --> 03:46:34.182]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[03:46:34.662 --> 03:46:37.143]  And we've got some other great sleep eggs as well, and they're excellent.
[03:46:37.143 --> 03:46:38.564]  They're all different formulas.
[03:46:38.564 --> 03:46:42.646]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[03:46:42.646 --> 03:46:43.886]  So, Down and Out.
[03:46:43.886 --> 03:46:45.127]  Sold out for more than five months.
[03:46:45.127 --> 03:46:47.948]  It's now back available at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:46:47.948 --> 03:46:55.732]  So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system, and support the InfoWare with Down and Out Sleep Support at InfoWareStore.
[03:46:59.187 --> 03:47:03.811]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:03.811 --> 03:47:05.092]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:47:12.250 --> 03:47:16.133]  Final segment of the Alex Jones Show, I am Jason Bermas.
[03:47:16.133 --> 03:47:41.813]  In the fourth hour, I want everybody to check this clip out because Ezra Levant of Rebel News, who I think is doing some excellent work, I'm so glad that him and his crew are over at Davos, referenced this clip and we're actually going to take it even further than what the Pfizer CEO has to say here with compliance in this new Internet of Bodies world, this new transhumanist medical
[03:47:42.543 --> 03:47:43.684]  Fascist.
[03:47:43.684 --> 03:47:44.645]  Techno.
[03:47:44.645 --> 03:47:45.926]  Nightmare.
[03:47:45.926 --> 03:47:51.650]  It is basically a biological chip, but it is in the tablet.
[03:47:51.650 --> 03:47:57.795]  And once you take the tablet and it dissolves into your stomach, it sends a signal that you took the tablet.
[03:47:57.795 --> 03:48:00.137]  So imagine the applications of that.
[03:48:00.137 --> 03:48:01.398]  Compliance.
[03:48:01.398 --> 03:48:06.062]  The insurance companies to know that the medicines that patients should take, they do.
[03:48:06.062 --> 03:48:07.323]  They take them.
[03:48:07.323 --> 03:48:11.066]  It is fascinating what happens in this field.
[03:48:11.713 --> 03:48:13.314]  Yeah, I'll bet you it's fascinating.
[03:48:13.314 --> 03:48:16.536]  The medicines they should take, they do.
[03:48:16.536 --> 03:48:22.079]  Compliance, compliance, that's what it's really about.
[03:48:22.079 --> 03:48:25.921]  And, you know, we talk about things they might want to inject in you in the future.
[03:48:25.921 --> 03:48:39.988]  I just want to show you some of the public technology because I'm going to be showing you a RAND brain-computer interface document that's going to take the technology of injecting you with materials that can be what?
[03:48:41.241 --> 03:48:48.027]  Manipulated through radio waves and magnetic waves as well as something like this.
[03:48:48.027 --> 03:48:51.491]  This is the public stuff they're showing you right here.
[03:48:51.491 --> 03:48:52.952]  This is the magnetic slime.
[03:48:52.952 --> 03:48:54.994]  They're already manipulating it.
[03:48:54.994 --> 03:48:57.016]  They're showing you how they can bring it.
[03:48:58.010 --> 03:48:58.291]  I think?
[03:49:12.481 --> 03:49:14.022]  Let's take a look at this.
[03:49:14.022 --> 03:49:17.946]  Alright, this is a publicly available document, I think, 2018 or 2019.
[03:49:17.946 --> 03:49:20.588]  We just scroll down a little bit.
[03:49:20.588 --> 03:49:29.076]  Now, we've been talking a lot of DARPA, because they like to partner with Big Pharma, but right here, okay, I'm going to read it verbatim.
[03:49:29.076 --> 03:49:38.124]  Another DARPA program, the Next Generation Non-Surgical Neurotechnology Program, involves a non-invasive system
[03:49:38.595 --> 03:49:44.319]  A natural extension from research that aims to read brain signals and send or implant information in the brain to brain
[03:49:58.340 --> 03:50:02.661]  In the brain is brain-to-brain communication with funding from the ARL.
[03:50:02.661 --> 03:50:20.105]  Researchers at the University of Washington conducted a pilot study of non-invasive system that uses EEG to read basic brain signals, transmit them over the internet, and then transfer motor responses to a second user using transcranial magnetic stimulation.
[03:50:20.928 --> 03:50:26.091]  The signals represent very basic actions in the context of simple video game moves such as right or left.
[03:50:26.091 --> 03:50:42.020]  Nonetheless, especially given that these signals are transferred over the Internet, the potential to send even basic thoughts across the Internet inherently presents many opportunities and many risks concerning security and ethics.
[03:50:42.020 --> 03:50:43.381]  No kidding.
[03:50:43.381 --> 03:50:46.503]  They're doing it anyway.
[03:50:46.503 --> 03:50:48.384]  They're not worried about the ethics, I promise you.
[03:50:49.324 --> 03:50:54.428]  So let's see how far publicly DARPA already is.
[03:50:54.428 --> 03:51:02.555]  And what you're about to watch is really the gentleman that was kind of in charge of a lot of the aspects of Operation Warp Speed.
[03:51:02.555 --> 03:51:05.398]  The guy who was supposed to take pandemics off the table.
[03:51:06.261 --> 03:51:09.403]  Okay, and he is very happy about this technology.
[03:51:09.403 --> 03:51:11.364]  Hello, I'm Colonel Matt Hepburn.
[03:51:11.364 --> 03:51:16.486]  I'm a program manager in the Biological Technologies Office at DARPA.
[03:51:16.486 --> 03:51:31.494]  I am a active duty Army infectious diseases physician and have specialized in addressing biological threats that can either be engineered or naturally occurring, such as Ebola or pandemic influenza.
[03:51:31.494 --> 03:51:35.196]  Or exactly what we discussed with the partnership of what?
[03:51:36.204 --> 03:51:37.867]  Moderna and DARPA.
[03:51:37.867 --> 03:51:43.516]  DARPA, again, infectious diseases and biologically engineered organisms.
[03:51:43.516 --> 03:51:49.385]  Here is their biological chip solution to monitoring everything in your body.
[03:51:49.904 --> 03:52:01.697]  To be talking about one of the technologies that I actively manage, a company called Profusa, which is aiming at achieving tissue-level continuous health monitoring.
[03:52:01.697 --> 03:52:10.326]  Through the SBIR program, we funded them to solve an incredible technical challenge that no one else had been previously able to solve.
[03:52:11.207 --> 03:52:23.512]  The key innovation that was presented to us is they said, why can't we make a chemical substance that's really identical to what's underneath the skin, what we call the subcutaneous tissue.
[03:52:24.429 --> 03:52:28.972]  So that your body doesn't recognize it as a foreign body response.
[03:52:28.972 --> 03:52:32.034]  It just incorporates itself into the tissue.
[03:52:32.034 --> 03:52:44.963]  And we have a lot of examples now where a sensor put right underneath the skin can sense things like oxygen and other chemicals that are very important to our metabolism.
[03:52:44.963 --> 03:52:46.524]  I mean we're talking about the gamut.
[03:52:47.794 --> 03:52:53.440]  All right so it can biologically read these things out not for days or months but years.
[03:52:53.440 --> 03:52:58.605]  I'm going to fast forward because I only got a few minutes left and I want to play for you right now.
[03:52:59.662 --> 03:53:08.325]  Rand, the same people behind that document, talking about the Internet of Bodies openly, and what this kind of technology actually means.
[03:53:08.325 --> 03:53:15.088]  Especially if they incorporate it into the economy the way they want to do it, and get rid of cash transactions.
[03:53:15.088 --> 03:53:18.329]  That's the end of individual freedom.
[03:53:18.329 --> 03:53:24.351]  That's the end, really, of us as a species as they try to usher us into a virtual nightmare as well.
[03:53:25.643 --> 03:53:33.569]  In the 20th century, wireless technology integrated with the human body was nothing more than science fiction.
[03:53:33.569 --> 03:53:42.496]  But today, Wi-Fi connected devices, like heart rate monitors and sleep trackers, have become common parts of American life.
[03:53:42.496 --> 03:53:48.321]  How has bionic technology evolved so quickly from science fiction to reality?
[03:53:48.321 --> 03:53:52.624]  And what could this Internet of Bodies mean for our lives moving forward?
[03:53:53.224 --> 03:54:02.373]  Rand researchers are studying this phenomenon and what consumers and policymakers need to know as we veer into uncharted territory.
[03:54:02.373 --> 03:54:07.037]  The Internet of Bodies, or IOB, is actually an ecosystem.
[03:54:07.037 --> 03:54:11.561]  It's a bunch of devices that are connected to the Internet that contain software.
[03:54:11.561 --> 03:54:11.921]  I'm good.
[03:54:32.036 --> 03:54:43.229]  With the advent of the internet, it makes a lot of sense to connect your pacemaker to the internet so that your doctor can be automatically notified if something weird happens, if there's an anomaly.
[03:54:43.229 --> 03:54:49.816]  It's natural in a lot of ways to want to understand more about your body, how it functions, how well it's doing.
[03:54:49.816 --> 03:54:51.058]  We're gonna stop it there.
[03:54:51.058 --> 03:54:53.000]  But she actually does warn people.
[03:54:53.542 --> 03:54:58.326]  That there's really no laws on who collects the data or what they do with the data.
[03:54:58.326 --> 03:55:05.531]  You notice she talked about access to these devices, not only just reading them, but making them do things.
[03:55:05.531 --> 03:55:07.372]  Alright, this is another aspect of that.
[03:55:07.372 --> 03:55:12.796]  And eventually, you know, really, they want you in this virtual world.
[03:55:12.796 --> 03:55:19.581]  So transhumanism, they want to use all this biological technology and the nice things they're doing to everybody, to what?
[03:55:20.596 --> 03:55:27.097]  Use it so that they can live in these ooey gooey flesh bodies for the most part forever.
[03:55:27.097 --> 03:55:28.718]  The technological fountain of youth.
[03:55:28.718 --> 03:55:36.919]  While you believe, as you merge with machines and all these different devices, that you can somehow upload your consciousness to the cloud.
[03:55:36.919 --> 03:55:44.440]  That's what Rothblatt's selling you on, that's what Kurzweil, who by the way is the head of Calico, the immortality division at Google.
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:46.961]  Again, you can't make that up, absolutely, there.
[03:55:47.641 --> 03:55:52.142]  Here they're talking about going from theory to practice, just like Musk wants to bring people in.
[03:55:52.142 --> 03:55:54.063]  Metaverse governance.
[03:55:54.063 --> 03:55:56.584]  Generating economic and societal value.
[03:55:56.584 --> 03:55:59.144]  And if you look at this map, it's very hard to see here.
[03:55:59.144 --> 03:56:01.505]  Global governance is right behind me.
[03:56:01.505 --> 03:56:03.246]  Above my head now, but this one right here.
[03:56:03.246 --> 03:56:04.966]  Global governance, part of their agenda.
[03:56:04.966 --> 03:56:06.487]  This is all the same thing.
[03:56:06.487 --> 03:56:10.828]  Sustainability, eco-agenda, virtual agenda.
[03:56:10.828 --> 03:56:12.968]  You know, you talk about that NASA document.
[03:56:12.968 --> 03:56:14.709]  I'm just going to go to the one page, it's right here.
[03:56:15.878 --> 03:56:16.638]  This is in 2001.
[03:56:16.638 --> 03:56:19.559]  They said the bio-nano era starts for humankind in 2020.
[03:56:19.559 --> 03:56:23.180]  Injected billions of people with bio-nano tech.
[03:56:23.180 --> 03:56:24.280]  They did it.
[03:56:24.280 --> 03:56:24.860]  Alright?
[03:56:24.860 --> 03:56:27.780]  And then they want to bring you into that virtual world.
[03:56:27.780 --> 03:56:30.861]  These demons like Klaus Nutschwab and the gang.
[03:56:30.861 --> 03:56:38.183]  They want to create a system where you're a block chain person and they openly brag about it.
[03:56:38.183 --> 03:56:41.163]  They say they're going to help you at the refugee camp.
[03:56:41.163 --> 03:56:42.503]  Isn't that nice of them?
[03:56:42.503 --> 03:56:43.964]  Isn't that the best?
[03:56:43.964 --> 03:56:45.224]  The whole refugee camp.
[03:56:46.068 --> 03:56:48.109]  They run without physical money.
[03:56:48.109 --> 03:56:51.291]  You're in a tent, it takes your biometric information.
[03:56:51.291 --> 03:56:52.792]  Davos loves you guys.
[03:56:52.792 --> 03:56:54.532]  You'll be part of the World Food Program.
[03:56:54.532 --> 03:56:56.253]  They're going to save a bunch of money.
[03:56:56.253 --> 03:56:59.295]  They're going to get you work in the slave line.
[03:56:59.295 --> 03:57:00.996]  It's right here.
[03:57:00.996 --> 03:57:05.298]  This is the fourth industrial revolution that they have planned for you.
[03:57:05.298 --> 03:57:10.821]  Total, track, trace, database, not only on the outside, which they've achieved in large part.
[03:57:11.417 --> 03:57:19.906]  But on the inside as well, to push their predator class, anti-human, trans-human New World Order agenda.
[03:57:19.906 --> 03:57:22.189]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:26.814]  Now more than ever is the time to support InfoWars.com and Alex Jones.
[03:57:26.814 --> 03:57:32.060]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a multitude of great products and tools.
[03:57:32.720 --> 03:57:39.844]  Get the DVDs, get the books, share them with others, and make sure you're tuning in tomorrow bright and early at 8 a.m.
[03:57:39.844 --> 03:57:41.025]  for their mega broadcast.
[03:57:41.025 --> 03:57:44.847]  If you want to come over to Red Voice Media, I'm live at 7, one hour before.
[03:57:44.847 --> 03:57:45.468]  Thank you so much.
[03:57:47.515 --> 03:57:50.536]  InfoWars' secret weapon is finally here.
[03:57:50.536 --> 03:57:58.898]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[03:57:58.898 --> 03:58:08.441]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[03:58:08.441 --> 03:58:13.902]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[03:58:13.902 --> 03:58:16.603]  They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener,
[03:58:16.843 --> 03:58:19.285]  We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[03:58:19.285 --> 03:58:24.449]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[03:58:24.449 --> 03:58:26.831]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[03:58:26.831 --> 03:58:30.615]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[03:58:30.615 --> 03:58:33.257]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[03:58:33.257 --> 03:58:39.362]  These similar formulas or the same formulas sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[03:58:39.362 --> 03:58:43.746]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:43.746 --> 03:58:44.466]  A true 360 win.
[03:58:48.780 --> 03:58:54.182]  Cobra Commander here with an important message to humanity.
[03:58:54.182 --> 03:59:01.445]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[03:59:01.445 --> 03:59:05.006]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[03:59:05.006 --> 03:59:13.570]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the curve.
[03:59:14.370 --> 03:59:22.277]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at megacorporations.
[03:59:22.277 --> 03:59:32.705]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy, leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[03:59:32.705 --> 03:59:34.707]  You will then be my slaves.
[03:59:36.212 --> 03:59:40.174]  And then you'll get that special shot of venom from Cobra.
[03:59:40.174 --> 03:59:50.320]  It will remove your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[03:59:50.320 --> 03:59:54.242]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
