[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  Just on time deliveries, high tech A.I. run societies.
[00:07.000 --> 00:17.000]  They're not just perfect for surveillance and control and giant Enron style scams where they can manipulate your bills and triple and quadruple charge you.
[00:17.000 --> 00:23.000]  They're not just designed to shut down all the small competitors in every industry and consolidate control.
[00:23.000 --> 00:29.000]  They are designed to remove humans from the decision making process so that humans are obsolete
[00:29.000 --> 00:38.000]  and humans can be depopulated without it shutting down the sectors that the globalists still want for themselves.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  All U.S. domestic flights grounded after software glitch.
[00:43.000 --> 00:57.000]  So how does one software have a glitch, the system that's used for the air traffic systems to warn the pilots about dangerous conditions and other events?
[00:57.000 --> 01:08.000]  How could one piece of software go out and the entire aircraft system of commercial flights and it also screwed up private flights I've been reading.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  How could that be used to then ground everything?
[01:11.000 --> 01:23.000]  And it's similar to how they now have introduced legislation sponsored by the big airlines to get rid of two pilots even on 777s and larger aircraft.
[01:23.000 --> 01:32.000]  Because most of the flights are taking off and going to destinations and landing without human control.
[01:32.000 --> 01:43.000]  It's all on autopilot and statistics and research has been coming out for a decade that autopilot is causing pilots to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  And then glitches in autopilot have grounded large fleets of aircraft.
[01:48.000 --> 01:57.000]  Does they'll do things like flip an airplane upside down and nose dive it? This is all in the W.E.F. Host Industrial World playbook.
[01:57.000 --> 02:14.000]  Pay insufficient attention to the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to see powers of lie, transportation, hospital services.
[02:14.000 --> 02:30.000]  Our society has a hold. The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[02:30.000 --> 02:41.000]  Pete Booty Judge called out after FAA system failure grounds all flights. He has no idea what happened. But he's gay so that's all that matters.
[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  I think this gives us a really important data point and a really important moment to understand what we're going to need moving forward.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  But obviously our more immediate focus is technical understanding exactly how this happened.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  The system we live under is becoming more and more centralized every single day.
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  It's being done in farming, it's being done in energy, it's being done in transportation, it's being done in education.
[03:07.000 --> 03:20.000]  All of it is to centralize so that only mega massive corporations can scale up to the regulations and the software and the cost that is in the billions for these systems per industry.
[03:20.000 --> 03:30.000]  And then by regulatory fiat, all competition is destroyed. You vertically integrate the economy. You consolidate control for the post-industrial world.
[03:30.000 --> 03:45.000]  Today I'm proud to say that under the UK's presidency, the group of the world's 7 most advanced economies, the G7, is launching a set of public policy principles for retail central bank digital currencies, CBDCs.
[03:45.000 --> 03:56.000]  Digital cash could be programmed to ensure it is only spent on essentials or goods which an employer or government deems to be sensible. Holy shit.
[03:56.000 --> 04:12.000]  For many, many years we've seen digital technology move to build a corral, fences around each of us, digital fences of control, surveillance systems, systems that influence propaganda.
[04:12.000 --> 04:19.000]  And as they come up it's like a herd of cattle who have fences coming up around them.
[04:19.000 --> 04:32.000]  So think of us as having three fences around each one of us. And what CBDC and digital IDs and vaccine passports will do is they will snap into place a fourth fence.
[04:32.000 --> 04:40.000]  And when that fence snaps into place, we are locked down financially and digitally.
[04:40.000 --> 04:50.000]  They want the ring of Mordor. They want that total control and they want there to be a group of competing AI systems that basically merge into one global mind.
[04:50.000 --> 05:01.000]  And the AI's power is that it directs us and we follow its orders and that it takes control of the processes until humans don't know how to do basic tasks anymore.
[05:01.000 --> 05:11.000]  The Second American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order. And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  And Info Wars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  Now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[05:21.000 --> 05:30.000]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical memento so you can remember the great contribution you make to freedom.
[05:30.000 --> 05:43.000]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coins series, Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[05:43.000 --> 05:52.000]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a t-shirt or a DVD, 300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[05:52.000 --> 06:01.000]  Despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain. Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[06:22.000 --> 06:42.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:42.000 --> 06:51.000]  It's Monday, January 16th, 2023. I'm your host Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:51.000 --> 07:02.000]  Every broadcast is important, but this one will be particularly powerful and I would imagine the next day will be more powerful in the next show and the next because everything is hitting a quickening right now.
[07:02.000 --> 07:11.000]  I want everybody listening to the sound of my voice, you're watching me right now, to do what I'm about to do.
[07:11.000 --> 07:22.000]  Take a couple deep breaths and then sit back and assess the incredible developments taking place on multiple fronts.
[07:22.000 --> 07:41.000]  I have video, after video, after video, after video, and I have article, after article, after article, after article from Mainstream Corporate Horror News saying, OK, the British government arm that studies vaccines says this one should be recalled, it's hurting people.
[07:41.000 --> 07:53.000]  And CDC FDA board members saying they should halt the shots and the CDC and FDA coming out saying, OK, it is linked to heart attacks and strokes and blood clots.
[07:53.000 --> 08:08.000]  Incredible. Why are they doing that? Because they can't hide it anymore because we together, not just this broadcast, not just you, but many other people like Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and all of us together overpowered their asses.
[08:08.000 --> 08:26.000]  This has been a first big test inside the New World Order, inside Agenda 2030 when they went from baited operation, I'm getting huge chills right now, the first big battle of their full-on assault and we are winning, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:26.000 --> 08:42.000]  The whole future of our species stands in the balance right now. And it's just such an incredible time to be alive and to be witnessing all of this happening.
[08:42.000 --> 09:00.000]  Then we've got the Davos Group meeting in Davos, Switzerland being guarded by 5,000 troops and we have even mainstream media and their own admissions by Klaus Schwab that they're in trouble and that the world doesn't trust them as they're being targeted.
[09:00.000 --> 09:14.000]  And we now have confirmed reports that more than half the attendees that were on the list that leaked last Monday, eight days ago, ladies and gentlemen, that they've canceled going.
[09:14.000 --> 09:28.000]  People like George Soros because you're so villainized and so demonized when you go because we've done our job. They tried to have their coming out party, their big three-year assault where they're the heroes over the virus.
[09:28.000 --> 09:38.000]  They created the poison shot they created and now the rats are running around on the deck of the ship as it sinks.
[09:38.000 --> 09:49.000]  Wow, do I have stacks for you on that? Wow, victory. I can smell it. I can taste it. I can feel it. I can see it.
[09:49.000 --> 10:00.000]  But they're going to hit us and I know how they're going to hit us. They already pre-programmed it. They're going to hit us with power outages and massive cyber attacks taking down airlines, you name it, as I predicted in the last year now happening.
[10:00.000 --> 10:09.000]  Why an absence of A-listards at DeBose is not just deeply trouble and is not just spell deep trouble of the World Economic Forum but for globalists too.
[10:09.000 --> 10:19.000]  Why an absence of A-listards at DeBose is not just deep trouble for the World Economic Forum but for globalists too. That's Sky News, Fox News of the UK.
[10:19.000 --> 10:31.000]  Look at that. And it goes on from there where Klaus Schwab is at the event saying we will create trust again. They will trust us again.
[10:31.000 --> 10:40.000]  And don't worry, they've got a new system they're offering, universal basic income and reparations for Africans in Africa and black people in America.
[10:40.000 --> 10:52.000]  Just like Joe Biden was going to give you free tuition and forgive your student loans and he went, oh, here it is. Oh, after you voted for me, you thought, sorry, bye-bye.
[10:52.000 --> 10:58.000]  It's called dangling a carrot in front of your face.
[10:58.000 --> 11:11.000]  Oh, and wait till you see their agenda, their public agenda of how they're going to save us and all the wonderful things they're going to be doing for us, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:11.000 --> 11:21.000]  So that's a huge victory. We're going to go through all that. Matt Gage went on Tim Poole's show and did a really great five-minute summation about how the deep state really operates and how it comes after you.
[11:21.000 --> 11:30.000]  When you don't take the carrot that come after you with a stick, we're going to be looking at that. But this is just insane level information.
[11:30.000 --> 11:42.000]  Then we've got Democrats in California and in D.C. and other states but also the federal government introducing legislation to criminalize the First Amendment.
[11:42.000 --> 11:55.000]  You heard me right. Here is the headline Congress Man Introduces Bill that criminalizes criticism of any non-white person. That's actually in the bill.
[11:55.000 --> 12:03.000]  That's all they've got to fall back on is racial division and control. They think that is their ace in the hole.
[12:03.000 --> 12:22.000]  And that ties into Martin Luther King Day and the abomination that was unveiled. We'll be getting to a little bit later over the weekend that people, when they thought it was a joke, from one side it's a person putting their face in a butt crack.
[12:22.000 --> 12:36.000]  From the other side it's a giant bronze penis even when the penis had circumcised head being held up. And you ask why would they do such a thing? Why would they pay $15 million for that?
[12:36.000 --> 12:47.000]  Because it's all about ugly art and about a joke on us and that's why they do it. It's a declassified CA documents. We're going to be getting to that as well.
[12:47.000 --> 12:54.000]  If you make the art ugly and weird and bizarre in a joke, they believe that you make the culture a bizarre joke.
[12:54.000 --> 13:03.000]  And that ties in with how they're bringing down the joke Joe Biden. He's done, they're bringing him down. They always had the documents. They always knew he was a Chinese spy.
[13:03.000 --> 13:13.000]  They always knew he was a pedophile. And now he's lived his usefulness. Now they want him to get out of the way for Big Mike, Michelle Obama, to run.
[13:13.000 --> 13:20.000]  And that's all being lined up. Gavin Newsom's flooding around like a flying monkey as well, ready to be brought in.
[13:20.000 --> 13:27.000]  But now New York City Mayor Eric Adams lays blame squarely at the treat of Joe Biden during visits to the border.
[13:27.000 --> 13:36.000]  So now the Democrats are visiting the border and blaming the guy that deserves to be blamed except he's just the puppet. This is a globalist Obama policy.
[13:36.000 --> 13:45.000]  So now it's open season on Biden, USA Today, New York Times, Washington Post, LA Times. I've got stacks of articles. He's a spy.
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  He's got to go. More documents found by his staff. He's a senile guy that didn't even know what planet he's on.
[13:52.000 --> 14:01.000]  Now the Obama operatives are getting ready to bring him down. And so many conservatives are going, yay, we're vindicated. Yay.
[14:01.000 --> 14:10.000]  Down with Biden. Biden is an evil old degenerate puppet who can't even keep from pooping his pants.
[14:10.000 --> 14:17.000]  That's why it came out three weeks ago that he hates a secret service and refuses to talk in front of him or bring him with him when he's in buildings.
[14:17.000 --> 14:30.000]  Because we told you, according to the Secret Service in New York and D.C. on a two-day trip, he crapped himself three times last year.
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.000]  And if he gets mad in an argument with his staff, he just, he just craps himself.
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  Then they take him in the bathroom and they clean it up. And he likes making them do it.
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  LBJ like to have cabinet meetings with the Ivy League people where he would take these horrible, just incredibly stinking dumps.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  And I'm sorry to be gross, but this is real, this is real, okay? We're telling you what presidents are doing.
[14:55.000 --> 15:03.000]  And it's a humiliation act. And that's why Biden famously walked out and said, my butt's been wiped, my butt's been wiped, my butt's been wiped.
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  Well, they know their brain dead robot is totally failed. And so now he was a placeholder for us.
[15:10.000 --> 15:18.000]  They can implode the economy, bring in the world government, get rid of the border, launch all these wars, and have him to blame for the disaster that comes.
[15:18.000 --> 15:28.000]  So that they can now pre-position as they destroy him over the next year, the next person, so he doesn't announce that he is about to run for president.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  Because he still thinks he's the president. He's still on a power trip, so they need to let him know.
[15:32.000 --> 15:38.000]  If you run for president, the attorney general will indict you.
[15:38.000 --> 15:42.000]  Even though, but I'm supposed to be able to do that, it's his own branch guiding him.
[15:42.000 --> 15:46.000]  They don't care. It's the bureaucracy flexing its muscles.
[15:46.000 --> 15:50.000]  They'll flex them on Trump as much as they'll flex them on Biden.
[15:50.000 --> 15:54.000]  Also, we've got the latest transgender news. You're going to wait till you hear this.
[15:54.000 --> 16:18.000]  So much more coming up infowars.com tomorrow is this day.
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  Go to the book section and get your signed book.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  There are only about a thousand of these left. And when they're gone, they're gone.
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  I'm never going to sign the book again.
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later. There's a piece of art that goes with the book.
[16:40.000 --> 16:42.000]  But I haven't even decided what I'm going to do that. It may never happen.
[16:42.000 --> 16:52.000]  But for just simple, straight up signed books, and to be part of this fundraiser, this is the last time you'll be able to get the signed book at infowars.com.
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  I thank you all for your support. Please go to infowars.com and get your signed book today.
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  And I thank you for keeping us in the fight against the globalist.
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars live products have always been the highest quality, triple tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  But doing deep research, we made contact with the top company in the United States.
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  And it turned out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already using.
[17:18.000 --> 17:25.000]  So we've gone directly to the source, and that means we can give you lower prices on the very same high quality supplements.
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  And in some cases, even better.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  Introducing infowarsmd at infowarsstore.com.
[17:33.000 --> 17:59.000]  Find infowarsmd at infowarsstore.com.
[17:59.000 --> 18:08.000]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in minds, famously said more than 150 years ago,
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated.
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  Because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die.
[18:16.000 --> 18:18.000]  And it's the same PSYOP today.
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.000]  Info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support.
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  And because the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're going away,
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.000]  and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down info wars.
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.000]  And that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[18:41.000 --> 18:43.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  If you decide to go to infowarsstore.com and get supplements and books and films and t-shirts and so much more,
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  It is all in your hands.
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  So thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists, go to infowarsstore.com right now and keep us on air.
[18:58.000 --> 19:00.000]  It's up to you.
[19:00.000 --> 19:02.000]  It's a post COVID world now.
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.000]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors and the healthcare system.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  There's a solution, the wellness company.
[19:09.000 --> 19:12.000]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer.
[19:12.000 --> 19:19.000]  And I can tell you firsthand that these verticals of uncensored content, virtual appointments, doctors on demand,
[19:19.000 --> 19:27.000]  prescriptions through a network of community pharmacies in home, in vitro diagnostics, laboratory testing, imaging,
[19:27.000 --> 19:34.000]  an online set of holistic products can help guide you for your usual general medical care,
[19:34.000 --> 19:40.000]  but also COVID-19, acute and post COVID syndromes, vaccine injury syndromes,
[19:40.000 --> 19:47.000]  and the array of things that now America has to work through in this new world that we're living in.
[19:47.000 --> 19:54.000]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out the wellness company for a low monthly fee.
[19:54.000 --> 20:18.000]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[20:24.000 --> 20:33.000]  All right, let's do this.
[20:33.000 --> 20:41.000]  I've got three clips today that are new and several that have never been discovered.
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.000]  I've certainly never seen them that are going viral that are just all mind blowing.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  Each one of these is mind blowing and I'm going to hit those next segment.
[20:51.000 --> 20:57.000]  This is just insane. It is the UN openly admitting they're in an information war with the people of America and Europe
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  and that they control the media and that they direct it all.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  You already saw a couple months ago the UN had an information said that there's more clips.
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  And then we've got the Davos group and other meetings where they're currently saying
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.000]  we're taking over the genes of everybody's body and they're going to reprogram all your genes.
[21:15.000 --> 21:24.000]  Then they go on to say like with mice or rats we can make them have white hair or black hair with this mRNA as an example.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  And we're going to use the whole COVID situation to bring this in and take full control.
[21:28.000 --> 21:37.000]  Now they already said that five years ago on C-SPAN with Fauci we played the clip a lot but it's just they're admitting the whole thing.
[21:37.000 --> 21:49.000]  And we've got still all these shills getting paid by Big Pharma
[21:49.000 --> 21:56.000]  while Big Pharma announces are taking over our bodies and getting rid of any process of any type of testing
[21:56.000 --> 22:00.000]  and going right to the public totally evil saying none of this is happening.
[22:00.000 --> 22:04.000]  So they're in this paradox where they're normalizing it by admitting they're doing it,
[22:04.000 --> 22:09.000]  demonizing those of us to criticize it and then having other people come out and say it doesn't exist.
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  Because they want their cake and to eat it too.
[22:12.000 --> 22:18.000]  But I wanted to hit this first because this is a big, big deal.
[22:18.000 --> 22:24.000]  Why an absence of A-listers at Davos is not just deep trouble for the World Economic Forum but for globalists too.
[22:24.000 --> 22:31.000]  The world Davos thrived in is disintegrating and the summit has fewer heavyweights attending
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  than in years gone by as the era of globalism itself appears to be ending.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  The New World Order folks is in big trouble.
[22:40.000 --> 22:46.000]  When Hillary lost, they said they'd probably already lost an internal documents leaked out of the UN.
[22:46.000 --> 22:52.000]  And they launched the virus as a pretext to get us to buy into the control, bring in the World ID,
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  bring in the SDRs, bring in the global currencies.
[22:55.000 --> 23:01.000]  But now because there's hundreds of top scientists today, I can't even keep track of it,
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  literally coming out saying don't take it, it's deadly, oh my god, it's on purpose, they killed us,
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  here's the studies where they knew what happened.
[23:07.000 --> 23:12.000]  Everything we reverse engineered three years ago through now is all over the news now.
[23:12.000 --> 23:19.000]  So a lot of you are going to see us report on things we said years ago because it's just now coming out.
[23:19.000 --> 23:28.000]  And it's the same thing with the Spars War Game that the Rockefellers and the UN and John Hopkins did
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  two years before they released the virus, it describes how they were going to mitigate this
[23:33.000 --> 23:41.000]  and how they blame Big Pharma when the shot for a new virus destroyed our immune system,
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  how they'd make the public think it was a mistake.
[23:43.000 --> 23:50.000]  So they already had their plan to admit to a lot of it, but now it's gotten out of control.
[23:50.000 --> 23:54.000]  They've lost control, folks, they think they're God, they're not.
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.000]  So you look at this whole report, Davos and the World Economic Forum,
[23:58.000 --> 24:04.000]  WEF and its founder Klaus Schwab have become more famous than ever before in the past couple of years,
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  albeit not for the reasons they might have wanted, penetrating governments,
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  trying to destroy governmental control by the people, which they admit they're trying to do,
[24:12.000 --> 24:17.000]  trying to cut your carbon, trying to bankrupt the old system and create a new system.
[24:17.000 --> 24:23.000]  The minute the public knows the new world order is bad for you and your family and it's been to enslave you
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  and that opposing them is the answer to freedom and prosperity, it's game over.
[24:27.000 --> 24:31.000]  I've said that probably 3,000 times the last few years.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  I say it every day.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  And our job is to say, they're the authors of your pain.
[24:37.000 --> 24:42.000]  And as soon as we light their ass up with the truth, just like in the military,
[24:42.000 --> 24:48.000]  they put the special forces in to lay the target so that when the missiles come in, they know where to hit.
[24:48.000 --> 24:51.000]  Now I'm using that as an allegory, I'm not saying shoot missiles at them,
[24:51.000 --> 24:55.000]  I'm saying our job was to take the heat,
[24:55.000 --> 25:01.000]  lay the target, light it up so that people knew what was happening and we did it, folks, you did it.
[25:01.000 --> 25:10.000]  We lit their ass up, we lit their ass up, you lit their ass up and now their ass is grass.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  But they're going to strike back.
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  Look at these headlines.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  Trust in U.S. institution hits record low, national poll finds Forbes and they've got international polls.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  They've got global polls all finding the exact same thing.
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.000]  Trust in government hits all time low.
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.000]  Australian National University.
[25:34.000 --> 25:38.000]  Public trust in government lowest ever recorded.
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  So they thought they'd execute this plan and get away with it.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  We would just blame our national leaders.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  In fact, Schwab talked about as we bring in our system and destroy the oil system,
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.000]  it should be the politicians and others that will get the blame.
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  Then we will be the saviors.
[25:52.000 --> 25:55.000]  No, you won't, buddy boy.
[25:55.000 --> 25:56.000]  We've got your plan.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  We've blown your plan.
[25:58.000 --> 26:01.000]  Praise God.
[26:01.000 --> 26:05.000]  And passed the information warfare ammunition.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  And you got the eco groups that would ever do it.
[26:07.000 --> 26:12.000]  Now suddenly slamming Debo's summit for their global elites arriving on their private jets.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  They thought they could have it both ways.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  Soros pulls out of World Economic Forum due to unavoidable scheduling problem.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  Now up to half the group that are on the list that we're going to attend
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  are suddenly announcing they're not coming.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  They don't want to be associated with it.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  They thought we'd all fight over race and everything else.
[26:33.000 --> 26:36.000]  They thought they'd distract us.
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.000]  But now their 5,000 troops won't protect their reputations,
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  their names for the actions and crimes they've committed.
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  Guard them all day.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  We don't want them to die.
[26:45.000 --> 26:48.000]  We don't want anybody to shoot them or bomb them or poison them.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  We want them arrested for Nuremberg II,
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  for the crimes against humanity they've committed,
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  for the plan to implode the world economy
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  and flood the borders and roll out the poison shot
[26:58.000 --> 27:01.000]  and try to take over our bodies and create a world ID.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  All of it is classical tyranny.
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.000]  And we want you kept nice and healthy.
[27:09.000 --> 27:16.000]  For when you get marched up to those gallows after you've been found guilty
[27:16.000 --> 27:21.000]  and before that trap door opens and you fall those three feet
[27:21.000 --> 27:28.000]  and your neck is broken.
[27:28.000 --> 27:31.000]  A new system inside the Debo Summit 2023.
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  It's up on infoworks.com from zeroheads.com.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  And they have met and say, oh, here's our agenda
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  addressing the current energy and food crisis,
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  which they've engineered, cutting off power over the world,
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  cutting off food production over the world.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  Literally having the Debo script and UN direct,
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  the biggest producers in the world,
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  to massively cut food production.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  And then they cut the fertilizer off.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  They cut the fuel off.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  They cut the machine parts off.
[27:55.000 --> 27:58.000]  And then they're going to address it with bugs.
[27:58.000 --> 27:59.000]  That's right.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  Addressing the current energy and food crisis
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  in the context of a new system for energy, climate and nature
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  will save you.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  Let's go to our new system.
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  Addressing the current high inflation,
[28:10.000 --> 28:13.000]  low growth, high debt economy in context of a new system,
[28:13.000 --> 28:17.000]  a new system for investment, credit infrastructure run by them
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  as they blow up the old system.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  Addressing the current industrial headwinds
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  in the context of a new system for harnessing frontier technologies
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  that they own and control that don't work
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  for private sector innovation and resilience.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Four, addressing the current social vulnerabilities
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.000]  in context of a new system, social credit score, skills and care.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Number five, addressing the current geopolitical risk
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  in the context of a new system for dialogue
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  cooperating in a multi-polar world.
[28:44.000 --> 28:47.000]  Positioning the West for its fall into a global crisis
[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  they control, except they need to be positioned
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  as the boss and the savior.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  And you're positioned as the villain,
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  not where you wanted to be, Claude Schwab and Bill Gates.
[28:57.000 --> 29:21.000]  We have you!
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[29:30.000 --> 29:32.000]  my number one worldwide bestseller.

[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  you can buy it at Amazon, but anywhere.

[29:38.000 --> 29:41.000]  and be part of a fundraiser to keep us on air at this critical point,

[29:53.000 --> 29:55.000]  to take action now and please keep us on air.

[31:25.000 --> 31:27.000]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[31:27.000 --> 31:29.000]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves

[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  and it keeps InfoWarsStore on the air.
[31:45.000 --> 31:47.000]  So again, introducing InfoWars MD,
[31:47.000 --> 31:49.000]  now exclusively available at InfoWars MD.
[31:49.000 --> 31:53.000]  InfoWars is winning.
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  InfoWars is reaching more people than ever.
[31:55.000 --> 31:57.000]  We were supposed to be off the air
[31:57.000 --> 31:59.000]  months and months and months ago,
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  mainstream media told you, but it's not true.
[32:01.000 --> 32:03.000]  They told you, we were going to be shut down.
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  They told you, we owed a billion and a half dollars.
[32:05.000 --> 32:07.000]  None of that's true. It's all being appealed.
[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  They want you to think InfoWars is dead.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  But if you simply stand and say,
[32:11.000 --> 32:13.000]  we're going to be shut down,
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  we're going to be shut down,
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  we're going to be shut down,
[32:17.000 --> 32:19.000]  we're going to be dead.
[32:19.000 --> 32:21.000]  But if you simply stand up and support InfoWars,
[32:21.000 --> 32:23.000]  we've got years and years of appeals
[32:23.000 --> 32:25.000]  and we will not be taken off the air.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  But if they can convince you that we've been shut down,
[32:27.000 --> 32:29.000]  they're going to win.
[32:29.000 --> 32:31.000]  Don't let the globalist sigh up you and your family.
[32:31.000 --> 32:33.000]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com and get incredible products,
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  supplements, books, films, t-shirts,
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  you name it, that fund the InfoWars
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.000]  and empower your life and let the globalists know
[32:39.000 --> 32:41.000]  their sigh up has not worked.
[32:41.000 --> 32:43.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air.
[32:43.000 --> 32:45.000]  Take action at infowarstore.com today.
[32:45.000 --> 32:47.000]  Because the only people that can take us off the air
[32:47.000 --> 32:49.000]  is you, the viewers and listeners.
[32:49.000 --> 32:51.000]  The majority of you have not been sighed up.
[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  But some of you have.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  Do not let the globalist brainwash you.
[32:55.000 --> 33:17.000]  Go to infowars.com and keep us on the air.
[33:25.000 --> 33:41.000]  All right, let me hit this group of clips.
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  At least we'll get the sum up.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  Of the WF, the UN and other globalist organizations
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  admitting the plan to take over your body,
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  to take over your DNA.
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  And he's covered as the pretext to do it all.
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  But let me tell you about what's coming up tomorrow.
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  We're going to do a fundraiser tomorrow.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  But it's going to be a very special broadcast.
[34:03.000 --> 34:06.000]  We've got more than 30 guests that are being set up
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  from 8 a.m. tomorrow,
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  from 8 a.m. tomorrow
[34:11.000 --> 34:14.000]  until past midnight.
[34:14.000 --> 34:18.000]  And here is the list of some of the guests we're going to have.
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  We have a new website that simply has the live show
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  feed on it and donate buttons.
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  And a place to put your email in if you want news alerts.
[34:28.000 --> 34:31.000]  And that is conspiracyfact.info.
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  The site's not built yet.
[34:33.000 --> 34:34.000]  There's some basic info on it.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  We'll be done in the next few hours.
[34:36.000 --> 34:39.000]  But conspiracyfact.info is not a redirect.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  It's a completely new website that's not been blacklisted
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  by Google, Twitter, Facebook, or any of them yet.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  They probably will.
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  But for now, you can say, hey, Alex Jones is on air
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  breaking down the secrets of the New World Order
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  while the Davos Group meets in Switzerland.
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  Their whole program is imploding.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  Humanity is awakening.
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  Share the link until those you give it to
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  share the link, and tell them to tell the people
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  that they give it to to share the link,
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  and so forth, and so on.
[35:06.000 --> 35:09.000]  So, conspiracyfact.info,
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  conspiracyfact.info.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  One word, conspiracyfact.info.
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  And here is who is going to be on the show tomorrow.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  A bunch of big guests, including myself,
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  with Harrison Smith.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  We'll line up a bunch for him tomorrow.
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  An 8 a.m. kickoff.
[35:25.000 --> 35:26.000]  11 a.m. with me.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[35:28.000 --> 35:29.000]  Mark Passio.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  Hotep Jesus Drew Hernandez.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  Gavin McGinnis.
[35:32.000 --> 35:33.000]  Dr. Judy Mikovits.
[35:33.000 --> 35:34.000]  Don't want to miss that.
[35:34.000 --> 35:35.000]  Maria Z.
[35:35.000 --> 35:36.000]  With a bunch of special guests.
[35:36.000 --> 35:37.000]  Roger Stone.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  Savannah Hernandez.
[35:39.000 --> 35:40.000]  Darren Beatty.
[35:40.000 --> 35:41.000]  Dan Dix.
[35:41.000 --> 35:42.000]  Tom Renz.
[35:42.000 --> 35:43.000]  Jay Dyer.
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  With a big spars update.
[35:45.000 --> 35:46.000]  Incredible info.
[35:46.000 --> 35:47.000]  He's got on that front.
[35:47.000 --> 35:48.000]  Edward Dowd.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  Doing the actuaries on the death numbers.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  Mickey Willis in studio.
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  Alex Stein.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  Dr. Stella Emanuel.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  Robert Barnes.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  And a bunch of other surprise guests
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  that we are lining up right now,
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  but we've got it on the list.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  So, conspiracyfact.info.
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  And look, here's the deal.
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  Our information is more pertinent
[36:10.000 --> 36:13.000]  and more authoritative now
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  than it's ever been.
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  People are really ready to hear the truth.
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  The censorship's all coming out.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  The poison shots are coming out.
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  Their world government's coming out.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.000]  They're planning to implode the economy
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  and the borders is coming out.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  But they're only intensifying their attacks
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  on the tip of the spear.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  That's why Elon Musk didn't bring me back to Twitter,
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  but brought back almost everybody else.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  Because the system knows I've got their number
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  and knows that we have given them
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  the majority of their opposition.
[36:38.000 --> 36:39.000]  That means you have.
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  They hate this audience of activists.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  So please tell folks about the special broadcast tomorrow.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  Please get millions of extra folks to tune in
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  because we're going to be hard hitting.
[36:49.000 --> 36:50.000]  And for a lot of the broadcasts,
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  it's going to be commercial free.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  During my show and Owen's show and Harrison's
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  that are on a lot of TV and radio stations,
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  we'll be taking some of the breaks.
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  We're going to skip our network breaks,
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  but we'll run the local breaks for local stations
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  so they get those, they need those.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  But this is going to be very powerful.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  A lot of breaking news tomorrow and a fundraiser.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  I need you to go to mforestore.com,
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  make a $5, $10, $20 donation,
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  or do a recurring if you want,
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  canceling time for free.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  Just click a button.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  I need you to go there and get products
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  you already need like the Real Red Pill Plus
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  and down and out sleep aid,
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  our strongest sleep aid that's back in stock.
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  Real Red Pill is 50% off.
[37:28.000 --> 37:31.000]  The sleep aid is 40% off.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  Talk about intensifying the quality of your life.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  These products are incredible.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  It's also your last chance to get a signed copy
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  of the Great Reset in the World for the World,
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  part of that fundraiser.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  If you want to pay a lot less,
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  just get the regular book unsigned.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  But if you have the money, you want to donate,
[37:49.000 --> 37:50.000]  have a memento of your support,
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  you get a signed copy of the book
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  at mforestore.com.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  We have the Great Info Wars MD Line
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  with turmeric 95, mushroom max.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  That's the next level of tropic
[38:00.000 --> 38:03.000]  and the CBD full spectrum highest end
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  for about half the price you pay in stores
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  for the very same CBD oil.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  It's so great for paying, so amazing for joints and more.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  That's all under the M4 Wars MD banner
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  at mforestore.com.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  And one last thing,
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  all of the
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  founding members
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  who got the coins
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  at mforestore.com
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  and 1776coin.com,
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  I'm six, eight months behind all our projects.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  But finally, we're going to start launching
[38:32.000 --> 38:35.000]  some of those projects at the end of this week
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  and in the next week.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  So, everybody that got a founding member coin
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  are going to get some real benefits for that.
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  But I told you up front, if we can shut down,
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  you'll never get any benefits.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  You know, you just kept us on air for a while
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  and changed the world and have that historical
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  piece of history
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  that you know you have skin in the game.
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  But thank God we've gone through all these hurdles,
[38:54.000 --> 38:56.000]  gone through all these things, we're still on air.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  And so anybody that got any one of the first three coins
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  or if you get the Teddy Roosevelt coin,
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  only a few thousand left of that as well,
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  will extend founding membership to you as well.
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  You're not just going to get big promo codes
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  for discounts nobody else gets at infoforestore.com.
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  You're not just going to get things like that.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  You're going to get free memberships to things
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  that will be announced very, very soon and more.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  So I want to thank you all for your support
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  and for getting this far.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  There's a few thousand coins left
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  of the Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena coin.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  Use promo code 17761776
[39:27.000 --> 39:30.000]  at 1776coin.com
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  or patriccollectibles.com will take you there as well.
[39:32.000 --> 39:35.000]  And you get $30 off the final coin.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  And yes, just like the books,
[39:37.000 --> 39:40.000]  $99 get the unsigned for 20 bucks or whatever.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  It's like NPR sells a coffee mug for 50 bucks
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  or a t-shirt for 100 bucks or a ball cap for 50 bucks.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  It's a memento that you pledged and you donated.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  But it's an all silver coin designed by me,
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  made right here in America.
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  You can get it exclusively when they're gone.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  They're gone 1776coin.com.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  We need your support now.
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.000]  Please go there and get the coin at 1776coin.com.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  We are fighting the globalist toe-to-toe
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  and we cannot do it without you.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  Okay, I'm a few minutes out from break
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  and I'm going to come back and hit that big news
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  and those clips I mentioned that are so incredible.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  Also, I intend to open the phones up
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  throughout the broadcast today
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  in the second and third hour until Ezra Levant
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  of the Incredible.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  For the size of the organization,
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  they're the most powerful out there.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  I mean, when it comes to hardcore reporters around the world
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  breaking incredible news, Ezra Levant and his team
[40:41.000 --> 40:42.000]  are just incredible.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  He is in Davos.
[40:44.000 --> 40:45.000]  He is there covering it.
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  He joins us in the last 30 minutes of the third hour.
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  But in the second and the first half of the third hour,
[40:54.000 --> 40:59.000]  we are going to be taking your phone calls on any issue
[40:59.000 --> 41:04.000]  or any item or any area that you want to get into today.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  So I really look forward to open the phones up.
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  That's always informative, always takes us in angles
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  and directions we wouldn't have gone in.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  But I'll also be interspersing a ton
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  because this is all not a prop up here in front of me.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  These are all real articles, real stories, real insanity
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  that we're going to be getting to here today.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  But these particular clips I'm about to play
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  are so criminal.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  Every one of these clips should have the Justice Department
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  getting indictments of Davos group members
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  in Big Pharma and in government and in corporations.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  I mean, if you go to Wikipedia, it's linked to their website.
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  They say we want to capture governments.
[41:48.000 --> 41:51.000]  We want to capture democracies and remove the people
[41:51.000 --> 41:52.000]  from the governing process.
[41:52.000 --> 41:56.000]  That's on Wikipedia with a link to Klaus Schwab's own website.
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  When you want to capture governments
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  and bring the people out of the decision-making process,
[42:00.000 --> 42:07.000]  that's a fancy way of saying totalitarianism, dictatorship.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  And that's what's so wild about this,
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.000]  is they're just rebranding stuff that we know is bad.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  I mean, if you had a bottle of cyanide, one drop will kill you.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  And instead of having a skull and bones on it saying cyanide,
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  deadly poison, don't touch, don't drink, don't inhale,
[42:23.000 --> 42:32.000]  and you put flowers on it and said, this is sugar water or something.
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  People would drink it and die.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  But I mean, you still see the effects.
[42:36.000 --> 42:41.000]  You still know what it is, and it's just beyond wild.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Absolutely beyond insane.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  Absolutely just.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  It's so weird to still be on air during the New World War
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  Takeover.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  I mean, but we're here.
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  We're still on air because it's not just evil.
[42:51.000 --> 42:52.000]  There's good.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  And so we're still on air fighting and we're having victory.
[42:55.000 --> 43:24.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[43:25.000 --> 43:45.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[43:45.000 --> 43:54.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[43:54.000 --> 44:23.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[44:24.000 --> 44:51.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[44:51.000 --> 45:18.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[45:18.000 --> 45:46.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[45:46.000 --> 46:13.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[46:13.000 --> 46:42.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[46:42.000 --> 47:11.000]  We've got to push harder now than ever.
[47:12.000 --> 47:23.000]  Everybody knows that the days are loaded.
[47:23.000 --> 47:28.000]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[47:28.000 --> 47:33.000]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.000]  Everybody knows the good guy's lost.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  We're updating the site, adding a lot of new information.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  The conspiracy fact.info.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  That's the URL the next 48 hours to share.
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  Because they're blocking info wars, they're blocking Band-Aid video everywhere.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  But that site is a whole new site that has the live feeds, everything on it.
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  They'll block that too, and we'll just keep fighting to promote a new URL.
[47:59.000 --> 48:05.000]  We're never giving up and we're actually having big victory right now in our live times, in live time.
[48:05.000 --> 48:11.000]  Even if we were losing, we'd keep fighting because God's watching and it's the right thing to do.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  Okay, let's start getting to this.
[48:14.000 --> 48:25.000]  This first clip is the WEF event saying we will use mRNA to correct genetic mutations.
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.000]  And that's why they've blown up the whole authorization process and don't do animal testing now.
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  Which they started three years ago by executive action.
[48:34.000 --> 48:39.000]  Now they passed a bill last year, in December, just a month ago, to legalize this here in the US.
[48:39.000 --> 48:43.000]  And it's all the agenda of the UN and the WEF.
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.000]  So here they are admitting that they're taking over your bodies.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  What did Klaus Schwab say?
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  In the new revolution, we don't change the world.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  We change you.
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  And what did Harari say last week?
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  We're going to make the government force you to do it.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  We're going to make sure you do this for your own good.
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.000]  Here it is.
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.000]  Clip 20.
[49:07.000 --> 49:15.000]  So this is a precision tool that now allows us to take this protein RNA complex
[49:15.000 --> 49:22.000]  and introduce it into cells or tissues to correct mutations at sites where we know
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  there's a deleterious change in the genetic code.
[49:25.000 --> 49:29.000]  So I wanted to show you an example of how this can be utilized.
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.000]  This protein complex can actually be injected directly into fertilized eggs of a mouse.
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  And in the experiment you'll see we're targeting a gene that is responsible for the black coat color in mice.
[49:43.000 --> 49:47.000]  And so normally these mice have beautiful glossy black coats.
[49:47.000 --> 49:55.000]  And once we make this targeted change, we then implant these edited eggs back into a female mouse.
[49:55.000 --> 50:01.000]  And when she gives birth to pups, you'll see that the pups are now mostly white.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  And the remarkable thing about this experiment is that when these mouse mice grow up,
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  you can test them and show that every cell in the body has this single genetic change
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  that gives rise to the white coat color, but otherwise they're absolutely normal.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  So they are normal mice, no mutations elsewhere in the genome.
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  This is a type of experiment that used to take at least a year to create a mouse like this.
[50:24.000 --> 50:30.000]  And now it can be done in a few weeks and by people that don't have to have special expertise.
[50:30.000 --> 50:37.000]  So this technology has been very exciting over the last two and a half years to see this technology taking off.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  These are publications in the scientific literature.
[50:40.000 --> 50:47.000]  It's been sort of exponential growth of publications, people using this technology for all sorts of applications.
[50:47.000 --> 50:55.000]  And so some of these include making changes in targeted genetic changes in plants, in fungi,
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  in animals that are important to agriculturally, in animals that are important to us as pets,
[51:01.000 --> 51:07.000]  and also in thinking about human health also to do things like make changes in stem cells,
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  which are cells that can give rise to new organs.
[51:10.000 --> 51:18.000]  Also to make changes in animals that are important as models of human disease such as mice and monkeys.
[51:18.000 --> 51:26.000]  And we think within the not too distant future it will be possible to actually use this technology to make changes in humans.
[51:26.000 --> 51:31.000]  And of course they now in major studies admit that the mRNA vaccines do change the DNA in your cells
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  and it's passed on for generations.
[51:33.000 --> 51:37.000]  Of course she lies and says it doesn't change any of the other genes, which they now admit it does.
[51:37.000 --> 51:46.000]  All lies from these criminals and the first major thing they launched on us hurts us with spike protein and kills us out of the gates.
[51:46.000 --> 51:50.000]  Here's the WEF head of sustainability risk, Zurich Insurance Group.
[51:50.000 --> 51:58.000]  John Scott says organizations with pre-approved information put in place to direct WHO and CDC.
[51:58.000 --> 52:03.000]  So the big corporations directed the WHO and the CDC as well as the WEF,
[52:03.000 --> 52:11.000]  we eventually got vaccine development in place after political resistance and big pharma vetted C-19 med solutions for pandemic.
[52:11.000 --> 52:15.000]  They were already ready, as Fauci said five years ago before they were launched this,
[52:15.000 --> 52:21.000]  to blow up the old system and get rid of any studies or approval and just force this on us.
[52:21.000 --> 52:26.000]  They didn't bring us something to help us out of the gates, which would have sold us on it and then they'd kill us later.
[52:26.000 --> 52:32.000]  They wanted to kill us and hurt us right away and then have their own doctors and scientists cover it up and be part of the corruption.
[52:32.000 --> 52:37.000]  Here's the head of sustainability risk at the WEF.
[52:37.000 --> 52:43.000]  We've warned many times about health issues in the global risk report over the last 15 years,
[52:43.000 --> 52:49.000]  from Ebola to before Ebola, SARS and MERS Ebola in 1415.
[52:49.000 --> 52:58.000]  And as Adrian was saying, that had an impact because there were organizations like the Global Vaccine Alliance
[52:58.000 --> 53:06.000]  and the Centre for Epidemic Preparedness put in place to help organizations like the World Health Organization
[53:06.000 --> 53:16.000]  and the Centre for Disease Control in individual countries to actually deliver the right information as to how to address infectious diseases.
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.000]  I think that did work during the pandemic.
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.000]  In a lot of countries there were some political challenges in the sense that not everybody wanted to listen to that.
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  We had very good advice from those organizations.
[53:29.000 --> 53:33.000]  But eventually, yes, we did get the vaccine development in place.
[53:33.000 --> 53:42.000]  We did see incredible collaboration in the pharmaceutical industry in particular to look through the long lists of drugs
[53:42.000 --> 53:50.000]  to see whether any of them would have some effect on reducing the symptoms of COVID-19.
[53:50.000 --> 53:56.000]  So I think that, you know, all of that is still in place. Pandemics don't just come and go.
[53:56.000 --> 54:02.000]  They come and go and they come back again. And so we should be prepared for that.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.000]  Of course, that's all lies other than the fact that they controlled the information.
[54:06.000 --> 54:10.000]  It didn't protect you. They blocked the therapeutics.
[54:10.000 --> 54:15.000]  But here's the UN official admits Google algorithm manipulates climate info,
[54:15.000 --> 54:23.000]  vaccine info, borders info, election info. Melissa Fleming, who is UN Undersecretary,
[54:23.000 --> 54:26.000]  UN Undersecretary General for Global Communications,
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.000]  made the remarks while speaking at the World Economic Forum. Here she is.
[54:30.000 --> 54:35.000]  You know, we partnered with Google, for example. If you Google climate change,
[54:35.000 --> 54:41.000]  you will, at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled climate change,
[54:46.000 --> 54:51.000]  we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.
[54:51.000 --> 54:57.000]  So we're becoming much more proactive. You know, we own the science and we think that the world,
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  you know, should know it. And the platforms themselves also do.
[55:02.000 --> 55:10.000]  But again, it's a huge, huge challenge that I think all sectors of society
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  need to be very active in.
[55:13.000 --> 55:16.000]  We own the science. We own your body.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  We'll put you in a FEMA camp if you don't agree with us now in Australia and Canada.
[55:20.000 --> 55:23.000]  There are already arresting people that disagree with it.
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  In fact, I have new footage that I meant to send to the crew.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  There was a big story up yesterday. So you guys go back through Sunday and Monday
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  and print me the articles on M4 Wars.
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  Because we have the footage of a woman being murdered in Canada
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  because she wouldn't wear a mask in the hospital.
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  And they admitted the corner report that she was affixiated.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  She was strangled to death.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  And the judge just threw the case out and said, well, that's just the way it is.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  So that's who these people are.
[55:53.000 --> 55:58.000]  Animal testing drugs for U.S. FDA approval no longer mandatory.
[55:58.000 --> 56:03.000]  Called the FDA Modernization Two Point Bill, signed a law by U.S. President Joe Biden,
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  saw support for Republicans and Democrats. Now no testing.
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.000]  It just goes directly to the public and that's spun like it's an innovation.
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  So it's not good to test this stuff on animals.
[56:16.000 --> 56:21.000]  Is it good to test it in a forced way on the people?
[56:21.000 --> 56:24.000]  All right, here's what's going to happen in the next hour.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  Horace from Matt Gaetz was on Tim Pool and in a short five minute clip
[56:28.000 --> 56:33.000]  really knocked it out of the park describing exactly how the deep state operates
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  and what we're facing. We're going to be getting to that.
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  I'm going to open the phones up and take your calls.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  We're going to look more at what's happening at the Debo's group.
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  Also, more and more economists predict the world is headed for stagflation,
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  not just inflation.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  And the majority of economists agree the world is in a recession.
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  We've already been having multiple quarters of this, folks.
[56:53.000 --> 56:58.000]  So we are going into a worldwide depression and we need to be honest about that
[56:58.000 --> 57:02.000]  and exactly what the central banks have done.
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.000]  We'll also look at how they're trying to stoke racial division in this country.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  Congress introduces a bill that criminalizes criticism of any non-white person.
[57:11.000 --> 57:16.000]  We'll look at Martin Luther King Day and this hideous new $15 million sculpture
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  they unveiled in Boston that is Martin Luther King's wife holding
[57:21.000 --> 57:26.000]  what looks like a 200-foot-long penis.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  So it's just all about flaunting it in our face.
[57:29.000 --> 57:33.000]  We've got so much on the whole transgenderism, cult front as well.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  Big second and third and fourth hours today,
[57:36.000 --> 57:39.000]  ahead of the War Room with Owen Shroyer, 3PM Central.
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.000]  I'm Alex Jones. You are the Paul Revere's. Don't forget that.
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.000]  Please share the link to infowars.com for our live show, conspiracyfact.info.
[57:46.000 --> 57:56.000]  In the year 2000, Alex Jones' film Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove
[57:56.000 --> 58:03.000]  showed the world how our so-called elite leaders practice mock ritual sacrifices in private.
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.000]  In 2007, Alex Jones releases Endgame,
[58:08.000 --> 58:15.000]  exposing the world elite's plans for covertly using biological weapons against all of mankind
[58:15.000 --> 58:19.000]  and by the time they launched their attack in 2020,
[58:19.000 --> 58:24.000]  Alex Jones' infowars and our audience were there to warn the people
[58:24.000 --> 58:27.000]  of the deadly vaccines that we knew were coming.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  This is why they attack us.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  This is why we need your support.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  Because we tell the truth, Alex Jones was right.
[58:35.000 --> 58:39.000]  Join the resistance this Tuesday, all day long.
[58:39.000 --> 58:42.000]  The Alex Jones was right marathon.
[58:42.000 --> 58:47.000]  Join us in the fight for freedom and help us defeat the New World Order.
[59:13.000 --> 59:18.000]  Only your commitment to keep infowars on the air will ensure our victory against the New World Order.
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  They're coming for you and your family.
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  They're coming for me. They're coming for the children.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  But to get to the children, they've got to get through us first.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  These monsters are all over television wanting to give these shots to newborn babies.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  They're already given to pregnant women.
[59:30.000 --> 59:32.000]  Miscarriages are off the chart.
[59:32.000 --> 59:37.000]  80-plus percent increase in miscarriages in the first two prime ministers after these poison shots.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  We can and will save the children, and they are counting on us.
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  Let's do it together.
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  And the fight starts at infowars.com.
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  And the fight continues with your financial support at infowarsstore.com.
[59:49.000 --> 01:00:12.000]  Take action now.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  This hidden knowledge can be described as natural law or universal law.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  Inescapable laws of reality that affect each and every one of us from moment to moment.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  They have been hidden from the public as a means of keeping humanity ignorant
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  and thereby controllable and ultimately enslaved.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  So long as we remain ignorant of them, mankind will never be free.
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.000]  The terminology of the word apocalypse reveals its occulted meaning,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  which is to uncover or reveal something that was hidden.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  One can argue that the apocalypse already happened
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  and that we are now living in the post-apocalyptic world.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  In 1928, Manly P. Hall published The Secret Teachings of All Ages,
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  a comprehensive introduction to all of this occulted knowledge
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  which has been used to manipulate the ignorant masses of humanity for millennia.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  And while many people choose to educate themselves,
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  many others have chosen to remain ignorant.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  Ignorance is not bliss.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:35.000]  It is the reason why humanity continues to fall deeper into bondage.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  These laws are fairly simple and they can be found in every culture on earth.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  In the Hermetic Sciences revealed to the public in 1908,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  we have seven laws.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  The first three, Mentalism, Correspondence and Vibration,
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  teach us how everything is connected, that everything begins with our thoughts
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  and that everything in this reality is a frequency.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  You could say that we are all living within the mind of God and our thoughts matter.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  The principle of polarity teaches us that things which appear to be opposites
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  are actually related.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  Love and hate are merely polar opposites of the same thing.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  And knowing this makes it easier for us to transform our hate into love.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  It allows us to turn a negative into a positive.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  The principle of rhythm teaches that everything in nature has its rhythm.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  The measure of the swing to the right is equal to the measure of the swing to the left.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  This allows us to better navigate the waves of reality.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  The principle of cause and effect may be the most important to understand.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  Each and every one of our thoughts and corresponding actions in this life
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  has an inescapable effect on everything around us.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  And the principle of gender teaches us that there are only two genders
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  and that everything in this reality has its masculine and feminine aspects.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  One could argue that the apocalypse happened thousands of years ago with the Ten Commandments,
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  the laws of how to liberate oneself from the land of slavery.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  These natural laws were taught in the East by the Buddha who taught us of right action.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  And these natural laws were perhaps most eloquently simplified in the teachings of Christ
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  with the golden rule,
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000]  in everything due to others what you would have them do to you.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  Do not take another person's life.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  Do not assault or rape another person.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  Do not steal another person's property.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  And do not trespass upon them in any way.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  Do not coerce or manipulate another person.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  In the most simple terms, do not steal anything from anyone.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Live and let live.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  This is the path to freedom.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  And you will know the truth and the truth will make you free.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Each and every one of us is affecting this reality with every thought and every action.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  And if we choose to remain ignorant of this, then we are choosing to be sheep.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  And we will always be enslaved.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Understanding these natural laws and treating others with love and respect
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  is the only way to true freedom.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  Today's politics is nothing other than fighting for your favorite prison guard.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Prison guards who will ultimately coerce you and trespass against you.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  True freedom comes from our actions
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  because a society of ignorant and belligerent sheep deserve to be in prison.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  And that will never change.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  I'm encouraging you now to get one of the very last coins in a four coin series,

[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  Thank you for your support.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  I want to start going to your phone calls next segment.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  On the day most group, on all the vaccine news coming out, on the politics you see unfolding,
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  on how they're getting ready to flush Joe Biden, just like we said they would,
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  and the whole system, the Democratic Party and not just people in the federal government,
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  but the state governments turning against him.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  What do you see coming out of that?
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Does that concern you?
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  And look, I'm happy to get rid of Biden, but he'll get the blame for the whole agenda
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000]  and then they'll put in their next group of puppets, just like shark teeth.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  One group gets defeated, the next group rolls forward.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  I want to target with the information the controllers, the Democratic Party and the deep state,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  but it's also a big part of the Republican Party as well.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  We're taking first-time callers, 877-789-2539.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  Now, I want to talk about this.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  I covered it last hour, but we should be thanking God and also I want to thank all of you
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]  for the action you've taken.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  I read to you the mainstream news headlines from all over the world
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.000]  that up to half of the attendees on the list are now announcing they're canceling and not going
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  because DeBose is rated as the most unpopular organization in the world.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000]  So in an ugly contest, they're the ugliest.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  Conversely, freedom and anti-globalism is extremely popular.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]  So we're winning the hearts and minds.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  They may have stolen the money, they may have controlled the military,
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000]  they may have controlled the propaganda, they may have controlled the borders,
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000]  and they're certainly assaulting us, but humanity is coming roaring back.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  I'd like to talk about that with listeners.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  In the new system, they're, quote, announcing the great reset.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]  They've gotten even more detailed about it.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  Sky News headline, why an absence of A-listers at DeBose is not just deep trouble
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  for the World Economic Forum, but for globalists too.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  And I can look at the body language of Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and tell you they're scared.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  They should be.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  But more importantly, I can tell you what's going on.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000]  They're controllers.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  There's people above them.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  They know it's not working.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  That's why Schwab just came out this weekend on the eve of the launch of this globalist corporate government,
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  world government confab.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  That's why he came out and said, oh, we're going to restore trust in our meeting.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  You can trust us.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  We're going to fix all the problems that they literally have created or exacerbated.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  Total free number, 877-789-2539-877-789-ALEX.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  There's the number on your screen for TV viewers.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  So your calls are coming up.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  But again, we can't just announce this on Friday and announce it on Saturday and talk about it on Sunday
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  and forget about it.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  We're going to play the clips again.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  I already played the new ones on Friday and Saturday and Sunday.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  I'm not going to play them again.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  But CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, ABC, NBC, CBS, all reporting that board members on the FDA are upset at the CDC and at Big Pharma
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  for not telling them that they did quiet studies and found that the vaccines didn't work
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  and that they were linked to heart attacks and strokes.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  How huge is that?
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  And I wondered on Thursday and Friday as it started to break.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000]  I told you it was coming for months.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]  I wondered how they respond.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  And they had all the usual suspects.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  While on one hand they admit it's happening on the same programs,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  and they have folks like Dan Abrams come out and say,
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  it's a conspiracy.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  Nobody's been hurt.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  Take your shot.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  It's perfect.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  It's wonderful.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000]  No, it's in the insurance company numbers.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  We have the highest increase in debt the last two and a half years.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  No, the shots, not COVID.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  The world's ever seen.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  Vietnam's every month worldwide.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  Vietnam's every six months or so in the U.S.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  Millions and millions and millions and millions of dead people.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  So it sounds negative to announce that, and it is.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  But at least we're not taking it lying down.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  At least it's all coming out.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Absolutely incredible to be living in this day and time
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  and watching all this.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Now, the clip he does is really powerful.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  It's five and a half minutes long.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  So I'm going to play it at the start of the next segment.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]  Who pulls the strings and washes the DC?
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  Matt Gaetz really goes deep.
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  And this is so incredibly important.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  But since I mentioned that, let me go ahead
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  and go over this news because this is big.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  Look at these headlines.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  FDA vaccine committee member calls for end to mass COVID vaccine
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  saying it's not supporting people and children shouldn't take it.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.000]  Now, this is really sophisticated.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  Why did the Spars document that came out two years before they launched this
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  say they would do that by the beginning of the third year of the shot?
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Because they're going to kill a bunch of people and they knew it would kill you.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  Now they've got to act like it was a mistake.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  That doesn't mean everybody that comes out against it in the FDA or the CDC
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  or the NIH is a bad person.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]  They know good people are going to see it and go public.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  Then they just spin the whole thing like it's an accident.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  Go read the Spars document.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  It's only 60 pages long.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  It's got hundreds of links.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  I spent days trying to read those and studies.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  But we knew it was the war plan.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  And General Flynn looked at it after my analysis and said yes.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  That's what the military does.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  And I'm not saying the military ran this, but it's a military style operation.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Is that they have war games, but when they actually launch a war,
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  when they're sitting their operatives out, they've got the war game on them.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  So they get caught.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  Oh, that's just a war game.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  It's not a war game.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]  It's a battle plan.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  In the Spars document alone, there's addendums that are restricted.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  So we don't have the full document.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  They have hundreds of tweets written five years ago,
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000]  two years before they released this stuff,
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  where all they do is change the acronyms and a little bit of the tweet.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  The tweets are 60, 70% the exact same words.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  Where, oh, it's safe and effective.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  You need to take it.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  Okay.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  It's 90% effective.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  It's 80% effective.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  It's 50% effective.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  And then, oh, people start to get mad at industry.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  People find out industry didn't do the test.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  People get mad.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  I mean, they've already wargamed how to roll this out, break the system,
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  discredit the government, implode society.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  It's a plan to make us blame the government and just all kill each other.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Well, we blame the government for being puppets of the globalists,
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  but we go after the globalists.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  And I know I harp on that, but it's happening.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  And thanks to all the great listeners and viewers of this show
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  and all the other wonderful activists, people now know what's going on.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  People understand what's happening.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  And they understand they've already wargamed how you're going to respond.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  But if you're aware of the wargame and how the card game's rigged
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  or how the game is being manipulated, then they can't win.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  And my whole job has been like one of the most hated groups out there
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  in the world, the magicians, is the famous magicians that decide
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  to go ahead and show you how the tricks work.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  But those are more interesting shows, aren't they?
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  They go show you the trick.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  Then in slow motion, they show you how they did the trick.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Those people are so hated by magicians.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  I love those people because it's still cool to see the tricks,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  still cool to see the illusion.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  It's still really interesting to sit there and see your brain fooled
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  and then have somebody go, here's how we fooled you.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  That's what I do.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  That's what my guests do.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  That's our whole goal is to get you to start noticing how the tricks work.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  And so you're not just going to be sitting there having them bombard you,
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  having them brainwash you, have them control you.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  We're giving you the cheat sheet.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  We're giving you, and you're as smart as I am.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  Once you figure this out, you'll see stuff we didn't see.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]  You'll catch things we didn't catch.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  The best thing I do is check the M4's email.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  I don't have an M4's email because I got too many of them.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  I got rid of it over a decade ago, but I get into the M4's email.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  I have them print me hundreds of them a day.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  And just the cool stuff you say, the comments on the website,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  the comments elsewhere, I mean, it's so thought provoking how smart you are.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  And by the way, I'm not patronizing you.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  I learned so much from comments on YouTube, so much from comments on M4's,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  so much from comments on Bandai Video.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  I learned so much from letters we get in the mail.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  We're all sitting here with hundreds of letters trying to read them each week,
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  and I don't get to them all every time.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  I'm not going to lie to you, but man, the stuff you say, the insights you have,
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  you're leaders, you understand what's going on, and you could be white,
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  you could be black, you could be brown, it doesn't matter.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  You want freedom, you got red blood, and you see through this, so it's so exciting.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  So the Matt Gaetz clip is coming up, and then your phone calls straight ahead
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  at 877-789-2539.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  And remember, we have the new URL, they haven't blocked it yet,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  to share the symbol right to the show, conspiracyfact.info, conspiracyfact.info,
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  conspiracyfact.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is your last chance to get a historic signed copy
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  of my number one best-selling book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  exclusively available at infowarstore.com.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Yes, you can get the book in stores, you can find it online,
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  but if you want to get a historic signed copy and be part of our fundraiser
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  to stay on air, go to infowarstore.com and go to the book section

[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000]  There are only about a thousand of these left, and when they're gone, they're gone.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  I'm never going to sign the book again.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  We have a little limited edition thing coming out later, there's a piece of art
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  that goes with the book, but I haven't even decided what I'm going to do that,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  it may never happen.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  But for just simple, straight-up signed books, and to be part of this fundraiser,
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  this is the last time you'll be able to get the signed book at infowarstore.com.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  I thank you all for your support.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000]  Please go to infowarstore.com and get your signed book today,
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  and I thank you for keeping us in the fight against the globalists.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  Introducing our new incredible supplement line, InfoWars MD.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  Now, in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are,
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000]  for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000]  These are high-end, these are the very best.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  You know our body's Ultimate Turmeric formula is amazing?
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  Well, guess what?
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at infowarstore.com.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  The highest quality, directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to 50%,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  in some cases 100% lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:13.000]  InfoWars MD at infowarstore.com.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus

[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000]  And we've got some other great sleep eggs as well and they're excellent. They're all different formulas.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  So John and Al sold out for more than five months.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  Now back available at infowarstore.com.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  So get better, deeper rest, boost your immune system, and support the infowar with Gavin Out sleep support at infowarstore.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:10.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  We just got to get conscious of the enemy programs.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]  And then it's over for them.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:34.000]  We can outthink them, we can defeat them, but they program us.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  Do the same things over and over again, and they get in these ruts where we can't wake up, we can't come together,
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000]  and we can't recognize who they are and stop them.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:50.000]  They believe you're jumped, they believe you're garbage, they believe you're going to roll over and die.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  Are you really going to do that? Are you going to promote the link, conspiracyfact.info?
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  And I'm going to give you a few tricks to get around the sensors here.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  I love the crew, they're great.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  I told them last week before we prepared this, I said, the image we send around to all of the guests they're going to come on,
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]  they're going to promote the show, and to let's just promote, should not have my face on it.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  They use AI to see my face, and they block it on Instagram and Twitter and everywhere.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  The promo has my face on it, and it's okay.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000]  Maybe if I talk about it on air, it won't.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000]  Everybody can create their own images to promote the show.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000]  Just say forbidden information is being discussed live right now.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000]  Follow this link and share this link, conspiracyfact.info.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  Don't put my face on it, don't put my name on it.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  We've done tests with Twitter accounts we work with where they get millions of views,
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:47.000]  routinely hundreds of thousands, but all the time millions,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:53.000]  because we don't put Alex Jones in the thumbnail or Alex Jones' name on it.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000]  If I sit there and I tell everybody that, we can beat the frickin' AI.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  It ain't that smart.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  But we have to promote, and that's why what they really can't stop is the fact that everybody's duplicating my research information,
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  which I want, whether it's Dr. Robert Malone or you name it.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]  Everybody gets some right now, everybody knows I've done their research, our guests have done their research,
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  so everybody just takes our research now and does their own shows and does their own research on top of it
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  and makes it even more informative, and that's great.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  And I'm almost to the point of being obsolete, because so many people are going to be awake,
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  so many people are going to get the information, and then I can bow out.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  And that's my goal.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  My goal is to disappear, but it's not this year, it's not next year, the fight is now,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:44.000]  and our work is too important, it's too influential right now with everything we do.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Right now, everything we do is having a bigger ripple effect ever in its history.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  And so we're going to stay on air under massive attack at the most critical point to keep our information going forward,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000]  but we can't do it without your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]  Go to inforwardshore.com right now, please make a donation, get some of the great supplements,
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.000]  get a signed copy or an unsigned copy of my book, but whatever you do, take action.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:15.000]  And as listeners, when you promote the show, don't say Alex Jones, say, hey, here's forbidden information on this topic,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  it's really powerful, I think you should check it out, and send it to the URL, they're not blocking conspiracyfact.info.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.000]  Then they'll block that, we'll give you a new URL.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  This is a war, it's not a game, but games operate the same, so you learn from each move.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000]  Here's Matt Gaetz on Tim Pool, who really pulls the strings in Washington D.C.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:45.000]  If you're part of the prevailing way of thinking, the national security state, the neoconservative worldview,
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  there's an entire infrastructure there to build out your career, there are endowed professorships,
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  there are think tanks that are ready to give you six-figure jobs, there's a career progression of jobs on the hill,
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  but if you think differently, you're kind of hunted, you're hunted, canceled, they do everything to compromise you,
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  and if that doesn't work, they try to destroy you.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  There's a lot of compromise, especially in Washington D.C., but how deep does the rabbit hole goal go?
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  There's a lot of people talking about the deep state, the intelligence agencies having a lot of control,
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  using a lot of extortion, special interest groups pulling the strings here.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  What's your understanding of how things really work in Washington D.C. compared to what the average American kind of sees?
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  Well, I think the most corrupt foray into this is freshman orientation,
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  because you show up here, and imagine showing up from northwest Arkansas, from southern Mississippi,
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.000]  and you see the architecture of D.C., they take you out to the finest steakhouse, the best wine you've ever had,
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  and co-located at your table are the lobbyists for the major special interests for the committees that you're interested that you want to serve on.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  So I get here and they're like, oh, Gates, you want to be on the Armed Services Committee, have you met these defense contractors?
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  These are the key lobbyists that round up the defense money, and they put you with them from the very beginning,
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  and you sort of get the joke that if you give your vote card to the leadership and your calendar to the lobby corps,
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:16.000]  you just kind of get enveloped into a system that's there to nurture you and protect you and keep you out of harm's way,
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  and all it costs you is your own belief set.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  And I don't think that's compromised so much as selling out.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  So that is step one, and that catches a whole lot of the people who get here.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  And then beyond that, if you kind of resist that system, then they do try to extort you, engage in anything they can do to compromise you,
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:46.000]  cancel you, find some joke that you liked on Instagram years ago that doesn't fit with the mores at this time,
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  find some email that you were on the forward chain of that's like some basis to say that you're a white supremacist,
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  or you're some sort of unacceptable human that can't be in polite company,
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  and then if that doesn't work, it's abject destruction through the political process where there are many, many dollars lined up
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  solely for the extermination of those who push back against the narrative.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  Yeah, this is detailed extensively in books like The Economic Hitman that I think are definitely worth reading and checking out here.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  But talking to previous members of Congress, it's really kind of daunting to see what they have to go through,
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  how much pressure they have to go through, how much agreement they have to agree to before even getting into some of those positions of power.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  Well, in the duke, it's money. I mean, there's specific dollar amounts.
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  I mean, I remember going in and saying, well, I want to be on the Armed Services Committee,
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  and someone looked me dead in the eye and said, well, that'll be $75,000 that you owe to the leadership funds
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  and to the Republican Congressional Committee.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  Wow.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  And so, you know, I go home and think, well, you know, part of you wants to say, screw you, or like, are you wearing a wire?
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  Yeah, if I could ask you, and again, you don't have to answer this,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  but who do you think is more influential and powerful in Washington DC, the lobbyists, or the intelligence agencies?
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  Well, I mean, the answer to the question is yes, they're one and the same.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Because oftentimes, they are fused with precisely the same personnel,
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:20.000]  where people will roll out of DOJ and end up at, you know, the law firm that services the lobby core and the very same clients.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  I mean, there's no better example of the fusion of that than when I learned through a whistleblower
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  that the Perkins-Cooley law firm, which is the legal wing of the Democratic Party,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  has within it a secure information facility that is run by the FBI.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  So they literally have a place in their law firm where they can try to convert political dirt into intelligence investigations,
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  counterintelligence investigations, criminal investigations, and the like.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Yeah, and let's not forget all the Epstein tapes that they have today.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  And it's up and running today.
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  Yeah, it's up and running today.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  And they have all the Epstein tapes too, but that's another thing.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  Do you have any hope in the Jim Jordan new committee when it comes to investigating the weaponization of government?
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000]  Do you think that's going to be akin to maybe a church committee?
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  Yeah, that's our objective.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  And the specific agreement we have with McCarthy is that that select committee will have the budget, resources, personnel,
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  no less than the Democrats' January 6th committee.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  Well, what do you think? Do you think it'll work out?
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  Look, it's hard to promise outcomes when we don't have the ability to throw handcuffs on anybody or put anybody in jail, right?
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  All we can do is expose facts.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.000]  And so it relies on other features of our system to kind of go end to end on that accountability.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:46.000]  And so I don't want to promise people like, yeah, you know, you're going to see Hunter Biden hauled off in cuffs.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  You're going to see the Joe Biden University of Penn, like China money laundering stuff.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  And, you know, because that may be out there, but it may not result in precisely what people would hope.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  What have you had the plans to the Death Star?
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  What have you knew the globalist operations that could stop it?
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  Well, we've done the research. We have the number one best-selling book in the country, not just in politics, but period.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000]  It's the great reset over the world.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.000]  You get a signed copy of this, the last 1400, keep Info Wars on the air.

[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:44.000]  We also have unsigned copies as well, but signed copies are limited and are about to run out.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  Thank you for your support. Again, get yours at infowarstore.com.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  I am asking you from the bottom of my heart to commit even harder to the support you've given to this fight

[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:41.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's. You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:46.000]  When you decide to take action, we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:54.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support them for the real reason you have the success.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon and that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them. God bless you all.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:54.000]  I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:33:12.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  I've got hundreds of huge stories. I'm going to write down briefly and then go right to Jeff and Mark and Michael and Dave and Brent and Clem and Ken and Jeremiah and Ben and Carol and others.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  But I want to just clarify what I was complaining about last segment and I'm not mad at the crew. It's just we're up against AI.
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:52.000]  I said, hey, for the promo and what we're going to send out as a promo image, we don't want an image of me and we don't want my name on it.
[01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  We just say Alex is right and Alex Jones is right because the AIC is that and blocks it on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, everything.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:08.000]  And then people started trying to promote the image that pops up, not on the site, but the image that feeds when you send the link out.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:14.000]  And what does Instagram do? Here it is. It's just got sent to us. We checked it. It's happening.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  Info wars red alert put out a link to conspiracy fact on info. That's conspiracy fact on info. It's on screen of your TV viewer.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:32.000]  And they said false information. The same information was reviewed by independent fact checkers. Deep State CIA.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:36.000]  The same information was reviewed by independent ADL fact checkers. Yeah.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  It actually says the same information was reviewed by independent fact checkers in another post. See why?
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  And they divert you over here to hear how I'm a big liar. All it is is a page saying our free speech is under attack.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000]  We're doing a marathon broadcast tomorrow. Everybody, you know, tune in and they tell you that's false information.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  No, they're the ones that lie on purpose. And it's because the AI sees my face.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  It sees my name. So we're going to put an image on the page conspiracy fact on info that doesn't have my face or info wars on it.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  You can say forbidden information is happening right now that will affect the future of the world. Please tune in until others share this link and tell them to share it and tell them to share it.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  See, it's them. Tell them, tell them, tell them, tell everybody that shares it, tell them to share it. And that is what human power can do to override the algorithm.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  Now, let me give you some of the news we've got here and then I'll go to your calls.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  I've been critical of Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, because he'll send some National Guard down with guns standing there.
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  It's a photo op and they have no power because the federal government's there with NGOs, the UN taking the illegals and shipping them all over the country.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  So all our military does, whether it's the feds that send them or whether it's a governor that sends them on the border, is direct the people into the United States.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  You have to go after the UN NGOs that Biden two years ago put in charge of it. That's completely illegal. We've done whole shows on that.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  And finally, the governor's opened a criminal investigation in Texas into the NGOs. Yes, that's the answer.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  But here's the story just now breaking out of Town Hall. Now, listen to this.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  Biden's DHS launches app allowing illegal migrants to make appointments to cross over into the U.S.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  So instead of rushing across and drowning in the river, because you're just going to be taken and let in, now all the border patrol is, as I've said for two years, we've been down there countless times, we've shown you,
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  our people to load them on buses, trains and planes and vans and cars to be shipped all over the country to be given new identities and signed up in sweatshops and signed up to work as slaves.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  And the Democrats take the money out the top and sign them up for welfare. That's what's going on.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  And finally Breitbart gets it. Finally, people are reporting on this. And that's so frustrating. I don't want to be the one always breaking this.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  I want to be made obsolete. I don't want to have the responsibility to work seven days a week fighting this.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  I want to see people realize what's going on and get involved.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  Biden's Department of Homeland Security launched a mobile app that allows illegal immigrants to schedule appointments at the border while they're turned to come into the country.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:50.000]  The DHS new component of the Customs and Border Patrol Protection, one app, will encourage even more crime, drugs and sex traffickers in the U.S.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  All that you do on the app is schedule an appointment to meet with the CPP agents of the U.S. Border Patrol.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  And you can be a man with three kids, no IDs needed, you're let in.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  But Homeland Security is watching and controlling you.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  So when you see the photo ops, I had some friends and family in town here today. They wanted to see the Texas Capitol.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  So we went down there and they had all these guys with assault rifles standing around guarding it.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  And it was all just theater for the governor's inauguration, as if terrorists are going to attack.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  So look, the government's powerful. They've got guns. And really, all the Border Patrol and all the military do is drive around picking up illegals that pour across these neighborhoods.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  By the way, this very neighborhood you're seeing, I've been in that one on the border.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  And that's all they do is pick them up and deliver them to where they're going.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:56.000]  And now they're telling them, stop running. We'll just let you in.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  We don't want politically incorrect footage of guys on horseback grabbing Haitians.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  Just come here. The border is open. Let's be honest. It's open. That's the policy. It's illegal.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  It's allowing human trafficking. It needs to stop. The impeachment of Joe Biden should begin.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  But they don't want an impeachment. Oh, Joe Biden is being a shiny spy or opening the borders or doing all these real issues.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  They want to make it about some documents so they can get him out of the way for Big Mike, Michelle Obama.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  All right, without further ado, let's start going to your phone calls. Let's talk to Jeff in Illinois. Jeff, thanks for holding your on the air.
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:38.000]  Alex, thank you so much for taking my call.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  I am a baby to Info Wars, and I'm calling because I want you to know the impact that you have on your listeners.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  I didn't know you existed until about four weeks ago. I consumed my information through the likes of Sean Hannity, Dan Bongino, and Tucker Carlson.
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  Somebody must have mentioned your name, and out of curiosity, I went online and I found you and I found Info Wars.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  And I started watching, and I'll be honest, the first couple of days I watched you, I thought you were crazy.
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  But you were so convicted in what you were saying, and your presentation is so compelling.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:22.000]  And then you started playing videos, and the camera is zooming down onto your desk, and you're seeing articles, you're showing articles, you're backing up everything that you're saying.
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  And so I continued to watch, and I will never forget the day that you red-pilled me was when you played the clip from the X-Files,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  and my jaw hit the floor, and suddenly I was Neo waking up on the other caneser, realizing that everything I thought I knew, I didn't.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  And so now I watch you every day, I watch repeats of you every day.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  I've sent links to friends and family. Last week was the first time I received my first shipment from InfoWarsStork.com.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  And so I'm hooked, and I want to finish with this. I know you like to keep these concise.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:41:03.000]  We as listeners cannot imagine the spirit of oppression at times that must be on you, the weight that you carry on your shoulders.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  You're a cross between John the Baptist and Paul Revere trying to warn all of us, and I'm sure that it's exhausting at times.
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:20.000]  And I want you to know that for me personally, I'm somebody whose eyes you opened, whose heart that you touched, and whose mind that you've awakened.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  I pray that God blesses you, and that God blesses InfoWars. Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  Well, don't hang up, because we've got another minute to break, and I'm going to finish with the other callers next segment.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  But listen, what's exhausting is I know the next part of their plan. More bioweapon releases, more control, totally collapsed borders.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  I have children. I am literally desperate to stop this, because we're all in this together. But I appreciate your support.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  But once people know the truth, Jeff, they can't do anything but fight. And I get it. The truth is crazy.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  They had a $15 million new Martin Luther King sculpture that's a giant 80-foot penis.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  I mean, who could make... It sounds insane till you go see it. It's like it sounds insane.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  They have convicted pedophiles running drag queen storytime funded by Disney, but it's happening.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  And absolutely, that X-Files thing that Chris Carter put out in 2016, where it describes the whole virus release, the lockdowns,
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  it erasing our immune system, I didn't realize how important that was at the time,
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  even though Chris Carter said it was based on my show, influenced by my show, and the character that was saying it was based on me.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  I didn't get what he was getting from my show and how powerful it was. So you're not the only one waking up.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Thank you, brother. I really appreciate your call.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:40.000]  All right, we're going to come back with more calls. I've gotten to one call. I get started slow.
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:46.000]  I'll take five calls next segment straight ahead. But yes, we've had too big an effect.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  I'm exhausted. I want to give up. I want to go off air, but I have a responsibility not to.
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:43:06.000]  So please spread the word and please support us and we'll never give up.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  We have Lobito RX, Better Mood, Nitric Boost, Mushroom Max, Powerful Neutropic, Ageless Vitality Collagen, Super Food Greens, and more.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  Our turmeric formula is 95% of humanoid, the strongest and best on the market.
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000]  These formulas and more under the Infowars MD banner are at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  They are private labeled clones of the top brands in the country for up to 50% off where you're going to find them in stores and other online stores.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:44:17.000]  This is our new Infowars MD Incredible Line.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:29.000]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan, and they've given us this huge deal off of retail, 40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  And not just under one name, they sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:41.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:48.000]  We're talking about Pain MD, we're talking about HGH Max Boost, we're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000]  These things are incredible.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:56.000]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less what you first do and consult your healthcare provider because they're so powerful.
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000]  Get them at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000]  I want you to remember two words.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  Infowars Platinum.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:07.000]  In the history of Infowars supplements and they're amazing.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  This is hands down the most powerful game changing products we've ever offered to the public.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national best sellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high end supplements and the owners are listeners and a supporter.
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:34.000]  So they're giving them to us at 40% off what they're sold on stores, over 20% off what they're sold online under the Infowars Platinum brand name.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  These are incredible.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  Pain MD, HGH Max Boost and of course 1776 testosterone boost.

[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  Infowars Platinum now available at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:35.000]  But you can take that information and cause a bigger ripple effect, an amplifying effect and make sure it gets out to your friends, your family, your neighbors and perfect strangers.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000]  You are what takes our information and amplifies it.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.000]  When you decide to take action we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:55.000]  So I thank you all for your past action and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:47:02.000]  We're in a fight to not just educate those that are already away but to reach out to other people. That's the war.
[01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:25.000]  Michael in New York, thanks for holding. You're on the air. Welcome.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  I just wanted to talk about all the carnage I'm seeing from the shots personally.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  My stepmom got diagnosed with cancer. My brother's mother in law got cancer.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:45.000]  I finally got some radiation burns but he just can't put two and two together. He's on five shots.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  I'm watching all these different things happen. I'm watching the fiber blood clots.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:58.000]  Then when Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was a diagnostic system, I did some research.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  I looked up and sure enough the mRNA came up as radio labeled.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:11.000]  The definition, any substance bound to a radio, any material bound to a radioactive substance.
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  All these symptoms that we're seeing, the myocarditis, is right on par with radiation sickness.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  That's what they did. This was to get their big AI program started, to get all the data from all the athletes.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:34.000]  Essentially, you could 3D print a cyborg and all they would need is a chip, which they're doing right now with the data harvesting.
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  This is the end of humanity as we know it and we need to really realize this and start treating people for radiation sickness.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  Let me stand on that. This is definitely a forced evolutionary takeover.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  It's going to kill most people in their own words. I played Clips last hour and earlier this hour.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  You're absolutely right. I focus on the myocarditis and the heart attacks because that's the most obvious.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  The cancers and remissions and other cancers exploding is bigger than the heart attacks.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000]  This is definitely like miracle growth for cancer.
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  If you look at it, it's radiation poisoning. All you have to do is look up mRNA radio-labeled.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  If you go back to the 1950s, the original use was to study how amoebas correlated with the DNA.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  From the whole gecko, there was always a diagnostic system using radiation.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  It was always radio-labeled, which means that...
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  Sure, they put the trace elements in you. They used 5G and other systems to scan what's going on.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  It's not just Netanyahu admitting he turned all his Rayleigh's into guinea pigs.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  I played Clips earlier where the WF says we're testing on everybody now. We don't test on animals.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  We test on you. How damn criminal is that?
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.000]  It's really unbelievable, but we have a chance right now if we get out into the public that this is Rayleigh.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000]  I agree with you. What do you think of all the people coming out against him and the board saying they were lied to?
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  Looks like a lot of people are turning against the system inside the system.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000]  We can't get caught up in anything right now other than treating people.
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  We have a chance to expose this, and if it is radiation thickness, there is a way to treat people.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  We can save billions of people. If not, we are in big trouble.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  I appreciate your call, Michael.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  What you're saying is the metal compounds that cause chain reactions, the graphene oxide, you're saying is resonating, and we know what studies it does.
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  I don't know. Overall, I'd say that's causing the sickness. It's a spike protein, but definitely this is a major test that they've well tested out,
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.000]  and they know it's poisonous and it's out of control. Brent in Illinois, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call. I'm a listener and supporter of InfoWars. I'd like to encourage everybody.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:57.000]  Thank you, but back off your phone or get closer. Something's happening.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000]  Can you hear me better, Alex?
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  I can. Go ahead.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  Okay, so I'd like to encourage everybody to buy your products at infowars.com, and thank you for everything you do.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  I'm getting ready to have my first child with an amazing woman. She's due next month, and I'm a little concerned about what the doctors might try to pump into her.
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  I didn't know if you had any advice. If there's anything I need to avoid, just any advice you could give me would be great, Alex.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  Well, I'm on a doctor, but a lot of women have issues because of lack of iodine, lack of trace elements and minerals, and obviously just find a hospital that's highly rated by the Liberty Movement for not trying to force shots.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  Let the doctors know you're informed up front. I would not go to a city hospital or any of the biggest hospitals in your area. That's going to have to be your own research.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  But they're trying to push these shots on pregnant women, but the worms already turn to just say, look, I know nobody's taking it. I know there's a huge backlash, so stop thinking I'm stupid.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  Move on to the next person. But if they're pushing shots on your wife, or, you know, six, seven, eight mammograms, or excuse me, sonograms, she only needs maybe one or two towards the end, I would not go to a hospital that's doing that.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:23.000]  Okay, I appreciate that. I didn't know if there was any kind of vaccine they're going to try to give the child after she's born.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  But listen, up to half their patients aren't taking the shots. They'll act like you got five heads and you're a weirdo, just say, we're not taking any of these shots.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:46.000]  And they go, oh, the hepatitis we recommend, only if an intravenous drug user having anal sex, why would a baby need the dangerous hepatitis shot? Say, we're not taking any of the shots and don't act like you're intimidated and just say no, there's no law, they can't do it.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  So I can say I don't want any of the shots then.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  There's no law, sir, they can make them take the shots.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:56.000]  Okay.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000]  Okay, Alex, I appreciate you taking my call. Thank you.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  I appreciate you, brother. It's a big deal to have a baby coming and I'm honored you called. Ben in Massachusetts, you're on the air.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing? I love you, brother.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  All right, brother, love you too. What's up?
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  I just wanted to bring up a couple topics. I remember catching you back on conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  And I remember hearing your voice and I was like, who is this guy? And, you know, and that's when I started listening to you and I found Info Wars and all that.
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  But I remember even on Beaver's in the Butt Head, you'd always say infowars.com and I was like a little kid, I was born in 88, you know?
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  But anyhow, I've been listening to you for a long time and get the products.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:57.000]  Spider-Man Real Fusion is great. And I want to mention that I like to promote a bunch of things on my like Facebook and whatnot.
[01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:02.000]  And I've gotten like 400, 200, 300 views.
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000]  That's huge. Because everybody doing that together reaches millions. Beautiful.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000]  Yep.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:14.000]  Well, tell me where the Beaver's in the Butt Head comes from. I'm friends with Mike Judge, known him for, gosh, well, more than a decade now.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:20.000]  And he's done interviews and interviewed us, but otherwise he does the Beavis in Butt Head voices of infowars.com.
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  Beavis. And so, yeah, that's really fun that he does that.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  And I just had one question for you about a month ago.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:41.000]  So me and my niece, we're looking up at the stars, you know, in the sky and, you know, nice clear night and we see a bunch of drones.
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  I mean, not like four or five. I mean, like 18, 20, 20 to 30.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  Yeah, there's massive satellites, lower satellites, drones. It's just a massive program.
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  So I called the, I called the police.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:01.000]  I had the cops come down and they barely did anything like, oh, we'll take a look around.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  And so do you think that has anything to do with like the Chinese garbage going on with the scan this to go here?
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  It sounds like the cops know what they're doing. This is the cops brought that up.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  No, no, no, no, but like that's what I'm thinking, like they're setting it up right now.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:24.000]  Well, it's not just the Chinese, brother. It's a total robot takeover. Ben, thanks for the support. God bless you.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:28.000]  Clem in Colorado, you're on the air.
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:29.000]  Hello, Alan.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Thanks for taking my call. I'll make this quick.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  I think that we should accelerate the death of a new role order by exposing their controllers.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  Charles Boudelaire wrote in his book, Quakerism, Quakerism Exam.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000]  And one of the artifices of Satan is to induce men to believe that he doesn't exist.
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  So I've been researching who their controllers are and it's these entities.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  I've called before they're known as the Veylon, but the Anunnaki primarily control the Democratic Party in the deep state.
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  The Junda control the globalists, all the technocrats, and the Hathor control all these spiritual gurus of the new age.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  But them, like, triangulate, and they're the ones who are bringing about this whole world plan because they want the world for themselves.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.000]  They see themselves as God's chosen people, which is absurd.
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  But I think once you call them out by name, you'll have them because, yeah, we can try all these globalists and hang them, but we still got to deal with these entities.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000]  And it's good to know them by name and their patterns.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]  But I'll leave it at that.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:46.000]  There's no doubt the globalists believe they're in contact with other earthly creatures.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  There's no doubt that we're on a planet in the middle of all this.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:50.000]  There's a lot of weirdness going on.
[01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:54.000]  But God overpowers all of that and we have connection to God.
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:02.000]  We have a spiritual, electromagnetic, chemical, next dimensional connection to God, and we can't beat this without God.
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  We just say, God direct us, guide us.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  We have free will.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  Ask us to do what we should do.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Tell us what we should do.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Free will.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  Lead God and direct us.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  And I think that really is what it comes down to.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  We're going to start our number three with Jeremiah and many others.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  Carol, you name it.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  On the other side of this break, our number three is about to take place.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  And then later in the hour, a special guest from Davos in Switzerland.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  So that's all coming up in the third hour.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000]  That's only two minutes away.
[01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  Check out the new website, Conspiracy Fact.info and share it.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  American Revolution is happening right now against the New World Order.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:58.000]  And the answer to their 1984 tyranny is the 1776 mindset.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.000]  And Info Wars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  Now, in the last year, we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins.
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:18.000]  When you buy the coin, you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical momento so you can remember the great contribution you make to freedom.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:31.000]  Now, despite the fact that the coins are selling out, the last of the four coins series, Teddy Roosevelt Man the Arena, we're offering it for $30 off right now while supplies last at 1776coin.com.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:39.000]  And just like an NPR pledge drive where they mark up a coffee cup or a T-shirt or a DVD, 300%, that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  But despite that, we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain. Please go to 1776coin.com right now.
[01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:15.000]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front, but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  So please keep me on the field. Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time that will empower you and your family.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  InfoWarsStore.com for the best supplements and more, or just make a straight donation, Big Red Man at the top of InfoWarsStore.com, and that way all the money goes towards the fight, not part of it going towards product cost.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  But I thank you all for your support. Please commit now to go to InfoWarsStore.com, get great products, and make donations.
[01:59:40.000 --> 02:00:07.000]  Thank you for your support. Now take action. The globalists are counting on you, not taking action.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:37.000]  Well, incredible things are happening. Humanity is waking up in the globalist tyranny. They're not all powerful. There is a fight going on this planet for the future of our species.
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  But I wanted to play a clip of an autistic man in a restaurant coffee shop, literally under mind control with a six feet separation, and the people that are there.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:55.000]  We make fun of this guy, but the general public that's under its control are basically in the same position.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  Then we have a BBC News top cardiologist that advises the government talking about what's really causing the increases in heart attacks.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  It's not the lack of the public taking statins. They want to give kids statins down the UK because heart attacks are exploding. Here's both clips back to back.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:45.000]  You're asking that you need to go home.
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  You're asking that you need to go home.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  What is almost certainly, if you allow me to say this, my own research has found.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  This is something that is probably a likely contributing factor is that the COVID mRNA vaccines do carry a cardiovascular risk.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  And I've actually called for the suspension of this pending an inquiry because there's a lot of uncertainty at the moment about what's causing the excess deaths.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  Some of it will be ambulance delays. My own father was reported on BBC News in late 2021.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  I was the first to actually highlight the ambulance delays because my own father suffered a cardiac arrest at home and the ambulance took 30 minutes.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  And when his postmortem came out, he had very severe coronary artery disease, which is unexplainable.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  I then published in a peer review journal. They accepted my findings that the likely cause of his death was two doses of the Pfizer mRNA vaccine he had six months earlier.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  So I just want to jump in on that point.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  So what you're saying in terms of the mRNA link to cardiovascular risk is that that is a proven it's been proven medically.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  Has it scientifically? Yeah. Yeah.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  So in medicine, you know, in any research that we do, it's very difficult to always be absolutely conclusive.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  So we go on like this and there are lots of data now.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000]  The highest quality data is what we call randomized controlled trial evidence.
[02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  So there was a reanalysis in the journal vaccine published recently where they found that the original trials of Pfizer and Moderna with mRNA vaccines showed.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  And I just want to put this in absolute terms because we don't want to scare people unnecessarily.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  But the absolute risk of serious adverse events was at least one in eight hundred.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  OK. And a lot of those are cardiovascular.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:21.000]  And then you were more likely in those trials to suffer a serious adverse event than to be hospitalized with COVID early on.
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  And I think the vaccine has certainly helped people who are high risk.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.000]  But now we should be reassured that Omicron and what's circulating is really no worse than the flu.
[02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  And this is really time to pause the vaccine rollout and to really investigate this properly.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  OK. So I just want to clarify one one point here is that is using statins a cheaper, less resistant but short sighted approach to the risk.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:59.000]  Yeah. I think you've summed it up perfectly.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:05.000]  In early twenty twenty two, Info Wars launched a very important fundraiser that kept us on air.
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  Your support of that fundraiser is the reason we are still here today fighting the globalist and having incredibly successful results.
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  So I thank you for your passing support.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:19.000]  Now that was a three coin series, the founding member coin.
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:33.000]  The final coin that we're putting out for a long time is the Teddy Roosevelt man in the arena coin exclusively available at seventeen seventy six coin dot com.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  There are only a few thousand of the coins left.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000]  And yes, there's a markup on the coins because that's why it's a fundraiser.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:45.000]  The coin is a collector's item, a memento of your support during the Second American Revolution.
[02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:57.000]  So if you want to get one of these coins, they're going fast and you can get thirty dollars off on the coin with promo code seventeen seventy six at seventeen seventy six coin dot com.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:16.000]  Thanks for keeping us on the air crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:27.000]  Ezra Levant of Rebel Media is in Davos, Switzerland, and he's going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour right now. We're taking your phone calls.
[02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  I have a clip to start the next segment of play of Shirley Temple in nineteen eighty eight or the most famous child actresses ever about the most famous talking about a casting call.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:47.000]  They tried to have sex whether she was twelve years old and Larry King laughs about it like it's funny, but I get he's uncomfortable.
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  I can't judge the heart, but this is how long this demonization these demonic operations have been taking place and how long this dehumanization has been taking place.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  But right now let's ram through more calls.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  Jeremiah in California, you're on next.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  Go ahead.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:15.000]  Good morning, Alex. I'm super stoked to be on just my multivitamins, my red pill plus the vitamin D3.
[02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:18.000]  I live in the basketball California.
[02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:21.000]  I didn't hang up on you, Jeremiah. Are you there?
[02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000]  I'm here.
[02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000]  You know what just happened?
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:25.000]  My headset just cut out.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  That wasn't you.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:27.000]  I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:28.000]  My headset just dropped.
[02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000]  Start over.
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:40.000]  All right. I just took my multivitamins, my vitamin D3. I got the red pill plus the DNA four plus and I live in the basketball California.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:52.000]  It's like 35 minutes from like the Bohemian Grove, you know, and I'm probably one of the only people in the basketball that just rock in the infowars shirts and hats like on a daily basis.
[02:07:52.000 --> 02:08:05.000]  And I'm super stoked to make it through, to call us to you first time and your trial when, when you took the fifth, it reminds me of this documentary about Benjamin Franklin put out like 20 years ago.
[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  He goes to England, they put him on trial to make fun of him and all that.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:11.000]  And he doesn't say anything.
[02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:17.000]  He comes back and that's the pivotal point where he becomes a revolutionary, solid person.
[02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:31.000]  And it just reminds me of your trial, you know, and also something else he said was if we can make whatever we need and whatever else the imports, you know, we don't need it.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000]  And so it's like that's it.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  What happened in those show trials was the judge already found me guilty.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  And then she said, if you say you're innocent, I will hold you in contempt.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  You can't even do that.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:46.000]  So I said, well, she said like a list of 20 things I couldn't say so that I couldn't answer the questions.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  Like, like, like the other side's lawyer would say, you're in bankruptcy.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000]  She gave an order that I'd serve six months in jail.
[02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  And I said, I was in bankruptcy.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000]  So I said, I can't answer the question.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  She sent the jury out and said, good job.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:08:59.000]  You're right.
[02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000]  You can't ask that.
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000]  Since when can you not say you're innocent?
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000]  Since when can you not answer questions?
[02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:10.000]  It's a joke, but they're all seeing how far they can go because no one's standing up against them.
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:18.000]  And when I first I started listening to your show, I just just I heard a co-worker mention a male.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.000]  He's a genius.
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:28.000]  And I just heard you on the radio just driving around bioseptic pros, you know, and I was like, yeah, this is once I really started listening to the show after the commercial.
[02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:33.000]  I was like, oh, man, you know, I listen to all the stuff on Facebook and Twitter and all that.
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.000]  And, you know, Charlie Kirk and all the other good, good patriots out there.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000]  But as soon as I started listening to you, I was like, hey, he goes way, way deeper.
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:49.000]  And my cousin showed me you, you like around like, because when you exposed the bio bohemian, you know, that blew back in the day.
[02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:57.000]  So what happens to you there in Northern California, beautiful area around Monterey, just west of Santa Rosa?
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:10:01.000]  What happens to you when you wear the info or shirt?
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000]  I get more hate for the Trump stuff.
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:12.000]  Like when I wear my Trump one shirt, like I people either don't know when info wars is or they do, you know, either laugh or they don't know.
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  Got it.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  You wear your Trump stuff.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000]  All right, brother, keep it up.
[02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000]  We love you.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000]  We're going to stand strong.
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  Thank you.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  David Colorado, you're on the air.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  Go ahead.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000]  Hi, Alex.
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000]  I can't go ahead.
[02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:26.000]  Excellent.
[02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  Alex, I haven't talked with you since about 2007, but you did have me on your show a couple of times.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  I worked for the Smithsonian.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:38.000]  I'm a professional anthropologist, archaeologist.
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000]  I started out working in the Andes in the mid 70s.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  Well, remind us who you are.
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  I'm going to read a lot of folks.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  Tell me who you are.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000]  Well, my name's Dave.
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  Is it okay if I use my last name?
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.000]  Yeah, sure.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  Go ahead.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000]  My name's Dave Edwards.
[02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  I was teaching at the University of Maryland and working at the Smithsonian.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:06.000]  You wanted me to talk about, you know, many years ago, how when I was recruited by the
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:15.000]  DIA and I refused to work with them, they did several attempts on my life and I had to
[02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:20.000]  run out here where I am now, out in the Boonies in southwestern Colorado.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000]  Anyway, so that's who I am.
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:28.000]  The reason why I called today, and it was really kind of amazing because it was a really
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:35.000]  amazing because I said a prayer and I got through and I was shocked.
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  And then I got cut off and then I dialed again and said a prayer and I got through again.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.000]  And so it's a real miracle.
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000]  It's hard to get through.
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000]  We have thousands of people trying to call.
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  So what's on your mind here?
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  What about climate change in the churches?
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000]  Okay.
[02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000]  So what I wanted to bring up, I keep thinking about this over and over again, especially
[02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:06.080]  as they're going green with this bullshit agenda, is, you know, Richard Hogan did incredible
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:12.400]  work demonstrating that all the planets in the solar system are heating up.
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:20.360]  And it has to do with the twin star, Alpha Centauri, and our star, our sun, starting
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:26.400]  to get so close to each other that it's really exponentially increasing the amount of heat
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:28.400]  that's coming from both.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:33.640]  Anyway, so I've done a considerable amount of research about that.
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:37.560]  Well, it is true that the solar system was heating up to about five years ago.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:38.560]  Now it's basically stopped.
[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.560]  I mean, you're right.
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:45.280]  The peak was five, six years ago and the sun is the main driver of our climate.
[02:12:45.280 --> 02:12:50.760]  And so it really has very little or nothing to do with fossil fuels.
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:53.720]  And so they obviously know that.
[02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:54.720]  And look, I have a graph.
[02:12:54.720 --> 02:12:55.720]  I gave the crew.
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:57.280]  I mean, let me find it here.
[02:12:57.280 --> 02:12:58.280]  It was on zero heads.
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:01.640]  It was like, this is the most important video you'll see.
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:02.640]  Here it is.
[02:13:02.640 --> 02:13:03.640]  No, that's not it.
[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:04.640]  I mean, I got so much here.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:05.800]  I've gone over.
[02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:06.800]  But there it is.
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:09.240]  And blow that up for people who show the video.
[02:13:09.240 --> 02:13:10.800]  Look at how China is exploding.
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:12.800]  Look at how India is exploding.
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:15.800]  Everybody's increasing their fossil fuels, but you're up in the U.S.
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:19.360]  Because again, the globalists have all invested in China and other areas.
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:20.640]  Look at the U.S.
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:22.280]  We're going down.
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:23.600]  Other countries are going down.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:25.600]  But China is exploding.
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:26.600]  Even India is going down.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:28.880]  That's designed to only let China operate.
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.760]  That's a tariff against other countries for China and the globalist.
[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:33.760]  Great points.
[02:13:33.760 --> 02:13:34.760]  Thank you, Dave.
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:35.760]  Okay.
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:36.760]  Mark in Texas on spiritual warfare.
[02:13:36.760 --> 02:13:37.760]  Go ahead.
[02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:41.160]  Hey, Alex, it's Mark and I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.160]  Thank you.
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:43.160]  Call from McKinney today.
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:46.600]  And I did want to let you know I'm watching your program quite widely now.
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:47.600]  And I've also got that book.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:48.600]  The Great Reset.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:49.600]  Thank you.
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:53.080]  And I appreciate the guy before you that stays calm because he would set a prayer.
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:55.400]  So I was praying a little bit whether or not I should give you a call.
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:56.400]  I am a first-time caller.
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:57.400]  Thank you, brother.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.400]  I appreciate all the stuff you're doing.
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.600]  I want to tell you, I read the book Great Reset.
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:06.440]  And I appreciate what you had to say about Saul being the wanted king instead of God.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:09.640]  And I appreciate all the stuff you're saying about scriptures.
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:12.920]  But I just wanted to add a couple of things here and give you some food for thought.
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:18.160]  You know, there are four dispensations between the fall and the new heaven and the new earth.
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:21.240]  And we are in the third dispensation, the dispensation of grace, and you're reading
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.360]  your Bible, so you probably understand that.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:28.640]  So we have the first dispensation, which is the faith, you know, Noah and Abraham.
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:32.960]  Then we have the second dispensation, dispensation of the law with Moses.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.440]  The law made nothing perfect to bring into the better hope did.
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:41.280]  The law only had the shadow of the good things to come, but not the very image of those things.
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:45.040]  And it could never make the covers that came there continually perfect.
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:47.720]  The law was only a school mess to bring us to Christ.
[02:14:47.720 --> 02:14:52.520]  Then Christ came and he said about these people that were his leaders at that point
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:53.520]  in time.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:54.520]  He said, you know what?
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:55.520]  You shut up the kingdom of heaven.
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:59.160]  You won't go in yourselves and those you would, you've hindered.
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:02.200]  And then he set up a new one called this dispensation of grace.
[02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:03.920]  And I hope I'm not taking too much of your time.
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:04.920]  I just wanted to make sure.
[02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:05.920]  No, you're right.
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:07.920]  Christ came to complete everything.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:08.920]  You got it.
[02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:12.680]  And we're only in the third one because remember it was a mystery that had been hit from age
[02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:13.680]  in this.
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:14.680]  And everything comes in threes.
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:17.760]  The Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, Jesus is the completion.
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:18.760]  Amen.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:19.760]  But you know what?
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:21.000]  We have another dispensation.
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:24.800]  The angels not yet come down out of heaven, clothe with the cloud, with his feet like
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:25.800]  colors of fire.
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:27.280]  I know you're reading the book of Revelation.
[02:15:27.280 --> 02:15:32.240]  So you understand that because when he comes down, Jesus is the clock beginning ticking
[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:33.640]  down to that.
[02:15:33.640 --> 02:15:36.200]  He's the beginning of the end for the devil.
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:38.960]  So so there is a thousand year millennium coming up.
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:39.960]  Stay there.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:40.960]  Finish your point.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:41.960]  Don't hang up.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.960]  Don't hang up, Mark.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.000]  You probably will believe me, folks, the globalists know this.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.480]  This is all going down on this planet.
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:49.800]  We'll come back and finish it with Mark and we'll go to everybody else.
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:16:19.640]  Stay with us, infowars.com.

[02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:46.560]  on the air.
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:49.120]  So again, introducing infowars.com.
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:57.400]  Now exclusively available at infowarsstore.com with massive, massive savings.
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:03.040]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends, and we're so stupid we let them kill us.
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:11.480]  We deserve it, except the children don't deserve it, do they?
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:27.000]  I looked and behold a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named death.
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:37.560]  Now the translation is, I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:44.440]  was death and hell followed with him, a book of revelation.
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:47.880]  Very serious times to be alive, folks, they're not just doing this as a one off, this is
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:51.960]  the beginning of the rest of our lives, this is our fight, and I'm proud of humanity.
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:55.840]  The globalists even admit it's leaked, they're very upset that they're losing and that this
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:58.520]  hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:03.920]  I talk a lot about the great successes infowars has had, I don't think anybody can deny it
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.720]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, but when we talk about the
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:13.640]  crew at infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really
[02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:18.840]  have been the MVPs in this fight, and when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:24.040]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:25.040]  just incredible.
[02:18:25.040 --> 02:18:29.960]  So for myself, the whole infowars crew, I thank you for your past support, I only encourage
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:34.600]  you now to realize that infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:38.240]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it,
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:43.520]  but most viewers and listeners never go to infowars.com and you never buy great products
[02:18:43.520 --> 02:18:46.680]  that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air.
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:51.400]  I know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products at infowars.com.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:55.520]  If just one percent more of you took action at went to infowars.com, our fighting problems
[02:18:55.520 --> 02:18:56.520]  will be over.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.520]  Please take action now.
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:04.240]  Mark Twain, one of America's greatest writers and satirist in Mines, famously said more
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:10.800]  than 150 years ago, rumors of his demise had been greatly exaggerated, because the newspapers
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:16.680]  kept saying he died decades before he did die, and it's the same si-op today.
[02:19:16.680 --> 02:19:21.000]  Infowars is more influential and more powerful than ever because of your support and because
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.080]  of the facts of what we've covered is coming true.
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.800]  But if they can convince you we've been shut down, if they can convince you that we're
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:32.920]  going away, and you stop supporting, you stop spreading the word, then they do win.
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:37.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's only one group of people that can shut down Infowars, and
[02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:39.040]  that's you, the viewers and listeners.
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:41.000]  If you decide we're done, we're done.
[02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:45.200]  If you decide to go to infowars.com against supplements and books and films and t-shirts
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:48.280]  and so much more, we will stay on the air indefinitely.
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:52.240]  It is all in your hands, so thanks for your support, stand up against the globalists,
[02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:55.520]  go to infowars.com right now and keep us on air.
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.240]  It's up to you.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:11.760]  Leading of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:12.760]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:20:12.760 --> 02:20:17.600]  Coming up next segment for one segment, Ezra Levant from Switzerland at the Debo script
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:22.480]  joins us for a news download that I'll continue with calls, and then I've got the whole latest
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:27.360]  download on the pedophile armies in different ways they're abusing and attacking children
[02:20:27.360 --> 02:20:29.200]  that will continue with your phone calls.
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:35.800]  But finishing up with Mark, Mark, the point you're getting at here is spiritual warfare
[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:41.040]  and the fact that this is all a test, or what's the gist of what you're saying?
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:45.200]  Because I agree with what you're saying, but what's the cherry on top?
[02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:50.880]  So I just want to point out that the globalists know that this 10 kings and this beast that's
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:55.080]  going to appear on the scene, God is going to put it in their heart to perform his mind
[02:20:55.080 --> 02:21:00.720]  in one mind and to give their kingdoms to the beast and to the word of the Lord as accomplished.
[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:05.400]  Because Christ is going to come down from heaven, defeat this Antichrist person and
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:09.800]  his kingdom is raining over this planet, the globalists know that, and then Christ is going
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:12.560]  to be installed for a thousand year millennium.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:16.600]  That's the scriptures, and that's what I was trying to get across to you, that we have
[02:21:16.600 --> 02:21:19.160]  this hope because of what God has done for us.
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:24.680]  Well, there's no mistake that the devil in his minions, these world leaders follow the
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:26.680]  Bible exactly.
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:27.680]  You got it, man.
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.680]  You are so onto it.
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:30.680]  That's what I was reading your book, man.
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:32.680]  I appreciate you, brother.
[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:34.440]  Thank you for the support.
[02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:35.440]  Thank you, brother.
[02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:38.240]  All right, let's talk to 5G activists in Rhode Island.
[02:21:38.240 --> 02:21:39.240]  Go ahead.
[02:21:39.240 --> 02:21:40.240]  Hello, Alex.
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:41.240]  Yes.
[02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:44.600]  Um, I'd like to talk about evolved technologies.
[02:21:44.600 --> 02:21:47.400]  Have you ever heard of them?
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:48.400]  Here rings a bell.
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:49.400]  Tell me.
[02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:53.080]  Okay, so they're spelt evolved without the E on the end.
[02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:58.400]  They're backed by Bill Gates, and they're board of directors and advisors on the company.
[02:21:58.400 --> 02:22:02.480]  They're all evil CIA, FBI people.
[02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:07.640]  These are 3D scanners that they scan your body profile, your gate, everything.
[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:11.240]  And they can tell, the point is they want to put them in so they can see if you have
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:12.840]  a plastic gun.
[02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:18.160]  The way they look, they look just like the anti-theft devices at any store, right, that
[02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:20.240]  read the bar code if you didn't pay for it.
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:26.080]  They look just like that so they don't look like a big magnetic scanner or whatever.
[02:22:26.080 --> 02:22:29.400]  But it's pretty insidious because they're putting them everywhere.
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:33.840]  They didn't have a lot of them in places like two years ago, but they're at Disney World
[02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:34.840]  Universal.
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:36.560]  They're putting them in schools.
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:43.760]  They're going to like a superintendent's conference soon, or it may have already happened.
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:45.320]  They got them at sports stadiums.
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:50.560]  I don't know if they have them in Austin, Texas yet, but they also tied a facial recognition
[02:22:50.560 --> 02:22:57.800]  because basically during COVID, Disney was using them with a facial recognition to see
[02:22:57.800 --> 02:22:59.480]  if you were wearing a mask or not.
[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:04.320]  But they could also basically like trespass you and never even have your photo just like
[02:23:04.320 --> 02:23:05.800]  have your biometrics on there.
[02:23:05.800 --> 02:23:06.800]  Let's try that.
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:07.800]  I'm not aware of the technology.
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:08.800]  We put it on screen.
[02:23:08.800 --> 02:23:13.520]  Meneno Bill Gates is at the forefront of biometric stuff that even scans through your clothes.
[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:20.440]  So we all heard about the law firm that banned people that were suing their company from
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:23.280]  being able to go to Madison Square Garden and things like that.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:27.840]  And so this is very, very similar technology and it's absolutely draconian.
[02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:33.480]  And basically a little birdie told me like you can't really opt out of them unless you
[02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:35.080]  say you got a medical condition.
[02:23:35.080 --> 02:23:36.960]  So I think that really sucks.
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:39.720]  And there's one other point on 5G.
[02:23:39.720 --> 02:23:44.640]  I think the main way we stop it is by getting people riled up about property values because
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:47.080]  they're putting them on top of utility poles.
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:48.080]  So they could...
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:49.080]  You're right.
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:50.080]  That's the angle.
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:53.440]  Property values drop where they go as long as people know how sick they make you.
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:55.360]  Anybody near them should sue and say no.
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:56.360]  Thank you.
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:58.560]  JT in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:23:58.560 --> 02:24:00.200]  Hey, Alex.
[02:24:00.200 --> 02:24:02.240]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:24:02.240 --> 02:24:07.880]  Next two and next three have changed my life, recently ordered the Red Pill Plus, can't wait
[02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:08.880]  to try it.
[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:09.880]  Thank you.
[02:24:09.880 --> 02:24:11.880]  I'll get it straight to my point.
[02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:20.320]  You had Dr. Ben Marble on last week and he projected up to a billion vaccine deaths in
[02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:22.320]  the next year.
[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:27.840]  And I heard a similar forecast with Mike Adams interviewing at doubt.
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:39.680]  So I wanted to get your take on what the U.S. and worldwide economic and societal implications
[02:24:39.680 --> 02:24:44.120]  will be if that goes down.
[02:24:44.120 --> 02:24:46.600]  And specifically what goes down?
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:53.560]  It will if a billion vaccine deaths happen next year like Dr. Marble project.
[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:54.560]  That's what I thought you were getting at.
[02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:57.840]  I guess your phone or my headset broke up a little bit for a second.
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:01.680]  My headset doesn't usually break up, but it's been, it's wireless, so it's been breaking
[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:02.680]  up a little bit today.
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:03.680]  I don't know what's going on.
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:09.640]  It's happening five or six times, but it still causes a problem.
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:14.760]  A billion sick people, which is conservative, will weigh down society and further break
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:16.240]  down civilization.
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:22.840]  So we don't have 2.1 children on average per country for every two people.
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:24.000]  That'll break down society.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:28.520]  And if you make a billions of people sick, that will make society be untenable and fall
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:31.920]  apart, which will cause a post-industrial world.
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:33.920]  So that's their plan.
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:34.920]  Wow.
[02:25:34.920 --> 02:25:38.960]  Hey, I do see the awakening has started.
[02:25:38.960 --> 02:25:42.640]  I've got your arrest spouchy bumper sticker on my truck.
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:43.640]  Love it.
[02:25:43.640 --> 02:25:46.440]  I used to get a lot of middle finger hate.
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:50.400]  That's recently changed to a lot of thumbs ups.
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:54.200]  So what, you put it on there a while ago and got some hate, now you're getting love?
[02:25:54.200 --> 02:25:55.200]  Yes.
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:25:56.200]  Yeah.
[02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:58.200]  It's completely changed.
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:03.120]  Well, see, if you're not a public figure, which is a great thing, a bumper sticker lets
[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:05.280]  you experience what's really going on.
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:07.960]  So how long ago did you put the sticker on?
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:14.840]  I put it on six months ago and, you know, I've got it on a magnet in case I'm parked
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:19.960]  in a liberal area, so I don't get a lot of vandalism, but I pretty much leave it on
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:20.960]  all the time now.
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:26.160]  So you had a little bit of friction before and now hardly any?
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:31.960]  Now it's positive, weren't honking thumbs up in my rear view mirror.
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:34.160]  I'm telling you, folks, it's beautiful.
[02:26:34.160 --> 02:26:35.360]  Thank you, JT.
[02:26:35.360 --> 02:26:36.360]  So exciting.
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:37.960]  Let's go to Barry and Georgia.
[02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:38.960]  Go ahead.
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:39.960]  Hey, Al.
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:45.720]  I just wanted to ask you about Davos and Brian Kemp.
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:51.920]  Is it for sure he's going over there or was he invited?
[02:26:51.920 --> 02:26:54.360]  Hello?
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:26:58.600]  I'm thinking, tweak my memory, who's Brian Kemp?
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:00.680]  Brian Kemp, governor of Georgia.
[02:27:00.680 --> 02:27:02.640]  Governor of Georgia, that's right.
[02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:08.160]  They put hundreds of names on there and that's in the news today that half the people are
[02:27:08.160 --> 02:27:11.680]  saying they were never invited or they're not going like George Soros.
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:14.760]  Sorry, I had a little bit of a brain fart there.
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:19.120]  What do you know is going on with Brian Kemp?
[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:21.440]  I didn't vote for him.
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:25.560]  I voted for, what's her name, other lady.
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:30.480]  You're having the same thing, so here's the question.
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:33.920]  You're reading he's going to be there or you're reading he's not going to be there?
[02:27:33.920 --> 02:27:38.560]  I heard he got an invitation and I want to know if he goes there, I'm going to go score
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:44.740]  a stir on him and I will look into that guys look at the governor, Brian Kemp is going
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:45.740]  to Davos.
[02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:49.960]  What Sky News is reporting and what the numbers show is that more than half the attendees
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:53.920]  that were going aren't going now because they see it as a bad PR move.
[02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:59.040]  So we've taken that globalist organization to arrogantly try to control our lives, arrogantly
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:02.400]  try to tell us what to do and now it's seen as a major negative.
[02:28:02.400 --> 02:28:06.400]  So that means their whole agenda is in trouble because that's the mouthpiece, the corporate
[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.840]  mouthpiece of this whole system, Barry.
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:15.080]  Yeah, if he goes, I'm not very far from Atlanta, I can be in Atlanta in 30 minutes, I can
[02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:19.800]  be in Macon, Georgia in 30 minutes, it don't make a difference to me, but and I've got
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:24.520]  a big truck and I put a sign on it and drive around the square.
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:28.480]  I agree, we should identify everybody that is part of this group and expose them and
[02:28:28.480 --> 02:28:29.800]  point out they're anti-American.
[02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:30.800]  Great idea, Barry.
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.600]  All right, we got Donna, we got John, we got Carol, who's actually up next.
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:36.760]  We got Rashid, we got Ken.
[02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:43.560]  I will get to your calls, but I've got a guest on from Davos in Switzerland, Ezra Levant
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:48.520]  of Rebel Media, the owner of it when we come back, then I've got that Pito news concerning
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:49.520]  Shirley Temple.

[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:12.040]  deep trouble, but now it's more important for us to stay on air than ever and if you
[02:29:12.040 --> 02:29:14.720]  don't support us, we will shut down.
[02:29:14.720 --> 02:29:19.560]  I am asking you from the bottom of my heart to commit even harder to the support you've

[02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:04.920]  We were supposed to be off the air months and months and months ago, mainstream media
[02:30:04.920 --> 02:30:07.080]  told you, but it's not true.
[02:30:07.080 --> 02:30:09.200]  They told you, we were going to be shut down.
[02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:12.240]  They told you we owed a billion and a half dollars, none of that's true.
[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:13.600]  It's all being appealed.
[02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:18.520]  They want you to think info wars is dead, but if you simply stand up and support info wars,
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:22.720]  we've got years and years of appeals and we will not be taken off the air, but if they
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:26.240]  can convince you that we've been shut down, they're going to win.
[02:30:26.240 --> 02:30:28.720]  Let the globalists sigh up you and your family.

[02:33:14.480 --> 02:33:16.400]  patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:17.400]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:22.160]  All right, as little event out of Canada has one of the most hard hitting international
[02:33:22.160 --> 02:33:27.800]  organizations exposing the globalist and the lockdowns the tyranny rebel news.com.
[02:33:27.800 --> 02:33:31.840]  He joins us driving down the road at Deimos right now.
[02:33:31.840 --> 02:33:36.160]  He's been there in the last few days, that's huge breaking news for us as we're a little
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:37.160]  van.
[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:38.160]  I don't really have you for one segment.
[02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:40.480]  Please give us a report on what you witnessed.
[02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:41.480]  Absolutely.
[02:33:41.480 --> 02:33:47.360]  Well, the first thing to know is that the world economic forum does not want scrutiny.
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:50.040]  They don't want journalists that they don't control.
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:51.040]  Now don't get me wrong.
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:54.320]  There are plenty of journalists here, but they're on the inside.
[02:33:54.320 --> 02:33:56.440]  They actually paid to play.
[02:33:56.440 --> 02:34:02.360]  They're here to harmonize their messaging with big government and big business.
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:03.880]  So that's the first thing to know.
[02:34:03.880 --> 02:34:09.680]  You will see CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, New York Times here.
[02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:10.680]  They're all here.
[02:34:10.680 --> 02:34:15.760]  They're all advertising it, but not a single one is asking an accountability question.
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:21.160]  Point two, they want to make it as difficult as possible for uninvited people to attend.
[02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:25.520]  So they book every single hotel room and Airbnb in Davos.
[02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:32.160]  So for example, our ragtag team of citizen journalists have to stay one town away because
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:36.360]  they literally bought up every hotel room in Davos and that's fine.
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.200]  But then they do another thing, Alex.
[02:34:38.200 --> 02:34:46.440]  They deploy up to 5,000 police and soldiers to lock this town tighter than a drum.
[02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:51.960]  So far we have been pulled over twice by police checkpoints, but I got a flicker of good news
[02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:52.960]  for you.
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:58.320]  I thought a white pill moment, twice the cops have pulled us over and said, you guys aren't
[02:34:58.320 --> 02:35:00.600]  going to film anything, are you?
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:05.760]  And I looked one cop in the eye and I said, well, that's exactly what we're going to do.
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:07.960]  It's still a free country, isn't it?
[02:35:07.960 --> 02:35:12.000]  And he hesitated for a moment and he said, carry on.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:18.800]  I think these Swiss police don't like being pressed into service as Klaus Schwab's personal
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:20.320]  bodyguards.
[02:35:20.320 --> 02:35:25.120]  So in fact, both times we were pulled over by police, we held our ground, said we're
[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:29.160]  free journalists and we were let out our merry way.
[02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:31.760]  So I think that's a flicker of hope.
[02:35:31.760 --> 02:35:37.040]  And what you said earlier about how some of the head honchos no longer coming around,
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:38.960]  I hope that's a sign to come.
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:41.440]  But there is still a lot of darkness here.
[02:35:41.440 --> 02:35:48.280]  Last point, BlackRock, one of the largest asset managers in the world led by Larry Fink,
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:53.160]  a radical activist, oh boy, they've got such a big pavilion here.
[02:35:53.160 --> 02:35:57.080]  They're trying to shape global policy.
[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:02.960]  If BlackRock wants to make, oh, by the way, we're coming by, I'm turning the camera.
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:05.000]  This is one of the police checkpoints.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:06.000]  Can you see it?
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  This is the checkpoint.
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000]  I was pulled over.
[02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.480]  Do you see these military vehicles?
[02:36:09.480 --> 02:36:10.480]  Do you see this?
[02:36:10.480 --> 02:36:13.480]  I don't know if you could see it because it's dark out.
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:16.600]  That's the checkpoint that I was pulled over earlier today, Alex.
[02:36:16.600 --> 02:36:20.080]  We saw you go through, let's continue.
[02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:24.000]  So BlackRock, here's the thing.
[02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.840]  If someone wants to make money, God bless them.
[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:27.440]  That's the American way, the Canadian way.
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:31.800]  If you want to reduce taxes and, you know, bullet to you.
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:36.640]  But what gets me about Larry Fink and BlackRock, which is over $10 trillion in assets under
[02:36:36.640 --> 02:36:39.920]  management, is they want to be politicians.
[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:45.520]  They want to shape policy, foreign policy, domestic policy, cultural Marxism, if they
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:49.080]  don't want to bother being elected, they don't want to bother going through the legislature.
[02:36:49.080 --> 02:36:54.960]  So the Larry Fink's of the world, and the Bill Gates's of the world, and the Al Gore's
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:58.640]  of the world, by the way, Gates and Fink are on the board of directors of the World Economic
[02:36:58.640 --> 02:36:59.760]  Forum.
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.920]  They meet in this secret conclave, and they're on par with world leaders.
[02:37:03.920 --> 02:37:09.720]  So you'll have the odd world leader attend here, and they're on a panel as equals with
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:13.200]  some billionaire who just paid to play.
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:19.200]  So what they're trying to do here is take decision making for ordinary citizens out
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:25.320]  of the Congress, out of the Canadian parliament, out of the hands of elected legislators.
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:29.720]  And I was reading your own deputy leader under Trudeau, she's there.
[02:37:29.720 --> 02:37:30.720]  Absolutely.
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:35.640]  In fact, Christian Freeland is her name, you won't even believe this, Alex.
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:43.680]  She was the authorized biographer of George Soros before she became Canada's deputy prime
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:49.640]  minister at my point, she's on the board of trustees of the World Economic Forum.
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:51.280]  So I got a question for you.
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:55.840]  Are you loyal to the Canadian government, and the Canadian people, and the Canadian constitution?
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:01.160]  You better be, because you're in our cabinet, or are you loyal to the board of trustees
[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:07.480]  of the World Economic Forum, run by some crazy Bond villain caricature, named Klaus Schwab.
[02:38:07.480 --> 02:38:12.400]  You can't ride two horses, Alex, and Christian Freeland, I don't know whose side she's loyal
[02:38:12.400 --> 02:38:15.120]  to, but let me close with one more point.
[02:38:15.120 --> 02:38:19.240]  You know what they talk about a lot here at the World Economic Forum, Alex, they talk
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:24.400]  about something they call global citizenship.
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:26.440]  Global citizenship, well, what does that mean?
[02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:30.400]  I know what it means to be a citizen of Canada, that's who I am, and you sure know what it
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:33.840]  means to be a citizen of the United States of America.
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:39.240]  You know what rights it gives you, and what responsibilities, and what power, and you know
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:44.520]  how you relate to your elected officials, but what does it mean?
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:48.240]  Global citizenship, who is my boss?
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:50.120]  How do I get my voice heard?
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:51.600]  Who's the king?
[02:38:51.600 --> 02:38:56.600]  Well, the king is a tyrant named Klaus Schwab, and his right-hand man Larry Fink, and the
[02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:01.480]  other people who either pay to play, like other billionaires or oligarchs, or other
[02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:07.640]  progressives in the global citizenship that they are promoting, you actually have no rights.
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:14.080]  You can't throw the bums out, and so it's a perversion of the words, it's not citizenship
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:20.040]  at all, you're now being a subject, maybe even a bit of a slave, that's what they're
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:26.800]  working on here, and the mass of the media just love it, Alex.
[02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:32.280]  Well the good news is the world's waking up, and they're reporting sorrows isn't going,
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:35.800]  up to half the list isn't going, I agree they're more powerful than ever, but they're being
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:42.200]  identified, and in international polls, the Davos group, we just lost our link there,
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:46.400]  that happens in these live feeds, I mean this is just an incredible time, we're back to
[02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:52.040]  Ezra LeVan, Ezra, the forced injections that coming up the vaccines aren't vaccines, and
[02:39:52.040 --> 02:39:58.840]  hurt people, all this news about the government suppressing the peaceful caravan last year,
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:02.880]  I really feel like humanity's on the march, we're not winning yet, but I think we're
[02:40:02.880 --> 02:40:05.480]  starting to turn the tide, what do you think?
[02:40:05.480 --> 02:40:10.880]  I think so too, you know I was there as you know, in Canada during the trucker convoy,
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:15.040]  and I want to remind you and all your viewers who sometimes despair, well remember those
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:19.520]  truckers, they didn't have any political party backing them, they didn't have any super
[02:40:19.520 --> 02:40:26.720]  pack, they didn't have any, they were an organic group of grassroots people who stood up, it
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:34.200]  was a spontaneous authentic movement, as George Orwell said in his book 1984, the proles will
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:40.680]  save us, he meant the proletariat, ordinary working people, saved Canada from Justin Trudeau's
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:47.480]  tyranny, and maybe there's a flicker of hope out there, so can we possibly win against
[02:40:47.480 --> 02:40:52.440]  the Klaus Schwab's and the Larry Fink's of the world, I mean they got so much money,
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:58.280]  they got everything stitched up from the inside, can we possibly possibly win, well where
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:03.040]  there's life, there's hope Alex, and I put to you that the case of the Canadian trucker
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:08.640]  says, just when things look awful, don't count out the human spirit of my friend, I'm going
[02:41:08.640 --> 02:41:13.480]  through a tunnel in Switzerland, so you might lose me here, but boy it's been good to catch
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:19.160]  up with you, we're putting all our videos up on WEF reports.com in case people want
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:23.120]  to see them for themselves, and I'm happy to keep in touch with you in the days ahead
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.200]  if you want more, I'm just going in that tunnel now, just FYI.
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:30.000]  Well you're still there, yes, I want you to come on here, it's a special show tomorrow,
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:36.440]  we're kicking off at 8am, an emergency, Alex shows us right, broadcasts, and so much positive
[02:41:36.440 --> 02:41:40.400]  things are happening, I mean look at all the poison shot news, the FDA admitting they got
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:45.320]  lied to, making the shots don't work, admitting it's killing people, I mean we're seeing devastating
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:46.320]  victories.
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:53.360]  Well you know Albert Burla, the head of Pfizer, you know they're at the thickest thieves with
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:58.280]  the world economic form, and you probably know that clip where Burla was brainstorming
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:05.520]  with Klaus Schwab and others about a fantasy pill for the future that Pfizer was daydreaming
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:10.720]  of, I don't know if you know the clip I'm talking about, where the pill literally had
[02:42:10.720 --> 02:42:15.320]  a chip in it, now that used to be the stuff in conspiracy theories, but that's how they
[02:42:15.320 --> 02:42:20.720]  talk at the world economic forum when they think they're just amongst friends, that's
[02:42:20.720 --> 02:42:28.000]  the crazy thing, they actually say the secret part out loud, and so now that citizen journalists
[02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:32.880]  are catching on, they're thinking oh maybe we better take this to another secret gathering.
[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:37.080]  Well that's why I shadow government because we know DeBose is the Bilderberg Group's
[02:42:37.080 --> 02:42:42.160]  public mouthpiece, they're being exposed and that's half the battle, thank you so much
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:47.560]  Ezra Levant, we'll talk to you again tomorrow from rebelnews.com, God bless you and be safe.

[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:08.160]  a video that I remember seeing decades ago but I only saw it last night on Twitter it
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:13.560]  reminded me of it that I've seen it years ago video child actress charlie temple charlie
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:21.240]  temple exposes hollywood pedophilia and here she is the biggest child star in history a
[02:48:21.240 --> 02:48:28.080]  big actress after that on larry king live talking about pedophilia when she was 12 years
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:32.680]  old and her mother and all the rest of the stuff and it ties into the next story we're
[02:48:32.680 --> 02:48:38.080]  going to cover here at us when I love fox I went to MGM for one picture thank goodness
[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:43.560]  only one and when I got there with my mother we were separated she went into the office
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:48.280]  of louis b maire and I went into the office of Arthur Fried and he was going to talk
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:52.640]  to me about a movie he wanted to put me in I'm 12 years old you know and I thought he
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:59.440]  was a producer but instead he was an exhibitor and I've never seen anyone naked before except
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:06.520]  myself so I had no clue about what was happening and so it struck me so funny I laughed at
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:11.280]  him and I laughed obroiously I had tears you know and he got infuriated and he said out
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:15.640]  out out go so I tell your mother well I went down was very quiet I went down and met her
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:19.600]  in the lobby of the administration building she came up very quietly from louis b maire's
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:24.320]  office and we walked hand in hand silently to the car which was unusual we got in the
[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:29.400]  car driving home I said mom you won't believe what happened to me and I told her what happened
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:34.960]  and she got kind of quiet she said well you don't know what happened to me and louis
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:40.560]  louis b maire wasn't as bad as Fried was to me but he came on to my mother so we both
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:48.080]  decided that we didn't like MGM much it was you know it was better at fox so surely temple
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:54.280]  of 12 goes into a room at MGM and the head of the studio is naked trying to have sex
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:50:02.640]  with her total domination total control but now they don't want to just rape our daughters
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:07.080]  and sons they want to cut their testicles and breast off they make it trendy and fun
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:11.480]  and promote it like it's normal everywhere instead of hiding it in an office or in a
[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:18.840]  dungeon they make it normal and oh everybody's for this so there's a video of your TV viewer
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:26.560]  of little Shirley temple and then she's 12 years old and they march her in to a room
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:30.200]  where the head of the studio wants to have sex with her and there's larry king laughing
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:36.400]  about it so new york moves to allow biological males to be housed in women's prisons that's
[02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:45.760]  the governor attacking women's spaces attacking women in the name of women monstrous but they

[02:54:18.120 --> 02:54:23.960]  been in ministry for many years my life is devoted to christ and have been speaking and
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:32.320]  teaching but also in the field of quantum physics and understanding wellness human behavior
[02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:37.320]  and spirituality well even tim robbins came out a month ago and said our three weeks ago
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:42.600]  the new religion is coven and he went along with he apologized it is a new religion of
[02:54:42.600 --> 02:54:48.320]  worshiping big pharma yes and it's deception because here's the point i wanted to make
[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:55.720]  on your call the elite know that when they put people humanity in a position to be a
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:02.480]  receiver of the jab not a giver receiving energy without giving back this is quantum
[02:55:02.480 --> 02:55:07.680]  physics this is deeper than what any medical doctor can share is what i've dedicated my
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:12.560]  life's work to when someone's in a receiver position and they're not paying for it they're
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:18.880]  not giving back to it it with life force it splits their left and right brain hemisphere
[02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:25.280]  into darkness and a black hole gravity pull that sucks in the negatives of the giver
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:32.600]  the negatives of the jab and so you lose the receiver which is deceiver the ones that receive
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:39.120]  are deceived they are sucking in the negative and lost their life force and power to the
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:45.800]  giver whoever is the giver gets the power in the life force and the receiver is deceived
[02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:50.840]  and suffers the consequences i agree that's why they always want to put us in a victim
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:58.560]  mentality yes and so ultimately of course god is the answer but there is a way alex
[02:55:58.560 --> 02:56:04.120]  to correct for people to heal but here's what i found i have tried to scream this out to
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:10.000]  the rooftop christ doesn't want people to just heal and feel comfortable christ wants a relationship
[02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:16.720]  the divine wants the relationship to then heal them but they can heal by ultimately correcting
[02:56:16.720 --> 02:56:23.280]  their relationship with the creator first secondly give back this is energy the way
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:28.160]  to correct the jab the heart and the stroke all heart and stroke stuff energetically in
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:33.280]  terms of quantum physics is because they've lost their life force to the giver it's gone
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:38.280]  they're suffering from that all right i appreciate your call very interesting i appreciate your

[03:00:06.040 --> 03:00:09.400]  calls from carol in florida than kim ohio go ahead carol
[03:00:12.520 --> 03:00:15.160]  hi alex welcome
[03:00:17.160 --> 03:00:23.800]  hi alex this is carol i wanted to let you know i was looking into the arm services blood program
[03:00:24.440 --> 03:00:31.320]  and it alarmed me because they had a all through january they're having a military wide blood drive
[03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:36.760]  and i find that really i don't think that's very good because of the spike proteins and
[03:00:36.760 --> 03:00:43.640]  we know the troops all had to have the shot and so i went on arm services blood program
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:53.560]  at health dot no and i it says that they provide blood products for service members veterans and
[03:00:53.560 --> 03:01:00.280]  their families and it also goes on to say that they work closely with civilian counterparts
[03:01:00.280 --> 03:01:08.280]  now all of the blood from our military could potentially be given to people all through
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:12.760]  the united states and around the world yeah it's not worse than that they're is confirmed
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:18.680]  they're not giving cows pigs and other animals the mrna shots to infect their meat it's a total
[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:24.680]  takeover yes you're you're you're definitely on target okay so the doctor peter mccullis said that
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:32.200]  the uh the blood product will uh it does contain uh the spike protein up now it does and so the
[03:01:32.200 --> 03:01:38.520]  u.s blood product is totally infested and contaminated switzerland is offering non-vaccinated
[03:01:38.520 --> 03:01:44.920]  blood versus vaccinated blood they are taking children people from people in places like australia
[03:01:44.920 --> 03:01:52.360]  who don't take the poison shot or who won't take a blood transfusion this is a total takeover thank
[03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:57.880]  you alex i appreciate all you've done for for everyone and my son uh was coerced and to get
[03:01:57.880 --> 03:02:04.280]  in the vaccine and dr zeb zelenko's protocol uh i believe saved his life thank you alex great news
[03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:12.920]  girl thank you kin and ohio go ahead yes alex yes uh reporting uh live from columbus where
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:17.880]  they've taken down all the columbus statue i just want to say i'll get right to my main point and um
[03:02:17.880 --> 03:02:24.040]  um that is monetizing band dot video and that is i think you should monetize your greatest skill
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:28.760]  and uh i see you i see you with the uh conspiracy fact dot info so i'm definitely going to check
[03:02:28.760 --> 03:02:34.200]  that out but um if you were interested in you know getting um um you know a monetizing band
[03:02:34.200 --> 03:02:40.040]  dot video i think i have a simple uh strategy for doing self um and i think what you could do is
[03:02:40.040 --> 03:02:45.160]  you could remove that little um 10 second ad that you have before many of your videos on band
[03:02:45.160 --> 03:02:50.280]  dot video so like say for uh premium subscribers could sign up for say something like you know
[03:02:50.280 --> 03:02:55.640]  just like youtube premium like 12 bucks a month and they remove the ad prior to the videos so i'm
[03:02:55.640 --> 03:03:00.120]  thinking you do that for you know i know you want to keep your message free no that's a good idea
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:03.000]  we can also have a subscription side of it yeah
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:10.280]  yeah so i'm thinking you know often you'll say something that by the end of the week i want
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:14.200]  to go back and i want to review it but i don't remember exactly what day you set it on so i
[03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:17.960]  bounce around you know a few different videos but i hit that ad every time so i'm saying
[03:03:17.960 --> 03:03:21.560]  you know you offer me the ability to say you know you could undercut youtube that's a like
[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:26.600]  10 11 you know 12 bucks i would pay that because i'm on i'm on band dot video as much as i just
[03:03:26.600 --> 03:03:33.480]  like youtube has youtube youtube red we should have band dot video ad free yeah band dot video
[03:03:33.480 --> 03:03:38.440]  red band dot video premium band dot video platinum whatever you want to call it you know and i know
[03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:45.320]  that's a great idea brother that's a great idea yeah i think um you know i definitely would i would
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:49.800]  sign up and i think that's the way to fund the info war you know i think you're broadcasting
[03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:54.680]  you are underappreciated as you're broadcasting in your journalism and i see people like i don't
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:59.080]  even people want to say the guy's name but that interview you did recently i think you did excellent
[03:03:59.080 --> 03:04:04.280]  on and the idea that he wants to position himself as a journalist and somehow you're not i think
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:11.000]  that's laughable and i think you should completely own your journalistic integrity and uh the idea
[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:14.840]  that someone wants to put themselves above you uh in a minute i don't care about any of that i just
[03:04:14.840 --> 03:04:18.920]  want to beat the globalist but i hear you i appreciate your call brother thank you all right
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:23.880]  jason bermas is a great researcher filmmaker he's about to take over and cover the waterfront
[03:04:23.880 --> 03:04:29.080]  of big issues and they're breaking now and then in an hour from now own shroyer in the war room

[03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:16.920]  martin luther king jr day i would like to invite all of you to now come into and take part in what
[03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:24.840]  i believe is the second civil rights movement not only in this country but around the world
[03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:34.200]  because it is literally team human team humanity against a transhumanist predator class and it was
[03:06:34.200 --> 03:06:40.760]  so hard for me to figure out what i wanted to start and lead with today because so many things
[03:06:40.760 --> 03:06:46.440]  that were discussed at least on the portion of the show that i watched um we could start for
[03:06:46.440 --> 03:06:53.320]  instance with the albert berella clip where he's talking about the internet of bodies essentially
[03:06:53.320 --> 03:07:00.520]  and this new medical tyranny that makes sure what compliance you will take your medication in fact
[03:07:00.520 --> 03:07:08.120]  we will be playing that clip you just saw the absurdity of a man talking about feminism
[03:07:08.120 --> 03:07:13.000]  and women's rights in a beauty pageant well i've got news for you it's something we're gonna have to
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:21.800]  hit the transgender movement is a transhuman movement and they want you to disassociate
[03:07:21.800 --> 03:07:27.880]  from biology and if you dare to question it you are a bigot if you think i'm wrong about that we've
[03:07:27.880 --> 03:07:34.040]  actually done a much longer piece but i would suggest that you check out from transgender to
[03:07:34.040 --> 03:07:40.520]  transhuman a manifesto on the freedom of form where the very first the very first paragraph
[03:07:40.520 --> 03:07:45.640]  is billions of sexes now you know anything about the people at the top they don't really want billions
[03:07:45.640 --> 03:07:54.280]  of people but billions of sexes you bet it tells you that there are not two sexes and that when
[03:07:54.280 --> 03:08:01.240]  this birthing process is through when they have their agenda pushed okay it will be like labeling
[03:08:01.240 --> 03:08:08.440]  somebody black or white in south african apartheid and you could say oh well that's just some coop
[03:08:08.440 --> 03:08:18.760]  jason who who wrote that the most powerful rich transgender person on the planet martin rothblatt
[03:08:18.760 --> 03:08:27.080]  this is indeed an agenda it is out in the open this person has uh started their own movement
[03:08:27.080 --> 03:08:31.160]  and religion called teresim it's right here you can go to their foundation it's lovely
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:37.800]  they're at the forefront of another type of transhumanism because what's going on right now
[03:08:38.760 --> 03:08:43.720]  with the mrna injections the hate and lies shots that are being distributed the multitude
[03:08:43.720 --> 03:08:52.200]  of these medications okay and what i would call DARPA driven bio weapons that are being injected
[03:08:52.200 --> 03:08:58.840]  into everything at this point that's one part of the experiment and human xeno transplantation
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:04.760]  where you're growing organs in pigs and distributive is another part of that experiment they want you
[03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:11.240]  to merge with the machines while they take hold of humanity alex isn't you know blowing smoke
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:18.440]  up your bottom about that unzipped genes written by rothblatt in 97 said they would take charge
[03:09:19.080 --> 03:09:26.840]  of the birthing process these people are very out in the open about changing the genetics of the
[03:09:26.840 --> 03:09:33.400]  human species and bringing in a virtual environment we're going to cover it all and all of it all of
[03:09:33.400 --> 03:09:41.240]  it is out in the open and being driven by the globalist and when i say globalist let me be really
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:48.760]  specific with everybody the davos crew the united nations and the world health organization are all
[03:09:48.760 --> 03:09:55.400]  down like a clown charlie brown and i almost started this broadcast like i started my broadcast
[03:09:55.400 --> 03:10:04.280]  earlier today with when silence becomes betrayal from martin luther king now i get it that i have
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:09.960]  a dream stuff great there's a ton of great stuff out there via martin luther king jr but silent
[03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:16.920]  when silence becomes betrayal he talks about conformity he talks about a war on the poor
[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:23.320]  class doesn't matter if you're white or black he also talks about betraying himself and not
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:31.080]  speaking out enough well if you were hip to what was going on initially during the covet
[03:10:31.080 --> 03:10:36.760]  1984 nightmare and you tried to keep your head down you knew that you were betraying humanity
[03:10:36.760 --> 03:10:41.880]  step up now come into the fray because we got a ton of videos illustrating this we're going to be
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:48.440]  talking about not only this virtual reality and this transgender movement that is a hundred percent
[03:10:48.440 --> 03:10:56.440]  backed by these people but we're going to talk about automation okay and really i think wolves
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:02.600]  in sheep clothing trojan horses all right but but just to illustrate why this is important
[03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:11.960]  let's take a look uh this is rothblatt and uh the wife of rothblatt is actually a robot and an ai
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:17.720]  built for teresim you can't make this stuff up that that is a reality they're saying that this
[03:11:17.720 --> 03:11:25.880]  person is the richest ceo woman ceo in the world okay again this is the absurdity you have to live
[03:11:25.880 --> 03:11:32.760]  under and and here we go so promoting gender ideology under the world health organization
[03:11:32.760 --> 03:11:39.640]  this is absolutely 100 out in the open push it's part of their sustainability agenda okay this is
[03:11:39.640 --> 03:11:46.200]  the world health health organization gender and health right here and biden has echoed echoed
[03:11:46.200 --> 03:11:50.680]  all of these things especially over at the global fund where he said investing in this
[03:11:51.480 --> 03:11:58.760]  you know you thought gates at davos with a vaccine investment at a 20 to one return where he said
[03:11:58.760 --> 03:12:05.640]  let's just about better with anything else out there 31 to 1 right you remember when he was
[03:12:05.640 --> 03:12:09.960]  shaking around like i think i'm going to shake someone here and we're going to put me in he was
[03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:14.440]  introduced by bill gates at that then he could barely speak for the five minutes he did he got
[03:12:14.440 --> 03:12:20.280]  like a standing ovation when they took when he said 31 to 1 return and then when he went off to the
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:27.960]  side they pushed him back into the middle so he could take pictures with other puppets like trudeau
[03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:33.720]  macrone the usual suspects the worst of the worst this is the agenda and yes he did speak
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:42.360]  about a haven in the united states for uh young misgendered people you understand they want your
[03:12:42.360 --> 03:12:49.560]  kids they're openly promoting this the whos global health for peace initiative you see it's health
[03:12:49.560 --> 03:12:57.800]  for peace and peace for health and their logo okay is this thing and they're incorporating the
[03:12:57.800 --> 03:13:02.120]  climate into it that's why it's all the same agenda it's all under global governance we're
[03:13:02.120 --> 03:13:09.880]  going to get to the virtual part of that in a moment so you have the mrna agenda getting you
[03:13:09.880 --> 03:13:18.040]  ready and really beginning to change the genomic the genomics of the entire planet you know i have
[03:13:18.040 --> 03:13:23.320]  denis buschnell the chief scientist at nasa currently been there since the apollo days
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:30.680]  total defense department guy saying that evolution is over we're in charge of the evolution of
[03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:36.040]  everything everything this guy has a crazy war document we're going to be going over as well
[03:13:36.040 --> 03:13:40.920]  i constantly go to it because it needs to be gone over okay so they want to take care of
[03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:48.440]  the climate the genomes of the entire species of not only humanity but of the planet and you
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:54.120]  can see it here oh there's bikes and windmills and they got the nice little heart thing meanwhile
[03:13:55.080 --> 03:13:59.160]  you know i think i'm gonna open with musk on the other end of this because talk about a trojan
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:06.360]  horse a guy like musk actually prints up the hate and lie shots okay all this is defense
[03:14:06.360 --> 03:14:13.080]  the department driven at the very heart of it and he's the guy that what that helps distribute
[03:14:13.720 --> 03:14:20.360]  crisper tech mrna tech tesla's not just a car company as you're going to see uh when we get
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:27.000]  back from the break okay i'm going to show you how tesla is very involved in not only automating you
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:36.600]  out and getting you to accept human like robots okay but take a look they printed up the hate and
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:45.000]  lie shots how else did this guy okay get so much wealthier during covid you know i was on paper he
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:52.840]  just lost 135 billion when you're backed by the defense department and things like tesla
[03:14:52.840 --> 03:14:59.480]  and space x you probably don't have to worry about it especially because you're being erected as the
[03:14:59.480 --> 03:15:06.760]  current savior okay so on the flip of this i got a couple short clips of musk at the
[03:15:06.760 --> 03:15:11.400]  optimist launch we're going to talk about over promising etc but i want to leave people with
[03:15:11.400 --> 03:15:17.160]  this before the commercial break especially since we have alex jones doing this marathon broadcast
[03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:23.720]  tomorrow where are the twitter files on alex jones where are the twitter files on info wars
[03:15:23.720 --> 03:15:29.080]  and the people that have worked there they were obviously suppressed at times there was obviously
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:36.200]  a decision to to be made to deplatform alex where's all that elon oh oh we can't have that
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:44.040]  there's so much more to these files and i want a wiki leeks style dump that's what we need all
[03:15:44.040 --> 03:15:49.960]  right and i need you guys to go to info war store dot com support the broadcast and get ready for
[03:15:49.960 --> 03:15:57.960]  tomorrow morning's epic eight a.m to midnight marathon show everybody that's watching this
[03:15:57.960 --> 03:16:03.960]  needs to support alex jones needs to support info wars and band dot video you know the bible says
[03:16:03.960 --> 03:16:09.720]  let another mouth praise you i'm going to do that right now alex jones has helped so many people
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:15.000]  in this industry you guys have no idea how many people have got their first start like savannah
[03:16:15.000 --> 03:16:20.840]  hernan is how many people have just been put on a launch pad the outer space because of alex jones
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:26.280]  including myself i've been given so many opportunities because of this man and because of this platform
[03:16:26.280 --> 03:16:30.920]  and i would probably not even be half of where i am right now if it weren't for alex jones i mean
[03:16:30.920 --> 03:16:36.760]  i've been able to be on podcasts with alex and joe rogan and tim cast the super tim cast irl
[03:16:36.760 --> 03:16:42.600]  listen what i'm saying is do not take alex jones and band dot video for granted because you don't

[03:20:17.640 --> 03:20:24.760]  hour and before we go to this clip of elon musk introducing the optimist bot and and really
[03:20:24.760 --> 03:20:34.200]  over promising and introducing a humanoid robot to get you accustomed to being automated out and
[03:20:34.200 --> 03:20:40.120]  interacting with ai and interacting believe it or not with the metaverse as well because these
[03:20:40.120 --> 03:20:46.040]  entities are going to start to become more and more lifelike and the programmable um
[03:20:46.920 --> 03:20:53.560]  mine files if you will the software are often going to be based on real people you knew that's
[03:20:53.560 --> 03:20:59.240]  actually the plan but before we go to that clip i don't want to make this broadcast all about elon
[03:20:59.240 --> 03:21:03.560]  musk you know i've done that in the past i've spent a whole hour on musk you can watch those
[03:21:04.440 --> 03:21:09.960]  you can also read a piece that i did five reasons why elon musk should not be trusted it's over at
[03:21:09.960 --> 03:21:16.760]  the rcreader.com that's a local publication here that actually goes to print in this day and age of
[03:21:16.760 --> 03:21:25.640]  2023 and at the top of band dot video where i have a channel reality ransom jason vermis i just did
[03:21:25.640 --> 03:21:32.760]  a spectacular just awesome round table with uh derrick brose of the conscious resistance james
[03:21:32.760 --> 03:21:38.360]  corbett of the corbett report whitney webb who just put out one nation under blackmail and of
[03:21:38.360 --> 03:21:44.600]  course ryan christian the last american vagabond so we went over a lot we didn't play a lot of
[03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:49.320]  clips but i definitely went over a lot of documentation i almost feel like i talk too much
[03:21:49.320 --> 03:21:56.840]  but there's so many things to talk about with musk and in that vein before we get going i want
[03:21:56.840 --> 03:22:05.800]  everybody to understand you're being psychologically manipulated okay in fifth generation warfare
[03:22:05.800 --> 03:22:12.840]  they've got the hip billionaire up there the tony stark like figure in his cool leather jacket
[03:22:12.840 --> 03:22:17.880]  it with a robot again that's not even a robot that's a display piece later on they show you
[03:22:17.880 --> 03:22:22.680]  what they got it does like this thing we're not even gonna get into that again over promising
[03:22:22.680 --> 03:22:28.920]  under delivering and then you hear what he says okay after it gets wheeled away and we're gonna
[03:22:28.920 --> 03:22:34.600]  we're gonna do a little jump it's not the cleanest video that i've ever had here but again you're
[03:22:34.600 --> 03:22:39.800]  given this savior type person and he's gonna promise you the world just like i've played clips of
[03:22:39.800 --> 03:22:44.520]  Walter Cronkite back in the day showing you all these devices and saying you know you're going to
[03:22:44.520 --> 03:22:50.920]  have a 30 hour work week there's going to be month long vacations all this automation everything's
[03:22:50.920 --> 03:22:57.160]  going to be great what happened well instead of one person going from their 40 or 40 plus hour
[03:22:57.160 --> 03:23:03.480]  work week and being able to have like a family of really four or five people easy you know might
[03:23:03.480 --> 03:23:08.760]  be stressing it with three to five kids but yeah that five mark you could probably make it have a
[03:23:08.760 --> 03:23:16.440]  house have a couple cars on top of it no problem to both people working 40 plus hour sometimes
[03:23:16.440 --> 03:23:22.360]  having part-time jobs on top of that and barely able to afford two children renting not owning
[03:23:22.360 --> 03:23:30.440]  anything that's how technology improved our standard of living in this country believe it or not okay
[03:23:30.440 --> 03:23:37.400]  so be very wary of musk when he makes these open and very empty promises in my opinion so here we
[03:23:37.400 --> 03:23:43.160]  go let's start it off optimus is designed to be an extremely capable robot but made in very high
[03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:49.320]  volume probably ultimately millions of units so he's telling you here we're making a robot that's
[03:23:49.320 --> 03:23:54.440]  going to be in the millions of units and he's going to promise it to you for under the price of a car
[03:23:54.440 --> 03:24:03.640]  that part's true um and it is expected to cost much less than a car so uh i would say probably
[03:24:03.640 --> 03:24:11.560]  less than 20 000 we'll be my guests and let me explain why um that is important and by the way
[03:24:11.560 --> 03:24:16.440]  this is where it kind of like it's wheeled past them they're coming in huh with this thing i want to
[03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:21.880]  get to this part of the clip right here because this is where it takes place this is where you're
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:28.360]  promised everything all right oh just like the brain ship that he's pushing the neuro link is
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:36.040]  going to solve all these problems this automation is going to change the entire economy and if it's
[03:24:36.040 --> 03:24:42.760]  used in a benign sense as we know everything is especially technology oh yes it's been used so
[03:24:42.760 --> 03:24:49.560]  well to empower humanity and not enslave it in large factions i'm sure that's exactly what's
[03:24:49.560 --> 03:24:56.280]  going to happen so just here we have to say here a lot of work to be done to refine optimus and
[03:24:56.280 --> 03:25:03.080]  improve it obviously this is just optimus version 1 um and that's really why we're holding this event
[03:25:03.080 --> 03:25:10.360]  which is to convince some of the most talented people in the world like you guys um to uh join
[03:25:10.360 --> 03:25:17.400]  tesla and help make it a reality and bring it to fruition at scale uh such that it can help
[03:25:17.400 --> 03:25:27.560]  millions of people um and the the and the potential likes it is is really boggles the mind because
[03:25:27.560 --> 03:25:33.880]  what is an economy an economy is uh sort of productive entities times the productivity
[03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:40.120]  uh capita times output productivity per capita at the point at which there is not a limitation on
[03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:45.880]  capita the it's not clear what an economy even means at that point it an economy becomes quasi
[03:25:45.880 --> 03:25:51.720]  infinite so what he's really talking about here when he talks about a quasi infinite economy
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:26:03.080]  notice he never talked about about it as a vehicle or an engine for an individual to have a higher
[03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:09.320]  standard of living or socially or economically climb right which is what you want a good economy
[03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:16.200]  you want individuals to have property ownership and rights okay and good working conditions all
[03:26:16.200 --> 03:26:21.880]  those that's not even in the discussion but on the other end of that when you hear the
[03:26:21.880 --> 03:26:28.520]  daubos crowd talk about the new economies they're not only pushing cbdcs which we're going to talk
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:34.200]  about okay and and really they already have blockchain people out there that's already a
[03:26:34.200 --> 03:26:40.840]  real thing daubos has a whole thing on already running refugee camps on the blockchain uh
[03:26:40.840 --> 03:26:49.080]  via this type of digital cryptocurrency remember sdr's imf international monetary fund well over
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:54.760]  a decade ago started distributing money through special drawing rights or zeros and ones on the
[03:26:54.760 --> 03:26:59.720]  computer now that's not blockchain technology but it shows you where it's moving and then the
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:05.640]  daubos crowd is going to try to sell you on what stakeholder capitalism oh stakeholder
[03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:10.440]  capitalism is so benevolent that that's the reality of this thing and they're going to say
[03:27:10.440 --> 03:27:15.720]  it's it's what how well you behave and then it gets into your carbon credit system and by the way
[03:27:15.720 --> 03:27:21.160]  you got an apple device look it up apple's got a social credit score on you already and now here's
[03:27:21.160 --> 03:27:32.040]  the big push the big promise from elan musker nuts um so what what you know taken to fruition in the
[03:27:32.040 --> 03:27:47.160]  hopefully benign scenario um the this means uh a future of abundance a future where um there is no
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:55.800]  people you can have whatever you want you can have whatever you want you can have whatever
[03:27:55.800 --> 03:28:03.080]  you want no more poverty again he even kind of shrugs into the benign sense when it has
[03:28:03.080 --> 03:28:12.760]  any of this stuff ever been used in the benign sense look mrna technology in some cases could
[03:28:12.760 --> 03:28:18.840]  be empowering humanity what did the establishment use it for well on the other side of this i'm

[03:29:09.480 --> 03:29:14.520]  out they were supplying almost all the raw materials to the companies that we were already
[03:29:14.520 --> 03:29:19.800]  using so we've gone directly to the stores and that means we can give you lower prices
[03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:24.360]  on the very same high quality supplements and in some cases even better introducing

[03:29:59.160 --> 03:30:07.800]  riders and satirists in mines famously said more than 150 years ago rumors of his demise
[03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:12.680]  had been greatly exaggerated because the newspapers kept saying he died decades before he did die
[03:30:13.320 --> 03:30:19.160]  and it's the same scyop today info wars is more influential and more powerful than ever because
[03:30:19.160 --> 03:30:24.360]  of your support because the facts of what we've covered is coming true but if they can convince
[03:30:24.360 --> 03:30:29.480]  you we've been shut down if they can convince you that we're going away and you stop supporting
[03:30:29.480 --> 03:30:34.360]  you stop spreading the word then they do win ladies and gentlemen there's only one group
[03:30:34.360 --> 03:30:38.520]  of people that could shut down info wars and that's you the viewers and listeners if you
[03:30:38.520 --> 03:30:42.840]  decide we're done we're done if you decide to go to info wars store.com against supplements and

[03:31:39.640 --> 03:31:44.360]  go to infowarstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[03:31:44.360 --> 03:31:48.200]  all at the same time keep us on air i know that less than one percent of our listeners
[03:31:48.200 --> 03:31:52.840]  actually go buy products at infowarstore.com if just one percent more of you took action and went
[03:31:52.840 --> 03:31:57.720]  to infowarstore.com our funding problems will be over please take action now the second american
[03:31:57.720 --> 03:32:04.040]  revolution is happening right now against the new world order and the answer to their 1984 tyranny
[03:32:04.040 --> 03:32:11.320]  is the 1776 mindset and info wars embodies that fight for human liberty against globalist tyranny
[03:32:11.320 --> 03:32:17.640]  now in the last year we've done a very successful fundraiser of silver coins when you buy the coin
[03:32:17.640 --> 03:32:22.920]  you know that you are supporting the transmission and you get a historical momento so you can
[03:32:22.920 --> 03:32:28.200]  remember the great contribution you made to freedom now despite the fact that the coins are selling out
[03:32:28.200 --> 03:32:34.360]  the last of the four coin series teddy roosevelt man the arena we're offering it for $30 off right
[03:32:34.360 --> 03:32:41.160]  now while supplies last at 1776coin.com and just like an npr pledge drive where they mark up a coffee
[03:32:41.160 --> 03:32:47.960]  cup or a t-shirt or a dvd 300 that's what we've done with this because it's a fundraiser but despite
[03:32:47.960 --> 03:32:55.880]  that we're offering $30 off exclusively at 1776 on what coins remain please go to 1776coin.com right
[03:32:55.880 --> 03:33:05.080]  now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[03:33:12.360 --> 03:33:17.400]  we are back it is the alex joneshow i am jason bermus sitting in and one of the biggest reasons
[03:33:18.040 --> 03:33:24.360]  that i am focused on transhumanism that i am focused on the internet of bodies and not so
[03:33:24.360 --> 03:33:29.000]  much the internet of things the internet of things is over it's in place it's something
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:35.560]  i was talking about a decade plus ago as they were refining it and have now refined it what we
[03:33:35.560 --> 03:33:44.600]  need to be discussing is this next step of automation and biomedical tyranny on a level
[03:33:44.600 --> 03:33:50.760]  most people think is just science fiction but let me tell you right now new stories are telling you
[03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:57.000]  otherwise all right anybody can look this stuff up right now this is about three weeks old you're
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:04.360]  having social robot market exploding what does that mean all right and that's just 2023 to 2035
[03:34:04.360 --> 03:34:11.800]  so they're telling you it's taking off now well other than the ai and the bots and spot the DARPA
[03:34:11.800 --> 03:34:21.800]  robot and eventually optimists if they have their way they want that automated car in their vehicles
[03:34:21.800 --> 03:34:28.760]  all right so much automation and robotics and what else are they bringing in the genetic testing
[03:34:28.760 --> 03:34:37.320]  market all right that's that's going to surpass 28 billion within five years these are the new
[03:34:37.320 --> 03:34:43.080]  markets because your biology is the market that's how stakeholder capitalism works that's how the
[03:34:43.080 --> 03:34:49.080]  internet of bodies works that's how the fourth industrial revolution works and i honestly
[03:34:49.080 --> 03:34:55.720]  thought they would try to institute global governance as more of a solidified unit but
[03:34:55.720 --> 03:35:01.880]  they've instituted their new world order on so many levels and now in westernized nations like
[03:35:01.880 --> 03:35:07.480]  canada and australia in a manner most people could never believe and don't worry they're trying to
[03:35:07.480 --> 03:35:18.840]  bring it here aside um from their uh their absurd and ridiculous blockchain okay looking into cbdcs
[03:35:18.840 --> 03:35:24.360]  which is dangerous enough this right here tells you they're looking to build an economy out of
[03:35:24.360 --> 03:35:30.600]  your biology we need to develop a genetic engineering technology and technique to be able to write
[03:35:30.600 --> 03:35:35.560]  circuitry for cells and predictably program biology in the same way in which we write
[03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:41.960]  software and program computers and again and again and again in their own papers that's
[03:35:42.600 --> 03:35:51.800]  how they describe it okay so what i want to do now is i want to play the maderna ceo again
[03:35:51.800 --> 03:35:59.240]  this is a company that had nothing going for it no no no products partners with the defense department
[03:35:59.240 --> 03:36:07.240]  in 2013 i'm going to show you the documentation and lo and behold covid 1984 saves them and they
[03:36:07.240 --> 03:36:13.560]  laugh about it here as they tell you about the new injection that's going to help with heart attacks
[03:36:13.560 --> 03:36:21.640]  you can't make this up as you say cardiology we have now in a clinic uh super exciting program
[03:36:21.640 --> 03:36:27.960]  when we inject mRNA in people's heart after heart attack to grow back new blood vessels to help
[03:36:27.960 --> 03:36:32.760]  revascularize the heart so it's a bit like science fiction medicine but that's what is really exciting
[03:36:32.760 --> 03:36:38.680]  to me but the the other side of this is that right now maderna though it has this pipeline
[03:36:39.320 --> 03:36:45.560]  has one commercial product and that's the spike facts that's the actual covid vaccination so
[03:36:45.560 --> 03:36:51.160]  that's the irony of covid is it really has in some ways allowed you to go and develop these other
[03:36:51.160 --> 03:36:56.680]  areas because of the revenues it came through the door you're 100 right you're a hundred percent
[03:36:56.680 --> 03:37:03.560]  right now imagine a world that you live in okay just imagine it you know that it's not fiction
[03:37:04.360 --> 03:37:08.040]  but but you gotta do some imagining because it's tough it's tough to understand this
[03:37:08.600 --> 03:37:17.240]  all right where elan musk prints up a bunch of mRNA shots through cure vac okay all right
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:25.400]  through cure vac in tesla does that based on a spike protein okay from a virus that you just
[03:37:25.400 --> 03:37:31.640]  can't believe it but the virus itself i'm sorry that's that's not what i was looking for i believe
[03:37:31.640 --> 03:37:38.280]  it's right here yes they find that maderna has a patent in 2016 after they partner with the defense
[03:37:38.280 --> 03:37:45.240]  department that has a chunk of dna i believe it is a 12 sequence dna nucleotide identical to the
[03:37:45.240 --> 03:37:54.520]  virus and the defense department has no reason to tell you the truth ever okay ever ever ever
[03:37:54.520 --> 03:38:04.040]  ever and they start the partnership okay for mRNA what to go after pandemics and engineered biological
[03:38:04.040 --> 03:38:10.600]  weapons even in the case where the infectious agent or pathogen is unknown this is their own
[03:38:10.600 --> 03:38:16.840]  press release it's on their own website take a look everybody and then on top of that so they
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:23.160]  partner in 2013 two and a half years later they patent a cancer drug mRNA drug because
[03:38:23.160 --> 03:38:29.640]  everybody knows at this point okay that these are drugs they specifically tell you that they are not
[03:38:29.640 --> 03:38:38.040]  vaccines in any way shape or form at all okay at all they're not the same thing the idea of using
[03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:44.200]  mRNA drugs is quite different these are synthetic compounds that can be designed and manufactured
[03:38:44.200 --> 03:38:51.320]  in just about three weeks based on what the genetic coding that they're doing with crisper tech
[03:38:51.320 --> 03:38:59.160]  and then they partner okay their strategic collaborators astrazeneca murk vertex barda
[03:38:59.160 --> 03:39:06.040]  darpa bill and melinda gates foundation carolinska institute and institute past pastore now
[03:39:07.000 --> 03:39:17.080]  amazingly amazingly you had a man won the nobel prize okay luke montanier who's now passed away
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:25.000]  saying hey there's actually hiv components in the virus so now you've got what that weird sequence
[03:39:25.880 --> 03:39:33.080]  that weird sequence that comes from a patent of moderna after they get with the defense
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:39.800]  department and it also has hiv in it nothing suspicious there nothing suspicious there and
[03:39:39.800 --> 03:39:43.720]  then they try to sell you on the leak theory on top of that you think yourself well wait a minute
[03:39:43.720 --> 03:39:48.440]  if you're going to get injected with anything that resembles this virus maybe you should be
[03:39:48.440 --> 03:39:54.600]  worried about hiv and autoimmune disorders we talk a lot about the heart stuff right and that's
[03:39:54.600 --> 03:39:58.520]  coming out in public and it's hilarious to the moderna guy they now have a heart medication
[03:39:58.520 --> 03:40:05.640]  hahaha that's only been made possible by this whole thing right but you have forbes articles
[03:40:05.640 --> 03:40:14.840]  forbes in uh october of 2020 warning people of their risk of hiv infection from some of these
[03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:21.320]  all right and then what happened that was in the lancet and then they said some of them induced
[03:40:21.320 --> 03:40:35.240]  false positive hiv test results so am i allowed to ask why a biologically engineered virus
[03:40:35.240 --> 03:40:43.000]  period that has connections to the defense department and hiv those same people get to inject
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:50.120]  you later through the emergency use authorization act and nobody can be sued well it's sounds
[03:40:50.120 --> 03:40:56.440]  sounds reasonable right so you may mistake these two guys so that's the moderna guy okay that's
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:41:03.160]  the moderna guy and by the way i have him on camera um being questioned about that um association
[03:41:03.160 --> 03:41:08.200]  i could play that as well about that uh 12 sequence dna nucleotides like oh our experts
[03:41:08.200 --> 03:41:13.000]  are looking into it it could have been a leak hahaha and again no leak i don't believe a leak
[03:41:13.000 --> 03:41:18.440]  theory at all i'm talking about engineered bio weapon that was what seeded on humanity
[03:41:18.440 --> 03:41:23.720]  that's what happened and then a ton of other things facilitate this from false tests to
[03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:28.360]  telling you what that the flu disappeared for the first time in humanity i mean you think
[03:41:28.360 --> 03:41:34.840]  that that had that jason that couldn't have happened guys weho said it npr put out a thing
[03:41:34.840 --> 03:41:41.400]  and when i say gone i mean gone i think think about this number 2019 2020 flu season 400
[03:41:41.400 --> 03:41:47.160]  000 people were hospitalized all right as of february including 22 000 deaths by the way
[03:41:47.160 --> 03:41:55.160]  165 flu related hospitalizations from october to february for four months not 165 000 which
[03:41:55.160 --> 03:42:01.480]  would be suspect enough because it would be more than half disappeared 165 and by the way 400 000
[03:42:01.480 --> 03:42:09.320]  that's a round number it's a round number all right when we come back we're we're going to uh
[03:42:09.320 --> 03:42:17.000]  play uh albert berella talking about uh with the davos crowd this new biomedical tyranny you will
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:23.320]  comply with the medicine we give you i'm going to be showing you other aspects of that biomedical
[03:42:23.320 --> 03:42:30.200]  tyranny via darpa the defense department this is the real deal we back everything we say up here
[03:42:30.200 --> 03:42:36.760]  with documentation facts and people quoting it i'm so glad alex is playing that netanyahu clip
[03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:42.120]  because israel's on board the saudi's are on board the united states are on board the davos crowd
[03:42:42.120 --> 03:42:48.600]  is on board and right now they are currently trying to enslave humanity fight back join alex

[03:47:03.960 --> 03:47:18.360]  alex jones final segment of the alex joneshow i am jason bermas in the fourth hour i want everybody
[03:47:18.360 --> 03:47:22.760]  to check this clip out because as relevant of rebel news who i think is doing some excellent
[03:47:22.760 --> 03:47:29.960]  work i'm so glad that him and his crew are over at davos referenced this clip and we're actually
[03:47:29.960 --> 03:47:38.200]  going to take it even further than what the feiser ceo has to say here with compliance in this new
[03:47:38.200 --> 03:47:47.480]  internet of bodies world this new transhumanist medical fascist techno nightmare it is a basically
[03:47:47.480 --> 03:47:54.440]  biological seep that it is in the tablet and once you take the tablet and dissolves into your
[03:47:54.440 --> 03:48:00.600]  stomach set sends a signal but you took the tablet so imagine the applications of that compliance
[03:48:01.320 --> 03:48:05.400]  the insurance companies to know that the medicines that patients should take they do
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:13.160]  take them it is fascinating what happens in in this field yeah i bet you it's fascinating
[03:48:13.160 --> 03:48:22.360]  the medicines they should take they do compliance compliance that's what it's really about and you
[03:48:22.360 --> 03:48:26.200]  know we talk about things they might want to inject in you in this future i just want to
[03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:32.280]  show you some of the public technology because i'm going to be showing you a grand brain computer
[03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:38.920]  interface document that's going to take the technology of injecting you with materials
[03:48:38.920 --> 03:48:47.480]  that can be what manipulated through radio waves and magnetic waves as well as something
[03:48:47.480 --> 03:48:53.080]  like that this is the public stuff they're showing you right here this is the magnetic slime they're
[03:48:53.080 --> 03:48:59.800]  already manipulating it they're showing you how they can bring it uh into your body and it can
[03:48:59.800 --> 03:49:07.000]  basically um go root out undesirables take it out non-surgically right this is the public stuff it
[03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:14.120]  is so much further than this and what do i mean by that well let's take a look at this all right
[03:49:14.120 --> 03:49:20.600]  this is a publicly available document i think 2018 or 2019 we just scrolled down a little bit now
[03:49:20.600 --> 03:49:25.960]  we've been talking a lot of DARPA because they like to partner with big pharma but right here
[03:49:25.960 --> 03:49:34.200]  okay i'm going to read it verbatim another DARPA program the next generation non-surgical
[03:49:34.200 --> 03:49:41.800]  neuro technology program involves a non-invasive system capable of reading from and writing to
[03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:47.400]  multiple points in the brain at once remember that whole right privilege of your genetics here you go
[03:49:48.200 --> 03:49:55.480]  a natural extension from research that aims to read brain signals and send or implant information
[03:49:55.480 --> 03:50:01.960]  in the brain to brain uh in the brain is brain to brain communication with funding uh from the
[03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:07.160]  arl researchers at the university of washington conducted a pilot study of non-invasive system
[03:50:07.160 --> 03:50:14.200]  that uses EEG to read basic brain signals transmit them over the internet and then transfer motor
[03:50:14.200 --> 03:50:21.800]  responses to a second user using transcranial magnetic stimulation the signals represent
[03:50:21.800 --> 03:50:26.840]  very basic actions in the context of simple video game moves such as right or left nonetheless
[03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:32.120]  especially given that these signals are transferred over the internet the potential to send even basic
[03:50:32.120 --> 03:50:38.600]  thoughts across the internet inherently presents many opportunities and many risks
[03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:44.120]  compared concerning security and ethics no kidding they're doing it anyway
[03:50:46.360 --> 03:50:53.480]  they're not worried about the ethics i promise you so let's see how far publicly DARPA already is
[03:50:54.200 --> 03:50:59.800]  and what you're about to watch is uh really the gentleman that was kind of in charge of
[03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:05.000]  a lot of the aspects of operation warp speed the guy who was supposed to take pandemics off the
[03:51:05.000 --> 03:51:12.040]  table okay and he is very happy about this tech hello uh i'm colonel matt heppern i'm a program
[03:51:12.040 --> 03:51:18.360]  manager in the biological technologies office uh at DARPA i am a active duty army infectious
[03:51:18.360 --> 03:51:25.400]  diseases physician and have specialized in uh addressing biological threats um that can either
[03:51:25.400 --> 03:51:32.840]  be engineered or naturally occurring such as ebola or pandemic influenza or exactly what we
[03:51:32.840 --> 03:51:39.800]  discussed with the partnership of what maderna and DARPA DARPA again infectious diseases and
[03:51:39.800 --> 03:51:47.480]  biologically engineered organisms today we're going here is their biological chip solution to
[03:51:47.480 --> 03:51:53.960]  monitoring everything in your body to be talking about one of the technologies that i actively
[03:51:53.960 --> 03:52:00.680]  manage a company called profusa which is aiming at achieving tissue level continuous health
[03:52:00.680 --> 03:52:07.720]  monitoring through the spi r program we funded them to solve a incredible technical challenge
[03:52:07.720 --> 03:52:13.880]  that no one else had been previously able to solve the key innovation that was presented to us as
[03:52:13.880 --> 03:52:21.000]  they said why can't we make a chemical substance that's really identical to what's underneath
[03:52:21.000 --> 03:52:27.560]  the skin what we call the subcutaneous tissue so that your body doesn't recognize it as a foreign
[03:52:27.560 --> 03:52:34.520]  body response it just incorporates itself into the tissue and we have a lot of examples now
[03:52:35.080 --> 03:52:41.880]  where a sensor put right underneath the skin can sense things like oxygen and other chemicals
[03:52:41.880 --> 03:52:48.440]  that are very important to our metabolism and i mean we're talking about the gamut all right
[03:52:48.440 --> 03:52:53.640]  so it can biologically read these things out not for days or months but years i'm going to
[03:52:53.640 --> 03:52:58.520]  fast forward because i only got a few minutes left and i want to play for you right now
[03:52:59.560 --> 03:53:05.160]  rand the same people behind that document talking about the internet of bodies openly
[03:53:05.160 --> 03:53:09.560]  and and what this kind of technology actually means especially if they incorporate it into
[03:53:09.560 --> 03:53:15.320]  the economy that they way that the way they want to do it and get rid of cash transactions that's
[03:53:15.320 --> 03:53:22.600]  the end of individual freedom that's the end really of us as a species as they try to usher us
[03:53:22.600 --> 03:53:29.400]  into a virtual nightmare as well in the 20th century wireless technology integrated with the
[03:53:29.400 --> 03:53:37.320]  human body was nothing more than science fiction but today wi-fi connected devices like heart rate
[03:53:37.320 --> 03:53:44.280]  monitors and sleep trackers have become common parts of american life how has bionic technology
[03:53:44.280 --> 03:53:50.520]  evolved so quickly from science fiction to reality and what could this internet of bodies
[03:53:50.520 --> 03:53:57.240]  mean for our lives moving forward rand researchers are studying this phenomenon and what consumers
[03:53:57.240 --> 03:54:04.520]  and policymakers need to know as we veer into uncharted territory the internet of bodies or iob
[03:54:04.520 --> 03:54:10.920]  is um is actually an ecosystem it's a bunch of devices that are connected to the internet that
[03:54:10.920 --> 03:54:18.360]  contain software and that either collect personal health data about you or can alter the body's
[03:54:18.360 --> 03:54:24.200]  function we think of the internet of bodies as this collection of all these devices as well as
[03:54:24.200 --> 03:54:30.040]  all the data that the devices are gathering about you and in health care it's internet of bodies has
[03:54:30.040 --> 03:54:35.320]  has been around for quite a while with the advent of the internet it makes a lot of sense to connect
[03:54:35.320 --> 03:54:41.320]  your pacemaker to the internet so that your doctor can be automatically notified if if something weird
[03:54:41.320 --> 03:54:46.920]  happens if there's an anomaly it's natural in a lot of ways to want to understand more about your
[03:54:46.920 --> 03:54:52.600]  body how it functions how well it's doing we're gonna stop it there but she actually does warn
[03:54:52.600 --> 03:54:58.520]  people that there's really no laws on who collects the data or what they do with the data you notice
[03:54:58.520 --> 03:55:05.560]  she talked about access to these devices not only just reading them but making them do things all right
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:12.600]  this is another aspect of that and and eventually you know really they want you in this virtual world
[03:55:12.600 --> 03:55:17.640]  so transhumanism they want to use all this biological technology and the nice things they're
[03:55:17.640 --> 03:55:25.800]  doing to everybody to what use it so that they can live in these uigui flesh bodies for the most
[03:55:25.800 --> 03:55:31.560]  part forever the technological fountain of youth well you believe as you merge with machines and
[03:55:31.560 --> 03:55:37.000]  all these different devices that you can somehow upload your consciousness to the cloud that's
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:42.360]  what Rothblatt's selling you on that's what Kurzweil who by the way is the head of calico the
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:48.120]  immortality division at google again you can't make that up absolutely there uh here they're
[03:55:48.120 --> 03:55:52.520]  talking about going from theory to practice just like musk wants to bring people in metaverse
[03:55:52.520 --> 03:55:58.440]  governance generating economic and societal value and if you look at this map it's very hard to see
[03:55:58.440 --> 03:56:04.120]  here global governance is right behind me above my head now but this one right here global governance
[03:56:04.120 --> 03:56:10.760]  part of their agenda this is all the same thing sustainability eco agenda virtual agenda you
[03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:15.480]  know you talk about that nasa document i'm just going to go to the one page it's right here this
[03:56:15.480 --> 03:56:21.560]  is in 2001 they said the bio nano era starts for humankind in 2020 injected billions of people with
[03:56:21.560 --> 03:56:26.840]  bio nano tech they did it all right and then they want to bring you into that virtual world
[03:56:27.640 --> 03:56:34.840]  these demons like claus nut Schwab and the gang they want to create a system where you're a blockchain
[03:56:34.840 --> 03:56:41.240]  person and they openly brag about it they say they're going to help you at the refugee camp isn't
[03:56:41.240 --> 03:56:47.880]  that nice of them isn't that the best the whole refugee camp that they run without physical money
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:52.920]  you're in a tent it takes your biometric information davos loves you guys you'll be
[03:56:52.920 --> 03:56:56.600]  part of the world food program they're going to save a bunch of money they're going to get
[03:56:56.600 --> 03:57:03.880]  you work in the slave line it's right here this is the fourth industrial revolution that they
[03:57:03.880 --> 03:57:10.040]  have planned for you total track trace database not only on the outside which they've achieved in
[03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:18.520]  large part but on the inside as well to push their predator class anti-human transhuman new
[03:57:18.520 --> 03:57:24.920]  world order agenda it is the alex jones show now more than ever is the time to support info wars
