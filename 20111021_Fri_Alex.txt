[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother, mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:22.280]  Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.280 --> 00:29.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got to move quick today because this is going
[00:29.480 --> 00:37.080]  to be an absolutely jam-packed Friday broadcast. Then, I'm going to be gone for most of the
[00:37.080 --> 00:42.640]  weekend into Monday, shooting different, not even episodes, because we're out in the field
[00:42.640 --> 00:49.840]  and doing interviews. It is reality TV, real investigations. I'm going to be out with Jesse
[00:49.840 --> 00:55.440]  Ventura in the West. I'll just leave it at that. And I'll have some reports from on the
[00:55.440 --> 01:05.280]  ground here on the show, at least Monday, maybe even Sunday, popping in. And then I
[01:05.280 --> 01:10.320]  will need to spend some time with my children. I think I'm getting back Monday evening. So,
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.160]  we'll see what's going to happen. I mean, well, I'm just going to leave it at that for now.
[01:16.160 --> 01:23.680]  So, stay with us on that front. We're going to have open phones today. We've got Bob Chapman
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.240]  joining us, as he always does on Friday. He wasn't with us last Friday, so we have a lot
[01:28.240 --> 01:33.480]  to cover when he joins us today on the economic front, on what's happening in the Euro that
[01:33.480 --> 01:41.560]  affects our dollar and our Depressionary Spiral here in the United States as well.
[01:41.560 --> 01:49.920]  We are also going to be joined by Naomi Wolf, who was arrested at Occupy Wall Street just
[01:49.920 --> 01:54.120]  briefly at the bottom of the hour to get her take on Occupy Wall Street and the different
[01:54.120 --> 02:03.760]  things that they are basically calling for. But in the meantime, I'm going to cover the
[02:03.760 --> 02:16.320]  news and also take your phone calls. The level of naked out in the open treason that is going
[02:16.320 --> 02:21.120]  on is mind-boggling. And when you realize this is something tyrants do on purpose that it's
[02:21.120 --> 02:26.800]  a process, a processes of breaking your will, it's just staggering to think about what's
[02:26.800 --> 02:35.760]  coming next in this Republic. The confirmation that the majority of stimulus money is going
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.880]  to actually move U.S. companies offshore. And that's in mainstream media. They even
[02:42.880 --> 02:48.920]  throw at your face in ABC News, CBS, you name it. That's coming up. The first story I'm
[02:48.920 --> 02:57.640]  going to get into after the break today. Also, Union President testifies this on C-SPAN that
[02:57.640 --> 03:08.520]  ICE headquarters ordered agents not to arrest illegals, including fugitives. And that dovetails
[03:08.520 --> 03:14.040]  with this story out of Fox. Senators draft bill to give visas to foreigners buying pricey
[03:14.040 --> 03:20.760]  homes in the United States. Now, you add this together with the hundreds of articles where
[03:20.760 --> 03:27.360]  they do staged arrest of illegals in the last three years and then release them or give
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.320]  them green cards on the spot or two months ago when Obama froze deportations of even
[03:34.320 --> 03:38.520]  violent offenders and they said they will decide now. They'll ignore federal law. They'll
[03:38.520 --> 03:46.560]  just decide if you're deported or not. And then I'm trying to drive through the middle
[03:46.560 --> 03:53.360]  of Texas and they demanded to board my bus this weekend. I aired it last night. I'm going
[03:53.360 --> 04:00.760]  to air it again today. They demanded to get on board my RV and I had to threaten them
[04:00.760 --> 04:06.360]  to sue them and had to say, look, I know the government brings in the most of the drugs
[04:06.360 --> 04:12.280]  and had to really, really get in their face to have them back off. And I've got a bunch
[04:12.280 --> 04:18.160]  of news articles here without even looking for them. The guys found them where all over
[04:18.160 --> 04:25.440]  the country, California, Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, they're just having warrantless checkpoints
[04:25.440 --> 04:30.800]  now. Courts of rule they can't do this so they eat around the edges. Well, it's a seat
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.840]  belt check or it's a, now they just admit we're searching your car, we're looking for
[04:34.840 --> 04:38.240]  drugs, we're looking for terrorists. Well, how about we go look at government buildings
[04:38.240 --> 04:41.860]  for terrorists? I mean, why are you innocent until proven guilty? But we're guilty until
[04:41.860 --> 04:46.560]  proven innocent. You know, when I confronted the border patrol 98 miles inside the U.S.,
[04:46.560 --> 04:51.480]  I said, you know, the border patrol has been caught dealing drugs. I ought to search you.
[04:51.480 --> 04:55.560]  I mean, if anybody's proven themselves to be a bunch of criminals, it's this government.
[04:55.560 --> 05:00.280]  Stop teaching me I'm bad. See, it's a mind game.
[05:00.280 --> 05:05.120]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect. Alex has told you about the amazing, great tasting,

[06:01.680 --> 06:06.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[06:06.200 --> 06:08.560]  chance to not relive history.
[06:08.560 --> 06:12.920]  These are finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[06:12.920 --> 06:13.920]  at home.
[06:13.920 --> 06:18.560]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are
[06:18.560 --> 06:19.640]  calling the shots.
[06:19.640 --> 06:24.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[06:24.840 --> 06:30.360]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal off-short cartel
[06:30.360 --> 06:35.040]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[06:35.040 --> 06:39.400]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[06:39.400 --> 06:41.360]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[06:41.360 --> 06:46.960]  Today it seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[06:46.960 --> 06:48.800]  a fall of the Republic.

[07:04.960 --> 07:08.320]  savings, opportunity, and recognized risk.

[07:17.200 --> 07:19.320]  good as what you're using now.

[07:26.720 --> 07:32.360]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores,

[08:01.960 --> 08:29.160]  It is Friday, the 21st day of October 2011. We are going to be live here for the next
[08:29.160 --> 08:36.480]  three hours. Naomi Wolf, who was arrested at Occupied Wall Street, will give us her perspective
[08:36.480 --> 08:41.320]  in a brief interview coming up at the bottom of the hour. We'll get her take on it as a
[08:41.320 --> 08:48.400]  Rhodes Scholar and as an establishment leftist who has criticized the police state of George
[08:48.400 --> 08:55.200]  W. Bush and now of Barack Obama. She's one of the more fair people out there. So we want
[08:55.200 --> 09:01.280]  to get her perspective on it. The best selling author joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[09:01.280 --> 09:05.800]  We've got Bob Chapman popping in as he does every Friday on the big economic developments
[09:05.800 --> 09:10.280]  in Europe and around the world. The admission now that this country by more and more economists
[09:10.280 --> 09:16.200]  is in a depression, never left the deep recession. And this is an engineered implosion of our
[09:16.200 --> 09:23.640]  society. We'll also talk with Bob about the $79 trillion that's in even USA Today and
[09:23.640 --> 09:28.100]  Reuters. Bloomberg broke it two days ago. I know I've been mentioning it the last few
[09:28.100 --> 09:37.800]  days because it's a big deal. $79 trillion in additional derivatives now that has been
[09:37.800 --> 09:44.160]  moved over to the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation and William K. Black, the former
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.840]  top federal regulator that prosecuted a lot of these crooks in the last round 15 years
[09:48.840 --> 09:55.320]  ago. He's come out and said this will be the destruction of Bank of America and with it,
[09:55.320 --> 10:03.200]  the U.S. economy, they're going to sign us on to $79 trillion and they're going to have
[10:03.200 --> 10:11.960]  Herman Cain on the fake right pushing $999999. In fact, there's an article out today. It's
[10:11.960 --> 10:17.200]  up at info wars.com by Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital. I'm going to work on getting
[10:17.200 --> 10:23.560]  him on the nightly news tonight saying the hidden nine of Herman Cain. That's right because
[10:23.560 --> 10:28.720]  there's the 9% that they're going to have for the income tax. He doesn't discuss the
[10:28.720 --> 10:35.400]  9% or so for Social Security FICA. He doesn't support the employee matching, an employer
[10:35.400 --> 10:40.920]  matching of that. Oh, you didn't know employers have to match that. So you're getting paid
[10:40.920 --> 10:47.720]  $20 an hour. You're really getting paid about $26, $27 an hour, but that money's paid to
[10:47.720 --> 10:51.520]  the government. Not counting the money they then take out of your check on top of it.
[10:51.520 --> 10:56.600]  See, it's all this hidden taxation you don't see till you actually write the checks. I
[10:56.600 --> 11:01.560]  write the checks. I see it all. A lot of people say, Alex, you ought to just tell the IRS
[11:01.560 --> 11:07.280]  that's private and works for the private fellow reserve to go to Hades. We pick our battles
[11:07.280 --> 11:14.080]  here, ladies and gentlemen. The federal courts have a 98% conviction rate. Federal courts
[11:14.080 --> 11:21.400]  sent its black people to death 160, 70 years ago who ran away from their plantations. So
[11:21.400 --> 11:27.640]  I'm going to pick my battles. They have rigged juries, total criminals running them. Most
[11:27.640 --> 11:31.920]  of them on the take. Most of the government is criminal narcotics traffickers or paid
[11:31.920 --> 11:37.320]  by that $500 billion a year. They used to pay their criminal army. And so I follow all
[11:37.320 --> 11:46.200]  the fake rules, all the fake laws, all the fake garbage so I can be 100% strong and up
[11:46.200 --> 11:55.520]  front here covering real information. Now, I do confront naked body scanners. I do confront
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.760]  internal checkpoints and get in the police face and say no to that because it's an absolute
[12:00.760 --> 12:08.480]  clear and present hard core manifestation of classical tyranny. But when you get down
[12:08.480 --> 12:16.040]  to the king's men and the taxation system, that is something that we languish under.
[12:16.040 --> 12:27.720]  But I'm now digressing. The point is that the globalists are basically exempt from taxation
[12:27.720 --> 12:36.040]  and regulation. And they want to jack up taxes now to pay down the derivatives bubble that
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.080]  they've had their operatives that they spent decades getting into every power position
[12:40.080 --> 12:48.960]  in every regulatory position at the SEC, Congress, Federal Reserve and Treasury. And they're
[12:48.960 --> 12:53.640]  dropping the hammer. They always intended to saddle us with their debt. They bought the
[12:53.640 --> 12:59.240]  world through fraud with the Ponzi money. But then holding the world hostage, they bring
[12:59.240 --> 13:04.640]  us fully under their economic control and give the private banks governance powers, as
[13:04.640 --> 13:08.880]  is now happening with the Super Congress here in the US, as is now happening with the Euro
[13:08.880 --> 13:17.480]  takeover in Europe. It's here. Full Bankster occupation, full domination, the end of America,
[13:17.480 --> 13:24.120]  the end of liberty, total tyranny and a physical oppression with domestic police, domestic
[13:24.120 --> 13:29.720]  secret police, domestic federal police, local police, federalized deputies, spying threat
[13:29.720 --> 13:34.400]  fusion centers. They're in the news now admitting what we've done for 20 years. The Pentagon's
[13:34.400 --> 13:38.720]  got ground penetrating radar looking through all your walls. The police departments are
[13:38.720 --> 13:43.360]  getting trucks now that look right through your walls and also blast you with high powered
[13:43.360 --> 13:50.080]  radiation and radio waves, sound waves. There's a bunch of different types of systems they
[13:50.080 --> 13:54.240]  have. That's in mainstream media today. They're just getting ready to tell the slaves about
[13:54.240 --> 14:00.320]  it. Again, they're reporting checkpoints all over the country. They're just going to continue
[14:00.320 --> 14:07.800]  to roll it out, roll it out, roll it out and flaunt it in your face. Just Sunday, it happened
[14:07.800 --> 14:12.040]  again, 100 mile, 98 mile into the country checkpoint. I'm going to play that video later
[14:12.040 --> 14:19.320]  in audio here from what happened Sunday because it integrates them with all this TSA checkpoint
[14:19.320 --> 14:25.680]  news that's in mainstream newspapers and TV stations. They're like, we're going to start
[14:25.680 --> 14:32.280]  your vehicle, 98 miles into the US. I said, this is a violation of my Fourth Amendment.
[14:32.280 --> 14:36.040]  They said, the Supreme Court has ruled. I said, the Supreme Court has ruled you can check
[14:36.040 --> 14:40.440]  immigration status. The Supreme Court has also ruled black people weren't humans. I don't
[14:40.440 --> 14:45.280]  want to hear it, but I said, you are here with a drug dog and you know they haven't ruled.
[14:45.280 --> 14:49.760]  You can have drug checkpoints and they know that. They know it's illegal. They know it's
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.920]  official oppression and a civil rights violation. He says, I'm not looking for drugs. I'm looking
[14:53.920 --> 15:00.080]  for narcotics. So that's the first thing I want to get into today. But coming up, Union
[15:00.080 --> 15:05.920]  President testifies ICE. I have the C-SPAN clip. ICE headquarters ordered agents not
[15:05.920 --> 15:11.200]  to arrest illegals, including fugitives. You know, I'd say, I don't know. I haven't really
[15:11.200 --> 15:20.200]  ever counted it up, but I'd say about 40% of my crew here at the office is Hispanic.
[15:20.200 --> 15:25.600]  And a bunch of them have told me that whenever they're driving through these checkpoints,
[15:25.600 --> 15:30.920]  98, 100 miles inside the border, if they're Hispanic or look Hispanic, it's just come
[15:30.920 --> 15:35.040]  on through because they don't want the trouble of illegals. And this has actually come out
[15:35.040 --> 15:42.120]  in the news. They're there just to shake everybody down. And it's incredible. So this
[15:42.120 --> 15:46.840]  has nothing to do. They do some show arrest of illegals here and there at a meat packing
[15:46.840 --> 15:51.080]  plant that isn't part of the inside group or they'll do a raid on a Walmart once and
[15:51.080 --> 15:55.520]  it came out, then give them green cards. That came out in the news again yesterday. CNS
[15:55.520 --> 16:01.800]  News had that. This is all coming out in Congress. And so they want to search my car and I'm
[16:01.800 --> 16:06.360]  like the border patrol has been caught in fast and furious shipping drugs in guns out
[16:06.360 --> 16:14.240]  with the ATF FBI and what six other it's eight agencies total. So five other agencies on
[16:14.240 --> 16:20.760]  top of those three. And I said, the game's over, bud. I don't use your products. I'm
[16:20.760 --> 16:25.600]  not the government that brings the drugs in here. And you're not going to do this, folks.
[16:25.600 --> 16:30.920]  They're getting ready under the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act. This is admitted.
[16:30.920 --> 16:34.520]  They're getting you used to government putting their hands on you. You've never been to jail.
[16:34.520 --> 16:40.320]  You're not a criminal. You know, you get up at about, you know, a cop walking over and
[16:40.320 --> 16:44.600]  asking you questions at the shopping mall or wherever you're like, why are you doing that?
[16:44.600 --> 16:47.480]  You're informed historically, you know, that's what happens in third world countries and
[16:47.480 --> 16:53.320]  Soviet, you know, Russia and places like that. They're just breaking the ice getting you
[16:53.320 --> 17:00.520]  used to blood draws at checkpoints, federalization of police, the feds at checkpoints, the feds
[17:00.520 --> 17:11.880]  at proms now, the feds at at the prom now. This is the type of stuff that's going on.
[17:11.880 --> 17:18.920]  This is right out of central casting of a corrupt, oppressive North Korean style system.
[17:18.920 --> 17:25.200]  This is the social engineers 100% consciously. You know, they've announced every airport
[17:25.200 --> 17:30.200]  in the US, every major airport will get naked body scanners and now Austin's getting them
[17:30.200 --> 17:35.760]  next month. And they're saying everyone will be forced through them. The TSA said in the
[17:35.760 --> 17:40.440]  Chicago Tribune, they said, we will force everyone starting next year. So first it's
[17:40.440 --> 17:48.960]  opt out, opt out and bearish you grab on you while the idiot TSA sits there frying themselves.
[17:48.960 --> 17:54.760]  None of this has anything to do. They've put out with terrorism. They've put Al Qaeda in
[17:54.760 --> 18:04.640]  charge of Libya on record. They have given them thousands of shoulder fired service to
[18:04.640 --> 18:10.800]  air missiles. They had Amaral Laki hanging out secretly at the Pentagon's. They want to
[18:10.800 --> 18:15.600]  add and add his staged killing so they could get him out of the headlines because he was
[18:15.600 --> 18:19.800]  an embarrassment. Believe me, that's why that happened. Now they're saying Gaddafi too will
[18:19.800 --> 18:24.320]  be buried at sea. Who knows if they really killed him in Uganda when US special forces
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.160]  were there and firefights and they claim they were down there for something else. Who knows
[18:28.160 --> 18:32.960]  if he's really is alive? Who knows if he's dead? I mean, first they said that in front
[18:32.960 --> 18:37.760]  of all the witnesses, they shot him, tortured him and shot him in the head, drove him around
[18:37.760 --> 18:42.400]  and there's videos of this on the hoods of cars. Now they say he died in a crossfire.
[18:42.400 --> 18:47.440]  They said Benazar Budo hit her head. There was footage of her being shot in Pakistan.
[18:47.440 --> 18:54.440]  But our media said she hit her head. She hit her little head. She came out and said to
[18:54.440 --> 19:00.560]  someone Ben Laden's been dead. This is all staged and they said that's it. She's dead.
[19:00.560 --> 19:05.240]  Hillary Clinton, we got a video clip of Hillary Clinton where she's joking about it. I came,
[19:05.240 --> 19:11.480]  I saw, I conquered. We came, we saw he's dead and she laughed about it. And I've noticed
[19:11.480 --> 19:17.320]  these tyrannical women, you know, they, they who've never been in a fistfight in their lives,
[19:17.320 --> 19:24.080]  they love throughout history, sitting back and watching people die and bombing and killing
[19:24.080 --> 19:29.560]  and the reporter, CBS reporter, cackles and gets off on it with her as well. Why don't
[19:29.560 --> 19:36.200]  you women go look at the wreck cities and the 40,000 dead people and the piles of dead
[19:36.200 --> 19:40.800]  blacks that the Al Qaeda's been killing and why don't you go watch, you know, the dead
[19:40.800 --> 19:45.620]  bodies piled up in the burned corpses and smell the dead flesh. Oh no, no, you'd rather
[19:45.620 --> 19:52.280]  sit there in your little palaces and giggle about the dead people. You know, just sit
[19:52.280 --> 19:58.840]  back with your white gloves on and ha ha ha ha ha ha. All right, stay with us. We got
[19:58.840 --> 20:00.520]  big news coming up.
[20:00.520 --> 20:06.980]  HempUSA.org has moved and expanded its operations for faster worldwide shipping. Our product
[20:06.980 --> 20:12.720]  line has grown from five to nearly 100 items in less than five years. Our food has grown
[20:12.720 --> 20:18.360]  naturally, always chemical free, not found in stores. Great for daily intake and perfect
[20:18.360 --> 20:27.640]  for your emergency storage shelter. Call 908-6912608 or visit HempUSA.org and see what our powders,
[20:27.640 --> 20:29.680]  seeds and oil can do for you.
[20:29.680 --> 20:33.880]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[20:33.880 --> 20:38.120]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[20:38.120 --> 20:42.240]  to serve as debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing
[20:42.240 --> 20:45.680]  the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing
[20:45.680 --> 20:46.680]  army?
[20:46.680 --> 20:50.240]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system. Call
[20:50.240 --> 21:01.160]  for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237.
[21:01.160 --> 21:06.280]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply. Folks, there
[21:06.280 --> 21:10.360]  are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think it's important for my listeners to
[21:10.360 --> 21:12.480]  do three things right away.
[21:12.480 --> 21:18.680]  Number one, study the past. History really does repeat itself. Number two, learn to spot
[21:18.680 --> 21:22.000]  the dangerous food shortage trends.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.880]  Number three, take decisive action. A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[21:28.880 --> 21:34.080]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves, warning
[21:34.080 --> 21:39.720]  signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history. Don't get caught unprepared when
[21:39.720 --> 21:46.040]  the crisis hits. This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also
[21:46.040 --> 21:51.080]  get a free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again,

[22:00.560 --> 22:05.040]  Our rights as individuals to freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under
[22:05.040 --> 22:10.840]  constant attack. The globalists want to ban all supplements formulated after 1994. Governments
[22:10.840 --> 22:15.600]  are hoarding raw materials, affecting our ability to purchase these products at a reasonable
[22:15.600 --> 22:20.880]  price. Even organic foods are stripped of nutrients due to overuse of soil and compromised
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.680]  growing conditions. Storeable foods are essential, but you also need to make sure you have the
[22:25.680 --> 22:31.200]  nutrients you need to stay healthy during emergencies. Go to survivalrx.com today and
[22:31.200 --> 22:36.560]  see the amazing line of storeable supplements they have to protect the ones you love. The
[22:36.560 --> 22:42.720]  owners of survivalrx.com have been in sports nutrition for over a decade and they realize
[22:42.720 --> 22:48.480]  the need for long term storeable vitamins. The result is a triple nitrogen flushing method
[22:48.480 --> 22:55.080]  which allows these vitamins to maintain their strength for decades. Again, go to survivalrx.com
[22:55.080 --> 22:59.280]  at survivalrx.com.
[22:59.280 --> 23:03.960]  Last July, a rare webinar was released that has since transformed lives all around the
[23:03.960 --> 23:10.200]  world. Now, viewed by over 100,000 people, the movement is growing stronger than ever.
[23:10.200 --> 23:15.720]  Waterwebinar.com. Find out how to take fluoride and heavy metals out of your water and your
[23:15.720 --> 23:22.080]  body. Go to waterwebinar.com now, sign up for the webinar and see the shocking video footage
[23:22.080 --> 23:27.600]  with your own eyes. A water secret so powerful, some have called it the number one threat
[23:27.600 --> 23:33.180]  to the entire New World Order health agenda. Use it to neutralize deadly inorganic particles
[23:33.180 --> 23:37.840]  like lead, aluminum and even mercury and remove these accumulated poisons from your
[23:37.840 --> 23:42.920]  body and your drinking water. You can take your water freedom into your own hands and
[23:42.920 --> 23:48.520]  defend yourself and your family from the globalist health agenda. See the webinar before it's
[23:48.520 --> 24:00.520]  taken off the web. There's still time. Go to www.waterwebinar.com now.
[24:00.520 --> 24:13.320]  That's right. Before you start watching your television, within about a minute, the trained
[24:13.320 --> 24:19.480]  mind, the TV trains your brain, goes into a rim-like, sleeping, waking, sleepwalking
[24:19.480 --> 24:26.840]  state. Scientific fact. In fact, Darren McBrain and Rob Doop put together an incredible subliminal
[24:26.840 --> 24:33.720]  message report last night showing subliminal messages in TV shows, ads, magazines, television
[24:33.720 --> 24:39.960]  ads, you name it. And by the way, we're going to have Peter Schiff on tonight on the Nightly
[24:39.960 --> 24:48.880]  News to break down the 999 plan because it's not really just 9% income tax, 9% VAT, 9%
[24:48.880 --> 24:52.660]  sales tax, which are two new taxes, the Federal Administrator. And it's not that they can
[24:52.660 --> 24:57.920]  just jack up the income tax once they lower it to 9, but you know they'll do. The income
[24:57.920 --> 25:05.760]  tax started at 1% for the top 1%. Then they're going to continue with the Social Security
[25:05.760 --> 25:13.840]  FICA part that's around 9%. And so you got 99999. And then they can just jack all those
[25:13.840 --> 25:18.960]  up. I mean, it is such a nightmare. And it's exactly what central banks, the very same
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.720]  big mega banks do through their central banks that masquerade as government all over the
[25:23.720 --> 25:30.040]  world. That's a big deal. And listen, you cannot expect these criminals to do anything
[25:30.040 --> 25:35.920]  but this. Once criminals have committed such monstrous level crimes, once they've gone
[25:35.920 --> 25:42.880]  for broke, once they've committed global assassinations and invaded now dozens of countries, it's
[25:42.880 --> 25:48.360]  over a dozen wars, not five, six, seven or eight that are going on right now. And I listed
[25:48.360 --> 25:51.560]  some of those with Tarpley yesterday. He was saying six, seven wars. And I went on and
[25:51.560 --> 25:59.200]  said, Mexico, Columbia, and just started listing other places that wars are going on. Once
[25:59.200 --> 26:05.160]  the elite gets to this point with corruption, you go off the edge. And that's why I have
[26:05.160 --> 26:09.080]  a Detroit Free Press article saying they've got checkpoints all over the state now searching
[26:09.080 --> 26:13.480]  people for drugs without warrants. And they're taking people's cell phones and downloading
[26:13.480 --> 26:19.760]  them into the police systems. And some of them are passive digital snoopers in the police
[26:19.760 --> 26:24.960]  cars that just grab the stuff off your phone as you drive by. And the paper says courts
[26:24.960 --> 26:31.120]  of rules, you can't do this. Why are they doing it? Because they don't care. They don't
[26:31.120 --> 26:38.080]  care anymore. Do you understand? An FBI agent couldn't stick their hands down your pants
[26:38.080 --> 26:43.160]  two years ago. The FBI won't do it today because they're actually following still, even though
[26:43.160 --> 26:48.480]  they're corrupt, the Constitution. They had to make a new agency, the TSA, that first
[26:48.480 --> 26:53.880]  grabs the outside, now the inside, and they say it's okay. And now federal judges have
[26:53.880 --> 26:59.720]  ruled, well, if your state police are searching people's pants, as long as they're TSA certified,
[26:59.720 --> 27:05.720]  it's okay. Or, oh, there's lawsuits over school proms, people doing TSA-style searches. This
[27:05.720 --> 27:13.000]  is now standard training for security. Both, and police will have TSA come in and oversee
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.960]  it, and certify you in Santa Fe. And now they can grab your 17-year-old daughter's breast
[27:20.960 --> 27:30.840]  and genitals, or your son. See, the TSA is a magic fairy. And Janet, the troll, Napolitano,
[27:30.840 --> 27:34.240]  who says she doesn't like my website, the Drudge Report calling her a troll, never calls
[27:34.240 --> 27:39.040]  you a troll. But if the name fits, you know, a troll's a troll by any other name, okay,
[27:39.040 --> 27:45.680]  you're a troll. Don't tell me what this, I don't care what you do, you witch. You don't
[27:45.680 --> 27:52.280]  tell me what to do, you monster. It's my first amendment, you pig, you anti-American pig.
[27:52.280 --> 28:01.200]  Excuse me. The point is, she floats around like a magic weasel, a magic weasel fairy,
[28:01.200 --> 28:08.840]  and waves a wand, and now there's no Fourth Amendment. I've got a big stack of news articles
[28:08.840 --> 28:13.440]  on that here, but all over the country, they want to search our cars for drugs or guns,
[28:13.440 --> 28:17.120]  just randomly, as if we're guilty and will prove it innocent. And then here is in the
[28:17.120 --> 28:30.120]  news, C-SPAN. Homeland Security told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday that they authorize
[28:30.120 --> 28:35.320]  illegals when they feel like it's work in the U.S. She ignores federal law. She is the
[28:35.320 --> 28:41.600]  fairy. She waves the wand, stick their hands down your pants, put you in a microwave oven.
[28:41.600 --> 28:47.120]  Apollo Tano, DHS authorizing illegal aliens to work in the U.S. Just what Obama did two,
[28:47.120 --> 28:52.760]  three months ago when he said, we will decide now to deport or whatever. I will ignore law.
[28:52.760 --> 28:57.200]  It's like saying, I'll decide if I prosecute murder or not, or I'll decide if I can kill
[28:57.200 --> 29:03.880]  U.S. citizens without a trial or arrest or not. It's total tyranny. Here's another one.
[29:03.880 --> 29:10.200]  And President testifies ICE headquarters ordered agents not to arrest illegals, including fugitives.
[29:10.200 --> 29:16.400]  I've known this for years, but here it is. They admit it to Congress. And then Orrin
[29:16.400 --> 29:22.200]  Hatch, I've got the article right here. He complains now that they're putting him in microwave
[29:22.200 --> 29:26.680]  oven scanners, even when he says, no, I don't want to, they order him to, and they've got
[29:26.680 --> 29:33.680]  other senators with Napolitano in there complaining about it. Well, as much as I don't like Napolitano,
[29:33.680 --> 29:41.000]  the Jack booted little miss Hitler. The point is, this all started under Bush, the $30 million
[29:41.000 --> 29:47.120]  contract that Benjamin, excuse me, that Michael Chertoff is getting for naked body scanners
[29:47.120 --> 29:54.680]  in Austin. And that's Bush. We're on the March, the empires on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:54.680 --> 30:03.320]  GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[30:03.320 --> 30:08.140]  a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[30:08.140 --> 30:12.960]  your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[30:12.960 --> 30:17.720]  electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity
[30:17.720 --> 30:22.800]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[30:22.800 --> 30:28.160]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[30:28.160 --> 30:32.840]  the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year
[30:32.840 --> 30:37.240]  thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar
[30:37.240 --> 30:41.840]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe
[30:41.840 --> 30:46.160]  in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[30:46.160 --> 30:53.080]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government
[30:53.080 --> 31:00.600]  doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[31:00.600 --> 31:07.600]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the
[31:07.600 --> 31:34.600]  unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[31:34.600 --> 31:46.080]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[31:46.080 --> 31:50.640]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can
[31:50.640 --> 31:57.680]  ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans, got it,
[31:57.680 --> 31:58.680]  others don't.
[31:58.680 --> 32:04.680]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[32:04.680 --> 32:09.160]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[32:09.160 --> 32:11.600]  It really says that the state is God.
[32:11.600 --> 32:16.160]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[32:16.160 --> 32:21.840]  on earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA queues,
[32:21.840 --> 32:27.200]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[32:27.200 --> 32:30.080]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[32:30.080 --> 32:34.720]  Police state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen. Prepare
[32:34.720 --> 32:38.600]  to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[32:38.600 --> 32:44.440]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[32:44.440 --> 32:47.920]  It's only the beginning of the Newell Alloys hellish plan.
[32:47.920 --> 32:51.040]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[33:00.040 --> 33:10.440]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:10.440 --> 33:17.200]  Coming up my friends, we're going to look at the insiders. General Electric has posted
[33:17.200 --> 33:24.360]  now in this new quarter a 57% profit this year. The big mega banks, they're all posting record
[33:24.360 --> 33:31.480]  profits as well. Right as Bank of America prepares, this is even in Bloomberg, to have
[33:31.480 --> 33:39.120]  the taxpayers sign on to $79 trillion in Bank of America's derivatives debts that we don't
[33:39.120 --> 33:43.720]  owe. But they're going to have the Herman Keynes on the right and the Barack Obama's
[33:43.720 --> 33:50.320]  on the left calling for higher taxes to pay off a debt we don't owe.
[33:50.320 --> 33:55.680]  I mean all the student loans, trillion bucks, all the mortgages in this country, delinquent
[33:55.680 --> 34:02.280]  and not delinquent, less than $18 trillion. But there'll be no discussion about $79 trillion
[34:02.280 --> 34:10.240]  backstopping it with trillions. Again, instead the mega banks that have engineered all this,
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.960]  the Ken Lay, Bernie Madoff types, they will become our rulers, just like the euro. Just
[34:15.960 --> 34:21.680]  like that's a new banking dictatorship being set up over there and ending sovereignty because
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.880]  the public is ignorant about real finance. And they think this croning capitalist, anti-free
[34:26.880 --> 34:32.200]  market system, they think it's capitalism. Because Michael Moore told everybody so, but
[34:32.200 --> 34:39.720]  Luke Radowski talking to Alec Baldwin a few days ago, that video's up on infowars.com.
[34:39.720 --> 34:43.800]  Baldwin said, no, we do need free market, we do need capitalism. So this whole debate
[34:43.800 --> 34:49.080]  is taking place right now. We're going to be looking at how the insiders are exempt
[34:49.080 --> 34:54.120]  from taxes and how those very insiders then promote tax increases on the rich. They mean
[34:54.120 --> 34:59.880]  middle class because they siphon it off in banker bailouts. It's the ultra-rich manipulating
[34:59.880 --> 35:04.040]  the poor against the middle class, pressure from above and below. That's the true paradigm.
[35:04.040 --> 35:10.200]  Now, for the next 15 minutes, Naomi Wolfe, best-selling author, Rhodes Scholar, you name
[35:10.200 --> 35:16.920]  it, joins us, also a leading feminist. And she wrote the landmark international best-seller,
[35:16.920 --> 35:22.040]  The Beauty Myth, challenging the cosmetics industry and so much more. It would take 15
[35:22.040 --> 35:25.800]  minutes to go over her bio, but we've got her here because, well, here's the London Guardian.
[35:25.800 --> 35:31.160]  Naomi Wolfe, how I was arrested at Occupy Wall Street, arresting a middle-aged writer
[35:31.160 --> 35:36.680]  in an evening gown for peaceable conduct is a far cry from when America was a free
[35:36.680 --> 35:41.800]  republic. And that's because the military-industrial complex owned by the banks runs all this.
[35:41.800 --> 35:46.760]  You get different rhetoric under Clinton, Bush, Obama, but the exact same program.
[35:46.760 --> 35:54.040]  PSA checkpoints now domestically. And we're on the streets of America. We are going into full
[35:54.040 --> 35:59.080]  globalist occupation. Naomi Wolfe, thank you for coming on with us, jailbird.
[35:59.080 --> 36:06.680]  Thanks so much for having me on again, Alex. I always like talking to you. And I appreciate the
[36:06.680 --> 36:11.640]  chance to talk about this especially. Well, I appreciate you coming on. So tell us about your
[36:11.640 --> 36:19.000]  thought crime. A genteel, attractive, well-dressed woman, I've seen the photos and videos,
[36:20.280 --> 36:23.960]  is arrested. I guess you're not even allowed. I mean, this is like North Korea.
[36:23.960 --> 36:33.000]  Yeah, it's truly unbelievable. Let's see. I guess I'll just start it quickly. At the beginning,
[36:33.000 --> 36:37.640]  my boyfriend and I were going to an event that happened to post that we've been invited to.
[36:37.640 --> 36:43.720]  And there were these Occupy Wall Street protesters outside of the event struggling to
[36:43.720 --> 36:47.880]  communicate with each other because they were forbidden to use a microphone by New York City
[36:47.880 --> 36:52.920]  permit. And my book, Excuse Me Liberty, explains that New York City and other cities have passed
[36:52.920 --> 36:59.640]  a bunch of sneaky self permits to really prohibit people from exercising freedom of speech and
[36:59.640 --> 37:05.720]  assembly. You can't rally without a permit. You can't use a megaphone. You can't stand here.
[37:05.720 --> 37:10.600]  You can't stand there. And it's all not transparent and not accountable. In New York City,
[37:10.600 --> 37:14.120]  they can turn you down for whatever reason. You never know why and you can't appeal.
[37:14.680 --> 37:20.920]  So I knew that. So I told them to push on the permit thing with a lawyer because it was one of
[37:20.920 --> 37:26.840]  the fake permits designed to silence protesters. Then my boyfriend suggested they get a list of
[37:26.840 --> 37:31.400]  their demands and take them inside because Cuomo was going to be there. They wanted to communicate
[37:32.360 --> 37:36.760]  their demands to him. And I thought, well, if I get a chance to challenge them, I'll just pass on
[37:37.560 --> 37:45.320]  their list of demands because this is a republic, theoretically. They're his boss. He works for
[37:45.320 --> 37:50.120]  them. So it seemed like a good idea. I took their demands. We went inside. We hung out.
[37:50.120 --> 37:55.400]  We mingled and met our friends. Came outside. He did show up and I had another commitment.
[37:55.400 --> 38:02.600]  Actually, it's an important business meeting. So when we came outside, we saw that the protesters
[38:02.600 --> 38:08.280]  had been pushed away or had been moved away from the sidewalk where Cuomo was going to be,
[38:08.280 --> 38:16.440]  where the gala was, across the two lanes of traffic to the opposite corner, far away from the event.
[38:16.440 --> 38:22.840]  And I knew from studying protests because after I wrote the End of America, which talks about how
[38:22.840 --> 38:27.800]  easy it is to close a demand... Yeah, they were cuddling them. They were exactly right. And this
[38:27.800 --> 38:33.240]  is happening all over the world. And this is super important now, because you know, because
[38:33.240 --> 38:39.480]  the number one thing that opens a closing society is protest, mass assembly. And not just
[38:39.480 --> 38:45.560]  permanent protest and impotent bill from here to there. No, mass protest that disrupts business as
[38:45.560 --> 38:51.240]  usual peacefully is so powerful. Well, I mean, it's the foundation of any free society. And I've
[38:51.240 --> 38:57.880]  been in New York at the RNC and other events where I'm just videotaping a protest 300 yards away
[38:57.880 --> 39:02.200]  on a sidewalk with a camera and a cop comes over. This is on video on my film, Marshall Law,
[39:02.760 --> 39:06.200]  and screams at me like I'm the lowest filth and threatens to arrest me.
[39:06.200 --> 39:11.320]  And, and I have been arrested in New York for demonstrating on another occasion. But the point
[39:11.320 --> 39:17.480]  is, is that a permit is a authorization to do something that would otherwise be illegal. And,
[39:17.480 --> 39:21.720]  and, and so permitting is a way to basically enslave people. And then they just get rid of the
[39:21.720 --> 39:28.120]  permitting, as you said, or refuse the permit. So it turns your right to demonstrate into a
[39:28.120 --> 39:32.200]  privilege. And the way they brainwash the cops, I want to get your view on this. It's going back
[39:32.200 --> 39:37.880]  50 years ago on the Pat St Patrick's Day parade or something. If you want to block, you know,
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.760]  10 blocks, sure, you got to get a permit and cops may have to pay for it, get sponsors,
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.640]  because you've got to block other people's way. But there's no doubt under the First Amendment
[39:48.360 --> 39:54.520]  around government buildings or in Commons or on the sidewalks, that it's totally protected. And
[39:54.520 --> 39:59.960]  they know this. And the fact that they are administration to administration, clamping down
[39:59.960 --> 40:05.240]  on it more and more shows this country's in deep trouble. I totally agree with you. And it, you
[40:05.240 --> 40:09.480]  know, it seems like this discussion about, you know, this weird bureaucracy of permits is really
[40:10.120 --> 40:16.840]  technical and boring. But it's incredibly important and relevant to literally whether people can
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.000]  gather and speak to each other. And, you know, if there's your First Amendment right for
[40:21.000 --> 40:26.360]  freedom of assembly and the right to petition government for redress of grievances. And so
[40:26.360 --> 40:32.760]  this is a municipality after municipality after the 70s, after there was a really
[40:32.760 --> 40:40.360]  excessive wave of mass protests. Powerful entities, you know, thought, let's just stop this. And they
[40:40.360 --> 40:44.440]  just recently passed all these. No, I mean, let me stop you because your phone was, and this
[40:44.440 --> 40:48.760]  happened the last time we're on, I think you've got a bad cell. Are you on a hands-free right now?
[40:49.640 --> 40:53.960]  No, no, it's a regular cell phone. Can you just put that receiver right up your mouth?
[40:53.960 --> 40:57.560]  Sure. I'm sorry. Oh, that's a lot better. Start over. Go ahead.
[40:57.560 --> 41:02.280]  Yeah. Okay. No, I was just saying that they, you know, weekly across the country done this.
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.520]  So I hear from people in Texas who are saying we're in a public park and they're telling us,
[41:06.520 --> 41:11.240]  you know, if they're going to arrest us, it'll cost us $600. Or, you know, we're in, you know,
[41:11.240 --> 41:15.400]  another park. They're telling us if we cover our heads from the rain with a piece of plastic,
[41:16.040 --> 41:20.440]  you know, we're violating a permit. So they just making this stuff up. And it's not transparent.
[41:20.440 --> 41:25.560]  And it's not. Yeah, they're lawyering it so they can try to claim, oh, well, we didn't totally
[41:25.560 --> 41:30.360]  take your first amendment. If you can jump through 100 flaming hoops and, and, you know,
[41:30.360 --> 41:36.200]  show up on a blue moon on the top of the mountain wearing a turkey hat, then, you know, then
[41:37.320 --> 41:43.800]  with a bag with 14 marbles in it on a Tuesday evening, when the whipper wheel cries, then maybe.
[41:44.520 --> 41:48.120]  Totally. You're right. So this gets worse. You don't believe it because I got arrested
[41:48.120 --> 41:53.080]  for a permit that doesn't exist. So let me, let me get to that. So I go across the street and
[41:53.080 --> 41:57.320]  I said, what happened? And they said, well, the cops told us that the permit in court
[41:59.400 --> 42:05.720]  forbids us from walking up and down the sidewalk. And I studied this and I knew there is no such
[42:05.720 --> 42:10.840]  thing. So I checked at the cops and one of them said, yes, the permit the event holders have
[42:11.560 --> 42:17.720]  let them control the sidewalk for a number of hours. Not possible. So I'm a reporter. I would
[42:17.720 --> 42:22.600]  back across the street. I asked around. I asked, please. I asked people with the event. Finally,
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.440]  I found someone who was with the event who said he'd seen the permit. And in fact, he confessed,
[42:28.440 --> 42:33.800]  it does allow for people assembly by protesters if we didn't obstruct traffic. So in fact,
[42:33.800 --> 42:39.080]  across the street said, guys, my boyfriend and I are going to walk peacefully up and down the street
[42:39.080 --> 42:43.800]  outside the event. We've checked the permit. It's legal. Please join us if you want to.
[42:43.800 --> 42:51.000]  A dozen people who were literally Alex walking up and down the street in single file peacefully,
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.920]  holding hands, not even saying anything. You know, I'm not even a partisan supporter of the
[42:56.920 --> 43:02.120]  move for their first amendment right, you know, because my grandma taught me that you have to
[43:02.120 --> 43:13.960]  do that. So then out of nowhere, a failings of like 30 or 35 white shirted guys, police officers,
[43:13.960 --> 43:19.160]  like it hires up, show up and they must have been reinforcements because they hadn't been
[43:19.160 --> 43:23.880]  there before. And they surround us and the guy with a megaphone and remember that protesters,
[43:23.880 --> 43:30.120]  citizens are not allowed to use megaphone. So you are ordered to disperse. You're creating
[43:30.120 --> 43:39.720]  an illegal obstruction. And at that point, I knew that that was not correct. So I walked up to him
[43:39.720 --> 43:44.760]  and you see in the video, very peacefully, because I'm all about peaceful protest. I've been saying
[43:44.760 --> 43:49.960]  for weeks on my Facebook page, the protest is you've got to be peaceful, respectful to cops,
[43:49.960 --> 43:55.320]  that's effective and it's the right thing to do. Peacefully walk over toward him with total respect
[43:55.320 --> 44:01.160]  and so you walk towards the God approaching the deity with the proper deference. The Bush was in
[44:01.160 --> 44:08.760]  front of him. What happened? Well, I do believe I mean, I hear you, but I also think it's a high
[44:08.760 --> 44:14.840]  tension moment. Again, from studying protest history, it's really important to be super calm
[44:14.840 --> 44:19.480]  and peaceful because that doesn't escalate. And it doesn't give provocateurs a chance to make
[44:19.480 --> 44:23.800]  things right. No, no, I agree with you. So you approach him nicely. I approach him and I identified
[44:23.800 --> 44:32.920]  myself and I said, Officer, I'm confused. I checked the permit and the law says we do have a right
[44:32.920 --> 44:40.760]  to protest here so long as we're not. You dared talk, you dared talk to a supreme being, a rulership?
[44:41.480 --> 44:46.360]  Oh, that's like a, that's like in Ghostbusters when they're up on the top of the building and
[44:47.320 --> 44:52.440]  Zool is there and they say, you know, we're telling you to get out of New York City and she says,
[44:52.440 --> 44:59.640]  are you a God? And then when they say no, I mean, you're talking to your ruler. You're a scum who's
[44:59.640 --> 45:05.240]  just there to pay taxes. You're there to provide as a slave. So you talk to your owner, your ruler,
[45:05.240 --> 45:13.000]  your God, certainly not your servant. What happened? Well, yeah, I mean, the stuff is very
[45:13.000 --> 45:22.280]  deep because, you know, I, I was raised to respect that, you know, this country and this country's
[45:22.280 --> 45:28.440]  foundations and you don't give up on democracy. You just don't. So I approached him and said,
[45:28.440 --> 45:32.680]  I'm confused. I checked the permit. We're, we are allowed, as I understand it, to not
[45:32.680 --> 45:37.800]  protest. And as you see, there's no obstruction. I mean, literally, there was like 12 feet on
[45:37.800 --> 45:44.440]  either side of us. You know, we were a single file. He said, will you back down? And I froze.
[45:44.440 --> 45:50.920]  And he said, will you get out of my way? And I truly, Alex, at that moment,
[45:52.200 --> 45:57.480]  I could not move. And I couldn't move. It's not that I made a conscious choice. I actually,
[45:57.480 --> 46:01.560]  I didn't want to get arrested. You know, I had somewhere important I needed to be. And I'm a,
[46:01.560 --> 46:05.320]  you know, I took kids. I didn't want to get arrested. That's why I checked the law so I could
[46:05.320 --> 46:14.200]  obey the law, right? I was carefully checking and obeying the law. But I, I felt so deeply at
[46:14.200 --> 46:20.680]  that moment that if I backed away from him and followed his order, it was not, I knew that he
[46:20.680 --> 46:26.120]  was not right. He was thinking that the law was not right. And I felt like I did that. I would be
[46:26.120 --> 46:32.760]  just situating to. Now I understand you would fully submit to slavery at that point. If in America,
[46:32.760 --> 46:37.720]  it's always those white shirted, you know, they're the commasars of the political police.
[46:37.720 --> 46:42.600]  In every video I've seen of them beating people who are innocent or attacking crowds,
[46:42.600 --> 46:48.040]  it's always the white shirts. They're the modern brown shirts. So, so you tried to explain this
[46:48.040 --> 46:54.680]  is, I couldn't move. I couldn't move. And I hesitated that half second and then he made a
[46:54.680 --> 47:03.000]  gesture. And we were surrounded. My boyfriend and I were surrounded by these guys. And my hands
[47:03.000 --> 47:09.800]  were pulled behind my back and my hands were cussed. That's not wrong. My partners were as well.
[47:09.800 --> 47:15.480]  And we were so moved bodily into the back of a police van. And there were national lawyers,
[47:15.480 --> 47:20.680]  field observers there. And so I shouted, you know, please have a lawyer meet us at the precinct.
[47:20.680 --> 47:25.160]  And then they bundled us into the van. We were alone in the van. And then something really
[47:25.160 --> 47:30.760]  scary happened, which is all the protesters marched to the first precinct, the near precinct,
[47:31.400 --> 47:36.120]  to be there and to see what, you know, that we were okay. Now, speak up for me. This is important.
[47:36.120 --> 47:42.760]  I'm sorry. The protesters marched to the correct precinct for High Street where we were to make
[47:42.760 --> 47:48.280]  sure that we were okay to witness what was happening and for the lawyers to meet us,
[47:48.280 --> 47:53.640]  to make sure that, you know, we were had representation. But when we were in the van,
[47:53.640 --> 48:00.280]  the police got a call clearly directing them to go to another precinct. And so they misinformed
[48:00.280 --> 48:04.520]  the protesters about where we were, which I think is very scary. Yeah, so now they're
[48:04.520 --> 48:09.240]  secret police black bagging you. Well, that's because when I was arrested once, people actually
[48:09.240 --> 48:15.480]  marched and protested around the precinct. That's in the film Truth Rising. And so clearly now
[48:15.480 --> 48:23.320]  they're trying to misdirect for wherever they're sneaking you off to. Which it cannot be legal.
[48:24.200 --> 48:28.760]  But anyway, they took us to seven precincts across town. And they were very courteous to us
[48:28.760 --> 48:33.480]  because by then I think it was clear that they were getting a lot of scrutiny about this arrest.
[48:33.480 --> 48:38.920]  But they took our possessions and they put us in separate cells and they locked us in. And
[48:38.920 --> 48:41.880]  my cell had blood or feces smeared on the wall.
[48:41.880 --> 48:47.080]  Yes, I showed mine in New York. I think that's, they actually picked a shell because most of
[48:47.080 --> 48:51.160]  the cells were open and they laughed and said, this is a good one for you. And I was looking
[48:51.160 --> 48:57.160]  in the open cells as I walked and there was feces everywhere, urine, McDonald's bags and they laughed.
[48:57.160 --> 49:03.880]  And then a mentally handicapped jail guard came over and giggled at me off and on for a few hours.
[49:03.880 --> 49:08.920]  And I just felt sorry for him. I mean, it's like something out of a science fiction nightmare.
[49:08.920 --> 49:13.880]  They have literal e-gores working in there. So you're in a special cell with blood and
[49:13.880 --> 49:18.360]  feces and things. What happens next? Yeah, well, I have to say that the staff there
[49:18.360 --> 49:25.720]  were extremely nice to us. Which, you know, I think obviously the fact that I'm visible,
[49:25.720 --> 49:32.840]  you know, made them be particularly nice. So how did this end? How did this end in the
[49:32.840 --> 49:38.760]  minute we got left? Yeah, very briefly. They released a couple of summons because obviously,
[49:38.760 --> 49:43.720]  you know, it was a hot potato by then. But the sergeant who released me before he let me out
[49:43.720 --> 49:49.480]  of my cell pointed to a camera facing the cell and said, if you go back to your friends, the
[49:49.480 --> 49:54.280]  protestors, you know, this time you're not getting arrested or you were taken to prison.
[49:54.280 --> 49:58.200]  Next time it will be a real arrest. We'll take your picture with that camera. We'll take your
[49:58.200 --> 50:04.360]  fingerprints with that machine. We'll send your data to a federal database. We'll be there forever.
[50:05.080 --> 50:09.800]  And I said, well, officer, if I was obeying the law tonight and I got arrested and he didn't
[50:09.800 --> 50:14.520]  dispute that I had obeyed the law, I said, how do I keep from getting arrested in the future?
[50:14.520 --> 50:19.080]  And he couldn't answer that. And I said, why did I get arrested if I obeyed the law? And he said that
[50:19.080 --> 50:24.200]  at any time if a police officer says it's a safety issue or being to the safety issue,
[50:24.200 --> 50:29.000]  they can arrest someone no matter what the law says. And he referred me to a section of the
[50:29.000 --> 50:34.600]  criminal code. Yeah, no, no. And that's a secret police arrest code. It's totally un-American.
[50:34.600 --> 50:39.880]  It's still official oppression. That code is a fraud. Naomi Wolf, thank you so much for spending
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.920]  time with us. And you're just shedding more light on the incredible police state we're facing.
[50:44.920 --> 50:51.240]  All right, we're going to come back with some huge breaking news. Big breaking news on the Iran
[50:51.240 --> 50:56.680]  war front straight ahead on the other side of this break. Then domestic checkpoints,
[50:56.680 --> 51:23.320]  illegal aliens above the law and more. Stay with us.

[51:48.280 --> 51:58.280]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones
[51:58.280 --> 52:04.680]  for survivalseedbank.com. You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[52:04.680 --> 52:11.240]  Everyone can feel it. We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom
[52:11.240 --> 52:18.760]  and those who love darkness, bondage and enslavement. Yes, my friends, evil is rising. But
[52:18.760 --> 52:23.880]  take heart for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Recently,
[52:23.880 --> 52:28.760]  New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the info war.
[52:28.760 --> 52:32.600]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[52:32.600 --> 52:39.160]  The globalist are scared. They've overreached. The future of the info war is in your hands.

[54:09.160 --> 54:16.760]  Okay, the president is speaking right now and we can put him on screen for prisonplanet.tv
[54:16.760 --> 54:21.400]  viewers but I've already got the press release put out by the White House.
[54:21.400 --> 54:30.120]  He's saying he'll have all U.S. troops out of Iraq by the end of 2011 but there's over 100,000
[54:30.120 --> 54:39.720]  military contractors still there. So mercenary stay and then they call the tens of thousands of
[54:39.720 --> 54:49.080]  military personnel that are going to stay basically support troops to the civilian personnel
[54:49.080 --> 54:57.080]  inside of the quote embassies. They've built the biggest U.S. embassies in the world there
[54:58.120 --> 55:04.360]  and of course he said all the troops would be out within one year of him getting into office.
[55:04.360 --> 55:09.400]  That didn't happen. They're always saying all the troops will be out of Afghanistan within one year
[55:09.400 --> 55:13.800]  and they always push that back and right as we were coming in live here, I was watching the
[55:13.800 --> 55:20.360]  president live, the so-called president, the traitor in chief and he was saying that we'll
[55:20.360 --> 55:26.120]  have half of them out of there by the end of the year. So it looks like this is just more bull
[55:26.760 --> 55:33.240]  on top of bull. Two years ago he renamed the combat brigade to support combat brigades.
[55:34.520 --> 55:42.280]  Now the angle here, this is the big breaking news. My cousin is being sent to Kuwait in
[55:42.280 --> 55:51.080]  logistics for helicopters, attack helicopters and other helicopters. Black cops, surveillance,
[55:51.080 --> 55:59.160]  delivery, you name it. I've talked to my other military sources. U.S. troops are massing big time
[56:00.840 --> 56:07.320]  inside of Kuwait and a lot of U.S. troops are leaving Iraq of the 50,000 that are there right
[56:07.320 --> 56:14.600]  now and massing in Kuwait. So they're not coming home. Most of them, Johnny's not coming marching
[56:14.600 --> 56:21.880]  home. They're massing in Kuwait and you saw last week the government come out and say oh my gosh
[56:22.440 --> 56:27.400]  and by the way the Iranians have now directly linked this and it's been confirmed by even U.S.
[56:27.400 --> 56:35.640]  Western media connected this plotter to a Western finance terror group staging terror attacks inside
[56:35.640 --> 56:41.480]  Iran. So it's completely phony and now the White House is saying they're going to come out with
[56:42.440 --> 56:48.920]  more, don't worry there's more Iranian threats, more groups they're going to foil and then oh see
[56:49.640 --> 56:54.600]  and notice the troops are already massed just perfectly and the aircraft carriers are there and
[56:54.600 --> 56:59.240]  now the Israeli bombardment has to be backed. So they are looking at hitting Iran
[56:59.240 --> 57:07.800]  and our sources, Ray McGovern and many others have come out and said that well,
[57:09.000 --> 57:14.040]  Panetta 15, 16 days ago, Secretary of Defense came back and says Israel is the closest they've
[57:14.040 --> 57:17.880]  been to hitting Iran. They are quote the most isolated they've ever been in their history.
[57:18.440 --> 57:25.080]  So this is a major issue on the radar. That's why they're quote killing bin Laden, killing Gaddafi,
[57:25.080 --> 57:30.760]  getting rid of Hussein Mubarak. They're opening up a new chapter. Obama came with peace. They
[57:30.760 --> 57:36.600]  liberated everyone. They put the jihadis in control of countries and then Iran hit America
[57:37.320 --> 57:42.680]  and Iran had to be dealt with and then of course who comes out of Saudi Arabia, the jihadis, the
[57:42.680 --> 57:49.880]  al-Qaeda people. So this is all about the U.S., Israel, England and Saudi Arabia all teamed up,
[57:49.880 --> 57:56.040]  the same old team mopping up groups. But again, Israel, England, the U.S., Saudi Arabia,
[57:56.040 --> 58:00.200]  it's not the Israeli people that are bad, the Saudi Arabia people are bad, the English, the American,
[58:00.920 --> 58:07.640]  folks in the U.K. It's the elites. This is the power axis. It's like Italians weren't bad because
[58:07.640 --> 58:13.080]  they had Mussolini. He was bad. Some Italians were bad for going along with him. Same thing for
[58:13.080 --> 58:19.480]  Hitler, Stalin or Mao. Chinese people aren't bad because of Mao. Mao is bad. But there's no
[58:19.480 --> 58:28.280]  doubt that our country is used now as an evil empire. By the way, old Gorbachev calls for
[58:28.280 --> 58:36.920]  American Perestroika and global governance. That article is up at infowars.com. The second hour

[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:33.640]  and third hours today. On any of the news items I've raised or any questions or comments you have,

[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.680]  Coming up though, I've got to race through some of this news and play a video clip or two and then
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:56.840]  we'll get to your calls. Then after that, I'm going to premiere here. We actually aired it last
[01:00:56.840 --> 01:01:04.440]  night, but premiere on the radio and PrisonPlanet.tv for folks watching right now. The audio and video
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.000]  of my latest confrontation with an internal checkpoint and get into some new developments on
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.880]  that front since we learned of more TSA checkpoints across the country. And I got emails and comments
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:22.840]  saying, I'm a liar. TSA is not on the streets of America. Comments in the articles, the mainstream
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:30.120]  news articles about it. I mean, that's got to be disinfo. That can't just be kind of dumbed down
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:36.520]  people. But continuing here, I want to hit this article right now. Gorbachev calls for American
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.840]  perestroika. Former Soviet leader says protest movement highlights need for global governance.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.040]  Former communist leader Mikhail Gorbachev told an audience at Lafayette College on Wednesday night
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:55.480]  that the United States economic problems had happened and heralded the need for a new American
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:03.240]  perestroika, which was all staged, defined by a new world order and a system of global governance.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:08.840]  These are quotes speaking to a crowd of 3,600 people during an event that was broadcast live
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.520]  nationwide. Gorbachev made reference to the riots and demonstrations that have swept the
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.880]  world over the last two years, including the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.760]  The world needs goals that will bring people together, he said, under the bankers, raping us,
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.680]  of course. Some people in the United States were pushing the idea of creating a global
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.800]  American empire, and that was a mistake from the start. No, they want a UN global empire.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.280]  Other people in America are now giving thought to the future of their country.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.760]  The big banks, the big corporations are still paying the same big bonuses as their bosses.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.560]  So he talks the, you know, the rhetoric, but then they bait and switch it for austerity.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:48.920]  Was there ever a crisis for them? I believe America needs its own perestroika.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.200]  I don't think you need a perestroika. What was it that they had in,
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.480]  what was the name of what they had in Poland?
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.320]  Glasnost, what does that mean, honesty in government?
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:15.320]  And of course, the plan was always to merge, and this came out in the Carnegie and Ford Foundation
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.440]  documents. That's why our government, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers set up the
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:29.960]  Bolshevik Revolution on record, but also propped them up. And here's a quote by
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:37.160]  Mikhail Gorbachev. Comrades, do not be concerned about all you hear about Glasnost and perestroika
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.760]  and democracy in the coming years. They are primarily for outward consumption.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.320]  There will be no significant internal change. Yeah, the Russians never took the hammer and
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.400]  sickle off. Then the Soviet Union, other than for cosmetic purposes, are purposes to disarm the
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:59.240]  Americans and let them fall asleep. We want to accomplish three things. One, we want the Americans
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:04.520]  to withdraw conventional forces from Europe. Two, we want them to withdraw nuclear forces from
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.840]  Europe. Three, we want the Americans to stop proceeding with a strategic defense initiative,
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:17.800]  Gorbachev in a speech at the Soviet Politburo November 1987. Now, the Russians internally
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:24.760]  thought he was a CIA agent, and that's come out. He wasn't a CIA agent. He was CIA, KGB. It's down
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.560]  here in the pyramid, just like major corporate chiefs are. The owners, Bilderberg, Committee of
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:34.840]  300, those groups, they nexus in. They're the pyramid. They're guiding and playing groups
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:40.440]  always off against each other. So there's real conflict going on, real soldiers, real spies,
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:48.280]  real propaganda, but it's all guided in a symphony of destruction. Quote Dave Mustain.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:54.360]  All right, we'll be right back. I'll blitz through some incredible news on the deindustrialization
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:59.560]  by designing the high treason, some other important news on cyber command, and then your calls.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:06.600]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:11.720]  America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.120]  shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.840]  family. Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is,
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:25.480]  he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Pannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:30.360]  and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties. In fact, Barron's called his work
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:35.240]  a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:39.960]  his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye opener. I can't stress this
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.280]  enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.600]  know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:55.640]  www.endofamerica3.com. That's End of America, the number three.com. Watch the free video at
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:06:04.200]  www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com. Alex Jones here with vital information concerning
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:09.240]  our nation's fragile food supply. Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:15.000]  think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:21.240]  History really does repeat itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:29.160]  Number three, take decisive action. A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:34.280]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves,
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:40.360]  warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:47.000]  crisis hits. This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also get a free
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.920]  copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again, that website is
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.520]  risingpricesemptyshelves.com. That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:07.320]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.440]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:17.240]  Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:23.960]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:29.480]  to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:35.000]  cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.560]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:44.200]  saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:51.800]  Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:08:06.680]  at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:29.160]  Okay, I want to go to Eric, Tim, Jeff, Robert, Keith, and many others that are patiently holding
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.320]  on this live Friday edition. But first, I want to get into treason.
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.760]  As you know, it has come out yet again in congressional testimony, and we covered this
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:48.360]  yesterday. The Associated Press carried it, so did CNS News. Napolitano testified DHS is
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:53.880]  authorizing illegal aliens to work in the U.S. They've been hired to build part of the Border
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:00.920]  Show fence when they do do raids on dairies and meatpacking plants. In every case, they hire them
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:06.680]  all on the spot and give them green cards. It's all for public consumption. Here's a headline,
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:13.480]  Union President testifies ICE headquarters ordered agents not to arrest illegals, including
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.560]  fugitives. And we've heard the Border Patrol come out with this information for years.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:22.360]  We've heard sheriffs come out where they'll arrest a truckload of 10, 15 illegals or more
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.600]  and be ordered to turn them loose. But then citizens get the book thrown at you and they
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:34.040]  want to search your car. It's all about using the excuse to invade your life. I'm not an enemy
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.480]  of the Border Patrol. Okay, I'm just upset over the fact that they're being used to do
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:46.440]  unconstitutional things. And we have that video clip coming up here in just a moment.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:53.080]  And but you add all of this together with an article like this one. And this is just coming
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:59.080]  out today. I see this stuff every day. But this is unprecedented because it's Janet Napolitano
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:06.680]  admitting it in testimony. And here's the issue. Federal law is still there. You aid in a bed.
[01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:11.240]  In fact, when I was down in South Padre, I was talking to a business owner and I actually looked
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:22.360]  it up. The story he told me about where one of the owners of the sightseeing boats and dolphin
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.560]  watching and fishing boats, he owned a bunch of them. And he basically had bought up a lot of the
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:32.760]  town over decades running it. He got caught using one of his big boats to bring illegals into Houston
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:39.000]  100 miles north of there. So and he got a year in prison and they took all his boats and stuff.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:45.960]  Well, that's just because he was a small fry. You see, violating that federal law was a felony.
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:53.240]  But they're saying because Obama is the president, he can violate federal laws. He can order citizens
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:11:00.040]  killed. Oh, but it's just Al Qaeda. The precedents now set. They say you're Al Qaeda.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:05.720]  The precedents now set to set up checkpoints all over the country. In fact, I have those reports
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.600]  I'm going to get to here in a moment. But here's another report out of Fox News. Senators have
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:17.320]  drafted a bill to give visas to foreigners buying pricey homes. And I'm not so much even against
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:22.280]  that. If foreigners come with money, I mean, that's the issue. If people come here and get put on
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:28.760]  welfare and then the Ford Foundation teaches them to hate America and to vote for gun control,
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.560]  I mean, you've got to keep the illegals out or they're going to become the majority
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:37.640]  and vote to take all their liberties away. Don't you get it? That's why the mega corporations
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.240]  are for it. It's not just about driving down wages. And then it doesn't help the people of
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:48.520]  Latin America. If they beach this lifeboat, you've got to have those governments down there
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:54.120]  overthrown that are run by globalists. But the globalist everywhere are taking out old
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:12:00.120]  dictators and putting in worse ones. Look at Egypt. They're all praising Obama for democratization
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.880]  of the Middle East. What are they talking about? They've just put Al Qaeda in control.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.040]  Senators draft bill to give visas to foreigners buying pricey homes. Well,
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:15.400]  it's like you can move to Switzerland if you've got a couple million bucks in the bank and
[01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:21.640]  are willing to buy a home. But this is getting attention when this is nothing.
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:30.840]  Yeah. I mean, if people want to come here, you know, the problem is that 500,000 isn't
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:35.560]  quite nearly enough. It should at least be a million. But and that you guarantee that you're
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:40.680]  going to be able to get a job, got a job waiting for you, or that you're not going to ever seek
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:45.880]  welfare and sign a form, sign an agreement that if you're going to move here for 10 years, you
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:53.800]  don't get any free largesse. There's 310 million Americans. There's almost 7 billion people outside
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:13:00.040]  the country. The census is 7 billion globally, but that was a couple years ago and it's not
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:09.240]  entirely accurate to estimate. It's more like 7 billion, 200 million. So there's 6.9 billion people
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:13.560]  that want to come here. Well, they won't want to come here very soon if they all get here.
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.800]  I mean, have you been to a real third world country, folks? All these people saying, oh,
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:23.560]  like Perry, let's give the lowest tuition that's taxpayer supported. 50% of it at least is paid
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:29.080]  for by taxpayers. Let's give in state tuition, taxpayer subsidized to the illegals. You don't
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:35.000]  have a big heart if you don't. A big heart. Most people I know can't afford to send their kids
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  to college who are citizens. Forget what color they are, but the illegals, they do. I mean,
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.720]  this is such a game how they use the big heart of the American people. Can you go to Mexico or
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:53.080]  Nicaragua or El Salvador or South Korea? Can you go anywhere and get free education or close to it?
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:14:01.720]  No, of course not. You get arrested, but I digress. This is the ridiculous mind game
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:07.080]  the globalists have pulled on us. Now, the good news is, despite all his claims of being a man of
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.680]  peace, because he's going to pull all the troops out and there's over 100,000 contractors and they're
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.240]  just renaming the troops as non, it's the same trick from two years ago. They're renaming the
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:22.440]  troops as non-military. They're still troops, but it's in a logistic support role. You didn't
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.960]  read the fine print, huh? More mind games, just like they were going to be out of Afghanistan
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:35.960]  in one year, huh? 10 years later. Then you look at Obama's jobs bill, and it admittedly has a
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:42.520]  free trade deal that's one sided to move jobs to Latin America and South Korea. That's the jobs
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:50.120]  bill, but wait, it gets worse. Let me find it here in my stack. I already read it earlier. I already
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:59.400]  read the headline earlier. Oh boy, I can't even keep track of all this. Guys, pull up the headline.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:05.640]  General Electric profits increased 57% for me, so I can read that off the screen and also
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:14.040]  show that to listeners out there. I wanted it out for people, thank you, because I can't seem to
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:23.000]  find it here in my stack. There's just too much. The point is General Electric runs the
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.640]  President's Economic Board, and they have publicly stated they're going to move their X-ray division
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:38.280]  overseas. General Motors, with billions of dollars it was given, over five billion total,
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:48.680]  moved plants to Brazil, Eastern Europe, and China. Your tax money paid to move it out of the country.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:57.960]  But before we get to that, let's go ahead and play that clip from C-SPAN, where the head of the
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:07.160]  union admits that ICE was ordered to let illegal aliens stay in the country, including criminals.
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:14.120]  Here's that clip. When I last testified before the subcommittee on July 25, 2011, I reported,
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:19.080]  among other things, that ICE enforcement removal officers and agents in the field alleged that
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:24.040]  unwritten directives from ICE headquarters had been issued nationwide ordering officers not to
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:29.240]  arrest aliens unless it was confirmed that the alien had received a prior conviction for a criminal
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:35.880]  offense. Aliens who could not be arrested included, but were not limited to, ICE fugitives who had
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.520]  been ordered deported by a federal immigration judge, as well as aliens who had illegally
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:46.920]  re-entered the United States after deportation, a federal felony. ICE officers and agents also
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:52.200]  alleged that they were not permitted to arrest or even speak to, confirmed or suspected illegal
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:57.720]  aliens, encountered in the field during operations, and were prohibited from running standard criminal
[01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:03.320]  records checks for once in warrants. First, I would like to thank Chairman Smith and his staff
[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:08.040]  for working with the union regarding this matter after the July... Okay, folks, that's it. That
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.840]  sounds like it has an electric razor going in the background, but that's how CNS News recorded it
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:18.840]  off C-SPAN. You can watch that clip up at infowars.com. We have that posted. There's the article I was
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:28.520]  looking for in my stack. General Electric Profit rises 57% revenue flat, and that is in the Wall
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:41.960]  Street Journal and also at CNBC. So their profit rises 57% revenue flat. So that's a deindustrialization
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:51.000]  and an offshoring growth curve. Let me continue here along those lines for you today. Here are
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:00.440]  two news articles. Car company gets U.S. loan, builds cars in Finland, and now you've noticed,
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:07.000]  not only do they get these 0% government-free money, but in some cases just pure tax incentives
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:14.760]  or flat-out stimulus money, then with these companies like the Big Solar Company and others
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:20.920]  that got $500 million, they never build anything. It's all fake. Green jobs, you name it, and it's
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:28.680]  all on record, ABC News reports in this, two Democrat top donors. You put in $100,000, you get
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:38.200]  $500 million back. That's around what that particular company that got the $500 million for
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:46.200]  solar panels put $100,000 in, you get $500 million back. But again, the globalist, it's not just
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:51.480]  given money. You've got to be an insider globalist to even be able to get away with all this.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:54.920]  They're all over the news saying, is this legal? It seems like this should be illegal.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:59.400]  Should it be illegal that 2000 plus insider companies get waivers from having to get
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:05.800]  Obama healthcare, what everybody else does, which then puts undue cost situation on the
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:11.880]  competitors? Of course, it's illegal. Of course, all of this is illegal. All of this garbage
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:19.640]  is 100% illegal, period. But they're just breaking our will, doing it. With the approval of the
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:26.440]  Obama administration, an electric car company that received $529 million in federal government loan
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:31.800]  guarantees is assembling its first line of cars in Finland, so you could not find a facility
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:39.880]  in the United States capable of doing the work. So you see, there's not even a rule here that
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:44.280]  you've got to do it in the US. In fact, in most cases, you're incentivized to leave. But wait,
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:50.680]  it gets better. It gets better. I've got another article about this. These people are waging war.
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.000]  It's not just they don't care about America. They've always wanted to bring it down. The
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.040]  globalist have always wanted to use America to build the world government and fully implode us.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:05.720]  That's the sound of your door being kicked in by an intruder with a single kick.

[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:15.400]  intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front. InfoWars.com is leading the fight
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:21.000]  against the technocrats. But we can't do that without your help by getting the films,
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.480]  bumper stickers and t-shirts at InfoWars.com. You will wake up people in your area and support

[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:47.000]  and darkness. You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:56.680]  dehumanization and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an Info War. The spirit of 1776
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:04.040]  versus the mindset of 1984. If you're a man over 40, you may feel like half the man you used to be.

[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.680]  man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen. Be the man you used to be.

[01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:22.440]  I brought her over with me. No one will be here. I just came to watch my LED.

[01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:14.840]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:23.240]  Live Before The Collapse by The Lost Vegas.
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:33.400]  Look, I've got a big stack here in front of me of more examples of green jobs, taxpayer-funded
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:43.320]  jobs that are mainly overseas. And this is treason. I've had the head of the American Small
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:48.200]  Business League on many times and he'll talk about federal law states that a certain percentage
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:54.600]  of government contracts are supposed to go to either U.S. companies in one category or small
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:01.320]  businesses but they're not. And it's come out now in Congress that there's a secret blacklist
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.880]  where American small companies aren't supposed to get it. Of course big mega foreign companies
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:17.800]  want to come in and get government to not give contracts to Americans. But Americans are so naive,
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:24.440]  so busy thinking everything's great and red, white, and blue. And the more American flags
[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.880]  I see the less freedom. It's like people stick them on their cars, their houses,
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:33.240]  and I like the American flag. But the point is there's all these cars, the more football
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:38.600]  stickers they have, the more flags they have to let you know this is America. Okay, but what does
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:43.640]  America symbolize then? A bill of rights, a constitution, a declaration of independence,
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:48.840]  private property, not having checkpoints, not having secret police, not having high taxes,
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:56.360]  rugged individualism, that's all going away. And then those of us that come out and say we want
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:02.920]  real America back, oh, we're the extremist, we're the dangerous people, we're the bad people.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:11.320]  Now I'm going to go to your phone calls and after we're done with a round of calls, I'll go to some
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:16.600]  news and back to calls. I want to get to counterterrorism chief opposes UN control of the
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:24.040]  internet. Oh yeah, that's mainstream news today. Also Obama is basically being booed and ignored
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:32.920]  and having to tell different crowds to clap for him. The LA Times is reporting. Pelosi is now
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.800]  ignoring Obama. And again, that's because he's the front man. He's meant to take the blame.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.840]  I don't like Obama, but he's a globalist. This idea that we get a new president in and they're
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:47.960]  going to fix it when they're bought and paid for by the very same interest that owned George W.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:56.280]  Bush, that own Bill Clinton, that own Herman Cain, Mitt Romney and Rick Perry. There's only one guy
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.840]  who's being ignored or demonized by the media when they do covering scientifically proven in
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.560]  major studies, Ron Paul. There's only one guy who has identified the globalist and talked about
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:10.120]  world government in a bad way. You know, you got globalists talking about world government
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:16.920]  all the time in a positive way. Gormachoff yesterday, Bush senior all the time,
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.280]  Obama, people call him for world government all the time that you and calling for it.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.560]  When you call for it, the media is like, oh, great. He wants world government.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.760]  You know, I pick up the Economist magazine a lot of times on newsstands, world government this,
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.720]  world government that, it's the answer. It'll fix all your problems.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:38.440]  Gormachoff last night on national TV called for a new world order, world government, global
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:43.240]  governance. Those are the quotes, global governance, new world order, a system of global government.
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:49.960]  So when he says that it's good, but see when I don't like it, oh, there has to be an ADL or
[01:27:49.960 --> 01:27:56.600]  Southern Poverty Law Center or MSNBC or Nightline Special, this dangerous man has millions of
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:28:02.280]  listeners. He tells them there's a world government coming that wants to set up checkpoints and take
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:11.800]  their rights and then it's all happening. I mean, I don't even know what to say anymore.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:15.480]  And they say global governance, working together, that'll fix it. A big global,
[01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:21.560]  unelected corporate dictatorship on Bloomberg and on MSNBC and CNBC. I've heard and seen,
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.760]  we've played the clips. I know you've seen it. It's a talking point. Well, you know, the problem
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:32.120]  is Germany. They're able to vote in Germany and they don't want to have to bail out these big banks.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:37.080]  So that may hold this up. And then they go to the other expert. I agree with the democracies
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:41.960]  a problem. But don't worry, we'll get it one way or the other. This new financial union,
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:47.400]  where the financial banks run things, that's the answer. We don't need freedom.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:56.280]  And they've got business investors and people listening to Bloomberg, watching CNBC,
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:03.720]  like this is how you get ahead. Now the answer is our stocks will go up if we rape the taxpayers
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:09.320]  of Germany. And if we get rid of their system, yeah, under this new financial union, the member
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:15.960]  countries can never get out again. And they have no sovereignty or control over their finances.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:20.280]  And the big banks will get it all. When it looks like the deal's going to go through last week,
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:26.440]  stocks go up over there. When the deal started falling through, everything starts imploding.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:32.200]  And they say, give us what we want, or you'll have a depression. Give into the bankers. Give
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:36.840]  us your sovereignty. I mean, it's like an enemy army coming and saying, take me to your leader.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:44.200]  I am Zogger, Zugger, Zool, or what's that guy's name, Zed? Who's the guy in,
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:52.920]  who's the guy in Superman? What's his name? Neil Zod. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:30:04.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones. And I want to tell you about
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:10.360]  the Silver Lungs Generator. Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:16.120]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs. The respiratory
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:21.480]  system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses. The Silver Lungs Generator
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:27.000]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:33.000]  delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  threatening the sale of nano-silver products. You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.280]  with the Silver Lungs Generator. Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided,

[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:26.360]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:32.200]  small-owner general growth properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently,
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:36.520]  he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:41.320]  prediction yet. And it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least

[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:08.280]  a solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:13.400]  electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:18.440]  company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:23.560]  smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:28.840]  dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:33.960]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:38.520]  lose their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.160]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:47.400]  offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:54.280]  at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun,

[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:27.400]  This magic moment, so different and so new, was like any other. Until I kiss you, and then it happened.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:50.120]  It is liberty that makes this world so wonderful. There is so much good, our families,
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:59.080]  freedom, our private property, the seven seas. But there are evil people upon this planet that
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.280]  always seek to dominate and control. And I was making the joke about Europe being told to kneel
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:11.640]  to the megabankers, like in one of those Superman movies from the 70s, where it's kneel before
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.680]  Zod, take me to your leader. And they actually found the obnoxious clip on YouTube. Here it is.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:31.640]  All right, it's funnier when you can actually see the ridiculous guy.
[01:34:31.640 --> 01:34:47.560]  Oh, I shouldn't laugh about it. It's so sick. Coming up, after I take some calls, last night,
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:53.960]  every day at about 5 o'clock, we post on infowars.com a promotion of what's coming up at 7 p.m.
[01:34:53.960 --> 01:35:00.680]  on InfoWars Nightly News. And Curt Nemo just writes a blurb and shows a few graphics that are
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:08.040]  coming up on the show that night. And we had the headline Nightly News, Gaddafi hit TSA in Tennessee
[01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:15.640]  and Bank of America's derivatives. But I see these type of comments not only in kind of our TV guide
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:21.400]  type deal we post a few hours before the show every night. I also see it in articles that are
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:27.960]  bibliographed and do have links to it. And I saw this fella, he says the TSA's brazen expansion of
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:33.800]  its Gestapo operation in the state of Tennessee. The TSA will deploy visible, intermodal prevention
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:40.200]  and response viper teams on the state's roadwaves to fight terrorism and acclimate citizens to the
[01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:44.120]  presence of armed paramilitary troops and a further erosion of the Fourth Amendment.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.480]  And this person screams in their comment, show proof, Curt Nemo, that the sovereigns at Tennessee
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:58.920]  are letting this happen. Doesn't prison planet have any fans in Tennessee that can independently
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:04.600]  verify this story or shut the bleep up? I'm getting fed up with you trying to scare people
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:10.760]  with your nightmares. And this has got to be disinfo because on the site was the link
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:17.960]  to Tennessee becomes first state to fight terrorism statewide, which that isn't even true either.
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:21.800]  I've got it in police state four of the rise of FEMA two years ago.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:27.400]  Stuff from two years ago in that film out for a year now where they had regular army out there
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:32.600]  of the TSA. It's all over the country. And here's the channel, News Channel Five.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.040]  And I mean, last night on the nightly news, I played a clip of their news. You can go there
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:42.520]  and watch it yourself. But I mean, I bet the guy would go to this article and say it's a lie.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:50.840]  And I don't understand it because because this has got to be disinfo because they must know
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:54.600]  that a lot of people don't know how to check an article. So they just say in the articles,
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:37:01.160]  this is a lie. When it's not a lie. So I'm going to get back in this where I play this clip
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:08.280]  before I play this clip. I'm doing too much talk radio. Sometimes I end up really going
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:13.880]  into hillbilly accent here. So it's just focusing and fully articulating what I'm saying. All right,
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.720]  let's go to your phone calls here. Now be ready. Callers going to try to move the next
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.960]  person quickly. I want to get to everybody here. Eric in Colorado. Thanks for holding
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:28.200]  your on the air. Go ahead. Alex, these past few weeks talking about the Occupy protesters,
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.880]  I mean, you've been criticizing them because some of them attended or are attending college.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:39.080]  And for someone who believes so strongly in learning and education, someone whose mind
[01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:45.480]  burns with understanding. I mean, I find it deeply ironic that you'd say higher education
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:49.800]  is bad. I mean, I'm sorry community college didn't work out for you, but that's no reason
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:56.760]  to tell others it's it's worthless. Well, number one, that's really a mischaracterization
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:03.960]  of what I've said. So I don't feel even any need to argue or debate anything with you.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.760]  I have pointed out that Bill Gates, Rush Limbaugh had gone for hours. Actually,
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:14.600]  they've done studies and major publications. You can pull them up that statistically most of your
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:21.160]  top CEOs and top entrepreneurs either didn't attend college or dropped out of college.
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:27.720]  You also make the inference that I was failing and that community college didn't work out for me.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:34.120]  That's not what happened. I was already doing my local access show. I had started doing local radio.
[01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:43.000]  They wanted me full time and the RTF I was taking was antiquated. And I went and checked out UT
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.160]  and didn't feel like having a professor that I couldn't understand. And it just seemed like
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:55.240]  a total joke. And so here I am reaching millions of people a day. But I understand you count coup
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:00.920]  and imply I'm a failure. And so that then makes your straw man argument for you,
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:07.800]  which is built on another straw man argument that I was saying higher education is worthless.
[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:13.720]  I believe to clarify it, because I do get flip it sometimes and get a little bit sarcastic
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:20.200]  that engineering or to be a doctor or something like that, it's certainly needed. And
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.960]  some people really get something out of education. But on average, it's way overpriced.
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:30.760]  It's a giant bubble. I've been talking about that for 15 years. Now that's a mainstream talking point.
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:35.400]  It's a trillion dollar bubble. It's ripping people off. And most of the people I know that
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:41.240]  have two or three degrees are bagging groceries at the local grocery stores. And no one can deny
[01:39:41.240 --> 01:39:48.200]  that's a major phenomenon. So I mean, I've got a lot of high school buddies who didn't go to college.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.240]  And when I run into them, most of them own companies and live on in the nice part of town.
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:59.800]  And most of the people I know that have a bunch of degrees aren't doing too well. So I mean,
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.920]  I don't know what more I can say to you or how I can get that across to you that that's what I
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:11.720]  actually stand for. And my point was, I also have said from the beginning, Occupy Wall Street has
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:15.720]  been a projection. The establishment called for Occupy Wall Street, that's on record,
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:20.360]  adbusters and others. Good people showed up because there is a big problem with Wall Street
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:24.680]  being cronies right now. And then the establishment projected on the crowd,
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.040]  changes they wanted, which is higher taxes that Warren Buffett and others are promoting.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:36.360]  So I've been very clear about saying there's diverse groups out there but that who the mainstream
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:49.000]  media says leads Occupy Wall Street are bad news, Obama, George Soros, the big unions.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:55.400]  So that's what I said. But again, do you just want to repeat that I'm a failure? Does that
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:02.120]  make you feel big, Tim? It's Eric actually, Alex. And you know, most people, I'm going to call you
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.800]  Tim. I'm going to call you Tim because I didn't get enough education. Now, Tim, I'm going to call
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:14.040]  you Tim and Tim Buck too. Then we'll go to Tim in Utah in a minute. Listen to Tim Eric from Colorado.
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:21.720]  Just get to your point here. Most people who go to the fact is out. Most people who don't go to
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:26.600]  college don't get a higher education. They don't end up in the middle class. They don't end up
[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:30.040]  owning businesses. They end up in the lower class. They end up in the welfare class.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:35.480]  That's the fact. They end up flipping burgers their whole lives. I've got a college education.
[01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:40.280]  I've got a job. I'm doing great. And that's okay. I understand. Hey, you're a ring. You're a ring
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:45.480]  knocker. And there's nothing wrong with that, man. I mean, I think people that got rings and tapped
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:49.560]  them on the table. I mean, I've actually had people show me a ring and go, you see that?
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:57.560]  You see that ring? So it's big. What kind of rings you got? Tell me about your rings.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:02.680]  I don't own a ring, Alex. I don't go waving this in people's spaces, but it's wrong.
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.800]  Well, it's freaking me out a little bit right now. I'm feeling pretty diminished.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:12.280]  I mean, I'm feeling pretty... No, you've just let me... I mean, I'm a college dropout. You're
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:17.080]  humiliating me right now in front of everybody. Hey.
[01:42:17.080 --> 01:42:21.320]  You're very well for yourself, Alex. Plenty of people do. But the fact is, for most people who
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:25.480]  don't go to college, they end up in the welfare class. That's the bottom line.
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:32.120]  Look, I've seen a lot of different studies on it. And that's just not true. I mean, I have seen so
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:38.040]  many people who go out and get jobs and become managers and then start their own companies
[01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:44.760]  or move up into companies. That's just not true. I know a lot of corporate CEOs. I know a lot of
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:51.960]  people. And yeah, for middle management, they are looking for somebody with a college degree.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.280]  But I'm telling you, they're not necessarily looking for that. I mean, certainly, if you want
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:01.800]  to be an officer in the military, you've got to go to ROTC. And you've got to become a commissioned
[01:43:01.800 --> 01:43:09.400]  officer. But we're still going back to the straw man. I'm not saying that higher education is bad.
[01:43:09.400 --> 01:43:15.880]  I'm saying the way it's structured today, it's becoming a big ripoff and really just a facade.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:21.480]  And most big universities are just investment pools. And the education part of their system is vestigial.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:31.000]  Well, I mean, that's why we need to raise taxes on the 1%. Honestly, we need more money for higher
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:37.560]  education. We need to make it more affordable for people. Bottom line. You know, back when taxes
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:42.280]  were about a third of what they are now, education was completely free in the state of Texas.
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:48.600]  How did we go from University of Texas being free, the biggest university in the world,
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:55.480]  to being now extremely expensive? I mean, how did that happen? Again, sir,
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:58.600]  you say you've got a college degree. Well, let me tell you what I learned
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:04.120]  from reading and studying real economics. When Kennedy cut the highest tax bracket by half,
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:10.200]  the next bracket was at 38%, the tax receipts the next year doubled. Now,
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:17.720]  do you understand that? That in every major case when you raise taxes, revenues go down?
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.920]  Or you don't understand that? That's not necessarily true from what I've read.
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:29.320]  Okay. Well, California keeps raising taxes. How's California doing? I mean, I guess you're not
[01:44:29.320 --> 01:44:35.160]  there. You're in Colorado, Eric. Not so good. Not so good. But you know, you've got to, it's
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:40.920]  got to be a balance, Alex. You got to find a way to balance it out. So the wealth, there's some
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:47.640]  wealth in the middle class. So people can afford things like college or groceries even. So you,
[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:54.040]  I mean, it's all tied together. Yeah, you need a balance. Well, hey, Eric, people like you run
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:57.560]  this country. So watch where it goes. So they're going to raise taxes. Don't worry.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.640]  Herman Cain wants it. They're going to get it. So I have fun. I appreciate your call.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:09.000]  America's pretty much wrecked and gone because people like you. I mean, every word he said,
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:19.400]  I have just, just, just volcanic amounts, explosive, eruptive amounts of information.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:29.720]  Number one, it's more like 4% has about 40% of the wealth. And those numbers they use is domestic
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:39.640]  wealth, not globalist tax exempt foundation wealth. And you've also got that top 4% paying
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:48.040]  the vast majority way, way, way over half the taxes. So you don't understand that there's a
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:54.200]  robber baron class that's tax exempt like General Motors and the rest of them. And then there's
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:59.400]  the people like Bill Gates who are tax exempt and the Rockefellers who are tax exempt, but own
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:05.560]  real companies who are always lobbying for higher taxes and more regulation to shut down the real
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:12.680]  economy because they're globalist, they're offshore, they're outside of it. You just don't
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:20.040]  understand. And that's why the people perish for lack of knowledge. And I could hear the condescension
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.880]  in your voice. You sound like a nice person who believes they're enlightened and he was going
[01:46:23.880 --> 01:46:29.880]  to call up and enlighten me, a guy wearing a camouflage deer hunting shirt, because that's
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:43.640]  what I felt like wearing today and a college dropout failure. I'm just so evil. It's just amazing
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:51.000]  how much trouble we're in. People deserve an education. You mean like all the illegal aliens
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:58.360]  getting free education in many areas? I mean, Obama taking billions of dollars of taxpayer
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:04.680]  money and then giving it to companies to build electric cars that nobody buys in Europe.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:17.080]  I mean, the insurance companies publicly wrote, publicly wrote
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.280]  the healthcare plan. And I saw their lobbies talking about it in the Wall Street Journal.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:32.600]  I saw the plan. It didn't cover preexisting. It was going to increase prices, screw everything up.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:38.120]  I know about the year-long waiting list or more for brain surgery in England. I know what Eugenics
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:43.320]  is. I understand the philosophy of the nanny state. And this guy calls up thinking the government's
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:57.000]  going to help him. You just don't understand it. It's invincible ignorance is what it is. Domestic
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.960]  wealth that's in this country, if you took it all, all of the, quote, wealthy people in this
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:09.560]  country's money, it's 2 trillion. The country's deficit is 14.4, 14.5. They're talking about
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:16.840]  propping up the 79 trillion in derivatives of Bank of America only. That guy doesn't want to talk
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:22.440]  about 79 trillion. He doesn't want to talk about Ponzi schemes. He doesn't want to talk about the
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:30.200]  real world going on or cancer viruses and vaccines or global governance or fluoride. It's all we need
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:40.920]  to get the 1% when it's the 1 tenth of 1%. 6,000 superclass minions, less than 20 elite families,
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:47.640]  a committee no bigger than 300 on record. And I have members, former members of MI6 on exposing
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:53.800]  this who are setting up a collectivist world government where they run our lives and 99%
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:49:01.080]  of us are total slaves and you just won't listen and will not get it. The power to tax is the power
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:10.120]  to destroy. Somebody make an $125,000 a year in this country pays 35% in federal tax. They pay
[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:19.400]  9% in social security on top of that. Do the math. Do the math. That's 44%. Then they pay state income
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:25.160]  taxes. They pay state franchise taxes. They pay water taxes. They pay gas taxes. I don't have
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:31.000]  time to go through all this for you. You're somebody I guess making $60,000, $70,000 a year,
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:35.720]  I'd guess 100,000. You're there. They take the money out of your check. You feel good. That's
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:41.320]  great. I should have kept that guy on. I bet you money he doesn't have employees. He may have people
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:50.360]  he directs. They're not his employees. I bet you money. You don't know. I end up paying about
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:58.200]  62% of what I quote, keep. And by the way, I make the decision to put most of it back into
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:04.040]  this operation because who wants more things? It's a hassle. Only mentally ill people want to
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:11.400]  just keep piling junk up. Now land, organizations, that's different. That's value. That's employees.
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:15.880]  That's systems. Many of the good, wealthy people that are out there that are fighting the globalists,
[01:50:15.880 --> 01:50:21.160]  they are at the top of huge systems, giant things they have to manage, thousands if not hundreds
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:26.520]  of thousands of people that totally depend on them. And then you think about those people that
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:32.440]  depend on you, think about how you can make more money to pay them more, how you can make your
[01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:38.600]  organization stronger and you get somebody, you know, I am somebody who was going to community
[01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.480]  college thinking about going to regular college and to found it to be worthless and who at 21
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:52.040]  years of age already had a local radio show by this by my work. But see, that's a failure.
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:59.560]  I don't have the magic ring of Mordor saying I went to one of these football worship facilities.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:06.600]  What happened, man? You used to be energetic, happy and wow, did the ladies love you? Now
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:12.600]  you fall asleep on the couch, irritable and out of shape. Don't be that guy. Call now for a risk-free

[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:06.200]  Last July, a rare webinar was released that has since transformed lives all around the world.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.240]  Now, viewed by over 100,000 people, the movement is growing stronger than ever.

[01:53:52.280 --> 01:54:14.680]  Go to www.waterwebinar.com now. I'll say this. One reason to go to college and to go to fraternities
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:21.320]  is to get into networks and to be from a certain college, certain fraternities, tribalism.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:28.840]  Very useful. It's great to send your daughters to college. Let's be honest, a lot of people send
[01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:35.720]  their daughters to colleges and sororities to meet the wealthy male. Wealthy families try to pair
[01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:42.360]  their daughters up with wealthy males from similar class, similar background. If you don't, your
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:47.640]  daughter is going to end up marrying some miscreant or somebody you think is a problem.
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:54.760]  I get it and I understand it. It's just that a lot of people are getting college degrees and
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:01.880]  then they can't do anything with them. That's my point. Side issue, I said I'd take your calls
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:05.880]  and I'm really not taking your calls. As you notice, we got Bob Chapman coming up. I'm going to
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.360]  start going to your calls here in a moment. I got my confrontation with a domestic checkpoint
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:17.240]  coming up, some new checkpoints that are in the niche. They're saying they're going to bury
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:22.600]  Gaddafi at sea just like Ben Laden. You start to wonder if that video is even real. I mean,
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.960]  they can fake anything. They've been caught lying so much. I would be remiss if I said that I
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:32.600]  didn't question it, but it looks real. My gut tells me they really killed him. My gut's always
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:38.680]  right, but I just don't know. They're known liars. What do you think? What do you think out there?
[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:45.160]  I know this. Warren Buffett made a bunch of money off government bailouts. He's out promoting
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:51.400]  taxes on rich people because he's exempt the way he's written the laws and being offshore,
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:57.080]  just like General Electric. If you want jobs, you should say, hey, we're going to have government
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:03.000]  contracts and government bailout. Why is General Electric moving to Europe? Why is General Motors
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:08.280]  taking bailout money and moving to Brazil? They're just like, 1% get them. I want to raise
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:13.240]  taxes. I want to get the 1% because all these specials building this up the last year, I told
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:19.320]  you all over the news, they have Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, George Soros going, the rich are
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:24.200]  horrible. We've got to get them. I want to pay more taxes. These are the guys that got the laws
[01:56:24.200 --> 01:56:30.440]  written where their tax exempt. And then people sit there sitting in their apartment with their
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:34.520]  two or three college degrees or whatever going, I don't have a job where I can't pay off my student
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.880]  loans. My job doesn't pay enough. He's right. He's rich and he wants to pay more, but Congress won't
[01:56:39.880 --> 01:56:46.680]  do it. You're being screwed. You're being cheated. You're being manipulated again. Is there no end
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:50.600]  to the level of bamboozling you won't buy into?
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:57:01.160]  When this country on average had about a 10% tax rate previous in 1913, we had 10% growth rates
[01:57:01.160 --> 01:57:06.920]  a year. Our average has been about 3% since then. And that's with Koch numbers. I mean,
[01:57:06.920 --> 01:57:13.080]  globalism and high taxes don't work. Don't you get it? Europe's falling apart. North Korea,
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:18.680]  a nice example. But the ruling insiders like it because they're exempt from everything.
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:24.840]  But you don't seem to want to understand that. You can't understand that.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:33.560]  Probably that college education you got. It's like dog training the professor when you agree
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:38.600]  with what they're saying or I even did test where I'd write a patriotic paper and get a horrible
[01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:43.080]  grade. I'd write a horrible globalist thing as a test. And who would you like to have coffee after
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:51.560]  class? I mean, I was like, that's it. I'm out of here. I did it a few times and I think anthropology,
[01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:57.720]  everything was political. It didn't matter what class it was. Psychology, sociology, because I
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:00.840]  was taking all those because I found them interesting. And it was just all anti-America,
[01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:06.040]  anti-gun, anti-white person. I was just sitting there going, this is a bunch of crud. And I'd
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:12.760]  write a paper exposing all that and I'd get a, you know, a C. And then I'd write some anti-American
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:29.320]  garbage. You've woken up. Hey, plus, no. One guy was like this. Amazing. And I had straight A's,
[01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:36.280]  especially in art class. But it was just, it was like a waste of time, just a complete joke.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:43.080]  I mean, I've got a North Korea if I wanted to live like that. You are listening to GCN.

[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:30.360]  Hey, get this. Kurt Nemo's got an article about it.
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:37.800]  It's headline, Did Navy Use Spice Bus to Intimidate Sailors on Osama Boat into Silence?
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:44.360]  Good headline, Nemo, but it was probably just read. Did Navy set up Osama Bin Laden Barrel at
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:50.040]  Sea Sailors to Cover Up or something like that? Because that's what it looks like.
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:57.720]  49 of the 64 sailors that were involved in the detail dumping his body supposedly
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:01:02.680]  have been dishonorably discharged for supposedly taking some designer drug called Spice.
[02:01:02.680 --> 02:01:09.720]  Okay, I promise we're going to get to your calls early because I know you've been holding and I
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:20.440]  ended up getting digressed off for 30 minutes or 25 minutes debating some guy about college education
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:27.240]  being overpriced and a lot of the degrees being next to worthless. And then the first comment on the
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:36.600]  and this was even posted this comment before I even had that debate. So it must be a new talking
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:43.800]  point or something. Hey, Alex, where did your father acquire the education necessarily related
[02:01:43.800 --> 02:01:48.520]  to his particular field of work as a dentist? Did he receive it at college or from reading
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:55.640]  from a John Burt society? Well, that's, see, that's another strongman. I just said he wanted
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:02:00.680]  to be a doctor or an engineer or something. These colleges are definitely needed. Hey,
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.000]  Bob Chapman, before we get into all the big moves in Europe and gold and silver and your view on the
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:13.240]  Qaddafi situation and more briefly going over Bob Chapman, I know Bob's got some degrees and was
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:17.240]  in the army and the rest of we got into this whole college bubble debate with a guy earlier.
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.960]  You were the biggest private silver goldbroker biggest newsletter for a while till you retired.
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:28.280]  You really need no introduction. And you also helped publish the
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:35.240]  a lot of books on the New World Order and also the Gary Allen report.
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:42.760]  But what's your view? What's your view on college and is there a big college bubble? Has it become
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:51.080]  pretty much a scam? I was always of the opinion having attended college that half the people who
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:58.440]  were there shouldn't have been there. And they there wasn't a need for them. And many of them
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:05.080]  didn't qualify. And that's really pointed out after the freshman year in most schools. If you
[02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:14.440]  look at the record, you'll see that approximately 43 to 49% dropout. And that's that's a pretty high
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:20.040]  percentage, which bears out what I said. But what about my point of that? A lot of your CEOs,
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:23.880]  business, pioneers, either quit college or didn't go to college.
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:33.000]  That's true. And there's a number of reasons. In the olden days, they used to have a selective
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:39.480]  service draft. And so they might draft you and then you you were in school, you get drafted. And
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:45.560]  then when you went to come back, it was boring or you were too old and that sort of thing.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:55.720]  But the the college, it all depends on what you're going for. And you pointed that out
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:02.360]  just now, a doctor or an engineer in business, being able to run a business as an accountant.
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:09.400]  I mean, you've got to go to university for that. Or some sort of school to teach you that. And
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:15.800]  there were a lot of courses in college that are needless. And there's a lot of courses of study
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:23.320]  that really don't pay. Well, that's my point is they've got so much archaic stuff now that they
[02:04:23.320 --> 02:04:28.360]  make you learn at college. It's worthless. I use the example of RTF. I was already doing RTF on
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:32.840]  my own. So I knew what they were teaching me was 10 to 20 years old and worthless.
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:41.720]  Well, I had a running battle with the professors at the school that I went to.
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:46.760]  And the only reason they didn't throw me out of college was that I had two uncles who were
[02:04:46.760 --> 02:04:50.920]  professors there. So I think they thought second of it, but I had to do it lobbying.
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:57.560]  You know, economics one year, I had professor was all for it.
[02:04:57.560 --> 02:04:59.400]  Stay there. Stay there. Let's talk about when we come back.

[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:17.240]  Okay, so we were told that the Easter Bunny, who some have been lauding, was buried at sea.
[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:26.680]  And now out of the entire Navy, it's the sailors that were directly involved in burying him at sea.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:35.240]  49 of 64 who have been kicked out of the Navy and gotten in all this trouble
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:43.160]  for supposedly using some designer drug that they got on the planet Arrakis called Spice.
[02:08:43.720 --> 02:08:50.200]  I'm being sarcastic. They had some drug in that book in Dune. Did Navy use Spice Bus to intimidate
[02:08:50.200 --> 02:08:56.520]  sailors on a Sama boat into silence? I want to get to your calls. I want to get to the big
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:02.360]  developments on the EU and this new private banking dictatorship with Bob Chapman. We were
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:11.240]  discussing as we segued out of that last hour where I was discussing higher education and the
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:17.960]  fact that more and more you're paying too much for the type of jobs you're going to be able to get
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:23.720]  with those degrees in part because this country's been deindustrialized. And it's back in the news
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:30.920]  that General Electric has a 47, a 57, excuse me, 57% increase in profits this last quarter
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:38.600]  while moving the jobs overseas. And the new electric car that was given a $529 million
[02:09:39.800 --> 02:09:50.760]  taxpayer goodie and that must be run by Obama contributors. Car company gets US loan built
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:57.320]  cars in Finland. I mean, I've got a stack of these articles just today. That's why you can't get a
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:10:02.680]  good job. That's why the standard of living is dropping. That's why the country's falling apart.
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:09.080]  And no amount, Bob, what about this? You know, as a long-term economist, researcher, somebody who's
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:14.120]  called the markets with great precision, this guy was saying we've got to raise taxes to equalize
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:22.520]  it with the 1%. Well, it's not even true that it's 1%. It's more like 4% that owns around 40% of the
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:28.200]  country. And I've gone over those numbers and I brought up the fact that Kennedy cut taxes
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:35.720]  massively and that tax receipts increased. And this guy just couldn't understand me, Bob. So what's
[02:10:35.720 --> 02:10:43.400]  your take on that? Well, I think the key to the whole thing is very simple, tariffs on goods and
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:55.960]  services and being able to pencil in when a country deliberately reduces the value of their currency
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:02.440]  versus other countries, primarily the dollar, which is still the world's reserve currency.
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:07.960]  That's the key right there. You don't have to do anything else. And all those jobs are going to
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:15.400]  come back. And of course, you do have to do something else. And that's to do away with the law,
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:22.280]  which says that transnational corporations who make money off, sure, can keep it off, sure,
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:30.120]  and don't have to pay any US taxes. And if you kill those two, millions and millions of jobs
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:36.280]  will return. It is that simple. But the social engineers, they know that. So they're the robber
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:41.880]  barons. They're at war with the real economy. Their problem is the free market is so good and so
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:47.160]  powerful, it threatens their monopoly. They're always trying to shut down competition. That's
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:52.600]  their own stated mission. And this guy's like, well, you don't have a college degree, Alex. I do.
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:58.760]  And we need to raise taxes. And they just don't live in the real world. It's so elementary.
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:03.720]  And but they condescend and they lecture and they just don't understand it. They think
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:07.560]  they're going to redistribute wealth. They don't get that the ultra rich
[02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:11.320]  are trying to get rid of their competition and have already shut the country down.
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:18.040]  And that effectively is what it amounts to. And you know, eight years ago,
[02:12:18.040 --> 02:12:24.440]  those corporations were allowed to bring back $350 billion at five and a quarter percent tax
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:30.440]  instead of 35. And they were supposed to create jobs. They created no jobs that's been proven
[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:35.800]  that they took the money, bought the shares in their companies, ran the stock up and dumped
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:40.840]  their options for hundreds of billions of dollars. Now they want to bring it back again. Only this
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:47.560]  time it's 2.2 billion at nine percent, not five and a quarter. It's robbery. That will cost the
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:55.480]  American taxpayer somewhere around $700 billion at a time when the American economy desperately
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:13:03.320]  needs those taxes. Well, you're right. I want to get to some calls, Bob, because they've been
[02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:09.800]  holding so long quickly. And then I want to get into four X dollar slumps to record low versus
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:15.720]  yen. I want to talk about this seesawing where Europe or Asia and bloats, dollar goes up.
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.760]  And then weeks later, dollar goes down and it's this, it looks like a seesaw, but really it's a
[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:28.760]  sinking in a coordinated way as the G20 has said. And gold's way up today, where you see
[02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:36.440]  all of that going. And I also want to bring up a couple other issues for you. But what's your
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:44.040]  take first on the whole reported killing of Muammar Gaddafi? And now the announcement,
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:52.040]  I heard the U.S. Ambassador of the U.N. today on Fox News, what Bill Richardson,
[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:57.560]  he was saying they want to try to invade as soon as possible or figure out a way to go into
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:05.800]  into Syria. I mean, where does this end? It doesn't. They do anything they want.
[02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:15.320]  And of course, MI6 and CIA ran the operation in Libya. The stupidest thing they could have
[02:14:15.320 --> 02:14:20.840]  ever done was kill Gaddafi. Because they could have taken him, put him in jail,
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:27.320]  used him for show trials, kept his mouth shut by keeping him away from the public.
[02:14:27.320 --> 02:14:33.000]  They could have got miles and miles of propaganda out of this guy.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.320]  And then later killed him like Milošević. Then later poisoned him like Milošević.
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:42.040]  Well, that's what they probably would have done eventually. But the point is,
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:46.120]  they were dumb to have executed him from their point of view.
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:50.840]  Yeah, but you know why they executed him. You know why they executed him and then
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:55.000]  admitted it and then now say, oh, the crowd accidentally shot him. And again,
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.640]  Easter bunnies are real and bin Laden was thrown in the ocean. They killed him because he'd made
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:04.680]  all these deals with Blair, Sarkozy, private business deals. This really happened because
[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:08.920]  the word is, I know you've talked about this, there were actual cash payoffs to these guys.
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:13.880]  And so he had, you know, he didn't braced Obama. I mean, they really set him up.
[02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:16.920]  So they just wanted to get rid of him because dead men tell no tales.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:21.240]  And in addition to that, they wanted to steal the country and what's in it.
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:30.040]  And it's loaded, you know, for water, aquifers, the best oil perhaps in the world,
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:33.240]  the second largest oil inventory in the Middle East.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:40.360]  They have a hundred million dollars in their sovereign investment fund.
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:45.800]  That's disappeared. I mean, I haven't heard where that went after they froze it.
[02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:53.000]  And there was a lot to steal there. How many billions total Bob in gold? And I think you said
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:59.480]  a hundred million. You mean a hundred billion, right? In gold? No, no, in the sovereign fund.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:06.360]  Yeah, a hundred billion. What did I say? I may have misheard you. The point is,
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:10.200]  there's hundreds of billions of goodies, trillions in oil, that big airport,
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:14.600]  which they're now using to run drone attacks. And they're saying we've got to give our rights up
[02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:19.800]  immediately, Bob, because Al Qaeda that's been given the country got shoulder-launched service
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:27.320]  to air missiles. That's right. And every time I look behind a tree, I see an Al Qaeda operative.
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:33.000]  Oh, it's so ridiculous. I mean, anybody who would believe this
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:40.120]  has got to be one dumb person. Oh, man, Bob, I tell you. And I'm being kind.
[02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:46.360]  Hey, what do you make of the fact that Janet Napolitano admitted, Mr. Napolitano admitted,
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:52.440]  that he admitted in congressional testimony yesterday that indeed they are releasing even
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:58.360]  felon illegals now if they decide. So they're just ignoring federal law and Obama is engaged
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:02.040]  in a mass amnesty. I mean, just the lawlessness of these people.
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:09.560]  Yeah, it's without precedent. But they've always been soft on crime and really soft.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:17.640]  But why do you think he's so bold? Why is Janet Napolitano? Why is he as a man so bold to even
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:20.600]  admit that to Congress? Is this just part of an in-your-face thing?
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:27.080]  I think so. I think they, and you see the same thing in the gold, in silver markets,
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:32.440]  in the commodity market, and then in the opposite side, in the stock market, in the bond markets,
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:38.120]  they manipulate them. And then they just, they do it so obviously, you know, a professional in
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:44.600]  that field. And I used to be a tape reader. I was a trader for 25 years. I know what they're
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:50.440]  doing and how they're doing it. And they don't care. And it's the same thing with Napolitano
[02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:58.440]  and Obama. And before him, George Bush, they just don't care. Why are they so arrogant?
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:03.960]  Because they think they're going to win and enslave the whole bunch of us.
[02:18:09.160 --> 02:18:14.600]  Well, they certainly are lunatics. I'll tell you that. And, you know, Janet Napolitano,
[02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:20.760]  he says he doesn't like being criticized by us a month ago, but that's why I'm going to continue.
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:24.680]  I mean, he's a man. He can take it, Bob. Easily.
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:29.000]  What kind of person do you think Mr. Napolitano is?
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.520]  I'd rather not say. Because I know what you know, and I'm not going to put it on the
[02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:44.680]  ear like the last time. I mean, no, I mean, Mr. Napolitano spies everywhere. I'm convinced that
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:51.400]  Mr. Napolitano is a guy masquerading as a woman and not doing a very good job of it.
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:57.560]  You're probably right. Because you're right about most things.
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:03.560]  Hold on one second. Jared was saying something about Mr. Napolitano. What's that?
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:08.760]  Yeah. I mean, when do they think of the idea to stick their hands down our pants when
[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:13.480]  Mr. Napolitano is shaving in the morning, the head of Homeland Security? What do you think, Bob?
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:16.920]  Can't answer. Don't know.
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:23.000]  All right. I don't usually stoop to humor, but at a certain point I'm getting tired of it.
[02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:29.080]  Bob, I'm sure you know, you know, they ask for it because, you know, it would be better if they
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:37.160]  just come out and say, well, look, this is my way of living and I am comfortable with it. And if
[02:19:37.160 --> 02:19:43.800]  you're not, that's too bad. Well, I'm not even getting into the sexual preference of Pat Napolitano
[02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:48.360]  or whatever its name is. I'm talking about the fact that it's so archetypal to have some jack
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:58.600]  boot, amorphous, homaphradite, the crone running around openly. It's hairmongering. I mean, I'm
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:04.440]  sick of it's hairmongering and drag. Get it out of my way. Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Cross

[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:39.000]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve
[02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:43.080]  us debt. This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:47.240]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson,

[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:10.840]  All right, let's jam in some of your calls. I apologize for having you sit there on hold.
[02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:14.760]  Bob Chapman's our guest. I'm going to get into some of the new checkpoints around the country
[02:24:14.760 --> 02:24:19.240]  coming up and what's happening with the economy with Bob. But right now, this has been holding
[02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:23.080]  the longest. We'll go to Tim and Keith and others. Tim in Utah, thanks for holding. Welcome to the
[02:24:23.080 --> 02:24:30.760]  Airwaves Worldwide. Hi, this is the real Tim. Yes, sir. Welcome. Hey, Alex. Coincidentally enough,
[02:24:30.760 --> 02:24:38.600]  I just named Mr. Napolitano my control freak of the week on my website. Well, good, but you need
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:43.160]  to honor him. He's very hardworking, head of on land security. Well, eventually you might be
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:48.280]  moved up to the Hall of Fame on my website. So that'll be quite lustrous for him. Good. Hey,
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:53.880]  about a month ago, you had on the website a Star Trek episode
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:58.840]  that pretty much explained what the globalists were up to. I don't know if you remember that.
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:04.920]  Yeah, I know. I forget the title of it. Day of the Dove. Yeah, Day of the Dove. But it's edited
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:12.360]  together with clips. So I think the title of the video remix is something. If you type in Star Trek
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:19.080]  Episode 911 Truth, it should come up and it's an alien. Well, why don't you tell folks the plot?
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:26.040]  Well, basically, the alien captures some Klingons on board the Enterprise and he tries to keep a
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:32.680]  balance of power and force the two different crews to fight each other. And from that fight,
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:38.680]  he gains energy. And so at some point, Kirk figures out what's going on. And so enough of that, let's
[02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:43.560]  do it. And by the way, Roddenberry was a top alumina. So that's why those shows are so good,
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:48.120]  even though they're cheesy. It's got deep, illuminati messages and all of it. And so they're
[02:25:48.120 --> 02:25:52.840]  telling you what they're doing in that episode. And it's the balance of power. It's the global
[02:25:52.840 --> 02:25:57.720]  force on the ship. It doesn't want one side to ever win. It's playing them off against each other
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:01.640]  to extract the energy, which in this case is global consolidation of power.
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.960]  Always have to have an enemy, whether it's the Russians or the Japanese or the,
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:10.600]  you know, whatever. People don't get it. The Pentagon, the troops are good people,
[02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.480]  but the Pentagon is on record funding and creating the terror groups. So a decade later,
[02:26:15.480 --> 02:26:19.720]  they can go fight them. I mean, this is a multi trillion dollar a year deal. Of course,
[02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:25.960]  they go out and manufacture it. And the fighting and dying is real. Let's get Bob Chapman's take
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:31.880]  on that. Bob, any comments? Absolutely correct. And if you look back through history, it's all
[02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:37.480]  there. They've done it over and over again. And, but most people don't look at history and that's
[02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:44.280]  unfortunate. Yeah. The great part about YouTube is for a while, they had all the old Star Trek
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:49.000]  episodes on there and a bunch of other old TV and I don't watch regular TV, but I was going there
[02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:55.640]  and watch it. But now you've got to like register and all this crud CBS to watch it. But in fact,
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:02.040]  guys, will you search Star Trek 911 truth info wars.com? And I give people the exact,
[02:27:02.040 --> 02:27:06.760]  exact name of that video. It's only got like 60,000 views. It needs like 10 million,
[02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:10.600]  because it's only like four or five minutes long. Don't you think it's one of the most
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:15.400]  informative things out there, Tim? Right. And I had been telling people for years about that
[02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:19.880]  exact episode. So it really thrilled me to see that you guys put on the website. So I spread
[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:24.760]  it around to my friend. We didn't do that. Some listener made it. And then I happened to see it
[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:30.760]  and we link to it. That's what's so powerful about YouTube being over half the video views in the
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:35.000]  world online is you can put something out there. And if it's good, if you send it to us, we'll
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.840]  link to it and get the attention it needs. Thank you so much, Keith. Let's talk to Tim in Utah.
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:45.320]  I already talked to them in Utah. Let's talk to Keith in California. Keith are on the air. Welcome.
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:53.000]  How are you doing, Alex? Good. Yeah, I just had a comment on the troops coming home.
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:01.480]  I'm kind of wondering, what do you all think that the troops are coming home, maybe to
[02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:06.840]  deal with Occupy Wall Street and all these different movements going on, because they're
[02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:10.680]  getting a little bit worried for the start of their troops home. So they have to police it here.
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:15.640]  Yeah. Look, they triggered the Occupy Wall Street and people send me emails and get mad and don't
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:21.640]  understand it. I'm not saying Occupy Wall Street's bad inherently. It's on record that the adbusters,
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:28.360]  George Soros, made the call. People that were reasonably angry showed up. Then the system
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:33.320]  could use them as a backdrop and speak for them. It's a diverse, good group of people on average.
[02:28:33.320 --> 02:28:38.040]  You got some around half that do want to redistribute. They don't call themselves socialists.
[02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:43.160]  They just think it's fair because George Soros told them about it. And I'm rich and I want to pay
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:47.880]  more of my money, even though I got the loss pass to be exempt. And yes, they are bringing
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:52.440]  them home and be part of Northcom, but not most of them. They'll have a few parades and some things
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:57.800]  to make you think they came home. They're massing in Kuwait. Hey, Bob, what's your intel on an Iran
[02:28:57.800 --> 02:29:06.520]  strike? I don't have anything new. I just know that they're talking in terms of Syria and Iran,
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:12.760]  and they want to do it. What their time is going to be, I don't know. But I know that they want
[02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:19.640]  to do that. They've wanted to do Iran for a long, long time. The troops in Kuwait, but a lot of
[02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:26.120]  them are going to come home. And some of them are going to go with Northcom, but a lot of them are
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:33.160]  going to be getting out as well. All right. Anything else there you want to add, Keith?
[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:39.400]  Yeah, I wanted to add on about the Occupy Wall Street. The gentleman I called in earlier, the
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:45.720]  condescending guy, he was speaking about the call his level kids out there. I'm going to have to
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:49.640]  put you on hold. Don't hang up, Keith. We're coming right back to you, and we'll get into the economy
[02:29:49.640 --> 02:29:57.000]  with Bob Chapman and then more calls. The empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:08.840]  Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[02:31:08.840 --> 02:31:13.080]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed
[02:31:13.080 --> 02:31:19.160]  to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the

[02:31:35.480 --> 02:31:43.080]  eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to

[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:09.800]  our nation's fragile food supply. Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming and I think
[02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:15.400]  it's important for my listeners to do three things right away. Number one, study the past.
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:21.640]  History really does repeat itself. Number two, learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[02:32:22.680 --> 02:32:29.560]  Number three, take decisive action. A perfect storm is brewing or a global food crisis.
[02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:34.680]  That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices, Empty Shelves,
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:40.760]  warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the
[02:32:40.760 --> 02:32:47.160]  crisis hits. This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com. You'll also get a
[02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:53.320]  free copy of supermarket survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again, that website is

[02:33:23.800 --> 02:33:34.280]  That's right. Motorhead, dead men tell no tales.
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:40.920]  Muammar Gaddafi, bye-bye. I think it's real. They're just talking about barrel that's seen
[02:33:40.920 --> 02:33:45.080]  out to try to prop up the, some have been lauding things, so we knew he was already dead.
[02:33:46.040 --> 02:33:50.040]  And we knew it was a fake situation room photo of them watching the video,
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:54.360]  the helicopter blowing up, the other seals being killed later. We knew that was coming.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:34:00.920]  We knew it was fake eight years before and predicted it. We don't just say something's a lie
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:07.560]  because it's fun to say it's a lie. No, they're getting rid of somebody who had done business
[02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:16.440]  deals with them. And as far as bad guys go, Gaddafi was a bad guy, but compared to the
[02:34:16.440 --> 02:34:24.280]  New World Order, he was nothing. I want to finish up with this caller about the guy calling in about,
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:27.960]  we got to have balance, we got to have redistribution. And I explained to him,
[02:34:27.960 --> 02:34:34.280]  the average American who makes over $100,000 a year is paying around 62% in taxes. He can look that up.
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:40.440]  And then if you add all the other VAT stuff that's hidden, it's not official VAT, but the
[02:34:40.440 --> 02:34:46.680]  tax is built in, it's higher. The Globalist at the OECD Occupation Organization of Economic
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:52.840]  Cooperative Development Globalist Organization have said they want over an 80% global tax rate.
[02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:59.160]  They call the US a tax avoidance center. And so you've got all these people as globalist
[02:34:59.160 --> 02:35:04.600]  policies shut down the economy and the society. And the globalists are saying we want to raise taxes
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:10.840]  again. And then this guy calls in and says, I did good with college. And I think we should take the
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:17.800]  money of the 1%. The caller wanted to comment on that. And so let's go back to Keith in California.
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:24.040]  Keith, go ahead. Yeah, what I was trying to say about the Occupy Wall Street, I was at Occupy SF
[02:35:24.040 --> 02:35:30.200]  and a part of that little group of Occupy Wall Street. He's bringing up these glorious college
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:36.040]  kids and basically how intelligent they are. I was out amongst all of them. And I asked them,
[02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:42.200]  what do you guys stand for? You guys want socialism? You guys want capitalism? What do you want?
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:45.320]  They handed me slips of paper and told me to go to this website and I can
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:49.880]  learn what they're all about. They're trying to protest something. They don't know what the
[02:35:49.880 --> 02:35:53.880]  hell they're protesting. They're just sitting there with a blank standard face. They didn't even
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:58.680]  know what they're doing. Listen, we've got footage that we didn't put in the film because of time,
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:03.880]  but we ought to just dump the whole exchange on the YouTube from like five years ago in New York.
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:10.120]  I guess it's six, seven years ago. Time flies. It was the RNC 2004. And there were these communists
[02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:15.880]  all over the street when they called themselves communists and Maoists. And they were literally
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:21.800]  18-year-old zombies. And I'd walk over politely and say, well, tell me about communism. And they'd
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:27.240]  say, check this website. And I'd go, we're in an anarchy shirt. Isn't that the opposite of communism?
[02:36:27.240 --> 02:36:32.920]  Shout out, capitalist pig. And I'd be like, no, no, no, tell me your views. And they looked like
[02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:39.320]  they hadn't been out of their mother's basements playing video games in their entire life. They were
[02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:46.840]  pasty-skinned, runted. They looked like they'd had lobotomies. I mean, literally, they looked like
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:55.000]  they'd been run over by cars repeatedly. And they just, they had nothing but condescension.
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:00.040]  I mean, do they have any idea of the horrors of collectivism? Now, the bankers through big government
[02:37:00.760 --> 02:37:05.240]  have already stolen most of the wealth. And so, yeah, you've got the elite standing there with
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:10.360]  all the stolen wealth saying, let's raise taxes to get the stolen wealth. But they've written it
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:15.400]  where they're exempt. And they're not going to give the chicken feed to the folks begging for
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:23.240]  communism. They're going to steal that as well. And the poor idiots out there don't understand it.
[02:37:23.240 --> 02:37:29.880]  I appreciate your call, sir. Bob Chapman, how do you reach out to somebody? It's like the military.
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:35.000]  You go, especially if you get into special forces, you go through all this hell. You're told you're
[02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.960]  part of the elite. You tend to psychologically defend whatever you're told in the future because
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:44.280]  you're part of this elite and you don't question because you're a winner. Everybody else is a
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:49.000]  loser. And a lot of these people, they'll tell me, they'll actually point at their ring and say,
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:54.280]  I went to college. You didn't. You don't understand socialism is good. And I'm like, well, I could
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:38:00.280]  have got a college degree, but I went out and, you know, started my own media system and they're
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:05.880]  like, sure you would have gotten a degree. You couldn't. So it's this idea that that is obtaining
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:12.280]  success in life and to have a college degree as if I couldn't get a college degree. But I could,
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:18.440]  with my own bootstraps, with zero help, start a major media platform, reaching tens of millions
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:24.840]  of people a week. And again, it's this fake elitism. It's like people that join a country club.
[02:38:24.840 --> 02:38:29.720]  And so they think they're better than everybody or people that, you know, ride a certain motorcycle
[02:38:29.720 --> 02:38:33.560]  or so they're better than everybody. I don't care if you like country clubs or motorcycles,
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:38.840]  but it's this idea that you're better than everybody because you're part of a group. It's
[02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:42.040]  mindless tribalism. You see where I'm going, Bob?
[02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:49.960]  Bob. Envy and jealousy. Because you did it on your own. You didn't need the help of university.
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:55.560]  You were outstanding, but they did need that help. They had to work within the structure.
[02:38:55.560 --> 02:38:59.320]  You didn't. You went outside the box and did it on your own. You didn't need,
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:01.080]  need anybody else to tell you what to do.
[02:39:05.560 --> 02:39:07.800]  But see, for them, they say that's a failure.
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:14.200]  Bob. Well, they can go right on. It's thinking about that because you obviously have been a
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:22.520]  wonderful success. And many people who didn't go to or finish college have been very, very
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:28.440]  successful in life. And so, and look, all we interested kids is in the issues.
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:38.040]  Bob. I saw this, Chris Hedges, on one of the television programs. And there were two moderators
[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:46.120]  and one of them, a man, I can't call him a gentleman, personally attacked Chris Hedges and
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:54.760]  called him a nut bar. And Chris says, why would you do such a thing? Why are you attacking me?
[02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:01.560]  I'm here to discuss the issues, not to be insulted. Well, that's what it is back again.
[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:07.480]  It's a derailing. I mean, they don't understand America was made great on low taxes. We have
[02:40:07.480 --> 02:40:13.160]  incredibly high taxes. And they're saying, give me higher taxes. They don't know that destroys the
[02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:18.520]  country. And they won't debate it because they know they're wrong. But it's something that they want.
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:29.080]  Yeah, but it's got to be willful because I'm not that smart, Bob. And I can see right through it.
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:35.560]  I mean, I don't understand how they get into being conned. They enjoy being taken for a ride.
[02:40:37.880 --> 02:40:43.560]  That's the way people are. It just simply is that way. Not everybody, but there are people
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:49.320]  like that. I mean, I've had bad people I've been friendly with for many, many years. They change
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:41:00.440]  totally. I can't believe it, but it happens. Well, what do we do when the bankers have stolen most
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:05.320]  the wealth and are now going to try to sick the general public on the middle class, telling them
[02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:10.120]  that the middle class is the elite? I mean, the globalists have stolen all this infrastructure.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.680]  And I want to take it back from them through law, but that can still get into a dangerous
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:20.280]  situation. We could trade out the banksters for whoever is in the government that brings them
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:25.560]  to justice and then repossesses all this wealth. Whoever repossesses all the stolen wealth is
[02:41:25.560 --> 02:41:31.080]  not going to want to give it up. It's a chance you have to take under the circumstances.
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:38.760]  The Irish saying, better the devil you know than the devil you don't know. And what that means is
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:46.040]  if you chop these guys off at the knees by letting their banks go under, taking their
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:53.960]  power structure from them, you've crippled them. They can no longer do anything to us through the
[02:41:53.960 --> 02:42:02.600]  system or a new system. And if the people on the other end who end up controlling the system
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:08.840]  after the bad guys are thrown out, if they turn out to be bad, well, I guess we have to have
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:13.800]  another change. Exactly. Justice be done, may the heavens fall. And I'm going to say something here.
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:17.880]  It's an epiphany I just had. Getting rid of the private central banks is important.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:23.640]  Replacing the Federal Reserve with the constitutional monetary system, the public being educated
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:28.680]  about it and not being some secretive thing behind marble fake, you know, federal buildings,
[02:42:28.680 --> 02:42:35.640]  that's in the right direction. But more importantly than even doing that is we've got to expose the
[02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:41.240]  philosophy of the ruling class that is eugenics, that is dumbing the public down, that is poisoning
[02:42:41.240 --> 02:42:48.280]  people. That is the power of these wicked people is the fractional reserve and derivatives banking
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:54.840]  combined. But their philosophy is their destructive intent. And more importantly than anything is
[02:42:54.840 --> 02:43:01.160]  exposing their collectivist mindset. They don't want collectivism to build people up like they've
[02:43:01.160 --> 02:43:08.760]  claimed. They want collectivism to consolidate and to exterminate. Because at the end of the day,
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:13.960]  there are predators who like to watch the world burn. And that for my deep research is the end
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:19.000]  of the day. That's why you don't bargain, you don't argue, you don't debate, you don't compromise,
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:23.800]  you go against them. Because as a man, it's nothing special. It's normal instinct.
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:27.880]  When the enemy tribes come into enslave and exterminate your people, because in most cultures,
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:33.160]  they didn't enslave the tribe, they just killed everybody. It's not time to joke around anymore.
[02:43:33.160 --> 02:43:37.640]  They're going to beat your kids brains out in front of you and then slit your throat next while
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:42.680]  you're tied down. You're going to have to gut up and go after as many of them as you can.
[02:43:42.680 --> 02:43:49.560]  And we're going to have to do that in the info war to identify them now. Okay. We have to identify
[02:43:49.560 --> 02:43:55.240]  the enemy now, identify what their system is, point it out to people and not get caught in the
[02:43:55.240 --> 02:44:01.080]  quagmire of these false debates. Because there's great power to a talk show host to involve yourself
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:09.880]  in the debate of the day and to take on the debate mask that is given. But this broadcast is all
[02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:16.120]  about getting outside of that paradigm, Bob. What's your take on that? I agree with you.
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:23.560]  And the only way that you can effectively do that is to educate. And that's what you're doing.
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:29.560]  You're educating people. I mean, the ideas and the facts that you come up with are astounding.
[02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:36.680]  And the research that goes into it, it kind of puts it on a platter for you listeners to say,
[02:44:36.680 --> 02:44:42.440]  gee, what did I think of that? And then that's going to open up their minds to inquire about
[02:44:42.440 --> 02:44:46.440]  things and they're going to find things that are hidden that they wouldn't find otherwise.
[02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:52.200]  So it's an educational process. Well, that's something I found as I learned more and more.
[02:44:52.760 --> 02:44:59.560]  I feel my tribal roots, which are designed to have my family continue. But I see the globalist
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:05.080]  pushing my tribal buttons. Kids having to pledge allegiance to the Mexican flag in public schools
[02:45:05.080 --> 02:45:11.640]  in Texas, all of this. And then that makes me tribally get threatened instead. We're all dead
[02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:17.320]  anyways. These are all human beings. They're playing into a tribal system. I'm playing into it.
[02:45:17.320 --> 02:45:22.200]  I've got to completely cut through all that and just reach directly out to these people,
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:27.800]  all of them, including military police, all of them. And just say right now, I know I'm right.
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:32.040]  Bob's right. We've done our homework. We've predicted everything that's unfolded. I'm getting
[02:45:32.040 --> 02:45:37.080]  chills right now. We've got to help humanity. We've got to break our conditioning. We've got
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:42.520]  to break out of our trance and we've got to really get reality or we don't have any future.
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:48.840]  These globalists are scientifically studying how humans operate, almost like they're aliens.
[02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:52.440]  They're not, but that's how they behave. Like at the beginning of World of Worlds,
[02:45:52.440 --> 02:45:58.200]  H.G. Wells, he admitted was a parable or an analogy of how the elite are studying us coldly
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:03.640]  as a scientist studies microbes. The Martians watched us and studied us and waited. And the
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:08.760]  globalists, all of them, Edward Bernays, all of them, that we talk about in the films,
[02:46:09.560 --> 02:46:15.880]  who run our society, they talk about how they studied us and how they see themselves as apart
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:24.280]  from us. And it's just so cold-blooded. And so we're in a Petri dish being manipulated.
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:29.240]  And I'm like the guy in the Truman Show. So are you, Bob. I don't know if you've seen that Jim
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:35.560]  Carrey movie where he realizes his whole life is fake. It's not like a physical matrix where we're
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:43.320]  in some pod. It's that this has built a virtual reality of fake culture, fake garbage, and it's
[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:47.160]  death. It's death. Folks, we've got to completely rethink everything.
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:55.480]  And that started in the late 1930s and really get under the way in the late 40s when television
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:47:07.080]  became into being. I remember when I was in school during the war, I was learning Latin
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:16.120]  in four years of it eventually, video video. And the teacher was explaining the video is coming
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:24.040]  and this is what it's going to be. And they use that very, very effectively. And today they get it
[02:47:24.040 --> 02:47:33.960]  down to a precise scientist. Sciences, you just pointed out. And yes, it is objects. And I think
[02:47:33.960 --> 02:47:39.640]  they're masters of the universe. And I've got news for them. There's piles of people out there who
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:44.920]  are smarter than they are. And if we can harness those people to understand what's going on,
[02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:49.640]  that's going to be one very important part of defeating these people.
[02:47:49.640 --> 02:47:54.680]  Well, that's what's happening. I'm talking to a lot of high powered people who thought they
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:58.760]  could join with the New World Order, even though they didn't totally agree with it to protect
[02:47:58.760 --> 02:48:03.240]  themselves or they could just stay invisible. And they're now realizing you can't make a deal
[02:48:03.240 --> 02:48:10.920]  with the devil. It's always you're going to get stabbed in the back, folks. And I don't want any
[02:48:10.920 --> 02:48:17.560]  part of all the horrible fruits that this evil system produces. I mean, you cannot make a deal
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:26.440]  with this. But you've very eloquently broken it down. And these people who know the public's
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:34.280]  unconscious, they revel in manipulating them. It'd be like going to a roller rink where they
[02:48:34.280 --> 02:48:39.960]  had seriously mentally retarded children and paying to go in and be able to beat them up
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:46.200]  as they cry and scream and run from you. I mean, what is the power trip of going in and
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:52.600]  besting someone who is in a coma? I mean, these elites are pathetic. They from birth try to
[02:48:52.600 --> 02:48:59.400]  chemically and societally, culturally hurt people so they can control them. And it's just,
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:02.360]  it is a crime against the very spirit of the universe.
[02:49:03.560 --> 02:49:12.040]  And you're so right. And you would think that maybe people like that would want to help people
[02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:18.520]  like that. But no, it's the opposite of that. And I've had experiences with those people who are
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:28.760]  so afflicted. I had a small bowling team of autistic children, and believe me, in teaching
[02:49:28.760 --> 02:49:36.920]  them, I was teaching them bowling. And in that process, I found that my patients only went so
[02:49:36.920 --> 02:49:45.800]  far. It was so hard to help them, but they went on and they won their Olympics in bowling,
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:54.280]  which was fantastic to them. And I was so proud of them. It was so difficult to do.
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:49:59.800]  Well, and to clarify my analogy, that's a great story you can share with us.
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:06.440]  I'm likening it to the elites aware of how humans operate. They live, we sleep,
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:12.680]  the John Carpenter idea of they're in the real world. We're sleeping in that when the public is
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:22.120]  asleep, societally, culturally, spiritually, manipulating a unconscious person is like beating
[02:50:22.120 --> 02:50:27.960]  up a man with no arms and no legs. It's not a challenge. And the globalists are attempting
[02:50:28.520 --> 02:50:35.240]  to induce people to have a fallen civilization. Civilizations fall on their own without help.
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:41.240]  The globalists are trying to induce a destruction of society so they can control it,
[02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:45.400]  and they say they're then going to reorganize it after they've reduced world population.
[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:53.000]  But that's not what's happening. I mean, that's bad enough. Once you allow yourself to do that,
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  just so you can play God, you have fallen so far. The truth is, these elitists just like to hurt
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.880]  people. You know, they've created this cosmology for why they do what they do. That's just a cover
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:13.160]  for mid-level technicians in it. At the end of it, this is a giant amusement park for psychopaths,
[02:51:13.160 --> 02:51:13.880]  is what it is.
[02:51:15.160 --> 02:51:16.280]  Happily explained.
[02:51:17.160 --> 02:51:18.200]  Yeah, well, I've had enough.
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:19.640]  That's a beautiful phrase.
[02:51:20.440 --> 02:51:24.040]  Well, I've had enough of them, Bob, and we are going to beat them. And there's something pure
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:32.840]  and crisp and fulfilling to go completely past the fear and to love life so much,
[02:51:32.840 --> 02:51:35.880]  you welcome death. And I'm free of these people.
[02:51:39.320 --> 02:51:43.480]  And even if they got me later and tortured me and turned me into a drugged out drone to roll
[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:49.160]  out in the public, it won't matter. In this time and space and my information and my spirit of
[02:51:49.160 --> 02:51:53.240]  liberty and your spirit of liberty, we've broadcasted it. We've shared it communally.
[02:51:53.240 --> 02:51:58.920]  We've shared other spirit of liberty. And we, this moment lives forever, Bob, and we will
[02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:02.920]  transcend this evil and they cannot stop us and we are outside their grasp.
[02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:12.440]  Absolutely. There's nothing they can do to stop us, even in death. People will use us
[02:52:13.320 --> 02:52:22.120]  as foundation for thinking again for freedom and outside of the control of these people.
[02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:25.720]  Just as we stand on the shoulders that you that you plant.
[02:52:27.080 --> 02:52:32.440]  Exactly. It's like a tree dies, but it's progeny goes on. And as long as we resist,
[02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:36.840]  that's why they always tell us resistance is futile. You can't win. You're going to lose,
[02:52:36.840 --> 02:52:41.320]  you know, this idea of defeat because they know the power of the individual.
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:45.960]  They actually know how weak they are. That's why they poison us and do all of this in a
[02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:51.720]  desperate attempt to control us, Bob. That's right. And that's why we get attacked all the time.
[02:52:54.280 --> 02:52:58.200]  You know, I love it. The more I get attacked, the more savage, the more lies,
[02:52:58.200 --> 02:53:04.680]  the more twisting it is such a fulfilling feeling to know that we are hitting paydirt
[02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:08.760]  when it comes to waking people up. The more I get attacked, the more I see you get attacked.
[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:14.120]  The more Ron Paul gets attacked, it just shows we're deep inside enemy territory,
[02:53:14.120 --> 02:53:17.960]  blasting the daylights out of them in the infall war. I mean, if people could see it,
[02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:24.200]  historically, spiritually, psychically, the new order is just bleeding out of every orifice right
[02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:34.280]  now and they're going down. They certainly are. I want to bring it. Go ahead. It's because of the
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:41.720]  educational process. And yes, it's not going to be easy. Who knows what the future holds as far as
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:48.600]  starvation, war, revolution. We really don't know. We hope those things don't happen,
[02:53:49.240 --> 02:53:53.480]  but these people being evil, they are perfectly capable of creating such things.
[02:53:57.480 --> 02:54:01.320]  Well, I just, we're going to go to Ted Anderson here to pop in with some news for us on the economy.
[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:05.880]  I want to get your take on it. A little bit of overdrive, Bob, but I remember being 11,
[02:54:05.880 --> 02:54:10.760]  12 years old and getting beat up every week off the school bus at school, you name it,
[02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:16.120]  by kids that had flunked with three grades. And it was such a good feeling instead of trying to
[02:54:16.120 --> 02:54:22.520]  avoid them when I started enjoying walking right into the midst of bullies. And it wasn't that I
[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:28.360]  even enjoyed the pain of the fights. It was, it was better spiritually to not hide from them.
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:33.480]  I mean, and just to go ahead and say, you want it, you got it. You may even kick my butt, but it's
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:37.320]  not going to be easy and you're not coming out of this and you're not going to get to enjoy it
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:40.600]  because the bullies want the fear, Bob. They want that fear.
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:47.800]  They thrive upon it and it's because they're insecure.
[02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:58.840]  Let's go to Ted Anderson. Bob, I want to ask Ted this question, but what do you
[02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:03.240]  make of the dollar plunging again? I mean, it's just this seesaw. What's happening in Europe
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:08.280]  with the big, well, I mean, they're saying an economic dictatorship, the end of total sovereignty
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:12.040]  in Europe, but they said they had a deal last week. Now they're saying it's falling through.
[02:55:12.040 --> 02:55:17.000]  What do you briefly think is going to happen? The Germans are standing there and they're saying,
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:21.880]  no, we're not going to do this. And it's the German people. They say, look, you know,
[02:55:21.880 --> 02:55:27.560]  you've had us for 66 years. We paid for the war. That's the end of it. We want to be on our own.
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:32.680]  And we're not going to continue to fund these countries where people don't give a darn or
[02:55:32.680 --> 02:55:41.720]  don't want to work. And we're not going to let you leverage the $500 billion that's been put up to
[02:55:41.720 --> 02:55:47.320]  bail out these countries. And we're not going to give you any more money. And most people don't
[02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:56.120]  know it, but in order to leverage that money, there has to be a vote, a referendum in Germany,
[02:55:56.840 --> 02:56:01.480]  as to whether they will allow, the people will allow them to leverage that money from
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:05.560]  $500 billion. And that's the whole point. The Euro's trying to announce we don't need that vote
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:11.160]  anymore. And the country's no longer have a say. That's pure dictatorship. It certainly is, but
[02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:15.880]  they're not going to get away with it. This is going to go on and on and on. It's not going to
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:20.600]  fall in the way they wanted it. And they're going to have to use the $500 billion that they've got.
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:25.160]  They're going to have to ring fence every country, which is circling the wagons.
[02:56:25.160 --> 02:56:32.440]  They're going to have to bail out every financial institution in their country that is in trouble.
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:39.400]  And the German taxpayer, the French taxpayer, and in America, the American taxpayer,
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:43.480]  they're going to pay for all that. We're talking about hundreds of trillions of dollars.
[02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:47.800]  Yes. Listen, we've got to end the main transmission to a bit of overdrive with Ted Anderson,
[02:56:47.800 --> 02:56:51.720]  but I briefly wanted to bring Ted in to give us his economic view, but also give a golden
[02:56:51.720 --> 02:56:56.840]  silver pitch. Golden silver have gone back up. I believe it's the time to get into golden silver
[02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:02.600]  because of overall currency devaluation. You see the dollar going down right now. And down the
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:06.760]  road, that's all it can do. Ted, what are some of the specials you've got today for folks?
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:11.160]  Well, right now, I mean, you're talking about what's going on in the economy and this type of
[02:57:11.160 --> 02:57:15.000]  thing. I mean, there's two things you should do. I mean, one, you should, if you haven't done it by
[02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:21.000]  now, the American dream video and Mark Dice's book and two silver dollars for 88 bucks. But the other
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:26.680]  thing too is you can get Bob Chapman's newsletter for an entire year for free just by picking up
[02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:32.600]  one frank coin from us right now at 352. Now, the internet prices have already shot up on that.
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:36.920]  And the silver dollars are going up too. I mean, silver has gone up to a peak today.
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:46.120]  We've seen silver hit a high of 31.61. Currently at 31.34. Gold is up $16. Had a high today of
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:51.400]  $649. I just want to be clear. It's two silver dollars, a free video and a free book with free
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:57.080]  shipping $73. Yeah, I'm sorry. Did I give the number wrong? I think you said 88. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:02.520]  73 poor guys and waiting 30 minutes to get on. He only has like a minute knees. Yeah, it's you can
[02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:07.560]  also link through an info wars.com up at the top of the page. There's a link. Get the two silver
[02:58:07.560 --> 02:58:12.440]  dollars at a drop dead good price and then a free great video about the fellow reserve and free book.
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:17.720]  When you call them, they've got a whole list of radio Alex Jones specials on gold silver coins.
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:28.120]  Just ask to hear the list to see what you're interested in. It's 800 686 2237 800 686 2237
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:33.480]  called today and Ted's a great sponsor of this program. But this is where I get my golden silver
[02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:37.560]  is Midas resources. We're going to end the main show. I'll see you back Sunday and on Monday.
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:43.240]  I'm going to come back with a little bit of overdrive right now info wars only. Thank you for
[02:58:43.240 --> 02:58:54.920]  listening to GCN. Visit GCN live.com today. Hi folks, this is Alex Jones. I'm looking for people
[02:58:54.920 --> 02:59:00.760]  that have the wisdom to spot savings opportunity and recognize risk. Saving means to make money.
[02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:05.160]  The cow been pure soap company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[02:59:05.160 --> 02:59:09.640]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:15.160]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[02:59:15.160 --> 02:59:21.000]  perfumes, deodorants or antibacterials. Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:25.800]  that give you rashes, itching sores and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:59:25.800 --> 02:59:28.920]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:32.760]  you have to do something you've never done before. Getting a free catalog is easy
[02:59:32.760 --> 02:59:40.520]  by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five-star soap.com. Take charge of your health
[02:59:40.520 --> 03:00:06.520]  now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at five-star soap.com.
[03:00:10.520 --> 03:00:19.720]  By the way, this is intriguing. It's up at Drudge Report. We're going to get it up at
[03:00:19.720 --> 03:00:27.480]  infowars.com. Steve Jobs tried exotic treatments to combat cancer. Book says he survived eight years
[03:00:28.440 --> 03:00:36.120]  pancreatic cancer. Maybe one out of a hundred thousand does that. It's got about a 98% death rate
[03:00:36.120 --> 03:00:43.560]  within two years and they're saying he was bad to try to beat the cancer with
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:49.560]  non-conventional and he lived longer than basically anybody does. That just shows how they take
[03:00:49.560 --> 03:00:55.080]  information and spin it. That's CNBC. We're going to get that up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[03:00:57.160 --> 03:01:01.880]  People ask me, Alex, why are you still in gold and silver? Gold's gone down 300 bucks,
[03:01:01.880 --> 03:01:09.160]  silver, 15 bucks or whatever because I was buying silver when it was $5 an ounce and I was buying
[03:01:09.160 --> 03:01:14.520]  gold and it was $260 an ounce and I haven't sold gold. I got at that price when it hit 2000 or
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:19.400]  close to it because I understand there's global currency devaluation. I understand the dollar
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:24.520]  may be up one week, but they're only printing more of it. It's going to go down and commodities
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:29.320]  are going to go up, whether it's food, you name it, until they come out with some new thing.
[03:01:29.320 --> 03:01:34.920]  And so that's why I believe when gold and silver dips is the time to buy it.
[03:01:35.480 --> 03:01:40.120]  And what's interesting is in all my years with Midas Resources has been a sponsor for 16 years.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:45.720]  I've been on the Genesis Network, Ted founded for 14 or 15 years now. Wow, time flies.
[03:01:46.760 --> 03:01:52.920]  Since 1998, you do the math. Yeah, 14 years. Let me see, 10, 11, 12, about 13 and a half.
[03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:57.560]  The point is that
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:10.600]  Ted has just done a great job and so has the international forecaster and Bob Chapman.
[03:02:10.600 --> 03:02:15.800]  They also have a deal when you call or you can get a free year, either digital or mail to you,
[03:02:15.800 --> 03:02:22.200]  which is $159 value free. And this is a valuable newsletter when you get a European
[03:02:22.200 --> 03:02:27.560]  Frank coin already at a great price. So just amazing deals on that. There's a bunch of specials.
[03:02:27.560 --> 03:02:33.880]  When you call, ask about them. It's the Alex Jones specials list, 800-686-2237,
[03:02:33.880 --> 03:02:39.160]  800-686-237. Bob Chapman, Ted Anderson, both of you together here in the last few minutes,
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:44.360]  and I appreciate you joining us today, both of you. Where do you expect gold? Has JP Morgan
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:50.040]  changed their perspective? I haven't seen that on $2,500 gold by the end of December,
[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:56.360]  or where does your prognosis stand today? Well, I don't think Morgan's changed anything.
[03:02:57.320 --> 03:03:03.000]  And I still think that they put that projection in because they felt gold was going higher.
[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:09.560]  And what leads me further to believe that is that they've covered a great deal of their
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:16.040]  short position along with HSBC, which means the natural place for them really to be would be long.
[03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:27.080]  Now, we've just seen another correction from 1923-60 down to about 1600. And the reason for that
[03:03:27.640 --> 03:03:33.240]  is that they want to go over and come out of these down because of all the problems that are going
[03:03:33.240 --> 03:03:41.560]  on in Europe and the non-solution. And usually when that happens, gold and silver go up. So
[03:03:41.560 --> 03:03:47.000]  they preempted that by taking them down. Well, they only could do that for so long, cost a lot of
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:53.800]  money. And so the next stage will be for gold and silver to go right back up again. And I think
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:04:01.000]  they'll hit new highs before the year is out, and they may go to gold may go to $2,500 to $3,000,
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:07.080]  and silver may go to $70 or $80. But the point here is just like you pointed out,
[03:04:07.080 --> 03:04:14.520]  it's a great time to buy. So do it. Well, I mean, I got to add in there to Alex. I'm reading the
[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:20.600]  headlines right now. I mean, the German bonds are falling because of the bailouts in Europe,
[03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:25.000]  Greece, the people that are holding on to bonds there, the equivalent to our treasuries are
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:29.560]  saying that they have to take a haircut because of this. They call it an ambitious private sector
