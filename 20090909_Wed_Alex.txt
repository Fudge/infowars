[00:00.000 --> 00:13.640]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.640 --> 00:25.720]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I couldn't believe
[00:25.720 --> 00:32.320]  it last night when I got a call from Reuters demanding that I prove that that open letter
[00:32.320 --> 00:39.360]  to the president written the form of a interview script was written by Charlie Sheen I said
[00:39.360 --> 00:46.800]  why don't you call his publicist well they did and it's in US News and World Report the
[00:46.800 --> 00:55.200]  LA Times the Houston Chronicle and everywhere else basically that yes Charlie Sheen wrote
[00:55.200 --> 01:00.240]  this open letter to the president now we're going to air an ever before heard interview
[01:00.240 --> 01:08.200]  with Charlie today on the show it's roughly 21 minutes long taped it with him in his house
[01:08.200 --> 01:12.760]  a few weeks ago concerning why he wrote the letter to the president why he wrote it in
[01:12.760 --> 01:19.760]  the form of an open letter to the president and then tomorrow and on the same issue but
[01:19.760 --> 01:24.960]  a little bit different a video call to action by Charlie Sheen and when I made that video
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.080]  Monday for YouTube about the big announcement I explained Monday is just the start but so
[01:31.080 --> 01:34.800]  many people went and saw that open letter to the president and thought that was the
[01:34.800 --> 01:39.040]  whole issue and some some thought it was great some thought it wasn't that good a lot of
[01:39.040 --> 01:42.040]  people thought it was really only written but said you should have the disclaimer at
[01:42.040 --> 01:46.920]  the top and you're probably right and I'm going to talk about some of that coming up
[01:46.920 --> 01:53.720]  later in the summer also but I forgot to do this call Kurt Nemo because Aaron works
[01:53.720 --> 01:57.680]  the night shift he's not here and Kurt can explain to people how about two out of eight
[01:57.680 --> 02:01.680]  articles don't post the whole thing and then he has to go repost it I don't know how why
[02:01.680 --> 02:06.880]  word pests writes this why works this way anybody else who knows about it understands
[02:06.880 --> 02:12.640]  it I can barely send an email much less but I've heard about the problems or especially
[02:12.640 --> 02:16.640]  when you have a lot of embedded images it'll like cut things off or won't upload everything
[02:16.640 --> 02:26.120]  or it'll put weird symbols in the text I don't understand it but it cut off the disclaimer
[02:26.120 --> 02:31.160]  for almost an hour people are saying 90 minutes that's not right and I called up Aaron and
[02:31.160 --> 02:39.080]  Paul and I said what in the world I said number one it's an older version of this article
[02:39.080 --> 02:44.600]  and I said number two because in Charlie Britain several versions he kept honing it and so
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.680]  I said and there's none of the hyperlinks in it and then I scroll down I went oh my
[02:50.680 --> 02:54.560]  god he doesn't even have the disclaimer here so yes there were like three different versions
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.960]  they fought to try to upload and each time they were trying to do I don't know how to
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.880]  explain it it's like when we see this is the mistake I made I announced that we'd have
[03:02.880 --> 03:09.400]  something big happening on Tuesday on Friday and Sunday and on Monday at eight o'clock
[03:09.400 --> 03:13.080]  in the morning and I should have not done that because I forget our servers go down
[03:13.080 --> 03:17.200]  and every time something big happens every time Drudge report links to us we go down
[03:17.200 --> 03:23.240]  and this is a lot bigger than that and I got great IT guys it's not their fault that's
[03:23.240 --> 03:27.000]  why Drudge and other big sites are text only when you have photos and videos and stuff
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.880]  it just becomes a whole nother in comments we need to create a really first rate black
[03:32.880 --> 03:36.840]  and white text only site but by first rate has all the new info being posted constantly
[03:36.840 --> 03:41.120]  and links to other sites because we're getting so big well I told you yesterday we went down
[03:41.120 --> 03:44.960]  off and on for an hour from like nine to ten just completely down we couldn't just not
[03:44.960 --> 03:48.200]  get into the servers but thank God they got the disclaimer up before it completely went
[03:48.200 --> 03:54.200]  down and the site info wars was completely down prison planet was up and down and I look
[03:54.200 --> 03:57.680]  I don't have the money to hire extra IT guys these guys are working sometimes ten twelve
[03:57.680 --> 04:03.640]  thirteen fourteen hours a day and I can continually don't complain I try to explain to people
[04:03.640 --> 04:08.960]  you know why people say well why you know why is this article scrambled or why is this
[04:08.960 --> 04:13.960]  this article dead and people think it's a conspiracy theory it's not I've been told we could use
[04:13.960 --> 04:18.560]  something called jumbola or something called Drupal and then we have discussions with
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.120]  other IT people but I look I don't want to spend all day on this as a distraction nine
[04:22.120 --> 04:31.640]  eleven eight year anniversary of the stage terror attacks is coming up and we need to
[04:31.640 --> 04:35.000]  talk about that so I've got a lot of folks coming up on the show today Luke Radowski

[06:15.560 --> 06:17.240]  to tell their story.
[06:17.240 --> 06:26.120]  Whitman, EPA director on the AG made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.

[07:04.880 --> 07:08.880]  he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he was devastated but it taught him a
[07:08.880 --> 07:13.640]  lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells
[07:13.640 --> 07:18.320]  you how much he appreciates you everyday there is no job security you are always in danger
[07:18.320 --> 07:23.240]  of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business
[07:23.240 --> 07:29.520]  since you are the boss nobody can fire you so MZ has been his own boss for over 37 years
[07:29.520 --> 07:34.240]  and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for
[07:34.240 --> 07:39.680]  themselves and not for others MZ wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity
[07:39.680 --> 07:44.040]  involving the marketing of helpful dark chocolate that can help people lose weight and set you
[07:44.040 --> 07:49.920]  up with an impressive compounding monthly income visit chocolate.ownmyself.com and check out

[08:19.560 --> 08:30.240]  Thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen it is 9909 today 666 if you flip it the occultists
[08:30.240 --> 08:36.720]  who are obsessed with numerology no doubt are going to be playing some time of hard
[08:36.720 --> 08:48.000]  good games out there today coming up at high noon or in 52 minutes we're going to air the
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.880]  interview I did with Charlie Sheen a few weeks ago at his home never before heard you've
[08:51.880 --> 08:55.320]  heard the first minute and a half of it but we're going to air the rest of it Charlie's
[08:55.320 --> 09:00.840]  going to be popping in briefly live just to discuss some of the things that are coming
[09:00.840 --> 09:07.440]  up later in the week again is 20 minutes with a president article was meant to get attention
[09:07.440 --> 09:13.480]  to the 20 bullet points are the irrefutable evidence of 911 being an inside job and on
[09:13.480 --> 09:18.600]  top of that to to to to energize a national debate and to make sure that that gets on
[09:18.600 --> 09:25.640]  president Obama's desk and he's now formally asking for an interview with Obama and again
[09:25.640 --> 09:31.040]  I explained to listeners that the beginning was going to be Tuesday with what went up
[09:31.040 --> 09:41.440]  at 8am and it's certainly been successful I will tell you that he's been in contact
[09:41.440 --> 09:45.760]  with and he could have done it this week but he has his TV show that he rehearses for Thursdays
[09:45.760 --> 09:51.400]  and he does Fridays when they shoot two and a half men early next week Charlie's going
[09:51.400 --> 09:59.680]  to be doing national television he is seeking national television and he's getting it and
[09:59.680 --> 10:03.600]  there's some other behind the scenes stuff going on pressure on him and things he just
[10:03.600 --> 10:09.240]  has a lot of courage don't forget what happened to Mark Cuban the White House sent him an
[10:09.240 --> 10:15.080]  email and called him we told you about this year before it was in the news and said we're
[10:15.080 --> 10:19.280]  going to indict you for something made up if you don't shut up and if you don't not
[10:19.280 --> 10:24.800]  make this 9-11 film or not distribute it lose change final cut people didn't believe us
[10:24.800 --> 10:27.920]  when we said Mark Cuban got threatened we weren't going to tell details because he's
[10:27.920 --> 10:35.320]  asked people not to and then after they falsely indicted him and thanks for insider trading
[10:35.320 --> 10:38.560]  I mean imagine the White House and the SEC are calling you and sending you emails saying
[10:38.560 --> 10:43.080]  we're going to get you you 9-11 truth or bastard and Cubans like hey I don't even necessarily
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.960]  really believe this but I believe we need to have an open debate and be able to ask questions
[10:46.960 --> 10:52.640]  in America and he puts out a lot of controversial stuff from different perspectives but he said
[10:52.640 --> 10:56.400]  okay whoa your White House is threatening me okay I won't do it and they said you know
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.920]  what we're still going to come after you so I want people to realize that you're going
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.120]  to find out who's coming tell pro in all of this the alternative media the people that
[11:05.120 --> 11:09.600]  distort and lie and attack us or use any mistakes we make to blow them out of proportion because
[11:09.600 --> 11:15.880]  they don't like this but I'm a big boy I love it I love it I love being attacked I love
[11:15.880 --> 11:25.920]  being in the arena and through all of the stressful stuff though I just want to thank
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.800]  my crew because I know sometimes they don't love all the stress of it Aaron Dykes Paul
[11:30.800 --> 11:41.480]  Watson Steve Watson Tim Fruget back there Paul Hartman Jaren Nyhart Matt some of the
[11:41.480 --> 11:49.360]  other IT guys they just all bust their butts Rob do Jason Bermas Mike back there we have
[11:49.360 --> 11:52.680]  several mics back there in the back but I I need to go ask employees if they ever want
[11:52.680 --> 11:57.720]  their names on here I know a lot of them don't I want to be careful by not giving out last
[11:57.720 --> 12:06.480]  names of folks would rather not have that but you know there's so much more about 20 minutes
[12:06.480 --> 12:09.640]  with the president that you don't know as well there's going to be some things we're
[12:09.640 --> 12:13.960]  going to announce Friday that's what I tried to explain to people and I told people this
[12:13.960 --> 12:21.600]  was going to be big and it is big we're basically running a scyop on the New World Order and
[12:21.600 --> 12:27.600]  I've gotten a lot of phone calls in fact I got to listen to it and I talked to George
[12:27.600 --> 12:30.880]  this morning but I had to get off the phone because it was right before the show and I
[12:30.880 --> 12:38.000]  went when George got up and I talked to George Norring I talked to him and he at first last
[12:38.000 --> 12:43.080]  night wasn't even sure that Charlie Sheen had even written this because he had all these
[12:43.080 --> 12:46.880]  trolls sending him thousands of emails making a big deal out of it but I'll be on his show
[12:46.880 --> 12:55.000]  tonight to discuss it and talk about it but I I I don't want the fact that 20 minutes
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.560]  with the president Charlie Sheen's letter had the disclaimer at the bottom and for an
[13:00.560 --> 13:03.480]  hour or so no disclaimer at all because we were having website problems and it wasn't
[13:03.480 --> 13:08.360]  loading the whole page and we couldn't get access to our servers the remote servers
[13:08.360 --> 13:15.880]  when my IT people explain it to me I don't want to make it about that I don't want to
[13:15.880 --> 13:22.160]  make it we want to make it about the 20 points in the 20 minutes with the president and we
[13:22.160 --> 13:28.000]  want to make it about Charlie going public the big event is him asking President Obama
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.120]  to sit down with him and asking the American people to stand up and other movie stars to
[13:32.120 --> 13:36.080]  stand up and other people to step across that line and say we're not going along with this
[13:36.080 --> 13:44.640]  hoax that's what this is all about this is about a counter strike against the new world
[13:44.640 --> 13:51.040]  order and how do you break through how do you get into the media you do something novel
[13:51.040 --> 13:56.480]  and Gawker magazine and a bunch of others they seem to understand it and they they have
[13:56.480 --> 14:03.480]  some Hollywood term for it where you put it into the context of a fantasy interview
[14:03.480 --> 14:08.760]  so that you can have theater of the mind and have people really interface with it and that
[14:08.760 --> 14:19.560]  was Charlie's intention with it with his idea that was my intention
[14:19.560 --> 14:27.120]  and we need to have 911 truth and we are change and activist groups go to all of the tea parties
[14:27.120 --> 14:33.320]  and the Ron Paul events and to all the public events it's your rights as U.S. citizens and
[14:33.320 --> 14:38.800]  the democratic events all events and peacefully hand out terror storms and in games and truth
[14:38.800 --> 14:43.680]  risings and loose change final edition free to make copies and 20 minutes with the president
[14:43.680 --> 14:51.880]  and go to these town halls and say 6 of the 10 911 Commission members 6 of the 10 911
[14:51.880 --> 14:57.520]  Commission members say it's a fraud and a lie Charlie wrote this letter to get that
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.920]  out there and he's made this video that we air tomorrow and he's done all of this and
[15:03.920 --> 15:09.640]  the taped interviews and the live interviews he's doing in an attempt to get a national
[15:09.640 --> 15:14.840]  debate going about these issues he's literally throwing himself in front of the bus to do
[15:14.840 --> 15:21.960]  this this isn't fun for him he was very even though it's his idea and he wanted my help
[15:21.960 --> 15:26.240]  doing it he was very very nervous and so was I pulling the trigger on this because these
[15:26.240 --> 15:32.080]  are very serious people that carried out 911 ladies and gentlemen this isn't a game and
[15:32.080 --> 15:35.720]  you live you learn with this I had it over to do I would have launched it with no announcement
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.400]  so a lot of times a lot of you that are big readers of info wars and present planets see
[15:39.400 --> 15:44.280]  the bugs see the problem see the stories cut in half and for anybody that's worked with
[15:44.280 --> 15:47.720]  wordpress or remote servers when you have big sites you pretty much have to do that
[15:47.720 --> 15:50.920]  we're trying to get fiber optics in right now to put our own servers in here we can't
[15:50.920 --> 15:54.800]  get the bandwidth out of here to put servers in here right now we have some in-house little
[15:54.800 --> 15:59.520]  servers for email and stuff but that's it so we're fighting to try to upgrade things
[15:59.520 --> 16:08.960]  and in that I'm sorry and we did screw up and I apologized everybody if you know that
[16:08.960 --> 16:12.560]  you emailed it out for that first hour so no more than our people are saying 90 minutes
[16:12.560 --> 16:16.280]  that's incorrect it was like eight o'clock when it went up and I was looking and we noticed
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.680]  it 20 30 minutes in the time I didn't realize what a serious issue it was and I called up
[16:20.680 --> 16:25.560]  saying hey fix it upload it and both the web guys are like we're trying and we keep telling
[16:25.560 --> 16:30.160]  you that a third of the time we can't get in the servers tell the IT guys and I'm like
[16:30.160 --> 16:36.560]  oh okay okay okay and that's why a lot of times you see Kurtz stories he doesn't put
[16:36.560 --> 16:40.720]  articles or photos or things up in it because that tends to look I don't know maybe we don't
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.800]  have wordpress set right maybe some guru can tell us it's better info wars and present
[16:45.800 --> 16:49.440]  planet are better than they were two years ago if we went to wordpress again I don't
[16:49.440 --> 16:53.400]  want to obsess over this all day it's just a constant hassle I mean you've been seeing
[16:53.400 --> 16:56.640]  how much the sides have been going down the last month because we're getting millions
[16:56.640 --> 17:02.040]  of visitors a week we had millions yesterday on a day we had to shut comments off because
[17:02.040 --> 17:05.560]  that was the biggest thing taken man with I want to bring Paul Watson up because I'm
[17:05.560 --> 17:08.760]  not an IT guy neither is he knows more than I do about this and then curtain the next
[17:08.760 --> 17:12.640]  segment that I'm shifting gears and the Charlie sheen interview Charlie sheen also popping
[17:12.640 --> 17:19.520]  in live just for a few minutes to promo what's coming up later in the show but Watson just
[17:19.520 --> 17:27.120]  in a nutshell explain to me what's going on how these servers work well the thing about
[17:27.120 --> 17:35.880]  it is that I mean we were working intensively on this article Sunday of Monday and it first
[17:35.880 --> 17:38.520]  it didn't have the hyperlinks that's what I first noticed and I said why aren't they
[17:38.520 --> 17:44.640]  there what caused that things I mean things are added taken out links were added taken
[17:44.640 --> 17:50.720]  out I mean I didn't even get the file version until literally two hours before it was going
[17:50.720 --> 17:57.200]  to be posted so I was adding different things check in the grammar check in but what I'm
[17:57.200 --> 18:01.760]  told is that's what wordpress does is we stuck that image of a signature at the bottom so
[18:01.760 --> 18:06.040]  often it then cuts off whatever's below that which was the blurb about the audio of sheen
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.040]  that day and the link to your other article yeah there were things that were supposed
[18:11.040 --> 18:16.200]  to be added at the bottom that then got pasted over by all this different stuff we were adding
[18:16.200 --> 18:23.040]  and then we were literally struggling for about an hour to get it back in there I mean I was
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.680]  freaking out calling you Alex when you were in the shower during that half an hour to
[18:28.680 --> 18:37.400]  an hour I remember we finally managed to get it back up about I don't want to start a conspiracy
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.000]  but how often does that happen where it chops off Kurt says it happens a lot to him I know
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.560]  you don't complain as much how often does that happen the issues with wordpress and you see
[18:48.560 --> 18:55.240]  with wordpress you've got two ways in which you can input content one is HTML view which
[18:55.240 --> 19:01.200]  is time consuming but if you do it then it comes out right the other one is visual view
[19:01.200 --> 19:06.640]  but when you paste it in different things from for example a word document or images
[19:06.640 --> 19:12.800]  or video it can completely mess up everything that's underneath that well yeah and when I
[19:12.800 --> 19:17.400]  said Kurt complains he just is frustrated he's in New Mexico and he says about a third
[19:17.400 --> 19:21.920]  of the time he can't get into the server and and and then I guess we had such load hitting
[19:21.920 --> 19:26.480]  at eight o'clock that right before sites go down which it then did both went down off
[19:26.480 --> 19:33.640]  and on you couldn't get in no I mean info was completely offline prisonplanet.tv was
[19:33.640 --> 19:38.040]  completely offline people couldn't even listen to the show yeah I mean the sites crashed
[19:38.040 --> 19:43.600]  folks and and and so they were in there that's the problem is when they went to upload it
[19:43.600 --> 19:48.280]  everybody hit the site and I don't begin to understand all this but that's what scramble
[19:48.280 --> 19:52.720]  stuff stay there Paul I got Kurt popping in with his experiences with this and then I'm
[19:52.720 --> 19:56.000]  going to shift gears and all the other news but I wanted to explain this to people okay
[19:56.000 --> 20:02.920]  we did not not have the disclaimer on purpose hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the

[22:02.960 --> 22:07.780]  the federal reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic
[22:07.780 --> 22:11.960]  events it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount
[22:11.960 --> 22:16.800]  of cash depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small
[22:16.800 --> 22:20.760]  portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending

[22:30.000 --> 22:34.880]  central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without
[22:34.880 --> 22:39.320]  equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and

[24:00.280 --> 24:04.240]  it's great to be here with you i appreciate you doing this interview likewise alex thank
[24:04.240 --> 24:09.880]  you why after three years of silence concerning nine eleven are you now speaking up and why
[24:09.880 --> 24:18.480]  have you written this public letter you've now published well alex i wrote this letter
[24:18.480 --> 24:25.960]  for for two reasons firstly i i i wanted to create a public document specifically rooted
[24:25.960 --> 24:32.920]  in fact if anybody dares question that i i i would encourage those people to to to to
[24:32.920 --> 24:40.440]  scrutinize it to research it that the truth is on changing alex as we both know the only
[24:40.440 --> 24:46.560]  aspects of this piece that had to be manufactured with a president's right folks i'm gonna give
[24:46.560 --> 24:50.360]  a shout out charlie sheen listening right now from his home in los angeles charlie is coming
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.760]  up live in the next segment then we're gonna play the tape interview i did with him in
[24:54.760 --> 24:59.520]  his home a few weeks ago and then he's coming back up live friday and there's a special
[24:59.520 --> 25:03.240]  video he taped this is only the beginning of this but he's gonna come on and tell you
[25:03.240 --> 25:08.320]  why he wrote the letter the way he did since for some that want to distract off the main
[25:08.320 --> 25:13.480]  issue of nine eleven truth it's they've turned it into somewhat of an issue regardless ladies
[25:13.480 --> 25:16.320]  and gentlemen government sponsored terror is real and is happening but i wanted to go
[25:16.320 --> 25:24.200]  back to paul watson briefly and curtain ammo curtain ammo i know you were irritated yesterday
[25:24.200 --> 25:28.440]  how often from new mexico do your stories get cut off when you're uploading them and
[25:28.440 --> 25:34.040]  how often can you not get into the server well there's occasionally a glitches when
[25:34.040 --> 25:40.000]  i post my stories but really it's it's pretty minimal um the servers are pretty good shape
[25:40.000 --> 25:43.800]  compared to the way they were when we first started out nobody's griping at the it guys
[25:43.800 --> 25:48.400]  it's no body right tell the truth card i am telling the truth he's trying to be well
[25:48.400 --> 25:52.200]  no i mean constantly you're saying you can't get into the server it's going down i mean
[25:52.200 --> 25:55.880]  by constantly a few times a week's what you told me at least well sometimes the back end
[25:55.880 --> 26:00.680]  where we actually put the content into the server has problems but i wouldn't say that
[26:00.680 --> 26:06.840]  it's a a large issue okay wasn't an issue yesterday oh definitely was the issue yesterday
[26:06.840 --> 26:10.160]  but that was because the server was getting hit with the member quest i think i couldn't
[26:10.160 --> 26:14.920]  get in sure well we have a great crew everybody's so nice to each other it is not the it guys
[26:14.920 --> 26:20.440]  issue it's the bandwidth issue and that i demand a dynamic site with comments and photos
[26:20.440 --> 26:24.080]  and images and we've had a bunch of other companies before that couldn't do it my it
[26:24.080 --> 26:28.560]  you guys are the best so i want to get sidetracked we're trying to but the issue was yesterday
[26:28.560 --> 26:32.640]  was the site not getting such massive traffic that you couldn't upload articles and how
[26:32.640 --> 26:36.880]  many hours did it take you to even upload the charlie shane photo um it took a couple
[26:36.880 --> 26:42.880]  hours on and off uh i i would get a connection and get in there and then i would get chopped
[26:42.880 --> 26:46.840]  off but i think that's because the server is getting flooded with requests i just wanted
[26:46.840 --> 26:51.000]  to on record and that's how murphy's law though works you got some huge letter that has a
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.200]  disclaimer at the bottom and then some other links those weren't there either the about
[26:54.200 --> 26:59.120]  him being on the show and the clip and uh about the other article paul wrote like four
[26:59.120 --> 27:03.320]  things were cut off the bottom not just the disclaimer and if we're wrong anywhere maybe
[27:03.320 --> 27:06.400]  it should have been at the front but charlie has his reasons for that i think he might
[27:06.400 --> 27:09.160]  be right so we're gonna have him on in a minute talk about it but that isn't what this is
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.520]  about but that's what the scyop people want to make it about and some people are taking
[27:13.520 --> 27:18.360]  the bait unfortunately is about how this was presented it's presented to get people talking
[27:18.360 --> 27:24.480]  about it but not not in in this intense away uh but but bottom line so we started getting
[27:24.480 --> 27:29.120]  massive traffic right today when it was uploaded that cut off some stuff because the image in
[27:29.120 --> 27:33.040]  between it is the way it's described anything else kurt well i just wanted to comment on
[27:33.040 --> 27:37.600]  what paul said it's true with the editor on the back end i'm not sure if this is really
[27:37.600 --> 27:41.600]  important to the listeners per se but if you use the visual editor and you try to stick
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.000]  content in sometimes there's problems i usually use the html editor because there's less problems
[27:47.000 --> 27:52.080]  with that well it started with watson uploading it without the bottom part then instantly trying
[27:52.080 --> 27:54.720]  to get in but by then it was eight o'clock in the morning and everybody was hitting
[27:54.720 --> 28:01.560]  it so it was just a perfect storm this is this is taught me do not launch major surprise
[28:01.560 --> 28:07.480]  guest with pre-announcements i've always instinctively not done that i just have kind of hey here's
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.760]  the surprise because i almost learned with bandwidth we can't handle it and then my story
[28:12.760 --> 28:17.080]  doesn't even get out so we've certainly learned a big lesson here but regardless we need to
[28:17.080 --> 28:20.960]  make the full focus about the eighth anniversary the firemen the police that aren't getting
[28:20.960 --> 28:24.880]  medical care the fact that the cover-up on that's been exposed that civil evans has come
[28:24.880 --> 28:29.240]  out saying ben laden and al-qaeda worked for the u.s. government till nine eleven those
[28:29.240 --> 28:35.240]  are the big issues we can't get diverted off of here paul watson any comments yeah i mean
[28:35.240 --> 28:40.800]  that what we need to judge is the impact that it had i mean you might argue that the disclaimer
[28:40.800 --> 28:45.720]  should have been at the top but in my view that would have reduced the impact by about
[28:45.720 --> 28:52.960]  fifty percent and now we're seeing that impact la times houston chronicle u.s. news and world
[28:52.960 --> 28:59.080]  report and in fact my article coming out in about ten minutes on prison planet is about
[28:59.080 --> 29:07.240]  how this u.s. news and world report author uses what i call cliched and completely unfounded
[29:07.240 --> 29:13.160]  terms of reference because in attempting to smear charlie sheen as part of this conspiracy
[29:13.160 --> 29:18.920]  print fringe in his words he says that nine eleven truth is alike the people who believe
[29:18.920 --> 29:25.080]  that the uh... jfk vaccination was not the work of the army of the world alone that's
[29:25.080 --> 29:31.280]  ninety percent of americans at least that's the majority of the population absolutely
[29:31.280 --> 29:36.880]  paul is there any chance somebody hacked in and blocked you from uploading that it's possible
[29:36.880 --> 29:41.720]  we had a lot of students but i think it was traffic probably i mean i don't want to blame
[29:41.720 --> 29:45.840]  it on hackers though we haven't been hacked before official all right gentlemen good job
[29:45.840 --> 29:53.160]  keep it up get all the news up there on charlie sheen his courage we're on the march the empires

[33:34.200 --> 33:40.440]  that and professor steven jones to counter the disinformation piece using the language
[33:40.440 --> 33:45.880]  of film and other propaganda tactics they used that's the same film company that produces
[33:45.880 --> 33:50.880]  most of the big jfk disinfo pieces creative differences we're gonna be debunking that
[33:50.880 --> 33:55.880]  in the last two hours today but without further ado charlie sheen good to have you on my
[33:55.880 --> 34:02.120]  friend hey great to be here alex how are you oh it's just i'm really excited this is hitting
[34:02.120 --> 34:06.840]  bigger than it did in two thousand and six it's in dozens and dozens and dozens of newspapers
[34:06.840 --> 34:13.440]  and going super viral and most of them are positive this time yeah no i'm i'm i'm i'm
[34:13.440 --> 34:17.800]  completely excited by uh... by just what what what little i've i've had a chance to
[34:17.800 --> 34:23.120]  uh... check out online and what you know some of my friends and family have sent me
[34:23.120 --> 34:27.880]  uh... no this is exciting this is important this is uh...
[34:27.880 --> 34:31.120]  this is the type of reaction i was hoping for uh...
[34:31.120 --> 34:34.120]  i think we should cover something that uh...
[34:34.120 --> 34:36.560]  some of the articles i've read and some of the
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.320]  some of the blog some of the comments have i have criticized you and i for it
[34:41.320 --> 34:43.520]  intentionally uh...
[34:43.520 --> 34:47.840]  uh... it that that the thing dealing with the disclaimer uh... what people are
[34:47.840 --> 34:52.800]  are insisting that we left it off uh... originally and that is not the case this was
[34:52.800 --> 34:54.680]  always intended to be
[34:54.680 --> 34:56.800]  repealed at the end
[34:56.800 --> 34:59.120]  as a fictional piece uh...
[34:59.120 --> 35:01.000]  and and i think people felt
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.840]  it's led when in fact it was an i-t glitch
[35:04.840 --> 35:06.880]  that's what that's all murphy's long
[35:06.880 --> 35:08.840]  exactly
[35:08.840 --> 35:09.600]  uh...
[35:09.600 --> 35:13.280]  but i had you know it's like you know i had talked about we had struggled with
[35:13.280 --> 35:16.920]  putting this thing at the beginning uh... or at the bottom but i felt if it
[35:16.920 --> 35:18.240]  was at the bottom
[35:18.240 --> 35:20.080]  uh...
[35:20.080 --> 35:22.200]  uh... if anybody uh...
[35:22.200 --> 35:23.680]  if it was at the top
[35:23.680 --> 35:25.240]  right uh...
[35:25.240 --> 35:29.120]  i was afraid people would tune out or just dismissed it as a fluffy so i wanted
[35:29.120 --> 35:30.440]  to
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.480]  i wanted to get people interested to get them engaged in the interview in the
[35:34.480 --> 35:36.920]  piece and and and
[35:36.920 --> 35:39.120]  understand that it was uh...
[35:39.120 --> 35:41.600]  that it was a work of fiction however
[35:41.600 --> 35:43.840]  the intent of the piece
[35:43.840 --> 35:45.680]  was to generate enough
[35:45.680 --> 35:48.600]  interest enough excitement enough momentum
[35:48.600 --> 35:51.480]  to have this actually come across
[35:51.480 --> 35:53.120]  the president's desk
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.040]  and and and my my my fantasy scenario
[35:57.040 --> 35:58.320]  would be to
[35:58.320 --> 35:59.560]  be granted
[35:59.560 --> 36:01.200]  by twenty minutes
[36:01.200 --> 36:02.200]  by president
[36:02.200 --> 36:06.280]  that's the big announcement in your own words you want to meet with the rock
[36:06.280 --> 36:10.080]  obama and you went further in some things are coming up really soon
[36:10.080 --> 36:12.920]  that you want other people to go to the
[36:12.920 --> 36:15.100]  their congressman their senators
[36:15.100 --> 36:19.440]  and the six of the ten commissioners i mean explain that to people charlie
[36:19.440 --> 36:22.640]  well yeah because you know some of the other stuff that i've been reading
[36:22.640 --> 36:24.560]  that this came out is that
[36:24.560 --> 36:26.880]  you know charlie sheen thinks that sir
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.120]  charlie sheen is insisting that and and
[36:31.120 --> 36:34.360]  it's a typical mainstream spin
[36:34.360 --> 36:39.000]  on on on what the intent of the piece really is it's
[36:39.000 --> 36:40.040]  it's a it's a
[36:40.040 --> 36:46.480]  it's a compilation of the formulation of of of a of a of a host of of of really
[36:46.480 --> 36:50.720]  hard
[36:50.720 --> 36:52.320]  that is not
[36:52.320 --> 36:53.840]  my opinion
[36:53.840 --> 36:56.320]  they're not things that that that i have
[36:56.320 --> 36:58.120]  come up with on my own
[36:58.120 --> 37:03.200]  these are the observations and and and the realities
[37:03.200 --> 37:04.800]  put forth by people
[37:04.800 --> 37:07.000]  a thousand times smarter than me
[37:07.000 --> 37:10.560]  people that do this for a living you know so
[37:10.560 --> 37:15.440]  i thought it was important to to to put it all into one document where
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.800]  uh... even the naysayers would look at it and
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.840]  it's just typical when when they can't attack the facts they attack the person
[37:22.840 --> 37:23.800]  you know that's
[37:23.800 --> 37:27.000]  that's what they're engaged in it it's what i expect that it's fine it's what
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.240]  they do what uh...
[37:29.240 --> 37:30.600]  but yeah i think when
[37:30.600 --> 37:33.440]  if if if you can divorce yourself from
[37:33.440 --> 37:35.600]  who wrote this why it was written
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.000]  uh... and and and just look at those facts and uh...
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.840]  i think it really it it it
[37:41.840 --> 37:45.200]  really begs to be explored deeper
[37:45.200 --> 37:49.760]  well may this was designed to make the neocons grab a hold of it i mean we want
[37:49.760 --> 37:54.120]  them to go look at the twenty points i mean look at these points charlie uh...
[37:54.120 --> 37:56.600]  i know you think the strongest i agree with you
[37:56.600 --> 37:58.320]  uh... is
[37:58.320 --> 38:02.360]  the what the members of the commission said in two of the five counsel i mean
[38:02.360 --> 38:05.680]  in your words i give us a comment on that
[38:05.680 --> 38:07.440]  well i think it's um...
[38:07.440 --> 38:10.040]  if you would anybody brings up the uh...
[38:10.040 --> 38:12.680]  the writers piece that came out last night
[38:12.680 --> 38:15.760]  uh... i think they mentioned
[38:15.760 --> 38:17.560]  the uh...
[38:17.560 --> 38:20.560]  that the commission member aspect of the piece
[38:20.560 --> 38:23.240]  uh... no less than five times
[38:23.240 --> 38:27.280]  so i think even they thought that the true value of that
[38:27.280 --> 38:32.880]  uh... and and and the true damning implication of that and
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.760]  and so they're uh... they were very smart to to to jump on that as a as a
[38:37.760 --> 38:40.160]  as a key aspect of the uh...
[38:40.160 --> 38:43.040]  of the document you know and uh...
[38:43.040 --> 38:44.840]  i'm i'm hoping
[38:44.840 --> 38:49.520]  as this bill momentum as it as it picks up steam as it garners more attention
[38:49.520 --> 38:50.840]  that uh...
[38:50.840 --> 38:52.240]  that this will force
[38:52.240 --> 38:53.520]  some of these
[38:53.520 --> 38:55.440]  commissioners if not all of them
[38:55.440 --> 38:57.680]  uh... out into the open to
[38:57.680 --> 39:00.520]  to to comment on that so we're not uh...
[39:00.520 --> 39:03.720]  so we're not misleading people misquoting them
[39:03.720 --> 39:05.920]  misguiding anybody uh...
[39:05.920 --> 39:10.440]  in any capacity well all i mean the quotes you got rather washington post
[39:10.440 --> 39:13.400]  the quotes you got all the commission members were out of mainstream news and
[39:13.400 --> 39:14.760]  we have a bibliography
[39:14.760 --> 39:18.560]  with the links directly to their quotes i mean exactly this is not a
[39:18.560 --> 39:23.280]  conspiracy theory that that six of the ten commissioners said it was a fraud
[39:23.280 --> 39:27.120]  a cover-up that they wanted a criminal investigation of the pentagon covering
[39:27.120 --> 39:28.640]  things up i mean i mean that
[39:28.640 --> 39:31.200]  how can this be hidden in plain view
[39:31.200 --> 39:35.920]  uh... well it's just the way things work today and i uh...
[39:35.920 --> 39:39.600]  you know uh... hopefully with uh...
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.920]  you know uh... having written this and and and uh... with what we're doing
[39:43.920 --> 39:46.040]  hopefully we can uh...
[39:46.040 --> 39:49.240]  we can pull back the curtain on some of this stuff
[39:49.240 --> 39:52.480]  and just to be clear but go ahead i'm sorry uh...
[39:52.480 --> 39:57.400]  but this is just me asking questions this is not me having solved everything
[39:57.400 --> 39:59.040]  or having an idea of
[39:59.040 --> 40:00.600]  what went down or how it
[40:00.600 --> 40:03.240]  how it went down or how it didn't go down this is just
[40:03.240 --> 40:05.640]  a guy with questions a guy who voted
[40:05.640 --> 40:07.720]  for a president a guy who's
[40:07.720 --> 40:09.080]  tax dollars
[40:09.080 --> 40:14.880]  support wars that that that that i don't support personally emotionally
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.600]  and and and so i feel like i i have a right
[40:18.600 --> 40:20.040]  to to to
[40:20.040 --> 40:24.200]  request this time to ask these questions the good news for obama
[40:24.200 --> 40:26.360]  it's already got my questions
[40:26.360 --> 40:28.360]  it already got the document
[40:28.360 --> 40:31.360]  but no surprises
[40:31.360 --> 40:35.040]  absolutely uh... i want to play a clip and we're gonna come back and and and
[40:35.040 --> 40:38.440]  and get one more comment from you and then court will will cover more
[40:38.440 --> 40:41.480]  coming up on friday and i really appreciate your time and your courage

[40:44.680 --> 40:45.960]  plus minute interview

[40:56.720 --> 40:59.480]  appreciate you and in the center you likewise alex thank you
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.560]  why after three years of silence concerning nine eleven
[41:02.560 --> 41:07.160]  uh... are you now speaking up and why have you written this public letter
[41:07.160 --> 41:08.080]  you've now
[41:08.080 --> 41:09.960]  uh... published
[41:09.960 --> 41:10.520]  well
[41:10.520 --> 41:12.560]  alex uh...
[41:12.560 --> 41:17.960]  i wrote this letter for for two reasons uh... firstly i i i wanted to create
[41:17.960 --> 41:22.080]  a public document specifically rooted in fact uh...
[41:22.080 --> 41:23.120]  if anybody dares
[41:23.120 --> 41:27.320]  question that i i i i would encourage those people to to
[41:27.320 --> 41:31.200]  to to scrutinize it to research it
[41:31.200 --> 41:34.960]  the truth is on changing alex as we don't know uh...
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.840]  the only aspect of this piece that that that had to be manufactured with the
[41:38.840 --> 41:40.320]  president's words
[41:40.320 --> 41:41.840]  everything else will
[41:41.840 --> 41:43.200]  withstand
[41:43.200 --> 41:46.760]  the critical assault on my more than prepared to endure
[41:46.760 --> 41:48.240]  and secondly uh...
[41:48.240 --> 41:52.240]  this is our first new president since nine eleven and they consequently his
[41:52.240 --> 41:54.200]  first nine eleven anniversary
[41:54.200 --> 41:56.880]  in office uh...
[41:56.880 --> 42:03.320]  enough stonewalling enough media manipulation of media mantra speak
[42:03.320 --> 42:08.800]  the families deserve better alex america deserves better i mean come on
[42:08.800 --> 42:12.160]  come on people the nine eleven commission report is a blatant work of
[42:12.160 --> 42:15.560]  manipulation secrecy and fiction
[42:15.560 --> 42:19.520]  come on the time is now demand that the truth
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.760]  i personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like it
[42:23.760 --> 42:27.160]  uh... of the new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right
[42:27.160 --> 42:28.520]  into our congress
[42:28.520 --> 42:30.040]  we have to take action
[42:30.040 --> 42:33.560]  we have to stand as one we must insist that our new president deliver on his
[42:33.560 --> 42:36.160]  promises
[42:36.160 --> 42:39.120]  charlie sheen we're gonna go over your twenty minutes of the president the
[42:39.120 --> 42:44.080]  actual twenty points uh... coming up on an extended live interview friday but
[42:44.080 --> 42:47.520]  and i know you've got to get to work but anything else you'd like to add
[42:47.520 --> 42:50.800]  yeah i think it's important that uh... that people
[42:50.800 --> 42:53.080]  uh... that i did write this
[42:53.080 --> 42:54.920]  that this is charlie sheen
[42:54.920 --> 42:58.560]  that these are my words that this is my document that there's no question about
[42:58.560 --> 43:00.960]  that because i understand that with uh...
[43:00.960 --> 43:03.920]  some confusion or some or or some doubting
[43:03.920 --> 43:06.880]  about i had news media calling me saying prove this is charlie sheen
[43:06.880 --> 43:10.480]  yesterday but go ahead you can play this park
[43:10.480 --> 43:11.240]  if they
[43:11.240 --> 43:14.280]  do in fact continue to make that call uh...
[43:14.280 --> 43:15.960]  but yeah it down
[43:15.960 --> 43:20.640]  i i i i guess i should take that is uh... some measure of of flattery
[43:20.640 --> 43:23.880]  that they didn't think i was capable of writing this uh... but now i did write
[43:23.880 --> 43:25.720]  it and uh...
[43:25.720 --> 43:28.720]  and it's it's it's it's from my heart
[43:28.720 --> 43:32.560]  it's it's for the families it's for
[43:32.560 --> 43:36.880]  it's for all of america the rest of the free world and i just think that uh...
[43:36.880 --> 43:39.880]  you know with our first president our first new president
[43:39.880 --> 43:42.360]  since the event that uh...
[43:42.360 --> 43:46.720]  that was a perfect opportunity with his first anniversary coming up
[43:46.720 --> 43:47.920]  that uh...
[43:47.920 --> 43:49.960]  that he'd be asked
[43:49.960 --> 43:52.360]  if not forced at some point
[43:52.360 --> 43:53.320]  to uh...
[43:53.320 --> 43:55.360]  to take a look at this
[43:55.360 --> 43:58.600]  at these hard facts all this evidence
[43:58.600 --> 44:02.160]  but the ball in his court
[44:02.160 --> 44:06.240]  in closing if the president doesn't meet with you or doesn't answer these
[44:06.240 --> 44:09.400]  questions about six of the ten members the commission saying the commission was
[44:09.400 --> 44:12.400]  a fraud and a lie
[44:12.400 --> 44:16.080]  what are you calling for

[49:07.040 --> 49:08.840]  seem to find one here's gawker
[49:08.840 --> 49:11.960]  one of the big uh...
[49:11.960 --> 49:13.320]  gossip sites

[49:39.280 --> 49:42.000]  or my houston chronicles but that's another one
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.960]  so just too many of these they're walking in and stacking these on my desk as
[49:45.960 --> 49:47.880]  fast as they can print them
[49:47.880 --> 49:49.000]  and
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.600]  good job charlie he wanted to put this front center knowing he'd be attacked
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.200]  people out there that enjoy attacking him like u.s. news and world report
[49:56.200 --> 49:59.320]  and like no doubt bill o'reilly and shon hannity will do
[49:59.320 --> 50:02.040]  that's the whole plan
[50:02.040 --> 50:04.360]  you know people attacking me in
[50:04.360 --> 50:05.480]  you know glad it
[50:05.480 --> 50:07.840]  glitches or anything we've had

[50:12.280 --> 50:15.360]  to be up on the pedestal and everybody throwing eggs at you
[50:15.360 --> 50:16.720]  but that's what
[50:16.720 --> 50:19.480]  people like that do what it uh...
[50:19.480 --> 50:21.200]  the roosevelt say
[50:21.200 --> 50:24.560]  it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man
[50:24.560 --> 50:26.840]  stumbles or where the doer of deeds
[50:26.840 --> 50:29.640]  could have done them better the credit belongs the man who is actually in the
[50:29.640 --> 50:33.000]  arena whose faces marred by dust and sweat and blood
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.080]  who strives valiantly
[50:36.080 --> 50:39.240]  errors and comes up short again and again
[50:39.240 --> 50:40.240]  because there
[50:40.240 --> 50:42.080]  is no
[50:42.080 --> 50:43.480]  effort without error
[50:43.480 --> 50:44.760]  and shortcomings
[50:44.760 --> 50:46.720]  but who does actually strive
[50:46.720 --> 50:48.360]  to do the deed
[50:48.360 --> 50:50.720]  i'm gonna finish this quote when we come back

[54:25.400 --> 54:32.080]  again because there is not effort without error and shortcomings but who

[54:45.160 --> 54:48.520]  while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and
[54:48.520 --> 54:52.800]  timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat and you know that describes
[54:52.800 --> 54:57.480]  charlie sheen a doer of deeds and i know him very well he's a very very
[54:57.480 --> 55:01.840]  special person and i know a lot of big celebrities folks who are even bigger
[55:01.840 --> 55:05.240]  than charlie and they are scared to go public with what they know and they
[55:05.240 --> 55:09.000]  won't do it and there's not many people bigger than charlie sheen so that gives
[55:09.000 --> 55:12.600]  you an idea of who these people are i think about luke radowski of we are
[55:12.600 --> 55:16.120]  changed kicked out of 911 truth of new york shut down when started his own
[55:16.120 --> 55:21.160]  groups ruined hundreds around the world has police come up arresting people come
[55:21.160 --> 55:26.640]  out of dark alleyways with people on wheelchairs running into we are changed
[55:26.640 --> 55:30.000]  they have to then expose it's a fraud go to court and prove it luke's been
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.080]  arrested for going to public press conferences he said police come up and
[55:33.080 --> 55:36.000]  say we're going to say you have bombs and guns and put you in prison we know
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.040]  you're innocent but we don't care on video this is the hell we go through mark
[55:40.040 --> 55:44.560]  cuban with them trying to indict him in guiding him and then the email saying
[55:44.560 --> 55:49.120]  we're going to get you for 911 truth this is real so take charlie's call and
[55:49.120 --> 55:53.120]  get out there and expand 911 truth because it is hurting the establishment
[55:53.120 --> 55:56.880]  that's why they're trying to counter us luke radowski i want to talk about some
[55:56.880 --> 56:00.360]  of the 911 events coming up in new york this year i couldn't be there because i
[56:00.360 --> 56:03.600]  was launching this but i couldn't tell you what we were gonna launch but we're
[56:03.600 --> 56:06.800]  gonna talk about that in a moment first off what do you think of this whole
[56:06.800 --> 56:11.840]  charlie sheen thing how exciting is that i mean it's exciting he's re-riggering
[56:11.840 --> 56:15.480]  this whole not 11 truth movement and it's letting people know he's pretty
[56:15.480 --> 56:19.440]  much reversing the course of history and changing the tide that we're all going
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.040]  against right now and it's incredible knowing that big-name celebrities like
[56:23.040 --> 56:26.280]  charlie sheen are putting everything on the line because they believe in
[56:26.280 --> 56:30.480]  something bigger than anything and it's amazing seeing people come out of
[56:30.480 --> 56:34.400]  everywhere to support this message of truth
[56:34.400 --> 56:37.840]  absolutely well he wanted to do it because he's sick of seeing the 911
[56:37.840 --> 56:40.880]  families being used by the government saying all the 911 families want a
[56:40.880 --> 56:44.400]  police state they want wars when the head of the biggest group
[56:44.400 --> 56:47.520]  mr dole on this show three years ago said the majority of them think it's an
[56:47.520 --> 56:50.800]  inside job and they protested around the white house and i've talked to the
[56:50.800 --> 56:55.040]  families and the survivors and the majority of them say inside job and
[56:55.040 --> 56:58.240]  then the media will will never cover it just like they won't cover that six of
[56:58.240 --> 57:03.360]  the 10 commission members said it was a criminal fraud
[57:03.360 --> 57:06.560]  and exactly and the majority of the victims family members especially the
[57:06.560 --> 57:09.760]  ones that work with we are changed and are part of we are changed they are
[57:09.760 --> 57:14.800]  just sick of their loved ones being used to prophesize an agenda of war and
[57:14.800 --> 57:18.880]  slavery and intolerance and ignorance and we're taking that name back
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.160]  we're going to be doing that just like we do every year on 911 with the victims
[57:22.160 --> 57:26.000]  with the rescue workers with the survivors with police and military in
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  the streets in new york city every year we take the name back for what it really
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.040]  is that we take justice in our own hands and we do what should have been done
[57:35.040 --> 57:38.800]  years ago and helping out those people who are lied to about the air quality
[57:38.800 --> 57:42.720]  down at ground zero absolutely well the big news
[57:42.720 --> 57:46.080]  luke is not just his letter or charlie coming on the show
[57:46.080 --> 57:50.160]  we're going to be airing a never before interview with him next hour
[57:50.160 --> 57:53.760]  the big news is that he is calling for a declaration
[57:53.760 --> 57:58.000]  of truth against the lie of 911 and a call to arms in the info ward did you
[57:58.000 --> 58:02.080]  hear that i did not hear that but that's incredible news and i'm really
[58:02.080 --> 58:05.840]  very excited to hear that luke start telling us we're going to

[1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:26.720]  okay it'll take two segments to play this interview i take this
[1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:30.800]  charlie sheen's home a few weeks ago about a week and a half ago when i was
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:33.760]  last there we taped a video but we've edited a special
[1:08:33.760 --> 1:08:36.400]  presentation that's going to be airing
[1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:39.920]  thursday i was talking to charlie though and he he thought well i thought
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:43.040]  that's gonna air friday so we might air it friday i don't know he'll be back live
[1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:48.160]  for 30 minutes maybe longer uh he wanted to just come on a few minutes
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:51.040]  today and i could tell he was ready to keep going he's just a great guy
[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:54.560]  but we're gonna have a focused interview and a whole bunch of issues
[1:08:54.560 --> 1:09:00.960]  friday live on air and uh
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:04.560]  again i can't believe i have to even say this but this this is really charlie
[1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:07.440]  sheen yes all these news articles in the la times and
[1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:10.400]  fox news is now picked it up and roiders everywhere else
[1:09:10.400 --> 1:09:13.920]  yes charlie sheen really wants to meet with the president
[1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:18.000]  and the 20 minutes of the president article he wrote is a vehicle
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.680]  to show people the the research and information and make it interesting to
[1:09:21.680 --> 1:09:26.080]  read and it's just charlie's idea i mean i think it's a great idea and a lot of
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:28.560]  even critics are saying it was very well written
[1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:32.000]  and so it's his ball game and i think he's done a great job
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.840]  i mean this is a guy who makes i don't even want to tell you how much money he
[1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:39.120]  makes and how good their family is and how
[1:09:39.120 --> 1:09:42.160]  much they give to charity that nobody knows about
[1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:47.520]  and like i said how they pick up homeless people and give them rides
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:50.480]  and i was talking to his driver charlie usually drives himself but his driver
[1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:53.120]  was driving the airport he goes oh no they constantly do it
[1:09:53.120 --> 1:09:56.800]  they'll even get you know late going places picking up people i mean it's
[1:09:56.800 --> 1:10:01.040]  just they're really good people and when you actually know these people and i
[1:10:01.040 --> 1:10:03.440]  know a lot of other hollywood people who are really good people and when you see
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:06.800]  the media is a distortion and it just has so much
[1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:10.400]  courage i mean this is not fun for him to do he's doing it because he can't
[1:10:10.400 --> 1:10:16.320]  go on with his five children knowing that the government stages terror attacks
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:20.160]  he can't go on not speaking out against it he can't go on it's not
[1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:24.480]  normal to just shut up it's abnormal to read six of the 10 9 11 commission
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:27.920]  members saying it's a fraud and a cover-up and a lie and that there
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:30.880]  should be criminal investigations of the pentagon in the white house
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:34.720]  those are commission members and the councils but that's linked in his 20
[1:10:34.720 --> 1:10:38.640]  minutes with the president i remember him saying yeah i'd like to
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:41.840]  you know write like a letter like i'm talking to the president
[1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:45.120]  because he's seen in a story in the washington post you'd ask him the name
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:48.000]  of that again i've read it but i forgot the title
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:51.360]  where it's like his dad interviewing the president as if he's the president
[1:10:51.360 --> 1:10:54.080]  and it was just interesting and charlie said i think that's an interesting
[1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:57.600]  novel way of doing this and it's kind of the hollywood view of something as
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:00.560]  well and some of the hollywood newspapers you know they picked up on that
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:03.760]  and understand it but uh... that he's not
[1:11:03.760 --> 1:11:08.080]  that is not the whole event that's a small part of it it's the call to arms
[1:11:08.080 --> 1:11:11.440]  that you're going to hear in this video coming up and that you're going to hear
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:14.800]  live friday and then there's more coming up in the future i'm just going to
[1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:20.080]  leave it at that
[1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:23.360]  i'm just going to leave it at that okay when i told you in the video friday
[1:11:23.360 --> 1:11:27.040]  that it's going to be a succession of events
[1:11:27.040 --> 1:11:29.920]  and people say is this the biggest thing i've ever done i think it is charlie
[1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:33.040]  writing this big letter to the president saying he wants to meet with him in
[1:11:33.040 --> 1:11:35.760]  reality saying he wants people to go out in the
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:39.200]  streets for nine eleven truth and that we can't just allow this to be buried
[1:11:39.200 --> 1:11:42.240]  or the government's going to stage more events
[1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:48.160]  and having him on air i mean this is big folks this is big this is blown up
[1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:52.640]  everywhere this is huge just like we told you it was but it takes a day or two
[1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:57.840]  to really explode and regardless of what you
[1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:03.520]  think of me you gotta stand with charlie sheen his amazing courage
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:07.360]  okay uh let's go ahead and start the charlie
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:10.240]  sheen interview you'll recognize the first minute and a half it's what we've
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:13.440]  been playing the last day the last 24 hours but
[1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:17.680]  the other 20 minutes of it is virgin maiden voyage

[1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:33.280]  technical so let's go ahead and go to this interview with charlie
[1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:38.320]  sheen demanding the truth charlie it's great to be here with you
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:41.280]  appreciate you and doing this interview likewise alex thank you
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:44.480]  why after three years of silence concerning 9-11
[1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:48.480]  are you now speaking up and why have you written this public
[1:12:48.480 --> 1:12:55.440]  letter you've now published well alex uh i wrote this letter for
[1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:59.680]  for two reasons firstly i i i wanted to create
[1:12:59.680 --> 1:13:03.760]  a public document specifically rooted in fact
[1:13:03.760 --> 1:13:08.240]  if anybody dares question that i i i would encourage those people to
[1:13:08.240 --> 1:13:11.920]  to to to scrutinize it to research it
[1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:16.720]  that the truth is unchanging alex as we both know
[1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:21.200]  the only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured with the president's
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:26.800]  words everything else will withstand the critical assault i'm more than
[1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:32.480]  prepared to endure and secondly um this is our first new president since 9-11
[1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:36.000]  and they consequently his first 9-11 anniversary
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:42.960]  in office um enough stonewalling enough media manipulation enough
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:48.400]  media mantra speak the families deserve better alex america
[1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:53.120]  deserves better i mean come on come on people the 9-11 commission report is a
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.640]  blatant work of manipulation secrecy and fiction come on the time
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:04.640]  is now demand the truth i personally cannot stand idly by any longer and
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:07.920]  pretend like a the new investigation is just going to
[1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:11.840]  fall out of the heavens right into our congress we have to take action
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:15.440]  we have to stand as one we must insist that our new president deliver on his
[1:14:15.440 --> 1:14:19.760]  promises and that's why alex it's why i've gone right to the top with this is
[1:14:19.760 --> 1:14:24.720]  why i'm asking the president to read my letter to answer my questions in person
[1:14:24.720 --> 1:14:31.680]  and to call for a for a real and open investigation finally
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:34.960]  charlie i noticed that in your letter to the president
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:39.200]  you make the point that several members of the 9-11 commission including the
[1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:42.320]  chairman has said that the pentagon lied to them that
[1:14:42.320 --> 1:14:46.400]  that there were a lot of distortions involved in the chief counsel mr farmer
[1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:50.720]  is now writing a tell-all book and has been interviewed by the washington post
[1:14:50.720 --> 1:14:55.120]  he's out there saying that they met secretly with the pentagon and agreed
[1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:59.120]  to quote lie about almost everything in the commission
[1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:02.560]  so anybody that criticizes you actually say right here right now
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:07.280]  this is insanity you've read the report we've gone over all the documents
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:10.640]  the people on the commission are saying it's a fraud so
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:14.640]  this isn't about charlie sheen or alex jones it's about barack obama because
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:17.840]  he's the new president he's in there george bush is gone that was like
[1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:20.720]  talking to a brick wall and we've got to have a real
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:23.600]  investigation we haven't had a real investigation yet we've got all these
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:27.440]  blacked out pages in the first report 900 pages a bunch of pages in the
[1:15:27.440 --> 1:15:30.320]  9-11 commission reported blacked out i mean
[1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:34.160]  i know i'm ranting here but what do you say to that because it's in your letter
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:38.400]  i mean you're only pointing out that the commission itself says it's a fraud
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:42.960]  well i had faith that as time went on that more would be revealed
[1:15:42.960 --> 1:15:48.640]  month after month a year after year more has continually been revealed and as
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:52.960]  you have stated uh these are the questions these are the facts these are
[1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:56.960]  the issues that found their way into my letter because as i said
[1:15:56.960 --> 1:16:02.160]  not as a challenge just to just to not be misrepresented just to not be
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:07.120]  to be demonized for asking questions when in fact all we're doing is is is what
[1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:11.680]  we have been taught is our is our god given right as americans to question
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:17.440]  something that we know to be let's just say uh suspicious
[1:16:17.440 --> 1:16:20.240]  charlie what about those that are going to counter and you saying how dare you
[1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:24.640]  question the official story that will hurt the victims families feelings uh
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:27.200]  i've talked bill dole the head of the biggest family
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:31.760]  group and he says he believes that we've been lied to by 9-11 we see national
[1:16:31.760 --> 1:16:35.600]  polls uh upwards of 83 question the official story
[1:16:35.600 --> 1:16:39.280]  i mean really we're the majority out there what's your take on this i mean
[1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:43.200]  you see this asinine that every time we ask these serious questions
[1:16:43.200 --> 1:16:46.960]  that the establishment media and the politicians try to say no you're not
[1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:48.800]  allowed to ask questions that's on american
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:51.840]  heavy roosevelt said that it's quintessentially american
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:55.840]  to love your country but to question your government and with all the cover-ups
[1:16:55.840 --> 1:17:00.160]  we've seen all the lies about wmd's and everything else in the commission itself
[1:17:00.160 --> 1:17:03.760]  coming out and saying that the that they agreed to basically lie
[1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:07.040]  uh what's your take on the fact that they're probably gonna
[1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:09.440]  come out and say how dare you ask these questions
[1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:12.560]  alex i actually address that in my open letter
[1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:17.200]  in 20 minutes with the president where i discussed that the message we carry and
[1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:23.280]  by we uh myself america and most importantly
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:27.680]  uh the victim family members uh where i do discuss
[1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:33.200]  um this message will not be silenced anymore by the media field mantras
[1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:38.720]  insisting how they feel and deciding for them for eight long years what can be
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:45.040]  thought what can be said what can be asked even during the 9-11 commission
[1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.760]  the audience was filled with family members screaming that it was a fraud
[1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:51.200]  and a lie you know uh they've been all over the news
[1:17:51.200 --> 1:17:55.120]  saying they want to do an investigation how dare the media
[1:17:55.120 --> 1:17:58.720]  implied in that it hurts the families feeling to ask for what they want to do
[1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:02.400]  an investigation i mean come on alex it was all over the news
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:06.560]  during the 9-11 commission investigation uh that the family members were
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:11.120]  deeply frustrated and the questions that they needed to have asked never saw the
[1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:14.400]  light of day never found those words never found their way
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:18.080]  onto the page into that report and so we're not we're not just
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:22.320]  you know assuming or believing that because we're told
[1:18:22.320 --> 1:18:26.640]  that it's offensive to the families to question all of this
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:30.880]  we know for a fact that this is not the case we know that they've been calling
[1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:33.520]  for a new investigation they've been demanding the truth
[1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:37.120]  they've been looking beyond what they've been force-fed
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:41.840]  and and told was the correct way to behave about their murdered family
[1:18:41.840 --> 1:18:45.680]  members charlie what about all the experts
[1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:49.120]  what is now over 800 different architects engineers and architects
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:52.000]  engineers for 9-11 truth that have signed public
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:55.520]  letters and written reports detailing that it was impossible to avoid the
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:59.120]  towers and building seven fell in the official story
[1:18:59.120 --> 1:19:02.960]  and we have all these physicists coming out and we have
[1:19:02.960 --> 1:19:06.000]  other celebrities coming out too like william elson and governor jesse
[1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:10.080]  ventura what has it been like the last three years
[1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:14.240]  watching all of this unfold it's exciting alex it's encouraging it gives me
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:17.920]  hope but but but rather than categorizing uh the different
[1:19:17.920 --> 1:19:20.960]  different groups in the movement as the the the
[1:19:20.960 --> 1:19:25.680]  architectural group the scientific group uh i think it's important that that
[1:19:25.680 --> 1:19:30.400]  that we all just view ourselves as people of logic
[1:19:30.400 --> 1:19:33.920]  what they're asking us to do essentially what they're asking us to do
[1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:38.800]  is they're asking us to completely suspend everything we have learned
[1:19:38.800 --> 1:19:43.040]  and know to be true for our entire lives and they are asking us
[1:19:43.040 --> 1:19:47.760]  on one specific day to take all of that knowledge all of that experience all of
[1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.880]  that truth stand it on its ear throw it out the
[1:19:50.880 --> 1:19:55.920]  window and and and worship a new form of physics
[1:19:55.920 --> 1:20:01.040]  worship a new form of reality all right we'll be right back

[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:15.040]  we're continuing with this historic interview with Charlie Sheen as he
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:19.360]  breaks his silence about 9-11 and we've got a special
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:23.360]  call to action video coming up tomorrow and then Friday Charlie Sheen live on
[1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:26.480]  the show for those who just tuned in he was live
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:30.560]  for about eight nine minutes and time it out with us
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.720]  at the bottom of the hour so 30 minutes into the show definitely want to tune in
[1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:38.400]  for that on the retransmissions if you missed it making big national news
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:41.280]  let's continue and we'll go out to break with this and then come back and
[1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:45.760]  finish up the interview after the break stay with us
[1:24:45.760 --> 1:24:49.360]  what they're asking us to do essentially what they're asking us to do is
[1:24:49.360 --> 1:24:54.160]  they're asking us to completely suspend everything we have learned
[1:24:54.160 --> 1:24:58.400]  and know to be true for our entire lives and they are asking us
[1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:03.120]  on one specific day to take all of that knowledge all of that experience all of
[1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:06.960]  that truth stand it on its ear throw it out the window
[1:25:06.960 --> 1:25:12.640]  and and and worship a new form of physics worship a new form of
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:16.000]  reality that is completely inconsistent with
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:20.560]  everything we know in each and every cell of our entire being
[1:25:20.560 --> 1:25:23.760]  and it's important to know that we're not just as we are told
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:27.600]  to believe these things and then we are demonized for questioning them
[1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:30.560]  as a free human being as a free american you're supposed to be able to question
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:33.120]  the government and we got building seven forty seven
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:37.040]  story building with a cia headquartered in it falls at free fall speed niss has
[1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:40.720]  now admitted that after denying it for years and then we're demonized for
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:43.360]  asking questions with the nine eleven commission itself
[1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:47.200]  and their chief counsel is saying it's a fraud is writing a tell-all book
[1:25:47.200 --> 1:25:50.080]  i see this whole cover-up collapsing just like those buildings did when they
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:53.840]  blew them sky high well alex all we can do all we can do
[1:25:53.840 --> 1:25:57.840]  is continue to ask the questions continue to apply the pressure
[1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:01.280]  continue to insist that no this is not good enough
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:05.200]  we are better than this we deserve better than this and and and we will not
[1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.400]  settle for anything shy of that that's a big question charlie
[1:26:08.400 --> 1:26:11.120]  why are you doing this like you do it three years ago
[1:26:11.120 --> 1:26:14.880]  why now today what is it that drives you that makes you different from a lot of
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:18.080]  big hollywood stars me you're you know super a list
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:21.120]  top of your game and why are you focused on these
[1:26:21.120 --> 1:26:25.520]  issues with so many other people uh you know your level are
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:29.760]  you know worried about their skin cream alex for twenty six years more than half
[1:26:29.760 --> 1:26:34.480]  of my life i have been creating fiction for a living so believe me when i tell
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:38.480]  you i i i recognize it when it when it presents itself
[1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:41.920]  and even more so when it is forced into my grill
[1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:47.280]  so on that note alex i'm i'm i'm no longer afraid to say that that that the
[1:26:47.280 --> 1:26:52.240]  official nine eleven story is is an absolute fairy tale a complete work
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:55.920]  of fiction and not even a very good one well your letter makes perfect sense on
[1:26:55.920 --> 1:26:58.640]  that point this thing is a work of fiction they
[1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:00.960]  admit it's a fraud it's been proven to be alive from
[1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:04.640]  end to end but we don't know exactly what happened that day
[1:27:04.640 --> 1:27:07.920]  hence we do need to have a new investigation are you confident that
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:11.760]  congress could engage in a free and open impartial
[1:27:11.760 --> 1:27:16.080]  uh you know new commission or would they use the exclusive national security
[1:27:16.080 --> 1:27:18.400]  to cover up again well of course alex nothing's
[1:27:18.400 --> 1:27:22.080]  perfect but uh but in view of of the evidence that
[1:27:22.080 --> 1:27:26.880]  continues to reveal itself um a new and open investigation is
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:29.840]  certainly a step in the right direction and here's the problem
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:33.360]  when guys like myself choose to to to take a stand
[1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:39.360]  uh against this this uh um level of tyranny for for
[1:27:39.360 --> 1:27:41.920]  tyranny and deception for lack of a better term
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:49.680]  um they they spin it into uh this notion this idea that that we have
[1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:53.520]  you know we have cracked the case we have the answers we figured this thing
[1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:56.720]  out no no no that's not what we're doing here all we're
[1:27:56.720 --> 1:28:00.160]  really saying is that you know what we've been
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:06.960]  told to believe we we we must reject on face value we must reject it and
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:11.760]  therefore that is the foundation of the questions that so many of us have
[1:28:11.760 --> 1:28:15.600]  that's so many of us share because it's not about having the answers
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:19.280]  we know their stories are fraud alex we are looking for the truth
[1:28:19.280 --> 1:28:22.800]  let's just talk about this for one second alex and this is really bothering me
[1:28:22.800 --> 1:28:29.360]  from day one how is it that two completely random events
[1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:34.560]  result in an identical occurrence you're talking about the collapse of the
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:38.080]  north and south tower i ask you again alex how is it
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:43.680]  that two completely random events result in an identical occurrence two
[1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:48.000]  different types of jet liners different fuel different places but the
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:50.800]  building's collapsed the same way but what about building seven it's not hit by a
[1:28:50.800 --> 1:28:52.960]  plane and then now they've got all that thermite and
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:56.720]  thermate reports and peer reviewed journals and and then all these videos
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:28:58.880]  of police and firemen seeing the government told them to get back
[1:28:58.880 --> 1:29:02.240]  building seven was it come down i think we should treat building seven
[1:29:02.240 --> 1:29:06.080]  exactly as the 9-11 commission reported and completely ignore it because guess
[1:29:06.080 --> 1:29:08.560]  what when you completely ignore something it magically
[1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:11.280]  disappears isn't that what we've been taught to believe
[1:29:11.280 --> 1:29:14.880]  oh yeah that makes a lot of sense
[1:29:14.880 --> 1:29:18.480]  hey i talked to the public and a lot of them we know there was a 47-story building
[1:29:18.480 --> 1:29:22.400]  way off from the main towers it wasn't hit by a plane had a few windows knocked
[1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:26.480]  out and had the cia based it and then it collapses in on itself and then there's
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:30.160]  all these cnn videos of police and firemen seeing get back they're
[1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:34.160]  going to bring the building down we've got jane sanley the reporter for bbc
[1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:37.440]  world and then simultaneously on bbc 24 the other
[1:29:37.440 --> 1:29:40.560]  reporters 25 minutes before building seven collapses after
[1:29:40.560 --> 1:29:44.320]  five p.m in the afternoon they get on the news and say building seven has
[1:29:44.320 --> 1:29:46.960]  collapsed into its own footprint symmetrically
[1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:51.200]  and right out the window is building seven and then the bbc for years
[1:29:51.200 --> 1:29:55.040]  we're on the march the empire's on the run

[1:33:19.760 --> 1:33:25.680]  Reuters AP entertainment
[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:30.960]  houston chronicle la times massive coverage of charlie sheen and his
[1:33:30.960 --> 1:33:35.920]  request to have a meeting with president obama and then
[1:33:35.920 --> 1:33:40.320]  begin to make this event about obama and how obama has done nothing that that
[1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:44.560]  was charlie's main reason for writing it as a mock letter
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:49.040]  with the disclosure at the end was to make it about barack obama and 911 to
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:52.640]  put it into his court but the bigger announcement is he
[1:33:52.640 --> 1:33:56.480]  wants the american people to take action and to stand up and demand the
[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:00.480]  truth we plan a special video tomorrow and then
[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:05.280]  charlie sheen for an extended live interview on friday
[1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:08.800]  we have uh richard gauge coming up with 30 minutes in the next hour to talk
[1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:15.120]  about the hit piece that was put out on
[1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:18.640]  national geographic channel against 911 truth just completely shoddy
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:21.440]  and then we'll take calls for 30 minutes then we've got for 30 minutes
[1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:25.600]  professor steven jones coming on it was also in the hit piece
[1:34:25.600 --> 1:34:28.640]  and we're telling gauge it was going to be hit pieces like oh no they're
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:31.120]  listening to all my facts and looking at all my evidence so they won't put it
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:35.680]  in there because i knew the production company
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:41.840]  creative differences i've refused repeatedly to be interviewed by them
[1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:46.240]  they're the guys that have made repeated jfk hit pieces
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:50.320]  making fun of those 90 plus percent major polls that believe the government
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:53.840]  killed kennedy of course 80 something percent used to say the
[1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:58.560]  government stage called baton can now let's declassified admitted
[1:34:59.360 --> 1:35:03.520]  so we're going to be talking about all of that today but really
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:07.600]  charlie sheen exposing 911 truth is big and it's important
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:13.040]  but i had no idea this week that the government would launch part two and
[1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:17.200]  the media would launch part two of its announcement and its conditioning of
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:22.800]  the public that the only way the dollar is going to be saved
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:26.640]  is to bring in a new bank of the world that will set and control our carbon
[1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:29.360]  taxes and our daily lives and that is now
[1:35:29.360 --> 1:35:32.880]  in the french news the german news the british news we read a bunch of headlines
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:37.760]  yesterday it is now in financial times of
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:44.000]  london it is everywhere that america will collapse and be like
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:47.200]  argentina there will be millions of people homeless the dollar will become
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:51.440]  worthless overnight or near worthless unless we have a new bank of the world
[1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:56.080]  give the bankers and engineered the collapse total power and control
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:00.080]  or say don't mention that they engineered it that is now all over the news i
[1:36:00.080 --> 1:36:02.560]  have a stack of it here and i'm going to cover that
[1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:06.480]  some today as well at the end of the show
[1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:09.440]  you see we talk about how they're going to implode the economy and implode the
[1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:12.960]  dollar and bring in a world government set up for and by the banks
[1:36:12.960 --> 1:36:15.920]  off their own documents for 14 years people make fun of us
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:19.040]  now it's all happening see it's not about alex jones it's about the
[1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:22.080]  documents and the evidence and the history
[1:36:22.080 --> 1:36:25.200]  the open announcement of the pentagon that they want 4 000 troops and then 20
[1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:29.120]  000 troops then 40 000 troops and now 400 000 troops
[1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:32.800]  openly in congress and we want to occupy every city with military
[1:36:32.800 --> 1:36:36.480]  and oh we're getting ready for mass quarantines and roundups and arrest and
[1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:39.440]  i don't know that's going to happen but they're certainly testing the water
[1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:44.800]  sending up a trial balloon it's all going on right now and i'm
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:47.440]  telling you they're going to stage terror attacks even michael savage
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:51.920]  agrees even glenn beckett said they may stage something
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:56.320]  even dick morris gets up on tv and says yeah it's a new world order world
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:36:59.680]  government taking over new world currency it's true the conspiracy
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:04.880]  theorists were right and hannity's just turning red while he's saying it
[1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:08.960]  look folks the globalist or experts at getting us to fight with each other
[1:37:08.960 --> 1:37:14.800]  over christian muslim jewish uh muslim black white young old cop
[1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:17.840]  versus citizen citizen versus cop and i've fallen into some of that
[1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:20.800]  fashion police because they have been trained to be out of control in many
[1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:23.360]  areas and a lot of bad things but there's also a lot of good police that give us
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:26.720]  a lot of good info i run into a lot of them across the country
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:31.760]  when i had the 911 truth meeting with 1200 people that c-span taped and aired
[1:37:31.760 --> 1:37:37.120]  out in l.a. there were several big hollywood stars there
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:42.720]  and i was talking to the off duty in one case and retired another la pd
[1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:47.360]  detectives who were their bodyguards that's the best bodyguards they say
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:50.480]  because it's not just some rambo guy it's somebody that knows investigations
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:53.600]  knows how to assess people and they're like look
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:58.000]  everybody who was in the detective squad when 911 happened knew it was an inside
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:01.360]  job give us a break we know what we're looking at
[1:38:01.360 --> 1:38:04.640]  anybody who's got any instincts or any brain
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:09.760]  knows and i understand it's scary to know the truth and face it you think i
[1:38:09.760 --> 1:38:15.600]  like it you think i like going on here
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.840]  endangering my family my name everything you think i like being beat up in a
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:22.480]  parking lot i think i like death threats to my
[1:38:22.480 --> 1:38:26.880]  wife my children but i'm in this past the point of
[1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:30.480]  return and if if more people would just stand up and know the truth
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:33.280]  we could take this country in this world back because if we take the tool of
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:37.200]  false flag terror away from these people it's over
[1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:39.760]  it's over
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:44.880]  so the establishment is going to try to spin the sheen report and say how dare
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:50.000]  you write a mock letter and then murphy's law falling into
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:53.440]  their hands of you know the disclaimer and some of the other links at the
[1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:56.240]  bottom well the links themselves weren't there at first
[1:38:56.240 --> 1:38:59.680]  just all the dozens of links didn't show up it's weird our WordPress you know
[1:38:59.680 --> 1:39:03.200]  try to divert off into that the point is we're up on the eighth
[1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:10.080]  year anniversary of the staged events and it's bigger
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:12.800]  than bush it's bigger than clinton it's bigger than barack obama we make that
[1:39:12.800 --> 1:39:17.360]  point the obama deception look at the obama deception
[1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:20.320]  months and months what two three months into its release it was over 15 million
[1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:23.040]  views i could count up on google and youtube and other channels that had
[1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:24.880]  counters and that was spent in 30 40 minutes
[1:39:24.880 --> 1:39:28.320]  just going through sites counting them up with a calculator
[1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:31.360]  i did it a couple months later it was 20 million and i didn't have time to go
[1:39:31.360 --> 1:39:33.760]  count up all the sites there's thousands of places
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:36.800]  that you can find right now where it's posted with a million views a half
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:40.080]  million views three and a half million views two million views
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:45.280]  600 000 views 900 000 views 10 000 views 40 000 views
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:48.480]  20 plus million and i haven't counted it up in months
[1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:51.760]  i'm just a regular guy who made that film in three months
[1:39:51.760 --> 1:39:54.480]  i did two months of research and put it together in a month
[1:39:54.480 --> 1:39:59.360]  i'm making fall the republic right now i've got a big announcement on that it
[1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:02.720]  is coming out october 1st
[1:40:04.720 --> 1:40:08.160]  i'll just make that big announcement later
[1:40:08.160 --> 1:40:15.600]  the point is look at lucrodowski a 19-year-old young man who got involved
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:19.280]  and wanted to make the the 911 truth movement about the new world order and
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:22.000]  about who pulled the strings of the president he wanted to make it about
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.800]  something bigger than bush he wanted to march to david
[1:40:24.800 --> 1:40:28.400]  rockefeller's house he wanted to march to the un and 911 truth new york i'm not
[1:40:28.400 --> 1:40:30.800]  saying they're bad folks but they basically kicked him out of it
[1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:33.360]  and he said fine i'll go start mongrups i remember talking to him he was all
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:37.440]  bummed out i barely knew him only met him once
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:43.760]  and i said luke i said you gotta go start your own group and he said well i'm
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:47.440]  just a kid and i said no you're not people already see you as a leader that's
[1:40:47.440 --> 1:40:49.680]  why you've been kicked out of this other group
[1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:52.880]  because it becomes like a turf thing i said go out and start your own group
[1:40:52.880 --> 1:40:55.840]  and he's a couple days later called me and said what about we are changed i
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:58.640]  said yeah and that from gondi yeah be the change want to see in the world and i
[1:40:58.640 --> 1:41:04.080]  said that's great this is three years ago
[1:41:04.080 --> 1:41:09.040]  long before obama was using that term and the establishment scared of it folks
[1:41:09.040 --> 1:41:12.800]  they've run scyops or they have people connected to the bush administration
[1:41:12.800 --> 1:41:15.600]  at events where we are changes demonstrating outside just run up out
[1:41:15.600 --> 1:41:18.480]  of an alley with a girl in a wheelchair running it into
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:23.360]  german talus and when it finally got to court he wouldn't
[1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:28.000]  plead bargain suddenly the police changed their story and said
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:33.200]  okay we didn't see him hit her and they literally put the candy cap girl in a
[1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:38.560]  girl scout outfit with a puppy in her arms up on the stand
[1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:42.160]  stuffed puppy playing the part of a little victim and
[1:41:42.160 --> 1:41:44.880]  her testimony fell apart and then they got the secret service up there in the
[1:41:44.880 --> 1:41:48.320]  secret service if this isn't true because that secret service agent wasn't
[1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:52.000]  going to lie about somebody and on top of it blow their whole career when it
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.480]  came out but i mean it was in the new york post they had to do a
[1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:57.440]  retraction everywhere that 911 truthers were jumping out of
[1:41:57.440 --> 1:42:00.640]  alleys attacking people in wheelchairs folks if you see news headlines
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.920]  someday that you know that i've attacked a young girl in a wheelchair
[1:42:03.920 --> 1:42:07.760]  it isn't true but that's what the scyop
[1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:11.600]  people think about they go what'll work how do we make
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:14.880]  us the victims we don't like these guys protesting laura bush
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:19.600]  they're going to every event julianis intelligence is following them
[1:42:19.600 --> 1:42:22.960]  bloomberg's intelligence is following cops are coming up off-duty cops retire
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:26.240]  cops cops in uniform we're going to plant bombs on you and guns we know
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:29.280]  you're not terrorist but you'll be in 30 days in the hole before we can sort
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:33.360]  that out and laugh like gangsters
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:39.760]  that's what 911 truth is facing this is a absolute in the trenches fight
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:45.280]  ladies and gentlemen my life wouldn't be worth 10 cents they love to kill me
[1:42:45.280 --> 1:42:48.880]  but they don't want to underline and highlight everything i've said everything
[1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:51.760]  i've done and make me a martyr and believe me that
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:54.880]  would water the tree of liberty but i don't want it to happen i enjoy my life
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:57.920]  i enjoy my children i enjoy looking at the stars i enjoy
[1:42:57.920 --> 1:43:01.520]  fishing i enjoy swimming i enjoy camping i enjoy jogging
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:05.520]  i enjoy kissing my wife i enjoy visiting my grandmother
[1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:08.640]  85 years old
[1:43:14.160 --> 1:43:17.600]  but there's no future if we don't stand up to these people
[1:43:17.600 --> 1:43:20.640]  and that's why the system hates me so much and all their co-intell pro hates me
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:23.520]  so much and all these other jealous people hate me even because they're not
[1:43:23.520 --> 1:43:28.000]  government because i'm up on the pedestal
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:31.760]  everybody says i'm the leader of the anti-war movement worldwide i'm now
[1:43:31.760 --> 1:43:35.040]  being recognized as that and i'm not perfect i've said over and over again
[1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:38.640]  folks i'm not up to the job you know who carries the trash out a
[1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:41.280]  lot of times here if it hadn't been done in a couple days and i see
[1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:46.640]  fruit flies flying around me you know who puts light bulbs in me
[1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:49.600]  then i scrunch around trying to get the money just to finance this place then i
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:51.600]  get paranoid i don't want to hire new people
[1:43:51.600 --> 1:43:57.200]  so we get infiltrated man my life's a spy movie ladies and gentlemen
[1:43:57.200 --> 1:44:01.840]  and i'm not a spy i'm not i wasn't trained to do this i'm just a guy from
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:05.520]  the suburbs of dallas texas who found out about the un and gun control in the
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:09.040]  new world order and i'm concerned and i'm upset
[1:44:09.040 --> 1:44:11.760]  and i went and got an access tv show and i got a radio show and i got a
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:15.840]  syndicated radio show i fell into it just like lucas falling into it
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:19.040]  and now i'm here at this point with everything i do
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:21.920]  everything i'm shaving analyzed i got all these emails and saw this website
[1:44:21.920 --> 1:44:26.000]  going alex jones the liar lies and says
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:29.760]  terror storm is his newest movie and gc in it
[1:44:29.760 --> 1:44:34.560]  all because gc in put in some of my old ads and rotation
[1:44:34.560 --> 1:44:38.320]  so i told him put the in game one back in and
[1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:41.680]  they put the others back in which is fine and then i mean that gets nitpicked
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:45.120]  oh look you know a three-year-old ad says my newest film it's a three-year-old
[1:44:45.120 --> 1:44:48.240]  ad i cut three years ago i don't have the time to go cut a new one
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:53.120]  it's just it's just like i've got to be spotless up on this white horse perfect
[1:44:53.120 --> 1:44:56.880]  you know literally when i go to the bathroom flowers come out no that's
[1:44:56.880 --> 1:45:01.040]  not what happens when i go to the bathroom folks

[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:32.400]  new world order ladies and gentlemen you get out there
[1:45:32.400 --> 1:45:37.040]  and you do it because we don't have any future if we don't i want to finish up
[1:45:37.040 --> 1:45:40.080]  the sheen interview how much is left of this virgin interview
[1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:43.280]  how much is left on the timeline
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:50.160]  look the the globalists have have have learned how to play us off against each
[1:45:50.160 --> 1:45:52.560]  other how to divide and conquer we can't allow that to happen it's about the
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:55.920]  ideas we have to take action and get the word out
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.560]  so let's just say it i'm the bad man i'm evil i'm all these things i'm not
[1:46:00.560 --> 1:46:05.040]  but i'm sure not perfect fine but what are we going to do about argentina
[1:46:05.040 --> 1:46:08.080]  collapse folks what are you going to do when you're homeless what are you going
[1:46:08.080 --> 1:46:11.120]  to do when they implode the economy by design to bring in martial law this is
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:15.760]  real i'm concerned i'm really worried i believe the
[1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:18.960]  things i say i got up here in january and said they're
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:22.560]  planning something big with the flu i told you we were level six three months
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:27.360]  before it was made mainstream news i get sent secret documents
[1:46:27.360 --> 1:46:31.360]  i got army intelligence following me around the mainstream media admits it
[1:46:31.360 --> 1:46:36.160]  i have the army following me around
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:40.880]  that are in the fed events this is real ladies and gentlemen what charlie sheen is
[1:46:40.880 --> 1:46:43.760]  doing is real the establishment hates it because they know i'm right
[1:46:43.760 --> 1:46:46.320]  they know i'm a good person they know my heart's in the right place they know i'm
[1:46:46.320 --> 1:46:48.960]  a real leader and they're desperate to tear that down
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:51.120]  and let me tell you something i've studied history i don't want this
[1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:54.400]  leadership position i don't like it that's why i've always made it about you
[1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:57.680]  because that's the path to victory and it's the path to me not getting my head
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:00.800]  blown off or set up
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:05.280]  all right let's finish up in three parts the virgin never before heard sheen
[1:47:05.280 --> 1:47:10.640]  interview back to it men we've got jane sanley the reporter for bbc world
[1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:13.920]  and then simultaneously on bbc 24 the other reporters
[1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:18.080]  25 minutes before building seven collapses after 5 p.m in the afternoon
[1:47:18.080 --> 1:47:21.040]  they get on the news and say building seven has collapsed into its own
[1:47:21.040 --> 1:47:25.200]  footprint symmetrically and right out the window is building seven
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:28.480]  and then the bbc for years wouldn't comment on it now they admit oh that was
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:31.840]  just an accident and then later they changed their story and said oh
[1:47:31.840 --> 1:47:35.920]  reuters sent us an internal report saying it had collapsed
[1:47:35.920 --> 1:47:40.000]  first they said we've misplaced the tape that was their first response
[1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.080]  at first immediate when we broke that because one of our listeners just saw
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.280]  the video in some archives made the point so we broke that at
[1:47:47.280 --> 1:47:52.960]  prisonlinux.com for two or three weeks it was we were liars it was a fake video
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:48:00.400]  she had a blue screen behind her the time stamp on the tv was wrong
[1:48:00.400 --> 1:48:04.000]  and then bbc said they lost the tape they couldn't comment
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:07.200]  and you're right later they came on said okay it was an accident she said well
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:11.920]  who fed you that somebody did false scripting that's just like with jfk
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:16.640]  when stuff in asia before oswald even been captured they
[1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:19.520]  already had his name and newspaper somebody got that
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:22.800]  false scripting wrong but this is in front of everybody on tv they're saying
[1:48:22.800 --> 1:48:26.720]  building seven has collapsed and its own footprint could be collapsed from fire
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:29.920]  and there it is right behind them and no steel building had ever collapsed from
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:34.000]  fire in all of history except that day tower one and two but they
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  were hit by a plane that was their excuse jet fuel
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:39.680]  pancaking all of this which this has had now had to back off of
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:44.080]  but then seven is hit by nothing and then they false script
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:47.600]  but i guess we're not supposed to ask those questions it's unamerican
[1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:51.760]  just like i guess msnbc and syherge new yorker weren't supposed to
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:56.880]  report on dick cheney wanting to attack our ships and living on iran
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:02.240]  maybe according to them it's unpatriotic well i guess we've arrived at a place
[1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:05.600]  where it's it's it's unpatriotic to be a person of logic
[1:49:05.600 --> 1:49:10.080]  charlie i noticed that you are critical of barack obama on his civil rights
[1:49:10.080 --> 1:49:13.200]  uh record and he says he'd get rid of warrantless wiretapping as the american
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:15.920]  people he's keeping it he said he was going to vote against the patriot act he
[1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:19.680]  voted to reauthorize it he says in the end the secret arrest the rendition
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:24.880]  program is keeping it let me just say this alex um
[1:49:24.880 --> 1:49:30.160]  he got my vote based on what i heard
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:36.000]  but not on what i've observed since so like elvis says a little less possible
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:39.920]  more action uh amen elvis now you've also got the
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:43.680]  point that he attacked indefinite attention that bush had and then now
[1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:46.960]  he's just saying it's what's the term you're using your letter
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:50.560]  permanent attention yes this permanent attention he's saying in speeches even
[1:49:50.560 --> 1:49:54.080]  if somebody's found not guilty by the tribunal we may just have to keep them
[1:49:54.080 --> 1:49:57.520]  for the rest of their lives i mean that sounds like bush on steroids are you
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:00.800]  confident that uh if we put enough pressure on him we can get into
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:04.480]  investigation i'm not confident about anything alex but uh
[1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:07.920]  sir just trying that you're doing your best absolutely duty is ours once
[1:50:07.920 --> 1:50:10.640]  long as you got it there you go the greatest journey begins with the first
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:13.680]  step char let's go over just a few of these uh points in your letter i mean
[1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:16.720]  first and obviously go to info wars dot com or prison five dot com it's all of the

[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:31.680]  but i notice in there you talk about uh something that came out last year that's
[1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:36.000]  gotten hardly any attention cyhur's Pulitzer prize winner new yorker magazine
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:39.760]  comes out and even gives speeches saying that dick shaney was planning to paint
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:44.160]  up uh fake iranian patrol boats man with native seals
[1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:47.760]  and have them attack us destroyers and the straight up were moose

[1:53:59.680 --> 1:54:03.680]  but i noticed in there you talk about something that came out last year that's
[1:54:03.680 --> 1:54:07.200]  gotten hardly any attention cyhur's Pulitzer Prize winner New Yorker
[1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:10.960]  magazine comes out and even gives speeches saying that Dick Cheney was
[1:54:10.960 --> 1:54:14.800]  planning to paint up uh fake Iranian patrol boats
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:18.480]  man them with navy seals and have them attack U.S. destroyers
[1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:21.760]  and the straight up were moose to blame it on Iran
[1:54:21.760 --> 1:54:24.800]  I love that you put that in your piece that right there to the president should
[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:28.560]  be plenty of evidence to open an investigation in 9-11 because you got
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:31.280]  operation northwoods you mentioned you've got the Gulf of Tonkin
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:34.160]  I mean this seems like their favorite trick something you didn't mention in
[1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:38.480]  your letter uh is that letter that Gary Hart sent that open letter to Iran
[1:54:38.480 --> 1:54:41.520]  talking about you know our government stages provocations you better watch your
[1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:45.280]  butt I mean look I know I'm ranting Charlie I'm glad
[1:54:45.280 --> 1:54:48.800]  that you put it in your piece about the whole situation where Dick Cheney
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:52.160]  wanted to stage attacks on our ships with navy seals
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:54:55.600]  dressed up like Iranian soldiers on fake Iranian patrol boats
[1:54:55.600 --> 1:54:58.960]  uh I mean isn't that enough evidence right there to open an investigation 9-11
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:02.960]  not even mentioning Gulf of Tonkin or northwoods one would hope so Alex one
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:07.760]  would like to believe uh such would be the case
[1:55:07.760 --> 1:55:11.920]  however as I say to the president in my letter
[1:55:11.920 --> 1:55:16.640]  Mr. President I really wish I was making this stuff up I'd sleep a lot better
[1:55:16.640 --> 1:55:19.520]  at night if I were Charlie we're just a few hours into your
[1:55:19.520 --> 1:55:23.040]  letter being published and already a lot of media is asking the question
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:26.400]  is Charlie Cheney serious does he really want a meeting with the president you
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:29.920]  told me on the phone earlier and you told me earlier before we were on air
[1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:33.440]  that yes indeed you do want an interview absolutely
[1:55:33.440 --> 1:55:36.720]  absolutely I would not have constructed this document
[1:55:36.720 --> 1:55:41.040]  if that was not my ultimate goal so is this letter to get his attention I mean
[1:55:41.040 --> 1:55:43.840]  I'm sure this is gonna go across his head I would hope so
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.160]  I would hope so and if it doesn't if for some reason this uh this this this
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:52.560]  doesn't make it into his hands and and and I'm never granted my 20 minutes with
[1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:56.480]  my president uh then I would urge the American people I
[1:55:56.480 --> 1:56:00.720]  would urge anybody and everybody that that that has a stake in this which
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:04.080]  would be all of us to to continue to apply the
[1:56:04.080 --> 1:56:08.640]  pressure to continue to ask the questions to continue to demand the
[1:56:08.640 --> 1:56:11.760]  truth Charlie in your gut do you think the
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:15.280]  president's gonna actually use that interview because regardless
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:18.640]  he's gonna see the questions and I mean millions of people now are gonna be
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:21.200]  reading your letter and and and they're gonna be asking these questions so
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:24.320]  either way the truth wins and the truth always wins
[1:56:24.320 --> 1:56:28.400]  Alex the truth is uh the truth is unchanging as I stated earlier
[1:56:28.400 --> 1:56:32.160]  if the president ignores this that's on him
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:37.040]  if he accepts it that's on me Charlie your letter to the president closes
[1:56:37.040 --> 1:56:40.320]  are you saying to him make sure you're on the right side of history
[1:56:40.320 --> 1:56:43.360]  what did you mean by that what I meant by that Alex
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:46.960]  was that this is his chance to do the right thing and for
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:51.520]  much too long now our government
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:55.360]  has been on the wrong side of history Charlie when I read your letter
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:58.560]  what really hit me was that this sounded like the president
[1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:02.000]  in fact I noticed that some of the things in his responses
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:05.520]  were quotes or paraphrased quotes from things he's actually said you did your
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:09.120]  research on this how long did it take you to write this letter
[1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:12.240]  uh yes I did do my research and I did take my time
[1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:16.800]  um it was uh there were some very long nights and some very long days
[1:57:16.800 --> 1:57:20.720]  probably over a two-week period um but let's face it
[1:57:20.720 --> 1:57:24.080]  Alex uh these people at the end of the day
[1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:27.280]  they're in show business I'm in show business so
[1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:31.040]  you know these people read from scripts I read from scripts so
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:35.600]  it's not too too too far fetched for me to to
[1:57:35.600 --> 1:57:40.000]  to grasp the nature and the the style in which they communicate
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:43.840]  speaking of reading off scripts Obama won't give a speech unless he's reading
[1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:47.200]  off those teleprompters and uh more often than not it seems like he
[1:57:47.200 --> 1:57:49.760]  does the opposite of what he says he's going to do
[1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:53.120]  and I was hearing your letter here a little bit uh rough on him when it
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:57:56.160]  comes to some of his police state activities were you shocked as an
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:59.440]  Obama supporter to see him go back on so many of his promises
[1:57:59.440 --> 1:58:04.240]  was I shocked yes was I was it disappointed absolutely was I
[1:58:04.240 --> 1:58:08.400]  surprised certainly not this is the political age that we
[1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:12.320]  live in but but but we have to we have to break out of that
[1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:16.560]  mold we have to reject this we have to stop accepting the fact
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:20.480]  that's just what they do they just lied it was no because look at the history
[1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:24.400]  of it ultimately it just leads to bigger and
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:28.560]  more damaging lies down the road well mr

[2:00:38.480 --> 2:00:41.360]  letter with all the hyperlinks to official government documents and
[2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:44.640]  mainstream media this stuff really is hidden in plain view
[2:00:44.640 --> 2:00:47.920]  and tens of millions more people are now going to find out the truth

[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:16.240]  hard questions and wake people up and i challenge them
[2:01:16.240 --> 2:01:19.840]  to demand the truth the ball is in the american people's court i mean you've
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:22.800]  you put it into obama's court giving them a chance to the right thing but
[2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:26.480]  regardless as you said earlier we've done the right thing just
[2:01:26.480 --> 2:01:29.920]  asking these questions it's your right it's your duty it is the
[2:01:29.920 --> 2:01:33.440]  epitome of patriotism to love your country but to question your government
[2:01:33.440 --> 2:01:36.800]  and with the history we've seen of them lying constantly being caught lying on
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:40.320]  the wmd's and all of it all i can say is thank god
[2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:44.560]  and people like you that have courage because um in a serious times like this
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:49.200]  so we we need good men and women as thomas jefferson said it best
[2:01:49.200 --> 2:01:53.120]  all the evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:56.640]  nothing and thanks to good people like you charlie got a fighting chance and
[2:01:56.640 --> 2:02:00.000]  that time i was on cnn and then of course you know
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  and um and there's one other club i love and that was by mark twain
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  in the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:11.760]  but in time when his cause succeeds the tim would join him because then
[2:02:11.760 --> 2:02:15.120]  it costs nothing to be a patriot and you charlie sheen
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:18.080]  are a patriot thank you for spending this time with us today

[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:29.120]  was a fraud and a lie and a cover-up and needed to be criminally
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:32.160]  investigated it's even been in the news but never gets any traction
[2:09:32.160 --> 2:09:35.840]  never becomes a big issue we can't just sit here
[2:09:35.840 --> 2:09:41.440]  idly by and let all this continue so my point is you're crazy to not know about
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:44.240]  the history government sponsored terror you're crazy
[2:09:44.240 --> 2:09:50.160]  to not know about all the cases out there or
[2:09:50.160 --> 2:09:52.800]  hitler firebombed his own Reichstag in 33 out
[2:09:52.800 --> 2:09:55.520]  February 27th to get police state going in Germany
[2:09:55.520 --> 2:09:58.880]  or how Stalin staged terror attacks or how the czarist one of their favorite
[2:09:58.880 --> 2:10:01.920]  tactics was to stage terror attacks and blame it on their enemies or how

[2:10:05.440 --> 2:10:10.800]  many of the ira bombing some were real or haritz and jerusalem post admit that
[2:10:10.800 --> 2:10:15.200]  quote israel headline created fake al-qaeda groups
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:18.160]  every time it was about to be a peace deal there is of course real terrorism
[2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:20.400]  in israel going on and it's terrible but the point is
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:25.920]  israeli papers admit the government's been caught staging and at key points
[2:10:25.920 --> 2:10:29.200]  that's what we're talking about here and then you look at the science the
[2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:31.680]  establishment likes to do these hit pieces on the science because they know
[2:10:31.680 --> 2:10:34.240]  the general public aren't architects or engineers or
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:38.080]  physicists or uh underwriting laboratories people like
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:41.920]  kevin ryan they can put shoot a missile into a chicken coop and say it would
[2:10:41.920 --> 2:10:45.200]  have blown the pentagon up they can show you a three-story
[2:10:45.200 --> 2:10:47.520]  building and say if we would have blown it up we would have found
[2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:51.360]  debt court uh i mean they could do so many little things little
[2:10:51.360 --> 2:10:55.120]  gimmicks or say we're crazy and just want to believe this
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:10:58.800]  when the history that we have is a continual chain
[2:10:58.800 --> 2:11:02.720]  of staged terror attacks now on the charlie sheen issue and we're going to

[2:12:23.360 --> 2:12:26.880]  so that it would become a big issue of him wanting to actually meet with the
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:29.840]  president that's what he talked about earlier when he was live on the show
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:32.960]  in the tape interview we just aired that's the whole point
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:38.080]  of what we're doing okay is to get people look at those 20 points in the
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:41.200]  20 questions of the president and it was all charlie's idea
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:44.640]  every bit of it uh was done exactly the way he wanted
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:49.120]  and it was a genius idea even a brilliant idea even people criticizing him
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:54.560]  and don't agree with 911 truth are saying was very well written
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:57.680]  so it's very exciting let's go to richard gauge richard
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:02.000]  appreciate you coming on first off the charlie sheen situation
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:06.480]  of what's your take on it well we we need people
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:09.920]  in the entertainment world uh in hollywood
[2:13:09.920 --> 2:13:16.480]  uh talking about uh 911 truth and and charlie began this uh what four years
[2:13:16.480 --> 2:13:20.640]  ago five years ago three three and a half him three and a half he took
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:24.400]  so much heat for this that he had to back off until there was more
[2:13:24.400 --> 2:13:28.240]  support at a grassroots level and we've got that now we've got
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:32.080]  830 architects and engineers backing him up
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:36.560]  saying yes these buildings came down by explosive control demolition so with
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:40.480]  all of this support and others of course across the 911 truth movement
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:44.640]  supporting him he can come out and make a splash now and maybe it's time
[2:13:44.640 --> 2:13:48.800]  elix and you've really supported him and given him a vehicle
[2:13:48.800 --> 2:13:53.200]  for this uh expression of coming out of the closet again
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:56.640]  and and and building truth this is what has to happen
[2:13:56.640 --> 2:14:00.320]  and then it has to happen with willy nelson and jessie ventura
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:05.280]  and others who have kind of squeaked a little bit here and there but now it's
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:10.560]  time isn't it well it certainly is my friend
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:15.760]  so much is going on so much is happening uh right now
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:19.920]  let's get into there's several new hit pieces for discovery channel and
[2:14:19.920 --> 2:14:23.600]  history channel and a and e that are being made pbs is making another hit
[2:14:23.600 --> 2:14:27.760]  piece the british have made six in the last year and a half that i know of
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:32.880]  just absolutely ridiculous uh all of that is going on and happening
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:37.520]  and then at the same time uh we have this latest big budget
[2:14:37.520 --> 2:14:42.640]  and i was reading it was funded by dubai uh our foreign country
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:46.080]  with this really shoddy hour-long special that spends a half of it on our
[2:14:46.080 --> 2:14:50.160]  psychology and they played all sorts of little uh tricks with the camera
[2:14:50.160 --> 2:14:53.840]  all sorts of things they did uh the way they always made it your opinion we
[2:14:53.840 --> 2:14:56.560]  talked sunday but i want you to recap and expand on that
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:14:59.280]  how you gave them all the evidence all the facts and they would never allow
[2:14:59.280 --> 2:15:03.040]  that to be shown in the show i mean really
[2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:06.160]  outrageous but i think it's backfiring on a minute was made by a famous
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:09.360]  production house that specializes just in hit pieces
[2:15:09.360 --> 2:15:12.720]  and a quote debunking conspiracy theorist i mean i think that they do
[2:15:12.720 --> 2:15:15.600]  piece after piece uh creative differences who i've
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:18.400]  refused to be interviewed by the jfk pc and i'm 11
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:22.160]  so uh break it down for us as an architect as an engineer who's built
[2:15:22.160 --> 2:15:25.520]  major structures who has 800 architects and engineers and thousands of other
[2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:27.760]  students who are becoming engineers and architects
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:32.560]  on your team but 800 plus and break it down as the founder of architects and
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:38.240]  engineers from love and truth well we've been speaking all across the country
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:43.600]  now for three three years um we we've had uh over 110
[2:15:43.600 --> 2:15:46.640]  presentations two thousand and thousands of people
[2:15:46.640 --> 2:15:52.080]  we've toured uh europe with with nine cities in europe
[2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:57.680]  and uh next month we're going to uh japan australia and new zealand
[2:15:57.680 --> 2:16:04.080]  or november and we're with the the who who the key senator senator yuki
[2:16:04.080 --> 2:16:07.680]  he should put each of uh who whose party just one
[2:16:07.680 --> 2:16:11.520]  uh the the took over their their government basically
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:17.920]  uh it was a minority party um his this this party is is transforming japan
[2:16:17.920 --> 2:16:20.240]  right now it's kind of like the revolution we had
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:24.000]  not really the change we had from the democrats to the republican
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.680]  excuse me republican democrats so he's bringing us to
[2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:31.280]  tokyo and kyoto he'll introduce us i mean this is a huge
[2:16:31.280 --> 2:16:36.000]  um opportunity uh for the 9-11 truth movement because he himself has been
[2:16:36.000 --> 2:16:40.720]  traveling around the world talking about 9-11 truth and so we're very excited
[2:16:40.720 --> 2:16:45.200]  to to speak in 14 different cities all together in japan australia and let me
[2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:50.000]  just throw a caveat in um as of a year ago when he first
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:52.720]  went public and we interviewed him here as well and he's since traveled to new
[2:16:52.720 --> 2:16:55.840]  york and other major cities of the world
[2:16:55.840 --> 2:17:03.920]  he was the number three person in his party in the diet now his party
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:07.200]  for after decades and decades out of power is now
[2:17:07.200 --> 2:17:11.520]  in power and as you said the president of his party is now the president of the
[2:17:11.520 --> 2:17:14.400]  country so we need to go look at the power structure
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:18.720]  but i believe he's number two now in the japanese government
[2:17:18.720 --> 2:17:23.600]  is a 9-11 truth or who shows clips and and clips of your films and clips of
[2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:29.280]  professor steven jones repeatedly in the diet in their congress i mean this and
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:31.920]  this is all over japanese tv they came and interviewed me
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:36.800]  many times uh but i mean this is incredible
[2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:41.600]  i'm excited about it too and we get to go there and be right in the middle of it
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:45.840]  learn a whole lot more about it in fact uh they're booking the diet
[2:17:45.840 --> 2:17:49.440]  itself the the governmental uh body
[2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:53.360]  the building we're going to be speaking there that's the that's the plan at this
[2:17:53.360 --> 2:17:57.200]  point not to their government uh but uh having
[2:17:57.200 --> 2:18:00.800]  having the public to come uh to to that place so
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:05.040]  unbelievable so that'd be like having a huge 9-11 truth investigation
[2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:08.400]  in the house or in the senate yeah yeah exactly
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:13.120]  i mean that's pretty exciting so we'll try to put something uh very special
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:18.480]  uh together for that um last night i i had the opportunity
[2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:25.280]  to speak to a packed house of 200 at the commonwealth club of california
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:29.200]  we webcast this live we had 435 people
[2:18:29.200 --> 2:18:35.200]  listening live uh also uh from home on their computers and i had uh
[2:18:35.200 --> 2:18:39.360]  40 minutes to present all of the evidence which by the way
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:44.560]  i had very carefully laid out before robert erickson of creative differences
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:48.080]  who was the producer for this national geographic
[2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:54.640]  uh entertainment piece we call it um uh that most that many people have had
[2:18:54.640 --> 2:18:59.120]  the opportunity to see and uh we'll be talking about uh
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:02.400]  how they go about uh distorting what we have to say
[2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:06.560]  and but it's very important that people understand
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:10.640]  that i spent an hour with him highlighting
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:14.240]  the evidence of the free fall acceleration
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:19.600]  of uh world trade centers seven uh you know and in the pools of molten
[2:19:19.600 --> 2:19:23.920]  iron that are found underneath it and the twin towers
[2:19:23.920 --> 2:19:27.520]  and uh all of this this evidence the massive
[2:19:27.520 --> 2:19:31.440]  expulsion of perimeter wall sections
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:35.600]  600 feet at 70 miles an hour instant acceleration out of the side of the

[2:25:58.560 --> 2:26:01.760]  what's going on this is not some kind of unconscious
[2:26:01.760 --> 2:26:06.160]  uh skepticism or something uh so so uh we go
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:09.520]  this is four months later we we're we're invited
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:14.080]  back because he wants to show us the rough cut
[2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:18.480]  uh because he has had criticism in the past where he felt
[2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:21.760]  uh he said people have uh thought that their
[2:26:21.760 --> 2:26:25.520]  their their interviews were taken out of context and so forth
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:30.880]  so he brings us back and he actually i'm well i'm watching myself in the rough
[2:26:30.880 --> 2:26:34.160]  cut with with all of this evidence and i'm delighted
[2:26:34.160 --> 2:26:37.040]  because he's you know we're talking about molten metal
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:42.560]  we're talking about nanothermite uh chips found in the dust very high tech stuff
[2:26:42.560 --> 2:26:45.680]  not made in a cave in afghanistan i think your next hour
[2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:50.320]  your next hour's guest uh steven jones will be talking in detail about that
[2:26:50.320 --> 2:26:53.920]  but uh i told him about the the the small
[2:26:53.920 --> 2:26:57.520]  more previously molten iron spheres the size of a human hair
[2:26:57.520 --> 2:27:01.440]  that are found in all the dust samples ignited thermite by chemical analysis
[2:27:01.440 --> 2:27:06.720]  anyway all this was in there and uh we're we're delighted
[2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:10.080]  right um and then he brings out these experiments
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:14.560]  uh that he's done emertek who's really nothing more than a
[2:27:14.560 --> 2:27:19.200]  uh a defense contractor at new mexico because they're
[2:27:19.200 --> 2:27:22.800]  they're they're like lorns livermore lab or something that all of their money
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:26.240]  comes from defense uh they're on the government payroll
[2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:30.480]  that's for sure and so they have these three experiments that they they never
[2:27:30.480 --> 2:27:33.680]  talked to us that what experiments they might be doing
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:39.120]  uh what they didn't get our input at all it's just we're just watching these
[2:27:39.120 --> 2:27:42.160]  experiments so they lure you back to see the rough cut
[2:27:42.160 --> 2:27:46.560]  and it's these experiments yeah then we see the rough cut we're delighted with
[2:27:46.560 --> 2:27:49.280]  what we said we were shown of ourselves and then
[2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:53.360]  these experiments come on and we're going what the heck is this because
[2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:57.360]  uh we're we're we're live either videotaping your response or like come
[2:27:57.360 --> 2:28:00.880]  see the rough cut now come in here we want to show you some other clips
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:03.840]  i mean is that how this happened and then really they're videotaping you
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:08.160]  yes and the intent was not that they were going to use our responses
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:13.360]  uh in the the final version the the the intent was that
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:18.000]  what did he say uh uh we we just want a record that you're happy with what you
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:20.880]  saw basically so this is a manipulation
[2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:24.880]  clearly and and i have to tell you these this
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:29.680]  thermite experiment for instance where they excuse me the the uh the beam
[2:28:29.680 --> 2:28:33.680]  where they put this eight inch uh tall eye beam uh
[2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:39.760]  across uh 500 gallons of jet fuel and light it and put a
[2:28:39.760 --> 2:28:45.760]  3 000 pound load in the middle of this eye beam and uh we have in in a couple
[2:28:45.760 --> 2:28:51.280]  of minutes uh temperatures uh rising uh very high and and causing
[2:28:51.280 --> 2:28:56.080]  the failure of this beam well it first of all have they talked to us
[2:28:56.080 --> 2:28:58.800]  and then even if they didn't talk to us they should have known
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:04.080]  that a NIST in their investigation hired underwriter laboratories
[2:29:04.080 --> 2:29:07.680]  to develop an exact replica of the floor
[2:29:07.680 --> 2:29:13.280]  trust system with this composite deck of concrete and metal decking
[2:29:13.280 --> 2:29:19.120]  uh and they they had under laboratory conditions ASTME 119
[2:29:19.120 --> 2:29:24.480]  um is the test number they put 2 000 degrees of fire under the trust
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:28.880]  and twice the known amount of loading on top of the floor system
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:32.160]  and stay there this is scientific i don't want to interrupt this yes the
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:34.480]  underwriting laboratories found it wouldn't happen
[2:29:34.480 --> 2:29:38.240]  but see one of their members goes public releasing their report they
[2:29:38.240 --> 2:29:42.240]  firing that's kevin ryan stay there we come right back with

[2:31:18.240 --> 2:31:21.200]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:31:21.200 --> 2:31:24.320]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[2:31:24.320 --> 2:31:27.760]  dangerously overloaded especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:31.360]  number four the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[2:31:31.360 --> 2:31:34.400]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:31:34.400 --> 2:31:37.600]  outages number five a solar power generator provides

[2:33:06.560 --> 2:33:13.360]  i was a highway man along the coach roads i did ride
[2:33:13.360 --> 2:33:18.400]  with sword and pistol by my side
[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:24.320]  many a young maid lost her bobbles to my trade

[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:35.520]  the master taught me in the spring of 25
[2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:41.840]  but i am still alive okay richard gauge architects and engineers from 911
[2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:45.360]  truth founder we got broken up by a couple
[2:33:45.360 --> 2:33:51.280]  breaks there recap what happened with the production company
[2:33:51.280 --> 2:33:54.720]  with the television piece that just aired last week
[2:33:54.720 --> 2:34:02.240]  on the national geographic channel and then conclude in summary exactly what
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:05.520]  you're saying here and then i have the question to ask
[2:34:05.520 --> 2:34:12.000]  after you're done okay um so we have missed hiring
[2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:15.760]  underwriter laboratories to create this mock section
[2:34:15.760 --> 2:34:18.960]  and they tested it according to very scientific
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:23.600]  uh... well time-honored tests and it did not fail
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:27.040]  they had three different versions of this thing it sagged only
[2:34:27.040 --> 2:34:31.840]  three inches it didn't fail uh... missed of course in turn through that test
[2:34:31.840 --> 2:34:35.120]  out and and claims a 42 inch sag by the way
[2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:40.160]  to justify their column failure theory uh... which they needed to uh...
[2:34:40.160 --> 2:34:45.440]  in order to get Larry Silverstein uh... his 5.68 billion dollars
[2:34:45.440 --> 2:34:51.840]  but the point is that uh... instead of doing something scientific like this
[2:34:51.840 --> 2:34:55.360]  uh... we have national geographic uh... robert erickson of creative
[2:34:55.360 --> 2:34:58.880]  differences hiring emertek at defense contractor
[2:34:58.880 --> 2:35:02.400]  to call it to show everybody theoretically
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:06.720]  how that how this uh... uh... this building
[2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:10.000]  obviously fell apart well first of all they don't have
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:13.920]  eight-inch i-beams uh... in the in the building they have four
[2:35:13.920 --> 2:35:16.800]  trusses uh... second and it which certainly doesn't
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:19.840]  relate to any other massive core columns in the building
[2:35:19.840 --> 2:35:23.840]  we didn't have 500 gallons of jet fuel sitting there
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:28.080]  underneath anything 90 percent of that jet fuel was expelled and exploded
[2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:31.280]  outside the building the rest burned up according to the official story in just
[2:35:31.280 --> 2:35:34.720]  10 minutes so all the jet fuel did was ignite a normal
[2:35:34.720 --> 2:35:39.600]  office fire whose temperatures don't get to be above 12 or 1400 degrees
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:42.800]  and even and even then there's no evidence for
[2:35:42.800 --> 2:35:47.440]  temperatures over five or 600 degrees in in the in the towers
[2:35:47.440 --> 2:35:51.360]  so this whole thing from start to finish is is just ludicrous and this by the way
[2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:55.040]  this i-beam is not interconnected with several other
[2:35:55.040 --> 2:35:59.520]  uh... beams like in a normal office building where the heat
[2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:03.600]  is conducted away from the heat source throughout the columns and beams in the
[2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:06.880]  building which is really the reason why we never have had
[2:36:06.880 --> 2:36:10.400]  a steel frame high-rise building collapsed due to fire
[2:36:10.400 --> 2:36:13.360]  because of this incredible uh... conduction ability
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:17.280]  and interconnecting this is a huge heat sink so
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:20.080]  this this this experiment and the other ones
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:23.840]  were set up to fail and and manipulate uh... the
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:28.320]  the american people into uh... thinking that they
[2:36:28.320 --> 2:36:31.680]  that this is science versus obviously these
[2:36:31.680 --> 2:36:35.280]  architects and engineers who are simply conspiracy theorists
[2:36:35.280 --> 2:36:38.800]  but uh... last night at the commonwealth club uh... we
[2:36:38.800 --> 2:36:42.000]  we carefully laid out all this evidence and he said okay
[2:36:42.000 --> 2:36:46.400]  at the end which side is conspiracy and which side is science so we have a
[2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:50.720]  show of hands guess what 90 percent of the 60 people
[2:36:50.720 --> 2:36:55.040]  who were either uh... believers in the official theory beforehand or who were
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:36:58.720]  unsure 90 percent of those 60 people
[2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:01.680]  uh... were convinced of the evidence for explosive
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:05.200]  okay to be clear you've got you've got 200 people
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:08.960]  at this meeting i guess you asked before who believes the official story who
[2:37:08.960 --> 2:37:11.440]  doesn't you're saying that's how you know with 60 people
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:14.960]  that's right okay so so so they raise
[2:37:14.960 --> 2:37:18.640]  their hands 60 saying i believe the official story that 19 guys
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:22.720]  coordinated from caves in afghanistan did this okay great
[2:37:22.720 --> 2:37:26.560]  uh... and then at the end of it you're saying 90 percent of those 60 people
[2:37:26.560 --> 2:37:30.560]  now believe the engineering now believe uh... your information
[2:37:30.560 --> 2:37:33.760]  yes and the numbers are 20 and 40 so that there's 20 people believing the
[2:37:33.760 --> 2:37:38.800]  official story before forty who were unsure but 90 percent of those
[2:37:38.800 --> 2:37:43.440]  uh... totaling 60 uh... believed in the explosive control demolition theory
[2:37:43.440 --> 2:37:46.640]  afterward and it's like that at every presentation alex
[2:37:46.640 --> 2:37:50.480]  90 and you get most of these presentations correct me if i'm wrong
[2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:56.240]  two architects and engineer groups well i i not mostly no we do visit local
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:38:00.000]  architecture and engineering groups and generally that's what i mean you said
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:01.840]  you've made a whole mission out of
[2:38:01.840 --> 2:38:05.280]  yeah i mean how many architects and engineer groups have you talked to
[2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:08.160]  um... there's been a bit about a dozen now
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:10.960]  okay well what what happens when you go to those
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:14.320]  oh it's fascinating because uh... you get people who
[2:38:14.320 --> 2:38:18.800]  first of all most of them know nothing about uh... the third worst structural
[2:38:18.800 --> 2:38:23.360]  failure in modern history building seven forty seven story skyscraper collapses
[2:38:23.360 --> 2:38:27.760]  to its own uh... in its own footprint in six and a half seconds in their jaws
[2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:32.400]  to rock and by the way nist had always said freefall didn't happen
[2:38:32.400 --> 2:38:36.160]  but then they were forced now to go ahead and say okay there was freefall
[2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:38.640]  involved and they've given five six different stories
[2:38:38.640 --> 2:38:42.720]  and had to recant their previous reasons the building seven collapsed
[2:38:42.720 --> 2:38:45.760]  in their own nist reports i'd like you to speak to that and
[2:38:45.760 --> 2:38:49.440]  uh... even national geographic on the eve of
[2:38:49.440 --> 2:38:53.840]  this newest hit piece said oh our last reasons for the towers collapsing with
[2:38:53.840 --> 2:38:57.200]  pancake we were wrong about that but now we've got a new idea
[2:38:57.200 --> 2:39:00.240]  so they're they're the one because they say in the piece their stories never
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:02.240]  changed the government stories never changed
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:05.440]  but in truth their story continually changes oh yeah
[2:39:05.440 --> 2:39:09.600]  yeah it's it's always changing in fact that they wouldn't have changed if it
[2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:13.360]  weren't for uh... members of a you know in the truth uh... david chandler a
[2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:14.320]  physicist
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:18.640]  uh... and even jones calling them publicly on their on their press conference
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:22.400]  and they and they had to they were forced into a corner
[2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:25.440]  now they have to admit that the hundred feet of this building
[2:39:25.440 --> 2:39:30.080]  it's dropped i was in freefall that's crushing forty thousand tons of
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:34.560]  structural steel at the same rate that a brick is falling off the building
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:38.560]  uh... it yet you can't happen it and everybody knows that in every architect
[2:39:38.560 --> 2:39:42.320]  engineer we talk to knows that so they end up signing our petition saying yeah
[2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:45.520]  let's get a real investigation i don't want to go back for a moment and we'll
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:48.480]  continue going over this debunking them
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:51.600]  the maker of the television show who i've talked to on the phone he's always
[2:39:51.600 --> 2:39:54.640]  trying to get me involved in these shows or several shows and jfk
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:39:57.840]  in a nine eleven and i tell this production company no
[2:39:57.840 --> 2:40:01.360]  i know you're deceptive you're known as the most manipulative out there
[2:40:01.360 --> 2:40:04.720]  that this is your special and the guy laughs i'm your friend no
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:08.720]  i want to show your side in the jfk thing comes out it's a total fraud
[2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:12.800]  the the most skewed to the official story i've ever seen
[2:40:12.800 --> 2:40:17.120]  and so that's why when i was warning us and richard this is you know months ago
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:20.240]  uh... when you're doing the interviews i said this is not a friendly piece you
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:23.440]  said no he's listening he says it's going to be in there he promises
[2:40:23.440 --> 2:40:28.560]  have you talked to him which you now say that you know that you clearly
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:31.840]  that he lied to you the question here is you're going to put a public statement
[2:40:31.840 --> 2:40:37.040]  out on him are you going to have you called him have you talked to him
[2:40:37.040 --> 2:40:42.240]  um... he interestingly enough he has sent us uh... the transcript of for both of
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:46.720]  these interviews so we have it's clear uh... that we have uh...
[2:40:46.720 --> 2:40:52.080]  the evidence that uh... that he had all of the evidence and we have to post that
[2:40:52.080 --> 2:40:56.000]  you need to post that post that i think i post the whole transcript really he'll
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:57.120]  claim you edited it
[2:40:57.120 --> 2:41:00.800]  i would post that and then everybody write about it to show he's going oh i
[2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:02.240]  promise this will be in there
[2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:05.200]  oh oh yeah i mean just unbelievable
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:08.320]  totally and we were going to put that out then
[2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:12.640]  well we'll get it out within a week it's good good well
[2:41:12.640 --> 2:41:15.520]  i'm going to be in new york for the whole next week by the way will be a
[2:41:15.520 --> 2:41:19.280]  ground zero uh... you'll hopefully you'll be there uh... the morning
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:22.480]  unfortunately i can't i've got a bunch of stuff i'm working on here with the
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:27.440]  charlie seen uh... uh... yeah yeah well i'll take your place alex i'll be out
[2:41:27.440 --> 2:41:31.440]  there uh... talking to people they'll be a lot of cameras you're a great leader
[2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:35.120]  in this fight and yeah i know i'm finishing my film fall the republic
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:40.960]  in the next week and a half and i am working on just just absolutely
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:43.520]  piles of work but i'd love to be there with you
[2:41:43.520 --> 2:41:47.200]  uh... well i'll be at the two conferences there that we demand transparency
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:50.320]  conference at uh... saint marxon with the bowery of it
[2:41:50.320 --> 2:41:54.240]  twat the eleventh of the twelfth and then real change conference the eleventh
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:58.080]  of the twelfth also uh... lucricosky so we are changed
[2:41:58.080 --> 2:42:01.120]  group is having some some great speakers as well
[2:42:01.120 --> 2:42:05.680]  so i'm going to encourage everybody to come out to new york who can and and
[2:42:05.680 --> 2:42:09.200]  and support us and support these uh... incredible
[2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:14.080]  uh... truth or so who who have uh... given so much to wake up the american
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:17.520]  people well they have now run through some other bullet points
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:19.520]  uh...
[2:42:19.520 --> 2:42:23.440]  i mean you you were trying to break also getting into underwriting laboratories
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:26.960]  has this internal report where in the underwriting they tested
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:30.320]  fire making the building fall it had to be a special building is fema
[2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:33.680]  and the command centers were there they wouldn't even added more strength
[2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:36.760]  the super building cia defense intelligence
[2:42:36.760 --> 2:42:38.760]  irs army
[2:42:38.760 --> 2:42:43.040]  fb i'm you know that the whole things that you the second biggest cia compound
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:45.760]  outside lately in the u.s. they admit
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:48.600]  and then magically it falls in its own footprint
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:51.120]  you brought that information about underwriting laboratories to but they
[2:42:51.120 --> 2:42:52.400]  don't care they went and got a
[2:42:52.400 --> 2:42:54.240]  steel of unknown strength
[2:42:54.240 --> 2:42:55.200]  an alloy
[2:42:55.200 --> 2:42:56.800]  put a big weight over it
[2:42:56.800 --> 2:42:59.920]  with the white tips of the flame the very hottest part
[2:42:59.920 --> 2:43:01.920]  hitting on it long-wise
[2:43:01.920 --> 2:43:04.360]  uh... just amazing
[2:43:04.360 --> 2:43:09.640]  and and uh... obviously it's it's it's going to fail with three thousand pound
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:13.080]  point load right in the center span of the beam
[2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:16.360]  it's it's designed to fail it's designed to show
[2:43:16.360 --> 2:43:20.440]  so when it does fail i can imagine half of the public watching
[2:43:20.440 --> 2:43:23.920]  goes all of that's what happened to the world trade center site i see it
[2:43:23.920 --> 2:43:24.680]  failing
[2:43:24.680 --> 2:43:25.600]  it's like sheep
[2:43:25.600 --> 2:43:28.360]  you know but the fires and almost completely burned out there were
[2:43:28.360 --> 2:43:29.880]  people in the holes
[2:43:29.880 --> 2:43:32.880]  waving for help seconds before they just shatter
[2:43:32.880 --> 2:43:34.200]  and the building is just
[2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:36.760]  you know just it's it's it's it's unbelievable
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:40.120]  yeah and it's like watching a volcano explode and saying there was no pressure
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:41.360]  underneath it
[2:43:41.360 --> 2:43:42.640]  it
[2:43:42.640 --> 2:43:44.800]  and in the in the south tower uh... it
[2:43:44.800 --> 2:43:49.240]  if the fires were going out uh... after all the fifty-six minutes and according
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:52.280]  to the fire department according to the fire department
[2:43:52.280 --> 2:43:55.760]  yeah well i don't know if i would reach the seventy-eightth war he says there's
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:43:57.600]  two isolated pockets of fire
[2:43:57.600 --> 2:43:59.480]  we can put it out with two lines
[2:43:59.480 --> 2:44:01.320]  and uh... ten minutes later
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:06.040]  uh... the the uh... the the uh... hundred first responders are witnessing
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:10.840]  and documenting in their oral recording sounds of explosions and flashes of light
[2:44:10.840 --> 2:44:12.120]  at the onset
[2:44:12.120 --> 2:44:15.000]  of the collapses like a belt wrapping all the way up
[2:44:15.000 --> 2:44:20.040]  round the building was as if they had detonators boom boom boom boom boom
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:21.480]  yeah that's a quote
[2:44:21.480 --> 2:44:23.040]  uh... from the firemen
[2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:27.240]  and uh... and and and and we have news reporters on the ground two thousand
[2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:29.040]  feet away from this
[2:44:29.040 --> 2:44:29.840]  bucking
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:34.320]  uh... uh... from from the incredible sound of explosions
[2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:35.640]  which we don't hear
[2:44:35.640 --> 2:44:38.360]  uh... on any of the of the report
[2:44:38.360 --> 2:44:39.880]  uh... they they they
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:42.760]  the systematically take out the sounds of explosions
[2:44:42.760 --> 2:44:44.640]  but there's uh... there's uh...
[2:44:44.640 --> 2:44:48.920]  uh... well over a couple hundred uh... what witnesses talking about these
[2:44:48.920 --> 2:44:51.400]  incredible explosions and then
[2:44:51.400 --> 2:44:55.640]  debris flying everywhere out of the sides of the twin towers
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:44:59.360]  uh... dimension six hundred feet of flying laterally
[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:02.560]  uh... fifty fifty seventy miles an hour
[2:45:02.560 --> 2:45:06.720]  and and and so we would wait with this is a gravitational collapse we would
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:07.920]  expect to see
[2:45:07.920 --> 2:45:10.040]  a hundred and ten floors
[2:45:10.040 --> 2:45:12.880]  stacked up at the bottom of each of these buildings
[2:45:12.880 --> 2:45:15.960]  that's how many floors we see at the bottom
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:17.800]  and the photograph the video
[2:45:17.800 --> 2:45:18.560]  none
[2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:21.120]  they are they are going to have been pulverized
[2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:25.320]  and and distributed laterally outside the building footprint
[2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:28.560]  this is supposed to be a gravitational collapse we should have twenty to forty
[2:45:28.560 --> 2:45:29.640]  stories high
[2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:31.560]  of floors sitting down there
[2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:32.720]  where are they
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:33.840]  they're going
[2:45:33.840 --> 2:45:39.200]  uh... so this is a huge problem for the official story as well
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:41.240]  continuum
[2:45:41.240 --> 2:45:45.560]  what uh... so i i explained very carefully that national geographic what
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:46.800]  people found
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:48.680]  and what people documented
[2:45:48.680 --> 2:45:52.160]  in their picnic c of their mayor two thousand and two
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:53.400]  deep at report
[2:45:53.400 --> 2:45:57.920]  it steel to steal samples by the way the only to steal samples
[2:45:57.920 --> 2:46:00.480]  paid from building seven
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:04.600]  but these two steel samples they document intergranular melting rapid
[2:46:04.600 --> 2:46:05.800]  oxidation
[2:46:05.800 --> 2:46:10.040]  self-fidation and even evaporation of the end of these being
[2:46:10.040 --> 2:46:12.680]  with a bit by what i've never seen this before
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:14.520]  so what how did this happen and
[2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:16.360]  and so they they conclude
[2:46:16.360 --> 2:46:17.120]  femur
[2:46:17.120 --> 2:46:21.440]  that that their best hypothesis is that how this building came down
[2:46:21.440 --> 2:46:24.960]  is uh... has only a low probability of a current
[2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:26.680]  well what's a hypothesis
[2:46:26.680 --> 2:46:31.080]  fire and some damage from the beams of the world trade center north power when
[2:46:31.080 --> 2:46:33.440]  it went down earlier that morning
[2:46:33.440 --> 2:46:35.920]  so what happens to this entire
[2:46:35.920 --> 2:46:39.120]  all the further research investigation is necessary
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:40.120]  but uh...
[2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:43.640]  unfortunately though for those hoping to resolve the issue
[2:46:43.640 --> 2:46:48.600]  all that's the other than recycled to to china and that they may have
[2:46:48.600 --> 2:46:51.800]  uh... ordered the recycling of that deal
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:53.400]  they deny this but uh...
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:57.360]  those uh... who do do this research uh... end up
[2:46:57.360 --> 2:47:00.440]  citing femur for it for giving these orders
[2:47:00.440 --> 2:47:04.400]  uh... so they didn't save the deal you always save the deal in any kind of a
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:05.320]  collapse you could
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:07.960]  thoroughly understand exactly what happened
[2:47:07.960 --> 2:47:11.680]  now this takes over the investigation after may of two thousand two
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:13.320]  what did they do
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:14.840]  with this appendix
[2:47:14.840 --> 2:47:15.480]  c
[2:47:15.480 --> 2:47:17.960]  documenting the melting of steel
[2:47:17.960 --> 2:47:19.120]  they throw it out
[2:47:19.120 --> 2:47:21.280]  it is not in the final report
[2:47:21.280 --> 2:47:22.240]  at all
[2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:24.600]  uh... in the world trade center seven that came out
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:27.200]  uh... in november stuff just last year
[2:47:27.200 --> 2:47:29.320]  seven years later
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:30.160]  they've
[2:47:30.160 --> 2:47:34.680]  basically uh... systematically destroyed even more evidence
[2:47:34.680 --> 2:47:37.800]  uh... they do not want us to know about molten metal
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:41.120]  or melting of steel in fact john gross denies
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:42.760]  both pools of molten
[2:47:42.760 --> 2:47:44.640]  iron and it turns out to be
[2:47:44.640 --> 2:47:48.440]  even jones and others analyze it turned out to be one of the videos of the
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:50.760]  firefighters saying it was like a
[2:47:50.760 --> 2:47:54.200]  foundry with molten metal running everywhere we could play the clubs but
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:47:55.760]  they're cussing including
[2:47:55.760 --> 2:47:57.240]  fire captains
[2:47:57.240 --> 2:48:00.800]  uh... but i mean it was just everywhere
[2:48:00.800 --> 2:48:05.080]  yeah yeah it was and it doesn't have a lot of witnesses both of photographs
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:06.120]  there's uh...
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:09.000]  it's all in my film terror storm a history of government
[2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:12.120]  sponsor terrorism the people really didn't fall wars dot com goes to the
[2:48:12.120 --> 2:48:13.480]  whole history of this
[2:48:13.480 --> 2:48:16.320]  in the modern events and that's how you really like somebody up i understand
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:18.080]  you're an engineer you're an architect
[2:48:18.080 --> 2:48:20.040]  that's an important area of research
[2:48:20.040 --> 2:48:23.560]  but i don't think i would be very impressed by terror storm
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:26.920]  there's a very important point is that though there's the other angle where we
[2:48:26.920 --> 2:48:29.020]  also the science and we'll thank you richard
[2:48:29.020 --> 2:48:32.720]  we go at the history of it that they've done this over and over again and that
[2:48:32.720 --> 2:48:34.040]  helps people
[2:48:34.040 --> 2:48:35.400]  get passed
[2:48:35.400 --> 2:48:38.680]  not imagining that government would do this government isn't like the rest of
[2:48:38.680 --> 2:48:40.600]  people i'm sorry go ahead
[2:48:40.600 --> 2:48:45.000]  yeah it's disturbing because you know all of this evidence uh... is is clear as i
[2:48:45.000 --> 2:48:47.880]  mentioned to ninety percent of the people i talked to
[2:48:47.880 --> 2:48:50.960]  they end up uh... agreeing with us in finding a petition
[2:48:50.960 --> 2:48:53.200]  but they say well what do we do now
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:55.120]  you know and i'm going well

[3:00:43.160 --> 3:00:46.880]  Hitler used stage terror to get control Stalin and Lenin did it to expand
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:52.000]  control Mao did it the Zars did it so many other governments do it and the
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:56.200]  criminals running our nation are doing it and people need to face those facts
[3:00:56.200 --> 3:01:00.120]  and demand the truth Professor Stephen Jones is gonna be coming on this about
[3:01:00.120 --> 3:01:03.720]  30 35 minutes and I am gonna hit all this World Bank World government news let
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:06.680]  me just hit on some of it now but I want to be honest I want to dig into my
[3:01:06.680 --> 3:01:12.520]  stack from yesterday that was taken off my table which is good the guys clean up
[3:01:12.520 --> 3:01:17.880]  my pigsty in here it's really messy but I had a bunch of articles in my stack oh
[3:01:17.880 --> 3:01:23.320]  here's yesterday's stack where they're openly announcing Argentine style
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:32.520]  collapse for the United States and where all of this is coming out and so I'm
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:35.680]  gonna go over that and when when Professor Jones leaves us I'm gonna
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:43.840]  cover that in in great detail but I mean here's one from today a year after
[3:01:43.840 --> 3:01:47.880]  financial crisis a new world order emerges and then here's another one
[3:01:47.880 --> 3:01:51.640]  Obama to seal US you in relationship the first US president to be a president
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:56.400]  and the head of the International Security Council and he's also the head
[3:01:56.400 --> 3:01:59.740]  of the National Security Council here that runs the FEMA camps homeland
[3:01:59.740 --> 3:02:02.560]  security the 400,000 troops the army openly says they're gonna put on the
[3:02:02.560 --> 3:02:06.800]  streets of America they're doing acclimation drills everywhere running
[3:02:06.800 --> 3:02:10.480]  checkpoints for PR things that they think the public will buy helping people
[3:02:10.480 --> 3:02:15.400]  at car wrecks with the jaws of life searching people for alcohol and drugs
[3:02:15.400 --> 3:02:20.640]  totally illegal regular army regular Marines confirmed I mean the
[3:02:20.640 --> 3:02:23.840]  establishment really wants to take over so they can loot and rob the country it's
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:27.440]  like when a bank robber comes in says hands up tells the security guard drop
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:30.840]  your gun put your hands up I mean they want our guns they're saying hands up
[3:02:30.840 --> 3:02:33.480]  they've introduced the bills to do it they they're saying hands up with the
[3:02:33.480 --> 3:02:38.880]  army the good news is the army's full of a lot of good awake people in many
[3:02:38.880 --> 3:02:41.320]  respects though they're hiring a lot of illegal aliens and foreigners and
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:45.120]  criminals now that's pretty scary it's kind of like what the government did
[3:02:45.120 --> 3:02:48.960]  ship it in the drugs in the 70s and 80s in Miami I was watching a documentary
[3:02:48.960 --> 3:02:54.440]  cocaine cowboys about that jogging on the treadmill this morning and it had
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:02:57.480]  everything already knew but there it was in video with the police saying and
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:04.760]  admitting it and because of the crime way they then got rid of all the rules
[3:03:04.760 --> 3:03:10.280]  police could be drug users and be on the force and police then it turned out it
[3:03:10.280 --> 3:03:14.520]  said a whole new the entire new class got killed or went to prison it's the
[3:03:14.520 --> 3:03:19.040]  program shows cops saying the entire new class I think I said of like 1980 81 I
[3:03:19.040 --> 3:03:24.160]  forget in the film all died or went to prison they were all dealing drugs of
[3:03:24.160 --> 3:03:29.000]  course you mean it's a $500 billion a year industry in the US alone and you
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:33.640]  can launder that money so it has that multiple value of the fact that they
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:36.640]  can launder it and the banks can loan out 10 times every dollar they've got
[3:03:36.640 --> 3:03:41.600]  and then the BBC just calmly admits the US is guarding the poppy fields but so
[3:03:41.600 --> 3:03:47.960]  the Taliban doesn't get it and then you see opium production go up 10 11 12 fold
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:51.360]  last time I checked from the liberation of Afghanistan it's about
[3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:56.880]  controlling opium which is another 500 billion globally produces over 80% of
[3:03:56.880 --> 3:04:01.600]  the world's opium it's turned into heroin so it's just pouring out of there
[3:04:01.600 --> 3:04:08.840]  and then I hear local police one local cops got a radio show and he's a nice
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:12.080]  guy I've met him but he gets on air and says I just can't believe that officers
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:15.040]  would deal drugs I can't believe the government would deal drugs what are you
[3:04:15.040 --> 3:04:20.560]  talking about serpico all of it LAPD I mean how many times have the police
[3:04:20.560 --> 3:04:25.160]  and the government the CIA how many times of CIA aircraft crashed full of
[3:04:25.160 --> 3:04:29.640]  cocaine and heroin and they put people in jail if they get caught using it I
[3:04:29.640 --> 3:04:33.960]  mean it's a sick joke we have to admit the government ships in the drugs we
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:37.120]  have to admit they're staging the terror so they can then set up the police
[3:04:37.120 --> 3:04:40.200]  state and they got the military involved in the war on drugs now they're gonna
[3:04:40.200 --> 3:04:43.080]  use the military on the American people they got the military involved in
[3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:46.480]  fighting al Qaeda now they say oh homeland security document that we broke
[3:04:46.480 --> 3:04:50.200]  says we're gonna use the army against you and then we get sent secret
[3:04:50.200 --> 3:04:54.160]  documents and they break in mainstream news where the army is watching me Ron
[3:04:54.160 --> 3:04:59.520]  Paul and others I mean we the army is watching me what for I'm calling for
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:04.640]  peaceful liberation the illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers

[3:08:45.960 --> 3:08:49.880]  they're they're they're so incredibly important one of them is a color blue
[3:08:49.880 --> 3:08:54.000]  this is just an amazingly high-quality atmospheric water generator well they
[3:08:54.000 --> 3:08:56.240]  got a whole line of them they've got huge ones they sell to governments and
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:08:59.280]  militaries they have a small one for the home looks like a water cooler without
[3:08:59.280 --> 3:09:05.520]  the water bottle on top of it it grabs water out of the air from panels in the
[3:09:05.520 --> 3:09:08.920]  back puts it through seven filters including reverse osmosis and carbon
[3:09:08.920 --> 3:09:15.440]  and then as a UV anti bacteria light in the stainless steel tank inside the

[3:09:20.240 --> 3:09:23.160]  panels they sell a converter that goes with it that works just for their

[3:09:47.560 --> 3:09:56.080]  generator for your home or office going now to professor Stephen Jones who
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:02.040]  four years ago now how time flies went public Stephen Jones a retired professor
[3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:05.480]  of physics has published papers in scientific American nature and physical
[3:10:05.480 --> 3:10:10.280]  review letters his peer review papers on the collapse of the world trade center
[3:10:10.280 --> 3:10:15.400]  towers all three of them when only two were hit by airplanes is being widely
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:18.720]  read and has been translated into Spanish French and Japanese it's available
[3:10:18.720 --> 3:10:22.840]  of the journal of 911 studies dot com along with 26 other scholarly letters
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:28.120]  regarding the events of 911 2001 his ongoing research includes experiments
[3:10:28.120 --> 3:10:36.480]  with thermites along with electron microscope energy spectrometric analysis
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:41.560]  of dust and slag from the WTC and we really appreciate him coming on he's
[3:10:41.560 --> 3:10:46.200]  here today to debunk the debunkers who lied to Gage and said oh we're going to
[3:10:46.200 --> 3:10:49.960]  show you talking about this evidence showed him a rough cut and said this
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:54.120]  will be in the show they have transcripts of that now proving it they gave
[3:10:54.120 --> 3:10:58.120]  them the transcripts this same group is known for doing hit pieces on quote
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:02.320]  conspiracy theorists their specialty creative differences is the name and they
[3:11:02.320 --> 3:11:05.800]  also did this ridiculous thermite I mean I've seen thermite test when they put a
[3:11:05.800 --> 3:11:09.560]  cup of it over on an engine block and it melts right through in seconds I've
[3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:14.200]  seen but this thermite barely even sparked but just for a few seconds
[3:11:14.200 --> 3:11:19.200]  saying there were hundreds of pounds on it I mean ladies and gentlemen and then
[3:11:19.200 --> 3:11:24.000]  they acted like explosive thermite didn't exist mega nano thermite super
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:27.360]  thermite I mean this was crazy when we have all the patents and the rest of it
[3:11:27.360 --> 3:11:30.200]  so I wanted to get professor Stephen Jones on with this professor it's great
[3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:36.840]  to have you thanks Alex it's great to be with you again here today okay briefly
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:39.880]  recap most people know who you are but for those that don't how you got into
[3:11:39.880 --> 3:11:44.320]  this and then let's get into thermite thermate the different samples what it
[3:11:44.320 --> 3:11:47.880]  shows how it fits with the NIST report fits with the firefighter testimony
[3:11:47.880 --> 3:11:54.680]  break it down sir okay sure well to begin let me start with the journal of 9-1-1
[3:11:54.680 --> 3:12:01.200]  studies that you mentioned we now have over 100 papers and letters so the list
[3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:06.440]  has grown dramatically these are all peer reviewed and I encourage people to go
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:11.360]  there of course we also have the papers that you mentioned in more established
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:17.600]  scientific journal technical journal civil engineering journal and of course
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:22.520]  the open chemical physics journal has our latest paper with Anil Perot Jeff
[3:12:22.520 --> 3:12:34.280]  Farrah myself and but total of nine authors I think and so let's see my
[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:38.880]  other phone was ringing Alex sorry that's okay sir go ahead but so yeah it's
[3:12:38.880 --> 3:12:43.840]  been it's been quite a quite an adventure trying to explain to people the
[3:12:43.840 --> 3:12:50.600]  difference between nano-thermite or super-thermite same thing there compared
[3:12:50.600 --> 3:12:56.600]  to ordinary macro-thermite and I'll say I explained that very carefully to the
[3:12:56.600 --> 3:13:03.040]  National Geographic people and they did get some of that straight but you just
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:08.600]  couldn't seem to bring it to admit that you know here's a form of
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:13.440]  thermite this nano-thermite that's distinctly different from ordinary
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:19.600]  thermite and the nano-thermite is explosive and be tailored to be a high
[3:13:19.600 --> 3:13:25.040]  explosive and they just they just didn't do it and then of course this test they
[3:13:25.040 --> 3:13:28.840]  did you mentioned that where they piled up ordinary thermite they didn't even
[3:13:28.840 --> 3:13:32.640]  put sulfur in it that would have been interesting if they'd done at least that
[3:13:32.640 --> 3:13:37.480]  which I talked about in my in my first paper and you know you and I talked about
[3:13:37.480 --> 3:13:43.320]  thermite which is the sulfur added to thermite at some length
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:48.240]  playing the difference but of course the sulfur observed in samples of World
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:53.160]  Trade Center steel observed by the guys at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
[3:13:53.160 --> 3:13:59.920]  published that great mystery New York Times said how did the sulfur get in the
[3:13:59.920 --> 3:14:06.440]  steel sorry clear my throat a little here but yeah so they didn't even add
[3:14:06.440 --> 3:14:11.720]  sulfur and of course they didn't test nano-thermite at all and they kept
[3:14:11.720 --> 3:14:18.600]  saying I just was reviewing that this morning the Nat Geo program and they
[3:14:18.600 --> 3:14:23.640]  kept saying well thermite is not explosive will not explode well excuse
[3:14:23.640 --> 3:14:30.640]  me there is a form called nano-thermite that will explode and so you know they
[3:14:30.640 --> 3:14:36.560]  just totally obfuscated that important point and you know I kept hammering
[3:14:36.560 --> 3:14:43.040]  that they did quote me on that in that program briefly but of course their test
[3:14:43.040 --> 3:14:49.880]  had nothing to do with what with what we're talking about in the nano-thermite
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:55.280]  paper nothing whatsoever no correlation at all and I told them I was really upset
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:15:01.160]  when I heard about that in March that they're proposing this well we're not
[3:15:01.160 --> 3:15:07.080]  proposing it already done the experiment I called it pathetic I said this in no
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:12.440]  right way represents my views to stack up a bunch of ordinary thermite around a
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:17.600]  steel column I never said anything like that we're talking about nano-thermite
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:22.720]  in this paper and thermate which is sulfur added to thermite it looks like
[3:15:22.720 --> 3:15:27.760]  that was also present good evidence for that with the sulfur in the World Trade
[3:15:27.760 --> 3:15:32.560]  Center steel sample but to do it with ordinary thermite and the way they did
[3:15:32.560 --> 3:15:39.040]  it is just a ludicrous and of course I told them it's a strong and argument
[3:15:39.040 --> 3:15:44.840]  it's not it supposedly represents my views but in no way comes close to what
[3:15:44.840 --> 3:15:51.720]  I have stated well I want to get into the science with you professor today but
[3:15:51.720 --> 3:15:57.640]  first did they hold out in a dishonest way to you and the way Richard Gage who
[3:15:57.640 --> 3:16:01.000]  I think has the highest credibility I mean he doesn't like to get in fights
[3:16:01.000 --> 3:16:04.400]  doesn't like to be nasty he puts up with a lot of crap he's a genteel person
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:09.520]  scholarly like yourself but I mean he said this was a complete lie a complete
[3:16:09.520 --> 3:16:15.680]  deception a complete fraud well you know I think that there's certainly some
[3:16:15.680 --> 3:16:23.120]  elements there that I would have to say that Nat Geo was disingenuous I mean I
[3:16:23.120 --> 3:16:29.920]  said look NIST just can't seem to admit that there is a form of thermite
[3:16:29.920 --> 3:16:36.240]  nano-thermite that is explosive I hope you can get that straight and tell the
[3:16:36.240 --> 3:16:41.160]  the fact is what we're claiming now is nano-thermite with the main culprit
[3:16:41.160 --> 3:16:44.680]  here oh yeah they say repeatedly they don't even know that exists even though
[3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:50.240]  you have all the patents and NASA uses it missile separation I mean it's just so
[3:16:50.240 --> 3:16:52.960]  happens the Pentagon has a lot of your and then there's scientists just so
[3:16:52.960 --> 3:16:56.280]  happen to have those patents and you got a bunch of NIST experts that are the few
[3:16:56.280 --> 3:17:00.560]  in the world on it but no big deal and you know there's data published as we
[3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:06.360]  quoted in our nano-thermite paper we published from you know livermore
[3:17:06.360 --> 3:17:13.080]  National Laboratory for example Tillerson and Gash and those scientists and you
[3:17:13.080 --> 3:17:16.400]  know they're publishing their data and we compared our data with theirs for the
[3:17:16.400 --> 3:17:22.160]  differential scanning calorimeter for example the composition the same as
[3:17:22.160 --> 3:17:28.800]  theirs I mean you know what the as you mentioned the very ultra fine iron and
[3:17:28.800 --> 3:17:34.800]  aluminum this is not something that happens to the building falls down to
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:41.360]  get this complex mix of ultra ultra fine this is very exotic and from sample
[3:17:41.360 --> 3:17:46.240]  after sample after sample you find the same signature that's exactly right and
[3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:52.040]  so for them to obscure all that particularly after my actually I was
[3:17:52.040 --> 3:17:59.680]  I was just pleading with Robert Erickson to please get this straight NIST can't
[3:17:59.680 --> 3:18:04.320]  seem to admit it but surely you can't but there's a difference between
[3:18:04.320 --> 3:18:10.520]  incendiary thermite and explosive nano-thermite as it is between night and
[3:18:10.520 --> 3:18:17.480]  day you know and and sure enough they obscured it again and so yes I must say
[3:18:17.480 --> 3:18:22.640]  that does seem disingenuous to me I don't see how you can say it otherwise
[3:18:22.640 --> 3:18:26.400]  well I know you don't get into the Pentagon but firing missiles into
[3:18:26.400 --> 3:18:29.560]  fiberglass chicken cubes and I recognize that's what it looked like out of a
[3:18:29.560 --> 3:18:33.880]  farm supply the fiberglass little thin thing and blowing it up with a pound of
[3:18:33.880 --> 3:18:37.080]  plastic explosive and saying a missile would have blown the whole Pentagon up
[3:18:37.080 --> 3:18:40.600]  I mean this was yeah this was just I mean I was watching this and I couldn't
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:46.160]  believe it and they would go the science the truth there's and they would like
[3:18:46.160 --> 3:18:51.200]  off the page have it all crooked the word truth or even on your name tags to
[3:18:51.200 --> 3:18:55.360]  make you look right and they wouldn't have the camera shots as nice with you
[3:18:55.360 --> 3:18:59.080]  guys but then when they're experts they would I mean it was um I mean but we had
[3:18:59.080 --> 3:19:03.840]  history channel do this to us yeah they would do stuff like I would give a
[3:19:03.840 --> 3:19:08.880]  speech to a standalone crowd of 600 people yep and then they're in a recess
[3:19:08.880 --> 3:19:11.640]  here in Austin when they shot that they would just show the bleachers while I
[3:19:11.640 --> 3:19:15.400]  was talking with like three people in them yeah and I mean just and I mean
[3:19:15.400 --> 3:19:20.040]  everybody we had LA with 1200 everywhere we go it's a standing room only every
[3:19:20.040 --> 3:19:23.760]  movie I've ever shown has been sold out I mean I don't know what they're but
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:30.120]  again they use sophomoric psychology of look he's not popular that's what
[3:19:30.120 --> 3:19:34.200]  psychology today did they said Alex had no fruit you know basically Alex says he
[3:19:34.200 --> 3:19:37.200]  had friends but we couldn't prove it Alex said he has a good family life but
[3:19:37.200 --> 3:19:41.440]  he wouldn't let us talk to his family you know when I have a great family life
[3:19:41.440 --> 3:19:46.560]  and great friends in great high school it's a little too wild it was a little
[3:19:46.560 --> 3:19:52.880]  too fun you know but I mean again it's meant to sell the idea that we're like
[3:19:52.880 --> 3:19:57.360]  these outcast cooks when we are the majority professor Stephen Jones stay
[3:19:57.360 --> 3:20:00.640]  with us we'll be right back after this quick break

[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:12.960]  we knew what to do at least we thought we did truth rising is a breakthrough 911
[3:22:12.960 --> 3:22:17.280]  film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story
[3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:26.160]  Whitman EBA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to
[3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:30.560]  breathe this film follows the growing momentum of 911 truth as brave souls
[3:22:30.560 --> 3:22:34.680]  throughout the world take action against their global masters he had his hand
[3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:38.280]  over the radio while he was getting a countdown he takes his hand off and you

[3:23:02.580 --> 3:23:07.040]  know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in
[3:23:07.040 --> 3:23:11.280]  maintaining high energy and vibrant health most experts agree that the water
[3:23:11.280 --> 3:23:15.800]  you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher alcovision plasma pH drops
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:20.800]  combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals using plasma pH drops
[3:23:20.800 --> 3:23:24.880]  is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid
[3:23:24.880 --> 3:23:29.120]  and regain your health and energy simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to
[3:23:29.120 --> 3:23:33.240]  raise the pH to a healthy level alkalizing water helps your body rid
[3:23:33.240 --> 3:23:37.760]  itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body disease
[3:23:37.760 --> 3:23:42.600]  organisms like bacteria viruses and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline
[3:23:42.600 --> 3:23:47.880]  high pH environment order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going

[3:24:04.680 --> 3:24:27.280]  would you stand tall and strong if you saw the things that were wrong well
[3:24:27.280 --> 3:24:33.280]  professor steven e jones did kind of like Galileo saying that the earth
[3:24:33.280 --> 3:24:38.440]  orbited the sun not the sun orbiting the earth and the truth is coming out and
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:42.240]  the system is scared professor jones do you agree with me that or give us your
[3:24:42.240 --> 3:24:47.040]  take on this that we see all these new hit pieces coming out now because they
[3:24:47.040 --> 3:24:50.320]  understand 911 truth that just continued to grow and didn't go away it
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:54.960]  wasn't just a political thing of bashing bush that stage terror is something
[3:24:54.960 --> 3:25:00.480]  that people really understand now I do agree with you there Alex I think that
[3:25:00.480 --> 3:25:06.400]  we are making progress worldwide not not just United States I mean Neil's
[3:25:06.400 --> 3:25:13.640]  heritage professor here in Denmark get calls from all over he told me that he's
[3:25:13.640 --> 3:25:19.760]  been in the media a great deal in Europe so I know that in Europe people are
[3:25:19.760 --> 3:25:25.680]  waking up and including Russia course and other countries in this country it
[3:25:25.680 --> 3:25:32.880]  seems like you know every September 11th we're coming up again two days and we
[3:25:32.880 --> 3:25:38.400]  get this burst of interest which is good but like you say then the like the Nat
[3:25:38.400 --> 3:25:44.720]  Geo program we get this mocking basically calling us truthers and and look at
[3:25:44.720 --> 3:25:49.760]  these guys psychology you know psychoanalyzing us that we're so paranoid
[3:25:49.760 --> 3:25:56.760]  I mean that was the term they use as if we can't do science that that's the
[3:25:56.760 --> 3:26:02.040]  beauty of science as I've repeated Alex is that anyone regardless of belief
[3:26:02.040 --> 3:26:08.600]  system can get the same result if anyone will take a dare here look at the
[3:26:08.600 --> 3:26:14.840]  World Trade Center dust you'll see these chips that are red on one side gray on
[3:26:14.840 --> 3:26:19.160]  the other very distinctive and then do the tests that we did and you'll get the
[3:26:19.160 --> 3:26:23.560]  same result yeah you're finding the nanothermite I mean itself
[3:26:23.560 --> 3:26:29.040]  unignited there one issue that had any credibility the one shred watching the
[3:26:29.040 --> 3:26:34.200]  program several times that I thought had any basis was this claim well your
[3:26:34.200 --> 3:26:37.960]  chain of custody but you have FEMA coming in two days after locking it down
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:43.840]  saying federal crime to even take photos they cut up the steel ship it off but
[3:26:43.840 --> 3:26:46.760]  you and others were able to go to the different states and cities that have
[3:26:46.760 --> 3:26:49.960]  gotten it you know to build memorials with it you were able to get it people
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:53.080]  that owned homes or apartments nearby where it was still wrecked right I mean
[3:26:53.080 --> 3:26:56.840]  I mean speak to that because you've got a bunch of different places you've gotten
[3:26:56.840 --> 3:27:03.680]  this absolutely we've studied in detail six samples now if I count correctly four
[3:27:03.680 --> 3:27:08.120]  are reported in the paper but we've been looking at more samples and they all
[3:27:08.120 --> 3:27:15.080]  have the same signature of the red gray material these chips that still blow up
[3:27:15.080 --> 3:27:21.040]  the red material side blows up after all these years and and let me say in the
[3:27:21.040 --> 3:27:26.360]  paper we make an effort to spell out the chain of custody for those samples
[3:27:26.360 --> 3:27:31.720]  that we reported on in the paper we pointed out the distinct chemical
[3:27:31.720 --> 3:27:37.400]  similarity the chemical signature is being the same in all four samples so
[3:27:37.400 --> 3:27:43.480]  really the basis so maybe someone could what could it be they salted these
[3:27:43.480 --> 3:27:48.760]  samples how could they reach these independent collectors and New York
[3:27:48.760 --> 3:27:53.760]  citizens who did save some of the deaths and I've heard of others since then I
[3:27:53.760 --> 3:27:58.040]  had a call this morning another fellow had saved some death so you know people
[3:27:58.040 --> 3:28:04.360]  were saving it as a as a souvenir nothing else and to suppose that they
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:10.720]  thought that these is now that's really stretching credulity so I haven't heard
[3:28:10.720 --> 3:28:15.520]  that argument too much recently the one argument I have heard recently Alex is
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:22.080]  well well a professor eager he'll find anything he didn't complain about the
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:26.600]  chain of custody he was complaining he said well this has got to be primer
[3:28:26.600 --> 3:28:31.040]  paint just paint that was put on the steel and it's not explosive at all it's
[3:28:31.040 --> 3:28:39.440]  just paint you know ordinary primer paint well we found a sample of steel this
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:46.200]  is actually at a memorial in at Clarkson College in New York State like you
[3:28:46.200 --> 3:28:51.680]  say there are these samples around and this one happens to be a Clarkson I
[3:28:51.680 --> 3:28:58.760]  contacted an individual who lives near nearby she contacted the fellows that
[3:28:58.760 --> 3:29:05.160]  actually put the memorial together the he does welding so he put that together
[3:29:05.160 --> 3:29:12.360]  he collected for us for her and then she sent it to us a sample right off the
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:19.200]  steel of the actual primer paint that was still on the World Trade Center steel
[3:29:19.200 --> 3:29:25.280]  so we tested this primer paint and it's not the same as these red chips not at
[3:29:25.280 --> 3:29:33.240]  all all of the primer paint samples show potassium magnesium and zinc none of the
[3:29:33.240 --> 3:29:38.080]  chips when you I'm talking about when you get a fresh surface for both right
[3:29:38.080 --> 3:29:41.920]  paint and chips look at the fresh surface professor stay there we got a
[3:29:41.920 --> 3:29:46.440]  break okay continue with that all the other side as we debunked the hit piece
[3:29:46.440 --> 3:29:54.080]  put out by National Geographic stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on
[3:29:54.080 --> 3:30:00.440]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[3:30:12.680 --> 3:30:16.440]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[3:30:16.440 --> 3:30:20.320]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental

[3:32:08.440 --> 3:32:12.240]  film terror storm is complete shocking declassified government documents
[3:32:12.240 --> 3:32:15.520]  prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against
[3:32:15.520 --> 3:32:20.040]  their own populations as a pretext to enslave them terror storm proves that
[3:32:20.040 --> 3:32:24.680]  not only was 9 11 an inside job but the attacks of 7 7 in London were carried
[3:32:24.680 --> 3:32:28.360]  out by British intelligence terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to
[3:32:28.360 --> 3:32:33.920]  war in Iran a White House program to disseminate fake news NSA spy secret

[3:33:31.280 --> 3:33:35.320]  saying that may be getting the people off the plane 9 9 9 you knew something
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:38.800]  would happen until this day is over the globalists are obsessed with
[3:33:38.800 --> 3:33:44.720]  numerology flip 9 9 9 over what do you get in which we're coming up on 9 11 I
[3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:49.600]  don't believe in that stuff but they sure do we're gonna recap all the huge new
[3:33:49.600 --> 3:33:52.120]  developments with the Charlie Shane exclusive interviews here he was live
[3:33:52.120 --> 3:33:55.360]  the day that's coming up in the first hour of the show I didn't announce it
[3:33:55.360 --> 3:33:59.240]  right at first but he hopped in at the bottom of the hour and we aired a in its
[3:33:59.240 --> 3:34:02.160]  entirety never before heard interview I did with him a few weeks ago at his home
[3:34:02.160 --> 3:34:09.400]  a 21-minute interview aired in the second hour and so that is all coming up
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:12.680]  again at the retransmission points at info wars dot com and on your local
[3:34:12.680 --> 3:34:18.720]  landman FM stations local Fort wave WWCR and the satellite going back to
[3:34:18.720 --> 3:34:21.640]  professor Stephen Jones in the 10 minutes we have left with him and I'm
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:27.160]  gonna cover financial news and some other issues professor Jones you were
[3:34:27.160 --> 3:34:31.360]  making a point about right so you got the paint that was on the steel not the
[3:34:31.360 --> 3:34:37.520]  same thing right there is not at all the same it's very distinct from the red
[3:34:37.520 --> 3:34:43.840]  great chip material yeah the paint just to recap that as we looked at it using
[3:34:43.840 --> 3:34:52.160]  the electron microscopy system and x-ray dispersive spectroscopy that's that
[3:34:52.160 --> 3:34:57.760]  term and I tell people that will be on the quiz you know and you know I
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:01.840]  appreciate when people make an effort to understand some of the things that we're
[3:35:01.840 --> 3:35:07.880]  trying to do we're probing with electron beams we're looking at the materials
[3:35:07.880 --> 3:35:12.840]  that's in the dust we're finding this pyrotechnic or explosive material you
[3:35:12.840 --> 3:35:16.760]  know I think people understand that that is significant it shouldn't be there in
[3:35:16.760 --> 3:35:22.800]  quantities like that I mean this is a an office building for him and the one
[3:35:22.800 --> 3:35:27.960]  sample was collected within 20 minutes of the fall of the second tower the
[3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:33.200]  north tower so this cannot be contaminated by cleanup operation there
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:38.800]  were no clean-up operations 20 minutes after the second tower collapsed this
[3:35:38.800 --> 3:35:45.080]  was fellow Frank DeLessio scooped that up got that death we found an abundance
[3:35:45.080 --> 3:35:50.080]  of these red great chips in that sample and it was and his friend what's named
[3:35:50.080 --> 3:35:54.800]  my Brian Bach also testified we have their testimony on tape the chain of
[3:35:54.800 --> 3:36:04.040]  custody is clear straight to me and and Jeff Ferrer Dr. Ferrer at BYU so again
[3:36:04.040 --> 3:36:10.240]  when we compare the primer paint this is from steel in a monument at Clarkson
[3:36:10.240 --> 3:36:14.720]  College in New York State compare that primer paint with these red great chips
[3:36:14.720 --> 3:36:20.280]  they are not the same at all the primer paint always shows zinc in abundance
[3:36:20.280 --> 3:36:25.160]  there's a reason for that and always shows potassium always shows magnesium
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:30.240]  this is a fresh surface now you you break off a chunk and you look at the at
[3:36:30.240 --> 3:36:34.600]  the edge so that you're not talking about duck now talking about what's what's
[3:36:34.600 --> 3:36:42.200]  in the in the actual material for the paint shows those elements zinc
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:49.800]  potassium magnesium always whereas the red material never shows those elements
[3:36:49.800 --> 3:36:54.000]  completely distinct we want what are the chips are you saying it's nano
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:59.560]  thermite it certainly has that characteristic I'm persuaded that it
[3:36:59.560 --> 3:37:03.760]  is nano thermite I mean it's an explosive material in the sense they're
[3:37:03.760 --> 3:37:08.920]  pyrotechnic in the sense that it it reacts violently we published that in
[3:37:08.920 --> 3:37:13.320]  our nano thermite paper in the open chemical physics and you wouldn't put
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:19.600]  a accelerant you wouldn't put something explosive as fireproofing on buildings
[3:37:19.600 --> 3:37:25.280]  absolutely no absolutely not it's a very dangerous material you wouldn't want
[3:37:25.280 --> 3:37:30.560]  to breathe it in either Alex I might say that's another like asbestos it's one
[3:37:30.560 --> 3:37:35.560]  of those bad actors that was in the dust the EPA told us that was safe of course
[3:37:35.560 --> 3:37:39.880]  you know as an example the government lying to it and then in that case the
[3:37:39.880 --> 3:37:45.520]  whistleblower nickel Nicky Tinsley was the EPA general inspector and she blew
[3:37:45.520 --> 3:37:49.760]  the whistle on the EPA for lying to the people about the safety of the death and
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:53.280]  by the way seven years ago they would call it a conspiracy theory if you said
[3:37:53.280 --> 3:37:57.040]  Christina Todd weapon was covering up for bush later it came out that one of
[3:37:57.040 --> 3:37:59.600]  her reports said the dust is dangerous in the first week
[3:37:59.600 --> 3:38:04.200]  White House said shut that down that's right and and yeah and the EPA
[3:38:04.200 --> 3:38:08.680]  inspector general Tinsley she spelled that out and wrote that up in a report
[3:38:08.680 --> 3:38:13.520]  and it got into the press I think it was in 03 that that truth came out about
[3:38:13.520 --> 3:38:18.800]  what the EPA had done so you know it's a clear example of where the government
[3:38:18.800 --> 3:38:26.520]  high-level White House you'd say has lied to it and so now here we have we're
[3:38:26.520 --> 3:38:32.040]  having to ferret this out and this refuses to look for explosives or explosive
[3:38:32.040 --> 3:38:36.480]  residues in the World Trade Center dust well we've done so and we challenge them
[3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:42.760]  to do so you know but they have just adamantly refused and their excuses
[3:38:42.760 --> 3:38:47.280]  well you look for something that isn't there you won't find it I'm saying
[3:38:47.280 --> 3:38:52.480]  excuse me how do you know it's not fair until you look you know but it's just
[3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:57.560]  really remarkable and if I may throw in another one which of course was missed
[3:38:57.560 --> 3:39:03.360]  by the Nat Geo program that is the freefall acceleration of World Trade
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:08.920]  Center seven for over two seconds and that's over a hundred feet the roof was
[3:39:08.920 --> 3:39:15.600]  measured by David Chandler I looked at this at two but to David's credit he
[3:39:15.600 --> 3:39:20.960]  plotted the data you know and showed this is essentially freefall and then he and
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:26.200]  I both challenged NIST remember last August they had this forum where you
[3:39:26.200 --> 3:39:30.320]  could send in questions by email which I did and he did we both challenged them
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:36.240]  on their statements about the rate of fall of the World Trade Center seven and
[3:39:36.240 --> 3:39:41.600]  sure enough NIST this is a little bit to their credit they came back and plotted
[3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:47.080]  the data it agrees it lines up with freefall acceleration it lines up with
[3:39:47.080 --> 3:39:52.720]  what David Chandler and I were trying to say and so they admitted that but to
[3:39:52.720 --> 3:39:56.920]  their great discredit they did not go back and say well this is really strange
[3:39:56.920 --> 3:40:00.320]  that means there's nothing impeding the fall that's what freefall means there's
[3:40:00.320 --> 3:40:04.080]  nothing in the way now you've got hundreds of thousands of tons of steel
[3:40:04.080 --> 3:40:09.000]  and concrete these beams don't just give up and disappear their mass alone would
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:13.560]  slow the roof down but nothing's loaded down that takes explosives to move this
[3:40:13.560 --> 3:40:18.840]  material out of the way it's a prime evidence for explosives along with the
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:24.680]  red chips that we have found but what NIST did they swept that data they
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:28.640]  showed that plot but then they say oh this is consistent with our computer
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:33.560]  model at the end of that we're not going to discuss anymore and so you know
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:40.640]  that a computer model which they will not let us test I mean it just can't be
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:45.160]  Alex that having hundreds of thousands of tons of material in the way and you
[3:40:45.160 --> 3:40:49.120]  get freefall unless they took that out of the computer model which actually you
[3:40:49.120 --> 3:40:53.720]  can do in a computer but the simulation but you can't do that in real life
[3:40:53.720 --> 3:40:58.600]  unless you use explosives to move the material out of the way but underriding
[3:40:58.600 --> 3:41:03.480]  laboratories in their own report said that they did fire testing for some
[3:41:03.480 --> 3:41:06.800]  more things and it didn't make anything collapse and it didn't fail did not fail
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:12.000]  right Kevin Ryan pointed that one out and he lost his job over over making that
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:15.960]  one public as I recall that was the issue that's right you were you were
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:19.560]  persecuted no doubt and oh yeah now of your professorship you know you were
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:24.280]  one of the top lights at that university huge developments and discoveries in
[3:41:24.280 --> 3:41:27.960]  your own right but the truth is the truth and God loves you for what you've
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:32.600]  done in the the American people do I hear there's a film coming out soon with a
[3:41:32.600 --> 3:41:37.320]  lot of the material that you presented in it with material that I presented it
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:43.720]  included in the bill no no in a film I'm sorry oh I'm sorry a film yes yeah
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:48.320]  Dylan Avery and his guys are doing one is that the one you're talking about well
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:52.280]  there's that one but I've seen other stuff on the web I guess a lot of
[3:41:52.280 --> 3:41:55.520]  people are just taking your material then and making films that is very very
[3:41:55.520 --> 3:41:59.800]  exciting professor yeah and you know it's not again I have to emphasize it's not
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:07.240]  just me Alex I worked with Neil Tarrant and Dr. Ferrer, Kevin Ryan, Frank
[3:42:07.240 --> 3:42:12.760]  Lakey, Brad Larson, you know Danny Farns were these are a lot of serious
[3:42:12.760 --> 3:42:17.680]  engineers and physicists and scientists right have a lot to lose and I remember
[3:42:17.680 --> 3:42:21.760]  you talking about the professor at BYU you know he just said well I'll I'll I'll
[3:42:21.760 --> 3:42:26.080]  look at it and then of course he found what you found and and we all wish this
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:30.360]  wasn't true I wish this wasn't the case right but I mean I wish three years
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:34.280]  ago I had medical doctors on and they said look in the trials of Gardasil
[3:42:34.280 --> 3:42:38.840]  human papillomavirus vaccine it's killing girls and maiming and paralyzing
[3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:41.800]  them and right I went on air and talked about it and got made fun of by the
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:46.960]  media and then now it's all over the news everywhere I turn where the human
[3:42:46.960 --> 3:42:50.600]  papillomavirus shot is killing or maiming or paralyzing people I mean we're
[3:42:50.600 --> 3:42:54.280]  just we're just trying to tell the truth here it's not enjoyable I'll tell you
[3:42:54.280 --> 3:42:59.360]  I totally agree with you and it does there's a personal cost that you and I
[3:42:59.360 --> 3:43:04.960]  both know I wanted to ask you Alex if I can turn the tables just for a minute
[3:43:04.960 --> 3:43:10.960]  I'm really curious what you're finding out about this vaccine for the swine flu
[3:43:10.960 --> 3:43:16.720]  and I'm sorry if I change the topic but I just got to ask you that question do
[3:43:16.720 --> 3:43:20.760]  you have any I'm sure you have some strong feelings but any advice of what we
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:25.760]  can do about what's coming down the pike you know there's so many pieces of
[3:43:25.760 --> 3:43:31.200]  political data socioeconomic data so many medical doctors and scientists and
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:35.240]  virologist I've interviewed and all the different perspectives it's almost like
[3:43:35.240 --> 3:43:41.400]  I've over analyzed it to the point of we know it's a lie we know it's a fraud we
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:45.600]  knew in January they were gearing up for quarantines mass graves federalization
[3:43:45.600 --> 3:43:51.000]  Northcom to put 400,000 troops on the streets and we saw all these movements in
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:43:53.520]  January I went on there and said I believe it's flu related because
[3:43:53.520 --> 3:43:58.360]  emergency managers in Chicago and in Indiana were telling me this and in
[3:43:58.360 --> 3:44:02.600]  upstate New York then I got secret documents and published them and we
[3:44:02.600 --> 3:44:07.360]  said this isn't a drill they're not using this just as a cover for
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:13.040]  federalization the banks are financing this worldwide is kind of a way of they
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:17.300]  want a worldwide shut everything down during the economic implosion they're
[3:44:17.300 --> 3:44:20.880]  engineering in the fall that they're going to use this to clamp down I said
[3:44:20.880 --> 3:44:27.200]  that in January then in April the flu popped up we said regular flu kills
[3:44:27.200 --> 3:44:31.280]  over 36,000 people every year why are they fear mongering over a few deaths now
[3:44:31.280 --> 3:44:36.520]  it's over 500 why did it come out in the wrong year wrong time of year wrong
[3:44:36.520 --> 3:44:40.640]  hemisphere why I had virologist on it was in BBC News saying it's a
[3:44:40.640 --> 3:44:43.880]  manufactured flu we can look at its pedigree and tell it just came out of
[3:44:43.880 --> 3:44:50.280]  nowhere it's been engineered part human part bird part pig and so the question
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:54.360]  is it isn't just engineered hype to get federalization in place as a cover
[3:44:54.360 --> 3:44:57.960]  without a bunch of death and forced inoculations or is it a cover just to
[3:44:57.960 --> 3:45:00.680]  sell a bunch of vaccines or are they really planning do they know it's going
[3:45:00.680 --> 3:45:04.240]  to mutate into something more deadly vaccine trials in Europe have killed a
[3:45:04.240 --> 3:45:08.200]  bunch of people with different flu vaccines in the last year namely bird
[3:45:08.200 --> 3:45:15.360]  flu there's internal CDC reports that have come out admitting that this could
[3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:19.840]  cause that Gillian Bernays disorder and nerve degeneration and even death that
[3:45:19.840 --> 3:45:23.440]  happened in 76 with the same type of swine flu that popped up in a military
[3:45:23.440 --> 3:45:28.440]  base after inoculations but people don't seem to be buying this move back in 2002
[3:45:28.440 --> 3:45:31.200]  they tried the model state self-emergency powers act tried to
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:35.720]  order all first responders nurses doctors police firemen 14 million total
[3:45:35.720 --> 3:45:42.640]  the LA times reported to take these inoculations and for smallpox and but
[3:45:42.640 --> 3:45:45.960]  then Tommy Thompson wouldn't even take it so the whole thing fell apart so they
[3:45:45.960 --> 3:45:50.480]  keep trying this but usually when it's just a hyped thing they're doing they
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:56.320]  don't build up all these assets and so I think it's an ace in the hole for them
[3:45:56.320 --> 3:46:00.120]  to release something else if they want I mean you know we know it's stage but at
[3:46:00.120 --> 3:46:03.760]  a certain point then we know what they're saying is a lie we know it's stage
[3:46:03.760 --> 3:46:10.880]  but we don't know what their exact playbook is or exactly when but if I
[3:46:10.880 --> 3:46:15.360]  could interject to one thing I really appreciate about you Alex is here your
[3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:20.240]  personal research I'm sure you have a team but you have these facts right at
[3:46:20.240 --> 3:46:25.480]  your fingertips and I think it's great on a variety of subjects that correlate
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:29.560]  and the second point I really appreciate that about you and your in your program
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:34.920]  second thing I wanted to say was that I could ask I just asked you the other day
[3:46:34.920 --> 3:46:41.200]  oh you know maybe 9-11 was the inside job I mean maybe his government was new
[3:46:41.200 --> 3:46:45.160]  about it or let it happen you know but what difference does it make really I
[3:46:45.160 --> 3:46:49.560]  mean it's over with its past you know eight years ago and I said look these
[3:46:49.560 --> 3:46:59.120]  same people the puppeteers there if you get the big picture it's not over and
[3:46:59.120 --> 3:47:04.440]  the sooner we wake up the sooner we can we can do something to change our
[3:47:04.440 --> 3:47:11.640]  Republic to have this renaissance that we we need to clean up these guys if we
[3:47:11.640 --> 3:47:17.400]  possibly can at this late date and and stop them it's not gonna stop just by
[3:47:17.400 --> 3:47:21.760]  bearing our heads in the sand and saying exactly I mean every time I think
[3:47:21.760 --> 3:47:24.880]  about getting set up getting put in prison getting killed and I'm not trying
[3:47:24.880 --> 3:47:28.520]  to get sympathy here folks I mean it's it's it's I don't even tell you a
[3:47:28.520 --> 3:47:31.960]  tenth of the stuff that goes on behind the scenes but I live in like a James
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:37.600]  Bond movie but I'm not James Bond I'm just an average guy and the whenever
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:41.640]  it's overwhelming or wake up at 3 a.m. like not even fear but more just gripped
[3:47:41.640 --> 3:47:45.320]  by the enormity I think about my children but other people's children and
[3:47:45.320 --> 3:47:49.440]  you're right these sickos that did this are gonna continue to stage events
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:52.160]  they're gonna continue to do wicked things it wasn't George Bush that did
[3:47:52.160 --> 3:47:55.400]  this it was it was the National Security Council it was the private
[3:47:55.400 --> 3:47:59.560]  corporate takeover above them you know the CFR wrote manuals how they needed
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:04.320]  big catalyzing terror events and Cheney did right and and I'm in this when I
[3:48:04.320 --> 3:48:08.200]  got involved 13 and a half 14 years ago I had no idea how deep it was how bad it
[3:48:08.200 --> 3:48:11.680]  was I was naive I was just standing up for the Bill of Rights the Constitution
[3:48:11.680 --> 3:48:17.000]  and now I realize I'm point of no return I can't go back but plus none of us can
[3:48:17.000 --> 3:48:21.080]  go back even if people live in denial and say this isn't happening you know you
[3:48:21.080 --> 3:48:26.840]  can't go back you can't go back once you know the truth and I yeah I felt the
[3:48:26.840 --> 3:48:31.760]  same way when I learned about this it was actually spring of 05 when I first
[3:48:31.760 --> 3:48:36.520]  saw World Trade Center 7 coming down and the way it came down I pulled on my
[3:48:36.520 --> 3:48:43.400]  stopwatch you know I was reading and analyzing and it just hit me like a ton
[3:48:43.400 --> 3:48:48.080]  of bricks and then you know I'm reading this well listen at PNAC reports that
[3:48:48.080 --> 3:48:54.560]  came out in well it came out about it just about a year September 20th 2000
[3:48:54.560 --> 3:49:00.200]  rebuilding America's defenses right so just one year before 9-11 2001 and I
[3:49:00.200 --> 3:49:05.000]  think man these guys are talking about American Empire and they're not even you
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:10.920]  know hiding it they want hegemony domination using United States military
[3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:16.800]  power and they say we've got to have a Pearl Harbor style event to do it Pearl
[3:49:16.800 --> 3:49:24.360]  Harbor killed 3,911 killed right at 3,000 yeah yeah and so anyway it hit me
[3:49:24.360 --> 3:49:30.560]  and you know my a lot of my family now have awakened to this situation awful
[3:49:30.560 --> 3:49:34.080]  situation really but that you know there's some things we feel that we we
[3:49:34.080 --> 3:49:40.200]  are doing it's not totally pessimistic is that we're people like you and I are
[3:49:40.200 --> 3:49:44.440]  speaking out doing what we can and then you know I'm I always like to encourage
[3:49:44.440 --> 3:49:48.880]  people to get food storage and I'm sure glad I bought some gold and silver a few
[3:49:48.880 --> 3:49:53.280]  years ago but gold just went over a thousand dollars an ounce do you see
[3:49:53.280 --> 3:49:57.400]  that yeah I told people to buy it when it was 300 I mean we but we're not
[3:49:57.400 --> 3:50:01.720]  perfect we try I mean I buy gold I've got guns I've got food I'm not looking for
[3:50:01.720 --> 3:50:05.680]  trouble I just know that when you leave us in the final segment I'm gonna hit the
[3:50:05.680 --> 3:50:10.360]  news where top economists are in major news saying the dollar will probably die
[3:50:10.360 --> 3:50:14.560]  in the next two years we will probably be like Argentina I'm not the one saying
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:18.680]  that but we knew years ago they were planning it professor I'd like to have

[3:54:52.360 --> 3:54:56.280]  the U.S.-U.N. relationship to become head of the U.N. Security Council at the same time
[3:54:56.280 --> 3:55:00.120]  as being president first time ever, merging us with the U.N., basically, Financial Times
[3:55:00.120 --> 3:55:01.320]  of London.
[3:55:01.320 --> 3:55:05.880]  McClatchy News, a year after financial crisis, a New World Order emerges.
[3:55:05.880 --> 3:55:09.200]  U.N. panel calls for dollar reserve to be eliminated.
[3:55:09.200 --> 3:55:13.640]  That is the United Nations, and Obama's bringing us into this.
[3:55:13.640 --> 3:55:15.800]  That is Wall Street Journal.
[3:55:15.800 --> 3:55:22.120]  Barack Obama accused of making depression mistakes, then it goes on to say top economist, George
[3:55:22.120 --> 3:55:26.320]  Washington, George Mason University, it is also not impossible if the U.S. will experience
[3:55:26.320 --> 3:55:31.400]  the kind of economic collapse from first third world status, from first to third world status,
[3:55:31.400 --> 3:55:35.080]  experienced by Argentina under the National Socialist Government of Juan Perón.
[3:55:35.080 --> 3:55:38.480]  U.N. wants a new global currency to replace dollar.
[3:55:38.480 --> 3:55:41.000]  That's a London Guardian, another article in the London Telegraph.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:44.680]  Nancy Pelosi, every aspect of her life must be subject to inventory.
[3:55:44.680 --> 3:55:48.840]  France molds CO2 taxes on all citizens, everything you eat, everything you do, tract.
[3:55:48.840 --> 3:55:50.240]  You get a carbon ration.
[3:55:50.240 --> 3:55:52.800]  They had the British scientists calling for that a few months ago.
[3:55:52.800 --> 3:55:56.240]  German government advisor, top environment guys that propose a CO2 budget for everyone
[3:55:56.240 --> 3:55:57.240]  on planet.
[3:55:57.240 --> 3:56:01.400]  If you complain about your daughter getting killed or paralyzed, times of London from Gardasil,
[3:56:01.400 --> 3:56:05.080]  they take your other children, times of London, they're going to take your kids away to fat
[3:56:05.080 --> 3:56:06.080]  camps.
[3:56:06.080 --> 3:56:08.840]  They're saying in England they want tens of thousands of kids to be taken at birth and
[3:56:08.840 --> 3:56:12.760]  raised in government dormitories first, while the parents prove they can be parents.
[3:56:12.760 --> 3:56:15.480]  This is what's going on financially and politically.
[3:56:15.480 --> 3:56:18.520]  I mean, this is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:56:18.520 --> 3:56:21.680]  If we let the bankers know we're not going to go along with it, they won't bankrupt
[3:56:21.680 --> 3:56:22.680]  everything.
[3:56:22.680 --> 3:56:25.320]  Just like if we let them know they're behind the flu stuff, they'll back off.
[3:56:25.320 --> 3:56:28.600]  I wanted to bring Ted up in the last three minutes before we go into retransmission at
[3:56:28.600 --> 3:56:29.600]  infowars.com.
[3:56:29.600 --> 3:56:33.960]  Ted, and there's so many big developments coming up this week, I haven't even told
[3:56:33.960 --> 3:56:36.600]  you about other special celebrity guests.
[3:56:36.600 --> 3:56:39.120]  Looks like Thursday or Friday, tomorrow or Friday.
[3:56:39.120 --> 3:56:43.080]  Ted, briefly, you've still got gold you bought at the 945 level.
[3:56:43.080 --> 3:56:45.120]  Silver you bought when it was $2 less than it is now.
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:46.720]  You're almost running out.
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:48.400]  You told me during the break earlier.
[3:56:48.400 --> 3:56:49.520]  You want to give people this offer?
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:54.360]  This may be the last time it was, you're selling it for $905 an ounce a week ago.
[3:56:54.360 --> 3:56:57.380]  It's up at a thousand right now, been above a thousand.
[3:56:57.380 --> 3:56:58.520]  People can get this right now.
[3:56:58.520 --> 3:57:00.360]  Tell folks the offer you've got, Ted Anderson.
[3:57:00.360 --> 3:57:04.680]  Well, here's the best offer that I have right now, Barnan and the Walking Liberty Haves,
[3:57:04.680 --> 3:57:07.040]  and they're at $8.69.
[3:57:07.040 --> 3:57:10.360]  That's relative to spots over at $11 an ounce.
[3:57:10.360 --> 3:57:12.360]  Right now it's about $16.50.
[3:57:12.360 --> 3:57:14.440]  So that's below spot.
[3:57:14.440 --> 3:57:15.440]  Excuse me.
[3:57:15.440 --> 3:57:16.440]  That's below spot.
[3:57:16.440 --> 3:57:19.680]  It was below where the spot is today when I originally accumulated this deal.
[3:57:19.680 --> 3:57:21.200]  You can't get a better deal in silver.
[3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:22.200]  Okay.
[3:57:22.200 --> 3:57:23.200]  Below spots, silver.
[3:57:23.200 --> 3:57:24.200]  Tell us about the gold.
[3:57:24.200 --> 3:57:25.200]  Yeah.
[3:57:25.200 --> 3:57:26.920]  The gold right now, the best thing in gold right now, are they going to be the $10 Liberty
[3:57:26.920 --> 3:57:33.200]  at $8.18.50 or pick up the British sovereign of the Frank at $233 and $288.
[3:57:33.200 --> 3:57:35.600]  Alex, the markets are going like this.
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:39.360]  The United States market's trying to press gold down, and once the Asian markets open
[3:57:39.360 --> 3:57:45.360]  up, gold goes back up over $1,000 an ounce to spend as high as $1,005 today.
[3:57:45.360 --> 3:57:49.160]  And you could just see it, the Asian people want to get out of the U.S. dollar.
[3:57:49.160 --> 3:57:53.800]  And the Federal Reserve system here in New York, which is where the comics is, is trying
[3:57:53.800 --> 3:57:55.840]  to push it down when the New York market opens up.
[3:57:55.840 --> 3:57:58.080]  So it's kangarooing, folks.
[3:57:58.080 --> 3:57:59.400]  Can't beat these gold and silver deals.
[3:57:59.400 --> 3:58:04.040]  The brokers are standing by until midnight tonight, 800-686-2237, 800-686-2237.
[3:58:04.040 --> 3:58:09.080]  Ted, how long can you hold this deal?
[3:58:09.080 --> 3:58:12.960]  We're going to definitely hold it until midnight, and we'll see what goes on in the market tomorrow.
[3:58:12.960 --> 3:58:13.960]  Very volatile.
[3:58:13.960 --> 3:58:14.960]  I don't know for sure.
[3:58:14.960 --> 3:58:19.200]  800-686-2237, get out of some of those paper notes.
[3:58:19.200 --> 3:58:22.320]  Into gold and silver today, 800-686-2237.
[3:58:22.320 --> 3:58:25.360]  Ted Anderson, thank you so much.

[3:58:56.160 --> 3:58:57.160]  this summer.
[3:58:57.160 --> 3:59:01.040]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:01.040 --> 3:59:05.640]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:59:05.640 --> 3:59:06.880]  allows you to have.
[3:59:06.880 --> 3:59:11.760]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:59:11.760 --> 3:59:16.120]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:59:16.120 --> 3:59:18.520]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
