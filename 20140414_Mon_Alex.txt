[00:50.480 --> 00:55.360]  what it was and you're gonna you're gonna see some clips that we haven't aired yet about the
[00:55.360 --> 01:03.120]  bundy family and about the standoff these are men who are meek but they have backbones of steel
[01:03.120 --> 01:09.200]  they are the kind of men we need to see i tell you what talking to cliven bundy reminded me so
[01:09.200 --> 01:16.480]  much of ron paul in so many ways not a big brash person not tooting his horn and he is not a law
[01:16.480 --> 01:22.480]  breaker getting away with breaking the law we didn't help somebody to do that we've had people leave
[01:22.480 --> 01:28.880]  comments like that i'm going to tell you how to distinguish between real law and between law that
[01:28.880 --> 01:34.320]  is enacted without representation you know we had a revolution this country about taxation without
[01:34.320 --> 01:39.880]  representation we not only have taxation without representation we now have regulation without
[01:39.880 --> 01:44.760]  representation and if you don't understand that in this particular case they're going to get you
[01:44.760 --> 01:51.760]  in every aspect every walk of life it doesn't matter if you're not a rancher and don't have
[01:51.760 --> 01:57.440]  grazing rights don't have water rights to some land if you've got any property at all your property
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.800]  is at stake if you don't stand for other people's property rights if the government can come in an
[02:02.800 --> 02:10.160]  unelected government have you ever seen blm on any of your ballots i haven't have you ever seen
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.280]  have you ever had a chance to vote for an epa official or an irs official yet they have the
[02:15.280 --> 02:20.000]  power they claim to regulate our lives we're going to talk about that alex is going to be joining
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.160]  us at 1230 central josh is going to be joining us at noon josh was the cameraman you typically
[02:26.160 --> 02:32.080]  didn't see it he was there with me the entire time we want you to hear from us what we saw we're
[02:32.080 --> 02:35.920]  going to tell you what we saw you know how you can tell what really happened there the mainstream
[02:35.920 --> 02:39.920]  media has got its own narrative that is developing they're pushing back they're trying to criminalize
[02:39.920 --> 02:45.520]  the bundes they're trying to make them into uh well let's say i've seen things i've seen them
[02:45.520 --> 02:52.800]  called uh Mormons uh rich white ranchers a lot of personal invective that was not the spirit we
[02:52.800 --> 03:00.160]  saw there uh they're not first of all very rich and we had people from all over the the west
[03:00.160 --> 03:06.400]  that descended on that place to stand with them in support and we stood them down we didn't have
[03:06.400 --> 03:12.480]  to resort to gunfire we had some people had guns to back it up with it but he told people not even
[03:12.480 --> 03:18.400]  to bring the guns not to be afraid of them we were in the right we looked them in the eye and they
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.960]  blinked this can be done everywhere and we're going to talk about how it can be done and we're
[03:22.960 --> 03:27.920]  and i'm not talking about people just showing up every time there's a crisis because the government
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.120]  is attacking so many people so many places that we can't be at every place and we're going to play
[03:33.120 --> 03:39.600]  some uh a speech from uh amon bundy one of the sons talking about what it was like to see his
[03:39.600 --> 03:45.120]  country turned into martial law the place that he had grown up in that his father his grandfather
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.280]  his great grandfather had grown up in for generations they were there they had never
[03:49.280 --> 03:55.360]  seen they were always free to roam the land and yet one day they find that there's a military
[03:55.360 --> 04:01.440]  operation pointed at them guns pointed snipers on the hills pointing their guns at them could it
[04:01.440 --> 04:06.880]  happen to you yes it will happen to you if you don't stand up for the principles that are involved
[04:06.880 --> 04:11.680]  here so we're going to talk about the principles involved we've also had a tie with the crony
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.480]  capitalism the corruption of harry reid and others and we're going to be joined by gerome
[04:16.480 --> 04:22.320]  corsi and the third hour if you think that this is over with the chinese i don't think it's over
[04:22.320 --> 04:25.840]  it's also not over with the bundys we understand that even though there's been a victory in the
[04:25.840 --> 04:32.480]  battle of bunkerville this is just a battle the war is not over it's not over for the bundys it's
[04:32.480 --> 04:37.360]  not over for america we have to talk about how we're going to do that and we can all do that
[04:37.360 --> 04:40.320]  there's things that we can do we're going to be talking to gerome corsi though about how the
[04:40.320 --> 04:45.840]  chinese are going everywhere in this country and it's not just in that area we'll be right back
[04:45.840 --> 04:56.320]  stay tuned we've got an exciting show a lot of clips that you haven't seen yet
[04:56.320 --> 05:04.960]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming
[05:04.960 --> 05:10.160]  more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air

[05:14.560 --> 05:20.080]  air and most americans spend 90 of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[05:20.080 --> 05:25.280]  there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of mold
[05:25.280 --> 05:30.160]  in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans live
[05:30.160 --> 05:34.960]  with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear to me

[08:55.920 --> 09:02.240]  going to talk about what we saw there and if you think that this is over because the enn chinese
[09:02.240 --> 09:08.880]  company said that they're going to stop this solar project back in june it is not over with them
[09:08.880 --> 09:13.440]  we're going to have drum corsie on at the top of the third hour and he's going to talk about the
[09:13.440 --> 09:19.040]  deals being made with the chinese to loot the entire country even if they don't come back to this
[09:19.040 --> 09:23.680]  place there are many many other areas where they're going to go a lot of people missed the point
[09:24.480 --> 09:31.120]  that this was about the area that the bundy family was in was a mitigation area if you understand
[09:31.120 --> 09:35.280]  the way these people work with carbon credits this is what they were doing they were they were
[09:35.280 --> 09:39.920]  going to say we're going to destroy the environment in this one area but we're going to pull up this
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.400]  other area make it extra pristine that's going to be the mitigation for our solar projects that
[09:44.400 --> 09:47.440]  we're putting in with people so we're going to be talking to drum corsie on the third hour
[09:48.160 --> 09:54.640]  about the crony capitalism about the corruption about the looting of the american people the
[09:54.640 --> 10:03.360]  government should not be owning these lands under the constitution they should be not owning anything
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.520]  more than just a 10 mile square area in washington and the area that they need for forts and other
[10:09.520 --> 10:16.480]  things article 1 section 8 clause 17 look it up however what they're doing in the west is they're
[10:16.480 --> 10:22.480]  owning vast swaths of land 85 90 in avada they continually accumulate more they're looking to
[10:22.480 --> 10:29.360]  get 90 000 acres here in texas what are they doing with this land they're declaring it to be the
[10:29.360 --> 10:35.840]  king's land pushing people off people who have had rights property rights on that land that the
[10:35.840 --> 10:43.280]  bundies never said that they owned the land they did have rights on that land they had grazing rights
[10:43.280 --> 10:49.120]  they had water rights those rights needed to be abrogated they needed to be pushed off before
[10:49.920 --> 10:56.480]  harry reid and others like obama could sell this area off they're after surface rights for solar
[10:56.480 --> 11:01.680]  projects they're after mineral rights they're after oil rights they're after all kinds of
[11:01.680 --> 11:06.640]  things in that area that they're going to sell off to large corporations most of them multinational
[11:06.640 --> 11:10.640]  many of them chinese that's what gerome course he's going to be talking about and then of course the
[11:10.640 --> 11:15.840]  corrupt politicians get their gratuities at the end that's fundamentally what this is about
[11:15.840 --> 11:20.240]  and we're going to talk about how this whole thing rolled out but before we do and there you see on
[11:20.240 --> 11:26.640]  the screen there's harry reid they've actually broken a solar project broken ground on it this was
[11:26.640 --> 11:31.520]  an announcement that went out on february the 19th and they announced that that picture that you
[11:31.520 --> 11:37.440]  just saw up there with harry reid breaking ground on the project that is the first solar project
[11:38.160 --> 11:43.920]  and that press release went out on march the 21st they said today us senate majority leader harry
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.360]  reid joined representatives from the maapa band of payudes executives from first solar etc that
[11:49.360 --> 11:56.080]  is a multinational company as well that has put up two large solar projects one in california one
[11:56.080 --> 12:01.600]  in nevada and let me read you from their press release back on february the 19th they said these
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.480]  solar projects reflect exemplary cooperation between the blm and other federal state and local
[12:06.480 --> 12:12.400]  agencies enabling through environmental review and robust mitigation provisions the mitigation
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.040]  provisions specifically mentioned the bundy ranch because he was the last rancher that they hadn't
[12:17.040 --> 12:23.440]  driven out of business they use these code violations just as they use them in the cities they create
[12:23.440 --> 12:29.680]  a code violation they come after poor people who have homes in the area they start multiplying fees
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.400]  against them until they can condemn the homes knock the homes down and of course they've passed laws
[12:34.400 --> 12:39.920]  that people cannot rebuild and that's small of a lot so they keep these properties that's what
[12:39.920 --> 12:45.680]  i've seen happen in tampa that's what alex jones has seen happen in austin that's the way they
[12:45.680 --> 12:52.000]  pull people out of their homes and the same thing is going on only on a much much larger scale there
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.920]  were 53 ranchers that were there before they put them out of business if you change the terms of
[12:57.920 --> 13:02.480]  the agreement that these people have held for generations and say you're only going to be able
[13:02.480 --> 13:06.960]  to have a business that is 10 the size it was before they're going to drive most of those people
[13:06.960 --> 13:16.080]  out they did it without using any kind of eminent domain they did it just with regulation until their
[13:16.080 --> 13:20.240]  businesses were not really worth anything a few people they bought out for pennies on the dollar
[13:20.240 --> 13:27.680]  many of them died under the stress you can't allow this to happen in this area if you do
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.440]  it's going to happen everywhere but here's the other thing we saw and this is one of the reasons
[13:31.440 --> 13:37.840]  we went out there as paul joseph watson reported a week ago and the story went national when drudge
[13:37.840 --> 13:44.960]  picked up his stories we saw marshal law being enacted in that area we saw them moving against
[13:44.960 --> 13:50.080]  the family let me play for you the words of amon bundy and this is what he said in the morning
[13:50.080 --> 13:54.880]  before anything happened with the sheriff and this is before anything happened with the cattle
[13:54.880 --> 14:00.560]  he was just recalling what it was like to see his area where he had lived under marshal law let me
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.200]  play that for you right here i looked up on those hills and they they were completely occupied
[14:07.680 --> 14:15.280]  and we were under marshal law by an unauthorized agency and that's the way it was if we stepped
[14:15.280 --> 14:22.720]  off the road they would bounce off and then shove our faces in the dirt and to help with that feeling
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.920]  i've never had it before in this country to have the feeling of freedom taken away from you
[14:27.920 --> 14:38.880]  my friends it is not a good feeling it is not a good feeling my family and the community
[14:38.880 --> 14:45.920]  has run these hills and enjoy these hills for generations never once in the history of this
[14:45.920 --> 14:55.600]  nation have those mountains ever been restricted from us never and yet this week they were so
[14:55.600 --> 15:07.440]  a battle began a battle on the roadside where my brother was taken down by about 20 agencies and
[15:07.440 --> 15:13.680]  taken to the federal court our federal jail and we had to battle for him and then they
[15:13.680 --> 15:17.360]  didn't even prosecute him just jumped dumped him out on the street once they knew that everybody's
[15:17.360 --> 15:24.720]  going to make a big enough steam that's exactly what we're talking about it's marshal law he called
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.440]  it marshal law it is marshal law if there is no free speech this is a bureaucracy from washington
[15:29.440 --> 15:34.080]  that went into this area and said we're going to set up free speech areas where you can exercise
[15:34.080 --> 15:40.560]  your free speech they set up snipers pointing at these people he said there was just only about
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.720]  three of us about a week ago and we were facing snipers on the hill i couldn't believe that this
[15:44.720 --> 15:48.880]  would happen in our own area let me tell you something if you're in denial about what happened
[15:48.880 --> 15:53.840]  to this family you're going to see the same thing happen to you if you don't stand together if they
[15:53.840 --> 15:59.040]  can come in and say you have no free speech we're going to arrest you if you set foot on this property
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.000]  on the king's land if they're going to set up observation posts looking at people if they're
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.880]  going to rest or and taze or anybody that steps out of their car onto this and we saw this happen
[16:08.880 --> 16:15.440]  over and over again they're basically were acting as predators and the videos that you've seen
[16:15.440 --> 16:20.160]  where they tasered the guy that was just speaking that was amon bundy he was the son of climb and
[16:20.160 --> 16:27.680]  bundy tasered him multiple times multiple times these guys pulled them out and kept going they
[16:27.680 --> 16:31.920]  didn't go after these guys what they did was they came up then in the crowd and attacked
[16:31.920 --> 16:37.600]  the smallest person there a woman who was recovering from cancer grabbed her from behind
[16:37.600 --> 16:43.680]  and threw her to the ground they're ambush predators they single out the week that's why
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.920]  we needed to stand with them that's why we needed to have everybody standing up and i was
[16:47.920 --> 16:52.160]  so heartened to see so many people show up so many of them told us that they had heard about this
[16:52.160 --> 16:57.600]  story through info wars because it broke nationally when drudge picked up watson's story
[16:58.880 --> 17:05.680]  and just the spirit of the people there we went to that area when they called for people to go to
[17:05.680 --> 17:11.920]  the area to pick up the cattle it was great to see climb and bundy standing there listening to the
[17:12.640 --> 17:16.560]  sheriff saying that they were now going to give them back some of their rights and they take
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.480]  100 steps forward and they take one step back and he just listened to him silently and then he
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.520]  got up and he said well i'm going to tell you now what we want we want you as the lawful
[17:28.080 --> 17:34.480]  authority here the sheriff to collect the weapons from this unlawful military band that's come here
[17:34.480 --> 17:40.320]  and deposit them here in one hour and we want you to take down those barricades where they've
[17:40.320 --> 17:45.360]  been taxing people where they've been attacking people we want you to take those down in one hour
[17:45.360 --> 17:51.200]  more now we waited and of course they didn't do any of that and then he got up to the microphone he
[17:51.200 --> 17:56.960]  said i don't give you orders i only give orders to two people the governor and the sheriff because
[17:56.960 --> 18:01.440]  they have a duty to fulfill but he goes i'm telling you what we're going to do we're going to go get
[18:01.440 --> 18:07.280]  our cattle and if you want to come with us you can and it was an amazing sight everybody got in
[18:07.280 --> 18:14.320]  the cars we went down there as we got to the area they were telling us leave the area we have a court
[18:14.320 --> 18:20.400]  order we will use lethal force we will shoot we waited for the cavalry to get there essentially
[18:20.400 --> 18:25.760]  we stood there and waited as they were threatening us and then gradually as the cavalry got there we
[18:25.760 --> 18:31.600]  gradually approached and we walked them down like v from vendetta it was amazing to see the
[18:31.600 --> 18:37.760]  resolution of these people and the peacefulness of it this is the thing i've seen people writing
[18:37.760 --> 18:43.040]  comments about how as christians should we take up arms against our government you know they told
[18:43.040 --> 18:48.400]  us to obey legal authority that's the question what is legal authority can you determine what
[18:48.400 --> 18:56.560]  legitimate authority is many times people have questioned whether or not this is they're doing
[18:56.560 --> 19:00.400]  the right thing whether they had a right to do this or not let me tell you something when the
[19:00.400 --> 19:09.200]  blm when the epa when the irs when osha and atf can create their regulations without any input from
[19:09.200 --> 19:15.920]  us that is regulation without representation take a look at a federal reserve note and how they
[19:15.920 --> 19:20.880]  used to teach before they changed the federal reserve notes every few months they used to
[19:20.880 --> 19:26.320]  teach people how to recognize counterfeit federal reserve notes by having them study the real thing
[19:27.200 --> 19:31.680]  you know how to know whether or not a law is legitimate or not you study the real thing
[19:32.320 --> 19:38.320]  that's the constitution the bundies knew the constitution cliven bundy taught his family
[19:38.320 --> 19:43.680]  the constitution we're going to be right back we've got a comment from the bureau of land management
[19:43.680 --> 19:48.000]  finally they responded to our questions about why they're doing this we're going to have that

[24:17.920 --> 24:23.920]  bundy ranch standoff i was there so was josh oens he's going to be joining me at the top of the hour
[24:23.920 --> 24:28.160]  we're going to be joined at the bottom of the next hour at twelve thirty central time with alex
[24:28.160 --> 24:32.960]  jones we're going to talk about how important this event was the many principles that were
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.120]  involved here the victory that we saw here they basically were stood down by determined group
[24:39.120 --> 24:44.240]  let me read you the motto of the texas rangers no man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow
[24:44.240 --> 24:51.040]  that's on the right and keeps on a coming that's the story this weekend that's what happened on saturday
[24:51.040 --> 24:58.400]  that's what's been happening with cliven bundy since 1993 he's been in the right and he's kept on
[24:58.400 --> 25:05.360]  a coming now they were teaming up against him with his family they had brought 200 officers down there
[25:05.360 --> 25:10.640]  is the count that i have seen certainly believe that as they were leaving the area we counted
[25:10.640 --> 25:16.240]  82 vehicles leaving a massive compound can you guys pull up for the people who are watching pull
[25:16.240 --> 25:22.320]  up the picture they had aerial pictures that they had taken of the blm compound there uh i guess it
[25:22.320 --> 25:27.920]  was thursday they finally got somebody who came down and volunteered with a plane they were trying
[25:27.920 --> 25:32.240]  to find his cattle his cattle were scattered all over the place they were trying to find them before
[25:32.240 --> 25:38.080]  the blm did so they could round them up they also took pictures of the compound click on one of those
[25:38.080 --> 25:44.000]  and you can get a large picture of that there you go a huge compound a huge military operation
[25:44.000 --> 25:51.360]  mounted against these people but what happened was mr bundy quietly stood on his rights they
[25:51.360 --> 25:58.560]  were trying to run him off the land just as they had 52 other ranchers using code violations created
[25:58.560 --> 26:05.920]  by the bureau of land management which doesn't have any authority to legally write the law but
[26:05.920 --> 26:11.600]  we've allowed that to happen and it's not just that agency we see that happening with every
[26:11.600 --> 26:18.320]  bureaucracy every bureaucracy in washington is writing their own laws creating their own militarized
[26:18.320 --> 26:23.120]  police force that they will use as if it is undeclared martial law whenever they feel like
[26:23.120 --> 26:28.480]  they need to that's part of the ammunition purchases that we've seen we've seen all these
[26:28.480 --> 26:35.360]  agencies even uh the uh oceanic agency noa has got its own law enforcement agencies like that the
[26:35.360 --> 26:40.320]  department of education and they have used them as SWAT teams there was a case where they pulled a man
[26:40.320 --> 26:46.160]  in his family out of their home at the dead of night with guns loaded to their heads because
[26:46.160 --> 26:50.320]  they were looking for the wife who was no longer even living with the family she had left the family
[26:50.320 --> 26:54.960]  because she had some outstanding student loans so the department of education sent the department
[26:54.960 --> 27:01.760]  of education SWAT team to collect the loans if you think this is just about some rich white
[27:01.760 --> 27:06.720]  rancher Mormon getting his cattle back and you know disobeying the law and not paying his grazing
[27:06.720 --> 27:12.640]  fees you're not paying attention essentially none of that is true there's a lot of really hateful
[27:12.640 --> 27:18.480]  rhetoric about dividing people into groups and we've got a quote from Clive and Bundy's brother
[27:18.480 --> 27:23.440]  who discusses that about how their tactics just as we have pointed out their tactics is always
[27:23.440 --> 27:30.240]  are always to divide and conquer the population i see our whole society being picked apart by
[27:30.240 --> 27:36.960]  by forcing us into little groups that won't stand together this is Steve Bundy this group over here
[27:36.960 --> 27:41.440]  and they're worthless and this group over here and there this and there that and this is that and
[27:41.440 --> 27:47.120]  everybody's divided and everybody has some kind of conflict that they can't stand up for the other
[27:47.120 --> 27:54.000]  one and this divides our society this is time and brothers stand here and I see people from every
[27:54.000 --> 28:00.480]  walk of life standing here and this has changed my life from Monday till today
[28:05.680 --> 28:10.880]  that was an amazing speech let me tell you what happened on Saturday we had an interview scheduled
[28:10.880 --> 28:17.760]  at eight o'clock in the morning with mr. Bundy and we went we went to the place where we had
[28:17.760 --> 28:21.200]  arranged for the interview he wasn't there so we went to find out what was going on at the ranch
[28:21.200 --> 28:26.480]  and they told us that the whole family was meeting in prayer that they had just heard that the sheriff
[28:26.480 --> 28:32.240]  was going to be there at nine a.m. in the morning and he wanted to meet privately with mr. Bundy
[28:32.240 --> 28:35.760]  but he wasn't going to meet with him privately he said if you got anything to say to me
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.560]  you can say it to the people that are here the sheriff wanted to meet with him behind closed
[28:40.560 --> 28:46.880]  doors overnight they had decided that they were going to allow him to put his cattle back on the
[28:46.880 --> 28:53.840]  range it was interesting when we first got there they had signs up at the entrance to the open range
[28:53.840 --> 28:58.800]  area saying that there was a cattle guard crossing and if you don't know what one of those are it's
[28:58.800 --> 29:03.680]  basically a lot of metal bars that were put into the street and the second day we got there they
[29:03.680 --> 29:11.040]  had taken down those signs and so we got out and we took a picture of that Josh and I did a report
[29:11.040 --> 29:16.560]  on that showing that those cattle guard signs were down showing that something that had been there
[29:16.560 --> 29:23.120]  for a very very long time and of course the family has been there for 140 years the state of Nevada
[29:23.120 --> 29:28.560]  had put that cattle guard into the road they had put those signs up and they were going to remove
[29:28.560 --> 29:33.360]  those rights that was where things were on friday we're going to pick it up and tell you what changed
[29:33.360 --> 29:40.400]  on friday and how the events came down on saturday but it was truly an amazing story how this turned
[29:40.400 --> 29:46.880]  around we can stand them down peacefully if we just look them in the eye they will blink we'll be right
[29:46.880 --> 29:55.680]  back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[33:28.640 --> 33:33.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and i've just gotten back from the
[33:33.040 --> 33:39.600]  bundy ranch standoff in nevada as we heard at that beginning of the of the break as we're
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.240]  coming back in obama saying you got a business you didn't build that we built that that's the
[33:44.240 --> 33:50.960]  attitude i have seen over and over again about this standoff that the government has owns this
[33:50.960 --> 33:55.280]  property the government has rights everybody else just has privileges that are granted to them by
[33:55.280 --> 34:02.400]  the government nothing could be further from the truth we have rights that are given to us by our
[34:02.400 --> 34:08.800]  creator the people who are there understood that they were raised on the constitution they were
[34:08.800 --> 34:15.600]  raised on a strong faith in god they were grounded people they knew what was genuine
[34:15.600 --> 34:21.680]  and what was not the same way as i mentioned earlier how did you used to train people when we
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.080]  had a cash society now we're gone pretty much to a cashless society and we've had to see the money
[34:26.080 --> 34:31.280]  changing all the time but when they didn't change the money every few months we had a long-standing
[34:32.160 --> 34:36.160]  federal reserve notes that people knew what they looked like and the way they trained bank
[34:36.160 --> 34:40.960]  tellers was to have them study the details of these notes that's the way they would understand
[34:40.960 --> 34:44.800]  what a counterfeit looked like they didn't look at all the different counterfeit reports from these
[34:44.800 --> 34:50.000]  various news media we're here to tell you what happened there i'm here to tell you what happened
[34:50.000 --> 34:54.240]  josh is going to be joining me at the top of the hour alex is going to be here to talk about how
[34:54.240 --> 34:59.120]  important this is in the broader scheme of things at the bottom of the next hour and jerome coursey
[34:59.120 --> 35:04.960]  is going to be here in the third hour and he's going to spread this out for us as far as the
[35:04.960 --> 35:10.560]  crony capitalism involving china there were connections that we made here at info wars
[35:10.560 --> 35:14.640]  dot com and i'm going to come back to that article i was just starting to talk about the chronology
[35:14.640 --> 35:22.960]  about how things happened as i mentioned we were there on friday we were covering the the standoff
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.680]  the demonstrators we'd had several interviews you've probably seen those on the radio show here
[35:27.680 --> 35:32.560]  with alex jones as well as the nightly news we learned that there was going to be a demonstration
[35:32.560 --> 35:37.600]  at the sheriff's office because mr bundy said the way for this to come down peacefully is for the
[35:37.600 --> 35:43.120]  sheriff or the governor to do their job and it's very interesting you know governor sandoval had
[35:43.120 --> 35:48.960]  actually run against harry reed's son rory as republican he won you rory didn't want to put
[35:48.960 --> 35:55.360]  his last name on his signs i was told he just put the first name rory trying to i guess hide the his
[35:55.360 --> 36:01.280]  connection to read because outside of los vegas and the people who run the voting machines harry
[36:01.280 --> 36:06.800]  reed's not very popular at least not in the areas of nevada where we were but anyway sandoval
[36:06.800 --> 36:13.040]  won sandoval's republican and he did put out a statement that said no cow justifies the atmosphere
[36:13.040 --> 36:17.280]  of intimidation which currently exists nor the limitation of constitutional rights that are
[36:17.280 --> 36:23.040]  sacred to all nevadans he spoke out against these first amendment zones these first amendment areas
[36:23.040 --> 36:30.800]  that the blm created and they did take those down but he didn't do anything else he didn't order
[36:30.800 --> 36:37.360]  anybody to do anything else the sheriff was not doing anything else the sheriff was the legal law
[36:37.360 --> 36:42.880]  abiding authority in that area not the blm and so a lot of people went down to protest the sheriff
[36:42.880 --> 36:48.400]  to try to shame him into doing his job and that's a very long drive clark county is huge it's about a
[36:48.400 --> 36:53.840]  hour and a half drive from bunkerville down to los vegas a lot of people went down there there was
[36:53.840 --> 36:57.520]  a demonstration after that demonstration probably saw the video we went in and tried to get some
[36:57.520 --> 37:03.680]  information from the the public information officer there at the los vegas police department and
[37:03.680 --> 37:08.960]  they essentially have combined the metropolitan police force with the county police force so
[37:08.960 --> 37:15.200]  that was where the sheriff's office was in los vegas and he had authority all the way up to where
[37:15.200 --> 37:20.320]  bunkerville was an hour and a half away in this gigantic county and of course the public information
[37:20.320 --> 37:27.200]  officer would not answer any of our questions i was amazed that he didn't even have a printed
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.160]  propaganda statement to talk about the ranch situation he just said that's the ranch you
[37:32.160 --> 37:35.520]  know i'm not going to talk about that i don't even have a statement about that you know i didn't
[37:35.520 --> 37:41.040]  really go there thinking i was going to get any information from him i was going there to give
[37:41.040 --> 37:47.760]  him some information to tell him that we knew about harry reid's unethical connections to this
[37:47.760 --> 37:52.880]  chinese energy company and we knew what they were doing not just with the chinese energy company
[37:52.880 --> 37:58.800]  but with first solar which has already broken ground they're using the bundy ranch and they
[37:58.800 --> 38:03.600]  had mentioned the bundy ranch that was what broke on the story on friday and i was going there to
[38:03.600 --> 38:07.920]  give him that information to get his response of course he would not respond to anything to respond
[38:07.920 --> 38:13.760]  to the fact that we had found documents that had them talking about how they had to remove
[38:14.400 --> 38:19.360]  the bundy family and their quote unquote trespass cattle from that area in other words
[38:19.360 --> 38:26.480]  abrogate their rights before they could then get full rights to the surface as well as the
[38:26.480 --> 38:33.200]  mental rights to that area and that area is not necessarily where they're going to be building
[38:33.200 --> 38:38.880]  any of these solar projects those solar projects were further south but the bundy ranch was the
[38:38.880 --> 38:45.760]  mitigation area think about carbon tax credit carbon credit so they put up this was so that they
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.960]  could essentially tell people who were concerned they were using the environment as a pretense to
[38:50.960 --> 38:55.920]  do this so they want to tell people that even though they were going to mine in the other area
[38:55.920 --> 38:59.520]  or that even though they were going to put up these massive construction projects they were
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.240]  going to make the area where the bundy family was even more pristine so it's very important to them
[39:04.240 --> 39:11.200]  to keep their narrative going of course they're not really too concerned about the turtles and we
[39:11.200 --> 39:17.360]  found out about that but we went there to give the information to the public information officer
[39:17.360 --> 39:24.960]  but they don't have even a prepared statement now on our way back we stopped at 5 30 pacific time
[39:24.960 --> 39:31.600]  we stopped for a teleconference from the blm they have essentially a propaganda statement at the
[39:31.600 --> 39:36.080]  beginning of it and then they took questions from the press over the phone they didn't have any
[39:36.080 --> 39:43.120]  physical area where we could go and actually ask them questions and i read them the essentially the
[39:43.120 --> 39:49.920]  essence of the story about the solar power crony capitalism that was going on with harry reid
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.960]  enn asked them to comment on that because we wanted them to know that we understood that this was
[39:54.960 --> 40:00.800]  about removing the bundy family from that area so that they would no longer have anyone with any
[40:00.800 --> 40:06.080]  property rights in that area so that they could use that area as essentially a an environmental
[40:06.080 --> 40:10.160]  credit for what they wanted to do with these solar projects and of course they didn't comment on that
[40:10.160 --> 40:16.240]  but again it was a rhetorical question we were giving them the information telling them what we
[40:16.240 --> 40:21.440]  had discovered now as we got back to the area and as i reported earlier in the day they had
[40:21.440 --> 40:26.160]  removed the signs for the cattle guard crossings they had cattle guards at the entrance to this
[40:26.160 --> 40:32.480]  and they that were embedded into the roads so the cattle would not cross that they had signs
[40:32.480 --> 40:37.040]  warning vehicles about that those were removed they did not remove the open range sign that was
[40:37.040 --> 40:42.080]  right across in the demonstrators they knew better than to try to do that but the next morning
[40:42.880 --> 40:49.440]  they had overnight rethought this they saw the people gathering they saw how viral this was
[40:49.440 --> 40:55.520]  becoming they were very concerned the government decided that they were going to try a essentially
[40:55.520 --> 41:01.520]  a fate see if they would accept this so the sheriff came up that morning and as i said before we had
[41:01.520 --> 41:05.520]  an interview scheduled for him at eight o'clock they were in prayer about this nine o'clock meeting
[41:05.520 --> 41:12.480]  mr bundy did not want to meet with him in a closed room he said we're going to do this in public
[41:12.480 --> 41:17.920]  and it was amazing to see the sheriff show up with trembling hands reading the bureau of land
[41:17.920 --> 41:24.160]  management press release and the interesting thing was is that overnight they had put back those
[41:24.160 --> 41:32.320]  cattle crossing cattle guard signs they had had over the over the middle of the night they had
[41:32.320 --> 41:36.400]  put the signs back they had written the press release and he came back and said we're going
[41:36.400 --> 41:41.760]  to allow you to put your cattle on well of course they had captured a lot of his cattle at that
[41:41.760 --> 41:49.200]  point mr bundy said what we want you to do is to take the weapons of these people who have
[41:49.200 --> 41:53.280]  turned this into martial law that was essentially paraphrasing what he had to say then he said we
[41:53.280 --> 41:58.400]  want you to take down these checkpoints that they have used to attack and to taser people you know
[41:58.400 --> 42:05.360]  when we had this teleconference it was amazing to hear the national media and the inane questions
[42:05.360 --> 42:10.240]  that they had just things like uh were you keeping the cattle uh you know that type of thing it was
[42:10.240 --> 42:15.680]  a local media that was asking them things like you've responded to the video that we saw where
[42:15.680 --> 42:20.720]  people were tasered where they had dogs put on them but you have not responded to the woman who was
[42:20.720 --> 42:26.640]  attacked and thrown to the ground from behind by your agents no comment from the blm but we did
[42:26.640 --> 42:31.920]  have this comment that we got from them finally we had asked them so many times why are you turning
[42:31.920 --> 42:39.840]  this area into martial law and here's what they had to say i like turtles all right you're a great
[42:39.840 --> 42:45.840]  zombie and now that's right they like turtles they like turtles so much that they're killing
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.200]  fourteen hundred of them because they said they don't have enough money to feed them and yet they
[42:51.200 --> 42:57.200]  mount a multimillion dollar militarized operation against this family they had brand new trucks
[42:57.200 --> 43:00.800]  that they were driving down there of course you could always tell if you saw people carrying
[43:00.800 --> 43:05.200]  guns it's like well is this uh somebody that's there to support the bundies or is this somebody
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.280]  that is there with the government well if they had a brand spanking new car and they were from the
[43:09.280 --> 43:16.320]  government but they could spend millions of dollars to support this this operation but they
[43:16.320 --> 43:20.320]  didn't have the money to feed the turtles and of course at the same time they're being sued by
[43:20.320 --> 43:26.480]  environmentalists in california because the blm hasn't even filed reports for seven years about
[43:26.480 --> 43:32.320]  this tortoise now the idiocy of this is that you've got an area that has uh six hundred thousand
[43:32.320 --> 43:37.280]  square miles and they've got only now about nine hundred cattle as mr bundy pointed out they used to
[43:37.280 --> 43:43.200]  have fifty three ranches each of them with cattle there used to be sheep ranchers there with thousands
[43:43.200 --> 43:48.560]  of sheep on the hill and there were more desert turtles then than there are now clearly that is
[43:48.560 --> 43:53.920]  not the case we had a long interview that i conducted with a man named uh mr poppus who had
[43:53.920 --> 43:59.120]  been there throughout this time he even had a small turtle shell he said they had bags of these
[43:59.120 --> 44:05.040]  baby turtle shells that had basically been picked at from the top he said it was ravens and birds
[44:05.040 --> 44:09.040]  that were not native to the area that had come in and that were taking these small turtles out of
[44:09.040 --> 44:14.480]  their nests he believed that that was what was going on it clearly wasn't the ranchers the decline
[44:14.480 --> 44:20.880]  in turtle population happened at the time that they were declining the population of these of
[44:20.880 --> 44:27.440]  these uh cattle and clearly it hasn't come back at all in 20 years so there's something else going on
[44:27.440 --> 44:31.360]  as stefan malinu pointed out i don't know if we've got that clip or not it's important to remember
[44:31.360 --> 44:36.640]  that the federal government is very concerned about the tortoises uh and one of the ways they've
[44:36.640 --> 44:41.280]  expressed that concern over the past few decades is exploding hundreds of nuclear weapons over
[44:41.280 --> 44:46.720]  nevada in the nevada desert because as we all know if you have a tortoise shell you're fine
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.040]  right so i mean this is what they give people in nuclear attacks a tortoise shell so they've
[44:51.040 --> 44:56.080]  literally incinerated hundreds of thousands of these tortoises but now this guy's 150 had a
[44:56.080 --> 45:01.600]  cattle that they want to let on this land they fear the cover story is that they might uh interfere
[45:01.600 --> 45:07.120]  with some tortoise uh habitats uh it's all complete nonsense of course it's a mere exercise of power
[45:07.120 --> 45:12.080]  i've heard some rumors that it's about oil rights or fracking or solar panels and who knows maybe
[45:12.080 --> 45:18.160]  that's true maybe that's not but this is a mere exercise of of power uh to destroy that one of
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.480]  the last uh ranchers around he said originally they were like 52 53 other ranchers they've all
[45:22.480 --> 45:26.800]  been run off the land with these excessive grazing fees and then people say well why is food so
[45:26.800 --> 45:30.480]  expensive well because you got these ridiculous grazing fees from a government that has done
[45:30.480 --> 45:35.440]  nothing nothing whatsoever to actually own this land you know you and i want to own something but
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.760]  don't just get to sit there and say mine right you actually have to go earn the damn thing or
[45:39.760 --> 45:44.080]  build it or make it or enclose it or throw something on it and that also brings up the question as to
[45:44.080 --> 45:50.400]  what is legitimate law now here's a comment that my wife sent to me the guy says really you're happy
[45:50.400 --> 45:55.680]  that a law breaker got away with breaking the law law is law and bundy broke the law if bundy
[45:55.680 --> 45:59.440]  did in fact break the law and is wrong here he has to be held responsible well the question is
[46:00.320 --> 46:06.880]  how do we get legitimate law what is legitimate law now of course the legitimate law the law that
[46:06.880 --> 46:14.640]  all the laws are subject to is the constitution that is the ultimate law that is what law enforcement
[46:14.640 --> 46:20.320]  and the military swear allegiance to when they break their oath to that ultimate law when the
[46:20.320 --> 46:26.560]  legislators break their oath to that ultimate law they no longer have any authority so there is a
[46:26.560 --> 46:32.640]  legitimate path of authority but we also have some moral ethics here and christians should
[46:32.640 --> 46:36.560]  understand this that if we are going to stand by and they're showing up here on the screen
[46:36.560 --> 46:42.720]  dr martin luther king says never forget that everything hitler did in germany was legal
[46:42.720 --> 46:48.400]  are we going to say that because it was a law rosa parks needed to stay at the back of the bus
[46:49.040 --> 46:55.200]  there are higher moral laws that's what christians need to understand we have people like detrick
[46:55.200 --> 47:01.120]  bonhoeffer who stood against titler we had martin luther king who stood against unjust laws the
[47:01.120 --> 47:08.400]  laws need to be altered or abolished if they destroy people's rights if they're immoral if
[47:08.400 --> 47:13.120]  they're wrong the declaration of independence says we have certain inalienable rights we create
[47:13.120 --> 47:19.520]  governments to protect those rights when the governments destroy those rights we the people
[47:19.520 --> 47:25.920]  have the right and the duty to alter or abolish that government now i want to play have you guys
[47:25.920 --> 47:32.160]  get the the clip from uh steve bundy the um yes the one where they're talking about where he's
[47:32.160 --> 47:37.440]  talking about the court case there was a court case when this all started and understand that
[47:37.440 --> 47:44.640]  they've they've enjoyed surface rights grazing rights for 140 years and when the what the blm
[47:44.640 --> 47:49.680]  did and so that they could take this land and hand it over to their crony capitalist partners
[47:49.680 --> 47:53.040]  whether they're domestic corporations whether international corporations or whether it's
[47:53.040 --> 47:59.280]  chinese corporations it's all the same thing they used the code to shut these people down
[47:59.280 --> 48:04.160]  and what they did was when they said we're going to cut down your allotment the number of cattle
[48:04.160 --> 48:09.440]  that you can have by 90% and we're going to not allow you to go out in the three months that are
[48:09.440 --> 48:14.160]  the best months to graze the calving months that you need to be on the land we're not going to allow
[48:14.160 --> 48:19.520]  you to do that they were essentially putting these people out of business with the code the new code
[48:19.520 --> 48:24.080]  rules that they had enacted in order to protect the desert tortoise so the ranchers got together
[48:24.080 --> 48:30.320]  hired a lawyer hired scientists went to court because you know you should have a your day in
[48:30.320 --> 48:34.960]  court before they confiscate your property that's what they were essentially doing they were winning
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.800]  the argument this is in 1993 with their lawyer with the scientists that they had they were
[48:41.600 --> 48:47.440]  opposed by the blm by the epa by environmental groups who were standing up and uh every time
[48:47.440 --> 48:52.720]  they brought something up there was opposition clearly they were losing the case the judge was
[48:52.720 --> 48:59.600]  ruling in their favor over again at one point the blm got up and said you have no jurisdiction here
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.680]  and just walked out they realized they were losing the case and they just walked out let's play that
[49:03.680 --> 49:12.800]  from and during this whole case the blm's lawyers the state of nevada's lawyers the conservation
[49:12.800 --> 49:18.640]  group we had all the greenies there every one of their lawyers got up to speak every time anything
[49:18.640 --> 49:24.800]  was said and after they had lost the case obviously they stood up the only thing they had to say was
[49:24.800 --> 49:35.920]  you have no jurisdiction over epa law and there were no rights to oppose the epa in any regulation
[49:36.480 --> 49:42.720]  you have no federal recourse in the law and he had this had this situation where he's already
[49:42.720 --> 49:48.000]  paid for the grazing out here this fee that they're charging him to just a arbitrary fee they say
[49:48.000 --> 49:53.520]  well you can put that many cows out there and it's gonna cost you this much and next week it's
[49:53.520 --> 49:58.800]  something else and then next week it was well you could have put out 150 cows now you can put
[49:58.800 --> 50:06.080]  out 50 and you can either comply and go out of business as they've done to all of the ranchers
[50:06.080 --> 50:12.640]  around all of the people on the land they want to completely be able to control this in regulation
[50:12.640 --> 50:19.040]  i don't know that that's their plan but that's what's happened to our country and one at a time
[50:19.040 --> 50:24.800]  they can take out anyone in this country that opposes them that's right that's exactly what
[50:24.800 --> 50:31.120]  it's about it's a gradual infringement process it's about regulations created by bureaucracies that
[50:31.120 --> 50:37.280]  are unaccountable to us unanswerable to us they are not on the ballot we have regulation without
[50:37.280 --> 50:43.120]  representation we have bureaucracies with armies to come out and enforce that we have courts where
[50:43.120 --> 50:48.080]  we have no presumption of innocence we're going to be right back that is the key that is happening
[50:48.080 --> 50:52.720]  to every business across the country he's in a timeshare business and they're putting them
[50:52.720 --> 50:59.520]  out of business with regulations we'll be right back stay tuned

[54:17.840 --> 54:24.960]  ranch standoff josh owens and i just got back and it was an amazing victory a victory for people who
[54:24.960 --> 54:31.600]  stood up against the gradual infringement of their rights and really questioned do they have the
[54:31.600 --> 54:38.320]  authority to put people off of their property got together looked them in the eye and the feds
[54:38.320 --> 54:43.360]  moved down and alex jones is right here that was an amazing victory alex it was incredible and i'm
[54:43.360 --> 54:48.400]  i'm as proud of this as anything we've ever done yesterday covering this on the sunday show and
[54:48.400 --> 54:53.920]  then of course saturday watching them alive you stream it was so historic and i realized that when
[54:54.560 --> 54:57.600]  bundy told a thousand people we're going to walk through we're going to march through
[54:58.160 --> 55:02.960]  that this could have easily turned into lexington or concord yes the shot heard around the world and
[55:03.680 --> 55:08.640]  there's a video at the bottom of jerome coursey's article on world net daily that i wanted to play
[55:08.640 --> 55:14.560]  that i think i sent you yes um where a rancher a few days before gives a speech and he says listen
[55:14.560 --> 55:19.040]  i'm not going with guns if they're going to shoot me that'll be the shot heard around the world they
[55:19.040 --> 55:25.200]  fire that will fire the rest and the feds realize they didn't have the moral high ground this this
[55:25.200 --> 55:28.720]  this event that happened is literally i'm going to talk about this at the bottom of the next hour
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.040]  after josh comes in is a rosetta stone for those that know what the rosetta stone is
[55:33.040 --> 55:37.360]  it was discovered and it was basically the way to decode these hieroglyphs that they could never
[55:37.360 --> 55:44.000]  understand before and this is a rosetta stone this is exactly what's happened in the texas revolution
[55:44.000 --> 55:49.600]  in the 1776 revolution this is the kind of stuff that led to brush fire rebellions that led to
[55:49.600 --> 55:55.760]  magna carta 1215 this is the kind of stuff that led the israelites out of egypt with moses same
[55:55.760 --> 56:03.760]  story i mean this this is the human story it transcends america and the victory is the the
[56:03.760 --> 56:07.840]  imagery you couldn't ask for better propaganda for freedom and propaganda doesn't mean lies it's
[56:07.840 --> 56:13.760]  just gotten a bad connotation it's truthful info war of good-looking you know hardworking
[56:13.760 --> 56:18.320]  farmers and folks coming together real militia with their guns with the guns at their side
[56:18.320 --> 56:23.360]  marching towards men saying we're going to shoot you with their police dogs and all the rest of it
[56:23.360 --> 56:29.360]  knowing they were in the wrong standing down the blm deciding to be good like the troops in
[56:29.360 --> 56:34.080]  in v for vendetta yes not shooting when the people peacefully walk towards them and that
[56:34.080 --> 56:38.800]  eventually that essentially happened in east germany as well at one point when the people got
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.360]  together churches exactly they got together in the churches they marched to the fences and the
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.600]  border guards had been shooting people trying to get over the fences in east germany stood down
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.120]  and refused the orders and the whole government collapsed the whole criminal illegitimate regime
[56:51.120 --> 56:56.640]  collapsed and we want the republic back we want the new world order system to collapse and again
[56:56.640 --> 57:01.680]  for those that don't know blm to don't know range rights if you come in you're a rancher and you
[57:01.680 --> 57:05.360]  want to buy grazing rights and no one has a claim and they have a clear claim that's why
[57:05.360 --> 57:11.520]  blm tried to buy it from him then they can sell those rights if they're the manager in the steward
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.640]  they were not the manager in the steward their family as the antecedent i guess be the term
[57:16.640 --> 57:21.840]  are the progenitors of that the first claim it's a hundred percent in common law in state law that's
[57:21.840 --> 57:28.000]  why bundy's so mad and then you see the ignorant public going that guy's not paying taxes for that
[57:28.000 --> 57:34.720]  he paid taxes seven generations in blood putting in the water tanks putting in his ancestors that's
[57:34.720 --> 57:39.440]  the essence of owning property none of us own our houses anymore with property tax that's right the
[57:39.440 --> 57:45.600]  Rockefellers all get waivers and are exempt if folks look it up you pay a tax to have your car
[57:45.600 --> 57:53.280]  registered now they're raising that putting people out of their cars you pay a tax uh on your home
[57:53.280 --> 57:56.480]  most people i know can't pay their property taxes they're taking old people's houses because they
[57:56.480 --> 58:02.560]  can't pay it you don't really own your house this is what feudalism is and so the next 30 minutes
[58:02.560 --> 58:07.280]  you'll break this down josh owens was a real hero everybody that was there was a hero to march towards
[58:08.000 --> 58:13.040]  people pointing guns at you saying we will shoot who had just attacked dog and and tasered people
[58:13.040 --> 58:17.920]  and thrown women to the ground i mean this is a big deal you guys like vitro vendetta that's a movie
[58:17.920 --> 58:21.920]  this is real walked into this and they said no we're not letting the cattle go get out of here
[58:21.920 --> 58:26.480]  and we said all right we're coming through and so they you guys tore the gates down and marched
[58:26.480 --> 58:31.200]  over going to break we're coming back i'll break it all down at the bottom of the next hour this
[58:31.200 --> 58:35.600]  is historic this is all america's victory and we defeated the mainstream media and their fraud
[58:35.600 --> 58:46.320]  we expose harry reid it it's the key we'll be back thank you for listening to gcm visit gcmlive.com today
[58:50.160 --> 58:55.520]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more
[58:55.520 --> 59:00.560]  and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside that's toxic indoor air has
[59:00.560 --> 59:04.800]  been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor
[59:04.800 --> 59:10.320]  air and most americans spend 90 of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[59:10.320 --> 59:15.280]  there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of
[59:15.280 --> 59:20.240]  mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that six million americans
[59:20.240 --> 59:24.720]  live with pets they're allergic to as well when i began to research these statistics it was clear
[59:24.720 --> 59:30.320]  to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we
[59:30.320 --> 59:35.520]  cannot escape but that we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and
[59:35.520 --> 59:41.040]  manufactured in the usa the new info wars live lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle

[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.480]  i'm joined here in studio with josh oh and josh and i just got back from the bundy ranch in
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:39.040]  nevada the showdown at bunkerville this was an amazing precedent for so long i've been following
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:43.680]  these stories i've seen people brutalize i've seen martial law enacted one place after the other i've
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:49.600]  seen them incrementally taking people's rights away whether it's their free speech rights whether
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:53.200]  it's their fourth amendment rights their sixth amendment rights their second amendment rights
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.560]  even their first amendment rights the government is taking all of our rights taking our property
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:05.520]  rights that was what was at stake here this is much much bigger than just one rancher and his
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:12.000]  grazing fees and the tortoises that they were using as a pretense to shut these ranchers down
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.720]  now we've got uh josh oh as we're going to be talking to this half hour at the bottom of the
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.720]  half hour alex jones is going to be joining us and at the top of the next hour we're going to
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:27.520]  be joined with gerome coursey and he's going to be talking about the massive crony capitalism
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.840]  that is actually motivating these corrupt politicians to do these types of things to people
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:37.120]  and we're going to be talking about how it's not just here but it's many many other places
[01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:40.640]  according to his research and according to reports that we've had at info wars here he
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.600]  wrote a story when to get him on to talk about the extensive tentacles of the chinese government
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.600]  the deals that they're making with obama to sell off the land to give them title to the land because
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:57.920]  they now essentially own america with this debt that they've bought up so it's a big story this
[01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:04.720]  is being used like carbon credits the bundy ranch had two things going for it one of them was that
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.520]  they needed to get them out of there one of them was that they needed it for essentially carbon
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.040]  credits for mitigation as they call it as they were going to develop these projects throughout
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:21.360]  the area whether it's a solar power projects or whether it is mining minerals or fracking or whatever
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.440]  for all the things that they wanted to do to the land that the government claims ownership of
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:32.640]  they wanted to have the bundy area used as a mitigation area as a place it was going to be
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:39.360]  extra pristine the other part about it was that he had grazing and water rights and if the
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:44.400]  federal government can come in and take his grazing and water rights that his family has had for
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:51.360]  generations they can come in and take your rights at your suburban home they've already done it with
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:56.800]  the property taxes that weren't that weren't in all 50 states the last 30 years yes you do not own
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:01.440]  your house that's right and it's the same thing with this washington times just came out and they
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:06.640]  basically have harry reeds people it's up on drudgereport.com admitting that it was the stories
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:11.360]  coming out about reed connected to this is why the orders came down and that's the liberals
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.640]  saying that because they're like your guns didn't make us back down harry reed told us to well no
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.200]  kidding that's why we did this so there wouldn't be bloodshed that's right on friday i was trying
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.160]  to figure out a way to try to not have a standoff and a bunch of killing and i'm not taking credit
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:31.120]  i'm all i'm saying is we dug into reed he was involved drudge linked to it it was the number
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:36.800]  one story saturday on the internet the number fifth story uh on sunday well the story broke
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.760]  as we were talking in overdrive and then we went down and and gave the information to the sheriff's
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:46.480]  office then we called up the blm on a teleconference and gave them the information and then everything
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:50.560]  changed overnight here's the article right here and it's later in here where they had made it all

[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.760]  with the story that kit daniels wrote we had just alex had covered it uh as we were talking to him
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.800]  live at the site he covered it in overdrive it's very excited about it and from there we went down
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:35.840]  to novata and now we're out of time i'm going to be right back with josh i was about to give him

[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.040]  country and by the way you guys kind of like confederate generals together in here i think
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:58.480]  that's racist cut the bears off
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:05.280]  the globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:10.800]  making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive all the major networks are state runs

[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:26.400]  through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:31.200]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more important than ever to realize that we

[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.120]  there's an interesting story that's just come up on the washington times and they are saying that
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:36.480]  the uh it left little doubt that there was a highly charged episode was threatening to become a

[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:48.560]  this is actually the uh the statement that corns put out they said it was likely pressure from
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.920]  upstairs rather than weapons from the field that changes mind on the matter this is americans against
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:58.080]  the tea party that's a liberal group that said that so they believe that it was harry reed that
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.200]  made this stand out because the order josh came from the guy who had been his senior policy advisor
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.080]  who is now the director at the blm uh neil corns and he's the one that called the stand down and
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:15.680]  and of course neil corns has been a harry reed guy from the very beginning and he also has extensive
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:21.760]  connections with the uh in the mineral industry his father uh was worked with a lot of gold and
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:27.920]  mining companies he sets on the board of directors of very many mining companies he's all about getting
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:32.240]  the resources in that area that the federal government is claiming ownership of but
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:36.400]  we saw a dramatic turnaround when we were there on friday and i want you to talk about this when
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:40.800]  we were there on friday they had already taken down the cattle crossing guards even though there
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:45.600]  was a lot of national press and even by friday cnn was there pushing back against what was really
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.760]  going on they were trying to push the government's narrative you had a lot of national press there by
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:57.520]  that time uh as in addition to us they had put in uh fox news and cnn had shown up but they were
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:03.680]  moving forward with their agenda and then as we were talking live to alex here kit daniels brought
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.240]  up the story and again it was something that was first reported on a couple of years ago but what
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:15.360]  kit daniels found what were the connections between these solar projects that they wanted to do and the
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:20.720]  bundy ranch being a mitigation area where they were going to use it like carbon credits and then
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:25.120]  we went down to uh nvah to uh los vegas to the sheriff's office told them what happened there
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:29.840]  well i'm sure people have seen the video and if not you can look you can see it it was on the
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:34.720]  website it's on youtube we walk in and ask a simple question and they were unprepared to answer a
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.720]  question i mean that was their job it was their job to answer questions and they weren't prepared to
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.760]  do it so they wanted to speak with us outside and they showed the amazing thing that really got me
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:47.520]  angry we went down basically to give them information we're going to ask a rhetorical question about
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.680]  this corruption and the links to it and of course we knew that sheriff gillespie had deep long ties
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.480]  with harry reid anybody that's in high office there has ties to harry reid okay and we wanted
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:03.040]  to talk to him about the fact that harry reid's son was a lobbyist you know we we wanted to
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.720]  essentially present the facts to him that we had that kit daniels had put into the story
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.560]  he kind of cut us off and said if this is about the ranch we've got nothing to say and i said well
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:16.800]  then give me your press release they didn't even have a press release but go ahead that at that
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.960]  point it got us really angry when he said let's talk about this outside yeah well and it should
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.840]  have it should have i think the biggest thing that people who weren't there people who don't
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:30.640]  something that people didn't realize is that it took a lot of courage for this family to stand
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.880]  up and keep saying no yes no we're not going to pay the fees to the federal government
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:41.680]  and then they surround their house and no we're not going to stop and then they come and they
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:48.160]  they throw their sons on the ground they arrest them they taze them they throw the woman with
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:53.600]  cancer they sling her and slam her onto the ground it was all like monday and tuesday this was as the
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:59.120]  story was breaking nationally you know this has been going on of course for 20 years yeah and but
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.440]  it's just now that they're coming in and that's another thing that tells us something about that
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:11.360]  and that's the timing first solar just broke ground with harry reid and another area and they've got
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.680]  right there in uh nevada and they need this area to have their quote unquote solar mitigation to
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:23.760]  keep this pretense about protecting the tortoises there as well as to get his to take the last
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.080]  rancher standing to take his rights that's what they've been doing all this time it's that kind of
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:34.000]  incrementalism that they do against all of us yeah well i think that bottom line we see so many
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.680]  people who are ignorant and so many people who uh don't have that fight aren't willing to stand up
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:43.920]  because they believe that they don't have power or a lot of them just don't care but then when you go
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:49.520]  and you see these kind of people are willing to stand up and they're willing to i mean they
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:52.640]  were not going to back down and they're still not going to back down they've come out and they've
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.040]  said yeah we know that the war isn't over that's right the war isn't over it was a battle we won
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.960]  this battle and when they come again we're going to do the same thing again that that's the thing
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.320]  that that i'm concerned about i see a lot of people pushing back and they they say you think this
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.320]  is over of course we don't think it's over we know it's not over they know it's not over
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:15.120]  the battle for america is not over we still have a system here where we've got many many
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.920]  government agencies a whole alphabet soup of government agencies who are writing their own
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:25.200]  laws who have their own militarized police force who have their own courts you have no presumption
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:31.840]  of innocence this is the problem it's not just the people who this is an agenda 21 portion but
[01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.080]  they've got so many different areas where they're doing the same thing just look at the income taxes
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:42.560]  tomorrow is april 15th okay look at how just this last week they broke a story that the irs is going
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:48.480]  to go back and tax people for tax debts that their parents had so they've always come after
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.200]  spouses for debts that their spouses have had even if uh you know people are separated now
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:58.480]  they're going to come after you for things that they presume that your parents had and that's the
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.280]  kind of thing we see that kind of encroachment that we see going on and on how do we stop that
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  well i think we stop it just like these people stopped the federal government from coming in
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:13.360]  and taking their land up until now and obviously it's not over but we don't i mean these people
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.160]  could have started they could have started paying their grazing fees they could have said well
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.520]  you know it's not you know it's not worth our time it's not worth our energy because obviously
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:25.200]  it would have been easier for them not in the long run because they're going to incrementally keep
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:29.200]  taking everything and everything and i think there's nothing left and they understood that yeah and
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:32.960]  but this family could have just said well we'll pay our fees and then we'll be able you know i mean
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.400]  we'll be able to have our time we'll be able to sit inside and you know we'll be able to relax
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:44.480]  and that's i mean that wasn't the case i mean if you saw this family they were exhausted i mean
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.600]  they were to the point where i mean of course i'm sure that they're tired of of this going on
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:54.080]  but they're not going to stop and they're not going to stand down and we saw that when the
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:59.520]  sheriff came and when the sheriff finally broke his silence that cliven you know everyone was
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.840]  cheering you know yeah the blm's leaving but he said no that's not it that's not all we want
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.160]  disarm the park service yes tear down these buildings where you're you're forcing us to
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.400]  pay to go on our own land and the sheriff was standing there shaking and he was scared because
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.520]  he saw someone that wasn't just saying all right you're giving us a little bit now we're going
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:21.440]  to back off and the sheriff never did his job no he never he never got rid of the blm he never
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:25.360]  protected the people who are being robbed by the federal government who are being attacked
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.360]  by the federal government who are having guns pointed at him look folks it's a serious thing
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:34.160]  when somebody puts a gun in your face yeah and when you've got sniper nests pointed at you
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.320]  that's a very serious thing and they had already is josh pointed out they'd tasered them they'd
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.920]  stuck dogs on them they had arrested them taken them to the ground uh dav bundy was arrested
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.920]  before the guys were tasered multiple times these guys shook off the tasers they kept coming
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.080]  and just like we're talking about the the motto of the texas rangers you know when the guy in the
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.120]  right keeps on coming he's always going to take down the guy who is in the wrong that's what we
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:04.000]  saw happening very meek person wouldn't you say that they're they're kind of like uh kind of like
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.920]  ron paul i said earlier but a backbone of steel and that was true of his sons as well of amon
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:14.880]  and of uh davin of ryan these guys were the ones that were out front that were standing up and
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:20.080]  talking to people when amon was back there he was keeping everybody calm he was saying we don't
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.320]  need guns we don't need to be afraid of them now there were people that were in other areas that
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.760]  were carrying guns i mean we've been at uh many uh rallies were civil rights rallies where people
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.240]  are standing up for their open carry rallies and uh one of my sons said i've been i've filmed three
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:38.400]  rallies and the only one where he got attacked was where people weren't carrying guns so there is
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:41.920]  something there not even pointing guns at him but knowing that there are people in the crowd that
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:48.880]  do have guns but for the most part people were unarmed and just refusing to comply with unlawful
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:54.960]  orders and we stared them down and they left and it was amazing to see these guys backing up there's
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:17:00.640]  the clip of them backing up yeah i think the fact is is that there were a group of people who had
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.840]  guns pointed at them and they were saying we are going to shoot you we are going to use lethal force
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:11.040]  and they didn't back down it's not just a victory for this family it's a victory for the human spirit
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:16.560]  that these people were willing to stand up and keep moving forward and not stop and as you can see
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:21.680]  from the report that you that you put together and again josh was up all hours of the night trying to
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:26.080]  get this stuff together because they shut down that's an interesting point and they shut down
[01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:30.160]  the cell phone service in that area for the first several days that we were there in the protest area
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:34.720]  and when somebody wrote a report about how it was had been shut down and the bundy family backed
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:40.720]  that up said yeah we used to have a pretty good service out here on friday uh we had i'm sorry on
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:45.040]  saturday we had good coverage we were able to livestream from the area and that got red linked
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:49.920]  by drudge that was the first day that we were able to livestream from the area for some reason we
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:54.720]  were able to do it with skype but we could not get our phones to livestream up until saturday from
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:00.800]  that area so that changed but it was amazing to see these guys back down if you see that picture
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:05.440]  that we just showed up there as them walking back when they gave up they were kind of walking
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:08.880]  backwards they would not turn their their backs on the crowd because they were afraid of the crowd
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.760]  and when you see that guy with the mustache and the uh and the beard and the um sunglasses come
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:20.720]  up to parley they were afraid of amon they were trying to create the terms and and the bundies
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:26.480]  would not take their terms they kept saying taking the initiatives essentially what the
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.920]  government what the uh uh people always try to do is to say little things like say i want you to
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.600]  stand over here i want you to come this way let's uh go over here to talk just just they were giving
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:39.520]  the orders yeah exactly but the bundies were giving the orders the bundies were taking the
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.000]  initiative and when when people are showing these homeland security documents and and maybe they're
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.480]  genuine maybe they're not i don't know homeland security may come out and say well this is our
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:53.040]  plan all along and i'm sure that they are going to be back but i'll tell you what they were not
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:57.680]  expecting that you know that they were not expecting it no it took them completely by surprise that we
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:02.880]  went to get the cattle yeah oh absolutely yeah and the fact that that that guy i don't know who he
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:07.200]  was blm whatever he was the guy with the beard with the glasses yeah he was like we're trying to
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.200]  de-escalate the situation we're trying to make you guys you know we're trying to make this safe
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:14.800]  while they're guys standing behind and pointing guns at us saying that if you come any closer
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:20.560]  you're going to get shot and amon said uh no uh you you're going to leave those are the terms
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:25.440]  you leave that's right and i heard that it bothered me so much to go back to uh the motel rooms
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:30.320]  were downloading the footage uh transcoding the footage i flipped on the news and i saw
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:35.920]  box news reporting this and basically saying that they stood this down because they were
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.000]  concerned about the safety of the public they were the ones pointing guns at us we weren't
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.360]  pointing guns at them the people down there and the trenches were unarmed or they had their guns
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:49.280]  shouldered uh holstered like uh ryan there we're going to be right back with josh owens we're going

[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.360]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight joined in studio here with
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:23.600]  josh owens we just got back from the standoff in bunkerville nevada where people stood up
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:28.960]  to federal agents pointing loaded guns at us threatening to kill us threatening to shoot
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:34.080]  threatening to use lethal force if we did not leave the area they said they had a court order
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:40.000]  josh yeah oh yeah they had a court order to use lethal force to kill everyone out there right and
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.440]  i mean the people that were on the other side of the fence the citizens and the bundies they
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:50.640]  weren't standing behind shields that's right but the other guys they had their doors open they were
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:55.600]  standing behind shields because they're cowards full body armor helmets and standing behind their
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:00.880]  doors standing behind their vehicles with a loud speaker saying go away go away it was amazing because
[01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:06.800]  there were so many of us and we outnumbered them by so many they truly were afraid even though
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.760]  they had their their shields their body armor their weapons pointed at us and their loud speaker
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:17.040]  threatening us about their supposed court order you know they they were very much afraid and it
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:22.560]  was great to see them backing up they would not turn their backs on us as we shouted at them
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:27.280]  we were not threatening them they were threatening us and yet the way they put this out from the
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:31.520]  blm press release and the way it was reported by the mainstream media was that they were worried
[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:35.360]  about the safety of the public they were the ones pointing guns at us they were the ones
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:41.040]  threatening to shoot us we were the ones walking to them with arms up in the air with uh with flags
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:47.040]  in the air it was a v for vendetta moment but with cowboys on horses it was it was a great moment
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:53.920]  let me talk about this uh where we go from this because we've got obama care that's been put in
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:26:01.200]  by a lawful court order is it legal just because the supreme court justice says this just because
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:06.880]  roberts who had already written an opinion saying that it was not legal then for some reason maybe
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:12.640]  it was one of the first cases of the nsa blackmailing somebody who knows because we see right after
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:17.920]  that we saw things happening with patrice was it the first instance of them blackmailing somebody
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:24.960]  because we've got the supreme court justice roberts writing both the the majority opinion
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.320]  and the dissenting opinion reversing himself very dramatically and so does that then alter the
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:35.040]  constitution we can read the constitution we know that the government does not have the right to
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.240]  force us to buy something what they don't have any rights they're not specifically given to them
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.480]  that's why they went through the motions of doing a constitutional amendment to create the income tax
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.400]  that tomorrow is a day that they want everybody to file the income tax when they did that they made
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.640]  it about income and that was very different from wages then they extended it during world war two
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:00.800]  to wages said they were going to do it temporarily then they kept that on now they put on obama
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.760]  care and said they're going to use the irs on obama care how do we get out of this well there's a
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:14.160]  good example back in november 15th jury nullification jury nullification go for your trial stand up
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:19.680]  for each other that's the thing that we learned yesterday is that if we can't get we can't count
[01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.280]  on rand paul or ted cruz to stand up there and dismantle obama care we certainly can't count on
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.760]  the republican leadership like baner they love this kind of new power that it gives over us
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:34.960]  they love to transfer money from the american people property from the american people to their
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:40.480]  corporate masters that's essentially what was going on here as well it's the same type of
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:46.960]  things the same patterns being put everywhere in this particular case you had a woman who owed no
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:53.600]  taxes but she refused to sign the form the irs wanted her to fill it out using their numbers and
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.480]  their numbers of course were zero she said she wasn't going to do that and so what they did was
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:05.600]  they took her to court charged her with contempt and this is what the judge said this is how she
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.920]  instructed the jury she said that it's not a defense to the crime of contempt that the court
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:15.680]  order was unlawful or unconstitutional you hear that it doesn't matter if what i'm telling you is
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:22.320]  unlawful and unconstitutional you do it and that's the attitude we saw out there with the blm it
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:30.880]  doesn't matter the law is in our mouth okay it's a fiat law it's a dictatorship yeah i think what
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:34.720]  was the ruling it was a marbury versus madison i could be wrong about that where it said that if
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.960]  it's unconstitutional then you don't have to follow the law yeah well you know what we're
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:44.000]  seeing here with this is essentially we have to understand what the constitution is we have to
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.840]  understand when the laws are counterfeit or when they're just fiat okay when they're fiat laws
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:53.680]  we need to know what the real law is so we can stand it down now the question is
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:58.320]  what do we do about obama care in this particular case in this lady's case just because she would
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:04.720]  not sign the form they take her to jail they're trying to put her in jail and they're instructing
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:10.320]  the jury that it doesn't matter if what i tell you is unlawful and unconstitutional well you
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:17.840]  know what there was one juror who stood up even though he was hounded by the prosecutor's office
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:25.200]  he stood up nullified this it takes one person out of 12 only eight percent to stand up yeah well
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:29.840]  what what i see a lot is when we go out on the street do these men on the streets and people ask
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.640]  well yeah this this stuff is going on but what are we supposed to do about it look at this family
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:38.720]  look what they did this is what you do about it you don't sit down you don't take the easy way
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:42.160]  that's right we're going to be right back we're going to be joined at the bottom of the hour

[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:20.480]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night and
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:27.520]  we've been talking about the standoff and the stand down of the militarized blm presence there they
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.520]  essentially had martial law no free speech anybody that steps foot on there on the king's land is
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:40.720]  going to immediately be taken down tased arrested brutalized sniper nests observation posts it was
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:46.560]  martial law even though they didn't declare it and what took it down a vigilant people people
[01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:51.760]  showing up people understanding what was going on and of course the reports about the crony
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.320]  capitalism and the corruption and harry reid's involvement in it that's the story that's coming
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:00.960]  out and that's the narrative that's the understanding of the other people they said this has been
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:07.200]  taken down this is orders from on high because of course the head of the blm now neil corns was
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.320]  one of the senior policy advisors for harry reid just as his son was a chief lobbyist for one of
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:18.160]  these solar projects and alex they needed to get the rights to that area so they could use it like
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:23.440]  carbon credits so they could take off his property rights so they could put their property on there
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:28.080]  and sell it off as the kind of crony capitalism and we're going to have drum coursey joining us
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:33.680]  at the top of the hour talking about how the chinese government is trying to do this in myriad ways
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:38.880]  throughout the country well that's right and that's why this is such a big deal that's why it's
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:43.520]  really a keystone or a rosetta stone because as i said when i popped in earlier i want to
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:49.760]  recap that and then walk through this for folks why it's so important it's a propaganda victory
[01:34:49.760 --> 01:34:56.080]  for liberty if they would have shot 100 of those people it would have been a victory for liberty
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:35:00.880]  but would have probably started a physical revolution so we don't want that to happen but
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:05.120]  we would have had the moral high ground when the revolution starts to restore the republic
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:12.480]  like and could have uh into the civil war a lot quicker than if they stage new oklahoma city
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:19.440]  to blame on us to make us look bad to start the civil war preemptively where they have the jump
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:25.920]  and this is how governments and systems think uh if you go back to egypt and and the israelites
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:33.840]  coming out it was over land and abuse and and torture and and and uprisings moses um if you
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.920]  look at what happened in 1989 in east germany uh that you mentioned earlier and we've had former
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.080]  members of the ostasi secret police on who hated the regime didn't like what was going on or ordered
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:48.640]  to arrest or shoot people that tried to get out of the country or get out of east berlin uh they
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:55.440]  finally just stood down they finally just uh you know did their job and so the berlin wall
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:36:02.400]  came down we saw this in romania with celcescu right around the same time where the the ministry
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:06.480]  police ramming their guns at the people and the people started marching forward they shot a few
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:11.440]  but then the other guards got really freaked out in the police and threw their guns down
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:15.200]  or turned their guns on the military started shooting them let me interject something here one
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.320]  of the bundy daughters said she went over and she talked to one of these uh guys who was one of
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.160]  the vehicles i think it was the night when they had stopped it i'm not sure exactly the time but
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:29.200]  she doesn't matter just yeah and she said are you why are you doing this don't you understand
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:33.440]  what's going on here he goes yeah i don't want to be doing this but it's my job she said are you
[01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:39.840]  proud of this he says my grandfather would be so ashamed of me at this point he understood
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:46.000]  that what he was doing was wrong he was this close to doing the right thing because there is a higher
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.800]  law that's right higher moral law plus he has the grazing rights i mean see it's just like
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.080]  if people stop paying property taxes people go well that's the law property tax is from feudal
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:01.360]  europe and feudal japan yes it means you didn't own your land it meant you were a renter it is a
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:06.240]  government rent we did not have it anywhere in the u.s till about a hundred years ago it's only
[01:37:06.240 --> 01:37:12.000]  been phased in nationwide the last 30 years but people now think that's normal bundy's like my
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  family's been here forever we have the grazing rights we've never paid it he goes i'll pay it to
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.080]  the state and and he's saying that's legitimate i don't think that's legitimate i don't think the
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.120]  state even though it's more legitimate than the feds trumps something that you've had on record but
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:30.080]  but this is the same thing this is the domestication process it's why they don't want lemonade stands
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.720]  it's why they don't want local farmers markets it's why they harass them because the big corporations
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:43.200]  want to shut down so so here's the larger issue worldwide from berma to mexico from the united
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:50.720]  states in nevada uh to areas of europe they're banning cook stoves they're banning wood stoves uh
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:56.960]  they are forcing indigenous populations off of their land and people don't know why mexico
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:03.040]  mexico city doubled in size the last 30 years it's because they force more than 10 million people
[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:09.520]  who own their land but live there so long they would say well where's your deed well my great
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:13.760]  great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:19.200]  grandfather you know going back a thousand years we're all buried here and the town's named after
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:24.960]  me doesn't matter mexican troops came in forced them off only place they couldn't force them off was
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:32.320]  chiapas because they fought and they're still fighting okay now if you expand that the last
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:36.320]  one went to kozumel and i won't go there anymore i've been there probably 25 times and they forced
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:40.080]  them all into the city which is the agenda 20 used to you saw fishermen out there i wonder why
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:46.400]  they were all mean now unhappy poor everybody was freaked out and uh well you my dad speaks Spanish
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:49.600]  and stuff and talked to them they said no we've all the last five six years we're not allowed
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.520]  my parents have gone with me the family you know a trip down there a few years ago we're not allowed
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:39:00.160]  to fish anymore only the big factory trawlers are and but but then look here they have limits on us
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:05.760]  fishing but not the big trawlers see it's the globalist shutting everything down so and we
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:13.280]  learned it's china it's harry reid it's the blm head they're all involved in this it's totally
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:18.560]  illegal on on its face just like all the other scams they run so just like obama care just like
[01:39:18.560 --> 01:39:24.560]  obama care so it's a jenna 21 takeover and the public so ignorant they're now saying it's a
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:30.240]  privilege to be a parent it's a privilege to own a gun it's not a privilege to travel but the average
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:35.280]  cop goes it's a privilege for you to travel no it's not if i'm in commerce it is a commerce
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:40.400]  clause see we have the federal and state rulings we're informed and that's what i see everybody
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.280]  pushing back they're saying the government had rights the government owned this land he has a
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.920]  privilege he has permission he violated that they can remove that we don't have any rights anymore we
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:53.440]  only have permissions and privileges according and that's why when you the government owns things
[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.960]  only the government has rights exactly and that's why when you go to national park or some place
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.680]  which this wasn't even that they let you know you're lucky to be here because it's all they know
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.320]  they've stolen it all so they're guilty so they want to make you feel guilty to accept it but to
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:11.840]  explain this to people 90 percent of nevada it was 90 it was 87 90 percent of nevada's federal
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:19.040]  federally managed but then they want to charge you and all the rest of the come on it so they
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:24.240]  can spend three four five million dollars to to to go up for some guy in his his cattle
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:29.600]  in a millennium no it's about them putting the solar farms just south of him and in the expansion
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:33.680]  phase two ago it does go to closeness property and then as you said this is the buffer zone
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:38.640]  if you read the new york times last year paul watson wrote about it they have a mercenary
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:44.880]  groups for the un going in to uganda and literally burning and killing villages when they won't leave
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:51.680]  shooting people the new york times admitted this to take their ancestral uh native lands off limits
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:58.320]  so they can have mines and strip mining and clear cutting next door and an imf world bank controlled
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.080]  project so you understand it's the exact same thing it's the same program worldwide and the new
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:08.800]  york times talked about the mercenaries lining people up and shooting them and i tell people
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.680]  who who love the un and you know every model has to give me you know and girls all wear the un
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:17.360]  shirts because they care about the kids that you know the hey the un's running extermination programs
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:24.880]  under african they don't even believe it till you show them till you show them uh the actual
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:30.640]  documentation till you show them what's going on so this is a world fight here and the point is
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:36.400]  at ruby ridge they killed the people at waco they burned them down and killed the people
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:41.120]  at all these modern events the feds have not backed down and it's blown up in their face
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:48.160]  see we went either way but we don't want people to die and the the historic magnitude of i would say
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.160]  have close to a thousand people there did you say oh yeah close to hundreds of people on horseback
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:58.960]  um massing and people on loudspeaker saying we're going to shoot you you come up to the fences and
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:04.800]  they say back off and we'll leave no we're not tear down the fences march in with guys up on the
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:09.280]  berms snipers armored vehicles you guys are so close you're only showing part of it there on the
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:15.520]  video for tv viewers and drudges you know linked to this video the last few days uh in fact we'll
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:19.360]  give folks the name of the video and show them the article uh here in just a moment so so we can
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:23.840]  give it out and folks can go check it out in fact ask ask adon or one of the guys to post it back
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:29.280]  as the top story on info wars dot com there it is historic feds forces surrender to american citizens
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:36.240]  people on youtube a minority of them say alex why are you so excited about this the feds will
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:42.560]  come back you know this isn't over i know that yes the point is is that the iconography the
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:48.800]  archetypal image right out of e for vendetta of where the people are marching on the capital
[01:42:48.800 --> 01:42:54.480]  and the military has been ordered to shoot them and they stand down that's how chelchescu fell
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:43:00.880]  it's how the east germans fell it's how the old soviet bloc fell it's how every corrupt system
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.320]  falls now i don't want the system to totally fall because you got a parallel republic and the new
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:11.840]  order takeover system that's using the old system to take it over i want to reboot the republic
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:18.160]  before the globalist under agenda 21 economically and culturally collapse us and then poses the
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:22.320]  savers see they create the false crisis to then pose the revolutionaries they're going to try to
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:28.240]  bring in a leftist uh you know system when they couldn't control the occupy movement and that's
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:32.240]  what it's been about for a long time then flushed it yeah you go back all the way back to the time
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:38.160]  of robert magnum era the imf they were accused of and the correct way to put this out is just
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:43.440]  rent seeking essentially turning all of us into serfs into sludge that's it don't own any via laws
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:49.120]  they own everything and that's why the blm is this going from management to ownership so then
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:55.360]  they can transfer that to the globalist well that's right and and of course before with the blm
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.000]  people wouldn't put up with this and it's like i've got a ranch here seven generations five
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.840]  generations uh and uh i've always run my cattle on this before this was there and so they know
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:10.640]  that this sector of the public land is where such a set runs runs his sheep or as we're such a
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:16.000]  such runs his cattle or as we're such as such grows his his oats the point is that's the way
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.560]  that's always been out west for more than half the land's federal they prey on the ignorance of
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:29.040]  the public to not know this but but this is what it all comes down to is that is that it shows that
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:35.760]  the feds didn't want a new lexicon or concord they they didn't want at the point of where the people
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:41.200]  called their bluff they backed down and it shows the moral authority and it was because of the
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:47.200]  iconography it was because of the images of the people in the cowboy hats the american flags the
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:56.000]  whole deal we the real america were reclaiming the country from the hired mercenaries out in the
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:03.040]  middle of the desert at an extreme expense who've run off the 52 other families bought them out forced
[01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:08.560]  amount now bluffing and lying and saying we would to sell bundy so now we say you owe us grazing
[01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.840]  rights they just pulled that out of the air had some federal judge certify it when all the precedents
[01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:18.880]  all the history all the state rulings all the other federal rulings show them this is about
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:23.600]  calling their fraud and if people ever realize no amount of property taxes no amount of grazing
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:29.280]  fees no amount of cops writing tickets will ever pay for this the more taxes we get the poorer we
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:35.840]  get because the globalists have signed the federal taxes on to derivatives 1.5 quadrillion
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:43.280]  700 trillion us is our global portion this is all on record at davos this is all openly in the
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:49.360]  mainstream news 90 plus percent of that is not even our debt they've signed us on to a black hole
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:55.200]  that no amount of money will pay off precisely because of that they've signed america this
[01:45:55.200 --> 01:46:02.000]  engine of liberty this engine of wealth onto a giant bill that's not ours it's so big that
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:06.000]  nothing will pay it off and so why do they want the taxes so high it bankrupts everybody
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:14.640]  three words they are exempt on record the rockefellers the Rothschilds the bushes the obamas
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:21.840]  all these people are basically tax exempt g e google i mean most these companies pay zero tax
[01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.560]  warren buffett always so nice he put a hundred billion with the bill among the gates and his
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:30.640]  foundation you go look at it they run their companies as tax free now they live in giant
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:36.640]  mansions with their helicopters and everything free because it's owned by the foundation you or
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:42.640]  i can't go do that with our 300 400 000 when we retire hopefully we've got saved but being
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:47.120]  inflated away we can't do that with our house because the property taxes always go up to eat
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:54.240]  out the profit they are the money changers are up against the free market they call it overheating
[01:46:54.240 --> 01:47:00.480]  when the economy starts growing past 3.5 percent we had 10 growth rates from 1789 right through the
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.680]  great depression but ever since the our company went into receivership it's never ended it's
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:09.760]  just gotten worse and worse from the richest nation in the world to the most indebted from
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:14.720]  the healthiest nation in the world to the most sick from the most aggressive and inventive nation
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:20.240]  to the most slovenly and dumbed down on every front we can rediscover the animating spirit
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:26.320]  of liberty what happened in nevada when we have the moral high ground when exercised over and over
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:30.560]  again they're buying armored vehicles they're trying to take on the tea party and gun owners
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:36.240]  and libertarians because the globalists have looked at the only opposition in this country
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:43.680]  that articulately knows it's a global u.n banking cartel takeover they've already seized the country
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:48.560]  they believe they own the country through fraud they believe they've conquered it but if we ever go
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:53.600]  wait a minute you did this by fraud the federal reserve is not federal wait a minute when the
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.360]  cops figure out why their parents are going bankrupt when the firemen figure out while
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:02.080]  they're set when the fbi agents you know has their kid died of cancer and finds out wait a minute
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:08.720]  that brain cancer virus is in vaccines when they find out their little kid died see the
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.640]  new order is going to hurt people so bad that there's no way we can lose the question is
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:19.440]  how far do we go down this hellhole before we find our fighting spirit that's right and that's
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:24.320]  exactly what we saw happening here when we played that clip from emin bundy he said these are hills
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:30.240]  that we grew up on for generations we were free to roam them and one day they beat up they beat
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.400]  up teenagers that pull up with their trucks and their girlfriends to fish blm shows up with guns
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:38.960]  and says what are you doing here exactly i mean literally a bunch of armed crazy goons running around
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.720]  one day they wake up and they got snipers on the hills with their guns pointed at them
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:47.680]  and kit daniels found the documents where the walton family foundation says we'll get four
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:53.440]  hundred thousand dollars to the to to to help the environment here as soon as you get the bundys off
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.520]  of their ranch as soon as you get their trespass cattle off and of course that same family foundation
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:03.200]  the guy who runs it is sitting on the board of first solar which is going to has already broken
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:09.280]  ground for their solar project using the bundy ranch it's incredible mitigation and then the chinese
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:15.200]  backed the chinese government backed group five billion to come bring in this infrastructure
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:21.840]  which we could put in anyways but is a boondog all this is all these energy deals to the democrats
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:28.000]  are are are literally just payoffs it's like when george herbert walker bush gets paid a million
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:34.400]  dollars to speak in japan or beijing in tokyo or in or in or in beijing it's on record that's
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:37.920]  what those are from these governments when the soddies pay mil clinton a million bucks to come
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:46.160]  speak over there okay a million dollars folks that's all this is is a total takeover of our
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:51.600]  civilization and and so they've got their blueprint we've got ours we tell the story we tell the
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.080]  narrative with the imagery of us at the alamo with our guns defying the police and their
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.280]  unconstitutional law they back down there remember that that was just a few months ago yeah you guys
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:05.840]  go and you do this and and and walk towards the guns as they're saying they're going to shoot you
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:09.840]  and they're sitting there thinking man am i going to just shoot some people
[01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:14.880]  plus it's like lexington you guys had your guns down at your side you were reporters you had a
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:20.080]  video camera as a guy but the people guns once the fed started shooting that's right people were
[01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.320]  going to be shooting back and see now there's the realization oh you're really going to have a civil
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:31.040]  war now you're really going to die for the lie for the fraud of you didn't build it bundy you
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.120]  didn't build this you're great great great great great grandfather seven generations didn't build
[01:50:35.120 --> 01:50:40.320]  this get off because we got a bunch of chinese communists and and and harry reid and people
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.400]  and the walton found it what do you think nature conservancy seara club and all these groups do
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:49.600]  they come in they get you to sell your land out for nothing they say flip it and build condos on it
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:53.440]  ten years later and nobody remembers i'm going to come back with one more segment with you david
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.040]  and i'm turning it over to you and dr jerome coursey got a bunch of other news is well coming
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:51:05.120]  up but this is historical this is a bit jessica arman here creator of my magic mud the all natural
[01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:09.520]  teeth whitener and strengthening remedy that's getting rave reviews from gc and listeners here's

[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:37.840]  that battle and i have no doubt that a firefight would have started they didn't the globalists
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:41.760]  want to blow something up then have a firefight start say we we blow up a federal building
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:45.440]  with a daycare center in it that's how they're going to do this they don't want it out there

[01:58:53.440 --> 01:58:59.920]  out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:04.720]  around the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen
[01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:11.200]  alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers
[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:17.440]  to add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:23.760]  reports documented a 15 point iq increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine

[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:32.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night we're going to be joined in the next segment
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:37.280]  with Jerome Corsi he's going to broaden this out we're going to see many places where the
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:43.520]  chinese are coming in in his research he's pointed out that this is just part of an evolving
[02:00:43.520 --> 02:00:48.800]  proposal that Beijing is developing quietly since 2009 to convert more than one trillion
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:56.240]  dollars of u.s. debt it owns into equity now of course harry reads connections to this project
[02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:03.760]  the his connections to first solar it's crony capitalism it's taking ownership of everything
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:08.320]  and away from the people running the small businesses down shutting them down and turning
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:14.480]  it over to globalist corporations or to the chinese corporations which are basically the
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:18.800]  chinese government that owns our debt so we're going to be talking to Jerome Corsi he's going
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:25.360]  to broaden this out it's not just in this area they also have chinese government backed economists
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:30.640]  that are proposing a plan to allow chinese corporations to set up development zones they're
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:35.600]  going to create entire cities in america where they send in chinese businesses and chinese
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:41.680]  factories to set things up this is what's going on across the country but there's another story
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:47.440]  here as well and that is the growing gradual encroachment and infringement of our rights
[02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:52.800]  gradually moving on to our property just like somebody moving their fence onto your property
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:56.000]  you know they mentioned that specifically in the second amendment because they knew that they
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.200]  weren't going to just come in and take away our right to keep and bear arms with just one fiat it
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:06.480]  was going to be a gradual encroachment process and we've seen that over and over again from these
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:13.760]  regulatory agencies like the blm that essentially start to regulate without representation that's
[02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:20.080]  a key feature of this story but the key the most key feature about this is we know that this is not
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:26.720]  the end of the war but this was a victory in a very important battle it's a battle that can
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:32.400]  wake people up not only to what's going on with agenda 21 and other issues but it also wakes people
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:37.120]  up to see how they can stand this down and we're not going to be able to get a mass of people to
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.040]  every place where the government is taking people's businesses or taking their property
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:45.040]  because you know where they're taking people's businesses for the most part so things like
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:52.320]  obama care using the irs just because the government says that they can do something and gets a court
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:58.160]  judge to order this doesn't mean that it is constitutional doesn't mean that it is lawful
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:04.960]  and yet just as we saw with a court case back in november where the irs was filling out the form
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:08.800]  for a lady and telling her that if she did not sign it they were going to hold her in contempt
[02:03:08.800 --> 02:03:14.080]  they were going to send her to jail she had zero taxes owed but it was about their power to force
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:20.400]  her to do whatever she wanted how did that end that didn't end with a mob of people that ended
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:27.040]  with one person on a jury standing up for what is just we need to understand that there are
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:32.080]  principles that are higher than the declared laws especially if there are laws and regulations
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:36.480]  that are put in place by people that we don't even have a say so that we don't even get a chance to
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:42.240]  vote in or vote out if we're going to have regulation with that representation we as a
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:48.160]  people need to understand that we do have a place even if we can't elect someone who will
[02:03:48.160 --> 02:03:53.680]  roll this back even if we've got an opposition party who is just as much in bed with a corporatist
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:59.360]  that are setting up obama care and the massive transfer of wealth from all businesses to insurance
[02:03:59.360 --> 02:04:04.080]  companies they're putting out not just ranchers out of business they're putting out a lot of
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:10.320]  small businesses because of obama care because of the increased expenses increased regulations
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:15.280]  codes that are being put in place by larger corporations so they can force their smaller
[02:04:15.280 --> 02:04:20.160]  competitors out of business this is happening everywhere when this happens in your community
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:26.880]  people need to stand up for a jury trial and the jurors on those trials need to look at what is
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:33.680]  justice not what is the law not just to take the orders of a judge it only takes one person
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:39.200]  on a jury to stand up to nullify a law that's only eight percent of the population approximately
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:45.440]  about one out of 12 if we can get that many people awake that many people to stand with those who
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.960]  refuse to obey unlawful orders we will take this country back now we're going to be right back
[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:56.080]  after the break we're going to talk to dr. Jerome Corsi about how the chinese are taking over this
[02:04:56.080 --> 02:05:01.520]  country the massive crony corporatism that's not just in nevada with harry reid the globalists have
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:06.800]  controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding making the weaponization
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:12.240]  even more vicious and deceptive all the major networks are state runs we are partnering this
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:17.680]  year with the nfl the nfl has become a political weapon against the second amendment pushes obama
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.720]  care msnbc tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our kind of
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:27.360]  private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:32.000]  kids belong to whole communities it is more important than ever to realize that we are not

[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:29.360]  josh owens from the standoff in bunkerville novato with the bundy ranch and the blm who basically
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:36.000]  turned the area into martial law after a 20 year dispute over what could legally be done there over
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:40.960]  a 20 year dispute about trying to shut the ranchers completely out of the area that they had enjoyed
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:46.320]  for generations asserting that it was for the behalf of the desert tortoise that was an obvious
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:53.920]  pretense at the same time they're mounting a multi-million dollar operation a militarized
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:09:00.000]  operation against this family they're allowing turtles they're actually not allowing there they
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.200]  are euthanizing turtles under their care more than 1400 turtles under their care and of course
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:12.080]  they were able to drive out 52 of the 53 ranchers in that area with their regulations coming in and
[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:17.440]  saying you are now only going to be allowed to have 10 of the stock that you used to have before
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:22.400]  and you're not going to be able to put your stock on the land in the prime part of the season that's
[02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:29.280]  the incrementalism that's the way through regulation and these unelected bureaucracies they can regulate
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:35.440]  any business out of business that's what they're doing with obama care it's essentially the same
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:41.680]  thing coming in and declaring that they have the right to to assume new powers that are not in
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:45.600]  the constitution the ninth and tenth amendment say if it's not explicitly in there you don't have
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.640]  that right they don't have the right to force people to buy obama care to buy insurance to
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:56.800]  spend much more than they ever would to an insurance policy forcing single men to buy
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:10:02.720]  maternity policies so that they can transfer excessive amounts of money to the insurance
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:07.360]  companies that gave them money to run for office so what we're seeing here is crony capitalism
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:12.640]  when reported this this was really the thing i believe that that drive this dramatic turnaround
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:18.480]  that we saw between friday afternoon late friday afternoon and early friday morning by friday morning
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:23.360]  the sheriff was there with a blm press release enhancing we're going to allow you we're going
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:27.920]  to open up the land again for your cattle course they had his cattle a lot of his cattle they had
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:32.320]  already seized and that they were subsequently taken back but listen to this article that came
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.400]  out today from the washington times they said it was likely that pressure from upstairs that would
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:43.040]  be harry reid rather than weapons from the field that changed his mind on the matter who is he
[02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:48.560]  that changed his mind that would be the director of the blm the guy who used to be harry reid's
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:53.920]  senior policy advisor neil corns he is now the head of the blm that's right the guy who used
[02:10:53.920 --> 02:10:59.680]  to work for harry reid is head of the blm and they were specifically targeting the bundy ranch
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:06.000]  and kit daniels found that documentation specifically targeting them as mitigation
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:10.720]  area like a carbon tax credit so that they could go ahead with their solar projects and they are
[02:11:10.720 --> 02:11:17.600]  going ahead with first solar the chinese project was presumably shelved back in june but harry reid
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:22.800]  has resuscitated that project before in the past it's not to say that it is completely dead i've
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:30.160]  got on the phone right now dr drome coursey and at we at wnd he wrote an article about where the
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:35.200]  chinese are going with this they're not just in that one area with harry reid this is massive this
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:41.600]  is across the country dr coursey thank you for joining us i great pleasure thank you now in
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:46.160]  april in your article you say that bloomberg reported that the chinese billionaire who was the
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:51.840]  founder of enn the energy group that wanted to put this solar project there had teamed up with harry
[02:11:51.840 --> 02:11:57.280]  reid to get incentives including land that was 113 miles south of los vegas and they sought to buy
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:12:02.640]  four and a half million dollars less than one eighth of the land's 38 million dollar assessed
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:07.040]  value so they're getting it for one eighth of the price these are sweetheart deals these are being
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:13.600]  done all over the country there is a plan to establish chinese ownership and even chinese
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:18.000]  factories and towns on the ground here in the u.s isn't there well yes i've been writing about this
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:24.320]  now for several years i mean the especially under the obama administration it's really
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:33.840]  picked up the chinese working largely with harry reid have had these plans to put massive solar
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.960]  facilities actually to buy energy period the united states i mean under the george w bush
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:44.960]  administration you gotta remember that the chinese were prohibited from buying interests in ports
[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:50.320]  because it was viewed to be not our national security interests to allow major energy or
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:55.440]  transportation facilities to be owned by the chinese well the obama administration's reversed
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:01.680]  that of course you know we've continued to borrow a trillion dollars from the chinese and the interest
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:07.840]  on that alone is mounting daily and the obama administration shows no end of interest in
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:15.840]  running deficits and borrowing from the chinese so here runs harry reid in 2011 with a group of
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:21.680]  senators on a senate funded trip to china and harry reid comes back with this partnership
[02:13:22.480 --> 02:13:29.920]  with enn energy enn group which is one of the largest energy companies in china 100
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:34.800]  percent owned by the chinese yeah chinese government yeah chinese government and uh
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:43.280]  partnering with the enn to bring in to shut down coal plants in nevada and to bring enn
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:49.920]  into running eight or nine thousand acres of solar farms because you gotta remember one of
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:56.640]  the problems with solar energy is it takes huge amounts of land and having all this land used for
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:04.560]  um a solar power funded by the chinese you of course gotta throw ranchers off their land and
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:11.920]  you have to exclude any coal powered plants which are cheaper yeah they're more effective well of
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:15.760]  course they they had rights just like property owners have rights and they've got to somehow
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:21.280]  get them off of the land before they can turn an area over to a developer to build a skyscraper in
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:25.120]  the city it was the same sort of thing that was happening here with these ranchers and i think
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:29.920]  the the showdown ended when it became clear that i mean you were reporting in info world we're
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:37.680]  reporting in a wnd.com the harry reid connection here is harry reid is about as corrupt as they
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:45.920]  come yes he's put his son in his lawyer for enn group he's pressured enn energy which is
[02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:53.200]  a utility for providing electricity in nevada to take more energy from renewable sources than
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:15:01.520]  is economically reasonable to do and envy energy refuse that's why the original chinese plan to buy
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:08.000]  these nine thousand acres has failed at least failed this round harry reid will revive it again
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:13.440]  harry reid never gives up on these plans right he's trying to ease just because the bundy ranch
[02:15:13.440 --> 02:15:21.280]  won today doesn't mean blm is going away i mean the this guy corns who has been appointed heading
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:29.040]  at the blm was formerly a um a top advisor to harry reid has spent the last few years in blm
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:36.240]  doing the sixth state study in the southwest of how to convert huge areas of southwest of solar
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:44.320]  farms and again they're not worried in moving the you know endangered species to another habitat
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:49.840]  which they call mitigation of the effects the environmentalists are happy to do that if it's
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:57.280]  to build a solar uh farm owned by the chinese they just won't move this tortoise if it's uh to the
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:02.720]  benefit of a rancher who wants to graze cattle that's right they've done that over and over again
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.600]  all around the area of los vegas they've moved tortoises out they they got money from developers
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:11.360]  there and said that's fine you pay us money we don't really care about the tortoises yeah the
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:15.920]  tortoises are just a chip in the game that's right and the left of the environmentalists don't care
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:24.080]  about the tortoises it's just a way of using the blm and the epa to impose this ideological agenda
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:30.080]  against carbon fuels which is absolutely an irrational agenda i mean it's you know again
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:37.200]  you see it in the hysteria over um the un's climate commission coming out again and saying
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:42.720]  all these disastrous consequences are going to happen because we burn carbon based fuels carbon
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:47.840]  based fuels are perfectly natural they're product of the earth they can be burned in a clean fashion
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:53.680]  they have nothing to do with dinosaurs more lies but the the the left the democratic party in the
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:17:00.160]  radical core of the democratic party algor through harry rey have found a way to make billions of
[02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:07.680]  dollars personally millions by scamming the american people into this climate hysteria thinking the
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:13.440]  carbon fuels are bad in the meantime inviting the chinese to come in here and build billions of
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:20.400]  dollars taking land away from ranchers in order to let the chinese run solar energy farms which are
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:27.360]  not productive not economically competitive with hydro big hydrocarbon based fuels but yet in the
[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:33.040]  ideological agenda of the democrats they believe they can sell this lie to a dummy down american
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:38.800]  public that doesn't know the difference and will be scared by climate hysteria and the world's
[02:17:38.800 --> 02:17:44.720]  going to end if we burn coal well no it's not but yet and harry reed's agenda that narrative is
[02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:52.240]  important for harry reed and his democratic crony corrupted buddies in congress to become
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:58.960]  millionaires and billionaires just like al gore did exactly you know it's not just about china now
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:04.880]  as you pointed out wnd has reliable information that the battle that the bank of china has continued
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:09.520]  to advance plans to convert china's holdings of us debt into equity that's what we see happening
[02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:14.720]  with china but of course it's not just even with china this is crony capitalism this is
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:20.880]  where giant corporations come in buy special favors get the government to run out by regulation
[02:18:20.880 --> 02:18:24.640]  all of the small businesses we've seen this pattern happen over and over again in many
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:29.600]  different industries but what's happening here is that harry reed has put his minion the guy who
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:35.040]  used to be a senior policy advisor to him in as head of the bureau of land management which they
[02:18:35.040 --> 02:18:40.800]  now see i guess is the bureau of land ownership and they are now trading these mineral rights that
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.680]  they find throughout all this property the water rights the surface rights they're trading those
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:51.760]  all off to their their giant corporations and of course then getting massive campaign contributions
[02:18:51.760 --> 02:18:58.160]  from those same corporations that was what caused them to back down was it's shining the light on
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:02.800]  these cockroaches wasn't yeah and look i'm sure it was harry reed to cause the back down harry
[02:19:02.800 --> 02:19:07.760]  reed doesn't want this that's right bought to light i mean but look the democrats obama the
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:13.920]  corruption within the obama administration is is enormous when it comes to energy again remember
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:22.000]  it was the all these cylindras these you know right a billion dollars that were funded by obama
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:29.040]  and the stimulus bill all went to bundlers you know obama supporters and funders money slipped
[02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:36.480]  under the table campaign contributions to democrats and what happened is that all these solar panel
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:43.360]  democrat funded firms went bankrupt because the chinese undercut them and producing solar panels
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:47.920]  in the world market that's right which was inevitable and now change on right there dr
[02:19:47.920 --> 02:19:53.440]  coursey we're gonna be right back dr jerome coursey from wnd he's going to unpack for us
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:58.560]  what is really going on with the selling of america to the chinese and the transfer of ownership

[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:24.000]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight and i have dr drome coursey from wnd on
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:31.200]  the phone now he's written extensively about china playing their debt card this is a an article
[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:38.160]  from january 20th 2013 a little over a year ago he said china poised to play the debt card for us
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:47.120]  land we've seen how that plays out in places like nevada where we shined the spotlight on the dirty
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:52.160]  dealings of harry reid and they backed down that's not us saying that that's the americans against
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:56.400]  the tea party saying that they said it was likely pressure from upstairs in other words harry reid
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:02.800]  rather than weapons from the field that changed his mind on the matter and of course the person
[02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:08.240]  who made that declaration who backed them down was the very head of the blm his former harry
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:13.600]  reid's former minion uh still has minion but his former senior policy advisor that would be neil
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:20.160]  corns who is now the head of the blm but we wanted dr. drum coursey to get on and flesh this out force
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:25.520]  because this is a project it's not it's not for sure that they are not going to come back and get
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:32.400]  involved in this project but we also have seen first solar breaking ground and this was also
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:37.040]  involving the bundy ranch because they saw the bundy ranch in the gold butte area where their
[02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:42.880]  cows were grazing as a quote-unquote mitigation area essentially a carbon credit if you will
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:49.440]  keeping that area pristine getting the cattle off getting ab abricating his rights so they could move
[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.040]  ahead with these projects they all referenced this particular ranch this rancher who's the last
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:26:00.240]  man standing for 20 years they needed to get his rights his grazing rights his water rights out of
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:05.440]  the way so they could move ahead with these crony capitalist projects one of them is going the
[02:26:05.440 --> 02:26:09.600]  other ones will be going as well they have many projects there but it's all over the country
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:15.120]  dr. drum coursey we were just talking about what's going on with china this debt card where we're
[02:26:15.120 --> 02:26:21.760]  transferring control of u.s land u.s assets and the blm is a major part of that well that's right
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:29.360]  i mean the entire green energy scam and that's really what it is i mean the for you know decades
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:36.560]  now the the far left is trying to push this agenda on america uh in its antipathy to carbon fuels
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:42.320]  thinking we're going to destroy the world of carbon fuels are burned which is nonsense or the fossil
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:46.560]  fuels or they're not fossil fuels they're naturally produced by the earth on an ongoing basis
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:53.280]  then burn for thousands of years and we're still here but yet if you can get solar panels you can
[02:26:53.840 --> 02:26:59.680]  accomplish several goals the far left wants to do it and they can agenda 21 grab of getting any
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:05.440]  independent ranchers off of land it can move the chinese in which of course the democratic
[02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:10.480]  politicians are happy to receive campaign contributions and kickoff kickbacks remember
[02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:16.080]  it goes back to clinton and all of his chinese buddies and al gore are being
[02:27:16.080 --> 02:27:22.000]  under the table i want so now you've got the you know harry reid playing the game and harry
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:30.320]  reid and nevada has been waging a war since about 2005 against any carbon producing power plants
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:36.480]  which are cheaper more efficient better for the consumer in nevada harry reid's closed down any
[02:27:36.480 --> 02:27:42.320]  number of them in fact one of the the mojave generating coal plants that harry reid wants to
[02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:49.040]  use for this chinese land grab near lofton nevada was where one of the mojave generating stations
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:55.120]  was located since 1965 they destroyed that plant coal producing plant now they're going to move in
[02:27:55.120 --> 02:28:01.680]  the chinese solar panels well the chinese undercut effort number one by the obama
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:09.040]  uh corrupt gang which was salindra and the other bogus solar corporations that were funded with
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:14.000]  billions of dollars in stimulus money went bankrupt when the chinese inevitably produced
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:20.240]  cheaper solar panels on the international market now the chinese want to come into the united states
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:27.360]  and dominate you know the energy market with again the scam of taking huge quantities because it
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:33.360]  takes massive amounts of land for these solar plants to be able to produce energy and then
[02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:38.320]  they don't work because even in nevada the sun doesn't shine all the time they're highly inefficient
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:44.400]  country after country around the world has shown that they cost more to produce you know these solar
[02:28:44.400 --> 02:28:51.920]  and wind facilities online with backup hydro power generation when the sun isn't shining or the wind
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:58.080]  isn't blowing it's all a scam but harry rich can get rich and i think in harry reid can make sure
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:04.640]  he lines his pocket al gore became a billionaire on this nonsense and the left has an ideological
[02:29:04.640 --> 02:29:10.160]  agenda which you know again goes back to the left we even wanted to control the this whole carbon
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:15.920]  tax scheme that they were going to impose on us until all the fraudulent emails got disclosed from
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:22.880]  the eu showing the climate science underlying all this renewable energy nonsense is largely
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:29.360]  fabricated junk science made up by fraudulent scientists and universities left oriented often
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:35.040]  paid to do it absolutely right thank you dr. drum coursey for exposing the light on these plans
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:40.480]  on the graft and corruption that we see happening here this is across the country and people need

[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:50.800]  show i'm david night and we just were talking to dr drome coursey from wnd he was fleshing out
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:56.880]  this chinese takeover this debt that is being converted to land and resources how the obama
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:02.480]  administration is taking down barriers that had been up against strategic infrastructure
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:08.080]  allowing that to be sold to the chinese just as we see foreign countries owning tall roads
[02:34:08.080 --> 02:34:14.720]  throughout america we're now seeing harry reid and others trying to turn over our energy grid to
[02:34:14.720 --> 02:34:20.080]  foreign countries and one of the ways that they're trying to do this is with these giant solar power
[02:34:20.080 --> 02:34:25.680]  projects out in novata and of course as kit daniels and info wars broke last week it was the number
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:32.720]  one story they pointed out that this was about the bundy ranch specifically mentioned in these
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:36.800]  documents of course others have pushed back against that and said well no that wasn't in
[02:34:36.800 --> 02:34:44.880]  the same area the bundy ranch was to be used as a mitigation area for all these solar projects
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:50.800]  that were set up the two that were set up for first solar that is also that although it's not
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.160]  the chinese harry reid was still very much involved in that but also for the enn project
[02:34:56.160 --> 02:35:04.160]  and as dr drome coursey pointed out enn has had very close ties to dr drome coursey it's a company
[02:35:04.160 --> 02:35:09.360]  an energy company largest chinese energy company owned by the chinese government now we're going
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:14.720]  to take your calls on this we want to have you call in with questions or comments about what
[02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:18.960]  you've seen about the larger issues involved here about the victory that we saw there and of course
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:24.640]  the war is not over it was a battle but it was a victory i think we need to take that we need to
[02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:30.480]  not be afraid of the fact that well maybe this was a faint by the feds or whatever look they were
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:36.320]  not expecting this josh and i were just talking about that earlier it completely took them by
[02:35:36.320 --> 02:35:41.520]  surprise they were reacting first of all to the story that came out last week and that's not just
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:46.560]  us saying that that's the americans against the tea party quoted by washington times earlier today
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:51.280]  said it was a likely pressure from upstairs rather than weapons from the field that changed his
[02:35:51.280 --> 02:35:56.720]  mind on the matter fact is harry reid probably didn't want his name attached to the biggest
[02:35:56.720 --> 02:36:01.280]  civilian massacre in us history right before the election season so we're going to take your calls
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:09.120]  on that that's 800 259 9231 that pushed them back that exposed the corruption the graph the
[02:36:09.120 --> 02:36:14.960]  connections between his son who was a lobbyist for the solar industry as well as his former
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:20.480]  senior policy advisor who is now head of the blm that's neil corns he's the one who backed it down
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:26.320]  he's the one who gave the order to step this down and that happened very suddenly as i was talking
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:33.200]  about before on friday afternoon as we were headed down to nevada to confront the sheriff's
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:39.120]  department down there we saw and did a report about the fact that they had taken down signs
[02:36:39.120 --> 02:36:45.520]  about the cattle area at that moment so they were still moving ahead on friday afternoon with their
[02:36:45.520 --> 02:36:51.360]  plans this story came out we went down there we told the sheriff about it we called up a press
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:56.880]  release that the blm was having essentially asked a rhetorical question about the corruption about
[02:36:56.880 --> 02:37:00.880]  the connections with harry reid to this of course we didn't expect them to comment on it and they
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:07.120]  didn't comment on it we just wanted him to know that we knew and it subsequently went to the
[02:37:07.120 --> 02:37:14.240]  number one story on friday by the next morning the sheriff who would not say anything did not even
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:20.560]  have a prepared propaganda statement the sheriff wanted to meet with mr bundy mr bundy said not
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.760]  in private we'll do it in public he read the blm press release saying that they were going to allow
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:32.880]  grazing to happen and bundy came back and said i want you to stand down this martial law essentially
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:37.440]  talking about the weapons talking about the checkpoints talking about the brutality that had
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:44.880]  been existed there and gave them one hour to do that when they didn't do that bundy said let's go
[02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:49.120]  get the cattle he's saying i'm not telling you what to do it's just a governor and the sheriff
[02:37:49.120 --> 02:37:53.920]  that i give orders to because they have a duty to protect the property of the citizens to protect
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:58.080]  them from being brutalized i asked a state rep when she came there she was talking about well
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:38:03.200]  you know this really isn't a very cost effective way to do this is it because they're spending
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:09.120]  millions of dollars on this operation and they're not really getting much for their money it's very
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:16.640]  very inefficient to do this you know it's not about efficiency it's about liberty i asked her i said
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:22.880]  would it be okay you know if it's okay for these guys to create martial law here would it be okay
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:28.080]  for the blm to come into this area and start raping people at what point does the local law
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:34.160]  enforcement the sheriff need to stand up and do his duty was we asked asking these questions again
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:40.800]  they came up with their they reacted to this on uh saturday morning and the crowd went to the area
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:47.280]  and took back the cattle empty handed the crowd walked up to the barriers and looked these guys
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:53.840]  who were hiding behind their vehicles with weapons pointed at us talking into the pa system telling us
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:38:57.600]  to stand down they were going to use lethal force they would shoot they had a court order

[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:47.200]  mountain view off-grid living he said that there's something going on down there today
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.960]  he tried to drive down the road to see what was going on that they've got all the roads blocked
[02:40:53.600 --> 02:40:58.800]  he saw that they brought in a mobile command center they've got prison buses and a lot
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:05.520]  of police cars nobody knows what's going on he said a lot of the locals are getting spooked
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:11.760]  and several of them are packing up and leaving the area what did he say about the supporters
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:17.120]  well what are the crowds like have most of the people left the area now he cannot get down the
[02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:22.000]  road to find out what anything that's going on because they've got the roads blocked um thought

[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:42.640]  with force it is going to backfire on them seriously whether or not the people shoot back
[02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:49.040]  whether or not they defend themselves this is going to be a major public relations fiasco
[02:41:49.040 --> 02:41:54.560]  for the government if they come in under martial law and do this they have dealt deceitfully with
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:42:01.760]  everybody they have trespassed on the the rights of this family for a very long time this is if
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:07.360]  they step this up again this quickly it's going to be a disaster for the government i hope this
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:11.520]  doesn't happen i hope they don't get violent thank you uh roger nevada go ahead do you have any

[02:42:56.160 --> 02:43:03.760]  need to uh we need to you know what 20 years ago we were laughed at when we said we need to repeal
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:08.800]  the income tax we need to get rid of the irs now we've got ted cruz saying that we're winning the
[02:43:08.800 --> 02:43:13.760]  information where people are understanding the corruption of the system they're understanding
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:19.200]  that the government is infringing and encroaching on our rights gradually in areas that they do not
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:25.200]  have any lawful authority and they're starting to understand that they need to judge for themselves
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:30.720]  think for themselves what does the constitution say when it clearly says they do not have these
[02:43:30.720 --> 02:43:36.560]  rights unless they're explicitly granted to them it really means it and when they try to do this they
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:40.960]  may have a lot of force they may have a lot of power they don't have authority we need to understand
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:46.720]  that the government has massive force but if we understand that they don't have any authority
[02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:52.320]  that these things are immoral illegal then perhaps some good people will stand up as we saw happen
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:57.360]  in nevada that's what it takes it takes people who never thought that their government was capable
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:02.800]  of doing this just like the bundy family just like amon bundy said he grew up in those hills all of
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:09.600]  his life he could not believe that it was turned into a that he had people snipers on the hills
[02:44:09.600 --> 02:44:14.160]  pointing guns at him he couldn't believe that that would happen you need to wake up and understand
[02:44:14.160 --> 02:44:20.560]  this is where it's going to go for everyone if we don't stand up collectively for individual rights
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:26.000]  if we don't stand up collectively for the rule of law when they take your rights whether it's
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:30.640]  grazing rights water rights your rights to privacy your right to keep and bear arms they're going to
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:35.840]  take your first amendment rights or free speech rights and they did that they showed what they're
[02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:41.760]  about they showed that they're about a dictatorship they showed that this was martial law even though
[02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:46.720]  they didn't clear it very disturbing her to report from uh sue in Idaho that she knew somebody who
[02:44:46.720 --> 02:44:51.120]  was uh there if there's anybody else in nevada that knows anymore about the situation please call

[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:30.560]  be something that uh i can't make no more comments on info wars well what did you say did you use some
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:34.160]  language or do you threaten to kill somebody what was it well go ahead and say it we're not censoring
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.960]  you right now say it okay well i said that the only way to take this country back is by force and
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:45.600]  all you guys with the cardboard signs are wasting your time okay well i i let me let me tell you
[02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:50.240]  what you get taken off when you call for actions of violence and let me tell you something we didn't
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:55.440]  have to shoot them to get our rights back what it took was people standing up and facing them down
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:46:00.880]  i was there and you don't need to start taking cheap shots at us or cheap shots at the people
[02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:06.320]  who were there there is a way that we can face this down and we can do it peacefully you stare the
[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:11.920]  people in the eye and you walk right up to them that's what we did there we did it in mass we did
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:17.280]  it publicly that's the way to stand these people down you can stand up for your rights on a jury
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:22.400]  you can stand against these unlawful orders that are given to you by a judge you can stand against
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:27.440]  unlawful laws that are created by these out of control bureaucracies there's a way to do this
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:33.040]  and one of the hopes that i have and one of the things that made me so optimistic so excited was
[02:46:33.040 --> 02:46:39.840]  to see that we could have taken back those cattle peacefully we can take back our rights we don't
[02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:44.560]  have to be cattle we can take back the cattle we can take this country back and we can do it
[02:46:45.120 --> 02:46:50.560]  it takes resolve and it can be done peacefully if they fire first fine we don't need to start
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:55.440]  shooting it's not time to start shooting yet let's go to diana and oklahoma diana go ahead
[02:46:56.800 --> 02:47:04.160]  hi um first time caller and um i've been listening to the info wars for a good half the
[02:47:04.160 --> 02:47:08.480]  amount of time you guys been on here and i find that you guys are doing a great job but the reason
[02:47:08.480 --> 02:47:14.400]  why i want to call in was i was listening to um a radio show called the will call majority somebody
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:21.600]  called in talking about that there is an exact same situation going on in new mexico in the south
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:27.040]  central part of new mexico blm going in and taking somebody's cattle i don't know if anybody else has
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:32.160]  talked about this i don't know uh where this gentleman got his source but i thought it would be
[02:47:32.160 --> 02:47:38.960]  worth letting somebody else know passing the word along okay that's somewhere in new mexico do you
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:45.360]  have a city south central new mexico no i don't i it's very it was very it was very limited on
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:52.880]  information um and i just i just thought that if anybody else knows anything that's going on it
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:58.160]  might be you guys or somebody else might be able to phone in and give some information about it but
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:04.240]  um i just thought that that was worth mentioning but um but i also wanted to talk about um your
[02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:09.840]  guys is david you david night thank you so much for being out there in nevada and and the whole

[02:48:15.360 --> 02:48:20.000]  for getting the word out you know there were so many people that were there a lot of them came
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:25.040]  up and said that they'd heard about it through info wars they're reporting here um and special
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:28.800]  thanks to the guy in the info wars t-shirt they gave me some water after i've been talking for a

[02:48:38.080 --> 02:48:44.480]  caller before we need to stand these people down we are in the right here and we need to just
[02:48:44.480 --> 02:48:49.760]  understand what's going on understand the scam that they're operating and we will have the moral
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:57.680]  authority and the backbone to stand up to them we we have power in numbers yes and i have i have
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:03.520]  been saying that for years and years and years and for the longest time i was always looked at
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:10.960]  as some kind of is person who has these wild dreams of something and it's but it's true if if we do
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:16.720]  not hang together we assuredly hang separately absolutely that's the bottom line absolutely

[02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:00.880]  broader picture here there's a broader picture that applies to things like obama care there's a
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:05.760]  broader picture that applies to things like the income tax you've got the irs now saying that they're
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:12.880]  going to apply outstanding what they assume to be outstanding tax debts to children they can go back

[02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:21.600]  entire show about the situation in nevada at the bundy ranch what the vlm is doing what it tells us
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:26.880]  about the larger situation about a government agencies that are out of control that can rewrite
[02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:33.120]  laws that can take away all of our rights that can declare marsh that can act in martial law without
[02:54:33.120 --> 02:54:38.000]  declaring it in any given area that can say that you no longer have free speech if you step outside
[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:42.400]  your car will immediately arrest you is that the kind of america that we want to live in now i've
[02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:46.560]  seen people say that this is a psi up that this whole thing that happened on saturday was a psi
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:52.960]  up i truly believe that the sheriff showing up and saying that's it we give up you can go back on the
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:57.680]  land that was a psi up that was trying to get everybody to go home and say oh that's fine it's
[02:54:57.680 --> 02:55:03.680]  over what was not a psi up what they did not expect what they did not engineer was for us to all go
[02:55:03.680 --> 02:55:10.400]  over there and take the cattle back they were caught by surprise and they were stood down they
[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:16.560]  were stood down by people who were not pointing guns at them we had people who did have guns
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:22.720]  and the presence of firearms is a deterrence to a tyrannical government make no mistake about it
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:28.720]  that's why this was not tenement square it wasn't just that we had men on horses it was that there
[02:55:28.720 --> 02:55:32.320]  were also people there with guns and they would have used them if they had started shooting it
[02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:38.960]  would have been a disaster and it will be a disaster for the federal government if they use force
[02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:43.440]  in this situation we need to start watching them like hawks and we're taking your calls
[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:50.960]  let's go to uh mark in california mark hey david how you doing doing fine what you got good hey
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:55.280]  um there's a lot of stuff flowing around on facebook right now that's real important for
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:59.440]  everybody that needs to pay attention to this now i'm you know i was down there at the ranch with
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.240]  you david knight and your crew fantastic thank you guys did an awesome job i want to say that right
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:09.600]  now you guys got some glory and you well thanks for going but tell us what you're saying right now
[02:56:10.720 --> 02:56:15.760]  right now what they're trying to get out across the message to everybody right now is that don't
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:21.680]  trust anything that you're seeing on facebook except for what is on their page we support the
[02:56:21.680 --> 02:56:29.760]  bunny thing then also um also beware of roadblocks and inspection points that's what we're also
[02:56:29.760 --> 02:56:34.480]  gathering right now that people are they're concerned about people showing up that may be armed
[02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:39.520]  and they're trying to possibly stop them oh really really what are the carry what are the carry
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:46.480]  laws there in nevada i thought they had uh open carry uh yes yes but we're talking about california
[02:56:47.040 --> 02:56:51.600]  we're talking okay okay okay roadblocks in california people that would be headed to that i understand
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:55.440]  okay yeah yeah there's a lot of people that are heading out to this thing and they're trying to
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:57:00.960]  stop people from even getting to the location in the first place to even support this thing
[02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:05.520]  and the next thing is is that people are spreading around on facebook right now they're talking about
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:09.680]  the fact that you know they're taking down everybody's license place numbers everybody that
[02:57:09.680 --> 02:57:14.240]  goes and supports this thing they've got a team out that's you know basically documenting every
[02:57:14.240 --> 02:57:19.760]  single person that shows up so now people are afraid to even go out there to support this thing
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:24.400]  let me address let me address that you know because i saw that as well look folks if you
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:29.280]  haven't gotten the memo yet you're being watched you're being recorded they know everything about
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:35.760]  you already don't be cowed down by that get in their face that's what we did there people stood
[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:41.040]  up to the tyranny if you know if this if that's the takeaway that we get from the snowden documents
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:44.720]  that we've got a we've got to watch ourselves we've got to censor ourselves we've got to
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:51.120]  shut our any protest any anything that we do and say that would criticize the government if that's
[02:57:51.120 --> 02:57:58.000]  the takeaway we've lost this country is lost when they're doing the wrong thing you have to stand up
[02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:02.320]  and when they're watching you that's all the more reason to stand up thank you so much mark in

[03:00:27.040 --> 03:00:31.600]  and we've been talking this entire show about the situation in nevada at the bundy ranch
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:37.680]  this is about a lot more than just one story if you can understand the broad principles involved
[03:00:37.680 --> 03:00:43.360]  that's what's really important it's about a government that is regulating businesses out
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:48.400]  of existence without any representation have you ever voted for any blm officials on your
[03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:53.760]  ballots have you ever voted for any irs officials on your ballots how about the epa or the fish and
[03:00:53.760 --> 03:01:00.400]  wildlife or osha do they ever answer to us no this is regulation without representation it is
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:07.920]  taxation without representation the legislature the congress has abrogated their or has abdicated
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:13.600]  rather their authority and given it to these bureaucracies they're allowing them to write
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:18.880]  the laws to enforce the laws in a way where we don't have a presumption of innocence where it's a
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:26.240]  military martial law situation they've allowed them to do this we cannot allow this to continue
[03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:31.600]  we cannot allow them to continually encroach upon our rights and the also the the story that
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:35.920]  we see here at the bundy ranch is that we can stand up to them en masse and we can take back
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:40.320]  our individual rights now we were talking to uh callers who just called in we had worth from
[03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:44.960]  north carolina on the line we had to cut for the end of the show worth go ahead get right to what
[03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:50.240]  you wanted to say oh i just wanted to say if god could have picked anybody in the world and this
[03:01:50.240 --> 03:01:56.160]  was the last man standing climbing bundy man i mean he couldn't have been a better person because
[03:01:56.160 --> 03:02:02.400]  he's so moral and all these watching those hundred cowboys lined up on horses with a thousand people
[03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:07.200]  behind them and they have guns and they didn't shoot nobody because they were taking the moral
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:12.400]  ground and i just loved it it was like watching the best western louis i've ever seen in my life
[03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:17.840]  it brought tears tears to my eyes when i saw it uh is right after the sheriff who gave his uh
[03:02:17.840 --> 03:02:25.040]  his pr ploy there from the the blm and uh they had a whole bunch of mounted cowboys right in from
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:30.640]  either side and one went straight up the hill planted the flag it was great and these guys
[03:02:30.640 --> 03:02:35.600]  stood them down without using weapons as you pointed out that's the way we need to do it we
[03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:42.960]  can do it if we stand together let's go to richard and organ richard go ahead yeah i think and yes
[03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:48.160]  i'm glad you were out there and i got people organized that's the you what you say that's
[03:02:48.160 --> 03:02:54.800]  a way to do it uh not has to be violence but you have to have everybody stand up united in force
[03:02:55.760 --> 03:03:02.320]  yes absolutely and they and they back down and they were very much afraid of even though people
[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:07.840]  were not uh pointing weapons at them they were very much afraid i i genuinely do believe that
[03:03:07.840 --> 03:03:11.280]  they were trying a faint that they were trying to deceive people the announcement that the
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:16.560]  sheriff came up there but they were not expecting the crowd of people to go down and confront them
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:22.240]  at those barricades and even though they were fully armed armored and hiding behind their cars
[03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:27.520]  they were very much afraid of the crowd that was a very empowering moment need to understand
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:33.120]  that we can walk this down we have to know what they're doing we have to know that we're in the
[03:03:33.120 --> 03:03:37.600]  right go ahead was there anything else you want to say richard and organ yeah and the thing you
[03:03:37.600 --> 03:03:42.560]  have to be careful of is it's like guys saying this could be just a trick okay to de-escalate
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:47.040]  get you relax then they try another action especially you got to watch that with like
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:53.680]  that's also like a very common chinese tactic i mean like years ago they built the absolutely
[03:03:53.680 --> 03:03:57.520]  absolutely i'm going to cut your short because i want to get to a chad in california and stacy
[03:03:57.520 --> 03:04:02.000]  in wisconsin we understand it was it was simply a battle but there was a victory we need to
[03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:09.440]  uh be excited about that go ahead chad in california hey um yeah i he was incredible
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:15.760]  and a really good road mile in the sense that he carried on the statement before he just didn't
[03:04:15.760 --> 03:04:22.080]  say okay i'm complying you need to comply he gave demands back and it's the same thing that we need to
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:29.040]  do with an example with the police if you get involved with the police and they stop you
[03:04:29.040 --> 03:04:33.600]  everybody's heard the fact that am i being detained officer why do we stop there
[03:04:33.600 --> 03:04:38.480]  we have to actually confront these people and and give them good and make them give good reason
[03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:44.160]  officer am i being detained i need a yes or no if you answer any other way i'm going to assume
[03:04:44.160 --> 03:04:49.120]  that i'm not being detained on my way you know we're out of time but yeah that's i'm sorry stacy
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:52.000]  in wisconsin we're not going to be able to get to you call back tomorrow we'll try to take you
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:59.680]  early but he did not have the attitude of a slave he gave them orders based on what their duties were
[03:04:59.680 --> 03:05:22.320]  that's the attitude we need to have
