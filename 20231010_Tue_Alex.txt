[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  Let me set the stage.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.040]  Gateway National Recreation Area, a unit of the National Park System, is the lifeline
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.560]  to the outdoors in the middle of New York City.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.040]  Facing political pressure, the Biden administration rubber-stamped a lease proposal to allow the
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.400]  construction of shelters for migrants inside the park boundaries.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.060]  The lease was signed, and I would not be surprised if they're constructing migrant
[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.720]  shelters as we speak.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.400]  In New York City, where elderly American war veterans are being thrown out on the street
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.840]  to house the never-ending illegal invasion that may soon be flooding our national parks.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.840]  What is this?
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.840]  I don't know.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.840]  You don't have the right to do this.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.840]  I don't have the right to do what?
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.120]  Yes, you don't have the right to film in here, that's what I'm telling you.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000]  What is this over here, and who are you?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  You hear me?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.080]  Make this the last time you approach a member of the public, giving them orders.
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.760]  It was very disgraceful what they did to the people in the island shores.
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.080]  I said, no, no, no, no, you're not moving me.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.920]  And they said, yes, yes, yes, we are.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.280]  Everything was done behind closed doors.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.160]  Meanwhile, in Chicago, the locals have finally had enough from their Democrat overlords.
[00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.760]  My name is Beatriz Ponce de Leon, I'm the Deputy Mayor for Immigrant, Migrant and Refugee
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.760]  Rights.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520]  You are not, you are not.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.920]  And if you think it was loud inside, it was just as rowdy outside, because many people
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.800]  were not allowed in because they reached capacity.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.000]  What I want to say is to Mayor Brandon Johnson, we are disappointed in you.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.280]  This is the community that supported you, how dare you?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.440]  Only time will tell as election season grows nearer, as Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.160]  flip-flops on his border wall hysteria.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:05.240]  I want to address today's reporting relating to a border wall and be absolutely clear.
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.340]  There is no new administration policy with respect to the border wall.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.560]  They had a choice.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.600]  What happened was Alejandro Mayorkas, the Homeland Security Secretary, I believe he
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.000]  was correct when he put out a memo that said that there is this voluminous amount of historic
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.440]  proportions of illegal migrants crossing the border and that they need to do something
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.780]  to secure it.
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.780]  And guess what?
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.600]  They're putting up these barriers, i.e. a border wall.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.960]  And what happens a few hours later, he's like, oh, we don't believe in border walls and we're
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.480]  being forced to do it.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.840]  Meanwhile, chaotic carnage streams across our border as yet another bus crash kills
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.400]  18 migrants.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.320]  Unchecked disease embeds itself into the heartland as tuberculosis and other diseases skyrocket.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.280]  The city is actively monitoring 500 cases of this illness.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.560]  Tuberculosis is a serious disease that kills millions worldwide.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.080]  But in the United States, we're not used to seeing a lot of it until now.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.800]  Meanwhile, Mexico warns that at least 10,000 military aged men will pour into the United
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.720]  States on a daily basis.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.880]  And he said, yeah, the U.N. sent me over here.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.640]  I'm a soldier for the U.N. and they gave me this card.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.800]  It's got a computer chip in it, like a bank card, you know, but it's got the guy's picture
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.920]  on it, information number, and he was told to go to a certain city and get a place to
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.640]  stay and wait.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.480]  They would get in touch with him through the phone.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.960]  He's not just going to come live here.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  If he's a soldier for the U.N., he's not going to come live here for six months and then pay
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.560]  him twenty two hundred dollars a month.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.480]  OK, whatever they're planning on doing, they're planning on doing it within, I would say,
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.560]  the next 90 days to 120 days.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:04.680]  Google my name, Todd Bensman and Unit 910, and you'll see all of my reports on on that.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.120]  They are clandestine agents in American cities armed to the teeth with target lists
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.000]  already drawn up, waiting for orders from from Tehran.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.880]  If things really blow on the northern border in Israel and we help watch out for the Unit
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.560]  910. They admitted to us they have two dozen terrorists here in America.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.640]  They can't track two hundred and twenty thousand a month.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.440]  What if one percent of those individuals were affiliated, one percent with criminal
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.200]  organizations that we know of, with cartels that we know of, with foreign terrorist
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.320]  organizations that we know of?
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.960]  And they are in and around America and have been moving in and around America for two
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.200]  plus months with CCP funding, Iranian support, Mideast terrorist organization financing
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.240]  all to do one thing, establish sleeper cells in the U.S.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.400]  and wait for the right time to do this.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.520]  Yes. To us.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.120]  John Bauer reporting.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.240]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.720]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.880]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.280]  exposing them. But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.280]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]  to Klaus Schwab's.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.600]  You will eat the bugs.
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.760]  This is the Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960]  great renaissance.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.920]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.720]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.560]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening today at Infowarsstore.com, either signed as a
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.240]  fundraiser. I thank you for the support or unsigned.

[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.560]  So please get the historic book now.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.400]  Go now to Infowarsstore.com and get The Great Awakening.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.360]  The Great Awakening at Infowarsstore.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.840]  Nineteen eighty four is 1776.
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, an honor, a privilege to be here live with you from the Infowars
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.800]  World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, on this Tuesday, October 10th, twenty twenty
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.840]  three edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:47.920]  And while I have a loaded news desk, the main topic of discussion today will yet again
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.080]  be the aftermath of what we saw in Israel over the weekend.
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.680]  And of course, now the attacks on the Gaza Strip.
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:03.000]  Now. We've also got Dr.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.880]  Francis Boyle, who is a great guest with great geopolitical knowledge coming on in
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.000]  the second hour, and then we have Joel Skousen, who is a great guest with great
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.520]  geopolitical knowledge coming on in the third hour.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.480]  And I'm going to remain neutral in those conversations.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.440]  Remain neutral in those conversations and just let their experience and their
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.680]  knowledge come through the airwaves.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.000]  But I also want to try to remain neutral in covering all of this news, because.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:51.720]  When we get emotional and we get reactionary, we can be misled, we can fall for
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.800]  propaganda and we can make mistakes.
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.600]  And I'm seeing way too much of that today.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:04.000]  And the other thing I'm noticing is a.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.600]  Double standard.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.360]  That doesn't add up to me.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  But before I get into all of that.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.680]  Let me just tell you the different angles, the different aspects that we have
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.000]  covering up that we have coming up that we're going to be covering today.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:27.440]  Now, this whole story about the babies being beheaded.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.520]  They're saying they found 40 babies beheaded.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.360]  Well, this is about the worst possible thing you can imagine, the worst possible
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.880]  thing you can hear.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.040]  And.
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.040]  You know, I don't even think it's fair to say, well.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.720]  America's aborted 60 million babies, so what's 40 beheaded babies, America's
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.280]  aborted 60 million of them.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:59.640]  I don't really think that's fair to say, but you notice that you will have the
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.560]  same people.
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:07.560]  Pooh poohing 60 million aborted babies and you'll have Democrats that say, yeah,
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.280]  you should be able to abort babies right up to birth, but but then.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.000]  This is an act so horrendous.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.360]  That we need to go to war over.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.440]  But there's another angle to that.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.440]  That I find more important, there's another angle to that that I want to
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.280]  cover today.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.920]  But I'm going to do that when we come back in the next segment.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.720]  Now, there's also this.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.040]  Bloodlust.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.720]  And this greed for never ending war.
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.360]  So how do we possibly have that going on?
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.960]  Well, you've got us with the unlimited funding and supporting of Ukraine.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.920]  And now I suppose it's going to be whatever Israel needs as well, what
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.120]  happens if China goes into Taiwan?
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.640]  Is that going to be another situation?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.320]  And then how can the Biden administration say this?
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.080]  And John Kirby confirmed it.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.960]  That climate change is still their number one concern, manmade climate
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.800]  change and carbon emissions, boy.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:16.120]  Yeah.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.280]  How much climate change is caused by war?
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:20.800]  Hmm.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.080]  That doesn't seem to matter.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.440]  They can make as many weapons as they need.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.880]  They can have as much war as they want.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.160]  That's all fine.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.080]  That doesn't cause climate change.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.040]  But you driving a car, that's the problem.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.880]  You having a gas stove at home, that's the problem.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.440]  You eating steak dinner with your family, you having barbecue with your
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.120]  neighbors, that's the problem.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.040]  Them making unlimited weapons for unlimited wars, that's not in the
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.120]  equation of stopping manmade climate change.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:04.880]  And you so and so so right there on its face, this argument or any
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:12.240]  This argument or any legitimacy to the idea that humans on planet Earth need to
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:18.600]  have their carbon emissions monitored and curtailed should be thrown out the window.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:24.600]  So the government, the world government that keeps the world in a state of
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.440]  perpetual war, which I'm sure isn't good for the climate, at least by their own
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.160]  measurements.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.320]  Says that you have to be controlled, you have to care about manmade climate
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:42.800]  change, but they can make weapons and jets and war all over the planet.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.280]  That's all fine and good.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.560]  You, the citizen of planet Earth, you need to be monitored.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.920]  You need to be enslaved.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.280]  You're causing climate change.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.200]  Ignore that giant nuclear explosion down the road.
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:04.320]  Or even ignore the chemicals that they spray in the air right above your head.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.360]  But of course, they're using this war now for some of their other agendas.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.160]  And they're saying, oh, well, maybe these terror groups are funded by
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.360]  cryptocurrencies, so we've got to stop cryptocurrencies.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.680]  Maybe these terrorists are using Twitter to communicate, so we need to shut down
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.200]  Twitter.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.120]  Boy, isn't that convenient?
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.200]  How convenient that is.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.880]  And now you see this other narrative coming along, which was always the case.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.160]  Yeah, we've got this thing called the Second Amendment.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.360]  You know, the founding fathers of this country were pretty smart men.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:56.320]  They were pretty advanced in their foresight and their political knowledge.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.440]  In ways that we really don't properly respect.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:09.440]  But they're saying, look, now gun ownership, advocacy and activism is up in Israel.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.560]  Oh, really?
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.800]  Oh, other countries now see the need for the Second Amendment.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.080]  Bolsonaro becomes president of Brazil.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.000]  They get more gun rights.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.120]  The communists take over.
[00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.080]  They strip the gun rights.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.040]  Crime goes back up.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:37.120]  You look at every major city in the United States of America run by Democrats with gun
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.120]  control has the highest rates of gun violence.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:44.960]  But oh, my gosh.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.800]  We're just realizing it now that private gun ownership and self-defense is an important
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:58.440]  thing. As Israel loosens up its laws so that citizens can have guns and defend
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:04.440]  themselves. Yeah, again, the Second Amendment.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:11.360]  The Bill of Rights, we understood this hundreds of years ago, even.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.800]  Why is it a debate now?
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.800]  It shouldn't be. Then there's the Joe Biden aspect.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.520]  Then there's the Joe Biden aspect.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:30.960]  Why has Joe Biden been so missing in action during all of this?
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:38.400]  Well, it's Joe Biden, and he obviously is in need of a lot of care.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:45.000]  And rest. But there might be another reason that they don't want to tell you, because
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.720]  the White House is putting out all this propaganda.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.960]  Oh, Biden's been busy.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:52.320]  He's been on the phone. Look, somebody somebody typed up a 100 page statement.
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.080]  It shows how hard Biden's working.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:15:00.200]  Well, no, Biden is actually being investigated right now for the last two days.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.520]  Joe Biden has been investigated for.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.600]  The classified documents he was storing at his private residence, you know, with the
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.320]  famous garage photo with the Corvette and the secret classified documents stacked up
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.840]  behind it, and then also the Penn Biden Law Center in Pennsylvania that was run by
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:24.600]  the Chinese communists that they had access to, probably.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.800]  So Joe Biden is actually being investigated now.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.840]  I'm not saying anything is going to come of those investigations, but but the crimes
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.520]  they're accusing Donald Trump of doing with the classified documents, Joe Biden
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:38.280]  actually did. And he wasn't the president.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.640]  As Trump was, so he's been investigated for the last two days over that, my guess is
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.520]  nothing comes of it. But the White House isn't telling you about that.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.400]  They're just saying, oh, no, Biden's been very active during all of this.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.200]  Actually, he had a barbecue lunch with a live band at the Rose Garden while he's being
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.760]  investigated. That's what's going on.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.920]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.840]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.800]  slavery worldwide? Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War three
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.600]  in Russia? Well, I know where you are.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.680]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now.

[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.360]  reached the critical juncture in the battle now.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.520]  And a key tool in that fight is the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.560]  launching the next great renaissance.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.200]  This is my second book, part two of the Great Recent War for the World.
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.520]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, more powerful book.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:42.840]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send a number one

[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.280]  keeps us on air. A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.640]  amazing, high quality coffee has not been available.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.680]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.480]  had gone down some. I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:18.880]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.360]  supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.200]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:31.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.880]  that I have ever drank.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.720]  It is game changing.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.320]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.480]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund your operation, a 360 win.

[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.000]  The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them, but the Lord
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.800]  laughs at the wicked, for he knows their day is coming.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:12.640]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, slay those
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:17.680]  whose ways are upright, but their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.240]  will be broken. Better the little that have righteousness than the wealth of any
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.520]  wicked, for the power of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.040]  righteous.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.360]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.200]  endure forever.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:36.120]  In times of disaster, they will not wither.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.120]  In days of famine, they will not plunder, but the wicked will perish.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.160]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.840]  and they will go up in smoke.
[00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:08.050]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:38.350]  As I'm considering how to broach these topics today, knowing how polarized this issue is,
[00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:48.350]  I try to find ways and angles and perspectives that make it consumable and palatable for everybody, even if you might disagree.
[00:20:48.350 --> 00:21:12.350]  Because, unfortunately, when there's emotional reactions during war or atrocities like this, people's common sense and their, what might be a 20-20 vision, is now skewed and is now manipulated.
[00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:24.350]  And when you're emotional, it's hard to admit that, and when you see atrocities, it's hard to accept that that might be the case, because we are emotionally driven, conscious beings.
[00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.350]  But, I have to consider and I have to look at some other angles here.
[00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:38.350]  And I'm surprised that more people don't have this same response.
[00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.350]  And I guess I should even be more specific.
[00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.350]  We've seen a political movement happening in this country.
[00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:57.350]  We've seen it behind Donald Trump and even Infowars, where people talk about fake news and where people will admit our politicians are lying to us all the time.
[00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:09.350]  But so how is it that those people that understand that paradigm now, so you're saying the same media and the same politicians that you know lie to you about everything else, but they're being honest about this situation in Israel?
[00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.350]  See, that might stir you up emotionally, doesn't it?
[00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:17.350]  But what is so irrational about what I said?
[00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.350]  You know the news lies to you.
[00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.350]  You know it's propaganda.
[00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.350]  You call it fake news.
[00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.350]  You know our politicians lie to us.
[00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.350]  You know they lie to get us into wars.
[00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.350]  It's the military-industrial complex.
[00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.350]  So let's just take a step back.
[00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:39.350]  The same people that you know lie to you about everything are being honest about what's going on in Israel.
[00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.350]  Do you really believe that?
[00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.350]  Just asking questions, which we should all be doing.
[00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.350]  We should all be doing.
[00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.350]  And I see this notion coming out of D.C.
[00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.350]  We have to support Israel at all costs.
[00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.350]  We have to support Israel at all costs.
[00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:26.350]  Well, even if you believe all the news and this is the worst thing ever by Hamas and the beheaded babies and the slaughter at the concert and their desire to wipe the state of Israel off the map and kill all Jews, let's say that it's the fully worst vision of Hamas or even Palestinians that you can have.
[00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:29.350]  Let's still take a pause here.
[00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.350]  Because actions have consequences.
[00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.350]  What does supporting Israel at all costs look like?
[00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.350]  And then what are the consequences of that?
[00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:51.350]  If we support Israel at all costs, what if that leads to World War III?
[00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.350]  What if that leads to a nuclear war?
[00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.350]  Do you want to still support Israel at all costs?
[00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:57.350]  Is that still worth it to you?
[00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.350]  What if Americans get brought into this?
[00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:09.350]  What if our homeland becomes under attack or involved in a World War III?
[00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:19.350]  What if it's your sons and daughters getting drafted by the Biden administration to go fight in a World War III started over a religious war, a holy war that has nothing to do with you?
[00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.350]  Is it still worth it to support Israel at all costs?
[00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:30.350]  What if supporting Israel at all costs meaning means that we draw into a larger conflict with Iran?
[00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:37.350]  What if China and Russia have already decided geopolitically that they're going to be siding with Iran in this escalation?
[00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:42.350]  And then that leads to more escalation and more war and World War III or nuclear war.
[00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.350]  Do you still want to support Israel at all costs?
[00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.350]  I don't see people asking this.
[00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.350]  I see them jumping off the ledge.
[00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.350]  Hey, maybe you argue that morally supporting Israel is the right thing to do.
[00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.350]  Geopolitically supporting Israel is the right thing to do.
[00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:07.350]  But again, at what cost?
[00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:12.350]  We have to think about these things.
[00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.350]  The art of war, chess.
[00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.350]  That's how this stuff goes.
[00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:26.350]  So to everybody out there that's jumping off the ledge, we have to support Israel at all costs.
[00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:30.350]  I would just ask, what if that cost is World War III?
[00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:35.350]  What if that cost is our homeland, the United States of America, getting under attack?
[00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.350]  Do you still think we should support Israel at all costs?
[00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:45.350]  Who's asking these questions? Who's considering these things in their heightened rhetoric?
[00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.350]  Another thing I'm noticing.
[00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.350]  We humanize one side of these stories, but not the other.
[00:25:55.350 --> 00:26:01.350]  And this doesn't just apply to Israel versus Palestine.
[00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.350]  This applies to really everything, doesn't it?
[00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.350]  We never humanized the war in Yemen.
[00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:16.350]  We don't humanize what goes on in the Middle East.
[00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:22.350]  We don't humanize what goes on in the streets of the United States of America.
[00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.350]  Pick any major American city.
[00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:33.350]  This last weekend, there were multiple victims of gun violence.
[00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:37.350]  Dozens wounded, dozens killed.
[00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:39.350]  We don't humanize that.
[00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:50.350]  We don't humanize the American suffering in the streets of Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, St. Louis, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland.
[00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:51.350]  I could go on.
[00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:53.350]  We don't humanize that.
[00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.350]  We don't draw emotional responses over that.
[00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.350]  We could, but we don't.
[00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.350]  And by the way, that's in your own backyard.
[00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:10.350]  That's right here in your own country where those humans are suffering.
[00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:23.350]  But you get more emotional over a holy war, centuries-old holy wars, on the other side of the planet that really doesn't even have to affect you.
[00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.350]  Why?
[00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.350]  Why?
[00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:38.350]  Why is it that I hear about all the atrocities that happened in Israel, but when I see an entire city in Gaza completely leveled, I'm not supposed to be emotional.
[00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:39.350]  I'm supposed to celebrate.
[00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.350]  Why?
[00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:49.350]  And there was a major controversy over a statement released by the Israeli government and Netanyahu where they said,
[00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.350]  savages and animals, and they clarified, we didn't call them animals.
[00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.350]  We called them savages.
[00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.350]  And we weren't talking about the Palestinians.
[00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.350]  We were talking about Hamas.
[00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.350]  Okay, well, I guess you could call Hamas savages.
[00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.350]  I don't think too many people would argue that after what we saw.
[00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:16.350]  But are you telling me that the hundreds of buildings you just flattened in Gaza where Palestinians were living, are they all Hamas?
[00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.350]  Are they all savages?
[00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.350]  So that double standard doesn't make sense to me.
[00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:25.350]  You make sure to clarify that the Palestinians in Gaza are not savages.
[00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:27.350]  You're only talking about Hamas.
[00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:32.350]  But then you go and completely level the Palestinians in Gaza.
[00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.350]  And then they don't get humanized.
[00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.350]  So I'm just asking questions here, folks.
[00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.350]  I'm not picking a side.
[00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.350]  I'm just asking questions.
[00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:47.350]  And quite frankly, if I am choosing any side, I'm choosing the side of the United States of America.
[00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:53.350]  Because we got our own problems right here in our front yards, our backyards, our kitchens, our living rooms, our bedrooms.
[00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:57.350]  That we need to address before stuff that goes on on the other side of the world.
[00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.350]  Last year we put this book out.
[00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:05.350]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.350]  It became a number one national bestseller.
[00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:11.350]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.350]  The Great Awakening.
[00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.350]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.350]  This is such a powerful book.
[00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:20.350]  It covers all the globalist plans.
[00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.350]  The latest developments.
[00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.350]  How to stop them.
[00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:27.350]  And then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.350]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:31.350]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.

[00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.350]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.350]  I thought it was next week.
[00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.350]  I come in this morning.
[00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.350]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.350]  Body's Ultimate Terminal Formula.
[00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.350]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:12.350]  Overhead shot, please.
[00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.350]  Look how full this bottle is.

[00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:33.350]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.350]  This is 95%.
[00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.350]  Super constant.
[00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:41.350]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:43.350]  It's that powerful.
[00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.350]  Or more.

[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:08.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:37.300]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:34:02.300]  Now, again, I ask, because many people who I thought understood this, we've seen a whole political movement in this country, a new renaissance in this country that understands how propaganda works more than ever before.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:20.300]  We call it the fake news. We have the congressional approval rating, the lowest it's ever been. We understand that the media lies to us. We understand that our politicians lie to us. But I'm sure we're getting the full truth on the situation in Israel.
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:28.300]  No. No. I'm not going to think that way.
[00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:53.300]  And I want to rewind the clocks back to a famous moment of propaganda that got us into a war. Because you notice there's always a consistency before a large war. There's a false flag, there's a big lie, there's an emotionally driven response, and then there's a devastating war.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:07.300]  Now, I'm not an insane person. And I know that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it. And doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:19.300]  That's not going to be us here at InfoWars, even if that means swimming upstream, even if that means hitting the barbed wire first.
[00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:43.300]  But let's rewind the clocks back. This is not even debated anymore. And I'll show you with all the different headlines. But you may recall this famous moment in 1990 that got us into the Gulf War. Emotional. Children. And a giant lie. Do you remember this?
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:36:01.300]  My mother and I were in Kuwait on August 2nd for a peaceful summer holiday. My older sister had a baby on July 29th. And we wanted to spend some time in Kuwait with her. I only pray that none of my 10th grade classmates had a summer vacation like I did.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:22.300]  I may have wished sometime that I could be an adult. That I could grow up quickly. What I saw happen to the children of Kuwait and to my country has changed my life forever. It has changed the life of all Kuwaitis, young and old. We are children no more.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:43.300]  My sister with my 5-year-old nephew traveled across the desert to safety. There was no milk available for the baby in Kuwait. They barely escaped when their car was stuck in the desert sand and help came from Saudi Arabia.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:37:04.300]  I stayed behind and wanted to do something for my country. The second week after invasion, I volunteered at the Al-Adhan Hospital with 12 other women who wanted to help as well. I was the youngest volunteer. Other women were from 20 to 30 years old.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:31.300]  While I was there, I saw Iraqi soldiers coming to the hospital with guns. They took the babies out of incubators. Took the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor. It was horrifying. I could not help but think of my nephew, who if born premature might have died that day as well.
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:51.300]  Now it is not even disputed that that entire testimony was fake. And you can do a quick internet search and find hundreds if not thousands of articles. I mean here's some I just decided to print just for brevity's sake.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:38:05.300]  I mean even leftist, I mean liberal websites all admit this. Of course they were anti-war at the time because there was a Republican in office, George Bush. So they're anti-war when a Republican in office. They're pro-war when a Democrat in office.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:19.300]  But I mean let's just look here. Here are the headlines. It's not even questioned. How false testimony and a massive U.S. propaganda machine bolstered George H.W. Bush's war on Iraq. Democracy now.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:39.300]  Washington Post, the Kuwaiti incubator hoax. The fake news in 1990 that propelled the United States into the first Gulf War. The great lie of the Gulf War, how a false testimony changed the public view of the war.
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:49.300]  Kuwait's story of babies removed from incubators refuses to die, even though it was fake.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:39:12.300]  Propaganda, remember the Kuwaiti babies. Now again, hundreds if not thousands of these stories, it's not even debated anymore that that was war propaganda to get the United States involved in the Middle East and the Gulf War.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:38.300]  And it's not the only time there's been a false flag to get us into war. We were lied to about the Gulf of Tonkin. And if the theories are true that Netanyahu or intelligence networks let Hamas have this attack so that they can launch a further war, that wouldn't be the first time that has happened either.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:40:00.300]  So, yeah, I understand the emotional response. I'm not a heartless, soulless person. When you see the story and the headlines, Hamas slaughters 40 babies and children in one town with some beheaded, Israeli military and government says, yeah, that's that's about as bad as it gets.
[00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:24.300]  That's about as horrific as you can imagine. But you know what? When you are at war and you are in the field and you are in the trenches, and I'm not here comparing myself to field warriors, but you know, we are in an info war and I am in the trenches here and you got to keep a level head.
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:36.300]  And you can't get distracted. And you can't get manipulated. And you can't get deceived. And so that's not going to be us. That's not going to be me.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:56.300]  Now, am I saying that this is fake news? Am I saying that they're lying about this? Am I saying they false flag this? No, I'm not saying that either. I'm just saying I know propaganda exists in times of war. I know false flags lead us into more war.
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:41:14.300]  And I know how they use the emotions of people with deception to get more support for wars. For reasons and benefits that are not for the very citizens and the people they claim that they are for.
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:38.300]  And there's a reason why I have consciously decided to not show any of the footage really from what's been going on since this weekend. Now, obviously, some of it we just know is true. Some of it's just live cameras and live reporting like all the bombing of we seeing of the Gaza Strip today.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:42:00.300]  But, you know, some of the videos that I'm seeing of the kids, like, for example, one video was going around with a bunch of kids in cages. Everybody's saying, look at what Hamas is doing to kids. Totally fake. Totally fake. Video from years ago. And really the origins of it are debated whether it was in Syria or whether it was even Palestinian kids in cages.
[00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:22.300]  They don't know. But everybody shared this video. Ted Cruz, Mark Levin. Look at what the Palestinians are doing. Look at what Hamas is doing. Putting Israeli babies in cages. Fake news propaganda. I don't even want to get into all the Israeli Instagram models that they have now in these videos.
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:40.300]  Again, I'm just not showing any of that stuff because I don't know what's real. I don't know what's not real. And I am going to make damn sure I'm not part of promoting any war propaganda or any false flag propaganda to manipulate this audience emotionally and draw us into a larger conflict.
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:58.300]  And again, I ask to those saying we must support Israel at all costs. What if the cost is World War Three? And what if the cost is us going to war, your sons and daughters going to war or an attack on our homeland? Should we still support Israel there? Just asking.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:22.300]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody? Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else? Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them. But we're not just exposing their operation. In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative to Klaus Schwab's you will eat the bugs.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:50.300]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalist and launch the second great renaissance.

[00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:07.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:35.720]  Honored to be joined by Dr. Francis Boyle today, and his geopolitical expertise is much
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:38.120]  appreciated.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:41.840]  And I want to kind of clarify something I said in the last segment, and then let Dr.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:45.640]  Boyle finish his statements, because again, you're just getting into, really, it's more
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.900]  just legalese talk.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:54.360]  It's international law when it comes to war and war crimes that you are citing here.
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:57.520]  And it's funny, because I don't really see that anywhere else, Dr. Boyle.
[01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:01.340]  It seems to be you, I know you're not the only man with that knowledge, but you seem
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:03.520]  to be the only one presenting it to the public.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.360]  And of course, it's right here on InfoWars.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:10.620]  Just to clarify what I said in the last segment, most of the international community is standing
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:11.620]  with Israel.
[01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:18.420]  I mean, we see that not just in America, California lights up its capital in white and blue, and
[01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:23.140]  you have Australia, and you have all these other, and Europe, and all these countries
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.500]  supporting Israel, they're all in for Israel.
[01:21:25.500 --> 01:21:31.780]  But yet, what you're referring to here is what the international law is when it comes
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:35.360]  to war and the Geneva Convention.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.520]  And so, the only statement I've ever seen anywhere near to what you're talking about,
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.560]  it did come from the UN.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.920]  Not many people heard it, but there was a statement at the UN basically condemning
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.100]  Israel for what they've done to Palestine.
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:53.220]  But outside of that, why do you suppose nobody's talking about what you're talking about?
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:57.800]  And why do you think, I mean, it appears, I would say, most of the international community
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:01.580]  is fully in support of what Israel is doing here.
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:06.380]  Well, first of all, it's not mostly the international community.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:12.920]  You have 2 billion Muslims that oppose what's going on here.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:18.720]  And you have 58 members of the Islamic Conference organization that oppose what's going on
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720]  here.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:30.260]  But yes, the Western news media, except for InfoWars, is under Zionist control, domination,
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:41.740]  funding, executives, pundits, experts, just watch it, ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, BBC.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:46.260]  It's all being told from the Zionist perspective.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:56.540]  So of course, you don't hear any of the considerations I'm talking about here today, because the
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:00.800]  international law is all against, is against Israel.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:09.520]  Again, that was decided by the International Court of Justice in their advisory opinion
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.920]  on Israel's wall.
[01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:19.560]  And let me repeat, here's a review of my book, quote, the advisory opinion of the International
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:25.420]  Court of Justice on the Israeli wall, published in July, could almost stand alone as a review
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:27.940]  of Professor Francis Boyle's book.
[01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:34.620]  The World Court judges comprehensively confirm and validate his work in elaborating the case
[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:37.720]  for the Palestinians in international law.
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:38.720]  That is correct.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:49.160]  I've been arguing for, you know, the Palestinians since I entered Harvard in 1971 as an ardent
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160]  Palestinian supporter.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.520]  That's why I don't teach at Harvard.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:58.920]  But the Western news media is just not, not going to report all this, it's Zionist control
[01:23:58.920 --> 01:23:59.920]  dominated.
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.920]  It's that simple.
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:06.000]  You know, I don't know how much more you want to lean into that, but I'm glad you brought
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.160]  that up because there's a wild phenomenon that happens here at InfoWars and it's not
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:17.080]  that I want to get any, any, any fuel to these, to these wild eyed, deranged people.
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.840]  But it's funny because you'll, and I know this is happening today.
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:22.280]  I can, I can just hear it.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:24.400]  I can just hear it telepathically.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:27.880]  The people that are tuned in, that are, that are fully in support of Israel and they buy
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.720]  into this, that, oh, Hamas is obviously the only problem here.
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:35.160]  And I'm just trying to remain neutral, at least for the sake of this interview.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]  And I can hear them.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.640]  Hamas are the terrorists, they beheaded babies, they raped women in the streets, they dragged
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.640]  them.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.640]  They're the bad guys.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.640]  What's wrong with you?
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.640]  Why aren't you condemning this?
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:45.640]  And I can hear that.
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:51.360]  But it's funny because at the same time, there are people who are completely convinced that
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:56.120]  InfoWars or Alex Jones or myself is somehow in the Zionist controlled media.
[01:24:56.120 --> 01:25:01.920]  And so it's, it's this wacko thing where if you actually try to be neutral and you actually
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:07.480]  try to just deliver the reality of the situation, all these wild eyed conspiracies arise.
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.360]  So I'm just, I'm glad that you mentioned that today because it's something that sticks in
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.680]  my crawl here where it's like you get accused of being X and then somebody else accuses
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.560]  you of being Y and really you're neither, you're just neutral in this situation.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:24.920]  But I don't know if you want to lean into that further because I do think this is a heavy
[01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:25.920]  topic.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:30.520]  Why is it that so many people, even people that didn't fall for the whole war in Ukraine
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:37.120]  being supported 24-7, immediately they're all in to support Israel?
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:43.480]  Zionist brainwashing in the news media and in higher education.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.120]  I spent seven years at Harvard.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.760]  I have three degrees from Harvard.
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:51.120]  I spent two years teaching there at Harvard.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.280]  Everything on the Middle East is taught from a Zionist perspective.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:56.280]  It's that simple.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:05.640]  And, you know, it's true at the other Ivy Leagues as well, lead educational institutions.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:13.040]  I mean, look, I was as pro-Israel as anyone else until the 1967 war.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.240]  I had been brainwashed to support Israel.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:23.800]  But when the 1967 war came, just looking at it objectively as you're calling for here,
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:25.320]  Israel struck first.
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.760]  It was acts of serial aggression around to the Arab states.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:43.400]  They ethically cleansed the inhabitants out of the West Bank, out of Gaza, out of the
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.680]  Golan Heights and stole this land.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.760]  So I concluded that everything I had been told about Israel was a total lie and I better
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.040]  study it.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:58.160]  So I went to college and starting in 1969, I began studying it.
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:07.680]  So but, you know, the whole milieu here in the United States is pretty much Zionist controlled
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.280]  and dominated.
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:13.280]  That's been my experience since 1967.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:18.960]  By the way, I have seen from Orthodox Jews, you don't see this in the media and of course
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:23.880]  nobody wants to promote this, but I have seen many Orthodox Jews that I mean, even
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:28.760]  in response to these recent attacks, many Orthodox Jews saying that they decry Zionism
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:31.000]  and they even decry the state of Israel.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.200]  You don't ever hear from that.
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:34.240]  I would ask you this.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.380]  We got 60 seconds till the break and we'll pick it up on the other side.
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.000]  Do you think and I don't want to I don't want to hearken too much to 9-11 here, but I mean,
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.240]  sure, could the U.S. have allowed 9-11 to happen to start a further war?
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.560]  Do you think Israeli intelligence could have allowed this attack over the weekend to launch
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:55.120]  a further war?
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:59.920]  There are two theories here on what one you are correct.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:05.800]  This could have been that Israeli intelligence and Netanyahu knew what was going to happen
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:13.680]  and let it happen because he was domestically in a desperate situation over there.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:18.880]  And this now allows him to appear a warlord.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:25.720]  The second interpretation, however, is this is very similar to what happened in 1973 with
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:27.760]  the Yom Kippur War.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:34.720]  The Israeli officials treat Palestinians as if they're children.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.960]  I've been there myself.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.960]  I've seen it.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:37.960]  It's disgusting.
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:48.560]  That, oh, we're the great Zionist ubermensch and you're the little bitty Palestinian untermensch.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.560]  And you need to do just what we tell you to do.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.880]  All right, Dr. Francis Boyle, hold that thought.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:58.880]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:02.940]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:06.640]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk, everybody else?
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:10.880]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.880]  them.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.000]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:19.640]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.720]  to Klaus Schwab's you will eat the bugs.
[01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:27.640]  This is the great awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:28.840]  renaissance.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:32.640]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:35.560]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.720]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:16.040]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.

[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.080]  an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.080]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.

[01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:19.120]  Pregnenolone levels decrease with age and low levels are associated with fatigue, low

[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:00.480]  Do you like RainForce?
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:01.480]  Yeah.
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:02.480]  Yeah.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.480]  So my name is Ken Heckenladley.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:05.520]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.440]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkiewicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:11.840]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.160]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.080]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:23.080]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:28.480]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:33.560]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the

[01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:25.430]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:30.430]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:35.430]  Having a conversation here with Dr. Francis Boyle, and I want to pick it up where we left off.
[01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:38.430]  Let me frame it back up for you here, Dr. Boyle.
[01:33:38.430 --> 01:33:44.430]  Would the U.S. have allowed Pearl Harbor to happen, to get involved in a larger war?
[01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:48.430]  Would the U.S. have allowed 9-11 to happen, to get involved in a larger war?
[01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:56.430]  Would Israel have allowed the attacks over the weekend to happen, to further their incursion on the Gaza Strip?
[01:33:56.430 --> 01:34:02.430]  And I guess I would maybe even want you, if you would, to start with this.
[01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:07.430]  I mean, there's no debate that the state of Israel has one of the most secure airspaces,
[01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:10.430]  if not the most secure airspace in the world,
[01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:15.430]  as well as one of the most advanced and penetrating intelligence networks in the world.
[01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:25.430]  And we see men flying in with parachutes and rifles, killing people at a music festival.
[01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:28.430]  I mean, do you believe that that could have happened organically?
[01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:31.430]  Do you think there was a legitimate intelligence failure?
[01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:33.430]  Or again, could they have let it happen?
[01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:36.430]  Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:34:36.430 --> 01:34:38.430]  Well, Owen, you're right.
[01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:43.430]  President Roosevelt knew full well that there was going to be an attack at Pearl Harbor.
[01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:48.430]  And he let it happen because he wanted in on the Second World War.
[01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:56.430]  9-11, I think all the evidence shows that the United States government knew it was happening.
[01:34:56.430 --> 01:35:00.430]  And the Bush administration wanted it to happen and let it happen.
[01:35:00.430 --> 01:35:07.430]  So, yes, I'm not ruling out that Netanyahu knew full well that this was going to happen.
[01:35:08.430 --> 01:35:17.430]  And he let it happen because of his own internal predicament that he had there in Israel.
[01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:23.430]  Now, here's an interesting one, because my crew is always out there looking at stories and angles as well.
[01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:25.430]  Very important crew that we have here.
[01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:29.430]  And there's another angle I want to bring up that they brought to my attention.
[01:35:29.430 --> 01:35:30.430]  But here's an interesting one.
[01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:35.430]  Remember last week they had that giant emergency alert system test.
[01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:38.430]  Well, apparently that's being used now in Israel.
[01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:43.430]  And Israel is using the emergency alert system to tell everybody in Gaza to flee,
[01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:47.430]  as they basically are turning it into a parking lot.
[01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:51.430]  But they're saying, hmm, is this maybe evidence that they knew it was coming,
[01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:55.430]  but they did the test here to make sure the system works so that they could use it in Gaza?
[01:35:55.430 --> 01:35:57.430]  I don't know if you want to comment on that.
[01:35:58.430 --> 01:36:05.430]  Or pick up where you left off, talking about kind of the cultural aspects of Israel and the Palestinians
[01:36:05.430 --> 01:36:13.430]  and how they kind of look down upon them, or as you, I would say, described it earlier, as being racist.
[01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:18.430]  Right. Well, as for the first point, I really don't know,
[01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:22.430]  except there's nowhere for the two million people in Gaza to go.
[01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:24.430]  Israel knows it.
[01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:27.430]  And as you said, they're going to turn Gaza into a parking lot.
[01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:33.430]  They'll kill tens of thousands if they have to simply exterminate them.
[01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:40.430]  But as for the second part, right, I spent many years working with the Palestinians,
[01:36:40.430 --> 01:36:47.430]  and whenever they are there in the company of Israelis, I'm oftentimes there,
[01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:48.430]  they treat them like children.
[01:36:48.430 --> 01:36:52.430]  It's outright a racist mentality.
[01:36:52.430 --> 01:37:01.430]  I would say, again, it's we are the Zionist ubermensch, and you are the Palestinian untermensch,
[01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:07.430]  and you should just do what we tell you to do and be glad to do it.
[01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:12.430]  So they've grossly underestimated the Palestinians.
[01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:13.430]  I've worked with them.
[01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:20.430]  They're very bright, intelligent, hardworking people, extremely well educated.
[01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:31.430]  So that also could be a factor here, because we don't want to deny a Palestinian agency what happened here.
[01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:36.430]  Let me ask you this then, because I hear this notion brainied about all the time too,
[01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:40.430]  which is, well, the Palestinians have been given the opportunity.
[01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:41.430]  They've been given the Gaza Strip.
[01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:43.430]  They could have turned it into a Tel Aviv.
[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:44.430]  That was the argument.
[01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:45.430]  They'll turn it into a Tel Aviv.
[01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:47.430]  They'll turn it into a Miami.
[01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:48.430]  And they didn't.
[01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:53.430]  What's your response to that?
[01:37:53.430 --> 01:38:02.430]  Well, it was Hamas that drove the Zionists out of Gaza Strip in 2005.
[01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:09.430]  That's what qualifies them as a national liberation movement.
[01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:18.430]  And then starting in 2007, Israel, after Hamas won a free, fair election over there,
[01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:25.430]  which, by the way, was supported by President Bush Jr. and Condoleezza Rice,
[01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:36.430]  Israel imposed a genocidal economic embargo upon them to prevent them from engaging in economic development.
[01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:45.430]  So, you know, Israel has only itself to blame for the deplorable circumstances in Gaza
[01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:53.430]  that motivated Hamas to undertake this act of national liberation as they saw it.
[01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:58.430]  If I may respond here, not to put words in your mouth, so correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:38:58.430 --> 01:39:05.430]  So essentially you're saying Israel and the powers that be never allowed the Gaza Strip to be turned into a new Tel Aviv.
[01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:07.430]  No.
[01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:11.430]  And indeed, I've been over there.
[01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:17.430]  You know, the Palestinians are extremely talented, industrious, hardworking and intelligent.
[01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:22.430]  If given a fair, reasonable chance, they would have done it.
[01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:25.430]  But they've never been been given that chance.
[01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:32.430]  Now, it's hard for me to tell what's real, what's not, what's propaganda, what's not.
[01:39:32.430 --> 01:39:34.430]  And I like to tread lightly on these things.
[01:39:34.430 --> 01:39:37.430]  And so I'd like to get your analysis on this.
[01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:43.430]  But it would appear that all the official numbers and these date back really decades.
[01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:50.430]  But even if you look at modern history, all the numbers in this struggle between Israel and Palestine,
[01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:55.430]  the Palestinians have suffered death at a tenfold rate compared to Israel.
[01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:58.430]  Is that accurate?
[01:39:58.430 --> 01:39:59.430]  That's correct.
[01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:05.430]  Even worse than that, if you go back to the Nakba in 1948,
[01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:14.430]  which what I originally studied at the University of Chicago in 1969 in great length,
[01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:24.430]  my course on Middle East politics there, far superior to anything they dish out at Harvard and went through all the literature.
[01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:31.430]  Right. Israel just engaged in massive ethnic cleansing of a half million Palestinians,
[01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:42.430]  driven into exile around the world, driven into Gaza, driven into the West Bank to refugee camps.
[01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:49.430]  And then again, happening again, the Naksa in 1967.
[01:40:49.430 --> 01:40:59.430]  So, you know, if you took the casualties up, the Zionist casualties have been minimal compared to what the Palestinians have suffered.
[01:40:59.430 --> 01:41:08.430]  Right. Now, this is a little bit more of a wonky question, and maybe you can figure out a way to make it palatable.
[01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:12.430]  Why is the USA so attached at the hip to Israel?
[01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:17.430]  I hear this from politicians and people in media, the US, we need Israel.
[01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:19.430]  We need Israel. We couldn't exist without Israel.
[01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:23.430]  I mean, I scratch my head at that. I'll hold my tongue.
[01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:27.430]  But why why is the United States so attached at the hip to Israel?
[01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:31.430]  Who needs who in this relationship?
[01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:34.430]  Well, first of all, Israel needs us.
[01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:40.430]  I mean, I dealt with Shimon Peres, the former prime minister.
[01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:45.430]  At one point he said, we are completely dependent on the United States.
[01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:50.430]  And that is correct. Without the United States, Israel would be a failed state.
[01:41:50.430 --> 01:41:57.430]  There's no question about that. But American Jews have gotten together.
[01:41:57.430 --> 01:42:05.430]  They've gotten organized. They've put together the different many different lobbying groups.
[01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:09.430]  They've raised a lot of money. They're quite politically active.
[01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:19.430]  And they bribe, threaten, intimidate and blacklist all their opponents, especially in Congress.
[01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:26.430]  You could read the book by my friend, the late Paul Finley, here from Illinois.
[01:42:26.430 --> 01:42:32.430]  He used to represent Abe Lincoln's district, a Republican, called They Dare to Speak Out.
[01:42:32.430 --> 01:42:43.430]  If you speak out, the Zionist lobby here in the United States will slate you for destruction, as they did Congressman Finley.
[01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:49.430]  Also, our Senator Chuck Percy, very fine senator, I supported him.
[01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:55.430]  They destroyed his career. So that's that's why. That's why you only hear this.
[01:42:55.430 --> 01:43:01.430]  Now, I heard you say that. I heard you say the word their money, money.
[01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:09.430]  I mean, how how do the Zionists have enough money to influence American foreign policy?
[01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:14.430]  Well, it's like any other lobbying group. I mean, American Jews have been very successful.
[01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:20.430]  So they they put their money into these different lobbying groups.
[01:43:20.430 --> 01:43:29.430]  You know, ADL, AIPAC, Conference of Jewish President Organizations, et cetera.
[01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:38.430]  And then it's not just money buying people off, but it's threatening to destroy your career and actually destroy your career.
[01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:47.430]  If you speak out on behalf of the Palestinians or you you criticize what Israel is doing,
[01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:55.430]  ADL and AIPAC maintain enemies list of what they deem to be enemies of Israel.
[01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:59.430]  I'm on both lists and people on that list.
[01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:04.430]  They'll destroy if they can. So that's that's just the way it goes.
[01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:14.430]  Sure. Yeah. And again, this this gets into the wacky nature of it is you can get put on these ADL anti-Semite lists
[01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:19.430]  and then you'll have other whack jobs out there saying that you're a Zionist shill and Zionist controlled.
[01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:24.430]  But I guess so. It's kind of like the whole just point your finger and call your enemy a racist.
[01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:28.430]  And then that destroys them in the in the court of public opinion.
[01:44:28.430 --> 01:44:32.430]  So is it really that simple? They just they can have these groups like the ADL.
[01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:38.430]  They just label you an anti-Semite and then any dissent is is squashed.
[01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:43.430]  Well, it's not just labeling you an anti-Semite. They're labeling you an enemy of Israel.
[01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:48.430]  They go after Jews, too, who speak out and criticize.
[01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:53.430]  I had several Jewish friends who have criticized Israel.
[01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:58.430]  They they destroyed their careers. They've asked me for to assist them.
[01:44:58.430 --> 01:45:03.430]  I've tried, but that's just the way they work. So it's not a question of any.
[01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:07.430]  So I'm sure they'll blame you with being an anti-Semite.
[01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:14.430]  I've been Zionists have accused me of everything but being a child molester for my support for the Palestinians.
[01:45:14.430 --> 01:45:22.430]  But it's they'll go after Jews, too. Indeed, they'll treat Jews worse than the rest of us.
[01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:28.430]  They they treat Jews who criticize Israel as as traitors.
[01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:35.430]  What can I say? You have my friend, Professor Norman Finkelstein, there at DePaul Law School,
[01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:41.430]  who wrote a book exposing Alan Dershowitz as a as a plagiarist.
[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:46.430]  And they destroyed his career there at DePaul. And DePaul is supposed to be Catholic.
[01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:51.430]  And they they let Dershowitz, the other Zionists, get away with destroying his career.
[01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:54.430]  And he's been blacklisted. He can't get hired anywhere.
[01:45:54.430 --> 01:46:00.430]  Despite his outstanding academic qualifications, Ph.D. from Princeton, whatever.
[01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:04.430]  That's that's the way they work. Now, how accurate?
[01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:09.430]  I want to get back into that in a second. But the crew just put an image up on the screen.
[01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:13.430]  And I kind of always felt this way. And maybe this is a mundane explanation,
[01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:18.430]  but it's got the rockets going up from are going into Israel.
[01:46:18.430 --> 01:46:22.430]  And then it's got the Iron Dome rockets going up to blow up those rockets.
[01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:27.430]  And it's U.S. taxpayer dollars on each side. Now, I think there's an element of truth to that.
[01:46:27.430 --> 01:46:33.430]  I don't know if that's, you know, directly a perfect visual of how this goes.
[01:46:33.430 --> 01:46:38.430]  But to me, it feels like this is a lot of the same. It's the same weapons manufacturers.
[01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:47.430]  It's the same groups funding both sides. How accurate to you, Dr. Boyle, is that image that we had on the screen?
[01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:53.430]  Well, we have to understand, you know, Hamas doesn't really have rockets like like Israel.
[01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:59.430]  We give Israel advanced, sophisticated munitions, precision gun weapons.
[01:46:59.430 --> 01:47:09.430]  I mean, the Hamas shooting there, they're for the most part sort of high grade fireworks is what they are.
[01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:13.430]  They're more for public relations purposes.
[01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:20.430]  They're really, you know, killing people, whereas what Israel is doing is just wiping people.
[01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:25.430]  Now, people are saying people are saying let me just interject, because people are saying that that used to be the case.
[01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:30.430]  But it appears that Hamas has a lot more firepower now.
[01:47:30.430 --> 01:47:36.430]  They do. I'm not exactly sure where they got it, but it does appear they have more firepower at this point.
[01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:40.430]  Yes, because they need it for self-defense as they see it.
[01:47:40.430 --> 01:47:48.430]  Right. The Zionists are out to destroy them and kill as many Palestinians as possible.
[01:47:48.430 --> 01:47:57.430]  We we have to fear another Nakba from what Netanyahu has been has been saying here.
[01:47:57.430 --> 01:48:09.430]  It looks like they, you know, if they get away with it, they'd like to drive the entire two million population of Gaza into into Egypt, into the Sinai.
[01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:16.430]  That could happen again. They've mobilized over 300000 troops to to go into Gaza.
[01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:22.430]  So we're going to see a massive human tragedy here.
[01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:27.430]  Yeah, that that when I saw the rhetoric from Netanyahu, I was afraid of the worst.
[01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:36.430]  And even though they've been bombing Gaza for, I guess, almost 24 hours now, they're saying this is just the beginning.
[01:48:36.430 --> 01:48:41.430]  The land invasion is next. What that will look like, I guess only time will tell.
[01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:47.430]  I want to go back to what you were mentioning. Yeah, go ahead. Let me point there, though.
[01:48:47.430 --> 01:49:01.430]  The Biden administration has only exacerbated the situation by saying we are going to give blank check support to everything Israel is going to do to the Palestinians.
[01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:07.430]  They know full well there's going to be massive genocide in Gaza.
[01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:15.430]  And instead of the Biden administration saying, stop now, let's have a ceasefire on both sides.
[01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:26.430]  They have encouraged they are arming, equipping and supplying what is going to be a massive tragedy here in Gaza that could very well spill out of control.
[01:49:26.430 --> 01:49:34.430]  We already have a shooting there by Hezbollah into the border area.
[01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:42.430]  If Hezbollah gets involved, as they did in 2006, there'll be massive death and destruction on both sides.
[01:49:42.430 --> 01:49:48.430]  Remember, in 2006, Israel did invade Gaza. Hamas fought back.
[01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:54.430]  Over a thousand Palestinians were massacred. And at that point, Hezbollah entered the war.
[01:49:54.430 --> 01:50:00.430]  And Hezbollah is very well armed compared to the Palestinians.
[01:50:00.430 --> 01:50:07.430]  They don't have just these advanced firecrackers. They've got rockets.
[01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:12.430]  And to me at that point, correct me if I'm wrong, but to me at that point, it's basically Iran getting involved.
[01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:16.430]  And now we're one inch away from World War Three.
[01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:33.430]  Well, I would not say Iran. We have to be careful here, Owen, because the diehard neocon Zionists here in the United States are trying to use this as a pretext to attack Iran.
[01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:40.430]  Now, as of yesterday, both Blinken and Kirby have said they've seen no evidence that that Iran is involved.
[01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:48.430]  But there is going to be enormous pressure for us and Israel to attack Iran.
[01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:51.430]  Things could get out of control. You're right.
[01:50:51.430 --> 01:51:01.430]  There are Iranian forces in Syria. They're at the request of the Syrian government, which makes it legal under international law.
[01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:09.430]  And Syria could get involved. Hezbollah could get involved. Egypt could get involved.
[01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:14.430]  Jordan, we have to understand how unstable Jordan is.
[01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:22.430]  The Hashemite family, the British put them in power, took them up from Saudi Arabia and put them in power.
[01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:29.430]  And then we took over and the CIA keeps the Hashemite family there in power.
[01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:35.430]  Half their population is Palestinian. So this area itself could could blow up.
[01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:50.430]  And indeed, I'm afraid that is why the Biden administration sent off this aircraft carrier strike force under the Ford, because they know what Israel is planning to do.
[01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:59.430]  And they know that that will produce a terrible, adverse reaction, certainly in the surrounding Arab states.
[01:51:59.430 --> 01:52:03.430]  You know, you bring up the CIA. I was going to go in the direction of Mossad.
[01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:08.430]  Talk about Israel controlling our foreign policy. Is that Mossad? Is that blackmail?
[01:52:08.430 --> 01:52:15.430]  Is that the Jeffrey Epstein types? Because I think there's an element of that at play here.
[01:52:15.430 --> 01:52:22.430]  Certainly with what we saw with Epstein being a spy and Epstein Island and the Lolita Express.
[01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:35.430]  That's correct. I mean, it's well known Epstein was a front man for Mossad and he was running a blackmailing operation there, the Lolita Express in Orji Island.
[01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:46.430]  And he had a lot of U.S. leaders, you know, they have a list of them there in Newsweek who were down there at Orji Island,
[01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:53.430]  found probably found in compromising positions with girls and films were taken.
[01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:58.430]  So, yes, blackmail is is part of it. Yes.
[01:52:58.430 --> 01:53:04.430]  All right. I don't want to take you out of your your league here, but I think you're probably in all the leagues.
[01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:09.430]  Now, this was brought to me by the crew. And it's funny, the only reason I'm aware of this is there is some some biblical stuff on this.
[01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:16.430]  But it was also this kind of cultural thing was was featured in a Russian film I watched that I liked called Branded.
[01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:27.430]  And that's the red heifer phenomenon. Are you familiar with the red heifer and what that means to Israel and specifically the Al-Asqa mosque that you mentioned earlier?
[01:53:27.430 --> 01:53:40.430]  Yes, there are these fanatical religious fundamentalist Jews who want to destroy Al-Asqa and build their so-called third temple.
[01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:47.430]  Well, you know, the second temple goes back to 70 A.D. I mean, destroyed by the Romans.
[01:53:47.430 --> 01:53:51.430]  That if they do this and they've tried to do this.
[01:53:51.430 --> 01:54:02.430]  And indeed, if you're following the press accounts now, you have thousands of these fanatical Jewish fundamentalists storming Haram al-Sharif,
[01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:10.430]  which is the plateau there and Al-Asqa threatening Al-Asqa, threatening to destroy Al-Asqa.
[01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:14.430]  That that would be a conflagration if if they were to do this. Yes.
[01:54:14.430 --> 01:54:18.430]  So I just want to read this out so that the audience that might say red heifer.
[01:54:18.430 --> 01:54:22.430]  What are you talking about? Here's just all these headlines that we have compiled here on the desk.
[01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:27.430]  The Red Heifer Project, Israeli government part of plan to build third temple at Al-Asqa.
[01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:31.430]  That was the holy ground of the Muslims that you were mentioning earlier.
[01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:35.430]  First red heifer born in 2000 years sparks fears of biblical end of days.
[01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:39.430]  Prophecy fulfilled after red cow is born at Temple of Israel.
[01:54:39.430 --> 01:54:43.430]  Jewish leaders in Israel needed a red heifer for temple ceremony.
[01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:47.430]  So Texas sent them five. We were we were doing this red heifer.
[01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:51.430]  Sacrifice could take place in one year in Jerusalem.
[01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:54.430]  Biblical red heifer could bring millions of visitors to Samaria.
[01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:56.430]  The red heifer in the third temple. End of times.
[01:54:56.430 --> 01:55:00.430]  Prophecy does a heifer herald bring the beginning of the third temple.
[01:55:00.430 --> 01:55:05.430]  And from Texas, Israel red heifers needed for temple arrival.
[01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:08.430]  And so I'm glad we had the time to bring this up.
[01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:12.430]  I'm not surprised that you had the knowledge to comment on that as well.
[01:55:12.430 --> 01:55:14.430]  Last two minutes here with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:18.430]  How would you like to make your closing statements here?
[01:55:18.430 --> 01:55:22.430]  Yes. Thank you for giving this time.
[01:55:22.430 --> 01:55:30.430]  I have tried since 1987 working with the highest level officials of the Palestinian movement,
[01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:36.430]  including Chairman Yasser Arafat, the PLO, to negotiate a two state solution,
[01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:41.430]  starting with the Palestinian Declaration of November 15, 1988,
[01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:46.430]  where the Palestinians officially accepted a two state solution.
[01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:49.430]  It's in there. You can read it. It was my idea.
[01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:53.430]  I was their legal advisor on this whole project.
[01:55:53.430 --> 01:56:02.430]  I was also at the Palestinian delegation for the Middle East peace negotiations, 1991 to 1993.
[01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:07.430]  But in my experience, going back to November 15, 1988,
[01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:15.430]  the Palestinian Declaration of Independence, accepting officially the two state solution
[01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:21.430]  on behalf of the Chairman Arafat, the PLO, the Palestine National Council.
[01:56:21.430 --> 01:56:30.430]  There has not been one iota of good faith demonstrated by Israel or American Zionists
[01:56:30.430 --> 01:56:36.430]  when it comes to the negotiation of a two state solution. Not one iota.
[01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:41.430]  And that, you know, they could have accepted, Israel could have accepted a two state solution
[01:56:41.430 --> 01:56:46.430]  as far back as December 1988.
[01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:50.430]  They refused. They have consistently refused.
[01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:58.430]  The Zionists want all of Palestine and with as few Palestinians as possible.
[01:56:58.430 --> 01:57:02.430]  That is their objective. That is their ultimate objective.
[01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:10.430]  That is what Netanyahu is going to be pursuing now in the coming weeks,
[01:57:10.430 --> 01:57:13.430]  unless we here in the United States stop them.
[01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:17.430]  It's that simple. And it could set off a total catastrophe.
[01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:23.430]  Certainly the destabilization there, Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan,
[01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:34.430]  and as usual, the United States will be there up to our necks in death and destruction.
[01:57:34.430 --> 01:57:39.430]  Dr. Francis Boyle, thank you for your time, your knowledge, your wisdom,
[01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:43.430]  and your expertise here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:49.430]  Well, again, thank you, Owen, for having me. I'm my best to everyone there.
[01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:53.430]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:57.430]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[01:57:57.430 --> 01:58:02.430]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[01:58:02.430 --> 01:58:04.430]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[01:58:04.430 --> 01:58:09.430]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world,
[01:58:09.430 --> 01:58:13.430]  an alternative to Klaus Schwab's, you will eat the bugs.

[02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:12.430]  naturally occurring caffeine with L-theanine, and so much more.
[02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:18.830]  The green tea extract, the herbamonte leaf extract, the beetroot, and so the Real Red
[02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:19.830]  Pill Plus.
[02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:30.510]  This is a flash sale, 40% off, a flash sale, 40% off the Real Red Pill Plus at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:02:30.510 --> 02:02:34.150]  Twenty-four hours and it will end.

[02:02:36.190 --> 02:02:41.870]  And by the way, it's the pregnenolone there that even works hand-in-glove with DNA Force
[02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:49.030]  Plus for telomere support with the CoQ10 and the PQQ, DNA Force Plus, the flagship
[02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:52.990]  elite supplement at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:55.910]  And so that's another way you can support us.
[02:02:55.910 --> 02:03:00.210]  Get the autographed book, get the great supplement, support your own health, support free speech
[02:03:00.210 --> 02:03:07.790]  and independent media, trying to get the truth out on the air like nobody else.
[02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:13.950]  One thing I do want to get into with my next guest, Joel Skousen, not just with his geopolitical
[02:03:13.950 --> 02:03:18.350]  wisdom, but also an emergency preparedness.
[02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:20.310]  And we'll probably get into a little bit of this.
[02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:25.510]  But folks, when you see this stuff breaking down around the world, if you don't have some
[02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:29.590]  survival instincts to think about what am I going to do for myself or my family if the
[02:03:29.590 --> 02:03:34.030]  worst happens, well, it's time to start kicking some of those things into gear.
[02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:37.030]  And step one might be getting emergency food supplies.
[02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:39.590]  Well, there's all kinds of things you could consider.
[02:03:39.590 --> 02:03:44.269]  Joel Skousen, my next guest, has written a bunch of books about this, strategic relocation
[02:03:44.269 --> 02:03:45.470]  and so much more.
[02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:47.350]  Well, maybe you can't relocate.
[02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:49.110]  Maybe you'd like to, but you can't right now.
[02:03:49.110 --> 02:03:50.910]  You got to have storable foods.
[02:03:50.910 --> 02:03:57.590]  Now we sell the highest quality, highest quality storable foods at the lowest price at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:03:57.590 --> 02:03:59.710]  This is the nexus that we went out and reached.
[02:03:59.710 --> 02:04:00.910]  You can do your own shopping.
[02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:01.910]  That's fine.
[02:04:01.910 --> 02:04:02.910]  But we've already done the shopping.
[02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:07.110]  What's the highest quality emergency food supply at the lowest price?
[02:04:07.110 --> 02:04:09.750]  That's what we want to sell at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:04:09.750 --> 02:04:14.510]  And that's what we have for you, 12-month supply, 6-month supply, 3-month supply, everything
[02:04:14.510 --> 02:04:16.110]  in between.
[02:04:16.110 --> 02:04:20.630]  And it's not just the high quality storable foods with the high calorie count.
[02:04:20.630 --> 02:04:23.630]  It's also the highest quality storage, too.
[02:04:23.630 --> 02:04:28.710]  So when you get your emergency food delivered to your door, it's ready to be stored.
[02:04:28.710 --> 02:04:32.110]  So you don't even have to worry about finding a way to store it or anything like that.
[02:04:32.110 --> 02:04:36.309]  It comes in a high quality container that is ready to be stored.
[02:04:36.309 --> 02:04:39.750]  If you don't want to store it, you can crack it right open and it's ready to be eaten as
[02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:40.750]  well.
[02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:42.910]  This is emergency food supplies.
[02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:47.470]  You'd rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
[02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:51.110]  And you see the way things are going right now under this current Biden regime.
[02:04:51.110 --> 02:04:54.390]  If you're not thinking about emergency food supplies, you're just not thinking.
[02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:55.390]  All right.
[02:04:55.390 --> 02:04:58.710]  We'll be right back with my next guest, Joel Scouser.
[02:04:58.710 --> 02:05:03.190]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:05:03.190 --> 02:05:06.790]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex
[02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:08.390]  slavery worldwide?
[02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:11.390]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:12.870]  Well, I know where you are.
[02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:17.309]  You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now, and I salute you and thank you.
[02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:20.950]  And I want to encourage all of you who've been in this fight so long to realize we've
[02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:26.150]  reached the critical juncture in the battle now, and a key tool in that fight is the Great
[02:05:26.150 --> 02:05:30.950]  Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:34.590]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:38.190]  It's a longer book, quite frankly, a more powerful book.
[02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:41.750]  And just like the last book went to number one, it is up to you to send us a number one
[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:42.750]  right now.
[02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:46.550]  This is a cultural fight against the globalists, and it funds the Infowar.
[02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:52.590]  Get signed or unsigned copies of The Great Awakening right now at Infowars.com.
[02:05:52.590 --> 02:05:54.190]  I want to thank you all for your support.

[02:06:05.790 --> 02:06:08.790]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:13.790]  It is The Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[02:06:14.790 --> 02:06:19.790]  All right, we're now joined this hour by Joel Skousen, worldaffairsbrief.com geopolitical
[02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:21.790]  expert also.
[02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:29.790]  He has authored many books such as The Essential Principles for the Conservation of Liberty,
[02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:33.790]  How to Implement a High Security Shelter in the Home.
[02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:36.790]  Hmm, that seems like knowledge you might want to have.
[02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:41.790]  And of course, Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places.
[02:06:41.790 --> 02:06:46.790]  We may be getting into some of that with Joel as well today, but obviously, Joel, the big
[02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:50.790]  story, the developments in Israel over the weekend, the developments in the Gaza Strip
[02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:51.790]  today.
[02:06:51.790 --> 02:06:55.790]  We're getting all kinds of experts' opinion and analysis on this.
[02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:59.790]  Joel, where would you like to begin on what we've seen there in that region in the last
[02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:00.790]  four days?
[02:07:02.790 --> 02:07:05.790]  Yeah, let's go ahead and start with Israel, Owen.
[02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:11.790]  Israel is propagandizing the world by saying this is their 9-11, implying that they can
[02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:17.790]  justify anything as the United States did after the attacks, which they themselves engineered.
[02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:22.790]  9-11 was a deep state operation from beginning to end, including the hiring of the terrorists
[02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:25.790]  and the loading of the buildings with explosives.
[02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:32.790]  But there's a slight difference in Israel, whereas we created our own attackers.
[02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:38.790]  In fact, the United States Deep State created not only Al Qaeda, but ISIS and set them off
[02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:40.790]  against the world.
[02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:46.790]  Israel did have a role in bringing Muslim Brotherhood to Israel to counteract Fatah
[02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:49.790]  and the PLO under Yasser Arafat.
[02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:51.790]  And it did get out of control.
[02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:56.790]  It wasn't the terrorist organization that they funded and they brought in, but it became
[02:07:56.790 --> 02:07:57.790]  that.
[02:07:57.790 --> 02:08:03.790]  So they are partially responsible, at least for bringing Hamas to the Gaza Strip.
[02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:08.790]  More importantly, though, they are responsible for ousting all the Israelis that used to live
[02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:14.790]  in the Gaza Strip and forcing them to leave their homes and their gardens and their huge
[02:08:14.790 --> 02:08:19.790]  enterprises that they had built up there and handing it over to the PLO and Hamas.
[02:08:19.790 --> 02:08:23.790]  They built a very high tech fence around the entire Gaza Strip and said, this is going
[02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:25.790]  to keep any terrorism down.
[02:08:25.790 --> 02:08:30.790]  It hasn't, but it is a very, very high tech fence, completely censored all around with
[02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:36.790]  cameras and even seismic detectors so they can detect from a few hundred feet away anyone
[02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:39.790]  even approaching that fence.
[02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:45.790]  But what happened in this attack is that over the past year and a half, the Israelis withdrew
[02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:52.790]  50 to 60, almost 80 percent of their troops, including any fast reaction forces they had
[02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:56.790]  in southern Israel at all, and moved them to the West Bank.
[02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:59.790]  Now, the West Bank is controlled by Israel.
[02:08:59.790 --> 02:09:01.790]  It's occupied territory.
[02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:05.790]  So they don't really have a huge terrorism problem there.
[02:09:05.790 --> 02:09:08.790]  You can't get organized there with Israeli occupation.
[02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:16.790]  And so removing the troops from that left only a half a dozen small isolated military
[02:09:16.790 --> 02:09:20.790]  outposts that didn't have any capability of doing fast reaction.
[02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:24.790]  Even though they had a few tanks there in southern Israel still, they didn't have any
[02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:26.790]  tank crews to man them.
[02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:34.790]  And so when these breaches occurred on Saturday night, they bulldozed through the fence.
[02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:40.790]  They got into, you know, lots of the cabooses and the small settlements in the area of southern
[02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:44.790]  and took them over and created a lot of hostages.
[02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:50.790]  The Israeli forces didn't arrive in the southern region until six or seven hours later.
[02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:54.790]  Now, you can't tell me that they didn't have enough knowledge.
[02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:57.790]  You know, Israel has spies all throughout Gaza.
[02:09:57.790 --> 02:10:00.790]  They infiltrated Syria at the highest levels.
[02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:03.790]  They infiltrated Iran at the highest levels.
[02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:10.790]  You can't tell me that they haven't got infiltrators into every aspect of both the PLO and Hamas.
[02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:15.790]  And so what really happened related to 9-11 is that Israel let this happen in order to
[02:10:15.790 --> 02:10:20.790]  justify tremendous international outrage at what Hamas did.
[02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:25.790]  But the outrage really should be directed at Israel for letting this happen.
[02:10:25.790 --> 02:10:29.790]  Now, they claim that they had a cyber attack on their computers and therefore they couldn't
[02:10:29.790 --> 02:10:31.790]  see the breaches in the fence.
[02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:33.790]  And that isn't true at all.
[02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:39.790]  There are numerous responses to the censors, all of which don't go to computers.
[02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:44.790]  All of the smaller outposts had censors to tell whether or not the fence was being breached.
[02:10:44.790 --> 02:10:47.790]  All of those weren't breached by cybersecurity.
[02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:50.790]  They made calls to the Israeli army telling them the breach is occurring.
[02:10:50.790 --> 02:10:56.790]  But they had no rapid reaction troops at all in southern Israel.
[02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:59.790]  And so this was allowed to happen.
[02:10:59.790 --> 02:11:03.790]  And now it's going to be very difficult to undo.
[02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:08.790]  It obviously gives the Israelis the opportunity to go in and clean out Hamas.
[02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:10.790]  But that's literally an impossibility.
[02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:16.790]  With 1.3 million people in Gaza, there's just no way that you're going to go in without
[02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:21.790]  a lot of casualties and do house-to-house fighting and root out Hamas, even though it
[02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:23.790]  really needs to be rooted out.
[02:11:23.790 --> 02:11:27.790]  And so they're going to go back to the traditional view of bombing Gaza.
[02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:32.790]  And we've seen lots of apartment buildings exploded and demolished.
[02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:35.790]  And that's because, you know, they have intelligence.
[02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:40.790]  Hamas and other allies have been living in those apartments.
[02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:45.790]  But the civilian toll is going to be high when you do that type of destruction.
[02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:48.790]  What's the motive then of letting this attack happen?
[02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:51.790]  Well, it's not going to be to remove Hamas.
[02:11:51.790 --> 02:11:54.790]  They've had multiple opportunities to do that in the past.
[02:11:54.790 --> 02:11:58.790]  They will claim to kill a few Hamas leaders, as they have.
[02:11:58.790 --> 02:12:03.790]  But I think the big possibility is that they finally want this war with Iran.
[02:12:03.790 --> 02:12:09.790]  You know, they've been attacking Iran on a daily basis for almost two years now, in
[02:12:09.790 --> 02:12:12.790]  Syria, in the Iranian bases.
[02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:15.790]  And Iran has not arisen to the provocation.
[02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:20.790]  They have not attacked back at Israel, even though they could have justified some of
[02:12:20.790 --> 02:12:22.790]  those attacks.
[02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:27.790]  This may be the big 9-11 excuse that gives them a chance to go to Iran.
[02:12:27.790 --> 02:12:31.790]  And if they do, this is going to be a major Middle East war that the U.S. is going to
[02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:32.790]  have to get involved in.
[02:12:32.790 --> 02:12:34.790]  It's not going to be Israel alone.
[02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:37.790]  I want to hone in on a lot of those things that you just said.
[02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:38.790]  It's amazing.
[02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:42.790]  I had a bunch of questions written down for you to answer, and I didn't send them to
[02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:46.790]  you, but somehow you managed to just about answer every single one of them.
[02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:48.790]  But, you know, this is my biggest fear.
[02:12:48.790 --> 02:12:54.790]  When I see, and it's all over, it's media, it's politicians saying we must support Israel
[02:12:54.790 --> 02:12:55.790]  at all costs.
[02:12:55.790 --> 02:13:01.790]  Let's say even I'm fully on board that Hamas is the bad guy and Israel is the good guy.
[02:13:01.790 --> 02:13:03.790]  Let's even say that's my worldview.
[02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:08.790]  How can I not pause for a second and think, well, wait a second, what does at all costs
[02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:09.790]  mean?
[02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:14.790]  If the cost is a war with Iran, if the cost is a nuclear war, if the cost is World War
[02:13:15.790 --> 02:13:20.790]  III, if the cost is our sons, our daughters, our grandkids getting drafted into war, if
[02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:23.790]  the cost is an attack on our homeland, is that worth it?
[02:13:23.790 --> 02:13:25.790]  Joel, why aren't people pausing?
[02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:29.790]  And before they're saying at any cost, thinking, well, what actually is that cost?
[02:13:29.790 --> 02:13:35.790]  Well, the United States isn't going to tell you what the cost is, but it would be horrendous
[02:13:35.790 --> 02:13:39.790]  because Iran is a very powerful military force.
[02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:45.790]  The Iron Dome system of Israel isn't very effective against volleys of rockets that
[02:13:45.790 --> 02:13:49.790]  have come in from Hamas and are now coming in from Hezbollah.
[02:13:49.790 --> 02:13:51.790]  It just simply overwhelms.
[02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:56.790]  And the Iron Dome interceptor missiles are 100 times more expensive than the rockets
[02:13:56.790 --> 02:13:58.790]  they're trying to intercept.
[02:13:58.790 --> 02:14:03.790]  They're really designed to stop Iran from throwing in large, heavy missiles, which it
[02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:06.790]  can stop.
[02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:12.790]  But the U.S. has sent in the Ford, the most modern and effective aircraft carrier that
[02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:13.790]  we have.
[02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:15.790]  And one more now is on the way.
[02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:19.790]  Now, these aircraft carriers are not going to intervene with Hamas or do any more bombing.
[02:14:19.790 --> 02:14:24.790]  Israel's got 600 aircraft and they're capable of bombing the hell out of Gaza and
[02:14:24.790 --> 02:14:26.790]  killing a lot of civilians.
[02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:29.790]  But that's really not going to solve the problem.
[02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:36.790]  If Iran gets involved, the Iranians will attack U.S. forces as well as Israel in the
[02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:41.790]  area, including the U.S. forces that shouldn't be in Syria, trying to starve Syria from
[02:14:41.790 --> 02:14:44.790]  the oil that is legitimately there.
[02:14:44.790 --> 02:14:47.790]  They will attack U.S. bases in Iraq.
[02:14:47.790 --> 02:14:51.790]  We're out of Afghanistan and, of course, gave all those weapons to the Taliban, so
[02:14:51.790 --> 02:14:53.790]  there's no targets there.
[02:14:53.790 --> 02:14:57.790]  But this is going to be a very bad war that will get the U.S. involved.
[02:14:57.790 --> 02:15:03.790]  And I don't think it will lead, Owen, to a nuclear war just because a nuclear war
[02:15:03.790 --> 02:15:08.790]  simply does not, is not totally effective unless you can occupy and stop the country
[02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:11.790]  from rebuilding and coming back to get you.
[02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:15.790]  And, you know, Russia can't even occupy Ukraine, let alone Eastern Europe or the
[02:15:15.790 --> 02:15:16.790]  United States.
[02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:21.790]  They have to wait for China to be ready to have a nuclear war because China does have
[02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:26.790]  the conventional military manpower and power to cross the ocean and to occupy,
[02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:30.790]  though it would be difficult with a country with a billion arms in private hands as
[02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:32.790]  the United States has.
[02:15:32.790 --> 02:15:35.790]  Now, Israel, interestingly, had done a lot of disarmament.
[02:15:35.790 --> 02:15:38.790]  They used to allow all of the settlers to have automatic weapons.
[02:15:38.790 --> 02:15:39.790]  All right, Joel, we're up against the break.
[02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:41.790]  I want to pause you right there and pick it up on the other side.
[02:15:41.790 --> 02:15:46.790]  Folks, this is deep, deep geopolitical knowledge and expertise that you're getting

[02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:17.790]  and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:22.790]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[02:19:58.790 --> 02:20:05.790]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:07.130 --> 02:20:33.210]  Alright, so much to dissect here with Joel Skousen, the intelligence failures, who created
[02:20:33.210 --> 02:20:44.609]  Hamas, what it looks like now is the bombing of the Gaza Strip, is the ground troops moving
[02:20:44.609 --> 02:20:47.449]  into Gaza really them fighting Hamas?
[02:20:47.449 --> 02:20:51.689]  But I want to pick it up where you left it off, Joel, and we'll hone in on those other
[02:20:51.689 --> 02:20:52.949]  things.
[02:20:52.949 --> 02:20:57.970]  This notion of, we must support Israel no matter the cost, well what is the cost?
[02:20:57.970 --> 02:21:02.289]  I mean, let me kind of frame it like this, and you can take it where you want.
[02:21:02.289 --> 02:21:10.410]  Do you see a strategic partnership with these developments being formed between Russia, Iran,
[02:21:10.410 --> 02:21:16.369]  and China, and is the United States considering this when they're thinking about their support
[02:21:16.369 --> 02:21:17.849]  of Israel?
[02:21:17.849 --> 02:21:22.490]  Yes, to Russia and Iran, but not China.
[02:21:22.490 --> 02:21:24.929]  China's going to stay out of this completely right now.
[02:21:24.929 --> 02:21:27.650]  They're not ready to engage the West.
[02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:31.170]  But the fact that they're moving two aircraft carriers into the area is not because they're
[02:21:31.170 --> 02:21:33.130]  going to be used against Hamas.
[02:21:33.130 --> 02:21:38.170]  As I say, Israel has plenty of firepower in their fighter bombers in order to take care
[02:21:38.170 --> 02:21:43.650]  of whatever bombing, the U.S. certainly isn't going to put troops on the ground to fight
[02:21:43.650 --> 02:21:45.210]  Hamas.
[02:21:45.210 --> 02:21:48.810]  They are preparing strategically for a war with Iran.
[02:21:48.810 --> 02:21:52.650]  Now that is going to have very strong strategic consequences for the West.
[02:21:52.650 --> 02:21:58.849]  For example, it's going to guarantee that you're not going to be able to continue sending
[02:21:58.849 --> 02:22:02.369]  arms and military equipment to Ukraine.
[02:22:02.369 --> 02:22:04.250]  And that's one of Putin's goals.
[02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:11.890]  There was an article that just came out yesterday from Business Insider talking about Putin's
[02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:18.810]  general plan, even though because he can't win the war as long as there are Western equipment
[02:22:18.810 --> 02:22:22.810]  going in and arming Ukraine, he's got to stop the West from doing that.
[02:22:22.810 --> 02:22:29.369]  So he's had a large and massive propaganda campaign aimed at Republicans and conservatives
[02:22:29.369 --> 02:22:31.009]  to get them to cut off aid.
[02:22:31.009 --> 02:22:36.210]  Now, I am not in favor of monetary aid to Ukraine because of the corruption left over
[02:22:36.210 --> 02:22:41.089]  from Ukraine during the phony fall of the Soviet Union, where they left all the communists
[02:22:41.089 --> 02:22:45.650]  in power in Ukraine, and that corruption is still ongoing.
[02:22:45.650 --> 02:22:52.689]  But Putin has been very successful at putting out the propaganda or the image that he's
[02:22:52.689 --> 02:22:58.089]  against transgender and homosexuals and woke and he's a Christian and all kinds of other
[02:22:58.089 --> 02:23:02.449]  falsehoods that really impress Christians to think, yeah, he's really helping us overcome
[02:23:02.449 --> 02:23:05.170]  our own globalist government, which isn't true.
[02:23:05.170 --> 02:23:09.170]  Well, it's true in the sense that they're trying to overcome Western globalism so they
[02:23:09.170 --> 02:23:14.289]  can establish their own globalist new world order, which will be very, very tyrannical
[02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:17.289]  and ruthless, Russia and China.
[02:23:17.769 --> 02:23:19.650]  But Iran is an ally in that.
[02:23:19.650 --> 02:23:24.570]  And if Russia can get Israel to attack, Iran won't start this war.
[02:23:24.570 --> 02:23:30.210]  Iran won't attack Israel directly, but they're waiting for Israel to do their plan.
[02:23:30.210 --> 02:23:32.609]  And they've been planning for a long time to attack Iran.
[02:23:32.609 --> 02:23:37.009]  And when they do, it's going to be a massive Middle East war and it's going to get all
[02:23:37.009 --> 02:23:38.289]  aid cut off to Ukraine.
[02:23:38.289 --> 02:23:44.250]  And so Russia will be at least able to secure the Crimea and the Donbass on a permanent
[02:23:44.250 --> 02:23:53.050]  basis. Well, you know, I don't want to wade into this topic lightly because it's obviously
[02:23:53.050 --> 02:23:54.130]  a very sensitive issue.
[02:23:54.130 --> 02:24:00.970]  But, you know, we're told that somehow American blood and treasure has to be sacrificed or
[02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:02.810]  has to be put on the table for this.
[02:24:03.250 --> 02:24:06.529]  And I suppose if you're Israel, then you need that.
[02:24:06.769 --> 02:24:08.929]  But when I hear this coming from U.S.
[02:24:08.929 --> 02:24:12.650]  politicians specifically that we need Israel, Israel doesn't need us.
[02:24:13.410 --> 02:24:19.170]  I can't help but take that with an extreme sour taste in my mouth and just say, no, the
[02:24:19.170 --> 02:24:20.650]  exact opposite is true to me.
[02:24:22.009 --> 02:24:23.130]  Yeah, you're right, Owen.
[02:24:23.970 --> 02:24:27.210]  Israel, you've got to remember there's two aspects to Israel.
[02:24:28.009 --> 02:24:30.210]  Israel does have a right to exist.
[02:24:30.609 --> 02:24:35.769]  The Israeli people are just as blindsided by their own globalist government as we are
[02:24:35.769 --> 02:24:42.929]  with ours. The Israeli deep state or the Mossad and the actual higher levels of
[02:24:42.929 --> 02:24:52.210]  government are very deeply involved in the globalist world affair or WF forum like the
[02:24:52.210 --> 02:24:53.210]  United States is.
[02:24:53.650 --> 02:24:56.449]  They've been propagandizing and there's people about climate change.
[02:24:56.490 --> 02:24:58.490]  They've been doing surveillance on their people.
[02:24:58.490 --> 02:25:03.089]  They've been doing gun control on their people, just like the WF and the globalists are
[02:25:03.089 --> 02:25:06.730]  trying to get mandated vaccines on the Israelis as well.
[02:25:07.570 --> 02:25:09.130]  Terrible mandated vaccine.
[02:25:09.130 --> 02:25:15.410]  So you see, I have sympathy for the Israeli people and the right to live, you know,
[02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:19.810]  peacefully. And they've tried to coexist with the Arabs to a great extent.
[02:25:20.130 --> 02:25:24.810]  But the Arabs, for example, in Gaza, propagate in the education system hatred towards
[02:25:24.810 --> 02:25:28.810]  Israel to an extent that you wouldn't believe.
[02:25:28.849 --> 02:25:30.250]  It's just incredible.
[02:25:30.289 --> 02:25:39.529]  When I've been in Israel many times, there is an Arab feverish mentality of hatred and of
[02:25:39.529 --> 02:25:40.730]  torture and other things.
[02:25:41.170 --> 02:25:45.250]  I mean, for example, the Israelis, yes, their soldiers have done some war crimes.
[02:25:45.289 --> 02:25:47.170]  American soldiers have done war crimes.
[02:25:47.170 --> 02:25:51.089]  Every army has its bad apples in there.
[02:25:51.250 --> 02:25:54.490]  But the Arabs are particularly pernicious in this.
[02:25:54.929 --> 02:25:59.730]  When I was there in Israel in the 1990s, there was a case where an Israeli soldier was
[02:25:59.730 --> 02:26:02.170]  captured and he was literally skinned alive in public.
[02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:07.009]  And the Arabs, you know, were just running around clapping their hands at him.
[02:26:07.130 --> 02:26:12.050]  I saw Arab children torturing a cat one day and just gleefully thinking, you know, that
[02:26:12.650 --> 02:26:15.410]  that's something that doesn't happen in Western societies.
[02:26:15.410 --> 02:26:21.250]  And it's not to say that, you know, the Jews are any paragons of morality.
[02:26:21.250 --> 02:26:23.490]  It's like a typical Middle Eastern city.
[02:26:23.490 --> 02:26:26.410]  People honking horns and yelling and screaming at each other.
[02:26:26.929 --> 02:26:32.730]  There's no spiritual feeling at all in Israel, you know, from a religious point of view.
[02:26:34.289 --> 02:26:37.929]  But the globalists are going to take advantage of this in a certain way.
[02:26:37.929 --> 02:26:39.730]  And it's not going to be good for Americans.
[02:26:39.730 --> 02:26:42.970]  I don't think American blood is going to be shed in Israel, period.
[02:26:42.970 --> 02:26:46.849]  Israel does have the most powerful military in the Middle East and can handle that.
[02:26:47.330 --> 02:26:49.570]  It's a different story if Iran gets involved.
[02:26:49.570 --> 02:26:51.490]  Israel cannot handle Iran alone.
[02:26:51.490 --> 02:26:54.089]  And the U.S. will get involved and American blood will be shed.
[02:26:54.490 --> 02:26:56.689]  And it's it's not worth the price.
[02:26:57.810 --> 02:27:02.730]  Yeah, I think it's a hard thing for Americans to I mean, I guess the best analogy that I
[02:27:02.730 --> 02:27:08.929]  would make and maybe it's not maybe it's not fully appropriate here, but kind of the
[02:27:08.929 --> 02:27:15.130]  anti-white hatred that we see sprinkled into our education system and our doctrine now.
[02:27:15.330 --> 02:27:20.890]  I mean, the hatred for Jews that is in in the doctrine in many of these these
[02:27:20.890 --> 02:27:26.449]  Palestinians or even Muslim upbringings, I think is is not fully understood.
[02:27:26.449 --> 02:27:28.449]  And there is that deep lying hatred.
[02:27:28.650 --> 02:27:31.289]  So I would I would go into it like this.
[02:27:32.250 --> 02:27:37.130]  Is there any way and I mean, I guess this has been the ultimate question for more than
[02:27:37.130 --> 02:27:41.050]  100 years, is there any way they can solve this conflict on their own, Joel?
[02:27:42.689 --> 02:27:48.089]  No, it will never be solved, I mean, biblically or politically or any way you look at
[02:27:48.089 --> 02:27:50.890]  it. The Arabs are never going to get along with the Jews, period.
[02:27:51.449 --> 02:27:56.210]  And so it has to be a very strong defensive relationship and a separate relationship.
[02:27:57.570 --> 02:28:01.130]  And Israeli strength is important in that regard.
[02:28:02.130 --> 02:28:07.089]  I mean, for example, in the right of return, the Jews cannot allow the Arabs the right of
[02:28:07.089 --> 02:28:10.890]  return to come back into Israel or they would be the dominant political force.
[02:28:10.890 --> 02:28:15.689]  And then politically you would get annihilated and you would have no rights whatsoever.
[02:28:15.769 --> 02:28:21.490]  So they do have to, you know, keep the Jewish majority in order to maintain, you know, in
[02:28:21.490 --> 02:28:26.929]  a raw democracy, unfortunately, with a bad constitution, you can't allow raw democracy
[02:28:26.929 --> 02:28:29.890]  to create democratic tyranny.
[02:28:29.970 --> 02:28:33.929]  And that's what happens when and even happening in the United States, when if the
[02:28:33.929 --> 02:28:38.250]  Democrats fully get in power with the president, the Congress, it's they'll just vote
[02:28:38.250 --> 02:28:40.210]  away your rights. And that's not right.
[02:28:40.449 --> 02:28:41.769]  And we're going to have Joel.
[02:28:41.769 --> 02:28:42.689]  I'm sorry. Hold that thought.
[02:28:42.689 --> 02:28:43.689]  We're up against the break.
[02:28:44.330 --> 02:28:49.130]  We'll pick that back up where we left it and then also get a little more detailed about
[02:28:49.130 --> 02:28:54.130]  what's going on in the Gaza Strip today and and what it really represents.
[02:28:54.130 --> 02:28:54.730]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:59.849 --> 02:29:03.970]  Last year, we put this book out, The Great Reset in the War for the World, it became a
[02:29:03.970 --> 02:29:05.449]  number one national bestseller.
[02:29:05.890 --> 02:29:09.250]  Now we've put part two out and it's even thicker and more powerful.
[02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:13.849]  The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great
[02:29:13.929 --> 02:29:16.650]  renaissance. This is such a powerful book.
[02:29:16.890 --> 02:29:21.849]  It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them, and then
[02:29:21.849 --> 02:29:25.689]  gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together.
[02:29:25.849 --> 02:29:27.250]  That's why it's The Great Awakening.
[02:29:27.449 --> 02:29:29.689]  The Great Awakening is happening right now.

[02:31:58.369 --> 02:32:01.689]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:32:01.970 --> 02:32:06.449]  I don't think anybody can deny it and it is because of listeners and viewers
[02:32:06.449 --> 02:32:07.250]  supporting us.
[02:32:07.890 --> 02:32:11.330]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers,
[02:32:11.330 --> 02:32:17.689]  the writers, they really have been the MVPs in this fight and we look at Harrison
[02:32:17.689 --> 02:32:22.210]  Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven
[02:32:22.210 --> 02:32:22.849]  days a week.
[02:32:23.650 --> 02:32:24.730]  It's really just incredible.
[02:32:25.609 --> 02:32:28.609]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:32:29.250 --> 02:32:33.810]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not
[02:32:33.810 --> 02:32:34.369]  support us.
[02:32:35.050 --> 02:32:36.009]  I know you spread the word.
[02:32:36.009 --> 02:32:36.890]  I know you pray for us.
[02:32:36.929 --> 02:32:37.490]  That's wonderful.
[02:32:37.490 --> 02:32:38.050]  Keep doing it.
[02:32:38.050 --> 02:32:43.130]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great
[02:32:43.130 --> 02:32:46.449]  products that enrich and empower your life all at the same time keeping us on air.
[02:32:47.009 --> 02:32:50.689]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:32:51.289 --> 02:32:55.250]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding
[02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:56.009]  problems will be over.
[02:32:56.250 --> 02:32:57.130]  Please take action now.
[02:32:58.609 --> 02:33:05.250]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.780 --> 02:33:15.780]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:15.780 --> 02:33:18.780]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:18.780 --> 02:33:23.780]  And my guest, Joel Skousen. We're getting deep geopolitical knowledge here you're not hearing anywhere else.
[02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:31.780]  And Joel, I want to just ask you this, let's pick it back up, but as we're watching today,
[02:33:31.780 --> 02:33:40.780]  the bombing of the Gaza Strip, and Israeli forces saying they're about to do, I guess, their ground operations next.
[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:46.780]  Now, I've made a conscious decision that I'm just not going to be showing a lot of these videos.
[02:33:46.780 --> 02:33:50.780]  I mean, we'll show the ones that are pretty much 99.9% we know are real.
[02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:53.780]  That's the bombing, the buildings, and everything going off.
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:56.780]  Other than that, I'm just hesitant to show anything, because I don't want to be showing anything.
[02:33:56.780 --> 02:33:59.780]  Whether it's what they're saying is going on in Israel that Hamas did,
[02:33:59.780 --> 02:34:03.780]  or videos that I see now coming out of Gaza, where again, it's the same thing.
[02:34:03.780 --> 02:34:06.780]  Whether it's children dying in Gaza, or children dying in Israel,
[02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:10.780]  I don't want any of that going on, but it's odd how we only see one side.
[02:34:10.780 --> 02:34:12.780]  But it is happening on both sides.
[02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:15.780]  And with all the other stuff going on, like these Instagram models,
[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:17.780]  oh, they get kidnapped, they get raped, now they're dead.
[02:34:17.780 --> 02:34:18.780]  Wait, no, now they're back alive.
[02:34:18.780 --> 02:34:19.780]  Oh, now we need to go home.
[02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:20.780]  Wait, no, now they're dead.
[02:34:20.780 --> 02:34:22.780]  Wait, no, now they're back alive.
[02:34:23.780 --> 02:34:24.780]  Oh, they get kidnapped, they get raped, now they're dead.
[02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:25.780]  Wait, no, now they're back alive.
[02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:27.780]  Oh, now we need to go find her in Gaza.
[02:34:27.780 --> 02:34:30.780]  It's like this reality show for the U.S. consumer,
[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:34.780]  and then what's actually going on on the ground, I don't even know if we fully understand.
[02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:39.780]  So what do you see as the real story here that's actually going on on the ground
[02:34:39.780 --> 02:34:43.780]  when it comes to their bombing the Gaza Strip?
[02:34:43.780 --> 02:34:45.780]  Is this to take out Hamas?
[02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:47.780]  Is that really the end goal here?
[02:34:47.780 --> 02:34:49.780]  Is that even how it can be done?
[02:34:49.780 --> 02:34:52.780]  And then what happens if Israeli forces move in on the ground?
[02:34:52.780 --> 02:34:55.780]  What does what we're seeing in the Gaza Strip today actually represent?
[02:34:55.780 --> 02:34:58.780]  What does it actually mean to you, Joel Skousen?
[02:35:00.780 --> 02:35:04.780]  Well, Hamas really has to be eliminated, but it won't be eliminated.
[02:35:04.780 --> 02:35:08.780]  I mean, Israel has made these kinds of incursions into the Gaza Strip before.
[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:10.780]  They have bombed apartment buildings.
[02:35:10.780 --> 02:35:12.780]  They have bombed headquarters.
[02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:15.780]  Now, none of the Hamas leaders that I know of, you know,
[02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:18.780]  are going to be in those headquarters when they're targeted.
[02:35:19.780 --> 02:35:22.780]  So you have to go in and root them out specifically,
[02:35:22.780 --> 02:35:24.780]  but that's going to cost a lot of casualties.
[02:35:24.780 --> 02:35:28.780]  You're going to lose over 1,000 troops, Israeli troops,
[02:35:28.780 --> 02:35:31.780]  if you go in house to house and try to root out Hamas.
[02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:35.780]  Remember, this is a fairly large area, a large city
[02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:38.780]  with a large amount of concrete buildings.
[02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:41.780]  It's just a death trap to go in and try to root out.
[02:35:42.780 --> 02:35:46.780]  So if it follows the historical pattern, they'll go in with ground troops
[02:35:46.780 --> 02:35:48.780]  and do some, take a lot of casualties.
[02:35:48.780 --> 02:35:50.780]  It'll get very unpopular.
[02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:52.780]  The people will want a ceasefire.
[02:35:52.780 --> 02:35:55.780]  They'll want to call it off, and that's exactly what has happened
[02:35:55.780 --> 02:35:57.780]  three times before when they've gone into Gaza.
[02:35:57.780 --> 02:35:59.780]  They call it off with a ceasefire.
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:01.780]  Then it goes back to the status quo.
[02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:05.780]  The international monetary people, including the United States,
[02:36:05.780 --> 02:36:10.780]  continue to give millions of dollars each year to the Gaza Strip.
[02:36:10.780 --> 02:36:13.780]  You know, they're completely dependent on Israel for electricity,
[02:36:13.780 --> 02:36:15.780]  for gas, and for water supply.
[02:36:16.780 --> 02:36:19.780]  Those are cut off now, starving the population.
[02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:22.780]  This is just an impossible situation to do,
[02:36:22.780 --> 02:36:26.780]  and so I don't think that this is the real reason
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:29.780]  that they have let this war start.
[02:36:29.780 --> 02:36:34.780]  I think the real reason is to induce Iran and Israel to go to war again
[02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:37.780]  or give Israel a justification for doing it.
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:42.780]  And this will increase as Hezbollah continues to fight Israel.
[02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:44.780]  That's the second front that started today,
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:48.780]  and Israel is fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon and hitting targets,
[02:36:48.780 --> 02:36:51.780]  and rockets are flying between Hezbollah and Tel Aviv.
[02:36:51.780 --> 02:36:54.780]  The death toll is now over 1,000.
[02:36:54.780 --> 02:36:56.780]  It's going to get much worse,
[02:36:56.780 --> 02:36:59.780]  and this is going to justify a widening of the war.
[02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:05.780]  So I really don't think that Gaza is ever going to be, you know, solved.
[02:37:05.780 --> 02:37:09.780]  Israel just doesn't have the manpower or the will to take the kinds of casualties
[02:37:09.780 --> 02:37:11.780]  that are going to go out to clean out Hamas.
[02:37:11.780 --> 02:37:15.780]  So this is going to become a wider war probably
[02:37:15.780 --> 02:37:20.780]  rather than more of the Gaza Intifada that has gone on before.
[02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:23.780]  You know, it's crazy to hear this
[02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:27.780]  because obviously there's all the different propaganda,
[02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:31.780]  there's all the different emotional manipulation and deception.
[02:37:31.780 --> 02:37:36.780]  There's what could have potentially been a conscious decision
[02:37:36.780 --> 02:37:39.780]  for this intelligence failure or to let this happen,
[02:37:39.780 --> 02:37:42.780]  and I guess the immature, naive side of me says,
[02:37:42.780 --> 02:37:46.780]  well, you know, maybe just Israel wants the Gaza Strip to be annexed
[02:37:46.780 --> 02:37:49.780]  so that they can have a new tourist location and beachfront property
[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:51.780]  and all this other stuff.
[02:37:51.780 --> 02:37:56.780]  But to think that these psychotics would be drawing this to a larger war with Iran,
[02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:59.780]  I mean, it just blows my mind.
[02:37:59.780 --> 02:38:03.780]  I mean, that is the most psychotic thing that I can imagine.
[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:06.780]  And then people would say, support it at any cost.
[02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:09.780]  Have you even measured the costs?
[02:38:09.780 --> 02:38:13.780]  Yeah, but remember, Owen, that it's the globalists that want to take down Iran.
[02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:17.780]  And why? Because Iran is the only Muslim country
[02:38:17.780 --> 02:38:21.780]  that is independent of both East and West in arms production.
[02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:25.780]  They're building drones that are heavily involved in the Ukraine war.
[02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:27.780]  They're building fighter jets.
[02:38:27.780 --> 02:38:29.780]  They've got F-4 Phantoms.
[02:38:29.780 --> 02:38:31.780]  They've got F-14 Tomcats,
[02:38:31.780 --> 02:38:35.780]  which they are learning how to keep and maintain on their own.
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:37.780]  They're building a tremendous arsenal.
[02:38:37.780 --> 02:38:41.780]  And the globalists can't tolerate another country,
[02:38:41.780 --> 02:38:45.780]  especially a Muslim country, that isn't controlled either by East or West.
[02:38:45.780 --> 02:38:49.780]  And so Israel, being a puppet state of the globalists,
[02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:53.780]  will go after Iran, and this is inevitable at some point.
[02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:58.780]  Now, it's going to really cause havoc if China takes advantage of this
[02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:00.780]  by attacking Taiwan at the same time.
[02:39:00.780 --> 02:39:03.780]  We'll have a three-front war in Ukraine
[02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:07.780]  as well as in Israel and Iran and then in Taiwan and the U.S.
[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:12.780]  You talk about military munitions shortages going on right now
[02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:15.780]  because of going on to Ukraine.
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:17.780]  It's going to be exacerbated tremendously
[02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:21.780]  and draw down our supplies to a very dangerous level.
[02:39:21.780 --> 02:39:27.780]  Almost a level of zero, kind of like our strategic oil reserves as well.
[02:39:27.780 --> 02:39:31.780]  So shifting back to the Gaza Strip, how long do you see this going on?
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:35.780]  I mean, how many buildings are going to be flattened by the Israeli bombings?
[02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:38.780]  How many Palestinians are going to die?
[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:42.780]  I mean, how long is the ground forces moving in?
[02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:46.780]  How long do you see this lasting?
[02:39:46.780 --> 02:39:50.780]  Well, if they decide to go in and clean out Hamas,
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:53.780]  it would probably take a year, and that's not going to happen.
[02:39:53.780 --> 02:39:57.780]  The Israelis, remember, they've got 300,000 reservists called up.
[02:39:58.780 --> 02:40:02.780]  That just kills the Israeli economy.
[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:07.780]  You just can't take that many people out of the economy and make things work.
[02:40:07.780 --> 02:40:11.780]  You know, Israel is telling the Gaza residents to flee.
[02:40:11.780 --> 02:40:14.780]  Well, where do they flee to? There's no place to go.
[02:40:14.780 --> 02:40:16.780]  They can't get out. It's a walled city.
[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:21.780]  There's no nation that's going to take any more Arabs and put them in refugee camps.
[02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.780]  So I don't believe, frankly, that this is going to go on longer than a month
[02:40:25.780 --> 02:40:29.780]  before either a ceasefire is called or a larger war with Iran starts,
[02:40:29.780 --> 02:40:35.780]  and then we'll forget about Gaza, and Israel will have to concentrate on Iran.
[02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:41.780]  Yeah, and again, folks, you can pick any area you want,
[02:40:41.780 --> 02:40:46.780]  whether it's Israel or Gaza, and show the devastation of this war,
[02:40:46.780 --> 02:40:49.780]  and it should be heartbreaking on all sides.
[02:40:49.780 --> 02:40:53.780]  Now, you mentioned this earlier, the shutting off of the utilities and the resources.
[02:40:53.780 --> 02:41:00.780]  This isn't something that the Gaza Strip is necessarily a stranger to.
[02:41:00.780 --> 02:41:01.780]  Well, that's right.
[02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:06.780]  They've used that effectively before when there have been terrorist attacks
[02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:10.780]  to make the people suffer, but really that's quite unfair.
[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:15.780]  You know, those people are as hostage to Hamas as other people.
[02:41:15.780 --> 02:41:20.780]  There's only probably about 20% of the people that are diehard supporters of Hamas in there.
[02:41:20.780 --> 02:41:26.780]  There are moderates which support the PLO, which has taken a backseat to Hamas.
[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:32.780]  But I really think that you have to somehow get those people to eradicate Hamas,
[02:41:32.780 --> 02:41:34.780]  and they don't have any weapons, so they can't do it.
[02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:38.780]  How do you rise up against Hamas and kick them out of your little city-state
[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:40.780]  if you don't have any weapons?
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:44.780]  So I just don't see any resolution to this other than continued warfare,
[02:41:44.780 --> 02:41:46.780]  and that's what people have to get used to.
[02:41:46.780 --> 02:41:48.780]  Forget about peace.
[02:41:48.780 --> 02:41:51.780]  I don't think we're ever going to see peace again on the earth.
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:54.780]  I think we're going to see constant warfare from now on.
[02:41:54.780 --> 02:41:56.780]  That's very sad.
[02:41:56.780 --> 02:41:58.780]  Oh, my gosh.
[02:41:58.780 --> 02:41:59.780]  Devastating.
[02:41:59.780 --> 02:42:02.780]  And it's really a shame that we don't have more world leaders that want peace.
[02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:05.780]  It seems like they want war for whatever reasons.
[02:42:05.780 --> 02:42:10.780]  Their bloodlust, their greed, maybe they're blackmailed.
[02:42:10.780 --> 02:42:14.780]  It's just amazing to think that this could be the case.
[02:42:14.780 --> 02:42:17.780]  But, Joel, let me ask you this.
[02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:21.780]  I played some speeches from Ron Paul in the early 2000s,
[02:42:21.780 --> 02:42:24.780]  and his son Rand is now basically echoing the same sentiment,
[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:26.780]  saying, hey, let's keep our hands off of this.
[02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:28.780]  Let's not be involved at all.
[02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:34.780]  But it was Ron Paul in the early 2000s warning that eventually the U.S. money,
[02:42:34.780 --> 02:42:36.780]  the taxpayer dollars, and the weapons going into that region
[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:40.780]  were going to support terror regimes and were going to be used by groups like Hamas.
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:43.780]  I think that he's been proven accurate,
[02:42:43.780 --> 02:42:47.780]  and there's an image going around right now that shows the rockets going into Israel
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:49.780]  and then the Iron Dome rockets going to intercept them,
[02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:52.780]  both paid for by the U.S. taxpayers.
[02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:54.780]  I'd like to get your response on that.
[02:42:54.780 --> 02:42:57.780]  Do you think that's a fair analysis, that it's the U.S. taxpayers
[02:42:57.780 --> 02:43:01.780]  funding both sides of this war once again?
[02:43:01.780 --> 02:43:04.780]  No, no, I don't at all.
[02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:08.780]  It's Iran dollars that are mostly paying for the explosives
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:12.780]  and the infiltration of equipment to build those rockets.
[02:43:12.780 --> 02:43:16.780]  Those are indigenous rockets being built in by Hezbollah in Lebanon.
[02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:21.780]  There's only the stupidity of American tax dollars going into the international funds
[02:43:21.780 --> 02:43:26.780]  which give millions of dollars to Gaza as humanitarian aid,
[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:31.780]  and some of that is being used for other purposes.
[02:43:31.780 --> 02:43:33.780]  Some of that's getting to Hamas.
[02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:37.780]  But it would be, I think, a great disservice to say our tax money is actually building those rockets.
[02:43:37.780 --> 02:43:40.780]  It's mostly Iranian money.
[02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:46.780]  What do you think about the notion of the timing where Biden gives Iran $6 billion for hostages
[02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:50.780]  and then this attack gets launched a month later?
[02:43:50.780 --> 02:43:54.780]  Well, this hostage thing is something that the West has never been very good about.
[02:43:54.780 --> 02:43:57.780]  For example, Israel always gives in.
[02:43:57.780 --> 02:44:03.780]  You get one soldier captured and they'll give up 100 terrorists for one soldier.
[02:44:03.780 --> 02:44:08.780]  And so that's one of the reasons why they didn't have a rapid response to this.
[02:44:08.780 --> 02:44:13.780]  They wanted to allow Hamas to have hundreds of captives and hostages.
[02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:15.780]  And their plight is real.
[02:44:15.780 --> 02:44:22.780]  You see, that was what was holding up the negotiations between Saudi Arabia recognizing Israel was hostage release.
[02:44:22.780 --> 02:44:28.780]  Are you going to let all the Hamas and Palestinian terrorists go as part of this peace deal?
[02:44:28.780 --> 02:44:30.780]  And they wouldn't, but now they have to.
[02:44:30.780 --> 02:44:36.780]  Now you've got enough hostages that you're going to be able to trade for these terrorists,
[02:44:36.780 --> 02:44:37.780]  and that's a very bad thing.
[02:44:37.780 --> 02:44:42.780]  Now, I personally don't think that Biden ought to have given, you know, it's Iran's money,
[02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:47.780]  but given or released $6 billion for a few hostages.
[02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:49.780]  But we're suckers for hostages.
[02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:54.780]  And, you know, the policy should be we never give in to hostages, period.
[02:44:54.780 --> 02:44:57.780]  I don't care how much you're suffering as you just never give in.
[02:44:57.780 --> 02:44:58.780]  You never pay them.
[02:44:58.780 --> 02:45:01.780]  That's something if you get kidnapped, you never pay a ransom.
[02:45:01.780 --> 02:45:05.780]  That's just an iron law of never giving in and paying a ransom.
[02:45:05.780 --> 02:45:08.780]  And the West is doing it now, and they're going to pay the price.
[02:45:08.780 --> 02:45:09.780]  But they let this happen.
[02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:10.780]  They let those hostages.
[02:45:10.780 --> 02:45:18.780]  I mean, if they had a rapid reaction team, those hostages would have never gotten back the 10 miles back into Gaza again.
[02:45:18.780 --> 02:45:19.780]  They never would have made it back.
[02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:23.780]  They would have been closed off from taking those hostages.
[02:45:23.780 --> 02:45:29.780]  Yeah, you know, this is an interesting one for me, too, because my heart my heart kind of says,
[02:45:29.780 --> 02:45:32.780]  and look, I'm about to be a prisoner of the Biden regime.
[02:45:32.780 --> 02:45:39.780]  And so my heart kind of says, I mean, let's do whatever we can to release people from in a hostage situation or a prisoner situation.
[02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:46.780]  However, when you're talking about these negotiation strategies, obviously, when you start paying for hostages,
[02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:49.780]  you create a scenario where hostages are going to become a prime.
[02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:51.780]  They're going to become a necessity.
[02:45:51.780 --> 02:45:53.780]  So how much of that goes into this?
[02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:55.780]  They see, oh, they're going to pay billions of dollars for hostage.
[02:45:55.780 --> 02:45:58.780]  Let's take as many hostages as we can.
[02:45:58.780 --> 02:45:59.780]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:45:59.780 --> 02:46:00.780]  That's what's happening.
[02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:01.780]  It's a bad policy.
[02:46:01.780 --> 02:46:02.780]  It's a bad policy.
[02:46:02.780 --> 02:46:05.780]  And Israel's a sucker for that, especially Israel.
[02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:10.780]  They have just done terrible hostage release things and things.
[02:46:10.780 --> 02:46:17.780]  Let me just say before we get to the end, you know, I let your listeners know that I publish the World Affairs Brief every Friday
[02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:21.780]  where I discuss and give this kind of geopolitical intelligence.
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:25.780]  And if any of your listeners want to get a free sample copy, they can go to the Web site.
[02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:29.780]  And as you'll see on the picture on the left hand side, it says request a sample.
[02:46:29.780 --> 02:46:34.780]  Now, if you want to, it's a one-time sample for those looking to subscribe.
[02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:40.780]  If you want to get the Friday brief, which is going to be all of the intel about this Israeli-Arab war
[02:46:40.780 --> 02:46:45.780]  and the Iran elements of that, request your sample on Friday afternoon.
[02:46:45.780 --> 02:46:49.780]  Otherwise, you'll get this week's sample, which is about the speakership
[02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:53.780]  and the other machinations going on within our government.
[02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:55.780]  All right, that's Joel Skousen.
[02:46:55.780 --> 02:46:58.780]  You just heard him, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:46:58.780 --> 02:47:05.780]  And I'll tell you what, on that note, Joel, let's change course and let's talk about one of your other expertise issues,
[02:47:05.780 --> 02:47:10.780]  and that's strategic relocation, preparing for an emergency.
[02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:16.780]  I mean, I could sit here and list a dozen reasons why it'd be time to think about that and consider that.
[02:47:16.780 --> 02:47:18.780]  You've been considering it for decades.
[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:20.780]  Let's talk about this.
[02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:24.780]  What can the American do right now that maybe hasn't followed your work before,
[02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:27.780]  hasn't read your books before, but is starting to have a sense of urgency,
[02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:30.780]  starting to realize the sense of things around here,
[02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:33.780]  and maybe is thinking about emergency preparedness or relocation?
[02:47:33.780 --> 02:47:36.780]  Joel, where is a good place to begin?
[02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:41.780]  What are things that people might not be thinking about that they need to be when considering this stuff?
[02:47:41.780 --> 02:47:48.780]  Well, the major weakness of people who are preparing is they don't really understand the threats.
[02:47:49.780 --> 02:47:56.780]  The threat is important to understand because this Third World War, which is going to be a nuclear war, is inevitable.
[02:47:56.780 --> 02:47:58.780]  We have 100 percent chance.
[02:47:58.780 --> 02:47:59.780]  Why is it inevitable?
[02:47:59.780 --> 02:48:01.780]  Because the globalists want it.
[02:48:01.780 --> 02:48:07.780]  It's the only way that they can drive Americans into a militarized global government is to let an attack fall,
[02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:10.780]  a nuclear preemptive attack fall on our military.
[02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:12.780]  They're not going to strike cities at first.
[02:48:12.780 --> 02:48:15.780]  Russia and China want to blackmail the West into submission.
[02:48:15.780 --> 02:48:16.780]  They don't want to destroy it.
[02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:20.780]  But you have to understand that it's going to begin with an E&P strike,
[02:48:20.780 --> 02:48:23.780]  and that's going to take down the grid for at least a year.
[02:48:23.780 --> 02:48:24.780]  Why a year?
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:28.780]  Because we don't stockpile any of the transformers, the long-distance transformers.
[02:48:28.780 --> 02:48:31.780]  They're as big as a truck, and they're all made in China.
[02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:37.780]  We don't stockpile them in the West, and so the grid isn't coming back anytime soon,
[02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:39.780]  and that means there's going to be pillaging.
[02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:43.780]  So you gave some very wise counsel about preparedness at the beginning of the show.
[02:48:43.780 --> 02:48:46.780]  You talk about getting your food storage, getting your water storage,
[02:48:46.780 --> 02:48:49.780]  and stocking up on natural medicines and other things.
[02:48:49.780 --> 02:48:53.780]  You won't be able to depend on drugs, and you shouldn't depend on medical drugs.
[02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:56.780]  You can't trust the medical establishment anymore after COVID.
[02:48:56.780 --> 02:49:02.780]  But the most important thing that I've emphasized to people, whether you can relocate or not,
[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:07.780]  is that you've got to be able to secure those storage items and weapons or ammunition
[02:49:07.780 --> 02:49:09.780]  or any self-defense things that you have.
[02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:15.780]  You've got to get it into a secure, safe room that is concealed.
[02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:19.780]  If it's not concealed, the pillaging will get to you.
[02:49:19.780 --> 02:49:23.780]  I mean, it's going to start two to three days after there's no electricity,
[02:49:23.780 --> 02:49:25.780]  and people will start to pillage for food.
[02:49:25.780 --> 02:49:27.780]  The stores will be empty.
[02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:29.780]  So it isn't enough to have a year's supply.
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:31.780]  It isn't enough to have six months' supply.
[02:49:31.780 --> 02:49:35.780]  You've got to have it concealed and secured, and that's best done underground.
[02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:39.780]  That's one of the reasons I put out the book about the high-security shelter
[02:49:39.780 --> 02:49:43.780]  or how to implement a high-security shelter in the home was the original publication name,
[02:49:43.780 --> 02:49:46.780]  which you used to sell at InfoWars stores.
[02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:52.780]  But this tells people how to do a concealed high-security shelter within the home
[02:49:52.780 --> 02:49:54.780]  and preferably in a basement.
[02:49:54.780 --> 02:49:59.780]  Now, strategic relocation warns people that you've got to prepare to get out of the cities.
[02:49:59.780 --> 02:50:04.780]  Your major threat in any crisis, especially a war where there's no electricity,
[02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:06.780]  is population density.
[02:50:06.780 --> 02:50:12.780]  If you're in an area of 1,000 people per square mile, as in most of the East Coast cities,
[02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:15.780]  there's just no way you can survive that.
[02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:18.780]  Eventually, they're going to tear down everything trying to get food,
[02:50:18.780 --> 02:50:22.780]  and so you've got to prepare to get out and retreat to rural areas.
[02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:24.780]  But even in rural areas, we have a retreat.
[02:50:24.780 --> 02:50:28.780]  If you expect your supplies to not be pillaged when you get there,
[02:50:28.780 --> 02:50:32.780]  either from hunters or itinerant bad guys in the local area,
[02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:39.780]  you've got to have a concealed safe room and preferably in a basement space that's concealed.
[02:50:39.780 --> 02:50:43.780]  My preferred areas for basement secure storage is under a garage
[02:50:43.780 --> 02:50:46.780]  because nobody expects there to be a basement under a garage.
[02:50:46.780 --> 02:50:47.780]  It's a great way to start.
[02:50:47.780 --> 02:50:52.780]  In my books, the secure home and the high-security shelter give you direct architectural plans
[02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:55.780]  on how to do those types of things.
[02:50:55.780 --> 02:50:59.780]  Now, again, you've written many books on this,
[02:50:59.780 --> 02:51:05.780]  some of them like How to Implement a High-Security Shelter in the Home,
[02:51:05.780 --> 02:51:08.780]  The Secure Home, Architectural Design, Construction, Remodeling,
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:13.780]  and Self-Sufficient Residences and Retreats, and Strategic Relocation,
[02:51:13.780 --> 02:51:15.780]  North American Guide to Safe Places.
[02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:21.780]  I find that book with all the graphics in it to be extremely informational,
[02:51:21.780 --> 02:51:24.780]  especially because I'm somebody that has a photographic memory,
[02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:27.780]  and so if I can see something, it's like I'm a visual learner type thing.
[02:51:27.780 --> 02:51:31.780]  So that's really a good book for people to have as well.
[02:51:31.780 --> 02:51:36.780]  But let's say, as you said, you're in a high-density population area,
[02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:38.780]  and maybe you can't relocate.
[02:51:38.780 --> 02:51:41.780]  What are some things that you can do?
[02:51:41.780 --> 02:51:45.780]  Well, in Strategic Relocation, I talk about these things.
[02:51:45.780 --> 02:51:46.780]  Here are some basic hints.
[02:51:46.780 --> 02:51:49.780]  First of all, if you're in a major metro and you can't relocate,
[02:51:49.780 --> 02:51:53.780]  at least try to relocate to the periphery of the major metro.
[02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:55.780]  You don't want to be in a highly dense area
[02:51:55.780 --> 02:51:58.780]  that you have to get on a freeway to get outside.
[02:51:58.780 --> 02:52:01.780]  And remember that in every major metro,
[02:52:01.780 --> 02:52:05.780]  there are beltways, that is, freeways that circle the city,
[02:52:05.780 --> 02:52:06.780]  and those are like a moat.
[02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:11.780]  You can't get past that without going onto an on-ramp or an exit ramp,
[02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:14.780]  which will be blocked with everyone's trying to leave the city,
[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:15.780]  as happened in Katrina.
[02:52:15.780 --> 02:52:18.780]  Now, if you look carefully on Google Maps
[02:52:18.780 --> 02:52:21.780]  and go around and look at the on-ramps and off-ramps,
[02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:24.780]  there are two to three in every location,
[02:52:24.780 --> 02:52:27.780]  ways to get over that freeway or under the freeway
[02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:30.780]  that do not correspond to an on-ramp.
[02:52:30.780 --> 02:52:32.780]  You can't get on the freeway.
[02:52:32.780 --> 02:52:33.780]  You just can go past it.
[02:52:33.780 --> 02:52:36.780]  Those are your secret ways out of the city.
[02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:40.780]  You've got to find those and route your areas not through major city
[02:52:40.780 --> 02:52:44.780]  but the back roads to be able to get out of the city.
[02:52:44.780 --> 02:52:48.780]  And you've got to, of course, stockpile enough supplies.
[02:52:49.780 --> 02:52:51.780]  If I were making an escape from a city in a car,
[02:52:51.780 --> 02:52:53.780]  I'd also have a bicycle tied to the back of the car
[02:52:53.780 --> 02:52:56.780]  so that if you get blocked in a traffic jam,
[02:52:56.780 --> 02:52:59.780]  take out the bicycle or a small motor scooter or electric bike even
[02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:01.780]  and then get out of town.
[02:53:01.780 --> 02:53:03.780]  I think it's unfortunate we have to talk about this,
[02:53:03.780 --> 02:53:06.780]  but given the state of things in the world and the country right now,
[02:53:06.780 --> 02:53:08.780]  I think it's more important than ever.
[02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:10.780]  What do you think is most likely, though?
[02:53:10.780 --> 02:53:14.780]  Is it going to be an economic collapse, a Great Depression?
[02:53:14.780 --> 02:53:17.780]  You mentioned the EMP, the power grid going down.
[02:53:17.780 --> 02:53:19.780]  Is it going to be some sort of a terror attack?
[02:53:19.780 --> 02:53:21.780]  I mean, what do you think is the biggest threat that we face right now
[02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:23.780]  to our homeland?
[02:53:23.780 --> 02:53:27.780]  Well, first of all, we can always face an economic downturn
[02:53:27.780 --> 02:53:30.780]  because we're living in a bubble constantly,
[02:53:30.780 --> 02:53:32.780]  and it's only being inflated by the Fed to keep it going.
[02:53:32.780 --> 02:53:34.780]  That's why inflation will never stop.
[02:53:34.780 --> 02:53:36.780]  So get used to high inflation.
[02:53:36.780 --> 02:53:37.780]  It's never going to stop.
[02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:41.780]  Now, it can't really turn to hyperinflation in the United States
[02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:47.780]  because in hyperinflation, you have to have the government
[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:51.780]  mandating by law that everybody's salaries increase
[02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:53.780]  according to the rate of inflation.
[02:53:53.780 --> 02:53:55.780]  They don't do that in the United States.
[02:53:55.780 --> 02:54:00.780]  We have a token COLA or cost of living allowance for Social Security,
[02:54:00.780 --> 02:54:04.780]  but that's why the Fed and the Bureau of Economic Statistics
[02:54:04.780 --> 02:54:07.780]  understate inflation by about three times
[02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:10.780]  so that they don't have to pay those inflation taxes
[02:54:10.780 --> 02:54:13.780]  to Social Security recipients.
[02:54:13.780 --> 02:54:17.780]  But it's important to realize that no real economic collapse
[02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:19.780]  comes until war comes.
[02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:21.780]  As long as people can maneuver and survive
[02:54:21.780 --> 02:54:23.780]  and go back to basics and things,
[02:54:23.780 --> 02:54:26.780]  there won't be an economic collapse, just a downturn.
[02:54:26.780 --> 02:54:29.780]  And it could happen again, but so far,
[02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:33.780]  the Fed continues to pump this economy up with inflationary modes.
[02:54:34.780 --> 02:54:38.780]  So I think the only existential threat you have to prepare for
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:40.780]  is this coming war.
[02:54:40.780 --> 02:54:42.780]  And EMP is an existential threat.
[02:54:42.780 --> 02:54:43.780]  A lot of people ask me,
[02:54:43.780 --> 02:54:45.780]  they say, well, why can't they just throw an EMP strike
[02:54:45.780 --> 02:54:48.780]  and not attack us with nuclear weapons?
[02:54:48.780 --> 02:54:51.780]  It's because the U.S. military is hardened against EMP
[02:54:51.780 --> 02:54:54.780]  so they can still respond and attack those countries
[02:54:54.780 --> 02:54:56.780]  that hit us with EMP.
[02:54:56.780 --> 02:54:59.780]  So they have to throw a nuclear strike at military forces
[02:54:59.780 --> 02:55:02.780]  about 15 to 20 minutes after an EMP strike,
[02:55:02.780 --> 02:55:05.780]  and that's the military doctrine of both Russia and China.
[02:55:06.780 --> 02:55:07.780]  All right, folks.
[02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:09.780]  This is the reality of the situation,
[02:55:09.780 --> 02:55:11.780]  and it's like I say with emergency food,
[02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:14.780]  you'd rather have this information and not need it
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:16.780]  than need it and not have it.
[02:55:16.780 --> 02:55:18.780]  Joel Skousen, a great source for that.
[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:19.780]  Joel, thank you for your time today.
[02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:22.780]  Excellent interview, excellent geopolitical expertise,
[02:55:22.780 --> 02:55:25.780]  and again, we just thank you for your time.
[02:55:25.780 --> 02:55:26.780]  Thank you very much.
[02:55:26.780 --> 02:55:27.780]  Good to be with you.
[02:55:27.780 --> 02:55:31.780]  All right, there goes Joel Skousen from World Affairs Brief,
[02:55:31.780 --> 02:55:33.780]  and I'm serious, I'm serious.
[02:55:33.780 --> 02:55:36.780]  You're not going to get that deep geopolitical information
[02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:39.780]  anywhere else but right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:43.780]  So please continue to support us at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:46.780]  Again, we do have the emergency food supplies there,
[02:55:46.780 --> 02:55:48.780]  the highest quality at the lowest price,
[02:55:48.780 --> 02:55:52.780]  also in the highest quality storage containers as well.
[02:55:52.780 --> 02:55:55.780]  I mean, I would say that's a necessity,
[02:55:55.780 --> 02:55:58.780]  and even for people that are already prepared out there,
[02:55:58.780 --> 02:56:00.780]  you see the way of the world,
[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:01.780]  you see the way things are going,
[02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:03.780]  and you might have an instinct to even double down
[02:56:03.780 --> 02:56:05.780]  and get extra prepared.
[02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:08.780]  And so a great source, InfowarsStore.com,
[02:56:08.780 --> 02:56:11.780]  with the emergency preparedness there as well.
[02:56:11.780 --> 02:56:13.780]  Keeping Infowars on the air throughout all of this,
[02:56:13.780 --> 02:56:15.780]  very important as well.
[02:56:15.780 --> 02:56:18.780]  That's why shopping at InfowarsStore.com is imperative

[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:29.780]  we don't get the big Hollywood bucks,
[02:56:29.780 --> 02:56:31.780]  we don't get the big billionaire donor bucks.

[02:57:16.780 --> 02:57:18.780]  Let's just say I got a bit of an inside track.
[02:57:18.780 --> 02:57:21.780]  Let's just say I've got the inside track on that,
[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:25.780]  and my signed copy has been secured.

[02:57:35.780 --> 02:57:39.780]  Maria Z takes over in the fourth hour with great guests.
[02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:40.780]  Big guests coming up with Maria Z,
[02:57:40.780 --> 02:57:43.780]  and then I'm back hosting The War Room in one hour.
[02:57:43.780 --> 02:57:44.780]  We'll see you then.
[02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:51.900]  Where were you when humanity was fighting for its life?
[02:57:51.900 --> 02:57:56.900]  Where were you when the globalists were caught trafficking millions of children for sex slavery worldwide?
[02:57:56.900 --> 02:58:00.900]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?

[02:59:48.900 --> 02:59:55.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:55.900 --> 03:00:09.900]  It has been said that the first casualty of war is the truth.
[03:00:09.900 --> 03:00:19.900]  And one thing is for sure, we have seen so much propaganda coming out of the lying media over the past few days.
[03:00:19.900 --> 03:00:24.900]  First of all, I want to say that in absolutely no way is any of this okay.
[03:00:24.900 --> 03:00:28.900]  Neither is the human suffering that is happening on both sides.
[03:00:28.900 --> 03:00:35.900]  There are horrible acts being committed by both sides, and this is the nature of war.
[03:00:35.900 --> 03:00:43.900]  It would be naive of us to think that in the middle of war, one side is not going to retaliate or defend themselves.
[03:00:43.900 --> 03:00:49.900]  Or whatever the case may be, it is absolutely atrocious to watch this happening.
[03:00:50.900 --> 03:00:59.900]  What I will say is that I've been disgusted at the number of people who I'm witnessing warmongering right now, encouraging this,
[03:00:59.900 --> 03:01:06.900]  saying, you know, siding, picking a side, which is exactly what the orchestrators of war want you to do.
[03:01:06.900 --> 03:01:10.900]  They never want you to call for peace or de-escalation.
[03:01:10.900 --> 03:01:17.900]  They want you to pick a side and behave like a vicious monster because that's what they are.
[03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:18.900]  And we've seen this.
[03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:26.900]  We've seen people tweeting about, you know, I mentioned a Jordan Peterson tweet that disappointed me,
[03:01:26.900 --> 03:01:30.900]  in which he said, get Netanyahu.
[03:01:30.900 --> 03:01:38.900]  I've mentioned the fact that in Sydney, Australia, we've got pro-Palestine supporters chanting, gas the Jews.
[03:01:38.900 --> 03:01:40.900]  Neither is okay.
[03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:49.900]  We should never be encouraging ending human life, especially not when there are so many holes in this story.
[03:01:49.900 --> 03:01:52.900]  Now, we're trying to establish contact with Shimon Yanowitz.
[03:01:52.900 --> 03:01:55.900]  He's been on with me many times in the past.
[03:01:55.900 --> 03:02:00.900]  He's an engineer, and he's actually been in the nanotech war.
[03:02:00.900 --> 03:02:03.900]  He's been fighting very, very hard to get the truth out about this.
[03:02:03.900 --> 03:02:08.900]  He's actually one of the people that contacted me about, if you recall some time ago,
[03:02:08.900 --> 03:02:13.900]  we aired footage of what appears to be fiber optic cables inside of people.
[03:02:13.900 --> 03:02:15.900]  But he's also in Israel.
[03:02:15.900 --> 03:02:21.900]  He's an Israeli living in Israel, and he has some interesting insight to share with us.
[03:02:21.900 --> 03:02:24.900]  But the team will let us know once we're able to get him on.
[03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:31.900]  I just want to say, you know, there are so many bits of footage that have come out of Israel
[03:02:31.900 --> 03:02:38.900]  via the mainstream propaganda machine that simply, I feel, cannot be trusted.
[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:45.900]  For example, the building that we saw that was bombed apparently by the IDF
[03:02:45.900 --> 03:02:49.900]  looked very much like Building 7 as it collapsed.
[03:02:49.900 --> 03:02:52.900]  And if the team have got that footage, it would be good to air it right now.
[03:02:52.900 --> 03:02:55.900]  If not, we can go back to it after the break.
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:03:03.900]  We need to consider that the most heavily guarded area in the world
[03:03:03.900 --> 03:03:08.900]  was suddenly penetrated by some guys on motorbikes and a couple of trucks.
[03:03:08.900 --> 03:03:09.900]  How did they get through?
[03:03:09.900 --> 03:03:16.900]  And the fact that you've got Israel's Iron Dome, which is intercepting missiles midair,
[03:03:16.900 --> 03:03:21.900]  doesn't detect and can't stop a few people on parachutes coming through.
[03:03:21.900 --> 03:03:27.900]  A very interesting detail that has emerged as well is that allegedly the music festival
[03:03:27.900 --> 03:03:33.900]  that was held where the people came through on the parachutes
[03:03:33.900 --> 03:03:39.900]  was moved to a different location only two days before it started.
[03:03:39.900 --> 03:03:43.900]  Apparently another site in southern Israel fell through,
[03:03:43.900 --> 03:03:47.900]  and the new site featured a pair of stages.
[03:03:48.900 --> 03:03:52.900]  So that is a very, very interesting detail.
[03:03:52.900 --> 03:04:00.900]  The other thing that needs to be considered is the lack of response to the alleged invasion.
[03:04:00.900 --> 03:04:05.900]  And so I think the team's airing the footage now of that building.
[03:04:05.900 --> 03:04:08.900]  There is better footage that I'll send through on the other side of this break
[03:04:08.900 --> 03:04:09.900]  that we can review.
[03:04:09.900 --> 03:04:11.900]  All very, very important.
[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:18.900]  The other thing that's really got me up in a stink is the fact that we have
[03:04:18.900 --> 03:04:23.900]  people seemingly forgetting that the Israeli government,
[03:04:23.900 --> 03:04:26.900]  just like every other government in the world,
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:32.900]  waged bio-warfare on their citizens through the COVID injections.
[03:04:32.900 --> 03:04:36.900]  I reported heavily on Israel during the rollout,
[03:04:36.900 --> 03:04:38.900]  talking about the fact that they were, at one stage,
[03:04:38.900 --> 03:04:42.900]  the most highly injected population with the highest deaths
[03:04:42.900 --> 03:04:44.900]  and the highest rates of COVID.
[03:04:44.900 --> 03:04:46.900]  So we're going to get into all of that and more,
[03:04:46.900 --> 03:04:49.900]  hopefully establish contact with Shimon Yanowitz.
[03:04:49.900 --> 03:04:52.900]  And then later on, I've got Lieutenant Colonel Pete Chambers
[03:04:52.900 --> 03:04:54.900]  coming on from a U.S. perspective.
[03:04:54.900 --> 03:04:56.900]  Huge broadcast. Don't go anywhere.
[03:04:57.900 --> 03:05:00.900]  The most powerful in fours life formula yet.

[03:06:02.900 --> 03:06:15.900]  And we are back.
[03:06:15.900 --> 03:06:19.900]  Just trying to establish contact with Shimon Yanowitz live out of Israel.
[03:06:19.900 --> 03:06:23.900]  Very, very good insight from someone who's on the ground.
[03:06:23.900 --> 03:06:28.900]  The overwhelming response that I'm hearing from Israeli people
[03:06:28.900 --> 03:06:34.900]  is that they do not trust what is coming out of their own government.
[03:06:34.900 --> 03:06:37.900]  It is just impossible that there was such a breach
[03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:41.900]  of the advanced defense systems that Israel has.
[03:06:41.900 --> 03:06:44.900]  Of course, we have Owen just mentioned it with his previous guest,
[03:06:44.900 --> 03:06:49.900]  the $6 billion that Biden just sent over to Iran,
[03:06:49.900 --> 03:06:52.900]  allegedly a hostage deal.
[03:06:52.900 --> 03:06:56.900]  And then you have Hamas thanking Iran for those funds.
[03:06:56.900 --> 03:06:58.900]  So are we going to talk about that?
[03:06:58.900 --> 03:07:01.900]  Or are we just going to go with the mainstream media narrative?
[03:07:01.900 --> 03:07:04.900]  It never ceases to amaze me how, you know,
[03:07:04.900 --> 03:07:10.900]  the immediate response of people to just buy what they are told
[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:13.900]  on the mainstream media hook, line and sinker.
[03:07:13.900 --> 03:07:17.900]  And then, of course, they go on to pick a side.
[03:07:17.900 --> 03:07:19.900]  I'm on the side of humanity.
[03:07:19.900 --> 03:07:22.900]  I'm on the side of stopping brutal killing of innocent people
[03:07:22.900 --> 03:07:25.900]  so that we can line the pockets of the warmongers
[03:07:25.900 --> 03:07:27.900]  and the military industrial complex.
[03:07:27.900 --> 03:07:30.900]  When we get Shimon on soon, hopefully,
[03:07:30.900 --> 03:07:33.900]  what he's told me is that as far as he can gather,
[03:07:33.900 --> 03:07:36.900]  the Israeli army has given the invaders from Gaza at least eight,
[03:07:36.900 --> 03:07:38.900]  probably 12 hours of head start,
[03:07:38.900 --> 03:07:44.900]  doing nothing while the Hamas invaders went on uninterrupted shooting spree
[03:07:44.900 --> 03:07:49.900]  in the villages, towns and roads close to the Gaza border.
[03:07:50.900 --> 03:07:54.900]  He's also spoken about the ultra high-tech fence
[03:07:54.900 --> 03:07:59.900]  and other manned and automatic intelligence and alert measures
[03:07:59.900 --> 03:08:02.900]  surrounding Gaza that were either ignored or, worse,
[03:08:02.900 --> 03:08:05.900]  neutralised from within Israel.
[03:08:05.900 --> 03:08:07.900]  However, the most dumb measure of responding,
[03:08:07.900 --> 03:08:10.900]  this is from Shimon directly, to the barrage of rockets launched
[03:08:10.900 --> 03:08:13.900]  from Gaza went down completely unresponded.
[03:08:13.900 --> 03:08:16.900]  And it is, he says, my unproven thus far impression
[03:08:16.900 --> 03:08:20.900]  that there were forces within Israel operating prior to 6 a.m.
[03:08:20.900 --> 03:08:24.900]  invasion time who was tasked with furnishing uninterrupted passage
[03:08:24.900 --> 03:08:28.900]  to the invaders and even providing means of transportation
[03:08:28.900 --> 03:08:31.900]  for them to move quickly in, within and out,
[03:08:31.900 --> 03:08:36.900]  even carrying bodies and hostages back to Gaza in masses.
[03:08:36.900 --> 03:08:40.900]  I think that here's the footage that I sent over to the team.
[03:08:40.900 --> 03:08:41.900]  Here we go.
[03:08:41.900 --> 03:08:42.900]  Here's the Wall Street Journal footage.
[03:08:42.900 --> 03:08:43.900]  Have a look at this.
[03:08:43.900 --> 03:08:45.900]  Does this not look like Building 7?
[03:08:45.900 --> 03:08:49.900]  And we're being told that this is the IDF responding.
[03:08:49.900 --> 03:08:54.900]  Look how swiftly they're taking care of business.
[03:08:54.900 --> 03:08:59.900]  And if anyone understands how buildings collapse when they're bombed
[03:08:59.900 --> 03:09:03.900]  like that or missiles hit them, they do not collapse in a stack
[03:09:03.900 --> 03:09:06.900]  from the bottom like that.
[03:09:06.900 --> 03:09:10.900]  So, I mean, everything should be questioned right now.
[03:09:10.900 --> 03:09:15.900]  And, you know, when you're assessing the new world order,
[03:09:15.900 --> 03:09:17.900]  I think you have to look at the patterns of these people,
[03:09:17.900 --> 03:09:19.900]  the patterns of war propaganda.
[03:09:19.900 --> 03:09:23.900]  And Owen made a really good point in the last segment when he said,
[03:09:23.900 --> 03:09:27.900]  I'm not sharing this footage that's just flooding social media
[03:09:27.900 --> 03:09:29.900]  being accepted as fact right now.
[03:09:29.900 --> 03:09:33.900]  I'm not doing that because none of it's verified.
[03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:37.900]  A lot of the footage that's coming out is largely unverified.
[03:09:37.900 --> 03:09:40.900]  Just think back to the Russia-Ukraine situation.
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:42.900]  We were being told, oh, look what Russians are doing
[03:09:42.900 --> 03:09:46.900]  to Ukrainian soldiers, but actually it was Ukrainian soldiers.
[03:09:46.900 --> 03:09:49.900]  You know, look what the Russians are brutalising the people,
[03:09:49.900 --> 03:09:50.900]  and that was false.
[03:09:50.900 --> 03:09:56.900]  We had footage of Russia allegedly levelling places in Ukraine,
[03:09:56.900 --> 03:09:59.900]  and it was old footage.
[03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:05.900]  You had footage from a video game being shared on the media as fact.
[03:10:05.900 --> 03:10:08.900]  So these things are absolutely crucial to consider.
[03:10:08.900 --> 03:10:10.900]  Now, the team should have one more video.
[03:10:10.900 --> 03:10:14.900]  I want to air that right now from Benjamin Netanyahu.
[03:10:14.900 --> 03:10:16.900]  Team, if you've got it, cue that up right now.
[03:10:16.900 --> 03:10:21.900]  I want to remind people who we're actually battling against here
[03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:27.900]  so that they don't forget that the same people that waged war on us
[03:10:27.900 --> 03:10:32.900]  three years ago with COVID and the bioterrorism that was waged
[03:10:32.900 --> 03:10:36.900]  by the globalists on humanity through the poison shots,
[03:10:36.900 --> 03:10:40.900]  have we forgotten that every government did that to us?
[03:10:40.900 --> 03:10:46.900]  Have we forgotten what they subjected us to and bragged about it?
[03:10:46.900 --> 03:10:50.900]  Team, if you've got that clip, air it for me now, please.
[03:10:50.900 --> 03:10:56.900]  We have five main things that we can drive now, human progress.
[03:10:56.900 --> 03:11:00.900]  Not only wealth and progress for Israel, but human progress.
[03:11:00.900 --> 03:11:03.900]  I'll give you one example so you'll see because I don't want to bore you
[03:11:03.900 --> 03:11:10.900]  with detailed plans, but they are detailed in my mind.
[03:11:10.900 --> 03:11:13.900]  We came out of COVID first.
[03:11:13.900 --> 03:11:16.900]  I describe that in my book, my conversations with Albert Bourla of Pfizer,
[03:11:16.900 --> 03:11:22.900]  and I persuaded him to give tiny Israel the necessary vaccines
[03:11:22.900 --> 03:11:24.900]  to get us out first from the COVID.
[03:11:24.900 --> 03:11:28.900]  And the reason I could do that is because we have a database, 98%,
[03:11:28.900 --> 03:11:34.900]  a medical database, 98% of our population has digitized medical records
[03:11:34.900 --> 03:11:38.900]  and little card and anywhere you go in any hospital in Israel,
[03:11:38.900 --> 03:11:41.900]  north, south, doesn't make any difference, boom, you punch it in
[03:11:41.900 --> 03:11:44.900]  and you know everything about this patient for the last 20 years.
[03:11:44.900 --> 03:11:48.900]  I said we'll use that to tell you whether these vaccines,
[03:11:48.900 --> 03:11:51.900]  what do they do to people, not individual people,
[03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:54.900]  not with their individual identities, but statistically.
[03:11:54.900 --> 03:11:59.900]  What does it do to people with meningitis?
[03:11:59.900 --> 03:12:01.900]  What does it do to people with high blood pressure?
[03:12:01.900 --> 03:12:03.900]  You want to know that.
[03:12:03.900 --> 03:12:09.900]  So Israel became, if you will, the lab for Pfizer, and that's how we did it.
[03:12:09.900 --> 03:12:11.900]  We gave the information to the world.
[03:12:11.900 --> 03:12:14.900]  It's been published in medical magazines and so on.
[03:12:14.900 --> 03:12:17.900]  That's a database we have.
[03:12:17.900 --> 03:12:23.900]  I intend to bring on that database of personal medical records
[03:12:23.900 --> 03:12:27.900]  for an entire population, a genetic database, genomes, okay?
[03:12:27.900 --> 03:12:29.900]  Give me a saliva sample.
[03:12:29.900 --> 03:12:30.900]  Volunteer.
[03:12:30.900 --> 03:12:32.900]  But I'm sure most people will do it.
[03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:34.900]  Maybe we'll pay them.
[03:12:34.900 --> 03:12:40.900]  Now we have a genetic record on a medical record of a robust population.
[03:12:40.900 --> 03:12:42.900]  You have to have diversified populations.
[03:12:42.900 --> 03:12:44.900]  We have people from 100 lands.
[03:12:44.900 --> 03:12:46.900]  This is a very powerful engine.
[03:12:46.900 --> 03:12:51.900]  Now let pharma companies, let medical companies,
[03:12:51.900 --> 03:12:55.900]  let them run algorithms on this database, okay?
[03:12:55.900 --> 03:12:58.900]  I'm telling you right away that I'll give preference for a few years
[03:12:58.900 --> 03:13:02.900]  to Israeli firms, and then to the world,
[03:13:02.900 --> 03:13:09.900]  but you can create a biotechnological industry that is unheard of right now.
[03:13:09.900 --> 03:13:10.900]  Unheard of.
[03:13:10.900 --> 03:13:12.900]  All right, let's end it there.
[03:13:12.900 --> 03:13:15.900]  So let's look at some of the things that were said here.
[03:13:15.900 --> 03:13:20.900]  Israel became the lab for Pfizer.
[03:13:20.900 --> 03:13:24.900]  Have we forgotten that the Israeli government did this
[03:13:24.900 --> 03:13:26.900]  to their own people?
[03:13:26.900 --> 03:13:30.900]  Have we forgotten that every single government worldwide participated
[03:13:30.900 --> 03:13:31.900]  in this?
[03:13:31.900 --> 03:13:36.900]  To support any government right now is ludicrous.
[03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:40.900]  I don't care what side we're on, and we shouldn't be taking sides
[03:13:40.900 --> 03:13:45.900]  because it seems we've forgotten that the ones who want to destroy us are
[03:13:45.900 --> 03:13:49.900]  pulling the strings behind every single one of these events.
[03:13:49.900 --> 03:13:54.900]  There is always a greater purpose in light of the greater goal,
[03:13:54.900 --> 03:13:57.900]  which is the great reset, which includes bankrupting you,
[03:13:57.900 --> 03:14:01.900]  which includes destroying your bodily autonomy.
[03:14:01.900 --> 03:14:07.900]  He also went to say that, you know, 20 years of digitized health records,
[03:14:07.900 --> 03:14:10.900]  he's created 20 years of digitized health records.
[03:14:10.900 --> 03:14:14.900]  He's led that with his buddies at Pfizer.
[03:14:14.900 --> 03:14:17.900]  And let's not also ignore the fact that he's saying, you know,
[03:14:17.900 --> 03:14:20.900]  now they've got this database of genomes for all populations,
[03:14:20.900 --> 03:14:22.900]  100 countries there.
[03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:32.160]  People from 100 lands, Dr Francis Boyle was on earlier today, he spoke to me about the
[03:14:32.160 --> 03:14:40.160]  dangers in future of creating genetic bioweapons, ethnic-specific bioweapons, we've heard that
[03:14:40.160 --> 03:14:43.040]  even from Dr Mike Yeadon.
[03:14:43.040 --> 03:14:48.440]  The data that they collected through, you know, How Bad is My Batch, for example, when
[03:14:48.440 --> 03:14:52.440]  they saw that certain batches were harming people, certain batches were, they were released
[03:14:52.440 --> 03:14:59.900]  into say a red state, the harmful batches, and we're forgetting that Israel took part
[03:14:59.900 --> 03:15:01.400]  in this?
[03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:05.700]  What I'm trying to do, I'm not trying to demonize Israel here, I'm trying to remind people that
[03:15:05.700 --> 03:15:12.880]  our common enemy are the globalists and every single leader in government that has participated
[03:15:12.880 --> 03:15:18.640]  in the real war on humanity, which this war is part of now, it forms part of the greater
[03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:23.840]  war which is against all of mankind.
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:25.560]  No country is exempt.
[03:15:25.560 --> 03:15:30.240]  The globalists do not love the Jews, they do not love the Palestinians, they do not
[03:15:30.240 --> 03:15:35.000]  love Americans, they do not love Australians, they love no one, they don't even know what
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:37.240]  love is.
[03:15:37.240 --> 03:15:42.360]  All they have is hatred and destruction in their hearts.
[03:15:42.360 --> 03:15:47.040]  And considering all of the things that don't add up about this particular story, I would
[03:15:47.040 --> 03:15:48.760]  say that they're behind this too.
[03:15:48.760 --> 03:15:53.560]  We'll be back right after this short break with Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, we're struggling
[03:15:53.560 --> 03:15:56.480]  to get Shimon on, I'll see you in a moment.
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:01.640]  The wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them, but the Lord laughs
[03:16:01.640 --> 03:16:04.960]  at the wicked for he knows their day is coming.
[03:16:04.960 --> 03:16:09.840]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy, slay those
[03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:15.120]  whose ways are upright, but their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:16.120]  be broken.
[03:16:16.200 --> 03:16:21.040]  Better the little that have righteousness than the wealth of any wicked, for the power
[03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:25.760]  of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.
[03:16:25.760 --> 03:16:30.880]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will endure forever.
[03:16:30.880 --> 03:16:37.280]  In times of disaster they will not wither, in days of famine they will not plunder, but
[03:16:37.280 --> 03:16:38.280]  the wicked will perish.
[03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:44.080]  Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed and they
[03:16:44.080 --> 03:16:56.800]  will go up in smoke.
[03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:00.840]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:04.520]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[03:17:04.520 --> 03:17:08.760]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing
[03:17:08.760 --> 03:17:09.760]  them.
[03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:11.920]  We're not just exposing their operation.
[03:17:11.920 --> 03:17:17.560]  In my new book, we give you the solutions to build a new, better world, an alternative
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:20.640]  to Klaus Schwab's, You Will Eat the Bugs.
[03:17:20.640 --> 03:17:25.560]  This is The Great Awakening, the plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great
[03:17:25.560 --> 03:17:26.560]  renaissance.
[03:17:26.560 --> 03:17:30.680]  It's a companion to my last book that was a number one worldwide bestseller and this
[03:17:30.680 --> 03:17:33.520]  book is even thicker and even more powerful.

[03:19:05.320 --> 03:19:06.680]  worldwide?
[03:19:06.680 --> 03:19:09.600]  Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III with Russia?
[03:19:09.600 --> 03:19:11.160]  Well, I know where you are.

[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:32.900]  This is my second book, part two of The Great Recent and War for the World.

[03:20:18.060 --> 03:20:20.060]  different countries.
[03:20:20.060 --> 03:20:25.260]  We've finally got Shimon Yanowitz here live from Israel for the next few minutes before
[03:20:25.260 --> 03:20:28.300]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers comes on with a U.S. military perspective.
[03:20:28.300 --> 03:20:30.260]  Shimon, thank you so much for joining us today.
[03:20:30.260 --> 03:20:32.860]  We appreciate it.
[03:20:32.860 --> 03:20:35.300]  Thank you very much, Maria.
[03:20:35.300 --> 03:20:36.300]  It's good to have you.
[03:20:36.300 --> 03:20:38.620]  Look, I am doing well.
[03:20:38.620 --> 03:20:39.620]  Thank you.
[03:20:39.620 --> 03:20:46.220]  I just read the first part of the email that you sent me regarding your belief as an Israeli
[03:20:46.220 --> 03:20:52.020]  in Israel and many others from that region share your sentiment that the Israeli government
[03:20:52.020 --> 03:20:56.020]  allowed, if not facilitated, this so-called invasion.
[03:20:56.020 --> 03:21:01.940]  We have about eight minutes, Shimon, so if you can give us a brief rundown of what the
[03:21:01.940 --> 03:21:06.980]  general feel is from the Israeli population right now and why you believe this is happening.
[03:21:07.900 --> 03:21:20.900]  Well, I guess that the Israeli population is divided like they are on COVID and the injections and all the stuff that has been going on for the past three and a half years.
[03:21:20.900 --> 03:21:34.900]  So some of the population, the more sober part, I guess, realized that this was a well-planned and orchestrated operation
[03:21:34.900 --> 03:21:46.900]  while maybe the other part thinks that this was some kind of intelligence failure or some kind of innocent mistake, which it clearly wasn't.
[03:21:46.900 --> 03:21:56.900]  Well, you're an engineer, Shimon. Is it possible that this was an engineering, an intelligence failure on the part of Israel with one of the most advanced defense systems in the world?
[03:21:57.900 --> 03:22:13.900]  Totally impossible. And not only that, this comes exactly 50 years and a day, so it's the 50th Jubilee of the Yom Kippur War of 1973,
[03:22:13.900 --> 03:22:27.900]  which interestingly had a very similar event, perhaps a surprise attack combined by the Egyptian and Syrian armies.
[03:22:27.900 --> 03:22:35.900]  Although all the intelligence was there, now I'm past 50 years, so I was a young boy when that happened.
[03:22:36.900 --> 03:22:46.900]  The traumatic memory in Israeli public mind is still there from that miserable war. All the intelligence, all the information was there.
[03:22:46.900 --> 03:23:00.900]  It was simply ignored to facilitate the globalist agenda that wanted to allow the Egyptians and the Syrians to occupy some land for the purpose of some negotiations.
[03:23:01.900 --> 03:23:14.900]  Right, okay, so you've made a comment to me further down when we spoke, and yesterday as well, that the fingerprints of Henry Kissinger are all over this. Why do you believe that?
[03:23:15.900 --> 03:23:33.900]  Well, we now know that Henry Kissinger and General Moshe Dayan, who was the Defense Minister of Israel at the time under the puppet Prime Minister Golda Meir,
[03:23:34.900 --> 03:23:52.900]  they were the masterminds, and Anwar Sadat, the former Egyptian President, they carefully designed all this Yom Kippur War, and the purpose was to allow the enemy, Egypt in that case,
[03:23:52.900 --> 03:24:20.900]  The intention was to try to establish some peace agreement between Israel and Egypt then, and to give back the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.
[03:24:20.900 --> 03:24:39.900]  Now, if public opinion is very strong against this, then what do you do? You create some kind of trauma in the public opinion, and then you prepare people's mindsets for the sacrifice that you require of them.
[03:24:39.900 --> 03:24:54.900]  As I think happened during COVID times, right, when they had all this mainstream media propaganda of killer virus, all intended to prepare people to accept the jabs.
[03:24:54.900 --> 03:25:11.900]  So there is obviously something similar going on here. They want to prepare the mindset of people for some kind of very problematic settlement or arrangement or maybe a war. So they did this.
[03:25:11.900 --> 03:25:33.900]  You said that to me yesterday that you believe that this is just an extension of essentially the terrorist attack that the globalists launched, you know, years ago now, but very obviously during the COVID times. And nothing's really changed. It's just that the location perhaps has and the people that suffer.
[03:25:33.900 --> 03:25:42.900]  Tell me, Shimon, because you said there's also a threat of Hezbollah now in the region. What's happening in regards to that?
[03:25:43.900 --> 03:26:02.900]  Let me just add, Maria, I forgot to say that just over two weeks prior to this attack, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited New York, and he met with Henry Kissinger. He also met with Joe Biden, but that doesn't count, I think.
[03:26:02.900 --> 03:26:12.900]  His main meeting was with Henry Kissinger, who this year celebrated his 100th birthday. And I must say he's doing very well.
[03:26:13.900 --> 03:26:20.900]  It may not matter if he met with Biden. Depends if Obama was in the room. But yes, do go on. He's the oldest globalist alive, you said to me.
[03:26:21.900 --> 03:26:38.900]  Yeah, Henry Kissinger is the oldest globalist alive, and he was the mastermind of the Yom Kippur War. So I think my guess is that Netanyahu has been given his briefing and instructions to go back with to Israel to prepare for this mega event.
[03:26:38.900 --> 03:26:53.900]  Now, answering your question, so first of all, this is not the war. This is just some battle in a war that has been raging for three and a half years now, which is called COVID or whatever you want to call it.
[03:26:53.900 --> 03:27:13.900]  And yeah, regarding Lebanon and Hezbollah, there is the concern that this could escalate to the Lebanese border. And there is Hezbollah, another extreme Islamist force.
[03:27:14.900 --> 03:27:32.900]  And we as citizens or as conscious people clearly don't want that. But the globalists may want that. So this is the concern. We are now in a very tense and volatile waiting to see how this develops.
[03:27:33.900 --> 03:27:55.900]  Shimon, I can't even imagine what it's like being in Israel or any country really, knowing full well that the people that are telling you that this is, you know, we were breached or this was some sort of a failure on our part or an intelligence failure, knowing full well that it was very likely orchestrated, very likely allowed to happen to the people.
[03:27:55.900 --> 03:28:11.900]  I'm not sure if you caught it before. I played the clip of Netanyahu bragging about how, you know, Israel became the lab for Pfizer. I'm sure that you as an Israeli don't feel very nice about knowing that the prime minister has submitted you to be in a lab with Pfizer.
[03:28:11.900 --> 03:28:27.900]  Not only has he submitted us to be in the lab with Pfizer, he made sure that Israel was the first country in the world to receive these precious and as we know, highly toxic Pfizer injectables.
[03:28:27.900 --> 03:28:54.900]  And we're almost out of time today. I'm so sorry to cut you off here because I wish I wish we had more time with you. But listen, our genuine prayers are with the people, all people affected. Please stay safe and please keep in touch with us. We want to know what's happening on the ground there. And I just hope you all you and all of your family are very, very safe. Thank you for your time today. Don't go anywhere. We're back with Lieutenant Colonel.
[03:28:54.900 --> 03:29:21.900]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week. I come in this morning. It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.

[03:33:12.000 --> 03:33:16.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host Maria Z. Apologies everyone for
[03:33:16.400 --> 03:33:21.840]  the short segment there with Shimon Yanowitz straight out of Israel. We needed to get to
[03:33:21.840 --> 03:33:27.080]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers who will be joining us in just one moment. We will definitely
[03:33:27.080 --> 03:33:31.199]  definitely get Shimon on. I'm planning on talking with him about some new discoveries
[03:33:31.199 --> 03:33:36.400]  that he has regarding the injections, which is what I usually interview him about. And
[03:33:36.400 --> 03:33:40.439]  we'll definitely touch on the geopolitical with him in that interview as well. So that
[03:33:40.439 --> 03:33:46.759]  will be up on Zmedia.com and Band.video in due course. Lieutenant Colonel Chambers should
[03:33:46.759 --> 03:33:53.640]  be with us now online to give us the US military perspective. But he's the perfect person to
[03:33:53.640 --> 03:33:59.439]  speak on this as well because he served such a long time in the Middle East region. Lieutenant
[03:33:59.439 --> 03:34:07.000]  Colonel Chambers, thank you so much. You're welcome and good to see you again, Maria.
[03:34:07.000 --> 03:34:12.980]  It's great to see you. Look, I think that this is a very precarious time. I just spoke
[03:34:12.980 --> 03:34:21.240]  about President Vladimir Putin says that the creation of Palestinian state is a necessity.
[03:34:21.240 --> 03:34:27.320]  This is a very, very, I mean, this is a statement of biblical proportions. We're looking at
[03:34:27.320 --> 03:34:32.900]  potentially a lot of Christians are perceiving this as the Gog and Magog War. But I want
[03:34:32.900 --> 03:34:36.980]  to talk to you about the border. I want to, you know, Michael Yon was just on InfoWars
[03:34:36.980 --> 03:34:42.500]  this week discussing the fact that many, many, apart from the fact that we all know military
[03:34:42.500 --> 03:34:48.140]  aged men are crossing the border a lot from the Middle East. What do you think is it could
[03:34:48.140 --> 03:34:50.779]  unfold here, Lieutenant Colonel Chambers?
[03:34:50.779 --> 03:34:57.019]  Right. And when in the fog of war and in the chaos that ensues, you know, back in the in
[03:34:57.019 --> 03:35:00.740]  the old days, they put smoke screens across the battlefield. Well, now the smoke screen
[03:35:00.740 --> 03:35:05.619]  screens are created by the information wars that take place. And, you know, you can you
[03:35:05.619 --> 03:35:12.699]  can you can use psyops, which is a different form of information war. And what and you
[03:35:12.699 --> 03:35:18.300]  can use fear. Now, the enemy, the cabal uses fear. And so this fear that was that has been
[03:35:18.300 --> 03:35:25.939]  created in my my estimate, my understanding, look, Israel, this this situation with Israel
[03:35:25.939 --> 03:35:31.539]  pertains directly to this border situation as as that kind of smoke screen. But for them,
[03:35:31.539 --> 03:35:36.179]  it's not a smoke screen. Now it's the mainline effort. And when you see something like this
[03:35:36.179 --> 03:35:42.939]  take place with one of the most astute intelligence agencies in the world, unable to predict that
[03:35:42.939 --> 03:35:48.580]  this was about to happen, that doesn't make a lick of sense, as we say here in Texas. So
[03:35:48.580 --> 03:35:52.500]  we have to consider that. And that makes the red flags go up. That's that's when the flags
[03:35:52.500 --> 03:35:57.220]  go up and you say, all right, this is this is not the Israel that we would expect to
[03:35:57.220 --> 03:36:00.900]  respond to something like this. Therefore, our flags go up here on the border.
[03:36:01.000 --> 03:36:09.520]  And so now we're talking about, I mean, I didn't get the chance to send this through
[03:36:09.520 --> 03:36:16.120]  to the team before we started today, but we've actually had pro-Palestine supporters here
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:24.840]  in Sydney, Australia, chanting in the streets, gas the Jews, which is abhorrent. And of course,
[03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:30.840]  as soon as propaganda comes out from the lying media, people go and pick a side. It's what
[03:36:30.840 --> 03:36:36.080]  I started this segment talking about and it's exactly what they want you to do. But, you
[03:36:36.080 --> 03:36:41.600]  know, what are the, we're talking, Shimon just alluded to the fact that Hezbollah is
[03:36:41.600 --> 03:36:47.880]  a very real threat and Lebanon may come in and, you know, use this opportunity. What
[03:36:47.880 --> 03:36:54.640]  about in the United States? You've just had an EBS test. You've had all these people flooding
[03:36:54.640 --> 03:36:59.520]  the border. What are the chances of this type of escalation there as tensions increase in
[03:36:59.520 --> 03:37:00.520]  the Middle East?
[03:37:00.520 --> 03:37:06.440]  Right. So I'll paint the picture here for the past 20 years and especially for me over
[03:37:06.440 --> 03:37:12.800]  the past several years working on the border, paying attention to national security issues,
[03:37:12.800 --> 03:37:18.880]  cells inside this country and for different things. But before I do that, I want to clarify
[03:37:18.880 --> 03:37:23.320]  something with this. When people start getting emotional and start picking sides, the cooler
[03:37:23.320 --> 03:37:28.480]  heads have to prevail. We have to talk facts because we've got to dispel these rumors of
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:32.880]  fear and stop these because these things are what are separating and dividing us, you
[03:37:32.880 --> 03:37:37.160]  know, divided we fall kind of thing. So that's number one. So what we're looking at here
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:41.480]  is Hezbollah and Hamas. Both are operating in this country. They have been for the past
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:45.780]  several years. I speak regularly with Todd Bensman, who's a senior fellow at the Center
[03:37:45.780 --> 03:37:49.960]  for Immigration Studies. Very astute gentleman when it comes to this. And he writes a lot
[03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:55.320]  of stuff and he has things go back 10 years on this particular infiltration, if you will.
[03:37:55.320 --> 03:38:01.160]  So let's just consider Hezbollah at this time. So there's a unit 910, 910. That is
[03:38:01.160 --> 03:38:07.080]  the it's the external security organization. So think of them kind of like they're doing
[03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:12.760]  intelligence operations, which is, you know, gathering information. And within our within
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:16.880]  our borders, they've been doing it for a long time coming across. So several of them have
[03:38:16.880 --> 03:38:21.600]  been rolled up coming across our southern border over the past 10 years. So when we
[03:38:21.600 --> 03:38:25.880]  get down to the story, what they're really doing, those those particular individuals
[03:38:25.880 --> 03:38:32.520]  were not rolled up for for a pre 9-11 or a pre terrorist attack. But they're preparing
[03:38:32.520 --> 03:38:37.680]  the battlefield for those next cells to come in. That's where that's where we're at now.
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:44.520]  So they also function as a money gathering institute institution as well, kind of like
[03:38:44.520 --> 03:38:49.680]  the mafia leaning on people in the local communities that are of Lebanese or Muslim descent. So
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:54.840]  you have that combination of what those those ESOs do those external security organizations
[03:38:54.840 --> 03:39:00.040]  do. Now, now we look at Venezuela and the tie to Hezbollah. And that's what I'm going to
[03:39:00.040 --> 03:39:04.200]  deal with right now, because that's closest to my canoe, I usually use that term. And
[03:39:04.200 --> 03:39:11.960]  Hezbollah is Iran, Shia Muslims from Iran, that were Ayatollah Khomeini's disciples,
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:17.960]  if you will. And so that those people operate out of Lebanon. But there is a close tie to
[03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:24.880]  Hezbollah with Venezuela. So Venezuela is an upheaval the last 10 years or so. And now
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:30.040]  we see regularly regularly on my border on this border, hundreds of countries coming
[03:39:30.040 --> 03:39:36.800]  across and the predominant Muslim nation countries that have come across now are Venezuelan,
[03:39:36.800 --> 03:39:43.400]  but not Muslim, Muslim country, but the ties to Muslim countries of terrorist organizations,
[03:39:43.960 --> 03:39:48.360]  Venezuela, straight up, lots of folks just come out of jail down there, they were released from
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:53.400]  prison. And that is right now within the past month or so I know of at least the numbers right
[03:39:53.400 --> 03:40:01.480]  around 10,000 have come across the southern border. And that is that's what I mean, your
[03:40:01.480 --> 03:40:05.480]  information matches exactly what Michael Yones reported, you're both doing tremendous work on
[03:40:05.480 --> 03:40:10.280]  the border. And we're so grateful for you. What does this mean for the United States,
[03:40:10.280 --> 03:40:14.360]  considering all these people with terrorist ties are just flooding in? Are they preparing
[03:40:14.360 --> 03:40:19.880]  for something? Yeah, well, we have to we have to think that way. Because if they're bringing
[03:40:19.880 --> 03:40:24.440]  in people that are not just collectors on the on the street, not just information or intelligence
[03:40:24.440 --> 03:40:29.640]  collectors, but we're bringing in people of nefarious character and nature and more violent,
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:34.760]  extreme type characters, then I have to go there, I have to go there, I cannot do anything but think
[03:40:34.760 --> 03:40:41.000]  that. I don't have anything particular. If I did, I would probably get it to the right sources.
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:45.720]  But I have not run across anything particular of any elements like that inside. I know they're
[03:40:45.720 --> 03:40:52.520]  here. I just don't have any anything that I can pinpoint. Well, we appreciate that insight. And
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:40:58.920]  also dispelling the fear because, you know, it's it this isn't about telling everyone that we're at
[03:40:58.920 --> 03:41:03.960]  imminent threat. But it's also the point is to always be aware that you're at imminent threat,
[03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:08.840]  because we are at war, we have been at war for some time, just because we can't physically see
[03:41:08.840 --> 03:41:13.080]  it like the people in Israel and Palestine right now, or the people in Russia and Ukraine
[03:41:13.080 --> 03:41:18.360]  doesn't mean it's not happening. On the other side of the break, I want to get into some of
[03:41:18.360 --> 03:41:25.240]  the other developments inside the United States with you, Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, with you,
[03:41:25.240 --> 03:41:31.080]  maybe you can verify for me, I just heard word that there is Texas is making efforts to ensure
[03:41:31.080 --> 03:41:37.400]  that mandates can never come back. And and there there are some very positive things happening.
[03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:44.200]  Do you think that that Texas is going to be really the shining light for the rest of the country?
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:51.320]  Texas is is the shining light from my standpoint, because I'm here, but also I'm seeing
[03:41:51.320 --> 03:41:57.640]  some wins. We had our attorney general that just came out of so-called, you know, so sabbatical
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:01.720]  because he was being investigated. He's out, he's swinging now, he's swinging on some information
[03:42:01.720 --> 03:42:06.120]  that Michael Yan and Ann Vanderstil and myself were able to reveal over there with this big
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:12.360]  40 acre, 40 square mile property for illegals to be housed. So those things are happening. He's
[03:42:12.360 --> 03:42:17.960]  coming out, he's squaring up for it, the fight, as well as the countermandate fight, which is
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:24.680]  amazing news here. But remember this, for the United States, Texas is the first domino
[03:42:24.680 --> 03:42:28.920]  over the flyover states, the center states, not the east or west coast,
[03:42:29.560 --> 03:42:34.440]  the conservative strongholds. Texas is that first domino and it cannot fall.
[03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:44.040]  Absolutely agree with you. Having visited Texas myself and seeing what you're saying firsthand,
[03:42:44.040 --> 03:42:47.480]  I couldn't agree with you more. Stay with us. We'll be back on the other side of the break
[03:42:47.480 --> 03:42:53.480]  with Lieutenant Colonel Chambers for his closing comments and analysis and share this broadcast
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:59.560]  everywhere. You're not getting this anywhere else. Where were you when humanity was fighting
[03:42:59.560 --> 03:43:04.760]  for its life? Where were you when the globals were caught trafficking millions of children
[03:43:04.760 --> 03:43:09.160]  for sex slavery worldwide? Where were you when the New World Order was starting World War III
[03:43:09.160 --> 03:43:13.960]  with Russia? Well, I know where you are. You're watching and listening to Infowars.com right now

[03:45:14.600 --> 03:45:20.360]  a powerful book. It covers all the globalist plans, the latest developments, how to stop them,
[03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:25.640]  and then gives an alternate plan of a society we could build together. That's why it's The Great

[03:47:05.700 --> 03:47:17.300]  We are living in times of biblical proportions, people.
[03:47:17.300 --> 03:47:23.460]  Russian President Vladimir Putin says creation of Palestinian state is necessary.
[03:47:23.460 --> 03:47:29.740]  Meanwhile, breaking news, Joe Biden has said, issued a warning to other powers, quote, thinking
[03:47:29.740 --> 03:47:32.860]  of taking advantage of the situation, end quote.
[03:47:32.860 --> 03:47:38.940]  And he says, quote, I have one word, don't, end quote.
[03:47:38.940 --> 03:47:44.940]  So very, very interesting developments right now with Lieutenant Colonel Pete Chambers
[03:47:44.940 --> 03:47:45.940]  live.
[03:47:45.940 --> 03:47:50.380]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, I want to ask you, Biden is, you know, breaking his word
[03:47:50.380 --> 03:47:55.220]  right now, talking about, you know, building the wall now.
[03:47:55.220 --> 03:48:01.820]  Do you think that the United States may rethink their, or the Biden administration may rethink
[03:48:01.820 --> 03:48:04.620]  its position on this wall, considering this threat?
[03:48:04.620 --> 03:48:06.060]  Or has it been planned all along?
[03:48:06.060 --> 03:48:07.900]  What do you think is going to happen now?
[03:48:07.900 --> 03:48:08.900]  Right.
[03:48:08.900 --> 03:48:13.500]  So anytime I hear anything about Joe Biden, first of all, I have to consider what's going
[03:48:13.500 --> 03:48:18.400]  on in the shadows behind the background of this next smokescreen that he's putting up.
[03:48:18.400 --> 03:48:19.740]  So we have to watch out.
[03:48:19.740 --> 03:48:27.220]  So be on the lookout for the next laptop or the next, you know, child trafficking story
[03:48:27.220 --> 03:48:30.740]  that's linked to the cabal in D.C.
[03:48:30.740 --> 03:48:32.700]  I'm telling you right now, that's what this is.
[03:48:32.700 --> 03:48:34.540]  This is all just smokescreen.
[03:48:34.540 --> 03:48:39.580]  There will be probably some panels put up on the border with the new fence that he's
[03:48:39.580 --> 03:48:41.220]  now decided to do.
[03:48:41.220 --> 03:48:43.940]  But it's going to be an optic once again.
[03:48:43.940 --> 03:48:44.940]  And it's a shell game.
[03:48:44.940 --> 03:48:51.860]  And just remember, keep your eyes focused on the deeper subjects, the more meaningful.
[03:48:51.860 --> 03:48:54.780]  This thing is, that's just an optic.
[03:48:54.780 --> 03:48:58.540]  Anytime he says anything about the border or any of them, it may work with the H.S.
[03:48:58.540 --> 03:48:59.540]  optic.
[03:48:59.540 --> 03:49:00.540]  Right.
[03:49:00.540 --> 03:49:05.940]  But of course, the awareness is growing amongst the U.S. population as to how serious this
[03:49:05.940 --> 03:49:06.940]  border problem is.
[03:49:06.940 --> 03:49:11.140]  Are you seeing more people involved in actually putting a stop to this?
[03:49:11.140 --> 03:49:12.140]  Right.
[03:49:12.140 --> 03:49:13.540]  At the local level, yes.
[03:49:13.540 --> 03:49:15.220]  The local action is what's doing it.
[03:49:15.220 --> 03:49:17.300]  It is the state actually.
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:22.540]  Governor Abbott is coming forward now with stronger words, but also action to go behind
[03:49:22.540 --> 03:49:23.540]  it.
[03:49:23.540 --> 03:49:28.740]  The U.S. is conducting operations a little more hands on.
[03:49:28.740 --> 03:49:33.020]  We had a fight on the border front on the island, which is in the Rio Grande Valley
[03:49:33.020 --> 03:49:35.860]  across from about the Roma area.
[03:49:35.860 --> 03:49:37.580]  If you look on a map, you'll see it.
[03:49:37.580 --> 03:49:40.980]  And so there's an island in the middle there where it was used as a stash island.
[03:49:40.980 --> 03:49:43.020]  Mexico was claiming it was theirs.
[03:49:43.020 --> 03:49:44.020]  The C.D.N.
[03:49:44.020 --> 03:49:47.140]  Cartel de Noreste was running operations.
[03:49:47.140 --> 03:49:52.820]  Also with C.J. and J. and G., Jalisco cartel.
[03:49:52.820 --> 03:49:55.180]  Our guys went in there and said, first of all, we did a survey.
[03:49:55.180 --> 03:49:57.620]  The state of Texas did a survey, said, no, it's ours.
[03:49:57.620 --> 03:50:03.540]  It doesn't belong to either the federal government or the Mexican government.
[03:50:03.540 --> 03:50:05.740]  So Texas took a stand on that.
[03:50:05.740 --> 03:50:12.140]  And our guys went on to the island and took it back and are now burning down all the foliage
[03:50:12.140 --> 03:50:13.700]  so they can't hide anymore on there.
[03:50:13.700 --> 03:50:15.380]  So that's what's happening.
[03:50:15.380 --> 03:50:18.180]  Well, I'm very encouraged to hear that.
[03:50:18.180 --> 03:50:21.740]  I'm glad to hear that more people are taking taking action.
[03:50:21.740 --> 03:50:27.620]  Pathetic that the, you know, the government of the day is doing nothing about it.
[03:50:27.620 --> 03:50:30.380]  But I'm glad to see that Abbott's taking some action.
[03:50:30.380 --> 03:50:35.980]  I want to ask you about people starting to, and we're seeing it a lot on social media,
[03:50:35.980 --> 03:50:41.220]  encouraging Americans to arm up or even warning them to do so.
[03:50:41.220 --> 03:50:43.420]  Some pretty big heads saying it as well.
[03:50:43.420 --> 03:50:49.380]  Not for the sake of, you know, a violent insurrection, as the media would claim.
[03:50:49.380 --> 03:50:54.020]  And no, these people do not need to be re-educated, Hillary.
[03:50:54.020 --> 03:51:00.740]  But for the sake of protecting themselves, do you think that there is a very real reason
[03:51:00.740 --> 03:51:03.660]  for people to consider that right now?
[03:51:03.660 --> 03:51:06.300]  Well, in my state, that's the norm.
[03:51:06.300 --> 03:51:08.820]  And you know this.
[03:51:08.820 --> 03:51:09.820]  It's just the norm.
[03:51:09.820 --> 03:51:10.820]  That's how we live.
[03:51:10.820 --> 03:51:14.940]  And there's a lot of respect that takes place when you when you take the weapons out of
[03:51:14.940 --> 03:51:19.140]  the legal citizens, you know, lawful citizens hands.
[03:51:19.900 --> 03:51:22.860]  And it's the bad guys that end up doing all the shooting.
[03:51:22.860 --> 03:51:30.180]  But yeah, I would say that in the appropriate locations, and I don't try to judge who is
[03:51:30.180 --> 03:51:33.780]  appropriate to own a weapon or not, but I definitely don't want to see it in downtown
[03:51:33.780 --> 03:51:34.780]  Chicago with a gang.
[03:51:34.780 --> 03:51:38.700]  You know, that's just a common sense.
[03:51:38.700 --> 03:51:43.820]  But the rest of it, yeah, we kept the Japanese, you know, in their mind from wanting to step
[03:51:43.820 --> 03:51:47.980]  foot on American soil when they said behind every bush will be an American with a gun.
[03:51:47.980 --> 03:51:53.900]  There is a there is a there's a feeling across the world when I travel, I mean, Americans,
[03:51:53.900 --> 03:51:56.420]  all cowboys, America, you're dang skippy.
[03:51:56.420 --> 03:51:58.900]  And that's the way we need to keep that.
[03:51:58.900 --> 03:52:01.020]  So, yeah.
[03:52:01.020 --> 03:52:04.220]  What else do you think that people need to know in light of the current tensions in the
[03:52:04.220 --> 03:52:07.740]  Middle East and everything really that's unfolding in the world?
[03:52:07.740 --> 03:52:10.140]  What are the immediate things to be aware of?
[03:52:10.140 --> 03:52:15.580]  Yeah, so immediately, you know, what I what I would continue to do is always be prepared
[03:52:15.580 --> 03:52:19.900]  for any type of false flag event while that is happening.
[03:52:19.900 --> 03:52:22.380]  Because once again, that's a big, big ticket item.
[03:52:22.380 --> 03:52:23.380]  And I feel for those people.
[03:52:23.380 --> 03:52:24.380]  I got it.
[03:52:24.380 --> 03:52:28.620]  I've taken care of people on combat fields that were the victims of war.
[03:52:28.620 --> 03:52:30.860]  And it's a it's a terrible place to be.
[03:52:30.860 --> 03:52:36.380]  But we have to be careful that that some false flag or some flag that actually triggers
[03:52:36.380 --> 03:52:40.100]  some sort of event like a cyber attack or, you know, when we had our alert the other
[03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:42.260]  day, a lot of people were worried about that.
[03:52:42.260 --> 03:52:43.980]  I think a different story on that.
[03:52:44.900 --> 03:52:49.860]  But honestly, we just we stay focused on our controllables.
[03:52:49.860 --> 03:52:53.020]  And I always say that stay on the things that you can control and you'll be OK.
[03:52:53.020 --> 03:52:54.020]  You'll get through this.
[03:52:54.020 --> 03:52:58.540]  And there are enough of us now where I believe that when I say us, the real white hats, you
[03:52:58.540 --> 03:53:01.660]  know, the Americans that are that are doing things or people in this world.
[03:53:01.660 --> 03:53:02.660]  I mean, you're a white hat.
[03:53:02.660 --> 03:53:04.860]  I mean, for that matter, it's not just Americans.
[03:53:04.860 --> 03:53:10.020]  But in my you know, where I live, that I believe that that we're seeing a shift.
[03:53:10.020 --> 03:53:12.460]  And that's why the cabal is so on their heels.
[03:53:12.460 --> 03:53:14.340]  And that's why they're so afraid.
[03:53:14.340 --> 03:53:18.060]  And they should be afraid because Nuremberg 2.0 will come.
[03:53:18.060 --> 03:53:19.060]  There will be retribution.
[03:53:19.060 --> 03:53:21.100]  Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.
[03:53:21.100 --> 03:53:26.900]  But sometimes faith without works is dead and we might have to be those hands.
[03:53:26.900 --> 03:53:29.260]  I agree with your sentiments.
[03:53:29.260 --> 03:53:36.300]  I think that this new development about from coming out of Putin's mouth about the Palestinian
[03:53:36.300 --> 03:53:41.700]  state and immediately Joe Biden warning those who are planning to take advantage of this
[03:53:41.700 --> 03:53:42.700]  situation.
[03:53:42.700 --> 03:53:48.020]  Very, very, you know, these are comments that need to be watched.
[03:53:48.020 --> 03:53:51.820]  Some people may feel like, you know, their news feed is full of this right now.
[03:53:51.820 --> 03:53:54.500]  But this is this is stuff that's impacting the whole world.
[03:53:54.500 --> 03:53:59.180]  We're no longer dealing with just local issues, although local issues need to local action,
[03:53:59.180 --> 03:54:01.380]  I should say, needs to happen.
[03:54:01.380 --> 03:54:06.060]  You know, we're dealing with everything that happens anywhere in the world affects the
[03:54:06.060 --> 03:54:10.380]  rest of us, because this is the nature of the Great Reset and the New World Order.
[03:54:10.380 --> 03:54:15.460]  Everything is orchestrated to affect the whole world because they want one world government,
[03:54:15.460 --> 03:54:24.100]  one world religion, everyone in the same cities, you know, cutouts, synthetic humans that can
[03:54:24.100 --> 03:54:28.500]  be, you know, that are malleable and no longer think for themselves.
[03:54:28.500 --> 03:54:33.220]  And so this really is the war of humanity.
[03:54:33.220 --> 03:54:37.140]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, we've got a couple of minutes here left.
[03:54:37.140 --> 03:54:43.660]  I want to ask you about the difference between this war and watching, you know, I mean, you've
[03:54:43.660 --> 03:54:48.780]  been in physical war, obviously, and you've seen war propaganda.
[03:54:48.780 --> 03:54:55.380]  But the greater war of the Great Reset against the people, what are the main differences?
[03:54:55.380 --> 03:54:56.900]  Right.
[03:54:56.900 --> 03:55:02.100]  And so when you prep the battlefield in kinetic warfare, when we say prep the battlefield,
[03:55:02.100 --> 03:55:03.660]  that looks like artillery going in.
[03:55:03.780 --> 03:55:08.860]  That looks like remember the early phases of going into Iraq when you saw the jets flying
[03:55:08.860 --> 03:55:15.380]  in Iraq one and two and blowing up the highway of death and chasing them all off into the desert.
[03:55:15.380 --> 03:55:16.380]  That's what that looks like.
[03:55:16.380 --> 03:55:17.540]  That's prepping the battlefield.
[03:55:17.540 --> 03:55:21.020]  This preparation has taken 20 years, 100 years.
[03:55:21.020 --> 03:55:22.420]  It's a lot more nefarious.
[03:55:22.420 --> 03:55:23.420]  It's insidious.
[03:55:23.420 --> 03:55:24.420]  Right.
[03:55:24.420 --> 03:55:25.920]  It's an insidious onset.
[03:55:25.920 --> 03:55:31.620]  And so that onset is like a slow growing cancer that all of a sudden just, boom, appears and
[03:55:31.620 --> 03:55:33.420]  you say, oh, my gosh, it's here now.
[03:55:34.180 --> 03:55:35.180]  And so that's what that looks like.
[03:55:35.180 --> 03:55:39.660]  And that's why that's so hard to fight, because you think that everything's OK.
[03:55:39.660 --> 03:55:41.140]  And then it just pops up in your face.
[03:55:41.140 --> 03:55:43.660]  They take away your freedoms one at a time.
[03:55:43.660 --> 03:55:51.580]  And and you you just fall in line like a good lemming in a sheep when you're when you really
[03:55:51.580 --> 03:55:52.820]  didn't know it was coming.
[03:55:52.820 --> 03:55:59.500]  So that's why this war onset is so now all of a sudden everybody's going, what's happening?
[03:55:59.500 --> 03:56:03.100]  I mean, family members are calling me, friends are calling me from around the country.
[03:56:03.780 --> 03:56:04.780]  What's going on?
[03:56:04.780 --> 03:56:05.780]  I didn't know this was.
[03:56:05.780 --> 03:56:06.780]  How did you not know?
[03:56:06.780 --> 03:56:07.780]  But this is going to wake up more people.
[03:56:07.780 --> 03:56:08.780]  It's OK.
[03:56:08.780 --> 03:56:11.780]  It's just, you know, get on a program, folks.
[03:56:11.780 --> 03:56:13.420]  Well, you know what?
[03:56:13.420 --> 03:56:17.420]  One particular thing I've noticed, I'll share this observation with you.
[03:56:17.420 --> 03:56:23.660]  You know, the number of people that were I thought were awake and and, you know, understood
[03:56:23.660 --> 03:56:29.260]  that the media lies to us immediately jumping on one or the other side, you know, thinking
[03:56:29.260 --> 03:56:30.700]  that they have all the facts.
[03:56:30.700 --> 03:56:34.540]  I mean, this is literally a carbon copy.
[03:56:34.540 --> 03:56:38.140]  It's not because there's different suffering and different people, but it's a carbon copy
[03:56:38.140 --> 03:56:41.020]  of the Russia Ukraine campaign is what I'm saying.
[03:56:41.020 --> 03:56:47.300]  The campaign is a carbon copy where all politicians are coming out, siding with one side immediately.
[03:56:47.300 --> 03:56:48.460]  We just have to support this.
[03:56:48.460 --> 03:56:52.100]  We're not going to ask any questions about this so-called invasion.
[03:56:52.100 --> 03:56:53.740]  Everyone just follow along.
[03:56:53.740 --> 03:56:58.180]  And you know, the support for Israel is very widespread in the United States.
[03:56:58.180 --> 03:56:59.180]  That's why.
[03:56:59.180 --> 03:57:00.180]  And all over the world.
[03:57:00.180 --> 03:57:04.220]  I made that clip earlier to remind people these governments don't care about the people.
[03:57:04.220 --> 03:57:05.940]  It doesn't matter which country you're in.
[03:57:05.940 --> 03:57:07.420]  It's the same thing.
[03:57:07.420 --> 03:57:09.780]  Lieutenant Colonel Chambers, we're out of time today.
[03:57:09.780 --> 03:57:14.220]  We so appreciate, first of all, your service, everything you're doing on the border and
[03:57:14.220 --> 03:57:15.700]  your time today.
[03:57:15.700 --> 03:57:20.580]  You can find more of his work at DrPeteChambers.com.
[03:57:20.580 --> 03:57:21.620]  I want to encourage everyone.
[03:57:21.620 --> 03:57:27.300]  I've ordered Alex's book, the autographed copy as a fundraiser to support InfoWars.
[03:57:27.300 --> 03:57:29.420]  I want to encourage everyone to do the same.
[03:57:29.660 --> 03:57:34.780]  I guarantee you, you are not going to find up-to-date information like you have today
[03:57:34.780 --> 03:57:36.220]  on any other broadcast.
[03:57:36.220 --> 03:57:38.380]  That's why InfoWars is so important.
[03:57:38.380 --> 03:57:39.900]  I'm honored to be part of it.
[03:57:39.900 --> 03:57:40.900]  On to Owen Troyer.
[03:57:40.900 --> 03:57:42.060]  Thank you all and God bless.
[03:57:44.100 --> 03:57:52.300]  We have not had this many of our best selling products back in stock in years because of
[03:57:52.300 --> 03:57:56.100]  supply chain breakdowns and all the rest of the stuff that's gone on and these are game
[03:57:56.100 --> 03:57:57.100]  changing products.
[03:57:57.100 --> 03:57:58.820]  It's like our information is game changing.
[03:57:58.820 --> 03:58:04.820]  These products are incredible and I'm personally glad that these are now back in stock.
[03:58:04.820 --> 03:58:09.580]  All three of the InfoWars Platinum flagship products that have been sold out for months
[03:58:09.580 --> 03:58:16.580]  are now back in stock but a very limited run because we only had a budget to get three
[03:58:16.580 --> 03:58:18.900]  or 4,000 bottles of each one of these.
[03:58:18.900 --> 03:58:24.500]  I think we've got 4,000 bottles of the HGH Max Boost that people love so much.
[03:58:24.500 --> 03:58:29.300]  We've got about 4,000 bottles of 1776 Testosterone Boost that just came in and we've got about
[03:58:29.300 --> 03:58:35.900]  3,000 bottles of PainMD, an incredible natural pain reliever situation.
[03:58:35.900 --> 03:58:40.140]  All three of these are back in stock and they're incredible and they fund our operation
[03:58:40.140 --> 03:58:47.140]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:58:47.140 --> 03:58:50.860]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported InfoWars financially with
[03:58:50.860 --> 03:58:52.820]  word of mouth and prayer.
[03:58:52.820 --> 03:58:56.220]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[03:58:56.220 --> 03:59:00.380]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:59:00.380 --> 03:59:02.740]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[03:59:02.740 --> 03:59:07.180]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsStore.com like books and films
[03:59:07.180 --> 03:59:10.540]  and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.

[03:59:34.940 --> 03:59:39.340]  now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the great
