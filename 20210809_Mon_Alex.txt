[00:00:14.793 --> 00:00:15.894]  InfoWars.
[00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:19.635]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:21.496]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:21.496 --> 00:00:23.797]  There is a war on, for your mind.
[00:00:23.797 --> 00:00:27.539]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful.
[00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.401]  And I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here, minute by minute.
[00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:36.683]  Because I've had chills, uh, since last night.
[00:00:36.683 --> 00:00:39.444]  This just confirms everything else we've already researched.
[00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:52.688]  A Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite, millions being killed, mandatory quarantines, checkpoints, the end of the family, everything that's in the other documents.
[00:00:52.688 --> 00:00:58.732]  But this dovetails with all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and the forced vaccines.
[00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:05.475]  The hell we're already living in is just going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen.
[00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.237]  But that story is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:08.237 --> 00:01:11.579]  The question is, will you have the courage to really do the research yourself?
[00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.761]  Because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims.
[00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:27.394]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers, so many of them, that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers so fast that you could never read them all.
[00:01:27.394 --> 00:01:30.798]  It is an open conspiracy against you and your family.
[00:01:30.798 --> 00:01:35.303]  I pray to God, I pray to my Heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:49.671]  And the will to be able to face this fire and to give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards that I'm a liar.
[00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:50.651]  I know why.
[00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:56.214]  Because it's scary.
[00:01:56.214 --> 00:02:00.596]  You're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore.
[00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:02.957]  You're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends.
[00:02:02.957 --> 00:02:03.898]  You're not going to be able to just
[00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:08.641]  You know, go out and enjoy yourself all the time.
[00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:31.802]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship, this creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you, mentally, psychologically, physically, spiritually, the only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be.
[00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.943]  Once you face this information, once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life.
[00:02:38.943 --> 00:02:41.065]  It should take over your life.
[00:02:41.065 --> 00:02:42.486]  I mean, what else?
[00:02:42.486 --> 00:02:45.749]  What else could it do?
[00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:56.097]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the controlled corporate media has been putting out for decades, ahead of their open, unveiling of planetary dictatorship.
[00:02:57.796 --> 00:03:01.199]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out.
[00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:09.167]  Canada and the United States are going to work in lockstep to display the seriousness of our commitment at both home and abroad.
[00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.210]  Win, lose, or draw, you need to choose a side.
[00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:22.857]  The globalists have said in their white papers, in their own UN documents, that they want to create race-specific bioweapons and other systems to depopulate the planet.
[00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:30.021]  A lot of this, from my sources, is that they're preparing to release bioweapons, claiming that they're naturally occurring.
[00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:36.945]  And then use that as the cover for civil emergency, societal control, crackdowns on free speech.
[00:03:36.945 --> 00:03:39.467]  Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago.
[00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:45.511]  And when he got confronted by Congress, he said, well, it's in case the bird flu or SARS gets out.
[00:03:45.511 --> 00:03:46.152]  Just type that in.
[00:03:46.932 --> 00:03:57.098]  CDC says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or SARS breaks out and they have to control panic and direct every website in the US to one government announcement.
[00:03:57.098 --> 00:04:11.067]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bioweapon release could be the thing they'd release to bring in a world government to counter a global problem and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government.
[00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:12.988]  The answer to 1984.
[00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:30.010]  Info Wars has been banned.
[00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.431]  Arrested.
[00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:36.693]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.154]  Because we are effective.
[00:04:38.154 --> 00:04:41.835]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:04:41.835 --> 00:04:44.116]  Go to band.video.
[00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.197]  Download the videos and share.
[00:05:00.757 --> 00:05:06.840]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell, and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.344]  All of you know what my pillow and myself have gone through in the last five months in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[00:05:14.344 --> 00:05:16.645]  Well, it's all come down to this.
[00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:20.227]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th, and 12th.
[00:05:22.148 --> 00:05:30.333]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, FrankSpeech.com.
[00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:36.237]  You can help by getting everybody you know to go to FrankSpeech.com now.
[00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:46.964]  To help support this cyber symposium event, I am offering some of the best prices ever on my pillow products, but they're only offered at FrankSpeech.com.
[00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:48.225]  Thank you and God bless.
[00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:54.631]  Go to frankspeech.com and enter promo code ALEX or call 800-675-4614 and use promo code ALEX.
[00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:37.308]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live August 9th, 2021 broadcast.
[00:06:37.308 --> 00:06:48.335]  I'm going to do my best to be here with you for the next four hours and I've kind of reached that point again here starting the broadcast where
[00:06:49.811 --> 00:07:00.600]  I just don't have ways to impart to people just how incredibly serious this entire situation is for civilization.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:12.029]  And the fact that the decision has been made to cut the resources off of the planet and have a long controlled collapse into a new dark age that will kill at least 90% of the world population, that is the official plan.
[00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:30.240]  And so when you see Obama and the globalists partying at Martha's Vineyard, they're partying and celebrating the successful war and operations that they have been able to basically launch against humanity.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:38.283]  And people like Obama are simply the front people of the more evil individuals
[00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:42.256]  that are in full control of that.
[00:07:42.256 --> 00:07:50.801]  And so I'm going to really, really, really do my best today to break all of that down for you.
[00:07:50.801 --> 00:08:01.708]  But the first thing I want to do is just let the listeners know that we're going to have to have a larger discussion here
[00:08:03.044 --> 00:08:23.366]  About what we're going to do about this because we've been trained since the advent of the radio and the television to be spectators and to only sit back and watch things as they happen, like it's a movie or a radio drama.
[00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:40.303]  And it's that development in human society that all the behavioral psychologists agree is what turned people into the passive jellyfish that we are today.
[00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:42.845]  And so I'm not ready to do the show at this time.
[00:08:42.845 --> 00:08:47.789]  I have a lot of stuff happen right before the show and then a train of other things that happened right as we began the show.
[00:08:47.789 --> 00:08:49.891]  Nobody's fault.
[00:08:49.891 --> 00:08:51.893]  So I'm going to air some special reports here.
[00:08:53.254 --> 00:08:57.376]  Then I'm going to really try to come back in a focused way with my headset working.
[00:08:57.376 --> 00:09:00.358]  And I'm going to try to do the show here.
[00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:05.581]  Again, thank you so much for joining us here today.
[00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:07.242]  Let's play clip 13.
[00:09:07.242 --> 00:09:09.804]  Let's cue that up.
[00:09:09.804 --> 00:09:13.126]  And let's get that ready here in a moment.
[00:09:13.126 --> 00:09:15.307]  We'll play that clip.
[00:09:15.307 --> 00:09:19.970]  And then we'll play one of these important John Bowne reports.
[00:09:21.926 --> 00:09:28.011]  And then we'll come back and we'll start the main broadcast on this Monday, August 9th show.
[00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:31.554]  Please stay with us.
[00:09:31.554 --> 00:09:33.455]  It's time for us to resist.
[00:09:33.455 --> 00:09:35.357]  They can't arrest all of us.
[00:09:35.357 --> 00:09:38.219]  They can't keep all of your kids home from school.
[00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:45.765]  They can't keep every government building closed, although I've got a long list of ones they might keep closed or might ought to keep closed.
[00:09:46.906 --> 00:09:53.211]  We don't have to accept the mandates, lockdowns, and harmful policies of the petty tyrants and bureaucrats.
[00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:55.553]  We can simply say no, not again.
[00:09:55.553 --> 00:10:02.038]  Nancy Pelosi, you will not arrest or stop me or anyone on my staff from doing our jobs.
[00:10:02.859 --> 00:10:07.223]  We have either had COVID, had the vaccine, or been offered the vaccine.
[00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:09.304]  We will make our own health choices.
[00:10:09.304 --> 00:10:11.466]  We will not show you a passport.
[00:10:11.466 --> 00:10:12.787]  We will not wear a mask.
[00:10:12.787 --> 00:10:20.113]  We will not be forced into random screenings and testings so you can continue your drunk with power reign over the Capitol.
[00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:27.438]  We will not accept your agency's mandates or your reported moves towards a lockdown.
[00:10:27.438 --> 00:10:32.121]  No one should follow the CDC's anti-science mask mandates.
[00:10:32.121 --> 00:10:44.028]  And if you want to shut down federal agencies again, some of which aren't even back to work yet, I will stop every bill coming through the Senate with an amendment to cut their funding if they don't come back to work in person.
[00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:51.992]  Local bureaucrats and union bosses, we will not allow you to do more harm to our children again this year.
[00:10:51.992 --> 00:10:57.014]  Children are not at any more risk from COVID than they are from the seasonal flu.
[00:10:57.014 --> 00:11:02.856]  Every adult who works in schools has either had the vaccine or had their chance to get vaccinated.
[00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:08.259]  There is no reason for mask mandates, part-time schools, or any lockdown measures.
[00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:18.925]  Children are falling behind in school and are being harmed physically and psychologically by the tactics that you have used to keep them from the classroom during the last year.
[00:11:18.925 --> 00:11:20.567]  We won't allow it again.
[00:11:20.567 --> 00:11:28.151]  If a school system attempts to keep children from full-time in-person school, I will hold up every bill with two amendments.
[00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:34.756]  One to defund them and another to allow parents the choice of where the money goes for their child's education.
[00:11:35.296 --> 00:11:37.158]  Do I sound fed up to you?
[00:11:37.158 --> 00:11:39.000]  That's because I am.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.962]  I'm not a career politician.
[00:11:40.962 --> 00:11:43.505]  I've practiced medicine for 33 years.
[00:11:43.505 --> 00:11:45.687]  I graduated from Duke Medical School.
[00:11:45.687 --> 00:11:47.229]  I've worked in emergency rooms.
[00:11:47.229 --> 00:11:49.271]  I've studied immunology and virology.
[00:11:49.271 --> 00:11:52.754]  And I ultimately chose to become an eye surgeon.
[00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:56.398]  I've been telling everyone for a year now that Dr. Fauci
[00:11:57.319 --> 00:12:05.003]  And other public health bureaucrats were not following the science, and I've been proven right time and time again.
[00:12:05.003 --> 00:12:07.124]  But I'm not the only one who's fed up.
[00:12:07.124 --> 00:12:11.807]  I can't go anywhere these days without people coming up and thanking me for standing up for them.
[00:12:11.807 --> 00:12:16.870]  Whether I'm at work, or at events in Kentucky, at airports, in restaurants, or in stores.
[00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.771]  People thank me for taking a stand.
[00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:22.813]  They thank me for standing up for actual science.
[00:12:22.813 --> 00:12:23.934]  For standing up for freedom.
[00:12:24.474 --> 00:12:29.800]  for standing against mandates, lockdowns and bureaucratic power grabs.
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:34.304]  I think the tide is turning as more and more people are willing to stand up.
[00:12:34.304 --> 00:12:39.790]  I see stories from across the country of parents standing up to the unions and school boards.
[00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.475]  I see brave moms standing up and saying my kids need to go back to school in person.
[00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:50.618]  I see members of Congress refusing to comply with petty tyrant Pelosi.
[00:12:50.618 --> 00:12:54.020]  We are at a moment of truth and a crossroads.
[00:12:54.020 --> 00:13:01.963]  Will we allow these people to use fear and propaganda to do further harm to our society, economy, and children?
[00:13:01.963 --> 00:13:05.285]  Or will we stand together and say, absolutely not.
[00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:06.925]  Not this time.
[00:13:06.925 --> 00:13:07.786]  I choose freedom.
[00:13:08.817 --> 00:13:11.418]  Well, that is very powerful and perfectly said.
[00:13:11.418 --> 00:13:18.701]  I'm going to have that video added to the live show feed, our article of the day, so everybody can find it and share it.
[00:13:18.701 --> 00:13:32.747]  And look, good people like Dr. Paul and good people like yourselves, of every race, color, and creed, are going to have to just realize just because you're a nice person does not mean Fauci and people are nice.
[00:13:32.747 --> 00:13:34.527]  I mean, I want to explain something.
[00:13:34.527 --> 00:13:37.869]  Do you understand that Fauci does experiments on living babies?
[00:13:38.908 --> 00:13:40.789]  I told you that it's come out.
[00:13:40.789 --> 00:13:47.694]  You understand that Fauci does experiments on puppies by planting maggots in their bodies and letting the maggots eat them?
[00:13:47.694 --> 00:13:49.015]  I'm not making that up.
[00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:50.616]  That's real.
[00:13:50.616 --> 00:14:03.565]  You understand Fauci scalps living babies and puts their hair of minority babies, that's in the contract, they requested black babies, hair on rats.
[00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:05.166]  They sew it onto the backs of rats and you're like,
[00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:09.832]  This doesn't sound real, because you're not a psychotic murderer!
[00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:20.737]  Like Jeffrey Dahmer grabbing teenagers off the street and injecting boat cleaner acid into their brains so he'd have a sex slave, and then eating them!
[00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:23.958]  Everybody knows mad scientists are the highest card of evil!
[00:14:27.099 --> 00:14:32.920]  I declare war on Fauci and I want him in prison and I want him in prison now, FBI and the rest of you people.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.281]  Get up off your asses, equipment and cowards!
[00:14:35.281 --> 00:14:36.101]  Holy hell!
[00:14:36.101 --> 00:14:39.442]  These people are annihilating our society!
[00:14:39.442 --> 00:14:40.702]  They cooked this whole thing up.
[00:14:40.702 --> 00:14:43.943]  We've got all the damn documents.
[00:14:43.943 --> 00:14:47.143]  Here's the reason I'm so upset.
[00:14:47.143 --> 00:14:55.005]  I've been studying all last night and all today and I've got stuff so horrible here that you think implanting dogs with maggots to eat them is bad?
[00:14:55.005 --> 00:14:55.625]  That's nothing.
[00:14:57.799 --> 00:15:02.462]  I did more research on what they're doing with babies they keep alive, and it was worse than I thought.
[00:15:02.462 --> 00:15:05.384]  They're not just keeping babies alive for a week or two and they're harvesting their organs.
[00:15:05.384 --> 00:15:06.405]  It's worse.
[00:15:06.405 --> 00:15:11.028]  And I can't just sit here and talk about this like it's normal.
[00:15:11.028 --> 00:15:12.229]  I'm not going to get violent.
[00:15:12.229 --> 00:15:13.150]  I'm not going to.
[00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:16.612]  But I am, listen, I am going to Fauci's house.
[00:15:16.612 --> 00:15:18.794]  I am going to Obama's house.
[00:15:18.794 --> 00:15:21.936]  And I am going to their houses to protest them and talk about who they are.
[00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:24.831]  I mean, I'm sick of this crap.
[00:15:24.831 --> 00:15:27.993]  We have to let the globalists know that we know who they are.
[00:15:27.993 --> 00:15:36.039]  And that the editor of the Atlantic magazine that says we all should be able to fly unless we take their deadly shots, we need to go protest his house.
[00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:37.640]  We need to get these people's faces, man.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:40.202]  I mean, I am sick of their crap.
[00:15:40.202 --> 00:15:41.963]  They've declared war on us.
[00:15:41.963 --> 00:15:43.244]  And I'm not going to take it lying down.
[00:15:43.244 --> 00:15:43.885]  I don't know about you.
[00:15:45.003 --> 00:15:46.646]  I want him in prison!
[00:15:46.646 --> 00:15:48.269]  I want him arrested now!
[00:15:48.269 --> 00:15:51.816]  And I want Klaus Schwab Tribe Nerdberg 2 convicted!
[00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:54.722]  And then I want him to have his neck broken in public!
[00:16:00.319 --> 00:16:10.651]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[00:16:10.651 --> 00:16:14.175]  Even more than the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[00:16:14.175 --> 00:16:18.620]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[00:16:19.775 --> 00:16:20.615]  Well guess what?
[00:16:20.615 --> 00:16:34.602]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[00:16:35.803 --> 00:16:41.306]  ...of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[00:16:41.306 --> 00:16:47.668]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[00:16:47.668 --> 00:16:56.972]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[00:16:56.972 --> 00:16:58.033]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:59.557 --> 00:17:05.984]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:13.373]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[00:17:13.373 --> 00:17:19.740]  Consuming too much fluoride forms phosphate crystals around the pineal gland and shuts down its natural functions.
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.404]  Natural functions which have been known for millennia.
[00:17:23.404 --> 00:17:26.128]  The Hindu chakras align with the endocrine system.
[00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:29.732]  The chakra aligned with the pineal gland is the third eye.
[00:17:29.732 --> 00:17:32.275]  Also described as the seat of the soul.
[00:17:32.275 --> 00:17:35.880]  The pineal gland is what connects us to higher levels of consciousness.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.702]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:15.014 --> 00:18:21.840]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.244]  You better believe you got one!
[00:18:26.244 --> 00:18:31.950]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:37.435]  Everything we warned of is now here.
[00:18:41.271 --> 00:18:43.492]  And I say that with great horror.
[00:18:43.492 --> 00:18:46.893]  Not fear, but horror.
[00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:48.454]  Knowing what's going on.
[00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:55.257]  You know, I have all the statistics, all the numbers, and they mirror what I'm personally experiencing, the reason I'm getting upset.
[00:18:55.257 --> 00:18:59.319]  I went on a business trip and then swung by Lake Tahoe for a few days to do some fishing.
[00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:01.720]  I'd never been to Lake Tahoe, and I heard it was an amazing place.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.060]  It is an amazing place.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.501]  I was there, as you know, about a week and a half ago.
[00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:06.722]  And I had three people come up to me.
[00:19:08.032 --> 00:19:20.814]  As we went to lunch at a casino one day and three people there come up to me and say that they had known people that had died after taking the vaccine.
[00:19:22.432 --> 00:19:31.735]  And then I had some other folks, when I was on the trip, come up and say, yeah, they knew a family that had been okay, but then went to the hospital, got put on a ventilator, and they wouldn't let them in, and the next thing they knew, they were dead.
[00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:38.716]  So then I'm, like, sitting there with Rob Doo and my security guy that goes everywhere with me, so I don't have to defend myself if I need to.
[00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:40.357]  He can do a better job.
[00:19:40.357 --> 00:19:47.599]  And we're on this boat with a captain and then a helper guy, eating sandwiches, literally drinking soda pop.
[00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:53.553]  The guy's sitting there, and he goes, yeah, you're Alex Jones, aren't you?
[00:19:53.553 --> 00:19:54.034]  I'm like, yeah.
[00:19:54.034 --> 00:19:56.135]  He goes, yeah, my cousin's 33.
[00:19:56.135 --> 00:20:04.601]  He's in Phoenix, was in Phoenix, and totally healthy, had a sore throat, coughing up some green phlegm.
[00:20:04.601 --> 00:20:05.582]  He goes to a local clinic.
[00:20:06.752 --> 00:20:09.953]  And I went, and let me guess, they didn't do a test, they sent him to the hospital.
[00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:11.474]  He goes, yeah, how do you know that?
[00:20:11.474 --> 00:20:13.754]  And I said, well, I can get where this is going.
[00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:15.755]  Because I hear so much of this.
[00:20:15.755 --> 00:20:16.555]  He starts to look at me weird.
[00:20:16.555 --> 00:20:17.055]  He goes, okay.
[00:20:17.055 --> 00:20:18.976]  And he goes, yeah, it was a city hospital.
[00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:20.076]  They tell him he has COVID.
[00:20:20.076 --> 00:20:22.617]  They tell him to sign a form.
[00:20:22.617 --> 00:20:25.798]  They inject him, put him under, in a coma.
[00:20:25.798 --> 00:20:26.558]  This is what they do.
[00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:29.199]  It's like a horror movie.
[00:20:29.199 --> 00:20:31.120]  And then two days later, he was dead, intubated.
[00:20:32.912 --> 00:20:38.697]  And the family's talking about wanting an autopsy and stuff like that, because obviously green phlegm is bacterial.
[00:20:38.697 --> 00:20:41.600]  It's not viral.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:46.304]  But that's what they've done to most of the people they killed.
[00:20:46.304 --> 00:20:54.291]  So I have a nanny that's worked for us six years, and she just got back to town after a two-week vacation in Michigan visiting her family.
[00:20:56.328 --> 00:21:02.170]  And I'm sitting there cooking eggs this morning in the kitchen for my daughter and I, my youngest daughter, and hash browns.
[00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:07.431]  I don't know why I'm listing that, but I'm cooking hash browns and eggs and bacon.
[00:21:07.431 --> 00:21:09.092]  And I hadn't seen her in two weeks.
[00:21:09.092 --> 00:21:16.974]  She walks in and I said, hey, Sarah, you really gotta not ever take the vaccine.
[00:21:16.974 --> 00:21:19.254]  I know you're gonna refuse it to be able to fly in the future, right?
[00:21:19.254 --> 00:21:20.895]  She goes, no way I'm taking it.
[00:21:20.895 --> 00:21:22.255]  You're absolutely right.
[00:21:22.255 --> 00:21:24.276]  My best friend's sister's husband
[00:21:25.728 --> 00:21:29.131]  He's 34 years old in New York and he just died.
[00:21:29.131 --> 00:21:35.216]  He took the second Pfizer shot and died basically of heart swelling in two days.
[00:21:35.216 --> 00:21:37.418]  And by the way, it was excruciatingly painful.
[00:21:37.418 --> 00:21:39.700]  I think I had like a two-day heart attack.
[00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:40.861]  That's a big, young, strong heart.
[00:21:40.861 --> 00:21:42.622]  He was in good shape.
[00:21:42.622 --> 00:21:44.024]  Dead!
[00:21:44.024 --> 00:21:45.425]  And that's why I'm fronting the floor.
[00:21:45.425 --> 00:21:46.806]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:48.167]  I can't go fishing!
[00:21:48.167 --> 00:21:49.428]  I'm cooking eggs!
[00:21:49.428 --> 00:21:51.030]  They're murdering us!
[00:21:54.665 --> 00:21:56.906]  I can't go eat at the Hard Rock Cafe!
[00:21:56.906 --> 00:21:59.047]  Everybody comes over and says everybody's dying.
[00:21:59.047 --> 00:22:00.507]  My nanny!
[00:22:00.507 --> 00:22:02.528]  Her best friend's sister's husband, dead!
[00:22:02.528 --> 00:22:04.128]  That ain't anecdotal, that happened!
[00:22:04.128 --> 00:22:04.988]  Oh, oh, oh!
[00:22:04.988 --> 00:22:08.130]  And it gets worse.
[00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.150]  Jess, I want you to be calm today, I pray.
[00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:14.212]  Be calm.
[00:22:14.212 --> 00:22:17.233]  She starts telling me the rest of the story.
[00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:19.413]  And she's not a big talker.
[00:22:19.413 --> 00:22:20.954]  She starts, yeah, it gets worse.
[00:22:22.438 --> 00:22:24.940]  The hospital said it was a vaccine reaction.
[00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:28.363]  Killed him?
[00:22:28.363 --> 00:22:30.885]  Microcarditis, or however you say it?
[00:22:30.885 --> 00:22:31.885]  Swelling of the heart?
[00:22:31.885 --> 00:22:38.571]  Well, that hurts like hell, let me tell you.
[00:22:38.571 --> 00:22:47.618]  When they put that on the death certificate, they got pressured to change it because they got told, you're not going to get your insurance money for the two days he was in the hospital dying.
[00:22:49.108 --> 00:22:59.675]  If you don't take that off there, which I already knew when she said it was true, it's already in the news, that when you die of the vaccine, you don't get your insurance.
[00:22:59.675 --> 00:23:05.099]  I mean, they've got every angle figured out here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:05.099 --> 00:23:17.388]  Your husband goes in and has a heart attack in New York City when he's 30-something years old, goes in, fights for his life for two days, the heart swells up, incredibly painful death, I've been told.
[00:23:19.611 --> 00:23:21.692]  And then, they're like, guess what?
[00:23:21.692 --> 00:23:26.916]  The $50,000, whatever the damn bill is, heart substance expense, I don't know what the bill is, I shouldn't say.
[00:23:26.916 --> 00:23:37.983]  Whatever the huge bill is, you're gonna fit that sucker, because if it's a vaccine, it's got liability protection, and we don't cover that.
[00:23:37.983 --> 00:23:39.183]  Now, I got stacks of articles.
[00:23:39.183 --> 00:23:46.068]  I got the main German pathologist association, biggest medical union in Germany of doctors,
[00:23:47.975 --> 00:23:58.418]  Saying that 30-40% of the people they see dying, period, have died, they believe, from the vaccine and it's eating up their bodies, including their hearts, brains, and livers.
[00:23:58.418 --> 00:24:00.739]  As well as lungs.
[00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.479]  That's major German newspapers.
[00:24:02.479 --> 00:24:05.820]  I spent an hour on this yesterday.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:16.463]  I'm sitting here reading all of it, how they're murdering us, and then I can't go fishing, I can't go to a restaurant, I'm not complaining, I'm just saying, I can't sit in my living room or in my kitchen and cook.
[00:24:17.634 --> 00:24:22.798]  Friday eggs over easy.
[00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:24.579]  And again, obviously I'm warning everybody.
[00:24:24.579 --> 00:24:26.860]  I'm warning people at the gas station, the grocery store.
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:28.822]  I walk in the grocery store now and I'm getting food.
[00:24:28.822 --> 00:24:31.023]  I'm like, please check out the vaccines are causing heart attacks.
[00:24:31.023 --> 00:24:36.107]  I mean, I just, I don't shut up anywhere, but I can't even at 7 30 in the morning.
[00:24:37.208 --> 00:24:40.169]  At 8 o'clock in the morning, sit there and notice it.
[00:24:40.169 --> 00:24:41.509]  The good news is I'm on the right page.
[00:24:41.509 --> 00:24:42.690]  I'm like, hey, watch out.
[00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:43.410]  How was your flight back?
[00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.410]  They're trying to make you take a vaccine.
[00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:45.570]  You better fight that.
[00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.271]  You're not taking a shot, are you?
[00:24:47.271 --> 00:24:48.131]  Hell no, I'm not.
[00:24:48.131 --> 00:24:50.112]  You ought to hear this.
[00:24:50.112 --> 00:24:56.713]  But can you imagine the level of death that's going on when you can't talk to anybody, doesn't know somebody died?
[00:24:56.713 --> 00:24:59.174]  I can open the phones up right now for three, four hours.
[00:24:59.174 --> 00:25:00.274]  It'll be call after call.
[00:25:00.274 --> 00:25:05.436]  I'll say, call if you love vaccines, call if you hate vaccines, call if you're nebulous, call if you're neutral.
[00:25:07.253 --> 00:25:10.916]  It'll all be, my brother died, my sister, my son, they're in the hospital, they're dying.
[00:25:10.916 --> 00:25:23.704]  I mean, another frickin' Fauci gets puppy dogs and implants maggots in them while they beg, while maggots eat them, and they drain the blood off to, like, do something with the blood?
[00:25:23.704 --> 00:25:25.986]  And then they keep babies alive and all this?
[00:25:25.986 --> 00:25:35.832]  And then Obama's got, like, thousands of people at Martha's Vineyard, they're still partying day three, but then saying you shouldn't be able to have a Sturgis motorcycle rally?
[00:25:35.832 --> 00:25:36.073]  I mean,
[00:25:37.165 --> 00:25:42.087]  Fauci ran the operation at Wuhan.
[00:25:42.087 --> 00:25:45.308]  He runs it all with Bill Gates.
[00:25:45.308 --> 00:25:46.748]  Stop them!
[00:25:46.748 --> 00:25:51.710]  All you lawyers and cowards and you people in your fancy military uniforms and all of you.
[00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:53.470]  Because if you don't stop them, we are.
[00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.151]  By the way, that's not some bravada.
[00:25:57.151 --> 00:25:58.532]  It's not me acting powerful.
[00:25:58.532 --> 00:26:01.833]  It's me acting like a human saying, we can't take much more of this.
[00:26:01.833 --> 00:26:04.274]  But that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:26:04.274 --> 00:26:05.394]  That's where you split the diamond.
[00:26:06.738 --> 00:26:10.981]  That's where the real kettle of fish comes in.
[00:26:10.981 --> 00:26:14.664]  And I'll explain that, because we don't want violence.
[00:26:14.664 --> 00:26:16.245]  The normal response is violence.
[00:26:16.245 --> 00:26:21.249]  The normal response is to say, we're going to go out and... No, no, we don't do that.
[00:26:21.249 --> 00:26:24.051]  But we let them know, we know you're a murderer.
[00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:31.737]  And when the time comes, through due process, when we take the system back, you are going to swing from the end of a rope after you've been convicted.
[00:26:34.212 --> 00:26:35.273]  So I know how to beat them.
[00:26:35.273 --> 00:26:38.837]  We can do it together, but we gotta talk about it right now.
[00:26:38.837 --> 00:26:51.852]  We gotta discuss it, and we gotta understand, though, if they're able to get much more of their program in, then they're coming to your house, forcibly inoculating you, then the assault's so offensive that the gloves are gonna have to come off, aren't they?
[00:26:51.852 --> 00:26:54.074]  And that's okay.
[00:26:54.074 --> 00:26:54.555]  Stay with us.
[00:26:59.295 --> 00:27:02.178]  The biosecurity state is here.
[00:27:02.178 --> 00:27:08.103]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[00:27:08.103 --> 00:27:21.876]  The corrupt puppet Prime Minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country all the way out to 2024.
[00:27:23.317 --> 00:27:26.518]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[00:27:26.518 --> 00:27:30.539]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[00:27:30.539 --> 00:27:32.299]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:27:32.299 --> 00:27:34.980]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.000]  They're now implementing it.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.240]  And now they've announced that U.S.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.101]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:27:40.101 --> 00:27:49.383]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[00:27:53.767 --> 00:28:08.580]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:14.626]  With promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[00:28:15.186 --> 00:28:18.487]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[00:28:18.487 --> 00:28:25.089]  You can get my Keys to Dream sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[00:28:25.089 --> 00:28:30.751]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[00:28:30.751 --> 00:28:33.292]  Myself, I need this for the Cyber Symposium.
[00:28:33.292 --> 00:28:36.673]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:38.533]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[00:28:38.533 --> 00:28:40.594]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[00:28:40.594 --> 00:28:43.915]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[00:28:44.375 --> 00:28:55.905]  Us getting the word out, with Alex's great show, Infomorce, and you're supporting MyPillow, 2,500 employees, and I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying and being attacked and camped.
[00:28:55.905 --> 00:28:56.306]  Beautiful.
[00:28:56.306 --> 00:28:57.447]  You're an example of resistance.
[00:28:57.447 --> 00:28:58.448]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[00:28:59.193 --> 00:29:07.359]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:16.125]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[00:29:16.125 --> 00:29:17.226]  But when I'm not using it, I
[00:29:17.586 --> 00:29:18.047]  We're good to go.
[00:29:38.247 --> 00:29:48.413]  For $14.95 because I want you to get them and I want you to buy friends and family these systems to educate them about what these quote smartphones really are.
[00:29:48.413 --> 00:29:51.054]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use.
[00:29:51.054 --> 00:29:56.297]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.
[00:29:56.297 --> 00:30:02.280]  They're 50% off right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.922]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:28.561 --> 00:30:33.304]  We got a globulus boa constrictor wrapped around us.
[00:30:33.304 --> 00:30:37.406]  And it's going to squeeze hard and it's going to let off.
[00:30:37.406 --> 00:30:40.048]  And we're going to be tired, so we're going to kind of relax when it lets off.
[00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:40.888]  Then it's going to get us again.
[00:30:40.888 --> 00:30:49.293]  No, when it relaxes, like it just did for a few weeks, we got to struggle out of it right then, because the next lockdown's coming fast.
[00:30:49.293 --> 00:30:52.875]  Now, we're being assaulted.
[00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:54.015]  It's in the main literature.
[00:30:54.015 --> 00:30:54.756]  It's all coming out.
[00:30:54.756 --> 00:30:56.517]  I'm going to cover it next hour and take your calls.
[00:30:58.336 --> 00:31:02.221]  There's been a major debate, and listeners have asked me, and I've told you, I don't know.
[00:31:02.221 --> 00:31:04.384]  I will not lie to you consciously.
[00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:12.655]  I make mistakes sometimes, maybe 5% of the time, and I correct it immediately because truth is the antidote to evil and lies.
[00:31:12.655 --> 00:31:13.356]  But I remember
[00:31:15.129 --> 00:31:25.680]  Over 14, 15 months ago, some major medical firms came out around the world and said, we have sent off for a copy of the virus, the COVID, they won't give it to us.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.543]  And normally they'll give you anything so you're able to test and know.
[00:31:28.543 --> 00:31:30.926]  These are major diagnostic testing labs.
[00:31:32.034 --> 00:31:35.577]  In Europe, in India, in the US, in Australia, and places like that.
[00:31:35.577 --> 00:31:36.418]  We covered it.
[00:31:36.418 --> 00:31:45.325]  And they said, they're not giving us the virus, they're using a computer scan, not just PCR, but other fraudulent methods, PCR was part of it, to claim that it's there.
[00:31:46.673 --> 00:31:54.118]  And so Mike Adams, who's been 95% right like I have, I think about the same number a year plus ago, said, well, then why are they locking everything down if it isn't a real thing?
[00:31:54.118 --> 00:31:54.938]  And what are these deaths?
[00:31:54.938 --> 00:31:56.259]  Well, I think other things were going on.
[00:31:56.259 --> 00:31:58.601]  And now we know there are more deaths than last year.
[00:31:58.601 --> 00:32:02.783]  Even statistically, they're claiming it's COVID, but it's the vaccinated.
[00:32:02.783 --> 00:32:06.046]  95% in Israel in the hospital are dying.
[00:32:06.046 --> 00:32:08.027]  Injected.
[00:32:08.027 --> 00:32:08.527]  Australia is 20.
[00:32:08.527 --> 00:32:10.248]  3% have been inoculated.
[00:32:10.248 --> 00:32:11.709]  99% of those in the hospital are sick.
[00:32:14.713 --> 00:32:15.934]  Have been inoculated.
[00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:18.555]  So, we know it's the vaccine.
[00:32:18.555 --> 00:32:23.478]  It's not, quote, creating the Delta variant, though science shows it is creating some mutations.
[00:32:23.478 --> 00:32:31.764]  But then Mike owns a diagnostic lab, and so he doesn't want to eat crow here, but he actually said, I have apologized to David Icke, and I want to come on and talk about this.
[00:32:31.764 --> 00:32:34.966]  I've been trying to get him on other subjects for a week, he's been too busy.
[00:32:34.966 --> 00:32:39.869]  But he is here about this, he's written a huge lengthy treatise, better late than never,
[00:32:40.689 --> 00:32:43.430]  Which helps me understand because I wasn't sure.
[00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.631]  I just said something's going on.
[00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:45.511]  It's a globalist takeover.
[00:32:45.511 --> 00:32:46.912]  They said they use the fear.
[00:32:46.912 --> 00:32:51.074]  Well, now he's got it all right here and an index of what's really happening.
[00:32:51.074 --> 00:32:55.336]  So to decode this, is there a virus or isn't there a virus?
[00:32:55.336 --> 00:32:57.417]  And then why would they have bioweapon labs?
[00:32:57.417 --> 00:32:59.998]  And then, well, what is the chimeric thing they've created?
[00:32:59.998 --> 00:33:01.879]  And I think I've got the answer.
[00:33:01.879 --> 00:33:07.701]  But here to dissect this is NaturalNews.com head honcho and a good friend of mine, Mike Adams.
[00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:08.502]  Mike, tell us what you know.
[00:33:09.804 --> 00:33:10.024]  All right.
[00:33:10.024 --> 00:33:10.865]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:33:10.865 --> 00:33:15.588]  And yes, there is a cocktail of viruses.
[00:33:15.588 --> 00:33:24.534]  In fact, Dr. David Martin talked about the patents on some of these viruses owned by the CDC going back 20 years, 21 years.
[00:33:24.534 --> 00:33:26.916]  They've been working on various coronaviruses.
[00:33:26.916 --> 00:33:32.880]  But what we're dealing with today, it is not a novel COVID-19 isolated virus.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:47.635]  It is a renamed cocktail of other coronaviruses, some of which, Dr. Judy Majkovic explains, are monkey viruses that have been injected in flu shots and then flag as positive on the fraudulent PCR test.
[00:33:47.635 --> 00:33:51.839]  So I want to say, Alex, and thank you for that introduction, I was very reluctant
[00:33:52.532 --> 00:33:55.313]  To believe the depth of the scam.
[00:33:55.313 --> 00:33:59.534]  That all the PCR scientists could be covering this up.
[00:33:59.534 --> 00:34:03.055]  You know, that all the doctors could be involved in faking the deaths in the hospital.
[00:34:03.055 --> 00:34:04.856]  I was very resistant to that.
[00:34:04.856 --> 00:34:05.996]  I mean, I'm a scientist.
[00:34:05.996 --> 00:34:06.936]  I'm a published scientist.
[00:34:06.936 --> 00:34:07.677]  A patent holder.
[00:34:07.677 --> 00:34:08.857]  I own a lab.
[00:34:08.857 --> 00:34:11.298]  And I thought, surely they have isolated this virus.
[00:34:11.298 --> 00:34:13.118]  Surely they have sequenced it.
[00:34:13.118 --> 00:34:17.860]  And that's when I thought David Icke was, you know, off the reservation.
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:21.261]  Turns out, he was right about all of those points.
[00:34:22.052 --> 00:34:23.435]  And other people have been right about it.
[00:34:23.435 --> 00:34:24.657]  John Rappaport, for example.
[00:34:24.657 --> 00:34:25.077]  And others.
[00:34:25.077 --> 00:34:27.461]  Dr. Thomas Cowan.
[00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:28.463]  Dr. Andrew Kaufman.
[00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:30.707]  They were absolutely correct.
[00:34:30.707 --> 00:34:49.355]  And so, as a lab owner, I went out and tried to find a certified reference material, CRM, of an isolated COVID-19 virus nanoparticle, either in solution or in dry powder form, that had a known quantitation and that had been isolated from sick people.
[00:34:49.355 --> 00:34:53.917]  Alex, from what I can tell, I've been searching for it for weeks, it does not exist.
[00:34:53.917 --> 00:34:54.757]  It does not exist.
[00:34:55.157 --> 00:35:06.804]  There is no isolated COVID-19 virus, and all they're flagging in the PCR tests are other viral fragments, other genetic material from... And by the way, this is conclusive because you are a scientist.
[00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:16.309]  You went through and got better than anybody, better luck than ever, I say, done the best job of screenshotting it all, showing the admissions from their own documents that they're not isolating a virus.
[00:35:16.309 --> 00:35:21.392]  They're claiming an electronic digital signature, which again is completely inauthentic.
[00:35:22.381 --> 00:35:22.861]  Well, that's right.
[00:35:22.861 --> 00:35:36.093]  And what's key to understand here is when you run a lab and you run instruments, which I've done for many, many years, you know, thousands of hours, you have to have a physical standard of the material that you're testing against in order to calibrate your instruments.
[00:35:36.093 --> 00:35:46.662]  You know, if I'm testing for glyphosate, I have to have glyphosate so that I can test it, I can validate the method that I'm creating or using, and I can have a calibration curve for glyphosate.
[00:35:46.662 --> 00:35:47.883]  When it comes to PCR,
[00:35:48.543 --> 00:35:51.925]  They aren't using any physical standards because they don't exist.
[00:35:51.925 --> 00:35:54.406]  They're downloading digital libraries.
[00:35:54.406 --> 00:35:58.789]  And then they're basically amplifying what's called background instrument noise.
[00:35:59.494 --> 00:36:05.198]  Which is just to crank up the amplification to where almost anything can be flagged as positive.
[00:36:05.198 --> 00:36:08.861]  This is the cycle thresholds, the cycles of the PCR equipment.
[00:36:08.861 --> 00:36:12.844]  And Alex, the thing, I mean, I listened to your introduction and I'm with you on this.
[00:36:12.844 --> 00:36:16.027]  This is the mass murdering of humanity.
[00:36:16.027 --> 00:36:20.090]  And what's shocking to me, and this is why I was so reluctant to believe this, is that
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.722]  Most of mainstream science is in on it.
[00:36:23.722 --> 00:36:24.723]  They are complicit.
[00:36:24.723 --> 00:36:25.864]  The doctors are complicit.
[00:36:25.864 --> 00:36:27.806]  The lab analysts are complicit.
[00:36:27.806 --> 00:36:29.947]  The CDC authorities are complicit.
[00:36:29.947 --> 00:36:31.328]  This is mass murder.
[00:36:31.328 --> 00:36:38.454]  This is a vaccine holocaust of biological weapons and the scientific community has thrown out any standards.
[00:36:38.454 --> 00:36:39.194]  No morality.
[00:36:39.194 --> 00:36:40.215]  No ethics.
[00:36:40.215 --> 00:36:40.796]  Nothing.
[00:36:40.796 --> 00:36:43.037]  They've thrown out the institution of science.
[00:36:43.037 --> 00:36:46.820]  Science is dead from this day forward because of what they have done to this.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.742]  They have killed science and they've killed medicine.
[00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:50.966]  That's where we are.
[00:36:50.966 --> 00:36:51.727]  That's what we now realize.
[00:36:51.727 --> 00:36:52.307]  Absolutely.
[00:36:52.307 --> 00:37:01.735]  That's what freaks me out is that you've got all these real scientists and doctors and accredited, all the top people are saying what you're saying, and then you've got the big corporate leaders saying a totally different thing.
[00:37:01.735 --> 00:37:04.337]  So it's a paradox.
[00:37:04.337 --> 00:37:14.265]  Well, they're going for broke because they know if they succeed, they're going to kill off billions of human beings, they're going to depopulate the planet, and they won't have to answer for it because dead people don't protest.
[00:37:14.835 --> 00:37:16.816]  Dead people don't sue the vaccine companies.
[00:37:16.816 --> 00:37:17.956]  They're going for broke.
[00:37:17.956 --> 00:37:19.177]  It's all or nothing at this point.
[00:37:19.177 --> 00:37:24.359]  They don't care if they destroy whatever remaining shred of credibility the vaccine industry has.
[00:37:24.359 --> 00:37:25.339]  They're willing to do it all.
[00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:29.741]  And Alex, what's shocking to me is how many people are willing to go along with this.
[00:37:29.741 --> 00:37:32.462]  Where are the whistleblowers in the science labs?
[00:37:32.462 --> 00:37:34.663]  Where are the whistleblowers in the hospitals?
[00:37:34.663 --> 00:37:40.606]  Instead, they're taking money from the CDC to push out scripted tweets to say, oh, it's full of COVID patients.
[00:37:40.606 --> 00:37:41.406]  But Mike, that's the thing.
[00:37:41.406 --> 00:37:43.487]  They got us programmed to phones and TVs.
[00:37:44.567 --> 00:37:48.370]  In the last 60, 70 years, sitting around the TV, then the phone.
[00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:54.355]  And so people are used to taking directives like, I'm going to the store, I'm going to the movies, this phone tells me where there's food.
[00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:58.338]  So the medical profession gets a computer code, they believe it.
[00:37:58.338 --> 00:37:58.938]  You see what I mean?
[00:37:58.938 --> 00:38:00.059]  They're in a trance.
[00:38:00.059 --> 00:38:00.940]  We're going to wake them up.
[00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.543]  I don't think as many as you think are in on it.
[00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:05.764]  They're just following the script.
[00:38:07.076 --> 00:38:22.744]  Well, I know that most doctors work for large corporate entities that run the hospitals, and a lot of young doctors have, you know, 12 years of student debt, and if they say the wrong thing one time, they're kicked out of the system, and then they're bankrupt, so they're going along with the system.
[00:38:22.744 --> 00:38:26.686]  Unfortunately, we don't have decentralization of medicine anymore.
[00:38:26.686 --> 00:38:32.089]  It's all been centralized, also under Obamacare, and now you have fake President Biden
[00:38:32.549 --> 00:38:40.912]  Claiming that he wants to withhold federal money from hospitals and health care institutions if they don't achieve mass vaccination goals.
[00:38:40.912 --> 00:38:45.554]  I mean, that's an experimental shot.
[00:38:45.554 --> 00:38:48.415]  This is their big move, my friend.
[00:38:48.415 --> 00:38:52.797]  This is medical terrorism against the people of the world.
[00:38:52.797 --> 00:38:58.620]  These are assaults on humanity, and almost everyone is willing to go along with it, including the journo terrorists.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.221]  But if you get down to real science,
[00:39:02.836 --> 00:39:13.879]  You know, Christine Massey was doing FOIA requests with the CDC asking, do you have any samples of COVID that have been isolated and extracted and purified from sick patients?
[00:39:13.879 --> 00:39:17.340]  And Health and Human Services responded to that and said, no, we don't have.
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:18.500]  There's no documents on that.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.441]  We have no records of that ever happening.
[00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:22.561]  They don't have it.
[00:39:22.561 --> 00:39:25.482]  It is a total fraud, but the spike protein is real.
[00:39:25.482 --> 00:39:28.423]  That's what they built in the bioweapons factories, Alex.
[00:39:28.423 --> 00:39:29.803]  They built the spike protein
[00:39:30.501 --> 00:39:35.484]  So that it could target human tissue so they could put it in the vaccines and mass murder humanity.
[00:39:35.484 --> 00:39:39.947]  That's what's real and that's how they're perpetuating this now through the vaccines.
[00:39:39.947 --> 00:39:42.128]  Alright, stay there, stay there.
[00:39:42.128 --> 00:39:43.349]  Mike Adams, NaturalNews.com.
[00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:45.570]  I want to come back and ask from his deep research.
[00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:50.313]  How can people that are getting shed on, they now confirm it's shedding and getting people that didn't take the shot sick.
[00:39:50.313 --> 00:39:54.455]  How do folks that have taken the shot or those that are being shed on, is there anything to counter this?
[00:39:54.455 --> 00:39:55.476]  We'll talk about it straight ahead.
[00:39:57.768 --> 00:40:01.912]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[00:40:01.912 --> 00:40:06.035]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[00:40:06.035 --> 00:40:08.357]  All the tyranny we warned of is down here.
[00:40:08.357 --> 00:40:13.142]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[00:40:13.142 --> 00:40:16.865]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[00:40:17.265 --> 00:40:25.787]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.

[00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:43.576]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[00:41:43.576 --> 00:41:44.958]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 is the InfoWarsStore hotline.
[00:41:44.958 --> 00:41:46.079]  888-253-3139 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 That's InfoWarsStore.com

[00:42:14.671 --> 00:42:15.111]  It's an amazing deal.

[00:42:25.118 --> 00:42:30.782]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:33.324]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[00:42:33.324 --> 00:42:36.727]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[00:42:36.727 --> 00:42:38.568]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[00:42:38.568 --> 00:42:40.649]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[00:42:40.649 --> 00:42:43.972]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[00:42:44.392 --> 00:42:56.045]  Us getting the word out, with Alex's great show, Improv Wars, and you're supporting MyPillow, 2,500 employees, and I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be attacked and canceled.
[00:42:56.045 --> 00:42:56.345]  Beautiful.
[00:42:56.345 --> 00:42:57.487]  You're an example of resistance.
[00:42:57.487 --> 00:42:58.488]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[00:42:59.093 --> 00:43:06.616]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[00:43:06.616 --> 00:43:12.137]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[00:43:12.137 --> 00:43:19.700]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.461]  Humanity is strong.
[00:43:21.461 --> 00:43:22.421]  We're incredible.
[00:43:22.421 --> 00:43:26.204]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[00:43:26.204 --> 00:43:28.665]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[00:43:28.665 --> 00:43:34.929]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[00:43:34.929 --> 00:43:44.334]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[00:43:44.674 --> 00:43:46.976]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:46.976 --> 00:43:49.418]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[00:43:49.418 --> 00:43:54.962]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, bazzo beats, and others.
[00:43:54.962 --> 00:44:01.827]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[00:44:01.827 --> 00:44:04.489]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:16.837 --> 00:44:22.282]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:44:22.282 --> 00:44:35.133]  Mike Adams will be hosting two hours of the broadcast on Thursday because I'm going to be on the ground live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota at the big cyber election fraud symposium.
[00:44:35.133 --> 00:44:38.776]  I'll be there for day two and day three.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.523]  On Wednesday and Thursday of that event.
[00:44:43.523 --> 00:44:47.487]  And I'll be popping into the show with Owen Schroyer and Mike Adams as well.
[00:44:47.487 --> 00:44:50.009]  But Mike, NationalNews.com is going to be there.
[00:44:50.009 --> 00:44:54.393]  There's something I need to say at the start of the next hour that's not about saying how powerful InfoWars is.
[00:44:54.393 --> 00:44:54.913]  It's the opposite.
[00:44:54.913 --> 00:44:57.755]  It's very dangerous in a war like this to be in the sight, guys.
[00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:01.843]  They've got all my phones tapped, they already know this.
[00:45:01.843 --> 00:45:02.744]  It's not Putin.
[00:45:02.744 --> 00:45:07.850]  But foreign leaders call up and say, you're really the thought leader, we appreciate you.
[00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.432]  Whether it could be from Asia to Eastern Europe.
[00:45:12.266 --> 00:45:15.470]  All the big talk show hosts, you see, they're super awake right now.
[00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:16.451]  I talk to all the time.
[00:45:16.451 --> 00:45:17.993]  The enemy already knows that.
[00:45:17.993 --> 00:45:19.655]  And we confer and have notes and everything.
[00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:21.397]  And it's not that they follow what I say.
[00:45:21.397 --> 00:45:22.779]  They've now woken up that I'm right.
[00:45:22.779 --> 00:45:24.461]  And now they're as smart as I am.
[00:45:24.461 --> 00:45:25.903]  They're off and running.
[00:45:25.903 --> 00:45:27.004]  And it's a debate, too.
[00:45:27.004 --> 00:45:27.845]  Like, well, is this right?
[00:45:27.845 --> 00:45:28.306]  Or is this right?
[00:45:28.306 --> 00:45:29.167]  You know, we're figuring it out.
[00:45:29.167 --> 00:45:30.568]  The thing is, we're not trying to lie to you.
[00:45:32.082 --> 00:45:41.231]  I can tell you, you could not support a more important place than InfoWars, and InfoWarsTore.com, and the books, and the films, and the t-shirts, and all of it, or NaturalNews.com.
[00:45:41.231 --> 00:45:49.099]  Mike Adams does invaluable work out there as well, and I've got to tell you, we need to be in a position in the future
[00:45:50.382 --> 00:45:54.743]  And I'm not going to give out to the enemy what we're doing, because a lot of this has not even been talked about on the telephone.
[00:45:54.743 --> 00:45:55.323]  It's all legal.
[00:45:55.323 --> 00:45:56.403]  It's all lawful.
[00:45:56.403 --> 00:46:02.065]  But we've got things ready to pop up during the shutdown that we intend to probably only run for a week or less.
[00:46:02.065 --> 00:46:11.507]  And we know that once the internet kill switch goes in, and once the real martial law happens, and we can't back it off and stop it, then transmissions will be more valuable than ever.
[00:46:11.507 --> 00:46:14.968]  So you'll think, well, what is one transmission getting out do?
[00:46:14.968 --> 00:46:16.728]  Well, in a shutdown level like that,
[00:46:18.228 --> 00:46:18.868]  It's everything.
[00:46:18.868 --> 00:46:20.530]  So we've studied how they operate.
[00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.971]  We've got backup plans.
[00:46:21.971 --> 00:46:24.072]  It's got my hair gray.
[00:46:24.072 --> 00:46:28.135]  And believe me, I worked all weekend, 12, 14 hours a day on this.
[00:46:28.135 --> 00:46:30.176]  We are not going to fight this thing to lose it.
[00:46:30.176 --> 00:46:31.777]  We're fighting this to win it.
[00:46:31.777 --> 00:46:37.201]  And as everything we said comes true, our credibility, your credibility, everyone around you is going to rise.
[00:46:37.201 --> 00:46:40.343]  So tell everybody, see, I told you, I'm not trying to grandstand.
[00:46:40.343 --> 00:46:42.624]  I want us to get out of this together.
[00:46:42.624 --> 00:46:44.365]  Listen to me and be a leader.
[00:46:44.365 --> 00:46:45.886]  Mike, I want to get back into the huge
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:47:00.787]  Power grab, we're witnessing the forced inoculation, the digital IDs, even Rand Paul saying this is war against humanity by power hungry monsters, the new stimulus bill puts cameras in your car that watch you at all times and arrests you if you criticize the CDC.
[00:47:02.708 --> 00:47:04.390]  Everything we said is here.
[00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:09.477]  What is that paradox like of the incredible credibility we've got while we're being censored?
[00:47:09.477 --> 00:47:14.343]  And how do we use that and get others to use that while we're still relatively free?
[00:47:14.343 --> 00:47:16.847]  And we think of censorship as being really bad right now.
[00:47:16.847 --> 00:47:20.732]  I don't think people understand the level of technology they've got for internet kill switch.
[00:47:22.008 --> 00:47:27.311]  Well, I think it shows the desperation of the controllers because they're being exposed each and every day.
[00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:34.736]  I mean, look at what Senator Rand Paul just said last week, I think, on Friday, that humanity essentially needs to peacefully rise up and resist this.
[00:47:34.736 --> 00:47:36.777]  They can't throw us all in jail.
[00:47:36.777 --> 00:47:50.266]  You know, I think Senator Paul, although he hasn't stated this openly, I think he realizes exactly what we're saying, which is that this is a war of extermination against humanity with the sub-goal of destroying the sovereign United States of America
[00:47:53.948 --> 00:48:00.131]  I believe that Senator Paul knows that, although he could never say that.
[00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:18.702]  But because of him and Congressman Mark Green and many others who are waking up, the desperation is pushing the acceleration of the globalists who now know they have to go for broke because if this all unravels and it blows up in their face, they're going to prison for crimes against humanity.
[00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.263]  That's where this ends.
[00:48:20.263 --> 00:48:31.073]  So we are now in a race against time where they are racing to mass murder billions of people and we, humanity, we are racing to expose the criminals before they kill us all.
[00:48:31.073 --> 00:48:34.396]  I mean, can you think of a more epic, more biblical
[00:48:35.347 --> 00:48:39.109]  Face-off in the history of human civilization, but that's what this is.
[00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:43.430]  It's the most epic face-off ever, and then the backdrop of Obama.
[00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:44.271]  I looked at the videos.
[00:48:44.271 --> 00:48:44.831]  It's more than 700.
[00:48:44.831 --> 00:48:47.072]  It's thousands out there.
[00:48:47.072 --> 00:48:48.212]  None of them are vaccinated.
[00:48:48.212 --> 00:48:54.535]  None of them are wearing masks, which they shouldn't, but then saying Sturgis should be shut down, but Obama can have his party.
[00:48:54.535 --> 00:48:54.975]  It's just...
[00:48:55.715 --> 00:49:00.022]  And then CNN had a reporter on that said, well they're sophisticated so they're allowed to.
[00:49:00.022 --> 00:49:01.965]  So they're now back to Marie Antoinette.
[00:49:01.965 --> 00:49:03.547]  Let them eat cake.
[00:49:03.547 --> 00:49:05.751]  Let the starving masses eat cake while they party.
[00:49:05.751 --> 00:49:07.794]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:49:07.794 --> 00:49:08.395]  It's frightening.
[00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:22.065]  Well yeah, and I want to say this is the extension, and you've covered this, about the abortion organ harvesting horrors that really came out last week that confirmed much of what you have been reporting for years.
[00:49:22.065 --> 00:49:29.229]  I want to understand, I want the listeners to understand that that is a microcosm of what they're planning to do to everyone.
[00:49:29.229 --> 00:49:34.071]  That your body is nothing but a vessel for their harvesting of profits.
[00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:34.731]  And remember,
[00:49:35.251 --> 00:49:49.375]  That not only are they going to take your biology and kill you with this biological weapon that they developed, but they're also planning a global financial reset to take any asset, any denomination of value that you may have earned.
[00:49:49.375 --> 00:49:59.197]  You know, with your sweat and tears year after year toiling away to save a little bit of money, they're going to take that too because the fiat currency collapse is being timed
[00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:06.383]  With COVID as a cover story so they can loot and steal everything from everybody.
[00:50:06.383 --> 00:50:16.971]  So they're gonna, just like what they do to babies, they're gonna kill you, they're gonna destroy your organs, they're gonna do it for profit, they're gonna take everything from you, and they respect absolutely no human rights.
[00:50:16.971 --> 00:50:20.775]  And yes, Satanism is behind the entire thing.
[00:50:20.775 --> 00:50:23.897]  That Obama party was a celebration of Lucifer.
[00:50:23.897 --> 00:50:24.578]  That's what that was.
[00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:29.326]  In fact, I've watched a bunch of the footage that leaked out that Obama wanted deleted.
[00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:36.309]  I mean, it's like women doing weird snake dances, sticking their tongues out, and they're all worshipping Obama.
[00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:38.630]  And meanwhile, they're murdering Africa.
[00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:40.050]  That's one of their main targets.
[00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:46.992]  And you've got this weird event with Stephen Colbert and, you know, all these Hollywood stars, but then there were some black people actually there.
[00:50:46.992 --> 00:50:50.174]  Do they realize this is all a sick joke?
[00:50:50.174 --> 00:50:51.154]  Well, remember that
[00:50:51.917 --> 00:50:58.124]  Black Americans, only about one out of four have agreed to take even a single vaccine shot at this point.
[00:50:58.124 --> 00:51:03.790]  Three out of four black Americans, and that's more than any other ethnic group in the country, are rejecting the vaccine.
[00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:04.771]  Why is that?
[00:51:04.771 --> 00:51:08.495]  And I think the answer is because black Americans are wise to what's going on.
[00:51:08.595 --> 00:51:17.197]  I was about to say, that tells me black people aren't as dumb as the globalists think they are, because they've got a history of being injected with crap with an experimental shot, absolutely.
[00:51:17.197 --> 00:51:21.258]  So it looks like they're not listening to Run-DMC, which you wrote an article about at Natural News.
[00:51:21.258 --> 00:51:27.860]  This is real racism then to say, you can't fly, you can't live, you can't go anywhere, and the majority of it is black people.
[00:51:28.891 --> 00:51:36.595]  Well, yeah, the CDC is trying to pay off black influencers like Hank Aaron, the baseball legend, and they're killing them.
[00:51:36.595 --> 00:51:38.816]  You know, I believe Hank Aaron died from the vaccine.
[00:51:38.816 --> 00:51:41.397]  DMX, the rapper, died from the vaccine, I believe.
[00:51:41.397 --> 00:51:42.218]  It's very clear.
[00:51:42.218 --> 00:51:44.419]  Heart attack induced by the vaccine.
[00:51:44.419 --> 00:51:57.345]  And frankly, black Americans, I believe, have a lot of street smarts, a lot of wisdom that is multi-generational wisdom about how they've been hunted down and exterminated through the abortion industry and the cancer industry.
[00:51:57.805 --> 00:52:01.429]  Now the vaccine industry, and think about it Alex, the vaccine passports.
[00:52:01.429 --> 00:52:02.450]  What are that?
[00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:03.251]  What is that?
[00:52:03.251 --> 00:52:12.480]  That's the reintroduction of segregation where you're not allowed to ride the bus, you're not allowed to eat at the cafe because of who you are.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.264]  It's like they're putting a sign in the window and saying your people are not welcomed here.
[00:52:16.804 --> 00:52:18.825]  And you ask, what do you mean, you people?
[00:52:18.825 --> 00:52:19.625]  What are you talking about?
[00:52:19.625 --> 00:52:24.688]  Yeah, it's the unvaccinated, which is, and black Americans are the largest unvaccinated group.
[00:52:24.688 --> 00:52:30.871]  This is blatant racism, segregation, and race-based extermination attempts in the United States.
[00:52:30.871 --> 00:52:33.992]  If anybody should be angry about this, it should be black Americans.
[00:52:33.992 --> 00:52:40.376]  And I know many of them are, but why are these white liberals just raising their hand and say, inject me, inject me, inject me.
[00:52:40.376 --> 00:52:41.096]  I love authority.
[00:52:41.096 --> 00:52:42.837]  I love vaccine suicide.
[00:52:42.837 --> 00:52:45.158]  That's who's signing up and saying, kill me.
[00:52:45.538 --> 00:52:45.958]  It's incredible.
[00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:50.681]  Well, Mike, you're going to be hosting for two hours, coming up on Thursday, but I can't wait to ask these questions.
[00:52:50.681 --> 00:52:51.642]  We'll do five more minutes with us.
[00:52:51.642 --> 00:53:06.531]  I know you've got to go, and then I'm going to open the phones up and cover all the news, but just getting started right here, what do you make of the main German doctors' union coming out and saying, 30 to 40 percent of the dead that we do autopsies on, we believe the vaccine killed them?
[00:53:06.531 --> 00:53:08.032]  That's in major German papers.
[00:53:08.032 --> 00:53:10.374]  I mean, the wheels are coming off this thing.
[00:53:11.445 --> 00:53:18.807]  They won't be able to cover it up forever because of the physical evidence from the autopsies, from the deaths, and you know people who've been killed by the vaccine.
[00:53:18.807 --> 00:53:19.707]  I do too.
[00:53:19.707 --> 00:53:23.608]  I know there are people in my company whose parents are dead because of the vaccine.
[00:53:23.608 --> 00:53:28.390]  I mean, I know firsthand people who are dead from this, and I think most of your listeners have a similar experience.
[00:53:28.390 --> 00:53:29.790]  They know someone who's died from it.
[00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:37.232]  They can't cover it up forever, hence the acceleration, the rush to mass inject and mass murder as many people as possible before the truth comes out.
[00:53:37.653 --> 00:53:41.523]  So, yeah, I'm going to cover more of this Thursday on your show with Owen Schroyer.
[00:53:41.523 --> 00:53:46.135]  I think I'm hosting the third and fourth hour that day, and we'll cover a lot of detail at that time.
[00:53:47.297 --> 00:53:54.180]  Five more minutes, because I've asked a lot of questions, but I want to know what else is on Mike Adams' radar when we come back in two minutes, NaturalNews.com.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:54:10.347]  Invaluable article he wrote, bombshell, HHS documents admit CDC has never isolated any COVID-19 virus, all PCR tests, nothing but instrument noise, which the inventor said years ago that he mysteriously died, short of COVID, and then now the FDA did come out.
[00:54:11.232 --> 00:54:12.693]  And say it's a fraudulent test.
[00:54:12.693 --> 00:54:18.975]  The whole thing, based on a lie, now they've got new computer tests that are basically the same thing, doing the same fraud.
[00:54:18.975 --> 00:54:22.176]  I'm having the whole article posted at InfoWars.com.
[00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:23.556]  I hope you share it.
[00:54:23.556 --> 00:54:25.157]  It's very well done.
[00:54:25.157 --> 00:54:27.678]  All right, hour number two.
[00:54:27.678 --> 00:54:30.519]  Straight ahead with myself, Mike Adams, one more segment.
[00:54:30.519 --> 00:54:34.920]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.082]  And when you're on NewsWars.com or Bandop Video, remember,
[00:54:40.342 --> 00:54:42.563]  Share all those articles.
[00:54:42.563 --> 00:54:43.864]  That's how we reach new people.
[00:54:43.864 --> 00:54:44.004]  Stay
[00:55:03.857 --> 00:55:08.218]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[00:55:08.218 --> 00:55:13.759]  You can get my Keys and Dream Sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[00:55:13.759 --> 00:55:19.421]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[00:55:19.421 --> 00:55:21.941]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[00:55:21.941 --> 00:55:25.342]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[00:55:25.342 --> 00:55:27.363]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[00:55:27.363 --> 00:55:29.263]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[00:55:29.263 --> 00:55:32.584]  Your best special is using the promo code ALEX and you're supporting
[00:55:33.044 --> 00:55:44.149]  Us getting the word out, with Alex's great show and for worse, and you're supporting my pillow, 2,500 employees, and I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attack.
[00:55:44.149 --> 00:55:44.969]  Beautiful.
[00:55:44.969 --> 00:55:46.130]  You're an example of resistance.
[00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:48.791]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[00:55:48.791 --> 00:55:49.491]  The best product.
[00:55:49.491 --> 00:55:54.053]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[00:55:54.053 --> 00:55:55.394]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[00:55:56.769 --> 00:55:58.471]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[00:55:58.471 --> 00:56:00.153]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[00:56:00.153 --> 00:56:01.094]  That was a crazy week.
[00:56:01.094 --> 00:56:12.789]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:14.091]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:15.860]  I think?
[00:56:37.412 --> 00:56:38.612]  I want to take control of my life.
[00:56:38.612 --> 00:56:39.753]  I want to take control of my health.
[00:56:39.753 --> 00:56:43.654]  And that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[00:56:43.654 --> 00:56:44.815]  Don't buy into the groupthink.
[00:56:44.815 --> 00:56:45.815]  Don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[00:56:45.815 --> 00:56:46.955]  Drink the TurboForce.
[00:56:46.955 --> 00:56:51.797]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[00:56:51.797 --> 00:56:54.398]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:06.032 --> 00:57:07.654]  Alright, final segment with Mike Adams.
[00:57:07.654 --> 00:57:09.817]  I want him to be able to cover anything else he hasn't gotten to.
[00:57:09.817 --> 00:57:14.704]  Just briefly, Yelp removes reviews critical of vaccine mandates.
[00:57:14.704 --> 00:57:17.788]  It's the censorship, the big tech straitjacket.
[00:57:17.788 --> 00:57:20.171]  See nothing, hear nothing, smell nothing, taste nothing.
[00:57:21.072 --> 00:57:23.093]  I mean, that's really the proof of the criminal activity.
[00:57:23.093 --> 00:57:30.558]  Suppressing the incredibly successful treatments, sending sick people into nursing homes to get high death rates.
[00:57:30.558 --> 00:57:36.322]  I mean, this just puts icing on the cake of how premeditated this whole global corporate takeover's been.
[00:57:36.322 --> 00:57:39.524]  Mike Adams, what else is on Natural News Radar?
[00:57:39.524 --> 00:57:44.227]  Well, in retrospect, looking back at last year, something very important has come to light.
[00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:46.929]  Remember the big outbreak in Northern Italy?
[00:57:46.929 --> 00:57:50.872]  And this was the one that was very convincing to many of us in the scientific community.
[00:57:51.497 --> 00:57:54.479]  That this was a very real, very dangerous thing.
[00:57:54.479 --> 00:57:58.402]  Followed by New York City, the big outbreak that peaked in about mid-April 2020.
[00:57:59.913 --> 00:58:07.198]  I now believe, based on interviews with many, many experts, that those were not viral outbreaks.
[00:58:07.198 --> 00:58:13.882]  They were toxic nanoparticles, spike protein attacks, kind of like anthrax attacks.
[00:58:13.882 --> 00:58:27.271]  I think that those, New York City and Northern Italy and perhaps regions of China, were actually hit with spike protein nanoparticle attacks, where the cities were basically bombarded with spike protein to create the symptoms
[00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:32.754]  To create the the fear that there was a viral pandemic taking place.
[00:58:32.754 --> 00:58:42.639]  But if it had really been a viral pandemic, we should have seen the same pattern of New York City happening in Chicago, in Miami, in Denver, you know, in Seattle, Los Angeles and so on.
[00:58:42.639 --> 00:58:48.822]  And we did not see that because the virus and this is this is why this process, Alex, it was so difficult.
[00:58:49.202 --> 00:58:58.804]  For many of us to sort out, and this is why, you know, your guests and even your hosts often disagreed and everybody was trying to find the right answer, even to this day, trying to find the answer of what's going on.
[00:58:58.804 --> 00:59:07.647]  Well, yeah, that's when you know it's freedom, is when you're getting a lot of different ideas and answers and then things evolve over time as you get the right answer, not one official story that then suddenly flips and then flips again.
[00:59:07.647 --> 00:59:12.708]  And exactly, for those that don't know, they studied anthrax heavily because it's such an ancient, like, plant spore that you can't kill it.
[00:59:13.348 --> 00:59:21.622]  And it's a great bioweapon, but they studied spongiform encephalopathy and found they can create protein crystals that, injected into the body, will grow.
[00:59:21.622 --> 00:59:26.129]  This is just a new thing they're doing, and clearly this is their big rollout against us.
[00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:27.957]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:59:27.957 --> 00:59:35.003]  And once you understand all of this, you realize that they went to such incredible lengths to stage this pandemic.
[00:59:35.003 --> 00:59:37.765]  I mean, to fake so many elements of it.
[00:59:37.765 --> 00:59:41.689]  Even for Cuomo to kill people with ventilators in order to spike up the numbers.
[00:59:41.689 --> 00:59:45.672]  To rig the hospitals being full in city after city after city.
[00:59:45.672 --> 00:59:48.975]  Paying off the doctors to tweet out scripted
[00:59:49.255 --> 00:59:50.756]  Fake claim that ICUs were full.
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.681]  Right, so this is the ultimate false flag.
[01:00:02.681 --> 01:00:07.383]  This is the largest theatrical staged event in human history.
[01:00:07.383 --> 01:00:09.584]  The entire world is the stage.
[01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:13.586]  It doesn't mean that there's not real danger from the spike protein, because there is.
[01:00:13.586 --> 01:00:20.669]  And it doesn't mean there's not real danger from common cold viruses, because people have been locked up and they're sunlight deficient and they're vitamin D deficient.
[01:00:20.669 --> 01:00:27.652]  So yeah, you can get sick and you can have symptoms from regular viruses, coronaviruses, that have been circulating for decades.
[01:00:28.252 --> 01:00:29.013]  There are risks out there.
[01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:30.594]  And you alluded to it earlier.
[01:00:30.594 --> 01:00:32.535]  That's what I've been reading and studying.
[01:00:32.535 --> 01:00:39.819]  Just like Fauci famously in vaccines put the HIV in in the 70s to get the vector with the gay community in New York and San Francisco.
[01:00:39.819 --> 01:00:40.820]  You pointed it out.
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:43.021]  They could put spike protein in a flu shot.
[01:00:43.021 --> 01:00:44.202]  They could put it in a tetanus shot.
[01:00:44.202 --> 01:00:45.623]  They could put it in an MMR.
[01:00:45.623 --> 01:00:52.407]  And then that's how they were incubating it in Italy and New York just like they incubated New York before to then show those higher death rates and create the fear.
[01:00:53.544 --> 01:00:54.065]  That's right.
[01:00:54.065 --> 01:01:01.272]  Well, I think they actually just mass-manufactured the nanoparticles and put it into an aerosolized attack on the city.
[01:01:01.272 --> 01:01:02.132]  I think that's what they did.
[01:01:02.132 --> 01:01:02.613]  Drones?
[01:01:02.613 --> 01:01:03.534]  In retrospect.
[01:01:03.534 --> 01:01:03.794]  Drones?
[01:01:03.794 --> 01:01:05.095]  Yeah, drone attacks.
[01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:17.347]  But at the time, we couldn't have known that, so that's why we have to look back and reassess what, based on the information we now know, we now know this is a giant global fraud designed to exterminate humanity.
[01:01:17.347 --> 01:01:18.148]  That's where we are today.
[01:01:18.308 --> 01:01:22.033]  By the way, Mike, you're one of the smartest guys I know and you always take your time to come to a conclusion.
[01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:23.174]  I agree with you.
[01:01:23.174 --> 01:01:25.617]  I can't wait till Thursday when you host the last two hours.
[01:01:25.617 --> 01:01:30.983]  I'm sure you'll get into kind of the pedigree of this to understand the future and what they're going to hit us with next.
[01:01:30.983 --> 01:01:35.168]  So please humor me and on Thursday get into what you think they're coming up next with.
[01:01:35.168 --> 01:01:35.969]  Naturalnews.com.
[01:01:35.969 --> 01:01:36.430]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:37.230]  We'll do.
[01:01:37.230 --> 01:01:37.770]  Thank you.
[01:01:37.770 --> 01:01:38.190]  Wow.
[01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:38.951]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:40.111]  Yeah, it was key.
[01:01:40.111 --> 01:01:45.572]  I just said they're clearly trying people in a few key areas to get the hysteria, to get the doctors to say, no, no, this is real.
[01:01:45.572 --> 01:01:48.233]  And which they've done before.
[01:01:48.233 --> 01:01:50.673]  Fauci and others were trained by the folks that ran Tuskegee.
[01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:54.454]  I mean, Fauci injects dogs with maggots to watch them die.
[01:01:54.454 --> 01:01:56.394]  If you're a new listener, I swear that's true.
[01:01:56.394 --> 01:01:57.155]  It sounds insane.
[01:01:57.155 --> 01:01:57.955]  It is insane.
[01:01:57.955 --> 01:01:58.275]  That's real.
[01:01:58.955 --> 01:02:14.027]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans, and with promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[01:02:14.027 --> 01:02:14.627]  It's an amazing deal.
[01:02:14.667 --> 01:02:15.287]  Amazing deal!
[01:02:15.287 --> 01:02:18.949]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[01:02:18.949 --> 01:02:24.811]  You can get my Geeds and Dream Sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[01:02:24.811 --> 01:02:30.473]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[01:02:30.473 --> 01:02:33.015]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:36.416]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[01:02:36.416 --> 01:02:38.417]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:40.338]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[01:02:40.338 --> 01:02:43.659]  Your best special is using the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[01:02:44.019 --> 01:02:44.840]  The Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.622]  Because there is a war on.
[01:02:46.622 --> 01:02:47.343]  For your mind.
[01:03:16.021 --> 01:03:21.442]  You know, I've been reading the news since I was five years old, so about 42 years.
[01:03:21.442 --> 01:03:25.503]  One blessing I've had has been a good reader, good mind, good memory.
[01:03:25.503 --> 01:03:34.784]  And I remember growing up, you'd hear about insane Florida dentists injected over a thousand people with HIV and hepatitis, killing several hundred.
[01:03:34.784 --> 01:03:38.525]  And you're like, why would they do that?
[01:03:38.525 --> 01:03:43.566]  Or you'll hear about San Antonio nurse knowingly killed more than 50 newborn babies.
[01:03:44.528 --> 01:03:48.072]  Injecting poison into them and you just go, why would they do that?
[01:03:48.072 --> 01:03:56.821]  Or you watch 60 Minutes and it's like, these Dallas and Chicago hospitals killed healthy people for their organs.
[01:03:56.821 --> 01:04:00.905]  And back in the day the media would report on stuff like that.
[01:04:00.905 --> 01:04:03.488]  Because back then it was somewhat freer and it just wanted a big story.
[01:04:04.741 --> 01:04:05.161]  I don't know.
[01:04:25.683 --> 01:04:40.771]  On keeping babies alive and torturing them and scalping them and putting their hair on rats and injecting puppy dogs, beagles with South American burrowing maggot flies that are more painful than you can imagine.
[01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:44.513]  These are maggots that eat live flesh, screw worms.
[01:04:46.121 --> 01:04:50.405]  That were in North America, but they had a giant eradication program for the screw worm.
[01:04:50.405 --> 01:04:54.469]  And by the time my dad was a teenager with our ranch, they weren't eating the cows.
[01:04:54.469 --> 01:05:00.675]  And they used to have worms that would lay eggs, and then the worm eats live flesh.
[01:05:00.675 --> 01:05:03.158]  A regular maggot just eats dead flesh.
[01:05:03.158 --> 01:05:10.105]  Fauci injected dogs with live maggots.
[01:05:11.889 --> 01:05:19.916]  To then watch them in excruciating pain and then drain their blood off and try to figure out how to infect humans with worms.
[01:05:19.916 --> 01:05:24.140]  He's a nice person.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:38.233]  So, you gotta come to grips with the fact that there's regular doctors that are in their schools and their systems and there's elite doctors and almost all of them get trained in eugenics and depopulation and that they are God and that they are in control.
[01:05:39.758 --> 01:05:47.101]  And you can go down the line of John P. Haldren and Paul Ehrlich and all the top people that have run these federal agencies.
[01:05:47.101 --> 01:05:53.404]  And man, they all write books about world government, getting rid of the family, and getting rid of humanity.
[01:05:53.404 --> 01:05:54.445]  And I've shown you those books.
[01:05:54.445 --> 01:05:56.626]  I've got one right here in front of me on the table.
[01:05:58.194 --> 01:06:01.578]  So I know what I say sounds insane.
[01:06:01.578 --> 01:06:05.242]  I know what I cover sounds crazy because you're not like that.
[01:06:05.242 --> 01:06:12.269]  You don't want to get a laboratory full of dogs and inject them with maggots till the maggots eat them alive and kill them.
[01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:16.734]  And they're begging and pleading and they chain them up so they can't even dig the maggots out of their own flesh.
[01:06:17.639 --> 01:06:22.042]  But somebody like Fauci sees maggots crawling under the skin and pus pouring out of a dog.
[01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:23.363]  It's beautiful.
[01:06:23.363 --> 01:06:25.204]  That's his power over something innocent.
[01:06:25.204 --> 01:06:27.825]  That's his power to hurt something.
[01:06:27.825 --> 01:06:31.407]  To him, that's like a beautiful musical instrument.
[01:06:31.407 --> 01:06:33.689]  Torturing a puppy to death.
[01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:36.571]  And you've just got to come to realization.
[01:06:36.571 --> 01:06:38.072]  What's like a puppy?
[01:06:38.072 --> 01:06:40.073]  A baby?
[01:06:40.073 --> 01:06:44.856]  And he kept those babies alive and he scalped them and he merged them with rats and he did it all.
[01:06:45.799 --> 01:06:48.861]  Because it was an abomination before God.
[01:06:48.861 --> 01:06:59.809]  Because you don't move up the satanic hierarchy with these globalists unless you are molesting children, or killing innocent people, or just doing wholesale evil on a mass scale.
[01:06:59.809 --> 01:07:05.693]  That's how you put gas in the tank of Satan's engine.
[01:07:05.693 --> 01:07:10.456]  And again, Hollywood knows this, the globalists know this.
[01:07:10.456 --> 01:07:12.638]  Star Wars is cheesy, but it's full of allegories.
[01:07:12.638 --> 01:07:13.719]  And you've got episode three,
[01:07:15.282 --> 01:07:33.434]  Where Emperor Palpatine is just becoming Emperor, and Luke Skywalker is becoming Darth Vader, and he says, you need to go to the Jedi Temple and kill all the children, only then will you be powerful enough in the dark side to kill Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:07:33.434 --> 01:07:36.316]  Your friend, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:07:36.316 --> 01:07:42.960]  You gotta go kill hundreds of children, and then you will be powerful enough in the dark side.
[01:07:46.786 --> 01:07:51.970]  The NKVD, the GRU, for a decade had gone all over Russia.
[01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:53.831]  They killed 20% of the population.
[01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:58.915]  And they would come back to Lenin and they'd say, Sir, no one is resisting.
[01:07:58.915 --> 01:08:00.576]  They're giving us their wives.
[01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:01.357]  They've handed everything over.
[01:08:01.357 --> 01:08:03.218]  They work 20 hours a day.
[01:08:03.218 --> 01:08:04.659]  There's no one left to kill.
[01:08:04.659 --> 01:08:05.840]  Everyone is submitted.
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.884]  And Lenin would throw fits and say, You will be sent to the gulag unless you kill more.
[01:08:10.884 --> 01:08:13.546]  I want more blood.
[01:08:13.546 --> 01:08:15.187]  And then he would flop around on the ground and go,
[01:08:17.332 --> 01:08:18.213]  And they had an island.
[01:08:18.213 --> 01:08:20.235]  You ever seen that Clint Eastwood movie?
[01:08:20.235 --> 01:08:20.815]  I forget the name.
[01:08:20.815 --> 01:08:22.417]  It's one with Jeff Bridges.
[01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:23.978]  Made back in the 70s.
[01:08:23.978 --> 01:08:28.963]  Where there's a crazy guy on the side of the road with a truckload, a carload of white rabbits.
[01:08:28.963 --> 01:08:31.826]  And he's chasing them around, shooting them with a shotgun.
[01:08:31.826 --> 01:08:33.487]  And Clint Eastwood knocks the guy out.
[01:08:33.487 --> 01:08:34.748]  Where do you think that came from?
[01:08:34.748 --> 01:08:41.435]  And the people that wrote... What's the Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges movie?
[01:08:41.435 --> 01:08:42.656]  It's Lightfoot and something.
[01:08:45.262 --> 01:08:46.503]  Thunderbolt and Lightfoot.
[01:08:46.503 --> 01:08:48.445]  That's what Lennon would do.
[01:08:48.445 --> 01:08:50.126]  That's in mainline history books.
[01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:58.033]  He had a private island that he would go to that had like little puppy dogs and rabbits.
[01:08:58.033 --> 01:09:01.937]  And he would rip their heads off and bite them and kill them and flop around.
[01:09:01.937 --> 01:09:08.042]  I mean, what kind of person do you think does this?
[01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:08.683]  These people.
[01:09:12.383 --> 01:09:13.884]  They don't want to kill a rabbit to eat it.
[01:09:13.884 --> 01:09:15.646]  They don't want to kill a rabbit for sport and eat it.
[01:09:15.646 --> 01:09:21.651]  No, it's about the fact that they're innocent and they control it and they've got it all there.
[01:09:21.651 --> 01:09:28.776]  So, that's where this, and Fauci wants to not inject a dog with maggots and watch him in a cage die.
[01:09:28.776 --> 01:09:34.261]  He'd love to have your child in a cage, but you know what he can get away with?
[01:09:34.261 --> 01:09:39.165]  Injecting them with something far worse than flesh eating maggots.
[01:09:41.189 --> 01:10:04.505]  He'll inject you with mad cow disease in a vaccine and make your body produce mad cow disease that's gonna eat your brain, your heart, your lungs, your liver, your kidneys, your testicles, your uterus, all of the really active parts of your body.
[01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:07.367]  And he's gonna give that to you and he's gonna kill you
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:14.945]  And you're not gonna have the will or the nerve to admit he's done that to you.
[01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:27.416]  When again, all the literature is you can't make a vaccine for a coronavirus because it'll cause autoimmune responses to other ones, it'll cause the antibody problems, it will cause the blood clots, your body attacking itself.
[01:10:27.416 --> 01:10:34.162]  And now it's happened, and now he sits there up on TV, we'll cover it next segment, and says you shouldn't be able to leave your house
[01:10:35.546 --> 01:10:36.867]  Unless you've had this shot.
[01:10:36.867 --> 01:10:43.830]  And Sturgis shouldn't have a motorcycle rally, but Black Lives Matter can, and Obama can, and the Democrats can, and Antifa can.
[01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:48.712]  And then I've got footage of Antifa in Portland.
[01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:53.434]  They beat up some churchgoers a few months ago at a park.
[01:10:53.434 --> 01:10:56.875]  So tens of thousands of Christians showed up peacefully for a prayer rally.
[01:10:56.875 --> 01:11:01.097]  They attacked the prayer rally with explosives last night.
[01:11:01.097 --> 01:11:02.898]  You didn't see that on the national news, did you?
[01:11:02.898 --> 01:11:04.559]  And hunted people down to their cars.
[01:11:05.492 --> 01:11:06.252]  To attack them.
[01:11:06.252 --> 01:11:12.835]  And the Christians didn't shoot into the Antifa, or the Antifa would have been on the news as heroes, you know, battling Nazis.
[01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:21.919]  But in America today, in major cities, Christians can't go have a prayer vigil in a park without being attacked by communist devil-worshipping scum.
[01:11:21.919 --> 01:11:28.682]  And let me tell you, 99% of the Antifa are devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[01:11:28.682 --> 01:11:31.743]  And they know they are, and they love it.
[01:11:31.743 --> 01:11:33.884]  So they are completely turned over to it.
[01:11:36.189 --> 01:11:40.412]  They are committed to it, and I challenge you to go to a pro-life rally anywhere in the U.S.
[01:11:40.412 --> 01:11:49.699]  It's in a big city, and they'll show up, and they'll look at you, and they'll say, we're gonna destroy you and Jesus, and we're gonna kill all those babies, and there's, you think, oh, they're doing that just to publicly shock you.
[01:11:49.699 --> 01:12:01.367]  No, we've infiltrated them, and I've seen the videos, you've seen them, in their own meetings, they're just like, we must destroy goodness, we must annihilate children, Satan demands it, G.G.P., G.G.P., G.G.P.
[01:12:01.367 --> 01:12:02.268]  I mean, it's like,
[01:12:02.748 --> 01:12:03.889]  Where did they come from?
[01:12:03.889 --> 01:12:07.752]  You have to know they are out of Satan.
[01:12:07.752 --> 01:12:09.193]  They are 100% real.
[01:12:09.193 --> 01:12:12.735]  They are a weapon and they're coming.
[01:12:12.735 --> 01:12:16.157]  And their masters want to inject babies with mad cow disease.
[01:12:16.157 --> 01:12:17.418]  That's what the COVID vaccine is.
[01:12:17.418 --> 01:12:19.299]  If you want to call it anything, it's mad cow disease.
[01:12:19.299 --> 01:12:21.921]  That's the simplest thing the public can understand.
[01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:27.565]  And they're never going to stop till they've murdered you because the spirit in them says murder, murder, murder.
[01:12:33.399 --> 01:12:33.980]  Kill.
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:34.580]  Death.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:35.121]  Rape.
[01:12:35.121 --> 01:12:36.242]  Murder.
[01:12:36.242 --> 01:12:37.203]  It's one message.
[01:12:37.203 --> 01:12:37.723]  Kill them.
[01:12:37.723 --> 01:12:38.204]  Kill them.
[01:12:38.204 --> 01:12:38.684]  Kill them.
[01:12:38.684 --> 01:12:39.665]  Kill them.
[01:12:39.665 --> 01:12:41.147]  Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:12:41.147 --> 01:12:42.608]  And the only thing they hear is MURDER!
[01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:43.329]  KILL!
[01:12:43.329 --> 01:12:44.270]  RAPE BABIES!
[01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.911]  MURDER!
[01:12:44.911 --> 01:12:45.892]  KILL BABY DOGS!
[01:12:45.892 --> 01:12:46.833]  KILL BABIES!
[01:12:46.833 --> 01:12:47.634]  KILL WOMEN!
[01:12:47.634 --> 01:12:48.334]  BURN BUILDINGS!
[01:12:48.334 --> 01:12:49.195]  KILL POLICE!
[01:12:49.195 --> 01:12:49.736]  KILL!
[01:12:49.736 --> 01:12:50.176]  KILL!
[01:12:50.176 --> 01:12:50.577]  KILL!
[01:12:50.577 --> 01:12:51.037]  KILL!
[01:12:51.037 --> 01:12:54.140]  They're just like... And they're never stopping until you stop them.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.121]  They're never stopping.
[01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:56.162]  Faucis, they're God!
[01:12:57.103 --> 01:13:04.389]  The BioPros are the new non-GMO pollution solution, using eco-friendly products to treat everyday problems while supporting our environment.
[01:13:04.389 --> 01:13:11.194]  For the first time, the BioPros are bringing to the public market a suite of bioremediation products to the everyday consumer.
[01:13:11.194 --> 01:13:14.377]  Their first product they are launching is called BioSeptic Pro.
[01:13:14.797 --> 01:13:18.220]  A product specifically designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:23.024]  BioSeptic Pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.985]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[01:13:24.985 --> 01:13:27.587]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank.
[01:13:27.587 --> 01:13:29.428]  Say goodbye to septic problems.
[01:13:29.428 --> 01:13:31.970]  Gas buildup and odor guaranteed.
[01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:36.254]  BioSeptic Pro is light years ahead of traditional septic treatments.
[01:13:36.254 --> 01:13:43.319]  They have a revolutionary patented delivery system that carries live microorganisms to treat the problem at its core, making their products up to 100 times
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:44.821]  I think so.
[01:13:59.431 --> 01:14:04.935]  The globalists are having their revolution, but free humanity has to have its revolution.
[01:14:04.935 --> 01:14:22.188]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers trying to enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves.
[01:14:22.188 --> 01:14:25.811]  Worse than slaves, they're just property from cradle to grave of the system.
[01:14:26.983 --> 01:14:34.506]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system in a ritual of dominance and satanic control.
[01:14:34.506 --> 01:14:37.608]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world.
[01:14:37.608 --> 01:14:44.531]  We have to realize it's a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[01:14:44.531 --> 01:14:45.751]  It's that choice.
[01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:48.713]  It's that realization that's going to change the world.
[01:14:48.713 --> 01:14:50.914]  And it's the only choice we've got.
[01:14:50.914 --> 01:14:51.694]  Freedom or slavery.
[01:14:51.694 --> 01:14:53.175]  Good or evil.
[01:14:53.175 --> 01:14:54.535]  It is a spiritual battle.
[01:14:54.535 --> 01:14:56.156]  And M4 War is at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[01:15:00.146 --> 01:15:22.843]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:22.843 --> 01:15:26.546]  You say that you wanna go to LA
[01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:46.925]  This morning I saw a cartoon on InfoWars.
[01:15:46.925 --> 01:15:47.885]  It's since scrolled off.
[01:15:47.885 --> 01:15:49.867]  Maybe we can find it or repost it.
[01:15:49.867 --> 01:15:54.270]  And it's the Secretary of Defense, Austin.
[01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:55.291]  And Austin
[01:15:59.335 --> 01:16:06.556]  Is reviewing the troops, literally with a black bag over his head and a huge face mask.
[01:16:06.556 --> 01:16:16.158]  And he does this when he goes to China, when he goes to Russia, and he looks like a total clown, but it's all part of fully buying into the virus and the hysteria and the fear.
[01:16:16.158 --> 01:16:19.659]  Yeah, let's put that back up on screen.
[01:16:19.659 --> 01:16:26.460]  And the media defends it and says it's good and everybody should do it.
[01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:27.840]  Well, it's definitely a PSYOP.
[01:16:30.339 --> 01:16:34.862]  And all it is is the villains beginning to cover their faces.
[01:16:34.862 --> 01:16:42.907]  So they can carry out the fear for the deadly inoculation, to carry out the depopulation operation.
[01:16:42.907 --> 01:16:44.828]  He's signed on to the evil.
[01:16:44.828 --> 01:16:56.175]  Meanwhile, we've got Obama, it's being reported, is still having a party days later at Martha's Vineyard.
[01:16:56.175 --> 01:16:57.736]  And there's nothing wrong with having a party.
[01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:01.583]  I admire this venue, but it's stolen wealth, stolen money.
[01:17:01.583 --> 01:17:03.964]  And he did actually have some of his black friends there.
[01:17:03.964 --> 01:17:07.246]  He's usually carrying out depopulation in Africa.
[01:17:07.246 --> 01:17:13.810]  But there was this white elitist, Stephen Colbert and John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi there.
[01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:18.492]  And then some black movie stars and black rappers and people.
[01:17:18.492 --> 01:17:19.533]  And they're all there.
[01:17:19.533 --> 01:17:24.776]  And then meanwhile, right here, US special.
[01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:28.390]  Envoy on torture.
[01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:31.071]  Authorities are viewing their own people as the enemy.
[01:17:31.071 --> 01:17:40.515]  So the UN comes to investigate us when they're the ones that have called for the worldwide lockdown.
[01:17:40.515 --> 01:17:44.777]  And then they say, oh my God, the police are beating people up all over America.
[01:17:44.777 --> 01:17:46.017]  America's bad.
[01:17:46.017 --> 01:17:47.578]  When all over the world this is being done.
[01:17:47.578 --> 01:17:49.218]  It's wrong and it's evil.
[01:17:49.218 --> 01:17:50.479]  But did the police go?
[01:17:53.069 --> 01:17:56.131]  And did they beat everybody up at the Obama's hangout?
[01:17:56.131 --> 01:17:57.812]  Because the best articles on the Daily Mail.
[01:17:57.812 --> 01:17:58.932]  The party continues.
[01:17:58.932 --> 01:18:01.014]  Obama's 60th celebration.
[01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:11.860]  Roll into third day with a birthday brunch with Oprah, who wants the global depopulation.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:17.704]  And the media said, oh, well, he is sophisticated.
[01:18:17.704 --> 01:18:19.285]  So they were all vaccinated.
[01:18:19.285 --> 01:18:19.705]  Oh, really?
[01:18:19.705 --> 01:18:21.186]  Well, I thought even the
[01:18:22.199 --> 01:18:24.660]  Vaccinated have to wear a mask because the Delta variant.
[01:18:24.660 --> 01:18:26.100]  It's all lies.
[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:30.441]  They don't have to be checked because they're the anointed ones.
[01:18:30.441 --> 01:18:42.683]  And let's not get caught in this trap of saying, oh, well, let's enforce it on them.
[01:18:42.683 --> 01:18:43.603]  They're enforcing on us.
[01:18:43.603 --> 01:18:44.944]  No, the whole thing's a fraud.
[01:18:44.944 --> 01:18:45.724]  The whole thing's a lie.
[01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:59.373]  But thinking of Secretary of Defense Austin, the Pentagon required COVID vaccine for all troops by September 15th, and members of Congress have pointed out under federal law, you can't make even the military take experimental shots.
[01:18:59.373 --> 01:19:03.175]  Which goes to the whole point of how this violates the Nuremberg Code and federal and state law.
[01:19:03.175 --> 01:19:08.139]  We need action against this because this is violent action.
[01:19:10.768 --> 01:19:16.990]  And sure enough, like I said earlier, don't try to criticize this on Yelp, because you're not allowed to.
[01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:17.770]  You're not allowed to anywhere.
[01:19:17.770 --> 01:19:20.931]  You must conform to the experimental shot.
[01:19:20.931 --> 01:19:21.831]  You must submit to it.
[01:19:21.831 --> 01:19:25.192]  Now let's go to a clip of Fauci.
[01:19:25.192 --> 01:19:35.656]  Chastises those attending the Sturgis motorcycle rally, but not a word about Obama, not a word about Black Lives Matter, not a word about any of it, because it's all about the murder of logic and the murder of common sense.
[01:19:35.656 --> 01:19:35.996]  Here it is.
[01:19:37.009 --> 01:19:47.777]  You've brought up regionally the South, but out in the plains, in the Great Plains, Sturgis, South Dakota, there's a gathering right now of some 700,000 people.
[01:19:47.777 --> 01:20:03.309]  Last year, it was a smaller turnout, and it was over about 150,000 people, and it led to a massive outbreak in the Dakotas, where they became number one and number two for essentially the rest of the calendar year of cases.
[01:20:03.309 --> 01:20:06.532]  What do you expect this rally to do to that part of the country?
[01:20:09.864 --> 01:20:15.766]  Well, I'm very concerned, Chuck, that we're going to see another surge related to that rally.
[01:20:15.766 --> 01:20:22.749]  I mean, to me, it's understandable that people want to do the kinds of things they want to do.
[01:20:22.749 --> 01:20:24.750]  They want their freedom to do that.
[01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:31.113]  But there comes a time when you're dealing with a public health crisis that could involve you, your family, and everyone else.
[01:20:31.713 --> 01:20:37.001]  That something supersedes that need to do exactly what you want to do.
[01:20:37.001 --> 01:20:37.682]  That's enough.
[01:20:37.682 --> 01:20:47.035]  Like you at the baseball game without your mask while you murder dogs and little babies and sew the scalps of babies onto rats, you little mad scientist monster!
[01:20:47.035 --> 01:20:48.256]  You little Joseph Mingala!
[01:20:50.484 --> 01:20:52.066]  I pray God brings judgment on him.
[01:20:52.066 --> 01:20:58.235]  I don't want anybody to arm a hair on his rat head, but I want God to bring that monster to justice, and I know God will.
[01:20:58.235 --> 01:21:01.139]  I pray, please, Lord, for the children!
[01:21:01.139 --> 01:21:02.401]  Not for us!
[01:21:02.401 --> 01:21:04.163]  I know we're wicked, but for the children!
[01:21:04.163 --> 01:21:05.585]  Bring judgment against this devil!
[01:21:07.824 --> 01:21:10.005]  So there he is, Sturges is bad!
[01:21:10.005 --> 01:21:20.611]  They had that made up, oh, super spreader, somebody got sick, it's all lies, it's all crap, it's all BS, while they inject you with a spike protein to make you sick and kill your ass.
[01:21:20.611 --> 01:21:22.692]  On record.
[01:21:22.692 --> 01:21:23.753]  Here comes the time.
[01:21:25.247 --> 01:21:28.709]  There comes a time where you pay, Fauci, you and Klaus Schwab.
[01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:32.311]  So here is Obama's party was sophisticated.
[01:21:32.311 --> 01:21:38.294]  She tells this reporter, Carney, who got to be there, she's so powerful, she got to be there.
[01:21:38.294 --> 01:21:39.695]  Oh my God, it's so good.
[01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:45.438]  And the sophisticated crowd, because they're globalists, they're sophisticated.
[01:21:45.438 --> 01:21:47.779]  Here she is.
[01:21:47.779 --> 01:21:50.941]  Other people said, you know, this is really being overblown.
[01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:54.591]  They're following all the safety precautions.
[01:21:54.591 --> 01:21:57.411]  People are going to sporting events that are bigger than this.
[01:21:57.411 --> 01:21:58.652]  This is going to be safe.
[01:21:58.652 --> 01:22:02.893]  This is a sophisticated, vaccinated crowd, and this is just about optics.
[01:22:02.893 --> 01:22:04.774]  It's not about safety.
[01:22:04.774 --> 01:22:06.754]  All right, Annie Carney, thanks so much.
[01:22:06.754 --> 01:22:08.195]  We'll see how it plays out.
[01:22:08.195 --> 01:22:13.436]  Yeah, just like AOC's caught putting her face mask on last week when she knew a camera was there for a press op.
[01:22:13.436 --> 01:22:14.816]  Yeah, we know it's about optics.
[01:22:14.816 --> 01:22:16.777]  We know the face mask.
[01:22:16.777 --> 01:22:18.057]  Again, you can fly.
[01:22:18.057 --> 01:22:18.778]  If a virus was a 747,
[01:22:20.632 --> 01:22:30.358]  You could fly with the average face mask six 747s through the size of a hole if they were a virus.
[01:22:30.358 --> 01:22:35.161]  It's like throwing BBs through scaffoldings the way it's been described.
[01:22:35.161 --> 01:22:37.002]  It's the same thing.
[01:22:37.002 --> 01:22:39.004]  Can you throw a BB through scaffolding?
[01:22:39.004 --> 01:22:40.264]  You know, fixing windows in a house?
[01:22:40.264 --> 01:22:41.865]  Yeah.
[01:22:41.865 --> 01:22:43.867]  It's all crap.
[01:22:43.867 --> 01:22:45.448]  It's all bull.
[01:22:46.673 --> 01:22:53.958]  It's all megacorporations looting and robbing while they then go teach the brown people that white people are the fault and get white people.
[01:22:53.958 --> 01:23:01.644]  Don't get the big banks, don't get Bezos, don't get Ted Turner, don't get Bill Gates, don't get the pedophiles, don't get the eugenicists.
[01:23:01.644 --> 01:23:02.965]  No!
[01:23:02.965 --> 01:23:04.046]  No!
[01:23:04.046 --> 01:23:05.807]  Fight with each other over what color you are.
[01:23:05.807 --> 01:23:12.031]  It's so obvious, it's so disgusting, and they're censoring everyone while they do it because it's their big assault.
[01:23:12.031 --> 01:23:13.052]  It's their big attack.
[01:23:13.052 --> 01:23:15.594]  And now they're going to say all the dead and dying are from the unvaccinated.
[01:23:19.085 --> 01:23:22.508]  Except the majority of those are the vaccinated.
[01:23:22.508 --> 01:23:23.369]  So they got a problem.
[01:23:23.369 --> 01:23:25.011]  This is a cult of fear.
[01:23:25.011 --> 01:23:27.993]  A cult of clownery.
[01:23:27.993 --> 01:23:32.818]  And it's all just virtue signaling garbage.
[01:23:32.818 --> 01:23:34.420]  That's all this is.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:35.561]  And they know it.
[01:23:35.561 --> 01:23:37.482]  And they're terrorizing you.
[01:23:37.482 --> 01:23:39.785]  The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
[01:23:39.785 --> 01:23:39.965]  Okay.
[01:23:41.107 --> 01:23:42.088]  I got a lot of other news.
[01:23:42.088 --> 01:23:44.970]  I've been hit with Antifa attacking a prayer meeting and more.
[01:23:44.970 --> 01:23:46.832]  I want to give the number out also.
[01:23:46.832 --> 01:23:51.896]  Is Obama, and that's who's running things, going to implement the internet kill switch on the 11th?
[01:23:51.896 --> 01:23:52.997]  I'm not saying it's going to happen.
[01:23:52.997 --> 01:23:54.318]  I'm saying they're doing a test.
[01:23:56.752 --> 01:24:07.105]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, and that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[01:24:07.105 --> 01:24:10.629]  Even more than the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:15.075]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[01:24:16.206 --> 01:24:17.046]  Well, guess what?
[01:24:17.046 --> 01:24:31.033]  It was Anthony Fauci and Eugenicist Globalist that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV, and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[01:24:32.253 --> 01:24:37.739]  A virus that would actually go attack the T-lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:44.105]  The problem for them was, the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[01:24:44.105 --> 01:24:47.448]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine.
[01:24:47.448 --> 01:24:53.414]  Because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[01:24:53.414 --> 01:24:54.495]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:55.799 --> 01:25:01.141]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:06.002]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[01:25:06.002 --> 01:25:10.864]  It is truly an answer to prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[01:25:10.864 --> 01:25:13.765]  I want you to know that I love you, and I appreciate you.
[01:25:13.765 --> 01:25:17.106]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[01:25:17.106 --> 01:25:18.327]  You've got red blood.
[01:25:18.327 --> 01:25:25.249]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, then we are brothers and sisters together, and it has just been
[01:25:25.849 --> 01:25:28.771]  An incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[01:25:28.771 --> 01:25:32.653]  And as crazy as things are, I want to keep working into the future.
[01:25:32.653 --> 01:25:35.554]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[01:25:35.554 --> 01:25:41.157]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[01:25:41.157 --> 01:25:43.078]  Again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[01:25:43.078 --> 01:25:47.461]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[01:25:47.461 --> 01:25:51.583]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:54.545]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support him for us.
[01:25:54.545 --> 01:25:54.925]  God bless.
[01:25:56.098 --> 01:26:05.363]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[01:26:05.363 --> 01:26:11.486]  And with promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[01:26:11.486 --> 01:26:11.886]  It's an amazing deal.
[01:26:12.046 --> 01:26:16.087]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:21.948]  You can get my Keys and Dream Sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[01:26:21.948 --> 01:26:27.609]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[01:26:27.609 --> 01:26:30.150]  Myself, I need this for the Cyber Symposium.
[01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:33.550]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:35.391]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[01:26:35.391 --> 01:26:37.451]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[01:26:37.451 --> 01:26:40.792]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[01:26:41.152 --> 01:26:44.253]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:27:32.846 --> 01:27:39.792]  We will be victorious!
[01:27:42.631 --> 01:27:48.037]  And the InfoWars audience inspired that song Mr. Bellamy told me on air.
[01:27:48.037 --> 01:27:50.379]  Alright!
[01:27:50.379 --> 01:27:51.981]  Let's dive into it right now.
[01:27:53.097 --> 01:27:54.838]  You hear about universal basic income.
[01:27:54.838 --> 01:27:57.279]  You hear about forgiving the student debt.
[01:27:57.279 --> 01:28:06.022]  You hear about all this because the globalists are getting our countries and our systems in debt because they control the issuance of currency and debt out of nothing.
[01:28:06.022 --> 01:28:12.124]  And once they get us into full bankruptcy, just like we're a third world country, they can dictate every facet of our lives.
[01:28:12.124 --> 01:28:17.767]  It's called being a slave.
[01:28:17.767 --> 01:28:21.048]  And when they talk about defunding the police, they just mean taking control.
[01:28:22.955 --> 01:28:23.155]  I think?
[01:28:46.132 --> 01:28:54.600]  And it shows thousands and thousands and thousands of people out at the city park peacefully praying and singing after months ago.
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:58.083]  The footage is all in this article.
[01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:05.330]  Antiva came out when there was only 20 or 30 Christians praying and beat them up.
[01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.731]  And so now after this big giant
[01:29:09.141 --> 01:29:10.201]  Peaceful rally.
[01:29:10.201 --> 01:29:15.683]  The scum came because they knew Christians were coming to pray and exercise their first amendment.
[01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:28.888]  And so unlike the Chinese tanks at Tiananmen Square attacking the democracy protesters, which our media decried and said was terrible.
[01:29:28.888 --> 01:29:31.369]  That was 30 something years ago.
[01:29:31.369 --> 01:29:35.211]  Now it's praised because they're fighting
[01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:47.094]  White supremacists with fireworks, explosive mortars, and clubs chasing Christians with their children to their cars.
[01:29:47.094 --> 01:29:50.919]  And thank God the police did a little and fired some tear gas.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:30:02.065]  Full-grown men in black chasing Christians, men, women, and children to their cars, physically attacking them.
[01:30:02.065 --> 01:30:03.226]  This is the left.
[01:30:03.226 --> 01:30:07.748]  This is what they'll do to you once they get control of a city.
[01:30:07.748 --> 01:30:09.429]  Because they don't need to defund the police.
[01:30:09.429 --> 01:30:10.610]  They threaten to do it.
[01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:11.751]  They get control.
[01:30:11.751 --> 01:30:14.472]  George Soros puts their people in and it's game over.
[01:30:14.472 --> 01:30:15.733]  Yeah, here's footage from months ago.
[01:30:16.698 --> 01:30:18.939]  when they came and shut down the Christian event.
[01:30:18.939 --> 01:30:23.762]  And we can, I'd really like to show the video, it's powerful, that's in the article right here.
[01:30:23.762 --> 01:30:33.588]  It shows the big, huge Christian group that was there, the thousands and thousands of them that peacefully had their event.
[01:30:33.588 --> 01:30:35.709]  But you can find it on InfoWars.com.
[01:30:36.744 --> 01:30:37.985]  Andy Nego shot video of it.
[01:30:37.985 --> 01:30:42.889]  It's video armed Antifa hunt down attendees of a Christian event in Portland.
[01:30:42.889 --> 01:30:45.411]  You can see them originally attacked the group months ago.
[01:30:45.411 --> 01:30:50.096]  So they came out and said, well, we'll have more Christians come out for free speech and religious freedom.
[01:30:50.096 --> 01:30:50.996]  And then we've got the footage.
[01:30:50.996 --> 01:30:52.337]  Hell, I'll pull it up.
[01:30:52.337 --> 01:30:54.139]  We got the footage of that.
[01:30:54.139 --> 01:30:54.900]  Yeah, look at that.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:31:00.244]  Look at that big event of nice Christians coming together.
[01:31:00.244 --> 01:31:01.705]  And then night falls.
[01:31:02.682 --> 01:31:04.383]  And here comes the scum.
[01:31:04.383 --> 01:31:16.610]  They're not about to let filthy, dirty, American, Christian trash of every race, color, and creed come together and not let those bullies stop them.
[01:31:16.610 --> 01:31:16.750]  No!
[01:31:17.947 --> 01:31:28.815]  Because they came together, they've got to follow them to their cars, they've got to throw explosives at them, they've got to beat them with poles and clubs because they are the Democrats.
[01:31:28.815 --> 01:31:30.797]  They are the good guys.
[01:31:30.797 --> 01:31:37.602]  They are the anti-fascists of Stephen Colbert and Barack Obama that funded.
[01:31:37.602 --> 01:31:42.726]  So, continuing on, whether you are in Minnesota,
[01:31:44.226 --> 01:31:55.415]  Or whether you were in all these different areas, like Washington State, or Oregon, or countless other places, they're trying to defund the police.
[01:31:55.415 --> 01:31:58.318]  Not that the police are perfect, but they want control of the police.
[01:31:58.318 --> 01:31:59.219]  Here's a great cartoon.
[01:31:59.219 --> 01:32:04.323]  Local communities, Phil and Omar takes the money away, says, give me that.
[01:32:04.323 --> 01:32:05.864]  Omar's private security.
[01:32:05.864 --> 01:32:08.607]  The city of Minneapolis, as you know, cut the police by half.
[01:32:09.667 --> 01:32:17.453]  And then gave themselves a multi-million dollar private security firm for two security guards per city council member, 24 hours a day.
[01:32:17.453 --> 01:32:32.785]  Armed men, when they go to the bathroom, when they pull their car into work, when they go home at night, and when they're asleep inside their houses, sitting in the parking lot of their house or in their kitchen, are armed men.
[01:32:32.785 --> 01:32:37.669]  Three shifts a day, two armed men, six guards a day,
[01:32:39.073 --> 01:32:43.374]  To protect them.
[01:32:43.374 --> 01:32:45.395]  You're like, that doesn't have logic.
[01:32:45.395 --> 01:32:56.938]  They want to defund the police over one thing that went wrong with a heroin addict, a fentanyl addict, and want to say all cops are bad, but then they have off-duty cops protecting them for $35 an hour, $40 an hour, $50 an hour.
[01:32:59.858 --> 01:33:01.219]  Hell, in some cases, it's their friends.
[01:33:01.219 --> 01:33:02.280]  They're getting like $500 an hour.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:05.122]  I mean, there's a bunch of scams going on here as well.
[01:33:05.122 --> 01:33:07.483]  So doesn't that illustrate everything to you?
[01:33:07.483 --> 01:33:11.626]  And Congresswoman Cori Bush, she came out in a press conference last week.
[01:33:11.626 --> 01:33:22.954]  I never even got to it and said, hey, it's not a conflict that I want to get rid of police, but I got private security.
[01:33:22.954 --> 01:33:26.296]  And now they're giving $2 billion to the Capitol Police to be in all 50 states?
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:34.702]  Cori Bush will pay $200K for private security, but she still wants to defund the police.
[01:33:34.702 --> 01:33:37.482]  That's what you call a commie, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:37.482 --> 01:33:38.262]  Let's continue.
[01:33:38.262 --> 01:33:42.363]  She doesn't want you to have guns to protect yourself.
[01:33:42.363 --> 01:33:44.244]  She doesn't want you to have police.
[01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:49.665]  She doesn't want you to have nothing!
[01:33:49.665 --> 01:33:50.645]  And that's the type of people
[01:33:54.206 --> 01:33:57.367]  That's George Soros, who's got up to 20 bodyguards.
[01:33:57.367 --> 01:34:00.689]  Michael Bloomberg has, like, 30 bodyguards sitting on time.
[01:34:00.689 --> 01:34:03.630]  I know, because I know people that have worked on this detail.
[01:34:03.630 --> 01:34:08.432]  Up to 30 bodyguards for Michael Bloomberg, but you know what?
[01:34:08.432 --> 01:34:14.435]  You're some bus driver in New York City that can barely pay their rent, you can't have a guy to protect yourself.
[01:34:14.435 --> 01:34:16.056]  No, because you're not Mike Bloomberg.
[01:34:16.056 --> 01:34:21.298]  And Mike Bloomberg, by the way, a lot of people that know Mike Bloomberg, he doesn't give waiters tips, he doesn't give a damn about anybody.
[01:34:25.663 --> 01:34:32.207]  Because he's a selfish, monstrous, soulless pig who doesn't want his slaves armed.
[01:34:32.207 --> 01:34:35.169]  He wants to be the only one with guns so he rules over you.
[01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:46.897]  And he has a corrupt marketing computer system that siphons money off the stock market because he's part of the in-mafia crowd.
[01:34:46.897 --> 01:34:52.421]  All a bunch of soulless nerds like Charlie Munger who loves
[01:34:54.167 --> 01:35:03.712]  China and Communists and Trudeau and Warren Buffett, they all just wear the little suits, little ties when they're psychotics.
[01:35:03.712 --> 01:35:11.896]  Meanwhile, Americans collectively owe $4.32 trillion in consumer debt and with another lockdown you'll go deeper into debt.
[01:35:11.896 --> 01:35:13.017]  Insanity!
[01:35:13.017 --> 01:35:16.779]  There are now 1.4 million more job openings than unemployed workers.
[01:35:18.919 --> 01:35:27.069]  Representative Omar introduces guaranteed income bill and GDP alternative legislation.
[01:35:27.069 --> 01:35:28.590]  But we're not based on our output.
[01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:29.371]  No, no.
[01:35:29.371 --> 01:35:29.772]  No, no.
[01:35:29.772 --> 01:35:31.814]  A social credit score.
[01:35:31.814 --> 01:35:34.317]  Should Obama's internet kill switch power be curbed?
[01:35:34.317 --> 01:35:37.982]  I'm going to cover that, as I mentioned, when we come back and give the number out.
[01:35:39.309 --> 01:35:48.332]  Let's open the phones up for your vaccine experiences, your family's so-called vaccine experiences, and the fact they're trying to make it mandatory with an experimental shot.
[01:35:48.332 --> 01:35:54.633]  And Fauci's saying you shouldn't have a motorcycle rally, but Obama can have his rally because he's sophisticated.
[01:35:54.633 --> 01:35:55.914]  What is your take on this?
[01:35:55.914 --> 01:36:07.337]  First-time callers, we're going to take a lot of your calls the next hour and a half, the next hour and 15 minutes, interspersed with all of the news and information at so many clubs I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:36:08.830 --> 01:36:15.995]  The toll-free number is 877-789-2539.
[01:36:15.995 --> 01:36:16.696]  877-789-2539.
[01:36:16.696 --> 01:36:19.118]  877-789-Alex.
[01:36:19.118 --> 01:36:20.238]  And I would love to hear it.
[01:36:20.238 --> 01:36:21.599]  You love the vaccine.
[01:36:21.599 --> 01:36:23.281]  It made you super happy.
[01:36:23.281 --> 01:36:24.882]  It was a great day.
[01:36:24.882 --> 01:36:27.604]  We haven't gotten those calls yet, but maybe they exist.
[01:36:27.604 --> 01:36:30.206]  Or your experience, your family's experience.
[01:36:30.206 --> 01:36:34.369]  And what do you make of just all this news and information coming out?
[01:36:35.245 --> 01:36:36.285]  And so much more.
[01:36:36.285 --> 01:36:44.949]  They want you disarmed, so Antifa can come by, knock down your door, tie you up in front of your wife and children, and then rape them and kill them before they slit your throat.
[01:36:44.949 --> 01:36:45.869]  They want to do one thing.
[01:36:45.869 --> 01:36:47.850]  That's tie you and your family up and kill you.
[01:36:47.850 --> 01:36:48.571]  I'm not joking.
[01:36:48.571 --> 01:36:50.732]  They're devil worshippers that want to murder you.
[01:36:50.732 --> 01:36:51.472]  They work for Fauci.
[01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:58.873]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[01:36:58.873 --> 01:37:02.975]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[01:37:02.975 --> 01:37:05.297]  All the tyranny we warned of is down here.
[01:37:05.297 --> 01:37:10.100]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:13.802]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[01:37:14.222 --> 01:37:22.750]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[01:37:22.750 --> 01:37:30.096]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air, and please take advantage of the big super sale, flash sale we're doing right now at InfoWarsStore.com.

[01:37:55.282 --> 01:37:58.165]  The biosecurity state is here.
[01:37:58.165 --> 01:38:04.090]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[01:38:04.090 --> 01:38:17.883]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country, all the way out to 2024.
[01:38:19.304 --> 01:38:22.505]  And that in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[01:38:22.505 --> 01:38:26.527]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[01:38:26.527 --> 01:38:28.288]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:38:28.288 --> 01:38:30.969]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[01:38:30.969 --> 01:38:33.230]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[01:38:33.230 --> 01:38:35.771]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:38:35.771 --> 01:38:45.376]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[01:38:46.076 --> 01:38:48.018]  InfoWars will continue to steadfastly fight this.
[01:38:48.018 --> 01:38:49.499]  I don't know how long we can.
[01:38:49.499 --> 01:38:50.860]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:52.502]  God bless and good luck.
[01:38:52.502 --> 01:38:55.985]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[01:38:55.985 --> 01:39:02.551]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say, thank you for what you've done.
[01:39:02.551 --> 01:39:04.493]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[01:39:04.493 --> 01:39:05.934]  Thank you for praying for us.
[01:39:05.934 --> 01:39:07.015]  And thank you for spreading the word.
[01:39:08.248 --> 01:39:18.676]  If all of you will simply go to Infowarsstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[01:39:18.676 --> 01:39:24.080]  It will remind you every day like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:30.587]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[01:39:30.587 --> 01:39:37.094]  And in this surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[01:39:37.094 --> 01:39:39.577]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.

[01:40:15.571 --> 01:40:22.172]  You can get my Geezer Dream Sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[01:40:22.172 --> 01:40:27.834]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[01:40:27.834 --> 01:40:30.374]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[01:40:30.374 --> 01:40:33.755]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[01:40:33.755 --> 01:40:35.776]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[01:40:35.776 --> 01:40:37.676]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[01:40:37.676 --> 01:40:40.997]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[01:40:41.377 --> 01:40:44.458]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:17.307 --> 01:41:37.014]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:41:37.014 --> 01:41:42.315]  You know, during the break I went in my office and had a little bit of lunch.
[01:41:42.315 --> 01:41:44.316]  I thought about the things I just said in the last hour.
[01:41:46.073 --> 01:41:58.178]  Fauci's got baby beagles, puppies, been planting them with maggots that then eat them to death before their rotten blood is drawn off.
[01:41:58.178 --> 01:42:07.142]  And they figure out how to then infect humans with the blood.
[01:42:07.142 --> 01:42:10.884]  And then I think about Fauci.
[01:42:12.688 --> 01:42:18.111]  Little piece of pepper in the green beans I was eating out of my craw.
[01:42:18.111 --> 01:42:23.794]  And then I was thinking about, uh, just the latest about, you know, all the dead babies.
[01:42:23.794 --> 01:42:30.678]  They keep the baby alive, they scalp it, then they suture its living scalp onto a rack.
[01:42:30.678 --> 01:42:32.599]  Or how they keep babies alive and sell their organs.
[01:42:32.599 --> 01:42:33.819]  Fauci's doing all that.
[01:42:33.819 --> 01:42:38.002]  And that all just sounds crazy, like it's a lie, but it's all admitted.
[01:42:38.002 --> 01:42:41.844]  And then, I'm up here reporting to radio listeners who can't see the video.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:53.766]  That tens of thousands of peaceful Christians show up to pray in a park because a few dozen of them got physically attacked a few months ago and told you can't be in the city if you're a Christian in Portland.
[01:42:53.766 --> 01:42:57.509]  Talk about a civil rights violation.
[01:42:57.509 --> 01:43:01.171]  Violation of the First Amendment.
[01:43:01.171 --> 01:43:10.456]  And then you watch the footage of full-grown men with clubs and bricks and explosive fireworks that can kill you, you know, the big mortar shells, attacking men, women, and children.
[01:43:10.456 --> 01:43:12.738]  And the left is on Twitter praising it.
[01:43:15.199 --> 01:43:23.183]  And the average leftist doing this, calling for Andy Nago to die, who shot the footage, some of it.
[01:43:23.183 --> 01:43:24.784]  Think about what monsters they are.
[01:43:24.784 --> 01:43:32.308]  Because I know one thing about leftists, they are on average the softest, stupidest, dumbest people around.
[01:43:32.308 --> 01:43:42.193]  So there they are, cheering on full-grown men attacking Christians, throwing rocks at women, and this is who we've become.
[01:43:42.193 --> 01:43:43.713]  This is the fall of our country.
[01:43:43.713 --> 01:43:44.734]  This is the fall of our soul.
[01:43:47.734 --> 01:43:51.378]  Men running around with clubs.
[01:43:51.378 --> 01:43:53.801]  There's dozens of these videos.
[01:43:53.801 --> 01:43:58.847]  Hitting women over the heads with them because they dared come to a park.
[01:43:58.847 --> 01:44:04.493]  A gang that doesn't want Christians to have the right to pray.
[01:44:04.493 --> 01:44:07.357]  And I guarantee you, I bet you a thousand dollars
[01:44:10.168 --> 01:44:10.428]  I don't
[01:44:31.024 --> 01:44:35.667]  Very stupid, very hateful, but very hungry to attack.
[01:44:35.667 --> 01:44:38.948]  And if they see somebody in a wheelchair, they even attack more.
[01:44:38.948 --> 01:44:39.869]  You're like, that doesn't make sense.
[01:44:39.869 --> 01:44:40.909]  That's not manly.
[01:44:40.909 --> 01:44:45.292]  Well, these aren't manly people.
[01:44:45.292 --> 01:44:49.674]  And you remember how they, you know, sneak around and shoot people.
[01:44:49.674 --> 01:44:51.255]  And kill them.
[01:44:51.255 --> 01:44:59.820]  So, to be able to be on the streets of America, in a leptis area, you have to be ready to fight now.
[01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:08.411]  And they worship Xi Jinping.
[01:45:08.411 --> 01:45:12.493]  They see him as an idol, a guy that knows how to get things done.
[01:45:12.493 --> 01:45:20.956]  And they see George Washington as a terrorist.
[01:45:20.956 --> 01:45:29.020]  And so I just really wanted to sink in the type of people they are.
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:34.262]  You know, Owen Schroer got hit once by Antifa when they had an event in downtown Austin.
[01:45:36.049 --> 01:45:38.411]  Called Donald Trump, Alex Jones and fake news.
[01:45:38.411 --> 01:45:41.033]  They blocked off part of downtown on Congress by the Capitol.
[01:45:41.033 --> 01:45:42.795]  They had big giant tents up.
[01:45:42.795 --> 01:45:44.176]  Only a few hundred people showed up.
[01:45:44.176 --> 01:45:46.958]  They had chairs for thousands.
[01:45:46.958 --> 01:45:51.081]  And we get there and dudes run up and say, you're not allowed to be here.
[01:45:51.081 --> 01:45:56.286]  They asked the police to arrest us, but they wouldn't because it was open to the city.
[01:45:56.286 --> 01:46:02.911]  And then guys come over to me and there's video of this and start trying to lick my face and start saying, I like to have sex with children.
[01:46:02.911 --> 01:46:04.152]  These men start doing these weird little
[01:46:04.807 --> 01:46:05.728]  Weird dances.
[01:46:05.728 --> 01:46:06.548]  I like babies.
[01:46:06.548 --> 01:46:07.749]  I like to have sex with children.
[01:46:07.749 --> 01:46:09.791]  Don't you like children?
[01:46:09.791 --> 01:46:12.753]  And so after a while, we leave.
[01:46:12.753 --> 01:46:18.697]  And right before we get in the car, a guy on a bike rides by and throws a bag at us.
[01:46:18.697 --> 01:46:20.278]  And it hits.
[01:46:20.278 --> 01:46:22.000]  And one drop gets on me and smells.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:22.660]  More of it hits Owen.
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:24.922]  And we're like, what the hell is that smell?
[01:46:24.922 --> 01:46:26.923]  And this is what Antifa does.
[01:46:26.923 --> 01:46:31.307]  They defecate and urinate in bags for months and grow it and rot it.
[01:46:31.307 --> 01:46:32.267]  That's their artwork.
[01:46:32.267 --> 01:46:33.088]  And then they throw it at you.
[01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:41.703]  So you gotta understand, this is a special type of scum, and they're your school teachers, they're even your police officers now.
[01:46:41.703 --> 01:46:50.085]  We've seen rallies around the country where, you know, city officials take pictures of people at pro-America rallies, and that gets given to Antifa.
[01:46:50.085 --> 01:46:51.726]  They're inside the FBI, they're everywhere.
[01:46:54.631 --> 01:47:02.174]  And they are evil, weak-minded people that have turned themselves over to absolute evil and they hate America.
[01:47:02.174 --> 01:47:03.574]  In fact, that's their main thing.
[01:47:03.574 --> 01:47:05.115]  There's no borders, no wall, no U.S.A.
[01:47:05.115 --> 01:47:05.335]  at all.
[01:47:05.335 --> 01:47:08.396]  Get rid of the country.
[01:47:08.396 --> 01:47:09.177]  They have a better name.
[01:47:09.177 --> 01:47:09.857]  It's called cancer.
[01:47:11.152 --> 01:47:17.657]  We're going to start the next hour and go to Katie, and William, and Will, and Patrick, and Jake, and James, and Matt, and Scott, and Nathan, and Dan.
[01:47:17.657 --> 01:47:25.282]  And I'll get to every single one of those callers and more at 877-789-2539 on this live Monday edition.
[01:47:25.282 --> 01:47:30.586]  But if I sound like... I mean, folks, I haven't even gotten to the infrastructure bill.
[01:47:30.586 --> 01:47:33.107]  But luckily, that's all over the news.
[01:47:33.107 --> 01:47:39.612]  But you read even the local newspapers like, infrastructure bill is very good and fights terrorism.
[01:47:42.694 --> 01:47:48.176]  Then you read it and it says, cameras will be in all new cars to watch you and make sure you're following the law.
[01:47:48.176 --> 01:47:51.357]  They'll be hooked into the police department under federal law.
[01:47:51.357 --> 01:47:52.437]  Cameras in all the cars.
[01:47:52.437 --> 01:47:53.417]  And breathalyzers.
[01:47:53.417 --> 01:47:57.779]  And questioning a transgender will be a federal crime.
[01:47:57.779 --> 01:48:03.360]  And if you criticize certified science of the CDC, you'll be arrested.
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.082]  And like, you know, because I knew the infrastructure bill was bad.
[01:48:09.500 --> 01:48:12.965]  But they didn't have a final version until, like, Thursday.
[01:48:12.965 --> 01:48:14.608]  So I got busy and didn't go over it.
[01:48:14.608 --> 01:48:18.674]  So then I learned Friday night, after I'd done a whole show, that it had that.
[01:48:18.674 --> 01:48:19.815]  So I went and looked at it.
[01:48:19.815 --> 01:48:22.760]  I scanned over the 2,700 pages, and it was all there.
[01:48:23.951 --> 01:48:37.597]  Just like, okay, giving dogs maggots and torturing to death, attacking prayer groups and children, scalping babies and putting the hair on rats, giving people deadly spike protein poison that they know will kill you in a vaccine.
[01:48:37.597 --> 01:48:39.498]  All of this sounds insane because it is, folks.
[01:48:39.498 --> 01:48:42.939]  We're under the attack.
[01:48:42.939 --> 01:48:45.681]  We are under the massive satanic attack now.
[01:48:45.681 --> 01:48:46.681]  This is it.
[01:48:46.681 --> 01:48:48.602]  And it's just going to get crazier from here on out.
[01:48:50.691 --> 01:48:58.695]  Because they know America was too vibrant, too Christian, too strong in its roots, and it will keep regenerating, so they've got to destroy the whole thing.
[01:48:58.695 --> 01:49:05.038]  Because this system's got to go for their world government, new world order system to come in.
[01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:08.880]  And that's really the big news here.
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.581]  Yeah, it tracks your travel data, puts cameras in it, microphones.
[01:49:12.581 --> 01:49:14.822]  I mean, even mainstream news can't even get it hardcore enough.
[01:49:14.822 --> 01:49:19.084]  It actually says, watch you with cameras in your car.
[01:49:21.630 --> 01:49:22.933]  We're going to be covering it all here.
[01:49:22.933 --> 01:49:25.158]  I want to thank listeners for your support.
[01:49:25.158 --> 01:49:30.470]  You know, the system spends a lot of time and a lot of energy trying to shut us up and trying to take us off air.
[01:49:32.128 --> 01:49:34.310]  Because they don't want somebody calling them out for what they're really doing.
[01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:48.722]  So they see taking Infowars off the air, and shadow banning us, and outright banning us, and suing us, and then suing us in corrupt court jurisdictions, totally controlled by the Democrats, where the individuals involved don't even deny it's all rigged.
[01:49:48.722 --> 01:49:53.866]  Just a real sense of entitlement, and a real humorous, but that's okay.
[01:49:53.866 --> 01:49:59.230]  Because while they pretend they're bringing us down, their whole system is actually coming down.
[01:49:59.230 --> 01:49:59.771]  And they know it.
[01:50:00.964 --> 01:50:05.668]  But keeping us on air while getting great products at the same time is totally essential.
[01:50:05.668 --> 01:50:23.021]  And if you go to MyPillow.com, if you need towels, if you need sheets, if you need pillows, if you need shoes and slippers and human beds that are excellent and dog beds and cat beds and Mike Lindell's book and all, he's got a ton of products.

[01:50:42.978 --> 01:50:47.140]  And then now we have the InfoWars Limited Supply Flash Sale running.
[01:50:48.852 --> 01:50:58.496]  And a lot of the stuff has had to go off sale like the Ultimate Turmeric Formula and a few others, but you've got one more day left of TurboForce 10-hour clean energy that people love so much.
[01:50:58.496 --> 01:51:02.638]  50% off lung and mouth cleanse and throat defense.

[01:51:20.153 --> 01:51:22.914]  Survival Shield X2.
[01:51:22.914 --> 01:51:26.276]  More is coming in in about a month, but I'm still going to sell it out.
[01:51:26.276 --> 01:51:26.996]  50% off.
[01:51:26.996 --> 01:51:29.697]  InfoWars Privacy Pouches with 11 InfoWars bumper stickers.

[01:51:39.442 --> 01:51:41.083]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:51:41.083 --> 01:51:41.503]  Stay with us.
[01:51:44.915 --> 01:51:51.341]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[01:51:51.341 --> 01:51:58.708]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[01:51:58.708 --> 01:51:59.889]  Consuming too much fluoride
[01:51:59.889 --> 01:52:00.069]  I think?
[01:52:21.821 --> 01:52:25.103]  And otherwise, unseen dimensions of reality.
[01:52:25.103 --> 01:52:30.107]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[01:52:30.107 --> 01:52:36.371]  Our water filtration systems, with the proper filters, will keep your drinking water fluoride-free.
[01:52:36.371 --> 01:52:39.233]  And the Pro-Pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[01:52:39.233 --> 01:52:44.037]  Get them both today, for yourself or a friend, at Infowarestore.com.
[01:52:46.598 --> 01:52:49.901]  So what's the most important part, let's say, in a bulldozer running over the Globalist?
[01:52:49.901 --> 01:52:53.365]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[01:52:53.365 --> 01:52:56.088]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[01:52:56.088 --> 01:52:57.009]  And that's my allegory.
[01:52:58.052 --> 01:53:09.118]  TurboForce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy, clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human.
[01:53:09.118 --> 01:53:10.439]  Some people get 15 hours out of it.
[01:53:10.439 --> 01:53:11.439]  Some people get about 8 hours.
[01:53:11.439 --> 01:53:12.400]  But people take this.
[01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.420]  People take it in sports.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:17.182]  People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not hype.
[01:53:17.182 --> 01:53:22.005]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts.
[01:53:22.005 --> 01:53:23.406]  You can call us whatever you want.
[01:53:23.406 --> 01:53:24.826]  It's a total solution.
[01:53:24.826 --> 01:53:25.987]  All around the best you're going to find.
[01:53:26.107 --> 01:53:27.108]  Turbo Force.
[01:53:27.108 --> 01:53:29.369]  Without you, we don't roll.
[01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:31.071]  With you, we surge forward together.
[01:53:31.071 --> 01:53:33.112]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[01:53:33.112 --> 01:53:35.734]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[01:53:35.734 --> 01:53:38.796]  You support us and get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind?
[01:53:38.796 --> 01:53:39.797]  It's a win-win.
[01:53:39.797 --> 01:53:40.317]  360 together.
[01:53:40.317 --> 01:53:41.358]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:53:41.358 --> 01:53:42.679]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:07.907 --> 01:54:11.091]  All right, I'm going right to your phone calls, and then we've got breaking news.
[01:54:11.091 --> 01:54:12.132]  I told you this was coming.
[01:54:12.132 --> 01:54:15.175]  I mentioned this at the first of the show.
[01:54:15.175 --> 01:54:19.140]  I meant to get to it more, and I will start the next segment briefly because I need to go to your calls.
[01:54:20.339 --> 01:54:23.240]  But they're going to put pressure on us with deadly vaccines.
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:25.522]  They're going to try to take away our right to mobility.
[01:54:25.522 --> 01:54:27.823]  They're going to try to bring in this World ID, which they're not doing.
[01:54:27.823 --> 01:54:32.305]  And then when we fight back against it, they're going to call us terrorists.
[01:54:32.305 --> 01:54:37.708]  And then at that point, things are going to escalate out of control with these globalists posing as the saviors.
[01:54:37.708 --> 01:54:42.510]  Well, now the BBC studios stormed by anti-COVID passport protesters.
[01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:45.492]  Video shows clashes with police amid attempted break-in.
[01:54:46.454 --> 01:54:50.257]  So when BLM burns a building down, it's loving and good.
[01:54:50.257 --> 01:54:57.402]  But when people go into the enemy media and let them know we're aware of you, and occupy it, it's going to be called a break-in.
[01:54:57.402 --> 01:55:02.505]  So, these tyrants are going to keep pushing until it just totally explodes.
[01:55:02.505 --> 01:55:07.529]  And then I want all the government people involved put on trial in Nuremberg too.
[01:55:07.529 --> 01:55:09.810]  They need long prison sentences for what they've done.
[01:55:09.810 --> 01:55:13.593]  So these tyrants don't try this again for a very long time.
[01:55:15.017 --> 01:55:17.719]  I mean, again, on a scale of 1 to 10, this takeover's a 10.
[01:55:17.719 --> 01:55:25.285]  I mean, this is the most flaming, nauseous, poisonous tyranny the world has ever seen.
[01:55:25.285 --> 01:55:27.006]  And it's going to get worse and worse.
[01:55:27.006 --> 01:55:28.587]  We know you're murdering us.
[01:55:28.587 --> 01:55:30.289]  We know you launched the attack.
[01:55:30.289 --> 01:55:32.290]  We know the vaccine's poison.
[01:55:32.290 --> 01:55:34.432]  So just get ready for war.
[01:55:34.432 --> 01:55:37.614]  And we know the feds and the globals are going to blow up buildings and blame it on us.
[01:55:37.614 --> 01:55:38.815]  We're not going to blow up any buildings.
[01:55:38.815 --> 01:55:39.836]  We're not going to shoot any cops.
[01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:43.190]  But people are going to start occupying things.
[01:55:43.190 --> 01:55:45.111]  People are going to start shutting things down.
[01:55:45.111 --> 01:55:46.431]  People are going to start moving.
[01:55:46.431 --> 01:55:48.772]  So, just like Cuba, just keep pushing.
[01:55:48.772 --> 01:55:50.993]  That's coming up next segment.
[01:55:50.993 --> 01:55:53.774]  Speaking of that, let's talk to William in California.
[01:55:53.774 --> 01:55:58.456]  He got powerful true words from Senator Rand Paul, saying, we got to head up the beast.
[01:55:58.456 --> 01:55:59.916]  It's an authoritarian takeover.
[01:55:59.916 --> 01:56:01.257]  It's a known fraud.
[01:56:01.257 --> 01:56:02.297]  We got to call it out.
[01:56:02.297 --> 01:56:02.877]  That's what it is.
[01:56:02.877 --> 01:56:05.358]  And I've been saying, we need leaders to say what it is.
[01:56:05.358 --> 01:56:06.459]  It's a takeover.
[01:56:06.459 --> 01:56:07.379]  It's fraud.
[01:56:07.379 --> 01:56:08.780]  It's not misguided.
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:09.440]  It's a plan.
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:13.823]  We have to attack the plan, the lie, in the public arena.
[01:56:13.823 --> 01:56:20.529]  And people will join us, and we will defeat it, and we will indict Fauci, we will indict Schwab, we will indict Bill Gates.
[01:56:20.529 --> 01:56:23.092]  Go ahead, William in California.
[01:56:23.092 --> 01:56:24.213]  Hi, Alex.
[01:56:24.213 --> 01:56:26.495]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:56:26.495 --> 01:56:27.215]  Can you hear me, sir?
[01:56:27.215 --> 01:56:29.077]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:29.077 --> 01:56:35.403]  Well, you know, I've been listening, and I can honestly say, you know, when I watched that video,
[01:56:36.641 --> 01:56:36.761]  I'm
[01:57:07.679 --> 01:57:10.782]  They're used to socialism over there, I guess, to a degree.
[01:57:10.782 --> 01:57:15.005]  So they're kind of pulling the bows, hook, line, and sinker.
[01:57:15.005 --> 01:57:17.327]  I just hope that they don't plan on coming here.
[01:57:17.327 --> 01:57:19.970]  And I'll tell you, you know, we talk about Nuremberg, too.
[01:57:20.638 --> 01:57:29.425]  And I can honestly say when we brought Van Braun and a lot of these guys over here, wow man, I don't know what we were thinking.
[01:57:29.425 --> 01:57:32.027]  I don't care how smart any of these guys are.
[01:57:32.027 --> 01:57:35.209]  You're talking about the 40 plus thousand Nazis we brought over here.
[01:57:35.209 --> 01:57:38.932]  And they formed the backbone of a lot of our problems.
[01:57:38.932 --> 01:57:43.016]  We have to understand the ideology they got came from eugenicists in America and England.
[01:57:43.016 --> 01:57:48.019]  So our globalists created Hitler, they were just bringing their babies back.
[01:57:48.940 --> 01:57:53.221]  And then if you expand on that, this whole Soviet influence has now come over here.
[01:57:53.221 --> 01:57:58.142]  I mean, the EU is basically run by former Soviet bureaucrats.
[01:57:58.142 --> 01:58:04.684]  Well, you know, the syllogism here is it's something that you envision in a Star Trek flick.
[01:58:04.684 --> 01:58:06.504]  You know, what would Captain Kirk do?
[01:58:06.504 --> 01:58:11.165]  But in reality, they haven't been planning very well.
[01:58:11.165 --> 01:58:18.247]  If they want eugenics, you know, outcomes, if they want to push eugenics, well, why don't they
[01:58:19.244 --> 01:58:25.029]  Enlighten the people, generally, so the evil spirits will flee at the dawn of day.
[01:58:25.029 --> 01:58:28.893]  I don't understand why they keep pushing what they push.
[01:58:28.893 --> 01:58:32.536]  You know, have 10 kids, you know, do this, do that.
[01:58:32.536 --> 01:58:36.760]  Because they're not even really pushing what you think of as eugenics the way they advertise eugenics.
[01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:42.265]  Eugenics is the elite dumbing down everybody so they can all be slaughtered at once.
[01:58:42.265 --> 01:58:43.005]  I appreciate your call.
[01:58:43.831 --> 01:58:49.336]  You see, they want an army of dumbed-down people they control to take out the other thinkers.
[01:58:49.336 --> 01:58:51.277]  There's the evil thinkers and the good thinkers.
[01:58:51.277 --> 01:58:55.921]  The evil thinkers are using the giant mom.
[01:58:55.921 --> 01:59:05.269]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[01:59:05.269 --> 01:59:11.374]  With promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discounted
[01:59:11.394 --> 01:59:12.254]  It's an amazing deal.
[01:59:12.254 --> 01:59:15.916]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[01:59:15.916 --> 01:59:21.778]  You can get my Keys to Dreams sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[01:59:21.778 --> 01:59:27.440]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:29.981]  Myself, I need this for the Cyber Symposium.
[01:59:29.981 --> 01:59:33.362]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[01:59:33.362 --> 01:59:35.223]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[01:59:35.223 --> 01:59:37.284]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[01:59:37.284 --> 01:59:40.605]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[01:59:41.045 --> 01:59:52.696]  Us getting the word out with Alex's great show, Improv Wars, and you're supporting MyPillow, 2,500 employees that I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be an attack on campus.
[01:59:52.696 --> 01:59:52.996]  Beautiful.
[01:59:52.996 --> 01:59:54.137]  You're an example of resistance.
[01:59:54.137 --> 01:59:55.138]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[02:00:06.195 --> 02:00:08.836]  So, the BBC Pedophile Network
[02:00:31.479 --> 02:00:32.860]  Famously protecting pedophiles.
[02:00:32.860 --> 02:00:35.122]  That's all come out and been confirmed.
[02:00:35.122 --> 02:00:40.446]  First exposed by David Icke almost 30 years ago.
[02:00:40.446 --> 02:00:44.409]  BBC Studios stormed by anti-COVID passport protesters.
[02:00:44.409 --> 02:00:48.292]  Video shows clashes with police amid attempted break-in.
[02:00:48.292 --> 02:00:55.297]  And the people there are just trying to protest the BBC and the police attack them because they're a bunch of anti-freedom brainwashed scum and thugs over there.
[02:00:56.735 --> 02:01:03.938]  BBC Studios and Television Centre in West London were targeted by an agitated group of protesters opposing the government's COVID-19 plans.
[02:01:03.938 --> 02:01:08.579]  The crowd attempted to break into the building, causing clashes with police.
[02:01:08.579 --> 02:01:12.681]  Imagine in the old days when we were freedom fighters.
[02:01:12.681 --> 02:01:24.905]  If the government was trying to give you an experimental shot linked to all these deaths, that doesn't even protect you from a supposed virus, they now admit, and they wanted to give you a world ID to track everywhere you went so you couldn't buy or sell if you didn't have it.
[02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:31.663]  I would expect people to protest that.
[02:01:31.663 --> 02:01:36.647]  I would expect people to say no to that.
[02:01:36.647 --> 02:01:38.148]  We're busy bleeping the video.
[02:01:38.148 --> 02:01:40.490]  We'll have more of that for you at the bottom of the hour.
[02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:41.952]  This is happening all over the world.
[02:01:43.752 --> 02:01:55.899]  We salute the individual saying no to this bondage, to this real tyranny, and standing up to the pedophile protecting thugs that are the law enforcement of the UK that are a disgrace to the planet.
[02:01:55.899 --> 02:01:58.181]  Same thing with Australia and the rest of them.
[02:01:58.181 --> 02:02:02.243]  I'm not saying every officer, but the leadership is evil.
[02:02:02.243 --> 02:02:05.805]  You find out about a 10-year-old girl kidnapped and given rape by Muslims, they'll come and arrest you.
[02:02:05.805 --> 02:02:07.306]  I mean, they are bad people.
[02:02:08.097 --> 02:02:09.137]  Because they protect evil.
[02:02:09.137 --> 02:02:10.338]  That's who they are.
[02:02:10.338 --> 02:02:12.839]  A police force run by evil is a very bad thing.
[02:02:12.839 --> 02:02:16.841]  The Democrats want full control of the police here, and they're close.
[02:02:16.841 --> 02:02:19.522]  Those that fetishize the police, look out.
[02:02:19.522 --> 02:02:23.643]  Once they go under globalist control, they're just like a North Korean police officer.
[02:02:23.643 --> 02:02:25.184]  They're bad.
[02:02:25.184 --> 02:02:27.365]  All right, let's go ahead and take more calls.
[02:02:27.365 --> 02:02:30.126]  We've got loaded phones here.
[02:02:30.126 --> 02:02:35.008]  Almost every caller either had a heart issue themselves, or their friends or family had heart issues.
[02:02:35.008 --> 02:02:37.169]  And that's what's in the literature, that it causes heart issues.
[02:02:38.373 --> 02:02:42.674]  And again, my long-term, six years I've had this nanny work for us, great lady.
[02:02:42.674 --> 02:02:55.419]  Her best friend's sister's husband, New York, 37 years old, good shape, took the second shot of Pfizer, died of a swollen heart, took two days for him to die.
[02:02:55.419 --> 02:03:03.661]  But then when you talk about it, oh, it's a conspiracy theory, even though in the fine print, just like we just put on screen, CNBC, they admit it.
[02:03:03.661 --> 02:03:04.662]  So, we're gonna go to
[02:03:07.193 --> 02:03:10.975]  Let's go to Josh in Connecticut first, then Scott, then others.
[02:03:10.975 --> 02:03:13.097]  Josh, you're on the air.
[02:03:13.097 --> 02:03:15.418]  Welcome, and tell us what happened.
[02:03:15.418 --> 02:03:16.799]  I just want to put a plug in, too.
[02:03:16.799 --> 02:03:19.641]  Also, man, the sticker game is where it is at.
[02:03:19.641 --> 02:03:24.684]  I run across people all the time that see your sticker that I put up, and they say yes.
[02:03:24.684 --> 02:03:29.007]  But I just want to talk about my father and my mother-in-law.
[02:03:29.007 --> 02:03:34.350]  They just had her father go into the hospital, die of pneumonia.
[02:03:34.350 --> 02:03:36.572]  As she was leaving, when he passed away,
[02:03:37.085 --> 02:03:43.190]  The doctor said to her, if he was vaccinated, he would have survived.
[02:03:43.190 --> 02:03:45.912]  It completely destroyed her.
[02:03:45.912 --> 02:03:48.034]  My father could not even handle it.
[02:03:48.034 --> 02:03:53.058]  So what he's doing, this is what people need to do, get them to put it in writing.
[02:03:53.058 --> 02:03:53.799]  Put it in writing.
[02:03:54.198 --> 02:03:55.519]  Make it nice and calm to them.
[02:03:55.519 --> 02:03:56.719]  You just want to get it in writing.
[02:03:56.719 --> 02:03:57.920]  What's the prognosis?
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:01.582]  I'll take whatever prognosis you say, but get them to put it in writing.
[02:04:01.582 --> 02:04:05.324]  And then we build the administrative process and we sue the pants off them.
[02:04:05.324 --> 02:04:07.866]  I just want to thank you, Alex, for everything that you've done.
[02:04:07.866 --> 02:04:08.206]  Oh, yeah.
[02:04:08.206 --> 02:04:11.828]  They're alive that if you have the vaccine, you won't die of anything.
[02:04:11.828 --> 02:04:15.150]  But everybody, mainly most people getting sick and dying, have had the vaccine.
[02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:18.892]  And that's really the news.
[02:04:18.892 --> 02:04:19.913]  I want to say one more thing.
[02:04:20.896 --> 02:04:23.697]  I'm probably gonna get in trouble for this, but I work in box stores.
[02:04:23.697 --> 02:04:26.478]  I've been in the box stores every day for the entire pandemic.
[02:04:26.478 --> 02:04:28.119]  Multiple, multiple, multiple ones.
[02:04:28.119 --> 02:04:28.699]  Multiple ones.
[02:04:28.699 --> 02:04:31.200]  Never washed my hands, never wore a mask.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:34.041]  Hey, and I'm still here, and I'm not even healthy.
[02:04:34.041 --> 02:04:35.821]  Just putting that out there.
[02:04:35.821 --> 02:04:36.582]  God bless you, brother.
[02:04:36.582 --> 02:04:42.884]  I shook, but I'm not tipping fake, because there's real pneumonia and real flu out there, and I've had family die of pneumonia and stuff years ago.
[02:04:43.837 --> 02:04:47.118]  But I shook tens of thousands of hands last year and this year.
[02:04:47.118 --> 02:04:54.122]  I went to all these giant rallies with hundreds of thousands of people, millions at one rally over a million, and I haven't been sick.
[02:04:54.122 --> 02:05:10.469]  And so I chalk that up to being healthy and taking a lot of vitamins and minerals because back before I got on vitamins and minerals nine years ago, I was still pretty healthy, but if I went to a big symposium and shook like a thousand hands, had like an event with 2,000 people, I would get sick a lot of times.
[02:05:11.431 --> 02:05:13.372]  That was one reason I didn't have a lot of big events.
[02:05:13.372 --> 02:05:14.673]  I had events in 2005, 2006, 2008.
[02:05:14.673 --> 02:05:22.457]  I would have events with 2,000, 3,000 people, but I would shake thousands of hands.
[02:05:22.457 --> 02:05:25.019]  I'd forget to wash my hands, eat a hamburger, boom, I'd get sick.
[02:05:25.019 --> 02:05:27.400]  I mean, there's real stuff out there.
[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:30.062]  Now, I shake even more hands as it happens.
[02:05:30.062 --> 02:05:35.005]  And knock on wood, it's God and the rest of it, but yeah.
[02:05:35.005 --> 02:05:37.806]  Look, you don't know whether you really had COVID or not.
[02:05:37.806 --> 02:05:38.807]  All these tests are fake.
[02:05:40.097 --> 02:05:41.478]  Let's go ahead and go to more calls.
[02:05:41.478 --> 02:05:43.279]  Scott, in Ohio, tell us your story.
[02:05:43.279 --> 02:05:44.319]  Thanks for calling.
[02:05:44.319 --> 02:05:47.881]  Yeah, Alex, good to talk to you, finally.
[02:05:47.881 --> 02:05:55.224]  Actually, yeah, my brother, even though I warned him not to take it, he called me one day and said, I just got my second shot.
[02:05:55.224 --> 02:05:58.046]  For the next five days, he was on the verge of calling 911.
[02:05:58.046 --> 02:06:05.069]  And I got to hang out with him for a couple days the other day, and he's not even the same person.
[02:06:05.069 --> 02:06:06.450]  He's very, he's changed.
[02:06:07.478 --> 02:06:12.620]  He's all anxious and just, he's not my brother anymore.
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:14.541]  For sure.
[02:06:14.541 --> 02:06:17.202]  I see on the screen that he had heart issues?
[02:06:17.202 --> 02:06:18.583]  Yeah, yep.
[02:06:18.583 --> 02:06:24.365]  He was having real bad chest pains and breathing trouble for those four or five days.
[02:06:24.365 --> 02:06:28.366]  That's what caused him to almost call 911 a few times.
[02:06:28.366 --> 02:06:30.347]  And how old's your brother?
[02:06:30.347 --> 02:06:32.488]  He's 53.
[02:06:32.488 --> 02:06:33.749]  And no smoke.
[02:06:33.749 --> 02:06:34.949]  He doesn't smoke cigarettes.
[02:06:34.949 --> 02:06:36.710]  An athlete and real in shape.
[02:06:39.495 --> 02:06:40.415]  It's changed him.
[02:06:40.415 --> 02:06:41.976]  I don't even know who he is anymore.
[02:06:41.976 --> 02:06:43.396]  What does he think of the shots now?
[02:06:43.396 --> 02:06:44.777]  Is he going to get the quote, booster?
[02:06:44.777 --> 02:06:46.337]  No.
[02:06:46.337 --> 02:06:48.198]  He apologized to me.
[02:06:48.198 --> 02:06:50.399]  He actually said he wished you had listened.
[02:06:50.399 --> 02:06:54.240]  And he's just going to hold on and hope for the best, you know.
[02:06:54.240 --> 02:06:56.941]  But the important thing is he's in the Lamb's Book of Life.
[02:06:56.941 --> 02:06:59.362]  So if it doesn't kill him, we know where he's going.
[02:06:59.362 --> 02:06:59.922]  Absolutely.
[02:06:59.922 --> 02:07:00.463]  God bless you.
[02:07:00.463 --> 02:07:02.343]  Well, just tell him to warn others now he knows the truth.
[02:07:05.017 --> 02:07:11.221]  The first man to take the COVID shot died two months later, and the second woman to take it is now dead.
[02:07:11.221 --> 02:07:13.363]  It's not folks who want to know that.
[02:07:13.363 --> 02:07:15.424]  That fell on screen there for TV viewers, he died.
[02:07:15.424 --> 02:07:22.449]  Two months after the shot.
[02:07:22.449 --> 02:07:25.411]  William Shakespeare was his actual name, yep.
[02:07:25.411 --> 02:07:31.095]  All right, let's go to... James in Florida.
[02:07:31.095 --> 02:07:32.456]  James, go ahead, then we'll go to Will.
[02:07:34.153 --> 02:07:37.217]  Alex, first I gotta give my plug in for Survival Shield.
[02:07:37.217 --> 02:07:39.139]  Survival Shield saved my life.
[02:07:39.139 --> 02:07:46.628]  I was Obama voting liberal and now I am an info warrior who is fully awake and waking up the masses, so thank you for that.
[02:07:46.628 --> 02:07:47.169]  Thank God!
[02:07:47.745 --> 02:07:49.646]  For you and InfoWars and Survival Field.
[02:07:49.646 --> 02:07:50.426]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:50.426 --> 02:07:51.166]  Well thanks to you.
[02:07:51.166 --> 02:07:53.467]  And I want to just say this about Obama voting liberals.
[02:07:53.467 --> 02:07:57.148]  I was neutral on Obama's first run because I didn't like John McCain.
[02:07:57.148 --> 02:07:58.669]  I wasn't for Obama either.
[02:07:58.669 --> 02:08:01.630]  So I get as bad as Republicans are why people were Democrats.
[02:08:01.630 --> 02:08:06.031]  But now we know the Rhino Republicans are bad and the Democrat leadership are bad.
[02:08:06.031 --> 02:08:07.152]  They're the globalists.
[02:08:07.152 --> 02:08:08.552]  And all I want is populists.
[02:08:08.552 --> 02:08:10.713]  I don't care if they're Democrats or Republicans.
[02:08:10.713 --> 02:08:12.514]  I just want populist pro-human people.
[02:08:12.514 --> 02:08:12.774]  Go ahead.
[02:08:13.931 --> 02:08:14.411]  Amen, brother.
[02:08:14.411 --> 02:08:16.072]  So I'm going to start with the bad news.
[02:08:16.072 --> 02:08:21.015]  The bad news is I had a lot of family members who took this vaccine and they're all starting to get sick.
[02:08:21.015 --> 02:08:24.597]  My wife's father and mother are both having heart problems.
[02:08:24.597 --> 02:08:33.943]  He is having heart palpitations and my wife's mother was having some heart issues that caused her to go to the hospital.
[02:08:33.943 --> 02:08:34.944]  That was on my wife's side.
[02:08:34.944 --> 02:08:40.107]  My grandmother just got out of the hospital because she had a blood clot in her heart.
[02:08:41.210 --> 02:08:45.034]  Um, so, you know, this is, she's 86 years old.
[02:08:45.034 --> 02:08:46.235]  I love my grandmother.
[02:08:46.235 --> 02:08:53.442]  I don't want her to die, you know, but part of me wants my family to wake up, you know, for something to happen because they're still asleep.
[02:08:53.442 --> 02:08:56.124]  All the people who have taken the vaccine are asleep.
[02:08:56.124 --> 02:08:59.487]  But the good news is the other half of my family is awake.
[02:08:59.487 --> 02:09:03.531]  When I first got awake in 2009, um, it was me and my brother.
[02:09:03.531 --> 02:09:06.874]  We were the only game in town when it came to actually knowing the truth and for worse.
[02:09:07.423 --> 02:09:09.986]  But now half my family is awake.
[02:09:09.986 --> 02:09:11.388]  They're fully awake.
[02:09:11.388 --> 02:09:15.933]  My dad is like texting me going, do you hear about SM-108 and the vaccines and Brazine?
[02:09:15.933 --> 02:09:19.937]  And so like he, you know, this is good news.
[02:09:19.937 --> 02:09:22.580]  Like we actually, this is the great awakening, brother.
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:23.862]  This is what's happening right now.
[02:09:24.571 --> 02:09:26.553]  The entire world is waking up to this, man.
[02:09:26.553 --> 02:09:27.373]  Hold on, don't hang up.
[02:09:27.373 --> 02:09:30.176]  I want to hear more about this with James than others on the other side.
[02:09:30.176 --> 02:09:32.858]  But yes, the globalists are making their big move.
[02:09:32.858 --> 02:09:34.980]  This is the Great Awakening.
[02:09:34.980 --> 02:09:41.606]  And so we've all got to work harder than ever to wake others up because it'll make it go faster before this turns into total war.
[02:09:41.606 --> 02:09:44.328]  Believe me, I've looked at every angle of this.
[02:09:44.328 --> 02:09:46.190]  This is pure depopulation.
[02:09:46.190 --> 02:09:48.732]  They are making their fabled move.
[02:09:48.732 --> 02:09:49.873]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[02:09:54.827 --> 02:10:03.254]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[02:10:03.254 --> 02:10:04.275]  Here's why.
[02:10:04.275 --> 02:10:08.198]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[02:10:08.198 --> 02:10:13.323]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[02:10:13.323 --> 02:10:21.730]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:30.283]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[02:10:30.985 --> 02:10:37.090]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses too!
[02:10:37.090 --> 02:10:40.913]  Go to MySolarBackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[02:10:40.913 --> 02:10:42.935]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:10:42.935 --> 02:10:51.342]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[02:10:51.342 --> 02:10:53.704]  Yours free at MySolarBackup.com.
[02:10:54.301 --> 02:10:55.242]  Hey everybody.
[02:10:55.242 --> 02:11:00.747]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great news.
[02:11:00.747 --> 02:11:03.210]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[02:11:03.210 --> 02:11:04.051]  Here's the thing.
[02:11:04.051 --> 02:11:08.355]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans.
[02:11:08.355 --> 02:11:09.296]  Survival soup beans.
[02:11:09.676 --> 02:11:17.879]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever, the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[02:11:17.879 --> 02:11:18.980]  The best part?
[02:11:18.980 --> 02:11:28.264]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[02:11:28.264 --> 02:11:28.924]  Gets even better!
[02:11:29.284 --> 02:11:40.055]  With your permission, and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the world.
[02:11:40.055 --> 02:11:40.876]  Period.
[02:11:40.876 --> 02:11:42.918]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:11:42.918 --> 02:11:45.060]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:49.164]  And discover the real reason we're giving this unusual superfood away.
[02:11:49.164 --> 02:11:51.046]  At soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:11:51.046 --> 02:11:52.908]  That's soupbeansurvival.com.
[02:11:56.044 --> 02:11:59.768]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[02:11:59.768 --> 02:12:03.493]  Hell, I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[02:12:03.493 --> 02:12:10.781]  But let me tell you, the New World Order's breathing down our neck, the big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:12:11.141 --> 02:12:16.887]  So please pray to keep InfoWars on the air and please support the local station you're listening to as well.
[02:12:16.887 --> 02:12:29.121]  At the same time, go to InfoWarsStore.com while you still can and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get some supplements because it's that money that helps us stay on air in the face of this thing.
[02:12:29.121 --> 02:12:29.842]  I need your help.
[02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:35.364]  More than ever now, I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[02:12:35.364 --> 02:12:45.967]  So, pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast however you can, and buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:12:45.967 --> 02:12:55.490]  Whether it's high quality coffee, or supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:56.130]  Thank you so much.
[02:13:00.197 --> 02:13:01.438]  Jacob in Ohio.
[02:13:01.438 --> 02:13:02.258]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:13:02.258 --> 02:13:03.579]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:13:03.579 --> 02:13:04.159]  Good, Bob.
[02:13:04.159 --> 02:13:05.239]  Great last caller.
[02:13:05.239 --> 02:13:08.281]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[02:13:08.281 --> 02:13:13.983]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, demoralization, and absurdity.
[02:13:13.983 --> 02:13:15.784]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone, man.
[02:13:16.064 --> 02:13:17.786]  All right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[02:13:17.786 --> 02:13:18.706]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[02:13:18.706 --> 02:13:19.107]  Go ahead.
[02:13:19.107 --> 02:13:19.507]  Hey, Alex.
[02:13:19.507 --> 02:13:20.628]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:13:20.628 --> 02:13:23.671]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[02:13:23.671 --> 02:13:25.332]  The X Team does wonders.
[02:13:25.332 --> 02:13:26.494]  I recommend it to everybody.
[02:13:26.494 --> 02:13:28.455]  If you're on the fence about it, get off the fence.
[02:13:28.455 --> 02:13:29.336]  Get the product.
[02:13:29.336 --> 02:13:30.537]  Support the InfoWars.
[02:13:30.537 --> 02:13:31.838]  Tyler in Maine.
[02:13:31.838 --> 02:13:32.479]  You're on the air.
[02:13:32.479 --> 02:13:33.039]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:33.039 --> 02:13:33.420]  Go ahead.
[02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:34.040]  Hey, Alex.
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:35.181]  It's great to be on with you.
[02:13:35.181 --> 02:13:35.682]  It's an honor.
[02:13:35.882 --> 02:13:36.682]  I'm honored to talk to you.
[02:13:36.682 --> 02:13:37.823]  Awesome.
[02:13:37.823 --> 02:13:43.246]  So, first thing I wanted to do is to say I love the product Alpha Power, even at 29.
[02:13:43.246 --> 02:13:47.349]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom.
[02:13:47.349 --> 02:13:48.930]  So, just number one for viewers.
[02:13:48.930 --> 02:13:50.010]  Well, it definitely works.
[02:13:50.010 --> 02:13:51.631]  It's not a joke.
[02:13:51.631 --> 02:13:58.815]  Absolutely.
[02:13:58.815 --> 02:14:01.437]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:12.256 --> 02:14:16.840]  The answer to 1984 tyranny and suppression is 1776.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:17.881]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:14:21.172 --> 02:14:22.993]  And I'm going to go back to your phone calls right now.
[02:14:22.993 --> 02:14:29.198]  I was thinking this weekend when I worked quite a bit, you saw that four hour special transmission we put out.
[02:14:29.198 --> 02:14:30.679]  That was just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:14:30.679 --> 02:14:32.780]  And I'm proud to do it.
[02:14:32.780 --> 02:14:38.644]  It's just that when I don't get some weekend, I kind of get exhausted on Monday and I'm in a really bad mood.
[02:14:38.644 --> 02:14:43.688]  And I also did three hours of accounting on Sunday.
[02:14:43.688 --> 02:14:47.691]  I did an hour on Saturday and three hours on Sunday.
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:54.362]  And it just takes so much money to run all this independent systems, especially under attack.
[02:14:54.362 --> 02:15:00.184]  And that's why God has always chosen to give me just enough to operate, and that's the way it works.
[02:15:00.184 --> 02:15:01.605]  I literally started praying six months ago.
[02:15:01.605 --> 02:15:06.066]  I said, God, I want to just fight the evil and expose the tyranny.
[02:15:06.066 --> 02:15:07.447]  Can you just get me more money?
[02:15:09.005 --> 02:15:14.529]  And then a few things fell on our lap that actually gave us a little bit of gas in the tank, so we're not on empty constantly.
[02:15:14.529 --> 02:15:23.576]  So thank you, God, for answering the prayer, and thank you for God working through you to support us, because I could do so much if I just had more money.
[02:15:23.576 --> 02:15:30.961]  And I'd like to give the crew an occasional raise or a bonus for all the things, or be able to hire more people.
[02:15:30.961 --> 02:15:32.763]  It just comes down to stuff like that.
[02:15:34.935 --> 02:15:37.236]  And now, especially that we know we were right about everything.
[02:15:37.236 --> 02:15:43.317]  I mean, I knew they were going to pull this, but it's one thing, again, to know something and another thing to have it happen.
[02:15:43.317 --> 02:15:50.459]  It's like, I'm using the analogy of you drive through the green light and you notice somebody ran a red light and you see the car going like 60 miles an hour.
[02:15:50.459 --> 02:15:51.099]  This has happened to me.
[02:15:51.099 --> 02:15:52.239]  It's happened to others.
[02:15:52.239 --> 02:15:54.280]  It's probably happened to you.
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:56.120]  And you're like, oh God, they ran a light.
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:16:02.062]  All of a sudden, you know, your neck's hurt and you're bleeding and you're just glad you're alive.
[02:16:03.132 --> 02:16:04.393]  And that's where I'm at.
[02:16:04.393 --> 02:16:07.115]  We used to see the car coming, it's like, oh God, there it is!
[02:16:07.115 --> 02:16:08.356]  And now, boom!
[02:16:08.356 --> 02:16:10.118]  We're just like spinning right now.
[02:16:10.118 --> 02:16:12.800]  And I know you're spinning, I'm spinning.
[02:16:12.800 --> 02:16:13.880]  Just get right with God.
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:20.906]  Like the caller earlier said, he said, hey, my brother may be really sick, he may die now of a heart attack from the shot, but at least he's got the blood of the lamb.
[02:16:20.906 --> 02:16:24.268]  And that's not some cheesy thing I say to reach out to Christians.
[02:16:24.268 --> 02:16:25.129]  I am a Christian.
[02:16:25.129 --> 02:16:26.570]  That's all I've got, man.
[02:16:26.570 --> 02:16:27.611]  I couldn't do this without God.
[02:16:30.171 --> 02:16:34.255]  And God's discernment and vengeance is God's, because the violence is coming.
[02:16:34.255 --> 02:16:36.317]  They're already violently assaulting us with a shot.
[02:16:36.317 --> 02:16:37.619]  This is a war.
[02:16:37.619 --> 02:16:41.703]  But we've got to be as wise as serpents, as peaceful as doves, like Moses said.
[02:16:42.768 --> 02:16:54.718]  And we've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, and just work super hard in the information war where we're really seeing a big bonanza, because that's really what matters is the minds of men and women.
[02:16:54.718 --> 02:16:58.961]  And understand, you could kill Fauci, you could kill Bill Gates, which I'm not saying do.
[02:16:58.961 --> 02:17:00.022]  Don't do that.
[02:17:00.022 --> 02:17:06.307]  That would turn them into victims and heroes, and they've got people just as bad behind them like shark teeth.
[02:17:06.307 --> 02:17:07.448]  It's Satan doing it.
[02:17:08.717 --> 02:17:12.879]  That doesn't mean in the future they come to grab you and take you away with four shots.
[02:17:12.879 --> 02:17:15.340]  That's zero hour.
[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:19.122]  That's the 1984 medical tyranny.
[02:17:19.122 --> 02:17:21.544]  You're not going to come back from that emergency center in many cases.
[02:17:21.544 --> 02:17:23.765]  They're going to stick a tube down your throat.
[02:17:23.765 --> 02:17:26.026]  It's going to be run by Antifa as the medical staff.
[02:17:26.026 --> 02:17:27.547]  And you're going to be dead.
[02:17:27.547 --> 02:17:29.628]  Contact tracers are Antifa.
[02:17:29.628 --> 02:17:31.209]  Not all of them, but the leadership.
[02:17:32.316 --> 02:17:35.360]  Uh, and so, and I'm not trying to scare you folks.
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:38.665]  I'm telling you exactly what's going on, exactly what I think's happening.
[02:17:38.665 --> 02:17:40.747]  In fact, it's probably way worse than I'm telling you.
[02:17:40.747 --> 02:17:44.612]  In fact, that's where I've really been inaccurate is I've been a very inaccurate person.
[02:17:44.612 --> 02:17:47.816]  Things have been worse than when I said, I'm not super accurate.
[02:17:47.816 --> 02:17:49.218]  My God, I've got all their own documents.
[02:17:49.218 --> 02:17:50.280]  I better know what I'm talking about.
[02:17:51.374 --> 02:17:52.874]  Alright, so I'm going to shut up and go back to your calls.
[02:17:52.874 --> 02:17:57.435]  It's just that the last call I talked about positive things happening, and yes they are.
[02:17:57.435 --> 02:18:01.876]  But we better understand that we've got to work super hard.
[02:18:01.876 --> 02:18:07.037]  Because imagine, if you're having to think about violence to defend yourself, which I know everybody is.
[02:18:07.037 --> 02:18:07.657]  That's where we are.
[02:18:07.657 --> 02:18:08.957]  That's completely normal.
[02:18:08.957 --> 02:18:14.318]  You're not bad for doing that.
[02:18:14.318 --> 02:18:16.699]  If you're having to already think about that in that position,
[02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:31.630]  Think about what's coming down the road and think about, well, okay, if I'm having to think about them coming and grabbing me and my family, if I'm having to not have a job, leave my house, go to the grocery store, and I got to watch my neighbors die that took it, my God, I'm in this.
[02:18:31.630 --> 02:18:32.151]  What have I bet?
[02:18:32.151 --> 02:18:33.972]  Well, you better do banner hangs on the highway.
[02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:35.333]  Like I saw a great photo.
[02:18:35.333 --> 02:18:36.594]  See if you guys can dig it out of the stack.
[02:18:39.189 --> 02:18:42.631]  I forgot to, people send me all this great stuff, I forget to show it.
[02:18:42.631 --> 02:18:44.872]  I want to honor the stuff you guys are doing.
[02:18:44.872 --> 02:18:47.294]  I'll also see Twitter accounts and Facebook accounts and stuff.
[02:18:47.294 --> 02:18:48.394]  They're doing a great job.
[02:18:48.394 --> 02:18:52.156]  And I never give you credit because they'll ban something the minute I give a credit.
[02:18:52.156 --> 02:19:01.901]  I saw some incredible Twitter accounts that were finding stuff I didn't even know was out there on the shots and around the world, the evidence, and I was really, really, really wanted to give them attention, but I couldn't because they'd get banned.
[02:19:01.901 --> 02:19:02.802]  It got banned regardless.
[02:19:04.795 --> 02:19:08.037]  Now that that account got banned, I can give it attention.
[02:19:08.037 --> 02:19:12.521]  It was, zoom in on this, it was, I'm gonna show all these.
[02:19:12.521 --> 02:19:17.064]  It was Camus, C-A-M-U-S, 37.
[02:19:17.064 --> 02:19:18.705]  Best Twitter site I ever saw.
[02:19:18.705 --> 02:19:22.208]  Nothing but mainline medical doctors and scientists exposing the truth.
[02:19:22.208 --> 02:19:26.691]  Banned for terms of service.
[02:19:26.691 --> 02:19:29.774]  Violation.
[02:19:29.774 --> 02:19:32.355]  And so, oh God, I said I got your calls.
[02:19:32.355 --> 02:19:34.057]  I'm just completely exhausted today.
[02:19:35.442 --> 02:19:36.643]  Um, I'm not complaining.
[02:19:36.643 --> 02:19:38.845]  I'm just very exhausted.
[02:19:38.845 --> 02:19:40.125]  So I've been doing a lot of deep thinking.
[02:19:40.125 --> 02:19:48.752]  I've had some major breakthroughs and I got a lot of stuff going and a lot of discernment has intensified.
[02:19:48.752 --> 02:19:51.974]  And I mean, I'm nothing but honest with you.
[02:19:51.974 --> 02:19:53.275]  I'm really freaked out.
[02:19:53.275 --> 02:19:55.877]  I'm really, really, really freaked out.
[02:19:55.877 --> 02:19:57.358]  And I know you're completely freaked out too.
[02:19:57.358 --> 02:20:00.880]  I can't believe they got this many of our fellow humans to go along with us.
[02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:02.661]  I can't believe they're doing all this stuff.
[02:20:02.661 --> 02:20:04.022]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[02:20:04.022 --> 02:20:04.843]  It's crazy.
[02:20:06.109 --> 02:20:13.591]  And you know it's all going to collapse, and these people are going to, in a year or two, I don't know, five years, most, billions are going to be dead!
[02:20:13.591 --> 02:20:16.252]  And they're still called citizens!
[02:20:16.252 --> 02:20:21.374]  And Leonardo DiCaprio and people go and hang out with Schwab and endorse all this?
[02:20:21.374 --> 02:20:24.535]  And smile about it like they're powerful?
[02:20:24.535 --> 02:20:25.575]  They love it!
[02:20:25.575 --> 02:20:28.796]  They love killing us!
[02:20:28.796 --> 02:20:33.178]  And they think it's funny!
[02:20:33.178 --> 02:20:34.098]  Well, I don't think it's funny.
[02:20:36.670 --> 02:20:41.832]  And if they had any discernment, they'd know how much danger they're in.
[02:20:41.832 --> 02:20:43.553]  Klaus Schwab thinks he's insulated from this?
[02:20:43.553 --> 02:20:45.473]  B.S.
[02:20:45.473 --> 02:20:47.354]  All these scum are going to pay.
[02:20:47.354 --> 02:20:49.315]  I know that.
[02:20:49.315 --> 02:20:50.735]  But vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord.
[02:20:50.735 --> 02:20:52.556]  All right, I'm going to stop ranting.
[02:20:52.556 --> 02:20:53.396]  James, finish your point.
[02:20:53.396 --> 02:20:54.016]  You're making a great point.
[02:20:54.016 --> 02:20:56.637]  You're saying, hey, you're seeing a giant awakening.
[02:20:56.637 --> 02:20:58.438]  Give us the good news.
[02:20:58.438 --> 02:20:59.058]  Absolutely.
[02:20:59.058 --> 02:21:03.680]  So not only has my family woken up, but it's reinvigorated me for the fight.
[02:21:04.198 --> 02:21:06.920]  So now I'm wearing those InfoWars shirts wherever I go.
[02:21:06.920 --> 02:21:08.961]  You know, I'm putting bumper stickers up.
[02:21:08.961 --> 02:21:11.963]  I'm doing the things necessary to warn other people about this.
[02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:12.923]  I'm sharing the links.
[02:21:12.923 --> 02:21:17.306]  I'm doing—it's really reinvigorated me in the fight.
[02:21:17.306 --> 02:21:24.710]  And, you know, you really touched on, Alex, you know, I feel really bad for you, because, you know, you take the brunt of all this, and you never hear any hope.
[02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:30.453]  And I pray to Jesus Christ that He gives you the comfort you need to get through this, the fight.
[02:21:30.453 --> 02:21:31.374]  But that's what we all need.
[02:21:31.374 --> 02:21:33.455]  We all need to seek God, get on our knees.
[02:21:34.088 --> 02:21:35.569]  And praise Him.
[02:21:35.569 --> 02:21:38.530]  Even in the bad, we need to praise Him.
[02:21:38.530 --> 02:21:39.031]  Right?
[02:21:39.031 --> 02:21:44.653]  This is the valley of the shadow of death that we're going through, but with Him is all comfort.
[02:21:44.653 --> 02:21:45.134]  Right?
[02:21:45.134 --> 02:21:48.815]  Does the Lord's Prayer not speak to what's happening now?
[02:21:48.815 --> 02:21:49.416]  Absolutely.
[02:21:49.416 --> 02:21:50.076]  Psalm 23, as well.
[02:21:52.523 --> 02:21:56.367]  Well, God does give me comfort.
[02:21:56.367 --> 02:21:59.189]  It's just having to focus on this, which we need to focus on.
[02:21:59.189 --> 02:22:01.732]  It's just looking at these globals.
[02:22:01.732 --> 02:22:02.993]  I can't even look at Fauci.
[02:22:02.993 --> 02:22:03.914]  I can't look at Hillary.
[02:22:03.914 --> 02:22:05.715]  You know what I mean?
[02:22:05.715 --> 02:22:07.537]  I just can't do it.
[02:22:07.537 --> 02:22:08.217]  I know, I know.
[02:22:08.217 --> 02:22:14.223]  I see, I mean, the discernment that I have, you know, so one of the things that happened with Survival Shield
[02:22:14.696 --> 02:22:15.296]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:22:39.205 --> 02:22:44.654]  And he said, just take this and in about 15 days to three weeks, you're going to really feel better.
[02:22:44.654 --> 02:22:46.437]  You'll feel toxic in about 15 days.
[02:22:46.437 --> 02:22:47.799]  Everything he said happened.
[02:22:47.799 --> 02:22:51.384]  And yes, it absolutely opened my mind up to a higher level.
[02:22:51.384 --> 02:22:52.226]  Just stay there.
[02:22:56.428 --> 02:23:03.195]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on.
[02:23:03.195 --> 02:23:06.779]  And that is criminals are extremely pathological.
[02:23:06.779 --> 02:23:07.940]  Even more the general public.
[02:23:07.940 --> 02:23:10.303]  They do the same things over and over again.
[02:23:10.303 --> 02:23:14.748]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[02:23:15.899 --> 02:23:16.740]  Well, guess what?
[02:23:16.740 --> 02:23:30.728]  It was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist globalist, that ran the rollout of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more people than HIV, and they were the ones involved in viral research.
[02:23:31.929 --> 02:23:37.430]  of viruses that would actually go attack the T lymphocytes of the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[02:23:37.430 --> 02:23:43.792]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road.
[02:23:43.792 --> 02:23:52.233]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[02:23:52.233 --> 02:23:54.154]  That's right ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:55.421 --> 02:23:57.802]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[02:23:57.802 --> 02:23:59.542]  It's very bittersweet.
[02:23:59.542 --> 02:24:02.523]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[02:24:02.523 --> 02:24:03.783]  And now we have a lot of credibility.
[02:24:03.783 --> 02:24:04.703]  But I don't care about that.
[02:24:04.703 --> 02:24:06.764]  I care about beating the new world order.
[02:24:06.764 --> 02:24:11.445]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[02:24:11.445 --> 02:24:14.805]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons.
[02:24:14.805 --> 02:24:16.326]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[02:24:16.326 --> 02:24:17.326]  But let's just say this.
[02:24:17.506 --> 02:24:18.827]  We're going to see this through to the end.
[02:24:18.827 --> 02:24:21.928]  We're going to stay on air as long as we can.
[02:24:21.928 --> 02:24:25.570]  So please pray for us and please buy the products at MFortWorthStore.com.
[02:24:25.570 --> 02:24:28.131]  They're great products, plus they fund the operation.
[02:24:28.131 --> 02:24:31.332]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[02:24:31.332 --> 02:24:32.173]  Do they fund freedom?
[02:24:32.173 --> 02:24:33.293]  No, a lot of them don't.
[02:24:33.293 --> 02:24:39.736]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[02:24:39.736 --> 02:24:41.157]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[02:24:41.457 --> 02:24:44.879]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[02:24:44.879 --> 02:24:48.000]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:55.144]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it, because who knows how long we're going to be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[02:24:55.939 --> 02:25:05.289]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[02:25:05.289 --> 02:25:11.014]  With promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[02:25:11.014 --> 02:25:11.675]  It's an amazing deal.
[02:25:11.715 --> 02:25:12.275]  It's an amazing deal.
[02:25:12.275 --> 02:25:15.238]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[02:25:15.238 --> 02:25:21.803]  You can get my games and dream sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[02:25:21.803 --> 02:25:27.468]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[02:25:27.468 --> 02:25:30.010]  Myself, I need this for the Cyber Symposium.
[02:25:30.010 --> 02:25:33.393]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[02:25:33.393 --> 02:25:35.254]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[02:25:35.254 --> 02:25:37.316]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[02:25:37.316 --> 02:25:40.639]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[02:25:41.019 --> 02:25:44.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:26:10.523 --> 02:26:12.706]  You look like an angel.
[02:26:12.706 --> 02:26:14.209]  Walk like an angel.
[02:26:14.209 --> 02:26:17.173]  Talk like an angel.
[02:26:17.173 --> 02:26:18.936]  But I got one.
[02:26:28.032 --> 02:26:42.307]  Alright, there's a lot of big breaking news right now, but I want to go through your calls first, and I'm going to take 15 minutes the next hour from the great Gerald Cilente to play an amazing video in Indiana of a medical doctor schooling everybody at the city council.
[02:26:42.307 --> 02:26:44.470]  And look, he's not going to save the world with what he did, but...
[02:26:46.010 --> 02:26:47.691]  All of us doing stuff like that will.
[02:26:47.691 --> 02:26:56.876]  You understand, you gotta use school boards, county commissioners, legislatures, live show feeds, C-SPAN, my show, every show.
[02:26:56.876 --> 02:27:05.141]  You gotta spend a large portion of your time, and I get it folks, I don't like to go grandstand in front of a city council.
[02:27:05.141 --> 02:27:07.522]  I gotta do it though.
[02:27:07.522 --> 02:27:13.265]  And our own crew, Owen and John Bell and others, they go down to the city council on their own, and a lot of people see it.
[02:27:13.265 --> 02:27:13.646]  I do it.
[02:27:14.992 --> 02:27:21.419]  You've got to make it what you do to save lives and expose these people who are in an info war.
[02:27:21.419 --> 02:27:24.403]  They are betting everything on censorship.
[02:27:24.403 --> 02:27:26.425]  Well, what do you do when they censor everybody you know?
[02:27:26.425 --> 02:27:27.567]  Well, you just start speaking up.
[02:27:28.063 --> 02:27:32.085]  And you're like, well, I'm an old lady, or I'm a young man, or I'm a whatever, who am I?
[02:27:32.085 --> 02:27:32.945]  You're somebody.
[02:27:32.945 --> 02:27:34.926]  The fact that you're awake and listening to this show.
[02:27:34.926 --> 02:27:36.167]  And I get it, I'm just like you.
[02:27:36.167 --> 02:27:44.031]  I don't want to go around grandstanding, I don't want attention, but if they want an information war, then we better make noise, folks!
[02:27:44.031 --> 02:27:46.652]  It's time to get out of our comfort zones and get it done.
[02:27:46.652 --> 02:27:53.456]  Because now they're not going to let you go to the bank, or to the grocery store, or to church, or down the road, but the border's wide open, screw them!
[02:27:53.456 --> 02:27:55.577]  I'm going to shut up now, we've got loaded phones, and I apologize.
[02:27:56.397 --> 02:27:59.139]  I was good at getting the calls at first, and I've been stuck on James.
[02:27:59.139 --> 02:28:01.580]  But James, start over and explain.
[02:28:01.580 --> 02:28:02.701]  I don't know.
[02:28:02.701 --> 02:28:03.862]  The whole global program...
[02:28:05.069 --> 02:28:12.115]  He's obsessed with our mind and the pineal gland and these rods and cones in the brain have been proven to be able to pick up magnetic lines.
[02:28:12.115 --> 02:28:16.639]  It's how the geese can fly thousands of miles from Florida to Central America.
[02:28:16.639 --> 02:28:18.601]  It's how butterflies can do it.
[02:28:18.601 --> 02:28:20.463]  It's how all of this operates.
[02:28:20.463 --> 02:28:28.450]  They've proven and they know that fluoride, not calcium fluoride, but hydrofluorosilic, gums that up along with bromine.
[02:28:29.591 --> 02:28:36.437]  All the other bromide, the whole family of chloride is, fluoride is very, very bad.
[02:28:36.437 --> 02:28:38.960]  Fluoride, salt, sorry, fluoride.
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:43.444]  And so, the good one is iodine, but most of that's bound up in things.
[02:28:43.444 --> 02:28:45.165]  Yeah, we sell it, that's not why.
[02:28:45.165 --> 02:28:50.330]  You can buy high quality Himalayan salt, make sure it's registered and it does have a good iodine source.
[02:28:50.330 --> 02:28:52.772]  It's close to atomic, you will absorb a lot of it.
[02:28:52.772 --> 02:28:53.533]  It's excellent as well.
[02:28:53.533 --> 02:28:54.074]  Whatever you do,
[02:28:54.734 --> 02:28:59.756]  It literally cleared my skin up, made me have the libido of when I was 16 years old again.
[02:28:59.756 --> 02:29:00.316]  Still got it.
[02:29:00.316 --> 02:29:01.036]  It's crazy.
[02:29:01.036 --> 02:29:05.317]  My libido had gone down until I got on X2 nine years ago.
[02:29:05.317 --> 02:29:06.838]  And I'm not trying to talk about libido.
[02:29:06.838 --> 02:29:10.919]  It's just that's when you really notice about a week into being on and I'm like, what the hell?
[02:29:11.519 --> 02:29:15.501]  You know, old Fred just got a lot, you know, a lot larger.
[02:29:15.501 --> 02:29:21.704]  So that's an example of what's going on in your body, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:29:21.704 --> 02:29:24.085]  And I've not named my male member, folks.
[02:29:24.085 --> 02:29:24.646]  That's a joke.
[02:29:24.646 --> 02:29:28.267]  The point is, is that, I guess his name is Fred now.
[02:29:28.267 --> 02:29:33.410]  Maybe Darth Vader is a better name, but the point is, the point is, is that all of this is going on and happening.
[02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:36.091]  So I'm going to stop joking around.
[02:29:36.091 --> 02:29:38.352]  When I'm tired, I do joke around more and I apologize.
[02:29:38.352 --> 02:29:39.493]  Go ahead, James, and finish your story.
[02:29:40.526 --> 02:29:59.916]  Yep, so when I first started taking Survival Shield, basically I was 275 pounds, I was overweight, I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe, I was barely holding on to a job, and I heard Dr. Grip on your show and I listened to it, you know, and so the first one I got was the original Survival Shield, the X1, right?
[02:29:59.916 --> 02:30:09.761]  And it worked pretty good, and then shortly thereafter you came out with X2, you know, with a deeper source, you know, and I got really excited about that, so I took it, and man, in two weeks,
[02:30:10.282 --> 02:30:18.366]  I went from brain fog to literally my brain was enlightened.
[02:30:18.366 --> 02:30:19.687]  I could think again.
[02:30:19.687 --> 02:30:21.868]  I could connect with people again.
[02:30:21.868 --> 02:30:25.850]  I wasn't so downtrodden and depressed anymore.
[02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:33.394]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I gave my life to Jesus Christ, and I lost 100 pounds.
[02:30:33.394 --> 02:30:34.355]  I got my health back.
[02:30:34.355 --> 02:30:36.216]  And I've done other things, too.
[02:30:36.216 --> 02:30:38.517]  I got the ProPure.
[02:30:38.985 --> 02:30:39.325]  I think so.
[02:31:05.441 --> 02:31:08.004]  But anyway, so the point is, we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:31:08.004 --> 02:31:16.995]  We have to break free of the globalist system, and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:31:16.995 --> 02:31:18.076]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:31:18.076 --> 02:31:21.560]  I thank you so much for your call, and Godspeed.
[02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:23.042]  Let me just say this in closing.
[02:31:23.042 --> 02:31:25.224]  I'm the worst person about taking my own advice.
[02:31:26.044 --> 02:31:35.707]  I was literally over here taking, I got X3 on the counter here, taking some X2, X3, remembering, oh, it's been about a week since I took it because I've never been a supplement guy.
[02:31:35.707 --> 02:31:39.688]  When I remember to take the fish oil, when I remember to take the tumor, when I remember to take the X2, it doesn't.
[02:31:39.688 --> 02:31:46.330]  But I didn't mean to get off on a plug, but people want to talk about this because it really is that incredible.
[02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:48.870]  Your body needs clean iodine.
[02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:50.011]  And like he said, the first X1,
[02:31:51.598 --> 02:31:51.798]  Let's go.
[02:32:06.741 --> 02:32:08.723]  To the Deep Earth Crystal.
[02:32:08.723 --> 02:32:14.107]  He had to get a DEA license to store it and everything, because it's a controlled substance by itself.
[02:32:14.107 --> 02:32:17.550]  I mean, crystals of this, you put it on a table, it just turns into gas in front of you.
[02:32:17.550 --> 02:32:18.751]  It'll eat holes in things.
[02:32:18.751 --> 02:32:25.017]  But when they put it through a proprietary process that's patented by the Russians, everything's a Russian thing, but this is actually Russian.
[02:32:25.017 --> 02:32:31.602]  Almost everything around here is Russian, but when it comes to the proprietary program with X2, it is Russian.
[02:32:31.602 --> 02:32:34.005]  It's not a Russian company, but it was Russians who figured out how to do this.
[02:32:34.605 --> 02:32:40.710]  And then they put it into this special natural oil and then you're able to have it and the DEA lets you have it.
[02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:43.713]  Because I guess with raw iodine you can do all sorts of stuff.
[02:32:43.713 --> 02:32:46.034]  It's like a precursor to methamphetamine.
[02:32:46.980 --> 02:32:48.641]  I was never really a big viewer of Breaking Bad.
[02:32:48.641 --> 02:32:50.761]  I watch a few episodes, but I don't get all that.
[02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:56.263]  But you see episodes with, like, robbing factories to get iodine or whatever, because they need the barrels of it to make the meth.
[02:32:56.263 --> 02:32:57.323]  I think that's kind of the same deal.
[02:32:57.323 --> 02:32:58.924]  But it has nothing to do with meth.
[02:32:58.924 --> 02:33:03.165]  It's a natural thing you've got to have, but it's an ingredient, I guess, in it.
[02:33:03.165 --> 02:33:04.786]  And it really is amazing what the caller said.
[02:33:04.786 --> 02:33:06.346]  OK, who's up next here?
[02:33:06.346 --> 02:33:09.247]  Is it Katie or is it Will?
[02:33:09.247 --> 02:33:10.267]  It's Will and then Katie.
[02:33:10.267 --> 02:33:10.728]  Please hold on.
[02:33:10.728 --> 02:33:11.768]  I want to talk to you all.
[02:33:11.768 --> 02:33:14.229]  Will, your story about vaccine-injured friend.
[02:33:14.229 --> 02:33:14.689]  Please tell us.
[02:33:15.956 --> 02:33:28.586]  Hey Alex, my buddy got his second dose of the Pfizer and then two weeks after that he was driving home and had a heart attack and passed out and drove off to the side of the road.
[02:33:28.586 --> 02:33:39.555]  Right now he has to wear these like heart monitoring things on his chest and with this giant screen on his hand, this monitor, and he's going into surgery soon.
[02:33:39.555 --> 02:33:41.797]  And I warned him, I told him in advance, hey man,
[02:33:42.352 --> 02:33:43.733]  You better not take that vaccine.
[02:33:43.733 --> 02:33:49.196]  I was telling him in March, I was like, they're going to come out with a vaccine launch and it will be bad.
[02:33:49.196 --> 02:33:53.799]  Um, I just like to say real quick, Alex, the stickers have a huge impact.
[02:33:53.799 --> 02:34:03.905]  If we were to get one in 10 cards on the road in the U S today to have stickers one in every 10 cars, that would be the biggest impact ever.
[02:34:03.905 --> 02:34:05.766]  No one would be able to ignore it.
[02:34:05.766 --> 02:34:09.789]  And they just need to say vaccines, kill arrest, Bill Gates, something along those lines.
[02:34:10.399 --> 02:34:14.505]  And that would be a huge wake-up call if we were to get 1 in 10 cars.
[02:34:14.505 --> 02:34:15.206]  And there's more than...
[02:34:16.355 --> 02:34:21.339]  40% people that are not vaccinated that are against it.
[02:34:21.339 --> 02:34:22.840]  I agree.
[02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:36.228]  We sell the 10 bumper stickers with the big door sticker at cost and everybody can get them at infowarestore.com but anybody is welcome to make their own sticker or whatever message they want.
[02:34:36.228 --> 02:34:45.495]  Kinkos or whatever but I agree the power of our bumper stickers the power of our cars and our barns and we're in a war they're trying to force an injection on us so you see some big
[02:34:46.375 --> 02:34:47.616]  Billboard for vaccines.
[02:34:47.616 --> 02:34:49.417]  I'm not saying doing it, but I've done it.
[02:34:49.417 --> 02:34:52.199]  I've climbed billboards and spray-painted them, okay?
[02:34:52.199 --> 02:34:54.321]  And there's nothing more invigorating at 1 a.m.
[02:34:54.321 --> 02:34:55.041]  to climb up.
[02:34:55.041 --> 02:34:55.762]  Don't get hurt, though.
[02:34:55.762 --> 02:34:57.003]  I almost fell off one one time.
[02:34:57.003 --> 02:35:01.166]  I actually did halfway fall off a billboard, but it was like wet up there.
[02:35:01.166 --> 02:35:01.726]  It had been raining.
[02:35:01.726 --> 02:35:05.509]  I still went up.
[02:35:05.509 --> 02:35:07.650]  I mean, just the games are over, folks.
[02:35:07.650 --> 02:35:09.412]  We got to get aggressive here.
[02:35:09.412 --> 02:35:10.833]  And I really appreciate what you're saying.
[02:35:10.833 --> 02:35:12.774]  Will, anything else?
[02:35:12.774 --> 02:35:13.274]  Real quick.
[02:35:14.838 --> 02:35:17.367]  Also advise you, let us take the pressure off you.
[02:35:18.198 --> 02:35:22.999]  You go on and do the biggest thing that Alex Jones does, and that's break the internet.
[02:35:22.999 --> 02:35:25.740]  You need to have a huge Joe Rogan podcast.
[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:31.202]  If everyone watched that, imagine 500 million views, the globalists would get pissed off.
[02:35:31.202 --> 02:35:41.345]  If you had David Icke, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, some scientists and medical doctors, that would be the biggest podcast ever, and it would really piss off the globalists.
[02:35:41.345 --> 02:35:42.265]  No, no, I hear you.
[02:35:42.265 --> 02:35:44.806]  I had a long talk with Joe on Saturday morning.
[02:35:45.826 --> 02:35:47.106]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:35:47.106 --> 02:35:48.927]  But yeah, Joe's definitely awake.
[02:35:48.927 --> 02:35:49.647]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:49.647 --> 02:35:50.387]  God bless you, brother.
[02:35:50.387 --> 02:35:51.247]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:35:51.247 --> 02:35:51.687]  Don't hang up.
[02:35:51.687 --> 02:35:54.308]  I want to talk to you.
[02:35:54.308 --> 02:35:58.469]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[02:35:58.469 --> 02:36:01.990]  We're seeing world government, world IVs being announced, forced inoculations.
[02:36:01.990 --> 02:36:04.890]  All the tyranny we warned of is now here.
[02:36:04.890 --> 02:36:09.671]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[02:36:09.671 --> 02:36:13.412]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[02:36:13.812 --> 02:36:18.294]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years.
[02:36:18.294 --> 02:36:22.335]  Because without InfoWars, we'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now.
[02:36:22.335 --> 02:36:24.456]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air.

[02:36:54.872 --> 02:36:57.753]  The biosecurity state is here.
[02:36:57.753 --> 02:37:03.654]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation, training us that humans are dirty, bad, and evil.
[02:37:03.654 --> 02:37:17.437]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country, all the way out to 2024.
[02:37:18.897 --> 02:37:22.098]  And in 2024, you will again take two shots.
[02:37:22.098 --> 02:37:26.099]  And he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[02:37:26.099 --> 02:37:27.860]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:30.561]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates.
[02:37:30.561 --> 02:37:32.802]  They're now implementing it, and now they've announced that U.S.
[02:37:32.802 --> 02:37:35.663]  policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[02:37:35.663 --> 02:37:44.946]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation, by the 30s, was the main funder of Adolf A. Louis Hitler and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany.
[02:37:45.646 --> 02:37:47.050]  And bull wars will continue to set fast.
[02:37:47.050 --> 02:37:49.075]  We fight this, I don't know how long we can.
[02:37:49.075 --> 02:37:50.459]  The enemy's coming for us all now.
[02:37:50.459 --> 02:37:52.083]  God bless and good luck.
[02:37:52.083 --> 02:37:53.607]  I would, again, get right with God right now.
[02:37:55.794 --> 02:38:03.959]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[02:38:03.959 --> 02:38:12.744]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean Fire, has a lot of power.
[02:38:12.744 --> 02:38:19.688]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high-quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket, at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:38:25.071 --> 02:38:25.231]  I think?
[02:38:45.015 --> 02:38:53.042]  This is a great way to limit your phone time use, it's a great way to spend more time with your family, and it's a great way to know you're not being tracked by the criminal globalist system.

[02:39:21.945 --> 02:39:27.610]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[02:39:27.610 --> 02:39:30.152]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[02:39:30.152 --> 02:39:33.555]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[02:39:33.555 --> 02:39:35.416]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[02:39:35.416 --> 02:39:37.458]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[02:39:37.458 --> 02:39:40.781]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.

[02:40:18.250 --> 02:40:19.891]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:40:19.891 --> 02:40:23.834]  Teach him he can trust me like a brother.
[02:40:23.834 --> 02:40:24.634]  And one day,
[02:40:45.606 --> 02:40:51.309]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:40:51.309 --> 02:40:52.930]  We're gonna ride.
[02:40:52.930 --> 02:40:57.493]  You know, I'm like the horse and you are the rider.
[02:40:57.493 --> 02:41:01.435]  You think, Jones' audience, is it the horse or is it the rider?
[02:41:01.435 --> 02:41:03.276]  Well think, you are the rider.
[02:41:06.914 --> 02:41:07.514]  I'm the horse.
[02:41:07.514 --> 02:41:08.154]  I'm already there.
[02:41:08.154 --> 02:41:09.795]  I'm already doing what I'm doing.
[02:41:09.795 --> 02:41:11.755]  You decide to get on the horse.
[02:41:11.755 --> 02:41:16.816]  You decide to take that horse where you want, to take the knowledge we lay out.
[02:41:16.816 --> 02:41:19.057]  Crank it up!
[02:41:19.057 --> 02:41:24.938]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[02:41:24.938 --> 02:41:31.580]  Razor blades and dice in her eyes.
[02:41:31.580 --> 02:41:34.941]  Just a touch of sadness and a fear.
[02:41:38.291 --> 02:41:43.072]  Beautiful song.
[02:41:43.072 --> 02:41:53.175]  I got to sit there at Willie Nelson's house one time, just he and I, and we played a game of chess.
[02:41:53.175 --> 02:41:54.876]  He smoked me under the table.
[02:41:54.876 --> 02:41:58.237]  Marijuana.
[02:41:58.237 --> 02:42:03.878]  And he played this song for me on acoustic guitar.
[02:42:03.878 --> 02:42:05.399]  That's those little things in life.
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:08.121]  Gosh, that's just me four years ago.
[02:42:08.121 --> 02:42:09.761]  I've gained some weight.
[02:42:09.761 --> 02:42:13.483]  I could lose a few pounds again.
[02:42:13.483 --> 02:42:18.305]  I'm going to chase the sky forever.
[02:42:18.305 --> 02:42:21.546]  With the woman and the stallion and the wind.
[02:42:21.546 --> 02:42:22.546]  All right, let's get to your calls.
[02:42:22.546 --> 02:42:24.207]  Let's get to all of them right now.
[02:42:24.207 --> 02:42:29.769]  In the next hour ahead of Gerald Cilente, I am going to hit a ton of incredible news.
[02:42:29.769 --> 02:42:31.290]  All hell's breaking loose.
[02:42:31.290 --> 02:42:32.590]  Just going to leave it at that.
[02:42:32.590 --> 02:42:33.031]  Okay.
[02:42:36.038 --> 02:42:40.179]  Let's talk to Katie in Georgia.
[02:42:40.179 --> 02:42:40.979]  Katie, thanks for holding.
[02:42:40.979 --> 02:42:42.480]  Go ahead.
[02:42:42.480 --> 02:42:43.180]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:43.820]  Can you hear me?
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:44.840]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.721]  Alrighty.
[02:42:45.721 --> 02:42:48.101]  I might be that reckless woman you were just talking about.
[02:42:48.101 --> 02:42:50.702]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:42:50.702 --> 02:42:53.063]  That's what we need is some reckless women that don't comply.
[02:42:53.063 --> 02:42:54.663]  We do.
[02:42:54.663 --> 02:43:00.705]  I have an idea for, you know how when people campaign, they put yard signs out?
[02:43:01.533 --> 02:43:10.275]  So I was thinking maybe take some stickers and make you some yard signs and stick them on the side of your road and in your front yard or whatever.
[02:43:10.275 --> 02:43:16.336]  But besides that, I had to get to the point of the reason why I called.
[02:43:16.336 --> 02:43:23.717]  Last year, about the time that the COVID stuff started, my dad got really, really sick.
[02:43:23.717 --> 02:43:29.158]  And he felt like he had the COVID or Corona, whatever you want to call it.
[02:43:29.727 --> 02:43:33.868]  He felt like he had it, so he went to the hospital to try and get tested for it.
[02:43:33.868 --> 02:43:38.629]  They refused him tests four different times.
[02:43:38.629 --> 02:43:40.209]  Sorry, I kind of get excited about this.
[02:43:40.209 --> 02:43:47.950]  They refused him tests four different times and the last time he went to the hospital, he called me and he said, I love you.
[02:43:47.950 --> 02:43:50.070]  I'm scared I'm not going to come out.
[02:43:50.070 --> 02:43:50.831]  This is bad.
[02:43:50.831 --> 02:43:51.591]  I can't breathe.
[02:43:51.591 --> 02:43:52.591]  And he was swollen.
[02:43:52.591 --> 02:43:55.051]  His face was really bad, swollen.
[02:43:55.051 --> 02:43:58.952]  Well, they get him in the hospital and they start running tests on him and
[02:44:00.154 --> 02:44:04.555]  They figure out that he has something in his lungs.
[02:44:04.555 --> 02:44:08.336]  Then they take and put him on an incubator.
[02:44:08.336 --> 02:44:15.279]  And when they put him on the incubator, they were going to try to move him to a special hospital down in Atlanta.
[02:44:15.279 --> 02:44:29.463]  So as they're transporting my father, being incubated, as they're taking him to this hospital, he dies inside of the emblem.
[02:44:31.147 --> 02:44:36.068]  Um, that goes on to more bigger events.
[02:44:36.068 --> 02:44:38.429]  Um, it scares my grandmother.
[02:44:38.429 --> 02:44:41.009]  She gets the shot.
[02:44:41.009 --> 02:44:42.509]  It scares my other grandmother.
[02:44:42.509 --> 02:44:43.370]  She gets the shot.
[02:44:43.370 --> 02:44:47.110]  And then it scares his wife so bad that she gets the shot.
[02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:54.912]  And it's just, it's driving me crazy trying to explain to them how, how, how do I explain to them that they've, they've messed up?
[02:44:54.912 --> 02:44:58.793]  How do they, how do I get to them to, you know,
[02:45:00.045 --> 02:45:13.209]  I'm just at a standstill as to how to explain to them that this is not good, that they used my dad to fear mongrel them into getting this shot, and it worked.
[02:45:13.209 --> 02:45:16.330]  Wow, so they used your dad's death to do that?
[02:45:16.330 --> 02:45:28.553]  I really truly feel like that, and I wouldn't have called in today, but you guys have, you guys were reporting on the Sturgis Rally stuff, and my dad was a really big person in that Sturgis Rally.
[02:45:29.491 --> 02:45:37.474]  I just felt God put it on my heart that I needed to call in today and warn everybody else, don't get this shot.
[02:45:37.474 --> 02:45:42.716]  My grandmother, she has just passed out and broke her hip.
[02:45:42.716 --> 02:45:56.002]  So now she has a total hip replacement and she said that while she was in physical therapy, she was talking to one of her friends that was also in physical therapy with her and that woman also took the shot.
[02:45:57.737 --> 02:46:10.822]  The doctors prescribed her Valium after the shot and when they prescribed that Valium, they're now trying to say that the Valium is the cause of all of her nerve problems and she can't move at all.
[02:46:10.822 --> 02:46:18.245]  So to be clear, you're saying these women took the shot then got sick?
[02:46:18.245 --> 02:46:22.847]  My grandmother fell and broke her hip and not only that, she's had cancer.
[02:46:22.847 --> 02:46:26.148]  So you're saying though, after the injection this happened?
[02:46:27.222 --> 02:46:33.946]  She's had, my grandmother's had melanoma cancer before then, and she had a piece took off.
[02:46:33.946 --> 02:46:39.230]  Well, right after she had that piece took off, she went and got the shot.
[02:46:39.230 --> 02:46:47.795]  Well, normally before the shot, she would heal up perfectly fine on the skin cancers, I mean, after they take them off.
[02:46:47.795 --> 02:46:48.716]  Well, it took her
[02:46:49.517 --> 02:46:53.358]  Hey there, I just wanted to call in and let you know that
[02:47:10.450 --> 02:47:17.234]  My father, he's got heart issues where he gets a fibrillation, whatever.
[02:47:17.234 --> 02:47:20.476]  They got to shock him back into sinus rhythm every once in a while.
[02:47:20.476 --> 02:47:23.458]  And this has gone on long before.
[02:47:23.458 --> 02:47:23.999]  He got the shot.
[02:47:23.999 --> 02:47:26.020]  He got the shot and he's fine.
[02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:29.482]  There's no issues that he's had since the shot.
[02:47:29.482 --> 02:47:30.923]  My mother got the shot.
[02:47:30.923 --> 02:47:32.424]  My father-in-law got the shot.
[02:47:32.424 --> 02:47:32.464]  My
[02:47:33.374 --> 02:47:35.977]  I'll tell you a little bit about it too.
[02:47:35.977 --> 02:47:36.818]  I called in earlier
[02:47:53.092 --> 02:47:54.353]  I think we're good.
[02:48:04.551 --> 02:48:09.435]  I'm not going to... Aren't you just the perfect, disingenuous fake caller?
[02:48:09.435 --> 02:48:10.936]  I've not censored these calls.
[02:48:10.936 --> 02:48:13.718]  We didn't... Now there's a small chance a phone got disconnected.
[02:48:13.718 --> 02:48:15.860]  You're on air now, you false prophet.
[02:48:15.860 --> 02:48:17.761]  If you're lying, you may be one.
[02:48:17.761 --> 02:48:20.163]  You're here, telling us everybody got the shot.
[02:48:20.163 --> 02:48:21.084]  They got the shot.
[02:48:21.084 --> 02:48:22.164]  We love the shot.
[02:48:22.164 --> 02:48:23.485]  You like the experimental shot.
[02:48:23.485 --> 02:48:25.187]  Maybe you love the world ID.
[02:48:25.187 --> 02:48:27.448]  Maybe you love the social credit score.
[02:48:27.448 --> 02:48:27.969]  I get it.
[02:48:27.969 --> 02:48:30.010]  You're a good little guy.
[02:48:30.010 --> 02:48:30.171]  But...
[02:48:30.971 --> 02:48:37.565]  You're on air now, nobody's censoring you, so you tell us how much you love that experimental injection.
[02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:48.322]  I love the fact that if we get enough people having the vaccine, then we can get over COVID.
[02:48:48.322 --> 02:48:53.564]  Right now... Sir, Klaus Schwab says we never get over it.
[02:48:53.564 --> 02:48:57.204]  Now they're saying the booster shots in Israel, the people are going to the hospital.
[02:48:57.204 --> 02:49:00.005]  Don't you understand it's a plan to never get out of it?
[02:49:00.005 --> 02:49:06.667]  You think if we all take the shot, they're going to let us alone?
[02:49:06.667 --> 02:49:07.747]  You're full of hooey, Alex.
[02:49:09.096 --> 02:49:10.577]  Oh, it's the guy that calls him.
[02:49:10.577 --> 02:49:11.818]  Alright, let him go.
[02:49:11.818 --> 02:49:13.619]  That guy always says full of Huey.
[02:49:13.619 --> 02:49:14.580]  He's a liar.
[02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:16.621]  Your whole family didn't get the shot.
[02:49:16.621 --> 02:49:20.283]  You're sitting there in your Antifa pentagram probably crapping in your own diapers.
[02:49:20.283 --> 02:49:21.424]  God.
[02:49:21.424 --> 02:49:31.950]  So, imagine being a weird, neurotic creature that just waits for weeks and then calls in and lies and says, he calls all the time, that we censored him.
[02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:32.250]  Didn't.
[02:49:32.250 --> 02:49:33.410]  He's a liar.
[02:49:33.410 --> 02:49:34.951]  Says his whole family got the shot.
[02:49:34.951 --> 02:49:35.772]  They all love it.
[02:49:35.772 --> 02:49:36.352]  A liar.
[02:49:36.352 --> 02:49:37.553]  He doesn't have a family, probably.
[02:49:39.087 --> 02:49:40.708]  And then he says, I'm full of hooey.
[02:49:40.708 --> 02:49:48.894]  Well, I guess the head of the German Union, the Pathology Union, is saying the shots are deadly.
[02:49:48.894 --> 02:49:49.754]  I guess they're wrong too.
[02:49:49.754 --> 02:49:51.856]  I guess all the studies are wrong.
[02:49:51.856 --> 02:49:55.438]  And you're just there to try to gaslight our audience.
[02:49:55.438 --> 02:50:00.802]  You know, we have the phones really open for people that said, hey, I took the shot, no problem.
[02:50:00.802 --> 02:50:02.623]  We've had a couple of those calls.
[02:50:02.623 --> 02:50:06.566]  Yeah, I took the shot, didn't have a problem, but I don't think we should be forced to have it.
[02:50:06.566 --> 02:50:08.307]  You know, we've had reasonable, like, well, thank you for your call.
[02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:23.227]  This isn't some leftist show, because leftist radio shows are known to queue up their friends and everybody, and they all, that's what these Democrat, you know, health department workers, social workers do, is they call into NPR all day.
[02:50:24.588 --> 02:50:26.230]  And then they stage their calls.
[02:50:26.230 --> 02:50:29.974]  So he lives a life, probably as a social worker somewhere, probably a pedophile.
[02:50:29.974 --> 02:50:32.096]  Yeah, I think the last caller probably screws kids.
[02:50:32.096 --> 02:50:33.598]  This sounds like one.
[02:50:33.598 --> 02:50:39.624]  These kids screwing people that want to screw our society, then try to sit there and pretend we're faking stuff like you.
[02:50:39.624 --> 02:50:42.007]  No, brother, I ain't the phony thing.
[02:50:42.007 --> 02:50:42.808]  I'm the bona fide.
[02:50:44.659 --> 02:50:51.088]  It is through our five senses that we are kept fascinated and hypnotized by the lies we are told.
[02:50:51.088 --> 02:50:58.478]  And the only way to see through this illusion is with our higher senses, which is why fluoridated water is a big problem.
[02:50:58.478 --> 02:50:59.259]  Consuming too much
[02:50:59.739 --> 02:51:00.179]  I don't know.
[02:51:21.577 --> 02:51:24.839]  And otherwise, unseen dimensions of reality.
[02:51:24.839 --> 02:51:29.862]  Fluoride-free water is essential to keeping our pineal gland healthy.
[02:51:29.862 --> 02:51:36.125]  Our water filtration systems, with the proper filters, will keep your drinking water fluoride-free.
[02:51:36.125 --> 02:51:38.987]  And the Pro-Pure showerhead will seal the deal.
[02:51:38.987 --> 02:51:43.790]  Get them both today, for yourself or a friend, at Infowarestore.com.
[02:51:46.823 --> 02:51:48.586]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[02:51:48.586 --> 02:51:49.066]  You're on the air.
[02:51:49.066 --> 02:51:49.627]  Thanks for holding.
[02:51:49.627 --> 02:51:49.928]  Yeah, hello.
[02:51:49.928 --> 02:51:50.669]  Can you hear me?
[02:51:50.669 --> 02:51:51.310]  I sure can, sir.
[02:51:51.310 --> 02:51:51.630]  Thank you.
[02:51:51.630 --> 02:51:52.411]  Hey, Alex.
[02:51:52.411 --> 02:51:58.620]  Before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[02:51:58.620 --> 02:51:59.962]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[02:51:59.962 --> 02:52:01.985]  I'm calling from New Brunswick, Connecticut, and
[02:52:02.626 --> 02:52:04.087]  I just want to plug in.
[02:52:04.087 --> 02:52:08.171]  I'm a truck driver and Tuberforce has changed the way I drive.
[02:52:08.171 --> 02:52:15.136]  Me and my brothers that drive, there's a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[02:52:15.136 --> 02:52:23.183]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[02:52:23.243 --> 02:52:29.548]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[02:52:29.548 --> 02:52:31.850]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[02:52:31.850 --> 02:52:34.311]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[02:52:34.311 --> 02:52:36.974]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[02:52:36.974 --> 02:52:41.017]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[02:52:41.017 --> 02:52:42.798]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[02:52:42.798 --> 02:52:43.539]  So that means a lot to me.
[02:52:43.539 --> 02:52:43.899]  Thank you.
[02:52:43.899 --> 02:52:49.023]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[02:52:49.023 --> 02:52:51.665]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:02.679 --> 02:53:08.208]  Alright, I'm going to talk to Nathan, Cameron, Joshua, Leo, everybody I need to get to here.
[02:53:09.343 --> 02:53:17.505]  But then I've got this really powerful doctor in Indiana at a city council that's on Infowars.com, but I do want to air ahead of Gerald Celente taking over in 15 minutes.
[02:53:17.505 --> 02:53:25.786]  We've got this other incredible footage of the police in France going and harassing restaurants to see if everybody's got a vaccine passport, even though it's not a law, it's a regulation.
[02:53:25.786 --> 02:53:32.268]  I mean, this is so Orwellian while their borders are wide open and whole areas of France are no-go zone with the Muslims.
[02:53:32.268 --> 02:53:32.808]  But Nathan,
[02:53:34.216 --> 02:53:36.098]  He's in Wisconsin.
[02:53:36.098 --> 02:53:41.062]  Says he's an engineer for DuPont on life extension, health and medical tyranny.
[02:53:41.062 --> 02:53:41.462]  Go ahead.
[02:53:41.462 --> 02:53:44.705]  Thanks for calling.
[02:53:44.705 --> 02:53:45.846]  Oh, hello?
[02:53:45.846 --> 02:53:46.206]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:46.206 --> 02:53:46.806]  Welcome, Nathan.
[02:53:46.806 --> 02:53:48.187]  You're on the air.
[02:53:48.187 --> 02:53:49.208]  Wow.
[02:53:49.208 --> 02:53:51.770]  Alex, kind of, okay.
[02:53:51.770 --> 02:53:53.812]  Collecting thoughts.
[02:53:53.812 --> 02:53:57.315]  I was working at a place called the Buck Institute in Novato, California.
[02:53:57.315 --> 02:53:59.476]  There's a researcher there named Judy Campisi.
[02:53:59.476 --> 02:54:02.439]  She discovered a cell type called a senescent cell.
[02:54:03.324 --> 02:54:10.846]  Senescent cells are basically like a form of cancer only instead of a runaway cancer that grows out of control, it stops growth.
[02:54:10.846 --> 02:54:15.187]  You accumulate these kinds of cells as you age, right?
[02:54:15.187 --> 02:54:25.830]  So the treatments they have to kill cancer right now, the immunotherapies, those therapies will work effectively on the senescent cell lines.
[02:54:25.830 --> 02:54:29.431]  When you do this, you can effectively extend the lifespan of
[02:54:30.322 --> 02:54:37.488]  Anybody that gets a treatment that's similar to a cancer treatment but it's for an aging-related disease.
[02:54:37.488 --> 02:54:44.053]  The main reason I'm trying to call, I mean I'm just trying to get the information out there that people don't know anything about finessing cells.
[02:54:44.053 --> 02:54:53.500]  They don't know anything about how curing, when they cure cancer, they cure aging and nobody really gets this.
[02:54:53.500 --> 02:54:58.063]  One of the things I want to push you guys to do is research Unity Biotech.
[02:54:58.063 --> 02:54:58.924]  It's a company that has
[02:54:59.888 --> 02:55:04.111]  There's some YouTube videos that you guys can look into that are publicly available.
[02:55:04.111 --> 02:55:15.317]  But these treatments, using the cancer cell treatments for the senescent cells that are causing aging to become, you know, kill people, it's being done.
[02:55:15.317 --> 02:55:18.278]  This is not in the future.
[02:55:18.278 --> 02:55:19.279]  This is happening now.
[02:55:21.394 --> 02:55:24.096]  No, I understand they have ways of blocking cancer.
[02:55:24.096 --> 02:55:26.318]  The problem is that it creates 10 other problems.
[02:55:26.318 --> 02:55:31.102]  Kind of like, oh, we can stop this virus, but then it gives you a heart attack.
[02:55:31.102 --> 02:55:33.624]  Does that make sense?
[02:55:33.624 --> 02:55:35.946]  So, but this is not that.
[02:55:35.946 --> 02:55:40.870]  This is targeted.
[02:55:40.870 --> 02:55:45.074]  There are proteins on the outside of these cells that they use for targeting.
[02:55:45.074 --> 02:55:48.657]  So for CAR T, they use specific proteins that are expressed
[02:55:49.172 --> 02:55:50.793]  I find this to be fascinating.
[02:55:50.793 --> 02:55:52.633]  I know about what you're talking about.
[02:55:52.633 --> 02:55:52.833]  I'm not a...
[02:56:07.097 --> 02:56:09.660]  No, look, if this works, it gives credence to using the mRNA vaccines.
[02:56:30.563 --> 02:56:37.986]  The proteins on the outside of the cell walls for a senescent cell could be targeted using an mRNA vaccine.
[02:56:37.986 --> 02:56:41.007]  Oh, they admit they got mRNA for cancer.
[02:56:41.007 --> 02:56:41.528]  Exactly.
[02:56:41.528 --> 02:56:46.870]  But instead of getting that approved, they target the common cold and then it causes mass deaths from blood clots.
[02:56:46.870 --> 02:56:52.112]  What I'm saying is, what they've rolled out causes massive blood clots.
[02:56:52.112 --> 02:56:56.594]  So Alex, I'm talking about immortality for the rich people.
[02:56:57.694 --> 02:56:59.096]  They have... No, I understand.
[02:56:59.096 --> 02:57:01.459]  They've got stuff that turns off the cancer cells.
[02:57:01.459 --> 02:57:02.059]  I got it.
[02:57:06.670 --> 02:57:08.871]  Tell you what, I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:57:08.871 --> 02:57:14.372]  If you want to give us some documents and send stuff to my email and get a clear phone, I'd love to have you on as a guest.
[02:57:14.372 --> 02:57:20.334]  Guys, get his name and number and give him our email and have him send you a bunch of stuff because I'm familiar with all.
[02:57:20.334 --> 02:57:22.055]  I understand they've got stuff that works.
[02:57:22.055 --> 02:57:23.515]  We're maybe giving stuff that doesn't work.
[02:57:23.515 --> 02:57:24.315]  I get it.
[02:57:24.315 --> 02:57:27.036]  He's trying to call in about stuff that works.
[02:57:27.036 --> 02:57:29.557]  I'm saying, okay, they're giving us stuff that doesn't work.
[02:57:29.557 --> 02:57:30.457]  That's how it always works.
[02:57:30.457 --> 02:57:32.178]  They're like, oh, we have this great technology.
[02:57:32.178 --> 02:57:34.479]  Let's kill people with it instead of save them.
[02:57:34.479 --> 02:57:35.399]  I understand what you're saying.
[02:57:36.803 --> 02:57:37.744]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[02:57:37.744 --> 02:57:38.846]  More phone calls straight ahead.
[02:57:38.846 --> 02:57:44.935]  Stay with us.
[02:57:44.935 --> 02:57:49.241]  I should also add, I sure hope you don't share the URL.
[02:57:49.241 --> 02:57:50.863]  FreeWorldNews.tv.
[02:57:50.863 --> 02:57:52.606]  FreeWorldNews.tv.
[02:57:55.700 --> 02:58:04.963]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[02:58:04.963 --> 02:58:11.005]  And with promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[02:58:11.005 --> 02:58:11.425]  It's an amazing deal.
[02:58:11.425 --> 02:58:12.025]  It's an amazing deal.
[02:58:12.025 --> 02:58:16.028]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[02:58:16.028 --> 02:58:21.571]  You can get my Keys to Dreams sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[02:58:21.571 --> 02:58:27.215]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[02:58:27.215 --> 02:58:29.756]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[02:58:29.756 --> 02:58:33.158]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[02:58:33.158 --> 02:58:35.000]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.081]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[02:58:37.081 --> 02:58:40.403]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[02:58:40.863 --> 02:58:52.373]  Us getting a word out with Alex's great show, InfoWars, and you're supporting MyPillow, 2,500 employees that I haven't had to lay anybody off in spite of trying to be attacked and camped.
[02:58:52.373 --> 02:58:52.793]  Beautiful.
[02:58:52.793 --> 02:58:53.934]  You're an example of resistance.
[02:58:53.934 --> 02:58:58.838]  Mike Lindell, Godspeed.
[02:58:58.838 --> 02:59:04.844]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:06.135 --> 02:59:10.297]  Well, the Pentagon pulls the trigger and commits a major crime.
[02:59:10.297 --> 02:59:13.638]  Members of Congress are pointing out.
[02:59:13.638 --> 02:59:16.539]  Pentagon pulls the trigger.
[02:59:16.539 --> 02:59:21.341]  We'll order all troops to get the COVID vaccine by September 15th.
[02:59:21.341 --> 02:59:25.742]  The article's up at Infowars.com.
[02:59:25.742 --> 02:59:27.003]  Pentagon pulls the trigger.
[02:59:27.003 --> 02:59:33.425]  We'll order all troops to get experimental COVID vaccine by September 15th under threat of court martial.
[02:59:35.523 --> 02:59:48.201]  Man, talk about violating the Nuremberg Code, and you've got Austin, the Secretary of Defense, that wears Darth Vader outfits now, with face shields and everything, to try to accentuate this made-up garbage as if masks do anything.
[02:59:48.201 --> 02:59:49.743]  The vaccine, they admit, is experimental.
[02:59:49.743 --> 02:59:50.424]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:59:50.424 --> 02:59:51.285]  It doesn't protect you.
[02:59:52.006 --> 02:59:53.287]  What a criminal action.
[02:59:53.287 --> 02:59:55.048]  We'll go back to your calls in a moment.
[02:59:55.048 --> 02:59:56.249]  Then we've got this article.
[02:59:56.249 --> 03:00:10.118]  We have photos at Martha's Vineyard of the private jet landing with John Kerry and all the other private jets with Stephen Colbert and the rest of it for their big evil super spreader event because they all know it's a fraud.
[03:00:10.118 --> 03:00:13.180]  You're supposed to stay home and die so they have open highways.
[03:00:13.180 --> 03:00:17.043]  Well you go to the article there's photos of him and there's the logs getting off the jet.
[03:00:18.723 --> 03:00:26.487]  See, it's about gaslighting you and saying, no, there are no private jets.
[03:00:26.487 --> 03:00:28.868]  The house is built at one foot above sea level.
[03:00:28.868 --> 03:00:31.729]  The highest point of the house is five foot above sea level.
[03:00:31.729 --> 03:00:34.370]  Supposed to all be gone years ago.
[03:00:34.370 --> 03:00:35.991]  Private jets above sea level.
[03:00:37.344 --> 03:00:38.545]  Only a few feet.
[03:00:38.545 --> 03:00:40.307]  Supposedly all going to be flooded.
[03:00:40.307 --> 03:00:41.469]  Super spreader event.
[03:00:41.469 --> 03:00:42.149]  No mask.
[03:00:42.149 --> 03:00:43.491]  No vaccine passports.
[03:00:43.491 --> 03:00:44.972]  Because they're the anointed.
[03:00:44.972 --> 03:00:46.194]  They're the gods.
[03:00:46.194 --> 03:00:47.135]  They're the kings.
[03:00:47.135 --> 03:00:51.319]  This is all for you, not for them.
[03:00:51.319 --> 03:00:52.541]  Meanwhile, this incredible footage.
[03:00:53.979 --> 03:00:59.485]  Show your papers, French police harass patrons for COVID passes at restaurants, because the restaurants are all ignoring it.
[03:00:59.485 --> 03:01:01.026]  It's not even a law, it's a regulation.
[03:01:01.026 --> 03:01:08.093]  It's crap, no one's following it, so the cops come in and demand to see the papers digitally that you'll be eating.
[03:01:08.093 --> 03:01:12.958]  Rwandan refugees who burned down church amidst the killing of Catholic priests in France.
[03:01:12.958 --> 03:01:14.880]  Cultural enrichment.
[03:01:17.193 --> 03:01:24.995]  Spain, paramedics sexually assaulted Stone during riot at facility for children migrants who are really all 30 years old.
[03:01:24.995 --> 03:01:26.795]  And it just goes on and on.
[03:01:26.795 --> 03:01:35.077]  Judge signs order to block arrest of House Democrats who refused to return to Texas Capitol to vote.
[03:01:35.077 --> 03:01:39.118]  So it's all getting crazy.
[03:01:39.118 --> 03:01:40.818]  It's all getting wild.
[03:01:43.231 --> 03:01:45.473]  A lot of big stuff's happening on the 11th.
[03:01:45.473 --> 03:01:47.114]  Arizona's going to report back its audit.
[03:01:47.114 --> 03:01:49.096]  Mike Lindell's having his big event.
[03:01:49.096 --> 03:01:52.619]  We'll be there covering live in Sioux Falls.
[03:01:52.619 --> 03:01:53.880]  Look at these people.
[03:01:53.880 --> 03:01:54.741]  I have a vaccine.
[03:01:54.741 --> 03:02:03.428]  Man, this footage is so... In fact, I'm not going to get to the doctor in Indiana that knocked you out of the park with the city council.
[03:02:03.428 --> 03:02:05.150]  Maybe on the war room they'll play it.
[03:02:05.150 --> 03:02:06.691]  But I'll play at the start of the show tomorrow.
[03:02:06.691 --> 03:02:08.252]  And I'm going to play France.
[03:02:09.198 --> 03:02:17.359]  The police wanting to see your vaccine QR code for something that isn't a vaccine, that doesn't work, that's been linked to all these deaths.
[03:02:17.359 --> 03:02:19.480]  Wow!
[03:02:19.480 --> 03:02:21.300]  This is just incredible.
[03:02:21.300 --> 03:02:22.840]  And the people are so proud.
[03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:26.581]  Oh, and I thought the law in France was if you're sitting inside, you gotta have it.
[03:02:26.581 --> 03:02:27.821]  No, no, no.
[03:02:27.821 --> 03:02:28.721]  Now it's outside.
[03:02:28.721 --> 03:02:29.402]  They just show everyone.
[03:02:29.402 --> 03:02:34.522]  Oh, look how you're submitting to this cult.
[03:02:34.522 --> 03:02:35.763]  Oh, so there was the yellow vest.
[03:02:35.763 --> 03:02:37.063]  Macron was about to be overthrown.
[03:02:38.012 --> 03:02:44.035]  You got the Brexit, you got Bolsonaro, you got Trump, in comes Operation Lockstep and now it's here.
[03:02:44.035 --> 03:02:52.000]  People just keep thinking, if I submit, if I submit, if I submit, if I submit, if I submit, I can do more.
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:54.661]  No, giving in puts you in a trap deeper.
[03:02:54.661 --> 03:02:56.102]  When do you figure that instinct out?
[03:02:56.102 --> 03:03:00.325]  Macron said three weeks ago, you can't go to a cafe or a store or the grocery store.
[03:03:00.325 --> 03:03:02.726]  People rioting, when I never said that!
[03:03:02.726 --> 03:03:04.327]  Snopes said he didn't say it, he did!
[03:03:06.653 --> 03:03:08.773]  Kerry didn't land in a private jet, even though he did!
[03:03:08.773 --> 03:03:14.735]  It's all part of you getting used to being lied to.
[03:03:14.735 --> 03:03:15.835]  Or used to living under tyranny.
[03:03:15.835 --> 03:03:21.876]  Kind of like, I'm pretty comfortable now with, oh, they're going to put mandatory cameras on all cars to watch us.
[03:03:21.876 --> 03:03:23.877]  It's in the infrastructure bill.
[03:03:23.877 --> 03:03:25.517]  Oh, they're going to arrest me if I criticize.
[03:03:25.517 --> 03:03:26.717]  I mean, they're just doing it.
[03:03:26.717 --> 03:03:34.399]  And we just submit, submit, submit, because that's the way it is.
[03:03:34.399 --> 03:03:35.399]  All right, up next here.
[03:03:37.128 --> 03:03:41.251]  Cameron in South Carolina, go ahead.
[03:03:41.251 --> 03:03:42.732]  Jones, pleasure to talk to you, man.
[03:03:42.732 --> 03:03:43.593]  It's been a long time.
[03:03:43.593 --> 03:03:46.935]  I met you at the press club a couple years ago.
[03:03:46.935 --> 03:03:49.497]  But I got a quick story and a solution.
[03:03:49.497 --> 03:03:51.899]  So, you know, can you hear me?
[03:03:51.899 --> 03:03:53.921]  Yeah, I sure can, brother.
[03:03:53.921 --> 03:03:54.941]  Awesome, cool.
[03:03:54.941 --> 03:03:58.964]  So my wife and I, we both lost our grandmother within a week.
[03:03:58.964 --> 03:04:01.947]  You know, they both got, I mean, one was 83, mine was 97.
[03:04:01.947 --> 03:04:04.488]  I mean, I've lived through everything.
[03:04:04.488 --> 03:04:06.410]  I mean, come on, you know, life's thrown at them.
[03:04:07.342 --> 03:04:09.603]  Um, you know, second round of the shot, they got it.
[03:04:09.603 --> 03:04:14.925]  I mean, and, uh, over the, over time, their bodies completely shut down, colon cancer.
[03:04:14.925 --> 03:04:19.326]  Um, mine definitely had a stroke in her sleep, you know, just completely lifeless gone.
[03:04:19.326 --> 03:04:23.368]  And they tell you, they say, Oh, it looks like you get cancer when you take the shot.
[03:04:23.368 --> 03:04:25.889]  Don't worry.
[03:04:25.889 --> 03:04:26.309]  Yeah.
[03:04:26.309 --> 03:04:30.630]  And, uh, you know, my wife and I, we just, we got a baby boy about to turn one.
[03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:33.131]  That's like, he got robbed at the awesome grandparents.
[03:04:33.131 --> 03:04:35.252]  I mean, two, two women that were just, you know,
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:40.344]  I mean, top of the line, but anyways, you know.
[03:04:40.344 --> 03:04:44.988]  And anybody that's got children know, for some reason, your kids love the grandparents more than you.
[03:04:44.988 --> 03:04:47.050]  It's a magic thing.
[03:04:47.050 --> 03:04:47.570]  That is.
[03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:50.113]  It's like my older brother got to meet mine.
[03:04:50.113 --> 03:04:51.554]  You know, that was great for him.
[03:04:51.554 --> 03:04:52.655]  You know, just denied that.
[03:04:52.655 --> 03:04:54.777]  But crazy.
[03:04:54.777 --> 03:04:57.259]  I mean, really what it comes down to is what you say every day.
[03:04:57.259 --> 03:05:00.022]  You know, we're, they've committed, I mean, they've committed
[03:05:00.529 --> 03:05:01.830]  Well, Trump's in over his head.
[03:05:01.830 --> 03:05:02.851]  Trump's just out of the game.
[03:05:02.851 --> 03:05:04.392]  And he's surrounded by a bunch of scum.
[03:05:26.932 --> 03:05:27.973]  And that's the problem.
[03:05:27.973 --> 03:05:31.595]  You know, it's like we can't ever get these people to realize what we're up against.
[03:05:31.595 --> 03:05:32.676]  I mean, you've been talking about it.
[03:05:32.676 --> 03:05:34.057]  This is the tip of the spear.
[03:05:34.057 --> 03:05:35.538]  Well, I like what Rand Paul said.
[03:05:35.538 --> 03:05:36.599]  He said, we're at a crossroads.
[03:05:36.599 --> 03:05:37.559]  We're at war.
[03:05:37.559 --> 03:05:40.421]  These people are premeditatedly taking our rights using a virus.
[03:05:40.421 --> 03:05:41.362]  And that's what they've done.
[03:05:41.362 --> 03:05:46.486]  And we just have to just not just not comply, get in their faces and say no at every level.
[03:05:46.486 --> 03:05:47.426]  Cameron, thank you for the call.
[03:05:47.426 --> 03:05:48.767]  Amazing points.
[03:05:48.767 --> 03:05:49.388]  All right.
[03:05:49.388 --> 03:05:50.709]  Leo in California.
[03:05:50.709 --> 03:05:51.309]  Thanks for calling.
[03:05:51.309 --> 03:05:53.611]  Go ahead, Leo.
[03:05:53.611 --> 03:05:54.291]  Hey, Alex.
[03:05:54.291 --> 03:05:55.012]  Can you hear me?
[03:05:55.012 --> 03:05:55.272]  I can.
[03:05:56.243 --> 03:05:56.923]  Hey, brother.
[03:05:56.923 --> 03:05:58.944]  It's a blessing and a privilege to speak with you.
[03:05:58.944 --> 03:05:59.944]  My name is Leo Zacchi.
[03:05:59.944 --> 03:06:04.826]  I'm a longtime listener, an info warrior, and I'm a California gubernatorial candidate.
[03:06:04.826 --> 03:06:08.968]  And Alex, I would love the opportunity to earn your endorsement for governor.
[03:06:08.968 --> 03:06:12.849]  I've had a lot of strange things happening around with the vaccine.
[03:06:12.849 --> 03:06:14.170]  People getting very sick.
[03:06:14.170 --> 03:06:18.271]  All of my grandmother's friends who have taken this injection have gotten very, very ill.
[03:06:18.271 --> 03:06:19.152]  Some of them even died.
[03:06:19.152 --> 03:06:22.653]  A friend of mine's father was hospitalized two days after having the second dose.
[03:06:23.325 --> 03:06:28.680]  I mean there's a lot of terrible things going on and I want to take a stand against all this tyranny that's coming our way.
[03:06:29.306 --> 03:06:29.946]  Isn't it incredible?
[03:06:29.946 --> 03:06:37.791]  They're getting, like, people used to always human sacrifice, and folks would ask, how did ancient cultures sacrifice their kids and their parents, young and old?
[03:06:37.791 --> 03:06:39.552]  Well, now we're learning!
[03:06:39.552 --> 03:06:46.477]  There's a hunger within the elites to kill old people and young people, and who says little kids are going to be the only ones to get aborted?
[03:06:46.477 --> 03:06:50.299]  Now we're going to abort the old people, but these shots are killing everybody.
[03:06:50.299 --> 03:06:57.984]  Like I said, my nanny's best friend's sister's husband died in New York two days after the shot of a heart attack, 37 years old, in great shape.
[03:06:58.604 --> 03:07:00.626]  They said he died of the vaccine.
[03:07:00.626 --> 03:07:02.788]  So, I mean, they're doing it, brother.
[03:07:02.788 --> 03:07:03.509]  No, it's happening.
[03:07:03.509 --> 03:07:06.131]  I mean, they want to destroy the four olds, Alex.
[03:07:06.131 --> 03:07:14.279]  They want to kill off the older generation, the people that lived through the Second World War, the Cuban Revolution, 60s, the SLA, fall of the Berlin Wall, 9-11.
[03:07:14.279 --> 03:07:23.287]  They want to erase history from the perspective of people who have the first-hand accounts so they can hide the truth and convince people that they're the good guys and convince people to give up their rights and freedoms.
[03:07:24.158 --> 03:07:31.504]  That's right, it's a savage, greedy, hateful, behavioral psychologist attack, and just shame on all of them.
[03:07:31.504 --> 03:07:32.825]  We should avoid them all as the plague.
[03:07:32.825 --> 03:07:33.746]  Leo, thanks for the call.
[03:07:33.746 --> 03:07:42.853]  Alright, I say this and most of the time we forget to do it, but promise me, guys, let's call Joshua and Joshua, double Joshuas, we gotta do that.
[03:07:42.853 --> 03:07:48.758]  Joshua in Georgia, Joshua in Oklahoma, never had two Joshuas on the line I think at the same time, or not at the other show at least.
[03:07:49.338 --> 03:07:51.379]  And then I'll be back, Lord willing, tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[03:07:51.379 --> 03:07:54.480]  Central after the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[03:07:54.480 --> 03:07:55.921]  The War Room's coming up in 45 minutes.
[03:07:55.921 --> 03:08:01.903]  But Gerald Cilente, the top trends forecaster, good friend of mine, is about to take over for three segments.
[03:08:01.903 --> 03:08:03.324]  So please tune in to what he has to say.
[03:08:03.324 --> 03:08:07.345]  I covered a lot of stuff, but I didn't get to it all.
[03:08:07.345 --> 03:08:10.607]  Quite frankly, so much of this is so shocking, I couldn't even get to it myself.
[03:08:10.607 --> 03:08:11.247]  It's just insane.
[03:08:12.364 --> 03:08:15.845]  Separately, we've got great partners like MyPillow.com.
[03:08:15.845 --> 03:08:25.686]  Use promo code Alex, get the biggest discounts, up to 66% off on everything from towels, to sheets, to pillows, to shoes, to beds, to so much more.

[03:08:32.507 --> 03:08:40.649]  And InfoWarsTore.com, we've got the last few days here of that 50% off sale, and that is what funds our operation.
[03:08:40.649 --> 03:08:41.529]  Got the X2 there.
[03:08:42.149 --> 03:08:43.110]  And so much more.
[03:08:43.110 --> 03:08:50.473]  All right, Gerald Cilente from Kingston, New York, takes over in the middle of this crazy dystopian takeover.
[03:08:50.473 --> 03:08:54.215]  Can't wait to hear what he has to say.
[03:08:54.215 --> 03:09:01.739]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices.
[03:09:01.739 --> 03:09:09.583]  Hiring thousands and thousands of Americans with promo code Alex with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[03:09:09.923 --> 03:09:10.523]  That's an amazing deal.
[03:09:10.523 --> 03:09:14.185]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[03:09:14.185 --> 03:09:20.048]  You can get my Keys to Dream sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[03:09:20.048 --> 03:09:25.711]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[03:09:25.711 --> 03:09:28.252]  Myself, I need the Cyber Symposium.
[03:09:28.252 --> 03:09:31.654]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[03:09:31.654 --> 03:09:33.495]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[03:09:33.495 --> 03:09:35.576]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[03:09:35.576 --> 03:09:38.898]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[03:09:39.338 --> 03:09:43.400]  It's hard to believe we're already halfway into this insane year of 2021.
[03:09:43.400 --> 03:09:47.963]  We're seeing world government, world IDs being announced, forced inoculations.
[03:09:47.963 --> 03:09:49.363]  All the tyranny we warned of is now here.
[03:10:04.611 --> 03:10:09.394]  But on the good side, there is also a global awakening the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[03:10:09.394 --> 03:10:13.537]  So truly, the battle between good and evil is now front and center.
[03:10:13.537 --> 03:10:19.481]  That's why I want to thank all the viewers and all the listeners for your support, for your word of mouth, for your prayers over the years, because without InfoWars,
[03:10:19.981 --> 03:10:24.184]  We'd be in a lot more trouble than we are right now, so again, thanks for keeping us on the air.
[03:10:24.184 --> 03:10:29.387]  And please take advantage of the big super sale, flash sale we're doing right now at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:10:29.387 --> 03:10:33.510]  A whole bunch of our best-selling products are 50% off, despite the fact they're selling out.
[03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:34.951]  That's why it's a flash sale.

[03:10:41.015 --> 03:10:41.956]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:11:16.853 --> 03:11:18.793]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:11:18.793 --> 03:11:28.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilenti.
[03:11:28.055 --> 03:11:31.676]  Hey, thank you for having me on.
[03:11:31.676 --> 03:11:37.657]  So we're in a fight for freedom, and I just got in one this last Friday.
[03:11:37.657 --> 03:11:41.338]  There's a place that I go to very frequently.
[03:11:41.338 --> 03:11:45.339]  I mean, a lot, maybe about four times a week.
[03:11:46.581 --> 03:11:51.784]  Been going there for a number of years, big supporter of their business.
[03:11:51.784 --> 03:11:58.148]  They got this little arrogant guy that's, you know, the new manager of the restaurant.
[03:11:58.148 --> 03:12:07.514]  And I'm in there about two weeks ago and I'm talking to some people and they're from India.
[03:12:07.514 --> 03:12:12.076]  And it's a very, this place is a very upscale place I go to.
[03:12:12.076 --> 03:12:14.698]  And they were visiting through here.
[03:12:16.269 --> 03:12:30.993]  And they couldn't believe all the things I knew about India, what's going on with Modi, the Citizens Act, the farmers protests, how the GDP were going down seven consecutive quarters prior to the COVID war, and on and on.
[03:12:30.993 --> 03:12:31.813]  And they're blown away.
[03:12:31.813 --> 03:12:33.434]  They want to invite me for dinner.
[03:12:33.434 --> 03:12:34.314]  I said, I'd love to.
[03:12:34.314 --> 03:12:36.135]  I said, it's Tuesday night.
[03:12:36.135 --> 03:12:38.095]  I said, I'm on deadline with the magazine.
[03:12:38.095 --> 03:12:40.716]  I can't come in.
[03:12:40.716 --> 03:12:44.717]  I can't join you, but it's great having a drink with you.
[03:12:44.717 --> 03:12:44.797]  And
[03:12:45.785 --> 03:12:50.866]  All of a sudden this arrogant guy comes over and tells them that their table is ready.
[03:12:50.866 --> 03:13:01.129]  And then he says in front of them, and I have witnesses, and people in the bar, you're talking to this guy?
[03:13:01.129 --> 03:13:02.930]  I avoid him all the time.
[03:13:02.930 --> 03:13:04.650]  I never talk to him.
[03:13:04.650 --> 03:13:10.012]  The only reason I ever said anything to him is because he introduced himself to me one time.
[03:13:10.012 --> 03:13:13.133]  I don't know why anyone would talk to this guy.
[03:13:13.133 --> 03:13:13.733]  This is a fact.
[03:13:16.041 --> 03:13:17.783]  And I got the bartender to prove it.
[03:13:17.783 --> 03:13:21.586]  He heard it.
[03:13:21.586 --> 03:13:24.328]  Of course, so do these people.
[03:13:24.328 --> 03:13:28.852]  Then he said to him, your table's ready.
[03:13:28.852 --> 03:13:30.733]  And I said, look, we're in the middle of a conversation.
[03:13:30.733 --> 03:13:32.515]  I'll be there in a few minutes.
[03:13:32.515 --> 03:13:37.319]  He said, no, they have to come now or the table will be gone in a minute and a half.
[03:13:37.319 --> 03:13:42.183]  So they leave and they look at me in a disparaging way.
[03:13:42.183 --> 03:13:43.004]  And that's the end of it.
[03:13:43.004 --> 03:13:43.724]  He comes back.
[03:13:43.724 --> 03:13:44.345]  I said, hey, man,
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:47.541]  I said, I didn't appreciate what you just did.
[03:13:47.541 --> 03:13:48.781]  Oh, he said, that's my humor.
[03:13:48.781 --> 03:13:50.262]  You don't find that funny?
[03:13:50.262 --> 03:13:53.623]  I said, I don't find it funny at all.
[03:13:53.623 --> 03:13:55.064]  He said, look, I'm really sorry.
[03:13:55.064 --> 03:13:56.164]  Let's shake hands.
[03:13:56.164 --> 03:13:57.384]  I shake hands with him.
[03:13:57.384 --> 03:14:00.065]  Well, drop it.
[03:14:00.065 --> 03:14:01.106]  I go in there Friday.
[03:14:01.106 --> 03:14:04.227]  They have a little sign on the door.
[03:14:04.227 --> 03:14:06.308]  They have to wear a mask.
[03:14:06.308 --> 03:14:08.808]  I just been in there on Thursday.
[03:14:08.808 --> 03:14:10.249]  And I didn't know you had to wear a mask.
[03:14:11.761 --> 03:14:20.963]  From the door to the bar, the door outside to the bar is maybe about eight or nine feet.
[03:14:20.963 --> 03:14:25.664]  As I'm ready to sit down at the bar, he comes over to me, he said, you know, you have to have a mask on.
[03:14:25.664 --> 03:14:26.745]  I said, yeah, I didn't know that.
[03:14:26.745 --> 03:14:27.845]  I'm sorry.
[03:14:27.845 --> 03:14:31.586]  Next time I come in, I'll put a mask on.
[03:14:31.586 --> 03:14:35.747]  He said, no, you have to put one on now.
[03:14:35.747 --> 03:14:39.408]  I said, you mean you have to wear a mask when you're at the bar?
[03:14:39.408 --> 03:14:39.908]  He said, no.
[03:14:41.872 --> 03:14:44.114]  I said, you don't have to wear a mask when you're sitting at the bar, right?
[03:14:44.114 --> 03:14:46.415]  He said, that's right.
[03:14:46.415 --> 03:14:51.078]  You're telling me I can't sit at the bar because I don't have a mask?
[03:14:51.078 --> 03:14:52.339]  He said, yeah.
[03:14:52.339 --> 03:14:54.741]  He said, what you need to do.
[03:14:54.741 --> 03:14:57.402]  I'm not making this up.
[03:14:57.402 --> 03:14:59.984]  You have to go outside.
[03:14:59.984 --> 03:15:02.005]  Put on a mask.
[03:15:02.005 --> 03:15:06.348]  Then come in and you can sit down.
[03:15:06.348 --> 03:15:07.589]  I said, OK, let me get this straight.
[03:15:07.589 --> 03:15:10.331]  You're telling me I'm at the bar now.
[03:15:10.331 --> 03:15:11.672]  I don't need a mask at the bar.
[03:15:12.233 --> 03:15:19.236]  But you're telling me that I have to go outside, put a mask on, and then come back in?
[03:15:19.236 --> 03:15:20.797]  He said, yeah, that's right.
[03:15:20.797 --> 03:15:27.039]  And I said, with people in there, and I could give a shit, a flying... I said, F you!
[03:15:27.039 --> 03:15:30.420]  Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
[03:15:30.420 --> 03:15:37.583]  You little... I can't use the word, it starts with a P. It's like penis, like penis Cheney, ya dick!
[03:15:37.583 --> 03:15:41.305]  Yeah, I call him a little but not a dick with a other letter in there.
[03:15:42.179 --> 03:15:44.381]  I said, who do you think you're talking to?
[03:15:44.381 --> 03:15:46.462]  I said, I had enough of your crap.
[03:15:46.462 --> 03:15:49.064]  You're an arrogant little boy.
[03:15:49.064 --> 03:15:51.987]  Come on outside and talk to me like that.
[03:15:51.987 --> 03:15:57.711]  Come on outside, you little piece of lowlife scum.
[03:15:57.711 --> 03:16:00.013]  He wouldn't move.
[03:16:00.013 --> 03:16:02.495]  Who do you think you are?
[03:16:02.495 --> 03:16:05.237]  I said, you're a tough little boy inside.
[03:16:05.237 --> 03:16:07.238]  Come on outside.
[03:16:07.238 --> 03:16:09.060]  Talk to me outside.
[03:16:09.060 --> 03:16:10.161]  He said, no.
[03:16:10.161 --> 03:16:11.902]  I said, no, because you're a coward.
[03:16:13.140 --> 03:16:15.941]  I go outside, I'm angry.
[03:16:15.941 --> 03:16:16.721]  I go back in.
[03:16:16.721 --> 03:16:19.921]  He said, come on outside!
[03:16:19.921 --> 03:16:23.742]  You little low-life piece of garbage crap!
[03:16:23.742 --> 03:16:26.182]  Who do you think you're talking to?
[03:16:26.182 --> 03:16:27.823]  I had enough!
[03:16:27.823 --> 03:16:33.464]  I had enough!
[03:16:33.464 --> 03:16:34.224]  He didn't move.
[03:16:34.224 --> 03:16:40.185]  This guy's about 35 years old, a foot taller than me.
[03:16:40.185 --> 03:16:41.245]  A little coward!
[03:16:42.904 --> 03:16:45.665]  A little nothing boy coward.
[03:16:45.665 --> 03:16:50.028]  The bartender comes out, you know, Gerald, you really, you know, took off in there.
[03:16:50.028 --> 03:16:51.889]  I said, you bet I did.
[03:16:51.889 --> 03:16:57.872]  This guy tells me as I'm sitting at the bar that I have to go back outside, put a mask on, then I could come in?
[03:16:57.872 --> 03:17:00.313]  Who the hell do you people think you're talking to?
[03:17:00.313 --> 03:17:01.994]  Who do you think you're talking to?
[03:17:01.994 --> 03:17:10.418]  I just told the owner today, as I supported you guys a thousand percent,
[03:17:13.211 --> 03:17:14.932]  I'm not going back into your place.
[03:17:14.932 --> 03:17:16.532]  That's it.
[03:17:16.532 --> 03:17:17.473]  You got this guy in there?
[03:17:17.473 --> 03:17:21.154]  This isn't a place for me.
[03:17:21.154 --> 03:17:25.276]  And if it gets ugly, it'll get a lot uglier because I'll go with this.
[03:17:25.276 --> 03:17:27.857]  Who the hell are they to do this?
[03:17:27.857 --> 03:17:29.838]  And this is what's going on everywhere.
[03:17:29.838 --> 03:17:37.982]  You got these little, creepy, nothings, all of a sudden on a power trip.
[03:17:37.982 --> 03:17:40.943]  These little low-life pieces of scum.
[03:17:42.637 --> 03:17:45.958]  Now on a power trip telling you what to do.
[03:17:45.958 --> 03:17:49.599]  I'm fighting.
[03:17:49.599 --> 03:17:53.000]  I am a fighter.
[03:17:53.000 --> 03:17:57.682]  I, Gerald Solenti, am a freedom fighter.
[03:17:57.682 --> 03:18:06.425]  That's why I own the most historic four corners in America, where the seeds of democracy were sown.
[03:18:06.425 --> 03:18:09.826]  That's why I don't suck up or bow down anybody.
[03:18:10.683 --> 03:18:13.685]  Who are these people to talk to me like that?
[03:18:13.685 --> 03:18:17.068]  Who are these people to tell me I must do this and must do that?
[03:18:17.068 --> 03:18:18.649]  This is not my America!
[03:18:18.649 --> 03:18:23.773]  And it's all over the world.
[03:18:23.773 --> 03:18:27.276]  One country after another.
[03:18:27.276 --> 03:18:29.257]  One country after another.
[03:18:29.257 --> 03:18:31.859]  Look at that little freak, de Blasio.
[03:18:31.859 --> 03:18:33.721]  You know what he says?
[03:18:33.721 --> 03:18:37.443]  This Friday.
[03:18:37.443 --> 03:18:39.225]  The key to New York City pass
[03:18:40.049 --> 03:18:43.591]  This is what's going to happen all over the country.
[03:18:43.591 --> 03:18:47.312]  Make no mistake.
[03:18:47.312 --> 03:18:52.254]  Then he goes on to say, you ready?
[03:18:52.254 --> 03:19:03.379]  If people want freedom, if people want jobs, if people want to live again, we have to get more people vaccinated.
[03:19:05.259 --> 03:19:15.566]  That little cut son, Macron, another little guy with a pair of cojones, smaller than a mothball, like this little boy over here that wanted to screw with me!
[03:19:15.566 --> 03:19:20.209]  Little mothball freaky boys!
[03:19:20.209 --> 03:19:25.613]  Telling the French people, get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated.
[03:19:25.613 --> 03:19:29.635]  It's a question of being a good citizen.
[03:19:29.635 --> 03:19:31.777]  Our freedom is worth nothing.
[03:19:34.400 --> 03:19:35.542]  We don't get vaccinated.
[03:19:35.542 --> 03:19:36.583]  You ready?
[03:19:36.583 --> 03:19:38.586]  You got it?
[03:19:38.586 --> 03:19:41.589]  We're in a fight for our freedom!
[03:19:41.589 --> 03:19:44.593]  You better support InfoWars!
[03:19:44.593 --> 03:19:46.916]  And support the Transjournal!
[03:19:46.916 --> 03:19:48.498]  Support Occupy Peace!
[03:19:53.486 --> 03:20:07.331]  You know, listeners call into the show and they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic, because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together.
[03:20:07.331 --> 03:20:12.693]  And it gets old having to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them or we won't be here on air.
[03:20:12.693 --> 03:20:13.393]  But it's true.
[03:20:13.393 --> 03:20:16.795]  We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level.
[03:20:17.535 --> 03:20:20.018]  That is not beholden to the big corporate sponsors.
[03:20:20.018 --> 03:20:22.081]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[03:20:22.081 --> 03:20:23.843]  They've crippled all the other groups.
[03:20:23.843 --> 03:20:24.724]  And we're still here.
[03:20:24.724 --> 03:20:29.149]  And as this whole New World Order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[03:20:29.149 --> 03:20:30.771]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[03:20:30.771 --> 03:20:32.914]  That's why America has got to be taken down.
[03:20:32.914 --> 03:20:36.718]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still quasi-free.
[03:20:37.239 --> 03:20:39.559]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[03:21:04.420 --> 03:21:09.162]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[03:21:09.162 --> 03:21:11.503]  Super Male Vitality!
[03:21:11.503 --> 03:21:20.347]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[03:21:20.347 --> 03:21:31.211]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[03:21:31.511 --> 03:21:32.191]  Yes.
[03:21:32.191 --> 03:21:37.114]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[03:21:37.114 --> 03:21:43.918]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[03:21:43.918 --> 03:21:45.079]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:21:45.079 --> 03:21:46.940]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[03:21:46.940 --> 03:21:49.742]  Never been a better time than right now.
[03:21:49.742 --> 03:21:53.244]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:21:54.484 --> 03:21:58.106]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[03:21:58.106 --> 03:22:02.648]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all gonna pass.
[03:22:02.648 --> 03:22:11.872]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta, and you go into the point of being culled, being totally enslaved.
[03:22:11.872 --> 03:22:15.994]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[03:22:16.314 --> 03:22:33.873]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with a third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load, capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees.
[03:22:34.440 --> 03:22:50.286]  Not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwab are saying, and Bill Gates is saying, but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[03:22:50.286 --> 03:22:53.708]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[03:22:54.406 --> 03:23:03.697]  You've got amazing shoes, amazing pillows, towels, sheets, beds for humans, beds for dogs, beds for cats, all amazing products at already very low prices, hiring thousands and thousands of Americans.
[03:23:03.697 --> 03:23:09.844]  And with promo code ALEX with MyPillow.com or FrankSpeech.com or any of your sites, they get the very best discount.
[03:23:09.844 --> 03:23:10.265]  It's an amazing deal.
[03:23:10.385 --> 03:23:13.727]  You get my six-pack of towels for $39.99, normally $109.99.
[03:23:13.727 --> 03:23:20.291]  You can get my games and dream sheets, normally $100 and some dollars a set, as low as $49.99 a set.
[03:23:20.291 --> 03:23:25.955]  I took everything and just passed the savings on because we need support right now for what's going on.
[03:23:25.955 --> 03:23:28.496]  Myself, I need this for the Cyber Symposium.
[03:23:28.496 --> 03:23:31.878]  I just lost a million-dollar-a-week revenue by telling Fox, you know what?
[03:23:31.878 --> 03:23:33.740]  I'm not going to succumb to your cancel culture.
[03:23:33.740 --> 03:23:35.801]  We're going to bring the word out on our own.
[03:23:35.801 --> 03:23:39.123]  Your best specials use the promo code ALEX and you're supporting.
[03:23:39.483 --> 03:23:42.585]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:24:16.118 --> 03:24:19.479]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:19.479 --> 03:24:25.700]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:28.200]  Hey, great being back on with Alex Jones.
[03:24:28.200 --> 03:24:32.261]  And again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:24:32.261 --> 03:24:35.542]  Because this thing's going down, man.
[03:24:35.542 --> 03:24:36.662]  New York.
[03:24:36.662 --> 03:24:40.523]  You know, I was born in the Bronx.
[03:24:40.523 --> 03:24:43.904]  Yeah, I learned how to fight as a little kid.
[03:24:43.904 --> 03:24:45.164]  It was a real New York.
[03:24:46.425 --> 03:24:48.486]  Now New York is this.
[03:24:48.486 --> 03:24:51.847]  It's the city of cowards.
[03:24:51.847 --> 03:25:00.729]  Little creepy cowards that believe and bow down to a de Blasio.
[03:25:00.729 --> 03:25:07.391]  A sloppy guy who never worked a day in his life and sucking off the public tip.
[03:25:09.818 --> 03:25:12.059]  How could you take orders from this clown?
[03:25:12.059 --> 03:25:14.439]  Oh, his name isn't de Blasio, you know.
[03:25:14.439 --> 03:25:17.480]  It's Warren Wilhelm Jr.
[03:25:17.480 --> 03:25:18.760]  Yeah.
[03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:20.521]  Giving mandates.
[03:25:20.521 --> 03:25:23.542]  And where are the fighters?
[03:25:23.542 --> 03:25:25.442]  Where are the restaurants?
[03:25:25.442 --> 03:25:26.963]  Oh, that little Danny Myers?
[03:25:26.963 --> 03:25:29.643]  Oh, you gotta get a vaccination to get in.
[03:25:29.643 --> 03:25:31.924]  Yeah.
[03:25:31.924 --> 03:25:34.825]  One after another, how could they
[03:25:36.204 --> 03:25:41.748]  How could they take orders from this piece of scum?
[03:25:41.748 --> 03:25:44.951]  Who the hell are you to give a mandate?
[03:25:44.951 --> 03:25:46.192]  Give a mandate?
[03:25:46.192 --> 03:25:51.335]  You should take that mandate and shove it up your you-know-what mandate.
[03:25:51.335 --> 03:25:52.516]  I'm an American.
[03:25:52.516 --> 03:25:54.278]  I'll tell you what, de Blasio.
[03:25:54.278 --> 03:25:57.540]  You come over here and force me to get vaccinated.
[03:25:57.540 --> 03:25:57.880]  Come on.
[03:25:57.880 --> 03:25:58.521]  Come over here.
[03:25:58.521 --> 03:26:01.723]  Hey, you're about a foot and a half taller than me.
[03:26:01.723 --> 03:26:02.404]  Come on.
[03:26:02.404 --> 03:26:02.704]  Come on.
[03:26:04.139 --> 03:26:09.022]  Maybe you double up with a little clown kid that tried to get tough with me.
[03:26:09.022 --> 03:26:11.523]  Maybe the both of yous could come at me.
[03:26:11.523 --> 03:26:13.564]  The fight is gone in New York.
[03:26:13.564 --> 03:26:19.387]  It's a city of cowards that they're letting... Where are all the restauranteurs?
[03:26:19.387 --> 03:26:21.168]  Where are all the business people?
[03:26:21.168 --> 03:26:21.708]  Gym?
[03:26:21.708 --> 03:26:23.409]  Oh, you're a gym person?
[03:26:23.409 --> 03:26:27.431]  Oh, you're lifting weights and getting strong?
[03:26:27.431 --> 03:26:29.372]  And you're telling the mayor?
[03:26:29.372 --> 03:26:32.274]  The mayor's telling you that you have to get vaccinated?
[03:26:33.499 --> 03:26:35.841]  What Jim?
[03:26:35.841 --> 03:26:38.782]  Jim Crow!
[03:26:38.782 --> 03:26:40.684]  Yeah!
[03:26:40.684 --> 03:26:42.805]  That's it!
[03:26:42.805 --> 03:26:44.986]  That's what it's become!
[03:26:44.986 --> 03:26:47.708]  Slave-landia!
[03:26:47.708 --> 03:26:51.731]  All we are are plantation workers on Slave-landia!
[03:26:51.731 --> 03:26:55.974]  The Mayor has given us a mandate!
[03:26:55.974 --> 03:26:57.434]  Calm down, Selente!
[03:26:57.434 --> 03:27:00.797]  Bend over and take that mandate like we do!
[03:27:00.797 --> 03:27:02.638]  Take it in the arm or take it up the you-know-what!
[03:27:06.135 --> 03:27:07.556]  Yeah.
[03:27:07.556 --> 03:27:10.779]  Blasio.
[03:27:10.779 --> 03:27:12.720]  Make no mistake.
[03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:20.706]  What we have in place related to indoor dining, indoor entertainment, indoor fitness is the shape of things to come.
[03:27:20.706 --> 03:27:23.568]  You're going to see more and more companies do the same thing.
[03:27:23.568 --> 03:27:32.335]  You're going to see more and more cities, more countries, more states do the same thing because it's time.
[03:27:32.335 --> 03:27:33.356]  Because it's time.
[03:27:36.463 --> 03:27:45.790]  And I want to thank President Joe Biden, who I'll bow down to and take it up the you-know-what, because that's how I got to where I am.
[03:27:45.790 --> 03:27:49.793]  I've been sucking up and bowing down my entire life.
[03:27:49.793 --> 03:27:53.636]  I'm Bill de Blasio and I am in power!
[03:27:53.636 --> 03:27:54.957]  Wilhelm Jr.!
[03:27:54.957 --> 03:27:55.357]  Wilhelm Jr.!
[03:27:55.357 --> 03:27:57.118]  Warren Wilhelm Jr.! !
[03:28:06.561 --> 03:28:12.303]  Who embraced this idea immediately being locked down.
[03:28:12.303 --> 03:28:15.005]  If people want freedom, yep.
[03:28:15.005 --> 03:28:17.826]  I'm not making this crap up.
[03:28:17.826 --> 03:28:21.347]  And I said that little cut so McCrone over there in France.
[03:28:21.347 --> 03:28:23.628]  Get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated.
[03:28:23.628 --> 03:28:26.509]  It's a time of being a good citizen.
[03:28:26.509 --> 03:28:29.050]  Our freedom is worth nothing.
[03:28:29.050 --> 03:28:30.731]  If we don't get the jab.
[03:28:30.731 --> 03:28:35.013]  And they had these big protests as they have, I saw it on Infowars, they had those great clips.
[03:28:36.013 --> 03:28:39.035]  Of the big protests in France last week.
[03:28:39.035 --> 03:28:44.818]  This is the fourth week in a row, over 250,000 people taking to the streets.
[03:28:44.818 --> 03:28:48.040]  Where do you see that in America?
[03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:50.941]  The country of cowards.
[03:28:50.941 --> 03:28:52.002]  Where is it in America?
[03:28:52.002 --> 03:28:54.043]  Where are all the protests?
[03:28:54.043 --> 03:28:57.785]  I had, last 4th of July, remember how everybody hated me?
[03:28:57.785 --> 03:29:02.888]  For having a rally here, Judge Napolitano here, other speakers.
[03:29:02.888 --> 03:29:05.349]  This is when everything was locked down, you couldn't open up, and I did it.
[03:29:06.303 --> 03:29:13.548]  I had another one on Memorial Day and on the 4th of July.
[03:29:13.548 --> 03:29:15.309]  I'm fighting.
[03:29:15.309 --> 03:29:17.890]  United we stand, divided we fall.
[03:29:17.890 --> 03:29:20.232]  If we don't unite, we're finished.
[03:29:20.232 --> 03:29:22.613]  We're finished.
[03:29:22.613 --> 03:29:26.796]  We should have millions of people like they're doing in France.
[03:29:26.796 --> 03:29:28.837]  Look at this.
[03:29:28.837 --> 03:29:30.798]  And we have nothing in America.
[03:29:30.798 --> 03:29:33.860]  The country of cowards.
[03:29:33.860 --> 03:29:35.201]  That's what this has turned into.
[03:29:37.866 --> 03:29:41.129]  We are the tireless minority.
[03:29:41.129 --> 03:29:50.396]  As Samuel Adams said, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate tireless minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom in the minds of men.
[03:29:50.396 --> 03:29:57.081]  And if our tireless minority unite with a plan, a focus, we can defeat this.
[03:29:57.081 --> 03:29:58.903]  And it's the only way we're going to win.
[03:29:58.903 --> 03:30:02.546]  And it has to be done totally peacefully.
[03:30:02.546 --> 03:30:03.947]  Totally peacefully.
[03:30:06.331 --> 03:30:08.891]  We could win.
[03:30:08.891 --> 03:30:18.813]  Because I estimate there are at least 30-35% of the people that are ready to fight.
[03:30:18.813 --> 03:30:23.374]  And that other 70% they're not fighters.
[03:30:23.374 --> 03:30:27.355]  Out of that 70% you're lucky to get 4-5% fighters.
[03:30:27.355 --> 03:30:29.195]  They're followers.
[03:30:29.195 --> 03:30:30.855]  They're the herd.
[03:30:30.855 --> 03:30:33.856]  Looking for that herd mentality.
[03:30:33.856 --> 03:30:35.036]  Yeah, that's who they are.
[03:30:37.202 --> 03:30:42.405]  Heard.
[03:30:42.405 --> 03:30:44.206]  We have to fight.
[03:30:44.206 --> 03:30:50.050]  This is truly a matter of life and death.
[03:30:50.050 --> 03:30:53.512]  Why would anybody believe a drug dealer?
[03:30:53.512 --> 03:30:57.654]  How stupid can you be to believe a drug dealer?
[03:30:57.654 --> 03:31:05.479]  An Operation Warp Speed gene therapy shot that has still not been approved by the FDA.
[03:31:06.579 --> 03:31:11.203]  How can you believe a drug dealer?
[03:31:11.203 --> 03:31:14.926]  And they're doing it.
[03:31:14.926 --> 03:31:18.508]  If we don't fight for our freedom, it's finished.
[03:31:18.508 --> 03:31:22.571]  It's finished.
[03:31:22.571 --> 03:31:24.633]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:31:24.633 --> 03:31:27.135]  This is serious.
[03:31:27.135 --> 03:31:28.496]  And of course, the Trends Journal.
[03:31:28.496 --> 03:31:30.197]  TrendsJournal.com.
[03:31:30.197 --> 03:31:31.939]  There's no magazine like that.
[03:31:31.939 --> 03:31:33.500]  That little liar, Walensky.
[03:31:34.662 --> 03:31:37.903]  Yeah, she keeps changing her mind back and forth.
[03:31:37.903 --> 03:31:38.103]  Ms.
[03:31:38.103 --> 03:31:44.305]  Fatya Brut, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
[03:31:44.305 --> 03:31:51.308]  She was on this past Thursday with CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
[03:31:51.308 --> 03:31:52.568]  What Wolf Blitzer?
[03:31:52.568 --> 03:31:55.389]  Little Mouse Blitzer.
[03:31:55.389 --> 03:32:03.452]  And she goes on to say that, quote, our vaccines are working exceptionally well.
[03:32:04.485 --> 03:32:10.368]  Okay, they're working exceptionally well, right?
[03:32:10.368 --> 03:32:15.471]  They continue to work well.
[03:32:15.471 --> 03:32:19.374]  They prevent illness and health, as she goes on to say.
[03:32:19.374 --> 03:32:27.618]  But they can't do any more, but what they can't do any more is prevent transmission.
[03:32:27.618 --> 03:32:29.740]  Who would believe there's two clown shows?
[03:32:29.740 --> 03:32:32.881]  Look at these idiot, arrogant people telling us how to live.
[03:32:35.123 --> 03:32:39.085]  You just said the vaccines are working exceptionally well.
[03:32:39.085 --> 03:32:44.487]  Then you said, but what they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.
[03:32:44.487 --> 03:32:48.709]  So what are you talking about?
[03:32:48.709 --> 03:32:55.212]  How about BS?
[03:32:55.212 --> 03:33:03.216]  They continue to work well, but what they can't do is prevent transmission.
[03:33:03.216 --> 03:33:03.916]  So why get it?
[03:33:04.557 --> 03:33:12.003]  What happened up there in Providencetown, Mass?
[03:33:12.003 --> 03:33:15.967]  76% of the people that got the cases?
[03:33:15.967 --> 03:33:19.409]  76% were vaccinated.
[03:33:19.409 --> 03:33:21.451]  These are facts.
[03:33:21.451 --> 03:33:23.873]  So how about the herd immunity?
[03:33:23.873 --> 03:33:25.034]  The herd immunity.
[03:33:25.034 --> 03:33:28.397]  It's the herd that believes in herd immunity.
[03:33:28.397 --> 03:33:30.539]  It's the herd that believes in drug dealers.
[03:33:32.125 --> 03:33:35.169]  And that's who's running and ruining our lives.
[03:33:35.169 --> 03:33:38.573]  These are nothing more than drug dealers.
[03:33:38.573 --> 03:33:45.701]  How could anybody believe a Lewin Lewilinski there?
[03:33:45.701 --> 03:33:48.424]  Again, support InfoWars.
[03:33:48.424 --> 03:33:49.185]  Support the truth.
[03:33:53.115 --> 03:33:59.737]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.
[03:33:59.737 --> 03:34:03.178]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[03:34:12.100 --> 03:34:20.242]  Alpha Power's incredible ingredients can help you boost your sports performance or enhance your day-to-day life with ease while encouraging hormonal balance.
[03:34:20.862 --> 03:34:26.286]  Perfect by itself or with super male vitality in the true alpha male pack.
[03:34:26.286 --> 03:34:33.512]  Alpha Power can help boost performance, help maintain normal testosterone levels, support healthy cholesterol and more.
[03:34:33.512 --> 03:34:37.214]  Let Alpha Power help bring you to the peak of your optimal health.
[03:34:37.214 --> 03:34:40.257]  Don't fall short on energy in the fight against tyranny.
[03:34:40.257 --> 03:34:44.300]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[03:34:44.300 --> 03:34:46.802]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[03:34:52.682 --> 03:34:55.145]  The world is awakening.
[03:34:55.145 --> 03:34:58.648]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[03:34:58.648 --> 03:35:09.960]  They are discovering the globalists, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderberg Group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[03:35:09.960 --> 03:35:12.562]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning,
[03:35:13.749 --> 03:35:19.711]  The truth is, they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing.
[03:35:19.711 --> 03:35:22.853]  We have forced them out in the open.
[03:35:22.853 --> 03:35:28.675]  So as bad as these times are, and a lot of negative things are about to happen, realize humanity is winning.
[03:35:28.675 --> 03:35:30.656]  You've got to trust in the plan of God.
[03:35:31.216 --> 03:35:31.717]  We're good to go.
[03:35:53.806 --> 03:36:01.310]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[03:36:01.310 --> 03:36:06.832]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[03:36:06.832 --> 03:36:14.696]  But the good news is we've been working, and you've been working, and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to fight it off.
[03:36:14.696 --> 03:36:16.157]  Humanity is strong.
[03:36:16.157 --> 03:36:17.137]  We're incredible.
[03:36:17.137 --> 03:36:20.899]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[03:36:20.899 --> 03:36:23.040]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:29.704]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[03:36:29.704 --> 03:36:39.369]  At the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential, because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[03:36:39.369 --> 03:36:41.691]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:36:41.691 --> 03:36:44.332]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[03:36:44.332 --> 03:36:49.675]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are back in, like bodies, basil beets, and others.

[03:37:35.902 --> 03:37:37.823]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:38:13.775 --> 03:38:16.177]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:38:16.177 --> 03:38:18.879]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:38:18.879 --> 03:38:21.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:24.022]  Welcome, welcome back to InfoWars.
[03:38:24.022 --> 03:38:27.924]  As I said, if we don't unite, united we stand, divided we fall.
[03:38:27.924 --> 03:38:29.946]  You have to support us.
[03:38:31.514 --> 03:38:36.276]  Whether it's Trends Journal, Occupy Peace, and InfoWars has these great sales.
[03:38:36.276 --> 03:38:37.416]  Look at the show that they put on.
[03:38:37.416 --> 03:38:38.777]  Look at the staff that they have.
[03:38:38.777 --> 03:38:41.078]  Look at the work that they put out.
[03:38:41.078 --> 03:38:46.900]  I go to their site, I can't believe the amount of stories and articles and all the information they have.
[03:38:46.900 --> 03:38:56.624]  So now they have this flash sale going on, and you could save up to 50% off some of their top products, and you should get them before they're gone, because they're going to go quick.
[03:38:56.624 --> 03:38:59.485]  And they're glad to announce that this limited time flash sale

[03:39:09.031 --> 03:39:11.652]  So you want to stock up now.
[03:39:11.652 --> 03:39:14.413]  You just heard that Clown de Blasio.
[03:39:14.413 --> 03:39:17.274]  We're looking at another imminent lockdown.
[03:39:17.274 --> 03:39:19.735]  So TurboForce, 50% off.

[03:40:12.032 --> 03:40:18.615]  We need to launch to the next level because if we don't, it's finished right in front of our eyes.
[03:40:18.615 --> 03:40:25.457]  Look at the story I told you about this guy telling me after I'm at the bar and he's telling me I have to
[03:40:26.258 --> 03:40:26.658]  I can.
[03:40:26.658 --> 03:40:29.580]  Yes, I could drink at the bar without a mask on.
[03:40:29.580 --> 03:40:30.160]  Isn't that great?
[03:40:30.160 --> 03:40:30.580]  You're allowed.
[03:40:30.580 --> 03:40:34.603]  But we'll have those masks soon that you have to put on to drink through.
[03:40:34.603 --> 03:40:36.704]  But I didn't come in with one.
[03:40:36.704 --> 03:40:40.346]  So I have to go outside, put on a mask.
[03:40:40.346 --> 03:40:43.687]  And then come back in and I could sit down.
[03:40:43.687 --> 03:40:46.009]  Can you imagine somebody talking to me like this?
[03:40:46.009 --> 03:40:47.189]  Or to anybody?
[03:40:47.189 --> 03:40:49.951]  And how many people would do that?
[03:40:49.951 --> 03:40:53.933]  Well, in the U.S.S.A., the United Soviet States of America, a lot of them would do.
[03:40:56.087 --> 03:41:01.008]  And again, I'm a New Yorker, a true New Yorker.
[03:41:01.008 --> 03:41:06.770]  I'm born 1946, blessed to be where I was.
[03:41:06.770 --> 03:41:09.491]  America was free.
[03:41:09.491 --> 03:41:11.931]  My father may his soul rest in peace.
[03:41:11.931 --> 03:41:17.673]  Anytime I would repeat anything that everybody else was saying, he'd say to me in Italian, Papagallo!
[03:41:17.673 --> 03:41:18.613]  Parrot!
[03:41:18.613 --> 03:41:23.074]  Stop repeating what everybody else is saying and think for yourself.
[03:41:23.074 --> 03:41:25.835]  Now you're not allowed to think anymore for yourself!
[03:41:26.539 --> 03:41:28.941]  You must obey Warren William Jr.
[03:41:28.941 --> 03:41:33.965]  or some other little piece of garbage political crap.
[03:41:33.965 --> 03:41:37.347]  And I love these words, these health officials.
[03:41:37.347 --> 03:41:40.329]  Low-life bureaucrats.
[03:41:40.329 --> 03:41:41.610]  That's all they are.
[03:41:41.610 --> 03:41:43.812]  They don't work in a real world.
[03:41:43.812 --> 03:41:47.334]  They're bureaucrats.
[03:41:47.334 --> 03:41:54.800]  You can't think for yourself why that's a conspiracy theory to think for yourself and not believe the crap that's being shoved down your throat.
[03:41:56.764 --> 03:41:59.665]  Speaking of which, phew!
[03:41:59.665 --> 03:42:01.586]  Gold took a big hit, man.
[03:42:01.586 --> 03:42:03.107]  Wow.
[03:42:03.107 --> 03:42:04.468]  Way down.
[03:42:04.468 --> 03:42:06.689]  150 points.
[03:42:06.689 --> 03:42:07.549]  You know.
[03:42:07.549 --> 03:42:08.970]  Why?
[03:42:08.970 --> 03:42:14.673]  Well, the Federal Reserve is going to ease up on their tapering.
[03:42:14.673 --> 03:42:18.094]  Well, we don't see that happening.
[03:42:18.094 --> 03:42:19.955]  Oh, but loot all the jobs that were created.
[03:42:19.955 --> 03:42:21.556]  Yeah, we have a lot of them created.
[03:42:21.556 --> 03:42:25.078]  Oh, and the hospitality and restaurant sector.
[03:42:25.078 --> 03:42:25.238]  Yeah.
[03:42:26.784 --> 03:42:35.008]  And now with new mandates going in place, how's the hospitality and restaurant and travel sector going to do?
[03:42:35.008 --> 03:42:39.610]  They're going to do terrible.
[03:42:39.610 --> 03:42:46.193]  You're already hearing from companies telling their people, well, you're not coming back on Labor Day.
[03:42:46.193 --> 03:42:47.734]  This is what they said last Labor Day.
[03:42:47.734 --> 03:42:50.775]  They would be back after Labor Day.
[03:42:50.775 --> 03:42:54.037]  And by the way, Labor Day, Washington, D.C.,
[03:42:54.997 --> 03:43:03.940]  I'm going to be one of the keynote speakers at Ron Paul's War on Us Peace and Prosperity Conference.
[03:43:03.940 --> 03:43:06.161]  So please be there.
[03:43:06.161 --> 03:43:08.581]  Go to Liberty Report.
[03:43:08.581 --> 03:43:19.245]  And next, the 19th, I'll be down in Phoenix at Max Keiser's Bitcoin Conference.
[03:43:19.245 --> 03:43:22.066]  So support.
[03:43:22.066 --> 03:43:23.306]  And again, Ron Paul.
[03:43:24.218 --> 03:43:26.600]  That's the last person I voted for president.
[03:43:26.600 --> 03:43:32.403]  The one before that was Ralph Nader.
[03:43:32.403 --> 03:43:34.805]  So do what you can to support us.
[03:43:34.805 --> 03:43:36.306]  Because if we don't unite, we're finished.
[03:43:36.306 --> 03:43:38.267]  This is unprecedented.
[03:43:38.267 --> 03:43:43.110]  Who'd believe that we're even talking about this?
[03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:45.951]  So the products, it's not like you're getting nothing for these products.
[03:43:45.951 --> 03:43:48.193]  You know, you're getting some great stuff.
[03:43:48.193 --> 03:43:49.874]  So going back to the equity markets.
[03:43:51.195 --> 03:43:53.256]  This thing is closing down.
[03:43:53.256 --> 03:43:55.657]  I mean, you see the protests in France.
[03:43:55.657 --> 03:43:56.958]  Minor protests in Italy.
[03:43:56.958 --> 03:43:58.439]  The Italians have lost their fight.
[03:43:58.439 --> 03:44:01.741]  I was just with Italian people over the weekend from Italy.
[03:44:01.741 --> 03:44:03.342]  And I told them, you guys lost your fight.
[03:44:03.342 --> 03:44:04.262]  They admit it.
[03:44:04.262 --> 03:44:06.343]  They admit it.
[03:44:06.343 --> 03:44:08.905]  They admit it.
[03:44:08.905 --> 03:44:12.647]  And Americans lost their fight.
[03:44:12.647 --> 03:44:15.929]  Look what's going on.
[03:44:15.929 --> 03:44:18.450]  There's a place up here called the Omega Institute.
[03:44:19.858 --> 03:44:21.699]  And it's supposed to be a new age place.
[03:44:21.699 --> 03:44:24.261]  I used to go there all the time.
[03:44:24.261 --> 03:44:25.582]  I knew a lot of people there.
[03:44:25.582 --> 03:44:30.124]  I knew the guy that, you know, the top guy running the place, you know, when they were doing it.
[03:44:30.124 --> 03:44:40.971]  And now, Statement on Rhinebeck Campus 2021, Reopening and COVID Safety Policy.
[03:44:40.971 --> 03:44:48.256]  Omega is requiring staff, faculty, visitors, and program participants
[03:44:48.891 --> 03:44:55.636]  To be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 prior to arriving on campus.
[03:44:55.636 --> 03:44:59.598]  This is supposed to be a new age place.
[03:44:59.598 --> 03:45:00.659]  Whole health healing.
[03:45:00.659 --> 03:45:02.580]  You know that kind of thing?
[03:45:02.580 --> 03:45:04.102]  Yeah.
[03:45:04.102 --> 03:45:08.745]  Oh, yoga and meditation.
[03:45:08.745 --> 03:45:09.926]  Get a vaccination.
[03:45:09.926 --> 03:45:11.246]  Take it anywhere you can take it.
[03:45:11.246 --> 03:45:12.787]  You'll be free to be nothing.
[03:45:12.787 --> 03:45:14.729]  Nothing but a coward at Omega.
[03:45:15.532 --> 03:45:18.034]  Can you believe this crap?
[03:45:18.034 --> 03:45:20.035]  Shove the vax!
[03:45:20.035 --> 03:45:24.778]  Who the hell are you to tell people to get vaccinated?
[03:45:24.778 --> 03:45:26.339]  Who is anybody?
[03:45:26.339 --> 03:45:32.383]  In Operation Warp Speed, you gotta be Warp Ted.
[03:45:32.383 --> 03:45:34.804]  Gene therapy shot.
[03:45:34.804 --> 03:45:37.086]  And then they got a whole list of here.
[03:45:37.086 --> 03:45:40.148]  Here's what we're doing for your safety and well-being.
[03:45:40.148 --> 03:45:43.210]  CDC, New York State, and Dutchess County Guideline Compliance.
[03:45:45.627 --> 03:45:48.529]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[03:45:48.529 --> 03:45:49.830]  On and on and on and on.
[03:45:49.830 --> 03:45:51.691]  They even have that stupid stuff.
[03:45:51.691 --> 03:45:54.233]  They have plexiglass up.
[03:45:54.233 --> 03:45:55.194]  Yeah, the plexiglass.
[03:45:55.194 --> 03:45:56.475]  It stays right at the plexiglass.
[03:45:56.475 --> 03:45:57.115]  It doesn't go under.
[03:45:57.115 --> 03:46:00.057]  It doesn't go around it.
[03:46:00.057 --> 03:46:08.883]  Plexiglass dividers inside maid office and other communications areas to create a barrier from front desk staff.
[03:46:08.883 --> 03:46:11.025]  Oh yeah, make sure you wipe everything.
[03:46:11.025 --> 03:46:12.946]  Yeah, the odds of getting it are only
[03:46:13.974 --> 03:46:16.436]  One in 10,000 from picking it up from the surface.
[03:46:16.436 --> 03:46:19.638]  Remember everybody wiping everything down?
[03:46:19.638 --> 03:46:20.459]  Yeah.
[03:46:20.459 --> 03:46:22.721]  Don't forget.
[03:46:22.721 --> 03:46:23.942]  Wipe your hands.
[03:46:23.942 --> 03:46:27.464]  Sanitize them.
[03:46:27.464 --> 03:46:32.568]  So also, going back to the equities, this is very serious.
[03:46:32.568 --> 03:46:35.030]  This is a fake market.
[03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:43.637]  With Italy being locked down, France, other countries requiring passports, business is going to go down.
[03:46:44.443 --> 03:46:49.046]  I mentioned about all the businesses that are telling their workers to stay home.
[03:46:49.046 --> 03:46:53.049]  What's that going to do to the commercial real estate sector?
[03:46:53.049 --> 03:46:56.992]  Your office occupancy rate in New York City is about 22%.
[03:46:56.992 --> 03:47:00.334]  Nationwide, it's about 35%.
[03:47:00.334 --> 03:47:02.876]  All the businesses that depend on commuters, what are they going to do?
[03:47:02.876 --> 03:47:08.260]  What are they going to do?
[03:47:08.260 --> 03:47:09.501]  What are they going to do?
[03:47:12.366 --> 03:47:13.846]  They're going to go out of business.
[03:47:13.846 --> 03:47:16.507]  But the bigs will get bigger.
[03:47:16.507 --> 03:47:18.948]  The rich will get richer.
[03:47:18.948 --> 03:47:22.448]  And they'll all go to Obama's next birthday party.
[03:47:22.448 --> 03:47:23.909]  Yeah.
[03:47:23.909 --> 03:47:29.050]  Like Alex just showed, flying in on their private jets, closing down the streets.
[03:47:29.050 --> 03:47:30.190]  Yeah, nothing!
[03:47:30.190 --> 03:47:31.991]  Royalty is here!
[03:47:31.991 --> 03:47:34.471]  That's a curse word, by the way.
[03:47:34.471 --> 03:47:38.252]  Calling people dignitaries, royalty.
[03:47:38.252 --> 03:47:39.072]  Look at this.
[03:47:39.072 --> 03:47:39.733]  Look at it.
[03:47:39.733 --> 03:47:41.213]  Yeah, one tight cat, man.
[03:47:41.795 --> 03:47:43.937]  Look at that.
[03:47:43.937 --> 03:47:48.922]  Not a drop of boogie, not an ounce of jive.
[03:47:48.922 --> 03:47:53.326]  So, I am very upset.
[03:47:53.326 --> 03:47:54.387]  I'm very concerned.
[03:47:54.387 --> 03:47:55.228]  I'm a visionary.
[03:47:55.228 --> 03:47:57.890]  I'll put my track record up against anybody in the world.
[03:47:57.890 --> 03:48:02.675]  Show me a book, show me a magazine, show me what you've done and we can begin talking.
[03:48:02.675 --> 03:48:06.258]  If we don't fight for freedom now, it's going to be hell on earth.
[03:48:06.258 --> 03:48:06.919]  It already is.
[03:48:09.201 --> 03:48:10.041]  It's going to get worse.
[03:48:10.041 --> 03:48:12.182]  So do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:48:12.182 --> 03:48:15.324]  Go to TrendsJournal.com for the magazine.
[03:48:15.324 --> 03:48:17.485]  There's no magazine like it in the world.
[03:48:17.485 --> 03:48:20.306]  Help you prepare, prevail, and prosper in these terrible times.
[03:48:20.306 --> 03:48:23.007]  We're telling you what's going on, what it means, and what's next.
[03:48:23.007 --> 03:48:24.868]  And support Occupy Peace.
[03:48:24.868 --> 03:48:26.729]  OccupyPeace.com.
[03:48:26.729 --> 03:48:29.930]  We're thinking of doing another rally very shortly.
[03:48:29.930 --> 03:48:31.391]  But we need your support to do it.
[03:48:31.391 --> 03:48:32.452]  We must unite.
[03:48:32.452 --> 03:48:33.872]  We must unite.
[03:48:33.872 --> 03:48:35.273]  And we believe we know how to do that.
[03:48:35.273 --> 03:48:37.474]  So thank you very much for tuning in.
[03:48:38.594 --> 03:48:41.512]  And we're going to see you next week!
[03:48:41.512 --> 03:48:41.653]  Ciao!
