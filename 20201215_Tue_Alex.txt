[00:00.000 --> 00:13.120]  America on the eve of its first vaccinations against COVID-19.
[00:13.120 --> 00:17.720]  The first vials of the Pfizer vaccine being put into place, workers at the Pfizer plant
[00:17.720 --> 00:21.920]  near Kalamazoo, Michigan, taking them out of the Sub-Zero freezers, placing them in
[00:21.920 --> 00:27.760]  boxes packed with dry ice, UPS and FedEx hauling the first truckloads of the vaccine out from
[00:27.760 --> 00:28.760]  that plant.
[00:28.760 --> 00:34.080]  The first planes carrying the potential life-saving cargo landing in Louisville and Memphis.
[00:34.080 --> 00:42.200]  This is total absolute triple admission by the Australian government of what we've known
[00:42.200 --> 00:47.080]  from the Indian scientists and the German scientists and the African scientists and
[00:47.080 --> 00:54.720]  the US scientists and the Canadian scientists and the discoverer of the HIV virus that when
[00:54.720 --> 01:02.480]  you scan the COVID-19 virus, it has had five viruses cut into it, one of them HIV.
[01:02.480 --> 01:11.440]  And the government just came out and halted their mRNA vaccine because when you take
[01:11.440 --> 01:15.560]  it, you then test positive for HIV.
[01:15.560 --> 01:18.360]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:18.360 --> 01:22.040]  You test positive for HIV.
[01:22.040 --> 01:27.560]  All he really wanted for Christmas was a local vaccine, but the University of Queensland
[01:27.560 --> 01:31.080]  vaccine will not be able to proceed.
[01:31.080 --> 01:37.840]  50 million planned doses scrapped after triggering false positive results for HIV.
[01:37.840 --> 01:43.000]  Australia expects to start vaccination next March and to have its whole population inoculated
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.840]  by the end of the year.
[01:44.840 --> 01:54.320]  But these were false positives, I find a cover story, I think they were giving people HIV
[01:54.320 --> 01:57.120]  in these Franken shots.
[01:57.120 --> 02:04.920]  COVID-19 has HIV DNA genetically engineered right into it.
[02:04.920 --> 02:14.920]  And that was accomplished by the Wuhan BSL4, which is China's fourth D-trick, sending a
[02:14.920 --> 02:24.400]  scientist down to Australia to work with the Australian Health Board on DNA genetically
[02:24.400 --> 02:30.480]  engineering the HIV into SARS.
[02:30.480 --> 02:37.000]  The statement coming out is by the director of the Australian Health Board.
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.280]  Right, that's the exact same people who DNA genetically engineered HIV into SARS that
[02:47.280 --> 02:56.400]  was taken back to the Wuhan BSL4, China's fourth D-trick, and turned into COVID-19.
[02:56.400 --> 03:01.360]  Now there were four cases of Bell's palsy that occurred in the group that received the vaccine.
[03:01.360 --> 03:05.480]  Bell's palsy is a condition that causes temporary weakness or paralysis of certain muscles in
[03:05.480 --> 03:06.480]  the face.
[03:06.480 --> 03:09.200]  It is not clear that there is a connection to the vaccine.
[03:09.200 --> 03:13.120]  In your view, America first, as the president might call it, not the right approach.
[03:13.120 --> 03:22.720]  Well the extreme idea that everybody should die until we have the very last American vaccinated,
[03:22.720 --> 03:25.880]  that's hardly the appropriate response.
[03:25.880 --> 03:31.000]  A new Pew research poll out last week showed that only 60% of the American people say they
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.560]  intend to get vaccinated.
[03:33.560 --> 03:37.160]  That includes less than half of black Americans.
[03:37.160 --> 03:43.400]  How worried are you about the reluctance of Americans to take a vaccine, particularly
[03:43.400 --> 03:45.120]  among minority communities?
[03:45.120 --> 03:52.760]  I think we have a real communications challenge that you've got to find out who do people
[03:52.760 --> 03:58.760]  trust, you know, for some jobs, like working in a nursing home, the government could decide
[03:58.760 --> 04:05.160]  that it's important for those people to be vaccinated because that'll save a lot of lives.
[04:05.160 --> 04:11.680]  And so the track record will be developed, and I think we'll get over the 70%.
[04:11.680 --> 04:16.600]  The dystopians are building a dystopia for us because it's easier to manage, and they
[04:16.600 --> 04:22.320]  like it, and they enjoy it, and are actually trying to tear down the egalitarian open free
[04:22.320 --> 04:23.320]  societies.
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.120]  That's why George Soros calls his group the open society, because he's destroying open
[04:27.120 --> 04:28.120]  societies.
[04:28.120 --> 04:32.000]  Because they have open societies, you've got to have independent separate societies within
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.200]  interfacing with each other through free will, not through cultural, spiritual, financial,
[04:36.200 --> 04:39.200]  genetic rape.
[04:39.200 --> 04:51.600]  All right, folks, we'll be right back on the other side.
[04:51.600 --> 04:58.280]  It's about to allow the theft of this election only has days to act when you still stop it.
[04:58.280 --> 05:04.000]  I've got some really exciting good news, and I've also got some bad news.
[05:04.000 --> 05:10.760]  Info Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[05:10.760 --> 05:15.320]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your
[05:15.320 --> 05:20.040]  word of mouth have overwritten that, and they are so scared of InfoWars.com and Bandod
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.000]  Video, and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.600]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December right now.
[05:28.600 --> 05:32.240]  This is our most important month to be able to fund ourselves in the next year.
[05:32.240 --> 05:33.680]  And I understand the economy is shut down.
[05:33.680 --> 05:35.680]  I understand there's not as much money as they're used to be.
[05:35.680 --> 05:37.160]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery.
[05:37.160 --> 05:39.320]  But Info Wars really needs your support.
[05:39.320 --> 05:44.120]  You just buy great items through your Christmas shopping at InfoWarsStore.com with huge sales,
[05:44.120 --> 05:48.160]  amazing products, and then you know you're funding the Info War and not funding Amazon
[05:48.160 --> 05:52.560]  and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses.
[05:52.560 --> 05:56.000]  Continue to fund the Second American Revolution while getting great products at the same time
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[05:57.000 --> 06:24.000]  Thank you.
[06:24.000 --> 06:49.760]  We have had such a long, long history of being the model of freedom around the world.
[06:49.760 --> 06:55.160]  It didn't mean we were perfect, didn't mean we were angels, didn't mean we didn't have
[06:55.160 --> 07:02.520]  problems, but we were the model of human freedom and the country that trailblazed freedom
[07:02.520 --> 07:09.280]  more than any other nation in the history of the world except maybe England.
[07:09.280 --> 07:12.080]  And that was in its latter part and influenced us heavily.
[07:12.080 --> 07:14.680]  But that's really where it came from, England.
[07:14.680 --> 07:20.400]  And people fighting in England over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years to carve
[07:20.400 --> 07:29.360]  out just some basic freedoms for humanity where humans were seen as sentient and as
[07:29.360 --> 07:35.560]  sovereign, not just the king of England, but every man and woman, a king and queen in their
[07:35.560 --> 07:41.640]  home, a man's home, is his castle to process.
[07:41.640 --> 07:51.200]  All of that is British common law flowing out of Magna Carta to 1776, July 4th.
[07:51.200 --> 07:59.280]  And if you want to be able to put a tombstone in America, and that's how grave this is,
[07:59.280 --> 08:10.480]  United States of America born July 4, 1776, and it will die January 20th, 2021.
[08:10.480 --> 08:12.760]  They do the math on that for me.
[08:12.760 --> 08:15.760]  How many years, how many months, how many days that is.
[08:15.760 --> 08:21.680]  So really, we're looking at a 36 day countdown because I'm not somebody that gives you peaches
[08:21.680 --> 08:29.160]  and cream when it's not peaches and cream.
[08:29.160 --> 08:32.800]  I believe and I know historically you have a right to duty to know the truth.
[08:32.800 --> 08:37.480]  And so I'm going to lay that out today, but I'm also going to give you the good news.
[08:37.480 --> 08:41.160]  Any time we want to stand up, any time we want to recognize the globalist as our enemies,
[08:41.160 --> 08:48.160]  any time we realize that things are only going to get worse, the longer we put up with this,
[08:48.160 --> 08:53.720]  there will be the rediscovery of will and of huevos.
[08:53.720 --> 08:56.840]  And we will start turning the tide back against the tyranny.
[08:56.840 --> 09:01.120]  But right now, the pendulum was swinging towards total oppression.
[09:01.120 --> 09:04.960]  Some nationalists, some patriots got in, blocked it, the furies, the world, and the globalists
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.960]  just threw everything they had at it and their trillions of stolen dollars and their crisis
[09:09.960 --> 09:13.640]  machines and their high tech psychological warfare.
[09:13.640 --> 09:21.160]  And they have just absolutely gas lit large swaths of the planet.
[09:21.160 --> 09:25.120]  The good news is it's caused a giant awakening and people understand what's happening now
[09:25.120 --> 09:26.120]  and are getting really upset.
[09:26.120 --> 09:32.160]  But if we now don't take things back, well, we're just well informed slaves, not ill informed
[09:32.160 --> 09:33.160]  slaves.
[09:33.160 --> 09:38.240]  The system has a methodology of making you so poor, even though you hate the system and
[09:38.240 --> 09:42.760]  even though you know it's a fraud, you are permanently in an underclass now and so busy
[09:42.760 --> 09:48.640]  trying to get food on your table that you don't fight the system anymore because so
[09:48.640 --> 09:51.800]  many other people are living hand to mouth as well.
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.280]  They can be recruited at the grassroots to actually work for the tyranny and oppress
[09:56.280 --> 10:02.640]  you because they want their 30 pieces of silver.
[10:02.640 --> 10:07.920]  You see that bars out, trust the scam.
[10:07.920 --> 10:15.120]  You see all the other big developments, Russia firing for ICBM missiles off their submarine.
[10:15.120 --> 10:21.640]  You see the certification by the Electoral College of Biden.
[10:21.640 --> 10:27.320]  You see Mitch McConnell congratulating Biden as being president-elect.
[10:27.320 --> 10:32.320]  You see Putin who held out the longest congratulating him.
[10:32.320 --> 10:39.080]  Trump has not had this election lost.
[10:39.080 --> 10:40.680]  Trump is not losing the election.
[10:40.680 --> 10:49.080]  He is allowing the stealing of the election and I don't blame the president.
[10:49.080 --> 10:57.920]  I'm simply saying that this isn't the date at which you can market that the long shot
[10:57.920 --> 11:06.600]  of Trump defeating the steal went to basically a whole and one long shot, one in a million.
[11:06.600 --> 11:10.440]  You could mark that as of last night.
[11:10.440 --> 11:17.320]  What are people going to do when Joe Biden is seated fraudulently over the Republic?
[11:17.320 --> 11:18.600]  We have to get ready for that.
[11:18.600 --> 11:19.920]  We have to fight that.
[11:19.920 --> 11:20.920]  We have to resist that.
[11:20.920 --> 11:23.640]  We have to speak out against that.
[11:23.640 --> 11:29.880]  It's not recognizing how much trouble we're in and how the fact we're in a 21st century
[11:29.880 --> 11:36.600]  war that has gotten the public not to mobilize and not to get involved and not to stop what's
[11:36.600 --> 11:44.040]  happening because people continue to believe that magically everything's being handled
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.240]  and everything's great and basically that Trump is invincible and this is all part of
[11:49.240 --> 11:50.840]  some secret plan.
[11:50.840 --> 11:58.720]  When I'm on the phone with his top lawyers and they're desperately fighting and I meet
[11:58.720 --> 12:05.640]  with folks from the White House and they say 90 percent of the people left as of a few
[12:05.640 --> 12:08.640]  weeks ago and now it's down to about 5 percent.
[12:08.640 --> 12:11.800]  Trump has the helicopter pilots will fly him around.
[12:11.800 --> 12:16.880]  The secret service is there but everyone else has deserted him.
[12:16.880 --> 12:21.400]  There's like a quadriplegic that would love to run across the grass barefoot, who would
[12:21.400 --> 12:24.200]  love to climb a tree, who'd love to go for a swim.
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.560]  They can't because they're paralyzed from the neck down.
[12:29.560 --> 12:32.440]  Trump is paralyzed.
[12:32.440 --> 12:33.960]  Trump is surrounded.
[12:33.960 --> 12:35.520]  America is paralyzed.
[12:35.520 --> 12:38.760]  America is surrounded and I tell you that because it's the truth.
[12:38.760 --> 12:41.880]  Now the minute we wake up to the globalists and how horrible they are and they're planning
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.520]  to keep us bankrupted and paralyzed is the beginning of us digging out of this and we will be
[12:46.520 --> 12:47.520]  forced to do it.
[12:47.520 --> 12:51.400]  You will get motivated at one point because the new world order has got things planned
[12:51.400 --> 12:55.800]  for you so bad you'll be forced to take action and I know this audience is core people that
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.480]  have been light years ahead of this and we salute you and we love you but I'm talking
[12:59.480 --> 13:03.600]  to the new listeners and people that tune into the show for entertainment.
[13:03.600 --> 13:04.600]  This is not a game.
[13:04.600 --> 13:05.600]  This is not a joke.
[13:05.600 --> 13:11.240]  We've studied this thing up one side and down the other and this is not a regular Democrat
[13:11.240 --> 13:12.840]  power grab.
[13:12.840 --> 13:18.560]  This is a total multinational takeover to gut nationalism and butcher the United States
[13:18.560 --> 13:24.840]  on the altar of the new world order and world government and to stampede the whole world
[13:24.840 --> 13:29.440]  once we fall and believe me you're watching the fall of this republic.
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.240]  Now I've explained that tombstone.
[13:34.240 --> 13:44.120]  July 4, 1776 born, United States of America, constitutional republic dead, January 20,
[13:44.120 --> 13:52.480]  2021, 36 days out, 79 days of hell end with the installment of this globalist completely
[13:52.480 --> 13:55.360]  compromised operative.
[13:55.360 --> 14:02.200]  The good news is this is a giant massive power grab is naked, is illegal, is tyrannical and
[14:02.200 --> 14:09.200]  if we simply stay motivated and take action and realize that we went, is everything a
[14:09.200 --> 14:13.720]  paradox in the universe, every action is an opposite and equal reaction.
[14:13.720 --> 14:17.480]  We went from no one knowing that the Federal Reserve was private 20 years ago, maybe one
[14:17.480 --> 14:19.760]  out of 100 to almost everyone knowing.
[14:19.760 --> 14:22.680]  We went from people not knowing what world government globalism is to almost everybody
[14:22.680 --> 14:23.680]  knowing.
[14:23.680 --> 14:27.640]  We went from most people taking vaccines to most refusing them over two thirds.
[14:27.640 --> 14:31.600]  We went from most people being pro-abortion to now every big poll they put out, internal
[14:31.600 --> 14:37.240]  polls you name it, 70% of people below the age of 30 or against it, it's something like
[14:37.240 --> 14:42.360]  80%, below the age of 20, the young people turned against it, old folks are turning
[14:42.360 --> 14:43.360]  against it.
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.520]  We're spiritually seeing an awakening and a revival of common sense.
[14:48.520 --> 14:52.520]  That's what all these counter strikes and all these economic shutdowns are about is
[14:52.520 --> 14:54.960]  to bring us to our knees.
[14:54.960 --> 15:01.280]  This is siege and you're in a war and it's a directed 21st century war and that's not
[15:01.280 --> 15:06.720]  hyperbole, that's not rhetoric, you're in a war much more dangerous than previous wars
[15:06.720 --> 15:11.960]  because it's destroying your very psyche and your very genetics and your very cells and
[15:11.960 --> 15:14.560]  it's all coordinated by the same people.
[15:14.560 --> 15:18.920]  They now admit the UN and Bill Gates run your healthcare worldwide, they've now announced
[15:18.920 --> 15:21.800]  under Biden he will run the decision-making.
[15:21.800 --> 15:25.200]  Two weeks ago, three weeks ago the British Prime Minister said Bill Gates will be the
[15:25.200 --> 15:28.200]  shadow minister of the G8 in the next year.
[15:28.200 --> 15:33.320]  He is in command as a medical officer, so you probably want to learn who the other enemies
[15:33.320 --> 15:39.200]  are and who they are and what they're planning, but only admitting the absolute full nightmare
[15:39.200 --> 15:43.840]  hell of this, we have a very good chance of getting out of it and Trump still has a chance
[15:43.840 --> 15:49.840]  to stop Biden the traitor, a very good one, if he can find the people to take action legally
[15:49.840 --> 15:51.200]  and lawfully under the Constitution.
[15:51.200 --> 15:56.080]  We'll talk about the continued path to victory for humanity straight ahead on Alex Jones.
[15:56.080 --> 16:02.480]  You must guard your humanity, you must guard your children's humanity, you must guard the
[16:02.480 --> 16:07.040]  very genetic code of the planet, the globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of
[16:07.040 --> 16:11.520]  this world, but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning
[16:11.520 --> 16:17.520]  the planet, they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human
[16:17.520 --> 16:23.600]  on earth to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with
[16:23.600 --> 16:31.120]  the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines, they are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned
[16:31.120 --> 16:38.840]  fetuses, were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems, go read
[16:38.840 --> 16:45.960]  the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned, this
[16:45.960 --> 16:49.840]  is the equivalent of an alien takeover, whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little
[16:49.840 --> 16:54.040]  green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding
[16:54.040 --> 16:57.120]  us, it's all the same in the end.
[16:57.120 --> 17:02.480]  The U.S. Postal Service tells Info Wars that as long as you get your order in by December
[17:02.480 --> 17:06.160]  18th and we're able to ship it out by that day, you will get it anywhere in the United

[17:59.600 --> 18:17.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:17.200 --> 18:30.240]  The war was lost, the treaty signed, I was not cut across the land, I was not cut, though
[18:30.240 --> 18:39.840]  many tried, I live among you, well disguised, I had to leave my life behind, I dug some
[18:39.840 --> 18:50.680]  graves, you'll never find, the story is told, with facts and lies, I have a name, but never
[18:50.680 --> 19:03.640]  mind, never mind, never mind, the war was lost, the treaty signed, there's truth that lives,
[19:03.640 --> 19:10.880]  and truth that dies, I don't know which, that's Leonard Cohen ladies and gentlemen, but what
[19:10.880 --> 19:15.000]  did Leonard Cohen say in that one particular song, what was it called, Everybody Knows,
[19:15.000 --> 19:34.760]  yeah let's listen to some of that, everybody knows that the days are loaded, everybody
[19:34.760 --> 19:45.440]  knows, the war is over, everybody knows, the good guys lost, everybody knows, the fight
[19:45.440 --> 20:00.680]  was fixed, the poor stay poor, the rich get rich, that's how it goes, everybody knows,
[20:00.680 --> 20:12.680]  that the boat is leaking, everybody knows, the captain lied, everybody got this broken
[20:12.680 --> 20:22.680]  feeling, like their father or their dog just died, everybody talking to their pockets,
[20:22.680 --> 20:38.680]  everybody wants a box of chocolate and a long stem rose, everybody knows, everybody knows
[20:38.680 --> 20:48.680]  that you love me baby, everybody knows that you really do, everybody knows that you've
[20:48.680 --> 20:58.920]  been faithful, give or take, I don't do, everybody knows, we've seen all these surrogates of
[20:58.920 --> 21:05.280]  Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and their minion, their front man, the senile, empty
[21:05.280 --> 21:10.720]  suit Joe Biden, saying that they wanted to kill Trump, that they wanted to destroy America,
[21:10.720 --> 21:13.680]  that they don't want our borders to even exist, they had our military, they had the police
[21:13.680 --> 21:18.920]  saying everything because they want full control over society.
[21:18.920 --> 21:23.160]  In your first 100 days as president, what will you do to create a pathway to citizenship
[21:23.160 --> 21:28.200]  for many undocumented immigrants that is a big issue for the AAPI community?
[21:28.200 --> 21:34.480]  Now one day, on day one, I'm going to send a legislative immigration reform bill to Congress
[21:34.480 --> 21:40.440]  to provide a roadmap to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants who contribute
[21:40.440 --> 21:47.000]  so much to this country, including 1.7 million, 1.7 million AAPI.
[21:47.000 --> 22:14.680]  Look at the latest article on InfoWars.com, Unity and Healing, Joe Biden Postpitchers
[22:14.680 --> 22:20.800]  applauded violence against the press, encouraged violence against the press, actually cheered
[22:20.800 --> 22:27.840]  on a congressman who beat the hell out of a reporter for asking a question about healthcare.
[22:27.840 --> 22:32.240]  They asked me would I like to debate this gentleman, and I said no, I said if we're
[22:32.240 --> 22:38.400]  in high school I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.
[22:38.400 --> 22:53.440]  Because I'm a star, because I'm a billionaire, I can do things other people can't.
[22:53.440 --> 22:58.200]  What a disgusting assertion for anyone to make.
[22:58.200 --> 23:02.760]  The press always asked me don't I wish I were debating him, no I wish we were in high school
[23:02.760 --> 23:06.200]  I could take him behind the gym, that's what I wish.
[23:06.200 --> 23:12.000]  I see where Biden wants to take me to the back of the barn, me, he wants it.
[23:12.000 --> 23:16.800]  I'd love that, I'd love that.
[23:16.800 --> 23:23.320]  Mr. Tough Guy, you know, he's Mr. Tough Guy, you know when he's Mr. Tough Guy when he's
[23:23.320 --> 23:27.760]  standing behind a microphone by himself, that's when he's been, he wants to bring me to the
[23:27.760 --> 23:35.080]  back of the barn, oh, some things in life you could really love doing.
[23:35.080 --> 23:42.320]  Our nation has lost, and by the way, if I said that, they'd say he's violent, how could
[23:42.320 --> 23:43.680]  he have done that?
[23:43.680 --> 23:49.280]  And that's the thing about these people, is that the rules they want you to play by,
[23:49.280 --> 23:54.680]  they don't play by, and they consistently get away with whatever they want, whenever
[23:54.680 --> 23:55.680]  they want.
[23:55.680 --> 24:00.560]  I think the Republican Party has become basically the autocratic party in America, it's almost
[24:00.560 --> 24:04.600]  as if there's team democracy versus team autocracy in this country.
[24:04.600 --> 24:09.280]  It's not Donald Trump that's changed the Republican Party, Donald Trump represents what the Republican
[24:09.280 --> 24:14.600]  Party's changed, so the defeat of Donald Trump isn't going to fundamentally change this because
[24:14.600 --> 24:20.040]  the Republican Party itself over the last 20 years has moved to this position.
[24:20.040 --> 24:26.600]  And when I try to explain to viewers and listeners how much danger all of us are in society by
[24:26.600 --> 24:33.640]  letting Joe Biden get into office through fraud, it's really unlimited how dangerous
[24:33.640 --> 24:34.640]  it is.
[24:34.640 --> 24:37.920]  Mr. Secretary, let's be straightforward about this.
[24:37.920 --> 24:44.520]  Do you believe that China has something on the Bidens that would compromise our relationship
[24:44.520 --> 24:48.480]  and our ability to relate to China?
[24:48.480 --> 24:53.600]  Well, I can only go by the way people have behaved.
[24:53.600 --> 25:03.160]  We have 612 companies on our entity list, meaning they need licenses in order to get
[25:03.160 --> 25:10.880]  militarily sensitive products, and of those some 236 are from China.
[25:10.880 --> 25:15.520]  There was no such massive listing before.
[25:15.520 --> 25:25.120]  If we don't maintain a hard line, China will achieve their 2025 plan of becoming the dominant
[25:25.120 --> 25:31.480]  power in the world in terms of all the key technologies.
[25:31.480 --> 25:39.640]  We dealt with Huawei, we dealt with ZTE, we dealt with their semiconductor industry.
[25:39.640 --> 25:42.520]  We're dealing with all kinds of issues.
[25:42.520 --> 25:49.400]  If there's any letting up at all, they will accelerate their process because they push
[25:49.400 --> 25:57.200]  as hard as they possibly can until they meet with enough determined resistance on our part
[25:57.200 --> 26:00.240]  that they have to stop.
[26:00.240 --> 26:05.960]  The globalists I've coined a term are dystopics.
[26:05.960 --> 26:12.520]  They believe in creating a dystopic future as a system of management and control because
[26:12.520 --> 26:17.000]  it's hard to build a good society and you're going to make mistakes, but if you artificially
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.040]  try to enslave and oppress people with authoritarianism and try to actually build a dystopia on
[26:22.040 --> 26:26.000]  purpose, then you're a dystopic.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.520]  And that's what this group is.
[26:28.520 --> 26:35.400]  And that's why you can never project onto them enough evil because that's who they are.
[26:35.400 --> 26:38.520]  You can never imagine any depth to them.
[26:38.520 --> 26:43.600]  That's what the Bible calls hell, a bottomless pit because there's no bottom to who these
[26:43.600 --> 26:44.600]  individuals are.
[26:44.600 --> 26:45.600]  All right, folks, I'm so angry.
[26:45.600 --> 26:51.160]  I couldn't even do the last segment, but I'm going to try my best next segment to really
[26:51.160 --> 26:52.160]  give you the facts.
[26:52.160 --> 26:54.760]  Nobody else built.
[26:54.760 --> 26:58.920]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[26:58.920 --> 27:03.800]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[27:03.800 --> 27:07.600]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[27:07.600 --> 27:08.800]  a chip under your skin.
[27:08.800 --> 27:14.760]  It's all now completely official part of the UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and
[27:14.760 --> 27:19.520]  Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[27:19.520 --> 27:23.480]  Foundation and all the rest of them, Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, gets here.
[27:23.480 --> 27:27.840]  Agenda only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you
[27:27.840 --> 27:29.840]  reject it all.
[27:29.840 --> 27:35.720]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, good versus evil and stopping
[27:35.720 --> 27:36.980]  abortion.
[27:36.980 --> 27:39.120]  We must start valuing human life again.
[27:39.120 --> 27:46.240]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[27:46.240 --> 27:48.800]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[27:48.800 --> 27:55.800]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[27:55.800 --> 27:56.800]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[27:56.800 --> 27:57.800]  Hey Alex.
[27:57.800 --> 27:58.800]  Oh my God.
[27:58.800 --> 27:59.800]  Long time listener.
[27:59.800 --> 28:00.800]  First time caller.
[28:00.800 --> 28:03.560]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[28:03.560 --> 28:08.240]  I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June and I kept hearing
[28:08.240 --> 28:11.240]  Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[28:11.240 --> 28:12.360]  Let me tell you something, man.
[28:12.360 --> 28:17.560]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or six years
[28:17.560 --> 28:22.080]  and the doctors, they tried every test, nobody could figure out what it is and then every
[28:22.080 --> 28:25.560]  day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[28:25.560 --> 28:28.040]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[28:28.040 --> 28:31.160]  Now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional because they don't want you to have it stuff
[28:31.160 --> 28:35.400]  but I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started
[28:35.400 --> 28:36.400]  taking it.
[28:36.400 --> 28:39.480]  Man, that stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[28:39.480 --> 28:43.080]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled, anybody's traveled
[28:43.080 --> 28:49.000]  over speeds, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.320]  It's true folks, we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living defense
[28:53.320 --> 28:55.600]  is over the top good.
[28:55.600 --> 29:00.760]  Our entire modern system has been built to track and trace us, not because we're doing
[29:00.760 --> 29:06.000]  anything wrong but so we can be socially engineered and controlled and now that's out the open.
[29:06.000 --> 29:10.680]  One way to take back a lot of your power is to put your so-called smartphone in a privacy
[29:10.680 --> 29:15.000]  pocket when you're not using it that way, hackers, Illumina Gates and the Clintons contact
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.360]  tracers and all these big corporations that are setting up this tracking and control grid
[29:19.360 --> 29:22.840]  in the name of fighting COVID, they admit their internal documents truly about a castle
[29:22.840 --> 29:26.960]  society control system, don't have that power over you.
[29:26.960 --> 29:31.080]  They protect their locations, they protect where they're going and what they're doing,
[29:31.080 --> 29:35.400]  I can tell you, I was the first person 20 years ago said cover up the cameras on your
[29:35.400 --> 29:39.080]  computer and now of course Bill Gates and all of them admit they're doing that.
[29:39.080 --> 29:42.760]  Mark Zuckerberg, show get your privacy pockets, they make great stocking stuffers and great
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.000]  gifts, they've been sold out for months, they're little fair day cages, only $19.95 and you're
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.760]  back in stock at InfoWareStore.com, give the gift of privacy and security and safety with
[29:51.760 --> 29:58.120]  privacy pockets at InfoWareStore.com.
[29:58.120 --> 30:11.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:11.640 --> 30:39.520]  We are back, I am your host Alex Jones and we can look at this date that we are fast
[30:39.520 --> 30:47.840]  approaching in 36 days, January 20th, 2021 as the date that America's death certificate
[30:47.840 --> 30:51.440]  will be issued.
[30:51.440 --> 30:57.760]  Now unlike individuals, countries can rise from the ashes, they rarely do but sometimes
[30:57.760 --> 31:06.360]  it happens but that's where we are right now, the globalists want to get rid of the country's
[31:06.360 --> 31:11.520]  very existence, the UN plans to get rid of the borders, they plan to keep the lockdown
[31:11.520 --> 31:17.320]  going forever and the communist Chinese in their official Communist Party meetings, you've
[31:17.320 --> 31:24.000]  seen the videos here weeks ago, Tucker Carlson later played them, saying we are using COVID
[31:24.000 --> 31:29.000]  to keep America locked down with our people in the top circles of the US, we are open,
[31:29.000 --> 31:34.640]  we will take over, we are going to be dominant, America's done, they're so afraid of COVID
[31:34.640 --> 31:40.920]  and they laugh at us, it's out in the open, they're globalists, the people that run the
[31:40.920 --> 31:45.280]  US are globalists, Trump tried to stop it and America didn't realize how much trouble
[31:45.280 --> 31:53.240]  it was in and it's too optimistic and it's now allowing the theft and the steal, most
[31:53.240 --> 31:58.080]  of Trump's administration has left, they've got new jobs, they've given up, he hasn't
[31:58.080 --> 32:02.760]  given up, we haven't given up and we're not going to give up because we understand this
[32:02.760 --> 32:10.360]  is a long term process, we're not in D.C. trying to kiss butt with the lobbyist groups
[32:10.360 --> 32:17.080]  and the rhinos and the democrats and the globalists and chikoms trying to get jobs with them,
[32:17.080 --> 32:22.960]  we are ideologues, we believe in Christianity, we believe in God, we believe in the republic,
[32:22.960 --> 32:33.000]  we believe in capitalism, we believe in our system and we believe in being free.
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.320]  And so the big thing that has to be done here is you've got to dig in and settle into a
[32:37.320 --> 32:44.320]  wartime mode and really have it burn into your head that we're occupied and we were
[32:44.320 --> 32:54.960]  able to get a Hail Mary, David versus Goliath, stone right into Goliath's forehead but Goliath
[32:54.960 --> 33:00.200]  was just one of their soldiers and this modern fight they haven't given up, now we're being
[33:00.200 --> 33:05.440]  hit by the next big wave so I don't want them stealing this election and we're basically
[33:05.440 --> 33:10.960]  there now to demoralize you, I don't want you to believe in the false hope though of
[33:10.960 --> 33:18.800]  100%, Trump's going to win, it's over for the new world order because if they're able
[33:18.800 --> 33:24.240]  to put their puppet in, people are just going to become demoralized if they don't understand
[33:24.240 --> 33:28.760]  the big picture, the globalists had to steal this, Trump won in a landslide, the numbers
[33:28.760 --> 33:33.160]  are all there by double or triple what he won those states by before, he barely won
[33:33.160 --> 33:37.240]  those states by one point, half a point, he won those states by two points, three points,
[33:37.240 --> 33:42.400]  four points, five point, six points when they closed the voting, they really kept it going
[33:42.400 --> 33:47.720]  so we've clocked them and we're going to continue to expose them, they count on us getting
[33:47.720 --> 33:54.640]  mad now but kind of just moving on and forgetting all that was done, no, with Trump there was
[33:54.640 --> 34:03.960]  no Russiagate but with Biden there's total Russia proof, there's total China proof and
[34:03.960 --> 34:10.240]  we can politically convict the globalists, they're already indicted and we could fully
[34:10.240 --> 34:15.400]  pull away from them, they're waging war on us to collapse us because they fear us removing
[34:15.400 --> 34:21.360]  our support from them and us collapsing their global system but as long as we point out
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.960]  this is siege, not an aid package, the lockdowns are meant to bring populations under their
[34:25.960 --> 34:31.400]  total control, they will be known as the villains they are and not the saviors, that's already
[34:31.400 --> 34:39.680]  happening, the recall calls for Governor Newsom, the recall calls for Boris Johnson, I mean
[34:39.680 --> 34:43.600]  I talked to folks that are in the UK that were liberals just a year ago, now they're
[34:43.600 --> 34:50.120]  nationalists and get it, the new world order might win this battle, taking out a Bolsonaro,
[34:50.120 --> 34:57.240]  taking out a Trump but they will lose the war as long as we remember it's we the people
[34:57.240 --> 35:02.160]  that educate others and the boycott big tech and the boycott the big companies and that
[35:02.160 --> 35:07.000]  expose them and that speak out against them and that understand that we're on the winning
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  side because of Providence and our love of God and our connection to that and this is
[35:11.000 --> 35:19.440]  a fight against good versus evil, this is a fight versus God and Satan and so this is
[35:19.440 --> 35:25.440]  the time to get ready and to understand and to push as hard as we can and yes, Trump still
[35:25.440 --> 35:35.840]  has a chance to pull this out but again, he's a quadriplegic, 90 plus percent of his campaign
[35:35.840 --> 35:45.960]  has quit, 90 plus percent of the staff has left and I talked to state department people
[35:45.960 --> 35:49.760]  high up, I talked to the White House, when I give you that news it's not like some magic
[35:49.760 --> 35:54.960]  4chan board or something, it's the real people meeting with the president daily and the president
[35:54.960 --> 35:59.320]  is angry, the president knows it's a fraud, the president isn't going to give up, he plans
[35:59.320 --> 36:04.320]  to be a rebel and keep pointing out the election was a fraud and Trump will have even more
[36:04.320 --> 36:09.160]  power in a way and so will you and so will I as rebels because we've been the rebels
[36:09.160 --> 36:13.160]  the whole time, they've just acted like Trump was the establishment and the democrats of
[36:13.160 --> 36:18.160]  the resistance but they have the chicoms, they have the big banks, they have the European
[36:18.160 --> 36:23.240]  Union, they have the UN, they have Hollywood, they have the universities, they have the
[36:23.240 --> 36:33.440]  blue states and blue cities, they have all of the big systems and they ganged up on us
[36:33.440 --> 36:38.160]  to do this and now they're stealing our election in front of us and as long as we point that
[36:38.160 --> 36:43.920]  out and are in their face about it and continue to make it an issue and don't just let it
[36:43.920 --> 36:48.480]  become something that happened before as long as we don't give in to it and become victims
[36:48.480 --> 36:54.040]  of it but overcomers of it, it's going to make us stronger and make them weaker and
[36:54.040 --> 36:58.040]  when the democrats don't deliver all the free goodies to their minions, when they realize
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.560]  they've been conned and that they're not going to be given positions of power and that they're
[37:01.560 --> 37:05.600]  actually bankrupt, they're going to hate their party even more and there's going to
[37:05.600 --> 37:12.160]  be a bigger rebellion in their own ranks of the democrats and the chicom collaborators
[37:12.160 --> 37:17.480]  and you're going to see Trump fighting and patriots in our government and corporations
[37:17.480 --> 37:21.600]  releasing the chicom evidence and how the bides are chicom evidence and who all the
[37:21.600 --> 37:26.920]  big democrats are and how they're foreign assets and Trump's released all that hoping
[37:26.920 --> 37:31.200]  the democrats will be smart and pull back and give Trump the victory he won but they're
[37:31.200 --> 37:36.120]  not, they don't care, they're not giving up, they're not giving in, they have decided
[37:36.120 --> 37:48.240]  to go full scale attack like a zombie force. So what is the solution to this? It's a lot
[37:48.240 --> 37:56.520]  of things but to know the solution you got to know the problem and what is the problem?
[37:56.520 --> 38:01.480]  The democrats in the deep state and the globalists have never gotten in trouble and so that's
[38:01.480 --> 38:06.680]  why they keep doing bigger and bigger gambles and so the Russia fraud failed and the other
[38:06.680 --> 38:12.200]  impeachment failed and all their lives got turned inside out and made the numbers of
[38:12.200 --> 38:16.960]  minorities double and triple voting for republicans, it's beautiful. Despite all their fraud we
[38:16.960 --> 38:20.320]  gained 15 seats in the house and you know they're going to run the same fraud I guess
[38:20.320 --> 38:25.040]  in Georgia and the republicans are going to lose the senate, they're going to have the
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.920]  trifecta but it's razor thin in the house and if we don't let them walk in and steal
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.360]  the next election it will complete a total realignment and we will win the house and
[38:34.360 --> 38:41.040]  senate by monster numbers but you see that's the other big problem. They know that and
[38:41.040 --> 38:45.040]  they know that despite their massive stealing there was a total landslide against them and
[38:45.040 --> 38:49.800]  so they're going to stage false flags, they're going to try to cause an actual civil war
[38:49.800 --> 38:55.680]  because the globalists want to break the country up completely. You think they just want lockdowns,
[38:55.680 --> 38:59.000]  have a long depression and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar, they want to
[38:59.000 --> 39:02.600]  collapse the whole system and bring in their new world currency, their digital tracking
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.000]  systems that GG Ping has announced that are being adopted and they're beta testing it
[39:07.000 --> 39:12.320]  on their own captured slaves in the blue sectors. So you've got to realize when you go in a
[39:12.320 --> 39:17.440]  blue area it's a blue sector. This is like red dawn folks, when you're in a blue area
[39:17.440 --> 39:23.160]  you are actually in enemy Chycom globalist occupied territory. So this isn't really a
[39:23.160 --> 39:27.120]  civil war, the media is trying to brand it and so is the controlled right as a civil
[39:27.120 --> 39:32.480]  war. It's not that. This is an occupation. You're in an occupied country. We got our
[39:32.480 --> 39:35.720]  guy and they were the hell married to try to stabilize stuff. Trump thought he could
[39:35.720 --> 39:41.400]  lead us out of this and he did. Voted for him in the landslide but the enemy now stole
[39:41.400 --> 39:46.840]  that and is running a Psyop. So now this battle is very fluid and quite frankly we've got
[39:46.840 --> 39:50.720]  the upper hand long term. It's just going to be really rough because these tyrants are
[39:50.720 --> 39:58.520]  going to hurt us bad. If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year just wait
[39:58.520 --> 40:04.080]  until you see the year 2021. I'm Alex Jones. I started in full wars but I couldn't have

[40:54.640 --> 40:58.800]  During our war for independence during some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson, the
[40:58.800 --> 41:02.440]  man credited with writing our Declaration of Independence and much of our Constitution
[41:02.440 --> 41:06.120]  later said, look, this is not going to be an easy fight. We're not going to be transported
[41:06.120 --> 41:12.160]  liberty on a bed of feathers. No, ladies and gentlemen, we've actually had incredible
[41:12.160 --> 41:16.640]  successes with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro and the Liberty Movement worldwide. We're
[41:16.640 --> 41:21.000]  going to have major setbacks, but there is a giant awakening happening. That's what

[41:30.800 --> 41:34.440]  force it now, they're never going to get it. So info wars has never been more critical.

[41:55.240 --> 42:00.880]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations, the big corporations,
[42:00.880 --> 42:04.840]  the globalist, big tech and big farmer are all pushing the Cubs most deadly thing in
[42:04.840 --> 42:10.360]  history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold. But if you are deficient
[42:10.360 --> 42:13.680]  then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing
[42:13.680 --> 42:19.320]  homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical
[42:19.320 --> 42:24.720]  officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically
[42:24.720 --> 42:29.680]  bioweapons and are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that die basically
[42:29.680 --> 42:33.720]  when they take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to resuscitate
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.320]  them all the time or a lot of times they just let them die. And that's on the record, it
[42:37.320 --> 42:42.080]  does that, Guillain-Barre's, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases, but they tell you,
[42:42.080 --> 42:45.200]  save and effective, no one's getting hurt, it's a conspiracy theory, and then all the
[42:45.200 --> 42:50.160]  fine princesses can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous
[42:50.160 --> 42:53.640]  towards something that is incredibly dangerous because the media says it's safe, they do
[42:53.640 --> 43:01.800]  it. Introducing InfoWarsLife Pure Turmeric Extract. This is taken under the tongue. It
[43:01.800 --> 43:08.120]  is pure turmeric. It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[43:08.120 --> 43:14.280]  that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines. This is absorbed
[43:14.280 --> 43:18.400]  under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by
[43:18.400 --> 43:23.360]  the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system. The two formulas are different, but
[43:23.360 --> 43:27.520]  both are concentrated, and our first product got rave reviews. We've now been testing this
[43:27.520 --> 43:31.880]  out for several months. Some of our staff like it more than bodies, some like bodies

[43:58.120 --> 44:20.920]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Live, raw, and unfiltered. It's the Alex Jones
[44:20.920 --> 44:30.640]  show. I don't say this to scare you. I say it because it's the truth, and I say it to
[44:30.640 --> 44:38.360]  get you motivated. You can really create a tombstone, a modern monument, coming up on
[44:38.360 --> 44:50.880]  January 20th, 2021, with demarcation lines of America's birth and its trajectory and
[44:50.880 --> 44:54.520]  its influence and its death. Then you can discuss what is going to happen in the United
[44:54.520 --> 44:59.680]  States as we're absorbed into the authoritarian world government, and for that you can learn
[44:59.680 --> 45:07.040]  from the globalist all their horrible plans. But we've done the math here for folks, and
[45:07.040 --> 45:20.680]  so you can start on Thursday, July 4th, 1776, to Wednesday, January 20th, 2021, and that
[45:20.680 --> 45:37.680]  is the life of the Republic, 89,319 days, 244 years, 6 months, 16 days, or 2,934 months,
[45:37.680 --> 45:44.160]  16 days. You can create a tombstone that has that date because the big corporations, the
[45:44.160 --> 45:48.840]  Chai comms, they want America to end. In all those big official Communist Party videos,
[45:48.840 --> 45:53.440]  they played the last few weeks, this is on national Chinese TV, they're like, America
[45:53.440 --> 45:57.960]  will not exist, we run the COVID, we're open, they're not, they will never reopen, we control
[45:57.960 --> 46:05.960]  their upper councils, America is over, and they laugh, and yeah, and then our most hardcore
[46:05.960 --> 46:15.200]  people go, could it be on Fox? Hardcore mainstream, supposedly. Could it be that, you know, the
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.440]  Bidens are compromised? Gee, I don't know. They're just in all these illegal business
[46:20.440 --> 46:24.360]  deals with known Chinese spies, his son's on tape admitting it, they get hundreds of
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.840]  millions of dollars, they're doing it. He says China should be involved in every aspect
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.760]  of our lives, they own our debt, they own Hollywood, and it's the Communist Chinese that
[46:32.760 --> 46:39.600]  have millions of people in death camps, and the left is lobbying to take our speech here
[46:39.600 --> 46:44.440]  and big text working with them overseas, and then they have articles going, Jones claims
[46:44.440 --> 46:48.200]  his authoritarian world government being set up, I don't know, it's called the UN, it's
[46:48.200 --> 46:53.160]  called the COVID lockdown, already starved millions of death, the UN says 270 something
[46:53.160 --> 46:58.520]  million are set to starve to death next couple years, and it's the UN lockdown doing it, run
[46:58.520 --> 47:05.960]  by China, so this is modern war. And now the food banks are running out of food, and now
[47:05.960 --> 47:09.800]  they're announcing new lockdowns in every blue city, in every blue state, and every globalist
[47:09.800 --> 47:19.920]  controlled town on the planet, because this is a worldwide movement, and then Justin Trudeau
[47:19.920 --> 47:27.000]  and all these other world leaders, McCron, Merkel tell you, this is the great reset,
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.760]  Klaus Schwab, Heather Davos Krupp says, we're shutting you down to teach you to be under
[47:32.760 --> 47:37.440]  our control, and this is world government, and we're establishing it, and you're gonna
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.840]  own nothing when we're done, we're gonna control you, and it's gonna save the earth by cutting
[47:41.840 --> 47:50.000]  over consumption, and then they have snopes saying it doesn't exist, so this is it, he's
[47:50.000 --> 47:58.560]  got his new book out called COVID-19, the great reset, so Tucker Carlson got it right,
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.920]  when he said it's time to go after those that have gotten rich and double their wealth off
[48:02.920 --> 48:08.560]  the lockdown, the ones that run it, Klaus Schwab, Prince Charles, Jeff Bezos, they're
[48:08.560 --> 48:12.360]  the criminals that run our lives, they're the people that think they own us, they're
[48:12.360 --> 48:17.160]  the people that have made themselves exempt from all they've done to us, here's what Tucker
[48:17.160 --> 48:19.440]  Carlson had to say.
[48:19.440 --> 48:26.000]  The truth is you can't keep printing trillions of dollars without getting serious inflation.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.520]  Serious inflation is guaranteed, it's natural law, there's no getting around it, the people
[48:30.520 --> 48:35.640]  making these decisions know that perfectly well, but they want inflation, that's the
[48:35.640 --> 48:39.440]  secret, they want inflation, in fact they need inflation, why?
[48:39.440 --> 48:45.200]  Because they've gotten rich from debt, that's the real economy, leverage is their entire
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.520]  business model, so for the finance class, inflation is the only way out of all that
[48:50.520 --> 48:58.200]  debt, when money is worth less, you owe less, meanwhile hard assets like upscale real estate
[48:58.200 --> 49:01.360]  and Martha's Vineyard will be worth more.
[49:01.360 --> 49:06.680]  So inflation may crush you, but it'll make these people, the ones making the decisions,
[49:06.680 --> 49:11.960]  richer, everyone else will get the shaft, whose everyone else will regular wage earners,
[49:11.960 --> 49:16.760]  people living on fixed income, every middle class retiree in the country, in fact anyone
[49:16.760 --> 49:22.720]  who bothered to live like a responsible person and save money, all of them will be in serious
[49:22.720 --> 49:25.440]  trouble when inflation arrives.
[49:25.440 --> 49:31.160]  It's not speculation, it's coming, and anyone who's paying attention knows it's coming,
[49:31.160 --> 49:33.160]  oh but it's just the beginning.
[49:33.160 --> 49:36.920]  If Democrats retake the Senate in January, they've committed to passing something called
[49:36.920 --> 49:41.920]  the Heroes Act, so who are these heroes they plan to help?
[49:41.920 --> 49:46.840]  Not the thousands of small business owners whose lives they destroyed, no, instead the
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.600]  law will help rich people in the Northeast who were hurt by the Trump administration's
[49:50.600 --> 49:52.320]  last tax bill.
[49:52.320 --> 49:57.920]  The Heroes Act would restore the full state and local tax deduction, reversing the 2017
[49:57.920 --> 50:00.400]  law that capped it at 10 grand.
[50:00.400 --> 50:05.120]  According to Brookings Institution, 96% of the benefits from this would go to the top
[50:05.120 --> 50:11.600]  quintile of earners, 57% would benefit the top 1%, 25% would benefit the top 0.1%.
[50:11.600 --> 50:20.600]  In other words, it would benefit Democratic voters, more for the Democratic base, that's
[50:20.600 --> 50:23.000]  what this is, and it won't stop there.
[50:23.000 --> 50:27.880]  In October, the top Democrat in the U.S. Senate, Chuck Schumer, announced his support for this
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.400]  idea.
[50:29.400 --> 50:35.800]  We believe that President Biden, if he becomes president, could eliminate student loan debt
[50:35.800 --> 50:40.280]  without Congress with a flick of the pen that he has in power, so we're proposing that the
[50:40.280 --> 50:47.040]  first $50,000 of everyone's student debt will be automatically eliminated.
[50:47.040 --> 50:52.640]  So student debt is a huge problem, the lack of benefit from going to a four-year college
[50:52.640 --> 50:54.560]  is an even bigger problem.
[50:54.560 --> 50:56.960]  We pointed that out many times on this show.
[50:56.960 --> 50:58.880]  But consider this idea.
[50:58.880 --> 51:01.360]  Who was helped by what Chuck Schumer just said?
[51:01.360 --> 51:06.120]  Well, it's great news for people who got pointless master's degrees in gender oppression.
[51:06.120 --> 51:10.160]  Their slate will be wiped clean by Chuck Schumer and the magic of the Federal Reserve.
[51:10.160 --> 51:15.760]  They'll be free to move forward on that coveted PhD in transgender equity studies.
[51:15.760 --> 51:18.080]  But what about everyone else?
[51:18.080 --> 51:21.880]  What about small business owners who spent, say, 50 grand trying to keep their employees
[51:21.880 --> 51:24.720]  on payroll over the past nine months?
[51:24.720 --> 51:27.520]  Will Chuck Schumer wipe their debt clean?
[51:27.520 --> 51:31.480]  How about people with car loans, or burdensome mortgages, or anyone who's helping to pay
[51:31.480 --> 51:33.080]  for their daughter's wedding?
[51:33.080 --> 51:34.400]  What about their debt?
[51:34.400 --> 51:37.240]  Sorry, they're out of luck.
[51:37.240 --> 51:42.520]  Unlike the education establishment, people like that are not big, Democratic donors.
[51:42.520 --> 51:46.640]  According to one analysis, writing off student debt in the way that Schumer proposes would
[51:46.640 --> 51:52.400]  disproportionately help the most privileged in America, i.e. Democratic voters.
[51:52.400 --> 51:54.360]  But you already knew that.
[51:54.360 --> 51:55.720]  Here's another idea.
[51:55.720 --> 52:00.000]  Why not make the people who benefited the most from the lockdown, the people who've encouraged
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.120]  them from day one, pay for the effects of those lockdowns?
[52:04.120 --> 52:09.240]  Why wouldn't you assess, I don't know, Amazon, and Apple, and Goldman Sachs, and Google,
[52:09.240 --> 52:13.160]  and Netflix, and Walmart, all the big winners in this pandemic?
[52:13.160 --> 52:18.480]  Why wouldn't you assess them a one-time COVID fee, take it out of their record profits,
[52:18.480 --> 52:21.080]  and make them pay for the next bailout?
[52:21.080 --> 52:22.920]  Why are you paying for it?
[52:22.920 --> 52:27.280]  Jeff Bezos, for example, is now the richest man in the history of the world.
[52:27.280 --> 52:29.280]  Maybe he could share the load in a meaningful way.
[52:29.280 --> 52:31.560]  He's not sharing it with his employees.
[52:31.560 --> 52:36.300]  And while we're at it, why not make Harvard, and Yale, and Stanford, and Princeton use their
[52:36.300 --> 52:40.800]  endowments to pay off some of the student debt they caused?
[52:40.800 --> 52:45.360]  There's no reason ordinary taxpayers should be on the hook for their spending.
[52:45.360 --> 52:48.600]  Ordinary taxpayers have suffered enough.
[52:48.600 --> 52:49.600]  Here's the bottom line.
[52:49.600 --> 52:51.160]  The rich are getting richer.
[52:51.160 --> 52:52.920]  Everyone else is getting poorer.
[52:52.920 --> 52:54.640]  That's not a talking point.
[52:54.640 --> 52:56.760]  It's true and measurable.
[52:56.760 --> 52:58.080]  Why is it a problem?
[52:58.080 --> 53:02.280]  Because if it continues, we're going to wind up with an even more volatile society in which
[53:02.280 --> 53:05.600]  everybody hates each other and is consumed by envy.
[53:05.600 --> 53:10.720]  And along the way, capitalism itself will be discredited, and you don't want that.
[53:10.720 --> 53:11.720]  It's already happening.
[53:11.720 --> 53:14.760]  There are already an awful lot of socialists around these days.
[53:14.760 --> 53:16.640]  Have you noticed that?
[53:16.640 --> 53:17.640]  Why is that?
[53:17.640 --> 53:22.960]  Well, it's because the people in charge of our economy are discrediting our system.
[53:22.960 --> 53:28.640]  They are giving capitalism a bad name, because what they're participating in is not a market
[53:28.640 --> 53:33.120]  economy, a free, open market economy.
[53:33.120 --> 53:38.240]  It's a closed game, run for their own benefit, and their benefit alone.
[53:38.240 --> 53:42.880]  Long term, this is a disaster for all of us, and not even so far in the future.
[53:42.880 --> 53:47.360]  In four years, for example, Sandy Cortez will be eligible to run for president.
[53:47.360 --> 53:51.280]  Now, you may laugh at Sandy Cortez, and you should.
[53:51.280 --> 53:55.920]  She's a vacuous idiot, another rich girl narcissist with an overheated Twitter account.
[53:55.920 --> 53:58.080]  But that doesn't mean she couldn't win.
[53:58.080 --> 54:04.240]  If we keep up with this nonsense, this economic craziness, she could win.
[54:04.240 --> 54:05.760]  That's right.
[54:05.760 --> 54:08.920]  So we have to go after the people that have set this up.
[54:08.920 --> 54:13.280]  And those top 10 billionaires are the ones that run the Democratic Party, the ones that
[54:13.280 --> 54:15.760]  have the full control, and are the ones that have done all this.
[54:15.760 --> 54:20.560]  And they have created a giant global bubble of fiat money they gave themselves to which
[54:20.560 --> 54:25.520]  debt they have to pay off, so they want to inflate things only for themselves, though.
[54:25.520 --> 54:30.400]  All doing a lockdown on your economy to make you go bankrupt so they can consolidate control
[54:30.400 --> 54:34.400]  of you and have political will over you, and then make you do what they say so they forgive
[54:34.400 --> 54:38.240]  your student debt and, quote, give you free transportation, free medicine, yeah, like they
[54:38.240 --> 54:39.560]  have in Venezuela.
[54:39.560 --> 54:40.560]  See how it works?
[54:40.560 --> 54:48.800]  It's called a takeover.
[54:48.800 --> 54:51.760]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot.
[54:51.760 --> 54:54.720]  Well, info wars is white hot right now.
[54:54.720 --> 54:59.200]  Global government, globalist forces trying to take over the United States is mainstream
[54:59.200 --> 55:00.200]  news.
[55:00.200 --> 55:02.800]  And info wars credibility has gone through the roof.
[55:02.800 --> 55:08.240]  That's why now is the time to contact local radio, TV and cable stations if you don't have
[55:08.240 --> 55:13.680]  an affiliate in your area already and to send them to infowars.com forward slash affiliates
[55:13.680 --> 55:17.640]  and say, pick up Alex Jones, pick up Owen Shroyer, pick up David Knight, pick up her
[55:17.640 --> 55:18.640]  other great programs.
[55:18.640 --> 55:19.640]  They're free to air.
[55:19.640 --> 55:24.000]  If you're on TV or you're on cable, you can cover up all the commercials for yourself.
[55:24.000 --> 55:25.000]  No contracts needed.
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.160]  This is your authorization stations.
[55:27.160 --> 55:29.080]  Pick up the info wars feed right now.
[55:29.080 --> 55:34.600]  All the affiliates, the satellites, it's all linked at infowars.com forward slash affiliates.
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.480]  Go to the local stations, call them, email them and send them the link to infowars.com
[55:39.480 --> 55:42.120]  forward slash affiliate and tell them we're free to air.
[55:42.120 --> 55:43.120]  No contracts.
[55:43.120 --> 55:44.120]  Just pick us up.
[55:44.120 --> 55:49.200]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[55:49.200 --> 55:52.080]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[55:52.080 --> 55:57.640]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial
[55:57.640 --> 55:59.140]  reason.
[55:59.140 --> 56:03.120]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[56:03.120 --> 56:06.160]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[56:06.160 --> 56:11.480]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[56:11.480 --> 56:13.880]  COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine.
[56:13.880 --> 56:18.960]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within
[56:18.960 --> 56:19.960]  three months.
[56:19.960 --> 56:20.960]  Okay?
[56:20.960 --> 56:22.400]  It's a quarter million.
[56:22.400 --> 56:28.040]  If you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[56:28.040 --> 56:29.040]  These are real numbers.
[56:29.040 --> 56:30.040]  These are real facts.
[56:30.040 --> 56:34.040]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are
[56:34.040 --> 56:35.040]  taught we're not essential.
[56:35.040 --> 56:38.240]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[56:38.240 --> 56:40.040]  You could stand up against it.
[56:40.040 --> 56:41.040]  This is slavery.
[56:41.040 --> 56:47.520]  It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[56:47.520 --> 56:54.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[56:54.520 --> 57:01.920]  Okay, I'm kind of want to talk Carlson Jack right now, though I love to hear myself talk.
[57:01.920 --> 57:07.600]  I mean, I do love to actually cover globalism and expose it, actually hate watching a show.
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.000]  And I want to give the number out, start the next segment, take a bunch of calls this hour.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  I have a whistleblower nurse.
[57:13.000 --> 57:14.480]  I've been trying to get on for six months.
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.920]  The one that showed them on the video is killing people, homeless people in New York at the
[57:18.920 --> 57:19.920]  hospital.
[57:19.920 --> 57:20.920]  They were having most of the deaths.
[57:20.920 --> 57:22.920]  They just, oh, come on here, sir.
[57:22.920 --> 57:27.800]  They get something thousand dollars for putting a air tube down their lungs.
[57:27.800 --> 57:32.080]  She's coming on the show because lockdown two is here and so much more will cover it
[57:32.080 --> 57:33.680]  all in the third hour.
[57:33.680 --> 57:36.560]  But first time callers, let me give you this number now.
[57:36.560 --> 57:37.560]  877-789-2539.
[57:37.560 --> 57:38.560]  877-789-2539.
[57:38.560 --> 57:39.560]  877-789-2539.
[57:39.560 --> 57:45.880]  877-789-2539. 877-789-ALEX.
[57:45.880 --> 57:47.280]  And we will take your calls.
[57:47.280 --> 57:52.600]  So when I get people that never have a chance to call in, we've never gotten through to
[57:52.600 --> 57:53.600]  get all of us today.
[57:53.600 --> 57:55.600]  Now, the full report is at infowars.com.
[57:55.600 --> 57:57.640]  It was very powerful.
[57:57.640 --> 57:59.600]  Biden refuses to acknowledge Hunter Probe.
[57:59.600 --> 58:02.880]  It's a 10 minute, 30 second report, but here's a few minutes of it.
[58:02.880 --> 58:03.880]  It's really powerful.
[58:03.880 --> 58:11.240]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight.
[58:11.240 --> 58:15.200]  So if you've been watching the news, you've got to give some credit to whichever MSNBC
[58:15.200 --> 58:19.200]  contributor wrote the word so that Joe Biden speech earlier.
[58:19.200 --> 58:24.800]  If you didn't know better, if you had no context, you might think everything is better now.
[58:24.800 --> 58:27.000]  The great orange emergency is finally over.
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.080]  It's 1996 again and we can exhale.
[58:30.080 --> 58:35.120]  Our democratic norms are on their way back out of Russian cold storage.
[58:35.120 --> 58:37.520]  Last month's election was a win for all of us.
[58:37.520 --> 58:44.400]  Quote, in this battle for the soul of America, Joe Biden just told us, democracy prevailed.
[58:44.400 --> 58:45.840]  So it wasn't a partisan exercise.
[58:45.840 --> 58:47.720]  It certainly wasn't theft.
[58:47.720 --> 58:50.320]  It was a victory for you personally.
[58:50.320 --> 58:54.320]  In America, Biden's speech writer wrote, politicians don't take power.
[58:54.320 --> 58:56.920]  The people grant it to them.
[58:56.920 --> 58:59.160]  So thanks for the civics lesson, Joe Biden.
[58:59.160 --> 59:03.480]  Joe Biden wants, you know, he didn't run for president three times because he craves power
[59:03.480 --> 59:08.000]  or because he seeks to enrich his near to well relatives or because he has a vast empty
[59:08.000 --> 59:11.320]  space inside that only the adulation of strangers can fill.
[59:11.320 --> 59:13.120]  No, not at all.
[59:13.120 --> 59:17.000]  He ran for president because he deeply cares about you.
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  Joe Biden is a paternal figure, really.
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.120]  You might even call him the father of this nation.
[59:21.120 --> 59:26.520]  Of course, that would make Kamala Harris America's permanent stepmother, which doesn't quite have
[59:26.520 --> 59:27.880]  the same reassuring ring to it.
[59:27.880 --> 59:30.480]  But whatever, details are not important right now.
[59:30.480 --> 59:34.720]  What matters, Joe Biden wants you to know, is that this is a democracy.
[59:34.720 --> 59:37.520]  Always has been, always will be.
[59:37.520 --> 59:41.960]  And by electing Biden and the small secretive group of billionaires who choreograph is every
[59:41.960 --> 59:47.800]  move, this country has become even more democratic, small C democratic, of course.
[59:47.800 --> 59:52.920]  And that's reassuring to hear honestly, because some of us were starting to get other impressions,
[59:52.920 --> 59:55.120]  non-democratic ones.
[59:55.120 --> 59:58.800]  Once the other day, for example, Bill Gates announced that the lockdowns we're enduring
[59:58.800 --> 1:00:01.600]  are going to have to continue for a long, long time.
[1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:05.040]  Now, keep in mind, Bill Gates is not an epidemiologist.
[1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:07.360]  He's not a research scientist either.
[1:00:07.360 --> 1:00:11.800]  Bill Gates is a retired 65-year-old from Seattle who used to make mediocre software
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:14.200]  for office computers.
[1:00:14.200 --> 1:00:15.840]  But now he's a billionaire.
[1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:19.520]  Therefore, Bill Gates gets to decide our national health policy.
[1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:23.240]  Pretty much the same way retired hedge fund operator Tom Steyer gets to tell you what
[1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:25.040]  to think about the weather.
[1:00:25.040 --> 1:00:29.360]  Or how 78-year-old Mike Bloomberg decides which guns you can buy.
[1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:32.040]  Or how George Soros can choose your prosecutors.
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:34.760]  Or how Tim Cook of Apple runs our trade policy.
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:38.960]  Or how Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook can keep America's borders open just because he feels
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:43.360]  like it, but nobody says anything because his friend fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos owns
[1:00:43.360 --> 1:00:48.000]  Washington, D.C.'s hometown newspaper and may soon buy CNN.
[1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.720]  That is the democracy Joe Biden is talking about.
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:56.120]  The kind of democracy in which 11 left-wing billionaires who fund his campaigns run everything.
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.880]  That's the Chinese model of democracy that Joe Biden and his friends so admire.
[1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:04.360]  To get used to it, America, it's a new kind of democracy.
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.560]  In China, people in power don't have to answer questions, so neither does Joe Biden.
[1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:13.600]  Just last year, a voter brought up the Biden family's corruption during a town hall event,
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:18.720]  and Joe Biden responded by calling the man fat and challenging him to a push-up contest,
[1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:20.480]  just like the Chinese do.
[1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:23.800]  Just this Friday, an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal pointed out that Joe Biden's wife
[1:01:23.800 --> 1:01:24.800]  is a doctor too.
[1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:25.800]  Let's stop right there.
[1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:28.960]  By the way, Carlson is selling you a true stuff.
[1:01:28.960 --> 1:01:31.480]  That's what the Chinese will do, is just insult you if you say something to them and then
[1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:32.480]  do push-ups.
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:36.480]  I mean, it's like literally, he's a China file.
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:42.760]  We are adopting this communist ideology that has millions of people in death camps, and
[1:01:42.760 --> 1:01:45.600]  the so-called liberals just love it because they all believe they're about to get free
[1:01:45.600 --> 1:01:46.600]  tuition.
[1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:53.240]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:58.280]  Most of the world's submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the communist
[1:01:58.280 --> 1:02:04.240]  Chinese and the United Nations, and now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient,
[1:02:04.240 --> 1:02:09.080]  the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns so you can't even leave your house for months
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:14.280]  and months are being announced, and in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with
[1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:19.720]  water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator,
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:21.520]  has put them under her control.
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:25.680]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years, and the same thing is
[1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:27.680]  coming here to the United States.
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:29.160]  This is world government.
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:33.920]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:35.960]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:40.240]  This is what the communist takeover looks like, to bankrupt you, to take read of all your
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:45.960]  due process, and absolutely transform the world into a prison planet.
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:51.360]  How long have we warned you about this, but you can fight back, America is the last bastion.
[1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:52.360]  Stop submitting.
[1:02:52.360 --> 1:03:12.960]  You want to stop tyranny better or they're going to kill your ass.
[1:03:12.960 --> 1:03:14.360]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:16.360]  Well, so does he.
[1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:22.600]  From the info.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:03:22.600 --> 1:03:30.040]  World government, the UN force inoculations, travel passes, and the states are now saying
[1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:35.360]  around the world that we're going to make all your children take steroids.
[1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:38.920]  Oh, and guess what?
[1:03:38.920 --> 1:03:42.800]  Don't worry of your COVID vaccine gives you a false positive for HIV.
[1:03:42.800 --> 1:03:51.560]  So false positive, even though COVID-19 is part HIV virus, which more than a dozen top
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:04:00.920]  scientific university said in early 2020, before they got the word that your funding
[1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:05.080]  will be cut unless you reverse it.
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:12.280]  But none of them would reverse their studies, not the Indian top Institute, not the Australian
[1:04:12.280 --> 1:04:16.520]  Institute, not the discoverer of HIV in France.
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:18.520]  None of them would reverse it.
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:22.040]  They just simply withdrew their papers.
[1:04:22.040 --> 1:04:26.480]  Just like John Hopkins two weeks ago, put out a report.
[1:04:26.480 --> 1:04:30.280]  That's John Hopkins that partnered with Bill Gates, the UN to create the COVID policies
[1:04:30.280 --> 1:04:31.280]  for the planet.
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:33.200]  They said it's funny.
[1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:41.000]  There's no more deaths in 2020 so far year to date than there was last year or the year
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:46.960]  before, because we all know 2013-2008, few of those were a lot worse flu years.
[1:04:46.960 --> 1:04:51.320]  So we've had worse years than this recently, you know, our population's up.
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:56.600]  And by the way, it's the same for all these other countries, including Italy has lost
[1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:01.760]  less people this year than they lost a couple of years ago.
[1:05:01.760 --> 1:05:06.760]  But did John Hopkins say, oh, our study was wrong?
[1:05:06.760 --> 1:05:12.760]  No, John Hopkins didn't retract it.
[1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:17.840]  They just memory hold it, but we have a copy of it right here.
[1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:21.400]  And I've got the nurse coming on next hour with a whistle in New York, where she was
[1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:25.160]  seeing healthy people basically killed at the hospital for COVID money.
[1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:31.080]  We'll break it all down next hour, but remember that you can go pull up the John Hopkins study
[1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:34.880]  that there are as many deaths this year so far as there was last year.
[1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:36.960]  Well, where's the panic then?
[1:05:36.960 --> 1:05:42.000]  See the CNN headlines, doctors say COVID worse than they could ever imagine.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:46.560]  MSNBC, it's more devastating than the Spanish flu.
[1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:51.120]  Really it killed 50 to 100 million people, no one knows.
[1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:55.720]  This hasn't killed a half million people here, and most of those died of something else.
[1:05:55.720 --> 1:06:01.320]  But now they're announcing lockdown twos and how you're non-essential, but now I've learned
[1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:11.400]  about Mossy Rock, a town in Washington state where they know it's all a bunch of overhyped
[1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:13.120]  BS and they're hoping for business.
[1:06:13.120 --> 1:06:14.120]  We'll tell you about that.
[1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:18.520]  And if I don't go, I'm going to send reporters there because that's the model of the future.
[1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:25.040]  Of course, really, we've got a family ranch out in East Texas, and I went to a big old
[1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:30.240]  gas station, went to a grocery store, and nobody was wearing a mask, not the clerks.
[1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:32.760]  And then I was really excited a few weeks ago when I was visiting my family in East
[1:06:32.760 --> 1:06:38.120]  Texas, and as I drove back towards Austin, even the small towns were all under the cult.
[1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:41.280]  It was like as I got closer to Mordor, you know what I mean?
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:46.560]  It was just like, it's so insane.
[1:06:46.560 --> 1:06:47.560]  Here's this analogy.
[1:06:47.560 --> 1:06:52.440]  It's like saying, we've had more shark attacks on the west coast of the U.S. than we've ever
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:53.440]  had.
[1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:54.440]  We're closing all the beaches.
[1:06:54.440 --> 1:07:00.680]  And you're like, we had more shark attacks 10 years ago, twice as many in one year.
[1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:02.760]  Shut up, shut up.
[1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:03.760]  That's information.
[1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:04.760]  You're not allowed to question it.
[1:07:04.760 --> 1:07:08.160]  The only the UN WHO is allowed.
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:12.800]  We're like, okay, that's John Hopkins and Bill Gates, the Bill Mill and the Gates Foundation
[1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:13.800]  cooked all that up.
[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:16.200]  I'm already digressing, aren't I?
[1:07:16.200 --> 1:07:17.920]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:07:17.920 --> 1:07:19.200]  Very thankful you joined us.
[1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:21.240]  Let me just throw out the big news again.
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:25.920]  It is my job to tell you the truth and not play games.
[1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:31.680]  Trump is losing the election, not because he lost, but because he doesn't have anyone
[1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:36.760]  to support him in DC and the courts are cowards and the legislatures are cowards and they brought
[1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:41.240]  out total proof, but the corporate media is gaslighting the public covering it up.
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:46.920]  And so Trump is preparing to say, I didn't lose the election and then basically fight
[1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:52.040]  the globalists with rallies all over the country and to raise money the next four years and
[1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:55.800]  then try to get Pence in or himself in, which is great.
[1:07:55.800 --> 1:08:04.680]  But he needs to go after them and he needs to expose them and he needs to declassify
[1:08:04.680 --> 1:08:08.280]  everything, release Julian Assange, pardon Snowden.
[1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:13.240]  He needs to really go after them in the new world order right now while he still has the
[1:08:13.240 --> 1:08:18.800]  bully pulpit of the presidency and from the resolute desk because the courts are fraudulent.
[1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:20.480]  They're ignoring the evidence.
[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:24.280]  And now you see Mitch McConnell saying, okay, Joe Biden's president elect, Trump's lost
[1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:28.640]  and Putin came out last night right after Mitch McConnell said it within 10 minutes.
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:32.840]  Putin issued that directive because he knows, okay, the Republicans aren't going to stand
[1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:34.520]  with him and they're saying he's lost.
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:41.480]  So in the words of John Paul Jones, I've only begun to fight.
[1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:42.480]  That's where we are.
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:46.560]  We need to talk about the future, how we're not going to recognize Biden, how we need
[1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:50.960]  to expose him as a tricom agent, how he needs to be impeached, removed, indicted, whatever
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:52.040]  needs to be done.
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:56.800]  But now's the time to get on that attack now.
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:00.440]  So I said, let me give you the number to talk about this and I didn't really say the topic
[1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:02.600]  I wanted, but we'll talk about anything you want.
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:07.520]  But I really want to ask listeners, what do you think Trump needs to do with 36 days left
[1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:08.520]  in the White House?
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:13.360]  Because I can tell you, the system just hopes that we think, oh, trust the plan.
[1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:15.880]  You mean like Bill Barr is going to say this?
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:19.080]  No, you better trust yourself.
[1:09:19.080 --> 1:09:24.720]  I mean, I've sat there with the former, you know, non-commissioned officers, you know,
[1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:30.600]  heads of most elite units there are that work for the president, work for Trump, current.
[1:09:30.600 --> 1:09:33.800]  And they just say, we know you're fighting hard, the president's fighting hard, we're
[1:09:33.800 --> 1:09:34.800]  not going to give up.
[1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:38.960]  They're calling on the people, but see, the whole cute thing is, oh, there's all these
[1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:44.360]  master spies and they've got all the answers and everything's fine and Trump doesn't need
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:45.360]  any help.
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:46.360]  Everything's handled.
[1:09:46.360 --> 1:09:47.360]  Trust the plan.
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:48.360]  As we one go, we all go.
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:52.680]  And when I'm really meeting with the real people, they're asking me what they think
[1:09:52.680 --> 1:10:00.080]  they should do.
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:04.760]  They're ready to fight, but they're looking for leadership.
[1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:10.840]  So we need to mold the future battle space of political options and of direct action
[1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:17.160]  that's nonviolent and of real hardcore civil disobedience.
[1:10:17.160 --> 1:10:18.960]  Because violence isn't the answer.
[1:10:18.960 --> 1:10:20.400]  They can also use that against us.
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:22.560]  They can stage events and say we did it.
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:24.360]  We're entering the house of the false flag.
[1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:26.280]  We're entering the sector of the false flag.
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:28.700]  We're entering the time of the false flag.
[1:10:28.700 --> 1:10:37.480]  So I'm certainly against violence because it's not effective in a ballgame like this.
[1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:41.640]  That's why they're saying I want to kill Biden and I want violence because I'm saying the
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:42.640]  opposite.
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:47.240]  We need to remove him by indicting him now or by impeachment.
[1:10:47.240 --> 1:10:49.280]  But one way or another, we've got to stop him.
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:50.280]  He's a Chai Khan agent.
[1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:55.880]  And you see stuff coming out, damning information that if Trump did 1% of this, I would support
[1:10:55.880 --> 1:10:56.880]  his removal.
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:02.640]  Because Biden, they just have set the precedent for total treason.
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:07.120]  So Anthony and old dude and Robert and Andrew and Craig and Jesse and Anthony and Robert
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:10.480]  and Jason and Robert, a lot of Jason's and Robert's, we're going to get to all of you.
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:15.400]  But bam, bam, bam, we're going to move quick because I got to cover this all.
[1:11:15.400 --> 1:11:19.120]  Because we better talk about how serious this historic moment we're all in is now.
[1:11:19.120 --> 1:11:20.120]  I didn't plug last hour.
[1:11:20.120 --> 1:11:21.640]  If I don't plug, we're not going to be here.
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:23.640]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:27.680]  If you get your orders in by the 18th, even if you're in Hawaii or Alaska, you'll get
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:29.400]  stuff delivered before Christmas.
[1:11:29.400 --> 1:11:34.920]  And up to like two days before Christmas, you'll get it anywhere in the lower 48.
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.840]  But please do your shopping with us.
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:40.280]  We've got three, four times, five times the audience we had last year this time.
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:42.120]  We've got less money coming in this December.
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:43.120]  We had last December.
[1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:47.360]  We got all these new listeners, all the new expenses, all the bandwidth, all the travel,
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:48.360]  all the crew.
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:50.960]  I'm just spending money like it's going out of style here.
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:51.960]  And I need your support.
[1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:52.960]  I appreciate your support.
[1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:55.000]  But these are great products you already need.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.200]  This has been sold out for months.
[1:11:57.200 --> 1:11:58.200]  It's living defense.
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:00.440]  We put this out three years ago.
[1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:02.440]  It was not popular until people tried it.
[1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:07.720]  Then it got 100% reviews and people got it and went totally insane with it.
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:10.240]  It's now been back in stock for months of being sold out.
[1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:13.360]  And it just flushes out all those little unwanted visitors.
[1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:15.240]  It's the next level probiotics, really what it is.
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.400]  It's a plant-based type system.
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:19.080]  You got to read the reviews for it.
[1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:24.960]  And what is in living defense at infowarstore.com that's now back in stock?
[1:12:24.960 --> 1:12:27.000]  Organic black walnut hole.
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  Organic olive leaf.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  Organic neem leaf.
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:30.480]  Organic ginger root.
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:33.200]  Organic classia root.
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:34.360]  Mark.
[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:35.880]  Grapefruit seed extract.
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:38.080]  Organic black walnut leaf and stem.
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:39.080]  Grape seed.
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:42.800]  And it goes on and on and on and on.
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:49.040]  So be sure and check that out at infowarsstore.com and get it while it's in stock and give it
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:50.040]  as a gift.
[1:12:50.040 --> 1:12:51.800]  Living defense back in stock.
[1:12:51.800 --> 1:12:55.800]  Three months ago we sold out of our privacy pouches.
[1:12:55.800 --> 1:13:00.480]  Reason we sold out is they are super high quality and it's all over the news that the
[1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:05.120]  UN and the Clintons and Microsoft and others and contact tracers are tracking everywhere
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:06.400]  you go and everything you do.
[1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:11.400]  They admit it's a cover for bringing in their cashless society, AI system of total control.
[1:13:11.400 --> 1:13:15.480]  So to block the UN, to block the globalist, to get in the habit of realizing what a surveillance
[1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:20.680]  system phones are, everybody needs a privacy pocket and they fit almost all sizes of droids
[1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:22.560]  and iPhones from small to big.
[1:13:22.560 --> 1:13:26.920]  They also make a great gift to educate friends and family about what's going on.
[1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:30.040]  Now again, there's lots of privacy pocket type systems out there.
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:31.600]  Most of them are about a 90% effective.
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:36.080]  We found a model that's actually pretty inexpensive and has around 99% effectiveness.
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:40.160]  If you're right under a cell tower, it'll still blast through the Faraday cage.
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:43.240]  They're at infowarsstore.com at $19.95.
[1:13:43.240 --> 1:13:47.280]  This exact same system is sold everywhere else for $29 that's still a great deal.
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:48.280]  We sell a lot of these.
[1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:49.280]  We have the best price.
[1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:51.000]  It is a great Christmas gift at infowarsstore.com.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:57.800]  The U.S. Postal Service tells InfoWars that as long as you get your order in by December
[1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:01.360]  18th and we're able to ship it out by that day, you will get it anywhere in the United
[1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:02.860]  States before Christmas.
[1:14:02.860 --> 1:14:04.280]  But listen, don't wait.

[1:14:13.880 --> 1:14:15.720]  you have invested in InfoWars.

[1:14:19.520 --> 1:14:24.800]  the benefits of the information warfare of the truth in the fight against the globalist.
[1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:29.160]  But now is the time to redouble all our efforts in praying for a great awakening, which is
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:35.360]  starting to happen, and spreading the word about infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.

[1:14:39.560 --> 1:14:43.520]  We have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year, certainly on some
[1:14:43.520 --> 1:14:48.160]  items, the biggest sales of the year, on Nutraceuticals, you name it, at infowarsstore.com.
[1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:55.200]  So thanks for your support, get those orders in, and God bless.
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:24.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:26.040 --> 1:15:32.840]  All these people, but it's really going to have to be us saving ourselves by not complying
[1:15:32.840 --> 1:15:40.320]  with the globalists like this town, Mossy Rock, which is a pretty big town outside Seattle.
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:43.360]  They're not following all the fake garbage, and you know there's these towns all over
[1:15:43.360 --> 1:15:44.360]  the country.
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:46.960]  But towns need to announce it and call the bluff.
[1:15:46.960 --> 1:15:49.120]  We all need to say no to lockdown too.
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:51.400]  We need to see Newsome remove.
[1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:52.800]  We need to see Bill Gates arrested.
[1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:57.240]  We need to expose their program and not just sit here and take it.
[1:15:57.240 --> 1:15:59.880]  We need to recognize we're in a war.
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:03.200]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:08.120]  Anthony says he's a veteran on what's happening currently and wants to give his take.
[1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:09.120]  Go ahead, Anthony.
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:10.120]  You're on the air from Oregon.
[1:16:10.120 --> 1:16:11.120]  Hey, Alex.
[1:16:11.120 --> 1:16:12.120]  Long time listener.
[1:16:12.120 --> 1:16:13.120]  First time caller.
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:14.120]  Can you hear me?
[1:16:14.120 --> 1:16:15.120]  I can.
[1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:16.120]  Go ahead.
[1:16:16.120 --> 1:16:18.240]  So here's the thing.
[1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:19.720]  You want to save America?
[1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:22.760]  One of two things need to happen.
[1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:28.400]  President Trump needs to enact the Interaction Acts, call up the militias, call up the military,
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:33.440]  protect the White House with the Marine Reserves, start arresting, doing military tribunals,
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:34.840]  or there's blood in the streets.
[1:16:34.840 --> 1:16:39.840]  That's the only way to keep America free, and it's the only way to keep our country.
[1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:43.320]  Other than that, we've already sold out and we're already down the road to China.
[1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:45.320]  Well, I'll say this.
[1:16:45.320 --> 1:16:49.360]  There was probably a million people in D.C. three weeks ago, and there were probably
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:55.400]  200,000 spread out everywhere when I was there last weekend, because so many people believe
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:17:00.440]  Sidney Powell that everything's fine and General Flynn, 100% Trump's winning.
[1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:05.960]  And I like General Flynn and I like Powell, but I know Trump lawyers, well-known names
[1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:12.120]  that talk to the president, and they say that the president's not optimistic.
[1:17:12.120 --> 1:17:15.440]  He's looking to reorganize and fight the global from the outside.
[1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:17.280]  He has a lot of courage.
[1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:24.360]  But again, it's people's overconfidence that's causing them not to go to D.C.
[1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:30.200]  We should have seen 5 million people in D.C. this weekend, not less.
[1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:34.200]  And again, as it becomes evident that Trump's going to have this stolen from him, we need
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:35.400]  to see 10 million.
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:40.520]  You don't see less as we begin to lose, you see more, because if Biden gets in and we
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:45.080]  don't call him out of his illegitimate, the globalists win.
[1:17:45.080 --> 1:17:48.280]  And they are going to clamp down, they are going to bankrupt us, they're going to make
[1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:49.280]  us so poor.
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:53.560]  I remember covering Bilderberg like five, six years ago, and they put a statement out,
[1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:58.760]  one of their members and said, we have to clamp down on the economy so there's not enough
[1:17:58.760 --> 1:18:02.200]  people with money able to come protest us on a mountaintop.
[1:18:02.200 --> 1:18:05.080]  They want to make you poor to control you.
[1:18:05.080 --> 1:18:08.040]  This is war, Anthony, and I totally agree with you.
[1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:12.000]  I'll be in D.C. on the 19th and the 20th.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:15.520]  And you know, I'm going to look at the size of that crowd and decide what I'm going to
[1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:16.520]  do.
[1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:17.520]  Go ahead.
[1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:21.360]  Well, I love you, Alex, I've been listening to you since 2012.
[1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:24.680]  I used to think you're a toke, and then all this stuff started happening that you were
[1:18:24.680 --> 1:18:25.680]  correct about.
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:30.920]  And I was like, holy crap, but at what point do we have to have to be five minutes in
[1:18:30.920 --> 1:18:35.360]  to get our crap pushed in before we get violent and start physically fighting back?
[1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:37.120]  I mean, what does it take?
[1:18:37.120 --> 1:18:38.120]  We are already there.
[1:18:38.120 --> 1:18:39.400]  I mean, I have a child.
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:43.920]  You have what, four, five, six children, whatever you have the Brady Bunch over there.
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:48.080]  You've got it comes to a point where it's a ballot box and the jury box fell.
[1:18:48.080 --> 1:18:53.280]  The only thing left is a cartridge box and no, I hear you, but we have to we have to
[1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:57.040]  get the word out so America understands is a chai con takeover.
[1:18:57.040 --> 1:19:00.680]  We have a right to go after it and then we need leadership that's that's that's going
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:01.680]  to move.
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:03.760]  And that's what I'm saying to the bureaucracy.
[1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:07.800]  You better get rid of Biden and the globalist politically before this goes to the next level
[1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:09.920]  and now have the chai con start a civil war on this country.
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:10.920]  I appreciate your call.
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:16.720]  And I told this story yesterday and I would saw a comment on info wars about it.
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:18.880]  Oh, listen to Jones saying this and that.
[1:19:18.880 --> 1:19:22.480]  I don't tell you stories that didn't happen.
[1:19:22.480 --> 1:19:26.640]  And so people say, well, why don't you show us video of this?
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:30.160]  Well then the people don't come talk to you anymore.
[1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:35.880]  And so I want to talk to the feds and I want to hear what they have to say.
[1:19:35.880 --> 1:19:39.160]  You know, I have people with me that the feds know who they are.
[1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:42.840]  And I appreciate those folks coming and working with us so they understand, you know, the
[1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:43.840]  level of this fight.
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:49.080]  But, you know, we had guys that worked for us that have done major operations for the
[1:19:49.080 --> 1:19:51.880]  president of the United States that have worked directly under Trump.
[1:19:51.880 --> 1:19:55.000]  And it's not just regular security guys we got.
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:20:00.360]  And so they sent a secret service over and they turned our phones off while they were
[1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:01.360]  there.
[1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:02.360]  The phones didn't work.
[1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:03.360]  They turned them off and they got there.
[1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:04.360]  They didn't say anything.
[1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:05.360]  How's your phone doing?
[1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:08.160]  They're like, we're here to talk to you about this, blah, blah, blah.
[1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:10.560]  Then some more feds came and just said, hey, we're ordered to follow you.
[1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:11.560]  Just so you know.
[1:20:11.560 --> 1:20:12.560]  Yeah.
[1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:13.560]  Just so we know we're watched, right?
[1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:14.720]  In case we call for violence or whatever.
[1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:16.960]  It's the globalist on the left you've got to worry about.
[1:20:16.960 --> 1:20:18.800]  We're not planning something like that.
[1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:20.840]  And they know that.
[1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:25.040]  But that's what's happening is everybody's already taken orders from Biden.
[1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:26.040]  Okay.
[1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:30.600]  So a couple of weeks ago in Georgia, everywhere I went, they came and sat next to us in empty
[1:20:30.600 --> 1:20:32.600]  restaurants and basically told us they were feds.
[1:20:32.600 --> 1:20:38.640]  Now they come with their business cards and when they show up, your cell phone doesn't
[1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:39.640]  work.
[1:20:39.640 --> 1:20:42.200]  I mean, it doesn't work period.
[1:20:42.200 --> 1:20:46.120]  So that's what I'm telling you is that's, this is not a game, folks.
[1:20:46.120 --> 1:20:51.120]  They've got the safety off the gun to my head and I don't even see a violent avenue out
[1:20:51.120 --> 1:20:52.120]  of this.
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:55.360]  I mean, we had George Washington and things back then the lines were very clear.
[1:20:55.360 --> 1:20:58.120]  This is such a brainwash public.
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:00.680]  There's so much sickness, so much evil.
[1:21:00.680 --> 1:21:02.160]  They're coming with forced inoculations.
[1:21:02.160 --> 1:21:04.800]  They're coming with all this.
[1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:09.560]  This is something that we've got to pray for discernment and God to expose these enemies
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:13.560]  and we've got to expose them and we've got to understand that the information war is
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:15.640]  the most effective fighting against them.
[1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:16.880]  That's why they've been suppressing us.
[1:21:16.880 --> 1:21:22.480]  But obviously they've escalated to a whole other level themselves where they're in hundreds
[1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:26.760]  and hundreds of publications a day saying, I want violence.
[1:21:26.760 --> 1:21:29.960]  I want Joe Biden dead, even though that's not true.
[1:21:29.960 --> 1:21:33.920]  So that when they try to stage the killing of Joe Biden, whether they do it or not, he's
[1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:36.000]  very expendable to them.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.800]  They will turn around and say it's my fault.
[1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:41.840]  So I'm in the process of being set up right now because they know I'm going to oppose
[1:21:41.840 --> 1:21:42.840]  the chai comms.
[1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:44.240]  I'm a loyal American.
[1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:45.240]  I love God.
[1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.240]  I love justice.
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:47.240]  I love freedom.
[1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:50.160]  I'll tell you, I do this because of God.
[1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:53.840]  But number two, it's not my children, even though I love them or die for them.
[1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:54.840]  It's my ancestors.
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:59.720]  I none of my ancestors that I know about ever back down or traitors or pieces of filth and
[1:21:59.720 --> 1:22:05.040]  I will not start with Alex Jones in the year 2020 as being a cowardly, yellow-bellied little
[1:22:05.040 --> 1:22:06.040]  slime bag.
[1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:09.160]  And so understand, listeners, I get the calls.
[1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:11.320]  I've gotten them recently.
[1:22:11.320 --> 1:22:12.320]  How are you doing?
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:13.880]  Would you like to come in out of the cold?
[1:22:13.880 --> 1:22:15.840]  We're still ready to join with you.
[1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:17.520]  And it's not Democrats calling.
[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:18.520]  It's Republicans.
[1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:20.120]  I'm like, oh, gee, I wonder what I'll get.
[1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:24.720]  Well, we would give you a national TV show and no more problems, Alex and none of the
[1:22:24.720 --> 1:22:25.720]  stuff.
[1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:26.720]  It'll all end.
[1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:27.720]  It's all ready to end right now.
[1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:29.220]  Just, just please.
[1:22:29.220 --> 1:22:32.360]  I'm like, you know, it's not just going to end with that.
[1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:36.040]  And I can't live with myself sitting there doing things like that.
[1:22:36.040 --> 1:22:39.000]  So no.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.080]  And stop calling me.
[1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:45.520]  So and, you know, the feds are listing on the line while these conversations are happening.
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:47.520]  I mean, imagine how all these people feel.
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:53.240]  They all, you think the FBI was bad with Whitey Bolger knowing he was going around killing
[1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:57.800]  innocent women and stuff, they, he wasn't just, they didn't just know they were ordering
[1:22:57.800 --> 1:23:00.280]  him to do it.
[1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:03.160]  I mean, you know, how naive do you think I am?
[1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:08.440]  And so here we are at the end of this whole deal where pedophiles run everything and they're
[1:23:08.440 --> 1:23:09.640]  going to screw our kids.
[1:23:09.640 --> 1:23:12.440]  I mean, that's what this comes down to is they want our children.
[1:23:12.440 --> 1:23:13.440]  It's all about children.
[1:23:13.440 --> 1:23:18.440]  Oh, the big transgender organizations and groups and then how they've all joined in.
[1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:19.440]  LBGT activists.
[1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:21.840]  First, it was just the, you know, trans group.
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:25.040]  Now it's the LBGT community doesn't just want gay marriage.
[1:23:25.040 --> 1:23:28.160]  Now they want all children put on hormones.
[1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:29.160]  They're obsessed with your children.
[1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:31.160]  They don't want to just physically rape them.
[1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:36.320]  They want to rape their organs, rape their glands, take them over.
[1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:38.120]  This is a scientific takeover.
[1:23:38.120 --> 1:23:42.760]  So no, I will not join the pedophile devil works for armies.
[1:23:42.760 --> 1:23:43.760]  Okay.
[1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:46.160]  All you idiots work for the government, you go ahead and do it.
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:47.160]  See how that works out for you.
[1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:48.160]  They're right back.
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:49.160]  Stay with us.
[1:23:49.160 --> 1:23:53.560]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to
[1:23:53.560 --> 1:23:58.440]  redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:24:02.240]  Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally
[1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:03.440]  a chip under your skin.
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:09.440]  It's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos group and
[1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:14.160]  cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:19.320]  Foundation, all the rest of them at 10 to 21, 20 to 30, it's here and only gets worse
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:24.120]  like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:30.280]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diversity, evil and stopping
[1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:31.280]  abortion.
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:33.800]  We must start valuing human life again.
[1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:40.920]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:43.480]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:50.480]  We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:51.480]  Hey Steve, how you doing?
[1:24:51.480 --> 1:24:52.480]  Hey Alex.
[1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:53.480]  Oh my God.
[1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:54.480]  Long time listener.
[1:24:54.480 --> 1:24:55.480]  First time caller.
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:00.720]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and
[1:25:00.720 --> 1:25:05.160]  I was in there until June and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:06.160]  defense.
[1:25:06.160 --> 1:25:07.160]  Let me tell you something, man.
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:12.240]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or six years
[1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:16.720]  and the doctors, they tried every test, nobody could figure out what it is and then every
[1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:20.240]  day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what,
[1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:22.680]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense.
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:25.920]  Now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it.
[1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:30.040]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started
[1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:31.040]  taking it.
[1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:34.120]  Man, that stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[1:25:34.120 --> 1:25:37.720]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled, anybody's traveled
[1:25:37.720 --> 1:25:43.640]  to Boise, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:47.560]  It's true, folks, we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living
[1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:49.280]  defense is over the top good.
[1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:53.320]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:55.960]  They are forcing mutations.
[1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:58.360]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution.
[1:25:58.360 --> 1:26:03.040]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out,
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:07.920]  they are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more moral.
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:10.760]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity.
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:16.240]  Now we see some propaganda like communist China bragging, hey, we've done mRNA vaccines
[1:26:16.240 --> 1:26:18.240]  to make our soldiers superman.
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.120]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops.
[1:26:22.120 --> 1:26:24.480]  Well, the same thing with happening to our troops.
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:28.680]  And thousands and thousands of die each time they try a new experimental vaccine.
[1:26:28.680 --> 1:26:33.680]  I've talked to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas
[1:26:33.680 --> 1:26:34.680]  Health Department.
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:35.680]  They say Alex will know it hurts a lot of people.
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:36.680]  It's for a greater good.
[1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:37.680]  But that's not even true.
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:42.680]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:46.680]  This is violence being carried out against us by the military and we have a right to
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:52.680]  resist it with any means necessary.
[1:26:52.680 --> 1:27:03.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:04.680]  Welcome back to Alex Jones show.
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:05.680]  I said I'll take a lot of calls.
[1:27:05.680 --> 1:27:09.680]  I just took one call and I went off on that whole story about how crazy things are and
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:12.680]  how dangerous they are right now.
[1:27:12.680 --> 1:27:20.680]  And how real criminals, really bad wicked people that hate this country and hate its very existence
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:24.680]  are taking full control of it right now.
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:28.680]  And we can sit here in Monday morning quarterback about Trump not stopping the censorship and
[1:27:28.680 --> 1:27:32.680]  Trump going along with the vaccines and all that, but they hate his guts.
[1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:33.680]  He was taking control of it.
[1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:35.680]  He was rebuilding our industry.
[1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:37.680]  He was standing up to the chai comms.
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:40.680]  He was defending our borders.
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:47.680]  And so now the UN is announcing global government and the end of the United States.
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:51.680]  And then I'll see some weird psychologist online attacking me saying I'm crazy.
[1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:52.680]  It doesn't exist.
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:27:56.680]  Even though I could sit here and play you 100 clips of world leaders saying world governments
[1:27:56.680 --> 1:28:02.680]  here and the great reset of COVID is really to lower your carbon footprint and to make
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:04.680]  you poor so they control you.
[1:28:04.680 --> 1:28:05.680]  So there's no local businesses.
[1:28:05.680 --> 1:28:11.680]  So you've got to go to them to get your universal income.
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:16.680]  But with that comes forced inoculation and with that comes the social control and it's
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:17.680]  in the news today.
[1:28:17.680 --> 1:28:19.680]  Germany is announcing.
[1:28:19.680 --> 1:28:21.680]  The UK is announcing.
[1:28:21.680 --> 1:28:27.680]  The Democrats have introduced a bill where you get thousands of euros, thousands of
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:33.680]  pounds, thousands of dollars for taking the shot.
[1:28:33.680 --> 1:28:37.680]  Everything we told you because it's a plan, people.
[1:28:37.680 --> 1:28:41.680]  And they just hope you go, oh, that's just Jones claiming that.
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:46.680]  Well, I mean, how much more has to come true?
[1:28:46.680 --> 1:28:48.680]  They're coming for everybody.
[1:28:48.680 --> 1:28:51.680]  And you can say, well, there'll be loopholes for those of us that are smart.
[1:28:51.680 --> 1:28:54.680]  Yeah, at first.
[1:28:54.680 --> 1:28:55.680]  But you want that on your conscience?
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:59.680]  All these poor people getting sterilized, getting given cancer.
[1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:04.680]  That Jim Garrison cartoon is damn accurate to things that these vaccines do.
[1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:08.680]  And in the fine print, they go, oh, it can kill you or make you really sick and doesn't
[1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:09.680]  protect you.
[1:29:09.680 --> 1:29:11.680]  But the national news, oh, it's fine.
[1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.680]  No side effects.
[1:29:12.680 --> 1:29:13.680]  It's great.
[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:18.680]  I mean, this is evil.
[1:29:18.680 --> 1:29:20.680]  Spin the wheel of vaccines.
[1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:21.680]  You're sterilized.
[1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:22.680]  You die.
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:25.680]  You're tracked.
[1:29:25.680 --> 1:29:28.680]  You get Guillain-Barré's or narcolepsy.
[1:29:28.680 --> 1:29:30.680]  Your kids get autism.
[1:29:30.680 --> 1:29:31.680]  You get cancer.
[1:29:31.680 --> 1:29:36.680]  I mean, that you can back up every part of that.
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:39.680]  And to keep the fear going, the mask over your face all the time.
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:41.680]  OK, I'm going to go to your calls.
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:44.680]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:48.680]  But let me just play Mitch McConnell because I just had one of the crew members go, Mitch
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:50.680]  McConnell congratulated Biden.
[1:29:50.680 --> 1:29:51.680]  He didn't know that.
[1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:56.680]  Yeah, this happened, I guess, last night.
[1:29:56.680 --> 1:29:58.680]  And Putin's now congratulating him.
[1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:02.680]  So I'm not going to be somebody that's delusional.
[1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:03.680]  I've been optimistic.
[1:30:03.680 --> 1:30:05.680]  I know it's an information war.
[1:30:05.680 --> 1:30:09.680]  Mueller's massive election fraud.
[1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:14.680]  I know that we can obviously have these globalists indicted.
[1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:15.680]  It's true.
[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:17.680]  Trump expanded Guantanamo Bay, refused to close it.
[1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:20.680]  But that doesn't mean they're going to ship the globalists to it.
[1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:21.680]  And so what are we going to do?
[1:30:21.680 --> 1:30:24.680]  That's another question on January 20th.
[1:30:24.680 --> 1:30:32.680]  When they inaugurate that monster, we need 10 million people in D.C.
[1:30:32.680 --> 1:30:37.680]  to let the system know, hey, your guy can't get 10 people out.
[1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:40.680]  Because that's when the real resistance starts, folks.
[1:30:40.680 --> 1:30:45.680]  And you better resist everything Biden does because his plan is to break our back.
[1:30:45.680 --> 1:30:50.680]  And I'm not going to sit here idly by and go along with it.
[1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:51.680]  So I thank you all.
[1:30:51.680 --> 1:30:52.680]  And I appreciate you all.
[1:30:52.680 --> 1:30:56.680]  And I'll tell you all again, the enemy works around the clock to suppress this broadcast.
[1:30:56.680 --> 1:30:58.680]  So support those local radio stations.
[1:30:58.680 --> 1:31:01.680]  Tell folks about them, those local TV stations.
[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:05.680]  If you're listening on the Internet, contact your local UHF and VHF.
[1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:09.680]  Tell them go to infowars.com, port slash affiliates to find the whole listing of us.
[1:31:09.680 --> 1:31:11.680]  And now we're free to air for TV.
[1:31:11.680 --> 1:31:14.680]  I can't do it with radio because I'm partnered with radio.
[1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:17.680]  But where the network gets half the ads, then locals get the half.
[1:31:17.680 --> 1:31:26.680]  But we're free to air with Owen Schreuer and with David Knight on the TV.
[1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:27.680]  And so am I.
[1:31:27.680 --> 1:31:33.680]  And I like Genesis to work with them 24 or 25 years, but I am moving towards a completely free to air model for radio.
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:36.680]  That's really what stations want where they get all the ads.
[1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:38.680]  And that would probably get us another 200 affiliates.
[1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:40.680]  And I'm not waiting for Limbaugh to die.
[1:31:40.680 --> 1:31:41.680]  I'm sad about it.
[1:31:41.680 --> 1:31:43.680]  We already have stations that are already contacting.
[1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:49.680]  And I think if we go with a push for free to air, that'll override Clear Channel and what they're doing.
[1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:52.680]  And then we'll get a lot more affiliates and get a lot more people.
[1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:55.680]  So I'm looking at a free to air model for talk radio.
[1:31:55.680 --> 1:31:58.680]  No one's ever done that.
[1:31:58.680 --> 1:32:00.680]  All the ads are given to local stations.
[1:32:00.680 --> 1:32:02.680]  We're looking at that right now.
[1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:05.680]  Because all I care about is getting hearts and minds of people up.
[1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:09.680]  And again, we hope Limbaugh doesn't die.
[1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:14.680]  That Trump go, where it is when Limbaugh retires, you're going to take his slot.
[1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:16.680]  I'm like, well, sir, I'm not really waiting for that.
[1:32:16.680 --> 1:32:17.680]  There's a little news item.
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:20.680]  Trump did tell me that years ago.
[1:32:20.680 --> 1:32:23.680]  So I certainly don't want to climb over dead bodies to get more radio stations.
[1:32:23.680 --> 1:32:24.680]  It isn't about that.
[1:32:24.680 --> 1:32:26.680]  I think Limbaugh's come a long way.
[1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:28.680]  I hope Limbaugh lives another 20 years.
[1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:33.680]  But to be honest, like I told you, Rick Bader Ginsburg would be dead in about six months.
[1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:35.680]  I think Limbaugh's gone in a year.
[1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:36.680]  But pray for him.
[1:32:36.680 --> 1:32:38.680]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:41.680]  Who's been holding here?
[1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:45.680]  Let's talk to Joshua in Delaware on Trump's next 36 days.
[1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:49.680]  Go ahead.
[1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:50.680]  Hello?
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:51.680]  Yes, sir.
[1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:54.680]  Hey, Alex, I'll keep it short and sweet and to the point.
[1:32:54.680 --> 1:33:01.680]  But I think in the next 36 days, Trump should keep on keeping on doing what he's doing.
[1:33:01.680 --> 1:33:04.680]  And our enemy is the CCP.
[1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:09.680]  I think we should at all costs avoid a civil war because I think that's what the CCP wants.
[1:33:09.680 --> 1:33:12.680]  They want to exhaust us with civil war and then invade.
[1:33:12.680 --> 1:33:20.680]  But I think when it comes to Antifa and the BLM likes that we should try to put aside our differences anyway.
[1:33:20.680 --> 1:33:25.680]  You can be the better people.
[1:33:25.680 --> 1:33:29.680]  Well, some of them can be reached out to, but a lot of them know this is part of the CCP takeover.
[1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:32.680]  Antifa actually praises the Communist Party of China.
[1:33:32.680 --> 1:33:34.680]  You're absolutely right that we don't want violence.
[1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:35.680]  We don't want civil war.
[1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:37.680]  That's part of the globalist plan to bring us down.
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:42.680]  We need civil disobedience against big globalist corporations and against the New World Order.
[1:33:42.680 --> 1:33:47.680]  And we need to boycott them and target them with nonviolent action.
[1:33:47.680 --> 1:33:49.680]  But I mean, right to the edge of the law.
[1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:52.680]  The system is scared of that, brother.
[1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:53.680]  Definitely.
[1:33:53.680 --> 1:33:59.680]  And I think Trump should just uphold law and order and Trump supporters need to stand behind them all the way.
[1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:01.680]  And keep God, country, and family.
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:03.680]  Be an example of Christ's love.
[1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:06.680]  Well, I'll tell you this, the military is just waiting.
[1:34:06.680 --> 1:34:12.680]  I mean, if Trump gave Army Special Operations Command the green light, they would do whatever he told them right now.
[1:34:12.680 --> 1:34:17.680]  And I'm not even saying that should be done because that's such a responsibility and so dangerous.
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:20.680]  If you think about it, I'm not somebody that just shoots my mouth off like that.
[1:34:20.680 --> 1:34:22.680]  But this is a Communist Chinese takeover.
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:24.680]  They plan on cutting our economy off.
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:25.680]  It'll hurt millions.
[1:34:25.680 --> 1:34:27.680]  It's killing the third world, already killing millions.
[1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:30.680]  And I mean, I know what George Washington would do.
[1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:32.680]  George Washington was president right now.
[1:34:32.680 --> 1:34:41.680]  He would call the military in and he would execute order number 66.
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:42.680]  But here we are.
[1:34:42.680 --> 1:34:45.680]  I mean, Trump doesn't have men like George Washington had.
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:46.680]  Let's just be honest about it.
[1:34:46.680 --> 1:34:49.680]  He's got the low-level ones that are just as good.
[1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:55.680]  But man, the lawyers and the scum have just infiltrated every facet, brother.
[1:34:55.680 --> 1:34:56.680]  Amen.
[1:34:56.680 --> 1:34:57.680]  Thank you, sir.
[1:34:57.680 --> 1:34:58.680]  Thank you.
[1:34:58.680 --> 1:35:01.680]  All right, let's go to Angel in Louisiana.
[1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:02.680]  You're on the air.
[1:35:02.680 --> 1:35:03.680]  You're a nurse.
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:04.680]  Says you work in a COVID unit.
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:05.680]  Go ahead.
[1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:06.680]  Hey, Alex.
[1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:07.680]  This is Angela.
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:09.680]  So, yeah, I'm a travel nurse.
[1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:14.680]  I've worked all over the United States and I just kind of wanted to let you know what it's like to work in a COVID unit.
[1:35:14.680 --> 1:35:16.680]  It's not what people think.
[1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:22.680]  People think that we're wearing the N95 masks and this is actually what they show on TV, which blows my mind.
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:24.680]  We don't actually wear N95 masks.
[1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:31.680]  What we do is we wear the regular masks like you see people wear on the streets every day, just a regular surgical mask.
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:33.680]  We wear our gowns.
[1:35:33.680 --> 1:35:40.680]  We wear our gloves and we go into each of all the rooms wearing the exact same PPE.
[1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:44.680]  And by the way, that's what Trump said two weeks ago on a tweet.
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:46.680]  He said, look at other in a parking garage.
[1:35:46.680 --> 1:35:47.680]  There's no patients.
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:48.680]  They're all in a spacesuit.
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:49.680]  That is PR.
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:51.680]  That is, that is hype.
[1:35:51.680 --> 1:35:53.680]  And I've talked to family that work in the medical field.
[1:35:53.680 --> 1:35:56.680]  They're saying exactly what you say, Angela.
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  It's the truth.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:35:59.680]  I mean, I'm telling you the absolute truth.
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:07.680]  I worked all over the hospital at this specific hospital on the other floors that aren't actual COVID units.
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:09.680]  And keep in mind, these COVID patients, they don't actually know what's going on.
[1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:12.680]  They don't actually need to be in the hospital.
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:15.680]  You go in the room, they're breathing just fine.
[1:36:15.680 --> 1:36:20.680]  I'm not saying that some of them can't breathe because there is another unit that they go to.
[1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:25.680]  But the unit that I'm on, they could easily be at home recovering from COVID.
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:29.680]  But the hospital gets to code it and get so much more money, right?
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:30.680]  I'm sure.
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:31.680]  I'm sure.
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:32.680]  Hold on.
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:33.680]  Stay there, Angela.
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:34.680]  Sorry, I called you, Angela.
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:35.680]  You're an angel.
[1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:36.680]  Come back and finish up your observations.
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:39.680]  There's a lot of doctors coming on as the guests.
[1:36:39.680 --> 1:36:43.680]  And then old dude, Robert, Andrew, Greg, Jesse, Ken, Christine, Catherine, we're going to everybody.
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:37:12.680]  Stay with us.
[1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:42.680]  Stay with us.

[1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:56.680]  Stay with us.
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:39:57.680]  Stay with us.
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:39:58.680]  Stay with us.
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:39:59.680]  Stay with us.
[1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:00.680]  Stay.
[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:01.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:02.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:02.680 --> 1:40:03.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:03.680 --> 1:40:04.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:04.680 --> 1:40:05.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:05.680 --> 1:40:06.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:06.680 --> 1:40:07.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:07.680 --> 1:40:08.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:09.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:10.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:11.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:12.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:13.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:13.680 --> 1:40:14.680]  Stay with us.
[1:40:14.680 --> 1:40:19.400]  COVID. They admit their internal documents truly about a cashless society control system. Don't
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:24.680]  have that power over you. They protect their locations. They protect where they're going
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:29.400]  and what they're doing. I can tell you, I was the first person 20 years ago said cover up the
[1:40:29.400 --> 1:40:33.560]  cameras on your computer. And now of course, Bill Gates and all of them admit they're doing that.
[1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:37.880]  Mark Zuckerberg. So get your privacy pockets. They make great stocking stuffers and great gifts.
[1:40:37.880 --> 1:40:42.280]  They've been sold out for months. They're little fair day changes going 1995. You're back in stock
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:47.160]  at infowarestore.com. Give the gift of privacy and security and safety with privacy pockets at
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:41:16.920]  infowarestore.com. All right, we are back going to your calls. I'm Alex Jones, your host, Angela
[1:41:16.920 --> 1:41:21.960]  is a nurse in Louisiana and she was hitting some really big points. Go ahead and recap that and
[1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:28.280]  add any other points to this testimony. So folks know what's happening. Yeah, so basically what I
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:34.280]  was saying was the COVID units, there's two separate ones. The one that I work on, what they
[1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:39.640]  show on TV. If not, we don't wear in 95 masks. We wear the same mask that you see people wearing
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:48.040]  in public. We wear, you know, the basic PPE, which is protective gear basically. And also as far as
[1:41:48.040 --> 1:41:52.840]  the vaccinations go, I haven't talked to a single nurse who has said that they want to take the
[1:41:52.840 --> 1:42:01.240]  vaccination. None of us want to have it. None of us want to be vaccinated with this COVID vaccine.
[1:42:01.240 --> 1:42:10.040]  Number one, it hasn't had enough people to know what the actual reactions are going to be. And
[1:42:10.040 --> 1:42:17.160]  two, we don't even know if it's really that safe. And by the way, in national polls, two-thirds of
[1:42:17.160 --> 1:42:21.160]  people say they don't want to take it. They have polls of firefighter groups, police medical groups,
[1:42:21.160 --> 1:42:25.560]  even higher numbers don't. But then the media app track, it's weird that everyone's going to take it.
[1:42:25.560 --> 1:42:30.920]  That's total gaslighting. When I talk to nurses and doctors, I know a military, I know that
[1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:35.960]  have been subjected to vaccines. They're the biggest critics of them because they know the pit
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:41.960]  falls. And that's of regular vaccines, contamination, side effects, autoimmune responses. But they're
[1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:47.320]  now saying with these mRNA vaccines that go in and reprogram the mitochondria, that's not a vaccine,
[1:42:47.320 --> 1:42:54.120]  that's a mutagenogenic. It changes your body. It absolutely changes your body and what your
[1:42:54.120 --> 1:42:59.880]  body can do 100%. And like I said, I haven't talked to a single nurse who says that they want that
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:05.320]  vaccine. And the nurses that they're showing on TV that are taking those vaccines, you can't tell me
[1:43:05.320 --> 1:43:10.200]  that they either aren't being paid a lot of money because that's what they are doing. They're wanting
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:15.480]  to pay us to number one, take the vaccine and then give us a lot of time off when we do take the
[1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:20.120]  vaccine. So if it's a normal vaccine, why are you paying us? And why are you giving us a lot of
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:24.600]  time off? And by the way, have you noticed the image? Not this year, but worldwide. It's a black
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:30.760]  nurse giving a black woman the vaccine. And it's the same thing in print, in shoot after shoot,
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:35.560]  not just these two black women, it's other black women, because black folks statistically have
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:39.800]  learned about Tuskegee and learned about secret experimentation. And so they're saying they're
[1:43:39.800 --> 1:43:44.360]  not going to do it. And so they're literally showing black people taking the shot, hoping black
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:50.520]  folks taking them. This is diabolical. Yeah, it's really sad. And it's like so many people are so
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:56.840]  brainwashed into watching what they see on TV. Instead of seeing what's happening in the world
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:04.280]  around them, that they don't understand or they don't realize or they're just so incapacitated by
[1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:10.360]  what's being shown on TV that they think it's real. And it's not real. Like if you talk to a
[1:44:10.360 --> 1:44:16.120]  real person, real nurse, a real doctor, like you said, a real firefighter, they're going to tell
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:22.120]  you what's really going on. Oh, that's why they had to censor thousands of doctors and nurses who've
[1:44:22.120 --> 1:44:26.840]  said what you said. John Hopkins put a report out again two weeks ago saying same amount of deaths
[1:44:26.840 --> 1:44:31.640]  this year as last year, basically. This year's actually a little bit less. So where'd all the
[1:44:31.640 --> 1:44:36.200]  other deaths go? Well, they call flu and pneumonia deaths. COVID. And we all know people really die
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:41.400]  of the flu. They die of pneumonia. My God, it's real. But this new COVID thing is just incredible.
[1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:46.040]  Thank you so much, Angela, for your testimony. We really appreciate you and keep warning folks
[1:44:46.040 --> 1:44:51.480]  that last point you made, though, can you elaborate on that? This is amazing. Because I've seen this
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:56.520]  in the news. A lot of people going, they just hear they have it. So, oh, I better be in the hospital.
[1:44:56.520 --> 1:44:59.080]  And so for a cough and a fever, you're now in the hospital.
[1:45:00.120 --> 1:45:04.440]  No, and see, it's not necessary. These people that are in the COVID unit, they don't even need to be
[1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:11.800]  there. They could be recovering at home. And these people with COVID, I mean, for the most part,
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:16.520]  it's not the COVID that they're in the hospital for. They have an underlying condition
[1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:20.520]  that's causing them to be hospitalized. Like they've had pneumonia in the past,
[1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:25.640]  or they have a lung condition, or they have heart disease. So the COVID is just basically,
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:31.320]  like the flu would, it's causing them to have lung issues or heart issues, or another kind of
[1:45:31.320 --> 1:45:38.520]  issue that they already have. And it's, it's, it's not the COVID that's causing the death.
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:44.120]  I read this weekend, this weekend in my hotel room in DC, three more studies that just came out
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:49.320]  by prestigious medical facilities. And Angela, thank you. God bless you. And anybody can type
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:58.520]  these in. But one headline was 80% of hospitalized COVID patients were vitamin D3 deficient.
[1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:07.000]  Another was no one study shows no one has died who was not deficient. There was another study
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:12.840]  about it. I mean, these are facts. And they had some weird psychologists that as a popular YouTube
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:21.720]  show, attacking me saying, Jones is insane. He's a liar. He says you need D3. And then, and then,
[1:46:21.720 --> 1:46:25.640]  and you know, he needs to be investigated. He's treating COVID. I'm not treating COVID.
[1:46:26.360 --> 1:46:31.880]  I'm saying if you don't have oxygen, you die four minutes. You don't have water, you die a week.
[1:46:31.880 --> 1:46:37.800]  You don't have food, you die a month. Yeah, there it is. They found it. 80% of COVID-19 patients
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:43.160]  Spanish study had vitamin D deficiency and that's something like 46% of Americans have it.
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:48.440]  And again, the FDA says a very low levels of mouth. They keep lowering recommended daily
[1:46:48.440 --> 1:46:53.240]  analysis. And again, folks, I'm not perfect. I eat steaks. I drink too much. I'm under super
[1:46:53.240 --> 1:46:59.880]  stress. I work 18 hours a day. I guzzle caffeine. When I tell you all this health stuff, it's because
[1:46:59.880 --> 1:47:04.360]  I need to be listening to. I'm not lecturing you. I'm just saying what we all need to do.
[1:47:04.360 --> 1:47:07.080]  And then they go, Jones sells vitamins and minerals.
[1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:11.560]  They had to have the producer come in here and say, listen, we do know from the accountants,
[1:47:11.560 --> 1:47:15.000]  you're not bringing in any money right now, you need to plug. So I'm gonna do it right now and
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:22.760]  go back to your calls. This is the USPS map. One day delivery about half the US. If you order
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:26.920]  one day before Christmas, you'll get it on Christmas or the day before. You can see the
[1:47:26.920 --> 1:47:31.480]  two-day delivery map and the three-day delivery map, your TV viewer. Now, we're saying get your
[1:47:31.480 --> 1:47:36.680]  orders in by the 18th to get it days before Christmas, but that's if you're in Hawaii or Alaska.
[1:47:37.880 --> 1:47:43.880]  You can order on Monday and get it almost everywhere in the United States in the lower 48.
[1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:47.640]  But I'm just saying get your orders in. Normally, December is our biggest month.
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:55.240]  And that's not happening right now. And again, I'm not complaining, but we have three to five
[1:47:55.240 --> 1:48:00.600]  times our traffic. It's never been this high except right before the last election. And normally,
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:04.440]  traffic money comes in. We're seeing the opposite because the economy shut down. I get it, believe
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:10.840]  me. I got a lot of family that work two jobs. And we're not seeing the money come in, which really
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:14.520]  concerns me for next year because they want to shut us down. So listen, spend your money where
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:19.480]  you want to, but don't do your Christmas shopping at the big box stores that are globalist. And
[1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:24.200]  don't do it with Amazon and others that are setting up a new order. We've got the best fish oil.
[1:48:24.200 --> 1:48:28.120]  We've got the best PQQQQ10 DNA Force Plus. We've got living defense
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:33.640]  that just got back in stock for months being sold out. It's 50% off despite the fact it's been
[1:48:33.640 --> 1:48:38.120]  sold out because I want you to have it for you and your family. And if you don't have a problem in
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:42.760]  the flora and stuff in your gut, it's still nutritious and good for you. If you are like
[1:48:42.760 --> 1:48:47.080]  most people that have a little unwanted visitors, this is spectacular results why it's got like
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:54.720]  at 99% review rate. Last time I checked on alert is now at infowarstore.com. But Living
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:49:00.080]  Defense has all these amazing herbals in it, has all these amazing botanicals in it that
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:05.520]  are organic and super potent and super strong and everybody at least once a year should
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:10.880]  do this week long cleanse. There's enough for two people to do a cleanse in each bottle
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:15.760]  and it takes a few weeks to do it. So for one person there's over a month of dosages,
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:24.400]  enough for two people to do the cleanse properly. There's 100% reviews, 4.9 stars, my goodness.
[1:49:24.400 --> 1:49:28.160]  And I guess we must have updated, oh plus is even stronger. We had thousands of reviews
[1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:31.520]  on the old one. When you update a product you got to say plus or give it a new name
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:36.640]  under FDA rules. So I guess this is a newer product so it doesn't have as many reviews.
[1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:43.440]  But 100% reviews, infowarstore.com. I got advised to put this product up by group. We never
[1:49:43.440 --> 1:49:46.760]  promoted it and became this best seller when people tried it, weren't a mouth made a best
[1:49:46.760 --> 1:49:52.280]  seller. And so you've heard the right reviews about it. What it does is really amazing.
[1:49:52.280 --> 1:49:56.160]  So I would give friends and family. In fact, I told my wife, I said let's just give friends
[1:49:56.160 --> 1:50:00.200]  and family Living Defense an X2, which is again, most people are deficient in iodine.
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:03.240]  This is the true iodine. It goes right into your cells, right into your blood. It's not
[1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:08.400]  bound iodine. It's truly atomic. We have to have a DEA license for the manufacturer because
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:16.240]  the precursor is a controlled substance. But the point is it's an infowarstore.com X2,
[1:50:16.240 --> 1:50:21.080]  X3 alpha power sold out for almost a year because of the breakdowns in the supply chain.
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:25.640]  We were going to have to discontinue it. All of a sudden the product was available. Again,
[1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:32.240]  it's got patented ingredients that boost your testosterone naturally. Also, we have prostagar,
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:36.160]  which is good for women as well. Everybody takes top of them out of their prostate, but

[1:50:43.840 --> 1:50:49.000]  still discounted 50% infowarstore.com. They're going to find a better product. It says 33
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:55.080]  right there. But I was actually at a meeting last week. I said, we're not making 100% back
[1:50:55.080 --> 1:51:01.480]  on this. It's 50% or more. So whatever, 1995, you can't get a multivitamin with salt palm

[1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:43.960]  The project for world government developed by the British Empire via Cecil Rhodes
[1:52:43.960 --> 1:52:48.760]  then picked up by the Rockefeller family and the major Robert Barons, the planet by the 1920s,
[1:52:48.760 --> 1:52:54.120]  is all about corporate global governance. And now you're seeing the blue states, the blue cities,
[1:52:54.120 --> 1:52:58.680]  the communists and socialists, nations all working in unison under UN control
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:04.920]  to establish a medical planetary dictatorship. At the core of it is the Fortune 100 corporations
[1:53:04.920 --> 1:53:09.640]  themselves funded by a handful of private central banking families, the Rothschilds,
[1:53:09.640 --> 1:53:14.120]  the Rockefellers, the Dutch and British royalty being at the very heart of that. Then you learn
[1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:19.000]  the Dutch and British royalty aren't even Dutch or British at the same time, but they go back to
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:26.520]  the literal count Dracula and the wars in between Christendom and Islam. Those that don't know history
[1:53:26.520 --> 1:53:31.560]  really are doomed to repeat it. They're involved in plotting the world economy. That's what the
[1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:35.720]  social distancing, the mask are all about. It's about bankrupting local small businesses and
[1:53:35.720 --> 1:53:38.760]  those that comply are complying with your own destruction. Wake up.
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:49.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:49.160 --> 1:54:03.160]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[1:54:03.160 --> 1:54:10.760]  Nurse Erin Marie Olszewski is going to be joining us coming up next segment when some of the
[1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:15.560]  stations join us. We really appreciate coming on. We had an amazing nurse call in earlier
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:19.720]  talking about basically COVID being an overblown fraud. She's a major whistleblower. We really
[1:54:19.720 --> 1:54:23.000]  appreciate her coming up in a moment and then we'll continue on up. She leaves and take your
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:27.480]  calls. All right, now let's go to old dude in Missouri. Old dude. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:54:27.480 --> 1:54:32.840]  First off, man. Hey, I just want to thank you for what you've done. I know you hear that a
[1:54:32.840 --> 1:54:36.600]  lot, but I've never had an opportunity to speak with you before. So I wanted to say that first
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:41.640]  and foremost, you've been very influential in a lot of people's lives. Second thing I want to say
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:49.160]  is the bodies and the X2 is amazing. I played football in college. I had some injuries and
[1:54:49.160 --> 1:54:53.720]  the bodies allows me to do things that most people my age just can't do. I mean, I went out and
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:58.520]  played flag football here a few weeks ago and was running with guys that were in their early 20s
[1:54:58.520 --> 1:55:04.920]  and I'm almost 40. So the products are awesome. As far as what Donald Trump could do, one thing he
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:09.880]  could do is make a call out to all local law enforcement and militias to organize all able
[1:55:09.880 --> 1:55:15.400]  body patriots. And now I realize he would be signaling to the people who have control over
[1:55:15.400 --> 1:55:20.520]  things in the economy and they could take some steps. But if we can organize together, I feel
[1:55:20.520 --> 1:55:24.840]  like that could be an effective thing that we could do to keep our own local communities safe.
[1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:29.960]  And then another thing is communities need to be able to fund their own people. If the left can
[1:55:29.960 --> 1:55:35.720]  fund people like Barack Obama, how is it that communities of say 10, 20,000 people can't come
[1:55:35.720 --> 1:55:40.760]  up with $100 a month from 50 people? I totally agree. We've got to politically weaponize,
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:45.160]  like it's a war and we can do it better than the bad guys and literally start our own think tanks,
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:49.400]  our own groups, our own people and then run our people. We'll kick the left's ass at that.
[1:55:49.400 --> 1:55:53.400]  They've all been secret in groups doing it. We won't be secret. We'll energize,
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:56:00.280]  we'll run people against Soros, putting in all his operatives at the DA's. This has got to be done.
[1:56:00.280 --> 1:56:04.280]  We got to mobilize now. Total mobilization, total commitment.
[1:56:05.240 --> 1:56:08.760]  Absolutely. And the people that are on our side of this, they need to understand
[1:56:08.760 --> 1:56:13.560]  the foundation of reality is on our side. The foundation of reality that God has put in place,
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:18.200]  it establishes our perspective. If people are going around and they don't even recognize and
[1:56:18.200 --> 1:56:23.640]  acknowledge that God is the creator of everything, then their perspective of reality is going to be
[1:56:24.280 --> 1:56:28.200]  off base. They're going to be upside down. There's a reason why God talks about how it's
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:33.400]  important to be upright and grounded and rooted on the foundation of reality. And I'm here to tell
[1:56:33.400 --> 1:56:39.480]  you, man, hey, look, we're spinning around the sun at 66,000 miles an hour. The next closest star is
[1:56:39.480 --> 1:56:46.680]  25 trillion miles away. It didn't just happen by accident. Every atheist on the planet is a liar.
[1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:51.960]  Nobody looks at those stars and thinks, hmm, that just happened by random chance. So people need to
[1:56:51.960 --> 1:56:58.120]  organize and they need to stand on the foundation of reality that God has provided us through Jesus
[1:56:58.120 --> 1:57:03.560]  Christ and the people who brought the message forth to the world and understand that we have
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:09.000]  God on our side because the literal essence of his truth is written in his words and communicated
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:13.960]  to humanity as the foundation of reality. And if we don't have perspective of it,
[1:57:13.960 --> 1:57:18.360]  we're just floating around trying to solve the problems and we're just offering solutions to
[1:57:18.360 --> 1:57:26.200]  effects, but not the cause. That's right, brother. It is a spiritual war and we see the enemy attacking.
[1:57:26.200 --> 1:57:30.840]  That's because the enemy knows it's in trouble. It's been forced out in the open. So as negative
[1:57:30.840 --> 1:57:36.520]  as this is at one level, I see it as very, very positive at others. Amen. Amen. And hey, Alex,
[1:57:36.520 --> 1:57:42.600]  if I may, could I direct people to one video and I have no monetary gain in it? I don't care,
[1:57:42.600 --> 1:57:48.600]  brother. Direct us to it. I don't care. It's old dude perspective and numbers on YouTube.
[1:57:49.640 --> 1:57:56.520]  And old dude is O L and then D U D E. I'm just old dude, man. And I'm just out here trying to raise
[1:57:56.520 --> 1:58:02.120]  my family and trying to tell people the truth. And I've been like a lot of other people and I
[1:58:02.120 --> 1:58:06.280]  kind of got you want to hook up with others and form a resistance and we love you. God bless you.
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:11.160]  All right. We've got our special guest straight ahead out of all these amazing whistleblowers.
[1:58:11.160 --> 1:58:16.360]  Hers was some of the most dynamic, in fact, probably the most in there showing the evidence,
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:20.440]  having the will to do it, having the courage. It's coming up because we're right back where we
[1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:25.080]  were six, eight months ago. They're ready to do it again. And so I'm going to try to really let her
[1:58:25.080 --> 1:58:30.120]  give you the unfiltered perspective because I know they have fought to suppress her information.
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:33.880]  Major whistleblower nurse from New York on the other side of Knowledge Jones.
[1:58:33.880 --> 1:58:38.680]  Tell everybody, you know, tune in now to info wars.com, port slash show, band dot video,
[1:58:38.680 --> 1:58:42.440]  and the local radio stations and TV stations pick up this up. Then later, once this is archived,
[1:58:42.440 --> 1:58:43.160]  share this interview.
[1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:50.440]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[1:58:50.440 --> 1:58:56.600]  They want control. They want domesticated slaves. That's the process that is taking place right now.
[1:58:56.600 --> 1:59:01.800]  And when you shop at the big box stores and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they are
[1:59:01.800 --> 1:59:06.520]  creating monopolies and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control,
[1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:10.360]  abortion, world government, all of it. If you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[1:59:10.360 --> 1:59:15.080]  But if you'll shop at info wars, where we have thousands of products made right here in America
[1:59:15.080 --> 1:59:19.640]  with our warehouses and our crew, it's incredible and it changes the whole world.
[1:59:19.640 --> 1:59:23.800]  So do your shopping. If you want to fund the info lord, if you want to stop the globalist
[1:59:23.800 --> 1:59:27.720]  at info wars store.com and tell others do their shopping and info wars store.com.
[1:59:27.720 --> 1:59:31.240]  We have amazing products. We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas.
[1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:35.320]  If you order by the 18th. So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[1:59:35.320 --> 1:59:38.600]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money
[1:59:38.600 --> 2:00:05.880]  and do your shopping and get great products at info wars store.com.
[2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:13.640]  We've got nurse olshashki joining us right now. Nurse Erin Marie Olshashki.
[2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:18.840]  She has spent her life fighting for freedom for everyday Americans. The young woman,
[2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:23.000]  she joined the U.S. Army to fight overseas and Operation Iraqi Freedom turning home.
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:27.480]  She earned her focus driving dedication to defending our most deeply held values in American soil.
[2:00:27.480 --> 2:00:31.560]  She spent years fighting for medical freedom in 2020. Erin volunteered with the front lines
[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:35.800]  yet again by traveling nurse assigned to New York's Elmhurst Hospital, which has one of
[2:00:35.800 --> 2:00:39.480]  the highest death rates, which we'll talk about that during the COVID-19 pandemic.
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:45.400]  What she found horrified her and inspired a new focus of her advocacy. Erin's newly published
[2:00:45.400 --> 2:00:50.760]  book, the undercover epicenter nurse reveals how gross negligence, insurance fraud, medical
[2:00:50.760 --> 2:00:56.040]  malpractice and good old fashioned greed are killing everyday Americans at Elmhurst and beyond.
[2:00:56.040 --> 2:01:02.920]  Her new fight is a fight for return to ethics, transparency and respect for truth values.
[2:01:02.920 --> 2:01:08.360]  And she goes on from there. We're very, very excited to have her. She's at nurse Erin,
[2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:15.080]  nurse Erin with two E's. And we really, again, are excited to have her. We've played her clubs
[2:01:15.080 --> 2:01:19.000]  many times here. We'll get to some of those next segment where she actually shows the proof,
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:25.720]  didn't just say it, but wow, simply amazing with what really happened. So thank you for joining
[2:01:25.720 --> 2:01:30.760]  us. How should we start this out? You've got so much info, so much knowledge. What's the best
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:36.840]  way to break this down for people because this is a ongoing crime that's actually expanding
[2:01:36.840 --> 2:01:41.640]  since you first blew the whistle. Yeah, well, thank you for having me Alex. First of all,
[2:01:41.640 --> 2:01:47.960]  I really appreciate it. There's not many that expose the truth like you and a lot of people don't
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:53.720]  want to hear my story, especially the left wing media. But I guess starting out, I mean,
[2:01:53.720 --> 2:02:00.840]  I guess originally I'm from Florida. That's where I reside now. So when this whole pandemic kind of
[2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:06.360]  first came crumbling down in March, you know, we were waiting for the wave in Florida and we just
[2:02:06.360 --> 2:02:12.760]  didn't see it. And all the while we're watching New York, you know, just get slammed. So as nurses,
[2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:18.920]  a lot of us were furloughed, we were looking for work. And an opportunity presented itself for
[2:02:18.920 --> 2:02:24.920]  me to travel to New York to help out. And so that's what I did. And what I found there was
[2:02:26.920 --> 2:02:34.040]  unheard of. Ultimately, what I found there was a whole lot of murder. And so I had no choice,
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:39.880]  you know, in good conscience, I couldn't, you know, be part of the problem. I needed to be part of
[2:02:39.880 --> 2:02:46.360]  the solution. And that's why I decided to record it and prove and share the truth with the people.
[2:02:46.360 --> 2:02:53.640]  And you didn't just make the claim this was basically murder. You showed the video, you showed the
[2:02:53.640 --> 2:02:57.800]  proof at your own, you know, risks, but whistleblowers are protected when they violate, you know,
[2:02:57.800 --> 2:03:01.800]  quote, HIPAA or whatever by the fact that you're exposing a crime. The fact they didn't come after
[2:03:01.800 --> 2:03:05.960]  you, at least from my knowledge, shows how scared they are of this info. So when you say there's
[2:03:05.960 --> 2:03:10.440]  murder going on, walk through it, you've got the floor here, what you witnessed, what you saw,
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:16.920]  when the alarm bells rang, what you documented. Well, a lot of the public doesn't know. When I
[2:03:16.920 --> 2:03:21.720]  first got there, and I've been to war, I've been to Iraq, I know what being on the actual front
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:26.920]  lines in battle is. And so getting off the plane in New York, I sat around for three days. There
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:32.600]  was nurses that were be got there before me that were sitting there for up to three weeks. And we're
[2:03:32.600 --> 2:03:39.160]  getting paid $10,000 a week as nurses, which is a lot of money. In my opinion, I feel like it was
[2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:44.440]  hushed money. A lot of, you know, nurses didn't want to say anything because they wanted their
[2:03:44.440 --> 2:03:49.560]  paycheck. But when I first got into the hospital, I was assigned to Elmhurst Hospital, which was
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:03:56.680]  ultimately the epicenter of the epicenter. And what they were doing is essentially admitting
[2:03:56.680 --> 2:04:00.840]  pretty much everyone, regardless if they had COVID or not, because there was a price tag.
[2:04:01.400 --> 2:04:07.000]  It was $13,000 to admit them to the floor, $39,000 to put them on a ventilator, knowing
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:13.160]  that ventilators, by the time I got there in early April, had killed absolutely every single one of
[2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:19.960]  their patients. So this was essentially an assembly line to a body bag. You know, they come into the
[2:04:19.960 --> 2:04:24.280]  emergency room, they get admitted to the floors, regardless if they had COVID or not.
[2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:29.720]  And let's be clear, it's not like starting to erupt. It's not like you're just a new nurse,
[2:04:29.720 --> 2:04:37.160]  or somebody that worked in a small town like Mayberry with Barney Five. You'd been in combat
[2:04:37.160 --> 2:04:42.520]  hospitals, you'd seen arms and legs blown off, people shot with RPGs, you'd seen real trauma,
[2:04:42.520 --> 2:04:48.200]  real war, real desperate, working 18 hours a day sometimes during battles, versus you're
[2:04:48.200 --> 2:04:52.120]  sitting around your hotel room getting 10 grand. So right up front, you're thinking something's
[2:04:52.120 --> 2:04:58.680]  weird here. Yeah, it was a red flag. I mean, this was not a war zone. And even when I got into the
[2:04:58.680 --> 2:05:03.720]  hospitals, we were, we were well staffed. You know, I can imagine in the very beginning they weren't,
[2:05:03.720 --> 2:05:09.400]  but the time I got there, they were well staffed. And then it was the treatment. You know, I,
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:15.000]  in my hospital, our governor, Governor Ron DeSantis did not ban the hydroxychloroquine.
[2:05:15.000 --> 2:05:22.200]  And when we got to New York, you know, I realized that Cuomo did. And we had saved every single
[2:05:22.200 --> 2:05:27.240]  one of our patients. So when they weren't using alternative treatments, and the protocol that
[2:05:27.240 --> 2:05:30.920]  they were using was ventilators, knowing it was killing every single patient, that was another
[2:05:30.920 --> 2:05:34.920]  red flag. Why are they banning treatments? Since when did the government get in between the
[2:05:34.920 --> 2:05:39.560]  doctor-patient relationship that's unheard of? And it actually should never happen again.
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:44.440]  The hospitals were all liability free. So regardless of what a doctor, a nurse, any part
[2:05:44.440 --> 2:05:48.680]  the staff members did, they would never be liable. And they took advantage of that. They took
[2:05:48.680 --> 2:05:54.360]  advantage of a system that wasn't going to hold them liable. And, you know, there was financial
[2:05:54.360 --> 2:06:03.800]  incentive to stay quiet. So I was there, gosh, not even a week. And I was just devastated.
[2:06:03.800 --> 2:06:09.400]  And I contacted attorneys that I knew in New York. And I'm like, I need to do something,
[2:06:09.400 --> 2:06:13.480]  because there were nurses that were speaking out before me, and no one believed them.
[2:06:13.480 --> 2:06:17.560]  You know, so I needed the actual proof. And, you know, it wouldn't be the first time I've
[2:06:17.560 --> 2:06:23.240]  been undercover. I was undercover, you know, in Iraq too. So maybe that's what kind of motivated
[2:06:23.240 --> 2:06:29.320]  me to not be afraid to be able to expose this corruption. And, you know, ultimately,
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:38.120]  a lot of these patients, the majority of these patients died unnecessarily. And their families
[2:06:38.120 --> 2:06:44.200]  deserve to know the truth, and these patients deserve justice. And so that's kind of fine.
[2:06:44.200 --> 2:06:47.400]  And that's huge. And we've got time to take your time to go through that, because you did a great
[2:06:47.400 --> 2:06:53.400]  job on Tucker Carlson and other platforms, but those were short interviews, walk through them, what
[2:06:53.400 --> 2:06:57.640]  it was like, and how you were quantifying that they were killing people. Because you show where
[2:06:57.640 --> 2:07:02.200]  someone doesn't have COVID, but still they intubate them. And then days later, a healthy person is dead.
[2:07:02.200 --> 2:07:07.400]  I mean, and of course, even us today admits, if they intubate somebody, they would get all this
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:15.320]  extra money. Well, let's just say that you walk in and this happened a lot. I mean, even today,
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:19.720]  it's happening. And people have a lot of anxiety. They're terrified of this virus that the media
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:24.760]  is instilling like this fear. And they're coming in like, oh, my gosh, I'm having difficulty breathing.
[2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:30.600]  What do I do? And in Florida, we would say, you know, you're all right, we would test them for
[2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:36.520]  the flu first, rule out other things. That's what you're supposed to do. Not in New York. So if you
[2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:41.800]  walk through the emergency room in New York, you're going to be a COVID quote, rule out. And they
[2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:47.800]  would give you, you know, the test, send it out five to 10 days later, you would get the results.
[2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:53.880]  In the meantime, you were, you know, shuttled off to a COVID floor. And by the time the results
[2:07:53.880 --> 2:07:57.960]  came back, most of these patients would have already been ventilated, possibly dead at that point.
[2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:04.120]  And, you know, ultimately, you know, there was no accountability. And even if you said anything,
[2:08:04.120 --> 2:08:08.760]  which I tried to go up my chain of command, and everybody told me to hush, or I would go home.
[2:08:08.760 --> 2:08:15.000]  And they did send quite a few nurses home. Ultimately, I was sent home as well. But there
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:21.160]  were patients, a full code is when you want to be saved, your family wants you to be saved,
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:27.480]  nurses and doctors will perform CPR as long as it takes to save you. That was not happening.
[2:08:27.480 --> 2:08:33.320]  There were doctors that were writing patients off as dead with the time of death paperwork done
[2:08:33.320 --> 2:08:38.760]  before they were even dead. And then telling us nurses, don't code them, they're going to die
[2:08:38.760 --> 2:08:49.400]  anyway. That's just the most unethical malpractice type of situation that any nurse or any medical
[2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:54.760]  professional should ever have to be in. But they felt like in those certain hospitals that had
[2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:59.880]  almost all the deaths, they were allowed to then you've got them sending sick patients to nursing
[2:08:59.880 --> 2:09:04.200]  homes, but not letting family go in, and then innovating them there and also getting high
[2:09:04.200 --> 2:09:09.000]  death numbers up to half the deaths in New York. I mean, this looks like a very organized operation.
[2:09:10.680 --> 2:09:15.800]  Well, it was, you know, the orders were coming down from Cuomo, essentially,
[2:09:15.800 --> 2:09:20.360]  and they were going to the administrators. The administrators, they all knew what was
[2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:26.120]  going on. And that's why they would threaten us so hard that if we said anything, we would
[2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:30.680]  immediately go home. You know, we were all on gag orders. Why? You know, in this financial.
[2:09:30.680 --> 2:09:34.200]  All of this is so huge. Stare at her back in a few minutes. Simply amazing. One of the main
[2:09:34.200 --> 2:09:38.840]  whistleblower nurses videoed it all, documented it all. She's here explaining most of the nurses
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:43.400]  were like, this is BS. They were sent home. So they bring in people statistically and build an
[2:09:43.400 --> 2:09:49.240]  army of folks that will do anything. You must guard your humanity. You must guard your children's
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:54.680]  humanity. You must guard the very genetic code of the planet. The globalists have themselves
[2:09:54.680 --> 2:09:59.960]  up as the guardians of this world. But they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system
[2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:06.440]  and poison the planet. They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:13.240]  on earth to the GMO crops. And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity with the mRNA
[2:10:13.240 --> 2:10:20.600]  vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses,
[2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:28.920]  where they inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems. Go read the actual inserts
[2:10:29.800 --> 2:10:36.120]  for the mRNA vaccines. And then remember you've been warned. This is the equivalent of an alien
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:40.680]  takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting
[2:10:40.680 --> 2:10:44.520]  like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us. It's all the same in the end.
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:51.960]  The U.S. Postal Service tells InfoWars that as long as you get your order in by December 18th,
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:55.560]  we're able to ship it out. By that day, you will get it anywhere in the United States
[2:10:55.560 --> 2:11:00.680]  before Christmas. But listen, don't wait. Do your shopping at infowarstore.com. Get great
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:05.880]  products and fund the InfoWars. Now, the most critical time, not just at InfoWars history,
[2:11:05.880 --> 2:11:10.920]  but this country's history. You have invested in InfoWars. You've prayed for us. You've spread
[2:11:10.920 --> 2:11:15.720]  the word. You've bought the products. And you've gotten the benefits of the information warfare,
[2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:21.160]  of the truth, in the fight against the globalist. But now is the time to redouble all our efforts
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:24.520]  in praying for a great awakening, which is starting to happen, and spreading the word about
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:32.200]  infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video. And at the very same time, buying amazing products
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:36.760]  at infowarstore.com. They have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year, certainly
[2:11:36.760 --> 2:11:41.640]  on some items, the biggest sales of the year on new pharmaceuticals, you name it, at infowarstore.com.
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:44.440]  So thanks for your support. Get those orders in and God bless.
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:50.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:50.440 --> 2:11:52.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:27.240]  Undercover epicenter nurse, how fraud, negligence, and greed led to unnecessary deaths at Elmhurst
[2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:35.800]  Hospital. And boy, she lays it all out. So please continue with what you're laying out,
[2:12:35.800 --> 2:12:40.680]  how long you were there, the aftermath of it, and what's in your book, and what you expect to see
[2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:47.640]  obviously now with this winter, when they have more flu, more pneumonia, they're obviously
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:51.560]  going to try to attribute all that to COVID. They said that the lockdown has to go on forever.
[2:12:51.560 --> 2:12:56.040]  They don't want people to know about nutraceuticals or about supplements or about vitamin D.
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:00.040]  And give us your big picture of what you think's really going on here and what we should all do
[2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:10.360]  to stop it. A lot's going on. Yes, that's one thing that they banned is any alternative treatments.
[2:13:12.440 --> 2:13:17.560]  They didn't talk about the high dose IV vitamin C. They didn't talk about the hydroxychloric
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:26.280]  when course it's in vitamin D, vitamin C. A lot of these things that people really need to know
[2:13:26.280 --> 2:13:34.680]  is everything that they're not talking about. And for a virus with a 99 at this 0.9 percent
[2:13:34.680 --> 2:13:42.760]  survival rate, we don't need a vaccine. And the vaccine is very dangerous. And ultimately,
[2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:47.960]  I think that this has been about control. I think that this has been about the election.
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:58.840]  And I think that this is about honestly the new world order. They want puppets. And they don't
[2:13:58.840 --> 2:14:06.680]  want anybody like myself or any of other whistleblowers to be telling the people the truth.
[2:14:06.680 --> 2:14:12.840]  And ultimately, if we want to secure a safe future for our children and future generations,
[2:14:12.840 --> 2:14:19.560]  a lot more people need to stand up and speak up and tell the truth. Because this is about
[2:14:19.560 --> 2:14:25.960]  humanity at the end of the day. And we need to be able to save lives and get the truth to the people.
[2:14:27.000 --> 2:14:33.160]  What was it like for you as a whistleblower? Not at the very start, but I'd say the first
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:37.800]  I'd say the first third of people really speaking out to then watch all these prominent scientists
[2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:42.600]  and doctors and nurses, including yourself, being censored by big tech. I mean, since when do
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:46.680]  consumer reviews get blocked? Since when can medical professionals not have their speech?
[2:14:46.680 --> 2:14:53.800]  This is so dangerous. No, it's extremely dangerous. And all these people that you're seeing,
[2:14:55.640 --> 2:15:01.960]  these medical experts, Fauci being one, these guys never had boots on the ground. These guys
[2:15:01.960 --> 2:15:08.040]  never actually treated any of these patients. These guys were not in there. I was, we were the
[2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:13.640]  ones with boots on the ground. And for anybody like me, that was actually there. And that's
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:23.560]  actually telling them what they really did in order to create this mass genocide. We're hushed,
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:29.080]  we're censored. I've been fired. I was fired in New York. I was fired from my job here in Florida,
[2:15:29.080 --> 2:15:32.840]  because they don't want people like me inside their hospital walls, because we're going to
[2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:38.040]  tell the truth. They kicked all the family members out. It's a free for all in these
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:43.960]  hospitals right now. And since my expo day came out, I've had so many people from around the
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:51.160]  world contact me and ask, how can I get in to see my loved one? They're doing this and this and this.
[2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:58.760]  They refuse any of the alternative treatments. They're killing them. And it's hard. It is
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:05.880]  really, it's really hard to be able to advocate and be a nurse in this time in history right now.
[2:16:06.920 --> 2:16:10.680]  Well, it seems like a total power grab where we can let COVID patients into the nursing home,
[2:16:10.680 --> 2:16:15.880]  but you can't see your mom or dad for six, eight months. It's such a control thing that all over
[2:16:15.880 --> 2:16:21.560]  the world now, you can't see your family members, but then they can do whatever they want behind
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:28.200]  closed doors. Sounds like a recipe for major abuse. Well, and why aren't they talking about
[2:16:28.200 --> 2:16:34.280]  the increase in suicide, the increase in depression? All of these other things that are
[2:16:34.280 --> 2:16:40.360]  happening outside, they're just not discussing. Everything is COVID. There's no flu anymore.
[2:16:42.280 --> 2:16:53.000]  There's no other diseases or illnesses right now. It's just all COVID. And that has to
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:17:00.120]  send a red flag to people. And I hope it does wake up a whole lot more people to
[2:17:00.120 --> 2:17:06.600]  kind of start asking questions. Because ultimately, we need to be inquisitive. We need to demand the
[2:17:06.600 --> 2:17:12.760]  truth. And it's just something that the media isn't giving the people. And these photos that
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:18.680]  you're sharing right now, it's just heartbreaking. And how are we ever going to dig ourselves out
[2:17:18.680 --> 2:17:27.000]  of this and kind of fight this new normal that they're trying to push on everybody?
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:32.440]  There's nothing normal about this. And it's the way they script it all, like teaching the kids all
[2:17:32.440 --> 2:17:37.000]  this weird bizarreness that you can't hold each other or love each other. Everything's like a cult.
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:42.600]  You can't see grandma now. This is Milgram experiment, Stanford research experiment. This is
[2:17:42.600 --> 2:17:45.880]  real mind control. Then you read Klaus Schwab. I don't know if you've seen that,
[2:17:45.880 --> 2:17:50.280]  the Davos group admitting COVID is not a threat. This is the rollout of our global corporate
[2:17:50.280 --> 2:17:58.840]  takeover and our global ID. No, you're exactly right. And there are more and more medical
[2:17:58.840 --> 2:18:03.480]  professionals speaking up about this. And eventually, there's going to be too many of us
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:09.000]  to ignore. And I hope that that's the case. And I'm going to continue the fight. And there's
[2:18:09.720 --> 2:18:15.640]  other doctors and nurses that are stepping up and saying, you know what, enough is enough.
[2:18:15.640 --> 2:18:21.720]  We can't lie anymore. And if go ahead and take our license, because I don't honestly want to
[2:18:21.720 --> 2:18:25.960]  be a part of this system if this is how it's going to be. I'd rather be on the outside and
[2:18:25.960 --> 2:18:36.840]  helping people try to avoid whatever it is that they're trying to do to just innocent people
[2:18:36.840 --> 2:18:42.440]  right now. Well, I was really impressed with the videos you shot and what you did. We'll show
[2:18:42.440 --> 2:18:46.680]  those next segment. And the fact that what you said has been proven out was going on.
[2:18:46.680 --> 2:18:51.480]  And we did see some reform up front because of you and other whistleblowers. But now I see the
[2:18:51.480 --> 2:18:56.520]  same, as you said, murderous out of control tactics coming back in this winter.
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:04.120]  Yeah, well, we already knew that a second wave was coming. And that's kind of why I needed to get
[2:19:04.120 --> 2:19:09.720]  that expose out. I needed to get the book out. Like, knowledge is power. And people need to know
[2:19:09.720 --> 2:19:15.480]  what to do right now in order to fight back. First things first, family members need to be
[2:19:15.480 --> 2:19:21.400]  allowed in these hospital rooms. And if that's not allowed, you know, if masks honestly work,
[2:19:21.400 --> 2:19:27.640]  which they don't, there's no science to back that up, then let the family members put on a mask
[2:19:27.640 --> 2:19:30.840]  and go visit their loved ones and be able to advocate for them. Because that's where a lot of
[2:19:30.840 --> 2:19:36.120]  things go wrong. You know, even on good days in hospitals, it's very bad. And it's been bad for
[2:19:36.120 --> 2:19:42.680]  really, really long time. And I think this may be kind of the catalyst to change and, you know,
[2:19:42.680 --> 2:19:51.080]  a reform in ethics and, you know, be able to advocate for your loved ones and have a backup
[2:19:51.080 --> 2:19:56.520]  if that's not possible, maybe in the form of, you know, nurses like myself to be able to go
[2:19:56.520 --> 2:20:00.600]  in there. If you needed a degree in order to go into these hospitals, then so be it.
[2:20:00.600 --> 2:20:06.760]  Well, we need prosecution of Bill Gates and the UN and these big corporations rolling out
[2:20:06.760 --> 2:20:10.760]  their forced inoculations. But we come back, you've already alluded to this and shot to prove
[2:20:10.760 --> 2:20:16.120]  when you say they were murdering people, we're going to lay that out with nurse Erin Marie
[2:20:16.120 --> 2:20:23.080]  on the other side at nurse Erin with two E's and we'll tell you other places to find her book,
[2:20:23.080 --> 2:20:27.480]  which I know they've been trying to block. But this is so important listeners, I know you know
[2:20:27.480 --> 2:20:32.840]  this stuff, or you know most of it, but your friends and neighbors and family don't. So I would
[2:20:32.840 --> 2:20:37.000]  suggest you all get copies of this and give it to your local hospitals, because that will trigger
[2:20:37.000 --> 2:20:41.720]  a major debate that's already happening inside. We've got to expose this. This is high tech work.
[2:20:43.400 --> 2:20:46.760]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:52.840]  Other dictionaries have similar ones. Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out
[2:20:52.840 --> 2:20:59.800]  force for a political or financial reason. It's basically scaring the hell out of people
[2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:05.320]  until you submit to them. That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is. You see the
[2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:10.760]  headlines from CNN, ABC News, doctors say it's worse than they ever thought. COVID more devastating
[2:21:10.760 --> 2:21:16.440]  they could ever imagine. They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight
[2:21:16.440 --> 2:21:22.920]  months ago, within three months. It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died
[2:21:22.920 --> 2:21:28.440]  of other things. We're talking 96% at co-morbidity. These are real numbers. These are real facts.
[2:21:28.440 --> 2:21:33.000]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not
[2:21:33.000 --> 2:21:38.280]  essential. All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet. Rebuke it, stand up against it.
[2:21:38.280 --> 2:21:44.440]  This is slavery. It is not something you can put up with and survive. Hey Steve, how you doing?
[2:21:44.440 --> 2:21:51.880]  Hey Alex, oh my god. Long time listener, first time caller. Look, in January 2016, I went in a
[2:21:51.880 --> 2:21:57.000]  hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June and I kept hearing
[2:21:57.000 --> 2:22:01.560]  Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense. Let me tell you something, man. I had
[2:22:01.560 --> 2:22:07.000]  an internal digestive problem and I stuck with it for about five or six years and the doctors,
[2:22:07.000 --> 2:22:11.960]  they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day when I kept hearing
[2:22:11.960 --> 2:22:15.640]  you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what? I'm going to get me some of that
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:19.000]  freaking living defense. Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want
[2:22:19.000 --> 2:22:24.200]  you to have it, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started
[2:22:24.200 --> 2:22:29.640]  taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. If there's any veteran out there,
[2:22:29.640 --> 2:22:34.840]  I don't care if you've traveled though, anybody's traveled overseas. You absolutely owe it to yourself
[2:22:34.840 --> 2:22:40.520]  to get two bottles of that living defense. It's true folks. We don't sell anything unless it's
[2:22:40.520 --> 2:22:45.880]  the highest quality and living defense is over the top good. Fox has betrayed President Trump as I
[2:22:45.880 --> 2:22:51.240]  predicted they would. They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:57.000]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th,
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:01.240]  the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic. They are going to
[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:05.800]  explode gas prices. They're going to shut down our coal power plants. They're going to cut off the
[2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:10.920]  energy source to the U.S. So it's impossible for factories to move back here. This is economic
[2:23:10.920 --> 2:23:15.720]  domination. This is economic war. We are being consolidated. We are being taken over. The democrats
[2:23:15.720 --> 2:23:21.160]  aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states. They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt
[2:23:21.160 --> 2:23:25.880]  the population and bring them absolutely to heal and then consolidate ownership of all the
[2:23:25.880 --> 2:23:31.400]  infrastructure and property. This is a monopolistic takeover. That's what the great reset is.
[2:23:31.400 --> 2:23:36.200]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it. That's what social distancing is. So your business
[2:23:36.200 --> 2:23:42.040]  is only a 25 percent for several more years. No small businesses will be there. This is a master
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:49.640]  plan. Say no. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:49.640 --> 2:24:06.760]  Defending the republic from enemies, foreign and domestic. It's Alex Jones.
[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:15.000]  There's Erin Marie Olszewski is our guest. I'm Alex Jones, your host. And I've studied this a lot
[2:24:15.000 --> 2:24:19.880]  more than I want to. I'm telling what she's saying is dead on. I've had medical doctors on, scientists
[2:24:19.880 --> 2:24:25.720]  on. The vast majority come out and say this is a total fraud. It's a scam. And then they try to fire
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:30.760]  medical doctors that run major hospitals for saying what she's saying right now. But as you heard her
[2:24:30.760 --> 2:24:35.720]  say, more and more of the doctors and nurses are refusing to be part of this fraud. People need to
[2:24:35.720 --> 2:24:41.480]  read your book. This is life and death. Where's the best place for folks to get your newly published
[2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:48.840]  book, the undercover epicenter nurse? You can get it on any, you know, online store, Amazon,
[2:24:49.640 --> 2:24:55.720]  Barnes and Noble. I have a personal signed copy link in the link that I gave you. It's the link
[2:24:55.720 --> 2:25:03.480]  tree at Nurse Erin. And then, yeah, it's not out in retail stores yet because they just don't want
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:08.520]  to carry it. Well, obviously, we need to override them and get that out there. And you've also paid
[2:25:08.520 --> 2:25:13.640]  a lot getting fired for telling the truth. Again, give us that URL for radio clusters. We're not
[2:25:13.640 --> 2:25:21.000]  just TV. Give them audibly where they can find the book to support you. If you go to my Instagram
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:27.320]  at Nurt, it's at Erin underscore BSN. There's a link in my bio for a signed copy. So that would
[2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:31.960]  be need to get the signed copy. They need to give it to friends and family because again,
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:36.360]  I sit there and I talk to people and I go, Hey, they just found HIV insertions
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:42.120]  in the vaccine. Oh, you're a liar. Then I show them the end in study. They go, Oh, wow. Then I
[2:25:42.120 --> 2:25:46.520]  show them sitting morning Herald. They just stopped the vaccine all over Australia because they were
[2:25:46.520 --> 2:25:52.360]  doing HIV positive tests. Well, I'm not a doctor. I had scientists on 10 months ago. They predicted
[2:25:52.360 --> 2:25:56.360]  that if somebody really made a vaccine for this, it would give you HIV positive because part of the
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:01.640]  this COVID thing is HIV. We'll talk about that. Come up a few minutes of the vaccines and your
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:08.280]  view on that. Let's get into the death here. Let's talk about that. Let's go ahead and play this
[2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:12.440]  clip. Number one, this is footage you valiantly shot because you can a lot of trouble for this
[2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:16.840]  folks, but you know, she was showing a crime. So she's covered a nurse Aaron shows how people
[2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:22.120]  were repeatedly tested negative or tested over and over again to say they have COVID to code them
[2:26:22.680 --> 2:26:26.760]  while they intubate them to get that money. Here it is. The people who had repeatedly
[2:26:26.760 --> 2:26:32.760]  tested negative for COVID were being described as COVID confirmed. Okay. So if you look close,
[2:26:32.760 --> 2:26:39.160]  I'm in my patients chart. I am pulling up like their laboratory results. So if you look here,
[2:26:39.160 --> 2:26:47.320]  you'll see COVID-19 bio reference lab. Here are the test results. As you can see,
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:59.320]  51220 at 1716 not detected. They test for a second time. 54220 at 1759 not detected.
[2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:05.640]  So both of those are negative. Scroll up to the top. This is my patient.
[2:27:06.920 --> 2:27:14.600]  They are on event and they are being called COVID-19 confirmed droplet in contact
[2:27:14.600 --> 2:27:20.680]  eye and eye protection. So this person is droplet and I
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:32.440]  COVID confirmed. Has a click not detected. No results in lab available.
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:42.600]  Pretty good. While Aaron was using her hidden camera to document another chart showing a
[2:27:42.600 --> 2:27:47.720]  patient with negative test results who nonetheless was labeled COVID confirmed,
[2:27:47.720 --> 2:27:52.680]  another travel nurse entered the room. They began to discuss what Aaron was seeing.
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:28:03.240]  So not detected here, but it's presumptive. Now they're all, they are detected. They're saying
[2:28:03.240 --> 2:28:09.720]  it's positive. Not detected. But it's not detected. You said that they were vented
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:15.960]  immediately upon being brought in. Is that? Yeah. So the thing is, is they're coming in with
[2:28:15.960 --> 2:28:20.920]  difficulty breathing. And a lot of these patients are really coming in with anxiety
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:27.080]  because everybody is, they're scared. And I know in other clips you show where the guy's healthy,
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:30.440]  they intubate him and he's dead a couple of days later. Absolutely insane. Again,
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:36.200]  watching this, this, this is real world. I would expect the FBI to be SWAT teaming
[2:28:36.200 --> 2:28:39.560]  and getting all the evidence. But of course it doesn't happen, but then in Michigan,
[2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:45.240]  where medical doctors were giving folks preventatively IV vitamin C, which studies show
[2:28:45.240 --> 2:28:50.520]  is basically bulletproof, they got SWAT team. So giving people vitamin C, you get SWAT team,
[2:28:50.520 --> 2:28:53.160]  killing them with ventilation when they don't need it. That's good.
[2:28:55.000 --> 2:29:01.080]  It's insanity. It's literally what was happening there is the definition of insanity, like
[2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:06.280]  doing the same thing over and over and over and expecting different results. Although I don't
[2:29:06.280 --> 2:29:10.760]  think that they ever expected different results. I think that the results that were happening
[2:29:11.640 --> 2:29:17.720]  with 100% death rate is exactly what they wanted. They wanted the numbers up. They wanted to create
[2:29:17.720 --> 2:29:24.840]  this mass hysteria pandemic. And ultimately, they wanted to be right. How did Cuomo Nota
[2:29:24.840 --> 2:29:31.960]  order 30,000 vents in March? When there was doctors that came out, Dr. Cameron Kyle Sadell said in
[2:29:31.960 --> 2:29:37.080]  March, it's the wrong treatment protocol. They didn't care. They continued to do it. They didn't
[2:29:37.080 --> 2:29:43.400]  hire enough people to run these ventilators. There was residents that had never had experience
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:48.840]  with hands on with their patients running the floors. There were so many times I had to lock
[2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:54.680]  my IV pump so they wouldn't come in and change it and kill my patients. It was terrifying.
[2:29:54.680 --> 2:30:00.920]  Ultimately, it was one big experiment for a lot of these student doctors. They were
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:11.400]  performing invasive tests and things that on these patients and these patients were essentially
[2:30:11.400 --> 2:30:15.640]  in a medically induced coma. I had no idea what was going on and they treated them like
[2:30:16.840 --> 2:30:21.000]  they weren't even human beings. Well, you said earlier, keep going, please.
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:26.360]  These nurses, they're like, oh, the person's alive. Just say they're dead. We're killing them,
[2:30:26.360 --> 2:30:34.680]  basically. I mean, this is crazy. Yeah. And I have that recorded. The doctor literally is telling
[2:30:34.680 --> 2:30:41.640]  all of us nurses to, he was essentially playing God and he was called out for playing God.
[2:30:41.640 --> 2:30:49.640]  You're not God. And he said, well, I am. Let's start over there because this sounds like Joseph
[2:30:49.640 --> 2:30:55.640]  Mengele's Nazi type stuff. This hospital has the highest death rate in the country, at least it did
[2:30:55.640 --> 2:31:00.200]  then. The epicenter, they hired you to come in there. You blew the whistle. Others did.
[2:31:01.080 --> 2:31:04.920]  So again, the good news is most hospitals, doctors and nurses are good. They help the people and
[2:31:04.920 --> 2:31:08.920]  don't go along with the protocol. But Gates and the UN are trying to get a set protocol where
[2:31:08.920 --> 2:31:13.480]  doctors won't have a choice. This is really scary. So they will turn doctors into executioners.
[2:31:13.480 --> 2:31:21.800]  Yeah. And if they don't follow their orders, this was a bunch of order followers ultimately.
[2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:25.960]  And if they don't follow the orders, they're going to be fired and they'll likely lose their
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:32.120]  license. If they do the right thing, they will lose their license. I did the right thing.
[2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:37.960]  Nurses, doctors, we're all mandatory reporters. It's our oath. That's what we sign up. We are
[2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:42.360]  ultimately for the patient. We are for nobody else. We are there to protect the patient.
[2:31:42.360 --> 2:31:47.800]  And it's so backwards, society is so backwards that if you're a nurse or a doctor trying to save
[2:31:47.800 --> 2:31:54.120]  your patient's lives and being like, listen, we were doing it wrong, we need to change this,
[2:31:54.120 --> 2:32:03.800]  you're fired. I comprehend that this is the United States of America, a country that is supposed
[2:32:03.800 --> 2:32:07.960]  to be one of the best countries in the world. And we are not studying a good example.
[2:32:07.960 --> 2:32:12.840]  Well, the serial killer had grabbed little kids or a woman and was putting tubes down their throat
[2:32:12.840 --> 2:32:16.760]  and killing them by Jeffrey Dahmer did with acid. Then it'd be a horror story to be terrible.
[2:32:16.760 --> 2:32:21.640]  But if it's the doctors and it's Fauci and it's the governor Cuomo. And as you said,
[2:32:21.640 --> 2:32:29.400]  it was also premeditated. This is like a giant, just exercise of power by these psychos.
[2:32:30.840 --> 2:32:36.280]  Yeah. And you know, it wasn't just in New York. It was the majority of democratic run states
[2:32:36.280 --> 2:32:40.760]  that banned alternative treatments that banned the hydroxychloroquine and zinc protocol. It
[2:32:40.760 --> 2:32:46.360]  bans, you know, exactly. It was all unified. Let's talk about it. It was California, Michigan,
[2:32:46.360 --> 2:32:51.960]  Pennsylvania, New York. There was a few others, but yeah, they all did it in unison.
[2:32:53.080 --> 2:33:01.720]  Yeah. And the thing is, and here's another point. They targeted low income minority
[2:33:01.720 --> 2:33:08.200]  populations. They targeted the poor, the hospitals that served the poor under privileged areas.
[2:33:08.840 --> 2:33:15.800]  And if you look around, you will see that every single hospital that was super hard hit,
[2:33:15.800 --> 2:33:22.040]  served minorities, served the majority Medicare, Medicaid patients. And that's why we got what
[2:33:22.040 --> 2:33:26.520]  double the number of blacks versus whites. Stay there. This is the key because now they want
[2:33:26.520 --> 2:33:32.200]  the vaccine just for blacks first. This is very obvious what's going on, bringing homeless in,
[2:33:32.200 --> 2:33:35.800]  putting the tube down their throat and killing them. We've got an amazing nurse whistleblower
[2:33:35.800 --> 2:33:39.880]  who's been totally vindicated. Nurse Aaron's our guest. Stay with us.
[2:33:47.320 --> 2:33:52.360]  It's been said that you should strike while the iron is hot. Well, info wars is white hot
[2:33:52.360 --> 2:33:57.880]  right now. World government, globalist forces, trying to take over the United States is mainstream
[2:33:57.880 --> 2:34:03.800]  news. And info wars credibility has gone through the roof. That's why now is the time to contact
[2:34:03.800 --> 2:34:08.600]  local radio, TV and cable stations. If you don't have an affiliate in your area already,
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:13.880]  and to send them to info wars.com forward slash affiliates and say pick up Alex Jones,
[2:34:13.880 --> 2:34:18.680]  pick up I'll destroyer, pick up David Knight, pick up for other great programs. They're free to air.
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:22.520]  If you're on TV or you're on cable, you can cover up all the commercials for yourself.
[2:34:22.520 --> 2:34:27.560]  No contracts needed. This is your authorization stations. Pick up the info wars feed right now.
[2:34:27.560 --> 2:34:33.160]  All the affiliates, the satellites, it's all linked at info wars.com forward slash affiliates.
[2:34:33.160 --> 2:34:38.360]  Go to the local stations, call them, email them and send them the link to info wars.com forward
[2:34:38.360 --> 2:34:43.160]  slash affiliate and tell them we're free to air. No contracts. Just pick us up. The Pope came out
[2:34:43.160 --> 2:34:47.960]  yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth,
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:52.280]  create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and Global
[2:34:52.280 --> 2:34:56.360]  Corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[2:34:56.360 --> 2:35:03.640]  It's all now completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos Group and Cloud Schwab.
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:07.800]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation,
[2:35:07.800 --> 2:35:13.000]  all the rest of them, at 10 to 21, at 20 to 30, it's here and only gets worse like being fed
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:20.040]  into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all. And the rejection starts with
[2:35:20.040 --> 2:35:25.240]  realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil and stopping abortion. We must start
[2:35:25.240 --> 2:35:30.760]  valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not
[2:35:30.760 --> 2:35:37.640]  disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that, we are all slaves. We must stand up and
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:46.280]  declare our basic God given human rights now. Just in time for Christmas, a lot of our best
[2:35:46.280 --> 2:35:52.040]  selling products are back in stock. The privacy pockets are back in stock and massively discounted
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:58.040]  in 1995. A great stock and stuff for a great gift. Alpha Power sold out for a year because of the
[2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:02.920]  lockdown. A lot of the key patent ingredients weren't available. It is now back in stock.

[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:19.240]  All right. Nurse Erin Marie Olsinski is our guest. And man, I'm talking her during the break. I'm
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:23.000]  like, what's the next fight? What do we need to do? And she's like, I'm launching a huge nurses
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:28.520]  conference in Florida on January 9th. I think she said, and I've got a book out. I mean, she is
[2:38:28.520 --> 2:38:35.400]  kicking ass, a great American patriot, a veteran. This is what we need. So many doctors, so many
[2:38:35.400 --> 2:38:40.440]  epidemiologists, so many scientists have spoken out, shown the facts, the former chief science
[2:38:40.440 --> 2:38:47.240]  officer at Merck's come out saying it's all a big hoax fraud. It's crazy that like there's almost
[2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:52.600]  no one on their side, but the American Bar Association, the lawyers say that we should
[2:38:52.600 --> 2:38:57.400]  stay locked down. The lawyers say we should all take force inoculations. It's a huge power grab.
[2:38:57.400 --> 2:39:03.400]  So in the 10 minutes we have left, tell folks about solutions, ideas, and then other areas we
[2:39:03.400 --> 2:39:10.600]  haven't had on. Well, as you pointed out, I'm going to have, it's the global frontline nurses
[2:39:10.600 --> 2:39:19.560]  summit. It's going to be in the Tampa Bay area on January 9th of 2021. Hopefully it will be a
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:28.040]  better year, but there's nurses that are coming from all over the world, and these nurses are all
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:33.480]  seeing, we're all on the same page. We all see the same thing. We all know that it has been a mass
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:38.920]  genocide of patients, and we're going to talk about it. And if nurses are the most trusted
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:45.080]  profession in the United States, and I think around the world, then I hope that people will
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:50.840]  be open to hearing from us because honestly, at the end of the day, we have everything to lose.
[2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:57.480]  Some of us have, I have everything, but in nothing to gain, except to stand on the right
[2:39:57.480 --> 2:40:03.160]  side of history and to make sure that history never repeats itself and to stop the corruption
[2:40:03.160 --> 2:40:11.560]  before it gets any worse. And once they take away our freedoms that are God given right
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:17.480]  as human beings, it is going to be next to impossible to ever get them back. So that's why I am
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:25.720]  fighting with every inch of my being. It's in my blood. I served our country. I love our country,
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:31.160]  and there's really nothing that is going to get in my way, and even though there's been a whole
[2:40:31.160 --> 2:40:36.040]  lot of people that try to stop me from doing it. So let me guess, you blow the whistle,
[2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:40.280]  they hadn't fired you and censored you. You'd done your duty to expose it. You still speak out,
[2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:45.080]  but them trying to suppress you, has that really given you a second wind or really supercharged
[2:40:45.080 --> 2:40:50.680]  and now really fight back? I mean, all the information they censor is exactly what the
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:59.480]  people need to know. So if anything, even bad news is good news. So listen to what they're
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:08.920]  trying to censor from people that have no reason to lie. And yeah, yes, it does give me more
[2:41:08.920 --> 2:41:16.200]  mid motivation and it does light a fire that I'm not willing to put out. So yeah.
[2:41:16.200 --> 2:41:20.200]  Where do you predict this goes? So they're able to weasel Biden in there. He says he's going to
[2:41:20.200 --> 2:41:25.880]  intensify it all. It makes them so unpopular. It creates depression. Why do you think they just
[2:41:25.880 --> 2:41:32.520]  are so obsessed with this? Control. You know, I mean, Biden doesn't even know what he's doing.
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:40.760]  You know, he's just one of the, you know, he he's a pawn in a much bigger sinister plan.
[2:41:41.480 --> 2:41:48.680]  And that is why we need to fight, you know, and ultimately, if Biden does get into office,
[2:41:48.680 --> 2:41:55.240]  which he won't, you know, we're going to see a country that we don't recognize. We're going to be
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:42:02.200]  masked up. We're going to be mass vaccinated. We're going to have absolutely no control over
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:07.080]  our bodies or the bodies of our children. We're going to, you know, essentially be living in
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:12.440]  a communist country that that would be absolutely terrifying.
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:18.120]  A communist country that uses medical tyranny as its excuse and cover for enforcement of
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:24.040]  surveillance and political oppression. Getting into vaccines. I know you're a nurse. You've
[2:42:24.040 --> 2:42:29.480]  looked at that. These aren't even classic vaccines. These MRNA systems. I know you know that.
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:33.880]  And now the fact that they were trying to give it to kids in England that made them six and now
[2:42:33.880 --> 2:42:38.440]  they say, don't give it to under 16. Don't give it to people that have autoimmune problems.
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:43.080]  They suspended the vaccine in Australia because it was doing false positive HIV.
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:48.280]  What is your thought and your other medical colleagues thought on this real push for forced
[2:42:48.280 --> 2:42:55.800]  immoculation? I've been awake to the vaccine racket for a really long time. Actually, my son
[2:42:55.800 --> 2:43:01.240]  at 12 months, I have three boys. My middle son at 12 months was severely injured. And that's when
[2:43:01.240 --> 2:43:08.840]  I kind of dive deep into the fact that vaccines in general are liability free. So you can't see
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:13.240]  the manufacturer. And you know, it kind of goes hand in hand with what happened to the hospitals.
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:18.440]  The hospitals during this entire COVID pandemic were also liability free. Nothing good comes
[2:43:18.440 --> 2:43:26.040]  from a liability free anything. No entity, no corporation, nothing. And so, you know, in
[2:43:26.040 --> 2:43:35.000]  general, the toxins are bad. But this COVID vaccine is worse because it is an MRNA vaccine.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:42.520]  It is going to permanently change people's DNA. Permanently. This is something that you can't
[2:43:42.520 --> 2:43:49.560]  just detox from. This is going to be permanent. I ultimately believe that this is going to cause
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:55.960]  a mass genocide in our population. It's going to be a very, very bad thing. And I really,
[2:43:55.960 --> 2:44:01.720]  really hope that people open their eyes and honestly like really look into this research.
[2:44:01.720 --> 2:44:07.640]  There's absolutely no reason we need a vaccine for a virus that with a 99.9% survival rate.
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:14.920]  There is nothing else other than the fact that they want population control. They want to control,
[2:44:14.920 --> 2:44:21.240]  you know, the narrative. So it's very dangerous. Well, Nurse Aaron, let me just say this.
[2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:27.240]  I saw you on Tucker Carlson and I saw your original videos. In fact, I sent you to Tucker
[2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:32.680]  Carlson. I talked to Tucker and I sent him the info. And then like an hour later, he goes,
[2:44:32.680 --> 2:44:38.680]  oh yeah, we're getting her on. That's great. But my point is hearing you now in long form is so
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:44.520]  powerful to just as a nurse, as a mother, as a veteran, as a human, it's so strong. It's beautiful.
[2:44:45.080 --> 2:44:48.360]  And obviously you're a beautiful person physically and beautiful spiritually.
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:51.800]  And I know there's so many other great nurses, male and female, that I'm sure you were saying
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:57.960]  you know that are also upset. And I saw the UN last December say at their own UN conference,
[2:44:57.960 --> 2:45:02.920]  their own head of vaccine said, we're hurting people. We don't like this. We want tests. We want
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:07.720]  clear stuff. But we're told by big pharma what to do. Our own front line wants to stop vaccines.
[2:45:07.720 --> 2:45:13.160]  Even the head UN people are saying this is wrong. So it shows the compartmentalization that you're
[2:45:13.160 --> 2:45:18.440]  against it. The doctors are against it. The UN scientists are against it. The UN head envoy
[2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:22.680]  on COVID says don't do lockdowns. They're still doing them. So it's like, who's in control?
[2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:27.240]  Well, it's Bill Gates. What do you have to say about Bill Gates, who really is suddenly we wake
[2:45:27.240 --> 2:45:31.960]  up and he's going to rape us with his vaccines. He's going to keep us locked down. He's going to be
[2:45:32.920 --> 2:45:37.480]  the head of the G8. Horace Johnson says he's going to let him give him orders the next year.
[2:45:37.480 --> 2:45:41.480]  I mean, this is like, if this is even crazier than Alex Jones would come up with what I'm saying.
[2:45:42.280 --> 2:45:47.560]  You know, I honestly feel like it's a twilight zone because we know Bill Gates is neither a
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:56.360]  doctor or a scientist. And you know, I obviously, we do know that he has a lot of money. And we
[2:45:56.360 --> 2:46:04.280]  do know that everything is surrounded around money, money, power, greed. And they don't care
[2:46:04.280 --> 2:46:10.360]  about the average American average, you know, actually, they don't really care about anyone.
[2:46:10.360 --> 2:46:16.760]  And they care about more money and more power and more greed. And they will do it at the
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:21.720]  expense of human life. And they will not feel bad about it. And here's the secret.
[2:46:21.720 --> 2:46:27.960]  Like any secret testing or any big crime, when they get us a sign onto it, they get power over
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:33.320]  the crisis they create. And it becomes what I call too evil to fail in this dystopic system
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:38.840]  they're setting up. They are dystopics. They are creating a dystopia that they manage and control.
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:44.040]  And they need us to go into mass Stockholm syndrome. So he is evoking a psychological response
[2:46:44.600 --> 2:46:50.680]  from us of submitting to something insane. So we'll submit the stuff even more insane later.
[2:46:50.680 --> 2:46:56.120]  We're being inducted into sliver right now. Well, they're creating the problem.
[2:46:57.000 --> 2:47:01.800]  And then they're going to come around and act like they're, you know, we should thank them
[2:47:01.800 --> 2:47:09.160]  for finding a quote solution. You know, it is definitely quite a quite an intense,
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:15.800]  well thought out, sigh up. And sadly, it's working on quite a bit of our population. But
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:24.360]  eventually, hopefully, there's going to be a lot more people standing up and say no. And trying,
[2:47:24.360 --> 2:47:28.200]  you know, hopefully holding a lot of these people accountable and putting a lot of them in prison,
[2:47:28.200 --> 2:47:30.280]  because that's where they ultimately belong.
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:34.680]  Nurse Olszewski, you're 100% right. We need to not just debate the merits. We need to say,
[2:47:34.680 --> 2:47:38.920]  you're going to prison, you valid the Nuremberg Code, you valid the Geneva Convention,
[2:47:38.920 --> 2:47:43.160]  you make money off this, you're a criminal, we hold you responsible. We don't care if you have
[2:47:43.160 --> 2:47:48.360]  the 1986 vaccine act, you are held accountable. You bid off more than you can chew. You knew
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:52.280]  your vaccine fraud was failing at the UN. So you've doubled down with all of this, and you're
[2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:58.440]  not going to succeed. All right. At Nurse Aaron, thank you so much. We really appreciate you.
[2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:03.080]  And please come on the war room. I know you were already on with David Knight before. Great job
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:06.600]  of David Knight. His folks hitting you on. Thank you so much for an amazing hour.
[2:48:07.480 --> 2:48:10.040]  Yeah. Thank you so much for having me. I hope to be back.
[2:48:10.040 --> 2:48:15.160]  You'd love to have you back in studio. Brace for doctors with you. We'll get everybody in here.
[2:48:15.160 --> 2:48:20.360]  All right. All right. Paul Joseph Watson from the UK takes over. I've got five more minutes though
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:24.920]  before he comes on. And then the war room with Owen Shroyer. Man, there's a lot of great souls
[2:48:24.920 --> 2:48:37.080]  out there. That was powerful. Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:42.920]  stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this
[2:48:42.920 --> 2:48:49.240]  degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com.
[2:48:49.240 --> 2:48:55.480]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure,
[2:48:55.480 --> 2:49:00.920]  decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing
[2:49:00.920 --> 2:49:07.240]  reduction in inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:14.040]  suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the
[2:49:14.040 --> 2:49:21.080]  concentration and activity of immune cells. It worked for my family and now I can have a logical
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:27.800]  and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a
[2:49:27.800 --> 2:49:35.960]  friend, family member or yourself at info wars store.com. During our war for independence during
[2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:40.680]  some of the darkest days, Thomas Jefferson, the man credited with writing our Declaration of
[2:49:40.680 --> 2:49:44.680]  Independence of much of our Constitution later said, look, this is not going to be an easy fight.
[2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:50.120]  We're not going to be transported to liberty on a bed of feathers. No, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:49:50.120 --> 2:49:55.720]  we've actually had incredible successes with Donald Trump and Bolsonaro and the liberty movement
[2:49:55.720 --> 2:50:00.600]  worldwide. We're going to have major setbacks, but there is a giant awakening happening. That's
[2:50:00.600 --> 2:50:05.160]  what the globalists have gone ahead and launched their great reset. Global collapse, worldwide
[2:50:05.160 --> 2:50:10.280]  social credit score, tracking app, microchip, force inoculation takeover now, because if they
[2:50:10.280 --> 2:50:14.280]  don't force it now, they're never going to get it. So info wars has never been more critical.

[2:50:32.520 --> 2:50:39.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:54.280]  You found it. The tip of the spear.
[2:50:54.280 --> 2:51:05.560]  There's always a little hesitation until the ships collide and the fires rage.
[2:51:14.760 --> 2:51:17.720]  There it is. Peter Nygaard, Jeffrey Epstein in Canada.
[2:51:17.720 --> 2:51:24.920]  Arrested in Canada on U.S. sex trafficking charges ran a little island down there in the
[2:51:24.920 --> 2:51:33.160]  Bahamas just like Epstein told Obama and Hillary and Biden and all of them can sit there and
[2:51:34.600 --> 2:51:39.960]  play their games will play ours. But oh, there he is with Bill Bill Gates, who constantly hangs out
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:45.880]  with Jeffrey Epstein. And boy, Bill Gates is like, you're about to get on my tail about Epstein.
[2:51:45.880 --> 2:51:51.000]  Boom, major plague lockdown. That'll distract you. No, it just lets us know that you've got
[2:51:51.000 --> 2:51:59.080]  to be dealt with Gates. You and your husband who said Bill Gates's husband said, I'm sorry,
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:05.400]  wife said, we didn't know the economy. Their whole lockdown was designed to devastate the economy.
[2:52:05.400 --> 2:52:09.080]  That's all stack it even get to today. All watch is about to take over.
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:14.760]  Let me just do this right now. Just do this right now.
[2:52:16.600 --> 2:52:19.320]  We'll shoot the audience trillion percent straight here.
[2:52:23.240 --> 2:52:29.160]  When I take the products that top scientists that we've hired and developers have put together,
[2:52:29.160 --> 2:52:37.320]  it's incredible. When I take X2, when I take DNA Force Plus, when I take the fish oil,
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:42.040]  the krill oil, my life is so much better. When I take Prostate Guard, it's incredible.
[2:52:42.040 --> 2:52:47.320]  And I routinely get on the supplements, get healthy, lose weight, get off. Get on the
[2:52:47.320 --> 2:52:53.400]  supplements, lose weight, get off. And so that's why this new year is coming up. I am pledging
[2:52:54.120 --> 2:52:59.640]  that I am going to take all of the Info Wars life products. I'm going to rotate them through
[2:52:59.640 --> 2:53:07.800]  each week. And I'm going to lose 40 pounds by, let's say, April. Very easy for me to do. I
[2:53:07.800 --> 2:53:13.400]  can still eat the same meals. I still didn't eat stuff. But if I don't take the living defense
[2:53:13.400 --> 2:53:17.560]  at the new year to flush myself out, it just came back in and is on sale for percent off.
[2:53:17.560 --> 2:53:21.960]  If I don't take the winter sun, I can get sick and have problems. If I don't take the X2,
[2:53:21.960 --> 2:53:26.280]  the clean iodine, I have problems and X3 is excellent as well. But don't take DNA Force.
[2:53:26.280 --> 2:53:35.000]  It doesn't work. But when I religiously take the products, it is amazing. We sold for a while
[2:53:35.960 --> 2:53:39.480]  and then nobody bought it. So we discontinued it. But I think it was one of the best products we had,
[2:53:39.480 --> 2:53:43.800]  GutFusion. Man, wow, when I was taking that, too, that was amazing. But we discontinued it.
[2:53:43.800 --> 2:53:49.720]  People weren't buying it. But these are all amazing products. Yeah, other people don't
[2:53:49.720 --> 2:53:52.840]  plug a product on there that's discontinued. I'm just saying, I think I'm bringing it back.
[2:53:52.840 --> 2:53:57.240]  I don't care if people never figured out how bad as it was. It was amazing.
[2:53:57.240 --> 2:54:04.200]  So infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139. What is in a bottle of living defense?
[2:54:04.920 --> 2:54:12.120]  Organic black walnut, a traditional herb for Native Americans. The North American tree has
[2:54:12.120 --> 2:54:17.720]  shown promising scientific research involving the green, unripe fruit hull. That's what's in this.
[2:54:17.720 --> 2:54:21.720]  Organic olive leaf was used by the ancient Romans to support their soldiers' health,
[2:54:21.720 --> 2:54:27.480]  all traveling through foreign lands. Organic neem leaf, a powerful herb additionally used for
[2:54:27.480 --> 2:54:33.480]  internal cleansing and aiding in healthy digestive tract. Organic ginger root, a wildly popular
[2:54:33.480 --> 2:54:42.280]  Asian herb, usually traditionally for soothing the gut. Organic koasha is a native to South America
[2:54:42.280 --> 2:54:48.520]  and has been shown to contain very potent systems that get activated in the body.
[2:54:48.520 --> 2:54:53.320]  Grapefruit seed extract. I don't have time to go through all this. Organic black walnut leaf and
[2:54:53.320 --> 2:55:02.680]  stem, that's powerful. And it just goes on from there. The grape seed extract, also very highly
[2:55:02.680 --> 2:55:07.960]  antioxidant potential as well as many other properties. And then of course some other ingredients
[2:55:07.960 --> 2:55:14.360]  that are in it. This is an amazing product and it flushes out all the unwanted visitors.
[2:55:14.360 --> 2:55:18.200]  It's available at infowarstore.com. A great Christmas gift, a great thing to do in the
[2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:24.360]  New Year. Alva powers back in. We also have Prostagard back in and that's how we stay on
[2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:28.920]  the air with this great crew. In the face of the globalist, we are one of the last groups standing
[2:55:28.920 --> 2:55:33.320]  against the New World Order and people are ready to be awakened right now. We got to stay on air.
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:37.960]  So thank you all for your support, infowarstore.com. All Joseph Watson takes over.
[2:55:41.400 --> 2:55:45.800]  I've got some really exciting good news and I've also got some bad news.
[2:55:45.800 --> 2:55:53.480]  Info Wars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[2:55:53.480 --> 2:55:57.960]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us,
[2:55:57.960 --> 2:56:02.600]  you with your word of mouth have overridden that and they are so scared of infowars.com
[2:56:02.600 --> 2:56:06.920]  in band.video and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[2:56:06.920 --> 2:56:11.160]  But we're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December,
[2:56:11.160 --> 2:56:14.600]  right now. This is our most important month to be able to fund ourselves in the next year.
[2:56:14.600 --> 2:56:18.280]  And I understand the economy is shut down. I understand there's not as much money as they're
[2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:22.200]  used to be. They're trying to kill Trump's recovery. But info wars really need your support.
[2:56:22.200 --> 2:56:27.080]  You just buy great items through your Christmas shopping at infowarstore.com with huge sales,
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:32.200]  amazing products. And then you know you're funding the info war and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos
[2:56:32.200 --> 2:56:36.040]  and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses. Continue to fund
[2:56:36.040 --> 2:56:40.360]  the Second American Revolution. We're getting great products at the same time at infowarstore.com.
[2:56:40.360 --> 2:56:51.320]  Thank you. Transmitting Worldwide from the summit.news.studios in the United Kingdom.
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:54.440]  You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[2:56:59.320 --> 2:57:06.520]  Welcome back everybody to the Summit News Hour. I'm your host Paul Joseph Watson. Here in London,
[2:57:06.520 --> 2:57:14.200]  which is just or in fact tonight at midnight goes under yet another, guess what, lockdown. Yes,
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:19.720]  because the first one worked so well. The second one worked even better because both of those
[2:57:19.720 --> 2:57:26.680]  lockdowns worked so well. Now we need to have another. And not just that, the four days of
[2:57:26.680 --> 2:57:31.640]  Christmas relief that the government, the saintly, beneficent government promised us
[2:57:31.640 --> 2:57:37.480]  in all its glory and we were so thankful to get four days off where we could see our family members
[2:57:37.480 --> 2:57:43.080]  because nobody's breaking the rules whatsoever. Nobody's going out and seeing their family members.
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:48.200]  Nobody's going out and congregating in groups with people outside their own household,
[2:57:48.200 --> 2:57:53.720]  which under the law is illegal. Nobody's doing that. But the government said we could do that
[2:57:53.720 --> 2:58:00.120]  with up to three different households from the period of December 23rd to December 27th.
[2:58:00.120 --> 2:58:06.760]  Now they're saying, well, maybe not. Yes, joy upon joy. Christmas looks like it's officially
[2:58:06.760 --> 2:58:11.400]  going to be cancelled in the United Kingdom. Of course, the Netherlands just announced,
[2:58:12.040 --> 2:58:16.200]  I think it was a five week lockdown. Germany's got a lockdown until January 10th.
[2:58:16.760 --> 2:58:20.760]  France is under a curfew whereby you can't be outside after 8 p.m.
[2:58:22.040 --> 2:58:27.000]  And now we have this headline out of Sky News. COVID-19 talks between UK nations on Christmas
[2:58:27.000 --> 2:58:33.000]  rules to continue tomorrow amid calls for rethink. Now, of course, we've had all the lockdowns that
[2:58:33.000 --> 2:58:39.160]  failed. The hospital numbers, the death numbers compared to this time of year over the past five
[2:58:39.160 --> 2:58:44.200]  years are completely flat. They're stable, but apparently infection rates are soaring.
[2:58:44.840 --> 2:58:49.480]  Of course, most of those infection rates, even if you go on the government's own hokey numbers,
[2:58:50.360 --> 2:58:54.680]  the vast majority of them can be traced back to hospitals,
[2:58:54.680 --> 2:59:00.520]  care homes and schools. According to their own statistics, that's where the vast majority of
[2:59:00.520 --> 2:59:05.880]  new coronavirus infections are taking place. And what is the answer? Well, obviously it's to close
[2:59:05.880 --> 2:59:13.160]  bars and restaurants and shops, even though less than 3% on their own numbers of new coronavirus
[2:59:13.160 --> 2:59:19.400]  infections emerge out of those venues. The country is completely crippled economically. I'm going
[2:59:19.400 --> 2:59:24.280]  to get onto that. Bars, restaurants are closing down left, right and center. People are literally
[2:59:24.280 --> 2:59:29.160]  going into poverty. Tens of thousands of people are dying through not having cancer treatments
[2:59:29.160 --> 2:59:35.000]  and other treatments. And yet we're about to enter another lockdown literally in four hours' time.
[2:59:36.520 --> 2:59:41.240]  Talks between the four nations of the UK of the relaxation of coronavirus rules for Christmas
[2:59:41.240 --> 2:59:46.280]  are set to continue tomorrow amid calls for a rethink due to a rising coronavirus infection
[2:59:46.280 --> 2:59:50.680]  rates. Cabinet Officer Michael Gove spoke with the leaders of the evolved administrations on
[2:59:50.680 --> 2:59:57.080]  Tuesday evening. At present, it's planned across the whole UK, up to three households will be able
[2:59:57.080 --> 3:00:04.680]  to form a Christmas bubble because the government allows us to expand our bubble to one extra little
[3:00:04.680 --> 3:00:12.520]  bubble. Oh my God, thank you, state. And meet for five days between 23rd and 27th of December,
[3:00:13.160 --> 3:00:18.040]  says travel restrictions will also be lifted during that same five-day period. They've closed
[3:00:18.040 --> 3:00:24.680]  all the bars and restaurants. Nobody's abiding by these rules. Have you been outside? So we had a
[3:00:24.680 --> 3:00:32.520]  lockdown, which lasted a month, which ended on the 2nd of December. The law states the bars and the
[3:00:32.520 --> 3:00:38.040]  pubs are open, the restaurants are open, but you're not allowed to meet anyone indoors who doesn't
[3:00:38.040 --> 3:00:43.400]  live in your household. Now, if you live alone, the government has deigned in all its beneficent
[3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:51.320]  charity to allow you to form a support bubble with one other household. So even if you lie and
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:55.960]  tell them you're living alone, you're still only supposed to meet people from one other household.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:01.160]  Go outside when the bar of the restaurants are actually open, which they have been in London
[3:01:01.160 --> 3:01:05.320]  over the past two weeks, they gave us two weeks. Now we're going back into lockdown again.
[3:01:06.120 --> 3:01:11.320]  On literally every table or every other table, every other table in a bar in a restaurant,
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:17.480]  there are six people sat there drinking and eating. They don't live in the same household.
[3:01:17.480 --> 3:01:22.040]  Nobody is following these rules. Now, no matter what the government comes out with,
[3:01:22.040 --> 3:01:26.680]  they close all the bars and restaurants, everybody just goes and parties in each other's houses.
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:33.400]  It's ridiculous. Now, I've witnessed this from first-hand experience. You can literally go to
[3:01:33.400 --> 3:01:39.080]  someone's house party or apartment and all the way down the street, all the way across the road,
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:43.800]  people are just waving to each other from their apartments, having mass parties with gatherings
[3:01:43.800 --> 3:01:49.320]  of 10, 15 people. Nobody's obeying these rules as it is. But then when you look at the polls,
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:55.480]  well, they tell you a different story. People's behavior is not cognizant with these polls that
[3:01:55.480 --> 3:02:00.440]  they're putting out because they want to make people think that they need to conform because
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:05.400]  they're socially irresponsible if they don't follow the rules, even though nobody's following
[3:02:05.400 --> 3:02:11.000]  the rules. But when asked by pollsters, they say they're following the rules and that's enough.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:18.120]  This is all a complete mirage. Headline out of the press and journal. Most Scots think easing
[3:02:18.120 --> 3:02:23.560]  of restrictions for Christmas should be dropped. A majority of people in the UK think the decision
[3:02:23.560 --> 3:02:29.480]  to relax coronavirus restrictions over Christmas. And bear in mind, this relaxation didn't open
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:35.480]  anything up. Now, if you live in London, even with this relaxation over Christmas, everything's
[3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:40.840]  still closed. They're just saying the government's going to give you permission to visit your family
[3:02:40.840 --> 3:02:48.520]  at Christmas. What kind of intellectual coward, what kind of spineless amoeba would not visit
[3:02:48.520 --> 3:02:54.520]  their own family on Christmas Day because the government said they couldn't? Are people actually
[3:02:54.520 --> 3:02:59.480]  complying with this? From what I've seen, no. But they're telling the pollsters a completely
[3:02:59.480 --> 3:03:07.080]  different thing. So the snap poll from YouGov shows 57% of Brits and 58% of Scots think current
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:15.000]  rules should be maintained over the festive period. YouGov asked 383,856 people in Britain,
[3:03:15.000 --> 3:03:18.680]  currently coronavirus restrictions are due to be relaxed for five days over Christmas.
[3:03:18.680 --> 3:03:23.880]  Do you think those polls could respond? Those poll could respond by saying they would like to see the
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:28.600]  rules relaxed as planned or that the move should be dropped and current rules continued over the
[3:03:28.600 --> 3:03:38.040]  festive period. So 50% of respondents in Britain in this poll wanted even harsher lockdown restrictions
[3:03:38.040 --> 3:03:45.240]  and only 30% or 31% said that this relaxation, which isn't even a relaxation, everything's still
[3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:51.160]  closed, should still go ahead as planned. Looks like that's not even going to be the case as we
[3:03:51.160 --> 3:03:58.360]  currently stand. So among people aged 65 plus, 70% believe the rules should not change over
[3:03:58.360 --> 3:04:07.560]  Christmas. A position shared by 61% of 50 to 65 year olds, 49% of 25 to 49 year olds, 55% of 18
[3:04:07.560 --> 3:04:17.160]  to 24 year olds. You really think that the majority of people in the United Kingdom aged 18 to 24
[3:04:17.880 --> 3:04:24.440]  want even harsher lockdown rules. Have you been out? Have you been out in the street? Have you been
[3:04:24.440 --> 3:04:30.440]  out in the pubs? They're all violating the rules as it is. They're all gathered in groups of six
[3:04:30.440 --> 3:04:35.640]  because that's the maximum they'll allow into the bar or restaurant. All with people who they don't
[3:04:35.640 --> 3:04:39.400]  live with. They've been violating the rules for months and that's good because the rules are
[3:04:39.400 --> 3:04:46.200]  complete BS. But then when they're asked by the pollsters, they say a completely different thing
[3:04:46.200 --> 3:04:52.280]  and this sets the consensus, which allows the government to continually reopen, ratify these
[3:04:52.280 --> 3:04:58.200]  rules because they can claim they have the consensus of the British public. I think if these people
[3:04:58.200 --> 3:05:05.160]  were being honest, and in fact, we've seen other polls whereby upwards of 60 to 70% support the
[3:05:05.160 --> 3:05:10.680]  lockdown, yet when they're asked to be honest, if they've ever violated the lockdown personally,
[3:05:11.400 --> 3:05:17.160]  only 18% say they haven't violated the lockdown. So they're completely lying. But once again,
[3:05:17.160 --> 3:05:24.520]  this is setting the precedent for more economy crippling measures. I have an article here out
[3:05:24.520 --> 3:05:32.680]  of Harpers. This is the head of UK Hospitality. Headline Nichols continuing to bat hospitality
[3:05:32.680 --> 3:05:37.800]  is not the answer. She says so many pubs, restaurants, bars, cafes and hotels having
[3:05:37.800 --> 3:05:43.160]  invested so much to make their venues safe are only just clinging on by the skin of their teeth
[3:05:43.160 --> 3:05:49.000]  and will take another huge hit. And again, she makes the point, the vast majority of infections
[3:05:49.000 --> 3:05:55.000]  going by the government's own numbers, schools, care homes, hospitals, they're not in pubs or
[3:05:55.000 --> 3:06:00.600]  restaurants. Yet these pubs, these restaurants are shutting down. They're going out of business.
[3:06:00.600 --> 3:06:07.480]  A tweet here from Camilla Tominy. She said, this is the reality of tier three for pub owners. That's
[3:06:07.480 --> 3:06:12.600]  basically the strictest lockdown tier. She says a landlord friend of mine in Hertfordshire had
[3:06:12.600 --> 3:06:20.120]  4,000 covers booked between now and new years, amounting to a potential 92,000 pounds in sales.
[3:06:20.120 --> 3:06:26.120]  That has just been wiped out in the blink of an eye. And that is the same similar situation for
[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:32.360]  small business owners, but landlords, restaurant owners across the country, massive unemployment
[3:06:32.360 --> 3:06:37.960]  will get into that and more on the other side of the break summit.news.go away. We'll be right back.
[3:06:39.880 --> 3:06:45.400]  Three months ago, we sold out of our privacy pouches. The reason we sold out is they are
[3:06:45.400 --> 3:06:51.000]  super high quality and it's all over the news that the UN and the Clintons and Microsoft and
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:55.000]  others and contact tracers are tracking everywhere you go and everything you do. They admit it's
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:00.440]  a cover for bringing in their cashless society, AI system of total control. So to block the UN,
[3:07:00.440 --> 3:07:05.000]  to block the globalist, to get in the habit of realizing what a surveillance system phones are,
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:10.920]  everybody needs a privacy pocket. They fit almost all sizes of droids and iPhones from small to big.
[3:07:10.920 --> 3:07:15.640]  They also make a great gift to educate friends and family about what's going on. Now again,
[3:07:15.640 --> 3:07:19.640]  there's lots of privacy pocket type systems out there. Most of them are about a 90% effective.
[3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:25.720]  We found a model that's actually pretty inexpensive and has around 99% effectiveness. If you're right
[3:07:25.720 --> 3:07:30.120]  under a cell tower, it'll still blast through the Faraday cage. They're at infowarstore.com
[3:07:30.120 --> 3:07:35.320]  at $19.95. This exact same system is sold everywhere else for $29. It's still a great deal.
[3:07:35.320 --> 3:07:39.160]  We sell a lot of these. We have the best price. It is a great Christmas gift at infowarstore.com.
[3:07:40.360 --> 3:07:46.520]  The US Postal Service tells Info Wars that as long as you get your order in by December 18th,
[3:07:46.520 --> 3:07:50.440]  we're able to ship it out. By that date, you will get it anywhere in the United States before
[3:07:50.440 --> 3:07:55.800]  Christmas. But listen, don't wait. Do your shopping at infowarstore.com, get great products,
[3:07:55.800 --> 3:08:00.840]  and fund the Info War. Now at the most critical time, not just at Info Wars history, but this
[3:08:00.840 --> 3:08:06.200]  country's history, you have invested in Info Wars. You've prayed for us, you've spread the word,
[3:08:06.200 --> 3:08:11.240]  you've bought the products, and you've gotten the benefits of the information warfare of the truth
[3:08:11.240 --> 3:08:15.800]  in the fight against the globalist. But now is the time to redouble all our efforts
[3:08:15.800 --> 3:08:19.160]  in praying for a great awakening, which is starting to happen, and spreading the word about
[3:08:19.160 --> 3:08:26.360]  infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video. And at the very same time, buying amazing
[3:08:26.360 --> 3:08:31.080]  products at infowarstore.com. We have some of the biggest sales, if not the biggest of the year,
[3:08:31.080 --> 3:08:34.680]  certainly on some items, the biggest sales of the year on nutraceuticals, you name it,
[3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:39.080]  at infowarstore.com. So thanks for your support. Get those orders in, and God bless.
[3:08:39.080 --> 3:08:45.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:52.040 --> 3:08:57.560]  You're listening to the summit.news radio hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:09:01.720 --> 3:09:07.800]  So the drumbeat of corona hysteria marches on. We have polls suggesting that the majority,
[3:09:07.800 --> 3:09:12.600]  the clear majority of grits want even harsher lockdown measures, despite anecdotal evidence
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:18.200]  suggesting that they're not abiding by the measures at all. And in fact, also anecdotal
[3:09:18.200 --> 3:09:24.200]  evidence from what I've seen of mass resistance to this. In fact, I went to the barbers to have
[3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:28.520]  my haircut on Friday, not that you can really tell at the moment given the state of it today.
[3:09:28.520 --> 3:09:33.320]  But as soon as I walked in, literally every customer is just talking about the vaccine,
[3:09:33.320 --> 3:09:37.720]  how they're not going to take the vaccine, how the lockdown is BS. The owners are talking about
[3:09:37.720 --> 3:09:44.600]  how much money they'd lost. I went to the pub on Sunday night for a substantial meal because now
[3:09:44.600 --> 3:09:49.640]  lots of pubs are going out of business because they can't afford to offer substantial meals because
[3:09:49.640 --> 3:09:54.520]  punters who come into the pubs can't afford to buy them because everyone's losing their job. So
[3:09:54.520 --> 3:10:00.280]  they can't afford to buy a big dinner every time they want a pint of beer. But again, in the pub,
[3:10:00.280 --> 3:10:05.000]  there was a woman there saying, I work for the NHS. We're completely empty. There's no crisis.
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:10.760]  It's completely empty here. Similar talk in the street. I heard it in the park. Everybody is
[3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:14.440]  violating these rules. Everybody doesn't believe in them. Not everybody, but a great
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:19.640]  anecdotally evidence suggests at least a significant portion of people just aren't
[3:10:19.640 --> 3:10:24.760]  buying it whatsoever from everything I hear. But then you have these polls, which I mentioned
[3:10:24.760 --> 3:10:30.920]  before the break, still showing that the majority of people support these measures and even harsher
[3:10:30.920 --> 3:10:35.640]  measures and that gives the government the justification to then vote them through again
[3:10:35.640 --> 3:10:42.680]  and complete and continually reapply and ratify them over and over again. And it's interesting
[3:10:42.680 --> 3:10:47.880]  because once they create that consensus, they can use it to set policy. So it's more about
[3:10:47.880 --> 3:10:53.320]  perception than actual reality. And in fact, we've got a video here which speaks to this.
[3:10:54.360 --> 3:11:00.280]  It's called the Ash Conformity Experiment. This was a series of psychological experiments
[3:11:00.280 --> 3:11:06.920]  conducted from the 50s onwards. There were many of them by Solomon Ash studying if and how
[3:11:06.920 --> 3:11:13.720]  individuals yielded to or defied a majority group and the effect of such influences on beliefs
[3:11:13.720 --> 3:11:20.840]  and opinions. So it's about how once they set this artificial consensus and terrify or manipulate
[3:11:20.840 --> 3:11:26.280]  or socially re-engineer people into believing that this is what the vast majority of people
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:32.200]  think. So it must be correct. Not only it must be correct, you must go along with it also so as not
[3:11:32.200 --> 3:11:39.400]  to be ostracized or stigmatized by that social group. This is a precedent long established
[3:11:39.400 --> 3:11:44.760]  in psychology. One of these experiments or series of experiments was called the Ash Conformity
[3:11:44.760 --> 3:11:50.440]  Experiment. We have a clip giving an example of how that was conducted. Let's roll the clip.
[3:11:50.440 --> 3:11:58.600]  Ash experiment is one of psychology's oldest and most popular pieces of research. A volunteer is
[3:11:58.600 --> 3:12:04.440]  told that he's taking part in a visual perception test. What he doesn't know is that the other
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:09.560]  participants are actors and he's the only person taking part in the real test which is actually
[3:12:09.560 --> 3:12:15.240]  about group conformity. Please begin. The experiment you'll be taking part in today involves the
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:19.880]  perception of line length. Your task will be simply to look at the line here on the left
[3:12:19.880 --> 3:12:23.880]  and indicate which of the three lines on the right is equal to it in length.
[3:12:23.880 --> 3:12:30.760]  So for example, the actors have been told to match the wrong lines. The volunteer will be monitored
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:35.480]  to see if he gives the correct answer or if he goes along with the opinion of the group and gives
[3:12:35.480 --> 3:12:57.560]  the wrong answer. In the first test, the correct answer is two. One. One. One. Two. One. Once
[3:12:57.560 --> 3:13:13.400]  again, the correct answer is two. Three. Three. Three. Three. Three. The Ash experiment has been
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:20.120]  repeated many times and the results have been supported again and again. We will conform to
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:25.640]  the group. Again, we're very social creatures. We're very much aware of what the people around us
[3:13:25.640 --> 3:13:31.880]  think. We want to be liked. We don't want to be seen to rock the boat, so we will go along with
[3:13:31.880 --> 3:13:40.680]  the group. Even if we don't believe what people are saying, we still go along. One. One. One.
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:44.440]  Group dynamics is one of the most powerful forces in human psychology.
[3:13:49.160 --> 3:13:54.280]  So there you have it, the Ash conformity experiment where they're showing one individual
[3:13:54.280 --> 3:14:00.040]  a series of lines and asking him to match the length of the line. The lines are clearly shorter
[3:14:00.040 --> 3:14:05.080]  or longer than the original line that he's shown, but because all of the other people in the experiment
[3:14:05.080 --> 3:14:12.120]  who are stooges who are actors give the wrong answer, it causes him to not believe his own
[3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:18.200]  lying eyes and to give the same wrong answer. This is the power of conformity. This is the power
[3:14:18.200 --> 3:14:23.640]  of the hysteria that once the media is unified with the same message, despite the fact that
[3:14:23.640 --> 3:14:28.840]  they're distrusted to an even greater degree, the fact that they all still carry that same message
[3:14:28.840 --> 3:14:34.200]  continues to apply to reality and especially with this coronavirus lockdown. I mean, I've
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:42.440]  mentioned before my auntie and uncle who live in Wales, elderly couple, they've been so petrified
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:49.400]  by the hysteria from the media about this virus that they got up the gusto, the guts to actually
[3:14:49.400 --> 3:14:54.360]  leave their homes months into this lockdown after they were told they were allowed to by the government.
[3:14:55.160 --> 3:15:01.480]  They drove to a local beauty spot and because even in this very rural wilderness area,
[3:15:01.480 --> 3:15:07.640]  they saw a few people walking around this local beauty spot. They were so terrified that they
[3:15:07.640 --> 3:15:14.120]  couldn't even leave their car and they immediately drove right back home. That is the power of this
[3:15:14.120 --> 3:15:20.760]  conformity hysteria that the mainstream media has fostered on people, has inflicted on people
[3:15:21.640 --> 3:15:26.360]  as a result of facilitating what we've talked about many times before, which is the great
[3:15:26.360 --> 3:15:31.400]  reset which we're going to get into after the break, which is why it's important, by the way,
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:37.800]  to break this consensus by being more and more vocal about how lockdown is complete BS and I'm
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:42.280]  seeing more and more signs of that and we had another one yesterday and we're going to roll
[3:15:42.280 --> 3:15:49.160]  this quick video now. Don't let them do it. Man stages lockdown protest in branch of Costco.
[3:15:49.160 --> 3:15:54.360]  This was a guy who basically got up on a on a clothes stand and started bullhorning the shoppers
[3:15:54.360 --> 3:16:00.520]  about how the lockdown was complete BS. Notice the reaction from the shoppers. The staff is
[3:16:00.520 --> 3:16:06.440]  obviously trying to talk him down, trying to get him down from his platform where he's bullhorning
[3:16:06.440 --> 3:16:11.720]  the shoppers. But if you notice, if you watch in the video now, two of the shoppers that he's talking
[3:16:11.720 --> 3:16:16.840]  to immediately walk up and give him a fist bump. Let's roll that video. Here it is right now.
[3:16:42.680 --> 3:17:08.440]  So they have it and I'm seeing more and more of this, not just chatter on the street, but videos
[3:17:08.440 --> 3:17:13.240]  like that. Of course, this is in California or again, across generally across the United States,
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:21.080]  the actual COVID infections, according to the CDC's own numbers, only 1.6% are coming out of bars,
[3:17:21.080 --> 3:17:26.360]  restaurants, indoor dining, yet they're all being shut down. But not for Governor Newsom himself,
[3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:32.920]  of course, he dined in a fancy French restaurant indoors with a group of 12 people while telling
[3:17:32.920 --> 3:17:37.240]  Americans they couldn't celebrate Thanksgiving indoors. Don't go away. Summit Dot News will be
[3:17:37.240 --> 3:17:41.240]  right back.
[3:18:07.640 --> 3:18:14.360]  2.5 million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months. Okay? It's a
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:19.880]  quarter million. If you count all of the people that died of other things we're talking 96% had
[3:18:19.880 --> 3:18:24.440]  comorbidity. These are real numbers. These are real facts. This is the chicken little event where
[3:18:24.440 --> 3:18:28.760]  we all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential. Although the big box
[3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:35.160]  stores in Amazon take over the planet. You can stand up against it. This is slavery. It is not
[3:18:35.160 --> 3:18:41.240]  something you can pull up with and survive. Hey Steve, how you doing? Hey Alex, oh my god.
[3:18:41.240 --> 3:18:47.080]  Long time listener, first time caller. Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital. I went in the
[3:18:47.080 --> 3:18:52.440]  VA hospital out here in Boise and I was in there until June and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all
[3:18:52.440 --> 3:18:57.000]  you guys talking about living defense. Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal
[3:18:57.000 --> 3:19:01.400]  digestive problem and I was stuffing with it for about five or six years and the doctors,
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:06.360]  they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is. And then every day when I kept hearing
[3:19:06.360 --> 3:19:10.040]  you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what? I'm going to get me some of that
[3:19:10.040 --> 3:19:13.400]  freaking living defense. Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want
[3:19:13.400 --> 3:19:18.120]  you to have it. But I ordered it, had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I
[3:19:18.120 --> 3:19:24.040]  started taking it, man. That stuff changed my life. It saved my life. If there's any veteran out there,
[3:19:24.040 --> 3:19:28.760]  I don't give you travel though. Anybody who's traveled overseas, you absolutely owe it to
[3:19:28.760 --> 3:19:34.760]  yourself to get two bottles of that living defense. It's true, folks. We don't sell anything unless
[3:19:34.760 --> 3:19:37.400]  it's the highest quality and living defense is over the top good.
[3:19:48.920 --> 3:19:55.480]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your
[3:19:55.480 --> 3:20:00.920]  Safari browser. Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes
[3:20:00.920 --> 3:20:07.880]  up, you simply click add to home screen. It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video.
[3:20:07.880 --> 3:20:12.680]  You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to
[3:20:12.680 --> 3:20:17.080]  stop it. The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override
[3:20:17.080 --> 3:20:22.520]  them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app. So it's up to you

[3:20:42.280 --> 3:20:59.080]  Jones Show. Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit Dot News.
[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:07.000]  Now we just played the video before the break of a man in a California branch of Costco,
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:13.160]  bullhorning shoppers about the lockdown, telling them to not accept it, to not obey, to not wear
[3:21:13.160 --> 3:21:17.480]  the mask. And if you notice from that video, he got a couple of fist bumps from other shoppers.
[3:21:18.440 --> 3:21:25.080]  Now we have the yin to that yang situation with the next video, which came out today,
[3:21:25.080 --> 3:21:31.400]  headline out Summit News. Put your effing mask on. I rate man stalks woman in department store.
[3:21:31.400 --> 3:21:35.560]  Now this is the ultimate Karen of Karen's. This is one of the best I've seen so far.
[3:21:35.560 --> 3:21:41.560]  A video uploaded to Twitter shows an I rate man screeching at a woman to put your effing mask on
[3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:47.960]  while aggressively stalking her around a department store. Obviously didn't really care about social
[3:21:47.960 --> 3:21:53.160]  distancing given that he's getting right up in a grill, right up in her face because she's not
[3:21:53.160 --> 3:21:58.600]  wearing a mask. The positive thing about this video, once you watch it, and this is what I was
[3:21:58.600 --> 3:22:04.360]  talking about before the break, he tries to enlist other shoppers in this department store
[3:22:04.360 --> 3:22:11.560]  or to get as perversely angry as he's getting while he's literally walking aggressively fast
[3:22:11.560 --> 3:22:16.360]  paced after this woman violating social distancing, which according to him is such an important thing.
[3:22:16.920 --> 3:22:21.640]  He tries to enlist all these other shoppers to complain about her and they all tell him to
[3:22:21.640 --> 3:22:27.480]  go away and stop acting like a complete weirdo. This is increasingly the case. This is why this
[3:22:27.480 --> 3:22:33.880]  represents good news. Let's roll this clip now. This is put your effing mask on. I rate man stalks
[3:22:33.880 --> 3:22:40.840]  woman in department store. Here it is. Put your mask on. I'm sorry. You can walk away from me right
[3:22:40.840 --> 3:22:45.480]  now, sir. Put your mask on. Get away from me. Put it on. Does it bother anybody else that she
[3:22:45.480 --> 3:22:50.280]  doesn't have to wear a mask that we all do? Just go away. Stay six feet away from me then. No. Get
[3:22:50.280 --> 3:22:57.560]  away from me. No. Please get away from me right now. No. You don't need to come near me. She has
[3:22:57.560 --> 3:23:04.840]  it on her damn hand. Get away from me. Walk away from me, sir. Please get away from me.
[3:23:10.520 --> 3:23:15.800]  You don't care. Leave me alone. She put she six feet away from me then.
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:25.640]  Get out of here. I know who you voted for.
[3:23:27.400 --> 3:23:31.160]  So, you know, it's that he goes up to another woman while he's harassing the initial woman
[3:23:31.160 --> 3:23:35.560]  and he's like, you don't care. You don't care. And I'm like, no, we don't care. Go away, weirdo.
[3:23:35.560 --> 3:23:42.040]  Go away. Stop harassing women. Also, you know, I see this over and over again. The people who
[3:23:42.040 --> 3:23:46.600]  are so egregiously aggressive over other people not wearing their masks, they don't even wear them
[3:23:46.600 --> 3:23:52.600]  properly themselves. It wasn't even over his nose at the start. So another weirdo turned away for
[3:23:52.600 --> 3:23:58.840]  his Karen behavior. Of course, the left have tried to hijack that Karen meme and make it about
[3:23:58.840 --> 3:24:03.640]  people who don't wear masks, even though it way more specifically applies to those
[3:24:04.520 --> 3:24:11.320]  aggressive wardens who want to patrol the other prisoners in the prison planet.
[3:24:11.320 --> 3:24:15.080]  They see you're required to wear the mask in social distance while he's literally like getting
[3:24:15.080 --> 3:24:20.200]  up in her face. We had a video last week of someone who was literally spitting a woman on
[3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:26.440]  a hiking trail because she wasn't wearing a mask saying, I've got coronavirus while spitting at her,
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:32.680]  but she was in the wrong for not wearing a mask. Someone else who got caught not wearing a mask
[3:24:32.680 --> 3:24:39.320]  is our old friend, Piers Morgan, the failed American talk show host who came scuttling back
[3:24:39.320 --> 3:24:44.600]  to Britain with his tail between his legs and who, of course, has been one of the most vehement
[3:24:44.600 --> 3:24:50.760]  proponents of lockdown in the United Kingdom. Well, just like his mate Gary Linnicka,
[3:24:52.040 --> 3:24:57.000]  another vehement virtue signal for coronavirus lockdowns who got caught not wearing a mask
[3:24:57.000 --> 3:25:03.800]  inside a supermarket while demanding everybody else wear one. Now Piers Morgan has been caught
[3:25:03.800 --> 3:25:07.320]  doing the same. Piers Morgan slammed after caught not wearing a mask in public.
[3:25:07.320 --> 3:25:13.000]  British news anchor Piers Morgan has been slammed as a total hypocrite after being caught not wearing
[3:25:13.000 --> 3:25:18.040]  a face mask in public of the weekend despite lecturing everyone else for months about the need
[3:25:18.040 --> 3:25:23.880]  to wear a mask. Morgan was pictured getting into a cab in London without a mask on prompting him
[3:25:23.880 --> 3:25:28.840]  to admit he was being an idiot. And by the way, he came out afterwards and said he makes this
[3:25:28.840 --> 3:25:35.960]  mistake basically every day, basically admitting that he doesn't follow the rules according to him,
[3:25:35.960 --> 3:25:42.600]  everybody else has to abide by. In the United Kingdom, it's the law that you have to wear a
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:48.920]  mask inside a taxi cab. The good thing about that is that in every single case in which I've
[3:25:48.920 --> 3:25:55.560]  experienced over the past month, the black cab drivers who are typically of the demographic,
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:26:01.880]  which is quite populist and somewhat right wing, the taxi drivers are by law required to wear them.
[3:26:01.880 --> 3:26:07.480]  They're not wearing them and they don't ask you to wear them, which is probably why he got into
[3:26:07.480 --> 3:26:14.040]  this car and didn't wear one because it's completely unenforced. But unfortunately for Piers Morgan,
[3:26:14.680 --> 3:26:18.680]  who again has been wagging his finger at everyone else for the past six months,
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:24.920]  his son, but he said he was proud of his son for attending a Black Lives Matter Super Spreader
[3:26:24.920 --> 3:26:32.600]  mass demonstration with 20,000 people, but then said you shouldn't be allowed to go outside. He's
[3:26:32.600 --> 3:26:38.920]  once again being hoisted by his own petard and being made a complete fool of by being caught
[3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:43.320]  not wearing a mask in a taxi cab. But again, the good news is that's not even enforced because
[3:26:43.320 --> 3:26:47.000]  all the black cab drivers don't wear them either and they don't ask you to wear them.
[3:26:48.360 --> 3:26:53.800]  Meanwhile, you know this great vaccine that's supposed to end our heartache, our bitterness,
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:58.680]  our loneliness, how it's supposed to get the economy back on track, how it's supposed to get us back
[3:26:58.680 --> 3:27:05.000]  to normal. Yeah, the wonder of the wondrous vaccine turns out doesn't actually work.
[3:27:05.720 --> 3:27:11.720]  Turns out that we're going to be in lockdown, as Bill Gates said until at least 2022, maybe longer,
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:16.120]  maybe a few years longer than that, just enough so they can get the great reset through,
[3:27:16.120 --> 3:27:22.520]  because now apparently the vaccine doesn't protect you from infection. So what's the point?
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:29.000]  Isn't that the entire point of a vaccine? Meet the press, tweet it, and we've got the clip here.
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:35.320]  As one of the first vaccinated people in New Haven is planning on traveling after the second dose,
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:41.880]  so she's got the second dose, she's been a good compliant little slave, she's presumably totally
[3:27:41.880 --> 3:27:46.520]  protected, because at first they said, oh no, until you get the second dose, you're not protected.
[3:27:46.520 --> 3:27:53.960]  Well, according to Vin Gupta M.D., speaking to MSMBC, he says, just because you get vaccinated
[3:27:53.960 --> 3:27:58.680]  after the second dose does not mean you should be traveling. You could still get infected and pass
[3:27:58.680 --> 3:28:04.760]  it along to others. We have that clip. Let's roll it right now. Tweet, are you getting your vaccination
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:12.360]  this week? Tomorrow morning, and I'm grateful for it. Chuck, I just wanted to say just a follow
[3:28:12.360 --> 3:28:19.400]  up on what Yasmin mentioned. Just for your viewers out there, I know one of the individuals who we
[3:28:19.400 --> 3:28:25.640]  just saw getting vaccinated is planning on traveling after the second dose. This is a source of confusion,
[3:28:25.640 --> 3:28:30.360]  but no, this is one of the misperceptions here. Just because you get vaccinated with that second
[3:28:30.360 --> 3:28:35.400]  dose does not mean you should be participating in things like traveling in the middle of an
[3:28:35.400 --> 3:28:41.240]  out of control pandemic or that you're liberated from masks. Everything still applies until all of
[3:28:41.240 --> 3:28:46.760]  us get the two dose regimen. We don't think that's going to happen until June, July. Again,
[3:28:46.760 --> 3:28:51.640]  this goes back to what we just talked about, Chuck. We don't know if just getting the vaccination
[3:28:51.640 --> 3:28:57.880]  prevents serious illness or does it also prevent you from getting infection entirely, meaning you
[3:28:57.880 --> 3:29:03.720]  can still get infected with the virus potentially and pass it on to others. Really, really critical.
[3:29:03.720 --> 3:29:07.960]  Don't let your guard down just because you got vaccinated. You still might be able to get infected
[3:29:07.960 --> 3:29:14.120]  with a virus and pass on others. So please keep that in mind. We've all learned how much the
[3:29:14.120 --> 3:29:22.600]  asymptomatic has actually been the super spreaders. So you can still get infected with coronavirus and
[3:29:22.600 --> 3:29:29.160]  pass it on to others after you've had the second dose of the vaccine. What's the point in the vaccine,
[3:29:29.160 --> 3:29:36.200]  then? Absolutely incredible. Oh, no, you'll still need to wear a mask. You'll still need to social
[3:29:36.200 --> 3:29:41.480]  distance. You still won't be able to hug granny. It's going to go on forever or until Bill Gates
[3:29:41.480 --> 3:29:48.040]  says so at least. Someone responded to this by saying, why in heaven's name would I take a vaccine
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:55.720]  that is 95% effective for a virus that my immune system is 99.8% effective against?
[3:29:56.840 --> 3:30:01.720]  Now, literal doctors on MSNBC and say, oh, by the way, oh, just because you had the vaccine
[3:30:01.720 --> 3:30:07.800]  doesn't mean you're allowed to travel. How dare you, pleb? Get back in your house. Get that muzzle
[3:30:07.800 --> 3:30:15.240]  back on your face. And on that subject, this is out of Breitbart. London's corn make public
[3:30:15.240 --> 3:30:20.520]  wear masks outside. Don't relax coronavirus rules for Christmas. So the great announcement of the
[3:30:20.520 --> 3:30:24.040]  vaccine that people are now beginning to take that was supposed to save us from all this,
[3:30:24.040 --> 3:30:30.280]  that was supposed to get us back to normal, get us back traveling again, turns out no, not until
[3:30:30.280 --> 3:30:36.280]  Bill Gates says so, whether you get the vaccine or not, we'll be right back summit dot news. Don't
[3:30:36.280 --> 3:30:43.000]  go away. If you think 2020 has been an insane and dangerous year, just wait until you see the year
[3:30:43.000 --> 3:30:48.280]  2021. I'm Alex Jones. I started in full wars, but I couldn't have done any of this without you.
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:53.800]  And now in full wars is more important than ever because the general population of the planet is
[3:30:53.800 --> 3:30:58.360]  waking up the fact that we've done our research and we've been dead on. That's why it's so important
[3:30:58.360 --> 3:31:03.000]  for those of you out there that have supported the broadcast and the websites and the films and
[3:31:03.000 --> 3:31:06.920]  all the rest of the information we put out to realize how important your work has been and to
[3:31:06.920 --> 3:31:12.040]  redouble your efforts. So I salute you. And I thank you also as Christmas is almost here. Don't

[3:31:34.040 --> 3:31:39.080]  for your support and Merry Christmas. God bless. The pope came out yesterday and announced a global
[3:31:39.080 --> 3:31:44.520]  government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth, create a planetary universal income,
[3:31:44.520 --> 3:31:48.520]  which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on
[3:31:48.520 --> 3:31:53.720]  your phone and finally a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the
[3:31:53.720 --> 3:32:00.040]  UN Great Reset of the Davos Group and Cloud Schwab, all officially written about in hundreds of books
[3:32:00.040 --> 3:32:05.240]  by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them. Agenda 21, Agenda 2030, it's here.
[3:32:05.240 --> 3:32:10.680]  And only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all.
[3:32:12.440 --> 3:32:16.760]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle, diverse, evil,
[3:32:16.760 --> 3:32:22.680]  and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we
[3:32:22.680 --> 3:32:29.240]  are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do that,
[3:32:29.240 --> 3:32:34.200]  we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[3:32:37.960 --> 3:32:42.760]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare. The United Nations,
[3:32:42.760 --> 3:32:47.080]  the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big pharma are all pushing the COVID's most
[3:32:47.080 --> 3:32:52.440]  deadly thing in history, even though statistically it's a very weak flu or cold. But if you are
[3:32:52.440 --> 3:32:56.520]  deficient, then you can actually die from it. That's why you see somebody dying inside the nursing
[3:32:56.520 --> 3:33:02.600]  homes. Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers
[3:33:02.600 --> 3:33:08.200]  have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically bio weapons
[3:33:08.200 --> 3:33:12.840]  that are super deadly. And now they're having to resuscitate people that die, basically. When they
[3:33:12.840 --> 3:33:16.840]  take it, just like newborn babies, they give vaccines. They have to resuscitate them all the
[3:33:16.840 --> 3:33:20.760]  time, or a lot of times they just let them die. And that's on the record. It does that,
[3:33:20.760 --> 3:33:24.840]  Guillain-Barre's, narcolepsy, cancer, all these other diseases. But they tell you,
[3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:28.760]  save and effective. No one's getting hurt. It's a conspiracy theory. And then all the fine princess
[3:33:28.760 --> 3:33:33.480]  can kill you absolutely deadly. So they run from something that isn't dangerous towards something
[3:33:33.480 --> 3:33:39.000]  that is incredibly dangerous, because the media says it's safe. They do it. You must guard your
[3:33:39.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  humanity. You must guard your children's humanity. You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:50.520]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world. But they are the ones
[3:33:50.520 --> 3:33:55.080]  that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet. They are the ones that are
[3:33:55.080 --> 3:34:02.280]  now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth to the GMO crops. And now they've moved
[3:34:02.280 --> 3:34:09.480]  on to their main target, to madden with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines. They are recombinant
[3:34:09.480 --> 3:34:18.440]  DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses, were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:25.880]  systems. Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines, and then remember you've been warned.
[3:34:26.760 --> 3:34:30.840]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's
[3:34:30.840 --> 3:34:34.760]  little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and
[3:34:34.760 --> 3:35:02.840]  overriding us. It's all the same in the end. Now, as you know, the high street places,
[3:35:02.840 --> 3:35:08.440]  those damn small businesses, the bus, which is quite more important than ever to support
[3:35:08.440 --> 3:35:13.800]  your local small businesses. And by the same token, it's important to support us on this

[3:36:14.440 --> 3:36:19.080]  they started allowing football fans back into stadiums here in the United Kingdom, because
[3:36:19.080 --> 3:36:25.240]  of course they were banned under COVID rules from March onwards. When some of these areas in the
[3:36:25.240 --> 3:36:32.040]  United Kingdom, graciously by the government got put into tier two status as opposed to tier three.
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:37.000]  Now, of course, London is back in tier three. So all the football fans are banned once again.
[3:36:38.280 --> 3:36:43.320]  But once they were allowed allowed into the stadiums for a period of two weeks, basically less
[3:36:43.320 --> 3:36:50.840]  than two weeks. What did we see? We saw them booing Black Lives Matter. Yes, Premier League
[3:36:50.840 --> 3:36:57.320]  football as many of them sponsored by Nike, by the way, which literally lobbies against bills
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:37:05.080]  in the house to ban slave labor in China from Uighur Muslims. The same Nike that sponsors
[3:37:05.080 --> 3:37:09.880]  Premier League footballers. Well, as soon as those fans are allowed back into the stadiums,
[3:37:09.880 --> 3:37:17.880]  they started booing because those footballers are still six months later taking a knee for BLM.
[3:37:17.880 --> 3:37:22.520]  Now, whatever you want to argue about the situation with police brutality and violence
[3:37:22.520 --> 3:37:27.480]  against Black people in America, we do not have the same issue in the United Kingdom.
[3:37:28.280 --> 3:37:34.520]  Exceedingly rare is it that you will see a case of egregious police brutality or killing of Black
[3:37:34.520 --> 3:37:39.960]  people in the United Kingdom, mainly because police aren't armed. But even with tasers,
[3:37:39.960 --> 3:37:44.360]  you don't see it anyway. It's never been a problem. And yet footballers in this country
[3:37:44.360 --> 3:37:51.240]  are still bowing and kneeling to a violent left wing communist organization for what
[3:37:51.240 --> 3:37:57.560]  reason nobody really knows. Of course, we know it's for mass conformity. It's for social re-engineering.
[3:37:58.360 --> 3:38:03.720]  Now we have a headline out of the Daily Mail. Football fan facing lifetime ban from
[3:38:03.720 --> 3:38:10.280]  championship side for booing players who took a knee. With clubs using CCTV to single out
[3:38:10.280 --> 3:38:16.280]  supporters who jeer gesture. So the championship club has threatened to issue a lifetime ban to
[3:38:16.280 --> 3:38:21.560]  a supporter for booing while players took a knee this week. So clubs have been using
[3:38:22.120 --> 3:38:27.240]  closed circuit television to identify supporters who jeer the pre-match gesture in support of
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:33.000]  racial equality since the return of fans this month. No, it's not about racial equality.
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:39.560]  It's about literal support for capital letters. Black Lives Matter, which is a violent,
[3:38:39.560 --> 3:38:45.640]  extremist political movement has nothing to do with Black people. You had Milwall fans booing
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:51.320]  it the other week. And of course, the immediate media reaction, the hysteria was, oh, well,
[3:38:51.320 --> 3:38:56.600]  Milwall fans must just hate Black people, right? I mean, half their team's full of Black people
[3:38:56.600 --> 3:39:02.520]  and they cheer them every week. They literally give them awards. Milwall's player of the year for
[3:39:02.520 --> 3:39:08.680]  two years running was a Black person. Oh, no, but those Milwall fans booing the Black Lives Matter
[3:39:08.680 --> 3:39:12.440]  knee. Well, they just must hate Black people. So now they're literally banning people
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:20.840]  or threatening to ban them from the stadium using video surveillance to target to zero in on people
[3:39:20.840 --> 3:39:27.880]  who don't go along with this madness. Now, this is one occasion in which I would definitely recommend
[3:39:27.880 --> 3:39:34.040]  in line with the World Health Organization guidelines to wear a mask, maybe wear a mask
[3:39:34.040 --> 3:39:39.080]  that covers your entire face, and then they won't be able to identify you. But Rod Liddle
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:45.080]  out the spectator wrote a good article on this. It was called in defense of the booing Milwall fans.
[3:39:46.520 --> 3:39:50.920]  He writes, it's an enormous shame that the Milwall fans who booed their players for taking
[3:39:50.920 --> 3:39:55.960]  a knee in support of Black Lives Matter last week were not better acquainted with one of the
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:40:02.920]  British BLM leaders, Sasha Johnson. They might have taken a knee themselves out of admiration
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:09.880]  because in August, Ms. Johnson tweeted, quote, the white man will not be our equal, but our slave.
[3:40:11.320 --> 3:40:17.640]  Okay, so they're banning people for booing racial equality. And yet these footballers are taking
[3:40:17.640 --> 3:40:24.120]  a knee to honor an organization whose leader in the United Kingdom literally says she wants the
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:31.400]  white man to be their slaves. Doesn't really sound like equality to me, does it? Continues,
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:36.600]  if there is one thing Milwall supporters respect, it's aspiration. And Ms. Johnson has that in
[3:40:36.600 --> 3:40:41.000]  abundance. I'm sure the FA, the English Football League, and indeed the Milwall Club board who
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:46.840]  condemned the booing all wish Sasha the best of luck in her exciting project. And he makes the
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:53.960]  he makes the case. Ms. Johnson's views are not especially extreme and a foul organization that
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:41:00.440]  wishes to dismantle capitalism and the family. And yes, they literally put that in their BLM
[3:41:00.440 --> 3:41:07.400]  mission statement is about racial equality. It's about a Marxist movement that wants to overthrow
[3:41:07.400 --> 3:41:12.360]  every foundational aspect of our society. That's what they're taking a knee in support of.
[3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:18.360]  He says taking a new signal support for the organization, not for racial equality. And
[3:41:18.360 --> 3:41:23.240]  that is the end of the story. The football authorities and the broadcasters were very
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:29.000]  clear about this when football resumed in June after the lockdown. Players would be asked to
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:35.800]  take a knee in support of Black Lives Matter, uppercase capital letters BLM. And the point was
[3:41:35.800 --> 3:41:41.160]  reinforced by players, common haters and pundits wearing Black Lives Matter badges, which by
[3:41:41.160 --> 3:41:45.960]  the way, they subsequently removed, because people started to point out, you know what this
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:51.800]  organization actually stands for. You know that they stand for demolishing our entire system.
[3:41:51.800 --> 3:41:57.880]  They stand for eviscerating the family unit. So they had to remove the BLM badges, but these
[3:41:57.880 --> 3:42:03.080]  privileged overpaid footballers continued to take a knee because they were so terrified into
[3:42:03.080 --> 3:42:09.160]  conformity. You continue. So Milwall's assertion that taking a knee was in no way an endorsement of
[3:42:09.160 --> 3:42:14.840]  BLM's political objectives, but simply a gesture in support of love, peace and happiness among all
[3:42:14.840 --> 3:42:21.800]  peoples is deceitful, cowardly and ludicrous. He says it's like stretching out your right arm,
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:27.720]  shouting, seek hyal, and then telling onlookers, it's just a gesture, nothing to do with old
[3:42:27.720 --> 3:42:34.200]  Adolf May. So now they're starting to ban the supporters who boo Black Lives Matter, which
[3:42:34.200 --> 3:42:39.400]  of course that was always going to end the taking a knee. If you've got thousands of people every
[3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:45.080]  week booing this spectacle, it's going to end in a hurry. Oh, now conveniently for them, they've
[3:42:45.080 --> 3:42:52.200]  banned all the supporters from the stadiums once again. Meanwhile, in a related story, this happened
[3:42:52.200 --> 3:42:59.640]  last week, headline football official given 10 match ban for referring to a black guy as a black
[3:42:59.640 --> 3:43:05.720]  guy as a black guy. Yes, this is the new racist scandal that plagued Europe last week.
[3:43:07.160 --> 3:43:11.640]  Says another racism scandal in football erupted after a match official referred to a black guy
[3:43:11.640 --> 3:43:16.520]  as a black guy and was punished with a 10 match ban. Maybe that's not enough. Maybe we need to
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:21.160]  literally drag him through the streets. The incident happened during a Champions League game
[3:43:21.160 --> 3:43:29.000]  between Paris Saint-Germain and Istanbul on Tuesday night. Romanian official Sebastian
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:36.040]  Colchescu was accused of racially abusing an Istanbul coach Pierre Webbo by referring to him
[3:43:36.040 --> 3:43:43.080]  as the black guy or a la Negro in Romanian, which means the black guy. Now, bear in mind for these
[3:43:43.080 --> 3:43:49.560]  Champions League games, all the officials come from the same country and it's standard for them
[3:43:49.560 --> 3:43:56.520]  to communicate with each other in their own language. So if the black guy means is a la Negro
[3:43:56.520 --> 3:44:01.640]  in Romanian, those are the words he's going to use. The reason he referred to him as the black
[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:07.000]  guy was because he was trying to single him out from all the other coaches who were all white.
[3:44:08.280 --> 3:44:13.480]  So if this had been an African team, and they had one white coach and all the other coaches
[3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:17.880]  were black, he would have said the white guy and that wouldn't have been a problem. But because
[3:44:17.880 --> 3:44:23.640]  he referred to a black guy as a black guy, now his life is basically ruined. He'll probably be
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:29.160]  terminated forever. His reputation, his name dragged through the mud until Kingdom come.
[3:44:29.880 --> 3:44:35.000]  And in the very least, he's been banned for 10 matches. The players all walked off the pitch,
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:41.480]  by the way. They literally suspended the entire game because somebody referred to a black guy
[3:44:41.480 --> 3:44:47.320]  as a black guy. This actually happened. And they replayed the game the next day.
[3:44:47.320 --> 3:44:55.240]  A particular attention was centered on Neymar, who is a black footballer who plays for PSG,
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:45:01.640]  Paris Saint-Germain. He seemed particularly upset by this whole incident. But I'm sure that his
[3:45:02.680 --> 3:45:10.840]  700,000 euro a week paycheck probably made it easier for him. He's probably recovered by now.
[3:45:10.840 --> 3:45:14.600]  But this is the insanity that we have to deal with in terms of race relations.
[3:45:14.600 --> 3:45:19.560]  On an almost daily basis now, especially in the world of football, where the social
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:47.560]  engineering propaganda is going to wrap it up. That's our War Room with our instructor coming up next.
