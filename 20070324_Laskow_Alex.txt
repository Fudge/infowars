[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.680]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. We are now already into the third
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.160]  and final hour, eight minutes in, and boy, we got a lot to cover.
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.360]  UK, 15 soldiers detained by Iranian Navy,
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.040]  Israel's talking about war could kick off any minute. This is the type of
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.840]  provocation we said, have some soldiers captured,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.960]  have one of their patrol boats fired on by having
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.520]  British Navy, three US carrier task force groups, bunch of auxiliary
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.000]  fleets, just cruising around right up against the territorial waters
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.680]  and coming into the territorial waters. How did Israel kick off the attack on
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.080]  Lebanon? They just kept sending Israeli soldiers
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.400]  across until they got captured, and so they've kidnapped our people, but it was
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.320]  in the news that they've been captured several miles into Lebanon, and
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.120]  then Israel starts bombing, and then Lebanon starts shooting
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.040]  Katyusha rockets, and then the news announces,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.840]  they're firing Katyushas for no reason. It's just so mindless, but that's how
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.800]  they operate, and they want to start this war, so we'll
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.920]  get into that after we talk to this guest.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.160]  Before we cover the Iran news, I'll get to Matt and Gary, and
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.600]  I got so many calls here, I can't keep track of them anymore.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.720]  Actually, we'll go to Kyle in the Czech Republic,
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.320]  Jeff, Bill, Lewis, Matt, but Lewis and Matt are first.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.800]  But right now let's go to Nick Lasko, Philly 9-11 Truth. They confronted Alan
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.760]  Dershowitz yesterday, or a few days ago, and we played this
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.640]  yesterday, and they did an excellent job. Headline from PrisonPlanet.com,
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.640]  9-11 Truth is confront Alan Mingala Dershowitz,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.520]  and this is the guy that says torture's good, and he's their brainwashing group
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.280]  of Christians and Jews about how they need to be
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.760]  Kool-Aid drinkers, and world government's wonderful, and
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.320]  fight on terrorism's wonderful, and we've got to get ready for the next war,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.040]  and they're having these meetings everywhere, getting everybody ready, but
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.200]  we're going to play part of the clip again, but
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.960]  to get it directly from the folks at Philadelphia 9-11 Truth,
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.560]  here is Nick Lasko, and Nick, I'm told that you're related
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.800]  to Megs over at Popular Mechanics. It's pretty embarrassing,
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.800]  but basically me and my uncle Jim Megs, we basically agreed that we both
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.160]  really strongly disagree on how he handled 9-11,
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.080]  how he handled his piece on it, and especially just how he called
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.880]  Jason and Dylan Holocaust deniers when, if anything, it would be the exact
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.120]  opposite. Well, that's all they do, though. I mean,
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.800]  did you just hear the O'Reilly Factor, where I said four times, actually five
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.640]  times, they said Nazis, Holocaust deniers. I mean, this is just,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.320]  it isn't going to work. I mean, that's slander, number one.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.760]  I mean, it's just ridiculous, and when you hear, these days, when you hear
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.920]  someone just being called a Holocaust denier,
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.840]  I always just really bet whoever that is, and, you know,
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.120]  nine times out of ten, it turns out it's someone who's talking about the New World
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.040]  Order, or false flag terrorism, or something totally controversial.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.400]  Or saying global warming isn't man-made, you're now called a Nazi,
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.520]  and a Holocaust denier. I mean, are they gonna, if you
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.640]  complain to the dog catcher that your dog was running around the front
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.840]  yard and he took him, will they come arrest you and say you want to kill
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.040]  Jews? I know. I mean, pretty soon, if you can
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.200]  go complain about your property tax, they'll say,
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.040]  my gosh, you're a Jew hater. I mean, and I'm sure this is starting to get
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.040]  ridiculous. I mean, it just shows how desperately
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.200]  they're clinging on to the ridiculous official story regarding 9-11. Well,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160]  they're saying if you're against the Iraq war, you want to aid
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.240]  people that were like Hitler. And then you find out that Bush's
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.640]  grandfather actually funded Hitler. So, I mean, if anything,
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.120]  they're the Nazis. Well, not just funded, they were the
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.720]  head of the bank, as the secret Nazi bank.
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.760]  It's just, it's amazing, just from every angle.
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.640]  Well, it's like Arnold gets ADL awards because he says he admires Hitler and
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.360]  wants to be like Hitler someday. That's on record, mainstream news.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.520]  And that's good, but if you fight Hitler, the ADL says you're bad.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.040]  Exactly. And then he appraises Kurt Waldheim and says that he's a great guy.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.600]  You know, known Nazi war criminal. But I guess that's the way it is. I don't
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.920]  know. Now, tell us about when this was, what
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.240]  happened, exactly what they did do to you.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.760]  What they did do to you, if that's English. I mean,
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.480]  what we couldn't get from just the video. Well, let me just prep real quick.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.840]  One of my compatriots saw the Dershowitz talk, speaking
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.400]  engagement, being advertised on I-95 on a
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.920]  billboard which said that global terrorism, the new world war, and it
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.360]  depicted the towers smoking in a plane, one of the planes
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.000]  flying into them and whatnot. So we went there and we thought it was
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.480]  going to be talking about, you know, 9-11 and all that. But he ended up talking
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.440]  mostly about Israel and Lebanon and Palestine. And so
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.200]  he talked about that and he faced, and multiple times about the
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.880]  the event, he said, oh how Iran's like racing to
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.280]  to fully activate their nuclear program and on and on and on just pontificating
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.840]  about this whole, about terrorism and whatnot.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.000]  WMDs everywhere, cats and dogs living together, Armageddon,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.920]  worship government, attack them or you're dead.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.080]  Exactly, and so basically I, at the end they had a Q&A and luckily I ran up
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.000]  and became third in line and I, you know, I said looking at all the
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.360]  previous examples of government-sponsored terrorism, of false flag
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.920]  operations like the Reichstag and the Gulf of Tonkin, you know, 9-11
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.360]  really resembles a false flag operation from, you know, every angle.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.520]  And then what else did you say? Because of the they live,
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.120]  body snatcher hissing, we couldn't hear a word of what you said.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.800]  Well I started, as soon as I started to say, well look,
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.400]  just allow me to enumerate some evidence, and I started to talk about Michael
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.040]  Springman and W1999, immediately Dershow just goes, you know, no, no, no,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.280]  this, this is a no, no, no, kind of stuttering, and then the crowd just goes ape.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:22.560]  You know, we've got one of them, I mean they were like, did you see any of them
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.360]  holding their watches up going, I've got one that can see.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.480]  Well you have the, there's this one old guy down in the front who,
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.640]  if you see in the lower right corner, he gets up and just like an umpire
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.720]  throwing out an angry coach at a baseball game, he's just like, get out of here,
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.000]  get out of here. It just, it was just, it was, it was ridiculous.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.640]  Me thinks, me thinks you protest too much.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.520]  And, and it was just, and, and the thing was, I think they were a little bit,
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.160]  you know, uncomfortable with the fact that someone exercised their free speech right.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.160]  And let's be clear, you probably talk 30 seconds or 20 before they start screaming and freaking out,
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.600]  and they could have just said, okay, you're a kook, get out of here.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.640]  They were slick, but instead they know deep down this is some serious, you know,
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.080]  high-powered hoochie, and so they are upset.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.480]  Oh yeah, they, they were, they were really freaking out.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.600]  And, and you'll hear Malcolm Holmline, the other speaker, they're, they're,
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.200]  both him and Dershowitz were up there.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.320]  He said, don't worry, just sit down, we'll, we'll take your question in,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.440]  after a few other questions.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.960]  I was thinking, what, like you, you answer everyone else's questions directly.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.880]  And I was like, no, I'm just, I'm just going to, you know,
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.640]  stand up there and keep the man if they ask it.
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.480]  I'll just like, could just answer the question.
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.920]  And then finally Dershowitz gives, you know,
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.000]  says how he knows two or three people on the 9-11 commission who are students.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.920]  He taught them that they're his students.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.480]  Right, right, yeah.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.480]  All these old men are his students.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.760]  And, and of course appointed by Bush.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.120]  It's such an independent commission that it was appointed by Bush.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.400]  And he first wanted to have Henry Kissinger, who it turns out has been running everything.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.000]  Let's just play a minute or two of this.
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.200]  Here it is.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.960]  I mean, you would have thought he would have
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.520]  bashed the toddler's brains out the way they behaved.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.000]  Here it is.
[00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.060]  Yeah.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.480]  You mentioned looking back at history in the 30s around that time.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.600]  Looking back at history, looking at such catalyzed events as the Reichstag fire
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.600]  and the Gulf of, Gulf of Tonkin, the incident,
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.000]  both having emerged as classic false flag operations never happened.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.240]  Entirely carried out by their respective governments or elements within.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:35.360]  Then looking at 9-11, it really emerges as another classic false flag operation where
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.480]  elements within the government actually carry out the attack.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.160]  I mean, just, just look at, I mean, just listen to the evidence.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.640]  The head of the Visa Bureau.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.880]  You know, this is, this is Norman, this is Norman of the Visa Bureau in Jemez.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.000]  Sports signing by the CIA, a bunch of the hijackers.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.880]  Go on YouTube and watch how we do it.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:16.480]  Then they start screaming, yelling more.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.640]  Yeah, that's their big intellectual.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:25.200]  He brings up the head of the, one of the major embassies is told to let him in.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.640]  He says, but their flag is terrorists.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.520]  And they say, no, here's a designation for anti-terror training.
[00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.880]  They're government operatives.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.800]  That's incredible bombshell information.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.520]  It was in Canadian papers, in German and British and other papers, not in our papers.
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.280]  I've interviewed him several times.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.960]  Other embassies said the same thing.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.480]  We got colonels, the heads of bases going public saying they were government agents.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.320]  That's Associated Press.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:53.840]  But again, you go see Howdy Doody on your YouTube, you little dumb, dumb.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.960]  Well, and then you stood right back up to him and you said, no,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.840]  government sponsored terror is part of history.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.200]  I tell you what, you did a great job.
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.320]  Now, now what else happened?
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.680]  I mean, did you make it out of there?
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.720]  Did the cops escort you out?
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.520]  Were they, were they hissing or like body snatchers?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.440]  Was there any, you know how they do in the body snatcher room where they point at you
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.240]  and then hiss?
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.200]  I mean, what was happening?
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.640]  Well, they, they just kept trying to shout me down.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.400]  And if you watch the clip after a while, one of the guys running the event and says,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.320]  oh, we're, we're, we're calling security.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.160]  We're calling secure right now.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.760]  And I just kept on talking to him.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.440]  He was the guy right up on, on the right side.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.000]  And I kept on saying, well, what are, they said the police do it.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.320]  And he, I felt like, well, what are they going to arrest me with?
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.600]  He's like, I'm not going to tell you now.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.520]  You just have to leave, please leave.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.760]  Just it was, it was ridiculous.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.240]  Just please let us bring America down.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.840]  Just please let us have a police statement.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.640]  Be our slave.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.360]  Don't struggle.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.560]  Just submit to us.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.920]  Oh, oh, we, we nine 11's for your own, for your own good.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.760]  Just shut up.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.400]  And so, you know what, after, after about five minutes or so, they just, they just moved
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.200]  on to the next guy.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.520]  They both, you know, they both gave their ridiculous explanations for, oh yeah.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.520]  Dershowitz said like there was overwhelming evidence that bin Laden was behind it.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.960]  And that point I was so disgusted.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.680]  I was just like, the FBI said no hard evidence.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.800]  You know, it's, it's, it's total complete double.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.760]  Thank you.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.240]  It was just, it was like for a three-year-old.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.720]  I don't know.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.880]  And after a while, I just, I just headed out of there.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.480]  I was like, you know, I've said my piece.
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.840]  I've showed, I've kind of.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.200]  Oh, listen, you definitely rained on their delusional parade.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.920]  You can hear the people in Dershowitz is talking earlier going,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:34.720]  Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.920]  All these fake Christians who couldn't go to Israel and preach a word without being
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:40.960]  thrown in prison.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:48.400]  Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:48.960]  Love you.

[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.760]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.440]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:03.840]  year.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.840]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the US dollar can be devalued.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:13.280]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:13.760]  profits.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.480]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.920]  it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.360]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.680]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.280]  simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.040]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.480]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.760]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.720]  of this mess.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.880]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.000]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.360]  for over a decade.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:12.000]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.

[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.760]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.280]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.400]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.760]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.800]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.040]  have is our freedom of speech.

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.360]  Barbara Walters' handpicked co-host Rosie O'Donnell is now suggesting the United States
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:03.920]  government was responsible for the September 11th attacks and willingly killed 3,000 Americans
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.040]  at the Twin Towers to protect George W. Bush's friends at Enron.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.240]  The ABC host said this, quote, firefighters withdrawing from the area stated that the
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.840]  building was going to blow up.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:23.040]  WTC 7 contained offices of the FBI Department of Defense and IRS, which contained prodigious
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.040]  amounts of corporate tax fraud, including Enrons.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.200]  And on TV, Barbara Walters has allowed Rosie's radical rants to be broadcast front and center
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.760]  on Barbara's ABC show at the expense of herself and us.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:38.560]  You have to stop.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.200]  You have to stop.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.160]  You can ask a question, but you can't just blather on your opinion.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.960]  And who defends Rosie's radical rants?
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.760]  Well, veteran journalist Barbara Walters.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.320]  Take a look.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.120]  Are Rosie's unhinged ravings causing the sad demise of a once great journalist?
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.800]  Here now is Matthew Felling, media director for the Center for Media and Public Affairs.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.400]  Also with us, Steve Adubato.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.280]  Right there.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.960]  That's a 10-minute clip.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.200]  We've got Hannity and Combs.
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.840]  We've got Glenn Beck.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.760]  I mean, this thing went nova, nova, nova, supernova.
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:22.240]  And it's just exploding.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.760]  Now, we told you, Monday, we're going to push O'Donnell over the edge.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.040]  We're going to push it out there.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.400]  I am in contact.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.640]  And we're going to push the Charlie Sheen thing over the edge.
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.960]  Now, I didn't like the loose change thing blowing up, but it looks like that triggered this.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:40.160]  So for whoever blabbermouthed, good job.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.800]  Because I just hope it doesn't derail the film.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.120]  But look, we got to expose these terrorists.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.680]  And we need everybody to contact Scarborough Country.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.800]  I've never done this, because they'll never have me on.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.480]  I've been contacted many times by all these shows and canceled, because they know that
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.520]  I'm very aggressive.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.160]  And I cover my points and ignore them.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.000]  I don't get sucked into their games.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.600]  It's not a very complex strategy, but it works.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:06.960]  It's simple.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.520]  Attack.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.640]  Ignore their propaganda.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.120]  And call Scarborough.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:11.840]  Call Fox.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.800]  Call everybody.
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.320]  They admitted you got Ron Paul on Fox the other day, because hundreds of you called.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.920]  Tell them.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.640]  I'll go on.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.280]  And I'll debate them about this.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.480]  I'll discuss these issues.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.800]  By the way, they're doing straw men of three big posts she did with dozens of links each post.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.520]  She made one comment about, oh, isn't it interesting that the Enron records were there?
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.400]  See, now they're saying, this is the script, that it's anti-Semitic, never talked about
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.440]  Jews, and that they're claiming it was all for Enron.
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.960]  Because everybody knows that kind of sounds dumb.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.240]  Do all that for Enron.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.440]  No, it was an added bonus.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.160]  They picked a spot to cover a lot of bases.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.720]  And we're going to come back, cover some other important war news, get into some other things.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:58.080]  But I just want to thank Nick Lasko for coming on 9-11 Truth in Philly.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.440]  Any websites for you guys?
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.240]  You did a great job with the YouTube video, and it's good to have you on the team.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.600]  Yeah, we have PA911Truth.org and then PA911Visibility.com.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:16.080]  And then if you're a college or high school graduate, go to Temple 9-11 Truth Facebook group
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.840]  and Global Vanguard against False Black Terrorism Facebook group.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:24.320]  And check out John Gold's blog on 9-11 Blogger and the True Squad blog.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.640]  We're also going to be releasing some very, very interesting expos.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.840]  I can't really say too much about it, but it'll be up soon.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.280]  And I think everyone will want to check it out.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.360]  Will you lavish us with that exclusive?
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.600]  Will you call my producer when you're ready to launch that?
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.240]  Oh, of course.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.040]  What does it have to do with?
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.880]  It's kind of still sensitive at this point.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.000]  Come on, it's just you and me.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:54.580]  Tell me.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:00.160]  It kind of has to do a little bit with COINTELPRO.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.920]  I can't really say any more than that.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.240]  Oh, you mean you've red-handed caught infiltrators?
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.280]  It's pretty suspect.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.560]  It's pretty suspect, and it'll do a lot of damage to the opposition out there.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.600]  Well, here's the problem, though.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.720]  Unless you've got them red-handed, that's how COINTELPRO works.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.200]  When you respond to them, it only gives them more energy and gives oxygen to the flame.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:30.640]  Well, yeah, that may be the case, but I just think it's really important to expose the whole
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.360]  COINTELPRO operation in general.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.360]  Well, I think it's always good to expose things, but I know exactly who operatives are,
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.400]  and it would just become a big controversy they'd use if I blew them to pieces.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.880]  It's better just to give people hints and then ignore them.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.720]  I see what you're saying.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.920]  Believe me, it's not my first rodeo, my friend.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:51.120]  Oh, I know, I know.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.520]  Believe me, because a lot of people end up siding with them.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.680]  When you attack somebody, it's going to give them all the attention you've garnered and
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.120]  generated instead of keeping your ammo downrange, as Mark Kornke says.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:04.160]  Just let me see it.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.800]  Do what you want.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:07.600]  Oh, yeah, I'll run it by you.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.120]  No, you don't have to run it by me.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.040]  I thought it was something to do with 9-11 or something.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.160]  It was just some kook out causing problems.
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.000]  Well, we'll see what happens.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.640]  Good to talk to you.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.840]  I appreciate you coming on.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:18.960]  Yeah, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:19.280]  You bet.
[00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.480]  Good to hear from you.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.480]  Okay, I know we've had callers holding and time immemorial, and we will zap through those
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.520]  as quickly as possible.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.680]  Get into the escalation.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:34.960]  They're in the Gulf, the Persian Gulf there with the Persians.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.160]  You know them as the Iranians or IRABs.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.640]  I don't like them IRABs.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.600]  We're on the march.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.200]  The empire's on the run.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:52.880]  Attention.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.000]  This is an extremely urgent GCN health news bulletin.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.520]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.640]  you will ever hear.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.680]  Listen closely.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.320]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.680]  considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on earth.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.360]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:17.600]  this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.800]  reproductive health.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.560]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.560]  healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.640]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.640]  made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.240]  offer ever made on radio.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.880]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.080]  Simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.880]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that

[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:56.800]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.200]  for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.880]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:12.400]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.760]  War II?
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.120]  The Illuminati, who are worshipers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict,
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.960]  the Third World War, to produce their one-world government.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.720]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.440]  absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:38.880]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.640]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640]  glass?
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.280]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.920]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.880]  vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.680]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.240]  be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:16.840]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.920]  of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:25.160]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.960]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.120]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.640]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.080]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.680]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free, 1-866-885-6625.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:58.120]  That's 1-866-885-6625, 1-866-885-6625.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.760]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.800]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245, kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800]  hip.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.960]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lift to Big John.
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:23.280]  Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big John.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.240]  Nobody saw him over where John called home, he just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.240]  Didn't say much.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.440]  I got so much here, this is insane to try to cover all this.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.280]  I said I'd get your calls, let's do it quickly because I want to give each of you a chance.
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.840]  Let's talk to Kyle in the Czech Republic.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.320]  Welcome Kyle, you're on the air.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.880]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:46.880]  Good, what are you doing over in the Czech Republic?
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.200]  My family is actually from this country.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.480]  We're some Chexans, I guess you could call us.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.480]  We immigrated over to Texas during the 60's.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.400]  Oh cool, cool.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.040]  And I'm actually a land owner in Texas and it looks like the North American Union, which
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.720]  anniversary is today, is going to take that land.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:10.840]  But I guess, so I don't know what to do about it.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:14.340]  But anyway, what I wanted to call you about was, is that I wanted to tell you that when
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.960]  I left the States back in September, I actually lived in Ukraine for a long time and I'm going
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.960]  to call in.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.680]  What I wanted to call you about was that as I was boarding the plane, this was during
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:29.680]  the liquid bomber plot thing that was going on and a Homeland Security agent, he stopped
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.080]  me and he said, sir, may I see your document?
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.800]  And the only other country that this happened to me in was in Russia.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.480]  And so I gave him my passport because I wanted to get out.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.000]  And so he looked at my passport and he said, Mr. Brim, why are you leaving us here in the
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.160]  United States?
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:51.000]  And I was like, oh my God, am I seriously being asked this question?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.560]  And I told him tourism and he asked it again, I said, tourism, and then he let me board
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.560]  the plane.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]  So I just wanted to tell you that.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.960]  Well, it's part of freedom.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:04.560]  Now you can come into the country easy, but leaving is hard.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.560]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:10.960]  You don't have to have ID cards to get bank accounts, but you do.
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:16.480]  The only other country that that's happened to me in is Russia.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.840]  Land of the coward, home of the slaves.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.760]  It's really sad to see it happen.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:27.120]  Listen, the guys running this country want to have you to live under total Jack Buddhism.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.200]  And they think they're going to get away with it, my friend, they're not.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.120]  But I heard a lot of folks are waking up to the new world order over in the Czech Republic,
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120]  though.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.920]  Oh, everyone knows about it overseas.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.120]  Everyone knows that 9-11 was an inside job.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.120]  Like when I lived in Ukraine, I was a teacher over in Ukraine and I would tell my students
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.240]  this and I would be like, oh yeah, we know, we know.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.560]  Everyone overseas knows that it's a complete fraud and inside job.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:56.200]  And they're so confused as to why the American people, who they actually have respect for,
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.160]  they don't have respect for the American government, but they have respect for the American people
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.320]  and they're just confused as to why we don't see it.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.020]  Well that's because it scared the American people and tell them it's scarier when you
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.000]  actually live in the country that did it.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.520]  Run by the people that did it.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.520]  It's like a lot of people couldn't recognize Hitler living under him because they couldn't
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.520]  face it.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.520]  Or under Stalin.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.520]  But listen, good to hear from you, Kyle, call back again.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.520]  Matt in Florida, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.520]  Hello?
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:28.520]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.520]  Yeah, hi, how you doing, Alex?
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.520]  Good, sir.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.520]  I would like to bring attention to your callers and yourself.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.520]  A guy named Kent Hoven, he's a pastor.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.520]  He travels around the country and he debates evolution versus creation.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.520]  Uh-huh.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.520]  I know who he is.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.520]  And I know you talked about that briefly last week, and I just wanted to let you know
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.520]  that the IRS has given Kent Hoven 10 years in prison.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.520]  I actually believe, he's in Florida.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.520]  I think I've interviewed him a couple times.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520]  Oh, really?
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.520]  That's the fellow that was from Florida, right?
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.520]  Right.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.520]  He had a museum.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.520]  He does the same thing, yeah, he's Dr. Dino.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.520]  Yeah, no, I've interviewed him.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.520]  He does the same thing with the videos that you do.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.520]  He puts them out for free, on and on.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.520]  Anybody that would like to check out dangers of evolution, I think that's the one I'd like
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.520]  to recommend.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:19.520]  Yeah, all I was saying is that I don't get into how God made things, and I'm not going
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.520]  to sit around and have arguments about this all day.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:25.520]  I'm going to go out and fight government child kidnapping rings.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:30.520]  And then somebody called in and said, what, you're saying you don't believe that it's
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.520]  6,000 years old?
[00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.520]  And I said, well, that's another preacher saying that.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.520]  And I just said, I'm not going to get into the whole debate, okay?
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.520]  And that's all I was saying, because most Christians I know do nothing but fight over
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.520]  evolution, all day long.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.520]  And I guess it's safe for them to do that, and that's fine.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:57.520]  But that really is about half worship Israel, the other half worship the fight over how
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:59.520]  old the earth is.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.520]  And I just think Christians ought to be involved in what the Founding Fathers were, you know,
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:09.520]  those that weren't under Beelzebub's complete tutelage, and actually fight some tyranny.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.520]  Stand up against some corruption.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.520]  Stand up for the widows and orphans.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.520]  I know God's real.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.520]  I don't have to debate God all day with a bunch of fruitcakes, okay?
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:21.520]  I can look in the stars at night and tell you that this didn't pop into existence out
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.520]  of nothing.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.520]  I can look at a human cell and tell you that.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:30.520]  I mean, the way they say evolution works is that a pocket watch in the middle of a desert
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.520]  blew together out of sand.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.520]  We know it's bull.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.520]  But then to have all these, there's a bunch of, and I'm not saying Dr. Dono is, but these
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.520]  kooky preachers over here going, I ain't no monkey.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.520]  I ain't come from no monkey.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.520]  Well, nobody's saying you came from a monkey.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:47.520]  They're saying that you're along the same genetic line, which, you know, some of the
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.520]  genetics is the same.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:51.520]  I share genetics with a dog, because the same creator made us.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.520]  Anything else?
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.520]  Also, yeah, I want to ask you, whenever the time comes for the national ID card, what
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.520]  are we all supposed to do whenever we refuse it?
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520]  That's your decision.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.520]  That's your decision.
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.520]  You already have a national ID card.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:07.520]  Your state driver's license was federally standardized many years ago.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.520]  They tell you it's coming as a trick, so you don't know you already have it.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.520]  Okay, let's just boil it down to the way it works.
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:16.520]  Thanks for the call.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:17.520]  What are you going to do?
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.520]  I don't know.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:24.520]  I know when some slack-jawed teenager asks me for my, when I'm paying for cash for a
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:30.520]  fishing rod or underwear or shaving cream at the store, and I go, no.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.520]  They go, well, it's just for marketing.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.520]  I go, yeah, and you've got to pay me for that.
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:38.520]  I'm here doing you a favor by buying your slack-jawed junk and announce I want your
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520]  phone number.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520]  Oh, I want you to give me this.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.520]  I want you to answer a question.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.520]  No.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:47.520]  I've tried to buy stuff before at a computer store, and they want my name and stuff and
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.520]  ID when I'm buying cash.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:50.520]  No.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.520]  The guy got smart, and I walked out.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.520]  They were chasing me down the street going, come back.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.520]  It's OK.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:55.520]  And I said, get the hell.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.520]  Excuse me.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520]  I said, get out of my face.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.520]  OK?
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.520]  I'm not buying your garbage.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.520]  That's how you behave with these people.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.520]  All right.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:08.520]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.520]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Illinois.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520]  Or no, it was Bill.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.520]  I'm all out of control here.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:16.520]  Who's up?
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.520]  Lucas in Texas, then Bill.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.520]  Jeff.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.520]  Go ahead.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.520]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.520]  And I also appreciate you putting my documentary trailer for The Ultimate Con up.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:33.520]  It's gotten a huge response and an overwhelming amount of people that like it.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.520]  I wanted to thank you for all that.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.520]  And also, I know that you guys are really working hard down there.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.520]  I actually lived in Corpus before, and I moved to Austin for the sole purpose of getting
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.520]  more involved in this because it's more of a protest town.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:51.520]  Corpus is really not very protest-y at all.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:54.520]  All that goes on in Corpus Christi is worshipping Waterburger.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.520]  Oh, yeah, worshipping Waterburger and gang activity.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.520]  But what I wanted to say was I am willing to come down and donate maybe 10, 15 hours
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:04.520]  of my free time to help you out.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.520]  I got a lot of computer experience and a lot of experience with it.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:07.520]  Sure.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:08.520]  Listen, listen.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.520]  Here's the deal.
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:10.520]  I don't have a big enough office for that yet.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:13.520]  I don't have the funds to get a bigger office properly for that.
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.520]  And then I don't have the time to tell people what to do.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:21.520]  I need to stop everything and for six months build an infrastructure and an architecture
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:27.520]  to be able to manage things and properly use all the great people that want to help us.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:32.520]  But it's just so much of what I do, I have to do.
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:33.520]  But I mean, I do need help.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.520]  And the problem is I like to pay people, too.
[00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:39.520]  I don't like to just have people volunteer, and then I don't have the capital to hire
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.520]  the people I need.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.520]  So the biggest thing listeners can do is go to Infowars.com and get TerrorStorm, get
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:51.520]  Marshall Law, get the new video we're carrying, get my films, make copies, get them out to
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.520]  people.
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.520]  Make your own film.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.520]  You know, you're making a film.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:55.520]  You put a trailer out.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.520]  We link to it.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:57.520]  We're here to build everybody up.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.520]  You see, that's how you help me as being a leader, starting your own organization, fighting
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.520]  the new world order.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.520]  Because that's the pattern we're trying.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.520]  But I mean, I'm glad you live in Austin, sir.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.520]  At a time in the future, I may be able to use some help.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:18.520]  It's just that, I mean, just send me an email and we'll put it in the file of people that
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.520]  want to help.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.520]  I appreciate your call.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.520]  Look, I got to, we'll take more of your calls here in a few minutes, but I've got to get
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.520]  to this next audio clip.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]  I can't play it all.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.520]  Here is Glenn Beck calling Rosie O'Donnell all sorts of names.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.520]  Now, the point is you can call her names if you want.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.520]  I think I did a few years ago on some other issues.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:34.520]  Gun control.
[00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.520]  But she's silly and she's ignorant, but she's got guts and guts is enough, as they say
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:40.520]  in Full Metal Jacket.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.520]  Private Rosie is silly and ignorant, but she's got guts and guts is enough.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.520]  You're fired, scumbag.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.520]  Rosie O'Donnell, you're promoted to squad leader.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.520]  Disappear.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.520]  All right, but anyways, man's silly there.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:53.520]  She's got courage.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.520]  She has nothing to gain out of this but freedom.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.520]  You know it freaks her out to know it's an inside job.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.520]  Charlie Sheen went through hell over what he did.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.520]  And you can nitpick their past.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.520]  Nobody's perfect, folks.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:03.520]  The point is they're being good now.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.520]  They're doing the right thing now.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.520]  And I happen to know for a fact she knows all about the New World Order now.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.520]  Rosie's had her paradigm massively shifted.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:13.520]  Not completely, but she's coming over to our way.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.520]  Okay, she's coming over to us.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.520]  We need to understand that.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.520]  I mean, look at the two thieves hanging on the cross by Christ.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.520]  It's never too late to turn back, folks.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:32.520]  And people like sniveling pasty-skinned little chicken necks like Glenn Beck.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.520]  I mean, he's a disgusting little creature.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.520]  Here he is.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:41.520]  You have Rosie O'Donnell coming out this week on her blog saying that the United States government
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:48.520]  took down World Trade Center number seven to cover, I think it was for Halliburton and Ron, one of those companies.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.520]  She's making that charge.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:36:00.520]  How is that a mainstream point of view in America that shouldn't have a very strong balance to it in that program or another program?
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:06.520]  Well, frankly, I don't care what happens on The View because I only seem to see clips of it when Danny DeVito comes on drunk
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.520]  or when Rosie does something outrageous.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.520]  What I have a problem with is what this represents for the broader left.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.520]  And I think you're right.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:17.520]  This conspiratorial mindset is very problematic because how can you engage in a debate with someone
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.520]  when you are going from facts and they are going from their own facts, right?
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:23.520]  They have this world view.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:28.520]  They name-call, they say they have facts, and they say our facts are lies.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.520]  No, we have the facts.
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520]  We have the evidence.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.520]  We've put it on.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520]  That's why you're losing.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.520]  Folks, I see fear in all their faces because their ratings are plunging.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.520]  No one's watching them.
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.520]  No one believes them anymore.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.520]  And people are looking at the facts.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.520]  Yahoo, here it is.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.520]  They are going from facts, and they are going from their own facts, right?
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.520]  They have this world view that's made up out of whole cloth, this fictional mythology.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:56.520]  Well, you can't have a debate where you're taking facts and they're taking storybook time.
[00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:57.520]  Okay, stop right there.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.520]  Fictional mythology.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.520]  I mean, the 9-11 narrative within 20 minutes, they said the world's changed.
[00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.520]  Your freedoms are gone.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.520]  It's a new world order.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.520]  Everything's different now.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.520]  Everything will be different.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.520]  This is the new foundation of Earth.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.520]  Every decision you ever make will be off this.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.520]  It's all over.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.520]  We've got to torture.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.520]  And it's a total mythology.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.520]  Your official story is the biggest conspiracy theory of it all.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.520]  Continue with the Chicken Next program.
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.520]  Taking storybook time.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:31.520]  It doesn't work.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.520]  And then, when you can't have a debate, you end up getting fights.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.520]  And the civility and discourse is gone.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.520]  And I think it's tragic that we're seeing that.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.520]  We've only got 30 seconds.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.520]  Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore now being discredited by the left.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.520]  Al Gore, I think, is going to become the next Cindy Sheehan.
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.520]  Cindy Sheehan was discredited.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:59.520]  How long does Rosie O'Donnell keep her credibility when she's saying conspiracy theories about 9-11 and everything else?
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.520]  You lost me, Glenn, when you said Rosie O'Donnell has credibility.
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.520]  She has.
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.520]  I'm telling you, mainstream people watch The View and they think she's funny.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]  Yeah, I guess they think she's funny.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:14.520]  But do you think many of these people who are watching a daytime television are taking their political cues from her?
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:16.520]  That's the scary thing about it.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.520]  I mean that as a serious comment.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.520]  Maybe a few.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520]  But I don't know.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.520]  I think you're right.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.520]  The war mom, they were really excited about her.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:26.520]  And then, of course, it turns out that, yeah, she's a little nuts.
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.520]  All right, Joel, thanks.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:30.520]  Okay, now did you hear all that?
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.520]  They repeat it.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.520]  It's all sophomoric.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.520]  It's a formula.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.520]  You're nuts, you're nuts, you're nuts, you're nuts.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.520]  You're not the mainstream.
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:39.520]  The mainstream of people, don't listen to them.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.520]  The mainstream isn't into this.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.520]  The mainstream is against it.
[00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:45.520]  You'll be looked down on.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.520]  That's a message to all of you not to speak up and not to get involved.
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:53.520]  That's a message to you that, oh, the sheep are all going in this direction.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.520]  The school of minnows, the school of sardines are all swimming in this direction.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.520]  The school of lemmings are running off this particular parapet.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:05.520]  I mean, just look at it.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.520]  It's all psychological base mindlessness.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.520]  I have another clip of her, of him talking about her.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.520]  We call her a fat witch.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.520]  So I guess there's more Glenn Beck or something.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.520]  Oh, that one's ready too.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.520]  We don't have time to get to it.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.520]  Okay, I'll just make sure I did hear that yesterday.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.520]  I thought I was going crazy.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.520]  So you do have that.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.520]  Well, maybe after the next break if we have time, we'll play it.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.520]  But I mean, these are tactics.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.520]  Do you like tactics being used against you?
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.520]  I mean, I don't have to sit here and formulate tactics.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.520]  I just come on the air, cover the news, let it all hang out.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.520]  Just a normal person who sees the tyranny and I'm going to fight it.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.520]  I'm threatened by it.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.520]  You bet I've got my hackles up.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.520]  You bet I've got my eyes bulging out.
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:51.520]  Because I'm in war mode here, folks.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.520]  I know these people are killers.
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.520]  And they've got a bunch of little soft wimps running around cheerleading them.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.520]  People who rose in society because they were yes men and, you know,
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.520]  polished boots with their tongues and their lips.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:05.520]  I mean, I'm not going to be part of this.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.520]  And they're scared now.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.520]  I mean, you can look at Glenn Beck.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.520]  He's scared.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.520]  All of them are scared.
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:11.520]  And you can look.
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.520]  I mean, they are scared.
