[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:40.400]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.400 --> 00:46.080]  Tuesday the 26th day of June 2012 we're going to be here for the next three
[00:46.080 --> 00:51.680]  hours this Saturday I came in to do a taped interview with the founder of
[00:51.680 --> 00:57.920]  smashing pumpkins Billy Corrigan and I had obviously interviewed Billy before
[00:57.920 --> 01:06.400]  on air and it was extremely informative and interesting Billy's been a
[01:06.400 --> 01:13.680]  listener for many years and he's got a new album out that's a hit Oceania but
[01:13.680 --> 01:18.320]  I did this interview Saturday and it was basically the Billy Corrigan I talked
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.720]  to off air because I never pushed him to ask him controversial questions and
[01:22.720 --> 01:28.160]  things because it's not my job to try to get you know famous people in political
[01:28.160 --> 01:33.640]  hot water the Charlie Sheen thing that happened was because I was getting
[01:33.640 --> 01:37.280]  Charlie on to talk about how I've been at his house for a week and he was off
[01:37.280 --> 01:45.280]  drugs and the media was lying and then he went to the Bahamas with his girlfriend
[01:45.280 --> 01:52.720]  girlfriends and ex-wife things blew up and I had no idea that five minutes
[01:52.720 --> 01:59.960]  before he came on my show there was a big argument blow-up and brickmuller had
[01:59.960 --> 02:04.640]  been thrown off the island on putback on the jet and and he said I'll still come
[02:04.640 --> 02:11.120]  on and came on in the middle of a rage and that's what happened there that's
[02:11.120 --> 02:16.320]  what happened with that meltdown that quite frankly I'm ashamed of I wish that
[02:16.320 --> 02:24.360]  that never would have happened on my show because it made the Sheen family
[02:24.360 --> 02:29.160]  angry at me and I they were the ones that actually turned Charlie on to my
[02:29.160 --> 02:32.520]  show I'll just leave it at that and I know them very very well and they're not
[02:32.520 --> 02:36.640]  mad at me now but they they certainly were for a while and I understand why
[02:36.640 --> 02:40.920]  they were mad at me when I'm talking about this now the point is I digress
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.360]  off into issues that Charlie Sheen trainwreck was not my intention now the
[02:45.360 --> 02:48.560]  interview you're gonna hear with Billy Corrigan we're gonna air it in the third
[02:48.560 --> 02:53.920]  hour today it is not a trainwreck in fact it's incredibly cogent and focused
[02:53.920 --> 02:58.600]  and intelligent but he says more about politics and things than I've ever heard
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.080]  him say in the interview and believe me it will be newsmaking I will leave it I
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.160]  will leave it at that he's now in South America doing a big concert tour he left
[03:08.160 --> 03:11.600]  Sunday again I came in here Saturday because you know he said he wanted to
[03:11.600 --> 03:14.360]  come on my show right when his album came out I kind of forgot the album was
[03:14.360 --> 03:19.480]  coming out and then notice he was doing interviews and so I called him up and he
[03:19.480 --> 03:23.200]  said yeah I'm totally booked except for 8 a.m. in the morning on Friday or
[03:23.200 --> 03:32.120]  Saturday at noon his time so we got Billy Corrigan of smashing pumpkins on
[03:32.120 --> 03:38.520]  the broadcast well we taped it and so that is coming up it's about 45 minutes
[03:38.520 --> 03:43.680]  long and I was gonna tape it and edited it so that it could be aired on the
[03:43.680 --> 03:50.640]  radio in its segments but actually went over with him some so society issue I
[03:50.640 --> 03:55.240]  just got on this morning and realize it didn't fit the broadcast segment so I'll
[03:55.240 --> 03:59.000]  be throwing it to break you know to the music but we really won't be point is
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.440]  I'm kind of strategizing radio here on the air total transparency not even on
[04:03.440 --> 04:06.640]  purpose the reason there's so much transparency here is we were so busy we
[04:06.640 --> 04:12.920]  have to plan things on the fly as we go Marcos Morales put together the piece
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.360]  it's a video piece with graphics and music and things radio listeners will
[04:17.360 --> 04:23.160]  hear the high-def audio but prison planet dot TV viewers will be able to see
[04:23.160 --> 04:27.920]  much of it coming up on the video streams at prison planet dot TV and
[04:27.920 --> 04:32.560]  when you are a member there's a 15-day free trial oh I hear music from the
[04:32.560 --> 04:36.800]  predator Jesse Ventura who was almost a few weeks ago he's back on because of
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.680]  all the controversies out there and the EAS system cutting in over him when he's
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.560]  on shows and I've confirmed from program directors it's happening with our show
[04:45.560 --> 04:49.400]  but not on all stations and it's happening with Eric Muller mancow baller
[04:49.400 --> 04:53.960]  and so we're gonna talk about that and a lot more with Jesse Ventura and then

[08:32.240 --> 08:39.000]  interview I did this weekend and it is sensational politically a very cogent
[08:39.000 --> 08:47.840]  very focused and he covers it all GMO drones TSA how he loves info wars.com
[08:47.840 --> 08:52.960]  now he loves the drudge report.com it is certainly interesting and how his
[08:52.960 --> 08:58.880]  last big hit album was inspired greatly by info wars and my radio show and the
[08:58.880 --> 09:05.320]  new album but politically it is explosive and I didn't ask him about
[09:05.320 --> 09:09.200]  Jessica Simpson and things like that but I asked him about everything else that
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.440]  is coming up Billy Corrigan and then live Jesse Ventura gotta get him all you
[09:14.440 --> 09:20.480]  can he spends half a year down in Mexico reading books and surfing kind of a
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.840]  priestly pious existence he's been back he of course came on with us first a few
[09:25.840 --> 09:32.640]  weeks ago now he's been through some big scuff ups on CNN CNBC you name it we're
[09:32.640 --> 09:36.280]  gonna be breaking that down the fact that when he's been on syndicated radio
[09:36.280 --> 09:40.600]  shows and talks about FEMA camps the feed gets scrambled I've confirmed this
[09:40.600 --> 09:45.840]  is going on a very bizarre of course they announced and guys this isn't
[09:45.840 --> 09:51.360]  yesterday's stack it was our top story I never got to it the White House says the
[09:51.360 --> 09:57.920]  quote president's emergency alerts will quote follow you around that was the
[09:57.920 --> 10:02.040]  headline and I never even got to that on air that now they're announcing oh yes
[10:02.040 --> 10:06.400]  it's gonna have its own ringtone and if you're on the phone with somebody else
[10:06.400 --> 10:09.880]  is gonna cut you off or if you're surfing the internet or doing something
[10:09.880 --> 10:13.880]  business-wise or whatever the shopping whatever the case is there's just gonna
[10:13.880 --> 10:18.160]  cut you off there's gonna be a presidential announcement at you and
[10:18.160 --> 10:21.600]  they're gonna expand this down to local announcements just government takeover of
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.320]  not just radio TV cable the satellites you know a racing stuff off the TVO that
[10:26.320 --> 10:29.720]  they don't want you to see oh you know you record something on a live news feed
[10:29.720 --> 10:34.000]  you're like oh I have a TVO or you are on your DVR no you don't they give an
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.320]  order hit one button and it erases it throughout the entire grid this is all
[10:38.320 --> 10:41.920]  the backdoor garbage that the system admits they've built in so I'm gonna get
[10:41.920 --> 10:48.640]  into that today if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek there it is DHS
[10:48.640 --> 10:53.000]  Shelf on Alert system follows you around that's a quote by DHS presidential
[10:53.000 --> 10:58.960]  messages to have their own distinctive ringtone it's like a like a dystopic
[10:58.960 --> 11:05.200]  Woody Allen science fiction nightmare or meets Ray Kurzweil in hell and then on
[11:05.200 --> 11:10.000]  top of it add a little bit of Kurt Vonnegut and Running Man and THX 1138
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.440]  and 1984 and Brave New World and add in a smattering of Hellraiser and
[11:16.440 --> 11:21.120]  Amityville horror and you've got the New World Order I guess with the GMO
[11:21.120 --> 11:26.320]  mutations the thing John Carpenter's the thing
[11:28.240 --> 11:34.800]  turkey threatens to attack Syria you know again I keep mentioning this but I
[11:34.800 --> 11:44.040]  want to pull the articles up guys type in Bush wanted to paint up US jet like UN
[11:44.040 --> 11:50.360]  aircraft Bush wanted to paint up US jet like UN aircraft that'll bring it up it
[11:50.360 --> 11:53.880]  was declassified well it was leaked in the White House and Downing Street but
[11:53.880 --> 11:57.280]  most but then later confirmed and Tony Blair and him were getting together
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.360]  saying we could paint up US aircraft fly them real low and say that their UN
[12:02.360 --> 12:06.280]  aircraft meaning the UN would have to be in on it and then have them shot down as
[12:06.280 --> 12:10.320]  a way in 2002 when they were trying to sell the attack on Iraq they got it
[12:10.320 --> 12:15.160]  obviously in March of the next year and I've seen a bunch of other cases of this
[12:15.160 --> 12:20.080]  where governments fly their aircraft low are in the airspace trying to get them
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.640]  shot down and now Turkey who's got reportedly nuclear weapons ladies and
[12:25.640 --> 12:29.600]  gentlemen just like South Africa does but that's not publicly admitted or
[12:29.600 --> 12:34.280]  Israel they are they've got a lot bigger military than Syria very high tech
[12:34.280 --> 12:39.240]  they're saying that they'll fly their F-16s wherever they want and that if they
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.480]  shoot any more F-16s down it's war when they're doing their bombing runs and
[12:44.480 --> 12:50.880]  they've come out and they've said that if Syria gets any of its troops anywhere
[12:50.880 --> 12:55.200]  near the border and Syria is a very small country like Israel a little bit
[12:55.200 --> 13:00.280]  bigger that if they get anywhere near their own border they will be attacked
[13:00.280 --> 13:06.960]  you add to this Steve Watson's got the headline this is big news military
[13:06.960 --> 13:12.600]  source British commandos operating in Syria Assad compound under siege I have
[13:12.600 --> 13:17.560]  military sources four months ago here on air who talked about the fact that
[13:17.560 --> 13:25.600]  you've got in Turkey and you've got built up in border areas with Jordan
[13:25.600 --> 13:31.160]  Marines and army mashing and that they're arming Taliban slash Al Qaeda which
[13:31.160 --> 13:35.120]  is admitted I mean that part's admitted and sending them in and they're blowing
[13:35.120 --> 13:39.240]  up police stations military bases you name it you know they landed a few
[13:39.240 --> 13:43.680]  thousand of them in Tripoli at night led by British other Arab countries as well
[13:43.680 --> 13:52.360]  US commandos that's all now been confirmed in Libya and of course they
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.400]  actually wear black uniforms with the Al Qaeda patch that's even been in the
[13:56.400 --> 14:01.120]  London Guardian and LA Times you can just type it Al Qaeda flag over Libya Al
[14:01.120 --> 14:07.520]  Qaeda flag Al Qaeda uniforms in Libya now Al Qaeda flags and uniforms in Syria and
[14:07.520 --> 14:13.720]  right after Libya fell it was on BBC we played the clip here it showed them
[14:13.720 --> 14:19.240]  holding up signs in Al Qaeda uniforms with Al Qaeda flags the Al Qaeda
[14:19.240 --> 14:22.480]  uniforms a black uniform just jet black with a patch on the side when they get
[14:22.480 --> 14:30.120]  in uniform saying saying Syria here we come in English on the news so again I'm
[14:30.120 --> 14:35.400]  no fan of Muammar Gaddafi I'm no fan of Assad I'm no fan of you know any of these
[14:35.400 --> 14:42.360]  guys but is anybody noticing that there was actually a White House slash British
[14:42.360 --> 14:46.520]  plan yeah there it is London Telegraph Libya Al Qaeda flag flown above Benghazi
[14:46.520 --> 14:51.400]  courthouse you can also type in for new listeners that may be doubting this you
[14:51.400 --> 14:56.280]  can just type in Al Qaeda uniforms Al Qaeda patches in Syria I mean they're on
[14:56.280 --> 15:02.520]  the news leading the operations in black uniforms okay continuing is usually the
[15:02.520 --> 15:06.880]  Islamists's outfits are you know green but Al Qaeda or is black their flag is
[15:06.880 --> 15:13.320]  black continuing military source British commandos operating in Syria Assad
[15:13.320 --> 15:18.880]  compound under siege reports suggest Western military intervention in full
[15:18.880 --> 15:26.000]  swing yeah they're they're moving in Turkey and in other areas like Jordan
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.680]  moving troops up to the border that's the debacle file which is basically Mossad
[15:32.680 --> 15:38.000]  well I found be very accurate in the past reporting that French British and
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.160]  Turkish military sources have suggested the elite British soldiers have entered
[15:43.160 --> 15:46.840]  northern Syria and are operating 10 kilometers inside the country well it's
[15:46.840 --> 15:52.360]  admitted they're inside Iran right now to lazing targets marking targets really
[15:52.360 --> 15:57.480]  GPS not so much lazing the country in what is thought to be the first offensive
[15:57.480 --> 16:02.600]  Western intervention against the Assad regime and of course you've seen on the
[16:02.600 --> 16:07.360]  news McCain calling for boots on the ground Lieberman all these all this
[16:07.360 --> 16:12.880]  talk and then we see the bots on info wars.com and prison planet.com in the
[16:12.880 --> 16:19.200]  comments saying hey there's nothing gonna happen over there your conspiracy
[16:19.200 --> 16:23.040]  theorist kind of like we were conspiracy theorist six months before the fall of
[16:23.040 --> 16:26.360]  Libya saying it's an air bombardment its military attack or using Al Qaeda
[16:26.360 --> 16:29.440]  they're slaughtering the blacks that was all later admitted by the way this
[16:29.440 --> 16:33.440]  happens every few months with the caching servers get screwed up at info
[16:33.440 --> 16:39.080]  wars.com or prison planet.com and it doesn't post most of your comments just a
[16:39.080 --> 16:44.680]  program note here and I couldn't post I don't usually post in comments very
[16:44.680 --> 16:48.720]  often but this morning I was doing testing I couldn't post it the servers
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.680]  are screwed up some people are able to get comments posted but you see articles
[16:52.680 --> 16:57.600]  that would normally have 200 300 400 comments you know their top stories in
[16:57.600 --> 17:01.440]  just a few hours I'll have like 15 comments it's screwed up no one's
[17:01.440 --> 17:05.720]  censoring you as we got email and comments pouring into the other sites
[17:05.720 --> 17:09.920]  saying hey I'm just talking about stuff and you're censoring me no the website's
[17:09.920 --> 17:15.600]  broken it's just like planet info wars.com is in beta it's got over 30,000
[17:15.600 --> 17:18.640]  members now we've barely promoted it because I wanted to beta test it before
[17:18.640 --> 17:22.360]  I really get behind promoting it it's a social network to get folks together for
[17:22.360 --> 17:28.960]  liberty it's on cloud servers and CDNs and because a big site like that you have
[17:28.960 --> 17:32.440]  to have it spread out because I don't know how to explain it but we've had IT
[17:32.440 --> 17:37.560]  consultants you name it if one server crashes suddenly sometimes your site
[17:37.560 --> 17:41.360]  disappears your page and then we re-upload it okay so that's not on
[17:41.360 --> 17:47.040]  purpose either that's why it's in beta it's not a conspiracy theory planet
[17:47.040 --> 17:53.440]  info wars.com side issue just thought I would mention to people that I see this
[17:53.440 --> 17:57.000]  most often because we have caching servers everything can't be live
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.520]  constantly on the site every time somebody does a function or it or it
[18:01.520 --> 18:05.200]  screws the side up is what's been explained to me by IT people so there's
[18:05.200 --> 18:09.520]  a caching whereas it's only showing you the new comments every five minutes I
[18:09.520 --> 18:12.800]  think's what it's said at so a group of them go in they're not even in moderation
[18:12.800 --> 18:17.720]  they sit there and then the server goes through a function and posts them because
[18:17.720 --> 18:21.360]  if you've got thousands of people at once posting on a site and every time
[18:21.360 --> 18:25.400]  they do it it's a whole new function it screws it up so it goes to servers that
[18:25.400 --> 18:29.480]  just handle the comments it splits up the demand you understand it's like a
[18:29.480 --> 18:34.280]  balancing act and so it sends them off to those servers and then they batch it
[18:34.280 --> 18:39.760]  and then post it that's what's going on that's what's happening you Google and
[18:39.760 --> 18:43.480]  YouTube their subcompany have been caught censoring for real that's on record
[18:43.480 --> 18:46.880]  they've admitted the government's told them to do it before they've taken our
[18:46.880 --> 18:51.160]  videos down before they've done all sorts of stuff but it's not censorship when
[18:51.160 --> 18:57.360]  YouTube you see a video that's got 2,000 comments and 500 likes you know 20
[18:57.360 --> 19:00.920]  dislikes or whatever and it says 301 viewers people are like well there's
[19:00.920 --> 19:05.360]  more than 301 viewers that's because when you first upload a video it goes the
[19:05.360 --> 19:10.640]  way I've tech people have told me it goes up to one server and then once the
[19:10.640 --> 19:15.840]  video starts going viral it's distributed over a CDN or cloud system
[19:15.840 --> 19:21.360]  and so then it has to update then and it can't be updating the counts in
[19:21.360 --> 19:27.000]  live time or it would shut the system down so it has to batch them and then
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.080]  shove them out as as the batching process goes through now I've really
[19:32.080 --> 19:35.520]  digressed you know we've got what could lead to World War 3 happening Russian
[19:35.520 --> 19:42.760]  ships landing with Spetsnaz marine special forces high-tech weapons systems
[19:42.760 --> 19:47.320]  being shipped in and now our government that CNBC says has been captured and
[19:47.320 --> 19:52.080]  run by foreign banks don't forget that yesterday now is going in there and the

[24:24.040 --> 24:29.760]  happening in fact guys will you queue up the CNBC video again that we played
[24:29.760 --> 24:35.360]  yesterday I'm gonna play the intro of that for four minutes on the video that's
[24:35.360 --> 24:40.360]  up at info wars.com I think it's huge news on the Cudlow report the host and
[24:40.360 --> 24:45.040]  the guest all agree the US is run by foreign banks that it's a world
[24:45.040 --> 24:50.200]  government but then they basically say they know best though so yes we're run
[24:50.200 --> 24:58.400]  by foreign banks we are slaves absolutely of the big mega banks in fact
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.040]  here is a clip of that because I want to point something out here people say
[25:02.040 --> 25:06.880]  well hey you got a back the attack on the Russian back forces in Syria your
[25:06.880 --> 25:11.560]  pro America aren't you really America is supposed to go put al-Qaeda into Syria
[25:11.560 --> 25:17.360]  and a bunch of other jihadis to try to overthrow Assad when al-Qaeda and these
[25:17.360 --> 25:22.760]  Muslim groups are on record where are all you guys that love to hate Muslims
[25:22.760 --> 25:26.520]  well these are the real the real extremists oh you just want to hate all
[25:26.520 --> 25:32.920]  general Muslims and then actually support the CIA and MI6 and others backing
[25:32.920 --> 25:38.120]  al-Qaeda because they've shed on record in fact I'm gonna cover this on the
[25:38.120 --> 25:42.080]  nightly news tonight I'm gonna get the articles and video clips pulled together
[25:42.080 --> 25:46.560]  from Libya and Syria and the al-Qaeda statements and the jihadi statements not
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.800]  just al-Qaeda they're part of it who say they're gonna kill every Jew in Syria
[25:50.800 --> 25:56.960]  they're gonna kill every Jew in Syria kill them where's our media on that and
[25:56.960 --> 26:01.120]  that they're going to force all the Christians out of one of the oldest
[26:01.120 --> 26:06.880]  Christian settlements in the world just as old as Bethlehem just as old as
[26:06.880 --> 26:14.200]  Jerusalem Christianity day one in Syria day one in Syria day one in Syria 2000
[26:14.200 --> 26:22.600]  plus years old Christianity gone and they put the Muslim Brotherhood and a
[26:22.600 --> 26:27.320]  bunch of al-Qaeda supporters and they've declared military dictatorship with a
[26:27.320 --> 26:34.200]  puppet president that Hillary has worshipped here's the free beacon wall
[26:34.200 --> 26:39.000]  should Congress person from Illinois cut aid to Egypt representative calls for
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.240]  aid reduction after election here's world that daily Hillary tied to new
[26:44.240 --> 26:49.520]  Muslim Brotherhood president and it goes over all that this is the plan folks
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.360]  you're told give all your rights up because of al-Qaeda and it's what I've
[26:53.360 --> 26:57.720]  always told you al-Qaeda was created by the State Department the CIA you're
[26:57.720 --> 27:02.240]  like the CIA is our government no no it's not it represents Wall Street itself
[27:02.240 --> 27:06.480]  owned by foreign banks the sooner you figure that out this is the bankers
[27:06.480 --> 27:14.360]  using our military to try to overthrow Syria and put something in literally 50
[27:14.360 --> 27:19.880]  times worse the difference is is that the globalists will destabilize Syria
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.600]  they will they will put in the al-Qaeda people and then have a war knocking them
[27:24.600 --> 27:28.960]  out again it's just keep the area destabilized keep those people in
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.880]  squalor don't let them industrialize because you don't want anybody who is
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.280]  self-sufficient just like the policy of our so-called government is to shut down
[27:38.280 --> 27:42.040]  General Motors it's to shut down our power plants I have a news here today
[27:42.040 --> 27:45.320]  where they're saying Texas won't be able to supply its power this summer
[27:45.320 --> 27:50.080]  because Obama has shut down a bunch of power plants we reported on that years
[27:50.080 --> 27:58.720]  ago the White House responded to it this is the mega banks who've hijacked our
[27:58.720 --> 28:04.800]  country who are launching these wars in Syria and other areas and now the
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.400]  Russians have the have their interests threatened and and and Mediathev and
[28:09.400 --> 28:13.040]  Putin have threatened to New Western Europe I mean that didn't happen during
[28:13.040 --> 28:18.920]  the Cold War Cheney and others launched that NATO attack in Georgia into the
[28:18.920 --> 28:24.960]  South Ossetia and Eucasia trying to start a war these people are crazy so
[28:24.960 --> 28:28.600]  again if the Russians were here taken over I'd be totally against them if the
[28:28.600 --> 28:31.480]  communist Chinese were I'd be totally against them to a certain extent their
[28:31.480 --> 28:35.840]  ally but the globalist so they are but what about the bankers they're the ones
[28:35.840 --> 28:39.280]  that captured our country and have set up the homeland security system to take
[28:39.280 --> 28:44.760]  over here they are on CNBC admitting it here it is so mostly what they do is
[28:44.760 --> 28:50.440]  hold summits I think that right now the question is do we all work for central
[28:50.440 --> 28:54.640]  bankers that's what I want to address to our guests tonight is this global
[28:54.640 --> 28:59.280]  governance at last is it one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio
[28:59.280 --> 29:04.360]  you say we've got some downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't
[29:04.360 --> 29:08.680]  we all just living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just
[29:08.680 --> 29:12.560]  counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke putt putt and that we won't go
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.360]  any lower than say five percent down from here of course we are because if we
[29:17.360 --> 29:21.000]  look at the economic data there's nothing to get excited about in that so we
[29:21.000 --> 29:25.120]  you know yesterday we saw some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand
[29:25.120 --> 29:28.160]  their balance sheets and pump more money in but the stock market knows that
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.200]  reluctance is is totally different than not willing to do it at all and that's
[29:32.200 --> 29:37.320]  why we saw oil and oil implode we're gonna come back because they go on to
[29:37.320 --> 29:41.600]  say we are quote absolutely slaves of foreign central banks and global
[29:41.600 --> 29:46.600]  government we'll be right back stay with us ladies and gentlemen
[29:46.600 --> 29:55.840]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:55.840 --> 30:03.400]  network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[30:03.400 --> 30:07.760]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:07.760 --> 30:11.920]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[30:11.920 --> 30:15.960]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.960 --> 30:19.840]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.120]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.280 --> 30:32.600]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.600 --> 30:36.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[30:36.320 --> 30:40.520]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[33:47.200 --> 33:51.960]  Homeland Security's busy doing trying to spy on good old boys who they see as
[33:51.960 --> 33:59.880]  their domestic threat so a very very serious time to be alive no doubt before
[33:59.880 --> 34:05.920]  we get back into all of that news dreams from my real father by Joel Gilbert
[34:05.920 --> 34:10.800]  that shows a compelling case that his real father is Frank Marshall Davis and
[34:10.800 --> 34:14.680]  that his mother was involved in pornography and things like that I'll
[34:14.680 --> 34:17.920]  just leave it at that and and Obama admits he hung out with this guy as a
[34:17.920 --> 34:22.120]  child visiting weekly and you just got to see the evidence it's it's pretty
[34:22.120 --> 34:26.640]  darn strong looks just like him and then they've got Frank Marshall Davis on the
[34:26.640 --> 34:31.120]  same couch and interviews as is what looks like his mother posing naked I
[34:31.120 --> 34:38.120]  mean it's it's unbelievable now this is certainly political coffin nails to Mr.

[37:43.920 --> 37:47.640]  bookshelf since I first memories were pulling this out of the bookshelf my
[37:47.640 --> 37:50.400]  parents wouldn't let me watch a lot of television so I would just pull out books
[37:50.400 --> 37:54.080]  and look at the covers and you look at the science fiction covers and look at
[37:54.080 --> 37:57.640]  the Western covers and wanted to learn how to read because I could read Louis
[37:57.640 --> 38:04.480]  Lamour or whatever and so I started reading and red dish I think I think I
[38:04.480 --> 38:08.520]  probably this one I was 12 or 13 and really crystallized a lot for me

[39:31.280 --> 39:38.280]  anymore much less cover them this just came in military sources British

[39:49.520 --> 39:53.200]  North American Union that's a big article and more of those documents have
[39:53.200 --> 39:59.440]  come back come out whistleblower TSA deliberately hiring psychopath criminals
[39:59.440 --> 40:03.920]  and if I told you what happened yesterday after that guy was on you
[40:03.920 --> 40:13.560]  wouldn't believe it and when I do TSA whistleblowers again I kind of did it
[40:13.560 --> 40:18.680]  spontaneously yesterday we've got to not say what state you're calling from
[40:18.680 --> 40:23.160]  especially if you're calling from Rhode Island with one major commercial
[40:23.160 --> 40:28.640]  airport because they found out who he was and I called him after the show and
[40:28.640 --> 40:34.960]  then the phone rang and it was the TSA his boss and all Hades broke loose and
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.320]  I got the guy's name his info all of it he works there and haven't been able to
[40:40.320 --> 40:43.520]  talk to him since last night
[40:44.400 --> 40:49.160]  now now everything he told us we've already reverse engineered that the TSA
[40:49.160 --> 40:54.000]  is expanding outside the airports that they're hiring pedophiles criminals he
[40:54.000 --> 41:00.200]  gave me all the data on that I even recorded the interview he let me do it
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.280]  as the the TSA kept calling and calling and so they called and then they were
[41:04.280 --> 41:10.720]  there and him talking to him but I only got part of that I've got that on my
[41:10.720 --> 41:14.560]  iPhone we had on speakerphone in there in Tim's office Tim heard it all and the
[41:14.560 --> 41:17.040]  guy got real scared I was like yeah well you shouldn't have said you were in
[41:17.040 --> 41:23.760]  Rhode Island I mean they figured out who he was so we're gonna do it again but
[41:23.760 --> 41:29.080]  we're not gonna say where you're calling from and send us documents I'm gonna we've
[41:29.080 --> 41:33.440]  got what we have whistleblower and info wars.com don't we I had that set up a

[41:40.120 --> 41:43.640]  of our emails in here is the problem is I'm always trying to imagine okay yeah
[41:43.640 --> 41:48.720]  it's whistleblowers or is it whistleblowers or whistleblower it's both
[41:48.720 --> 41:55.000]  at info wars.com you can use you can use both great send it just just send it
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.880]  because look if they're if they are we know they're hiring criminals and they
[41:58.880 --> 42:02.680]  get caught and say oopsie oh hired a defrock priest oopsie hired a bank
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.800]  robber oopsie hired a you know guy that manslaughter oops hired a kleptomaniac
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.480]  now with 50 convictions or whatever for shoplifting oops no there's no oops
[42:12.480 --> 42:20.440]  about it Stalin Hitler they all did this and we got that job hiring document a
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.120]  few months ago out of Seattle that they pulled but it said we want you to be
[42:25.120 --> 42:31.680]  imperious and in their face imperious means you know godlike emperor like
[42:31.680 --> 42:36.880]  king like in people's face and that's what they do now before the TSA wasn't
[42:36.880 --> 42:39.560]  that mean a lot of more listeners saying hey it's just a job we're trying to
[42:39.560 --> 42:42.920]  unionize to stop this we don't want to grow up and a lot of TSA are getting
[42:42.920 --> 42:47.280]  in trouble for not wanting to grow up but now he was saying the last 20 plus
[42:47.280 --> 42:52.560]  hires have all been out of the state rehabilitation program and he gave me all
[42:52.560 --> 42:55.840]  the names of that fact let me just get to that a little bit later because I need
[42:55.840 --> 43:01.600]  to grab my notes but and I haven't recorded to folks but I have the guys
[43:01.600 --> 43:10.120]  name everything and it fits into everything we already know but when I do
[43:10.120 --> 43:18.280]  give the number out tomorrow or so to talk to TSA whistleblowers maybe we'll
[43:18.280 --> 43:22.520]  do it in the next segment in the short segment after that you've got to not say
[43:22.520 --> 43:26.880]  where you're calling from it's very very simple they're not gonna be able to
[43:26.880 --> 43:31.680]  identify you out of tens of thousands of employees you know if you call from
[43:31.680 --> 43:35.720]  Texas but you don't say Texas or you call from New York you don't say New
[43:35.720 --> 43:41.120]  York but this guy was involved in the hiring and the screening of him and was
[43:41.120 --> 43:44.880]  mad and off air he finally told me he was sick of it all he told his family
[43:44.880 --> 43:51.000]  who's involved in government I'm not doing this anymore and he didn't think
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.320]  before he called in and said I work at the Rhode Island Airport and went over
[43:55.320 --> 44:00.160]  it all because I mean he was there with his kids talking in the background and
[44:00.160 --> 44:03.320]  you know the phone was ring ring ring and then they got on the phone was talking
[44:03.320 --> 44:06.240]  to him on a cell phone and
[44:08.880 --> 44:13.440]  and I know when somebody's real I mean if this guy isn't real and he sent me
[44:13.440 --> 44:20.200]  some information then he is an he is the best Academy Award-winning best actor
[44:20.200 --> 44:24.800]  I've ever seen plus his whole story checks out it's hiding in plain view they
[44:24.800 --> 44:29.920]  grope your children they take them away to rooms they there's a new report out
[44:29.920 --> 44:42.440]  where they dropped the vase on the floor of the man's relative's ashes let me
[44:42.440 --> 44:48.200]  just read the article since I'm mentioning it this is the indie channel
[44:48.200 --> 44:55.160]  Indianapolis Indianapolis man furious over treatment at Florida Airport he
[44:55.160 --> 44:58.680]  told her look you can send to the x-ray you're not supposed to open it I you
[44:58.680 --> 45:03.640]  know he checked the policy they're not supposed to open urns of ashes a man's
[45:03.640 --> 45:06.880]  attempt to bring the ashes of his grandfather home to Indianapolis ended
[45:06.880 --> 45:10.760]  with an angry scene in the Florida Airport when the ashes spilled on the
[45:10.760 --> 45:15.800]  terminal floor he she laughed at him she put her finger into it dug around in it
[45:15.800 --> 45:20.120]  dropped it on the floor he was you know basically told to hurry up and clean it
[45:20.120 --> 45:25.000]  up and then she laughed at him as he crawled around on the floor with
[45:25.000 --> 45:32.840]  passengers waiting to go through he was told she had no right to open it but it
[45:32.840 --> 45:35.560]  didn't matter it was supposed to go through an x-ray machine she opened it
[45:35.560 --> 45:39.040]  she used her finger and was sifting through it and then she accidentally
[45:39.040 --> 45:44.360]  spilled it gross says about a quarter of a third of the content spilled on the
[45:44.360 --> 45:48.040]  floor leaving him frantically trying to gather up as much as he could all anxious
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.280]  passengers waited behind him she didn't apologize she started laughing I was on
[45:53.280 --> 45:58.600]  my hands and knees picking up bone fragments I couldn't pick up all of it
[45:58.600 --> 46:09.320]  everything that was lost and it just goes on and he shows the urn on the news
[46:09.320 --> 46:23.040]  that's local TV station now you look at this and this is the type of people who
[46:23.040 --> 46:27.000]  else would want to grow up men women and children all day who else would want to
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.280]  scream at people who else would want to stand around x-rays and body scanners all
[46:31.280 --> 46:36.120]  day who else will people that need a job and they are not the people are looking
[46:36.120 --> 46:41.120]  for now it's purely converting to absolute criminals and every day now it
[46:41.120 --> 46:45.120]  was every couple days you read about them being busted raping women posing as
[46:45.120 --> 46:50.360]  police attacking people child porn pimping drug dealing robbing bags
[46:50.360 --> 46:56.320]  because they're hiring kleptomaniacs they're hiring criminals this is what a
[46:56.320 --> 47:00.400]  tyranny is they're gonna expand them out on the streets this is the plan it's
[47:00.400 --> 47:06.520]  always been the plan and as I told you it's now happening so let's open the
[47:06.520 --> 47:10.480]  phones up in the next two short segments ahead of Jesse Ventura for TSA
[47:10.480 --> 47:14.800]  whistleblowers are they hiring criminals well we know they are they always say
[47:14.800 --> 47:18.640]  it's an accident well yeah the background check showed they were a felon but we
[47:18.640 --> 47:22.120]  still hired them our whistleblower says they're ordered to put that in the file
[47:22.120 --> 47:27.680]  but that that's who they want they're literally just just just just laying eggs
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.960]  of tyranny all over us and every time we try to smash it it just
[47:32.960 --> 47:45.440]  metastasizes into something new 800 259 92 31 800 2599 231 is the number and we
[47:45.440 --> 47:48.400]  protect your anonymity but doesn't matter the Genesis phone system doesn't
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.280]  doesn't have color ID doesn't see your number our computer system actually does
[47:52.280 --> 47:55.080]  here but I'm gonna actually have that turned off next time we use our phones
[47:55.080 --> 47:59.160]  on the Sunday show the point is I don't really have caller ID it shows the
[47:59.160 --> 48:06.320]  number to be technical call in anonymously give us your information if
[48:06.320 --> 48:11.080]  you want to send it to whistleblowers and info wars.com we'd love it just like
[48:11.080 --> 48:15.720]  police and military have sent us oh here's a plan for reeducation camps army
[48:15.720 --> 48:19.800]  admits yeah that's our document that's not for distribution that's that's marked
[48:19.800 --> 48:25.320]  restricted you shouldn't have it and yeah we got camps for you
[48:25.320 --> 48:30.240]  reeducation camps that is and they're hiring all over the country the jail
[48:30.240 --> 48:34.800]  guards for them that parts public because it's public beds that's how we
[48:34.800 --> 48:39.680]  first learned about it was people one guy who works for the federal government
[48:39.680 --> 48:43.840]  in intelligence and he said I'm allowed you know I know my rights he came on the
[48:43.840 --> 48:46.920]  show remember he said I'm allowed to have my first amendment as long as I don't
[48:46.920 --> 48:50.880]  give away anything classified this is public he's actually a supervisor in
[48:50.880 --> 48:56.560]  one of those agencies forget his name it was like an NSA type agency but the
[48:56.560 --> 49:00.200]  point is is that you've got to start saying no they come to you and say we're
[49:00.200 --> 49:05.000]  gonna shoot you up with smallpox if you're police or military they can't
[49:05.000 --> 49:10.160]  make you take something that's experimental courts have upheld they
[49:10.160 --> 49:13.920]  can't even make you take an approved vaccine if you're in the military if you
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.360]  say no for religious reasons same thing with police but they lie to you and say
[49:17.360 --> 49:21.600]  you have no rights that's a fraud you've got to say no and if you don't think I'm
[49:21.600 --> 49:28.680]  telling the truth look it up you can find where the smallpox and anthrax
[49:28.680 --> 49:32.840]  shots the troops found out said no the military lied and said it was the law
[49:32.840 --> 49:36.400]  said they had no rights they went and got lawyers found out it was true that
[49:36.400 --> 49:39.760]  there was no law and they couldn't make them take experimental vaccines you've
[49:39.760 --> 49:46.080]  got to say no you've got to say no you've got to say no now we know they're
[49:46.080 --> 49:51.120]  hiring defraught priests criminals thieves everything else because that's
[49:51.120 --> 49:57.760]  what every authoritarian system does I want to hear from TSA not even whistle

[54:18.040 --> 54:23.520]  a TSA worker calling in from somewhere in the United States and Tom worked and
[54:23.520 --> 54:28.200]  hired TSA workers let's go to Tom and then Brian we're gonna go to Tom first
[54:28.200 --> 54:33.040]  Tom I don't know if you heard the caller yesterday the video with the
[54:33.040 --> 54:38.000]  interview with the whistleblower is at info wars.com whistleblower TSA
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.960]  deliberately hiring psychopath criminals and again it's admitted they're
[54:43.960 --> 54:46.560]  hiring criminals and ignoring the background check they claim that's a
[54:46.560 --> 54:54.000]  mistake can you confirm or are we wrong is what he said wrong no you correct and
[54:54.000 --> 55:01.080]  I was on the original 9-11 red tag team right after 9-11 and we were hired now
[55:01.080 --> 55:05.760]  this was not a government this was not a government agency doing this we were
[55:05.760 --> 55:11.720]  private contractors that the government hired to do all the resume reviews and
[55:11.720 --> 55:17.200]  the background checks and the screening and it appeared to me after working there
[55:17.200 --> 55:23.360]  for a few weeks that it seemed like the more qualified you were in security or
[55:23.360 --> 55:30.600]  intelligence or law enforcement the less chance you had of getting a job yeah
[55:30.600 --> 55:33.280]  they don't want to actually get real people because they want a bunch of
[55:33.280 --> 55:37.800]  crooks they can put in that'll let them ship drugs things through selectively is
[55:37.800 --> 55:44.840]  that accurate yes and the fact that we had people the way they worked it was
[55:44.840 --> 55:50.560]  they ran the resume program through monster.com and if you wanted to work
[55:50.560 --> 55:56.480]  let's say at Denver International you would throw out an application and a
[55:56.480 --> 56:01.360]  resume and send it in if you wanted to have two different positions in that
[56:01.360 --> 56:07.240]  airport how to get a position solid gotta send in double ed we had people that
[56:07.240 --> 56:13.680]  were so desperate to get a position we had three foot high stack of resumes
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.160]  and applications because they said I'll take any position in any airport
[56:18.160 --> 56:22.800]  anywhere in the United States now do you think that's because a lot of them as
[56:22.800 --> 56:25.960]  we've seen our pervs that want to be able to touch children and they can't get
[56:25.960 --> 56:29.840]  away with it Disney World because we're seeing that just just just perp
[56:29.840 --> 56:36.400]  convicted pervs and defrock priests as the leaders of the airports well we
[56:36.400 --> 56:41.840]  when we got done we we reviewed three and a half million resumes in four and a
[56:41.840 --> 56:46.360]  half months I'm sorry there's no way to do accurate background checks in that
[56:46.360 --> 56:52.640]  sort of a period of time and we ended up still hiring seventy known felons in
[56:52.640 --> 56:58.040]  that mix and we were so secret down there was down in Western Virginia is
[56:58.040 --> 57:03.560]  where they hit us in a hotel and we were not allowed to talk to the press we
[57:03.560 --> 57:10.040]  were supposed to hide our badges to be clear this is ten years ago this guy
[57:10.040 --> 57:13.320]  it was currently doing this and I don't know what he thought saying where he was
[57:13.320 --> 57:17.760]  at and everything because they I mean they came after him and that's the last
[57:17.760 --> 57:21.600]  I've heard but but I mean what do you think of he's saying this is new though
[57:21.600 --> 57:26.440]  he said before they'd hire pushy thugs and people and control freaks he says
[57:26.440 --> 57:29.960]  now they want criminals and they're hiring them out of the corrections
[57:29.960 --> 57:36.840]  rehabilitation program pushing us pushing us you know we've got money at
[57:36.840 --> 57:41.080]  stake here we got money at stake here the only I can put together between what
[57:41.080 --> 57:45.480]  happened then and what's going on now is that they're trying to push in more
[57:45.480 --> 57:52.040]  ways to rate the taxpayers for more money so that they can stay in power
[57:52.040 --> 57:57.800]  all right sir anything else you'd like to add now you're great show me and keep

[58:30.520 --> 58:33.320]  Stalin and Hitler did it we know I mean this happens every time but I mean I
[58:33.320 --> 58:36.960]  want to hear directly from you because I hope it isn't as bad as our other

[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.120]  taped this weekend believe me when I say bombshell it's bombshell let's go
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:56.240]  ahead and talk to Brian who's a TSA worker I guess current or former I let
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.920]  us know thank you for calling in well tell us I mean the whistleblower we had
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.120]  yesterday said that he's involved in hiring and they they now this is a new
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:12.160]  policy they want criminals have you heard anything like this I've heard a lot
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.080]  of things like that but I just want to vouch for what the last caller said I
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.560]  totally agree with that but also a lot of my fellow workers they also like gonna
[01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.080]  sound sick but they also play games like let's see how much we can get away with
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.920]  you know what I mean like how much can we touch I don't like I don't do that but
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.040]  I hear a lot of other workers basically playing those sick games and it's very
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:37.640]  very sick why would someone want to spill somebody's dead grandpas ashes on
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.160]  the ground and then laugh at them I mean I just don't understand that you know
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:48.960]  people are sick this country is going to crap and like I said just hire the most
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:54.880]  disgusting most evil people they can buy you just hit the nail on the head that
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:59.480]  it's not just the police or the TSA or any of this as a culture it's getting
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:05.720]  very sick now now have you heard anything about hiring criminals I don't
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.200]  know specifically but I do know like a lot of people I've talked to you do have
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.640]  criminal background and also a lot of like for instance a lot of splits are
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.040]  placed in the bag saying that the TSA checks your bag and if something's
[01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:21.920]  missing they're deliberately going and taking these items taking these you know
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:27.200]  personal belongings you know because I guess it's kind of a game to them well
[01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.000]  we've seen that where they either leave marijuana in and say enjoy your weed or
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.760]  they take stuff they stole a baby rattle or a teething ring at JFK was for my
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.600]  daughter in a little box they unwrapped it stole it didn't like the other rattle
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:43.960]  left it thought that I mean just just but and that was like six years ago seven
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:49.080]  years ago what else can you tell us so so you're saying you work at an airport
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:54.320]  with TSA currently your TSA to be clear and there are people bragging that they
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:01.880]  have criminal records that work there yes what type of criminal records robbery
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:10.840]  that I don't know of any people personally that have a child abuse or
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.200]  anything like that kind of nature but a lot of them just by talking to me you
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.600]  give the tell that they are pretty much criminal well I mean that's that's what
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:23.640]  criminals do they they brag that hey I've been in jail hey I've done this hey I've
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:27.800]  done that so you're saying you'll be what sitting around give us an example like
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.960]  sitting around the break room and they talk about how they're you know
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:36.360]  convicted robbers or what do they say pretty much stuff like that it's
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.960]  disgusting I'm telling you the games that they like to play let's see let's see
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:45.080]  how far we can touch this person with before they complain let's see how far
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:50.720]  we can go with this little kid you know like just completely disgusting evil
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.200]  demonic you name it well that's what the whistleblower said yesterday he said
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.760]  now they're outside the checkpoint there was a mother with two kids he goes
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.440]  watch this I'm gonna go mess with her and went to search their belongings what
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:08.640]  about good-looking women I have seen what you'd call a hottie over and over
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:14.160]  again I go watch this are there people that like to pull hotties out oh most
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.560]  definitely but you also be surprised that the people that actually don't
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:21.680]  specifically go for the hottie they'd rather go for the old a they'd rather go
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.440]  for the child for you know they would rather you would think that they'd go
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.800]  for the hottie but they wouldn't see that thing see I mean I attractive women
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.200]  are very beautiful obviously but I couldn't imagine wanting to make them
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:41.960]  let me put my hands on them that that's the it just shivers up my spine but I
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.960]  guess I'm not a sicko thank you so much for your courage sir calling in we're

[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:35.520]  tell you like it is Jesse Ventura movie star star wrestler best-selling
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:40.440]  author former Minnesota governor also a mayor his new book is out and I should
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.920]  add it's available at info wars.com it's excellent for people that are still in
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:48.120]  the whole left-right paradigm demo Cribs and Rebublicans and I've got a few
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:52.560]  news clips we're gonna play later where he's on CNN MSNBC you name it and
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:58.760]  they're like how dare you you know call them gang members in the parties or how
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:02.400]  dare you imply 9-11 could be something and what we were told we're gonna get
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:07.320]  his take on some of that because it's admitted that the West is using al-Qaeda
[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:11.920]  in Libya and Syria to overthrow the governments I mean that's even in London
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:16.120]  Telegraph LA Times I showed it to you last hour you're a radio listener I
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.200]  stream video at prisonplanet.tv but I read the headlines on air this is so
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:27.880]  crazy that this is going on now Jesse Ventura has had a big battle with the
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.640]  TSA as you know but they won't even give him his day in court we also want to get
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.400]  an update we haven't talked to him in two weeks about where's the TV show that
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.760]  was finished four or five months ago and also I have confirmed from program
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.800]  directors and you've heard him here on this show radio stations we're on and
[01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.200]  that Eric Mankal Muller's on because we're on a lot of the same stations for
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:52.800]  whatever reason like the big 810 out in Orlando they haven't had the problem
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:56.560]  though other stations have where when Jesse Ventura is on and talking about
[01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:01.440]  the censorship of his episode or FEMA camps there's a scrambling that happens
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.640]  now we don't know if it's at the satellite the radio satellite I'm on a
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.480]  similar one to Mankal but a different one or we don't know if it's the EAS that's
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:16.080]  wired in at the hub point by law now at the radio station transmitter and I've
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.440]  talked to engineers they say yeah they could send a radio control and scramble
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.360]  it and now Obama has announced this is in Reuters AP yesterday that they're
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:31.800]  going to have EAS break in with and take over your cell phone with presidential
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:36.640]  announcements and then and that your phone's gonna have it the the presidential
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:41.600]  ring and then it will override whatever call you're on same thing with TV cable
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.760]  everything so let's talk about the censorship of the police state episode
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:49.760]  what's happening with the new episode I know he was on Mankal talking about this
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:54.280]  we investigated it and interviewed program directors on air and off air and
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.600]  let me tell you it's freaking them out so Jesse that was confirmed what's your
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:10.280]  take on that I'm gonna plead ignorant on that I unfortunately I won't hear the
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.320]  president's messages because I don't use the phone so I guess I'll have to get
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:20.080]  him some other way or you can tell me about them but no I think it's very
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:25.160]  dangerous what's going on between that to me that they now allow these unmanned
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:30.640]  drones the surveillance drones are being okay to fly throughout our country you
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:36.560]  know it's I hate to say it but our bill of rights as I state my book is in
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:41.480]  shambles I mean we've got government that just ignores it they don't care we
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.040]  don't have habeas corpus anymore that's been suspended since George Bush started
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:51.200]  his folly in the wars Obama's never reinstated it so you don't even have a
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:55.880]  right to a lawyer anymore in this country and I don't know when people here
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:59.720]  are gonna wake up and realize that the Democrats and Republicans don't have
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.680]  your best interest in mind well I agree with you let me give you the headline
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.880]  because the guys were able to actually pull it up so you can read it and so and
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.400]  it has a link to the White House announcement and so radio listeners can
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:18.600]  also find it the headline up at info wars.com from that article states and
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.560]  we'll throw that back up on screen here real quick DHS cell phone alert system
[01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:28.320]  follows you around presidential message to have their own distinctive ring tone
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:33.920]  and it's a we have links to the White House announcement and the Department
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:39.080]  of Homeland Security statement and get this governor Walmart's are phasing in
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:46.680]  telescreens with big sys on them telling you to look out for terrorist well I
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:51.000]  guess they're going to inform us well Alex isn't that a wonderful public
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.400]  service they're doing for all of us weren't you in a movie with Arnold
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.720]  Schwarzenegger where they have billboards saying watch your neighbors is
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.320]  called the running man yeah yeah we the running man is becoming quite
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:04.680]  prophetic we don't quite have a game show like it because you know it was
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:08.200]  based on a game show and actually the running man for many people that don't
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:12.600]  realize that it was it was written by a gentleman named Richard Bachman but that
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:18.120]  was a pseudonym for Stephen King Stephen King wrote a group of short stories the
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:23.640]  running man included under that name but I'd originated from Stephen King so if
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.040]  anybody would know about bizarre things and have a bizarre imagination it would
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.520]  be Stephen King but he's like a prophet because a lot of the things that he
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:38.920]  writes about him and George Orwell are now coming true today and you know again
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.840]  we haven't quite got to the point where we have the running man game show but
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:47.720]  we were to the point where reality TV is pretty getting pretty darn close to it
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:52.920]  well we have all the gun camera footage of people being killed in Iraq and
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:57.000]  places and in the video games simulate killing so I think in a way they've
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.280]  turned war into a game show I've talked to business owners oh there's no doubt
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:07.320]  about it Alex there you know I feel for kids today because kids to play these
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:11.840]  games and all these things that you see advertised on TV you know with with the
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.500]  killing and all that stuff it's it's gonna call us them towards it they're
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:21.480]  gonna think it's a everyday activity in the normal way of life and I don't think
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:26.000]  that's necessarily good idea one thing that's always amazed me Alex is how
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:33.840]  sex is rated X but violence is only our oh yeah you can have two boxers beat the
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.520]  daylights out of each other and that's family fun but you see a woman's breath
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.960]  it's the end of the world yeah I mean it's just amazing how how really strange
[01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:49.360]  we are as a society that sex could be x-rated that's worse than not running
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.960]  around with the Texas chainsaw massacre and movies like that that you know show
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.120]  mass murderers and you know people being killed left flasher movies all that
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:08.280]  stuff those only get an R rated but sex gets an X rated very very well said I
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:11.920]  totally agree with you on that point well I mean they admit we're being
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:16.520]  desensitized to all this speaking of censorship I know that you were not
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.680]  supposed to get into the whole story because some of that's private but
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:23.240]  people always ask me about this here we are over a year later and they censored
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:28.240]  that Homeland Security FEMA special where you blew the camps wide open now
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:33.520]  they're doing urban warfare drills the army admits they've got the camps I know
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.480]  you've been out of pocket but I can send you that if you'd like sure that we were
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.280]  sent an army document a few months ago the army came out and said you shouldn't
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:44.400]  have that but yes we have reeducation camps so so much of this is coming out
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:50.720]  in the open now and so recap for folks what happened with that episode and now
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.800]  what's happened with the new season what happened with that particular episode
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.880]  was are we turn I believe it was are we turning into a police statement of course
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.280]  we discovered the documents Congressman Cohen of Tennessee was one of the
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:10.600]  co-sponsors of it and we found the documents with where Homeland Security
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:15.880]  ordered FEMA to build no less than six detention camps and of course the cover
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:20.640]  story is it's for a disasters like Katrina so that they will have places
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.880]  they're located in six different locations throughout the country and
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.640]  that if there's a big disaster that hits what they tell you is that it'll be
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:33.520]  good then because we'll have places to put the for lack of better term
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.560]  refugees from the disasters until they could find you know living quarters
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:44.520]  other places or whatever but you know how can they be refugee camps when they
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.480]  build them with fences with barbed wire on I mean if they're just simply holding
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.760]  you there is a temporary thing due to a disaster well then why would they need
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:56.480]  things of that order why you shouldn't be able to come and go as you please and
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:01.560]  the thing to always look at for people the novice way to look at it is always
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:06.560]  look at the barbed wire on the top of the fence if the barbed wire faces outward
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:12.520]  it's to keep people from the outside getting in if barbed wire faces inward
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:17.720]  it's to keep people from the inside getting out so that's one easy way when
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.040]  you ever see a barbed wire or a chain-link fence with barbed wire on the top look at
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:27.720]  the way the barbed wire is facing if it's facing in it's to keep prisoners in
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:32.920]  there if it's facing out that it's to keep outsiders from getting in also if
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.880]  it's coiled on the top it's a detention center in many cases as well oh yeah if
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:41.480]  it's razor wire absolutely I mean that's a whole different ballgame that's
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:46.120]  another that's another cup of tea with that stuff that razor wire will stop
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.720]  anybody from any direction well I've talked to program directors who've
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:54.320]  confirmed here on air that when you go that that when you went on man Cal or
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.240]  that when I go on his show and now I've confirmed it's happened to my show some
[01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:02.280]  that they scramble it when we give bill numbers and you know talk about things
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.920]  like emergency centers establishment act what do you think's happening there
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:10.520]  well man I've done his show twice now on this book tour and he's informed me he's
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.160]  outraged he's going crazy over it I appreciate man Cal a little bit because you know he
[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:20.720]  was the one who at first didn't believe that waterboarding was torture but like
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:25.720]  a good journalist he had it done to himself and now he's completely reversed
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:30.520]  himself he realizes that it is torture because he had it done to himself you
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:33.520]  know where they administered the waterboarding to him and you know it's
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:37.320]  bad because you've had it done to you yeah back in school we all essentially did
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:41.200]  many years ago so and they used to call it Chinese water torture but they got a
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.360]  way of changing the names then it became waterboarding and now thanks to Dick
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.320]  Cheney it's called enhanced interrogation but getting back to the show
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:54.280]  that's what we learned in the course when we confronted Congressman Cohen with
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:59.840]  it he actually read on the congressional floor an outrage statement against me
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:04.240]  Michael Braverman and my television show so we actually went into the
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.680]  congressional record on it but on that particular show but the weird thing
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:14.400]  about it wasn't aired one time and then it was taken off the air and now through
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.960]  TV won't even acknowledge we did the show it's out there on YouTube I would
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:22.880]  guess it's still there you got a search and I also erased it off the DVR's

[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:33.280]  all right governor Jesse Ventura is our guest gov you were getting into the TV
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.960]  show for folks that just joined us you were I was saying where's the TV show
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.120]  the third installment I know it got into the TSA it was supposed to already air
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:46.040]  four or five months ago where is it you said that's interesting Alex and then
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.080]  we went to break okay well it is interesting because we finished the
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:54.280]  shows right on time like we normally do in November and usually the editing
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.320]  takes place immediately and we're on the air sometime in either mid-January or
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:04.840]  early February but here we are approaching July and the shows have not
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:10.240]  aired and of course one of the shows we focused on this year was the TSA you
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.080]  know and one of the things we learned is that they're going to come out with
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:19.880]  these wristbands that will what they're gonna sell to the public is they will
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:24.680]  have all your information and you know so you'll be banded much like a dog collar
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:28.120]  only it'll be around your wrist and therefore you can stick the wristband
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:32.720]  in something and they'll go exactly who you are which seems on the surface like
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.240]  maybe a good thing but underneath that what we also learned is they can
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:43.760]  decompacitate you with these much like a like a late taser where if they want to
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:47.520]  drop you in the airport they'll out with you wearing one of these they will have
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.960]  the ability to do that to you
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.960]  Wow yeah we learned that on the show that these things also double for a
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.800]  security device as I said to where like they'll say if you're causing trouble or
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:07.240]  you we suspect you of being you know having bad purposes at the airport that
[01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.720]  they can just literally drop you like a taser with them if you're wearing them
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:15.760]  so that'll be more stuff the Lemmings I'm sure will love to get and they'll wear
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:20.520]  them faithfully well no I saw Homeland Security a few years ago they had a
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:25.200]  meeting and listened to a proposal to make everyone wear security bracelets and
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:28.880]  they added oh by the way as an afterthought they have a taser function
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.920]  in them and Homeland Security was actually pushing it so you're saying
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.920]  you were doing an episode researching that yeah yeah that's that's what's in
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:42.080]  the episode on the TSA where we exposed that whole thing that if you do put these
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:47.840]  they'll require them at the airports and that way allegedly you won't have to go
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:51.680]  through the body searches you won't have to go through the x-ray machine if it
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:55.760]  properly identifies you but on the flip side it can also be used to be
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:02.600]  compacted well to you know drop you down you know and get you under control if
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.400]  they had any need to do that
[01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:13.560]  wow I'm glad I'm not flying anymore you know I made the choice when they
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:17.240]  wouldn't allow me to go to court over my fourth amendment constitutional
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:21.140]  rights thing they didn't have jurisdiction I just followed what
[01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:25.240]  Janet Napolitano said you know the head of the Gestapo that's I like to call
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:30.800]  Homeland Security she said if you don't like it don't fly so I don't like it so
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:40.520]  I'm not flying governor I mean if it's already this bad today how much worse is
[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:44.640]  it going to get I don't know Alex you don't I set this on another interview I
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:49.640]  said you know this right now is the first time in my life where I can say
[01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.400]  this all the rest of my life no matter how bad today is in the United States I
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.440]  always had the feeling that tomorrow would be a better day this is the first
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:04.200]  time in my life that if it's bad today I actually looked at tomorrow could now
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.640]  be worse you know I mean we're getting an assault on the middle class that's
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:14.880]  unbelievable you know and people and assault on unions now granted unions
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:20.520]  can be overreach their bounds they can be you know bad because they're run by
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:25.880]  people but for the most part unions are what created the middle class and if you
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.760]  look at a chart that shows median wage and if you look at the same chart that
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:38.440]  shows that Union falling the lines are identical as unions fall so does median
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.960]  income and they fall identically people need to understand it was unions that
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.640]  gave us things like collective bargaining it gave you things to be able to get
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:54.040]  health insurance at work it gave you things against the employers that you
[01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:58.360]  wouldn't have as an individual case in point I did the Fran Tarkin and show and
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.480]  he was wailing pretty hard on the unions then I brought up Fran remember
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:08.360]  something you in the NFL had a union or still have one I said in pro wrestling
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:14.640]  we have never had one that's why at one point in my career I wrestled 63
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:21.720]  consecutive nights in a row without a day off 63 days in a row yeah I never had
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:27.640]  health insurance this was back in the early 80s I was paying $5,000 a year to
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.120]  ensure my family my wife and my kids well if we would have had a union I
[01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:36.520]  would have probably only had to pay $1,500 a year because there's strength in
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:42.680]  numbers and also you know in pro wrestling we're in pro football pro
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:48.000]  baseball all the sports that have unions they have retirement stay there Jesse

[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.840]  wrestling because there's not a union there's no retirement so you can wrestle
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:14.120]  25 years and let's face it wrestlers are not accountants they're not you know
[01:34:14.120 --> 01:34:18.320]  specialists to know how to invest and take care of their futures all the time
[01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.880]  they're professional wrestlers and you can put 25 years in the business and
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.040]  when you're done you get nothing not a thing because there's no union
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:33.240]  protection at all in pro wrestling well there's not you know I've got a lot of
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:38.000]  questions here that I want to raise governor but what is front and center on
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.640]  your plate right now what's your greatest concern what's stuck in your
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.700]  crawl well what I'm most concerned about is our loss of freedom you know the
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:51.800]  bill of rights to me has been in our Constitution is in shambles the very
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.920]  cloth of our nation that we're supposed to abide by I mean in chapter two of my
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:01.720]  book you know I have quotes remarkable quotes from George Washington especially
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:06.520]  the father of our country talking about how political parties how awful they are
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:11.920]  and Thomas Jefferson and John Adams too and what troubles me the most is we're
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.320]  not a country that doesn't seem to want to read history and of course the old
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.880]  cliche is true if you don't read history you're destined to repeat it and we're
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.960]  good we're heading right down that road because people are more interested in
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:33.000]  in you know these phony reality shows on TV they're more interested in you know
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.640]  sports happening throughout the world which don't get me wrong that's great
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.240]  entertainment and you need to entertain yourself we all work hard and you know
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.680]  you owe yourself some entertainment but you also owe yourself to pay attention
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.600]  and pay attention to what's going on around you and what bothers me most is
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:55.120]  most people have this wazzy fair attitude well it isn't going to happen to
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:59.840]  me and until it does come up and happen to them they're not taking any
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:04.840]  precautions they're not paying attention to government and people are not voting
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:10.880]  and right now voting and voting against Democrats and Republicans to me has to
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.440]  be the number one order for this ball I can't emphasize it enough stop voting
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:21.200]  for these two brought out bribe political parties in fact they used to always
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.120]  say if you voted for me Jesse Ventura in Minnesota you were wasting your vote
[01:36:25.120 --> 01:36:30.560]  because I couldn't win well I did win and we also want to demand that Governor
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.200]  Derry Johnson the Libertarian candidate for president be included in the
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.360]  debates this fall why do we only get two leaders of the two gangs who get the
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.680]  debate let's bring in a neutral person like Governor Johnson and see what he
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.200]  has to say and then if you still want to vote Democrat and Republican well at
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:54.680]  least you've given you've been given a third option to consider well you're
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:58.000]  right and and even if you don't agree with Johnson on every issue the point
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  is it's about forcing the two-party monopoly the two twins to let in
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:09.640]  another voice which is something they desperately don't want because let me
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:14.040]  add something no one's ever going to agree with the candidate a hundred
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.360]  percent you're never going to see a candidate for public office where you
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:23.120]  can honestly say you know I agree with everything he says take Ron Paul and I
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.760]  you know I think Ron Paul would have been the best president with without
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:32.520]  any doubt and yet we differ on the abortion issue Ron Paul does not
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:38.000]  support abortion at all I do I don't necessarily support people having
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.880]  abortion but I don't support government telling women what they tend or can't do
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:46.440]  with their bodies yeah well Ron Paul comes out and basically says it's become a
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:50.480]  state issue and people are attacking Rand Paul right now because he's saying
[01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:55.960]  hey don't have mandatory federal labeling for GMO but he's saying the feds
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:38:00.720]  don't have that jurisdiction it should be a state issue and that's a complex
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:04.640]  issue but I understand why he's saying that sure well I'll tell you I just got
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:08.440]  a communication from Rand Paul and let me tell you this Alex I don't know if
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.000]  you're aware of this one you probably are because you're usually more aware
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.360]  than I am but I got a thing from Rand Paul are you aware of this treaty in the
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.920]  U.M. that they're going to try to get us to sign on to which one they've got an
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.360]  anti it's going to happen this fall and it's one that will call but that will
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:30.400]  have an international gun registry oh yeah yeah sure sure no no there's the
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:35.240]  treaty the Hillary says they're going to sign without Congress and register and
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:39.000]  restrict small arms the unity or treaty up and then there's also the law the C
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.800]  treaty that hands over everything to the UN yeah speak to that governor where
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:48.160]  do you stand on UN law restricting our guns well that's absurd I mean we have
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.000]  the second amendment which is to protect our right as individuals to have
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.080]  firearms it's not there people need to understand they try to sell you well
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:02.240]  we're not going to inflict on your hunting and fishing this has nothing to
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.000]  do with hunting and fishing back when they wrote the bill of rights if you
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.040]  didn't hunt and fish you didn't eat so this was done so that the public could
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:15.680]  arm themselves in case government became oppressive well what's going to happen
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:20.560]  with this deal is we will now throw our second amendment out the window we will
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.360]  then fall under an international arms law that will tell you that will require
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:29.480]  you to register all your guns internationally with some international
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:34.360]  unit who eventually you know is going to disarm you and you know that's the
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:38.440]  liberal side of the issue that's their thing that's like Bill Maher on TV is
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:43.960]  for that and I go all that you know how ridiculous is that because I was in the
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:48.200]  Philippines the day Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law and became a
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.720]  dictator the first thing he did as a dictator he gave the Philippine people
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:59.280]  two weeks to turn in all their guns or it was the death sentence now why would a
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:05.600]  dictator make that his top priority it's obvious why so the public has no way to
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:10.280]  rise up against him that's right governor and I'm very glad that you're
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.080]  here speaking about it here's our article June 16th info wars.com Obama
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:20.600]  seeks UN and US congressional ratification of UN global gun control
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.960]  treaty and then it has links to the UN in our article where they're actually
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:31.000]  calling for it at the United Nations UN.org disarmament
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:38.480]  forward slash COV arms forward slash arms trade treaty registration restriction
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:44.520]  and in the UN treaty they state civilian ownership of firearms threatens the
[01:40:44.520 --> 01:40:49.400]  legitimate power monopoly of the state so so they're admitting they want a power
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:54.800]  monopoly what you just said I say that's illegitimate and I tell you if they
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:58.200]  want to cause a civil war governor what do you think's gonna happen look at it
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:02.960]  look at it this way Alex I'll give you the best example I live in Mexico five
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:09.200]  months out of the year in Mexico private ownership of guns is illegal and look
[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.440]  what's going on down there 20 to 30,000 people a year are killed by the drug
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:20.520]  cartels because the regular people down there have no mechanism to defend
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:26.880]  themselves and so all these guns advocates that wanted disarm us take a
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:31.800]  look at the country of Mexico as I said they have big signs when you drive into
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:37.800]  Mexico firearms and even ammunition are illegal if you're caught with them you
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:42.920]  will go immediately to Mexican prison and and look at the end results it's the
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:48.440]  old cliche when the honest people don't have guns only the bad people do because
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.960]  they're not getting theirs legally anyway so they're gonna have guns if they
[01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.560]  don't care one way or the other the criminals and that's exactly what would
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:02.240]  happen up here the only people then that would have firearms would be criminals
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:06.680]  I'm on the UN treaty website where they say they want the abolition of all of
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:10.920]  our guns and it says strengthening peace and security through disarmament but
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:14.280]  then only the UN who by the way is invading countless countries as we
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:18.840]  speak has the guns imagine what Hitler would have done of the rest the world
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:23.160]  had been disarmed yeah well you know a little bit I mean we still had our
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:27.320]  military's naturally that brought him you know it wasn't the civilian people
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:31.160]  necessarily now it's a global government now it's a global government yeah but
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:35.640]  you're talking about a global government here how then do we rise up if we
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:41.800]  don't like the global government you know I guess you know you know we can get
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:46.200]  a bunch of slingshots or something stand up to them Governor Jesse Ventura's
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:49.000]  with us his book is already going up the bestseller charts
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:53.280]  Democrybs and Rebluplicans get it out to everybody out there that you know who's
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.760]  not awake to what's happening a lot of founding father quotes a lot of great
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:01.200]  insight available at info warshop.com and bookstores everywhere but speaking of
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.000]  global government since we just raised that point you were on the Kudlow report
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.600]  last week and they I'm not gonna play the whole clips don't have time don't
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.360]  want to go to calls but they savaged you for daring to say there's some holes in
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.800]  the official 9-11 story to say the least but let's stop there here's the same
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:21.600]  report I thought there was no global government I thought the big banks like
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.000]  in your TV show last year where you expose run the global government I
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.080]  thought that was all made up governor here is CNBC talking about the global
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:36.120]  government two days ago so mostly what they do is hold summits I think that
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:40.560]  right now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's what I want
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.320]  to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at last is it one
[01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:49.960]  world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've got some
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:54.560]  downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just living
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.640]  and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on the fact
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:03.760]  that there's a Bernanke putt putt and that we won't go any lower than say five
[01:44:03.760 --> 01:44:07.400]  percent down from here of course we are because if we look at the economic data
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.280]  there's nothing to get excited about in that so we you know yesterday we saw
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:15.240]  some reluctance for the Bernanke Fed to expand their balance sheets and pump more
[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:19.360]  money in but the stock market knows that reluctance is totally different than
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.160]  not willing to do it at all and that's why we saw oil and oil implode and gold
[01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.600]  trade off heavily because they're not a protected class if the stock market
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:31.360]  starts trading off in the 10 to 15 to 20 percent area the chairman's going to
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.920]  come in and throw some stimulus at it so to answer your question we are
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.800]  absolutely slaves to central banks because we'd love to be slaves of the
[01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:42.200]  economy but the economic numbers continue to do nothing but they go on to
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.400]  basically thank the federal reserve the full clips at info wars.com they go on
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.200]  to basically thank the federal reserve and say well they're just trying to fix
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.520]  things we'd like a market but everything's run by them they're the main
[01:44:52.520 --> 01:44:57.240]  recipients of the trillions in bailout they sold the derivatives in Europe 90
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:01.280]  plus percent of the debt is theirs but the media acts like it's the public as
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:06.400]  they raise taxes cut benefits further stalling the economy governor there
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.680]  were literally in the last few weeks more than 30 articles in mainstream news
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:16.560]  admitting an authoritarian world governments here run by banks but they
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:20.400]  know best and thank God they're there why do you think they're coming out in
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:25.400]  the open now? Well because eventually the truth will come out Alex you know you
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:29.760]  can't keep things hidden forever so they want to get ahead of the 8-Ball they
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:34.240]  want to put the spin on it so that all the lemmings in the country will be
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.800]  comfortable with it when when it actually does come a clear cut reality out
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:42.880]  there that's why they're doing it it's very intelligent to do it that way if
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:47.440]  it's going to happen they want to be ahead of the curve on it so that they
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:53.560]  can put their spin on it first and that way anyone else that opposes it will be
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.240]  fighting an uphill battle exactly because people only remember the first time
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:01.920]  they heard it reported and how it was reported they don't remember later like
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.120]  the official story of 9-11 we're told this is the official story that's it go
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:10.440]  back to sleep but when you actually look closer it's got more holes in it than
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.040]  Swiss cheese on the same show they tried to imply that you were bad and that you
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.000]  were saying you know like a like the Americans did it instead of the
[01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.840]  globalist what's your take on that well again you know you're anyone that questions
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:30.040]  9-11 in this country to mainstream media is considered in that case how dare you
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:36.360]  do it you're unpatriotic and you know they offer us no information they accept
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:42.040]  a 9-11 report that had to be I learned this everything in the 9-11 report had
[01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:48.080]  to be agreed upon unanimously or it didn't get in the report you know and
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:57.360]  everything about nature so it doesn't surprise me a bit Alex well the fact is
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.920]  the system is scared of free thinkers people that will tell it like it is
[01:47:00.920 --> 01:47:04.640]  yourself myself Ron Paul and so many others but as you've pointed out
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:10.760]  earlier the answer is everybody speaking out everybody not going along with the
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:17.400]  cookie-cutter mainline system well again I wish I'll tell you what we you know
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:22.840]  you and I talked about organizing a boycott of the airport for one day I'd
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:27.960]  like to change that now and I think we need to organize and we need to protest
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:33.240]  the fact that the upcoming election will only be between two hand-picked people
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:39.080]  by the gangs we need to get Gary Johnson in the debates and I think if we're
[01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:44.320]  going to stand up and be counted there is the spot to do it because it's right
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:49.160]  on the horizon why should we only get the two voices of the two private
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:53.360]  parties where you're going to get businesses you know when you've got a
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:57.400]  brilliant man like Gary Johnson waiting in the wings who would make an
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.200]  outstanding president and by the way by the way I saw clips on the news too we've
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:06.680]  got the clip in there was it CNN or MSNBC where they were criticizing you you
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.680]  were on the show they're like we don't like the fact that you're you know
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:16.760]  criticizing you know calling them gangs did do you remember that interview oh
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:21.920]  yeah absolutely they you know they they came after me real hard in fact the guy
[01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:26.760]  tried to lecture me that I need to go out and talk to people to learn what a
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:32.040]  real gang is the crypts in the bloods and I find that laughable considering I
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.600]  used to be a full-patch member of the Mongols Motorcycle Club the black and
[01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:42.120]  white of Southern California so Alex I speak from experience I've been in a
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:48.040]  gang and I've also been in government these bozos on TV all they do is go to
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:52.360]  college and write a book they have no life experiences they wouldn't know the
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:57.800]  inside of a gang if it came up and bit them on the ass well said let's jam in
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:03.120]  some calls and the time we have left with Jesse Ventura Joe in South Carolina
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:09.480]  you're first up go ahead hey governor Ventura thank you my call I'm just
[01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:13.560]  curious you know if we want to be Romney or Obama after this I mean what do you
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:17.080]  what is your prediction as to what the future will hold as far as TSA and what
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.520]  not I mean do you think it's just gonna keep going on this way absolutely it
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:25.240]  won't matter which guy wins whether it's Romney or Obama because they're all
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:28.760]  going to go with the premise just like they won't cut the military budget at
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:34.800]  all no mainstream candidate will cut the military budget a bit because none of
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.800]  them want to want none of them want to be portrayed as soft on defense my god
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:45.480]  we have enough nuclear bombs we have enough military power our entire
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:49.840]  military budget is larger than the whole rest of the world's damn dear I
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:55.960]  mean nobody can beat our military it can't be done right now why do we
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:49:59.760]  continue to have a military like that and getting back to your question it
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.480]  don't matter if you get Romney or Obama you're gonna get the same policies you've
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:14.320]  had and the same ones you're gonna have does that answer your question yeah all

[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:30.960]  the Billy Corrigan interview coming up talks about a lot of hardcore political
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:34.440]  subjects this will definitely be a newsmaker so stay with us for that we
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:41.040]  talk about the New World Order GMO TSA the police state all of it Christine in
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:46.280]  Washington you're on the air with Governor Jesse Ventura Jesse and we
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:52.640]  expect you totally you are the most beautiful being of light that is how I
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:58.160]  feel about you you have more courage than any man I've ever met anyway well I
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:01.600]  appreciate that Christine but I'm sure there's a lot of people out there with
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:06.800]  more courage than me to I don't know any but anyway Jesse I wanted to know why
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:14.080]  you were not on coast-to-coast the reason was my schedule said they were
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:19.720]  supposed to call me at 10 o'clock at night I set up at 10 o'clock until 11
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:25.000]  15 and no call and so I finally just got tired and went well that was probably
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  just a time zone issue you know I think somebody screwed up and either I got
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.480]  the wrong because I was according to my schedule I was supposed to be on from
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:41.120]  10 to midnight I sat and waited from 10 o'clock until 11 15 and my eyes wouldn't
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:46.400]  stay open I'm sure it's a time zone issue so I'm sure that's gonna happen
[01:55:46.400 --> 01:55:49.560]  that's an important show to do when I get the word out of it'll be more than
[01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:53.160]  all the shows you've been on combined probably 16 million listeners a night
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.480]  thank you so much Christine Aaron and Canada you're on the air with Jesse
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:02.560]  Ventura hey Jesse Ventura Mr. Jones how's it going good go ahead I was just
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.800]  wondering how Jesse Ventura feels about Info Wars and Alex Jones selling pens
[01:56:07.800 --> 01:56:12.800]  and canteens from China okay there's a nice little we sell a lot of stuff made
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:16.720]  America but we sell things from all over we sell I think that I think the
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:20.160]  inside of the canteen is made in the U.S. I think the pen is made in China yeah
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:26.040]  well fine what about Walmart everything they sell comes from China too no no it's
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:30.440]  just a troll call I mean it's I mean that's what people do you know what are
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:34.400]  you supposed to do go out I mean I don't look at the label of where everything
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.840]  was made if I want something well we listen we try our best most of what we
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:43.280]  sell is made in the United States and I've nothing against the people in China
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.800]  having jobs I'm against paying 20 million dollars to ship General Motors to
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:53.120]  China that's wrong so it's just a cowardly attempt to make a slip and not
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:57.640]  only that Alex when I use fireworks most of that all comes from China and I
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:03.240]  certainly enjoy that on the fourth of July oh it's all just ridiculous we're
[01:57:03.240 --> 01:57:05.880]  all evil actually I actually did I just bought some fireworks before this you
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:10.160]  lie I'm bad Shannon in Wisconsin you're not calling on a phone made in China
[01:57:10.160 --> 01:57:19.440]  are you probably probably is I just say hi Alex you guys are I'm honored you're
[01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:24.520]  too much thank you we're almost out of time do you have a question yes you know
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:30.680]  you had the thing say use your listeners for assets my question is with the TSA
[01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:36.960]  crap that's going on why can't we have a stage to planned events you know to get
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:39.800]  the meteorite because you know it's always that people don't react until it
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.640]  hits home you know like the like the guy getting his grandfather's ashes
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:49.160]  dumb let me check one of the problems with that just like the Iraq war there
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:53.840]  were massive police protests against the Iraq war but you're dealing with
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:59.400]  mainstream media they ignore them if we were to go protest one of the chances
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:03.640]  that mainstream media would even cover it by the way governor this just broke
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:08.040]  today I'll ask you when we come back in the next segment about it they dumped
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:11.720]  the guy's grandpa's ashes out this is basically see what they were and then
[01:58:11.720 --> 01:58:17.440]  laughed at him that's in mainstream television this shows how crazy the TSA
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:23.920]  is oh I agree with that and let me make one statement here before we go and this
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:30.600]  is to all military veterans as well as current military personnel remember you

[02:02:11.240 --> 02:02:16.620]  but I haven't had anybody to do anything with no activism nothing like that and I
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:22.400]  joined Planet Info Wars about a month ago I met a guy he's on the same page he
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:26.240]  amped me up I amped him up last week we met up with two more people already
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:31.440]  growing exponentially so it's tyranny you know there's a clamp down comes down so
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:35.960]  is the awakening and freedom and liberty and we're gonna beat these guys beautiful
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:41.960]  my question for governor Ventura is about gun confiscation what do we do
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:46.400]  about I'm sure a lot of people have the question about how if all these guns are
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:50.720]  registered it almost seems like it's futile to even have them if they're I
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:54.840]  mean they're gonna probably go after him first right I would think so I I know
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:03:02.960]  if I don't have any guns of course you're being sarcastic yeah I'm just
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:06.880]  stating for a fact in case anyone's listening I've gotten rid of all mine I
[02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:10.400]  don't own any that's why you laughed at the yeah so the answer is you're not
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:19.760]  turning them in yeah oh no I sold them all right you're something else
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:25.120]  you take that the way you want to Alex I don't have any guns exactly well you
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:28.040]  know don't you think it's gonna start a civil war if they try to confiscate guns
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:32.400]  I don't know and with the way the lemmings are in this country I'm sure
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:36.600]  that be a civil war with some of us but not all of us because you've got a great
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.280]  many people out there that believe we should be disarmed they've gotten into
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:45.920]  the hype and they think that government will somehow make them safe and they'll
[02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:51.640]  be safe from everything as long as they don't have a firearm well in closing I
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:53.800]  think we're gonna leave it there because there's no time to go to their
[02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.160]  calls but look there are three to four some months five million guns being
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:02.600]  sold it's like more than triple the previous record it was the double the
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:06.080]  previous record and a lot of people I know are saying that's their line in the
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:10.400]  sand governor just like in 1776 when they came to confiscate the guns that's
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:13.480]  when it started and I think there are a lot of people out there that aren't gonna
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:17.800]  turn them in well I hope they don't because you know pheasant hunting is
[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:22.480]  always good and this and that you know you won't be able to do any of those
[02:04:22.480 --> 02:04:28.240]  things anymore and you know where I'm going and but I certainly hope that at
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:32.320]  some point the line is drawn in the sand I hope it's drawn in the sand again
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:36.800]  and people will vote for Governor Gary Johnson the libertarian I guarantee you
[02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:41.840]  he's not gonna take your guns away well said the new book available info or

[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:08.040]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:06:08.040 --> 02:06:12.320]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:16.600]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:20.960]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:25.040]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:29.600]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:33.720]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:37.680]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[02:08:22.480 --> 02:08:27.680]  new hit album and let me tell you from the Chicago Tribune to Rolling Stone
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:32.360]  people are saying this is one of his best albums ever and I had a chance to
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:37.480]  download it and listen to it just the other day and found that I think it's
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:42.520]  some of the best work ever from Billy Corrigan and his great crew Billy
[02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:47.920]  wonderful having you today and congratulations on the rave reviews thank
[02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:52.080]  you Alex that's a it's an interesting time being sort of thrown back into the
[02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:57.880]  American zeitgeist and what's funny is then you know like some of the things
[02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:01.600]  that you and I talked about a few months back some of the ideas that are
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:06.640]  going on as people are sort of waking up to the political shifts the social
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:11.560]  shifts the spiritual shifts you know suddenly then having a voice in the
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:15.880]  American mainstream you know I'm able to talk about some of these issues in a
[02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:19.000]  way that people can understand because I've been around for a while you know
[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:23.080]  well you certainly have been let's cut right to the chase with this new album
[02:09:23.080 --> 02:09:28.240]  beyond political you're talking about the nature of reality you know quasars
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:36.200]  and celestial and panoptigons and of course Oceania right out of 1984 break
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:42.600]  down the spirit that you were you're basically channeling when you put
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:47.360]  together this new album well I think some of the roots start on this album
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:52.240]  start from the last album in 2007 zeitgeist which you know on some
[02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:56.760]  conscious or unconscious level listening to you and and doing my own
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.520]  research on the internet kind of led me to a dark place where I felt you know
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:05.320]  what's happening to my country how do I grapple with these feelings that I'm
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:12.040]  having you know when I started in music you know it was all cheery Reagan you
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:14.800]  know flag is a wave and everything is great and you know there was a lot of
[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:20.320]  kind of middle-class discourse on stuff that maybe that now seems really small
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:23.960]  and in comparison to what we're really grappling with now as we see what's
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:30.240]  coming economically down the pike so I think if you if you can draw a line
[02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:35.280]  from sort of a darker place in trying to grapple with the American dream which
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.040]  zeitgeist had something to do with five years later now Oceania I think it's a
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:44.920]  way to say you know I'm just not gonna live in that spirit that energy that
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:49.520]  dark energy I've heard you talk about it and certainly I've thought about it a
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:55.480]  lot which is you know we got to live you know some of the most inspirational
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:58.600]  stuff I've ever heard you talk about is when you just talk about nature about
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:02.960]  how how God's kingdom is inspires you to you know to fight the good fight and to
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:07.120]  you know think of families and when what life is really about and and I think
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:11.420]  that my album is really about that it's like we've all we all go through hard
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:15.080]  times our country's going through hard time it's not a political album in that
[02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:19.520]  sense but at the same time if the politics is part of the backdrop in the
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:24.320]  foreground I just want to embrace my life and and and get and get right with
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.520]  God get right with my my spirit because I think that's the way to lead us out of
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:32.760]  this kind of craziness that again seems to be coming and God knows where it's
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.920]  coming from but I mean everywhere you go people feel it and and then they can't
[02:11:36.920 --> 02:11:40.560]  put their finger on it you know you you see signs where that's you know what's
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.560]  going on in Greece or Spain and we just had a show cancelled actually we were
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:49.600]  supposed to play in on an island called Tenerife I think the island is called it
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.840]  or the city was called Tenerife and the show was cancelled because of the
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:58.200]  Spanish economic crisis so these are starting to have real effects on you
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:01.920]  know and so when we look back at we see these things happening we don't but we
[02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:06.120]  don't know where this is all going you know I mean I mean when you see mainstream
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:10.720]  news sources the foxes and the CNNs using the kind of language that five years
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:14.960]  ago you were being condemned for you know it's kind of laughable profound Mr.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:21.200]  Corrigan we see Larry Summers one of the top Bankster globalist in the
[02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:25.760]  Washington Post last week saying prepare for total collapse but he's acting
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:29.680]  like it's all an accident and they're the wise old men that are going to save
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:34.280]  us when they're the people on record that engineered this implosion that's
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:40.800]  how we were able more than 10 years ago to to chronicle what was coming and now
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:45.080]  here we are it's it's out in the open and a lot of people say well you're being
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:49.120]  negative talking about all these horrible things but if we don't focus and
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:54.360]  expose the bad then we can never recognize it from the good and protect
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:58.800]  what's good and I can feel the heartbeat of the universe God whatever people want
[02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:05.600]  to call it and more and more people are actually coming out of their trance I am
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:10.600]  seeing that but I also see others who aren't waking up getting deeper into the
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:14.240]  trance I would totally agree with that I think what's happening is we're seeing
[02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:20.160]  a split the people that are invested in reality and by reality I'm not talking
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:25.560]  about the Adam Sandler movie version you know the sitcom version I'm talking
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:31.040]  about reality as we know it as our ancestors lived it you know like what's
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:34.560]  what the heck is going to happen to me and my family how do we move forward how
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:40.200]  do we progress to the species how do we evolve rightly and morally as we see that
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.640]  part of and it's everywhere it's not just America you see you see glimpses in
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:51.120]  China and in India and Africa as people are waking up they're doing their own
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:55.120]  research they're having their own discourse with their friends and family
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:59.800]  so so and now they have access to information the way they've ever had
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:03.800]  so empires can't sort of play this game that they play you know dating back
[02:14:03.800 --> 02:14:08.120]  probably longer than you and I could recall the other side of course has to
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:11.800]  go deeper into the dream like the matrix they have they have to go there
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:17.880]  because that's the only way to sustain the the insanity and here's in here's
[02:14:17.880 --> 02:14:21.920]  this is a touchy subject but but this is the this is the classic example we've
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.360]  all had that situation where like you know something horrible happens you know
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:30.640]  a kid falls down a hole and and you know when we're live from the kid that fell
[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:34.160]  down the hole and everybody's will the kid get out of the hole safely and you
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:38.480]  know their prayer visuals and and and and yes that's that's the appropriate
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:45.480]  response we should care yet meanwhile kids are dying everywhere you know is it
[02:14:45.480 --> 02:14:54.040]  from an unjust military action or is it from a reckless police force or so you
[02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:56.680]  know there's things that are happening everywhere that we don't have that same
[02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.040]  level of concern but why don't we well we've been socially conditioned that one
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:03.960]  thing is okay to care about and one thing well just accept the official version
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:07.640]  and just kind of march on and I think this is where people are waking up and
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:10.680]  say wait a second there's a hypocrisy in that why don't we care about everybody
[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:16.400]  equally and and you see that as the world citizen's re is opening as a waking up
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:20.960]  and so then it's not really about you or me anymore it's about people taking
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.600]  their own individual journey to discover what they want from this world and
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:27.320]  those that are waking up are going to find that information that they're
[02:15:27.320 --> 02:15:30.920]  going to draw their own conclusions and they're probably not gonna so that's
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:34.720]  to agree with you or me or the next guy or layer Larry Summers they're gonna make
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:37.680]  their own conclusions and that's what we want we want a bunch of independent
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:41.000]  thinkers we don't want sheep that's the worst thing but the sheep are gonna
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:44.120]  become more sheep because that's what they want they don't want to wake up
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:47.400]  they want to live in that dream and and I know people like that my family they
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:51.360]  just they don't want to know and I'm sure you've had those conversations
[02:15:51.360 --> 02:15:55.160]  anybody listening to you I'm sure it's had those conversations you talk to people
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:58.720]  and you you know you talk about I don't know the Federal Reserve something
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:01.760]  that's really not that political when you get right down to it and they don't
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:04.480]  want to hear it they just want to put their fingers in there and and believe
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:09.720]  the TV show that's been presented politically bang on from my perspective
[02:16:09.720 --> 02:16:14.360]  Billy that's what's happening the wheat is being separated from the chaff and
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:19.000]  people that are committed to the illusion once they get into that trap
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:25.080]  they'll go along with anything and you've crystallized something that I've
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:32.520]  attempted to boil down and that's that it's insulting that the power structure
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:36.760]  the corporate controlled media the people that create the maps of the mind
[02:16:36.760 --> 02:16:42.680]  they say get upset about this child that they claim Assad killed in Syria and
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:48.040]  then when hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children are killed we're told all
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:53.200]  they're just you know dehumanized Arabs or Muslims and it's insulting it's
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:57.720]  insulting that the mainstream media and the corporate culture tries to flip our
[02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:02.280]  emotions on and off and tell us when we can care about something I don't mean to
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:07.880]  go off into a rant but but what you said really is the key it's it's it's
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:16.080]  recognizing how ridiculous and and and fake and plastic this culture is yes and
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:20.920]  and and so like for example we just have the case with the Sandusky the Penn State
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:26.000]  that the horrible stories of molesting these young men and as you've talked
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.480]  about maybe a culture that would have protected him because of wanting to
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:35.400]  maintain power or not not pay the price for looking the other way now now of
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:38.200]  course you're gonna have the cases they're gonna come up with the the
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:41.840]  administration officials that may allegedly may have covered it up and
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:46.400]  and so on and so on so the interesting thing is what I see with the people
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:49.200]  around me and I'm not necessarily surrounded by a bunch of liberal class
[02:17:49.200 --> 02:17:54.560]  I'm surrounded by a lot of working class people I see them not necessarily buying
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:59.000]  these narratives like they used to you know and so what happens and we know
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:02.640]  this from rock and roll if you see if the audience doesn't react you turn the
[02:18:02.640 --> 02:18:05.480]  volume up louder well what we have is a culture that's just turning up the
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:10.520]  volume louder you know because people start asking real questions and so so
[02:18:10.520 --> 02:18:14.360]  of course then that then the theater needs to be heightened and new narratives
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:17.440]  need to be created to try to create an emotional engagement which of course is
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:22.080]  not real because it's meant to take you on some level even if it is profit
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:26.640]  driven to take you away from your very human and emotion which is why don't we
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:32.280]  care about everybody the ruling class the social engineers are so good at
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:37.160]  controlling us and dumbing us down and having a thousand you know blaring loud
[02:18:37.160 --> 02:18:42.600]  speakers in the background to where we just curl up as little balls but what
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:47.280]  the ruling elite need to understand is they're not immune from this they're
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:51.640]  basically drinking their own poison and this is what happens throughout history
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:58.680]  with Caligula and Nero and so many other systems where the elite go crazy and
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:04.040]  that's what concerns me the most is that undoubtedly the ruling power structures
[02:19:04.040 --> 02:19:08.640]  the different special interests they're in control of the world they're in
[02:19:08.640 --> 02:19:12.920]  control of the propaganda but they're not in control of themselves and so it's
[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:17.720]  almost like the monsters from their subconscious are now actually running the
[02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:23.160]  machine and instead of it being Caligula marrying his horse or Nero going crazy
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:27.480]  and burning Rome and then committing suicide because he could they're gonna
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:32.040]  commit planetary suicide they're gonna kill us with all these super weapons and
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:37.360]  bio weapons if humanity collectively at an instinctive level and a spiritual
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:43.520]  level and those two are connected doesn't flip the survival switch and cause
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:48.320]  some type of emergency metamorphosis that takes us out of this we're either
[02:19:48.320 --> 02:19:51.840]  going to move to the next level or we're going to destroy ourselves my gut my
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:57.360]  spirit shakes with the realization and total understanding that we are at the
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:03.520]  crossroads jump point I think that we're going to survive it and I think that
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:08.720]  there's going to be a kind of lack of a better word a public reckoning now
[02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:17.680]  ideally it's a peaceful one where the you know Jim Morrison from the doors you
[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:21.760]  know the great the great lead singer at the doors he was he was he was he was
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:26.760]  very intrigued by the idea of how to manipulate a crowd and some of the things
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:30.440]  that I brought in rock and roll I sort of took from his theories he used to do
[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:34.640]  things like when he was just a spectator he would go in a crowd with three of his
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:37.760]  friends and they would plant themselves at various points in the crowd and try
[02:20:37.760 --> 02:20:41.000]  to turn the crowd against the band and then obviously on stage he would do
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:46.240]  things to see what where the flip point was you know there's people talk about
[02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:49.320]  catchphrase like a tipping point you don't need a hundred percent of the
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:53.120]  people to agree with something to reach a tipping point so we're at we let's let's
[02:20:53.120 --> 02:20:57.280]  say there's let's say in a gross over simplification there's a right way and
[02:20:57.280 --> 02:21:00.840]  there's a wrong way and in most people and probably the predominant number of
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:04.080]  people listening to your program feel that what's happening is the wrong way
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:08.240]  we just feel in our gut that something's not right whether it's GMOs or
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:14.320]  vaccines or you know fascism or Federal Reserve doesn't matter we just feel
[02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:18.200]  something's not quite right okay where's that tipping point if we have if
[02:21:18.200 --> 02:21:21.480]  there's a hundred million people how many people do we need in that tipping
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.920]  point and I think we're starting to get actually pretty close to that tipping
[02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:31.840]  point where the public in the the that's called the thoughtful minority that's
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:35.360]  not going to buy this BS propaganda there's going to be a point where it's
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:37.560]  we're just going to reach that and there's going to be a critical mass
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:40.720]  point where you're not going to be able to turn up the volume anymore you're
[02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:43.480]  not going to be able to play any louder the lack of a better way to put it and
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:47.960]  something new is going to need to happen it'll be in that it'll be in that
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:53.040]  moment that decisive moment where a completely new paradigm can be born and
[02:21:53.040 --> 02:21:55.760]  all of us are going to have to have a different level of responsibility in
[02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:58.200]  this culture and that's sort of what I've been talking about as I've been
[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:02.080]  promoting my album because I'm getting asked a lot of questions about how
[02:22:02.080 --> 02:22:05.520]  musicians can exist rightfully in the new culture and I keep talking about
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:09.680]  self-responsibility entrepreneurship and at the same time as the audience needs
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:12.760]  to meet them somewhere in the middle where they need to support and artists
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:16.560]  who's being real as opposed to let's say the robot class and we see these
[02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:19.880]  parallels everywhere in culture we see in Hollywood we see it even in the
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:22.720]  political class where occasionally somebody actually stands up and tries to
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:25.320]  have a good idea and I know lately you've been talking a lot about what's
[02:22:25.320 --> 02:22:30.080]  going on with Ron Paul and Rand Paul and the way people feel betrayed and you
[02:22:30.080 --> 02:22:33.640]  know and whether this is just another shell game and I mean we're all kind of
[02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:36.720]  dealing with these different reckonings in public and then the converse though
[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:40.320]  that's very different is well how should we react and this is the difference
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:43.720]  we're no longer just sheep sort of sitting there with our hands over our
[02:22:43.720 --> 02:22:47.000]  ears we're saying we must do something and and we have to form the new
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.960]  paradigms of what we can actually do I agree with you I I feel the
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:56.080]  responsibility that I have a platform to reach millions that I should be doing a
[02:22:56.080 --> 02:23:01.320]  better job I catch myself getting drug back into anger getting getting you know
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:06.640]  kind of rabbit trailed often the things that they put out and I'm over
[02:23:06.640 --> 02:23:11.200]  analyzing and I think it's important that all of us that know the truth stop
[02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:15.520]  over analyzing and know that we're trying to do the right thing we we want
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:19.200]  to make a better planet we want our species to survive we want to be less
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:25.000]  violent because I found that good people to oversimplify it tend to over
[02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.120]  analyze ourselves I mean here's an example and you may not have known this
[02:23:28.120 --> 02:23:34.920]  15 20 years ago but I'm sure you know it now and I'm not just kissing your here
[02:23:34.920 --> 02:23:39.040]  Mr. Corrigan getting to know you a little bit you know listening to what
[02:23:39.040 --> 02:23:42.800]  you've had to say over the years I know why the power structure that's very
[02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:49.440]  shrewd from day one is being attacking you because you are intelligent you are
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:55.800]  a threat to their system you are a maverick and the zombies and the robot
[02:23:55.800 --> 02:24:01.640]  class tend to peck at those that they see as a threat if you were a leader
[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:06.680]  within the system then it wouldn't be a problem and that's why even though the
[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:10.600]  reviewers are having to admit that okay this is a really good album well it's
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:14.640]  you know selling a lot of copies people are excited about it there's still a
[02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:18.120]  lot of little snipes when I was reviewing the last few days what's
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:21.440]  being said but that's a badge of honor and I've noticed over the years
[02:24:21.440 --> 02:24:24.840]  sometimes you've kind of responded to that and said I don't know why you're
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:29.560]  doing that well look I know why they're doing it it's more than just jealousy
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:34.480]  it's the fact that you make them uncomfortable and the system knows that
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:39.360]  as you mature people like you are a real threat because you could influence
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:43.280]  others in your sphere to turn against the system I've seen this happen in
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:47.520]  Hollywood I've seen this happen in business circles the system is very
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:52.120]  good at spotting people that see through the matrix or they're good at spotting
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:57.200]  people that they know will someday fully break the trance and come out of the
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:02.520]  matrix your comments on that statement well thank you that's a
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:08.720]  big compliment to take my my thought on it is that you know it's a little bit
[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:13.480]  like the old Soviet system if there is a system of control at the top if there's
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:17.160]  a if there's somebody sitting in a room somewhere we don't know his or her name
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:22.120]  and they're dictating like a puppet master well they're putting people in
[02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:27.960]  place on those on those lower rungs those local government rungs to to dissuade
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:32.040]  independent thinking I mean you know we've all seen those YouTube clips where
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:36.280]  somebody stands up at a local city council meeting goes why are we putting
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:40.960]  you know aluminum in our water and then you know the guy hits the gavel sit down
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:43.840]  you know you're not allowed to talk well according to the rules I have five
[02:25:43.840 --> 02:25:47.760]  minutes no you know you know this kind of stuff you want to whack them old people
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.120]  at the bottom level if you actually make it up to the middle level or in my case
[02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:56.080]  you know the upper levels you see different things you see a different
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:26:00.240]  discourse behind the scenes if I can give anybody my own view from my
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:05.200]  experiences let's call it behind this the please the term the matrix having been
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:09.400]  at the top levels having been in the White House and talking to people behind
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:15.320]  the scenes having been in parties where there's 14 a-listers in the same room
[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:21.360]  that I'm in the elite class to use your terminology there's a sort of an amoral
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:26.400]  characteristic they look at it sort of as a business as usual and there's
[02:26:26.400 --> 02:26:32.680]  something sort of kind of I ran about it you know you know this idea of progress
[02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:36.120]  marching forward and if you run over some skulls that's just the way it goes
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:40.960]  and then there's something sort of frightening about it which is like what
[02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:44.080]  about the guy who's you know just a good guy and he just wants to put some
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:47.480]  bread on his table and the and you know he just gets crushed under the wheels of
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.720]  that system that doesn't really individualize him in essence wants to
[02:26:50.720 --> 02:26:56.520]  see him as a statistic being somebody who sort of has operated inside and
[02:26:56.520 --> 02:27:00.840]  outside systems having once been outside and having been completely
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:04.800]  integrated having begin been given every version of the sellout option having
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:10.040]  not taken it having been sort of almost a humiliated as an idiot for not kind of
[02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:15.520]  going with the flow they actually say that in the reviews they say you didn't
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:19.320]  sell out on purpose they admit that and they hate the fact that you did it your
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:23.120]  way and they seem to hate it even more now that you're still having even bigger
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:28.880]  success doing it your way I'm sorry go ahead no I think I think I appreciate
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:33.760]  the praise in that but I think what I'm trying to say is look around your world
[02:27:33.760 --> 02:27:37.760]  anybody listening and look at those independent thinkers and see how they
[02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:41.680]  run them to that same gauntlet I have to think at this point having been in
[02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:45.360]  public life for 20 years that there's a systemic belief there now is it as
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:49.440]  pernicious as somebody sitting in office and saying get him get her I don't think
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:53.560]  it I think it's just a system that's evolved from some sort of subconscious
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:57.480]  place much like how the way kids will bully in school it's not an agreement
[02:27:57.480 --> 02:28:00.560]  the bullies don't go in the corner so you ought to pick on the kid they just sort
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:03.880]  of unconsciously will prey upon the week because they want to front for all the
[02:28:03.880 --> 02:28:08.920]  girls or whatever it's very similar I've run it writers I mean here's a perfect
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:16.360]  example I run into writers that will come into a room shake my hand be very
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:19.480]  nice to me you know you know how you doing they know how you've been since
[02:28:19.480 --> 02:28:22.920]  the last time we talked all good flip the light on or put the press record
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:27.880]  rip me apart where I'm like I'm like literally backpedaling from the
[02:28:27.880 --> 02:28:31.320]  interview like whoa like where's this coming from and as a younger man I
[02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:35.640]  didn't really know how to handle that the interview ends the guy stands up and
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:39.120]  says oh great interview thanks so much then you read the thing to come out of
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:43.560]  the paper and he says oh he he was a he was a fool he was a nervous idiot he
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:48.080]  was he was biting his nails to the quick I mean he can't be trusted I think who
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:52.680]  are they talking about now is that guy or that girl is are they part of some
[02:28:52.680 --> 02:28:55.960]  sort of conscious system I don't really necessarily believe that I think it's
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:29:00.360]  more an unconscious urge to please we're gonna come back and speak with Billy
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:04.400]  Corrigan I'm smashing pumpkins here in just a moment smashing pumpkins.com is

[02:31:16.080 --> 02:31:20.000]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:24.120]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[02:33:24.120 --> 02:33:36.080]  and we are back with the front man the founder of smashing pumpkins Billy
[02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:40.320]  Corrigan and you just heard part of Panopticon that of course is a system of
[02:33:40.320 --> 02:33:45.200]  surveillance where you think you're always being watched what's that song
[02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:49.600]  about as if the name doesn't tell us Billy you know I think it sort of deals
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:56.520]  with the duality of the two systems right one system being this idea that
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:59.520]  we're always being surveyed now like you can't go down the street without some
[02:33:59.520 --> 02:34:04.200]  CCTV camera picking up right and then on another sense there is this eye in the
[02:34:04.200 --> 02:34:08.680]  sky keeping an eye on us you know so you have a benign system and you have a
[02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:13.680]  malicious system in my opinion and so it's sort of like how it feels to be in
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:18.200]  between those two ideas no no exactly I've learned watching these globalists
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:21.440]  and I've seen some of the same things you've seen from different angles they
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:25.480]  just know how to pick individuals that fill that space they go out in the
[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:30.040]  garden and basically out of the millions and millions of people out there
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:34.560]  they just select and they can look at the college transcripts how they wrote
[02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:38.320]  at the college paper did they do what the editor wanted and they can just
[02:34:38.320 --> 02:34:43.960]  select the exact type they want and then put them in that position yeah there
[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:49.960]  does seem to be let's call it a bootlicking class yeah you know I believe
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:55.760]  Roger Waters you know the great auteur of Pink Floyd really identifies that in
[02:34:55.760 --> 02:35:02.120]  his incredible work at the wall this kind of fascist undertone to
[02:35:02.120 --> 02:35:06.880]  a slavish going along you know I mean obviously in the wall he addresses a
[02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:12.040]  World War II his father being killed for what purpose was it a just purpose was
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:15.400]  it a not purpose did anyone really care did anybody remember his father after
[02:35:15.400 --> 02:35:19.280]  his sacrifice all the things he wrestled with and then somehow that very
[02:35:19.280 --> 02:35:24.960]  intuitively intertwines with fascism and I think that's really an incredible
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:30.520]  deep insight from Roger in that particular work about where that thin
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:36.120]  line of where being a slavery a slave on some level even if it's a psychological
[02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:39.240]  slave even if it's just a willingness to go along because you just don't want to
[02:35:39.240 --> 02:35:43.800]  bother how that somehow leads to this kind of other weird freakish control
[02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:49.720]  system and and I think what we're all reckoning with is again we know
[02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:55.760]  something is there is it as nefarious as you go into sometimes perhaps or is it
[02:35:55.760 --> 02:35:59.400]  a system that's just been in play for thousands of years and nobody's even
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:03.480]  really at the wheel and it's just kind of rumbling along because it just seems
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:07.040]  to work and there's a lot lots of money well that's what Richard Nixon said he
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:11.800]  said it's a wild beast you can't control it and so a lot of it is automated but
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:16.920]  that the the dark generals of this system know how to guide and massage and
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:20.880]  understand those tricks but you just went right back to that key again it's
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:26.200]  this fake patriotism of using the troops and the flags and the idea but in
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:29.840]  reality you treat the troops like garbage you take their their death
[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:34.880]  benefits you give them the worst doctors the Homeland Security documents say
[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:39.640]  they're the real threat but meanwhile the whole fascist war machine
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:44.600]  camouflages itself as the guy down the road who went to fight because he wanted
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:49.160]  to protect America and it's all a fraud but people are invested in it so they
[02:36:49.160 --> 02:36:52.440]  don't want to say it's wrong we've only got about six seven minutes left because
[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:57.320]  Billy's got to run us I like to touch on that a second because because you know
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:03.520]  I have friends that are veterans and and that's where the that's where we have
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:07.200]  to make a difference you see we have to come we have to bring these guys back
[02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:11.440]  into our communities we have to listen to what they learned we have to let them
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:15.760]  we have to you know encourage their voices we can't we can't demonize them
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:20.800]  for being caught up in a system that maybe they're now realizing didn't stand
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:23.960]  by them like they thought they were standing by it and that's the very
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:27.720]  difficult thing especially if you if you love your country because where do you
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:32.280]  draw those lines at least on the local level or the relationship level we can
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:36.440]  support those people and to integrating them back into American life because
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:40.200]  they're having a really hard time obviously what I saw this on drudge
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:43.720]  report the other day and you know never know whether things are true or not but
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:47.720]  it's at the second highest rate of fatality and in the army right now
[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:53.920]  with suicide is that was that true yes sir actually in Afghanistan it's the
[02:37:53.920 --> 02:38:00.440]  number one cause and some months it's the number one cause overall the suicide
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:05.840]  rate is roughly seven times what it was even in Vietnam because they're
[02:38:05.840 --> 02:38:11.080]  sending people in three four five six seven tours many men who were in World
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:16.240]  War two one tour suffered all sorts of serious problems and now we bring them
[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:20.000]  back here and treat them like garbage very well said they've been caught up in
[02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:24.760]  this destructive fraud that is chewing up and murdering innocent people overseas
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:30.200]  but doing it here on the other end in a more sneaky devilish way I want to
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:34.440]  race in the time we've got left here Billy through a raft of questions and
[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:38.160]  then any final points you've got I think this is an amazing interview let's
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:44.600]  continue here with other issues GMO your take on genetically modified organisms
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:50.280]  I mean I'm no rocket scientist but you have corn that the bugs can't eat
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:54.400]  because it grows its own pesticide but then we feed it to humans and then in
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:59.320]  the studies it's causing organ failure in the rats what's your view on GMO and
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:03.440]  what do you think the power structure is doing there well I tend to look at
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:06.240]  something like this is pretty simple number one it's not going to go away
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:12.360]  right so what do we do about it I think it's something like I asked the
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:16.480]  question like this why don't we have a choice as a consumer to know whether or
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:19.920]  not we're consuming these foods it's becoming more and more difficult to be
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:24.040]  able to identify whether or not we're actually eating genetically modified
[02:39:24.040 --> 02:39:27.840]  food that's where it's like okay if we can't stop it at the top why can't we
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:31.560]  stop it at the bottom I need we need to fight those fights and just circling
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:36.480]  back to the to the to the veterans again you know for okay so if we know
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:40.640]  something like this where is this public discourse that we should be having you
[02:39:40.640 --> 02:39:43.640]  know why why aren't there congressional hearings why why don't we have this
[02:39:43.640 --> 02:39:49.360]  airing out especially on on patriotic you know quotation news sources like Fox
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.040]  News wires and there are bigger discussion going on that's where I get
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:56.920]  suspicious you see what I'm saying the stuff you allude to sometimes you know
[02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:59.920]  I don't have the personal information necessarily to know whether or not that's
[02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:03.960]  true I can sort of on on face value say well there's something there's whether
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:08.520]  smoke there's fire where I go to is why don't certain systems necessarily then
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:12.800]  come into play when you would you would think they would if we if we know now
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:17.240]  that the suicide is very high amongst our soldiers why isn't there a movement
[02:40:17.240 --> 02:40:23.040]  in the country to figure out why now you can say intuitively I know why right
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:27.120]  but you can also engage a system to say there must be a reckoning there must be
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:30.880]  an account of exactly why don't they care why aren't they making that the story
[02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:34.080]  of the boy at the bottom of the well but we have to make that the story that's
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:37.480]  what I'm saying but you you you used to listen to the radio you thought you know
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:41.800]  what I got something else to say you started your own station right okay I
[02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:45.040]  used to look at rock and roll and say I can do this better I can do this
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:47.720]  different I started my own rock and roll band which turned into my own radio
[02:40:47.720 --> 02:40:51.720]  station you see so this is the thing we need to start our own radio station we
[02:40:51.720 --> 02:40:55.680]  need to start our own blog all need to be the individuals we are and that way
[02:40:55.680 --> 02:41:00.080]  the cookie cutter Borg cannot overtake us you're very well said that's what
[02:41:00.080 --> 02:41:04.600]  that's why and when we talk before and I and I talk to say this don't get caught
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:09.760]  in this left-right stuff you know I mean look at look at a human being who's
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:13.960]  come back from a war whether or not you agree with why they were there why they
[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:18.320]  enlisted you look at a human being and you see that person hurting and you do
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:23.720]  not let lend your hand okay you're and then you're not in line with Christ or
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:27.880]  Buddha or whatever you believe it you're not in line with you're in line you're
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:31.520]  basically falling into the same ditch that everybody else they divide and
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:35.280]  conquer us and they do it scientifically if you lead with your heart you'll see a
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:39.800]  person who's standing there that needs help right so if we look at the country
[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:46.520]  at these wounded warriors or you know or wire like I think I saw on your side or
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:50.720]  it was drudge where these kids are now coming up with these GMO pesticides in
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:54.920]  their system okay we need to do something about that we need to stand up and
[02:41:54.920 --> 02:41:59.440]  okay in my case I'm willing to put my public cash out there and say these are
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:02.720]  the questions that need to be asked and then somebody's gonna try to drill me
[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:05.400]  from the left and drill me from the right because I'm not a scientist of
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:09.160]  course I'm not a scientist I'm a rock star I'm less than a scientist but you
[02:42:09.160 --> 02:42:12.920]  can go research the scientific reports that are out there you can ask the
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:17.040]  question right okay and then as an American public if there's enough of us
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:20.800]  we can demand an answer sure why is cancer increasing instead of looking for
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:24.680]  the cure why aren't we looking for the cause all right Billy I've got to throw
[02:42:24.680 --> 02:42:30.440]  this in here at the end I've seen over 500 articles literally saying there are
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:34.440]  no drones now the Washington Post announced 40 plus billion dollars to
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:39.200]  launch 30,000 of them in the next eight years they're arresting cattle thieves
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:44.080]  with them in North Dakota they've got drones here in the town I live in the
[02:42:44.080 --> 02:42:47.480]  police are now arming them that's all over the news but they've come out and
[02:42:47.480 --> 02:42:51.160]  said oh my gosh the farmers are all upset and the American people are upset
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:54.720]  it's not happening so I think they were trying to shove that down our throat the
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:58.520]  backlash came and so now they're saying everything is fine but my point is here
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:03.840]  babbling is that things like the TSA groping us things like checkpoints on
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:07.960]  highways or drones above us I think fundamentally gets through to the public
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:11.880]  that hey this whole military system we've paid for to dominate the globe it's
[02:43:11.880 --> 02:43:16.480]  now coming back on us your take on the drones the TSA and anything else you'd
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:22.960]  like to add in closing you know I think it's um look there's an inevitability to
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:29.400]  what's going on we all read 1984 in school our brave new world where this
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:34.760]  kind of dystopia was sort of sketched out of course in school we read these
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:38.480]  books with the idea that we'll never live in a society like this and now we're
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:42.080]  waking up and realizing that we are the cell job of course is going to be it's
[02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:48.280]  going to make us safer if we all have some RFID chip on us you know no one
[02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:51.600]  will be able to commit a murder because we'll always know where everybody is you
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:55.920]  know you or God forbid a kid goes missing one of the worst things I can
[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:59.440]  think of we'll be able to trace where that kid went and who was with that kid
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:03.120]  that's going to be the cell job now we're gonna have to make really critical
[02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:08.960]  decisions as a culture and a society and as a world populace what what for what
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:15.160]  price freedom but so far in the last decade since or plus since 911 the
[02:44:15.160 --> 02:44:21.400]  American public seems really okay with it shockingly so and it's difficult to
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:27.480]  imagine that we seem to be hurling in this direction with no break on and
[02:44:27.480 --> 02:44:30.880]  and it's certainly if there's a nefarious system that wants to put these
[02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:36.640]  things in place they've seen the apathy you remember there was that day the you
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:40.880]  know the protest the TSA day and all that and and unfortunately millions of
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.880]  people didn't didn't do anything and that was the end of that you know you
[02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:50.720]  know so if we know this is coming you know at what point do we say no at what
[02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:54.720]  point do we say we're not going to accept this anymore collectively because as
[02:44:54.720 --> 02:44:59.880]  individuals you can sit there and bitch in moan all you want you know if you're
[02:44:59.880 --> 02:45:02.880]  just going to be one hero standing alone in the wilderness it's not going to
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:07.920]  work it's going to take a collective effort and it's going to take a
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:14.280]  synthesizing of voices that have a kind of a collective belief it can't be that
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:17.800]  that left-right stuff because that's always going to break down into an
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:22.920]  argument it has to be a fundamental belief that you know it's like when we
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:26.120]  cross the street we take a chance of getting hit by a car just kind of part
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:30.200]  what goes the crossing the street you call it the nanny state you know at some
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:34.160]  point is the majority of our country do they want to live in a nanny state so
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:40.360]  far the vote seems specifically but specifically you fly a lot and you have
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:46.560]  any horror stories with the TSA no I'm lucky in that you know I you know I
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:51.400]  opt out I refuse to walk through the scanning machines I've read the
[02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:55.240]  scientific data you know I've done my own research I don't feel comfortable going
[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:59.760]  through those machines I've seen you know where I've been radiated in other
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:03.520]  points of my life just through x-rays and stuff where it hurt my immune system
[02:46:03.520 --> 02:46:10.560]  you know I have enough problems with that as it is just by the my schedule and
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:16.320]  my lifestyle so I choose to opt out you know 19 times out of 20 I've been
[02:46:16.320 --> 02:46:19.760]  treated very courtlessly and professionally and so I don't have a
[02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:25.560]  particular complaint that being said I disagree with the idea and of course
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:30.160]  what's really weird is that we go to Europe or other places and the systems
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:35.280]  are different so again on just on logic right just on you know normal human
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:41.000]  logic why isn't there a homogenized system if the threat is the same
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:46.440]  everywhere that that's what I find curious very well said I'm gonna let
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:50.200]  you go hopefully can talk to you when you get back to town hopefully someday we
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:55.400]  run into each other again and I'll say hi to mancalf this is all fair and I
[02:46:55.400 --> 02:47:00.680]  can cut this in anywhere but anything else you want to add Billy anything else
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:04.080]  that youth I would like to impart to the audience or try to get folks to think
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:09.640]  about if I had any any just general message from from my perspective it's
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:13.600]  that we all have to take responsibility and we all have to do something in my
[02:47:13.600 --> 02:47:18.520]  case I'm willing to talk about these things openly and kind of fit more in
[02:47:18.520 --> 02:47:23.280]  the in the energy of hope but not the Pollyanna version I believe in the
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:29.000]  goodness of most people there there is evil in the world and and and if God
[02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:32.480]  has taught us anything the only way to combat evil is is to be better than
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:36.920]  evil with light and love and so we must embrace our families our communities we
[02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:40.240]  must really care about our brothers and sisters and if we don't then we are just
[02:47:40.240 --> 02:47:44.480]  as as was once famously said in the 60s if you're not part of the solution you're
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:50.040]  part of the problem well said it's Hunter S. Thompson quote yeah trust in God but
[02:47:50.040 --> 02:47:54.240]  roll away from the rocks of the better one saying that he was paraphrasing a
[02:47:54.240 --> 02:47:58.360]  trust in God the top your camel yes trust but but but you've got to have
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:01.960]  right action Billy Corrigan smashing pumpkins.com again
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:05.800]  congratulations on your new record I love it and it's definitely in my
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:09.280]  playlist thank you so much for spending time with us and be safe down in South
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:14.280]  America. Thank you Alex God bless. Folks there goes Billy Corrigan well now that
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:18.160]  Mr. Corrigan has left us I've got a few things to say about him he really does
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:23.160]  have courage for every 10 or 15 famous people that we end up getting
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:27.960]  contacted by or that I run into and talk to who are awake maybe one of them is
[02:48:27.960 --> 02:48:32.760]  willing to come on the show because the system does come after you but we're
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:36.360]  gonna lose everything if we don't reverse what's happening if the globalist
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:42.880]  don't realize that their system is insane and that even though they think
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:50.240]  they're in control of it the blowback is going to destroy them as well as us and
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:54.560]  you know Billy's talked about well people didn't stand up so nothing
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:57.600]  happened that was the one point I disagreed with him but we didn't have
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:03.040]  time in the interview to get into it I with others help organize the national
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:07.840]  opt-out day and for more than two weeks they just turned the scanners off
[02:49:07.840 --> 02:49:12.520]  almost everywhere for two days the day of Thanksgiving and after they totally
[02:49:12.520 --> 02:49:16.760]  turned them off and there's lawsuits over that Bob Barr is suing them to get
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:20.760]  the documents you know to find out why they did that but the answer is pretty
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:24.280]  simple they didn't want to give us a chance to start a new civil rights
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:28.960]  movement they didn't want to give us a chance to really show our power that's
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:32.560]  what they do every time we try to take the field against the New World Order and
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:36.880]  we're going to win they back off they disappear they strike when they want to
[02:49:36.880 --> 02:49:43.320]  strike it's a guerrilla war on us it's it's it's jungle hit-and-run attacks we've
[02:49:43.320 --> 02:49:46.880]  got to do the same thing in the info war every little thing you do where you're
[02:49:46.880 --> 02:49:50.520]  individualistic where you don't just put something out that was pre-programmed
[02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:54.800]  sabotage is their system of predicting what we're going to do and how our
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:58.760]  social movements operate let me tell you I was impressed by that interview and I'm
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:02.720]  very impressed by Billy Corrigan and this new album in fact I think it's probably
[02:50:02.720 --> 02:50:05.560]  the best album he's ever put out even better than the stuff that came out in
[02:50:05.560 --> 02:50:10.880]  the early and mid 90s and it's good to have people like him out there who are
[02:50:10.880 --> 02:50:16.080]  reaching millions of others with the message of think for yourself all right

[02:54:50.760 --> 02:54:54.480]  know all about al-Qaeda better chance of being killed by a honey bee sting look
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:58.560]  up the statistics on that you know all about things that are non-existence
[02:54:58.560 --> 02:55:04.560]  it's like jaws for two years after that movie came out in the early 70s they had
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:08.840]  over 50% less people at the beaches in the United States same thing in
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:12.440]  Australia other areas because people thought that big gray shark was out there
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:16.920]  was gonna eat them less than five people die a year on average worldwide from
[02:55:16.920 --> 02:55:21.000]  great whites but because there's so much coverage you know about it and even when
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.440]  I'm out in the ocean I sometimes kind of think about it even though I
[02:55:23.440 --> 02:55:27.600]  consciously know I've got a better chance of being hit by a meteorite or
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:32.560]  struck by lightning twice than I do being eaten by a great white it's a total
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:38.000]  joke ladies and gentlemen why am I bringing up democide why is democide so
[02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:43.280]  important because we're told the drones the checkpoints the police state all of
[02:55:43.280 --> 02:55:47.360]  this is for our safety but the number one historical threat in history is
[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:52.480]  governments setting up these police states for our supposed safety and now
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:57.320]  the Pentagon admits they want regular army and Marines in every city to respond
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:02.840]  to terrorists and they say the new terrorists are the American people so
[02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:06.640]  all their excuses of taking our liberties and freedoms for our safety our
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:12.680]  frauds the number one threat is this national security state run by the
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:17.000]  private mega banks that are monopoly men we're told to fear our neighbors we're
[02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:20.760]  told to fear you know the evil Arabs as they call them we're told to fear all
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:24.680]  of this but we should fear big government our founders two hundred and
[02:56:24.680 --> 02:56:29.240]  thirty-five years ago they knew the big threat read what Thomas Jefferson said
[02:56:29.240 --> 02:56:33.040]  read what George Washington talked about read what other philosophers Victor
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:38.880]  Hugo and France talked about the state is the big threat because it can get
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:42.400]  away with almost anything it controls the military it controls the police
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:47.600]  and when special interests get control of it look out that's our talk with Billy
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:51.080]  Corrigan and that's my addendum to it I want to thank Billy for spending time
