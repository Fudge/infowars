[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]  So bad, and I meant to write notes on this, with Fetzer. He won't let him talk, at all.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.020]  He just keeps calling him an American hater. Fetzer, who's a pretty aggressive guy, kind
[00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.760]  of takes it. And of course he knows he won't be allowed back on him, he doesn't sit there
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.680]  and take it. I mean, listen, I've had Fox set me up about six times the last few months
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.280]  and they always cancel. Because they're afraid. I will go on there and clean their clocks.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.320]  I am not intimidated by Bill O'Reilly. The guy's a punk. He's a punk. And he's a fake.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.200]  And he's a joke. Let's go ahead and play a little bit of this, then we'll go to break
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200]  and I'll write notes. I'm going to come back, I'll comment, I'll clip you here. We'll come
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.640]  back and play the rest of it. Here is Bill O'Reilly attacking Fetzer on Fox. What was
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.640]  it last night?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.920]  Get back to the segment tonight. As we told you last night, University of Wisconsin instructor
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.540]  Kevin Barrett has called President Bush a murderer, saying he orchestrated 9-11 without
[00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.360]  providing a shred of evidence of that charge. Despite that defamation, Barrett, teaching
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.800]  a course on Islam this semester at the University of Wisconsin. The only sanction against him
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.400]  is an order to stop making public statements. Joining us now from Madison is James Fetzer,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.600]  a recent retired professor from the University of Minnesota Duluth who supports Barrett.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.800]  You know, I'm getting a little tired of Barrett and Ward Churchill and other college professors
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.680]  who hate their country and who bring this hatred onto a campus full of impressionable
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.320]  students. Am I wrong to be offended and angry about that, sir?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.720]  Well, you are wrong, Bill, because you haven't studied the case. We've created an organization
[00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.240]  consisting of experts and scholars, pilots, aeronautical engineers, mechanical engineers,
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.860]  structural engineers, civil engineers, physicists. We've been examining what the government's
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.780]  been telling us, and frankly, Bill, it's a fantasy. None of the major claims made by
[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.420]  the government can be sustained. We've been looking at this from every point of view.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.620]  The government has a story it wants to sell us. We're not buying it.
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.380]  Okay, you don't have to buy anything. You're American. You want to be a nut, you can be
[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.540]  a nut, and you are a nut, because in order for any conspiracy of this magnitude to take
[00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.540]  place, thousands of Americans would have to buy into it, would have to know about it,
[00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.740]  and would have to keep their mouth shut about it. That's never going to happen. You're like
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.980]  the guys who think that the space aliens kidnapped Elvis or something like that. That's
[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.380]  where you are, in my opinion. So your opinion is that Bush murdered everybody on 9-11 to
[00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.060]  seize control and make him the dictator of America, whatever crazy thing it is. In my
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.580]  opinion is, you are nuts. We're both entitled to our opinion, okay? So you're entitled and
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.460]  I'm entitled, and we'll let the folks decide.
[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:37.220]  Talk it.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.380]  Hold it, hold it. But now you have a guy, Barrett, who's in a classroom, and we had
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.980]  the students on last night, and believe me, the students don't know very much. And here's
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.180]  Barrett, and here's Ward Churchill, and they're bringing their crazy theories in, explaining
[00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.540]  this, that, and the other things.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.540]  I wrote eight different points in the first two minutes of Bill, Pervert, Sexual Harasser,
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.620]  Rylan. Okay? When we get back, I'm going to go over those first eight.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.740]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.300]  Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.740]  are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.900]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.780]  were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.620]  us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret
[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.060]  police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.940]  guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.460]  crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get

[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.600]  Ken Jenkins coming up in the second segment of the next hour. It will be about eight after.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.520]  We will have open phones during that interview as well, maybe even keeping a little bit into
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.080]  the third hour. Again, it is Friday. All right, I'm going to air the rest of the O'Reilly
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.660]  clip in a minute. He basically doesn't let Fetzer talk after that first three sentences
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:50.580]  he allowed him to say. Let's go through it. This is eight points. Did I just scribble
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:56.880]  down earlier? There were a lot more. He states, you're a nut, no facts, over and over again.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.960]  That's an ad hominem. That's just name calling. He says space aliens abducting Elvis, combining
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:10.320]  two of the archetypal kook ideas that really the media has popularized as a joke. He then
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.560]  talks about Ward Churchill who said the people, he did say something despicable. He said the
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:21.200]  people that died in those towers were a bunch of Nazis. They worked for the Nazis. So Al
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:27.600]  Qaeda was this great wonderful thing striking the evil American empire. That is classic
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.600]  military industrial complex controlled fake liberal trash. Ward Churchill, I've been around
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.640]  him personally. I know people that have interviewed him. He's rude and mean offset. He is a hate
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.640]  filled bigot. He's the extreme, but I still think he has the right to go spew his Ford
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.680]  foundation stuff. Kevin Barrett is an intelligent, dynamic, and foreign person who they're saying
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.960]  has no facts, but he wouldn't let him give any of the facts. Kevin Barrett brings up
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.780]  nothing but facts. So they're trying to kill academic freedom in this country and they
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:08.780]  limited what Fetzer could say. So you had all of that attempt to mix him in with Churchill.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.440]  What Kevin Barrett and others are saying is the facts that Al Qaeda is really CIA, is
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.920]  a front, is a creation. We have the evidence. We have Zbigniew Brzezinski bragging about
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.880]  Operation Cyclone, the admissions, starting the war with the Russians. The Russians didn't
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.160]  just come in and attack the Afghans. The Afghans attacked them and then the Russians came in.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.560]  We have him saying, show me one mainstream newspaper, the New York Times, this, this,
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.040]  and that. They all hate Bush. Why, they would all print this if they could. It's the New
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.320]  York Times. It's all CIA infiltrated going back to the church hearings in the 70s. They're
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.820]  the folks that put out the aluminum tubes, the yellow cake. They pose as liberals. They
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.360]  are gatekeepers. They're there to control liberals in this country who they're afraid
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:58.920]  of. They're there as Judas goes to corral you. It's basic psychology, basic, basic manipulation
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:04.560]  here. Good cop, bad cop. And he says they would report on it. Well, they've been forced
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.080]  to report many of the facts of the truth movement. They've been forced to come out and write
[00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:14.240]  hit pieces on us. In fact, many of the publications he mentioned have written hit pieces on myself
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.040]  personally, saying the Bilderberg group doesn't exist. I'm crazy. Five years ago in the New
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.080]  York Times. Now, the Washington Post has attacked me saying, you know, that we're all
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.920]  a bunch of cougs, but never giving any information. They attacked me two weeks after 9-11, a week
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.720]  and a half after. And then they say thousands of Americans would have to be involved to
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.200]  cover this up. Well, thousands knew that tens of thousands of black men weren't just allowed
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.320]  to have syphilis for 40 plus years, but were allowed to spread it and in some cases were
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.200]  given it. With Tuskegee, 110,000 Jewish children irradiated under US government funding in
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.760]  Israel. Kept secret until a few years ago, now front page in Israel. The fact that over
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.420]  10,000 Nazis were brought here to run almost every federal program, from rocketry to torture
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:04.420]  to surveillance to COINTELPRO. Nazis, 10 plus thousand of them. And my grandpa was an oil
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.000]  hand and a leash hound out in Midland. There were Nazis everywhere out there. This is the
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.880]  reality of what's going on. So he says thousands couldn't do this. Oh yeah, over 100,000 involved
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:20.560]  in the Manhattan Project, secret for three and a half years. Of course they kept it secret.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.360]  It only took about 200 people, with all the different analysts and people that have studied
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.480]  this, people that have been in black ops, 200 to plant the bombs, run the attacks, everything.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.540]  And if you don't think this government doesn't have 200 people that will kill 3,000 Americans
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.480]  for total power and control, you got another thing coming. Folks, they kill millions of
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.920]  us every year with the drug company drugs, with the malpractice, with the stuff in our
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.840]  food, with the stuff in our water. They could care less about you. They dump pure nerve
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.600]  gas off the coast of North Carolina.

[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:10.880]  Paging War on Corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:22.640]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:29.640]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.960]  All right, I'm continuing for this little five-minute segment with my analysis of Bill
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.440]  O'Reilly. And then coming up, we're going to have Ken Jenkins of 9-11 Truth in the studio,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:48.320]  a great filmmaker. And we're really excited to have him joining us. He's going to be here
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.880]  in Austin tonight. He is here in Austin today showing his new film. We'll tell you all about
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.240]  that coming up. And get into 9-11 and take your phone calls. We talk a lot about 9-11
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.240]  every week here because it is a foundation event, something that they've used as a pretext
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:07.680]  for their entire geopolitical and domestic policy. But let's play the second half of
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:13.280]  O'Reilly, who, number one, won't let Jim Fetzer talk, the founder, one of the heads
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:19.640]  of 9-11 Truth, who hits every buzzword that he believes in, space aliens and Elvis is
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.760]  kidnapped and he's a nut and he has no facts and no newspapers will print what he's saying.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:31.120]  And the newspapers he links are the worst CIA fronts. Fake news, 1.6 billion that Bush
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:36.840]  paid for, admittedly. That was in the news last year. Fake reporters everywhere. Hit
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:41.520]  pieces everywhere. This just doesn't work anymore, O'Reilly, telling us how, oh, the
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:47.080]  liberal media would love to attack Bush. It's not liberal media. It's not conservative media.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.760]  It's military-industrial complex media. Unbelievable. And there have been a few fair ones. The new
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:56.300]  one in Vanity Fair was fair. There have been a few fair here and there. I talk to reporters
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.760]  all the time. They go, oh, we know the truth. My editor won't let me get it out. But I'll
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.480]  try to at least let you get a few of your quotes in on your website and I'll show the
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.880]  other side but try not to make you look too bad. I know all about it. I'm sorry. I'm controlled.
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.980]  I'm pathetic. I've talked to scores of them. I don't want to get into names here. When
[00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:20.280]  they admit to you, they know, but that they can't. I've talked to CNN people for some
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:23.480]  of the biggest shows and they go, oh, we know it's CIA. We know it's all controlled up here.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.640]  You know, on their cell phone after hours and they say, call them back. They go, yeah,
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.480]  we had you on and then Chairman King got real mad at CNN and so he refused to come
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.000]  on and now you're not going to come on. We've canceled Ed Asner. You know, oh yeah, we got
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.240]  pressure from the government. And then there have been reporters likely come out and go,
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.040]  we got pressure from the government. I mean, how do you think this works? Here's the rest
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:48.680]  of O'Reilly. You got that O'Reilly Club ready, bro? In my opinion. So your opinion is that
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:54.160]  Bush murdered everybody on 9-11 to seize control and make him the dictator of America, whatever
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:59.160]  a crazy thing it is. In my opinion is you're nuts. We're both entitled to our opinion.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.680]  Okay? So you're entitled and I'm entitled and we'll let the folks decide. Hold it. Hold
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:09.200]  it. But now you have a guy, Barrett, who's in a classroom and we had the students on
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.080]  last night. Believe me, the students don't know very much. And here's Barrett and here's
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.920]  Ward Churchill and they're bringing their crazy theories in, explaining this, that and
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.520]  the other thing and whatever conclusions you guys have reached. And the students are there
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.920]  absorbing this. And I'm saying this is grossly irresponsible because it's based on nothing.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.240]  If you had any evidence, sir, you would be on the front page of the New York Times in
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.600]  a heartbeat. There's nothing that the hate Bush media would like more than to get a hold
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.520]  of anything you have. And you don't have anything. You can't get into San Francisco Chronicle
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:47.000]  or the National Enquirer or anywhere because you don't have anything other than a harebrained
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.280]  theory and you know it. We have hundreds of studies. We have documents. We have records.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.480]  Why can't you get on the front page of the New York Times? Anyone, Bill, anyone, Bill
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.760]  who has even looked at the collapse of Building 7 understands it came down by controlled demolition.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:05.980]  It wasn't hit by- I had guys in here who say, I had guys in here who say, you know what?
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.760]  Why can't you get this on the front page of the Boston Globe or the Atlanta Journal Constitution
[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.680]  or the Minneapolis Star Tribune? Papers that despise the Bush administration. Why can't
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.600]  you get it on the front page of those papers? The press and the media are too much dominated
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.960]  by the federal government and federal regulations, Bill. You know that. Oh, sure. The New York
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.080]  Times is dominated and afraid of the federal government when every single day they rip
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:34.640]  Bush's throat out. Come on. That doesn't make any sense. Carl Bernstein, in 1977, Carl Bernstein
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.080]  published an article in the Rolling Stone in which he explained that he'd been told
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.980]  by officials of the CIA that their greatest successes have been with CBS, with Time Life
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.100]  and with the New York Times, Bill. The situation today is much worse. Anyone who wants to know
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.940]  the truth should go to st911.org, our website. Scholars for 9-11 Truth, and they'll find
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.140]  it in spades, Bill. I recommend you go there. I hope they go to your Adobe website. Alright,
[00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.700]  we'll be right back. We'll finish up the little tail end of that later in the shower and get
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.700]  Ken Jenkins' take on it after we get him a headset so he can hear it. Stay with us, folks.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.700]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:18.700]  It's here. After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:23.180]  Storm is complete. Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:28.620]  are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.780]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.660]  were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:43.460]  us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret
[00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.900]  police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:52.780]  guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:58.300]  crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get

[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:16.700]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:22.140]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere,
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.020]  which are then readily absorbed into the body. Medical course potassium iodate gives you
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:32.700]  virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident,
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:37.120]  radioactive poisoning. Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.300]  the thyroid with good iodine. This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.980]  the harmful radioactive iodine. Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:53.780]  is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:14.940]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:24.100]  It�s Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:31.100]  All right, last hour and the end of this hour and the last segment, I was playing clips
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:38.100]  of Bill O�Reilly attacking Jim Fetzer of 9-11 Truth, scholar for 9-11 Truth, and he
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.380]  doesn�t hit him on any of the facts. He just keeps saying, �You�re a nut. You
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:54.140]  have no facts. You believe in space aliens. You�re a kook. You hate America. You and
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:00.660]  Ward Churchill�s theories.� Ward Churchill doesn�t have theories. Okay, he was there
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.780]  in Colorado and lost his professorship last time I checked because he said the people
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.180]  in the towers were Nazis and basically deserved to die. I mean, his quotes were incredible.
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:15.260]  And so notice that�see, because Al-Qaeda is good striking the evil Americans. The government
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:21.260]  would love the left to have that view. No one I know has that view, conservative, liberal,
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:27.740]  any political affiliation or term. But notice O�Reilly said it like five times, �You
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.540]  and Ward Churchill and your group, you�re with Ward Churchill and these theories.�
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.860]  Ward Churchill thinks Al-Qaeda hit America. He believes what you believe, O�Reilly.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.660]  He isn�t a quote theorist. He isn�t a researcher. Okay, he just basically hates
[00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:45.460]  white people. He�s a self-hater. Okay, I�m not into anybody who hates any race or any
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:51.660]  group or all the human race. And so stop trying to equate the 9-11 Truth moment with Ward
[00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.300]  Churchill. He does it continually. I watch the clips of him online every time he does
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.540]  it, because people hate Ward Churchill and they rightfully should disagree with him,
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.940]  in my opinion. But again, straw man, guilt by association. It�s like going, �You
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:09.340]  and Jeffrey Dahmer, well, you and Jeffrey Dahmer have these theories.� So it�s a
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.260]  very disingenuous attack. He won�t let him talk. He says they don�t have a shred of
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.340]  evidence that won�t let him talk. He then says the media would cover this. They have
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.780]  been forced to. They�ll show some of our facts and then say, �Well, we don�t know
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.860]  what to say.� Okay, we�ve proven the official story a lie. But like a lawyer, O�Reilly
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.060]  keeps repeating it, �Oh, why isn�t it in one? Oh, why isn�t it in one? Oh, why
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.220]  can�t you get it in one? Why can�t you? Ha, ha, ha.� Again, it�s that prosecutor
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:42.020]  tactic. And to a low-common denominator, the mind-numbed, Hitlerian worshippers, that�s
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.860]  what they are, who believe � I mean, folks, sometimes I watch Fox News as comedy. I�ve
[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:54.380]  played in bed before, and I�m like, �This is a joke. It is like a comic book.� So,
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:57.300]  Paul Watson, you�ve heard my rant. You�ve heard the points I�ve made. Please go get
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.180]  the points. You have whatever points you like. I want to report about O�Reilly on this,
[00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:08.580]  about O�Reilly�s dishonesty in attacking the 9-11 truth movement. He has his juvenile
[00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:16.740]  tactics. He hits every single propaganda point you can imagine. That is in the lower drawer
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:22.340]  of propaganda. He hits every point you can hit from a mindless perspective. And he�s
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:28.540]  a smart guy. He is playing to his idiot audience. OK? He�s playing to his idiot audience.
[00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.940]  Now, there�s going to be an event here tonight in Austin.
