[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  You
[01:00.000 --> 01:17.040]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well, so does he lie from the info wars.com studios
[01:17.040 --> 01:39.040]  It's Alex Jones
[01:39.040 --> 01:45.640]  Well, well, well ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones your host and I'm gonna start the show at the beginning of the next segment
[01:45.640 --> 01:50.960]  It's a new pastime a new thing we do here. Hell will probably do it tomorrow again
[01:51.960 --> 01:55.520]  I'm not ready to start the show and that's just the way it is
[01:56.360 --> 02:02.440]  I've become a little OCD over the years and if the broadcast starts with music that sounds like
[02:02.560 --> 02:08.080]  We're sitting back drinking pina coladas and just woke up in the garden to Eden before the serpent
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.080]  Well, it just makes me
[02:10.480 --> 02:15.400]  Not feel like I'm in the middle of a total fight for the complete future of human
[02:16.560 --> 02:18.560]  civilization
[02:21.040 --> 02:23.040]  So that's where we are right now I
[02:23.680 --> 02:29.360]  Will tell you it's going to be a particularly important broadcast. They're all incredibly important, but it's just amazing
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.280]  What's happening and what we've got here and the amount of preparation I personally have done
[02:34.280 --> 02:43.360]  Probably ten hours of research has gone into this two-hour program that you are about to watch and listen to and I also intend
[02:43.560 --> 02:46.040]  To open the phones up in the second hour
[02:46.800 --> 02:51.400]  I'm obsessed with the coronavirus because it is man-made and
[02:51.760 --> 02:58.480]  They're acting really sneaky about it and they're not just doing this martial law thing to create a precedent and
[02:59.080 --> 03:03.160]  Get us scared. They're like, oh, don't be scared, but we've got martial law in place
[03:03.160 --> 03:07.880]  And the UN is praising Xi Jinping for killing people in the streets at checkpoints
[03:07.920 --> 03:14.040]  But then if we don't have open borders and let more Chinese come in unvetted the UN and China is mad
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.320]  So there's just a lot of really weird stuff going on, but I know this
[03:20.320 --> 03:22.320]  They have been trying
[03:22.680 --> 03:25.040]  To plunge the stock market
[03:25.960 --> 03:30.600]  Using this information we're in economic war. They have not been successful, but they're going to try
[03:30.600 --> 03:33.840]  very very hard this week
[03:36.320 --> 03:42.440]  So we're going to be going over all of it coming up when we start the broadcast
[03:44.040 --> 03:48.520]  At the start of the next segment, I mean right now you might as well just wind your watches
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.960]  Might as well check the weather look at the thermometer. I don't know go to the
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.960]  refrigerator and get a glass of ice water because
[04:00.760 --> 04:02.760]  I've just got this big giant
[04:03.280 --> 04:08.360]  Compendium of information ready to launch ready to trigger and I've got it on the runway
[04:09.360 --> 04:11.000]  Right there
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  And that's why we're going to come back
[04:13.760 --> 04:16.360]  With something fitting for a moment like this
[04:17.360 --> 04:19.360]  Prioxyn 9
[04:19.960 --> 04:21.960]  I'm going to start the broadcast over
[04:21.960 --> 04:26.720]  And it's all gonna be peachy King
[04:27.720 --> 04:34.240]  After that point and I'm going to knock it out of the park. Thanks to all of you and all of your support. I don't know
[04:36.880 --> 04:41.320]  You know, it's like you got Labrador Retrievers in your brain. I mean you have Labrador Retriever puppies
[04:41.680 --> 04:48.560]  But then they have puppies and it's say poodles come out, you know, that music was say panic that got into the computer system
[04:48.560 --> 04:54.200]  Now we'll be right back stay with us. I'm going to clear my palate and be ready
[05:00.480 --> 05:02.800]  It is I the leader of
[05:02.960 --> 05:09.880]  Cobra here for a message to President Trump the American people and Alex Jones of info wars
[05:09.880 --> 05:18.240]  Our operation for our partners the Communist Chinese have bought control of your media, but it's true
[05:18.520 --> 05:21.160]  Your people are beginning to awaken
[05:21.680 --> 05:26.640]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war
[05:27.520 --> 05:32.840]  Machines and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America
[05:32.840 --> 05:42.000]  Anyone wants me stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump. We'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future
[05:43.400 --> 05:47.720]  You see when you expose our false flags and fake media
[05:47.720 --> 05:54.080]  I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones
[05:54.080 --> 06:03.640]  Blaming in for mass shootings. We committed
[06:17.080 --> 06:21.480]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:21.480 --> 06:27.600]  Love from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones
[06:30.160 --> 06:32.000]  It is
[06:32.000 --> 06:37.400]  February 9th, 2020 on this live Sunday original global transmission
[06:37.400 --> 06:43.560]  I am your host Alex Jones coming to you live in defiance of the leftist bully
[06:43.560 --> 06:51.280]  Censorship mobs that have done everything in their disgusting anti-American anti-god anti-family
[06:51.960 --> 06:56.360]  Pedophile powered system to stop us, but thanks to you
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.640]  We have stood in defiance to them
[07:02.240 --> 07:07.640]  All right, let's lay it out when I'm covering today open phones second hour of the Sunday show
[07:08.640 --> 07:10.640]  then
[07:10.640 --> 07:17.120]  I'm gonna go home and see my children and then I'm gonna come back tomorrow into the 11 a.m. To 3 p.m. Broadcast
[07:17.680 --> 07:21.600]  That goes up against the poor rush limbaugh with his lung cancer
[07:21.600 --> 07:24.360]  And I gotta tell you you know trumps
[07:25.000 --> 07:29.720]  The phone before said stuff like you know, you're gonna be the next rush limbaugh
[07:29.720 --> 07:33.400]  They say and I'm like well actually I'm more popular than rush limbaugh
[07:33.560 --> 07:36.560]  But on threshold radio you can say is a lot bigger
[07:36.560 --> 07:44.200]  But I don't really fancy myself as the next rush limbaugh kind of rush limbaugh has become what I talk about a patriot nationalist
[07:44.520 --> 07:48.680]  Anti-New World Order guy 30 years ago. He wouldn't even say the CFR existed
[07:48.680 --> 07:54.040]  But I gotta tell you we will probably get a lot of stations when rush limbaugh makes the jump into hyperspace
[07:54.040 --> 07:58.960]  And I do not have a good feeling about that, but rush is pretty much said looks like he's terminal
[07:58.960 --> 08:04.840]  He might be able to stall in a while. We hope he has a miracle and I sure as hell don't like the omen of rush limbaugh
[08:04.840 --> 08:11.160]  dying right before the 2020 election because he definitely helped Trump get elected the big way and
[08:11.840 --> 08:16.360]  So it just makes me sick and I don't know why I'm going back to rush limbaugh right now
[08:16.360 --> 08:18.840]  It's just that there's so much serious news here
[08:18.840 --> 08:24.240]  And it's a bummer because rush limbaugh is a really smart guy and I like listening to him and
[08:25.040 --> 08:30.120]  Then I'm so closely interconnected to him. Yeah, I got a lot of phone calls
[08:30.120 --> 08:36.440]  From people saying yeah, I got friends and family calling me saying, oh, you know rush limbaugh. He's got
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.680]  Lung cancer. How's your and in fact crew members got calls a bunch of them did
[08:42.280 --> 08:48.560]  Including our head security guy saying hey, your boss got lung cancer. He's like really and he went and checked and wait
[08:48.560 --> 08:53.960]  You're talking about rush limbaugh. Let's see even these people are smart. They're just not paying attention
[08:54.520 --> 08:57.520]  And that's how the media goes. Oh
[08:57.520 --> 08:59.520]  President Trump
[09:00.720 --> 09:07.800]  He got he got impeached that means he's out of office and remember we went out and did man on the street and so everybody else and
[09:08.320 --> 09:16.520]  Every person you talk to almost every person. We're not cherry picking and be like, yeah, I'm glad he's out of office next week and Obama's in or Hillary's
[09:16.520 --> 09:18.920]  But yeah, yeah, Obama's taken over. Yeah, yeah
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.520]  They didn't even know what impeachment was. It's indictment in the house. We tried the Senate and found
[09:24.520 --> 09:31.520]  Not guilty acquitted but don't worry the Democrats have come out now and and unanimously they had the whole house managers on
[09:31.520 --> 09:34.520]  That was an ABC news and and and they said that
[09:36.520 --> 09:38.520]  Oh, you didn't know
[09:39.520 --> 09:45.520]  Actually made the rounds there on NBC CBS. They all said the same thing. He was not exonerated. He's not innocent
[09:46.520 --> 09:48.520]  That's right when you're found not guilty folks
[09:48.520 --> 09:50.520]  Democratic Party says you're still
[09:51.520 --> 09:53.520]  Guilty
[09:53.520 --> 09:55.520]  They aren't CNN. They were on CNN too. I mean, it's just
[09:56.520 --> 10:00.520]  Unbelievable that creatures like this
[10:02.520 --> 10:08.520]  Creatures like this still have a chance at defeating this country and literally taking control of our children's minds
[10:08.520 --> 10:12.520]  Okay, let me just what in the time I left the segment tell you what I'm gonna get you today
[10:12.520 --> 10:19.520]  First up we have the quarantine center set up at US military bases DOD reports
[10:20.520 --> 10:23.520]  That's Miami Herald. We broke this almost two weeks ago
[10:24.520 --> 10:28.520]  And I said they were establishing these and specifically where they were doing it
[10:29.520 --> 10:33.520]  And of course we got a call fake news, but we have that directly from White House sources
[10:34.520 --> 10:38.520]  Like Adams had one in Homeland Security and we can find out more about that
[10:38.520 --> 10:43.520]  For you so next week's news today. It's not hard to know that's going on. It's not like a big prediction
[10:43.520 --> 10:46.520]  It wasn't a prediction. It was a confirmation and and
[10:47.520 --> 10:51.520]  They're thinking it's gonna get quite bad and yet I'm not here to panic people
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.520]  I know why Trump doesn't want to panic people it can hurt the stock market and what does a panic do
[10:56.520 --> 11:00.520]  But to our listeners and people it's good to obviously know the truth and be prepared and kind of
[11:01.520 --> 11:04.520]  Slowly and quietly get the info out to everybody else
[11:04.520 --> 11:08.520]  Because we don't want to be caught flat-footed. That's not the business. We're in here a coronavirus
[11:09.520 --> 11:14.520]  Is this the virus that didn't cry wolf special report up on it for us calm?
[11:14.520 --> 11:17.520]  That's the question. I'm gonna post a listeners in the second hour
[11:17.520 --> 11:21.520]  What do you really think's behind it and is it the virus that cried wolf or is it the real deal?
[11:21.520 --> 11:25.520]  Well, it's certainly real. It certainly spreads easy. It's certainly manufactured certainly has killed some people
[11:25.520 --> 11:27.520]  But why the hysterical response?
[11:27.520 --> 11:30.520]  This is probably a lot worse than it is. It's probably a lot worse than it is
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.520]  That's my view is the 2019 in CoV bio weapon the black swan event destroyed globalism many people are saying so
[11:36.520 --> 11:39.520]  Excellent report by Greg Reese. We'll be covering that next segment
[11:41.520 --> 11:48.520]  Continuing coronavirus evacuees arrive at Lackland Air Force Base again. That's all coming up next segment
[11:49.520 --> 11:51.520]  Let me tell you what else
[11:52.520 --> 11:54.520]  We have that we're going to do
[11:54.520 --> 11:59.520]  This is quite interesting MSNBC's Chris Matthew suggest Bernie Sanders could assassinate political opponents of president
[12:01.520 --> 12:02.520]  Now
[12:02.520 --> 12:06.520]  Hillary has a bunch of people around her dead in incredibly suspicious circumstances
[12:06.520 --> 12:08.520]  I mean, you know Air Force Kirk
[12:08.520 --> 12:11.520]  Coroners say that Ron Brown was shot through the head
[12:11.520 --> 12:14.520]  If you read that on the air, they say it's a conspiracy
[12:14.520 --> 12:15.520]  It's a conspiracy
[12:15.520 --> 12:16.520]  It's a conspiracy
[12:16.520 --> 12:24.520]  They had a coroner in Arkansas called family mallet that would rule that people were found with their arms legs and heads cut off
[12:24.520 --> 12:30.520]  In plastic bags in a dump and they said the person committed suicide multiple times
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.520]  Who did he couldn't cut to his head arms legs off put himself in a bag and throw himself in a landfill
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.520]  It's ridiculous
[12:38.520 --> 12:40.520]  It's ridiculous
[12:40.520 --> 12:46.520]  But that's what they do but meanwhile hundreds of people have been sued by DNC lawyers
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.520]  For just questioning Seth Rich's death as a possible governmental or political hit
[12:52.520 --> 12:57.520]  FBI lying about murder of Seth Rich attorney claims
[12:58.520 --> 13:00.520]  What America News is a story about
[13:00.520 --> 13:10.520]  They talk to the lawyer, the lawyer says it goes all the way to the top Hillary Clinton. We're going to be getting to that news as well
[13:10.520 --> 13:16.520]  But you see, oh, you can say Bernie Sanders might kill people because a bunch of his staffers drool their communists
[13:16.520 --> 13:21.520]  That's what communists do. They come and kill you and take your wife and children and put them in a forced labor camp
[13:21.520 --> 13:23.520]  But but
[13:23.520 --> 13:33.520]  It's legitimate to say he might do that. I mean something true out of Chris Matthews mouth, but can we say Hillary might have had Seth Rich killed
[13:33.520 --> 13:35.520]  They certainly don't want you
[13:35.520 --> 13:38.520]  Asking that question. That's all
[13:38.520 --> 13:44.520]  Coming up also reparations in New York theater charges whites
[13:44.520 --> 13:46.520]  47% more
[13:46.520 --> 13:48.520]  And a bunch of money
[13:48.520 --> 13:53.520]  And a bunch of other restaurants are charging whites more
[13:53.520 --> 13:55.520]  It's not
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.520]  Black folks doing that though. It's weirdo white people trying to create
[13:59.520 --> 14:01.520]  Communist division and societal collapse
[14:01.520 --> 14:09.520]  And that's why they've had starbucks doing it. It's it's it's hurt their bottom line billions of dollars Gillette's lost like 15 billion I was 8 billion
[14:09.520 --> 14:12.520]  Telling men it's bad to ask a woman out
[14:12.520 --> 14:20.520]  That but but but of a convicted pedophile was to dress up and it is a drag queen to come have time with your children at public school unannounced sometimes to the parents
[14:20.520 --> 14:24.520]  That's completely normal bounce on that pedophile's knee. Just do not ask a girl out at the bar. That's right
[14:24.520 --> 14:26.520]  But sorry I digress
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.520]  But we actually found some black folks that did want to tell white people they were bad. That's coming up out of the arm
[14:31.520 --> 14:36.520]  It's up on enforce calm crazy white liberals get on their knees and get out of there
[14:36.520 --> 14:44.520]  That's coming up out of the arm. It's up on enforce calm crazy white liberals get on their knees and kiss boots of black israelite
[14:44.520 --> 14:49.520]  Man, this is funny then clap their hands
[14:49.520 --> 14:52.520]  So this is this is awesome
[14:52.520 --> 14:55.520]  This is hilarious
[14:55.520 --> 15:02.520]  I would do it too. I'd say am I am I a white devil still they're like absolutely you are the seed of the devil because you're white
[15:02.520 --> 15:07.520]  Which is all just the same thing the Nazis were saying just reversed. I mean, it's just cuckoo
[15:07.520 --> 15:09.520]  But but who's crazier
[15:09.520 --> 15:18.520]  The white people are the crazy black people and let me tell you the black israelites I've run into they are hilarious man
[15:18.520 --> 15:24.520]  Remember they were the ones bullying in the poor Catholic kids that the media said they were bullying at them
[15:24.520 --> 15:29.520]  Man, I've seen it all at this point though. I love it. So that's all coming up
[15:29.520 --> 15:32.520]  It's gonna get a lot worse though before it peaks
[15:32.520 --> 15:39.520]  So don't worry. Oh, you know, they're wanting to arrest me for talking about the Roger Stones for all they say in America
[15:39.520 --> 15:44.520]  You can't do that, you know, the Supreme Court's totally clear you can last time I checked we're not in North Korea
[15:44.520 --> 15:50.520]  I don't need to live in a trash can to know it's a trash can won't need to live in North Korea to know that's North Korea with his judge
[15:50.520 --> 15:56.520]  Well, now they're saying they may throw him in prison longer because he called for a pardon and I talked about it
[15:56.520 --> 15:59.520]  I mean, yeah, it's all coming up
[16:26.520 --> 16:37.520]  Drink fluoridated water just like the loving kiss of a king cobra pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients in their body
[16:37.520 --> 16:50.520]  Hug the cobra, love the cobra, kiss the cobra, but never, never go to info wars.com or info wars store.com
[16:50.520 --> 16:56.520]  Do not order those products. Silence, Jones, no!
[16:59.520 --> 17:03.520]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food
[17:03.520 --> 17:09.520]  But I know for a fact from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it. Get your order in two weeks for delivery
[17:09.520 --> 17:14.520]  We follow this pattern over and over again. I've been already for 25 years. I've had storeable food for a long time
[17:14.520 --> 17:20.520]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies they're fine during normal times during a crisis
[17:20.520 --> 17:23.520]  They don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory. They'll still take your orders
[17:23.520 --> 17:30.520]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot supply now the biggest most trusted company out there and I became a private labeler for them
[17:30.520 --> 17:33.520]  Because they actually have it on hand. They actually give it delivered to you on time
[17:33.520 --> 17:38.520]  They do what they're gonna say they're gonna do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people
[17:38.520 --> 17:43.520]  Now they were saying seven to ten days before shipping because they've got the food but they got a package at record level orders
[17:43.520 --> 17:48.520]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus
[17:48.520 --> 17:52.520]  So get your orders at an infowarstore.com get the best deals, get it delivered first
[17:52.520 --> 17:55.520]  They're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the info as well
[17:55.520 --> 17:59.520]  So get prepared infowarstore.com with storeable foods
[17:59.520 --> 18:03.520]  I love watching David Knight in the morning. I love tuning in to Owen Schreuer
[18:03.520 --> 18:07.520]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you
[18:07.520 --> 18:12.520]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads
[18:12.520 --> 18:15.520]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad
[18:15.520 --> 18:17.520]  But here's the bottom line
[18:17.520 --> 18:21.520]  We're barely paying the bills here and I want to expand the face the globalists not contract
[18:21.520 --> 18:25.520]  I don't want them to win. So listen, you got this guarantee from me
[18:25.520 --> 18:32.520]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs and we'll expand and really give the globalists run for their money
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.520]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2, these will change your life
[18:37.520 --> 18:41.520]  Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration
[18:41.520 --> 18:45.520]  Check it all out, whatever you do, take action and know, be part of the Second American Revolution
[18:45.520 --> 18:48.520]  Be part of Crush the Globalist and get great products at the same time
[18:48.520 --> 18:51.520]  Infowarstore.com is the umbrella site
[18:51.520 --> 18:53.520]  InfoWarsLife.com is the supplements
[18:53.520 --> 18:56.520]  Take action now and fund the info war for your own future
[19:00.520 --> 19:04.520]  I wanted to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it
[19:04.520 --> 19:09.520]  Except for maybe the last week and a half and I told Alex, I said man this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[19:09.520 --> 19:13.520]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people
[19:13.520 --> 19:21.520]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried
[19:21.520 --> 19:26.520]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.520]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this
[19:31.520 --> 19:37.520]  They feel so clean and the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this
[19:37.520 --> 19:43.520]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth
[19:43.520 --> 19:49.520]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now
[19:49.520 --> 20:10.520]  Because I like the way it feels
[20:20.520 --> 20:29.520]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[20:29.520 --> 20:35.520]  So this is the broadcast that they do not want you to hear
[20:35.520 --> 20:44.520]  We had the author of the US biological weapons conventions that was adopted into planetary rule on
[20:44.520 --> 20:50.520]  He also has the top Harvard PhD in this whole globalist system
[20:50.520 --> 20:55.520]  They only give it about one a year. He has the same one Kissinger has
[20:55.520 --> 20:59.520]  He was a mole in their system
[20:59.520 --> 21:03.520]  Francis Boyle, he did an hour and a half with us
[21:03.520 --> 21:09.520]  I went back yesterday, Bing and I watched that interview and I took notes and I checked in a lot of what he was saying
[21:09.520 --> 21:17.520]  I knew almost all of it. He was going over history, but it just blew me away
[21:17.520 --> 21:23.520]  We know this is man-made, it's admitted
[21:23.520 --> 21:27.520]  And we know it's got a high kill rate
[21:27.520 --> 21:34.520]  And he laid out the best case analysis scenario is it's a bio weapon or a vaccine they were working on for a bio weapon that got out
[21:34.520 --> 21:37.520]  And that's why people are so concerned
[21:37.520 --> 21:43.520]  The real action is this is serious. The action we're seeing by governments is this is the worst thing ever
[21:43.520 --> 21:48.520]  The PR is, oh, it's no big deal. Relax. That's the perfect storm
[21:48.520 --> 21:54.520]  And we have all these videos pouring out. Video shows officials in protective suits dragging suspected coronavirus
[21:54.520 --> 22:03.520]  Carriers from their homes, mass arrest, Miami Herald quarantine centers set up at US military bases, DOD
[22:03.520 --> 22:09.520]  Is it the virus that cried wolf? Is it the black swan event?
[22:09.520 --> 22:14.520]  More coronavirus evacuees arrive at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas
[22:14.520 --> 22:19.520]  Where they've got the level 4 bio weapons lab here in Texas
[22:19.520 --> 22:25.520]  That's just some of the things that are unfolding. All of the cremation vans running
[22:25.520 --> 22:31.520]  24-7 is China orders door-to-door mass roundups of infected citizens
[22:31.520 --> 22:37.520]  But that's an article on infowars.com for Mike Adams and naturalnews.com from three days ago
[22:37.520 --> 22:46.520]  Now that's all in mainstream news today. I'm just telling you, we're about seven to three days, three to seven days ahead of everybody else
[22:46.520 --> 22:51.520]  And we're just dead on, dead on, dead on, dead on, dead on
[22:51.520 --> 22:55.520]  And I'm not saying that to go, oh look, aren't we great?
[22:55.520 --> 23:03.520]  I'm not saying that to go, wow, why are we being censored? Why are we being blocked? Because the establishment knows all this
[23:03.520 --> 23:09.520]  But see, we've got an establishment called the American people that put a president in that's actually trying to get control again
[23:09.520 --> 23:16.520]  That means the government's going to be perfect, but it means it'll be directed for we the people, at least if it's an operating statement
[23:16.520 --> 23:23.520]  Not against the people, and America sucks, and Christianity sucks, and we're going to have a race war, and communism's the answer
[23:23.520 --> 23:28.520]  Go somewhere else where they already have tried it and failed, don't try it here with us
[23:28.520 --> 23:32.520]  But Gregory's father's powerful report, it's up on infowars.com
[23:32.520 --> 23:37.520]  I suggest you share it, it's in the Gregory's area of band.video, just click the top left hand link
[23:37.520 --> 23:42.520]  Find the Gregory's area of all his incredible reports, and please share it, because you are the resistance
[23:42.520 --> 23:47.520]  We put out the report to the research, you contribute to it, when you share it, that completes the circuit
[23:47.520 --> 23:56.520]  That's how the engine turns, that's how it roars, you are infowars. Please share this Black Swan report, here it is
[23:56.520 --> 24:03.520]  Is the new coronavirus a Black Swan event? We know that the coronavirus is man-made
[24:03.520 --> 24:08.520]  It is known as 2019-NCOV
[24:08.520 --> 24:14.520]  And while its evolution remains a mystery, we know that it did not come from eating bats
[24:14.520 --> 24:24.520]  SARS itself is already a biological warfare weapon, and then they super-dupered it, super-charged it
[24:24.520 --> 24:31.520]  Again, with DNA genetic engineering, maybe synthetic biology, to add into SARS
[24:31.520 --> 24:42.520]  HIV, as Alex correctly pointed out, that Indian study, and the flu virus, and then they gave it these gain of function activities
[24:42.520 --> 24:52.520]  We have seen videos of Chinese authorities announcing how the quarantine facilities will provide no care
[24:52.520 --> 24:58.520]  And once you are in, you can never escape
[24:58.520 --> 25:09.520]  Videos from inside the quarantine show the infected all kept together in open areas
[25:09.520 --> 25:16.520]  People are being dragged off the streets
[25:16.520 --> 25:23.520]  Locked into small boxes like stray dogs
[25:23.520 --> 25:27.520]  And everyone seems to be holding their phones out, recording it all
[25:27.520 --> 25:35.520]  In this video, Chinese police appear to wrestle a woman out of her automobile
[25:35.520 --> 25:50.520]  They force her to the ground
[25:50.520 --> 26:02.520]  And after moments of trying to restrain her, she goes limp and lifeless, as if she is dead
[26:02.520 --> 26:10.520]  Maybe unconscious? Either way, it looks terrible
[26:10.520 --> 26:17.520]  And yet the person filming it is within arms reach of the police involved, and no one ever acknowledges them
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.520]  Is it strange?
[26:21.520 --> 26:25.520]  Does the Chinese government want the world to see these images?
[26:25.520 --> 26:30.520]  Or is an all-powerful Chinese government just an illusion?
[26:30.520 --> 26:38.520]  That is falling apart before our eyes
[26:38.520 --> 26:47.520]  If 2019 NCOV is the pandemic it is feared to be, the world has already failed to shut it down
[26:47.520 --> 26:51.520]  And it won't be long until we know for sure
[26:51.520 --> 27:03.520]  Meanwhile, Philippine Senate President showed a video suggesting that BioWeapon 2019 NCOV was a product of Bill Gates and the CIA
[27:03.520 --> 27:08.520]  The corporate media attacked him as a conspiracy theorist
[27:08.520 --> 27:19.520]  And in the US, Secretary of State Pompeo made it publicly known that there is a list of US state governors who have been doing business with the communist Chinese
[27:19.520 --> 27:31.520]  Indeed, last year, a Chinese government-backed think tank in Beijing produced a report that assessed all 50 of America's governors on their attitudes towards China
[27:31.520 --> 27:38.520]  They labeled each of you friendly, hardline, or ambiguous
[27:38.520 --> 27:44.520]  I'll let you decide where you think you belong, someone in China already has
[27:44.520 --> 27:49.520]  Many of you indeed, in that report, are referenced by name
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.520]  For infowars.com, this is Greg Ries
[27:58.520 --> 28:04.520]  Very important report, it's on infowars.com, and I want to be clear if you just tuned in
[28:04.520 --> 28:15.520]  We had Dr. Francis Boyle on twice last week saying the White House needs to investigate this as a man-made BioWeapon because the Indian universities and others have scanned it, it is
[28:15.520 --> 28:24.520]  There's no doubt, it's multiple virus families, the injection points, the signature when you merge them with the gene splicing, it's there
[28:24.520 --> 28:29.520]  These things are tiny, and so when you splice something on, it's really obvious
[28:29.520 --> 28:32.520]  It's like anything in the world, it has a signature
[28:32.520 --> 28:39.520]  It is unmistakable, it's not even debatable, and the White House announced Friday night they're investigating it as a BioWeapon
[28:39.520 --> 28:48.520]  I mean, this is big stuff, folks, so I don't know how bad it's gonna get, but I can tell you right now, it's man-made
[28:48.520 --> 28:54.520]  And all hell's breaking loose in China, and folks are dying all over the world outside China, and this could be the big one
[28:54.520 --> 28:56.520]  Stay with us, we'll be back
[28:56.520 --> 29:09.520]  The demand for food has not let up, we are selling record amounts of it, everybody else is basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list
[29:09.520 --> 29:17.520]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken 7-10 days to deliver, because again, they have to package it, they're running 24 hours a day
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.520]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in
[29:22.520 --> 29:29.520]  So I wouldn't procrastinate, we wanted this virus to be peering out, we wanted it to just be hype, looks like it is really really bad
[29:29.520 --> 29:33.520]  And it is man-made, and so that's why we're seeing the huge freak out
[29:33.520 --> 29:40.520]  So get your storeable food at infowarsestore.com, that helps funder operation, it's insurance, you can eat a total 360 win

[30:01.520 --> 30:07.520]  It's Friday evening when I'm cutting this one-minute unscripted ad, I'm just telling you what's going on, straight shooting you
[30:07.520 --> 30:15.520]  We've sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented nano silver that's known to take out SARS, even Homeland Security reports, and A&M reports
[30:15.520 --> 30:20.520]  Now, we've almost sold out of the 1 ounces, we've got 3 ounces for the next week and a half at current sales rates
[30:20.520 --> 30:29.520]  This is just great to have, regardless, and it's really good for you, and it targets bacteria and viruses across the board, and it funds the M4 war

[31:01.520 --> 31:04.520]  This should really be easier than it is

[31:08.520 --> 31:17.520]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is
[31:17.520 --> 31:25.520]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us, and it's symbiotic
[31:25.520 --> 31:32.520]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen
[31:32.520 --> 31:40.520]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like 8 years ago
[31:40.520 --> 31:44.520]  It started taking true iodine, atomic iodine
[31:44.520 --> 31:53.520]  We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right now at infowarsestore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it, it's amazing

[32:05.520 --> 32:10.520]  That without you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you
[32:10.520 --> 32:18.520]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres
[32:18.520 --> 32:25.520]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing
[32:25.520 --> 32:31.520]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration
[32:31.520 --> 32:41.520]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard
[32:41.520 --> 32:51.520]  So it's not a burden to support info wars, it really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom
[32:51.520 --> 32:55.520]  And makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better
[32:55.520 --> 33:21.520]  So visit infowarstore.com today
[33:25.520 --> 33:41.520]  Music
[33:41.520 --> 33:46.520]  Yeah, AI computers didn't come up with music like that, in fact humans came up with the AI
[33:46.520 --> 33:57.520]  Yeah, no humanity's amazing, made the image of God and there's the Motor City Madman playing that guitar bringing us in
[33:57.520 --> 34:07.520]  We went out to break with some stranglehold and I said I have some more stranglehold right now
[34:07.520 --> 34:16.520]  I've read but I've asked people and I said it's true, there's a lot of military teams, regular army, it doesn't matter, anybody going into combat
[34:16.520 --> 34:23.520]  What's their favorite thing to play to get psyched up and focused and it's almost always this song
[34:23.520 --> 34:31.520]  And you can kind of get it because it's not really violent but it's full of energy and power and it's just building to help you just zen out
[34:31.520 --> 34:55.520]  Let's listen to it for just a second
[34:55.520 --> 35:01.520]  There's a ton of technology there
[35:01.520 --> 35:11.520]  Let's talk about some important things this segment, tie it all together
[35:11.520 --> 35:28.520]  When someone who is in politics dies, getting shot a couple times in the back, it's completely legitimate to speculate about why and how it happened and who could be behind it and who stands to gain
[35:28.520 --> 35:43.520]  Roman saying is Kibono who benefits and in any investigation the first thing you look at is who would benefit from this and then who has the means
[35:43.520 --> 35:51.520]  Again who has the motive, we already said who benefits and then who had the ability to carry it out
[35:51.520 --> 35:59.520]  And then who's done stuff like this before, does this person have will
[35:59.520 --> 36:10.520]  And if you talk about Seth Rich, you get sued by the DNC funded law firms
[36:10.520 --> 36:19.520]  There's over 100 lawsuits I know of
[36:19.520 --> 36:30.520]  They're scared, they don't want you looking into it but you know the data via some of these suits that actually went the other way came out
[36:30.520 --> 36:47.520]  And it's come out in federal court that the download information on the hat DNC servers because you can look on the files and see how it was downloaded
[36:47.520 --> 36:56.520]  At the time it happened was six times faster than any streaming service capability in the world
[36:56.520 --> 37:06.520]  You have the fattest fiber optic right out of the fiber optic system right into your encoder, a foot away, white speed
[37:06.520 --> 37:14.520]  And it was downloaded faster than that, it was downloaded at the port inside the DNC
[37:14.520 --> 37:24.520]  There was no Russian hack, period
[37:24.520 --> 37:32.520]  It's ballistics, just like with a bullet, a.22 long rifle goes this fast, it has these ballistics, we know what they do
[37:32.520 --> 37:40.520]  A.50 caliber rifle of this type has these ballistics
[37:40.520 --> 37:49.520]  A.556 round of this grain and this load does this and this type of.357 magnum cartridge does this
[37:49.520 --> 37:58.520]  These signatures are 100% just like with old fashioned type routers
[37:58.520 --> 38:08.520]  Every time the key slaps it does a different, like a snow drop, like a snow drop, like a snowflake
[38:08.520 --> 38:14.520]  The ADL says that's a racist term to use, it just means little individual delicate geniuses that can't be touched
[38:14.520 --> 38:18.520]  But they call it white supremacist, so even Fox News says that's a white supremacist term
[38:18.520 --> 38:20.520]  You didn't know that? Well, they said it was, so don't use it
[38:20.520 --> 38:23.520]  So it's the okay sign, so we promise not to use that as well
[38:23.520 --> 38:27.520]  Now they're saying the bro fest is, which everybody knows isn't, but it doesn't matter, I won't use it either
[38:27.520 --> 38:33.520]  I'll use only the language I'm told I can use, sorry, let me apologize again, being sarcastic here
[38:33.520 --> 38:39.520]  All that stuff I just said is true, they're at the ADL's in the Barbara Law Center, literally wants to throw college students out
[38:39.520 --> 38:42.520]  Or high school students out if they are caught doing that
[38:42.520 --> 38:47.520]  I see reports in the news all the time about students suspended for doing the bro fest
[38:47.520 --> 38:53.520]  In one case they're like, we're black dudes doing it, it's BS ladies and gentlemen
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.520]  But see, I'm digressing
[38:57.520 --> 39:00.520]  Back to Seth Rich
[39:00.520 --> 39:07.520]  It's your right when Hillary Clinton has hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people around her
[39:07.520 --> 39:10.520]  That it ended up murdered, whistleblowers you name it
[39:10.520 --> 39:13.520]  You know, Trump just wanted to name the whistleblower and face his accuser
[39:13.520 --> 39:15.520]  Well, Hillary just hasn't killed
[39:15.520 --> 39:21.520]  Now whether my statement's true or not, now obviously everybody knows Hillary's a killing, murdering, evil witch
[39:21.520 --> 39:24.520]  I have a right to say it, she's a public figure
[39:24.520 --> 39:29.520]  She's been the secretary of state, she's been co-president, multiple presidencies
[39:29.520 --> 39:32.520]  Eight years with her husband, eight years with Obama
[39:32.520 --> 39:40.520]  I have a right to say that I think she's the living incarnation of Medusa if I want to, which I do
[39:45.520 --> 39:50.520]  But look at Chris Matthews, he comes out because the Democrats are all after Bernie Sanders
[39:50.520 --> 39:58.520]  Because he's not an insider, he's a communist and establishment system within that whole paradigm
[39:58.520 --> 40:02.520]  But not who they want
[40:02.520 --> 40:07.520]  And so he comes out and says, Bernie Sanders could assassinate his political opponents
[40:07.520 --> 40:14.520]  Because he supported people like Hugo Chavez and Fidel Castro and Cruz Cheff and Brezhnev and people to do
[40:14.520 --> 40:16.520]  That's actually a true statement out of him
[40:16.520 --> 40:22.520]  That's all of the, we'll play a clip in a moment, that's all of the project Veritas revelations
[40:22.520 --> 40:30.520]  What's up to like seven or eight staffers in separate states, saying we're going to put all the conservatives in death camps
[40:30.520 --> 40:36.520]  That's who communists are, Sanders is incredibly dangerous
[40:36.520 --> 40:39.520]  But he isn't the leftist establishment so they don't want him
[40:39.520 --> 40:43.520]  But it shows you the Democrats have turned into what the universities are
[40:43.520 --> 40:49.520]  And the Chai Khan funding of those universities that Pompeo rightly talked about
[40:49.520 --> 40:57.520]  And it shows how poison, how poisonous they've become and really who they are
[40:57.520 --> 41:04.520]  But if he can say Sanders might kill people, why can't we say Hillary doesn't see how it works
[41:04.520 --> 41:07.520]  So we're going to play that report and then get to the Seth Rich report
[41:07.520 --> 41:12.520]  But here's just a brief snippet of what slime ball Chris Matthews had to say
[41:12.520 --> 41:15.520]  The issue of this campaign, it is that word socialism
[41:15.520 --> 41:20.520]  Some people like it, younger people like it, those of us like me who grew up in a cold war
[41:20.520 --> 41:24.520]  And saw some aspects of it, if they're visiting places like Vietnam like I have
[41:24.520 --> 41:29.520]  And seeing countries like Cuba being there, I've seen what socialism is like, I don't like it
[41:29.520 --> 41:33.520]  Okay, it's not only not free, it doesn't freaking work
[41:33.520 --> 41:37.520]  Okay, wow, so see Chris Matthews is a mercenary
[41:37.520 --> 41:41.520]  The real Chris Matthews doesn't hate America
[41:41.520 --> 41:46.520]  I don't think the real Chris Matthews just goes along with what he's ordered to do
[41:46.520 --> 41:51.520]  And so I'm going to ask Chris Matthews this, how did you get into a freakish position
[41:51.520 --> 41:57.520]  Where your own party, something like 75% in big polls, you've seen them
[41:57.520 --> 42:02.520]  Of Democrats want socialism or communism, half of millennials in national polls
[42:02.520 --> 42:05.520]  A bunch of them want to be communists
[42:05.520 --> 42:13.520]  And you're like, it doesn't freaking work
[42:13.520 --> 42:19.520]  It's a cult of powerful people that can get control, it's a new royalty
[42:19.520 --> 42:23.520]  So when we come back though, I'll hit the Seth Rich thing and then I'm going to get into the white people
[42:23.520 --> 42:28.520]  Kissing black boots in leftist gesticulation
[42:28.520 --> 42:34.520]  This is not, that's prostration, it's prostration to be the right term
[42:34.520 --> 42:41.520]  This is not, what would you call it, parody?
[42:41.520 --> 42:45.520]  It's not satire, this is real video
[42:45.520 --> 42:49.520]  When we come back and then we'll hit all the other news and move very quickly
[42:49.520 --> 42:54.520]  There is a lot to cover, plus Virginia Democrats vote to advance semi-automatic gun ban
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.520]  Eject citizens from rooms saying no free speech as well, oh really
[42:59.520 --> 43:04.520]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me
[43:04.520 --> 43:09.520]  You don't want my thanks, you want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters
[43:09.520 --> 43:12.520]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back
[43:12.520 --> 43:16.520]  And you know what, I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team
[43:16.520 --> 43:21.520]  And it's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time
[43:21.520 --> 43:25.520]  To focus the people on taking action against the globalist
[43:25.520 --> 43:30.520]  Because I'm committed to a future for humanity and I know you are as well
[43:30.520 --> 43:34.520]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War
[43:34.520 --> 43:38.520]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.520]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family and for the great crew at Info Wars
[43:42.520 --> 43:45.520]  I want to thank you all because you are the Info War
[43:45.520 --> 43:48.520]  And you know that's not just words, that's reality
[43:48.520 --> 43:51.520]  You have made history, we have made history together
[43:51.520 --> 43:56.520]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you

[44:33.520 --> 44:37.520]  And then Vitamin D3 with Vitamin K that fuses it together
[44:37.520 --> 44:41.520]  Super high quality, winter sun, you don't have sun during the winter
[44:41.520 --> 44:44.520]  Sun helps your body produce the Vitamin D3
[44:44.520 --> 44:47.520]  That's why people get so sick, that's the main reason
[44:47.520 --> 44:50.520]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption, it's amazing
[44:50.520 --> 44:55.520]  All three of these are on sale but only for a limited time at InfoWars.com
[44:55.520 --> 44:58.520]  Protect yourself and fund the Info War, 360 win
[45:25.520 --> 45:28.520]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[45:28.520 --> 45:31.520]  And they do what they do because they're slaves
[45:31.520 --> 45:36.520]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent
[45:36.520 --> 45:41.520]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves
[45:41.520 --> 45:46.520]  But the sheet dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants
[45:46.520 --> 45:49.520]  They fear the fact that we are awake
[45:49.520 --> 45:52.520]  They fear the fact that we are alive
[45:52.520 --> 45:55.520]  They fear the fact that we love God
[45:55.520 --> 45:59.520]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge
[45:59.520 --> 46:03.520]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food
[46:03.520 --> 46:07.520]  But I know for a fact from sources to tell them people, oh we've got it, get your order in
[46:07.520 --> 46:11.520]  Two weeks for delivery, we follow this pattern over and over again
[46:11.520 --> 46:14.520]  I've been already for 25 years, I've had storeable food for a long time
[46:14.520 --> 46:18.520]  And I learned very quickly, a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.520]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory
[46:22.520 --> 46:23.520]  They'll still take your orders
[46:23.520 --> 46:26.520]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot supply
[46:26.520 --> 46:30.520]  Now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them
[46:30.520 --> 46:33.520]  Because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time
[46:33.520 --> 46:35.520]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do
[46:35.520 --> 46:38.520]  Because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people
[46:38.520 --> 46:41.520]  Now they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food
[46:41.520 --> 46:43.520]  But they've got to package it, record level orders
[46:43.520 --> 46:48.520]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus
[46:48.520 --> 46:52.520]  So get your orders at infowarstore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first
[46:52.520 --> 46:55.520]  They're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the M4 as well
[46:55.520 --> 46:58.520]  So get prepared at infowarstore.com with storeable foods
[46:58.520 --> 47:02.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:12.520 --> 47:16.520]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones
[47:16.520 --> 47:20.520]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the infowar
[47:23.520 --> 47:27.520]  I want to talk about victoryology, a term I coined
[47:27.520 --> 47:31.520]  I even looked it up the other day, I said, no one's really coined this?
[47:31.520 --> 47:33.520]  No, they haven't
[47:33.520 --> 47:38.520]  The study and science of total human empowerment and expansion
[47:38.520 --> 47:41.520]  We're going to get to that special report that just premiered
[47:41.520 --> 47:46.520]  Posted infowarstore.com about an hour ago, we're going to premiere it on radio and TV
[47:46.520 --> 47:48.520]  Here in just a moment
[47:48.520 --> 47:51.520]  And then I also want to open the phones up
[47:51.520 --> 47:58.520]  Specifically on coronavirus and the US military admitted they've opened up all these emergency quarantine centers
[47:58.520 --> 48:03.520]  Particularly on the west coast, but also in San Antonio, Texas and other areas
[48:03.520 --> 48:08.520]  And just what we see in China clearly way more deaths than they're saying
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.520]  It's admittedly man-made, the White House opens up an investigation looking at it as man-made
[48:13.520 --> 48:17.520]  I want to take your call specifically on the coronavirus
[48:17.520 --> 48:23.520]  First-time callers, long-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree
[48:23.520 --> 48:34.520]  Everybody, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789 Alex
[48:34.520 --> 48:40.520]  And I want to talk to you, international line 512-646-1776
[48:40.520 --> 48:45.520]  To stall the US country code access number 512-646-1776
[48:45.520 --> 48:48.520]  Some people can't call a 100 number from overseas
[48:48.520 --> 48:51.520]  Okay, let me finish up because I spent too much time on the Seth Rich thing
[48:51.520 --> 48:58.520]  It's just crazy to say you can't question somebody in an unsolved murder shot in the back in DC
[48:58.520 --> 49:04.520]  Who's been fingered as a person that might have leaked the information and then was killed for it
[49:04.520 --> 49:14.520]  So here is a clip of a prominent lawyer who was on one American
[49:14.520 --> 49:19.520]  News network breaking all of this down
[49:19.520 --> 49:26.520]  FBI lying about murder of Seth Rich, attorney claims, one American news
[49:26.520 --> 49:31.520]  And you have to remember a lot of folks investigating this have been shot in the back
[49:31.520 --> 49:36.520]  Not just Mr. Rich, but people investigating it have been killed
[49:36.520 --> 49:37.520]  Others have been shot
[49:37.520 --> 49:44.520]  I mean, this thing reads like a broken dagger novel, here it is
[49:44.520 --> 49:53.520]  There has been an ongoing litigation slash smear campaign against anybody who asks inconvenient questions about Seth Rich
[49:53.520 --> 49:58.520]  Fox News got sued, Fox News has gone completely silent on Seth Rich
[49:58.520 --> 50:02.520]  And I think the message has gotten out to most other media outlets
[50:02.520 --> 50:04.520]  Don't talk about this or else
[50:04.520 --> 50:07.520]  And I think that was their strategy all along is to shut everybody up
[50:07.520 --> 50:09.520]  And here's where it gets really interesting
[50:09.520 --> 50:15.520]  So when I notified the attorney representing the FBI, we had these emails
[50:15.520 --> 50:23.520]  The FBI came back and said, well the reason they weren't produced was because there was nothing of investigative significance
[50:23.520 --> 50:26.520]  Of course I pointed out, I didn't ask for emails of investigative significance
[50:26.520 --> 50:28.520]  I asked for all emails about Seth Rich
[50:28.520 --> 50:31.520]  So we went back and forth with that
[50:31.520 --> 50:36.520]  And then I happened to look at the, there's a little, every time there's a FOIA redaction
[50:36.520 --> 50:38.520]  They put codes next to the redaction
[50:38.520 --> 50:40.520]  So I went back and looked up the codes
[50:40.520 --> 50:47.520]  And one of the most common codes in there was to redact things that might reveal matters of investigative or prosecutorial significance
[50:47.520 --> 50:50.520]  So mind you, they told me along, there's been no investigation
[50:50.520 --> 50:57.520]  But yet you're citing exemptions on the grounds that there's an investigation or potential prosecution
[50:57.520 --> 50:58.520]  So which is it?
[50:58.520 --> 51:02.520]  What led you to believe that they knew all along, that they didn't conduct a reasonable search?
[51:02.520 --> 51:08.520]  Well, just the fact that they admitted to me that there were inquiries in the Washington field office
[51:08.520 --> 51:09.520]  Questions were asked
[51:09.520 --> 51:14.520]  And then I'm getting tips from people on the inside that absolutely there are records there
[51:14.520 --> 51:18.520]  So I think they've known all along and they just try to cover it up
[51:18.520 --> 51:22.520]  So how far up do we believe this line of corruption actually goes?
[51:22.520 --> 51:30.520]  If you look at the whole Russia collusion, Ukraine, whatever, they go straight to Obama
[51:30.520 --> 51:38.520]  Hillary is deeply involved, Obama himself is involved, James Comey, Clapper, Brennan, all of them are involved
[51:38.520 --> 51:44.520]  So that's Ty Clevenger, a lawyer, we're going to get him on the show, powerful information
[51:44.520 --> 51:50.520]  And the fact that people are going to be scared to even ask questions, that's unamerica and that's dangerous
[51:50.520 --> 51:54.520]  And that's why we're not looking for trouble here, we're looking for lawsuits
[51:54.520 --> 52:01.520]  But we're going to tell the truth, we're going to do the research, we're going to come out and say what we think is the most accurate information at the time
[52:01.520 --> 52:06.520]  And not just receive talking points from the globalists and their handlers
[52:06.520 --> 52:09.520]  We're not going to do that, ladies and gentlemen, you've got my commitment
[52:09.520 --> 52:12.520]  All right, we're going to go to a special report here and then start the next hour
[52:12.520 --> 52:18.520]  I see your calls pouring in at 877-789-2539 on this live Sunday edition
[52:18.520 --> 52:22.520]  Please don't forget, don't be a victim
[52:22.520 --> 52:28.520]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard, because that can lower your immune system
[52:28.520 --> 52:36.520]  White to medium, drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration
[52:36.520 --> 52:40.520]  Pray, prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier
[52:40.520 --> 52:44.520]  Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is in fish oil
[52:44.520 --> 52:50.520]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it, that's what allows you to be healthier
[52:50.520 --> 52:52.520]  And get plenty of sleep
[52:52.520 --> 53:00.520]  We have sold out of a 16-ounce immune gargle that has the nano-silver that Pat did and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown
[53:00.520 --> 53:05.520]  To go after this whole Corona SARS family of viruses, viruses and bacteria, period
[53:05.520 --> 53:09.520]  We're almost sold out of the 1-ounce spray bottles
[53:09.520 --> 53:16.520]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're at about a week and a half or so of the super silver 3-ounce bottles at infowarstore.com
[53:16.520 --> 53:21.520]  Great to have, period, really good for your gums, really great for your teeth, and it funds the info war
[53:21.520 --> 53:29.520]  So get your immune gargle with the nano-silver, we also have the super silver in our high-quality whitening toothpaste
[53:29.520 --> 53:34.520]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[53:34.520 --> 53:39.520]  That's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff and there's a lot of patriots
[53:39.520 --> 53:45.520]  There's not just bad guys coming after us, there's the flip side of all the good guys and good gals, it's very exciting
[53:45.520 --> 53:48.520]  Here's the special report on victory
[53:48.520 --> 53:55.520]  There are those that live their lives in victimology, and that's a word that's in the encyclopedia we all know
[53:55.520 --> 54:00.520]  Instead of a new word, I'm about to coin into the realm and introduce today
[54:00.520 --> 54:04.520]  That could change the whole future of human destiny if it's adopted
[54:04.520 --> 54:10.520]  And we've put a lot of key coins out in the mind war, in the soul war, and the destiny war
[54:10.520 --> 54:14.520]  And that's victoryology
[54:18.520 --> 54:21.520]  So many people I know, so many people I love
[54:21.520 --> 54:25.520]  Define themselves by the attacks they're under
[54:25.520 --> 54:31.520]  And define themselves by how they're victims and oh look at me, I'm a baby bird
[54:31.520 --> 54:34.520]  Come to the nest and vomit in my mouth
[54:34.520 --> 54:38.520]  They never want to leave the nest and the millennials don't own anything
[54:38.520 --> 54:41.520]  They don't want to own anything, they want communism
[54:41.520 --> 54:44.520]  They don't even know that communism will work like slaves 18 hours a day
[54:44.520 --> 54:49.520]  But they don't care because they're babies and we never pushed them out of the nest
[54:49.520 --> 54:53.520]  And I have people that are close to me that I love
[54:53.520 --> 55:01.520]  Who I just can't get out of the victimology because that's the paradigm inflicted on them
[55:01.520 --> 55:05.520]  So I am pointing the term victoryology
[55:07.520 --> 55:13.520]  Instead of being a victim, be a victor
[55:13.520 --> 55:17.520]  And to be a victor, you have to decide
[55:17.520 --> 55:21.520]  If somebody punches you in the face, that don't feel too bad
[55:21.520 --> 55:25.520]  You gotta stop caring when things are hard because that's what makes you stronger
[55:25.520 --> 55:27.520]  Instead of weaker
[55:27.520 --> 55:33.520]  Because it's that mental capacity to stop giving in to fear that activates the genes
[55:33.520 --> 55:40.520]  That activates everything there is in your soul and your future and your destiny
[55:40.520 --> 55:45.520]  Humans aren't born out of laying around on their asses
[55:45.520 --> 55:53.520]  We've been born out of conquering a world with lions and tigers and bears and mastodons
[55:53.520 --> 55:56.520]  And hyenas attacking us
[55:56.520 --> 56:04.520]  And hordes of other humans and giant wars and freezing atmospheres and giant volcanoes
[56:04.520 --> 56:09.520]  And huddling together in the cold night for warmth to survive
[56:09.520 --> 56:12.520]  We're the dominant species, we built all this
[56:12.520 --> 56:15.520]  We're powerful and we're beautiful
[56:15.520 --> 56:19.520]  And we're ready to build the next level of civilization in God's plan
[56:19.520 --> 56:24.520]  But you must stop belling to those who want to make you a victim
[56:24.520 --> 56:29.520]  You must become the victor that you were born to be
[56:29.520 --> 56:33.520]  And not a victor over other weaker people
[56:33.520 --> 56:39.520]  But a victor in promoting ideas so powerful and so beautiful
[56:39.520 --> 56:42.520]  That despite the fact they're suppressed
[56:42.520 --> 56:45.520]  It doesn't matter if they're coming from Jimi Hendrix
[56:45.520 --> 56:48.520]  It doesn't matter if they're coming from Donald Trump
[56:48.520 --> 56:52.520]  It doesn't matter if it's coming from you, a black man or a white woman
[56:52.520 --> 56:55.520]  Or a young Hispanic person or somebody from China
[56:55.520 --> 56:59.520]  If you love God and you love justice and you love freedom
[56:59.520 --> 57:01.520]  And you want to build a pro-human future
[57:01.520 --> 57:05.520]  Then you are an enemy of the New World Order and Satanism
[57:05.520 --> 57:11.520]  You are an info warrior commited devil worship and the system
[57:11.520 --> 57:15.520]  And serving the corrupt technocracy will not animate you like this
[57:15.520 --> 57:18.520]  They want us shut down because we have the spirit
[57:18.520 --> 57:22.520]  I am jacked into the source, I know the secret
[57:22.520 --> 57:24.520]  And I want to see you empowered
[57:24.520 --> 57:27.520]  But you have to believe in yourself first
[57:27.520 --> 57:29.520]  And you have to turn against the globalist
[57:29.520 --> 57:32.520]  And make that decision with God to open your heart to the truth
[57:32.520 --> 57:37.520]  And then the spirit of justice known as the Holy Spirit will flow into you
[57:37.520 --> 57:42.520]  And the beginning of a new system in your personal spiritual destiny
[57:42.520 --> 57:44.520]  With eternity will begin
[57:44.520 --> 58:06.520]  This is the truth and everyone knows it
[58:14.520 --> 58:34.520]  This is the truth and everyone knows it
[58:34.520 --> 58:43.520]  This is the truth and everyone knows it
[58:43.520 --> 58:45.520]  I can't miss formula

[59:41.520 --> 59:44.520]  Do not order those products
[59:44.520 --> 59:59.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:59.520 --> 1:00:03.520]  From the front lines of the information war
[1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:07.520]  It's Alex Jones
[1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:14.520]  There are 7.5 billion people on this planet if you believe the numbers were told
[1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:17.520]  And those are pretty accurate
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:22.520]  So when I hear about somebody dying
[1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:25.520]  I mean I have empathy
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:26.520]  I'm connected to them
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:27.520]  I know the universe works
[1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:29.520]  It's bad mojo to not care
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:31.520]  I already know that instinctively
[1:00:31.520 --> 1:00:32.520]  I don't need to go like
[1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:35.520]  Oh it's bad luck if I don't care if somebody gets hurt
[1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:39.520]  I already spiritually know that
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:41.520]  But if I was a sociopath
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:43.520]  You'd think I'd know that
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:47.520]  But they like don't
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:50.520]  Because they don't get the laws of nature
[1:00:50.520 --> 1:00:52.520]  And that's why evil always goes
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:54.520]  Wow I can do this
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  And this happens
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:02.520]  But they don't think about the next couple of things that happen
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:07.520]  So being nice is the best way to build a good civilization
[1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:10.520]  And have good people around you that are doing well
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:12.520]  I mean if people aren't doing well
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:15.520]  I don't care what color they are or where they came from
[1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:17.520]  How does that make me better?
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:18.520]  It doesn't
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:21.520]  But I then because I have a spirit
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:22.520]  And I have a conscience
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:23.520]  And I care
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:27.520]  I have nerves
[1:01:27.520 --> 1:01:28.520]  I have feelings
[1:01:28.520 --> 1:01:29.520]  I'm not a psychopath
[1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:35.520]  I'm a sociopath
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:40.520]  I can't let people manipulate my feelings cold bloodedly
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.520]  And that's where this comes in
[1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:44.520]  People that are good and strong
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:47.520]  Have to do the right thing when it comes down to it
[1:01:47.520 --> 1:01:48.520]  Even though we don't
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:49.520]  Let me tell you something
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:51.520]  When I fry some enemy and defeat them
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:52.520]  I don't even feel good
[1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:58.520]  I'm like I can't believe I've spent time on that person man
[1:01:58.520 --> 1:02:01.520]  And I feel bad that they
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:03.520]  Like when I see how bad they are
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:04.520]  And how weak they are
[1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:05.520]  And how bad their family is
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:09.520]  I'm not like
[1:02:09.520 --> 1:02:12.520]  Like a lot of people I know go around poor people
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:13.520]  They can be poor black people
[1:02:13.520 --> 1:02:14.520]  Poor white people
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:15.520]  Poor whatever
[1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:16.520]  And they like Philoletus
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:18.520]  Man you see those poor dumbass people
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:20.520]  Man we're not like them
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:21.520]  And I'm like really you feel good
[1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:25.520]  Because they're doing bad
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:26.520]  Worst job I ever had
[1:02:26.520 --> 1:02:28.520]  I was like what's the highest job I can get
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.520]  Was a carpet cleaner
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:31.520]  A Stanley Steamer carpet cleaner
[1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:34.520]  Like 30 years ago
[1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:38.520]  Right out of high school
[1:02:38.520 --> 1:02:39.520]  Longer than that now
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:44.520]  I'm getting old I'm 46
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:45.520]  And I remember like
[1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:47.520]  I get paid 20 something dollars an hour
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:49.520]  As the assistant
[1:02:49.520 --> 1:02:51.520]  To clean carpets
[1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:53.520]  And my other job is like 9 dollars an hour
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:55.520]  Yeah I'll take this right now
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:59.520]  Until I got to people's houses
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:02.520]  And I was like
[1:03:02.520 --> 1:03:03.520]  Again they can be white
[1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:04.520]  They can be black
[1:03:04.520 --> 1:03:05.520]  They can be whatever
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:06.520]  They're mainly white people
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:07.520]  But I was like
[1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:13.520]  I've never seen anything like this
[1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:15.520]  And to try to describe what I saw
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:19.520]  In the few months I worked there
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:20.520]  Would take hours
[1:03:20.520 --> 1:03:24.520]  It was hellish
[1:03:24.520 --> 1:03:27.520]  No the Bible is true
[1:03:27.520 --> 1:03:29.520]  Humanity is falling man
[1:03:29.520 --> 1:03:30.520]  I've talked to paramedics
[1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:32.520]  And stuff they see
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:33.520]  You talk about PTSD
[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:34.520]  I mean I might take away from
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:35.520]  Military people and stuff
[1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:37.520]  But when we take medics and people
[1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:38.520]  That's the real heroes
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:40.520]  I mean they're in wars
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:42.520]  And all they're doing is taking care of people
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.520]  That actually got their arms and legs blown off
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:46.520]  And nobody in the military will deny
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:47.520]  Those are the real heroes
[1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:50.520]  But think about paramedics
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:52.520]  Or even police that have got to show up
[1:03:52.520 --> 1:03:54.520]  And see these chewed up bodies
[1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:56.520]  Or you drive by a wreck
[1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:58.520]  You don't know the firefighters
[1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:04.520]  And police are there with dead kids and stuff
[1:04:04.520 --> 1:04:06.520]  Imagine being the first cop to pull up after a wreck
[1:04:06.520 --> 1:04:08.520]  There's a three year old with blood spurting out
[1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:09.520]  Begging for mommy
[1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:10.520]  You're trying to save them
[1:04:10.520 --> 1:04:11.520]  And you can't
[1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:14.520]  And little baby dies right
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:15.520]  And like it doesn't even matter
[1:04:15.520 --> 1:04:17.520]  You knew well that's not my fault
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:18.520]  I got there
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:19.520]  I tried to hold it around their neck
[1:04:19.520 --> 1:04:23.520]  I tried to put a little baby
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:26.520]  It's a psychic wound
[1:04:26.520 --> 1:04:27.520]  And then there's everybody else
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:30.520]  Who just wants to go home and watch Netflix
[1:04:30.520 --> 1:04:33.520]  And you know here's some stuff from Jeff Bezos
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:35.520]  Some Black Lives Matter
[1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:36.520]  Let's kill the cops
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:37.520]  And you're just like
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:39.520]  It doesn't even fit
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:41.520]  And you got these billionaires
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:42.520]  Sitting up there
[1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:44.520]  Funding Bernie Sanders by the way
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:47.520]  Telling you all day about how much
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.520]  Some dude making $100,000 sucks
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.520]  These are sick freaks man
[1:04:51.520 --> 1:05:20.520]  The Sick Freaks
[1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:22.520]  Wow, yes now we know we're right
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:23.520]  The new world order is real
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:24.520]  Satanism is real
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.520]  The pedophile a leader real
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:27.520]  But we're real as well
[1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:28.520]  And we love God
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:29.520]  And we're standing up and saying no
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:31.520]  But I just want to make the point here
[1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:32.520]  One month into 2020
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:34.520]  That we have never been in Kansas
[1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:36.520]  We have never been in some small
[1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:38.520]  Ville place that didn't matter
[1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:39.520]  Everything we do
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:40.520]  Every decision we make
[1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:42.520]  Governs the future of our species
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:44.520]  And everything we've gone through
[1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:45.520]  And everything we're going to go through
[1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:46.520]  So it's an incredible town to be alive
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:48.520]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware
[1:05:48.520 --> 1:05:49.520]  And being involved
[1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:50.520]  But just remember
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:51.520]  Your action now
[1:05:51.520 --> 1:05:53.520]  Via prayer, word of mouth
[1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:54.520]  And financial support
[1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:55.520]  At www.Membershore.com
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:05:56.520]  Is critical
[1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:58.520]  So please take action
[1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:18.520]  Music
[1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:20.520]  So we're not drama queens
[1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:22.520]  We're not drama queens
[1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:26.520]  Music
[1:06:26.520 --> 1:06:28.520]  But could you imagine
[1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:29.520]  When two years ago
[1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:31.520]  You saw Charlottesville where
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:34.520]  A crowd attacks a car
[1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:35.520]  A guy drives
[1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:36.520]  Hits a lumb and she has a heart attack
[1:06:36.520 --> 1:06:37.520]  Guys
[1:06:37.520 --> 1:06:38.520]  It's like Trump's a murderer
[1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:40.520]  The KKK's taking over
[1:06:41.520 --> 1:06:43.520]  Destroy America
[1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:46.520]  It's the most powerful thing ever seen
[1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:48.520]  It's all over
[1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:52.520]  Right where the hell's
[1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:54.520]  Music
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:55.520]  But then
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:57.520]  Do you hear about all the attacks
[1:06:57.520 --> 1:06:58.520]  On Trump supporters?
[1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:00.520]  That means America supporters
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:02.520]  People that stand up against bullying
[1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:04.520]  People that believe in self-defense
[1:07:04.520 --> 1:07:05.520]  People that believe in life
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:06.520]  So many reasons
[1:07:06.520 --> 1:07:08.520]  The people that won't back down
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:09.520]  Under intimidation
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:10.520]  The folks God's looking for
[1:07:10.520 --> 1:07:11.520]  I'll just tell you
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:13.520]  Trump's just a tester
[1:07:15.520 --> 1:07:17.520]  Big story up on M4s.com
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:19.520]  Trump supporters attacked
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:21.520]  After van plows through GOP
[1:07:21.520 --> 1:07:23.520]  Voter registration in Florida
[1:07:23.520 --> 1:07:25.520]  Suspect arrested
[1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:26.520]  And you see the reports
[1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:28.520]  Every couple of hours like
[1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:32.520]  Anti-Trump beats head and boss
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:35.520]  Beats boss to death and head with hammer
[1:07:41.520 --> 1:07:43.520]  And you just see the reports
[1:07:43.520 --> 1:07:44.520]  Pouring out
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:46.520]  And the media says
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:47.520]  Hey, they deserve it
[1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:49.520]  It was like CNN
[1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:50.520]  When I watched Wolf Blitzer
[1:07:50.520 --> 1:07:51.520]  A few years ago
[1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:53.520]  When Congressman Scalise had been shot
[1:07:54.520 --> 1:07:55.520]  They had a guest on saying
[1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:56.520]  He's a hero
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:57.520]  He's not a bad guy
[1:07:57.520 --> 1:07:59.520]  He saw fascism and fought it
[1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:00.520]  And Wolf Blitzer said
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:01.520]  You're right
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:04.520]  Hoping more people
[1:08:04.520 --> 1:08:05.520]  Would come kill
[1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:07.520]  Trump supporting members of Congress
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:08.520]  Hey Wolf
[1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:10.520]  If you're ever successful
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  Starting a civil war in America, buddy
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:15.520]  It's open season on your little ass
[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:19.520]  I don't want to ever see Wolf Blitzer hurt
[1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:22.520]  Because Wolf Blitzer is a human maggot
[1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:24.520]  I mean
[1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:27.520]  Like you really want to start a fight with us
[1:08:28.520 --> 1:08:29.520]  He just can't help it
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:31.520]  Yeah, you do, don't you?
[1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:33.520]  You're begging for it
[1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:34.520]  You're begging
[1:08:34.520 --> 1:08:37.520]  You're begging to get your guts stomped out hard
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:41.520]  And I don't know Wolf if you ever had your guts stomped out
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:43.520]  But you don't live after that happens
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:45.520]  So you
[1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:48.520]  Not that I've ever stomped anybody's guts out
[1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:49.520]  Actually I have a couple times
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:50.520]  It's not too nice
[1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:52.520]  Takes people a long time to die
[1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:54.520]  After you've stomped their guts out
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:55.520]  But
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:08:57.520]  That's no threat to Wolf Blitzer
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:08:59.520]  I'm just simply saying
[1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:01.520]  That
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:04.520]  You guys are a joke
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:06.520]  And everybody knows it
[1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:08.520]  And
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:12.520]  You continue to evoke civil war and violence
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:13.520]  And I assure you
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:14.520]  Every
[1:09:14.520 --> 1:09:15.520]  Skexy
[1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:16.520]  Chicken neck
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.520]  From Anderson Cooper
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:19.520]  To
[1:09:22.520 --> 1:09:25.520]  Robert Maddow on MSNBC
[1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.520]  To
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:31.520]  The very last one of you
[1:09:31.520 --> 1:09:34.520]  Just keeps looking for trouble
[1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:38.520]  You keep pushing and poking and prodding
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:40.520]  And looking for that magic moment
[1:09:40.520 --> 1:09:41.520]  Where you can false flag something
[1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:43.520]  It's never coming
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:44.520]  It's never going to happen
[1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:47.520]  Humanity has moved on and turned against you
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:50.520]  And I'm not making some statement to make you give up
[1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:51.520]  As some
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:52.520]  Hanoi
[1:09:52.520 --> 1:09:53.520]  Joy
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:55.520]  Tokyo
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:56.520]  Rose
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:57.520]  Pronouncement
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:09:58.520]  That's who you are
[1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:00.520]  I only say it if it's true
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:03.520]  And I just say you're worthless crap
[1:10:03.520 --> 1:10:04.520]  You're garbage
[1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:06.520]  And you know that
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:12.520]  And so your whole universal view is dominating those that are better than you
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.520]  So you can't even
[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:17.520]  Live in a world
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:20.520]  Where you can't be pissing down the back of the American people
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:30.520]  And that's just what this comes down to
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:31.520]  I mean
[1:10:31.520 --> 1:10:33.520]  I know CNN's a joke
[1:10:33.520 --> 1:10:35.520]  But they pay to be in every
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:36.520]  Bar
[1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:37.520]  Hotel
[1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:40.520]  Airport
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:47.520]  Train station
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:48.520]  Think about that
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:49.520]  This is
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:50.520]  This is what
[1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:54.520]  Tries to make you look at it
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:56.520]  You can run, you can hide
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:58.520]  You will look at me
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:00.520]  I'm Anderson Cooper
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:03.520]  The son of a robber baron aristocracy
[1:11:03.520 --> 1:11:06.520]  You're going to look at me
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:09.520]  Whether you like it or not
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:13.520]  You're going to bow to me
[1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:15.520]  Whether you like it or not
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:19.520]  I'm going to be your God
[1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:21.520]  Because if you don't think about God's
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:23.520]  And if you forget about God's
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:24.520]  They're not God's anymore
[1:11:24.520 --> 1:11:25.520]  But Anderson
[1:11:25.520 --> 1:11:27.520]  Anderson
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:32.520]  Just because you're the last
[1:11:32.520 --> 1:11:34.520]  Vanderbilt on the planet
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:36.520]  Your brother got thrown out of that window
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:39.520]  By somebody that wanted, you know, the investments
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:42.520]  Because your brother wouldn't bend over
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:50.520]  You're not going to gang rape America
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:52.520]  Anderson
[1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:54.520]  You have that skexie thing
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.520]  That do put together of Anderson
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:58.520]  And I've got your calls coming up next segment
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:01.520]  It's just that
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:03.520]  Imagine if
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  This admitting
[1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:08.520]  An
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:09.520]  Anti
[1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:13.520]  Trumper runs over six people
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:17.520]  In Florida
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:21.520]  Because they're out registering voters for Trump
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:24.520]  And there's almost no coverage of it
[1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:28.520]  Imagine if a Trump supporter ran over six people
[1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:31.520]  It would be every news channel
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:33.520]  It would be every headline
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:35.520]  It would be force fed down your throats
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:36.520]  But see
[1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:39.520]  It doesn't ever exist
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:42.520]  Because it doesn't exist
[1:12:44.520 --> 1:12:46.520]  Because producing hardworking people
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.520]  Don't think about killing somebody
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:51.520]  Because of their political views
[1:12:51.520 --> 1:12:54.520]  We think about how we're going to politically motivate others
[1:12:54.520 --> 1:12:56.520]  To say no to that idea
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:00.520]  It's you, the communist, and the socialist
[1:13:00.520 --> 1:13:02.520]  And the Bernie Sanders of the world
[1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:04.520]  That dream of physical power
[1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:09.520]  Because if you are an ugly, cockeyed, weirdo
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:12.520]  Like Bernie Sanders, of course he sits around
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:16.520]  Dreaming of how they're going to put people in death camps
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:19.520]  And all the women Bernie can go and pick out
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:22.520]  And all the swindling and the robbing
[1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:25.520]  And how everything will be his
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:27.520]  It's just sick
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:32.520]  But they'll never, ever succeed in America
[1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:36.520]  Because this is the place that's about not being part of that
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:37.520]  The problem is
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:42.520]  America was the
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:46.520]  Fruit of the greatest expression of the Renaissance
[1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:49.520]  But because of the incredible production
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.520]  And the incredible success
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:54.520]  And everything we did that innovated
[1:13:55.520 --> 1:13:57.520]  Prosperity creates monsters
[1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:02.520]  And so I said America will never go communist
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:04.520]  But
[1:14:04.520 --> 1:14:11.520]  The United States
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:15.520]  Might end up being part of blowing the whole planet up
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:20.520]  And I think that's really what I should say is that
[1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:22.520]  The fight
[1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:25.520]  That the different forces of evil
[1:14:26.520 --> 1:14:28.520]  Are engaged in
[1:14:28.520 --> 1:14:30.520]  To try to get control of this country
[1:14:30.520 --> 1:14:32.520]  Believing if they had control of the country
[1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:34.520]  Whatever reason the country has so much power
[1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:36.520]  It's very small geographically
[1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:39.520]  In 1955 we were 4% of the world's population
[1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:41.520]  We had 60% of the wealth
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:46.520]  Now that's reduced because
[1:14:46.520 --> 1:14:49.520]  But so it's not like we stole the wealth
[1:14:49.520 --> 1:14:53.520]  Innovation, limited freedom that we had compared to others
[1:14:53.520 --> 1:14:55.520]  Made us powerful
[1:14:58.520 --> 1:15:00.520]  So the big fight over
[1:15:00.520 --> 1:15:02.520]  What made this geographic area
[1:15:02.520 --> 1:15:04.520]  And this system so powerful
[1:15:04.520 --> 1:15:06.520]  And in all the hunchback
[1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:08.520]  Nadlers and demons climbing up
[1:15:10.520 --> 1:15:12.520]  Well they can't get it
[1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:14.520]  Because they don't got it
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:16.520]  It's not about money
[1:15:16.520 --> 1:15:19.520]  It's about ideas and spirit
[1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:21.520]  And everybody knows that
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:23.520]  Africa
[1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:26.520]  Is what three times geographically
[1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:28.520]  Maybe more than the United States
[1:15:28.520 --> 1:15:30.520]  It's got more wealth than we can ever imagine
[1:15:30.520 --> 1:15:32.520]  But because there was never any basic liberty there
[1:15:32.520 --> 1:15:34.520]  Never that spark ignited
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:36.520]  It has no success
[1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:39.520]  And it just goes on from there
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:41.520]  I'll come back and take your phone calls but
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:44.520]  There's just so much to cover here
[1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:47.520]  But the fight
[1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:49.520]  Over trying to get control of America
[1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:54.520]  Is the governing system of the future
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:15:56.520]  It was about a week and a half ago
[1:15:56.520 --> 1:15:58.520]  That my father came rushing in
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:00.520]  To my office in the morning and said
[1:16:00.520 --> 1:16:02.520]  Son, you've got to see this
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:04.520]  The company that holds the patents
[1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:06.520]  On the nano silver that's in our toothpaste
[1:16:06.520 --> 1:16:08.520]  That's in our immune gargle
[1:16:08.520 --> 1:16:10.520]  And that's in some of the other great products
[1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:12.520]  Like the super silver wound shell
[1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:15.520]  Had reports from back in 2007
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:17.520]  With the Pentagon working with A&M
[1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:19.520]  And Homeland Security, with the director
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:21.520]  Of Homeland Security
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:24.520]  Startifying in a restricted document
[1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:26.520]  The confidential document was noted as
[1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:29.520]  That this had been proven in their secret test
[1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:31.520]  To be knocking out SARS
[1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.520]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless
[1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:35.520]  Now they authorized us to talk about this
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:37.520]  I talked about it on the show last week
[1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:39.520]  Just hiding in plain view
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:41.520]  This is a product that we had stockpiled
[1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:43.520]  And we're still selling it 40% off
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:45.520]  Or more with the combos
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:47.520]  So that you can get it in your hands
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:49.520]  It's something that's good for everyday use
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:51.520]  Regardless, and it funds the operation
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:53.520]  So infowarstore.com
[1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:55.520]  For your immune gargle and other products
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:57.520]  That contain this key nano silver
[1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:59.520]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:01.520]  Are sold out of food
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:03.520]  But I know for a fact from sources
[1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:05.520]  To tell them people, oh, we've got it
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:07.520]  Get your order in two weeks for delivery
[1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:09.520]  We follow this pattern over and over again
[1:17:09.520 --> 1:17:11.520]  I've been on radio for 25 years
[1:17:11.520 --> 1:17:13.520]  I've had storeable food for a long time
[1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:15.520]  And I learned very quickly a lot of these companies
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:17.520]  They're fine during normal times
[1:17:17.520 --> 1:17:19.520]  They don't keep a bunch of food on hand
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:21.520]  Because of inventory, they'll still take your orders
[1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:23.520]  That's why about 11 years ago I found
[1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:25.520]  My patron supply, now the biggest
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:27.520]  Most trusted company out there
[1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:29.520]  And I became a private labeler for them
[1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:31.520]  Because they actually have it on hand
[1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:33.520]  They actually give it delivered to you on time
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:35.520]  They do what they're going to say they're going to do
[1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:37.520]  Because they want you as a customer over and over again
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:39.520]  And they're good people
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:41.520]  Now they were selling 7-10 days before shipping
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:43.520]  Because they've got the food, but they've got a package
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:45.520]  At record level orders
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:47.520]  So get your orders at an infowarsstore.com

[1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:05.520]  There are many reasons
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:07.520]  Why we need to think about what is really
[1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:09.520]  In the air around us
[1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:11.520]  We may not be able to stop breathing

[1:20:27.520 --> 1:20:29.520]  Johnny, Nicholas,
[1:20:29.520 --> 1:20:31.520]  Pastor Sam, Teddy and others
[1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:33.520]  Some of those are regulars
[1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:35.520]  We're not doing first time callers right now
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:37.520]  Summer first time, summer long time
[1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:39.520]  We love you all and appreciate you
[1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:41.520]  I've kind of pontificated tonight
[1:20:41.520 --> 1:20:43.520]  Which is okay
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:45.520]  There's a lot of news I haven't gotten to
[1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:47.520]  A lot of things I want to cover
[1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:49.520]  But I'm just going to stop now and go to your calls
[1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:51.520]  At the end
[1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:53.520]  And I've got to hit this Roger Stone thing
[1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:55.520]  Or maybe I should just do it at the start of the
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:57.520]  Weekday show tomorrow at 11am
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:20:59.520]  But it's all over the news that
[1:20:59.520 --> 1:21:03.520]  Well, Roger has to go to prison for a long time
[1:21:03.520 --> 1:21:07.520]  Because he violated the gag order talking to Alex Jones
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:11.520]  The gag order was about the trial
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:15.520]  Roger said in news articles
[1:21:15.520 --> 1:21:21.520]  That he wanted a pardon from
[1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:23.520]  Trump if he was convicted
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:25.520]  That's his right
[1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:29.520]  And it's un-American what this judge is doing
[1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:31.520]  It's insane
[1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:33.520]  Here's the headline
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:35.520]  Judge demands to know if Roger Stone
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:41.520]  Violated gag order at sentencing looms
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:43.520]  Saying she'll sentence him longer
[1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:45.520]  When she even let the jurors go out
[1:21:45.520 --> 1:21:47.520]  And talk trash about him
[1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:49.520]  It's just watching a man get tied up
[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:51.520]  And killed is amazing
[1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:53.520]  And they want me arrested they've said
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.520]  For violating the gag order
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:57.520]  I talked to five lawyers about it
[1:21:57.520 --> 1:21:59.520]  Plus I know common sense
[1:21:59.520 --> 1:22:01.520]  I'm a journalist
[1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:03.520]  She only has her little district
[1:22:03.520 --> 1:22:05.520]  I'm covering what she's doing
[1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:07.520]  Everybody else is but she says
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:09.520]  I can't talk about it
[1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:11.520]  Because Obama appointed her
[1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:13.520]  And well he's God
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:15.520]  Well I piss all over your God
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:17.520]  I piss all over the state
[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:19.520]  I'm gonna stop my son
[1:22:19.520 --> 1:22:21.520]  Cover it later
[1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:23.520]  You know what I'll just cover tomorrow
[1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:25.520]  I'm gonna keep it front and center
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:27.520]  I'm gonna go to your calls right now
[1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:29.520]  Watching these tyrants operate makes me sick
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:31.520]  But they failed to get Trump
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:33.520]  And he better pardon
[1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.520]  Stone who did
[1:22:35.520 --> 1:22:37.520]  Nothing wrong
[1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:39.520]  Alright who's up first here
[1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:41.520]  I'm gonna skip the Pompeo
[1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:43.520]  Sounds alarm over China
[1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:45.520]  Trying to take over the governorships
[1:22:45.520 --> 1:22:47.520]  Oh I told you
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:49.520]  This a long time ago
[1:22:49.520 --> 1:22:51.520]  This is what's really going on
[1:22:51.520 --> 1:22:53.520]  Trump I get it
[1:22:53.520 --> 1:22:55.520]  Why has Trump done all this other stuff
[1:22:55.520 --> 1:22:57.520]  He's gotta take China on first
[1:22:57.520 --> 1:22:59.520]  Because the globalists set it up
[1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:01.520]  To run operations against America
[1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:03.520]  So we've gotta defeat the communists
[1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:05.520]  Chinese first and then Trump can do everything
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:07.520]  So I do see Trump's philosophy
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:09.520]  And as I see action against the Chai
[1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:11.520]  Coms I get happier and happier
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:13.520]  So
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:15.520]  That's my view on that right now
[1:23:15.520 --> 1:23:17.520]  I'm still upset about a lot of things
[1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:19.520]  But this is a big deal
[1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:21.520]  Okay enough from me
[1:23:21.520 --> 1:23:23.520]  So we go to Charles
[1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:25.520]  We go to Mike
[1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:27.520]  Should we go to who's been holding the longest
[1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:29.520]  Yeah let's go to Charles
[1:23:29.520 --> 1:23:31.520]  In Atlanta Georgia
[1:23:31.520 --> 1:23:33.520]  Charles thanks for holding her on the air
[1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:35.520]  Hey Alex good to hear from you
[1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:37.520]  And show over the summer
[1:23:37.520 --> 1:23:39.520]  Well thanks for getting on brother we love you
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:41.520]  Go ahead
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:43.520]  Hey I learned this trick from a biochemist
[1:23:43.520 --> 1:23:45.520]  I was telling your phone guy there
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:47.520]  It may sound a little ridiculous at first
[1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:49.520]  But I assure you it's not
[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:51.520]  This is a known person
[1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:53.520]  I'd give you the name but I don't have permission
[1:23:53.520 --> 1:23:55.520]  But anyway she's a biochemist
[1:23:55.520 --> 1:23:57.520]  She's brilliant
[1:23:57.520 --> 1:23:59.520]  When it comes to viruses
[1:23:59.520 --> 1:24:01.520]  Viruses live in your nose
[1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:03.520]  That's why everybody walks around with a mask on
[1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:05.520]  They're running out of the mask
[1:24:05.520 --> 1:24:07.520]  Everyone's trying to keep from getting the virus
[1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:09.520]  They live in your nose
[1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:11.520]  And they cycle every three days
[1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:13.520]  So she taught
[1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:15.520]  This trick
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:17.520]  Where you just simply go to the store
[1:24:17.520 --> 1:24:19.520]  Get an 89 cent bottle of hydrogen peroxide
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:21.520]  Some cotton swabs for a buck and a quarter
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:23.520]  And if you even think
[1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:25.520]  You're getting the virus
[1:24:25.520 --> 1:24:27.520]  You feel that tingly thing going on in your nose
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:29.520]  You feel like you're coming down with something
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:31.520]  You soak the cotton swab in the peroxide
[1:24:31.520 --> 1:24:33.520]  And swab the inside of your nose
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:35.520]  Get it up in there by your sinuses
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:37.520]  Snort it in a little bit like a nasal spray
[1:24:37.520 --> 1:24:39.520]  Just soak your nose three times a day
[1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:41.520]  For three days
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:43.520]  And it will kill the virus
[1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:45.520]  And I can tell you I have tried this
[1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:47.520]  I only tried it once because I never get sick
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:49.520]  I've been in sick since 2000
[1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:51.520]  But back in 2018 I almost got a really really nasty cold
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:53.520]  And I did it and it worked like a charm
[1:24:53.520 --> 1:24:55.520]  I totally agree with you
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:57.520]  There's no doubt
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:24:59.520]  That if you fight these things
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:01.520]  You got your murder record
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:03.520]  Good day Albert.
[1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:05.520]  I appreciate the call sir.
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:07.520]  Thank you Charles
[1:25:07.520 --> 1:25:09.520]  Alright, let's go ahead now
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:11.520]  And go to Mike in Canada
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:13.520]  You're on the air.
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:15.520]  Thank you sir
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:17.520]  Good day Alex.
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:22.160]  but you're absolutely right. I appreciate your call, sir. Thank you, Charles. All right, let's go
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:29.040]  ahead now and go to Mike in Canada. You're on the air. Thank you, sir. Good day, Alex. I was
[1:25:29.040 --> 1:25:36.400]  talking with Daria about my traveling from Arizona to Canada that stopped through Seattle. And notice
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:43.680]  there's a flight. Charlie Zulu 659 that came directly from Wuhan to San Francisco airport on
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:53.040]  Tuesday, January 28th in Atlanta in the general area. Every Chinese person I saw or Oriental
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:58.000]  person had a mask on. So I'm not sure what was going in out of Seattle that day. But however,
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:03.040]  my brother did have a stopover. And by the way, thanks for giving us update because we've pulled
[1:26:03.040 --> 1:26:10.080]  it up from the flight trader 24. And there it is right there. Yep. And then I get back next day,
[1:26:10.080 --> 1:26:14.640]  I go to the same day, pretty much, I go to the post office. Chinese national in front of me
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:20.000]  has what looks like a bunch of nothing. And he's putting it in the mail and he's pulling masks
[1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:27.360]  out of boxes and putting them into the Canada post box. So I'm like, Oh, this is pretty freaking
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:33.360]  weird. So it's a lot bigger than what we're talking about. And can I because I was about to say,
[1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:39.600]  if China was hyping this and it wasn't a real threat, why would they have, this is confirmed,
[1:26:39.600 --> 1:26:44.640]  people all over the Western world buying up masks, desperately shipping them back.
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:52.720]  And I'm lucky I have one of your RZ masks actually. So I've got that in my bedside drawer. But
[1:26:52.720 --> 1:27:00.800]  can I make a statement about the communion? When Rush got that medal, I was like a one
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:07.120]  in many people and I cried like a baby. And I just want to say that before Christmas in December,
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:15.440]  I lost my mother to lung cancer. I diagnosed in April and she passed away, December 8th.
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:23.520]  I'm so sorry, brother. And we were all there, all my family was there and I had my hand in
[1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:29.760]  her hand, they just, it sucks. So if I can implore anyone right now who has a family who has children,
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:36.720]  grandchildren or a spouse to put down the cancer sticks and look around because you're
[1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:41.600]  going to lose the people around you are going to lose a lot more than what you actually are.
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:48.080]  Well, there's no doubt that I'm not telling you don't smoke cigarettes, don't smoke cigars, but
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:53.840]  let's not let's not lie. They give you cancer. And the biggest thing is tobacco only grows
[1:27:54.400 --> 1:28:00.480]  in types of mud that happen to be radioactive. The plant likes radiation. And so what people
[1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:04.240]  don't get is it grows in radioactive soil. This sounds crazy. Folks, look it up. I'm not kidding.
[1:28:04.240 --> 1:28:11.120]  North Carolina, Cuba, just look, there's a lot of radiation that's in that soil naturally,
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:16.480]  a lot of radioactive isotopes. And so when you're smoking tobacco, you're smoking
[1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:22.480]  radioactive isotopes. And it's just, it's a weird quirk of tobacco plants. They like radioactive dirt.
[1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:28.640]  And so beyond just the tobacco, people need to know that where it's grown is radioactive.
[1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:31.040]  I appreciate your call, sir. God bless you. I'm sorry about your mother.
[1:28:31.040 --> 1:28:36.240]  We're going to come back in just a few minutes and I promise we're going to take every call on that
[1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:42.480]  board tonight. Yeah, since we talked about Limbaugh, the way they demonized him and said piss on him
[1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:48.080]  and the lefts that we helped, he dies and they called him a Nazi. And it's all lies. It's all
[1:28:48.080 --> 1:28:53.680]  lies. Rush Limbaugh's come a long, long way. And he's a patriot. And that's a good thing.
[1:28:53.680 --> 1:29:03.600]  M4store.com. We have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going
[1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:07.200]  to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them. I want to thank the listeners for
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:13.600]  getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste. And it doesn't compete with Super
[1:29:13.600 --> 1:29:19.040]  Blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free, the adult or the children's.
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:23.840]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it. This is
[1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:29.920]  a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans, but also
[1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:36.800]  re-mineralizes the teeth. Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:41.200]  that causes gensivitis. This is all proven. You can make claims with this. But I have to tell you,
[1:29:41.200 --> 1:29:47.680]  no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the
[1:29:47.680 --> 1:29:53.120]  teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel. So we're really proud of it. It funds
[1:29:53.120 --> 1:30:01.120]  the operation M4store.com. That's why we're still on air thanks to you. It's Friday evening when
[1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:05.360]  I'm cutting this one-minute unscripted ad. I'm just telling you what's going on, straight shooting.
[1:30:05.360 --> 1:30:10.240]  We've sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle with the patented dino silver that's known to take
[1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:15.440]  out SARS, even in Homeland Security reports, and A&M reports. Now we've almost sold out of the
[1:30:15.440 --> 1:30:19.840]  one ounces. We've got three ounces for the next week and a half at current sales rates. This is
[1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:25.440]  just great to have regardless, and it's really good for you, and it targets bacteria and viruses
[1:30:25.440 --> 1:30:31.680]  across the board, and it funds the M4store. But if you want to get prepared, get your immune
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:38.480]  gargle silver at M4store.com. It's also in our tooth whitening toothpaste and in our super
[1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:43.200]  blue toothpaste as well. We've got plenty of that still, but at current rates, it'll sell
[1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:46.800]  out in about three weeks. So all these great silver products are the very best you're going to find
[1:30:46.800 --> 1:30:51.760]  are at one place, M4store.com, and it funds the M4, a 360 win.
[1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:03.280]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world. A lot of people that never deliver.
[1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:12.080]  Well, I'm here to tell you M4Wars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of acer spades because
[1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:17.760]  of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at M4Wars. And we are
[1:31:17.760 --> 1:31:24.000]  all a team, ladies and gentlemen. So right now, humanity's awakening is explosive. It's powerful.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:29.360]  It's incredible. But there's major obstacles coming down the road. And the only way we can
[1:31:29.360 --> 1:31:34.320]  effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game like M4Wars has to the spirit is your financial
[1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:41.600]  support. We make it really easy at M4store.com. But I am blowing through our backup money right now
[1:31:41.600 --> 1:31:46.080]  with our reporters doing triple the work they ever have, because they volunteered to do it.
[1:31:46.080 --> 1:31:50.880]  And Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, seven days a week during this election
[1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:55.280]  year that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the field. Go to

[1:33:07.360 --> 1:33:24.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:24.240 --> 1:33:41.200]  All right, the best thing I can do is just go from the top to the bottom. Luke, Chase, Jerome,
[1:33:41.200 --> 1:33:48.240]  Curtis, Joni, Nicholas, Pastor Sam, and Teddy. In the two seconds we've got left,
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:52.720]  Flush has moved through these calls. Let's talk to Luke in Illinois. Thanks for calling, Luke.
[1:33:52.720 --> 1:34:01.440]  I just wanted to say what if this whole coronavirus in China is just a ruse,
[1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:07.360]  just a massive amount of people movement. So they get all these people inside these buildings,
[1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:14.000]  then they go into the deep tunnel systems and move all these large, huge quantities of people
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:20.240]  wherever it is that they want, preparing for a possible ground invasion per take.
[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:22.880]  I mean, what's the stop there?
[1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:28.800]  Sir, you know, mainstream media tells us don't speculate. In a world of constant lies and disinfo
[1:34:28.800 --> 1:34:34.400]  and the whole history of governments staging lies and huge hoaxes, you'd be crazy not to say that
[1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:39.840]  anything's possible. Xi Jinping lost the trade war with America. Xi Jinping has people rebelling
[1:34:39.840 --> 1:34:45.920]  against him. Xi Jinping was in a hostile takeover of America, and now we're turning against him.
[1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:53.360]  This diverts it, changed the subject, is a face saving. Imagine, you know China as a cover for
[1:34:53.360 --> 1:35:01.760]  any type of rebellion or uprising. To overthrow them has a bio weapon to create fear to make people
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:08.080]  stop. And I undoubtedly, people say this has been an accidentally released, has been manmade.
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:14.000]  Okay, but I think this is a giant drill. I think the weapons real. I think folks are really dying,
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:20.480]  but I think they've got to cure. I don't have proof of that. We have proof it's manmade.
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:26.560]  We have proof that they're covering stuff up. But I agree with you. I think this is a major
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:33.280]  political cover up. What do you think? Absolutely. My internal feeling is this is just a rules
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:37.600]  considering the fact that it's only, that it's only killing males of a certain type.
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:42.160]  They may be, they may be trying to kill off certain clients. Who knows? I mean,
[1:35:42.160 --> 1:35:46.640]  this, this kind of stuff with China goes back thousands of years. So yeah, there's all these
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:50.480]  internal groups fighting, you name it. They're very sophisticated, expanding on that.
[1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:56.320]  The public over there may think it's real. There may be real deaths, but there could be
[1:35:56.320 --> 1:36:01.520]  other pathogens that are being used, chemicals, you name it, to create this panic because I've
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:08.800]  watched the videos. The panic is real, I think. I've got about that. I've watched a video today
[1:36:08.800 --> 1:36:14.480]  of them, first of all, removing people from homes and, you know, just the, the emotion
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:20.560]  sounded, sounded genuine coming off the people. It sounded genuine. It looked real. It didn't
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:27.520]  look, it didn't look stable. I agree. I would say I probably watched a thousand videos. No kidding.
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:32.000]  I've seen a few that are fake though, but that's probably people just trying to click
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.080]  better or whatever. But you can tell the real ones like, you know, there's a man and woman
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:42.800]  both laid out. You know, two didn't collapse at once, laid out. So, so China's not censoring,
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:47.680]  though, videos of the panic. Why do you think they're doing that to use it as a social control?
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:52.240]  I'm not saying the videos are fake. All of them. Most of them are real, I believe.
[1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:58.480]  Crepe, if you think I'm wrong, but the promotion of them is clearly synthetic. They're,
[1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:01.600]  they're letting these come out. They can usually clamp down on stuff.
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:07.440]  No doubt. No doubt they want that out there. They want that fear and panic to set in because
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:14.000]  then everybody's easily manipulable. That's it. Look, great points. And look, me and Luke are
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:18.320]  just regular guys, but regular guys aren't supposed to have a talk show. And by the way,
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:23.920]  with info wars, you have a talk show. In fact, I've been thinking about doing new shows and I've
[1:37:23.920 --> 1:37:30.160]  had a bunch of ideas, but I can tell you, I really think the answer is like two or three hours a day
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:37.120]  commercial free. If TV and radio stations want to pick it up, they can of just phone calls. People
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:41.920]  want to hear people. And I just want to have a phone bank where we just don't even screen them.
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:46.320]  We'll get a lot of really bad calls doing that, you know, cussing, whatever we will,
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:50.320]  but just boom, you call your own air. What do you have to say? Maybe you get five seconds,
[1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:55.680]  maybe you get an hour, but you imagine just a network, a satellite of just phone calls
[1:37:55.680 --> 1:38:05.280]  and Skype calls. No one's done that yet where you're like, let's, oh, Skype. I want to do that.
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:10.160]  That's what I want to do next. I used to innovate stuff. Now I just fight the globalist all day,
[1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:14.640]  but thank you, Luke. All right. Chase the Patriots, a talk show host of his own, right?
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:18.240]  Every time we say it's not first time callers, he calls in, we love him. Chase,
[1:38:18.240 --> 1:38:22.240]  what do you think's going on? Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call, brother. Yeah,
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:25.920]  you know, real quick, I think that a show you were talking about is my show, actually. We get
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:29.280]  people from all over the country and we're all calling in and I love it. And you're right,
[1:38:29.280 --> 1:38:33.760]  there are some crazy, so it's a little dangerous. But hey, I wanted to talk about that coronavirus
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:38.560]  and the last caller was kind of what I'm kind of going to touch on. You know, we see the AI
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:42.640]  computer, they just put out the numbers of upwards of 60 million people might be killed
[1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:47.280]  from this virus. And then I think about what the communist Chinese did and murdering about
[1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:52.080]  60 million of their own people. So then I connect the dots to what I've been seeing with Hong Kong.
[1:38:52.080 --> 1:38:56.800]  You know, they were trying to fight extradition from China to the mainland. Now with this virus,
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:01.360]  they have the excuse to say, Hey, these people are infected. They need to be removed from the island.
[1:39:01.360 --> 1:39:05.360]  But really, it's just because they're trying to silence political dissidents. Oh, I totally agree.
[1:39:05.360 --> 1:39:10.560]  This is an excuse and a face saving measure for a G, in fact, I thought this the other day
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:17.200]  for Xi Jinping and what happened in Hong Kong. Yep. And you know, a funny thing about Xi Jinping,
[1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:21.760]  Alex, you know, he's sitting here as the head of the Communist Party in China. And when I went and
[1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:26.800]  did a little research on the guy, they actually arrested and I think killed his father. How does
[1:39:26.800 --> 1:39:32.160]  someone whose own father was arrested and killed by this communist machine, then decide that he
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:36.400]  wants to work for it and continue the evil. It's just, well, that's why they love him so much.
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:42.640]  They go, Oh, Xi Jinping went through so much because he literally submitted them. They love it.
[1:39:43.920 --> 1:39:47.440]  Yeah. And the other thing I want everybody listening, understand, if you're listening to
[1:39:47.440 --> 1:39:52.720]  this broadcast, Alex puts it out for free. Everybody needs to hit that store, buy some toothpaste,
[1:39:52.720 --> 1:39:57.680]  buy some videos, buy some hats, whatever it is. You guys got to support the cause. Help Alex get
[1:39:57.680 --> 1:40:01.760]  the message out there. And thank you so much for taking my call. Check me out on YouTube, Alex.
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:05.920]  I'm live every night over there. All right, Chase, we appreciate you. Yeah, no, we have products.
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:12.240]  People need great books, great films, non GMO heirloom seeds, water filtration, air filtration,
[1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:17.360]  the big things are horrible food. Everybody else is sold out. I have the best dug in company
[1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:22.160]  out there, my Patriot. They've still got it. They've got the food on hand. It takes them
[1:40:22.160 --> 1:40:26.560]  over a week to pack and get it out to you. So get your orders in now, folks. Don't wait.
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:32.320]  And so much more Jerome in New York. You're on the air. Jerome, are you in New York state or
[1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:38.800]  New York city? I'm in the Big Apple over here in Chinatown. It's 640 p.m. Eastern standard time.
[1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:47.920]  But guess what? In mainland China, it's 740 a.m. over there, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhou, Guangzhou.
[1:40:47.920 --> 1:40:51.520]  Hey, it's time to get up and let's get to work, folks. Not unless you've got a lot of money,
[1:40:52.160 --> 1:40:56.560]  not unless you're retired, not unless you can work from the house. Guess what? You're going to go get
[1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:01.120]  on the bus, you're going to get on the subway, you get on the train or get out there in the traffic.
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:07.040]  I don't know what's going to go on now, man. That's not good. I want to hit on another thing,
[1:41:07.040 --> 1:41:13.200]  too, real quick. Here in New York, I don't know if you're familiar with Chinatown here in New
[1:41:13.200 --> 1:41:18.640]  York. I am. They've got some good food there. Yeah, I know. I live here. But well, don't forget,
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:25.200]  I have my home in Chinatown, but I'm not there this winter. It's wintertime. It's too air polluted
[1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:30.640]  anyway. But getting back to the metropolitan area here in New Jersey, New York, it's the largest
[1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:36.080]  Chinese population outside of mainland China. And guess what? We don't have one case of coronavirus
[1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:42.240]  here for some weird reason. I don't understand that. Well, tell me what you really think. Does
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:48.160]  that mean it's a hoax? I don't know. I don't know. As soon as they start popping up here,
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:52.880]  it's going to destroy the economy. In New York, everybody's hiding now. People are scared to
[1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:57.280]  go outside even here. Well, that means if somebody actually has it, they're going to hide it.
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:04.720]  I don't know. It's just, I don't understand it. Last census they had here was, I think,
[1:42:04.720 --> 1:42:12.880]  in 2015, and it was like 700,000 Asian folks lived in the metropolitan area. So my God,
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:20.000]  how many now you think it is? I don't know. It's just fishy, you might say. It's very fishy.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:24.320]  Everybody agrees with you. So we got 30 seconds left. Gut level. What do you think is happening?
[1:42:24.880 --> 1:42:32.400]  No, they let that thing get loose on them over there. It was an accident. It was an accident.
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:38.720]  They don't want to talk about it. All the smart money is, that's why there's the panic,
[1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:43.600]  is something got loose wasn't supposed to. All right. Thank you so much. Great points, Taram.

[1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:06.960]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you, we run during the breaks a lot
[1:45:06.960 --> 1:45:12.640]  of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads. So you think you don't want to hear an ad,
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:17.440]  I don't want to hear an ad, but here's the bottom line, we're barely paying the bills here, and I

[1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:03.360]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food, but I know for a fact from
[1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:08.240]  sources to telling people, oh, we've got it, get your order in two weeks for delivery. We follow
[1:46:08.240 --> 1:46:12.560]  this pattern over and over again. I've been on radio for 25 years, I've had storeable food for a
[1:46:12.560 --> 1:46:17.440]  long time, and I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times,
[1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:21.360]  but during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still
[1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:26.160]  take your orders. That's why about 11 years ago, I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.320]  trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:33.680]  on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say they're
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:37.360]  going to do, because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people. Now,
[1:46:37.360 --> 1:46:40.720]  they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping, because they've got the food, but they've got a
[1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:47.120]  package at record level orders. Now it's 10 to 14, because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus,
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:51.200]  so get your orders at an infowarstore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first,
[1:46:51.200 --> 1:46:55.280]  they're in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the info as well, so get prepared,

[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:36.960]  Air raid sirens. Today is the beginning of the rest of your life,
[1:47:39.120 --> 1:47:42.800]  and it's that simple. We're taking your phone calls, this live Sunday show,
[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:48.160]  in defiance of the globalist, no talking points. We don't screen your calls, we want to know what
[1:47:48.160 --> 1:47:52.320]  you're calling about and where you're calling from, because that's interesting, but you call and
[1:47:52.320 --> 1:47:58.240]  disagree right out of the line. You want to call in and say that Easter Bunny's real, you can.
[1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:02.800]  Want to say that Easter Bunny's not real, you can as well. Other shows don't do that,
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:08.640]  and anything this big certainly doesn't. We're not supposed to exist, we're that wild card.
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:16.240]  You're not supposed to exist, even though there's a reason the whole planet exists.
[1:48:17.440 --> 1:48:21.600]  You're supposed to just accept the corporates to let the control freaks meeting committees
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:28.560]  decide the future of your thought in your world. No. The globalists have hijacked civilization,
[1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:40.080]  they are not civilization. Let's go to Curtis in San Antonio, Texas, where they're flying
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:46.480]  infected members and have a quarantine center set up. Yes, that's now official. I'm not just
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:51.920]  saying that, that's confirmed. That's not just me saying from sources, like I told you two weeks
[1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:58.000]  ago, it's now official. Yes, we're right again. Yes, we didn't lie to you again. Yes, that's all
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:05.120]  I want to do is tell the truth again. So, Curtis, go ahead. Yeah, hey, yeah, we've seen Coletta
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:11.360]  bring them in here the other day, so it's not a problem. But I have a question. I was listening
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:18.560]  to you and Mike Adams the other day about the N95 filters not being effective. Can you kind of
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:23.280]  expound on that just a little bit? I don't know. He never did really say why it wouldn't.
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:30.000]  I'm not an engineer, but they're saying that you can get the virus through the eyes.
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:40.480]  And so a mask over your face is not going to be effective if it is communicable through the eyes
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:47.440]  or you touch services and then you eat food. So I think that's where, at least from what I've seen
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:52.960]  in the literature, that's the problem. Obviously, wearing a mask is more effective if you're an
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:59.760]  airport and you should do it. It's like saying, is battle armor, is body armor totally effective?
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:03.920]  Maybe they shoot you in the arm. Maybe they shoot you from the side that goes through or
[1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:08.720]  maybe they shoot you in the leg. But is it good to wear body armor if you're a police officer?
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:14.800]  Sure. It overall makes you safer. So I mean, I would, from what I've seen from the virus sizes,
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:21.760]  a lot of these masks are, here's an example, we sell water filters, though the highest rate of
[1:50:21.760 --> 1:50:26.240]  gravity fence. But if you look at the studies, it'll have thousands of things that cuts out
[1:50:27.280 --> 1:50:34.000]  or hundreds it cuts out, thousands it reduces, and it'll reduce something 9999. But it still,
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:40.320]  some gets through. Does that make sense? So you want to reduce everything. So maybe one virus
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:45.520]  gets in instead of 5000. Because somebody sneezes and a whole bunch go out, maybe one somehow gets
[1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:51.360]  in your eye or whatever. But if you cut out the main invasion force, that virus never replicates,
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:57.520]  it never hits pay dirt. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does actually. It does make sense.
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:04.400]  And I did buy your immune gargle and toothpaste and all this stuff this week, because I got to
[1:51:04.400 --> 1:51:11.760]  go back to Taiwan tomorrow. Oh, yeah. No, if I was, if I was going to Taiwan, I'd be guzzling
[1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:16.480]  the nano patented silver we've got that's been proven to be able to kill SARS. Now,
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:21.680]  does that mean just because you have it in your mouth? Because this is the same family of SARS
[1:51:21.680 --> 1:51:28.080]  that's going to stop it? No, but this is damn proven to be very effective. Well, I'm going to
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:34.880]  be guzzling, trust me. Well, drink a lot of water because a lot of silver is toxic as well. Sorry,
[1:51:34.880 --> 1:51:40.480]  go ahead. I've only got one more month to do there and I'm finished. I move back to San Antonio.
[1:51:42.400 --> 1:51:45.760]  Wow, you're a, you're a, you're a brave guy to go back to that area there. And this,
[1:51:45.760 --> 1:51:51.840]  what do you do over there? An engineer or something? I work for a shipping company over there.
[1:51:54.160 --> 1:51:58.000]  Well, here's the good news, the bad news, the good news is it's already spread all over the planet.
[1:51:59.920 --> 1:52:04.800]  Let me sarcastic. No, I mean, sir, the good news is, is there's no way to run from this,
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:08.960]  but the good news is we have better immunity over here. So hopefully you're going to be okay.
[1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:16.560]  Okay. That's why I bought your products. Well, God bless you, brother. Anything else, Chris?
[1:52:16.560 --> 1:52:21.600]  No, sir, you got, you have a good night. You too, Curtis. Thank you. Look,
[1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:29.600]  I don't think there's any silver bullet here. The bad news is it's a toxic virus and the bad
[1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:35.360]  news is it's spread all over the planet. And so my joke was the good news is it's already spread
[1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:39.120]  everywhere. So what does it matter if he goes back to the epicenter of it? I think that's what
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:46.160]  I was trying to say. Let's go to Joni in Ontario, Canada. Joni, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[1:52:46.160 --> 1:52:53.040]  Joni. You know, got me out. Yeah, yeah, my, my, my audio is breaking up. Say your name again.
[1:52:53.680 --> 1:52:59.120]  It's Joni. Yeah, maybe listeners can hear you, but I just got a really low audio.
[1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:05.280]  Oh, you don't hear me at all. I can hear you now. Just spell your name out phonetically.
[1:53:07.120 --> 1:53:15.040]  Joni in Ontario. Joni. Yeah, I thought it said Joni and they said, they said, go ahead. Okay.
[1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:24.560]  First off, Payette, a governor general, actually gave this Chinese researcher, they kicked out of
[1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:32.720]  the frigging country, a governor general's award. You got that? That's crazy. The other thing is
[1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:39.840]  there is no N95 mask available in my local area in Ontario. I live in small town
[1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:45.760]  a week after this outbreak. Tom Quiggan, you got to look into him. He's a good guy.
[1:53:45.760 --> 1:53:54.400]  A quick little shout out to Don Trump. Trump, you got to annex Alberta. Take over Alberta.
[1:53:54.400 --> 1:53:57.920]  They want you. They don't want anything to do with Canada anymore and I can't blame them.
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:03.600]  And you got to save stone. I hope you heard all that. Okay. All right, Joni, I appreciate your call.
[1:54:04.400 --> 1:54:09.760]  I appreciate that. It was, it was Joni on the, on the deal, not an insult, wasn't on purpose.
[1:54:10.640 --> 1:54:13.520]  Nicholas in Kentucky. Hopefully I got that name right. Is it Nicholas?
[1:54:13.520 --> 1:54:17.360]  Yeah. Can you hear me? Thank God. Nicholas, go ahead. Yes, sir.
[1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:23.760]  So first I just wanted to preface this by saying that you've done a great job by showing that the
[1:54:23.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  coronavirus has the same attack system as HIV. I oversee a portfolio and my specialty sector is
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:38.960]  a healthcare and I was doing some investigations and reading some financial reports on Johnson and
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:44.480]  Johnson and like the headline was Johnson and Johnson is developing the coronavirus vaccine.
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:48.720]  And what they were saying in the article is that what they're planning to do
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:54.880]  is mirror what they're doing for their already in the works HIV vaccine. And then if you read
[1:54:54.880 --> 1:55:00.560]  further on, it says that not only are they trying to do this HIV vaccine, that it was already in
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:07.840]  China. And in fact, 40% of the people that actually beat the coronavirus who haven't died
[1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:16.160]  were given this HIV vaccine. But I would think honestly that the case is that Johnson and Johnson
[1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:21.040]  has something to do with it and that they actually got it from the vaccine.
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:27.200]  That's what a lot of smart experts are saying is it's either an escape by a weapon or a vaccine
[1:55:27.200 --> 1:55:34.080]  gone wrong because it's definitely synthetic. Yeah. And it's just really strange how
[1:55:34.080 --> 1:55:38.640]  they just said, I guess they don't think people are going to read financial reports, but it just
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:44.080]  says how that they're pretty confident that it's close to HIV and we've already been doing these
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:47.600]  HIV vaccines in China in the area. So I think they're probably the connection.
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:52.560]  No, I agree. And they're going to come out and say, don't worry, the HIV vaccine covers this
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:57.440]  after they've created the hysteria, which it's a real virus. But the whole thing has
[1:55:57.440 --> 1:56:02.240]  been synthetically made released. And they don't want us to say it's synthetic, even though it
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:06.960]  shows it for major universities, because that exposes they did this whole thing as a plan.
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:12.960]  Oh, yes, I couldn't agree more. And I just wanted to thank you. I'm a first-time caller,
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:16.640]  but I've been a long time listener and keep on spreading the info, brother.
[1:56:17.200 --> 1:56:21.280]  I'm trying, Nicholas. Thank you so much. I've kind of exhausted the day. I've, you know,
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:26.880]  I was bragging. And I mean, I knocked on wood, but head out of cold over four years.
[1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:30.880]  And then I got one this week. So I'm kind of out of it today. I had a lot of family stuff going on.
[1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:35.440]  So I'm trying as best I can. I'm sorry to Pastor Sam and Teddy. Call me back tomorrow,
[1:56:35.440 --> 1:56:41.600]  11 a.m. I promise I'll get you back from the line on the show. But yeah, this is an incredible
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:46.960]  time to be alive right now. And something big is going on with this virus. Is it meant to crash the
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:53.120]  economy? Is it really as deadly as they say? I'm not sure, though it's leaning towards more deadly.
[1:56:53.760 --> 1:56:59.520]  I just know there's a big move behind it, and it is synthetic. And the fact that there's a synthetic
[1:56:59.520 --> 1:57:05.200]  manmade bio weapon out there, that's confirmed. Then it's just wild cards, everything. And I'm
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:10.640]  just in full battle mode, trying to figure this out. And let's figure it out together. And I'll
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:16.320]  be back David Knights on eight a.m. tomorrow, a band out video in full wars.com, four slash show.
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:20.960]  And then I'll be back 11 a.m. The war room after me at three p.m. And I appreciate this great crew
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:25.120]  coming tonight on Sunday doing a fantastic job. I want to thank all the affiliates.
[1:57:25.120 --> 1:57:32.320]  And that's an AMFM TV UHF VHF cable. I want to thank everybody and just encourage folks to stay
[1:57:32.320 --> 1:57:38.720]  frosty and stay focused because of the big stuff's coming down. Trump just defeated the
[1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:42.720]  deep states move, but they're going to strike back. We need to be looking for that attack and
[1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:45.440]  be ready to counter it. Thank you so much. And God bless you all.
[1:57:47.760 --> 1:57:53.440]  The demand for food has not let up. We are selling record amounts of it. Everybody else
[1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:59.600]  is basically already sold out or they have giant wait list. Our suppliers have an in-house
[1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:04.160]  mistaken seven to 10 days to deliver because again, they have to package it. They're running
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:09.200]  24 hours a day. But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer way than you haven't
[1:58:09.200 --> 1:58:14.000]  gotten your order in. So I wouldn't crash tonight. We wanted this virus to be peering out. We wanted
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:19.040]  it to just be hype. Looks like it is really, really bad and is manmade. And so that's why
[1:58:19.040 --> 1:58:24.720]  we're seeing the huge freak out. So get your storable food at infowarsestore.com. That helps
[1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:29.520]  fund our operation. It's insurance. You can eat a total 360 win. Again, get your food and actually
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:35.440]  get it delivered at infowarsestore.com. Get your order in. It's locked in guaranteed seven to 10
[1:58:35.440 --> 1:58:40.960]  days infowarsestore.com. And regardless, it funds the operation. We also have the immune
[1:58:40.960 --> 1:58:45.280]  gargle at 40% off. We are going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales price
[1:58:45.280 --> 1:58:53.280]  infowarsestore.com. It's Friday evening when I'm cutting this one minute unscripted ad. I'm just
[1:58:53.280 --> 1:58:57.360]  telling you what's going on. Straight shooting. We've sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle
[1:58:57.360 --> 1:59:01.760]  with the patented nano silver that's known to take out SARS, even Homeland Security reports
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:07.200]  and ANM reports. Now we've almost sold out of the one ounces. We've got three ounces for the next
[1:59:07.200 --> 1:59:11.840]  week and a half at current sales rates. This is just great to have regardless. And it's really
[1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:17.440]  good for you and it targets bacteria and viruses across the board and it funds the info war. But
[1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:24.800]  if you want to get prepared, get your immune gargle silver at infowarstore.com. It's also in
[1:59:24.800 --> 1:59:31.200]  our tooth whitening toothpaste and in our super blue toothpaste as well. We've got plenty of that
[1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:35.120]  still, but at current rates, it'll sell it about three weeks. So all these great silver products
[1:59:35.120 --> 1:59:40.160]  are the very best you're going to find or one place infowarstore.com and it funds the info war
[1:59:40.160 --> 1:59:42.160]  a 360 win.
[1:59:42.160 --> 2:00:02.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
