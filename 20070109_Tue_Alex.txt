[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  I'm great.
[00:01.000 --> 00:06.720]  A picture of gold in 2007 and beyond, and how to seize this great opportunity.
[00:06.720 --> 00:13.280]  Just call 1-800-289-2646, that's 1-800-B-U-I-C-O-I-N.
[00:13.280 --> 00:17.560]  When it comes to your financial future, don't follow the government lead, instead take the
[00:17.560 --> 00:19.400]  lead yourself.
[00:19.400 --> 00:40.440]  Pick up the phone and dial 1-800-289-2646.
[00:40.440 --> 00:45.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:45.240 --> 00:46.240]  You want answers?
[00:46.240 --> 00:54.760]  Well, so does he, he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin,
[00:54.760 --> 01:06.560]  Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06.560 --> 01:09.240]  We have a very important guest joining us today.
[01:09.240 --> 01:15.600]  He's a father of a serviceman who has refused to be redeployed to Iraq, because he's stating
[01:15.600 --> 01:21.360]  on the record that he will not follow illegal orders, and so we'll be talking to the serviceman's
[01:21.360 --> 01:23.360]  father coming up in the second hour.
[01:23.360 --> 01:30.320]  In the meantime, I want to play an O'Reilly factor clip to break down and analyze the
[01:30.320 --> 01:38.440]  low-grade, moron-level propaganda that O'Reilly uses, but that's why he's so effective.
[01:38.440 --> 01:48.560]  He's playing to that 40% to 50% of the American population who literally are mind-numbed robots.
[01:48.560 --> 01:54.560]  They literally just watch television, go to work, and believe whatever the media and the
[01:54.560 --> 01:59.760]  government say, because I mean, I don't watch a lot of television, but I do watch little
[01:59.760 --> 02:05.360]  news clips of key commentators and track the information, so I watch a few clips of a rally
[02:05.360 --> 02:11.560]  every week, and he's getting more and more mindless, more and more simplistic.
[02:11.560 --> 02:17.000]  I mean, they could basically have a robot doll that would just sit there and say, you're
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.920]  an idiot, you're a kook, you're a minority, no one agrees with you, you're a kook, you're
[02:21.920 --> 02:27.840]  an idiot, you're a moron, you're a very small group, the American people hate you, you're
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.760]  a terrorist, you support terrorists.
[02:31.760 --> 02:34.520]  That's all he says.
[02:34.520 --> 02:41.120]  Once you get paid like $10 million a year to just sit there and repeat that, it's unbelievable.
[02:41.120 --> 02:46.640]  Then we have another clip, Lou Dobbs on fire last night saying they're bringing in one
[02:46.640 --> 02:51.520]  world government, that it's a new world order, and the destruction of the U.S., because a
[02:51.520 --> 02:57.520]  new report was issued yesterday by the globalist saying, we're not done with the North American
[02:57.520 --> 03:01.960]  Union, they want to go ahead and merge it now into the Pan-American Union.
[03:01.960 --> 03:06.080]  So for a year and a half, we've been inside the North American Union, now they're already
[03:06.080 --> 03:11.240]  trying to merge it into the Pan-American Union, but they got to kill Hugo Chavez first, which
[03:11.240 --> 03:14.800]  they've been trying to do, so we'll see what happens there.
[03:14.800 --> 03:19.840]  But I tell you, it feels really good to have major newspapers and people like Lou Dobbs
[03:19.840 --> 03:26.720]  reporting the truth, because it's shocking and amazing mind-numbed robots, the brainwash
[03:26.720 --> 03:33.160]  type out there, who believe whatever's on TV, just not anything we talk about isn't true.
[03:33.160 --> 03:36.960]  But then as soon as it's on television, it must be true, and they're literally having
[03:36.960 --> 03:42.040]  problems computing right now, because the White House admits we're in the North American
[03:42.040 --> 03:48.480]  Union, the documents are there and available, it is now getting out to the public, and it
[03:48.480 --> 03:53.920]  is making people out there take a double take, because, wait a minute, he told the truth
[03:53.920 --> 03:57.920]  about the embassy program, he told the truth about the North American Union, he told the
[03:57.920 --> 04:06.080]  truth about so many other issues, and now he's telling the truth about this, you see,
[04:06.080 --> 04:11.760]  so many people won't check out my claims, and so for years, they'll just think I'm
[04:11.760 --> 04:18.600]  up here making this stuff up, believe me, I wish every day that I was making this up,
[04:18.600 --> 04:22.600]  we're not, we don't have words to describe how serious it is.
[04:22.600 --> 04:29.680]  The Neocons attacked Somalia yesterday, anybody they attack is called Al-Qaeda, also a really
[04:29.680 --> 04:34.520]  scary report here out of the Austin American statesman that I missed, and it was also
[04:34.520 --> 04:42.520]  picked up by UPI, this came out a few weeks ago, and it's up on prisonplanet.com, a headline
[04:42.520 --> 04:51.000]  mishap in dismantling nuclear warhead, warhead almost detonates in Texas, again, none of
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.360]  us can track or follow all the news, and you can bet your bottom dollar that when there
[04:58.360 --> 05:03.800]  is a mishap at a nuclear plant or at a nuclear weapons facility, it's going to be blamed
[05:03.800 --> 05:12.640]  on shadowy Al-Qaeda groups when it's an accident, that's a whole other level of tyranny.
[05:12.640 --> 05:19.840]  The Democrats are not really challenging Bush's expansion war plan, we'll break that down,
[05:19.840 --> 05:23.640]  it's a very important broadcast that we have lined up for you today, I really hope you'll
[05:23.640 --> 05:29.560]  stay with us, don't forget you can now subscribe daily to the free podcast of the entire show

[05:33.920 --> 05:44.080]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, mighty film terror storm
[05:44.080 --> 05:48.200]  is complete, shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments
[05:48.200 --> 05:53.680]  are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[05:53.680 --> 05:58.440]  Terror storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[05:58.440 --> 06:01.320]  London were carried out by British intelligence.
[06:01.320 --> 06:05.040]  Terror storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program
[06:05.040 --> 06:11.360]  to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information
[06:11.360 --> 06:12.840]  and much much more.
[06:12.840 --> 06:16.600]  Terror storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terror, it's
[06:16.600 --> 06:19.040]  an anthology of government crimes.
[06:19.040 --> 06:23.360]  Terror storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[06:36.480 --> 06:41.720]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[06:41.720 --> 06:47.160]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere,
[06:47.160 --> 06:50.120]  which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[06:50.120 --> 06:54.680]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most
[06:54.680 --> 06:57.720]  feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[06:57.720 --> 07:02.160]  Radioactive poisoning, potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling
[07:02.160 --> 07:04.680]  the thyroid with good iodine.
[07:04.680 --> 07:10.200]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[07:10.200 --> 07:14.560]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause
[07:14.560 --> 07:19.040]  upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[07:19.040 --> 07:25.760]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling new millennium at
[07:25.760 --> 07:29.320]  triple 8803438.
[07:29.320 --> 07:36.000]  Call now and get free shipping, that's triple 8803438.
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.160]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of spot wellness products
[07:40.160 --> 07:44.080]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[07:44.080 --> 07:48.360]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[07:48.360 --> 07:52.960]  I was so amazed, I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect night light, both my
[07:52.960 --> 07:55.120]  husband and I could tell the difference.
[07:55.120 --> 07:59.640]  Sole wellness dot com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around
[07:59.640 --> 08:00.640]  the world.
[08:00.640 --> 08:05.480]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil simple natural cleaning products, also
[08:05.480 --> 08:08.800]  made with Himalayan salt, I figured it would clean really well.
[08:08.800 --> 08:12.240]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[08:12.240 --> 08:16.760]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with, plus
[08:16.760 --> 08:18.200]  the service was great.
[08:18.200 --> 08:22.520]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit Soleil Wellness
[08:22.520 --> 08:37.600]  dot com, that's S-O-L-A-Y wellness dot com or call 312-224-2710, 312-224-2710.
[08:37.600 --> 08:44.160]  In his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[08:44.160 --> 08:47.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[08:47.600 --> 08:54.520]  All right, we've got a big broadcast lined up for you today, now eight minutes into the
[08:54.520 --> 08:57.680]  second segment here.
[08:57.680 --> 09:04.720]  We have the father of the Hawaiian American who is refusing to be redeployed to Iraq because
[09:04.720 --> 09:06.720]  he believes it's an illegal war.
[09:06.720 --> 09:11.240]  I commend his stand, he's been court-martialed, his father will be joining us in the second
[09:11.240 --> 09:12.240]  hour.
[09:12.240 --> 09:18.920]  I also want to play a clip of O'Reilly grilling some poor lady who stands up to him and does
[09:18.920 --> 09:25.000]  an admirable job and I wanted to walk through the different propaganda tactics that are
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.280]  used by O'Reilly.
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.520]  And we have, as I mentioned earlier, an incredible clip coming up at the bottom of the hour from
[09:32.520 --> 09:38.840]  Lou Dobbs on fire, this tops all the previous reports about the North American slash Pan
[09:38.840 --> 09:45.760]  American Union, calling George Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. out and just point blank saying it's
[09:45.760 --> 09:53.160]  a New World Order plan, and even playing clips of Bush Sr. saying New World Order.
[09:53.160 --> 09:56.360]  And there's no doubt that Lou Dobbs people watch and listen to the show.
[09:56.360 --> 10:02.400]  I've talked to some of the biggest producers at CNN and they tell me, oh, we know it's
[10:02.400 --> 10:06.880]  a New World Order, oh, we know what's happening, but we're not allowed to have you on and we're
[10:06.880 --> 10:10.040]  not allowed to tell the truth, oh, we wish we could.
[10:10.040 --> 10:13.240]  And I've had Fox producers tell me that too.
[10:13.240 --> 10:18.000]  So understand, you got a lot of sociopaths who are egomaniacs who are the news anchors
[10:18.000 --> 10:22.960]  and the people that get on television who do what they do because they sold their soul
[10:22.960 --> 10:27.040]  to the New World Order, but a lot of people behind the scenes are literally just taking
[10:27.040 --> 10:31.640]  a paycheck as mercenaries and hate their jobs.
[10:31.640 --> 10:35.680]  People ask, how come Lou Dobbs is allowed to do what he's doing?
[10:35.680 --> 10:43.160]  Back in the late 1990s, he was not given control, editorial control, and before he started going
[10:43.160 --> 10:47.640]  public about World Government and doing an excellent show, I had already just picked
[10:47.640 --> 10:50.720]  up this factoid trivia.
[10:50.720 --> 10:57.640]  So I already knew this about Dobbs that in the late to mid-1990s was about 97 or so,
[10:57.640 --> 11:03.200]  he got into a contract negotiation with CNN and he wanted editorial control.
[11:03.200 --> 11:04.200]  Few have that.
[11:04.200 --> 11:08.480]  O'Reilly has that over his program and they wouldn't give it to him.
[11:08.480 --> 11:14.240]  Dobbs left and went and ran some internet company and then at the end of the dot-com
[11:14.240 --> 11:20.720]  bust, what, in 2001 or 2002, he came back to CNN but did get a contract where he controls
[11:20.720 --> 11:24.240]  his own show year to year.
[11:24.240 --> 11:30.520]  And so that's why you see him being able to talk about real issues.
[11:30.520 --> 11:36.280]  Of course, he now has the highest ratings on CNN, higher than Larry King Live.
[11:36.280 --> 11:40.680]  Same thing, highest ratings on MSNBC, Keith Oberman.
[11:40.680 --> 11:49.840]  Now I tend to think Dobbs is a better person just analyzing and assessing him than Oberman.
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.400]  Oberman's more of a democratic operative who I admire and they've got a lot of courage
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.360]  and has done a lot of good, but you notice he's kind of backed off now the Democrats
[11:59.360 --> 12:00.720]  in power.
[12:00.720 --> 12:06.000]  He's not illustrating how they're going right along with the expansion and escalation of
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  the war.
[12:07.000 --> 12:14.440]  And you notice Oberman always acts like it's Bush running things and Bush is doing things.
[12:14.440 --> 12:18.360]  And to be fair, Dobbs does that to a certain extent in this piece that's coming up.
[12:18.360 --> 12:24.320]  He talks about, oh no, this is the elite's New World Order, but then he goes on to elaborate.
[12:24.320 --> 12:29.440]  This is George Bush Sr.'s New World Order that Junior's carrying out.
[12:29.440 --> 12:32.840]  Junior's carrying out Daddy's plan.
[12:32.840 --> 12:39.160]  George Herbert Walker Bush was, in his own words, a Rockefeller Republican.
[12:39.160 --> 12:45.880]  And that's the agenda that he's carrying out.
[12:45.880 --> 12:51.000]  And if you don't know what the Rockefeller agenda is, the stated agenda is to destroy
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.640]  the middle class, destroy our borders, destroy our sovereignty, disarm the American people
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.120]  and have a one-child policy just for starters.
[13:02.120 --> 13:06.040]  And again, the whole Rockefeller clan has written books.
[13:06.040 --> 13:12.320]  They fund hundreds of foundations in different front groups that push all of this.
[13:12.320 --> 13:14.240]  It's in triple kit.
[13:14.240 --> 13:15.640]  They're so arrogant, though.
[13:15.640 --> 13:20.160]  They know the average person doesn't spend their time reading Council on Foreign Relations
[13:20.160 --> 13:28.080]  policy papers or, you know, David Rockefeller's memoirs, 2003.
[13:28.080 --> 13:29.440]  But we do.
[13:29.440 --> 13:33.800]  And let me tell you, it is not pretty.
[13:33.800 --> 13:37.920]  Now we've evidence, and more and more evidence has come out since we started reporting this
[13:37.920 --> 13:45.480]  about 10 years ago, that Bill Clinton and the Bushes, Bill Clinton was recruited.
[13:45.480 --> 13:55.400]  In the late 60s into CIA, just like it's now come out in major British newspapers, admitted
[13:55.400 --> 14:02.480]  that Tony Blair, from the time he left high school, I mean, he was a freshman in college
[14:02.480 --> 14:10.680]  and he was already MI5, internal security.
[14:10.680 --> 14:14.080]  That's on record, just type Tony Blair MI5.
[14:14.080 --> 14:15.080]  Of course he was.
[14:15.080 --> 14:20.320]  I mean, they get these people out of high school, okay?
[14:20.320 --> 14:22.920]  And that's why George Bush Sr. met 11 times with Bill Clinton.
[14:22.920 --> 14:27.920]  That's why Bush Sr. didn't really campaign in the 1992 election.
[14:27.920 --> 14:33.080]  That's why Bush Sr., you know, now vacations with Clinton and all they do is worship each
[14:33.080 --> 14:39.560]  other and talk about how he's a member of the family because that guy is been handled
[14:39.560 --> 14:43.440]  by Bush Sr. and all the evidence we know Bush Sr. was CIA.
[14:43.440 --> 14:45.640]  We know Clinton's CIA.
[14:45.640 --> 14:53.000]  But all the evidence shows he was handling him from the early 1970s on.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  And it's perfect for them.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  It's absolutely perfect.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.760]  I mean, they can't just stay in office forever, have eight years of Bush because that's really
[15:03.760 --> 15:11.360]  who was president with Ronald Reagan and mainstream historians and presidential, even Kitty Kelly's
[15:11.360 --> 15:12.360]  written that.
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.240]  And he says that after Reagan got shot, especially, I mean, he didn't run anything.
[15:16.240 --> 15:21.640]  And then you've got four more years of Bush, and then you've got eight years of Clinton,
[15:21.640 --> 15:24.240]  and now you've gotten six, seven more years.
[15:24.240 --> 15:26.760]  How many years is that, eight?
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.400]  And then four is 12.
[15:30.400 --> 15:34.400]  And then we get eight more, that's 20.
[15:34.400 --> 15:42.280]  And then we get six more, 26 years as president.
[15:42.280 --> 15:43.280]  George Herbert Walker Bush.
[15:43.280 --> 15:49.640]  I mean, if anybody is running things from 1980 until now, if anybody's got more influence
[15:49.640 --> 15:57.880]  over the puppet power seat, it is George Herbert Walker Bush, who is a total tool of the Rockefeller
[15:57.880 --> 15:58.880]  family.
[15:58.880 --> 16:06.000]  Braggs about it, says, I'm a Rockefeller Republican.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.720]  And now they've got Jeb in the wings, they've got Hillary totally bought and paid for.
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.200]  I mean, just look at how they operate.
[16:12.200 --> 16:17.880]  And of course, remember, four and a half years ago, they set up the 9-11 Whitewash Commission.
[16:17.880 --> 16:20.920]  They were announcing, they were going to have it the next year, and they said, an independent
[16:20.920 --> 16:31.320]  voice, independent, it's Henry Kissinger, come on down, people went, whoa, wait a minute.
[16:31.320 --> 16:36.480]  This guy's the real power behind the throne, given the Bush's orders, Rothschild agent.
[16:36.480 --> 16:42.000]  Well, wait a minute, he's the big Harvard triple PhD, which he only gave to a few people
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.880]  who've been sitting that seat of power as a top level manager for the globalist.
[16:46.880 --> 16:54.960]  And it turns out that the Bush's entire administration, every week, whether it's the ranch or whether
[16:54.960 --> 16:59.720]  it's Washington or if the Kissinger has to fly to a foreign country, Bush is there, every
[16:59.720 --> 17:05.920]  week they go into a closed room for upwards of two hours.
[17:05.920 --> 17:14.080]  That just came out a few months ago, that they meet every week.
[17:14.080 --> 17:28.080]  And Henry Kissinger tells him exactly what to do, and boy, does he do it.
[17:28.080 --> 17:29.080]  It's amazing.
[17:29.080 --> 17:34.400]  And then a few months ago, a few weeks ago, about a month ago, we play a clip of Dick Cheney
[17:34.400 --> 17:45.520]  at the CFR saying that he was co-chairman in the past and that he kept it secret from
[17:45.520 --> 17:51.200]  his constituents, ha ha ha, and people email and they post to the message board under the
[17:51.200 --> 17:57.360]  video clip saying it's a fake video or saying, oh, he was joking, he hates David Rockefeller,
[17:57.360 --> 17:59.760]  he fights the new world order.
[17:59.760 --> 18:06.000]  I mean, you guys are delusional to the extreme that believe that, and that's the type of
[18:06.000 --> 18:07.800]  stuff we deal with.
[18:07.800 --> 18:12.520]  We've got David Rockefeller Dick Cheney, all these people openly destroying our country
[18:12.520 --> 18:17.360]  before our very eyes, and you tell somebody whose car is festooned with Bush stickers
[18:17.360 --> 18:26.600]  and Condio 8 stickers that, and they'll probably agree with us on most issues, but they just
[18:26.600 --> 18:28.520]  cannot compute it.
[18:28.520 --> 18:30.680]  They cannot get it.
[18:30.680 --> 18:35.760]  They will not get it.
[18:35.760 --> 18:39.360]  Controlling this government means you control tens of trillions of dollars a year.
[18:39.360 --> 18:44.480]  Now, do you think major global corporations are going to leave that type of wealth and
[18:44.480 --> 18:49.320]  power in the hands of the people, or are they going to attempt by hook or by crook with
[18:49.320 --> 18:52.320]  every energy they've got to get control of government?
[18:52.320 --> 18:53.320]  That's the biggest business.
[18:53.320 --> 18:58.480]  It isn't making computers, it isn't pharmaceuticals, it isn't making cars, it isn't making
[18:58.480 --> 19:01.360]  highways, it isn't education.
[19:01.360 --> 19:07.640]  The biggest industry is lobbying and getting corporate welfare, and now getting governmental
[19:07.640 --> 19:13.280]  power signed over to your corporation by the government.
[19:13.280 --> 19:14.280]  It's simple.
[19:14.280 --> 19:20.000]  The defense contractors owned by the central banks are simply making themselves our occupiers
[19:20.000 --> 19:26.720]  by law, and they got 20 TV shows that mimic torture and secret arrest and make the people
[19:26.720 --> 19:32.120]  doing it all heroes, and a weak mind in America watches it and is having their souls warped
[19:32.120 --> 19:38.880]  right now to accept all of this, and the minute they think they can green light and go with
[19:38.880 --> 19:42.400]  it, they are going to start going around and having gun fights with people and arresting
[19:42.400 --> 19:44.400]  people and rounding them up.
[19:44.400 --> 19:48.000]  That is, look, anywhere they're able to, they do it.
[19:48.000 --> 19:53.440]  Our government funded Mao to do it, and David Rockefeller in 76 ought to go pull that quote.
[19:53.440 --> 19:57.000]  It's in my book, The Sentinel Territory, I have the New York Times article.
[19:57.000 --> 20:02.000]  In fact, I've got to dig that out for the film I'm making.
[20:02.000 --> 20:04.280]  Just thought about it, there's so many points.
[20:04.280 --> 20:12.640]  Rockefeller, Mao, let me write that down, and he says, oh, we love Mao.
[20:12.640 --> 20:14.920]  We love everything Mao did.
[20:14.920 --> 20:21.840]  Mao had killed 60 million people by then, so if they can get away with it here, they'll
[20:21.840 --> 20:25.560]  do it, and you go, why?
[20:25.560 --> 20:29.880]  Why does Ted Bundy strangle women and bite big chunks out of them?
[20:29.880 --> 20:32.080]  Why does Jeffrey Dahmer filet people?
[20:32.080 --> 20:39.440]  I mean, it's a question you need to answer.
[20:39.440 --> 20:41.880]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[20:41.880 --> 20:45.080]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?
[20:45.080 --> 20:49.520]  The best kept secret in the world today is that now it's possible to kill cancer without
[20:49.520 --> 20:54.480]  personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[20:54.480 --> 21:00.240]  Now it's cancer's turn to die, with lasers that incorporate its patented methodology.
[21:00.240 --> 21:05.360]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and
[21:05.360 --> 21:10.640]  breast tumors of any size, without adverse side effects at a physician's office, Star
[21:10.640 --> 21:13.640]  War technology at its best.
[21:13.640 --> 21:36.400]  For more information, call 702-953-0267, 702-953-0267, or visit www.LaysMedInc.com, that's www.LASEMEDINC.com.
[21:36.400 --> 21:39.920]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[21:39.920 --> 21:44.160]  Did you know that one goal of international communism was to get our young people's mind
[21:44.160 --> 21:47.440]  off religion by getting on to sex?
[21:47.440 --> 21:52.120]  By destroying the morals of the younger generation, America will eventually become right for revolution
[21:52.120 --> 21:58.320]  without understanding why communism wanted to make young people soft and easily controlled.
[21:58.320 --> 22:02.600]  Have we witnessed this transformation of our young people away from God in the Bible to
[22:02.600 --> 22:03.600]  immorality?
[22:03.600 --> 22:08.080]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an
[22:08.080 --> 22:12.760]  absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[22:12.760 --> 22:27.840]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736, that's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[22:27.840 --> 22:32.800]  Call now, operator, to standing by to receive your call.
[22:32.800 --> 22:36.160]  Dad, can we stop?
[22:36.160 --> 22:38.280]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[22:38.280 --> 22:39.280]  What?
[22:39.280 --> 22:40.280]  Again?
[22:40.280 --> 22:41.280]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[22:41.280 --> 22:45.880]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their spark-burking water bottles.
[22:45.880 --> 22:47.640]  Why did you do that?
[22:47.640 --> 22:51.120]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen
[22:51.120 --> 22:55.960]  to them singing, are we there yet, are we there yet, for the entire trip.
[22:55.960 --> 22:58.760]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[22:58.760 --> 22:59.760]  Great idea.
[22:59.760 --> 23:03.080]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[23:03.080 --> 23:08.000]  Water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport bottles, it costs us
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.360]  less than two and a half cents per refill.
[23:10.360 --> 23:12.000]  Honey, you're terrific.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.600]  Oh, honey, so are you.
[23:14.600 --> 23:18.240]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles.
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.400]  Now can we stop?
[23:19.400 --> 23:20.600]  I need to go too.
[23:20.600 --> 23:27.800]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification bottle for only $39 by calling new millennium at 888-803-4438,
[23:27.800 --> 23:33.360]  or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[23:33.360 --> 23:36.840]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[23:36.840 --> 23:41.280]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[23:41.280 --> 23:42.280]  for your IRA?
[23:42.280 --> 23:48.240]  That's right, gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the
[23:48.240 --> 23:53.960]  financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[23:53.960 --> 23:59.320]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments, like stocks, bonds, and
[23:59.320 --> 24:02.120]  CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[24:02.120 --> 24:06.240]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[24:06.240 --> 24:07.240]  you in paper.
[24:07.240 --> 24:13.480]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[24:13.480 --> 24:18.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.840]  Call 800-686-2237.
[24:20.840 --> 24:23.360]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[24:23.360 --> 24:26.760]  Call 800-686-2237.
[24:26.760 --> 24:54.560]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[24:57.760 --> 24:59.240]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:59.240 --> 25:03.880]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, that's just about eight minutes or so, and we come
[25:03.880 --> 25:04.880]  out of break.
[25:04.880 --> 25:12.480]  I'm going to play this incredible, old kudos go to Lou Dobbs, and I want to analyze that
[25:12.480 --> 25:18.080]  clip and then also want to break down the opposite of Lou Dobbs, a man of courage and
[25:18.080 --> 25:22.520]  integrity, so you can just look in his eyes and tell he's legitimate because he's feeling
[25:22.520 --> 25:24.400]  good what he's doing.
[25:24.400 --> 25:29.240]  These pundits, they're not actually in dual order, they're just whores, and so they're
[25:29.240 --> 25:32.440]  getting off on the power, but they hate what they're doing.
[25:32.440 --> 25:37.040]  You can look at the body language of Dobbs and tell he's a good old boy, he's an establishment
[25:37.040 --> 25:40.560]  business guy, but he loves America.
[25:40.560 --> 25:44.200]  He doesn't want to kill this country.
[25:44.200 --> 25:48.440]  Every time I think about what they're doing to this country, I get mad, and lately I've
[25:48.440 --> 25:50.480]  been having a lot of anger problems.
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.840]  For years I've been able to control it, but it destroys my thinking process.
[25:56.840 --> 26:02.440]  I'm getting so mad on air about what's happening to this country that I tend to then lash out
[26:02.440 --> 26:08.600]  at other things and people around me, and I'm not even talking about people that work
[26:08.600 --> 26:09.600]  for me.
[26:09.600 --> 26:10.600]  I'm a teddy bear.
[26:10.600 --> 26:18.400]  I mean, people I can't stand out in the community and just scum suckers, and we're in so much
[26:18.400 --> 26:21.000]  trouble.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.320]  Do you know what it means to go into a North American union?
[26:24.320 --> 26:31.600]  It isn't just the end of the U.S., it's the end of your freedoms and your private property,
[26:31.600 --> 26:37.160]  and being completely overrun by third world populations.
[26:37.160 --> 26:41.760]  This is the jewel in the crown of the globalist operation, let me tell you something, overrunning
[26:41.760 --> 26:48.920]  our borders and destroying our sovereignty is light years bigger and more important to
[26:48.920 --> 26:54.920]  the New World Order crowd than even invading Iraq was to secure that oil and to use it
[26:54.920 --> 26:58.240]  as a military base.
[26:58.240 --> 27:05.280]  Deindustrializing this country is something they've done militarily.
[27:05.280 --> 27:15.440]  Global corporations will bring in food, stuffs, fruits from outside the country, Mexico, China,
[27:15.440 --> 27:22.440]  you name it, at higher prices to themselves than buying it domestically just so they can
[27:22.440 --> 27:28.480]  extinct the American farmer, and they write policy reports about it.
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.160]  That's the incredible thing, that stuff's public.
[27:32.160 --> 27:38.040]  It's just their business strategy, put people out of business, you go, well that's free
[27:38.040 --> 27:43.280]  market, no it's not when you're using slave goods, and you've got multinational corporations
[27:43.280 --> 27:48.080]  backed up by the big private central banks that control our central banks that literally
[27:48.080 --> 27:51.520]  issue the credit and literally print the money, you understand that?
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.880]  This is not free market, this is big private banks that paid off our politicians and took
[27:55.880 --> 28:01.440]  over our issuance of money, they then use the money they can create unlimited to go
[28:01.440 --> 28:07.160]  out and fund business operations to simply destroy their competition.
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.080]  It's like what Clear Channel does in radio, how they were able to buy, I don't know, 1600
[28:11.080 --> 28:12.080]  radio stations.
[28:12.080 --> 28:17.360]  They'd go into mid-sized towns and cities, and they admitted this, and they would for
[28:17.360 --> 28:25.280]  a year, two years, three years, whatever it took, sell local businesses, local dealerships,
[28:25.280 --> 28:32.560]  local restaurants, ads, it's sometimes $1 apiece.
[28:32.560 --> 28:38.720]  Now the other radio station had to charge $20, $25, $30, $40 apiece just to stay open.
[28:38.720 --> 28:45.820]  Well, after a year or two, they all went under and went dark, turned off, and then Clear
[28:45.820 --> 28:51.440]  Channel didn't even have to buy them out, and then what do you get, you lost that local
[28:51.440 --> 28:56.400]  radio station, and now Clear Channel can charge you $100 at hand when you weren't paying
[28:56.400 --> 28:59.040]  $20 at hand to that mom and pop.
[28:59.040 --> 29:05.360]  So you thought you were getting a real good deal up front early on, but you weren't getting
[29:05.360 --> 29:08.440]  a real good deal, were you?
[29:08.440 --> 29:13.440]  And it's like everything else they do.
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.520]  I mean, listen, when I go to the grocery store, my wife goes to the grocery store, there may
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.640]  be some pears or some oranges or some kind of squash we want, but if it doesn't say Made
[29:23.640 --> 29:28.960]  in America, we don't get it, grown in America.
[29:28.960 --> 29:33.880]  Now I buy a lot of foreign batteries and appliances because you can't find them there American
[29:33.880 --> 29:34.880]  made.
[29:34.880 --> 29:35.880]  It's almost impossible.
[29:35.880 --> 29:43.640]  But when it comes to food, did you know 2006 was the first year, remember seeing this number
[29:43.640 --> 29:48.440]  last year that that was going to be the year it flipped over, then I was reminded listening
[29:48.440 --> 29:55.720]  to Derry Brownfield this morning, and I tuned in and they were talking about how this is
[29:55.720 --> 30:01.560]  the first year that we import more food than we export.
[30:01.560 --> 30:04.280]  It's shameful.
[30:04.280 --> 30:13.880]  The bread basket of the world could feed the whole world, and they did this to us.
[30:13.880 --> 30:19.000]  I got a bunch of news, tons of clips, big guests coming up in the second hour.
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.560]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I'm honored to be your host.
[30:22.560 --> 30:26.760]  Thank you for tuning in.
[30:26.760 --> 30:28.040]  We're on the march.
[30:28.040 --> 30:48.920]  The
[30:48.920 --> 30:52.040]  for generic drugs was over 71%.
[30:52.040 --> 30:56.360]  Rxdrugcard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plant that offers a price

[31:34.600 --> 31:35.400]  Do it today!
[31:35.960 --> 31:37.880]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[31:37.880 --> 31:42.600]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the
[31:42.600 --> 31:46.840]  Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[31:46.840 --> 31:51.080]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a great soul
[31:51.080 --> 31:52.920]  who is currently serving our country.
[31:52.920 --> 31:56.760]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their
[31:56.760 --> 32:00.680]  lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[32:00.680 --> 32:04.840]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers,
[32:04.840 --> 32:06.280]  prior American flag.

[32:10.520 --> 32:15.000]  All markers include a 3 eighths inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod, painted and highlighted
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.040]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?

[32:35.800 --> 32:38.280]  Attention, attention everyone!
[32:38.280 --> 32:40.840]  A brand new invention just released.
[32:40.840 --> 32:45.560]  It's called RIST Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[32:46.200 --> 32:51.240]  RIST Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing,
[32:51.240 --> 32:53.480]  using a mouse or adding machine.
[32:53.480 --> 32:57.640]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad,
[32:57.640 --> 33:04.120]  or lay flat in front of your keyboard, RIST Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users
[33:04.120 --> 33:06.840]  and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[33:06.840 --> 33:11.320]  RIST Ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[33:11.320 --> 33:17.160]  RIST Ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages, and RIST Ease provides
[33:17.160 --> 33:21.720]  comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.

[33:25.160 --> 33:31.880]  That's RIST Ease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, RIST Ease.com.
[33:31.880 --> 33:37.880]  Once again, RIST EASE.com.
[34:01.880 --> 34:21.880]  Welcome back.
[34:25.080 --> 34:30.840]  Coming up in the next hour, we've got Robert Wattata, father of Lieutenant Wattata,
[34:30.840 --> 34:33.480]  who's been court-martialed for refusing to be part of the criminal war.
[34:34.120 --> 34:37.880]  You know, for all you good old boys that think it's manly to go over there and kill some Arabs
[34:37.880 --> 34:46.440]  and Persians, though you have trouble geographically finding a region with your ignorance,
[34:47.800 --> 34:53.000]  the very people running this war, the very people that have got our boys and now our girls,
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.920]  although they're dying, are the ones dismantling our border.
[34:56.920 --> 34:58.920]  Can you not compute that?
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.720]  This is a war for global corporations to seize oil and for weapons sales.
[35:05.080 --> 35:10.680]  This has nothing to do with our security and sovereignty.
[35:10.680 --> 35:16.200]  In fact, the Pentagon is quite cavalier about that fact, and the P-2OG memorandums
[35:16.200 --> 35:22.760]  and funding operation is covered by AP, UPI, Toronto Star, London Guardian.
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.280]  They say that the invasion will actually stimulate attacks
[35:26.280 --> 35:31.160]  and increase the number of, quote, terrorists, which is good because then that allows
[35:32.280 --> 35:34.840]  a spreading, widening conflict.
[35:36.920 --> 35:39.560]  And when this has come out on talk radio, the neocons go,
[35:39.560 --> 35:42.520]  we'll see, we're smoking out the terrorist.
[35:43.720 --> 35:47.720]  That's like somebody shooting your mother in the head to make you become a terrorist.
[35:48.840 --> 35:54.520]  It isn't good to go out and hurt people so that they will then come back and fight you
[35:54.520 --> 35:56.440]  and then you call them terrorists.
[35:56.440 --> 35:59.480]  No, no, no, this is meant to make a new end to me.
[35:59.480 --> 36:04.520]  Like the Soviets, our government publicly, along with the British government,
[36:04.520 --> 36:10.360]  funded linen and Trotsky and their $25 million train of gold
[36:10.360 --> 36:13.800]  when they were about to collapse right before the October Revolution,
[36:13.800 --> 36:16.840]  when the White Russians were kicking their behinds.
[36:18.520 --> 36:23.800]  The British funded that thing with New York money to bring down an empire
[36:23.800 --> 36:26.840]  and then they put those thugs in there as oligarchs
[36:26.840 --> 36:29.240]  to feed on the people the whole time telling them,
[36:29.240 --> 36:33.080]  oh, we're taking your farms and we're taking your lands and we're taking your companies.
[36:33.080 --> 36:35.480]  We're taking everything you've got for the people.
[36:36.600 --> 36:37.800]  They tell them another one.
[36:39.400 --> 36:41.640]  I mean, this is how they operate.
[36:44.840 --> 36:48.680]  They will work with anybody, communist, fascist, they don't care,
[36:48.680 --> 36:53.960]  as long as it's centralized and the Council on Foreign Relations publication
[36:53.960 --> 36:59.880]  admits that every few months, foreign affairs, David Rockefeller's written this,
[36:59.880 --> 37:05.560]  many others have written this, Carol Quigley, I'm not going to lie to you.
[37:06.280 --> 37:09.320]  It's a, depending on which version of it it is,
[37:09.320 --> 37:14.120]  it's between 990-something pages and 1100-something pages long.
[37:14.760 --> 37:17.640]  And I probably read 400 pages, some of the key chapters,
[37:17.640 --> 37:23.080]  because I was given a footnoted copy, I guess that would have been 1996,
[37:23.080 --> 37:29.080]  when it finally went back in the print, of Tragedy and Hope by Quigley.
[37:29.080 --> 37:31.880]  So I didn't read the 1100 pages.
[37:34.680 --> 37:37.560]  And I, but I did read about half of it.
[37:37.560 --> 37:44.280]  I remember I read large portions and you ought to go read it.
[37:44.280 --> 37:46.360]  How to sell that book, that's a good idea.
[37:46.360 --> 37:48.120]  That's expensive though.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.640]  And it's huge, it's like a Bible.
[37:52.200 --> 37:55.800]  And man, this guy worked for the New World Order,
[37:55.800 --> 37:59.400]  he was the head of the political science at Georgetown,
[37:59.400 --> 38:02.040]  one of the most elite universities in the country for politics.
[38:03.400 --> 38:06.600]  And he said, I was allowed into the secret records of the New World Order,
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.320]  because I've been a member, but I was allowed to study their long-term strategic 100-plus-year plan.
[38:13.320 --> 38:18.280]  And we fund Communists and Fascists, and we're here to bring in one world government,
[38:18.920 --> 38:22.040]  and we're here to totally enslave the people, because that's what's best for them.
[38:22.680 --> 38:25.720]  And we'll just type in Carol Quigley quotes,
[38:25.720 --> 38:27.560]  you can read us quotes all over the web for free,
[38:27.560 --> 38:29.640]  but don't believe it when you read it on the web,
[38:30.360 --> 38:32.360]  though the quotes I've all seen are accurate.
[38:32.360 --> 38:34.920]  I want you to trot on down the library,
[38:35.800 --> 38:39.000]  and I want you to go in there and I want you to open up the page numbers it says,
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.920]  and I want you to read him saying it.
[38:40.920 --> 38:43.880]  Like, when I say that on page 400 of something,
[38:43.880 --> 38:46.520]  David Rockefeller, three years ago, wrote that,
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.240]  yeah, he's bringing in world government, destroying America,
[38:49.240 --> 38:51.160]  and so what? He's proud of it.
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.000]  I want you to go actually read the book.
[38:57.560 --> 39:00.040]  I'll tell you, I'm chilled to my bones right now,
[39:00.760 --> 39:02.600]  and tomorrow we'll be playing some clips of this.
[39:03.320 --> 39:05.800]  Aaron Russo, an interview I did with him this weekend,
[39:05.800 --> 39:08.280]  an amazing individual, really respecting
[39:08.280 --> 39:15.960]  went totally further than he's ever gone with his meetings with Nick Rockefeller,
[39:15.960 --> 39:17.320]  who was a close family friend.
[39:17.320 --> 39:18.840]  He's got photos of himself with him.
[39:20.040 --> 39:22.600]  Nick Rockefeller approached him
[39:25.560 --> 39:30.200]  when he was running for governor in Nevada and was getting 30 plus percent of the polls.
[39:30.200 --> 39:31.880]  He did get 30 percent at the polls,
[39:33.240 --> 39:36.920]  and they came to them and he'd already made a couple big movies with Eddie Murphy and
[39:36.920 --> 39:41.080]  Bette Medler and had a clothing line,
[39:41.080 --> 39:44.680]  and a lawyer got in touch with him and said,
[39:44.680 --> 39:47.800]  Nick Rockefeller is also a big lawyer, would like to meet with you.
[39:47.800 --> 39:49.000]  You've already heard part of this on there.
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.520]  He's told the story, and he got to know Nick for,
[39:52.520 --> 39:53.560]  I don't know, three or four years.
[39:53.560 --> 39:58.280]  They were friends, and Nick was openly recruiting him
[39:58.280 --> 40:01.000]  and trying to get him to join the council on foreign relations
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.120]  and saying, who cares about these slaves that they wouldn't help you?
[40:04.120 --> 40:06.520]  They're dumb anyways, and that's exactly how
[40:06.520 --> 40:07.240]  these leaders talk.
[40:07.240 --> 40:08.040]  I've talked to some of them.
[40:08.040 --> 40:11.960]  Not as high up as a Rockefeller, but pretty high level.
[40:13.880 --> 40:17.720]  And you know, you just need to join us.
[40:17.720 --> 40:21.800]  And he told him 11 months before 9-11.
[40:21.800 --> 40:24.600]  This is when he stopped being friends with Nick when 9-11 happened.
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.040]  He told him, he said, you're going to see a big attack,
[40:29.080 --> 40:31.640]  and you're going to see an invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq,
[40:31.640 --> 40:33.160]  and it's going to be so funny.
[40:33.160 --> 40:36.040]  They're going to be looking at all the caves for the imaginary bin Laden.
[40:36.040 --> 40:37.160]  It's going to be so funny.
[40:37.160 --> 40:41.320]  Oh, they're so stupid, and everything's going to change.
[40:41.320 --> 40:43.880]  We're going to have a national ID card, police state,
[40:43.880 --> 40:45.880]  and then we're going to have even more events,
[40:45.880 --> 40:47.640]  and everybody's going to be forced to take a chip.
[40:48.760 --> 40:51.880]  But he said, don't worry, because our chips are going to say,
[40:51.880 --> 40:53.160]  kiss my hind end.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.320]  Basically, all of them say, leave us alone to the police.
[40:59.320 --> 41:00.600]  And that's what they're already saying.
[41:00.600 --> 41:03.320]  And of course, year after 9-11, Governor Ridge of Homeland Security,
[41:03.320 --> 41:07.800]  I saw him on C-SPAN say, your ID card will give you four different levels,
[41:07.800 --> 41:09.560]  green, yellow, orange, and red.
[41:10.920 --> 41:12.680]  Bad credit gets you a yellow, folks,
[41:12.680 --> 41:14.760]  and then they claim you don't have any bill of rights
[41:14.760 --> 41:18.040]  in the constitutional due processes.
[41:19.800 --> 41:20.840]  And he went on and on.
[41:20.840 --> 41:22.840]  I just, it totally blew me away.
[41:26.360 --> 41:29.400]  Oh, and population reduction, how they're going to get rid of 80% of us.
[41:29.400 --> 41:31.080]  Of course, they write that in the newspaper.
[41:31.080 --> 41:36.120]  It's not like it's a secret, but just to know what slime these people are.
[41:38.120 --> 41:40.520]  And by the way, they're behind the national vaccine programs.
[41:40.520 --> 41:42.920]  They're behind all the goodies in your vaccines.
[41:43.720 --> 41:46.600]  I mean, how you could trust a government run by you,
[41:46.600 --> 41:50.520]  Genesis, who openly funded Hitler, and who, I mean,
[41:50.520 --> 41:53.080]  Bill and the Linda Gates running around,
[41:53.080 --> 41:55.160]  because they love the little African children.
[41:55.160 --> 41:57.640]  They give them all these lovely things.
[41:57.640 --> 42:00.120]  They give them all these loving shots.
[42:04.200 --> 42:06.920]  But meanwhile, they're also involved in funding
[42:06.920 --> 42:09.400]  population reduction organizations and groups.
[42:09.400 --> 42:11.160]  I mean, can you put two and two together?
[42:11.960 --> 42:14.280]  But see, oh, that's too horrible to believe.
[42:14.280 --> 42:15.640]  Okay, then fine.
[42:16.920 --> 42:20.120]  But that's just, I just cannot believe
[42:20.120 --> 42:23.160]  how bad these people are right out in the open.
[42:23.160 --> 42:28.200]  And by the way, they didn't call you a police officer
[42:28.200 --> 42:30.520]  and tell you not to give your three-year-old a shot, did they?
[42:32.040 --> 42:34.360]  They didn't tell you Marine Corps captain
[42:34.360 --> 42:37.160]  not to give your child a shot or for your wife not to take one.
[42:38.680 --> 42:40.760]  Let's say there's a state rep listening right now
[42:40.760 --> 42:42.440]  and say Wisconsin or Texas.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.280]  You think you're a member of the elite?
[42:44.280 --> 42:46.360]  Nobody gave you a call and warned you, did they?
[42:48.440 --> 42:51.320]  You're not getting visits from the Rockefellers, are you?
[42:51.320 --> 42:53.000]  No, you're not, because you're not an elitist.
[42:53.000 --> 42:53.320]  Okay?
[42:55.640 --> 42:57.240]  And you're not somebody who's threatening them,
[42:57.240 --> 42:59.240]  so you're never going to get a visit from them.
[42:59.240 --> 43:00.680]  I've had the visits, folks.
[43:02.600 --> 43:05.320]  I've had the visits where here we'll give you a million plus
[43:05.320 --> 43:08.680]  if you come join us and be the new Rush Limbaugh.
[43:08.680 --> 43:11.720]  But we're going to control what you say in no more new world order.
[43:11.720 --> 43:12.520]  And I said, you know what?
[43:12.520 --> 43:13.560]  You just take a hike.
[43:15.400 --> 43:17.960]  And I'm not even proud of myself for doing that years ago.
[43:19.080 --> 43:19.880]  For saying no.
[43:20.600 --> 43:21.720]  That's what you're supposed to do.
[43:21.720 --> 43:22.920]  That's normal.
[43:22.920 --> 43:23.960]  Keep my soul.
[43:23.960 --> 43:25.400]  I wasn't even tempted.
[43:27.400 --> 43:28.600]  Not for five minutes.
[43:30.600 --> 43:31.880]  Not for 10 seconds.
[43:36.280 --> 43:39.640]  And to the average person who just will do anything for worldliness,
[43:39.640 --> 43:42.280]  oh, that's such a, oh, that's so honorable.
[43:42.280 --> 43:43.080]  That's so good.
[43:45.320 --> 43:47.000]  So you can have some more shekels,
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.360]  some more symbols of rank and power.
[43:55.160 --> 43:55.800]  Oh, man.
[43:57.720 --> 43:59.480]  You know, that's one thing all these bootlickers
[43:59.480 --> 44:01.480]  and social climbers don't know either.
[44:01.480 --> 44:04.120]  They would sell their mother out for a stick of bubblegum
[44:04.840 --> 44:06.120]  for some rank.
[44:07.320 --> 44:10.360]  But they don't even know that Alan Greenspan
[44:10.360 --> 44:12.600]  was anti-New World Order for 30 years
[44:12.600 --> 44:16.200]  and wrote books against the New World Order.
[44:16.840 --> 44:17.880]  I own some of them.
[44:19.560 --> 44:21.960]  And that they actually came and paid him off
[44:21.960 --> 44:24.520]  and made him the head of it just to shut up.
[44:26.120 --> 44:26.840]  That's another thing.
[44:26.840 --> 44:28.920]  These people who would sell out for a piece of bubblegum,
[44:28.920 --> 44:29.880]  they don't know.
[44:29.880 --> 44:33.480]  If you held out, you'd get a lot more down the line.
[44:33.480 --> 44:42.280]  That's another little interesting point to all of this.
[44:44.520 --> 44:46.520]  First they offer you money, then they beat you up,
[44:46.520 --> 44:48.760]  and I guess then next they frame you or kill you.
[44:49.640 --> 44:50.120]  Whatever.
[44:51.240 --> 44:55.800]  All I know is I'm not going along with these people.
[44:55.800 --> 44:58.280]  And I'm telling the police and everybody else listening,
[44:58.280 --> 44:59.560]  this stuff is real.
[44:59.560 --> 44:59.880]  Okay.
[44:59.880 --> 45:02.520]  I mean, you actually, when you really fight this stuff,
[45:02.520 --> 45:06.760]  you get approached by the evil.
[45:08.120 --> 45:09.880]  It's almost like in the old movies
[45:09.880 --> 45:12.040]  where the poof of smoke and the devil's there
[45:12.040 --> 45:13.960]  and he's going, hey, I got a deal for you.
[45:18.840 --> 45:19.160]  All right.
[45:19.160 --> 45:20.040]  Let's play Lou Dobbs.
[45:20.040 --> 45:21.800]  This is absolutely amazing.
[45:21.800 --> 45:22.600]  Then I got O'Reilly.
[45:22.600 --> 45:26.360]  I want to analyze his incredible, not even incredible eyes.
[45:26.360 --> 45:29.960]  It's just so base is what's so effective about it.
[45:29.960 --> 45:33.160]  It's so easy and just mindless.
[45:33.160 --> 45:34.600]  But that's what good propaganda is.
[45:34.600 --> 45:38.280]  It's just real simple and that's what simple minds want.
[45:39.880 --> 45:42.120]  Very effective to his lending audience.
[45:42.120 --> 45:44.920]  But here's Lou Dobbs going further than ever,
[45:44.920 --> 45:48.840]  talking about the traitorous activities of our government
[45:50.120 --> 45:51.080]  in the New World Order.
[45:51.080 --> 45:51.640]  Here it is.
[45:52.440 --> 45:55.720]  Tonight a proposal for an expanded so-called free trade zone
[45:55.720 --> 45:59.320]  from Alaska to the tip of South America.
[45:59.320 --> 46:02.120]  It's a plan from the business elites, the political elites,
[46:02.120 --> 46:05.640]  that will cost more American jobs, cost American sovereignty,
[46:05.640 --> 46:09.400]  but it would fulfill the president's father's vision.
[46:09.960 --> 46:11.000]  Bill Tucker reports.
[46:13.160 --> 46:14.360]  It's not a new idea.
[46:14.360 --> 46:17.240]  President Bush talked about it back in 1991.
[46:17.240 --> 46:21.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order,
[46:21.800 --> 46:26.680]  where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause.
[46:26.680 --> 46:29.480]  Now former United States trade ambassador Robert Zollick
[46:29.480 --> 46:32.440]  is talking about it again with renewed vigor.
[46:32.440 --> 46:34.920]  This time a new world order with business
[46:34.920 --> 46:37.640]  at the helm of trade and economic policy.
[46:37.640 --> 46:40.280]  Advocating what he calls the association
[46:40.280 --> 46:42.360]  of American free trade agreements,
[46:42.360 --> 46:45.320]  a separate non-government entity which would include
[46:45.320 --> 46:48.280]  North, Central and South America.
[46:48.280 --> 46:52.200]  What Zollick is really proposing here is a stealth trade agenda.
[46:52.200 --> 46:53.720]  It's not a national agenda.
[46:53.720 --> 46:55.640]  He's proposing to set up what's essentially
[46:55.640 --> 46:58.600]  a private organization to try to achieve
[46:58.600 --> 47:00.200]  what he couldn't get done
[47:00.200 --> 47:02.680]  when he was the U.S. trade representative.
[47:02.680 --> 47:04.840]  And this is a business agenda.
[47:04.840 --> 47:06.600]  It's an agenda that goes hand in hand
[47:06.600 --> 47:10.280]  with the United States, Mexico and Canada working quietly
[47:10.280 --> 47:13.160]  and behind the scenes to promote a common market
[47:13.160 --> 47:14.680]  with common deregulation
[47:14.680 --> 47:17.480]  for the benefit of multinational corporations.
[47:17.480 --> 47:20.840]  It's an agenda that so far has resulted in an increase
[47:20.840 --> 47:23.960]  in U.S. corporate profits of 45 percent
[47:23.960 --> 47:26.120]  while wages of American workers have risen
[47:26.120 --> 47:28.840]  only 3 percent in the last five years.
[47:28.840 --> 47:32.440]  The main danger raised by Zollick's proposal
[47:32.440 --> 47:36.440]  is that the future of American international economic policy
[47:36.440 --> 47:39.720]  which affects not only our nation's prosperity
[47:39.720 --> 47:41.560]  but its national security
[47:41.560 --> 47:45.320]  will be set not by the American people
[47:45.320 --> 47:47.480]  and their elected representatives
[47:47.480 --> 47:49.800]  but by a small corporate elite
[47:49.800 --> 47:51.880]  that is accountable to no one but itself.
[47:51.880 --> 47:55.880]  Effectively surrendering the sovereignty of the United States.
[47:57.640 --> 47:59.800]  And as justification for trusting those
[47:59.800 --> 48:01.000]  who would have the authority,
[48:01.000 --> 48:02.760]  the argument is made that free trade
[48:02.760 --> 48:04.760]  promotes democracy and the welfare of the people.
[48:05.480 --> 48:07.720]  But, Lou, one has to look no further than China
[48:07.720 --> 48:09.880]  to see whether that, in fact, is true.
[48:09.880 --> 48:12.040]  You know, it's talking about Zollick's proposal.
[48:12.040 --> 48:13.480]  It's not Zollick's proposal.
[48:13.480 --> 48:15.160]  It's Daddy's proposal.
[48:15.160 --> 48:16.600]  And people better understand
[48:16.600 --> 48:18.360]  that they mean exactly what they're saying.
[48:18.360 --> 48:20.440]  It's a new world order they're trying to create
[48:20.440 --> 48:23.480]  and they're trying to do so not only
[48:23.480 --> 48:26.600]  without approval or consent of the government in this country
[48:27.320 --> 48:29.320]  but despite the popular will.
[48:30.360 --> 48:31.800]  This is a straightforward assault
[48:31.800 --> 48:33.800]  by the elitists in this country.
[48:33.800 --> 48:35.320]  And I appreciate it, Bill.
[48:35.320 --> 48:36.120]  Thanks very much, Bill.
[48:37.640 --> 48:39.480]  But it's the opposite of free market.
[48:39.480 --> 48:41.640]  You see, they keep saying it's about business.
[48:41.640 --> 48:42.840]  No, this isn't business.
[48:42.840 --> 48:43.880]  This is war.
[48:44.760 --> 48:48.120]  This is global corporations bigger than most countries
[48:48.120 --> 48:51.160]  getting together, coming in and rewriting our trade laws
[48:51.880 --> 48:55.880]  so that any competition inside the nations is shut down.
[48:57.080 --> 48:58.600]  It's centrifugal.
[48:58.600 --> 49:02.840]  It's all there to consolidate wealth by hooker by crook.
[49:03.640 --> 49:06.440]  Then they say it's not Zollick's, it's Daddy.
[49:06.440 --> 49:08.440]  It's Daddy Bush as a public.
[49:08.440 --> 49:10.040]  It's not Daddy Bush.
[49:10.040 --> 49:12.840]  It's Daddy Rockefeller who's in partnership
[49:12.840 --> 49:14.360]  with Daddy Rothschild.
[49:14.360 --> 49:16.360]  And remember how they told you
[49:16.360 --> 49:19.560]  Nassau and Gatt would be so wonderful for the economy?
[49:19.560 --> 49:20.760]  Is the economy good today?
[49:20.760 --> 49:21.400]  No, it's not.
[49:22.360 --> 49:24.520]  We're taught what we've gone from a nation,
[49:24.520 --> 49:27.640]  the most wealthy nation in the world, to a nation of debtors.
[49:27.640 --> 49:29.800]  A nation that grew its own food to a nation
[49:29.800 --> 49:32.920]  that doesn't grow its own food now, the majority of it.
[49:32.920 --> 49:35.800]  A nation that had the highest test scores to a nation
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.000]  that has the lowest test scores in the industrialized world
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.160]  and the highest disease levels.
[49:41.160 --> 49:45.320]  The highest disease levels and just the highest crime levels.
[49:45.320 --> 49:49.080]  And everything, folks, they started waging war
[49:49.080 --> 49:51.400]  on the farmer 30, 40 years ago
[49:51.400 --> 49:53.160]  and they've destroyed the family farm.
[49:53.160 --> 49:55.240]  80 plus percent of them are shut down.
[49:55.240 --> 49:57.720]  They started waging war on the family.
[49:57.720 --> 50:00.280]  We had 10% illegitimacy 50 years ago.
[50:00.280 --> 50:01.240]  It's now over 50%.
[50:02.040 --> 50:03.320]  What they want, they get.
[50:04.120 --> 50:05.560]  Education is not a failure.
[50:05.560 --> 50:07.400]  They wanted to die on everybody down.
[50:07.400 --> 50:08.760]  They did a good job.
[50:08.760 --> 50:11.320]  The war on drugs has been a huge success.
[50:11.320 --> 50:13.000]  More drugs, more people in prison.
[50:13.880 --> 50:17.480]  I mean, once you just shift slightly your view on things,
[50:17.480 --> 50:19.160]  you can then, from an angle,
[50:20.200 --> 50:23.880]  you can then see both sides of it and it's as clear as day.
[50:25.880 --> 50:27.880]  And under this North American Union,
[50:27.880 --> 50:29.880]  you have no property rights.
[50:29.880 --> 50:31.880]  Why do you think they just have the Supreme Court rule?
[50:31.880 --> 50:33.240]  You don't have any property rights.
[50:33.240 --> 50:35.000]  And by the way, they don't even have to pay you
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.520]  for the land they take.
[50:36.520 --> 50:41.000]  It says in the ruling that private companies
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.600]  and individuals can quote lobby, city, county,
[50:44.600 --> 50:49.640]  and state officials to take your land for their project.
[50:50.920 --> 50:55.240]  Supreme Court rulings, saying they can bribe.
[50:57.960 --> 50:59.960]  Saying they can bribe.
[50:59.960 --> 51:07.960]  Thinking about that, they're building bribery into the law.
[51:09.960 --> 51:12.760]  And they're training police and military across the country
[51:12.760 --> 51:15.960]  to come for us and we take you off your land when you refuse.
[51:17.160 --> 51:17.960]  Baby, baby.
[51:19.960 --> 51:21.960]  I mean, I don't know what to say.
[51:21.960 --> 51:25.960]  The good news is that they're building bribery into the law.
[51:25.960 --> 51:27.960]  I mean, I don't know what to say.
[51:27.960 --> 51:31.960]  But the good news is they can't hide this much longer.
[51:31.960 --> 51:33.960]  This is so big, the battle is about to be joined.
[51:37.960 --> 51:39.960]  It's here after a year in production
[51:39.960 --> 51:41.960]  and traveling the distant lands.
[51:41.960 --> 51:43.960]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[51:43.960 --> 51:45.960]  Shocking, declassified government documents
[51:45.960 --> 51:48.960]  prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks
[51:48.960 --> 51:51.960]  against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[51:51.960 --> 51:54.960]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11,
[51:54.960 --> 51:57.960]  an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[51:57.960 --> 51:59.960]  were carried out by British intelligence.
[51:59.960 --> 52:02.960]  Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took us to war in Iran,
[52:02.960 --> 52:05.960]  the White House program to disseminate fake news,
[52:05.960 --> 52:08.960]  NSA spying, secret police torture,
[52:08.960 --> 52:11.960]  the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[52:11.960 --> 52:13.960]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide
[52:13.960 --> 52:15.960]  to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[52:15.960 --> 52:17.960]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[52:17.960 --> 52:19.960]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone
[52:19.960 --> 52:22.960]  who wants to be truly informed must see.

[54:45.960 --> 54:50.960]  If it keeps on raining, love is going to break.
[54:50.960 --> 54:56.960]  When the lead end breaks, I have no place to stay.
[54:56.960 --> 55:08.960]  Going down, going down now, going down, down to Chicago.
[55:08.960 --> 55:12.960]  I tell you what's going to happen.
[55:12.960 --> 55:17.960]  They're going to keep running the New World Order right straight in the ground.
[55:17.960 --> 55:24.960]  Oh man, I just can't wait to bring these people to justice.
[55:24.960 --> 55:28.960]  Somebody emailed me yesterday and they were concerned
[55:28.960 --> 55:30.960]  that I talked about killing a grizzly bear.
[55:30.960 --> 55:33.960]  It was all an analogy or analogous.
[55:33.960 --> 55:36.960]  It was like a stupid parable.
[55:36.960 --> 55:39.960]  I mean, I overdo it a bit.
[55:39.960 --> 55:41.960]  I was saying, I have an instinctive...
[55:41.960 --> 55:46.960]  I see the New World Order threatening me at an instinctive level like a grizzly bear.
[55:46.960 --> 55:50.960]  Grizzly bears coming after me, I would try to evade it or kill it.
[55:50.960 --> 55:54.960]  Just like I want to, quote, kill the New World Order.
[55:54.960 --> 55:58.960]  That's not a call for violence against grizzly bears of the New World Order.
[55:58.960 --> 56:06.960]  I'm saying my instinctive drive is to fight against it.
[56:06.960 --> 56:07.960]  That's all I'm saying.
[56:07.960 --> 56:09.960]  I mean, we have a group.
[56:09.960 --> 56:11.960]  I mean, it's simple.
[56:11.960 --> 56:12.960]  I'm an average person.
[56:12.960 --> 56:14.960]  I'm not that smart.
[56:14.960 --> 56:16.960]  12 years ago...
[56:16.960 --> 56:21.960]  Well, I guess probably 14 years ago I learned of it, but 12 years ago I got involved.
[56:21.960 --> 56:23.960]  I was, well, let's be technical.
[56:23.960 --> 56:26.960]  I was involved before that, but it doesn't matter.
[56:26.960 --> 56:30.960]  That there was a plan to destroy my country.
[56:30.960 --> 56:33.960]  And I didn't hear it from some good old boy.
[56:33.960 --> 56:37.960]  I mean, I got it directly from the Globalist Owned Documents.
[56:37.960 --> 56:39.960]  And I said, gee, I'm not for that.
[56:39.960 --> 56:41.960]  I better fight it.
[56:41.960 --> 56:44.960]  And then I'd talk about it and people would call me a kook.
[56:44.960 --> 56:50.960]  I said, well, I'll just get into the media and I'll present my facts and I'll show them.
[56:50.960 --> 56:51.960]  And you know what?
[56:51.960 --> 56:53.960]  We have shown them.
[56:53.960 --> 56:54.960]  But that isn't what this is all about.
[56:54.960 --> 57:03.960]  It's about showing them so they can then get involved themselves and try to save the country.
[57:03.960 --> 57:08.960]  No, you don't save the country by saving its borders or its sovereigns here, its bill of rights.
[57:08.960 --> 57:13.960]  You save it by invading Iran.
[57:13.960 --> 57:19.960]  So you've got it turned around backwards there, my friend.
[57:19.960 --> 57:23.960]  And you need to figure that out how you've been scammed.
[57:23.960 --> 57:26.960]  A few plugs here at the end of this hour that we've got our guests coming up.
[57:26.960 --> 57:33.960]  Then we'll have open phones from the bottom of this hour coming up through the end of the transmission.

[58:11.960 --> 58:19.960]  The great folks at Radio Free Austin put up in Dallas covering all of Central Dallas.
[58:19.960 --> 58:22.960]  Yes, 95.7.
[58:22.960 --> 58:28.960]  If you live in Dallas, please tune it in and tell everybody you know about 95.7.
[58:28.960 --> 58:34.960]  Micro FM, such an important part of the fight against the New World Order.
[58:34.960 --> 58:39.960]  Now, in closing for this hour, I have made 15 films.
[58:39.960 --> 58:41.960]  The newest is Terror Storm.
[58:41.960 --> 58:43.960]  The history of government-sponsored terror.
[58:43.960 --> 58:45.960]  It exposes the murderers that carried out 9-11.
[58:45.960 --> 58:51.960]  We need to bring them to justice, and I want you to get the video and make copies of it aggressively.
[58:51.960 --> 58:54.960]  With love for your family and hatred for the globalist.
[58:54.960 --> 58:58.960]  I want you to get it and militarily make copies.
[58:58.960 --> 59:01.960]  Smash them, crush them, never stop.
[59:01.960 --> 59:04.960]  We are never going to stop.
[59:04.960 --> 59:05.960]  They can kill us individually.
[59:05.960 --> 59:08.960]  They cannot kill the idea of liberty and freedom that God gave us.
[59:08.960 --> 59:11.960]  So get my videos at infowars.com.

[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.960]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:55.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.960]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.960]  Crashing relies on disinformation.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.960]  The United States has been seized by a global corporate crime cartel
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.960]  called the New World Order.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.960]  We just played Lou Dobbs last hour telling you that.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.960]  We've been reporting them for over a decade here.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.960]  They lied us premeditatedly into war against Iraq.
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.960]  And like Hitler turning east, they now want to go into Iran.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.960]  The torture, the murder, the secret police all by design.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.960]  They meant Iraq to be a quagmire as a pretext to build permanent bases there.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.960]  It's all in official published Pentagon documents.
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:30.960]  It's sick.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.960]  And they have the nerve to tell our troops you'll be back in time for Christmas.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.960]  We're only going to be there six months when they plan to be there at least 30 years.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960]  And now top generals have been saying that.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.960]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.960]  Your call is coming up in about 20 minutes.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.960]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.960]  Later, I'm going to air this clip of O'Reilly and just illustrate the low grade lies he puts out.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.960]  But we are joined by Robert Wattata.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.960]  His son is Lieutenant Aaron Wattata.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.960]  And he's being court-martialed.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.960]  He's on record why.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960]  He's refusing to go back to Iraq.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.960]  He's on record why the war is illegal.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.960]  How we've all been lied to.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.960]  How this is a immoral, improper war.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.960]  And his father's very well-spoken.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.960]  And I'm told he's someone of an anti-corruption crusader in his own right in Hawaii.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.960]  So, Mr. Wattata, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.960]  Thank you very much for inviting me, Alex.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:27.960]  You bet.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:33.960]  Just in a nutshell, tell us about yourself, your son, what's happening, how you got to this point.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.960]  Then let's come back because we're about to break in a few minutes.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.960]  And then break down what's currently happening.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:47.960]  Okay. Just a little bit about myself, Alex, is that in the Vietnam War, I don't know if we can call it a war.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:54.960]  It was a slaughter that the Americans perpetrated on the Vietnamese, Cambodians, and the oceans.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.960]  I was just getting out of college at that time.
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:06.960]  And I refused to participate in that war because I just felt it was just completely wrong.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.960]  It was completely unjust.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:14.960]  And, of course, I went to the Peace Corps and I later went on to college to maintain a student deferment.
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.960]  But on to my son.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:28.960]  My son joined the army in early 2003 based upon a call by the president that there were terrorists all across the country
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.960]  that people had needed to join the military to defend our country.
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:37.960]  So your son, in a well-meaning way, bought into the propaganda?
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:39.960]  He bought into the propaganda.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:47.960]  It's hard to say, but I try to convince him otherwise. But, you know, young people are young people and he made up his own mind.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.960]  That's why they target 18-year-olds.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.960]  That's right.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.960]  They, you know, they don't think and they don't read a whole lot.
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:05.960]  But unfortunately, my son did join. It was for patriotic reasons. It was to defend our country.
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:15.960]  And it was sad, of course, that he did go into the army and he, you know, later became an officer and was deployed to Korea for a year.
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:24.960]  So he wasn't too familiar with what was going on in Iraq because he was in Korea, which is a war zone, by the way.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:39.960]  And then he was brought back to the United States and he went to Fort Lewis Washington where he was assigned to a Strecker Brigade in the middle of 2005.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:48.960]  It was at this point that he began studying all about what was happening in Iraq, all the wars, you know, the battles and so forth.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.960]  And he was also hearing from people who had been in Iraq, you know, soldiers, and coming back.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:05:02.960]  And sadly, some of those never came back. And, you know, he had to get a deal with the grief of some of the families.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:16.960]  It was at this point that he began realizing that our president wholesale lied to the country, lied to, you know, the military.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:24.960]  Say there, Mr. Wattata, we'll talk about your son, what's happening to him with the court march on the other side of this quick break.
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:32.960]  And they're talking about a national draft, folks. They're pushing it big time. When will they come for your sons and daughters?
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:48.960]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:56.960]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:08.960]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House probe to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:14.960]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.960]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:42.960]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic, alarming words for our time.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.960]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:07:00.960]  Video sheltering in place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LaBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the US government.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:08.960]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions. It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step by step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.960]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:42.960]  Attention, attention everyone, a brand new invention just released. It's called wrist ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:49.960]  Wrist ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:08:02.960]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, wrist ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:17.960]  Wrist ease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games. Wrist ease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and wrist ease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:32.960]  You can order wrist ease now at wrist ease dot com. That's wrist ease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, wrist ease dot com. Once again, wrist ease dot com.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:47.960]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:09:11.960]  This young man joined the military. He was in for a few years. He heard the call in 2003. He was there in the demilitarized zone in South Korea.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:19.960]  Then he was sent back to the U.S. for talking to troops that were coming back about how horrible it was. And I want to add this. I'm right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:35.960]  There's military bases all around me. I have family in the military. I talk to people in the military. And I'd say about 85% of them hate the war, say it's all lies, know it's a joke, know it's a fraud, know it's all a big haliburton profit operation.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:46.960]  Okay, they know that. They understand that. Now, I do have one person in my family who just has been in the military for 20 years.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:57.960]  And if they said jump off a cliff, he'd do it. And he's a smart guy, but it's willful, you know, cult member behavior. And this is what happens to people.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:08.960]  But this is not the John Wayne military. Okay, this is not Iwo Jima. This is not the sands of Normandy. This is pure wickedness.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:21.960]  And again, when you read the Israeli plan in 83 to break the country up in three parts of endless war, they want civil war, you read the 2002 U.S. military plan, there is no doubt that mission has been accomplished.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:32.960]  That's death, destruction, huge profits, endless war. That's why they disbanded the Iraqi military and security forces. When all the experts said it'll make it break down, they said, of course, we want an excuse to stay there.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:37.960]  You've got to realize how cynical and mechavellian these people are.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:51.960]  All right, going back to Robert Botata. So your son, it's mid 2005. He's back at a U.S. base inside the U.S. And he starts to do research. He starts to learn. I would imagine you said he started to wake up.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:11:07.960]  Did you see the White House memo where Bush and Blair meet and they talk about how to stage WMD fines and have a lot of the people? Or did he hear about how they faked the Yellow Cake document from Niger? Or did he learn about how they plan to stay there at least 30 years and lie to the troops?
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:23.960]  What was the straw that broke the camel's back for your son who can't come on with us because he's under court martial right now, but you're here valiantly defending your son? When you started talking to your son around that time, did he say, Dad, I've got real concerns now?
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:47.960]  Yes, that's actually what happened Alex, that of course he's in Fort Lewis Washington. I'm in Hawaii and he's telling me all of these things he's hearing and he's reading about one document you can look at is the State of the Union message that Bush gave in January 2003 where he details these lies.
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:12:05.960]  And anybody that says that they're not lies doesn't understand the English language, but it was when I read that document and then I read other documents such as what Ray McGovern was saying is that all of these things about the weapons of mass destruction were fabricated.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:23.960]  They were made up. There was no truth at all to them. And yet this is what the Bush administration used to go to war. They said there was a connection between 9-11 and Saddam Hussein. None whatsoever, of course, that's been proven to be the truth.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:49.960]  It was none whatsoever. But what really broke my son's back is, this is what I'll tell you, is seeing what's happening to the soldiers coming back. He's not only seeing the soldiers that are not coming back, but he's also reading about the soldiers that are dying over there, the soldiers that are coming back with serious PTSD.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:13:00.960]  And he's just asking himself, you know, what are we doing to our own people? You know, and for what?
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:17.960]  Let's be specific there. In World War II, you only had to fly 22 missions in a B-17, though you had a 50% chance of dying. In Vietnam, one tour, that's it. I mean, even in a draft, you only make somebody serve one year, we got people starting their fourth and fifth tours.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:36.960]  Every psychologist will tell you that guarantees total breakdown. And this is serious, low intensity, asymmetrical warfare, kicking down doors, house to house, the worst type of warfare for the psyche. I mean, these people are ruined.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:14:00.960]  Oh, yes, yes. In fact, several months ago, Alex, there was a story, and it wasn't circulated very much. It was hushed up very quickly. But a soldier came back from Iraq, and the very next day after he came back, he murdered his wife, took a butcher knife or something and just butchered her up.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:06.960]  These guys, these guys, you know, we've ruined them.
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:22.960]  Well, remember, out of one Delta IV squadron? Why do they call them squadrons? I don't know, folks. Four guys came back, three of them killed their wives and children. One of them just flipped out, and the police drove up, and he was flopping around in the dirt, screaming.
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:43.960]  I believe that, you know, I met a woman who came up to me in one of the speaking engagements that we had and told me, told my wife and I that her husband had come back from Iraq and he looked perfectly normal, and two weeks later, he had committed suicide.
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:15:00.960]  You know, what do you do? This is what we're doing to our people, and for what? This is what my son kept saying, for what? For what? You know, not for our country. They're not dying, they're not suffering for our country.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:20.960]  They're doing it for Halliburton, they're doing it for Chevron, they're doing it for the Houston Oil Group, and that's the sad tragedy here, is that the American people have to understand that we've invaded Iraq, we're occupying Iraq, we're committing tremendous atrocities.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:41.960]  You mentioned we've killed over 650,000 innocent Iraqis. Many, many more are dying because we're not allowing them to have medical facilities that are in operation. There's no potable water, there's no electricity, people are literally starving to death.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:53.960]  Your dad gets power, they're lucky, about two hours a day. If they're lucky, if they're lucky. And of course, you know, the green zone, the green zone where the...
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:13.960]  They have them, sex slaves, they have them. But the green zone has got electricity all the time, it's got two Olympic-sized swimming pools, this is where our embassy staff is staying, and this is where the, you know, the public government is staying.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:28.960]  And the five square miles call the green zone in Baghdad. And if you don't think something is wrong, then you're not an American.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:36.960]  Everybody outside of the United States knows what's going on over there, and it's terribly, terribly wrong.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:52.960]  Well, I mean, it's disgusting. We know Vietnam was about an endless war for profit and control, but at least they only made you serve one tour. I mean, this, this, how they're using DU, I mean, they knew about DU in the 50s, but they didn't use it because it was so deadly.
[01:16:52.960 --> 01:17:05.960]  Now they just tell the troops, DU is good for you, we'll make you serve four or five tours, that's good for you. I mean, it seems like a go for broke just wildness now coming out of this elite.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:21.960]  Oh, you know, just for signing up now, they're giving, they're giving these new recruits $10,000. And so if you go on an extra tour, they're also saying, you know, okay, if you go on an extra tour, you know, here's another extra $20,000.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:39.960]  And so what basically we have is we have these guys that are mercenaries, you know, the mercenaries that we have over there. You know that outside of the U.S. Army or U.S. military, there are over 100,000 so-called security forces in Iraq.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.960]  These are mercenaries.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:54.960]  And many of them just randomly shooting cars for fun, splattering whole families. Now your son's up for court-martial, what's going to happen with that? What are they claiming he said that was so evil?
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:10.960]  Well, he said that the president was being deceptive. In other words, he said the truth. And they don't like that. They're offended by that. That's what they said. That's what they said in the preacher out here.
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:18.960]  Well, the president isn't even our president. He signed on the North American Union. He's a sack of traitorous filth.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:33.960]  I agree with you. I mean, people have to understand that here we have a self-proclaimed dictator who, you know, is just as tyrannical as Hitler.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:49.960]  He believes that, you know, God is on his side and he's right. Might makes right. And Americans have to wake up, have to wake up to understand what we're doing to the Iraqi people.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.960]  Where is your son right now?
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.960]  He's in Fort Lewis, Washington. My son is in Fort Lewis, Washington.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.960]  Do they have him in the morning or do they let him walk around?
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:07.960]  Well, he's walking around. He lives off base and he goes to base every day. He's been reassigned to ICOR, which is an administrative unit.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.960]  When are they going to try him?
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:14.960]  This is going to be on February 5. February 5 is going to be a court martial.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.960]  And so who did he say, I mean, where did he say these great evil words that the president's deceptive?
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:38.960]  Well, he said them in a press conference and then he also repeated some of the words in the Veterans for Peace conference in August, about August 18 of this year.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:50.960]  And so what they've done is they've taken words that he used and, of course, the judge pointed out to them that, you know, these words are very subjective and it could mean a lot of different things.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:56.960]  But the prosecution says, well, nevertheless, they're offensive to them.
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:04.960]  And just because they're offensive, that he should be spending a year in jail for every offensive word that he used.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:16.960]  This is before we're going in this country, that even soldiers, if they speak out and use words that somebody finds offensive, you're going to get prosecuted for it.
[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:26.960]  Well, I mean, they're trying to do that with just the general public that they said the first Newt Gennrich is giving speeches saying ban the First Amendment, arrest people, ban websites.
[01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:29.960]  Well, your son's going to keep his soul. That's what matters.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:36.960]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in U.S. are located?
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.960]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.960]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places U.S.A.

[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:43.960]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property,
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:51.960]  eliminate inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?

[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:40.960]  Hi, folks. Jack Browner from Midas Resources. The real money folks.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.960]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:52.960]  From November 2003 to November 2004, the dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:23:02.960]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:08.960]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:19.960]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace. To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.

[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:38.960]  Oh, wait. Why did you turn that down? Well, I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.960]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that's squeaky voice.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:45.960]  Well, what's the bed fan? It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:52.960]  I could do something like that. This menopause thing is really getting to me at night, and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.960]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself. You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:01.960]  I guess you're right. Why don't we try it? Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:06.960]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.960]  I know where we can get some more information.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.960]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:32.960]  That's bed, F-A-N.
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:42.960]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:53.960]  Look, the Naval War College head gets up on C-span and says our military works for Wall Street and the World Bank's.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:25:01.960]  Dincor, our military, and Halliburton were openly in major papers running giant kidnapping rings in Iraq.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:06.960]  I mean, they're involved in every form of trafficking and evil you can imagine.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:18.960]  And I just can't believe anybody would serve over there that anybody would be involved in this and let the military try to persecute and prosecute people.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:28.960]  It's only going to backfire on them. Now, a lot of troops are spoken out against the war. Why do you think they have singled out your son?
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:46.960]  They've singled out my son because, one, he's an officer, and this is a real embarrassment for them, that they weren't able to, you know, brainwash my son to the point that he believes that it's okay to kill.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:26:08.960]  They also do not like the idea that he spoke out, you know, that he got up and had a press conference and said that what is going on in Iraq is wrong, that the president lied, that the...
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:13.960]  Now, is that before or after he refused to get deployed to Iraq?
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:32.960]  Well, it was at the same time. It was the same time that his brigade was going to go out and so he made a public statement that he was not going to go with his brigade to Iraq because of the illegality of the war, the immorality of the war.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:41.960]  And so it was at this point in time that they, you know, of course, they forced an order on him to go and he refused to go.
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:51.960]  Now, what are they going to do when more and more of the troops say no and more and more of the troops are speaking out saying it's all a lie, what we hear on TV?
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:27:00.960]  Well, I think you're familiar with what happened in Vietnam. It was when the soldiers quit fighting that the war came to an end.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:14.960]  And I get a feeling that that's what's going to happen in Iraq because as you know, most of the troops over there, the soldiers anyway, they know what they're doing over there is wrong.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:27.960]  I have recently received an email from a soldier and he says that, you know, everybody, the word he uses, everybody over here knows that what we're doing over here is wrong.
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:34.960]  And, you know, it's just a matter of time before they're going to say enough is enough.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:44.960]  What do you think about the development of them trying to go to Mexico, talk about mercenaries, to open huge recruiting stations, to shift our military now over to foreigners?
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.960]  I mean, that's really getting imperial.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:54.960]  Well, they've been doing this for a while now. They have been recruiting people Mexico and the body of the Mexico for some time.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.960]  They've gone to the Philippines. They've gone to Puerto Rico.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:07.960]  They go to these places where the poor kids do not understand anything and they're told, oh, you know, you're going to get American citizenship if you fight.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:15.960]  Well, I understand that that's sort of a joke also because all they do is they get green cards once they're out of the military.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:17.960]  But they stay in the military.
[01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:24.960]  You know, you talk about four or five tours over there. These people are not going over there because they want to go over there.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:30.960]  They have something called stop loss and they're forced to go over there.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.960]  That's right. We've got people who've already served and they make them stay in.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:43.960]  That's correct. You know, they even have reserve officers now, reserve members of the Army. They're forced to go back.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:50.960]  But I mean, what's wrong with the elite that they're wearing the military down to nothing and recruiting foreigners and doing?
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.960]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.960]  It is insane. You're right. It is insane.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:29:10.960]  Oil and corporate profits are so important for Bush and Cheney and Rice and of course, Rumsfeld is still around there.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:17.960]  We're also talking about Henry Kissinger. We're talking about James Baker.
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:23.960]  These guys, the corporate profits are so important for them that they'll do anything.
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:31.960]  What do you think about the Democrats attempting to increase troops and now they're getting some heat so they're going to have a few hearings and try to just put everybody off?
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.960]  We have 78% in major polls of the American people.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:42.960]  70% of the troops in polls want to come home, but they're not home. Where are they? We've been there three and a half, four years.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:57.960]  You know, on January 15th, there's going to be a group called Appeal for Redress or Petition for Redress and they're going to present this to Congress.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:11.960]  They're going to present a request that Congress can do about five minutes on the other side with me, sir, because I want to talk about solutions and also how we help your son and other soldiers that don't want to fight for the New World Order.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:22.960]  It's not our military. It's not our country. And as soon as we get around to realizing that, we can get America back, but not a minute before we realize it.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:32.960]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:39.960]  It's no secret. Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:44.960]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:46.960]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:57.960]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called nobio. Nobio eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:30:57.960 --> 01:31:02.960]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in nobio.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.960]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and uranium.
[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:13.960]  Nobio's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.960]  You can use nobio under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:22.960]  Nobio is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:32.960]  Visit no-bio.com to order. That's no-bio.com or call 850-723-8599.
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:38.960]  It's a fact. You can legally eliminate credit card debt which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:47.960]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt, so why should you, the hardworking American, be harassed for yours?
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:54.960]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:32:02.960]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:11.960]  We also do credit restoration. Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.960]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:23.960]  Call Day of Jubilee. Open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:32.960]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert. Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:38.960]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:47.960]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance. If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:53.960]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:32:53.960 --> 01:33:01.960]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:06.960]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.960]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.960]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.

[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:50.960]  Music
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:34:01.960]  Music
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:11.960]  Music
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:17.960]  Welcome back. We've got Debbie Morrow coming up for a few minutes. Always great to have her.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:25.960]  I want to play this clip of O'Reilly. Again, I'm not giving him attention. I'm not focusing on the mainstream media.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:33.960]  I really think that's a diversion. But it's important to play this just to illustrate for people out there that support him and support the war and support all this,
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:39.960]  the type of mindlessness and the tactics that are being used against you.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:45.960]  I mean, you need to be aware that you're being targeted with propaganda.
[01:34:45.960 --> 01:34:55.960]  Going back to our guest, Bob Wattata, father of Aaron Wattata, Lieutenant Aaron Wattata, who's up for court-martialing on February 5th.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:02.960]  We'll be following that here. Darja Maul is being called as a prosecution witness because he was at one of the events where he spoke.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:11.960]  A frequent contributor to this broadcast will be getting him on. We'll talk about it as well. It's just unbelievably disgusting that they're trying all of this.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:20.960]  We're simply pointing out the President was deceptive. We know that he's deceptive. We know he's a criminal. We know they premeditated a lot about WMDs.
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:29.960]  They lied about everything. They're always lying. And, you know, a lot of us are outraged at the traitorous activities of this government.
[01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:39.960]  Mr. Wattata, in closing any websites you want to plug, any organizations that are moving forward trying to end this war, any way we can help your son.
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:48.960]  Well, certainly, we have a website. Thank you, LT.org. Thank you, LT.org.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:36:01.960]  That's the website that we have up there for Aaron to let everybody know what is happening and what we would like to see them do to help Aaron.
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:14.960]  Give that website out again one more time. Okay. Thank you, LT.org. T-H-J-N-K-Y-O-U-L-T.org.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.960]  I bet you're proud of your son because, you know, he didn't listen to you. He joined the military.
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:27.960]  But then he found out it was a scam and a lot of people get involved in a scam and they rationalize. They project. They lie to themselves.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:35.960]  They make excuses. He admitted he was wrong. He admitted he'd been bamboozled and defrauded.
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:45.960]  And then he didn't just slink away. He spoke out and said he was wrong and showed real moral courage. And so I salute your son.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.960]  Well, thank you very much. We are also very proud of him for taking the stand he has.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:37:02.960]  We know that he's going to possibly be put into jail for it, but, you know, there's people like Martin Luther King was jailed.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  Rosa Parks was jailed. These people stood up and said, hey, this is wrong.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:13.960]  Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was jailed. Jesus Christ was jailed. Founding fathers were jailed.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:21.960]  That's correct. Even George Washington was called a traitor by his own people.
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:26.960]  He was called treasonous. He was called a traitor because he went against the king.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.960]  Absolutely. Well, we appreciate you coming on, sir. And we'll check in with you as this develops.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:36.960]  I know you'll be very busy around the trial, but I'd like to get you on during that and I appreciate you.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:43.960]  Well, thank you very much, Alex. And just call me and you have my number and I would be glad to join you on this show.
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.960]  Thank you, Robert. Take care.
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]  Thank you.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.960]  All right. Just disgusting.
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:56.960]  And I understand you can everybody running around the military generally shooting their mouth off about the president.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:04.960]  But I mean, these are criminals. And it's in the military code that if you've got a criminal government, you are to resist it.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:13.960]  Speak out against it. It's in the Declaration of Independence. This government is criminal. Period.
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:20.960]  And you can't put perfume on a pig. It cannot be done. This war is a shame to America.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:29.960]  And the very people orchestrating this war are the very people implementing the destruction of our borders and the North American Union.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:38.960]  The very ones butchering the Bill of Rights. That's my Bill of Rights. Not yours, you sniveling neocons.
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:52.960]  That's the heart and soul of the U.S. Not you. Not you. You don't own and you don't run this country and you don't own and you don't run me.
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:39:00.960]  So stop running around on your moral high horses. Republican listeners out there, people who aren't conservative, you're Republican.
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:07.960]  You like your pervert homosexual Republican leaders.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:12.960]  That's what you like. That's what you love. That's what you're into.
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.960]  And I bring that up because it throws them for a loop.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:24.960]  George Bush is about as conservative as the $3 bill. And it's just a joke. You are a joke.
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  And you know who you are out there listening. You make me sick. This country has been completely hijacked.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:42.960]  And I just bring up a whole gay thing because it's just so ridiculous that going back to the late 80s, right through to death, there's constantly gay prostitutes in there.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:47.960]  That's what these guys are into. Bohemian gloves, going bombs. And it's just such a joke.
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:53.960]  And then I'm tired of liberals blaming Christians going, oh, look at your Christian leaders.
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:40:03.960]  You know, look at Bush. He believes God told him to do it. He just does that to manipulate Christians. That guy is as Christian as Satan.
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.960]  I'm going to shut up. Let's go to tomorrow. I'm going to go to this little Riley thing.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:07.960]  I'm going to cover some of the news.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:16.960]  And then the third hour, solid Blitzkrieg of calls. I will take unending calls. Lots of them.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.960]  Debbie Mauro, I haven't had you on in two or three weeks. Good to have you here with us.
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:28.960]  Thank you for having me back. You know, we were closed for the holidays and we could get all of our bookkeeping done for the new year.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:35.960]  And now we are ready to go and take your orders and get back to selling burkeys.
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:39.960]  Well, let's be specific. This is a Made in America black burkey system.
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:45.960]  I've bought many of them as gifts. Use one right here in the office and you get a wholesale price on it.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:51.960]  At least, you know, a $200 unit or $195 unit would be about 300 in stores.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.960]  You also have the national distributors for the British burkeys.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.960]  So you get the big discount on those as well. Call her for prices.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:07.960]  This is the big national manufacturer and distributor, but they've got Debbie just to handle radio interviews just to give you that personal customer service.
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:13.960]  And she's a wonderful lady. They've got a free brochure. They've got sports bottles that just make the water safe to drink.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:18.960]  They've got purifiers that totally clean it out. The water is full of poison.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:28.960]  What do you mean full of poison? Just go read what the EPA allows. Herbicide, pesticide, heavy metals, chlorine.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:33.960]  It goes on and on. And people need to give Debbie Marrow a call.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:37.960]  You need to...this is one area of your life you can take control right now.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:41.960]  And that's to stop drinking all of the poison that's in the water. Debbie?
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:46.960]  That's correct. You said it all, Alex. And we're here to take your calls.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:50.960]  And, you know, the burkey water systems are affordable.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:56.960]  And if you're buying bottled water now, you know, it's going to pay for itself in no time.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:02.960]  It's a great, easy-to-use system. You don't have to call a plumber to get it plumbed in.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:05.960]  It's all standalone product.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:14.960]  Main America. And it actually purifies the pathogenic bacteria system sediment and the VOCs to a non-detectable level.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:22.960]  It set a new standard in the water filter industry. And we'd like to get those out to all of your listeners.
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:28.960]  Well, you've got a bunch of different units. Describe what $198 or $195 unit does.
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:36.960]  Okay. Well, we have a travel burkey, which is a stainless steel one-and-a-half gallon system
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  that you can use in an apartment, house. It's good for one or two or three people.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.960]  It's great if you want to have it for on the go.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:51.960]  A lot of our customers, a lot of your listeners, save their burkeys for, I'll forbid, something really bad happen.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:55.960]  And I always try to encourage you, don't do that. Use it every day.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.960]  It's something that you want to do every day because bad things are happening every day to your water.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:04.960]  It's, you know, there's bad stuff in the water all the time now.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:12.960]  We don't want to wait until there's nuclear fallout because you want to get out the VOCs and the chemicals and, you know, things like MTBE.
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:17.960]  Well, every major city, they found Ritalin and Prozac and everything else in it.
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:24.960]  The fish can't even reproduce in most major city lakes now because of all the female hormones, just some birth control pills alone.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:33.960]  That's right. And we want to filter our water the best we can so that we know that we're getting out all of these bad contaminants that are in the water.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.960]  No, they're nutritious.
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:45.960]  Well, you know, I have a little granddaughter that they're trying to force my daughter into putting her on Ritalin or something just because she's a creative child.
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.960]  They're sick, freaks. Don't do not let them do that.
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.960]  No, absolutely not. We'll pull her out of school before we let that happen.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:44:03.960]  Think about America trying to, they got 15 million kids on this and now they passed the Federal New Freedom Initiative to federally fund forcing more kids on it.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:11.960]  And then getting the stuff makes them their heart expand, their brain shrink, retards growth, causes all sorts of heart attacks.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:20.960]  That's mainstream news, man. And then they'll knock your door down looking for illegal drugs, which the government shipped them to begin with.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.960]  I mean, I just cannot deal with it anymore.
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:24.960]  Absolutely.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.960]  That's a drug pushing trash.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:35.960]  That's it. That's it, Alex. And so we want to get these Berkeys out as many people as possible. So please give me a call.
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:42.960]  Yeah, give them your call. Give her a call right now. 1-888-803-4438.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:47.960]  Triple eight, 803-4438 or Berkeywater.com online.
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:50.960]  You can order via the Safe Secure shopping cart and right there in the comments section.
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:57.960]  Tell them what free gift you want with one of the big Berkeys, potassium iodate, a sports bottle, sheltering in place DVD.
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:45:03.960]  888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com. Debbie, how was your holiday?
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:11.960]  Actually, we had really, really wonderful holiday. It was kind of quiet. Thanksgiving's our big holiday.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:15.960]  Christmas, we stay home and be kind of quiet and got real rested.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:18.960]  That's good. I wish I would have done that.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:19.960]  Yeah, it was great.
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:23.960]  Hey, Debbie, thank you for coming on. Say hi to your husband and family for me.
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:27.960]  I will. Thank you for having me and I look forward to hearing from your listeners.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:31.960]  Leave your number twice so in case I don't hear it correctly the first time, okay?
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:32.960]  Debbie, thank you.
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:33.960]  Thank you. God bless.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:40.960]  God bless you. 888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com or order via infowars.com.
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:47.960]  Okay, there's so many lies. I'm going to play it and we're going to stop the tape and I'm going to comment as we go through it,
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:51.960]  or I would never be able to later comment on all of it.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  This is O'Reilly with the leader of the group that protested when the Democrats were trying to shill with their pro-war position
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.960]  after flip-flopping.
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:08.960]  Okay, and then notice how he tries to say they have no members. They're a little group.
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:16.960]  They're nobody. They're disrupting. They're bad. They're crazy. It's all buzzwords. Here it is.
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:20.960]  Even though the Democrats took control of Congress today, some on the far left are not happy.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:26.960]  When Democratic Congressman Rahm Emanuel tried to give a speech yesterday, here's what happened.
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:29.960]  At every step of the...at every...
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.960]  Okay, at every...
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:37.960]  Alright.
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.960]  Alright, what are you...
[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:43.960]  We're going to keep going here.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:46.960]  We're going to have a....
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:49.960]  Thank you.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:57.360]  No, Emmanuel could not get his remarks out. Joining us from Washington, Senator Taylor,
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:00.400]  prominent member of the far-left group, the world can't wait.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:07.520]  Why some members of your group were in that mob, that screaming mob? What do you do that
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.280]  and what's the worthiness of that?
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:15.760]  Well, Bill, right now what you see is the U.S. is involved in a criminal war in Iraq.
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.600]  It was launched illegally. It's cost hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives. It's cost thousands
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.040]  of U.S. soldiers' lives. There's been a whole doctrine of preemptive war that's been codified
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:30.200]  into place and an institutionalization of torture. These are war crimes and crimes against humanity,
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:34.360]  and if Congress is not speaking about them, so people have an obligation to step up and
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.480]  speak the truth and to demand a stop to these crimes.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:43.880]  Okay, so you're saying that the new Democrat Congress in here now, you're not even going
[01:47:43.880 --> 01:47:47.280]  to give them a chance to address the things that you just said.
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:54.160]  Okay, let's stop right there. Let's stop right there. These Democrat groups attack people
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:57.440]  like me when I said you watched the Democrats are going to come in and say increase the
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:05.000]  troops. They're going to do whatever that Henry Kissinger, George Schultz slash James
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.240]  Baker group says. And then now those groups, and I have to commend them, did after they
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:15.080]  saw the Democrats were going to basically go for expansion of the war, they got mad,
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.880]  and they went in there and tried to shut down press conferences to get media attention
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:24.400]  that the American people demand. So here he is claiming that they're not even giving the
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:30.200]  Democrats a chance. That's why number one, at least we're trying to talk about how they're
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:35.880]  a minority view and that people don't agree with them and that it's her view that the
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:41.440]  war was a lie and that it's her opinion. No, those are facts, buddy, like gravity. Let's
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:47.040]  go back to Bill O'Reilly down. So they can't even address it even if they wanted to. Is
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:51.120]  that what you're telling me? No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the Democrats
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.880]  have made very abundantly clear that they are not calling for an immediate withdrawal
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:00.120]  from Iraq. This is the only just solution right now. So unless the Democrats or the
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.480]  Republicans or whatever official, whoever official, whoever's elected immediately withdraw
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:11.400]  from Iraq, you will not let them speak. Your group will shout them down. This is your version
[01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:16.960]  of democracy. You think this is what the country should be. They speak all the time. The voices
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.680]  that are not heard are the voices like Cindy Sheehan's, like the protesters who are out
[01:49:20.680 --> 01:49:24.400]  today demanding a plenty of publicity and she gets plenty of the opportunity. The voices
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:27.960]  talking about the war crimes that are being committed in our names right now, the fact
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.320]  that because of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi people's lives
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:36.680]  have been destroyed, people have been killed, torture has been committed and legalized.
[01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:41.480]  But look, these things are not being discussed the way they should. That's your opinion,
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:47.120]  okay? Stop right there. That's your opinion. White House memos say they can torture people
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:53.680]  till they die. Official torture children with pliers. It's all there. They've used it.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:59.640]  They've done it. No, no, that's her opinion. Now again, he's playing to this mindless audience
[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:08.360]  that's got Alzheimer's out there who literally can't even, they just lack a rally. They just
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.400]  want to be lied to by this butcher of America. Here it is.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:15.360]  But those are facts. No, they're not facts. You are alone.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.840]  The torture is being committed. And if you want only to take a night.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.080]  She goes, those are facts. He says that's her opinion. Okay. About it being an unjust
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:34.000]  war, a staged war, they let us into war, torture being legitimized. No, no, those aren't facts.
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:42.080]  That's your opinion. She says, no, they are facts. He goes, you're alone. You're alone.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.840]  She's a loon. That's all he ever does with people who disagree with it. He calls them
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:52.760]  a loon. Well, you're a pervert, buddy. You're a perv
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:58.680]  who sexually harasses admittedly women hardcore that work for you.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:02.480]  I mean, how do you like that? I mean, if anybody is a loon, it's you, Bill O'Reilly, who would
[01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:06.440]  get up there and lie about the death of America, who would push the North American Union.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:12.320]  I've heard you say ban SUVs, ban the militia. You're a piece of trash. You're not a real
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:16.960]  conservative. You're a piece of filth. You got to be ashamed of yourself. You're a big
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:22.640]  bully. You're a punk. Well, come back and play the rest of what this punk has to say.
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:25.640]  Stay with us. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:40.640]  It's here after a year in production and traveling the distant lands. My new film, Terror Storm,
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:44.920]  is complete. Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments are
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:49.640]  orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:55.480]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:59.360]  were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm Chronicles, the lies that took
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:05.200]  us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret
[01:52:05.200 --> 01:52:10.560]  police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:14.520]  guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:20.040]  crimes. Terror Storm is a film of everyone who wants to be truly informed, must see. Get

[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:58.560]  Welcome back. Good old Troy, unless Virginia hadn't been on in a few weeks, he's called
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:55:05.720]  in. And we'll go to Don Wolf, Joe, and many others. Let me finish up with O'Reilly, though.
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:09.160]  And this young lady did an excellent job of against him. And then that's how you do it.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.040]  Just talk over him, stay on your point. Just ignore him. He was getting real upset. His
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:19.720]  face was turning red. But it doesn't matter. He still wins because his audience is mindless
[01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:24.960]  idiots who want to convince themselves that everything's all right, that America's perfect,
[01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:30.360]  but nothing's wrong, that everything's kosher. And as long as he just calls people crazy,
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:34.760]  then everything must be true, he says. So back to the tape.
[01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.280]  That's your opinion, okay? And you're entirely under the Constitution to your opinion.
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:39.280]  But those are facts.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:40.280]  No, they're not facts. You are alone.
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.280]  The torture is being...
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:46.600]  You're a lunatic. And if you weren't a lunatic, 90% of America would agree with you. You're
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:47.600]  a lunatic.
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:48.600]  Stop.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:49.600]  You got maybe 8%.
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:54.880]  Stop. He says maybe 8% agree with you. Folks, there have been... It's got to be 56%.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.640]  There's something scientific polls the last few months. They've been all over television.
[01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:06.520]  78%. I say that. It's between 75% and 82% depending on what poll you look at. So I just say 78,
[01:56:06.520 --> 01:56:13.400]  you know, average it. Go pull it up yourself. Are against the war. 70% of the troops. I
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:18.300]  mean, everybody knows that it's a wildly unpopular war, even with a bunch of Republican senators
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:26.680]  and congressmen from Hagel to Paul. And no, you're a lun. It's crazy. Only 8% are against
[01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:27.680]  it.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:33.240]  Talk about lying. I mean, just listen to what comes out of his mouth. But people at home,
[01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:37.120]  man, watching Fox News and they're rocking chairs, they're laughing. Everybody loves
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:41.480]  it. Everybody likes it. It's good. Here, go back to it.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:44.600]  You're a lunatic. You've got maybe 8% that agree with you.
[01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:49.560]  No, the majority of the country is against this president. The majority of the country,
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:54.160]  Miss Taylor, with all the respect, think that you're a lun. Okay? And wouldn't you say yes?
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.160]  And if they would...
[01:56:55.160 --> 01:57:03.160]  See, it's high school popularity mentality. It's junior high low grade moron behavior.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:11.280]  Everybody thinks you're a cook. Ha, ha, she thinks the world's round. Ha, ha, she's stupid.
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:17.920]  I mean, it's just, it's base. But base propaganda is effective with the dumb down public. Back
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:20.040]  to the, back to the pervert.
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:24.520]  Be out with the signs when you demonstrate, instead of you and your paltry little group,
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:26.000]  which number about 50 or 60.
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.960]  That's a lie as well. That is a lie as well. No, we don't want attention. We want an end
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:32.720]  to the crimes being committed in our names or we're complicit with them.
[01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:33.720]  No, let's stop right there.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:34.960]  What's wrong with you, man?
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:39.560]  World can't wait. Those other groups have had over 5 million people in the streets of
[01:57:39.560 --> 01:57:44.080]  America. I mean, yeah, it's a couple thousand here in Austin, a couple hundred thousand
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:48.040]  in New York, a couple hundred thousand in DC, a couple hundred thousand in LA, a couple
[01:57:48.040 --> 01:57:50.920]  hundred thousand in Chicago, a couple hundred thousand in London.
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:55.000]  But I've been at demonstrations where it had to be a million in New York. I mean, I'd
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.960]  be up in the Empire State Building looking down at the RNC and there'd be people protesting
[01:58:01.960 --> 01:58:07.000]  across 20 roads, you know, 20 different blocks, just everywhere people. And the news would
[01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:15.840]  say 200,000. Hell, one street was 200,000. But it doesn't matter. He says 50 people.
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:21.560]  That's how many in America are against the war. 50. Back to the liar.
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:24.360]  Primes being committed in our names or we're complicit with them.
[01:58:24.360 --> 01:58:28.800]  Okay, then what's wrong with the American people in voting in for two terms, President
[01:58:28.800 --> 01:58:33.480]  Bush, and now voting in Democrats whom you say won't do anything differently? What's
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:35.960]  wrong with the majority of the American people?
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.960]  Are we all stupid?
[01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:40.240]  Everybody knows no, the majority of the American people.
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:44.040]  Over and over again, he says what's wrong with the American people are the majority
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:48.600]  stupid of the majority or for the war. Now, everyone knows the majority or against the
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:54.880]  war. So he lies and says the majority or for the war. Then he says, oh, and you say they're
[01:58:54.880 --> 01:59:03.840]  stupid. See, based psychology, this is what they do. But it works on a lot of people.
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:12.720]  All right, we'll come back. Finish up your Riley clip. Go to Troy from Florida and others.

[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:33.680]  are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter. So

[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:50.880]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:58.200]  All right. Your phone calls are coming up on this live fifth day of January, 2007,
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:05.200]  early into the third hour. You know, some immigrants are arrested six times, but the
[02:01:05.200 --> 02:01:11.760]  average was actually eight times before anything's done to them. There's also been a neocon attack
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:18.840]  on Somalia, a nuclear weapon almost exploded in Texas. That's United Press International
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:24.000]  in the Austin American statesman. We'll tell you about that. The Democrats aren't really
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.920]  challenging the war. We'll break that down. I was finishing up with O'Reilly, but I mean,
[02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:34.040]  listen to the clip of a plane where he's attacking the World Can't Wait group. And he's saying,
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:39.600]  you have 50 members, you're nobody. This group alone has got millions in the streets. Then
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:44.160]  he says, the majority of Americans are for the war. You, what are the majority of Americans
[02:01:44.160 --> 02:01:48.880]  dumb? So number one, the majority of Americans aren't for the war. That's admitted. That's
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:56.080]  a lie. What he said. And on top of that, the majority, you know, he's claiming she's saying
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.800]  you're stupid when she didn't say that. So it just, it just, there's more of it. Every
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:05.760]  trick in the book, it's mindless, but it works on a mindless public. Go ahead.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:10.880]  What's wrong with the majority of the American people? Are we all stupid? No, the majority
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.080]  of the American people oppose George Bush. I don't think they're stupid. Everybody knows
[02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:20.400]  everybody knows that people went to the Supreme Court, right there. The Supreme Court appointed
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.520]  George Bush in 2000. Okay. And I was neutral at that time. I'm certainly not for Al Gore.
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:32.200]  The point is, that's not true. And there was clear election fraud that was stolen in 2004.
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:37.880]  No doubting that. Continue with O'Reilly. People went to the polls in November, largely
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:42.120]  motivated by their opposition to this illegal war and opposition to George Bush. And if
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.920]  Congress will not respond to that, then we have an obligation to the people of the world
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:49.040]  and to the people of this country. Are we going to be the generation that's remembered
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:52.720]  as the people who sat back and allowed torture to be legalized? What exactly is your obligation
[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:57.800]  to shout down people like Rahm Emanuel? He's a liberal Democrat. Rahm Emanuel walked out
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:02.320]  of there. That was his choice to do. He has a platform all the time. That's beside the
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:10.160]  point. So you think you have an obligation to shout him down? Absolutely. We need to
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:15.400]  go everywhere these criminals are and expose them on the open borders, the Federal Reserve,
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:21.080]  the illegal war, anything and everything that's bad for this country and that's unconstitutional.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:25.240]  Absolutely. Declaration of Independence. When the government becomes destructive of those
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:31.880]  aims, it is our right and duty to overthrow it. Not just go protest it, you twit. Absolutely.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.880]  We need guerrilla information war to get around your psyops. You Pentagon employee, back to
[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:41.760]  it. Crimes of this administration to a halt. Okay, but that's not going to happen because
[02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:47.000]  most Americans don't know. It's not going to happen ever because they don't agree with
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.920]  you. They don't think you're correct. And if they did, then you would have millions
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:56.840]  of people. A war of aggression. By Nuremberg's standard. By Nuremberg's standard. There's
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:00.720]  no legitimate cause of self defense. That's a war of aggression. That's a war crime of
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:06.240]  the highest order. Let me just recap. Let me just recap. You believe that your group,
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:11.720]  as small as it is, has a right to shout down Congress. You're saying that torture should
[02:04:11.720 --> 02:04:16.560]  be allowed to go on just because George Bush and the Congress don't want to challenge it.
[02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:20.640]  I'm saying that's unconscionable, Bill. That's unconscionable. The country with a way that
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:26.880]  you portray it, you would be in Guantanamo, baby. 14,000 people. The country with a way
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:31.240]  you are portraying it, you'd be hanging up on a hook. For himself, the right to detain
[02:04:31.240 --> 02:04:35.800]  anybody without charges, without a lawyer, without even knowing what charges are against
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:39.960]  them. This is a cornerstone of the rule of law. According to you, all of our Congress
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:47.040]  people, all of our Congress people are corrupt. They're all corrupt. Most of them are. Notice
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:51.240]  he said she'd be hanging up on a meat hook. That's how they do things in the third world
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:55.880]  when our government funds all the big death squads. They are arresting people all over
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:04:59.600]  this country for their political views and what they say and do. They do have the Pentagon
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:09.400]  spying on peace groups. Just the incredible lie that they've got 15 members and the majority
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:21.200]  of Americans are pro-war and pro-bush. I mean, it's just, it's base. It's base. We'll talk
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:28.560]  to one of their damaged goods individuals on the other side. We'll talk to one of their
[02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:37.600]  minions. It's here after a year in production and traveling to distant lands. My new film
[02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:42.520]  Terror Storm is complete. Shocking, declassified government documents prove that Western governments
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:47.720]  are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:52.800]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in
[02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:57.000]  London were carried out by British intelligence. Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:03.120]  us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:08.200]  torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more. Terror Storm is the definitive
[02:06:08.200 --> 02:06:12.160]  guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism. It's an anthology of government
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:17.680]  crimes. Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see. Get

[02:07:32.600 --> 02:07:38.160]  in our body and want them out. For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time tested.
[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:42.560]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite. In our mind, there
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:46.640]  isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore. This basic tenet of yeast in the
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:50.760]  gut and metals in the liver covers at least 7-80% of the disease that we see. When we
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:54.280]  do our program, you know, in herpal form, it's like Cardivite, and you see someone who
[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:59.240]  could barely walk up a hill. Now, going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're
[02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:03.320]  doing something right. It's a well thought out formula. I mean, the idea of it working
[02:08:03.320 --> 02:08:08.120]  on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on. You'll find
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:12.240]  I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems. It'll
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:13.720]  work on other problems as well.

[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:36.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show because there's
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:47.800]  a war on for your mind.
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:54.720]  Main Town that makes it illegal to smoke in cars. U.S. sub collides with the Japanese
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:00.560]  ship. A lot's coming up. The person who got a Troy, Don, Wolf, Joe, Don, and many others.
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.680]  Speaking of the devil, let's go ahead and go to Troy from wherever he's calling in
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:09.400]  from. Troy, it's always nice to talk to you. Go ahead.
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:14.160]  West Virginia. When are you going to quit running your mouth to start actually doing
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:17.800]  something for real? You and your listeners. All you do is talk, talk, talk. We all going
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:21.200]  to start taking some action. What do you mean? You think you're going to defeat the likes
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:24.480]  of me? You're never going to defeat me.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.320]  And what is the likes of you? Please describe.
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:27.320]  Neocons.
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:28.320]  You're a neocon.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:29.320]  As far as I'm concerned, yeah.
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.320]  What do you stand for? Tell us, Troy.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:41.400]  I stand against everything you stand for, basically. How the opposite of you.
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.480]  So you stand against the Bill of Rights in America?
[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:48.720]  I don't stand one second in my life worrying about the Bill of Rights. I'm free to do what
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:50.600]  I want to do. I've said it before.
[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:55.880]  Yeah. Yeah, you're free to do what I want to do. Nothing's changed until you're a low-level
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:56.880]  peon.
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:01.320]  No, I'm not. Your listeners are the low-level peons. They're the ones that average $10,000
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:05.280]  a year income. When are you people going to start doing something?
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.840]  So you think it's good that... So the government doesn't take people's farms and ranches
[02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:13.080]  in scams. And if they do, they deserve it. That's what you're saying.
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:16.360]  I'm not saying anything of the sort. I'm just saying when are you people going to do something
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:18.840]  instead of running your own mouths?
[02:10:18.840 --> 02:10:20.160]  Well, we do a whole hell of a lot.
[02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:24.800]  Yeah, you make little goofy movies and you have your little symposiums with 80 people.
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:25.800]  What did he do?
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:30.640]  Well, if you want to really get technical, I had a symposium with 1,200 people and we
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.280]  had to turn away another 2,000 or so.
[02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:38.080]  Yeah, Jim Fetcher on the stage. I bought Terrorstorm, actually. I saw a little symposium
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:43.000]  at the end of it. Jim Fetcher, he's a real good one to have when your staff there, buddy.
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:44.000]  He's interesting, isn't he?
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  Yeah.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  Yeah.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000]  Well, you got...
[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.520]  How would you have Morgan Reynolds in your movie? You got it. It doesn't think planes...
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:56.360]  Hey, let me ask you a question. You're tuning into the show on a daily basis and calling
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.360]  into most of the other shows.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:00.040]  I've kind of laid off a bit.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.040]  How do you do that when you're at work?
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:06.040]  I've got a set of the desk.
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:09.440]  You set a desk listening to my show and every other show?
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:12.480]  Yeah, I'll listen to you and Jack Wood.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.600]  I heard you calling to a bunch of other shows.
[02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:17.040]  I wouldn't have been during the day.
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.480]  You called into my Sunday show two weeks ago and I said, is there a North American Union?
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:27.360]  Is Lou Dobbs a Cook? And you said there's no North American Union and Lou Dobbs is a Cook.
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:28.360]  This is Lou Dobbs.
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:29.360]  I just played Lou Dobbs.
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:30.360]  Hold on.
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:31.360]  Yeah, you did. Yes, you did.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:34.960]  Well, hold on just a second, Troy. Is there a North American Union?
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:35.960]  No.
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:39.160]  Put him on hold. Here's Lou Dobbs last night.
[02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:45.360]  Tonight, a proposal for an expanded so-called free trade zone from Alaska to the tip of
[02:11:45.360 --> 02:11:49.800]  South America. It's a plan from the business elites, the political elites that will cost
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:55.640]  more American jobs, cost American sovereignty, but it would fulfill the president's father's
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:56.640]  vision.
[02:11:56.640 --> 02:12:00.360]  Bill Tucker reports.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:04.400]  It's not a new idea. President Bush talks about it back in 1991.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:12.760]  It is a big idea, a new world order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common
[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.760]  cause.
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:17.960]  Now, a former United States trade investor, Robert Zolik, is talking about it again with
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:23.560]  renewed vigor. This time, a new world order with business at the helm of trade and economic
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:24.560]  policy.
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:25.560]  Okay.
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:30.760]  Now, we're having our laws harmonized. Our federal agencies merged. Our social security
[02:12:30.760 --> 02:12:38.360]  merged. Our government is working with the Mexican government to give satellite navigation
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:45.200]  systems to 200,000 illegals to cross. I talked to you two weeks ago, Troy, or whatever your
[02:12:45.200 --> 02:12:50.560]  name is, and you said that there wasn't a North American union. Are you still saying
[02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:51.560]  that?
[02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:55.760]  There's far longer to the right. And the thing is, if I'd never listened to you, I wouldn't
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:13:00.360]  even know what the North American union even meant. I could probably ask the next 50 people,
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:04.040]  if I go to the street and flag down the next 50 cars and ask them, you know what the North
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:06.360]  American union is, they'd have no idea what I mean.
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:11.400]  Well, I bet if you flagged 100 people, 100 of them wouldn't know what a comprehensive
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.560]  annual financial report is.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.560]  Probably not.
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:20.920]  I mean, I would doubt that maybe one out of 15 know what the theory of basic and the study
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:26.640]  of quantum mechanics is. Just because you don't know doesn't mean it's not important.
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:32.000]  Like, I bet you think I'm lying when I get up here on air and I say that every county
[02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:40.920]  city and water and every government institution runs giant surpluses in a second set of books.
[02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:47.960]  I don't disagree with everything you say. You could be good at what you do, but you just
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:50.000]  went off the deep end sometime in your life.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.440]  Oh, yeah, I went off the deep end.
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:54.680]  Well, yeah, I mean, I just, the whole 9-11 thing, anything you say up for that, I can't
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:55.680]  really believe too much.
[02:13:55.680 --> 02:14:01.440]  Well, let me ask you this, Troy. Do you think I'm making it up the Dyncorp and Halliburton
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:03.320]  run child kidnapping ranks?
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:05.400]  I don't believe that.
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:06.400]  No.
[02:14:06.400 --> 02:14:09.960]  Okay, how long do you think they would let me do that on air without suing me if it wasn't
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:10.960]  true?
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:16.040]  I mean, I'm on actual, you know, commercial AM and FM stations, a growing list of them.
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:22.120]  Okay, they let me get on national talk shows, okay, on 200, 300, 500 stations. They let me
[02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:29.680]  get on national TV, okay, because it's well known that I talk about real things, okay,
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:35.000]  and I back up what I'm talking about. And just because you haven't heard about it in
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.520]  your Hillbilly circles doesn't mean it doesn't exist, Troy.
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:42.520]  Okay.
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:46.720]  And I shouldn't knock Hillbillies. They're actually more wise than most people you run
[02:14:46.720 --> 02:14:51.200]  into, but you're certainly not a Hillbilly. You're kind of caught between a Hillbilly
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:56.120]  and a West Virginia city slacker, aren't you?
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:57.120]  Nope.
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:15:00.680]  I grew up in Charleston. I grew up in the city. I'm far from a Hillbilly.
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:03.440]  I'm trying to, well, you're a Hillbilly stock, aren't you?
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:04.440]  I'm what?
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:10.200]  I'm sorry. Listen, man, I'm just, I'm just nothing wrong with Hill people. I'm just
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:13.600]  teasing the old cliche. I need to play banjo, deliverance music.
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:21.920]  Hey, man, listen to me. I'm from Texas. I'm a Hillbilly.
[02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:22.920]  I was fine.
[02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:28.400]  That's fine with you. I mean, what is it specifically that I'm lying about here, Troy?
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:32.920]  I mean, did you just hear O'Reilly saying the world can't wait has 50 members?
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:37.400]  I thought he was talking about he had 50 members at that particular...
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:42.440]  No, he said your group's got 50 members. You're nothing. He knew exactly what he
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:47.320]  meant. He said the majority of Americans are for the war. Now, certainly, unless you're
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:52.040]  hiding under a rock somewhere, you know, Troy, the majority of Americans are against the
[02:15:52.040 --> 02:15:53.040]  war.
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:54.840]  Well, I agree with that.
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:59.960]  Okay. Well, then why was O'Reilly repeatedly saying they weren't?
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:06.040]  I didn't, I didn't catch that. I think you took the whole conversation out of context.
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:08.800]  Oh, 8% is talking about the far left loons.
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:11.120]  Oh, yeah, the far left loons.
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:12.120]  There's 8%.
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:16.600]  Well, thank God for them. I appreciate your call, Troy. Thank God that they're not like
[02:16:16.600 --> 02:16:20.720]  the mainline scumbag Democrats who were just, well, we need to go ahead and continue the
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:27.200]  war now. At least we're running it. Well, I like Hillary. I mean, give me a break.
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:33.400]  Why don't you just get past far left loon, far right loon, and just become an American.
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:37.360]  And you did say two weeks ago there's no North American union. You said it again today. And
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:42.920]  you're living in a dream world.
[02:16:42.920 --> 02:16:45.400]  Don in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.400]  How are you doing?
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:49.440]  Good, sir. What's on your mind?
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:54.640]  Well, one of the things I was thinking about is that they're constantly being referred
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:17:03.560]  to, you know, the powerful people as the elite. They're not an elite. That designation or
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.880]  semantics makes a lot of people feel like, well, they were superior.
[02:17:07.880 --> 02:17:13.440]  Well, no. I mean, if you say measured the size of detritus in a latrine as the bigger
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:16.120]  pieces being elite, there would be elite pieces in there.
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:21.920]  Well, the Palestinians, for instance, are in, you might say, a barbed wire concentration
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:22.920]  camp.
[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:28.240]  They really are. But they just weren't accepted and died because they're evil. The TV said
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:29.240]  so.
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:35.560]  The patriotic Americans are being herded into the idea of being if they're Anglo-Saxon,
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:41.960]  blonde-haired, blue-eyed, militia people. It's like they always talk about, they go
[02:17:41.960 --> 02:17:50.080]  out there and bomb the militias, the suspected militias, and suspected dissidents in the Arab
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:55.440]  countries. The American people feel like, well, this is wonderful. We don't mind murdering
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:56.440]  peaceful checkers.
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:18:00.840]  Well, actually, the American people are not for that. So you buy into O'Reilly, saying
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:01.840]  the majority...
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.080]  No, I don't buy any. I don't mean he's a disgusting creep.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:11.920]  Okay, well, let me stop you. What I'm saying is, sir, the majority do not. Okay? The majority
[02:18:11.920 --> 02:18:15.760]  don't want toll roads on existing roads. The majority don't want open borders. The majority
[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:19.520]  don't want the war. They set up on TV and say the majority does.
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:24.320]  Well, you might have to tell you how they do that. Extortion and fear is what makes a
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:29.720]  lot of people be fearful of even saying anything. It's like if you're in a big corporation
[02:18:29.720 --> 02:18:33.800]  or a big factory, you don't want to do any murmuring or any talking.
[02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:38.200]  Yeah, no, that's why companies fire people to talk about 9-11-minute inside job. Universities
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:44.240]  do that. They want to make an example. They're intimidating us. And if people like being served
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.880]  on a plantation, being intimidated and being run by a gang boss, then enjoy your slavery.
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:53.880]  Just don't say you're free. Don't say you're Americans. And don't festoon yourself with
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:54.880]  American flags.
[02:18:54.880 --> 02:19:03.440]  Well, the idea of the India caste system, or the English stratified community there,
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:08.720]  and they had that in Germany. They had that in Mexico. You're the upper crust, or you're
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:15.360]  the peon. It's done by fear and intimidation. And that's what's happening there. People
[02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:21.200]  are afraid to even speak out or think. And the last thing you want is any violence. No
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:26.120]  violence at all, because then that would be a trigger for them to come in and say, look,
[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:27.120]  these are all...
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:32.200]  No, no, I agree. No offense of violence. We should all defend ourselves. It's our God
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:36.160]  given right. But that's why they blow up buildings and stage events and then try to blame it
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:39.960]  on patriot groups, is because they want to make it a violent game. We need to expose
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:46.840]  them as the violent pieces of trash they are. We need to just say no to their system and
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:50.920]  literally put ourselves against the machinery. Let me tell you something, Don. I want you
[02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:56.520]  to know we're winning, okay? People are waking up in droves. The New World Order is in crisis.
[02:19:56.520 --> 02:19:59.440]  That's why they tried to put the Democrats in. And then now they've got them trying to
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:04.720]  sell us on staying in the war. That's not working. Everybody I know in the left is waking
[02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:09.720]  up and not being in the left anymore. They're out buying guns. They're out hating the New
[02:20:09.720 --> 02:20:14.680]  World Order. They're out getting it. I talked to the illegal aliens. You can even wake them
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:19.680]  up. The conservatives are waking up. There's still a hard core of them, though, that think
[02:20:19.680 --> 02:20:25.080]  gun control and open borders and world government is conservative. And it's not. We'll be right
[02:20:25.080 --> 02:20:30.880]  back. Stay with me.
[02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:35.360]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration
[02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:39.880]  bottle. Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating. Or Sport Berkey is small enough

[02:21:29.960 --> 02:21:35.280]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine. Did you know that at the 29-pound Marine base
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:40.640]  located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marine Station there? It discussed
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:46.640]  the United States military under UN command. Would the Marines accept this? The final statement
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:52.760]  to be answered yes or no was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist
[02:21:52.760 --> 02:21:57.960]  confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government. Is this what Americans
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:03.200]  want? Of course, confiscation of guns. We'd like to help you understand how these things

[02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:34.360]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt, but
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:39.360]  the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:46.960]  a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:51.520]  The U.S. economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:57.480]  called the Federal Reserve System. In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:01.960]  It's bad enough that the U.S. citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce. However,
[02:23:01.960 --> 02:23:06.200]  shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:10.760]  in a stock portfolio. Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard
