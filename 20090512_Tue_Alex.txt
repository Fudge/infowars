[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.280 --> 00:18.840]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.840 --> 00:43.960]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome thank you so much for
[00:43.960 --> 00:49.720]  joining us on this 12th day of May 2009 it is a Tuesday we're gonna be live
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.960]  here for the next four hours and I have swept the decks clean no guest today
[00:54.960 --> 01:01.160]  because I want to have wide open phones for the full four hours there is a lot
[01:01.160 --> 01:06.320]  to talk about there are a host of vitally important news stories that I
[01:06.320 --> 01:11.200]  want to go over the mainstream media has now picked up on the article that Kurt
[01:11.200 --> 01:18.360]  and Nemo did back on Saturday dealing with a new bill introduced that states
[01:18.360 --> 01:25.320]  if you're on the violent radicalization list that the attorney general will be
[01:25.320 --> 01:32.560]  able to ban you owning firearms without a conviction without an arrest without
[01:32.560 --> 01:37.000]  an indictment and without any evidence now remember they have a separate bill
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.080]  introduced where the attorney general can ban any firearm type he wishes it
[01:42.080 --> 01:47.920]  just gives him imperial godlike power and also they're saying that they have a
[01:47.920 --> 01:52.120]  new bill introduced where if you hurt someone's feelings the Feds decide if
[01:52.120 --> 01:56.240]  it's hurt someone's feelings it actually says hurt their feelings and that you
[01:56.240 --> 02:01.360]  will be indicted federally for your free speech I mean we need some master
[02:01.360 --> 02:04.560]  article written by Kurt Nemo or Paul Watson or Steve Watson or Aaron Dykes
[02:04.560 --> 02:08.240]  or one of our people that just goes through all of the insanity that's
[02:08.240 --> 02:14.320]  going on because any one of these issues is earth-shaking tyranny just red flag
[02:14.320 --> 02:19.080]  rogue government totally criminal totally illegitimate but when you put them
[02:19.080 --> 02:22.160]  all next to each other hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of these things
[02:22.160 --> 02:28.640]  that are going on it is just mind-blowing that all of this is actually going on
[02:28.640 --> 02:34.240]  and happening now remember White House chief of staff in fact guys chew that up
[02:34.240 --> 02:39.840]  it's actually in the Obama deception the bomb this option is like a chronicle of
[02:39.840 --> 02:43.120]  their entire agenda and what they're going to do and you know this thing was
[02:43.120 --> 02:46.440]  literally just released two months ago a month and a half ago and people are
[02:46.440 --> 02:51.120]  seeing going this thing is like totally up to date and pertinent because they
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.680]  have expanded the agenda we expose in the film so it's people who watch it say
[02:55.680 --> 02:59.200]  it's like watching the nightly news but with analysis because we say this is
[02:59.200 --> 03:01.720]  what they're gonna do and now they've done everything we said they would do I
[03:01.720 --> 03:05.800]  mean it's just devastating because people go wait a minute they just laid out
[03:05.800 --> 03:10.120]  this whole plan look I'm saying how are you criticizing him he's only been in
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.160]  office a month when you release this film we know all his advisors we know
[03:15.160 --> 03:19.120]  what he said his policies would be we had all the statements and we had this
[03:19.120 --> 03:22.800]  film we were working on this film to you know until a week or so before it was
[03:22.800 --> 03:27.520]  released and so it has just all the latest update stuff I don't know I'm
[03:27.520 --> 03:31.320]  already going off ranting about it it's just they are moving against the
[03:31.320 --> 03:34.920]  Republic they are engaged in high treason in every level the Republicans
[03:34.920 --> 03:39.720]  are just as much involved as the Democrats and the enemy is coming in like
[03:39.720 --> 03:44.080]  a flood against the Republic right now but you know Curt Nimmel wrote a great
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.880]  story about this when he was sent the bill by a listener you know where the
[03:48.880 --> 03:54.160]  folks that are linking to the bill that where they save you makes somebody feel
[03:54.160 --> 03:58.200]  bad hurt their feelings you're gonna be federally charged with the felony and
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.520]  then it gets picked up all the rest of the media that's the power of this show
[04:02.520 --> 04:07.680]  is the listeners who are activist it's a huge audience and you're active and so
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.320]  we can push into kind of the libertarian or right-wing or liberal media and then
[04:14.320 --> 04:18.640]  into the mainstream media anything we want now and that is what's exciting
[04:18.640 --> 04:22.400]  we're kind of like the front line watch dogs here ladies and gentlemen yipping
[04:22.400 --> 04:27.960]  and yapping and then waking up some of the bigger dogs and it's just amazing
[04:27.960 --> 04:32.320]  to see all this going on but ladies and gentlemen ladies and gentlemen the
[04:32.320 --> 04:37.280]  establishment is moving like never before seen against all of our freedoms
[04:37.280 --> 04:41.560]  and it's all coming up today also new torture photos being released by Obama
[04:41.560 --> 04:48.280]  what's really behind that a gag order on any brass in the military speaking to
[04:48.280 --> 04:53.160]  Congress that is totally unconstitutional violation of the separation of
[04:53.160 --> 04:58.160]  powers scientists want to have vaccine corn to force you to take the flu shot
[04:58.160 --> 05:01.320]  it's all coming up

[05:11.520 --> 05:16.400]  flu but unfortunately the mass media is overstating and embellishing the facts

[08:06.440 --> 08:30.520]  network
[08:30.520 --> 08:37.920]  okay in the first five minutes of the show I said no guest today but things are
[08:37.920 --> 08:47.080]  fluid here and change Joyce Riley a long-time Genesis host here on the
[08:47.080 --> 08:57.400]  network she had a lady call into her show with the police raiding her house
[08:57.400 --> 09:02.480]  even though she owned the property and then it would happen right as Joyce was
[09:02.480 --> 09:11.000]  going off the air so Joyce stayed on the line with the network she's in outside
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.080]  for sales Missouri but the networks in Minnesota so the lady stayed on the line
[09:15.080 --> 09:19.520]  at Genesis as the police kicked down the door as they came in and as they hung
[09:19.520 --> 09:25.000]  up the phone and I'm told this is a pretty shocking audio it has never
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.680]  before been heard and when I I get ready at home and I show up about 20 minutes
[09:30.680 --> 09:35.920]  before airtime generally here and when I came in they ran up to me the producer
[09:35.920 --> 09:38.920]  so we've been trying to call you this whole thing happened about 40 minutes
[09:38.920 --> 09:44.680]  ago and I just said get me more facts get me more details so we're gonna do
[09:44.680 --> 09:48.080]  that either at the bottom of the hour next hour only so I can talk to Joyce and
[09:48.080 --> 09:52.680]  find out or talk to John because some of this was on air and find out what's
[09:52.680 --> 10:05.280]  going on so that I can assess what's happening from my perspective so I can
[10:05.280 --> 10:13.840]  talk about this from my perspective and so I can gauge it so we'll talk to Joyce
[10:13.840 --> 10:19.720]  and we appreciate her calling us this information all over the nation this has
[10:19.720 --> 10:27.600]  been going on for two years as repossessions accelerate people are
[10:27.600 --> 10:35.200]  now becoming homeless in massive numbers I'm now seeing clean-cut families
[10:35.200 --> 10:41.880]  on the streets of Austin and if you if they go to the shelters the CPS is there
[10:41.880 --> 10:49.040]  and in almost every case takes your children so if you become homeless they
[10:49.040 --> 10:55.640]  will take your children and then now all over the country cities and states New
[10:55.640 --> 10:59.480]  York California other places are announcing rent for homeless they are
[10:59.480 --> 11:03.480]  arresting homeless you can't sleep in an alley you can't sleep on a park bench
[11:03.480 --> 11:08.480]  you can't sleep in a tent on government land in a state park out of the way they
[11:08.480 --> 11:14.960]  come and arrest you and they take you to a FEMA paid for facility Hawaii
[11:14.960 --> 11:20.120]  California New York and then they charge you rent and they say oh no you're not
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.880]  forced labor we're just charging you rent so you have to work so all of this
[11:24.880 --> 11:27.800]  is being announced as I told you it would be this is how they did it in
[11:27.800 --> 11:31.400]  Germany and Russia and China it's always the same
[11:31.400 --> 11:35.440]  I remember Michael Savage four or five years ago going arrest anyone that
[11:35.440 --> 11:39.400]  disagrees with the war because when you protest the war you're a terrorist
[11:39.400 --> 11:44.040]  because you're aiding terrorist and then I remember seeing the deputy attorney
[11:44.040 --> 11:49.520]  general of California in the Oakland Tribune saying the same thing we're
[11:49.520 --> 11:55.000]  banning protest in California against the wars was in 2004 one year into it and
[11:55.000 --> 11:59.200]  we're now six plus years into it because they're fighting al-Qaeda in Iraq and
[11:59.200 --> 12:03.920]  when you protest the war you're with al-Qaeda and then he and then Savage
[12:03.920 --> 12:07.720]  pushed for the sedition act and said arrest anybody and then now notice
[12:07.720 --> 12:10.920]  Savage is banned from England and they're arresting people in England that
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.720]  criticize the open borders see this is how it works folks the left takes the
[12:15.720 --> 12:20.560]  right's right's away and the right takes the left's away in between that
[12:20.560 --> 12:27.640]  everybody is slaves and the globalist control the left and the right but I'm
[12:27.640 --> 12:30.880]  digressing ladies and gentlemen I'm literally at information overload these
[12:30.880 --> 12:36.400]  days you know I promised open the show up and take your calls Randall
[12:36.400 --> 12:44.600]  Wilson Mike Josh George others and I'm gonna do just that I've been getting a
[12:44.600 --> 12:48.000]  lot of emails and so is Jason Bermas who does a show nine to midnight here out
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.400]  of the info or studios on Genesis saying we're liars about the military and
[12:56.400 --> 13:04.840]  military contractors raping children under orders so today I've been saying
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.760]  the last few shows I do this and I've just run out of time today coming up
[13:08.760 --> 13:13.760]  later in the next hour I'm gonna do a news report on this I'm gonna play
[13:13.760 --> 13:18.400]  congressional hearings where Rumsfeld doesn't deny that Dinecore and Halle
[13:18.400 --> 13:28.160]  Burton kidnapped children in mass and I am gonna go over salon New Yorker
[13:28.160 --> 13:35.920]  magazine ABC news with the Army's own report about how the CIA ordered the
[13:35.920 --> 13:39.560]  jail guards and of course they profiled them they hired them federal guards that
[13:39.560 --> 13:46.520]  lost their jobs for raping people and abuse in prisons sickos you know Jeffrey
[13:46.520 --> 13:49.600]  Dahmer's that are smart enough to not just grab kids off the street they're
[13:49.600 --> 13:52.720]  smart enough to get a badge they're smart enough to get a uniform you know
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.760]  smart psychopaths you take basic psychology they'll teach you the
[13:56.760 --> 14:01.320]  intelligence psychopaths those that have a higher IQ and are more controlled
[14:01.320 --> 14:05.920]  I guess the term is controlled psychopath they they want power they want a
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.240]  badge they want a gun and they get them and they take over almost every nation
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.920]  and that's why the world is in slavery and darkness and pain because good
[14:14.920 --> 14:23.040]  people lie on their fat butts and let psychos take over is it because good
[14:23.040 --> 14:28.200]  people are cowards is it because we're domesticated we're lulled asleep we're
[14:28.200 --> 14:31.880]  taught to lay down and take it I don't know what it is but I'm not laying down
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.600]  and taking any of it from this dirtbag rogue illegitimate government I'm
[14:36.600 --> 14:41.880]  done and I don't care what the media says about me I don't care what they make
[14:41.880 --> 14:46.960]  up about me you know if they if somebody we hire infiltrates us and tries to set
[14:46.960 --> 14:51.040]  us up criminally that's on their heart and their soul I didn't do anything wrong
[14:51.040 --> 14:55.680]  you're a bunch of criminals the government is criminal it is illegitimate
[14:55.680 --> 15:01.440]  period their crimes are so horrible I can't even begin to try to explain it
[15:01.440 --> 15:06.640]  and I'm just sick of the public large segments of it that have woken up the
[15:06.640 --> 15:11.120]  government's line and corrupt but they buy into all the co-intelpro bull to
[15:11.120 --> 15:16.080]  attack me that I'm a Scientologist or I work for the Vatican or I work for Israel
[15:16.080 --> 15:18.560]  and you know and then they'll mix all the lies together which are just
[15:18.560 --> 15:25.680]  ridiculous instead of ever responding about real issues and spending time
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.480]  warning people about vaccines or open borders in the new world or agenda or
[15:29.480 --> 15:34.000]  brain scanners going in airports or how the public schools have been turned into
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.280]  brainwashing camps or how the CPS is I mean you know on the issue of children
[15:38.280 --> 15:45.920]  being abused by the state it's come out and it's even been in CNN that 4,000
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.240]  plus children come up missing every year that are in government custody in
[15:50.240 --> 15:53.800]  Florida alone and they find them in Saudi Arabia and they find them in other
[15:53.800 --> 15:58.160]  nations and they find them in slave brothels and they find them dead and then
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.480]  it turns out that every major director of the CPS in Florida turns out to be a
[16:01.480 --> 16:05.560]  convicted pedophile well of course it's a pedophile guild who do you think the
[16:05.560 --> 16:09.280]  globalist hire to go out and kidnap Christian mainly that's who they
[16:09.280 --> 16:16.640]  target children and then ship them to slave camps remember world net daily
[16:16.640 --> 16:22.840]  reporting on slave cruise lines where they have prostitutes and slave children
[16:22.840 --> 16:26.760]  on them and Bill Clinton administration people being on them you can't make this
[16:26.760 --> 16:31.920]  stuff up I mean every time I read this stuff I can't believe when I'm even
[16:31.920 --> 16:35.080]  reading then I have congressional testimony on and I can't believe it and
[16:35.080 --> 16:38.400]  I can't believe these people just sit up there with straight faces these are
[16:38.400 --> 16:45.720]  killers ladies and gentlemen they it's a religion to feed on us and abuses but you
[16:45.720 --> 16:54.680]  take the Texas Youth Commission and you know it comes out that every major
[16:54.680 --> 17:00.160]  juvenile justice facility including the CPS facilities it's the same in Michigan
[17:00.160 --> 17:03.240]  California Florida I mean you see it everywhere the same story it's all
[17:03.240 --> 17:06.720]  federally run all federally financed all federal guidelines where they've
[17:06.720 --> 17:10.640]  stole they still so many children folks they warehousing and make little you
[17:10.640 --> 17:18.440]  know two you know year-old babies live in drawers at at at CPS bureaucratic
[17:18.440 --> 17:22.080]  facilities would snot all over them you know they die and they just take a
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.000]  little dead bodies and you know so all the parents you know did this to them
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.120]  even though they had the kid for two weeks you know when the facility not
[17:29.120 --> 17:32.400]  even feeding them and they die then they go indict the parents after they kill
[17:32.400 --> 17:39.920]  them and it turned out the Texas Youth Commission in mass was openly raping
[17:39.920 --> 17:43.880]  children and video taping it and and that the parking lots were filled with
[17:43.880 --> 17:48.560]  judges and police and local pedophile rings that run most cities literally
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.120]  that it's a pedophile guild that runs everything people talk about it's this
[17:52.120 --> 17:54.720]  group it's that group I'll tell you it's a bunch of devil worship and pedophiles
[17:54.720 --> 17:59.640]  you want to know who runs things that's who runs things you know devil
[17:59.640 --> 18:03.360]  worshipers they like to sacrifice kids what is that the ultimate expression of
[18:03.360 --> 18:08.240]  attacking innocence of being ruthless of trying to burn out their souls trying
[18:08.240 --> 18:20.240]  to prove how ruthless they are and then I saw it in the news that they don't
[18:20.240 --> 18:29.800]  even mention the fact that they've set up a new state agency for child
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.720]  welfare and that they supposedly set it up to counter what was going on in the
[18:34.720 --> 18:39.600]  state already but then they took all the new funding of the legislature just
[18:39.600 --> 18:42.800]  funded and they're saying they're going to put out task forces to steal more
[18:42.800 --> 18:47.080]  innocent people's children see that's back when CNN was reporting on that in
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.360]  Florida I said you watch folks they're gonna come out and say we need more
[18:51.360 --> 18:55.720]  funding to stop what's happening with the abuse of children that cover my hands
[18:55.720 --> 19:02.000]  and that's what they did and then I had that article here in my stack oh it
[19:02.000 --> 19:06.960]  doesn't matter it's all over Texas news about guys just just you do do a search
[19:06.960 --> 19:11.640]  on me about new state agency for child welfare in Texas just give me that I
[19:11.640 --> 19:17.200]  had it here in the stack and now it's not here so I wanted it nothing about why
[19:17.200 --> 19:21.080]  they set up the agency nothing about the Texas Youth Commission and all the
[19:21.080 --> 19:25.480]  horrible things it did it's all about how American and in Texas parents are
[19:25.480 --> 19:29.360]  bad and the state's got to go out and grab their children when the states five
[19:29.360 --> 19:32.800]  times more likely in the Justice Department's own numbers to abuse
[19:32.800 --> 19:40.160]  children than any other group again the state is evil the state is corrupt the
[19:40.160 --> 19:46.080]  state has been fully taken over by criminals and degenerate scum at the
[19:46.080 --> 19:49.200]  higher levels and now they're taking over the mid and low levels and getting
[19:49.200 --> 19:53.440]  all their people in place and telling us torture and secret arrest is good to

[21:19.120 --> 21:23.800]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since
[21:23.800 --> 21:28.280]  day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[21:28.280 --> 21:32.960]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[21:32.960 --> 21:38.240]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascist it's not about left or right

[23:02.680 --> 23:06.840]  update GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants
[23:06.840 --> 23:10.080]  flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's so effective at producing
[23:10.080 --> 23:13.560]  rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy
[23:13.560 --> 23:17.160]  under practically any soil and like conditions now here's the best part for
[23:17.160 --> 23:20.440]  our listeners who garden for self-reliance proto grows unique blend of
[23:20.440 --> 23:24.240]  sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set
[23:24.240 --> 23:28.000]  creating maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works by providing
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.160]  geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for
[23:31.160 --> 23:34.520]  nutritional uptake in plants proto grows full spectrum plant fertility means
[23:34.520 --> 23:37.320]  fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the

[24:00.720 --> 24:28.360]  by the way a bunch of YouTube channels and I mean a bunch of them got shut down
[24:28.360 --> 24:37.120]  yesterday and I even talked to some of the we are change folks and they had one
[24:37.120 --> 24:39.840]  shut down and they don't even give them a copyright violation they just
[24:39.840 --> 24:45.400]  basically say no Alex Jones so now the YouTube situation has turned into open
[24:45.400 --> 24:50.120]  censorship and open season because they've figured out in the establishment
[24:50.120 --> 24:54.880]  we are reaching millions and millions of people a week on YouTube alone that is
[24:54.880 --> 24:59.280]  coming up and Google announced yesterday we've confirmed this first they hid
[24:59.280 --> 25:03.760]  Google video first they took down all our videos as number one every time we
[25:03.760 --> 25:07.640]  were always number one one of our videos you know was always you know in the top
[25:07.640 --> 25:12.280]  five but routinely number one they would take those down they would just freeze
[25:12.280 --> 25:15.760]  them till they dropped out of the top 100 or they would erase them and then
[25:15.760 --> 25:19.480]  never even give us a notice they owe it's a mistake it was always our videos
[25:19.480 --> 25:24.680]  and now Google video has just announced oh there's no longer going to be any
[25:24.680 --> 25:31.360]  uploading to Google video a hugely popular function we're suspending
[25:31.360 --> 25:42.400]  everyone who has Google video accounts you no longer can use them so we're
[25:42.400 --> 25:46.240]  going to get into that later in the show new torture photos being released by
[25:46.240 --> 25:50.840]  Obama they're going to release the lighter ones that's what happened last
[25:50.840 --> 25:53.560]  time this is being done as a political stunt they're continuing the torture
[25:53.560 --> 25:57.240]  continuing the secret arrest continuing no right for detainees this is a
[25:57.240 --> 26:03.160]  political stunt to further politicize things and hurt the Republican Party
[26:03.160 --> 26:07.160]  itself so the Democrats can even bigger supermajority and further destroy
[26:07.160 --> 26:11.520]  separation of powers speaking of separation of powers heritage foundation
[26:11.520 --> 26:16.200]  reporting shows the Associated Press Defense Department gag order on all
[26:16.200 --> 26:21.600]  brass not allowed to talk to the press and not allowed to talk to Congress the
[26:21.600 --> 26:27.600]  secretary Gates Robert Gates has made them by the way you can't underlaw
[26:27.600 --> 26:36.360]  compel anybody in the military to you know wave their rights if something
[26:36.360 --> 26:41.200]  isn't classified to the media or there to the public and you certainly can't
[26:41.200 --> 26:45.800]  even from talking to Congress even in classified meetings so first they tell
[26:45.800 --> 26:53.040]  Congress PDD 51 on the cover page the accompanying executive order states the
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.960]  president now runs all national security emergencies Congress has no oversight
[26:56.960 --> 27:04.200]  and no involvement and has no say in anything here in the future and members
[27:04.200 --> 27:07.520]  of Congress came out and said this is martial law and they had the Homeland
[27:07.520 --> 27:10.320]  Security Committee after different members of his committee for months
[27:10.320 --> 27:15.280]  tried to get it came out and said this is unbelievable Congress is co-equal to
[27:15.280 --> 27:18.680]  the president we have the high security clearance we need to see all of PDD 51
[27:18.680 --> 27:22.440]  but this executive order and the accompanying presidential decision
[27:22.440 --> 27:26.760]  directive states on the cover page that he's basically a dictator for any
[27:26.760 --> 27:31.280]  financial emergency any other emergency Congress the governors you know the John
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.400]  Warren defense authorization act dovetails with that this looks like
[27:35.400 --> 27:43.760]  martial law and they said hey sit down shut up we run things now well now
[27:43.760 --> 27:49.040]  Congress five congressmen this just broke over the weekend five different
[27:49.040 --> 27:52.720]  congressmen have gone public including Republicans like three of the five
[27:52.720 --> 27:57.800]  Republicans saying you can't put a gag order on all brass in fact they always
[27:57.800 --> 28:01.240]  have to swear to tell the whole true nothing about the truth and of course
[28:01.240 --> 28:06.160]  the Pentagon's a giant stealing cash machine of around a trillion and a half
[28:06.160 --> 28:11.320]  dollars a year not counting black budget that's another 800 billion so we're
[28:11.320 --> 28:16.480]  talking two plus trillion will that be two trillion three hundred billion and
[28:16.480 --> 28:20.320]  growing not counting all the cocaine and heroin money another 400 billion a
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.080]  year they're making and you know the generals are a revolving door with a
[28:25.080 --> 28:30.040]  multinational defense contractors Halliburton gets $15 million for blue
[28:30.040 --> 28:39.000]  tarps they put up a one blue tarp 15 million it's just incredible and so
[28:39.000 --> 28:46.320]  they're saying that now Congress can't talk to the brass this government is so
[28:46.320 --> 28:52.000]  rogue so criminal so evil and they're telling Congress sit down and shut up
[28:52.000 --> 28:57.560]  or it'll all come out who your mistresses and hookers are it'll all come out
[28:57.560 --> 29:02.320]  when you were 35 36 37 years old you know when you were the mayor or whatever
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.840]  that you did a B and C you know that's why they admit the Pentagon's given out
[29:06.840 --> 29:10.960]  over 70 billion dollars last time I checked to privates and captains and
[29:10.960 --> 29:14.720]  sergeants you know they give kernels over a million a year on the side and
[29:14.720 --> 29:18.120]  they say what's this for in these big pallets of cash they said it's just for
[29:18.120 --> 29:21.440]  doing a good job but later they come back to them and go now listen you took
[29:21.440 --> 29:27.840]  the money too now you mark down that missile system was used in combat you

[34:22.400 --> 34:27.240]  seeing the reports and reading in the different journals mainline fraud
[34:27.240 --> 34:34.120]  journals that report on fraud with mortgage companies coming in when
[34:34.120 --> 34:38.840]  houses are paid in full generally they target lower middle class or blue collar
[34:38.840 --> 34:43.400]  people or elderly and they take their land in fact we found out about a city
[34:43.400 --> 34:47.840]  scam just giving you some background so this is in context when I first got on
[34:47.840 --> 34:52.160]  the air in 1995 this is the type of issues I did video reports on and a lot
[34:52.160 --> 34:58.880]  of those are online now today have been recently re-uploaded to the web to the
[34:58.880 --> 35:05.600]  different video channels and at first we were wondering why is it always an old
[35:05.600 --> 35:13.240]  man or woman after they have surgery in the hospital suddenly they have their
[35:13.240 --> 35:19.640]  house taken and it was Roland Ellingston and all these other old people then it
[35:19.640 --> 35:23.800]  happened to my grandparents my grandfather had had a heart attack and
[35:23.800 --> 35:27.000]  suddenly they were saying there was a creek behind their house that wasn't
[35:27.000 --> 35:31.760]  even their property but that they had to clean out the fallen limbs from that
[35:31.760 --> 35:37.080]  come down the creek that weren't theirs or it was $2,000 a day fines and in just
[35:37.080 --> 35:46.360]  a week or two it was over $14,000 and I then discovered a pattern that all these
[35:46.360 --> 35:50.080]  people have been in a city hospital and that they have health department
[35:50.080 --> 35:53.960]  computers by law that they were putting their data into and the nurses didn't
[35:53.960 --> 35:58.200]  know that was then being shared out to a corrupt unit within the police force
[35:58.200 --> 36:02.880]  that is willing to go up and arrest old people off their front porches now
[36:02.880 --> 36:08.640]  Roland Ellingston veteran a retired arborist he lived on West 37th Street
[36:08.640 --> 36:12.800]  where those little three bedroom houses were going for half million bucks if
[36:12.800 --> 36:16.920]  they were broken down a million bucks if they were nice he owned two houses side
[36:16.920 --> 36:23.800]  by side on 37th Street he had colon cancer surgery was down to look like a
[36:23.800 --> 36:27.520]  concentration camp victim they were giving him $2,000 a day fines for three
[36:27.520 --> 36:31.920]  inch grass someone out and show the three inch grass and then went and I
[36:31.920 --> 36:38.000]  showed the health department that had three-foot grass and it got picked up
[36:38.000 --> 36:41.120]  by the Austin American statesman it was a big news story I went to the city
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.280]  council people's houses and showed they had taller grass that was my first
[36:46.280 --> 36:51.880]  experience getting death threats and pulling out of my house and having cops
[36:51.880 --> 36:56.440]  pull me over pulling out of my apartments and again most the cops were
[36:56.440 --> 37:00.320]  involved these are criminal units they have within this is mafia the local
[37:00.320 --> 37:04.000]  judges here as you've now seen around the country get paid bounties for how
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  many kids they put in the juvenile justice centers it's totally illegal on
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.640]  the face of it I mean you're late to class three times they charge you with
[37:10.640 --> 37:15.040]  truancy and then they make you waive your rights and sign on probation next
[37:15.040 --> 37:18.080]  time you're in some even a violation it's not even truancy you go to jail
[37:18.080 --> 37:21.360]  because they're getting federal money for all the prisoners they've got they've
[37:21.360 --> 37:25.240]  got private juvie halls and others that then pay kickbacks and open political
[37:25.240 --> 37:31.760]  contributions I mean it's just mob boss hog everything now I have confirmed and
[37:31.760 --> 37:36.760]  it's been all over the news I'm sure you've seen it yourselves where here's
[37:36.760 --> 37:46.040]  an example I had $150,000 was like $145,000 mortgage on a house and they
[37:46.040 --> 37:49.240]  kept selling my mortgage and Bank of America bought it I think the fourth
[37:49.240 --> 37:53.880]  time it got sold and suddenly they were suing to take my house and I went and
[37:53.880 --> 37:56.760]  said look the money was paid to escrow the property taxes paid and they
[37:56.760 --> 38:02.680]  started the suit to do it and we had to counter sue them to stop it and I had to
[38:02.680 --> 38:07.120]  go out and get a real estate lawyer and Bank of America was going to take the
[38:07.120 --> 38:12.360]  house folks and then did I fire foul counterclaims no I don't have the
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.400]  lawyers were telling me $50,000 $60,000 to go win a case and the courts are so
[38:16.400 --> 38:22.720]  corrupt I might have gotten lawyers fees back for it I'm about to go to Joyce
[38:22.720 --> 38:28.120]  Riley who has a talk show what 7 to 10 in the morning here on Genesis as well
[38:28.120 --> 38:34.680]  one of the longest running shows here on Genesis and so this is all going on
[38:34.680 --> 38:38.440]  everywhere and a lot of good sheriffs have said look we can't repossess whole
[38:38.440 --> 38:43.240]  neighborhoods we've put a hold on this they're getting sued but the issue is
[38:43.240 --> 38:47.960]  that's that that's one thing another is everywhere where we're mainly seeing
[38:47.960 --> 38:52.280]  small farms small ranches homes that are paid off generally old people after
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.600]  they've had a heart attack or something that's the MO I've seen in Austin and
[38:55.600 --> 38:59.760]  around the country then the police come and a lot of times they're on the payroll
[38:59.760 --> 39:03.160]  they themselves move into your house I mean it's now mainstream news I've seen
[39:03.160 --> 39:06.640]  it CNN and everywhere that in all these Texas towns and they list them they
[39:06.640 --> 39:09.880]  literally pull over old women and take their earrings their wedding rings and
[39:09.880 --> 39:13.160]  the cash out of their purse and tell them get out of this town or I'm gonna
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.640]  kill you that's how America operates now I mean what you boss hog is an angel
[39:18.640 --> 39:23.360]  Illinois it's in mainstream news that in Chicago and everywhere they just pull
[39:23.360 --> 39:27.520]  you over they like your car they just take it it was on NPR nationally Dallas
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.440]  morning news that the police pulled over thousands of nice cars through bags of
[39:31.440 --> 39:35.320]  chalk in took people to jail and said you're going to prison that was cocaine
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.320]  unless you sign over your house and car to us now that's some background here's
[39:41.320 --> 39:45.560]  Joyce Riley with what happened today at the end of her show this lady called in
[39:45.560 --> 39:51.040]  they confirmed the lady's name where she is in Missouri and that the ladies in
[39:51.040 --> 39:55.440]  jail now and then they had to go off air the show was over there were other shows
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.080]  program there's no way with other shows like Derry Brownfield coming up that
[40:00.080 --> 40:03.480]  they could you know keep going that's why I have it set on overdrives right and
[40:03.480 --> 40:07.520]  go internet only if I need to and so Joyce continued to record folks were
[40:07.520 --> 40:10.760]  chomping at the bit to hear what happened so she kept the lady online when
[40:10.760 --> 40:14.640]  her live show ended at 10 a.m. central standard time and you're about to hear
[40:14.640 --> 40:18.040]  that but to but to set the table I know Joyce because I'd listen some days I'm
[40:18.040 --> 40:24.640]  driving into work here on the local station Joyce is really been on top the
[40:24.640 --> 40:27.520]  fraud and how they're taking people's houses but I want to explain something to
[40:27.520 --> 40:32.920]  you they tried to take my little three bedroom house three years ago four years
[40:32.920 --> 40:39.400]  ago it was about 2004 five years ago man time's flying Joyce Riley it's getting
[40:39.400 --> 40:46.000]  worse and worse now though it's it's it's just amazing what's going on Joyce
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.960]  gonna have you here with us I'll tell you it is so important it is
[40:49.960 --> 40:54.560]  unbelievably important that we have the opportunity and the ability through
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.080]  Genesis to be able to tell this message and I really appreciate your coming on
[40:59.080 --> 41:03.600]  the air allowing me to come on today because of this story it needs to be
[41:03.600 --> 41:07.800]  told and it needs to be heard what just happened this lady I've been following
[41:07.800 --> 41:12.600]  her for several months and she has been trying to save her home her job went off
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.480]  to China you know the whole story I don't need to tell everybody that but her
[41:16.480 --> 41:19.840]  daughter lost her home so she brought her daughter and her grandchildren into
[41:19.840 --> 41:25.640]  her home was paying for food and got behind on her mortgage payments she is
[41:25.640 --> 41:29.720]  desperately wanting to save her home that's all she's got well they've been
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.400]  threatening her to take the home and she found out that her original note had
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.040]  been paid as full when she wrote to them and asked them do I you know do I owe
[41:38.040 --> 41:41.280]  anything and they said it is paid in full your mortgage is paid in full let me
[41:41.280 --> 41:47.520]  stop you I was listening to XM to a financial show mainstream syndicated
[41:47.520 --> 41:50.760]  show and they had an expert on saying that these mortgage companies I forgot
[41:50.760 --> 41:54.000]  because I hadn't heard the story yet Joyce are running scams so there's so
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.040]  many I can't cover them all on it that that they sell them and not just what
[41:58.040 --> 42:02.400]  Bank of America tried with me that they then keep they tell you it's paid when
[42:02.400 --> 42:05.880]  there's only one or two payments left they let that build up and then don't
[42:05.880 --> 42:09.360]  notify you and take your house go ahead is that what I was so criminal so
[42:09.360 --> 42:14.920]  criminal well in this situation that mortgage was sold and the new mortgage
[42:14.920 --> 42:20.040]  company was not a lean holder on it there was no equity interest so they
[42:20.040 --> 42:25.840]  had nothing no really dog in this game so there was no equity interest from that
[42:25.840 --> 42:29.000]  mortgage company but they were going to take her home so she called the
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.080]  attention to the judge that there was no equity interest on the lean so as a
[42:33.080 --> 42:36.840]  result of that she's been fighting it for months now she went to court she
[42:36.840 --> 42:40.080]  stood up to the judge and said you don't have jurisdiction over this and
[42:40.080 --> 42:45.320]  lo and behold they sent her a message through her neighbors telling her
[42:45.320 --> 42:49.640]  neighbors they didn't want to be at home today at 9 o'clock they warned the
[42:49.640 --> 42:53.760]  neighbors to stay away that they were going to take her into jail for trespassing
[42:53.760 --> 42:57.320]  on her own property basically let me stop you we're gonna tell the rest of
[42:57.320 --> 43:03.000]  story but I've got to add this the new London Connecticut case kilo a new
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.120]  London case this is on record folks and we had all the experts on and we had the
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.960]  witnesses on it was even in the Wall Street Journal and we had the family
[43:11.960 --> 43:19.520]  gore seafood from South Texas same thing happened to them they don't just take
[43:19.520 --> 43:23.840]  your property for private interest now these homes were paid for generational
[43:23.840 --> 43:30.280]  homes there on the water nice homes they said we're not going to pay you for
[43:30.280 --> 43:34.240]  your homes we're condemning them and if you fight us we're then going to charge
[43:34.240 --> 43:39.160]  you interest and rent for the years you've been fighting us and they took
[43:39.160 --> 43:45.040]  the homes and then charge them hundreds of thousands of dollars for taking
[43:45.040 --> 43:49.480]  their homes go ahead Joyce so I mean they will find a reason to take your
[43:49.480 --> 43:52.200]  property I was just talking to Derry Brownfield a few minutes ago if you
[43:52.200 --> 43:56.200]  don't go along with NAIS if you don't go along with whatever they will find a
[43:56.200 --> 44:01.560]  way to take your home well as a result at 9 a.m. this morning we had her on the
[44:01.560 --> 44:06.040]  phone we had her on the phone at from about 8 o'clock on and I'm talking
[44:06.040 --> 44:09.880]  about Don Welch from Hillsborough, Missouri which is over by St. Louis we
[44:09.880 --> 44:13.320]  had her on the line for a full hour she started telling us well they're
[44:13.320 --> 44:17.560]  driving up now there's an ambulance that drove up there's a Humvee that drove up
[44:17.560 --> 44:21.160]  there's nine police cars out there the Sheriff's Department is there the
[44:21.160 --> 44:24.760]  police officers there and she walked us through this as it started to happen
[44:24.760 --> 44:29.080]  okay so she knew they were coming so she so she called you and then right as the
[44:29.080 --> 44:33.640]  show ends they hit continue spell out her name as best you know it's we get an
[44:33.640 --> 44:38.240]  article up on info wars.com prisonplanet.com about this Joyce okay it's
[44:38.240 --> 44:45.440]  Don Welch D-A-W-N-W-E-L-C-H from Hillsborough, Missouri she was filming
[44:45.440 --> 44:49.440]  it with the video she had people on the outside filming this and documenting it
[44:49.440 --> 44:54.200]  so there is film of what happened the police went around to the back door
[44:54.200 --> 45:00.920]  right at about 10 30 this morning now we went off the air and John from Genesis
[45:00.920 --> 45:05.080]  and Ted were kind enough to allow us to continue recording there at Genesis so
[45:05.080 --> 45:09.440]  we've got it all for people to hear so what happened was she continued to tell
[45:09.440 --> 45:13.000]  us the reason why she believed in what she was doing and why she had to do this
[45:13.000 --> 45:18.240]  and she had to stand up for everybody not just herself but for everybody so at
[45:18.240 --> 45:23.080]  about 10 30 then all of the people gathered around her door and they started
[45:23.080 --> 45:28.600]  yelling at her to come out she was she would not open the door she would not
[45:28.600 --> 45:34.360]  go out they then took the battering ram and began to knock down her door and
[45:34.360 --> 45:38.800]  this part that we have recorded that hopefully you can play is absolutely
[45:38.800 --> 45:43.080]  chilling it is so frightening and Jim Percy who was on the line with me said
[45:43.080 --> 45:48.360]  this is what I went to Vietnam for this is why I thought in Vietnam was to come
[45:48.360 --> 45:52.120]  home to have to have my people take treated like this and let me stop you
[45:52.120 --> 45:56.920]  Joyce I want to get the Bloomberg reported when it was at 9.4 trillion
[45:56.920 --> 46:01.160]  that that would have paid off all mortgages not not mortgages in arrears
[46:01.160 --> 46:06.440]  no no not mortgages just to poor people all mortgages from 50 million dollar
[46:06.440 --> 46:11.040]  houses to a hundred thousand dollar bungalows all mortgages when it passed
[46:11.040 --> 46:17.560]  9 trillion now they have spent according to Bloomberg and AP 14.8
[46:17.560 --> 46:23.200]  trillion that would pay off all mortgages all credit cards all car loans but
[46:23.200 --> 46:27.760]  here's the deal we've got to pay for all that with interest to the banks we gave
[46:27.760 --> 46:32.480]  it to we give them our money then we pay interest on it we pay them to be
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.700]  slaves so again if we're gonna have socialism ladies and gentlemen the point
[46:36.700 --> 46:40.360]  is all the houses would have been paid for we're not getting any of this Joyce
[46:40.360 --> 46:45.800]  this is unbelievable and they're wanting any excuse to take your property like I
[46:45.800 --> 46:50.240]  said if you don't go out and go away they try to take my little house yeah
[46:50.240 --> 46:53.840]  they tried to take no matter in your property I don't care what the excuse
[46:53.840 --> 46:58.720]  is they want your property and they are going to get it that's their goal so
[46:58.720 --> 47:04.800]  Don realizes this and Don was standing strong 54 year old 125 pound grandmother
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.040]  she was told to have her children out of there because of the marriage license
[47:09.040 --> 47:12.440]  that allows the state to have control over the children had the children been
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.080]  there they would have carted them off to DFS and so there she was endangering the
[47:16.080 --> 47:20.680]  lives of her children and would have put them into foster homes so she didn't
[47:20.680 --> 47:24.760]  have her children there she had her daughter there who is of course above
[47:24.760 --> 47:29.360]  age and then her grandchildren were off the property at the time they came to
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.280]  get her animals they came to get all of her belongings we don't know what has
[47:33.280 --> 47:37.680]  happened because after you hear this you will realize that Don was not treated
[47:37.680 --> 47:41.080]  very well and by the way we need to go to the courthouse when they try to sell it
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.280]  off and and and and show the little criminals it'll probably be local
[47:45.280 --> 47:47.920]  bureaucrats trying to get the house because they always have his little
[47:47.920 --> 47:53.120]  private little secret auctions for themselves little boss hogs
[47:53.120 --> 47:57.880]  Joyce how long is this clip we're gonna play it should be about five minutes to
[47:57.880 --> 48:02.880]  the point where they break in and they totally subdue her is approximately about
[48:02.880 --> 48:06.440]  five minutes we can if we can cut right to the chase and I think John's got it
[48:06.440 --> 48:09.760]  right there it may be only about two minutes from the no that's fine in
[48:09.760 --> 48:12.680]  fact I want to play more of this I want to hear the buildup that's okay Joyce
[48:12.680 --> 48:15.960]  because you said you were going for 30 minutes before this happened maybe we
[48:15.960 --> 48:18.920]  should let's do this let's talk about because I know I've been told and I've
[48:18.920 --> 48:21.880]  also heard you guys are really covering this I know we've been covering it some
[48:21.880 --> 48:25.880]  but not as much as we should break down what you've been seeing the different
[48:25.880 --> 48:29.000]  tricks they're playing there's so many tricks I don't know them all I'm just you
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.200]  know I've seen what happened to my grandparents and what happened to you
[48:32.200 --> 48:36.280]  know my dad and what happened to me with chicanery with the criminals that run
[48:36.280 --> 48:40.040]  government that have hijacked the nation so so let's walk through that till the
[48:40.040 --> 48:45.960]  eight after in about 15 minutes because I want a lot of stations join us in the
[48:45.960 --> 48:50.600]  second hour that don't carry the first let's recap go over all that's
[48:50.600 --> 48:53.200]  happening some of the background you have will play out at eight after okay
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.480]  Joyce okay you've got it okay so so without me interrupting lay out again
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.120]  what's happened what's and then let's spend the rest of time we have the next
[49:01.120 --> 49:06.600]  two short segments getting into what your own knowledge is on this okay the
[49:06.600 --> 49:12.800]  situation is a woman has refused to let go of her house she does not want her
[49:12.800 --> 49:17.080]  property to be taken away so she does everything to defend that now she was
[49:17.080 --> 49:21.120]  working with Jim Percy who has written a book called am I the only American that
[49:21.120 --> 49:25.800]  thinks this way when he found out that this kind of fraudulent activity was
[49:25.800 --> 49:31.280]  taking place she then began to be really empowered because she listens to
[49:31.280 --> 49:36.200]  Genesis to be empowered to do the right thing to save her property so she
[49:36.200 --> 49:40.840]  submitted to the judge the paperwork showing that her mortgage was in fact
[49:40.840 --> 49:47.200]  paid in full the second mortgage company later on who purchased that mortgage
[49:47.200 --> 49:53.040]  then tried to foreclose on her now as a representative Marcy Camptor said on do
[49:53.040 --> 49:59.480]  not let people take your home if it is if they do not have a choice start over
[49:59.480 --> 50:03.280]  your ear your phone cut out what who is the representative start over
[50:03.280 --> 50:09.440]  representative Marcy Camptor we're on television on CNN and said if people do
[50:09.440 --> 50:14.760]  not have an equity interest on that lien they do not have a right to your
[50:14.760 --> 50:18.800]  property in other words if they're selling mortgages back and forth and over
[50:18.800 --> 50:22.520]  and over and over again and we know that they usually get time ten times the
[50:22.520 --> 50:27.440]  amount of money put on their books for a simple loan then she said you do not
[50:27.440 --> 50:30.760]  have to give up your home and she was encouraging people to be squatters to
[50:30.760 --> 50:35.000]  stay in their home because that company that mortgage company does not have an
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.440]  equity there's been court rulings there's been a bunch of them that have
[50:38.440 --> 50:44.000]  found that way that's right it's found for the homeowner and they're saying no
[50:44.000 --> 50:49.640]  you can't take that home well as a result of that she got really empowered and
[50:49.640 --> 50:53.920]  decided to become very strong and save her home not just for her but
[50:53.920 --> 50:56.720]  representing all the other people in this country who are about to have the

[54:20.520 --> 54:24.960]  in a visual format TV format in the last two hours but more and more we end up
[54:24.960 --> 54:30.120]  doing three four hours of the show and we've just gone live at prisonplanet.tv
[54:30.120 --> 54:33.920]  for all the members that watch there and then of course it's posted as an
[54:33.920 --> 54:37.560]  archive at the end of the show each day and then folks rebut the four wins all
[54:37.560 --> 54:41.240]  over the internet with millions and millions of views every week very very
[54:41.240 --> 54:46.680]  effective that's why they're shutting down you google videos announced they're
[54:46.680 --> 54:55.160]  totally shutting down YouTube is going from a user format to a format that is
[54:55.160 --> 54:58.360]  corporate and this is all being announced and I keep telling people and
[54:58.360 --> 55:01.360]  they go oh they're not getting rid of a Google video they're not gonna start
[55:01.360 --> 55:05.520]  restricting YouTube yeah they are and so we better start using these subsites
[55:05.520 --> 55:09.720]  and make them the biggest sites out there because YouTube is a thing of the
[55:09.720 --> 55:13.560]  past while it's still big and somewhat still open we've got to use it because
[55:13.560 --> 55:16.160]  that's where the people are it's bigger than all the other big video sites
[55:16.160 --> 55:20.840]  combined going to Joyce Riley Genesis talk show host and coming up in about 10
[55:20.840 --> 55:26.360]  15 minutes we're gonna play this clip at the eight after so I guess it's in 12
[55:26.360 --> 55:32.040]  minutes Joyce Riley continuing so so so this lady had a note paid in full but
[55:32.040 --> 55:34.960]  they don't care they just sold the mortgage another company then claimed
[55:34.960 --> 55:37.960]  you own money and I've seen so many mainstream news articles where they
[55:37.960 --> 55:41.840]  admit these fraudulent companies will just take people's houses that have
[55:41.840 --> 55:46.760]  already paid many many times just outright fraud and they even lose in
[55:46.760 --> 55:50.040]  court cases and just pay the multi-million dollar fines but that
[55:50.040 --> 55:53.680]  they'll still billions and then pay millions so you're saying in this case
[55:53.680 --> 55:57.880]  you were already aware of this case then that this was clearly fraud so the
[55:57.880 --> 56:02.200]  police came in there in Missouri continue from there I don't know her
[56:02.200 --> 56:06.800]  situation and paying I do know that when Wachovia took over the mortgage they
[56:06.800 --> 56:10.760]  then said they were not going to honor the previous mortgage company of saying
[56:10.760 --> 56:17.200]  that the note had been paid in full so since Wachovia was not on the lean did
[56:17.200 --> 56:21.320]  not have an equity interest that's when she went to the judge and she said you
[56:21.320 --> 56:28.040]  don't have jurisdiction you can't take this house because Wachovia has no room
[56:28.040 --> 56:33.880]  to do this and that is what began to take place was the fight with the sheriff
[56:33.880 --> 56:39.880]  and with the county to try and take her home so Don Welch then prepared herself
[56:39.880 --> 56:44.000]  for this and decided that she had to make a stand and there's time that people
[56:44.000 --> 56:49.320]  start making a stand and not just giving up because it's so easy to give up or
[56:49.320 --> 56:53.160]  renegotiate or whatever and she didn't feel that that was the situation here
[56:53.160 --> 56:58.480]  she has lost her job she has no money evidently they were not willing to work
[56:58.480 --> 57:02.520]  with her but I don't know that to be a fact so I'm just simply saying you're
[57:02.520 --> 57:05.440]  working with somebody that was working with her and you had a wrong today and
[57:05.440 --> 57:08.880]  then you had to go off air as the show was over we have this audio coming up
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.960]  but but Joyce in the rest of the segment the next segment before we get to this
[57:12.960 --> 57:17.840]  audio here on the show for people what you end of the last segment with this
[57:17.840 --> 57:22.040]  key this the number of homelessness doubled they're now make a resting
[57:22.040 --> 57:25.320]  homeless making them live in shelters charging them rent saying they've got a
[57:25.320 --> 57:30.560]  work to pay that rent we're talking about slave labor and the poor house the
[57:30.560 --> 57:34.240]  debtors prison being reinstituted here and as the economy continues to be
[57:34.240 --> 57:38.440]  imploded by design we have the IMF World Bank Bilderberg Group documents they
[57:38.440 --> 57:42.160]  are engineering this by design Joyce a lot of arrogant people out there that
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.520]  don't care about this lady to understand they're next that's right just like
[57:46.520 --> 57:50.760]  Gary Brownfield was saying you know you we were talking about this as being part
[57:50.760 --> 57:54.320]  of the plan to get private property there is a desire and a goal to get
[57:54.320 --> 57:58.680]  private property I don't care for what reason they use well in this case Don
[57:58.680 --> 58:03.840]  was standing tall and I think when people hear this absolutely chilling
[58:03.840 --> 58:08.720]  break-in at her house that was live on the air this morning or that was live

[58:32.440 --> 58:37.400]  are now having to pay the price and she paid the price dearly now as we said

[59:56.680 --> 1:00:09.200]  the GCN radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:00:09.200 --> 1:00:16.960]  you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and
[1:00:16.960 --> 1:00:23.280]  now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:28.200]  14.8 trillion according to Bloomberg and AP has been stolen in seven months
[1:00:28.200 --> 1:00:33.680]  they're online in one year out from the bailout to spend 26 trillion to your
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:40.640]  money that's double the GDP the federal inspector general says they don't know
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:43.320]  where the trillions went and they're not going to tell you the federal reserves
[1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:46.480]  on record saying they're above the law and then this isn't just people that
[1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:49.720]  haven't been paying their mortgage in my experience their companies are just
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:53.440]  saying you still owe when it's paid off especially if it looks like your blue
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:56.640]  collar and then they just send the police out and they take your house I
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:01:00.000]  mean it is this happened during the Great Depression too they're also
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:05.120]  starting to call in full loans they're starting to call in full notes and like
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:08.800]  let's say you owe five hundred thousand dollars you know you you did owe a
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:12.880]  million on your family farm you bought or a piece of land you expanded your
[1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:16.680]  farm or ranch on and you've paid off half of it they're now saying you know
[1:01:16.680 --> 1:01:20.720]  what there was little claws in there we interpret we're taking the property right
[1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:23.360]  now unless you pay half million bucks right now you're like hey I'm making my
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:28.840]  payments they go SWAT team standing by SWAT team standing by and then you're
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:32.120]  become homeless and they now grab you off the street puts you in a government
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:38.600]  home let's basically a prison and make you pay rent I mean Joyce in fact guys
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:42.120]  people won't believe me that search engine that New York State to make
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:45.800]  homeless pay rent I want people to see this for themselves Joyce this is
[1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:50.000]  frightening because this is getting worse and worse and worse and coming up
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.600]  in the next segment we're gonna play the audio here that's never before heard
[1:01:53.600 --> 1:01:56.920]  when you went off air today but you still had her online from your radio
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:01.000]  show when this happened to her this is this is I haven't heard this yet but
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:05.240]  John Harmon says this is some really painful audio to listen to can you
[1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:08.840]  tell us what's coming up absolutely horrible I mean we're all in tears so
[1:02:08.840 --> 1:02:12.080]  we're listening to it everybody in our office at the power hour was in tears
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:16.600]  listening to this because it is just so chilling to believe that it can happen in
[1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:21.080]  America to innocent people I mean really innocent people you know that the
[1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:24.200]  trillions of dollars you were talking about earlier that's going to you know
[1:02:24.200 --> 1:02:28.600]  that leave no bank or behind bailout act you know anybody that needs the money
[1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:31.480]  that they want to give it to gets the money and you know I was saying to
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:35.400]  Josh this morning do you know how long it takes to count to a trillion if you
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:40.400]  Alex decided to start right now and count to a trillion it would take you 42,000
[1:02:40.400 --> 1:02:45.480]  years that is so unbelievable of how much a trillion dollars is and then
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:48.840]  somebody's a few dollars behind on their mortgage payments and they get thrown
[1:02:48.840 --> 1:02:51.960]  out on the street because they can't get a job here because we're too busy
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:57.400]  giving the jobs away to China and then bringing in the plastic food for our
[1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:01.400]  babies to eat and our animals to eat to give them kidney stones well let me add
[1:03:01.400 --> 1:03:06.680]  to that let me add to that Joyce in fact we just put up the headline New York
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:10.280]  Charges rent for working homeless they find out oh you're homeless but you've
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:14.520]  got a job they rifle through them they go and start debiting the little job with
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:16.920]  the poor person trying to get back on their feet just like all over the
[1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:19.720]  country they people have a mobile home they're living in while they work trying
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:23.600]  to get a house they seize it the minute the tags out but then leave illegal
[1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:27.800]  aliens alone but you guys can pull this up I'm thinking the exact headline it's
[1:03:27.800 --> 1:03:31.400]  been all over the news that half of Congress doesn't pay taxes most the
[1:03:31.400 --> 1:03:34.720]  Obama administration doesn't pay him and says they don't care but more
[1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:40.360]  importantly if you see these articles they got rid of most the IRS enforcers
[1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:45.400]  on billionaires and they focused them on actually blue collar which of course

[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:25.920]  don welch has been a a listener to genesis network for five years and she's
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:31.800]  very well aware of what her rights are so when this first mortgage company when
[1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:36.000]  she was smart enough to write to the mortgage company and ask them if they
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.600]  still own the note and if her mortgage was paid in full they sent her back in
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:44.960]  writing yes your mortgage is paid in full well the mortgage had been sold to
[1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:50.480]  walkovia walkovia then enters in though their name is not on the lean and they
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:55.200]  have no equity interest in her home they went to the judge and of course the
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:58.800]  sheriff and told them to go ahead and take the house once you went through the
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:03.280]  whole proceedings all the time standing up for herself and challenged that
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:07.440]  challenging them every step of the way she put notices on her front and back
[1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:13.560]  door she put up no trespassing signs she said this is my property and i will
[1:11:13.560 --> 1:11:18.360]  not voluntarily give it up so as a result of that over the last few months
[1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:21.200]  we've known that there were some problems there and that the police were
[1:11:21.200 --> 1:11:25.960]  going to come they sent it one note to her saying that we will come within five
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:30.960]  days she put a note up saying i will sue you as a private individual mr. sheriff
[1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:37.200]  if you do this well they did come today and when they came to her home at about
[1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:43.360]  now we had her on the air for at eight o'clock central and they came to her house
[1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:50.280]  at about 845 they started gathering around with the ambulance the Humvee
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:54.960]  and all the vehicles started gathering away from our home now her home is right
[1:11:54.960 --> 1:12:00.680]  next to the fairgrounds there in Hillsborough Missouri so they gathered
[1:12:00.680 --> 1:12:05.040]  all around there kind of like they did with Waco so we got really concerned
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:10.320]  we're afraid of what was going to happen to her and at about 9 o'clock excuse me
[1:12:10.320 --> 1:12:16.320]  10 o'clock we went off the air and we were off the air and unable to keep
[1:12:16.320 --> 1:12:19.800]  contact with the listeners which is why I'm so appreciative that you were willing
[1:12:19.800 --> 1:12:23.280]  to put this on because these people have been hanging not knowing what happened
[1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:29.240]  well we taped from 10 a.m. on because John was able to get it connected up
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:35.360]  there a genesis and help us out with Ted's involvement there and what we did was we
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:41.800]  continued to tape this in an ongoing fashion so that we could hear her and
[1:12:41.800 --> 1:12:49.640]  had her on the phone the whole time at approximately 1025 they then began to
[1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:54.120]  come to her door to break it down with the battering ram they came to her door
[1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:58.280]  started screaming for her to come outside she refused to do so they knew
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:03.440]  she was not a a person who was going to harm them and so they weren't even
[1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:08.800]  showing any weapons at the time but she was unfortunately the victim of them
[1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:14.080]  breaking down her door and what you're going to hear is the sound this morning
[1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.800]  at 10 30 central time when they broke down her door then after that I'll give
[1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:22.760]  you the update of what I just learned has happened to her since that time but
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:27.360]  this is so chilling I want everybody to take this off of info wars and get it
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:32.320]  on to your email send it out and let people hear what it's like for a 54

[1:13:36.120 --> 1:13:40.680]  grandchildren and then meanwhile the bankers have stolen 14 plus trillion and
[1:13:40.680 --> 1:13:44.400]  they say we're not going to tell you where it is in fact here's Bloomberg
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:49.280]  today Fed inspector general claims she does not know where the trillions when
[1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:52.840]  it doesn't have to tell anybody later I'm going to play clips of the defense
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:56.400]  department saying they won't say where trillions have gone it's just a rogue
[1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:01.120]  criminal government and I will again remind people I had Bank of America a
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:05.120]  few years ago by my mortgage from my mortgage company been sold many times
[1:14:05.120 --> 1:14:09.360]  and then just take the escrow money and start suing me to take my house even
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:12.280]  though I had the title company and everything that I'd paid it they said
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:17.440]  we don't care and I had to counter sue them to get them to back off well a lot
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:21.800]  of you know people who are broke can barely buy groceries you know they've
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:26.240]  paid off their mortgage that's who they come after let's go ahead now here is

[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:05.660]  familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit
[1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:09.480]  spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:13.040]  some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:16.680]  remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small
[1:22:16.680 --> 1:22:20.360]  portion of your depositors held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit
[1:22:20.360 --> 1:22:23.760]  spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure
[1:22:23.760 --> 1:22:28.000]  deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort is
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:31.920]  underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for
[1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:35.720]  depositors however an increase in money supply without equal expansion and
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:39.920]  productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength and stability I
[1:22:39.920 --> 1:22:43.560]  recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be commonly
[1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:47.680]  repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have been

[1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:51.080]  and stealing I want to explain again more than double all the mortgages now
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:54.840]  that wouldn't be double what's nine trillion would pay off all the mortgages
[1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:58.880]  at 14 plus so more than more than a hundred percent of the mortgages and
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:05.040]  then again half all the mortgages in the US and half again would be paid off all
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:10.840]  mortgages with the money taxpayers have had to pay it out of the bankers they're
[1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:16.040]  using it all offshore going to Joyce Riley we have Jim Percy who knew the
[1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:20.640]  lady and this just happened to and was on the line with Joyce while she was on
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:23.760]  air Joyce finishing up your point though about this lady's courage and the new
[1:25:23.760 --> 1:25:28.320]  developments we've got then we'll go to Jim about this okay she was so
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:32.200]  incredibly brave what she did the manner in which she handled herself she kept
[1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:36.600]  asserting herself the whole entire time and not in a violent radical way in a
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:40.560]  way a grandmother would protect her brood really she said I'm the matriarch
[1:25:40.560 --> 1:25:45.040]  of this family and I need to protect them well I just got word that the
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:52.000]  television company the television network that we had contacted had gone out to
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.480]  her house they were there toward the end of the event unfortunately didn't get
[1:25:56.480 --> 1:26:01.440]  there in time but they were able to according to Jim and I think Jim can
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:05.680]  give us probably better information on this they downloaded the information from
[1:26:05.680 --> 1:26:09.080]  the kids that had been video recording this and the other people that were
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:13.920]  video recording there they had gotten found out what had happened I'll let
[1:26:13.920 --> 1:26:19.240]  Jim tell you about what took place then with the 15 year old grandson but the
[1:26:19.240 --> 1:26:23.480]  bottom line is they have now gone in there they've got they've got armed
[1:26:23.480 --> 1:26:27.920]  police everywhere taking all of her things out and they have taken her to
[1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:32.800]  jail so that's what we know thus far is that they've taken her to jail for
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:38.000]  trespassing in her own house let's go to Jim Percy who's written I've been
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.720]  covering this situation Jim what's the local TV station do you have the call
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:47.440]  letters of that or will we see this on the nightly news the afternoon news no
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:53.120]  I only know that it's an NBC affiliate the station in Hillsborough and in St.
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:27:01.440]  Louis and it's channel five I spoke with Doran's grandson about 25 30 minutes
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:07.360]  ago and and he said Jim he said the sheriffs came over to me when they were
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:11.920]  taking my grandmother and my mom out of the house in handcuffs because I was
[1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:17.480]  shouting at them you're violating her constitutional rights you are you are so
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:21.720]  long in what you're doing and a sheriff walked over to him and said listen if you
[1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:25.200]  don't keep quiet I'm going to read you your right and he looked at the police
[1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:29.000]  officer and he said I'm a minor and he said well then you'll be a minor in
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:35.720]  jail if you keep talking and this 15 year old grandson that that Doran has
[1:27:35.720 --> 1:27:40.840]  is quite a quite an interesting young man he's he's got a real heart of steel
[1:27:40.840 --> 1:27:45.840]  but you know Alex it's it's really two-fold what's going on with with
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:52.400]  Don Welsh not only does she have a statement from the original bank that
[1:27:52.400 --> 1:27:59.000]  she used to mortgage your home that her home is paid for and that only did
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:04.880]  Wacovia not do their due diligence and put themselves as a legal lean holder
[1:28:04.880 --> 1:28:10.840]  on title to the property you know Christopher Boyko ruled in November of
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:16.720]  2007 in 14 cases that were brought before his court regarding Dorch bank
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:23.120]  trying to do the same thing judge Christopher Boyko ruled that because the
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:28.520]  bank had not put themselves in a legal leanhold position that the properties
[1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:34.400]  were paid for and those people walked out at his court with their homes now
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:39.920]  Don Welsh not only use that as her defense but we also challenged the
[1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:45.840]  jurisdiction of the court because as you well know Alex today there are three
[1:28:45.840 --> 1:28:49.160]  courts in America there's a common law court there's an equity court and
[1:28:49.160 --> 1:28:53.960]  admiralty court the only courts that are up and running are equity and admiralty
[1:28:53.960 --> 1:28:59.600]  and the only thing that the equity and admiralty courts can judicate are those
[1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:06.560]  who have voluntarily consented to a contract or those who are corporations
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:11.760]  and we had filed with the court an affidavit denial of corporation
[1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:18.040]  existence and we had we had challenged the jurisdiction of the court and when
[1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:22.840]  when the court's jurisdiction is challenged Alex you probably know this
[1:29:22.840 --> 1:29:28.360]  that court cannot proceed until they overcome the challenge of jurisdiction
[1:29:28.360 --> 1:29:31.840]  yeah well they don't care they don't mean the government ships the drugs in the
[1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:35.680]  cocaine the heroin in openly police openly pull the ladies over and grab
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:39.840]  their earrings and watches publicly and it's on the news and the cops say we're
[1:29:39.840 --> 1:29:42.920]  allowed to you don't like it we got a SWAT team you know I mean that's the
[1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:48.120]  answer you don't like it we got a SWAT team and we'll finish up with this on
[1:29:48.120 --> 1:29:51.520]  the other side they get everybody else's calls and shift gears stay with us we're

[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:39.440]  executive order to do it when you get the DMV but the illegals are all exempt
[1:34:39.440 --> 1:34:44.120]  everybody for 36 years at birth has blood taken for a DNA database which they
[1:34:44.120 --> 1:34:48.040]  now admit is for eugenics I told you that for years now it's mainstream news
[1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:53.040]  the human genome project Cold Springs Harbor just search engine Cold Springs
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:57.200]  Harbor don't believe me it'll be the birthplace of eugenics what what Hitler
[1:34:57.200 --> 1:35:02.480]  quoted as his founding play it's all eugenics and I know I'm ranting here
[1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:07.600]  it's and I'm gonna go to Wilson Mike George Steve and Josh because I know
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:11.280]  you've been holding I said I'd have open phones today and then this came up but
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:15.240]  Joyce I know you'll be covering this on your show tomorrow in the morning and
[1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:19.760]  then I want to have an update from you on this as it develops we're on the KSDK
[1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:27.240]  st. Louis NBC 5 channel we don't see anything there yet about this their
[1:35:27.240 --> 1:35:30.840]  editors might you know not let them run into they may say she's with Al Qaeda or
[1:35:30.840 --> 1:35:34.360]  something before they do but it is Missouri where they say Ron Paul's a
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:38.960]  terrorist and libertarian bomber stickers or terrorism and where on in
[1:35:38.960 --> 1:35:42.800]  Missouri they announced if you criticize Obama you'll be arrested by the way
[1:35:42.800 --> 1:35:46.960]  new lesters don't believe me go to YouTube and type in
[1:35:46.960 --> 1:35:53.760]  critics Missouri Missourians credit Missourians may be arrested for
[1:35:53.760 --> 1:35:57.920]  criticizing Obama and you'll see and the news is with a straight face you know
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:02.040]  you know Joyce Missouri is a great place the show me state hard-working great
[1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:04.880]  salt of the earth people a lot of the folks from Missouri are the ones that
[1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:08.200]  founded Texas and they were from Missouri Tennessee Kentucky places like
[1:36:08.200 --> 1:36:11.560]  that Alabama what has happened to Missouri or is it there's there's so
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:16.000]  many patriots there big brothers really trying to crack down I mean why do we
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.200]  see some I mean others going on everywhere Texas is real bad too so is
[1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:23.560]  Illinois every state's bad but I mean what is it about Missouri that they just
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:28.060]  really hate patriots well I think that it's the heartland area where they can
[1:36:28.060 --> 1:36:32.160]  make the heartland look bad they can make anybody look bad I mean Texas has got
[1:36:32.160 --> 1:36:36.080]  a reputation but Missouri doesn't so now all of these patriots that are
[1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:38.920]  springing up Missouri and let me tell you there's a lot of them that live in
[1:36:38.920 --> 1:36:42.960]  the lake of the Ozarks or back in the Ozark Mountains and don't want anybody
[1:36:42.960 --> 1:36:47.280]  to even know where they live I think it's a concern for them so the state of
[1:36:47.280 --> 1:36:50.720]  Missouri is attempting to do everything they can to control these people and
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:54.920]  they use the force and the intimidation so that's what we're seeing and I just
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:36:58.480]  appreciate I have to tell you how much I appreciate Jim Percy because Jim Percy
[1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:04.760]  was up at four o'clock this morning there on the phone with with Don Welch if
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:09.520]  she needed him any time of the day or night he has been there for her I want
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:14.200]  to give Jim Percy credit because when Don went into the court he was right there
[1:37:14.200 --> 1:37:18.560]  with her on a cell phone and then the judge called her to the bench and he
[1:37:18.560 --> 1:37:22.840]  was telling her what to do also this is not a situation where Jim encouraged her
[1:37:22.840 --> 1:37:27.680]  to do anything different this is a situation where she was already doing
[1:37:27.680 --> 1:37:32.000]  this she was already in trouble with the mortgage because of them saying that
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:36.760]  it wasn't paid off yes she decided to make her stand so folks tried to come to
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:41.880]  her aid and absolutely well Joyce as this unfolds will I guess you know they're
[1:37:41.880 --> 1:37:46.560]  gonna charge her with trespassing for being in her house they don't just take
[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:51.320]  your house now in America when the armed police come with their with their
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:55.400]  Humvees that I guess they now charge you and it's just a real
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:38:00.800]  travesty so we'll we'll track this as it develops Joyce and we'll have you pop
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:04.120]  back in and Jim DeMarve you can do it thank you so much Joyce thank you so
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:08.360]  much Alex you bet all right we just spent an hour and eight minutes on that
[1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:16.600]  but it's it's so important because this isn't where you know I'm just hearing
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:21.560]  this from afar I've been looking at this and I've been experiencing this in
[1:38:21.560 --> 1:38:27.120]  Austin and I've had it happen to me where I'm paying the house payment and
[1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:34.000]  then you get a lawsuit you know service and they say you didn't pay your escrow
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:37.880]  and then you go and you go here's all the documents Bank of America you send it
[1:38:37.880 --> 1:38:43.320]  registered and they keep a suit going and you have to sue them had to pay to
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:48.480]  have a suit filed countersuit so defend myself ends and then that they kept
[1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:51.680]  going with the case no we're taking your house so I said okay I'll go ahead and
[1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:55.360]  sue you and man they they dropped it oh we found your escrow money see they're
[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:00.440]  testing I do I have a slave do I have a schmuck do I have somebody I can feed on
[1:39:00.440 --> 1:39:06.800]  and you know I understand the sheriffs get put in a bad position where lawful
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:10.080]  mortgages people haven't paid whatever it's private property the most sacred
[1:39:10.080 --> 1:39:14.680]  thing in this country if you don't have private property you have nothing so the
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:19.640]  other police are trained to do this but it's different when you know that they've
[1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:28.320]  sucked 14.8 trillion out that is five plus trillion more according to
[1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:34.640]  Bloomberg then they need to pay off all mortgages and I keep making that point
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:38.720]  you know we gone to the smart growth conferences and North American Union
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:41.400]  NAFTA highway conferences we read their documents and they talk about you know
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:45.360]  they come into cities and they go we got a hundred billion bucks for your town if
[1:39:45.360 --> 1:39:48.000]  you turn all the toll roads all the roads in the toll roads and we're gonna do
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.040]  this for your state and that we have unlimited money you know why the banks
[1:39:52.040 --> 1:39:55.320]  are flushing money and nobody else is they've cut liquidity off the public
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:58.880]  they've deindustrialized this they're bragging it's all planned they in the
[1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:01.800]  I'm having World Bank International Bank of Settlement documents I wrote a book
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:05.800]  about it 2002 to sit in a tyranny I had BBC reporters on about it we've had
[1:40:05.800 --> 1:40:10.200]  economists on we've had you know the guy that wrote economic hit man John
[1:40:10.200 --> 1:40:15.920]  Perkins who worked for him it's on record that they fraudulently create a
[1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:19.800]  debtor system where there's more debt than there is real currency and real
[1:40:19.800 --> 1:40:24.400]  assets they buy up all the real assets with it and then leave us holding the
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:27.680]  bag it's like musical chairs they've all got a chair to make sure the people
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:34.080]  don't and it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse until we stand up
[1:40:34.080 --> 1:40:39.000]  and say no okay look I'm just gonna take calls now for the next hour and then
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:43.600]  very important news is coming up on the government run child kidnapping rings
[1:40:43.600 --> 1:40:49.040]  because this new Obama announcement they're gonna release some new photos
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:53.640]  we'll tell you what's really behind that and we've been right about this in the
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:56.040]  past we'll tell you what's really going on and give you the full scope of what
[1:40:56.040 --> 1:40:59.840]  we know and it's so horrible it's hard to believe also the attacks on free speech
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:06.840]  and the DHS reports to be used to then deny no judge no jury no arrest I told
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:11.580]  you and homeless Kurdy said this you're gonna be on a no-work list no own a gun

[1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:47.920]  day and I know a lot of people are good the military and are upset about what's
[1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:51.160]  happening and Ron Paul got most of the donations from the military and I know
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:56.480]  that but they found sifting through the military people the scum like they're
[1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:01.080]  panning for gold or panning for neural water trash and they got all this all
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:05.000]  the sand to them all the good veterans and military or you know the good cops

[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:47.200]  on sub pages and relegating them and banning Patriots not just my videos
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:51.280]  hundreds of sites Nate Evans I'm gonna tell you about it later well I'm a I'm
[1:42:51.280 --> 1:42:55.320]  there get the calls I don't shut up Nate Evans had given us a director's
[1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:59.160]  account we went and we had uses as he gave it to us a few months ago we go
[1:42:59.160 --> 1:43:02.480]  there and it's gone he said yeah I was uploading your videos they didn't even
[1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:05.120]  give me a copyright infringement they just they just said we delete your
[1:43:05.120 --> 1:43:08.800]  account we're not gonna have a director's account belonging to Alex Jones so we
[1:43:08.800 --> 1:43:15.240]  have them read handed from Nate Evans the graphics on truth rising and on the
[1:43:15.240 --> 1:43:21.920]  Obama deception that I've known for four years his family came the first
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:24.840]  rising premiere here in town he's from Texas but he lives in New York and LA
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:32.520]  works on big national TV shows and he donated some of those great 3d graphics
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:37.160]  you see of Obama and others the Obama deception and he told me we should set
[1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:40.480]  up Nate Evans and do a show in the next few days with Nate Evans and change the
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:46.720]  channel and enough respect some of these cool directors on there but but the
[1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:52.960]  point is they just YouTube is out to get us and you know why we are hurting the
[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:56.960]  New World Order folks I mean I get on air and I say they've stolen trillions
[1:43:56.960 --> 1:43:59.880]  they said they're above the law here's a congressional testimony with them

[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:30.320]  hello sir yesterday somebody was calling in asking about the Council for
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:36.200]  National Policy and I thought it's worth pointing out that the Dr. Stan Monti
[1:44:36.200 --> 1:44:41.440]  at least was a member I don't know if he still is or not but back in the 90s he
[1:44:41.440 --> 1:44:47.560]  was listed as in their membership roles for whatever that's worth the main
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:54.120]  reason I called I several weeks ago I emailed Aaron and Rob D about Dr.
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:45:00.080]  Gordon Prather who had I'd heard him as a guest on a Goyette show down in
[1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:05.440]  Phoenix a couple years ago he's he's an excellent guest he's I think he used to
[1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:10.880]  work at Los Alamos he's a nuclear physicist somehow he was involved with
[1:45:10.880 --> 1:45:18.480]  the inspection the weapons inspection regime in Iraq before that all fell
[1:45:18.480 --> 1:45:23.200]  off his name again we'll write it down my parents walked off Gordon Prather
[1:45:23.200 --> 1:45:32.240]  I heard him PR AETH ER and he'd be a good guy to just find out what is the
[1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:36.440]  capability of our government in terms of detecting nuclear devices in case one
[1:45:36.440 --> 1:45:43.040]  one just some terrorist device goes off in a big city could have reasonably
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:47.480]  been expected to have been detected beforehand he would know that kind of
[1:45:47.480 --> 1:45:52.560]  thing and I'd kind of like to have him weigh in on that issue absolutely we'll
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:56.800]  check into that what do you think about bills introduced that actually say if
[1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:02.920]  you hurt someone's feelings federal felony charge under terrorism clauses
[1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:08.320]  what do you think about open bills saying if the Attorney General thinks
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:12.120]  you might be a danger we're gonna put you on a no-gun list that's what I keep
[1:46:12.120 --> 1:46:15.000]  saying because I remember seeing Homeland Security Ridge when he was the
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.840]  head of it say that this to work to live to own guns to travel they're gonna have
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:22.440]  federal checkpoints on the state highways I remember seeing Bill
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:26.160]  Clinton's plans they've been planning this a long time it's just now it's
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.320]  happened they were clearly clearly planning it several years ago when they
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:35.120]  started writing these are enacting these laws it says if you threaten the
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:40.360]  congressman you know you're you're guilty of terrorism and they knew they knew
[1:46:40.360 --> 1:46:44.000]  what was coming up and they were they were uphaving the ground for for their
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:48.200]  antics that's right and they're saying aggressive speech is what that is like
[1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:51.080]  you better stop it or we're gonna throw you bums out and the police show up
[1:46:51.080 --> 1:46:57.200]  remember the news articles if you search engine the term man visited by
[1:46:57.200 --> 1:47:01.360]  Homeland Security for buying ammo and they usually bury it I've seen a bunch
[1:47:01.360 --> 1:47:04.640]  of mainstream articles in New York and Texas and Illinois and California in
[1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:08.080]  Oregon or some of the places in Missouri of all places you'll see the
[1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:12.560]  articles and it's never in the headline cuz because I'm gonna put this in a
[1:47:12.560 --> 1:47:15.600]  film I've been looking these up it's always in the bottom of the article like
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:19.280]  it's no big deal oh Bob such-and-such bought a thousand rounds of ammo and
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:24.320]  Homeland Security visiting and putting on a list you know this guy bought three
[1:47:24.320 --> 1:47:28.920]  guns and got a Homeland Security visit asking him he was a terrorist they are
[1:47:28.920 --> 1:47:35.000]  advertising like you're a terrorist now if you go out and buy guns and ammo as a
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:40.320]  chilling effect well if we give it to this chilling effect it's over Mike what
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:45.080]  what I've been doing is is calling on these various issues that all my
[1:47:45.080 --> 1:47:48.280]  congressional delegation is Republican we only have one representative here in
[1:47:48.280 --> 1:47:53.440]  Wyoming she's a first-term or but I when I call them I I don't allow them to say
[1:47:53.440 --> 1:47:58.680]  well she or he voted no on that well it doesn't matter does it since they've
[1:47:58.680 --> 1:48:05.080]  they've marginalized themselves by eight years of apathy they can vote no and it
[1:48:05.080 --> 1:48:08.520]  doesn't matter because you've got a Democrat majority so I say you need to
[1:48:08.520 --> 1:48:14.160]  be there or congressman so-and-so needs to be pushing for criminal charges for a
[1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:19.680]  Justice Department investigation of Bernanke of the Greenspan of Paulson
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:25.440]  you know the whole gang exactly the Republicans didn't you know reinstate
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:27.960]  our liberties and our freedoms and all this they were in power they tried the
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:31.840]  opposite now that they're out of power they can act like their patriots and
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:36.040]  fighting all of this and the litmus test is arrest the bankers and if another
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:39.760]  of us starts saying that they can't get us all come after us all for doing it
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:42.120]  because believe me it's dangerous we're getting a lot of heat we're doing this
[1:48:42.120 --> 1:48:45.760]  and I'm doing it willingly Mike it's good hearing from you I appreciate your
[1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:51.840]  call all right George Steve Josh and others I'm gonna get to you in a moment
[1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:58.320]  I have looked more into this council for national policy because I keep getting
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:02.520]  emails and calls about it and people saying I've heard you're part of it or
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:06.760]  I've heard Ron Paul's part of it I've heard this guy's part of it that guy's
[1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:11.520]  part of it so I knew I'd heard of it before in association with Blackwater
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:16.440]  from some professors and people we'd had on and so I went and looked it up it's
[1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:22.080]  kind of like a junior CFR you know they have lots of these things that have you
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:24.840]  know Roberts rules or wherever where you don't talk about what goes on in the
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:30.440]  meeting and I went and looked at it it's something from the 80s where you know
[1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:34.720]  they went out and co-opted the preachers and went out and co-opted talk show
[1:49:34.720 --> 1:49:41.000]  host and went out and co-opted you know Oliver North was involved and and and
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.040]  all of these people and then when I look at the list of people that were
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:47.200]  involved in this I know most of them have even come out and you know I mean
[1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:55.000]  this was the 80s it's easy in 2009 to go look at this group you know they were
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:58.320]  being funded by the Hunt brothers and and and you know they wanted to bring
[1:49:58.320 --> 1:50:01.800]  back you know right wing Bellarites Constitution and and Hillary's given
[1:50:01.800 --> 1:50:05.240]  speeches about it I discovered that was what her whole vast right wing
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:08.280]  conspiracy was about and of course there's a vast right wing conspiracy
[1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:12.720]  that's the phony right wing co-opting you know conservatives in this country
[1:50:12.720 --> 1:50:15.840]  and also trying to get power in the political process that's how all these
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:21.920]  groups work but and we always explain we don't get too upset and and and and
[1:50:21.920 --> 1:50:26.520]  upsists about the even the council on foreign relations running everything we
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:30.120]  explained that's a pyramidal structure where most of them don't even know what
[1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:34.320]  the bigger picture is and they've been co-opped into this good old boy club
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.640]  trilateral Commission's a lot smaller it's pretty much all insiders
[1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:45.080]  Bilderberg total insiders but there's all these other groups but I mean the the
[1:50:45.080 --> 1:50:50.960]  the endless obsession with you know oh was somebody part of a right wing group
[1:50:50.960 --> 1:50:55.440]  25 30 years ago meanwhile all hell's coming down on us the bankers are taking
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:51:02.000]  over right now and they're trying to get us to fight off of left right I like

[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:26.200]  ladies and gentlemen the globalists have stated on record lately they've said
[2:08:26.200 --> 2:08:29.680]  that depression is great for example said he's having the best time of his
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:34.600]  life he's having a great depression this is the culmination of his life that we
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:39.880]  live too well and that they've got to teach us to be more frugal well how
[2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:43.640]  about they become more frugal you know it's always Oprah Winfrey and Al Gore and
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:46.120]  the rest of them have their own private jets and Al Gore literally owns
[2:08:46.120 --> 2:08:51.120]  Occidental petroleum well you know in the top 20 well companies out there the
[2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:56.960]  guys fabulously wealthy and you know the heir to the Armand Hammer fortune
[2:08:56.960 --> 2:09:00.880]  that's it was given all to his dad the senator and then to him Albert Gore
[2:09:00.880 --> 2:09:10.320]  senior and we just need to commit to ourselves to fight these people and we
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:14.080]  can't sit here and suck our thumbs and be distracted and diverted like we're a
[2:09:14.080 --> 2:09:19.040]  bunch of children where you know the the emperor has no clothes and the little
[2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:23.280]  kid steps forward and says the emperor's butt naked and then that you know the
[2:09:23.280 --> 2:09:26.960]  emperor's agents turn to the little four-year-old saying the emperor has no
[2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:32.280]  clothes and they say no you're a government agent little boy it isn't
[2:09:32.280 --> 2:09:35.600]  about the little boy let's just say the little boy is a government agent he's
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:39.080]  evil but why would he be exposing the emperor but let's just be mentally ill
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:43.920]  let's just say the little boy exposing the emperor's bad I'm bad I'm bad but
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:47.520]  can you look with your own eyeballs and see if the emperor's butt naked or not
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:51.400]  I mean you know I understand I'm bad let's just in that argument now because
[2:09:51.400 --> 2:09:55.720]  my goals is defeat the New World Order so let's just say I'm bad I'm everything
[2:09:55.720 --> 2:09:59.360]  bad everything bad the universe emanates from me it's not true but let's just say
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:03.600]  it now can we address the New World Order can we address what it's doing and
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:06.440]  what it's up to and what's happening let's go to calls alright I'm out of
[2:10:06.440 --> 2:10:10.960]  control here George and Maston Steve Josh Tim David others go ahead you're on
[2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:19.360]  the air George hello Alex hi Alex yes hi getting back to reading up the good
[2:10:19.360 --> 2:10:23.080]  and bad military I got a friend that did black ops over 30 years ago and I
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:27.040]  wanted to share with the listeners a couple things he told me back in the
[2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:31.480]  80s the military issued a memo to all officers asking if they had a problem
[2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:35.760]  putting a gun to civilians heads and playing the trigger he said that if
[2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:40.440]  they weren't they didn't answer yes that their career was over as they knew it
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:45.000]  and number two that he still has friends and active duty and told him that a
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:50.240]  whole boatload of microchips that just recently come into the country and
[2:10:50.240 --> 2:10:55.640]  ask them if they're just for kids he said no for everybody god bless you my
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:11:01.280]  god bless you anything else sir that's it no I mean how they this is on record
[2:11:01.280 --> 2:11:05.720]  this is this is not a secret that special forces especially the Delta
[2:11:05.720 --> 2:11:09.440]  force when they graduate or or they've they've done the physical stuff they've
[2:11:09.440 --> 2:11:12.920]  done the survival training they've you know gone through all these levels
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:19.840]  they're then given Machiavelli's book the prince which says the end justifies
[2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:24.520]  the means so you got to do evil to protect good you got a stage terror
[2:11:24.520 --> 2:11:28.640]  attacks to beat the bad guys because you're still the good guys and you've
[2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:33.960]  got to you know do all these horrible things it's kind of a play on what
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:39.600]  Churchill said about the truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies but
[2:11:39.600 --> 2:11:42.800]  really once you've played that little mind game those are just evil people
[2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:51.840]  that are manipulating folks who are who would be somewhat good to start down
[2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:55.320]  the road to the dark side you know that you're gonna get this power and be evil
[2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:58.440]  and do these bad things for the greater good because the enemy doesn't follow the
[2:11:58.440 --> 2:12:02.760]  rules so we got to break all the rules to so we're in an even playing field you
[2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:06.440]  know you got that soldier and they're already on such a power trip and so
[2:12:06.440 --> 2:12:11.320]  committed to this they say yes they'll do it but a lot of them say no and you
[2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:17.120]  know they start them out doing a lot of regular missions and then what you know
[2:12:17.120 --> 2:12:20.400]  by the time they've been saying army officer not even special forces just an
[2:12:20.400 --> 2:12:25.080]  army officer they say okay we want to recruit you captain into the central
[2:12:25.080 --> 2:12:30.720]  intelligence agency and we want you to do this with this agent and work with
[2:12:30.720 --> 2:12:35.240]  organized crime say in Chicago this is a true story and then the individual goes
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:41.400]  and they're dealing drugs in Chicago and that case they said they couldn't do it
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:48.240]  and left and their career and intelligence was over but I mean the
[2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:52.800]  government runs the major prostitution folks the ones they don't run they boss
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:58.840]  they run the cocaine they run the heroin they run the ecstasy they run they
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:02.920]  run it all except methamphetamine and marijuana and that's why they wage war
[2:13:02.920 --> 2:13:06.800]  against those and methamphetamine is bad for you cuz it'll burn you out even if
[2:13:06.800 --> 2:13:10.880]  it's pharmaceutical grade but the stuff people use on the street because it's
[2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:16.720]  illegal because it's you know made in back rooms with with chemicals well to
[2:13:16.720 --> 2:13:22.560]  be technical I shouldn't digress they control the sub-ingredients to metham
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:26.320] phetamine and so people can't get those so they have to take instead of two or
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:30.520]  three ingredients they gotta have 10 15 ingredients and these people most of them
[2:13:30.520 --> 2:13:33.760]  you know aren't chemists or they don't have the proper tools even if they did it
[2:13:33.760 --> 2:13:37.560]  was hard to do they don't separate all the poison out they don't separate all
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.360]  the chemicals out and get what they need so you're you and methamphetamine
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:49.120]  you're out of your minds if you're using bathtub you know basement methamphetamine
[2:13:49.120 --> 2:13:52.680]  I mean you are out of your minds I mean you use the pharmaceutical stuff you
[2:13:52.680 --> 2:13:59.840]  end up like Elvis you or John F. Kennedy was on it as well you use the street
[2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:03.880]  stuff you're out of your mind that stuff kills those people so fast their teeth
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:07.280]  falls out they're basically zombies running around want more methamphetamine
[2:14:07.280 --> 2:14:11.320]  because you might as well just drink Drano folks it is so bad just a public
[2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:14.280]  service announcement they're right there for you but that's why they go after
[2:14:14.280 --> 2:14:18.640]  marijuana and methamphetamine so bad because they don't control it and so
[2:14:18.640 --> 2:14:22.520]  that's how they corrupt these people into their systems and they pick up
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:26.280]  people for left-wing ideologies and they work within left-wing systems to carry
[2:14:26.280 --> 2:14:29.640]  out the New World Order when the left's in power and then they infiltrate the
[2:14:29.640 --> 2:14:33.120]  right and try to take over those groups to control that and the globalists are
[2:14:33.120 --> 2:14:40.120]  masters at getting good people to join them by believing a false narrative that
[2:14:40.120 --> 2:14:47.080]  they're given okay let's go to Steve in Chicago then we'll go to Josh Tim

[2:15:21.640 --> 2:15:26.000]  newscasts I think you're right in fact guys did you ever find the one about
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:30.400]  they'll arrest you in Missouri if you criticize Obama did you didn't find that
[2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:35.480]  we've played it many times John do you have it find it for me and then send to
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:40.240]  the guys they didn't have any luck okay sir up I mean are you saying Steve you
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:47.080]  confirmed this yes I did it it's been all over the press you see this is a
[2:15:47.080 --> 2:15:51.560]  White House black up you know what I'm saying this guy he's having his strings
[2:15:51.560 --> 2:15:56.560]  pulled by Obama and he said if you didn't vote there'd be arrest and
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:16:02.240]  intimidation and so this is what happens now I mean that I know a bunch of
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:07.520]  Missouri officials including the sheriff that that that that that that that
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:10.600]  cities and I haven't confirmed if it's cool and I'm not I'm not saying you're
[2:16:10.600 --> 2:16:14.920]  lying I just to confirm Oliver Glenn Glenn is like his nickname Oliver Glenn
[2:16:14.920 --> 2:16:22.240]  Boyer B. O. Y. E. R. so you know all about him well I've heard about him he's
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:29.600]  it it's reputable he's not one of us he's working for the the big companies in
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:36.520]  Obama the industrialist bankers here and there's no bankers well no I know that
[2:16:36.520 --> 2:16:39.320]  Obama's taking over all the local governments and communities I mean
[2:16:39.320 --> 2:16:42.760]  Bush helped build it for him and now it's going to jump level it's like you
[2:16:42.760 --> 2:16:47.320]  know they built the platform and then Obama's launching the system and they
[2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:50.320]  really are federalizing everything they really are getting GPS readings
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:54.080]  everybody's doors they really are can you believe that they've introduced bills
[2:16:54.080 --> 2:16:59.560]  to ban anybody that when government just lists you as an extremist you can't on
[2:16:59.560 --> 2:17:03.400]  guns anymore I mean they've they've actually are trying it while saying on
[2:17:03.400 --> 2:17:08.560]  the news there's no new gun bills there's no new gun bills so everybody
[2:17:08.560 --> 2:17:14.560]  stands down while they try to pass it I just think this should be exposed
[2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:19.000]  because now you see who's pulling the strings well you know it's driving me
[2:17:19.000 --> 2:17:21.920]  crazy I didn't put this in the Obama deception I mean I could have made it
[2:17:21.920 --> 2:17:25.160]  even worse but people wouldn't believe it about how they were intimidating
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:27.960]  people but it's gonna be in the new film because they're still intimidating
[2:17:27.960 --> 2:17:33.440]  people and I've no doubt it's the White House that's got our YouTube channels
[2:17:33.440 --> 2:17:36.200]  and other channels being shut down in mass I appreciate your call Steve
[2:17:36.200 --> 2:17:39.840]  reason I know that is it's been in the press that they keep calling small
[2:17:39.840 --> 2:17:43.880]  compared to us people a few million views compared to our tens and tens and
[2:17:43.880 --> 2:17:47.960]  tens of millions to the White House telling him this is disturbing what
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:53.640]  you're doing I don't want you to do these blogs and the White House has their
[2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:56.440]  own YouTube channel they're obsessed with YouTube he does YouTube only
[2:17:56.440 --> 2:18:02.280]  transmissions I mean they know that's the future and we have just gone so viral
[2:18:02.280 --> 2:18:06.560]  on YouTube especially that they are censoring us and and that's coming up
[2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:09.800]  next hour I promise to get to your calls right now but this is driving me
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:15.400]  crazy there's a bunch of newscast out of Kansas was linked on drugs report it
[2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:20.280]  made national news let me think of the exact headline hold on this is a good
[2:18:20.280 --> 2:18:23.000]  exercise we do on air because it gets listeners to go look it up for themselves
[2:18:23.000 --> 2:18:34.120]  it was man it's driving me crazy I can't remember the exact headline John no
[2:18:34.120 --> 2:18:40.360]  luck no dice this was this was just I mean info wars calm prison planet calm
[2:18:40.360 --> 2:18:48.640]  wrote stories about it we covered it at nauseam man it drives me crazy let's go
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:53.240]  ahead and take another call here let's talk to Josh in Oklahoma go ahead yeah
[2:18:53.240 --> 2:18:59.120]  I'm one of our listeners that saw your videos on YouTube and so just kind of
[2:18:59.120 --> 2:19:02.640]  been awake in the last couple of months one topic I've never heard you address
[2:19:02.640 --> 2:19:08.680]  is peaking of global oil production how this you know that the oil is going to
[2:19:08.680 --> 2:19:12.640]  become a more limited resource how it's going to play into the global elites
[2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:18.000]  plans anybody out there that's not familiar with it I'd suggest you look
[2:19:18.000 --> 2:19:21.960]  up Matt Simmons on Google or go to life after the oil crash that net for more
[2:19:21.960 --> 2:19:26.920]  information I'm just interested in your opinion okay well I hate to disagree with
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:32.920]  you but but we have the facts peak oil is a fraud there is more oil now they've
[2:19:32.920 --> 2:19:36.840]  discovered ever before but you're right in that they're creating artificial
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:41.400]  scarcity and artificial scarcity stay there we'll come back to you we did find
[2:19:41.400 --> 2:19:45.400]  it tell her the bottle bomb in Missouri go to jail is the Kurt Nemo
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:50.000]  headline and again folks when I get frustrated it's because I burn with
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:53.440]  exposing these people I know everything I'm saying is documented I know it
[2:19:53.440 --> 2:19:57.800]  sounds insane they got bills introduced to ban any guns they want they got bills
[2:19:57.800 --> 2:20:00.760]  introduced were conservatives won't be able to buy own guns anymore it's all

[2:24:17.120 --> 2:24:21.120]  kidnapping rings run by the federal government and I'm gonna detail it from
[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:25.720]  mainstream news sources what is really admitted and why Obama's about to
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:29.240]  release more photos I'll tell you right now these are the white washes this is
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:33.720]  how they limit things it's kind of like you put an oil fire out with a stick of
[2:24:33.720 --> 2:24:39.880]  dynamite you fight fire with fire they they release this stuff Abu Ghraib had
[2:24:39.880 --> 2:24:43.160]  already broken in Europe troops were blowing the whistle there's thousands
[2:24:43.160 --> 2:24:46.920]  of videos and audios Congress admitted that's what was reported of the troops
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:49.880]  ordered to rape children in front of their parents and that's confirmed it's
[2:24:49.880 --> 2:24:54.240]  in the Army's own report but you never never see them the nightly news it's
[2:24:54.240 --> 2:24:58.960]  been in major newspapers but that's it so we're gonna go over that tell you what's
[2:24:58.960 --> 2:25:01.680]  really happening there and the gun grabbing the attack on the First
[2:25:01.680 --> 2:25:06.280]  Amendment and free speech worldwide but going back to peak oil I have family
[2:25:06.280 --> 2:25:09.840]  that are petroleum geologists family that's worked in oil fields is rough necks
[2:25:09.840 --> 2:25:14.040]  you know right up to plant managers there's oil everywhere they drill gas
[2:25:14.040 --> 2:25:18.440]  wells oil all the time and they just cap them from Oklahoma to the South Dakota
[2:25:18.440 --> 2:25:25.000]  to Texas they're everywhere that you know the North Sea Russia the stands in
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:30.760]  Central Asia but the globalist the Club of Rome do say they're artificially
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:35.720]  cutting off resources and telling us there's no oil and so they'd rather
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:43.200]  sell us a gallon of oil the gallon of gas refined from oil for 20 bucks instead
[2:25:43.200 --> 2:25:48.480]  of sell us you know 10 gallons for 20 bucks they it's just like diamonds are
[2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:52.640]  semi-precious but they advertise that there's nowhere to be found and oh my
[2:25:52.640 --> 2:25:56.880]  gosh it's you know mortgage your house to buy one it's just so important when
[2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:02.040]  it's a semi precious stone in the same range as agate or or or or you know
[2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:07.240]  rhinestones but yes they are artificially bringing us back to a post
[2:26:07.240 --> 2:26:10.640]  industrial world that is what my film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:26:10.640 --> 2:26:15.240]  covers anything else Josh I just think that I mean since 1970 American
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:19.320]  domestic production has been declining that's that just seems to me undeniable
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:24.400]  we import two-thirds of the oil that we use and so I'm okay let's stop right
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:30.920]  there they allow one pipeline from Alaska it's admitted that that the whole
[2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:35.200]  place has more oil than Saudi Arabia it doesn't hurt the environment at all to
[2:26:35.200 --> 2:26:39.000]  pump that stuff right out of the ground and and and through pipelines the
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  caribou use it as shelter out there all there are is caribou and mosquitoes
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:48.320]  basically and it's all capped and most of the Gulf of Mexico is off limits to
[2:26:48.320 --> 2:26:55.080]  drilling 1,600 square mile area has more oil than Iraq and that's on record I
[2:26:55.080 --> 2:26:59.680]  mean you understand how many areas are off limits to drilling sir yeah yeah
[2:26:59.680 --> 2:27:03.480]  I mean Saudi Arabia produces I think 10 to 12 million barrels a day I think the
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:07.680]  maximum that anybody would expect to come out of Alaska's around a million to
[2:27:07.680 --> 2:27:12.880]  1.3 million barrels a day that's in 10 years time so no that's what Congress
[2:27:12.880 --> 2:27:16.520]  says they says if we drilled everywhere now there'd be a 1% increase and they
[2:27:16.520 --> 2:27:22.120]  give no facts hey bro listen how did you get sold on this peak oil thing I mean
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:29.440]  do you believe diamonds do you believe diamonds are our precious I know I mean
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:35.000]  they're rare no they're not even right effective value artificial scarcity do
[2:27:35.000 --> 2:27:38.720]  you know what that is well except the diamonds aren't aren't a consumable oil
[2:27:38.720 --> 2:27:47.880]  is and so actually I was are used in many industrial uses I mean you know
[2:27:47.880 --> 2:27:50.760]  there's diamonds all over the United States there's diamonds all over Canada
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:56.640]  and no one's allowed to mine them okay well I mean I'm missing the parallel
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:27:59.760]  though you know the big oil companies finance all the fake environmental
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:05.120]  groups every time they find diamonds in Arkansas or Alaska or Canada or Texas
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:10.840]  they declare it a while I preserve and and it's actually big oil publicly
[2:28:10.840 --> 2:28:14.720]  finances the fake global warming movement Rex Tillerson Exxon mobile
[2:28:14.720 --> 2:28:18.560]  heads as it's real we've got to have a global warming tax we've got a tax
[2:28:18.560 --> 2:28:24.480]  carbon I mean do you believe that I don't believe in global warming well I mean
[2:28:24.480 --> 2:28:27.600]  that it would be the summer times here I mean it is warming I mean but that's
[2:28:27.600 --> 2:28:31.480]  natural yeah yeah I mean I don't believe in art of the global warming but but the
[2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:37.400]  two are separate and so they're just real world limitations to the amount of
[2:28:37.400 --> 2:28:40.520]  oil we're gonna be able to pull out of the ground in the next 10 to 20 years
[2:28:40.520 --> 2:28:47.480]  you know are you a petroleum geologist no no I'm not but but it's it's really
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:54.600]  just a matter of looking at the numbers there there it's I don't see how it would
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:28:59.040]  be way too complex or have you read the Associated Press lawsuit documents where
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.920]  they got the four-year documents from the Big Ten oil companies and from 1995
[2:29:03.920 --> 2:29:09.320]  and 96 broken the AP in 2000 where they swear their internal documents in
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:14.280]  meetings as a as a oligopoly or a combine they report in there you can
[2:29:14.280 --> 2:29:21.160]  just search engine AP oil companies buying up refineries artificial bottleneck
[2:29:21.160 --> 2:29:25.880]  and they say there's too much oil we've got to buy up refineries worldwide and the
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:30.520]  U.S. to create an artificial bottleneck and then control for environmental

[2:33:28.360 --> 2:33:35.840]  reaching down my whole point the break cut off was that on record it was the
[2:33:35.840 --> 2:33:41.240]  big importers of opium and cocaine and other drugs that were sold in drug
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:45.760]  stores everywhere people really weren't using their drugs the word was out they
[2:33:45.760 --> 2:33:49.080]  were bad for you they're trying to put them in all the soft drinks push them on
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:53.400]  kids that wasn't working too well this is all on record dr. Pepper had cocaine
[2:33:53.400 --> 2:33:56.480]  other stuff in it so to coca-cola you don't believe me that's why coke's
[2:33:56.480 --> 2:34:02.680]  called coke I assure you had high levels of cocaine in it the mystery secret
[2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:06.920]  ingredient because the cattle aren't ready to hear it is denatured cocaine
[2:34:06.920 --> 2:34:13.520]  and coca-cola and Pepsi it's like decaf it's decokinated they just made it
[2:34:13.520 --> 2:34:17.520]  illegal to jack up the price and that's what love the global warming carbon
[2:34:17.520 --> 2:34:20.600]  taxes they're gonna tax the daylights out of they're gonna say it's bad for the
[2:34:20.600 --> 2:34:24.560]  earth carbon dioxide that you exhaled the toxic waste no it's not the plants
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:30.480]  breathe there is oil everywhere I mean ladies and gentlemen they drill all
[2:34:30.480 --> 2:34:34.200]  over Texas and almost everywhere they drill depending on how deep they go
[2:34:34.200 --> 2:34:38.600]  there's an oil field from Fort Worth down to Houston everywhere they drill
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:43.800]  they're hitting oil at two three levels and natural gas it's just you know look
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:49.480]  my family's from Texas okay both my grandfathers worked as rough necks you

[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:20.560]  been skiing and we took her we got an RV my parents my grandma last living
[2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:26.000]  grandparent we all got out to Riyadosa and one of my daughters who only had one
[2:35:26.000 --> 2:35:29.720]  dollar time got a cold we knew high altitude 9,000 feet wasn't good for a
[2:35:29.720 --> 2:35:36.160]  cold just cold so we came home so that for Christmas we're sitting there in
[2:35:36.160 --> 2:35:39.880]  Roswell at a Denny's with horrible service looking like an hour and a half
[2:35:39.880 --> 2:35:43.800]  to bring us eggs or something and we're sitting there and she goes oh yeah I
[2:35:43.800 --> 2:35:48.080]  remember when Bill that's my grandfather worked in the petroleum building
[2:35:48.080 --> 2:35:55.200]  right there forget I forget for what a well company and back in 1947 or whatever

[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:17.960]  remember when they had something under a big tarp on a truck and they said it was
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:23.280]  martial law there were soldiers with machine guns in the town how weird is it
[2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:26.720]  my grandmother was in Roswell and all that went on and I don't cover UFOs well
[2:36:26.720 --> 2:36:30.560]  I don't know what happened the point is it's funny oh now it's gonna be that I'm

[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:03.280]  and if we just move forward against the globalist and what their policies are
[2:37:03.280 --> 2:37:08.040]  whether it's reptoids from planet Pop Tart or whoever that runs it then we can
[2:37:08.040 --> 2:37:11.560]  get all Americans and people the world together to defeat globalization which is

[2:43:40.360 --> 2:43:46.440]  my radio show here in Austin and Ted Anderson was the main sponsor of a
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:49.360]  little bitty satellite network that happened on the short web in a few
[2:43:49.360 --> 2:43:53.060]  AM and FM's and I got on that and then Ted expanded it set up a new network in
[2:43:53.060 --> 2:43:58.800]  98 and it's been there behind me all along and has literally been at the
[2:43:58.800 --> 2:44:03.920]  point five six years ago where he had to mortgage his house to keep the network
[2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:08.040]  going and you know he's been in the precious metal business for 31 years
[2:44:08.040 --> 2:44:14.440]  and he's gone from almost going bankrupt to now being one of the fastest
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:17.400]  growing and one of the biggest in the top 10 gold and silver brokers in the
[2:44:17.400 --> 2:44:20.440]  country and he's done that and we're gonna spend just a few minutes with him
[2:44:20.440 --> 2:44:23.360]  and go back to your calls and get into all that news I promised he's been
[2:44:23.360 --> 2:44:29.120]  able to do that because Ted Anderson buys when gold and silver is low and
[2:44:29.120 --> 2:44:32.680]  then sells it at the low price when it's high that's Ted Anderson secret
[2:44:32.680 --> 2:44:35.680]  everybody else not everybody but everybody I know about believe me I
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:38.680]  shop around when I buy some gold and silver which I do every few months a
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:42.720]  few coins here a few coins there because you can't trust the banks folks they're
[2:44:42.720 --> 2:44:45.840]  devaluing the currency I've shopped around and I've never found a better deal
[2:44:45.840 --> 2:44:50.440]  I get from Ted because other places when gold goes up they buy low too and they
[2:44:50.440 --> 2:44:53.960]  sit there and hoard it when gold goes up they raise the price with silver goes
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:57.440]  up that they raise the price Ted sells out of what he had at the lower price
[2:44:57.440 --> 2:45:01.960]  and then buys and has to go up sometimes and that just happened with silver but
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:04.800]  it's still at a price much lower and you'll find anywhere and it's Lakota's
[2:45:04.800 --> 2:45:08.440]  that are sold out everywhere these are $25 a piece everywhere else Ted's got
[2:45:08.440 --> 2:45:15.040]  them for 19 same thing with gold Ted Anderson speaking of support not only
[2:45:15.040 --> 2:45:18.160]  do folks get a great deal it also supports the network that you've poured
[2:45:18.160 --> 2:45:21.520]  everything into and you know it takes a lot to not be one of the big
[2:45:21.520 --> 2:45:24.760]  establishment networks and do what you've done Ted what is it Genesis has
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:29.360]  over 350 affiliates now between all the shows and growing I mean I tell you Ted
[2:45:29.360 --> 2:45:33.160]  you've done something that other big networks operate on tens of billions of
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:37.040]  dollars you've done this for just a couple million dollars a year with the
[2:45:37.040 --> 2:45:41.560]  network even less I've just got to commend you Ted Anderson well thanks a lot
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:46.560]  Alex I mean it you know obviously takes a lot of long hard hours of work just
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:50.760]  like you guys do I mean it but if you hang in there and you're tenacious
[2:45:50.760 --> 2:45:54.640]  enough that you know you win especially when you're doing the right thing rather
[2:45:54.640 --> 2:45:58.720]  than the wrong thing but yeah you're right about the gold and silver market
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:02.600]  we were talking last week and you're asking about asking me about what you
[2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:08.520]  can buy and you see I had about $600,000 worth of British sovereigns and
[2:46:08.520 --> 2:46:13.360]  Frank's and the price that I offered them to you at last week when gold was
[2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:18.280]  around 880 is the same price that I'm offering them right now when gold is at
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:23.800]  900 well personally presently right now gold last time I printed it off you
[2:46:23.800 --> 2:46:29.560]  let me look 923 80 hit a high today of 924 80 since I printed off the sheet on
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:33.480]  what's going on in gold you can pick these things off I mean this is like
[2:46:33.480 --> 2:46:38.200]  picking my pockets really the British sovereigns right now at 267 the Franks
[2:46:38.200 --> 2:46:43.520]  right now 214 that is the same price when gold was at 880 plus also you're
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:47.160]  right about that I do have the I do have the Lakota nation silver rounds they're
[2:46:47.160 --> 2:46:53.800]  actually at $19.66 and silver now rather than being at $11 an ounce now the
[2:46:53.800 --> 2:47:00.520]  silver is at my I need reading glasses Alex it's been as high as $14.34
[2:47:00.520 --> 2:47:06.040]  today so I mean big increases obviously a reflection of what happens when you
[2:47:06.040 --> 2:47:10.360]  take a fiat currency and you turn on the printing press but you still have the
[2:47:10.360 --> 2:47:14.160]  Lincolns because you were saying that was the best deal well right now they're not
[2:47:14.160 --> 2:47:17.640]  the Lincolns it's the Franklin half-dollar I mean I I do have that and
[2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:22.920]  that still is at the price I mean there I had the Lakota's at $17 7 as a
[2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:26.400]  Lincoln's I meant the Franklin's yeah the Lincoln the Lincoln is a penny
[2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:30.680]  obviously but no I know I'm losing my mind yeah well I can't keep track of it
[2:47:30.680 --> 2:47:33.920]  all now what about the Lakota's that's why is that coin so hot I mean it's a
[2:47:33.920 --> 2:47:40.160]  gorgeous coin well it's a hot Native American warrior on the front and it's
[2:47:40.160 --> 2:47:43.720]  got the buffalo on the back that's a silver coin it's 25 plus dollars on
[2:47:43.720 --> 2:47:47.600]  eBay and other places you've got them at 19 yeah well I mean the reason why they're
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:52.560]  hot is because you have a privately private nation that is issuing a private
[2:47:52.560 --> 2:47:56.520]  currency that's competing with the Federal Reserve note and you know I
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:00.600]  everybody knows you know what the Federal Reserve is about and I think
[2:48:00.600 --> 2:48:04.160]  we're all hungry to see something new and different and the United States of
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:09.960]  America is going exactly the wrong direction and and and should be it
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:14.040]  should be dumping the Fed and going back to constitutional money and now the
[2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:19.440]  now the Lakota nation decides to issue a coin that resembles what our
[2:48:19.440 --> 2:48:23.400]  Constitution should be you know what our US government should be doing with the
[2:48:23.400 --> 2:48:28.200]  constitutional money and I no surprise to me people want it and they want it in
[2:48:28.200 --> 2:48:33.280]  a big way that coin is a great coin it's beautiful I mean the mere finish with
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:36.800]  the Indian head on the front and the and the buffalo on the reverse I mean it
[2:48:36.800 --> 2:48:41.120]  has seen a picture just doesn't do justice for it it's a very very pretty
[2:48:41.120 --> 2:48:46.000]  coin okay now you sold out of them at 17 bucks you're getting close to selling
[2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:50.560]  them out at 19 how long can you hold that deal for folks well I mean I can
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:48:54.160]  tell you right now I'll be able to hold on to this deal at least tell tonight and
[2:48:54.160 --> 2:48:58.040]  I and I would imagine it in tomorrow because last time I picked them up it
[2:48:58.040 --> 2:49:02.680]  was about the quantity of 5,000 coins and I just know about how long it takes for
[2:49:02.680 --> 2:49:06.320]  me to sell out on those it'll probably take me about a day maybe a day and a
[2:49:06.320 --> 2:49:10.680]  half but if you really really want to take advantage of something that is just
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:15.200]  a fabulous price and a great deal those British sovereigns and Frank's and the
[2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:19.960]  gold and then there you know those Frank let's explain you got gold 40 plus
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:25.480]  dollars less than what it's currently trading for you know factored in with the
[2:49:25.480 --> 2:49:31.280]  price I mean you cannot beat that deal 800 686 2237 it's there on screen
[2:49:31.280 --> 2:49:37.200]  800 686 2237 or modest resources dot com but tell them it's the Ted
[2:49:37.200 --> 2:49:41.320]  Anderson special to make sure you get that price or it will be the current
[2:49:41.320 --> 2:49:46.080]  price which is increasing silver and in gold and Ted I just so firmly believe
[2:49:46.080 --> 2:49:51.280]  in this I mean you know I bought what five rolls of the Lakota's last week
[2:49:51.280 --> 2:49:56.480]  because that's kind of the you know poor man's gold is silver and you know I just
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:49:58.840]  every few months get a little bit of coin here a little bit of coin there
[2:49:58.840 --> 2:50:04.960]  because the you know the dollar is in deep trouble by design and I just hope
[2:50:04.960 --> 2:50:08.600]  folks don't trust this system I hope people will hedge their bets and get
[2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:12.240]  partially out of the stock market and out of these uninsured annuities and
[2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:15.800]  get into silver and gold physically holding it you know the whole media
[2:50:15.800 --> 2:50:19.440]  tells you don't do this there's a reason look how gold's gone up from 300
[2:50:19.440 --> 2:50:23.720]  dollars an ounce the 900 something dollars an ounce the last five years this
[2:50:23.720 --> 2:50:28.080]  is the best bet I think out there period and if folks don't hedge their bets
[2:50:28.080 --> 2:50:38.000]  they are frankly a moronic 800 686 2237 800 686 2237 Ted Anderson thank you so

[2:51:10.880 --> 2:51:14.920]  summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid some
[2:51:14.920 --> 2:51:18.600]  say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the
[2:51:18.600 --> 2:51:23.360]  grid over its edge creating a cascade of power outages across the country putting

[3:00:18.680 --> 3:00:25.160]  and more of it is pouring in but three is the charm I was talking about Tony
[3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:29.160]  Montana in the movie Scarface which I think is an excellent film it's accurate
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:33.160]  he goes they're the ones that do it they've been doing a thousand years the
[3:00:33.160 --> 3:00:37.480]  bankers he's talking about how the government deals the drugs and how they
[3:00:37.480 --> 3:00:42.960]  just wander his money you know Oliver Stone to write that screenplay he went
[3:00:42.960 --> 3:00:45.720]  and actually lived with some of the cartel owners for a year related his
[3:00:45.720 --> 3:00:52.400]  research that's why the movie is so accurate but it's kind of a composite
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:57.440]  kind of like the Patriots a composite of three real characters from South
[3:00:57.440 --> 3:01:00.600]  Carolina North Carolina the Revolutionary War Tony Montana is a
[3:01:00.600 --> 3:01:04.040]  composite of some real stories like that chainsaw story you watch the
[3:01:04.040 --> 3:01:07.240]  director's cut they describe it with you know it was a real case when they're
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:11.920]  sawing the guy's head of the chainsaw so let's finish up with this three's the
[3:01:11.920 --> 3:01:15.600]  charm play it from the start unedited because we keep getting interrupted here
[3:01:15.600 --> 3:01:19.600]  is Tony Montana who is a radical extremist now he doesn't like
[3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:23.480]  communism he doesn't like the bankers doesn't like being a slave so if he
[3:01:23.480 --> 3:01:26.960]  ever became a citizen he can't have a second amendment they've got those
[3:01:26.960 --> 3:01:54.680]  bills introduced so here it is
[3:01:54.680 --> 3:01:57.560]  what do you want me to stay there and do nothing
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:06.440]  I'm Tony Montana a political prisoner from Cuba and I want my human right now

[3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:09.360]  network
[3:08:18.360 --> 3:08:23.080]  Jason Burmese just showed me a Fox news clip where they shoot the kid in the
[3:08:23.080 --> 3:08:26.920]  back it was playing cops and rompers and then the cop tackles even puts him in
[3:08:26.920 --> 3:08:31.440]  cuffs it's like the video of the guy they shoot in the back who's restrained and
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:35.200]  not resisting an Oakland then the cops lied and said that he'd attack them
[3:08:35.200 --> 3:08:38.360]  because they didn't know there were cameras they confiscated the surveillance
[3:08:38.360 --> 3:08:42.760]  cameras from the bus terminal and then lie but then two different cameras that
[3:08:42.760 --> 3:08:45.880]  were in trains driving by and somebody down the platform showed it was a lie
[3:08:45.880 --> 3:08:50.000]  same thing in East Austin cops gunned some kid down yesterday there were
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:54.280]  riots they were attacking police cars because of course Arte Cervantes is the
[3:08:54.280 --> 3:08:59.200]  cameras were off in all the squad cars they're always off but in the case of
[3:08:59.200 --> 3:09:03.400]  the these other cases that I mean that's coming I don't want to fight with the
[3:09:03.400 --> 3:09:07.600]  cops but it didn't used to be like this where it was just constant cops shooting
[3:09:07.600 --> 3:09:11.000]  people in the back most of them are back from Fallujah where that was a daily
[3:09:11.000 --> 3:09:15.040]  occurrence and you got awards for doing it so this clip's coming up after I
[3:09:15.040 --> 3:09:18.440]  finish up with this call order and then I've got I heard you last night what's
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:24.200]  what made me think of this Jason is I was driving home about 1130 1145 was
[3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:27.760]  into the show and you were saying by the way here's the Seymour Hirsch New Yorker
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:31.160]  magazine here's salon here's all these other news articles the Army's own
[3:09:31.160 --> 3:09:34.640]  reported midst they raped children from their parents to make them talk and then
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:38.600]  you get emails I get emails saying we're lying I mean no folks weren't we're not
[3:09:38.600 --> 3:09:42.360]  lying you know you have to understand this it's like when I get up and say
[3:09:42.360 --> 3:09:48.680]  Baxter pharmaceutical or excuse me Bayer pharmaceutical knowingly shipped out factor
[3:09:48.680 --> 3:09:52.840]  rate knowing it had HIV that's been on MSNBC AP Reuters Australian news
[3:09:52.840 --> 3:09:56.960]  knowingly killed all these people folks we would be sued if that wasn't true
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:00.360]  what is we're not making any of this up but I'm gonna go back over that today
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:04.720]  coming up and I got to get to it but a Burma's tell us what's coming up with
[3:10:04.720 --> 3:10:07.880]  this video clip sure you know I couldn't believe it somebody I get all these
[3:10:07.880 --> 3:10:11.600]  news clips Alex people are constantly giving me tips and someone sends me this
[3:10:11.600 --> 3:10:16.240]  thing yeah these kids playing cops and robbers with his friends and the police
[3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:21.080]  officer apparently is on a robbery call I don't know how that works as nothing
[3:10:21.080 --> 3:10:24.720]  was being robbed and he just gets out sees the kid shoots him and then throws
[3:10:24.720 --> 3:10:28.920]  him on the ground and coughs him I mean you know you you mentioned that guy in
[3:10:28.920 --> 3:10:32.280]  Oakland he said the cameras never work you're right the cameras didn't work
[3:10:32.280 --> 3:10:36.480]  supposedly in the subway thank God we have cell phones in this day and then
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:39.800]  they lied they lied they said he assaulted the cops he's on his hand
[3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:43.080]  cup on the ground and they just kill him and then the cop gets mad and it's
[3:10:43.080 --> 3:10:46.400]  wrestling his dead body around and slamming him when he's bleeding at that
[3:10:46.400 --> 3:10:51.600]  time and then like cuffing him and I mean I got footage of cops breaking pro
[3:10:51.600 --> 3:10:55.240]  life for his arms and they pull out the only clubs and kind of oh I mean I'm
[3:10:55.240 --> 3:10:59.120]  serious it's like some kind of sadistic crazy man what about what about the
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:04.120]  critical mass protest where they have the permits they're riding the bikes and
[3:11:04.120 --> 3:11:06.880]  out of nowhere our cop just picks a random biker I mean you couldn't have
[3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:10.480]  seen him 10 seconds beforehand they're traveling at a pretty good pace he just
[3:11:10.480 --> 3:11:15.280]  bows up undercuts him and just but it's worse then they charge that guy with
[3:11:15.280 --> 3:11:19.600]  assaulting the cop the cop runs out of a group of cops tackles him the guys
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:22.560]  aren't even looking at him his head hits the ground blood pouring out in the
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:26.960]  cops are death to America death death death the bankers will rule you they
[3:11:26.960 --> 3:11:31.240]  will steal it all and we're not joking and then those cops that do that it's
[3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:35.240]  like the army recruiters and arm and Marine Corps recruiters in Denver in
[3:11:35.240 --> 3:11:39.040]  Houston in New York it's always the same it's they go I'm gonna arrest you if
[3:11:39.040 --> 3:11:43.160]  you don't sign up for military and the kids going my mom says you know the 17
[3:11:43.160 --> 3:11:46.400]  year old my mom and dad say I don't have to sign up I'm gonna arrest you right
[3:11:46.400 --> 3:11:51.120]  now I'm coming over you're gonna sign it and then and then they get promoted for
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:56.520]  lying and and lying to the kids the government is criminal in fact you know
[3:11:56.520 --> 3:12:00.400]  I'm gonna go back to the calls let's go ahead and play this video now go ahead
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:04.480]  and roll it a bunch up on screen guys it's bad enough but the story is the kid
[3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:09.920]  was playing cops and robbers with friends Bob exactly and no doubt it does
[3:12:09.920 --> 3:12:13.880]  kids lucky that he's alive doctors say he's gonna make it he has a single gun
[3:12:13.880 --> 3:12:17.400]  shot wound but he's in stable condition in the hospital he told sheriff's
[3:12:17.400 --> 3:12:21.720]  deputies he was playing this game of cops and robbers riding his bicycle
[3:12:21.720 --> 3:12:28.200]  holding a toy plastic handgun sheriff's deputies however didn't know that when
[3:12:28.200 --> 3:12:45.960]  they confronted him last night and apparently the neighbors didn't know
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:51.360]  that he had a plastic toy gun as well it was about 8 o'clock last night that
[3:12:51.360 --> 3:12:55.320]  they called 9-1-1 saying that someone was riding a bicycle around the
[3:12:55.320 --> 3:12:58.920]  neighborhood carrying what they believed to be a gun hit pause he's went out
[3:12:58.920 --> 3:13:01.840]  there again it's this hit pause it's this tattletale society I've had cops
[3:13:01.840 --> 3:13:06.760]  called on me putting my rifle in the back of my car to go shoot because the
[3:13:06.760 --> 3:13:11.760]  billboards everywhere say report illegal guns and and and they advertise as if
[3:13:11.760 --> 3:13:14.880]  all of America's New York City where there's a gunband where oh you got a
[3:13:14.880 --> 3:13:18.200]  gun you're going to jail and I've told that story many times this is how they
[3:13:18.200 --> 3:13:23.400]  do it by perception and and and I've seen several stories where they arrest
[3:13:23.400 --> 3:13:28.920]  cops now arrest kids in fact Google you search I must stop saying Google because
[3:13:28.920 --> 3:13:31.200]  they'll probably shut down searching soon or restrict it and they're already
[3:13:31.200 --> 3:13:37.800]  starting to see that actually a YouTube search engine I'm losing my mind
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:42.760]  dog piles a good one dog pile dog parlors or screwgull.org do a search
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:47.920]  engine guys I want to show folks this child arrested for toy gun and the cops
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:52.680]  say we're charging with a death threat he pointed to the green plastic alien
[3:13:52.680 --> 3:13:58.160]  blasted gun the officer saw the weapon and moved in against the suspect
[3:13:58.160 --> 3:14:02.360]  immediately. Now go ahead and show the go ahead and show that it's his 10-year-old
[3:14:02.360 --> 3:14:08.440]  toy gun arrested fingerprinted here you go that's 11 news where is this out of
[3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:13.800]  a side of Georgia the latest case of a zero tolerance at the public schools as
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:18.360]  a 10-year-old student you know seriously in trouble I can't read it from
[3:14:18.360 --> 3:14:24.440]  across the room he had a cap gun a toy cowboy six-shooter I mean you know this
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:27.120]  is unbelievable you would think that the police would have a little more
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:31.920]  discernment of gunning so no it's zero no it's not about discernment they know
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:35.440]  it's ridiculous it's zero tolerance they arrest people for bringing plastic
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:39.440]  knives to school to cut up their lunch I'm talking about a kid on a bike and
[3:14:39.440 --> 3:14:43.680]  it doesn't matter he could have been El Cada it saved a lot of lives in fact
[3:14:43.680 --> 3:14:51.120]  finish up the Fox News Club El Cada member. Here old kid 20th Street and Avenue Q and
[3:14:51.120 --> 3:14:55.280]  according to Sheriff's deputies they ordered him to stop. Detectives say the
[3:14:55.280 --> 3:14:59.960]  teen got off of his bicycle and then pointed the gun at them the toy gun at
[3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:03.840]  them one of the deputies fearing for his life fired a single shot hitting them
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:07.920]  hitting him in the upper part of his body neighbors then describe what happened
[3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:14.080]  next. We should see the blood coming from about this area on his back and he was
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:19.160]  standing like this and he was rolling around. Rolling around in his own blood and
[3:15:19.160 --> 3:15:24.560]  sham cuffs on and the cuffs. We're just standing there not even making sure that
[3:15:24.560 --> 3:15:30.360]  the kid was dead or alive. A 15 year old boy rushed to the hospital of Providence
[3:15:30.360 --> 3:15:34.720]  Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills again in stable condition and
[3:15:34.720 --> 3:15:38.200]  doctors say he's expected to survive and now the investigation underway to
[3:15:38.200 --> 3:15:42.240]  determine if these deputies actions were warranted they're also trying to
[3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:46.440]  interview that 15 year old trying to figure out why in fact did he point that
[3:15:46.440 --> 3:15:53.080]  toy gun at deputies. They're going to say about Amara that the cameras were
[3:15:53.080 --> 3:15:56.560]  not on the car so they weren't working Jason. You know one of the bigger
[3:15:56.560 --> 3:16:01.080]  stories while you were gone was this 17 year old girl who calls 911 because her
[3:16:01.080 --> 3:16:05.400]  father just was in the hospital had a brain aneurysm and he starts having a
[3:16:05.400 --> 3:16:10.640]  seizure. The cop hangs up on her not once not twice three separate times while
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:15.480]  she's trying to get an ambulance for 911. She then runs to the police station
[3:16:15.480 --> 3:16:20.320]  where he is the only officer there and he immediately arrests her. I mean you
[3:16:20.320 --> 3:16:25.040]  cannot make this stuff up Jones. No because listen we have a criminal
[3:16:25.040 --> 3:16:28.800]  government and they've told the cops treat the nation like scum. You know I
[3:16:28.800 --> 3:16:32.760]  drove down to the beach and two separate times I'd be on I-35 with no cars
[3:16:32.760 --> 3:16:37.680]  around me going 72 miles an hour. Well no no no because that's speed limit 70 so I
[3:16:37.680 --> 3:16:41.280]  don't know I'm 70 miles over you know no no no they didn't pull me over well
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:46.800]  obviously is all kind of arms that's not a joke. Anyways cops I guess one of
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:50.640]  those called shirts it was a blue unmarked and then and then and the state
[3:16:50.640 --> 3:16:55.320]  police imagine you're on a two-lane or three-lane depending on which
[3:16:55.320 --> 3:16:59.920]  area you're in the slow lane and the cop just for pleasure with their lights
[3:16:59.920 --> 3:17:04.620]  comes flying right up on your hind end almost hits you and then this happened
[3:17:04.620 --> 3:17:09.320]  twice and then pulls it around and then keeps driving on and it's like they
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:12.880]  just are driving they're like oh I see a scum I think they're giving orders I'm
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:16.680]  gonna show a scum that he's a scum I'm gonna show this guy he's a slave that's
[3:17:16.680 --> 3:17:19.640]  what taking your shoes off or about answering questions when you go to the
[3:17:19.640 --> 3:17:23.000]  beach now they have literally dozens of cameras they ask you questions when you're
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:26.880]  going on the beach yeah look like big ol license plate scanners they indoctrinate
[3:17:26.880 --> 3:17:30.320]  your children in these dare camps summer camps are coming this year and the

[3:18:12.560 --> 3:18:19.440]  half yeah I just want to say I think they did that that bill we're talking
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:25.400]  about HR 2159 keeping away from and and they're saying it's based on the
[3:18:25.400 --> 3:18:31.160]  homeland security who puts on the terror watch list no no listen that's what
[3:18:31.160 --> 3:18:35.240]  the house chief of staff said we're gonna put you on a list if you're a
[3:18:35.240 --> 3:18:38.480]  conservative and you're not gonna own guns and if you don't like it we'll have
[3:18:38.480 --> 3:18:45.320]  paramilitary police kill you and your whole family go ahead slave I think that
[3:18:45.320 --> 3:18:49.280]  really shows how anybody that didn't think they were on the same team ought
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:55.920]  to look at that with ramen manual say in that a while ago and then you got he's
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:18:59.760]  a Democrat and then you got Republican Peter King comes out with that bill
[3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:04.600]  that's exactly what ramen manual said they were gonna do you know but but but
[3:19:04.600 --> 3:19:09.720]  anyway how do they get away with this terrorist watch list thing I mean that's
[3:19:09.720 --> 3:19:13.840]  what I was gonna ask them about well like who are American citizens on his
[3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:18.400]  hair watch this well and then they she said well yeah but don't worry she said
[3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:23.280]  this bill is not for law-abiding citizens and even if they you do get on
[3:19:23.280 --> 3:19:26.200]  there there's a way for you to challenge this and all I said well so you're
[3:19:26.200 --> 3:19:32.560]  innocent until proven guilty then like what what is this lit who are all these
[3:19:32.560 --> 3:19:36.920]  terrorists running around that might that are suspected this is this is this is
[3:19:36.920 --> 3:19:41.240]  that but this is irony because the right wing went along with the police state
[3:19:41.240 --> 3:19:45.120]  the torture of children thinking that it was you know for foreigners and now
[3:19:45.120 --> 3:19:48.360]  it's all gonna be used against them and the left's gonna go along with this
[3:19:48.360 --> 3:19:51.320]  thinking they're getting right wingers that's gonna happen to them it's for
[3:19:51.320 --> 3:19:55.280]  everybody no I hear you it's guilty until proven innocent you're not gonna have a
[3:19:55.280 --> 3:19:58.720]  job you're not gonna own a gun unless you've paid all your taxes and then

[3:24:12.280 --> 3:24:15.920]  yeah we found the clip where they were announcing on the news that you lied
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:20.920]  about Obama and the police would decide but they'll judge your jury you'd be
[3:24:20.920 --> 3:24:27.760]  arrested and the Obama campaign did the same thing in Missouri but they also did
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:33.120]  in Connecticut Vermont and it was on the news they just said look we're gonna
[3:24:33.120 --> 3:24:38.440]  arrest you if you criticize Obama and they put on the news with straight
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:42.880]  faces and now they say we're gonna decide if you hurt somebody's feelings
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:48.520]  we're gonna charge you with felonies and you're gonna pay everything you got to
[3:24:48.520 --> 3:24:52.480]  fire in banks and we'll kill you if you don't do it okay we're here to kill you
[3:24:52.480 --> 3:24:56.280]  we're here to take your kids and that's basically what America's turned into I
[3:24:56.280 --> 3:24:59.360]  mean it's called tyranny folks and you know this is just the beginning I mean
[3:24:59.360 --> 3:25:03.960]  the nice slide down into the cess has begun in fact let's go ahead do you have
[3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:08.560]  wrong a manual up let's play wrong a manual then I'll play the people won't
[3:25:08.560 --> 3:25:11.680]  believe it I'll play one of the newscast about how you don't have free speech and
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:17.360]  they say all this with a straight face we will arrest you we rule now you
[3:25:17.360 --> 3:25:23.040]  understand we don't care what you think we're we we you know you belong to us
[3:25:23.040 --> 3:25:27.280]  haha go ahead and play it
[3:25:27.280 --> 3:25:31.960]  I think we can do and we've got to make this a number one issue as a test vote
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:37.280]  and then take it into the election that is if you are on the no-fly list because
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:44.920]  you are known as maybe a post-terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in America
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:50.200]  let's stop right there he wrote a book saying national compulsory service
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:53.840]  they've introduced all that everything he wrote in his book everything he's

[3:33:58.760 --> 3:34:05.400]  rights the media says but you know they set the press in it which is wrong now
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:10.200]  it's everybody and most of the veterans I know can't buy guns anymore fact if
[3:34:10.200 --> 3:34:14.160]  you're a vet try to go out and buy one changes on they're gonna go sorry FBI

[3:34:34.260 --> 3:34:40.320]  gonna be all right I mean in Vermont in Connecticut in others states Missouri
[3:34:40.320 --> 3:34:46.040]  they get on the news and say we're law enforcement making sure we all we want to
[3:34:46.040 --> 3:34:53.280]  keep this campaign focused the way we want we're political officers and if we
[3:34:53.280 --> 3:34:57.360]  decide what you're saying we're keeping a close eye on what you say on radio and
[3:34:57.360 --> 3:35:04.040]  TV and we don't like it we're gonna go ahead and arrest you and that's what the
[3:35:04.040 --> 3:35:09.380]  American way is all about I mean this is just tyranny on steroids and there
[3:35:09.380 --> 3:35:14.320]  it's happening and again YouTube channels everywhere with hundreds of
[3:35:14.320 --> 3:35:18.560]  thousands of views big channels that separate people I mean I told people
[3:35:18.560 --> 3:35:24.080]  folks about and it's almost like I'm conditioned now to accept this I talked
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:28.080]  to Nate Evans his own channel since 2006 put a few of my videos on the
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:31.440]  director's account YouTube shut it down and didn't give him copyright
[3:35:31.440 --> 3:35:35.400]  violations they just said we're not we're taking your account away we're
[3:35:35.400 --> 3:35:38.320]  getting hundreds of emails from people that the same thing happened on YouTube
[3:35:38.320 --> 3:35:42.760]  and now Google announces they're ending the internet that they're ending video on
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:49.120]  their internet system and they're phasing out the you and YouTube to mainline
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:52.680]  TV shows and movies they've already moved most of the user videos off the
[3:35:52.680 --> 3:35:58.360]  main page they're doing it they've announced it this is happening let's go
[3:35:58.360 --> 3:36:03.340]  ahead and play Rahman annual grand paul is it really true that one fire from
[3:36:03.340 --> 3:36:08.080]  liking hold on pause of the back of it's in policy but back it up grand paul is it
[3:36:08.080 --> 3:36:13.680]  really true once we get on firearms yes once we did but don't let anybody hear
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:20.560]  the arrest us hold on a hover drone's flying over just face canvas I mean
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:24.880]  that's lit this is tyranny this is the norm everywhere else it's happening here
[3:36:24.880 --> 3:36:29.440]  criminals have taken over they own both parties I keep repeating that it's
[3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:33.600]  almost like a Mayday situation at this point and both parties are controller
[3:36:33.600 --> 3:36:37.720]  Republicans are standing down it's all staged look go ahead and play Rahman
[3:36:37.720 --> 3:36:42.400]  annual and now they've introduced the bill people say oh it will never pass I'm
[3:36:42.400 --> 3:36:46.600]  getting emails going I don't know this is credible yeah they introduced it Alex
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:50.360]  but it doesn't have much of a chance of passing on me and they've introduced
[3:36:50.360 --> 3:36:55.960]  bill to arrest you if they don't like what you say but it ain't gonna pass the
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:36:59.800]  point is they're trying it and a lot of the stuff is passing all right go ahead
[3:36:59.800 --> 3:37:05.120]  and play Rahman annual here it is one issue as a test vote and then take it
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:10.240]  into the election that is if you are on the no-fly list because you are known
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:24.200]  as maybe a possible terrorist you cannot buy a handgun in America and I have not
[3:37:24.200 --> 3:37:28.640]  one far from liking the mixing of politics and policy but as my old boss
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:32.920]  used to say give me that vote and throw me into that fryer patch I'll make
[3:37:32.920 --> 3:37:36.280]  politics out of that every day because if it's between that terror list
[3:37:36.280 --> 3:37:41.760]  terrorist list and the NRA I know where America is gonna be every time and
[3:37:41.760 --> 3:37:45.080]  they're gonna make the right choice and we have got to start building on that
[3:37:45.080 --> 3:37:48.840]  that is the right thing to take into the election it's the right policy if
[3:37:48.840 --> 3:37:53.680]  you're on that no-fly list your access to the right to bear arms is canceled
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:57.240]  because you're not part of the American family you don't deserve that right
[3:37:57.240 --> 3:38:01.560]  there is no right for you if you're on that terrorist let's stop right there
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:07.400]  number one number one issue now that's a 700,000 and it was a million as of a
[3:38:07.400 --> 3:38:12.560]  year ago six months ago the number was 1,100,000 in fact search engine for
[3:38:12.560 --> 3:38:19.200]  folks no-fly list reaches 1,000,000 you'll have articles from 2007 on that so I
[3:38:19.200 --> 3:38:23.480]  say 1,100,000 it's way above that and then they have 4 million plus names on a
[3:38:23.480 --> 3:38:27.560]  crime list that most of them aren't even convicted criminals and they say no car
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:33.520]  loan no house no apartment no job but the illegals are all exempt from this so
[3:38:33.520 --> 3:38:38.360]  I'm gonna put that up on screen for folks but this is all happening what is
[3:38:38.360 --> 3:38:41.480]  the bill number to arrest you under felony charges if someone says you
[3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:47.640]  hurt their feelings online this is HR 1966 it's also discriminatory it's only
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:53.920]  for internet people not the mainstream media HR 1966 what is the bill number to
[3:38:53.920 --> 3:38:58.200]  list everybody in the homeland security right wing extremist report as terrorists
[3:38:58.200 --> 3:39:07.200]  so they can't own firearms HR 21 59 okay check that out again the Defense
[3:39:07.200 --> 3:39:11.680]  Department AP and heritage dot org a vote reported that there's been a gag
[3:39:11.680 --> 3:39:15.480]  order given to all commissioned officers that they are not allowed to even talk
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:19.200]  to members of Congress about the budget before they would always call in brass
[3:39:19.200 --> 3:39:22.640]  and question them about what they thought the best weapons systems were and was
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:25.560]  the executive doing the right thing because Congress you know raises the
[3:39:25.560 --> 3:39:29.360]  money for that and then they declare war and the president executes and they've
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:32.120]  been told you're not allowed to talk to Congress just more of Congress being
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:37.000]  made to be ceremonial dovetailing with the PDD 51 saying that Congress is
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:40.880]  basically defunct so with the governors in the states under the John Warren

[3:44:01.480 --> 3:44:07.080]  ran the North com stuff on 9-11 General Myers is in there whitewashing and
[3:44:07.080 --> 3:44:10.840]  sucking on breath men's neurotically it's all a big joke to him this is why
[3:44:10.840 --> 3:44:13.120]  they went out for McKinney and put all that money against her to get her out
[3:44:13.120 --> 3:44:15.080]  of there because she'd ask real questions but it's not just McKinney
[3:44:15.080 --> 3:44:21.160]  saying this I had BBC AP you know Chicago Tribune were Dinecore Halliburton

[3:44:43.080 --> 3:44:47.560]  is gonna get worse but every time we talk about Obama says he's gonna release
[3:44:47.560 --> 3:44:51.040]  hundreds of new photos and you watch it'll be people in clown outfits or
[3:44:51.040 --> 3:44:56.640]  people naked with dogs biting them sounds bad or a dead body or something but
[3:44:56.640 --> 3:45:01.760]  they admit Congress has seen hundreds of videos thousands of photos of them

[3:45:25.920 --> 3:45:29.160]  him and talked about it I mean to get the general on sometime but it's hard to
[3:45:29.160 --> 3:45:32.000]  get him on about how they threatened him but he said well this is the report
[3:45:32.000 --> 3:45:34.920]  this is what happened and because he said he couldn't be part of it they were
[3:45:34.920 --> 3:45:39.200]  raping children with battery acid and it just just stuff out of Hellraiser stuff
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:42.880]  out of hostile haven't seen that movie but I've heard it described I mean stuff

[3:45:49.000 --> 3:45:52.840]  report how Antonio to goomba who investigated Abu Ghraib scandal became
[3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:56.600]  one of its casualties and they came after him and they killed a bunch of
[3:45:56.600 --> 3:45:59.960]  people too in the military videos amplified pictures of violence the

[3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:23.480]  understand you committed to the neocons that committed to evil and then because
[3:46:23.480 --> 3:46:27.360]  you did commit to evil you feel like you've shined on to yeah let's get rough
[3:46:27.360 --> 3:46:32.040]  and water bored of it's you know you know there's a clip up on front page
[3:46:32.040 --> 3:46:35.480]  magazine one of the neocons sites where it's got this Marine Corps officer going
[3:46:35.480 --> 3:46:40.680]  I love electrocuting people I love all of it I love torture oh it's so good
[3:46:40.680 --> 3:46:45.120]  they're all giggling and well I mean you know once you decide to torture people
[3:46:45.120 --> 3:46:49.000]  why not rape children and that's what they do and then we are the bad people
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:53.120]  who don't want to have the government raping children so here's Cynthia McKinney
[3:46:53.120 --> 3:46:56.780]  bringing all this up and and Rumsfeld just we put them in a penalty box
[3:46:56.780 --> 3:47:03.200]  down court didn't get contracts for a few months they're allowed to do it look
[3:47:03.200 --> 3:47:10.800]  bitch we got SWAT team standing by to kill you I mean that's basically the
[3:47:10.800 --> 3:47:13.680]  attitude and I'm sorry to talk like that but I'm trying to bring this home
[3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:18.120]  this is pure evil right out in the open Joseph Mingle of stuff and it's just
[3:47:18.120 --> 3:47:24.000]  Myers and Rumsfeld and and and just like they released the Abu Ghraib white
[3:47:24.000 --> 3:47:27.760]  washes when the raping was coming out from the Army reports they put out
[3:47:27.760 --> 3:47:31.200]  stuff so Limbaugh got on air and said they're just blowing off steam they're
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:38.560]  just having some fun here it is I think the gentleman the gentle lady from
[3:47:38.560 --> 3:47:46.320]  Georgia miss McKinney oh thank you mr. Chairman mr. Secretary I watched
[3:47:46.320 --> 3:47:52.880]  president Bush deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003
[3:47:52.880 --> 3:47:58.640]  in which he mission he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade the president
[3:47:58.640 --> 3:48:03.040]  called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business but
[3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:07.840]  at the very moment of that speech Dinecore was exposed for having been
[3:48:07.840 --> 3:48:12.800]  involved in the buying and selling of young women and children while all of
[3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:16.800]  this was going on Dinecore kept the Pentagon contract to administer the
[3:48:16.800 --> 3:48:22.680]  small pots and anthrax vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine through
[3:48:22.680 --> 3:48:28.160]  the joint vaccine acquisition program mr. Secretary is it policy of the US
[3:48:28.160 --> 3:48:31.880]  government to reward companies that traffic and women and little girls
[3:48:31.880 --> 3:48:36.640]  that's my first question my second question is the secretary according to
[3:48:36.640 --> 3:48:41.080]  the Comptroller General of the United States there are serious financial
[3:48:41.080 --> 3:48:46.120]  management problems at the Pentagon to which mr. Cooper alluded fiscal year
[3:48:46.120 --> 3:48:55.000]  1999 2.3 trillion missing fiscal year 2001.1 trillion missing and DOD is the
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:59.680]  number one reason why the government can't balance his checkbook the Pentagon
[3:48:59.680 --> 3:49:03.400]  has claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money
[3:49:03.400 --> 3:49:07.760]  is because its computers don't communicate with each other my second
[3:49:07.760 --> 3:49:13.360]  question mr. Secretary is who has the contracts today to make those systems
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:18.520]  communicate with each other how long have they had those contracts and how
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:23.520]  much have the taxpayers paid for them finally mr. Secretary after the last
[3:49:23.520 --> 3:49:28.520]  hearing I thought that my office was promised a written response to my
[3:49:28.520 --> 3:49:33.400]  question regarding the four war games on September 11 I have not yet received
[3:49:33.400 --> 3:49:38.160]  that response but would like for you to respond to the questions that I've put
[3:49:38.160 --> 3:49:43.120]  to you today and then I do expect the written response to my previous question
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:51.440]  hopefully by the end of the week thank you representative the first the
[3:49:51.440 --> 3:49:56.280]  answer to your first question is is no absolutely not the policy of the United
[3:49:56.280 --> 3:50:04.320]  States government is clear unambiguous and opposed to to the activities that
[3:50:04.320 --> 3:50:12.640]  you described the second question well how do you explain the fact that dying
[3:50:12.640 --> 3:50:17.760]  core and its successor companies have received and continue to receive
[3:50:17.760 --> 3:50:23.960]  government contracts I would have to go and and find the facts but there are
[3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:28.280]  laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts and
[3:50:28.280 --> 3:50:32.800]  there are times that corporations do things they should not do in which case
[3:50:32.800 --> 3:50:37.120]  they tend to be suspended for some period there are times then that that the
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:41.040]  under the laws and the rules and regulations for the that passed by the
[3:50:41.040 --> 3:50:45.120]  Congress and implemented by the executive branch that corporations can get
[3:50:45.120 --> 3:50:51.920]  off of the pen out of the penalty box if you will and and be permitted to engage
[3:50:51.920 --> 3:50:56.280]  in contracts with the government there dying core involved in grabbing over a
[3:50:56.280 --> 3:51:01.920]  million people where they went nobody knows don't like it swatting drop by so

[3:54:44.280 --> 3:54:47.360]  C-span years ago I was proud of YouTube hadn't taken it down I'm sure they will
[3:54:47.360 --> 3:54:51.040]  now this YouTube wants to be part of it I guess part of the cover-up what happened
[3:54:51.040 --> 3:54:55.120]  all these kids if they do I know they've either they've removed a lot of these
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:54:58.880]  videos because this one was one one we uploaded hadn't been it's a McKinney
[3:54:58.880 --> 3:55:07.200]  Grills Rumsfeld how many views is that got it's got a hundred and twenty three
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:15.480]  thousand and when we upload that 2006 the 2006 or 7 I can't see across the room
[3:55:15.480 --> 3:55:25.960]  2006 yeah I'm sure all the cent com guys will go alert Google to shut that down
[3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:30.080]  be careful cent com guys who admittedly spent all their time trying to shut us
[3:55:30.080 --> 3:55:35.800]  down do you really want to be part of that you mean you want to go stop people
[3:55:35.800 --> 3:55:40.040]  exposing the child kidnapping rings I mean do you really want to help censor
[3:55:40.040 --> 3:55:44.680]  that that that's a that's an important decision for you to make do you want to
[3:55:44.680 --> 3:55:49.360]  sign on to become an accomplice to that I'm pretty you probably do I mean once
[3:55:49.360 --> 3:55:54.600]  you commit to evil why not go all the way huh but would you look at all those
[3:55:54.600 --> 3:55:59.400]  little kids in the eyes you probably would you probably would all right well
[3:55:59.400 --> 3:56:03.520]  your masters are gonna hurt you real bad too so that's the important thing for
[3:56:03.520 --> 3:56:06.560]  you to remember and then they go on to say we're not gonna tell you where the
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:10.440]  trillions are and we're not gonna tell you about the norad drills we ran that
[3:56:10.440 --> 3:56:14.320]  day that's classified of the hijacked jets being flown to the exact same targets
[3:56:14.320 --> 3:56:18.480]  the exact same time oh yeah that's plausible and then the London bombings
[3:56:18.480 --> 3:56:25.360]  you have the exact same trains exact same bus exact same time exact same place
[3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:30.800]  exact same day attacked the same way with the government running a drill don't
[3:56:30.800 --> 3:56:33.320]  you know what that's for that's if other parts of the government caught the
[3:56:33.320 --> 3:56:36.120]  government carrying out the attack they would say they were taking part in a
[3:56:36.120 --> 3:56:42.200]  drill and government's been caught doing that before again it's real simple if
[3:56:42.200 --> 3:56:48.080]  they'll kill a million 300,000 Iraqis folks they will kill you they don't care
[3:56:48.080 --> 3:56:53.320]  about you they're into the fact that they hate life and hate you and all they
[3:56:53.320 --> 3:56:56.760]  care about some money the bankers give them money the bankers create out of
[3:56:56.760 --> 3:57:00.960]  fiat look I know we got Tony, Wendy, Rob, Dan, Dave and I said I take a lot of
[3:57:00.960 --> 3:57:07.080]  calls in we took quite a few but I got sidetracked with all this stuff I do
[3:57:07.080 --> 3:57:09.440]  want to encourage the listeners to keep fighting you know there's one way they
[3:57:09.440 --> 3:57:12.960]  can't stop you for now is they do shut down Google says no more video and
[3:57:12.960 --> 3:57:18.600]  they're phasing out YouTube for users Google announcement Google videos no
[3:57:18.600 --> 3:57:21.480]  longer accepting any new uploads to their system instead the video sharing
[3:57:21.480 --> 3:57:24.720]  services affirmable to YouTube made the tens of millions of videos that users
[3:57:24.720 --> 3:57:27.920]  have posted to YouTube video remain online available for viewing at least for
[3:57:27.920 --> 3:57:30.840]  the time being but they're going to shut that down we have internal folks inside
[3:57:30.840 --> 3:57:34.520]  so I told you about this months ago they were phasing it out Google release a
[3:57:34.520 --> 3:57:36.840]  statement saying Google video will continue to focus our mission on the
[3:57:36.840 --> 3:57:42.080]  search and search and search technology this move will allow Google video to
[3:57:42.080 --> 3:57:45.840]  spend more time on technologies to make the information contained in online
[3:57:45.840 --> 3:57:49.240]  web more available and accessible enabling users to search all kinds of
[3:57:49.240 --> 3:57:54.920]  videos across the web such a statement blatantly contradicts that that was the
[3:57:54.920 --> 3:57:58.560]  core of Google's video system and such a move only prevents such material for
[3:57:58.560 --> 3:58:02.840]  being easily accessible online yeah they banned our videos banned the hit
[3:58:02.840 --> 3:58:08.480]  counts all of it and they posted a fact page trying to explain this bizarre
[3:58:08.480 --> 3:58:14.640]  decision we got stories on that coming ounces get your calls tomorrow 11 a.m.
