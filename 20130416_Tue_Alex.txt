[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.520 --> 00:29.400]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:29.400 --> 00:37.400]  It is 11 a.m. Central Standard Time on the 16th day of April 2013. I am your host, Alex
[00:37.400 --> 00:45.000]  Jones, and we are going to be live here for the next 10, 11 hours or so. And again, in
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.840]  the future, we're going to have even more reporters and crew. We'll be able to easily
[00:47.840 --> 00:53.760]  go 24 hours straight or longer. But this is the big official foundation of our entire
[00:53.760 --> 00:59.840]  media operation to awaken humanity to the globalist peril. This is the big radio show.
[00:59.840 --> 01:09.760]  We also simulcast video at infowars.com, and of course, prisonplanet.tv. Bottom line, you
[01:09.760 --> 01:14.480]  know that I've been saying there'll be false flag, IED, improvised explosive device attacks
[01:14.480 --> 01:16.360]  all over the country.
[01:16.360 --> 01:22.040]  Because I know the scripting. And the globalist always trained police and others for the narrative
[01:22.040 --> 01:27.960]  they're going to carry out, whether it's staged events, provocateur, or organic, which are
[01:27.960 --> 01:34.320]  very rare. These terror attacks are rare, period. The system will use this to roll out
[01:34.320 --> 01:42.320]  TSA in the malls on the streets of America, and basically a ratcheting up of the overall
[01:42.320 --> 01:45.320]  martial law type atmosphere.
[01:45.320 --> 01:49.600]  Before I went live, Obama spoke. We're gonna find that clip. It was about 30 minutes ago.
[01:49.600 --> 01:53.200]  And I watched his press conference. It's Obama's new press conference. It's up at the White
[01:53.200 --> 01:59.560]  House.gov. He was wearing a really ugly black and white speckled tie, people that want to
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.080]  be able to find which one of the fear mongering press conferences it was.
[02:04.080 --> 02:09.480]  And he says, listen, I'm telling you it's terror. Like, oh, now it's terror, cuz the
[02:09.480 --> 02:14.960]  president said, you go outside, it's a blue sky. I don't know if it's daytime. You go
[02:14.960 --> 02:21.480]  turn on the press conference. The president says it's daytime. It's daytime. Or if it's
[02:21.480 --> 02:26.800]  nighttime, you've got to tune into the president, the president's like, it is nighttime in the
[02:26.800 --> 02:27.840]  Eastern time zone.
[02:27.840 --> 02:35.040]  You go out and go, okay, it's nighttime. Obviously, this is terrorism. Bombs at a world famous
[02:35.040 --> 02:40.560]  sporting event, killing people. That is an act of terrorism, an act of terrorism. I heard
[02:40.560 --> 02:44.880]  some talk shows last night going, well, only if it was a political group. No, terrorism
[02:44.880 --> 02:48.120]  is an individual group, corporation, it doesn't matter.
[02:48.120 --> 02:57.880]  Doing something to scare a population into something political or military or financial
[02:57.880 --> 03:04.320]  you want, or it can be if you're just insane. And I'd say there's maybe one chance out of
[03:04.320 --> 03:10.600]  100, conservatively, that this is some lone nut. Now, I came out, as this was announced
[03:10.600 --> 03:18.400]  with Richard Belzer, within two minutes of it happening, our phone system filled up with
[03:18.400 --> 03:21.820]  people saying that they'd seen this show.
[03:21.820 --> 03:26.720]  We were one of the first to report it, right as it was only tweeted by the Boston Globe.
[03:26.720 --> 03:32.480]  And I said, look, it's Patriot's Day. They're probably gonna blame this on right wing groups
[03:32.480 --> 03:38.000]  or Muslims. But notice how now they're saying right wing and Al-Qaeda, it just goes together.
[03:38.000 --> 03:44.160]  Regardless now, is it right wingers? There's only one thing as bad, Al-Qaeda.
[03:44.160 --> 03:51.820]  So we have seen all of that basically pushed in everyone's face, and so they're mixing
[03:51.820 --> 03:59.640]  and conflating the two. And within ten minutes, Salon Mediaite, The Blaze, Glenn Beck came
[03:59.640 --> 04:06.240]  out and said, how dare. So the George Soros groups and then Glenn Beck came out and said,
[04:06.240 --> 04:12.320]  how dare you say this could be staged and it'll be blamed on the Tea Party.
[04:12.320 --> 04:17.320]  Now within an hour, and I'm not exaggerating, I have ten different clips. We're not gonna
[04:17.320 --> 04:21.880]  play them all. I'm sure you've seen them. We'll play some. Where they said, the number
[04:21.880 --> 04:27.880]  one suspect is right wingers. The White House has come out and said that. Axelrod, Obama
[04:27.880 --> 04:37.020]  thinks bombings could be related to Tax Day. The Young Turks, same deal, MSNBC, CNN, right
[04:37.020 --> 04:43.640]  wing extremists, CNN to blame for explosions. And then here's The Blaze, Boston Marathon
[04:43.640 --> 04:48.060]  explosions already being blamed on the right. They were simultaneously attacking us for
[04:48.060 --> 04:52.520]  saying that while they were saying it too. I'm just tired of it. It's bad enough dealing
[04:52.520 --> 04:56.440]  with the globalists, but we're gonna break it all down. Here's London Independence saying
[04:56.440 --> 05:00.680]  it's right wing grip. Stay with us.
[05:00.680 --> 05:06.180]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[05:06.180 --> 05:11.480]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[05:11.480 --> 05:15.760]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[05:15.760 --> 05:21.000]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.740]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[05:25.740 --> 05:30.880]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[08:04.440 --> 08:18.440]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[08:18.440 --> 08:24.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, while we are busy analyzing what really happened at the mystery false
[08:24.320 --> 08:30.760]  flag, while we're busy watching the White House surrogates come out and say, oh, it's
[08:30.760 --> 08:35.680]  a right wing tea party person. That was very predictable. I was attacked just minutes after
[08:35.680 --> 08:43.000]  it happened by known White House front groups like Salon and others. And of course, media
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.360]  matters and the which isn't actually run by the White House for saying, hey, they're going
[08:48.360 --> 08:50.720]  to blame it on the tea party.
[08:50.720 --> 08:59.160]  And then minutes later, they did in those very publications. I mean, this is the magnitude
[08:59.160 --> 09:04.040]  of I say, watch, they're going to blame us or they're going to try to. And then they
[09:04.040 --> 09:08.960]  go, look, you're a crazy conspiracy theorist. But yes, we are going to try to blame you.
[09:08.960 --> 09:12.720]  But you're wrong because you're right. And you're crazy because you're right. It'd be
[09:12.720 --> 09:17.380]  like if I was sitting there fishing in a rowboat and there was a bridge over it and I saw
[09:17.380 --> 09:21.940]  a sports car fly off the road at 100 miles an hour off the bridge.
[09:21.940 --> 09:28.320]  And I said to myself, hey, that's going to crash into the side of the bank or into the
[09:28.320 --> 09:33.840]  water. And if I looked at somebody in those few seconds and they said, you're a conspiracy
[09:33.840 --> 09:39.960]  theorist as the car is dukes of hazarding out over the river. Hey, that thing's going
[09:39.960 --> 09:40.960]  to crash.
[09:40.960 --> 09:46.320]  Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist. You see, none of us are allowed to be involved in the
[09:46.320 --> 09:51.200]  narrative. None of us are allowed to speculate, ask questions like, gee, it's Patriots Day
[09:51.200 --> 09:57.360]  in Boston. Gee, do you think they're going to try to blame a right wing group? They're
[09:57.360 --> 10:02.840]  only putting out Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL memos last month saying domestic terror
[10:02.840 --> 10:04.920]  attacks are imminent.
[10:04.920 --> 10:12.080]  We warned you right before the Oklahoma City bombing. We warned Bill Clinton. And now we're
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.040]  warning you, Obama, the attacks are imminent. You can look that up. And you've got all these
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.880]  dramas and sitcoms and movies with propaganda placement saying the Tea Party is going to
[10:22.880 --> 10:28.880]  bomb people at public events and they're the new enemy, not Al-Qaeda. And then you have
[10:28.880 --> 10:34.760]  this happen where the country started, where the Revolutionary War, where 1776 started
[10:34.760 --> 10:41.080]  in 1775, Lexington, Concord, Boston.
[10:41.080 --> 10:46.720]  Patriots Day, April 15th in Boston, the real Patriots Day is the 19th. Stuart Rhodes is
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.240]  on his way there, driving right now. He's going to be joining us later in the broadcast
[10:51.240 --> 10:56.960]  of Oath Keepers. And he's like, yeah, false flag all over it. A constitutional lawyer,
[10:56.960 --> 10:59.240]  army paratrooper, head of Oath Keepers.
[10:59.240 --> 11:03.640]  And look, they may change the script. When their stuff doesn't go well, like the Olympic
[11:03.640 --> 11:09.480]  Park bombing, they'll try to frame a patsy like Richard Jewell. I mean, the World Trade
[11:09.480 --> 11:15.880]  Center was bombed by the FBI in 1993. The New York Times reported they cooked the bomb,
[11:15.880 --> 11:21.640]  banned the drivers, found guys with 75, one out of 75 wanted an 80 IQ that were both on
[11:21.640 --> 11:24.280]  welfare and their test scores got released.
[11:24.280 --> 11:30.280]  I mean, they were literally mentally retarded Muslims who then the FBI informed, it's like,
[11:30.280 --> 11:33.560]  you're going to give them real bombs now? And then he figured out they were going to
[11:33.560 --> 11:38.640]  set him up. So he recorded them saying, go ahead with the bombing. And that's the only
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.120]  reason that Ahmad Salam got paid off $1.4 million and went back to Egypt.
[11:44.120 --> 11:49.560]  He was an Egyptian CIA guy, or their CIA. And he figured out, he gave a press conference
[11:49.560 --> 11:53.280]  with his lawyer the day after. He goes, and I figured out they were setting me up. I'm
[11:53.280 --> 11:57.680]  not stupid. They promised you build a fake bomb, now build a real one. Fake detonators,
[11:57.680 --> 11:59.160]  no, now real detonators.
[11:59.160 --> 12:03.040]  Now load the truck. No, I don't want to load the truck. Well, you've got to. Well, now
[12:03.040 --> 12:06.720]  just let them drive it and we're going to stop them. And the day before he starts recording
[12:06.720 --> 12:12.200]  them because he was not stupid. He's like, my gosh, they're going to set me up. They
[12:12.200 --> 12:16.800]  did set McVeigh up two years later. And that's a little lesson for you, folks. Don't take
[12:16.800 --> 12:22.840]  part in a drill. 7-7, they set up local mainline liberal Muslims who were school teachers and
[12:22.840 --> 12:25.340]  stuff to be part of a terror drill.
[12:25.340 --> 12:28.640]  One of them figured it out. The police killed him at Canary Wharf. That was in the back
[12:28.640 --> 12:35.480]  of the paper. They bombed the same trains, the same bus at the exact same time and even
[12:35.480 --> 12:40.200]  reported, we're going to play this later, on ITN and BBC. The head advisor consultancy
[12:40.200 --> 12:46.640]  hit it in plain view, Peter Power, formerly the head of Scotland Yard PR, public relations,
[12:46.640 --> 12:53.800]  that they ran a drill with the Metro and with the Metro police in Scotland Yard of bombing
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.240]  the exact two trains and exact bus at the exact same time.
[12:58.240 --> 13:04.420]  Wait, it gets better at the exact same location. We had an insurance actuary done on that.
[13:04.420 --> 13:12.160]  It was in the, I think it was 23 plus Tractagillians. That's billions of times more than all the
[13:12.160 --> 13:18.820]  grains of sand estimated in the world. And then they hit it in plain view, which is something
[13:18.820 --> 13:24.620]  they always do. Now, why do they always run a drill? Madrid stage bombing, it came out
[13:24.620 --> 13:25.800]  in their Spanish papers.
[13:25.800 --> 13:32.480]  The president had to resign on 333, 2003, had to resign when it came out that the intelligence
[13:32.480 --> 13:36.460]  agencies and the Madrid police did the bombing. And then they ended up blowing up a house
[13:36.460 --> 13:41.880]  full of the patsies. Putin's been caught in 99 planting bombs in a fourth building. When
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.440]  they got caught, the FSB, Federal Security Bureau, by local Moscow police, I remember
[13:46.440 --> 13:49.400]  Moscow, they said, it's part of a drill, let us out of jail.
[13:49.400 --> 13:56.800]  You run the drill on 77, you run the drills declassified on 9-11 of the exact same buildings,
[13:56.800 --> 14:01.380]  the Pentagon and World Trade Centers attacked by hijacked jets. And that's why NORAD tapes
[14:01.380 --> 14:07.800]  got released and they go, is this real world or part of the exercise? Again, ladies and
[14:07.800 --> 14:10.520]  gentlemen, this is how criminal elements do this.
[14:10.520 --> 14:14.360]  And that's why when you know this and watch this, you've seen it over and over again.
[14:14.360 --> 14:20.620]  And now what came out, which they're freaking out about and having their surrogates come
[14:20.620 --> 14:30.220]  out and demonize. No one in mainstream media is covering this, but DrudgeReport.com. And
[14:30.220 --> 14:35.360]  that's not even really mainstream media, Drudge has a link to this story that is in local
[14:35.360 --> 14:36.360]  news.
[14:36.360 --> 14:42.680]  When I say mainstream nationals not covering it, local 15 TV out of Boston. We're gonna
[14:42.680 --> 14:49.320]  get to this in a little while, the video of it, document cam please. UM coach, bomb sniffing
[14:49.320 --> 14:53.720]  dogs, spotters on roofs before explosions. Well, now they're not calling them police
[14:53.720 --> 15:01.400]  spotters, go to Drudge. And now it's the mysterious manhunt for the mysterious man in the hoodie.
[15:01.400 --> 15:05.360]  There were cops all over the roofs in hoodies. We've got the video, we've got the photos.
[15:05.360 --> 15:12.560]  Now people try to spin that and they say, well, you know what's happening here. They
[15:12.560 --> 15:15.680]  always have bomb sniffing dogs now at all these events. Aren't you glad they're keeping
[15:15.680 --> 15:16.680]  us safe?
[15:16.680 --> 15:28.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's go further. Ali Stevenson, the marathon coach, University
[15:28.120 --> 15:33.380]  of Mobile's cross country coach, who was near the finish line of the Boston Marathon when
[15:33.380 --> 15:37.440]  a series of explosions went off, said he thought it was odd there were bomb sniffing dogs that
[15:37.440 --> 15:38.480]  start in the finish lines.
[15:38.480 --> 15:43.040]  They kept making announcements to the participants, don't worry, it's just a training exercise.
[15:43.040 --> 15:48.440]  Now, our own Dan Badandi, said Ali Stevenson, on Local 15. That is nowhere in the national
[15:48.440 --> 15:58.760]  news unless it's the alternative news of infoawars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv, and drudgereport.com.
[15:58.760 --> 16:02.720]  And I did tune in last night to the guest that's joining us, Doug Hagman of the Northeast
[16:02.720 --> 16:08.080]  Intelligence Network, who was on Monday saying staged attacks to be blamed on patriots are
[16:08.080 --> 16:09.080]  imminent.
[16:09.080 --> 16:13.240]  And Obama is doubling down, according to his federal source, who I was able to talk to
[16:13.240 --> 16:18.720]  yesterday. In the morning before this happened, he said, get ready. They're looking to blame
[16:18.720 --> 16:21.880]  something on the patriots or the Muslims, probably the Muslims. And he said, that's
[16:21.880 --> 16:28.160]  all I can tell you. I need to call that guy back. The point is, is that imminent is the
[16:28.160 --> 16:29.160]  word.
[16:29.160 --> 16:32.600]  Well, it was imminent. And that's why I came on air yesterday, three hours before it happened,
[16:32.600 --> 16:35.440]  and I said, we've all got to unify as the Liberty Movement. If you support the Bill
[16:35.440 --> 16:40.120]  of Rights and Constitution, transcend liberal conservative, we've got to understand if there
[16:40.120 --> 16:42.720]  are attacks, giving our rights up won't protect us.
[16:42.720 --> 16:48.800]  I can feel it in my bones, attacks are imminent. And I said, they'll wanna have the shot heard
[16:48.800 --> 16:52.580]  around the world. They'll wanna pull the trigger cuz whoever shoots first loses, but blame
[16:52.580 --> 16:57.460]  it on us. I said that three times during the show yesterday. Don't even have the crew to
[16:57.460 --> 16:58.460]  go pull it.
[16:58.460 --> 17:02.640]  I just remember it cuz I said it over and over again. And isn't it funny where the shot
[17:02.640 --> 17:12.340]  heard round the world happened in Boston in the very same few days. And I'm telling you,
[17:12.340 --> 17:17.560]  this is epic what we're seeing happen. Now, when their first story fell apart of the Olympic
[17:17.560 --> 17:20.320]  Park bombing, they went and set up a patsy.
[17:20.320 --> 17:25.400]  They set up three people for the anthrax attack. Turned out it was super US weapons grade Fort
[17:25.400 --> 17:29.080]  Dietrich, Maryland. The third patsy they grabbed, they took to a hospital, a doctor
[17:29.080 --> 17:33.200]  drugged him and killed him. It was a line in the back of the local paper that while
[17:33.200 --> 17:43.680]  in a straitjacket, he was fed prescription Tylenol till he died, okay?
[17:43.680 --> 17:51.720]  So I would say 99% of people in the military and the police and the bomb squads are not
[17:51.720 --> 17:57.420]  terrorists, okay? But there isn't really any terrorism or any bomb stuff going on. And
[17:57.420 --> 18:01.480]  usually it's a crazy firefighter or a crazy cop that does it. I mean, look at how many
[18:01.480 --> 18:06.280]  criminology cases, it's someone on the bomb squad, 10 years of never having a real bomb
[18:06.280 --> 18:09.880]  and blowing up shopping bags that blow out of trucks on the side of the highway, they'll
[18:09.880 --> 18:11.320]  go plant a bomb.
[18:11.320 --> 18:16.320]  And it's always back of the paper. So criminology wise, that's who you look at. And still, it's
[18:16.320 --> 18:20.040]  a very small minority of them that do it. But statistically, it's a much larger minority
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.800]  than the public. But if you look at all of these events, that's the main suspects. And
[18:25.800 --> 18:35.520]  for people to go, how dare Alex Jones, like Media Matters, Salon, Mediaite, Glenn Beck,
[18:35.520 --> 18:37.000]  God bless him.
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.440]  All of them coming out attacking me for saying, A, they're gonna blame the Tea Party or try,
[18:41.440 --> 18:46.520]  which then happened exactly as I said. I mean, it's a no brainer. It's like, if I stick my
[18:46.520 --> 18:51.240]  hand in a red hot fire, I'm gonna get burned. I mean, it's like, okay, there's been an attack
[18:51.240 --> 18:56.600]  on Patriots Day. It looks staged. Preliminary stuff, there were drills, that's now been
[18:56.600 --> 18:57.600]  confirmed.
[18:57.600 --> 19:02.640]  Okay, bomb sipping dogs everywhere. This, okay, they're having a drill, looks like a
[19:02.640 --> 19:06.800]  false flag. I mean, you have groups that have done this over and over again that are saying
[19:06.800 --> 19:12.960]  it's going to happen with every TV show drama sitcom at a crescendo that the right wingers
[19:12.960 --> 19:15.400]  are gonna bomb everybody.
[19:15.400 --> 19:21.280]  They had a family guy that aired two weeks ago, where the dad, who's a Tea Party guy,
[19:21.280 --> 19:25.840]  joins the Taliban. Again, that oxymoron, but they're still pushing it until people believe
[19:25.840 --> 19:32.040]  it. West Point says it, Army to crush Tea Party rebellion, Forbes, AP, Reuters. You're
[19:32.040 --> 19:38.120]  like, that doesn't make sense. Now, it will make sense. Family guy has him at a subconscious
[19:38.120 --> 19:39.120]  level.
[19:39.120 --> 19:45.160]  It's almost subliminal. We're gonna play this coming up. It's up at Infowars.com. Bombing,
[19:45.160 --> 19:52.160]  the Boston Marathon, at the finish line with two bombs, with a cell phone detonator.
[20:45.160 --> 20:52.720]  That's 866-229-0927. That's 866-229-0927. Or discover more emergency preparedness items

[21:00.800 --> 21:06.280]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[21:06.280 --> 21:11.560]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[21:11.560 --> 21:15.840]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[21:15.840 --> 21:21.040]  out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[21:21.040 --> 21:25.760]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[21:25.760 --> 21:30.840]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[22:31.720 --> 22:35.920]  why banks, stock workers, investment advisors want to talk about gold IRAs? They've been
[22:35.920 --> 22:40.800]  available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your
[22:40.800 --> 22:45.600]  retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like
[22:45.600 --> 22:51.920]  to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation

[23:04.280 --> 23:10.420]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year. Burglars call it smash
[23:10.420 --> 23:18.320]  and grab. Police call it robbery. We call it avoidable. We are Fake TV, a simple electronic
[23:18.320 --> 23:24.720]  device that can fool even professional burglars. Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates
[23:24.720 --> 23:29.560]  the changing colors of a television. To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home
[23:29.560 --> 23:36.420]  watching TV, so they'll likely move on to an easier target. At only $29.95, Fake TV
[23:36.420 --> 23:41.320]  costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans and comes with free shipping. Order
[23:41.320 --> 23:54.480]  your Fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKETV or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[23:54.480 --> 24:01.480]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[24:24.480 --> 24:40.480]  And the sun is gonna burn into a cinder. Before we ever pass this wave of gas. And we're gonna
[24:40.480 --> 24:49.480]  ride. And we're gonna ride. Yeah, Willie Nelson is 80 years old this week. Got a chance to
[24:49.480 --> 24:58.400]  hang out with him a few weeks ago. All right, getting back to what I was breaking down here.
[24:58.400 --> 25:02.040]  You can bet that they're now announcing the new security measures, TSA, troops on the
[25:02.040 --> 25:07.400]  streets, checkpoints, you're all suspects. And they're all America's gonna be strong
[25:07.400 --> 25:10.540]  and united in the face of this.
[25:10.540 --> 25:15.760]  And Obama's approval rating is already going up. And he's up there saying, we face down
[25:15.760 --> 25:25.000]  the terror together and he's the father figure. He's the guy protecting us as the big daddy.
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.400]  And this will be used to across the board, take our basic liberties and our freedoms.
[25:31.400 --> 25:37.780]  And during the break, I was watching CNN just breathlessly. And we've got victims and let's
[25:37.780 --> 25:43.460]  cut to this senator and the senator's all smiling. It's all about the government cult
[25:43.460 --> 25:47.440]  getting to have everybody tune into them. Cuz the only time dinosaur media gets viewers
[25:47.440 --> 25:51.140]  or attention now is when there's a big event.
[25:51.140 --> 25:56.320]  And so they're all a bunch of narcissists up there and spreading the fear. But don't
[25:56.320 --> 26:05.720]  worry, we'll bring you a third world police state to keep you safe. And while we are distracted,
[26:05.720 --> 26:15.880]  while we are diverted by all of this, they are racing through the Senate now with the
[26:15.880 --> 26:21.440]  gun registration and psychological gun confiscation program that basically overthrows much of
[26:21.440 --> 26:22.560]  the Second Amendment.
[26:22.560 --> 26:27.280]  They're racing through with total open border legalization. And where Homeland Security
[26:27.280 --> 26:32.000]  has its own discretion whether to control the border at any level, which they've already
[26:32.000 --> 26:43.680]  opened up and are doing blanket fiat amnesty anyways. I mean, that's all on record. So
[26:43.680 --> 26:49.820]  we've got that going on. All of this is unfolding right now, right as they're trying to pass
[26:49.820 --> 26:53.880]  their whole globalist North American Union agenda.
[26:53.880 --> 26:57.200]  Right as they're trying to get warrantless wiretapping codified into law. Right as they're
[26:57.200 --> 27:01.320]  trying to expand all this, just like 9-11 was used to ran through the Patriot Act and
[27:01.320 --> 27:05.200]  all the rest of it. And when 9-11 wasn't enough to get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[27:05.200 --> 27:10.160]  then there was the anthrax attack that somebody could have made in a bathtub in their basement.
[27:10.160 --> 27:15.400]  Turned out the most weaponized US government version ever. And they finally killed the
[27:15.400 --> 27:19.880]  third Patsy to shut them up. And ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna get to this later in
[27:19.880 --> 27:21.760]  the hour.
[27:21.760 --> 27:29.760]  But if you go up to info wars.com, you can see all of these different videos, all these
[27:29.760 --> 27:40.880]  different interviews we're gonna cover during the next segment. Where you've got eye witnesses
[27:40.880 --> 27:45.720]  openly reporting the fact that they were told it was a drill. Never mind, don't mind what
[27:45.720 --> 27:49.660]  was happening right around the area right before the bomb went off.
[27:49.660 --> 27:53.660]  And there's two ways to look at that. You can say they were right on it trying to stop
[27:53.660 --> 27:57.880]  it. They had Intel and they tried to save us. Of course, they pulled back right before
[27:57.880 --> 28:02.160]  the bombing happened. Or you can look at it as they were there using the drill as the
[28:02.160 --> 28:05.940]  cover in case some other agency or group stopped them.
[28:05.940 --> 28:09.480]  Which is what they use the NSA for, is to make sure they're false flags, other things
[28:09.480 --> 28:14.240]  don't get caught. And now that our own Dan Badandi in two different press conferences
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.720]  with the police chief, the mayor and the governor. Our own East Coast reporter Dan Badandi made
[28:18.720 --> 28:23.840]  national news just asking real questions about hey, now there's the Huffington Post.
[28:23.840 --> 28:28.840]  Boston Marathon bombing brings out conspiracy theories. That means people that are willing
[28:28.840 --> 28:35.920]  to go, hey, there was a drill. And the police say no, there wasn't a drill. The police chief
[28:35.920 --> 28:40.280]  says there was no drill. The governor says there was no drill.
[28:40.280 --> 28:43.880]  And then Badandi goes up to the police after the press conference and says, was there a
[28:43.880 --> 28:49.060]  drill? And they say no, no drill. So they're telling witnesses, there's a whole bunch of
[28:49.060 --> 28:54.000]  witnesses in local news. National news isn't picking it up unless they say it's a conspiracy
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.000]  theory.
[28:55.000 --> 29:00.080]  They just pointed us and go, look at these weirdos bringing this up. When we were there,
[29:00.080 --> 29:05.000]  Badandi was there with the Boston Globe going, they say there was a drill. And other witnesses
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.680]  on News 15 are saying there's a drill. What were the drills for? And they're like, nope,
[29:10.680 --> 29:15.400]  nope, that didn't happen. It's just like with Dorner. We're gonna burn this down, burn that
[29:15.400 --> 29:20.760]  mother effer down. Bring fire, we've got the fire. Place the fire, the fire is lit. The
[29:20.760 --> 29:26.040]  building is burning down. Good job, it's burned down. We killed that mother.
[29:26.040 --> 29:30.080]  They're like, hey, conspiracy theorists, that doesn't mean what you think it said. Burn
[29:30.080 --> 29:35.440]  that mother effer down doesn't mean burn that mother effer down. And now we're like, hey,
[29:35.440 --> 29:38.600]  what were the drills? That's what any real journalist would ask. What happened? They're
[29:38.600 --> 29:43.040]  like, no, no, there was no drills. There was no drill. So see, they're covering up. Folks,
[29:43.040 --> 29:48.240]  they're as guilty as a pig and you know what? Okay, they are as guilty as a pig and you
[29:48.240 --> 29:54.320]  know what? We'll be right back. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.320 --> 30:01.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.040 --> 30:06.080]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary
[30:06.080 --> 30:11.780]  economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[30:11.780 --> 30:16.940]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled

[33:23.160 --> 33:34.060]  My friends, we're going to open the phones up in the second hour and then we've got
[33:34.060 --> 33:40.160]  Joel Skalzen popping in, we've got Doug Hagman coming on and we've got the head of
[33:40.160 --> 33:45.040]  Oathkeeper Stuart Rhodes who's on his way to Boston for the April 19th commemorations
[33:45.040 --> 33:49.280]  there with Oathkeepers. We're going to be getting to all of that today with those guests
[33:49.280 --> 33:52.920]  popping in and in fact I'll open the phones up now and get to some of them by the next
[33:52.920 --> 33:55.120]  segment if I'm able to get to all these clips.
[33:55.120 --> 33:59.000]  I want to get your take on what you're witnessing. You know, let me do this. I want to hear from
[33:59.000 --> 34:05.580]  police. Police who've heard me on the air say they'd have these type of events and
[34:05.580 --> 34:09.200]  blame it on Patriot groups and even if they end up going with a Middle Eastern group,
[34:09.200 --> 34:12.760]  because there's a low probability it could be a real terror group from the Middle East,
[34:12.760 --> 34:14.120]  that some of that does happen.
[34:14.120 --> 34:18.520]  Usually it's provocateur, allowed to happen, sometimes staged. We know they're going to
[34:18.520 --> 34:23.840]  use the crisis to take our liberties. But it could be that. But the media certainly
[34:23.840 --> 34:29.000]  has tried to go with nine out of ten times, I mean I've been immersed in it, I know you
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.800]  have been as well, all the channels, all the news, that it's a Tea Party patriot on tax
[34:33.800 --> 34:35.160]  day that did this.
[34:35.160 --> 34:41.200]  We're going to play some clips of that in a moment. Now, did Salon, Media Matters, all
[34:41.200 --> 34:44.960]  these other White House connected groups, did they come out and go, wow, Alex Jones
[34:44.960 --> 34:50.880]  is right. No, they said I was wrong to say we'd be blamed, but went on to blame us. And
[34:50.880 --> 34:59.000]  again, that's called Jim Jones level cultism by these authoritarians that like to basically
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.160]  pose as liberals.
[35:02.160 --> 35:06.400]  Now Rush Limbaugh came out, it turns out, and said that they'd probably blame us after
[35:06.400 --> 35:12.020]  he went off air yesterday. Michael Savage talked about it, others did. One guy came
[35:12.020 --> 35:16.520]  out and immediately said I was wrong, and that was Glenn Beck. While having articles,
[35:16.520 --> 35:20.440]  we're going to show this to TV viewers, I'm going to mention the headlines to radio listeners,
[35:20.440 --> 35:23.760]  saying they're going to blame the right wing, but I was bad to say it though.
[35:23.760 --> 35:28.880]  No, no, I was bad to say it first. You see, I was supposed to sit there all cowardly,
[35:28.880 --> 35:34.160]  and I'm not supposed to speculate. I'm supposed to wait till the known lying federal government
[35:34.160 --> 35:39.200]  who ran fast and furious and other false flags they've been caught doing that killed thousands
[35:39.200 --> 35:43.320]  of people. You don't see them personalizing each one of those dead, like they're doing
[35:43.320 --> 35:44.320]  these dead.
[35:44.320 --> 35:48.680]  I mean, they are just using this, and that's how you know when they're ready, when they
[35:48.680 --> 35:54.440]  script it, the way the whole thing's scripted, the crescendo of media coverage. And then
[35:54.440 --> 36:02.040]  you've got a drill from the start to the finish. And I forgot, Rob Doo's brother-in-law, who
[36:02.040 --> 36:08.360]  he argues with on a weekly basis about the New World Order and stuff, who is in military
[36:08.360 --> 36:11.560]  intelligence, pretty high level.
[36:11.560 --> 36:18.160]  He's married to the guy's sister. He runs for the team army. He was in the official
[36:18.160 --> 36:25.120]  team army marathon truck that sometimes wins. I mean, Doo's been on vacation with him. He
[36:25.120 --> 36:33.460]  gets up at 3 AM, runs 20 miles, and is back in the early afternoon ready for lunch. And
[36:33.460 --> 36:39.400]  the point is, is that what he heard from his wives who talked to him was, yeah, it's weird.
[36:39.400 --> 36:43.440]  I'm going to the hospital now. They pulled me out and said I was showing signs of dehydration
[36:43.440 --> 36:45.680]  right before the end of the marathon.
[36:45.680 --> 36:51.080]  Oh, let's get team army. By the way, we're gonna find out cuz now they won't talk to
[36:51.080 --> 36:54.720]  us. I'm sure the word went out. I should have waited later. I just got in the heat of the
[36:54.720 --> 36:59.480]  moment. It was like blabbing about it on air. I should have before they figured it out and
[36:59.480 --> 37:05.160]  cut it down. If he never talks to Rob again, Rob Doo, we'll really know the fix was in.
[37:05.160 --> 37:11.400]  But if they pulled more members of team army, cuz it was a whole, quote, large truck of
[37:11.400 --> 37:12.400]  army runners.
[37:12.400 --> 37:18.180]  You've seen on the news, wearing the army shirt. Hey, we're the army. We win the marathon.
[37:18.180 --> 37:25.160]  And it's just bizarre, absolutely bizarre small world. Because Rob Doo was also part
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.560]  time in a band that Joe Stack was in, who reportedly flew his plane to the IRS building
[37:29.560 --> 37:30.560]  in Austin.
[37:30.560 --> 37:34.720]  That's why the footage we released ended up being on the national news of Joe Stack playing
[37:34.720 --> 37:41.400]  the guitar. And he was not even into Patriot right wing stuff. When Doo knew him a decade
[37:41.400 --> 37:46.400]  ago, he was just a real quiet guy, a really good guitar player who never talked, didn't
[37:46.400 --> 37:48.240]  talk very much.
[37:48.240 --> 37:52.780]  Always showed up on time, always did a great job. And IRS took his house, ruined his life.
[37:52.780 --> 37:59.840]  Joe Stack might have been a real deal. I mean, you never know. And that's why there are some
[37:59.840 --> 38:06.100]  real deals. I mean, there is a chance, and I said this yesterday, that this could be
[38:06.100 --> 38:07.820]  a real deal.
[38:07.820 --> 38:11.640]  But you look at the media buildup, you look at the timing, you look at the demonization.
[38:11.640 --> 38:17.200]  The news saying right wingers will attack sports stadiums and malls and mass shootings
[38:17.200 --> 38:22.460]  and bombings and police. There will be improvised explosive devices. Ex-military will bomb every
[38:22.460 --> 38:26.440]  department in America. They've been saying that for four years. We're like, that's ridiculous,
[38:26.440 --> 38:29.200]  unless they know something's gonna happen.
[38:29.200 --> 38:33.360]  If somebody kept saying, somebody's gonna burn down the church, and everybody's in the
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.080]  church of like 200, these have been real cases. Well, why do you keep saying that, Bob? I
[38:37.080 --> 38:40.600]  don't know, somebody's gonna burn it down, we should have insurance. Then the church
[38:40.600 --> 38:41.960]  burns down the next week.
[38:41.960 --> 38:48.040]  Who's the first person the cops go and talk to? Bob, who said somebody might burn down
[38:48.040 --> 38:53.320]  the church? I mean, this is 101 criminology that you've got the White House going. Right
[38:53.320 --> 38:59.840]  winger libertarians, anti-Obama, pro-gun people are gonna blow stuff up any minute.
[38:59.840 --> 39:03.620]  Get ready, they're gonna hurt our children. They're the new terror threat, bigger threat
[39:03.620 --> 39:08.100]  than Al-Qaeda, who the government's giving Libya and Syria, and heat-seeking missiles
[39:08.100 --> 39:16.120]  in Benghazi. I mean, this is no-brainer stuff, ladies and gentlemen, no-brainer.
[39:16.120 --> 39:21.680]  So here's the number for police. I wanna get your take on this, 800, police only, or military,
[39:21.680 --> 39:31.360]  who are currently active duty. 800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231. But as God is my witness,
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.600]  dude turned white. We were in the war room in there, and he goes, he's talking to his
[39:34.600 --> 39:35.600]  wife.
[39:35.600 --> 39:42.320]  We talked to her brother, who's in army intelligence, who dude has arguments with. He's like an
[39:42.320 --> 39:49.840]  idiot. And he goes, my God, my brother-in-law was running the marathon and was there at
[39:49.840 --> 39:53.680]  the end when the bombing happened, but they pulled him out right before. And I go, you
[39:53.680 --> 39:54.680]  gotta come on here right now.
[39:54.680 --> 39:58.480]  So literally, the break-ins from a video we were playing, I walk him in and I go, your
[39:58.480 --> 40:03.000]  brother was running security with the 400 troops? He goes, no, no, no, he was running
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.360]  it. And then you heard the story, I mean, that was like, he hung the phone up, turned
[40:07.360 --> 40:13.440]  white, said I can't handle this anymore. Walks in here, on air, and I mean, this is like
[40:13.440 --> 40:20.340]  a movie, folks. This is like a movie, what's going on?
[40:20.340 --> 40:24.200]  And then of course, there's a drill, and then we send Dan Badandi to two different press
[40:24.200 --> 40:30.680]  conferences to ask about drills. And they say there are no drills, there is nothing
[40:30.680 --> 40:36.680]  happening. And then we're conspiracy theorists for saying it, when it's in two local newspapers,
[40:36.680 --> 40:50.720]  Boston Globe, one other here in my stack, and local 15 TV. What is that, an NBC affiliate?
[40:50.720 --> 40:54.160]  And we're gonna play that clip for you, the full newscast is up on infoawards.com, it's
[40:54.160 --> 41:00.040]  also up on drudgereport.com. But do you understand the frustration of this? I mean, I study,
[41:00.040 --> 41:01.640]  this is what I do.
[41:01.640 --> 41:07.400]  I'm a leading expert, they've had university books written in England and the United States,
[41:07.400 --> 41:13.280]  they have university classes on what I cover. I'm not bragging, no one else seems to study
[41:13.280 --> 41:17.960]  this except the people that are doing it. And I sit here like a private detective, watching
[41:17.960 --> 41:24.240]  this, studying this, interviewing former Italian presidents, and number three in the Japanese
[41:24.240 --> 41:33.480]  government and former European Union officials, the former German defense minister, Andres
[41:33.480 --> 41:38.360]  von Bulow, I'm gonna get him back on, wrote the book, CIA Stage 9-11.
[41:38.360 --> 41:46.960]  And he was in the meetings, I mean, he's high level, it's a fact they were involved. I mean,
[41:46.960 --> 41:52.080]  I'm fully immersed in this, okay? And sure, when you're a hammer, everything looks like
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.120]  a nail. But I don't go with that mindset, I'm actually looking at this, hoping this,
[41:58.120 --> 42:02.120]  I'm sad it happened, but hoping it's a real grassroots deal.
[42:02.120 --> 42:08.240]  Because then it's not the government doing it, because that's 100 times worse, folks.
[42:08.240 --> 42:17.720]  We try to prove that it's an organic operation, Joe Stack, 60% chance he probably did it.
[42:17.720 --> 42:22.720]  Because they just ruined his life, took everything he had. And he just flipped out and said,
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.720]  you're getting nothing, I'm burning down the house and I'm coming after you.
[42:28.720 --> 42:32.040]  Now there was a lot of bizarre Defense Department connections to where he had his plane and
[42:32.040 --> 42:39.600]  stuff. But look, all I know is they use this to get our liberties. So there was a drill
[42:39.600 --> 42:44.000]  from start to finish, and they don't wanna talk about it, and they're calling it a conspiracy
[42:44.000 --> 42:48.640]  theory. Just like they said, the first day they ignored it, I mean, we're there watching
[42:48.640 --> 42:49.800]  it.
[42:49.800 --> 42:54.120]  As they start surrounding him, I shoot a YouTube video, upload it, timestamped, and say they're
[42:54.120 --> 42:58.080]  gonna probably burn him down, that standard operating procedure. An hour later, they burn
[42:58.080 --> 43:02.240]  him down, then the audio all gets recorded of six different groups saying we're gonna
[43:02.240 --> 43:07.380]  burn him down. And then they say, you're a conspiracy theorist, how dare you, Alex Jones?
[43:07.380 --> 43:11.960]  They said that, but it doesn't mean that. Some media said they just didn't say that,
[43:11.960 --> 43:19.320]  talking to you like you're stupid, 800-259-9231. We're gonna go to phone calls after I play
[43:19.320 --> 43:20.600]  these clips.
[43:20.600 --> 43:24.440]  But let's first go to Dan Badandi, there's two different press conferences, in the evening
[43:24.440 --> 43:28.320]  and then late at night. This became national news, they shut the press conference down
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.920]  with the governor when he got the first question in and wouldn't shut up about false flags.
[43:33.920 --> 43:37.440]  And he says, no, there was no false flag. And the other press conference, he says, were
[43:37.440 --> 43:42.160]  their drills. What was happening with the exercise? And they just said, we had no prior
[43:42.160 --> 43:48.480]  knowledge, there was no exercise. So there was an exercise, that's in the Boston Globe,
[43:48.480 --> 43:52.760]  that's in the other local paper, and it's in News 15, but buried.
[43:52.760 --> 43:57.360]  And there's witnesses all over the place. And Rob Dues, brother-in-law, they come up
[43:57.360 --> 44:01.680]  and go, you need to go to the hospital. And he's like, why? Well, we just think you're
[44:01.680 --> 44:06.560]  sick. They let you urinate on yourself, vomit, crawl across the finish line, but they pull
[44:06.560 --> 44:13.360]  him out. And then minutes later, there's a bombing, at the finish line, okay?
[44:13.360 --> 44:17.040]  And there's 400 troops there, the image of troops and the wreckage were being acclimated
[44:17.040 --> 44:20.720]  to all this. And now they're saying, troops are gonna be everywhere. And I've always told
[44:20.720 --> 44:25.120]  you, don't be part of drills, cuz most of the time it isn't a staged attack. But when
[44:25.120 --> 44:29.040]  there is an attack, it's a drill, it's always a drill.
[44:29.040 --> 44:35.280]  Because when they get caught with the bombs, this happened before, they always say in Gladio,
[44:35.280 --> 44:39.480]  the Russians have been caught, NATO's been caught, they say, I'm part of a drill. Cuz
[44:39.480 --> 44:45.760]  99% of the police aren't part of it. It was a drill on 7-7, where they told the young
[44:45.760 --> 44:51.360]  Muslims, be part of a drill for the UK, you're good liberal school teacher Muslims.
[44:51.360 --> 44:56.400]  And they blew them up, folks, on the train and on the bus. And one guy figured it out
[44:56.400 --> 44:59.800]  and was running, and they executed him in Canary Wharf. And then that was taken out
[44:59.800 --> 45:06.180]  of the newspaper with a D notice, a federal emergency notice had that removed. Witnesses
[45:06.180 --> 45:11.600]  saw them, they gunned down several guys, chased them down and gunned them down right there
[45:11.600 --> 45:17.600]  in front of the tourist district, because they figured out what happened.
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.740]  And I'm telling you, do not be part of a drill. If you're police, if you're military, they're
[45:21.740 --> 45:25.720]  getting ready to say military or terrorist. All they do is tell military, intelligence
[45:25.720 --> 45:31.080]  has been sheep-dipped into domestic operations. Hey, you're now gonna go be part of this drill,
[45:31.080 --> 45:33.920]  carry this and simulate being a terrorist.
[45:33.920 --> 45:37.760]  And most of the time they're not gonna do it, but let me tell you, one out of 100 drills
[45:37.760 --> 45:41.760]  or so, they're gonna blow it up. Or they're gonna tell you, leave it and then you're gonna
[45:41.760 --> 45:44.800]  get arrested. You're gonna get drugged up, you're gonna get tortured, you're gonna get
[45:44.800 --> 45:50.400]  electroshock therapy until you go before the military tribunal and say that you bombed
[45:50.400 --> 45:56.120]  the Cirrus Tower, or you bombed the mall, or you bombed the school.
[45:56.120 --> 46:00.240]  I'm gonna tell you, it's just like Arlington Road, the professor's trying to stop it and
[46:00.240 --> 46:05.760]  they trick him to be on the news and then run into the parking garage when it goes off.
[46:05.760 --> 46:10.720]  I mean, they're telling you how they do it right there, okay? I'm getting chills. And
[46:10.720 --> 46:13.560]  I told you this was gonna happen yesterday before it happened.
[46:13.560 --> 46:18.560]  Let's go to Dan Badandi at one of the press conferences. This is confronting the governor,
[46:18.560 --> 46:19.560]  here it is.
[46:19.560 --> 46:20.560]  Any questions?
[46:20.560 --> 46:21.560]  Well, sir, I don't know why you speak as common people when you are just a big con when you
[46:21.560 --> 46:22.560]  speak on a common law. Is this another false five-stage attack to take our civil liberties
[46:22.560 --> 46:23.560]  for all of our security? I was taking a hand down on a sketch on the street.
[46:23.560 --> 46:24.560]  No. Next question.
[46:24.560 --> 46:25.560]  You have said that there's no stopping?
[46:25.560 --> 46:26.560]  Good morning. The medical people are compiling that as we speak.
[46:26.560 --> 46:27.560]  When we speak as common people, did y'all be characterized as an act of terrorism?
[46:27.560 --> 46:28.560]  It's gentle, we disagree.
[46:28.560 --> 46:29.560]  Main point of focus, right?
[46:29.560 --> 46:30.560]  Okay, I don't think you're talking about speaking as common people to be conned before
[46:30.560 --> 46:52.880]  the time when I'm talking about the attention I put to your search for additional devices
[46:52.880 --> 47:04.440]  or you're searching the entire-
[47:04.440 --> 47:11.440]  The investigation is in the area that the governor mentioned.
[47:11.440 --> 47:19.440]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now. We're going through those
[47:19.440 --> 47:21.440]  right now.
[47:21.440 --> 47:25.240]  And that was the initial video we got off Fox News. I, actually, driving home last night
[47:25.240 --> 47:29.340]  heard local news playing clips of the press conference. It was crystal clear. And Badandi
[47:29.340 --> 47:34.280]  was there with his mic flagged, Infowars, up on the podium. As soon as he can get that
[47:34.280 --> 47:37.120]  uploaded to YouTube, we'll have better quality for you.
[47:37.120 --> 47:41.000]  But that totally flipped out the media, and it's called conspiracy theory. Now, here's
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.300]  Badandi earlier talking to the governor and commissioner as well, asking about the bombing
[47:47.300 --> 47:50.080]  and drills. Here's that clip.
[47:50.080 --> 47:56.760]  Hey, guys. Leanne McAdoo here at the Austin, Texas, Infowars News Center. Our East Coast
[47:56.760 --> 48:01.120]  reporter, Dan Badandi, is on the scene, and he was able to get in this question at the
[48:01.120 --> 48:02.120]  news conference.
[48:02.120 --> 48:06.120]  We are looking at all of that right now. That's one of the investigative steps that we have
[48:06.120 --> 48:07.120]  taken.
[48:07.120 --> 48:08.120]  Well, you're on the plane. I don't have a customer that sustains. They said they were
[48:08.120 --> 48:09.120]  doing drills this morning for the same exact thing that happened on the force of wolves.com.
[48:09.120 --> 48:10.120]  Now, will you guys give them any more ahead of time of this taking place?
[48:10.120 --> 48:11.120]  As I said earlier, there was no specific intelligence on the plane.
[48:11.120 --> 48:25.640]  We certainly increased posture around a big event like this. All of those things happened
[48:25.640 --> 48:29.240]  in preparation for this event, but there was no specific intelligence that anything was
[48:29.240 --> 48:32.240]  going to happen.
[48:32.240 --> 48:33.240]  Now we've got that story-
[48:33.240 --> 48:34.240]  All right.
[48:34.240 --> 48:35.240]  On our-
[48:35.240 --> 48:38.640]  All right, that's good. The full clip's up on Infowars.com right now. And again, Badandi
[48:38.640 --> 48:43.400]  was able to talk to police again, and they said, no, no drills, no nothing. But you noticed
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.880]  there was no specific intelligence. Oh, really? You didn't know that satchel the guy's placed
[48:47.880 --> 48:50.240]  had real explosives in it?
[48:50.240 --> 48:56.400]  You didn't know that? So we're going to be going over all of this now. Now, here's the
[48:56.400 --> 49:01.520]  coach. This is the shorter clip. The full clip's up on Infowars.com. DrudgeReport.com
[49:01.520 --> 49:07.560]  also has it, UM coach, bomb sniffing dogs, spotters on roofs before explosions.
[49:07.560 --> 49:11.400]  And then in the very area, they kept making announcements to the participants, do not
[49:11.400 --> 49:15.280]  worry. It's just a training exercise, kind of like 9-11. Stay at your desk, everything's
[49:15.280 --> 49:21.360]  fine. Or 7C, just over and over again, the Aurora shooting. It's fine, it's just a drill.
[49:21.360 --> 49:25.760]  Let's go ahead and now go to that clip.
[49:25.760 --> 49:31.560]  At the start line this morning, they had bomb spotters on the roof of the building, and
[49:31.560 --> 49:35.960]  they had bomb sniffing dogs coming up and down at the start line. And Melanie said there
[49:35.960 --> 49:40.000]  were bomb sniffing dogs at the finish line, but they kept making announcements saying
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.040]  to the participants, do not worry. This is just a training exercise. Well, evidently,
[49:46.040 --> 49:48.880]  I don't believe they were just having a training exercise. I think they must have known they
[49:48.880 --> 49:52.120]  must have had some kind of threat or suspicion called in.
[49:52.120 --> 49:57.800]  No kidding. And again, they're lying about that. That is undoubted. And again, we're breaking
[49:57.800 --> 50:02.400]  the real news. We're forcing the real issues out in the open. We're engaged in real journalism.
[50:02.400 --> 50:07.880]  So I salute Dan Badandi. At both press conferences, he got the first questions down and they just
[50:07.880 --> 50:12.440]  shut the press conferences down. I mean, they were gonna grandstand for an hour, you know
[50:12.440 --> 50:13.740]  they were.
[50:13.740 --> 50:16.840]  And the press still had more questions. But Badandi was there going, you were running
[50:16.840 --> 50:21.200]  a drill, you were running a drill. Boston Globe, you were running a drill, you were
[50:21.200 --> 50:25.460]  running a drill. And the governor looked like he was about to have a heart attack and looked
[50:25.460 --> 50:29.960]  so angry. And the media is like, the governor was angry that such stupid questions would
[50:29.960 --> 50:34.400]  be asked. Of course, there was no drill. In fact, it's the media that denies it for them.
[50:34.400 --> 50:40.880]  There was no drill. There were no police dogs. There were nothing. It was, everything's fine.
[50:40.880 --> 50:49.520]  Now up on Infowars.com, the family guy, this aired Sunday, first aired back in March, where
[50:49.520 --> 50:56.440]  the Boston Marathon is bombed with not one but two bombs by the family guy, the Tea Party
[50:56.440 --> 51:01.480]  guy, at the Boston Marathon at the finish with two bombs.

[54:04.560 --> 54:10.640]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here back live. The toll free number to join us is 800-25-9231.
[54:10.640 --> 54:16.240]  We have Tom, who's a police officer, he says in Iowa. Ben, who says he was IDF counter terror.
[54:16.240 --> 54:22.080]  It's Israeli Defense Force and Anthony Oregon, who is the army. And I want to get your take
[54:22.080 --> 54:26.800]  into the bottom of the next hour. Then Joel Skalzen, who is a real terrorism expert in my
[54:26.800 --> 54:32.160]  view, he's going to be joining us. Doug Hagman as well, who was telling me off air and on air
[54:32.160 --> 54:36.720]  Monday, it's imminent. And then I got to talk to one of his federal sources. And by the way,
[54:36.720 --> 54:40.160]  I have federal sources. A lot of people find that hard to believe. I know the federal government's
[54:40.160 --> 54:43.680]  full of people that don't like what's happening. And there's really no discipline up there right
[54:43.680 --> 54:48.960]  now. That's why so much of this can come out because the rest of the Secret Service and
[54:48.960 --> 54:52.960]  people are off with hookers doing drugs. And then the good guys are sitting there just not
[54:52.960 --> 54:56.640]  knowing what to do. That's why they're prosecuting whistleblowers trying to scare people now.
[54:57.600 --> 55:01.920]  And then Stuart Rhodes of Oath Keepers is going to be popping in. It's a jam packed transmission.
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.840]  We have free video feeds and audio feeds at Infowars.com forward slash listen. And even
[55:07.840 --> 55:12.960]  if you're watching right now, post it to your Facebook, your Twitter, we'll retweet out there.
[55:12.960 --> 55:18.960]  But family got to be specific and I'm going to your calls. In one episode, he runs over people
[55:18.960 --> 55:24.800]  at the finish line of the Boston Marathon and then he detonates two bombs. So that's the clip
[55:24.800 --> 55:31.520]  that's up on Infowars.com. And my issue is Doug Hagman of the X-Files came to me. And he said,
[55:31.520 --> 55:35.040]  you know that episode where the government flies a hijacked jet in the World Trade Center,
[55:35.040 --> 55:38.080]  a criminal element that could basically set up a police state.
[55:38.080 --> 55:42.880]  The CIA planted that story on us and asked us to put that in six months before 9-11.
[55:44.400 --> 55:47.600]  I mean, it's just incredible where they're going to blame Afghanistan for it and stuff.
[55:47.600 --> 55:53.600]  Why, I mean, is it coincidence? That's up on Infowars.com right now. But let's go to,
[55:53.600 --> 55:57.440]  who's up first here? Who's been holding the longest? Let's go to Ben in Mass who says
[55:57.440 --> 56:00.960]  he's been with the IDF counter-terror. Then we'll go to Tom and Anthony.
[56:01.680 --> 56:03.600]  Ben, what do you think about what's going on?
[56:03.600 --> 56:09.440]  Okay. I'm a long time listener and I enjoy the show very much. Thank you, Alex.
[56:09.440 --> 56:10.080]  Thank you for calling.
[56:11.280 --> 56:14.080]  Okay. A few quick points and I'll just let you run with it.
[56:16.400 --> 56:21.520]  Number one, a false flag subversion can be used to undermine faith in the government.
[56:22.960 --> 56:28.560]  There are many factions in competition with each other. Not all roads lead to the White House.
[56:28.560 --> 56:33.120]  The right hand does not necessarily know what the left hand is doing.
[56:34.400 --> 56:40.640]  This reminds me of Benghazi in many ways. Sometimes cops are not cops. There are units
[56:40.640 --> 56:44.400]  that can wear any kind of uniform to do the operation. Absolutely. Yep.
[56:45.280 --> 56:51.920]  This may be an attack on Obama. There will be additional suspects at large. That will bring
[56:51.920 --> 56:58.960]  the information to really know what's up. Also, the Hawk Survives the Tribe broadcast from
[56:58.960 --> 57:04.320]  Thursday, April 11th may have some significance. There's a lot of information in that show and
[57:05.040 --> 57:06.320]  I think we should all listen to it.
[57:08.640 --> 57:11.040]  What did they say? Shadows of this?
[57:12.800 --> 57:19.200]  Yes. He said it's about to go wild weasel. He was talking about OTMs crossing the border,
[57:19.200 --> 57:27.120]  the Mexican border, talking about Ahmed Rodriguez and Ahmed, you know.
[57:27.120 --> 57:31.600]  Oh, you're talking about a real right wing, triple false flag, letting real Muslims in
[57:31.600 --> 57:34.720]  to do a terror attack to point out that Obama's turning the whole world over to Muslims?
[57:36.320 --> 57:39.600]  Right. Like Benghazi to destroy his credibility.
[57:42.400 --> 57:48.480]  But why would Obama order the stand down of the joint chiefs and CENTCOM if it was a setup of
[57:48.480 --> 57:54.640]  Obama on Benghazi? Could be that the joint chiefs are just incompetent and they're partying like
[57:54.640 --> 57:58.960]  everyone else. I mean, the security forces are just sucking up money. They don't seem to be
[57:58.960 --> 58:05.120]  doing anything, really, and we're not safe. So that may be another message we're supposed
[58:05.120 --> 58:09.920]  to receive from this event. Yeah, I will say that most of the giant spy network that's in
[58:09.920 --> 58:14.720]  the U.S. now go around bragging that they're spies and driving around in black SUVs. I mean,
[58:14.720 --> 58:20.480]  it's ridiculous. It is totally ridiculous. I mean, you have any specifics on this or is this your
[58:20.480 --> 58:28.560]  gut from watching this event? I don't, you know, I don't have intel as far as, you know.
[58:28.560 --> 58:31.520]  Are you currently in counterterrorism in the Israeli Defense Force?
[58:32.640 --> 58:36.720]  No, sir, I'm out of the game. It's also corrupt and rotten.
[58:36.720 --> 58:39.840]  Oh, I would imagine. Listen, thanks for calling in. We're gonna come back with police officers.
[58:39.840 --> 58:47.520]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[59:10.720 --> 59:16.480]  of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes
[59:16.480 --> 59:20.880]  how the continuity of government program has established an all powerful shadow state.

[59:53.840 --> 59:59.040]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:59.040 --> 01:00:12.800]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:21.760]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:27.120]  All right, we're into our number two. I want to go quickly to
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:34.000]  army and police. And that army guy I was going to next, he just hung up 800,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.600]  25 at 9, 90 to 31. I want to get your take on what you've seen. Coming up on a play clips,
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:43.440]  they're openly trying to say the Tea Party did it, as I told you they would do.
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.160]  Now that doesn't mean that's not who they won't ultimately blame.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.520]  But we called it first and it's not hard to call it.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:56.640]  But let's go ahead and go to Tom, who is a police officer in Iowa.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.960]  What is your take on all this, Tom?
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:03.360]  God bless you, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, sir, I can.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.200]  God bless you and the crew for risking your lives, breaking the real news. I salute you.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:14.960]  I've been in law enforcement for 25 years. This was absolutely a false flag. I'm just wondering
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:19.520]  when they're going to bring their Adam Lanza or James Holmes out and try their truth serum that
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.080]  is totally fake drug. I'm just wondering when they're going to bring out their next patsy that
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.080]  is DARPA program, all drugged up on Prozac, Zoloft. But I have a hint that this patsy is
[01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:35.280]  probably going to be a patriot extremist. Never know what kind of characters they have in their
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:40.480]  programs. So I'm thinking they will find them, take them to jail, frame them like the Batman
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:48.160]  shooter. White House is pissed. You know what, Tom? Your phone broke up there.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:52.800]  Are you on a hands-free or go ahead and try again. You were talking about,
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.040]  yeah, their DARPA programs. Absolutely. Go ahead.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:02.640]  Oh, yeah. I'm just wondering when they're going to bring out their next patsy that is in a DARPA
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:08.720]  program, all drugged up on Prozac, Zoloft. But I have a hint that this patsy is probably going
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:14.240]  to be a patriot extremist. Never know what kind of character they have in their programs.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:19.120]  So I'm thinking they will find them, take them to jail, frame them like the Batman shooter
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.760]  or the Sandy Hooks hoax. Yeah, all they do is keep you on Halcyon,
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.360]  one pill they use to extract wisdom teeth to drug you up. You don't even know who you are when
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.280]  they're ripping your teeth out. They just give you a couple of those every day and give you a
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.200]  couple extra when you go before the trial and you'll say that you're a monkey's uncle.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:43.120]  You'll say that you're King Kong. You'll say that you're Popeye. And now they're saying
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.600]  that they're drugging Holmes for the trial and he's obviously bombed out of his brain.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:54.480]  They could grab me and put me on it and roll me out to say I did whatever they want.
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:58.880]  I mean, you're absolutely right. But hey, what about every TV show saying right wingers are
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.360]  going to blow stuff up, building up? It's so obvious that's when they're about to do it
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.680]  is when they run six months of that. That's the biggest thing right there
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:10.560]  is the entire propaganda operation. What do you say to that?
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:18.400]  Absolutely. They got Pillsbury Doughboy getting pat downs. They're just trying to get us
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.720]  our mindset for having the army right here out on the roads.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:26.400]  That's it. Now, when you talk to other police that you know, are they starting to wake up?
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.360]  Yes, sir. What do you think of the state police?
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.000]  Now that's a feedback there. What do you think of the state police coming out
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.720]  and saying, hey, we're in meetings with the feds asking if we'll arrest Christians in mass.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:47.200]  I mean, how creepy is this getting? It's terrible. This pretty soon we're just
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:51.440]  all going to be in FEMA camps. Well, I hope that's not the case. God bless you.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.800]  By the way, I talked to Eric Muller Mancal this morning. I was on via phone on his number one TV
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:04:02.800]  show simulcast radio show in Chicago. And he said, listen, yesterday I got photos of this. By the
[01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:08.080]  way, ask Rob do about it. I told him to send them there. I talked to his producer. He's driving
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:15.600]  along and sees an army truck with blonde haired blue eyed dummies bags with bullet holes in them
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:21.360]  and dirt falling out. So he follows it to a gas station when they pull off. And he goes over and
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.480]  talks to the army troops. And they go, yeah, I know we were in an exercise shoot preparing for
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.720]  civil unrest. And of course, you have the targets of five year olds. They're shooting. You have the
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.920]  admission of those drills. But he said he's reportedly they sent him to rob do guys.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:42.640]  I forgot to tell you about that. He's got photos of a truck full of the dummies with like, you
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:47.360]  know, wigs on them of like blonde haired women. And again, my issue is it's always, quote, white
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.080]  al-Qaeda. And now the state police have come out going, yeah, we're being asked what we go to take
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.120]  only the Christians guns. I mean, like, will you arrest only the Jews? I mean, it's just pure
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.400]  tyranny. We're gonna come back with Dave, Ryan, Craig and others. In the last two years alone,
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:08.480]  the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S.,
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:13.360]  costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:18.160]  in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind. And so you don't think you will be
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:24.160]  affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:28.800]  not be able to control mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.680]  cost and availability of your food supply with e Foods Direct. Be prepared before you need it.

[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:38.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now into our number two on this 16th day of April 2013. Coming up,
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:43.760]  popping in, Joel Skousen, World Affairs Brief, really an expert on terrorism. Doug Hagman,
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.800]  also an expert on terrorism, Northeast Intelligence Network, joining us.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.720]  And then Stuart Rose, who's actually driving on his way to Boston right now for the Oath
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:56.560]  Keepers event on the 19th, the law enforcement and police military organization that swears to
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:01.440]  uphold the Bill of Rights and Constitution that they swore an oath to. How incredibly evil that
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:06.080]  the media has been demonizing and claiming might be involved in terrorism with no evidence.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:12.080]  He's gonna be joining us as well. So a jam-packed two hours coming up.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:16.720]  If your station just joined us, if you go to infowars.com and prisonplanet.com,
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.840]  we have local witnesses on local TV saying they were running a drill, saying don't worry,
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:28.800]  it's only part of a drill with bomb sniffing dogs. My reporter, Rob Dew, his brother-in-law,
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.320]  who's in Army Intelligence and part of the official Army Marathon team, was pulled out,
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:38.720]  quote, for dehydration and sent to the hospital. They came and pulled him out. He thought it was
[01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:44.720]  weird. They pulled him out. He was up near the front at the end of the race when the bomb went
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:49.760]  off. They pulled him out right before. Very, very bizarre. And they're trying to deny that
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.840]  even went on. They're trying to deny that there was a drill or that their guys were on the roof.
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:10:00.080]  So very suspicious. And I've told you, I've seen troops on the streets, TSA checkpoints where I
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.560]  live, they're saying get ready for the Tea Party to bomb America, which is the last thing the Tea
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:10.160]  Party would ever do. We know the globalist staged Oklahoma City. I'm in the film A Noble Lie that
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.800]  we sell that has police officers there talking about the feds planting the bombs. Eye witnesses
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.520]  to the fact that this very attorney general, who was deputy attorney general at the time,
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.200]  was involved in a cover-up. This is the same attorney general that ran fast and furious,
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:30.560]  that's killed thousands, thousands of people. Some numbers are 400. That's the most conservative.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:36.960]  The most numbers are over 2,000. They run false flags. They've given 10,000 heat-seeking missiles
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.000]  to Al-Qaeda. Saudi Arabia has been given control of Libya and Syria. Our government and NATO are
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.480]  backing them. So they're saying on one hand, it could be Al-Qaeda. And then saying Iran could be
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.240]  involved when Iran and Al-Qaeda are at each other's throats, one Shiite, one Sunni.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:58.400]  And then on the other hand, I'm about to play a bunch of clips and then go to your phone calls
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:06.880]  here. David, Brian, Craig, all of you, John, Eddie, we're gonna get to all of you. Police
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.480]  military, I wanna hear from you on this. We have people that were at the marathon.
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.960]  Brian was at the marathon. We'll go to him first. Eddie, friend is a fed, has Intel. We're gonna
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:19.440]  get to all of you. Just have your point quickly ready. But here's the deal. They wanna use this
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:24.720]  to turn America into a police state, okay? And that's who stands to gain. It's bigger than Obama.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:28.560]  And they've been gearing up for this to happen. And that's why they're the prime suspects,
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:32.640]  that is somebody inside the shadow government. Because they've been caught doing it before,
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.640]  they stand to gain from it, and we've been predicting it. And you've seen the incredible
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:42.800]  buildup and propaganda in every drama, every sitcom, every police show that the Tea Party
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:51.280]  is gonna blow up public events. Just every show, I turn on TV, you see it, shows about remaking
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:58.240]  houses injected somehow into nonfiction shows. I mean, it's just everywhere, everywhere.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.200]  It's the full demonization and the police are being told prepare to mass arrest Christians.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:09.440]  That's in mainstream news, Fox News, and it seems crazy. That's all coming out now. Okay,
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:15.360]  are they getting ready, peaking everybody's entrance like a whodunit, Agatha Christie,
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:21.680]  whodunit? Is it the Muslims? And notice it's Muslims right wing. There's only two groups.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.680]  It's right wingers and Muslims. It's right wingers and Al Qaeda. See, now they're flipping
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.080]  the script from Al Qaeda to right wingers. They may go ahead and say it's Al Qaeda.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.040]  But the point is they're already introducing right winger Tea Party is the same as Al Qaeda.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:40.560]  Gun owner, same as Al Qaeda. Regardless, this is the psych warfare event. And I said it and was
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.960]  demonized. I said it within two minutes of it being announced yesterday in overdrive with
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:49.920]  Richard Belzer right at three o'clock central when all this stuff happened right at 4 Eastern.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:56.960]  I said it and within minutes salon, document cam shot please. Within minutes for TV viewers,
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.880]  you can watch us right now. Free streams at info wars.com forward slash listen.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:09.760]  Listen, okay, so here's the document cam right here. Alex Jones, Boston explosion,
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.800]  a government conspiracy. And I said it will be a false flag to be blamed on the Tea Party
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.200]  and expand TSA reach. Now that was my tweets. That's what I said on air.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.320]  And they love the fact that one of the people tweeting for me to the typos was real funny for
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.640]  them. You try doing a radio show and tweeting. Here's the blaze with absolutely no evidence
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:30.480]  Alex Jones calls Boston Marathon a false flag. Okay, they actually have my tweet.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.840]  I said our hearts go out to all those that have been hurt or killed. But the FBI has been behind
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:39.680]  virtually every domestic event. And I linked to the New York Times actually saying that.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.200]  Doesn't matter. Then later, the blaze came out an hour later and said they're gonna blame right
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.840]  wing. So instead of being saying I'm right and I'm not at odds with the blaze. They're always
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:54.160]  doing this to me, okay? Now look who he's with the George Soros media. Alex Jones declares
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:58.560]  Boston a false flag operation FBI FBI behind every terror plot.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:03.440]  No, I linked to the New York Times saying that I'm about to show you. So again, act like only
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.600]  I said it and find a picture of me wearing camo that I wear maybe once a month to make it look
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:12.160]  like I'm in the militia. But there's nothing wrong with that. Here you go. CNN National Security
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.800]  Analyst. Now see, I'm a kook for saying this. But one hour later, CNN National Security Analyst
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:21.680]  warns of right wing extremists behind Boston bombings. Boom, and we have a video clip of that
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:27.360]  we're going to in a minute. Axelrod, top White House minion, operative in the media.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.720]  Obama thinks Boston bombings could be related to tax day, a patriot group. I thought I was a kook.
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:39.200]  I thought I was wrong. Salon, media eye, media matters, Glenn Beck. Look at this,
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.520]  real clear politics. Sink saying, it can be a right wing guy.
[01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:50.560]  The Young Turks, CNN, right wing extremists to blame for explosions, world net daily.
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.640]  Boston marathon explosions already being blamed on the right from the blaze. Well,
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:57.680]  wait a minute, I thought without any proof, I said that was gonna happen.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.800]  I mean, I thought I'm a bad guy. But then right there, again, just come on, man,
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:11.200]  we're in the same trench. Stop doing this to me. Boston Marathon, the initial theories.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.920]  London Independent, they predict it's right wing extremists. Boom, I'm right again.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.040]  Irish Examiner, right wing. Expert says right wing terrorists most likely have bombed Boston.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.760]  That's how you demonize your political opposition. You bomb stuff, blame it on them.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:28.160]  Can't beat them fair and square, stage a bombing, blame them. Without facts,
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:32.720]  pundits spread rumors and blame Boston bombing on the government. CBS News, what do you mean
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.800]  without facts? There's a drill, but you claim, I claim there's a drill.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.200]  CNN National Security Analysts warns of right wing extremists behind Boston bombings.
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:51.200]  Town Hall, boom. Breitbart, same headline. Wolf Blitzer. Okay, so let's get it established.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:54.800]  I said they would do this, not because I have a big brain, it's a no brainer,
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.280]  then I'm going to your phone calls. And then I'm wrong when it all comes true.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:06.640]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, they are setting up to have these all over the country. If we accept
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.600]  this, get into the fear, the media's hyping it. This is the whole paradigm shift to go into total
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:17.040]  martial law to stop the Tea Party bombing everybody. And to get Republicans to apologize
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.520]  for what the Tea Party's done. If they blame it on the Tea Party and Republicans apologize,
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.160]  it's over. Total communist takeover run by foreign offshore banks.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.200]  We've got to understand, they stand to gain from this, they have the history,
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.200]  they did fast and furious. Now let's play a few of these clips and then go to your calls.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.000]  Here's Bill O'Reilly last night saying, hey, Patriots Day, just saying, here it is.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.360]  So far, no one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:48.560]  Perhaps it's a coincidence, but this week marks the anniversary of attacks in Oklahoma City,
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:54.080]  Columbine, Colorado, and Virginia Tech. Also the Waco assault in 1993.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:01.840]  Okay, so there's O'Reilly doing his job. BBC, here's BBC saying it one hour after the attacks,
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.920]  minutes after I said it, saying they blame us. Here's BBC.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:11.040]  The other thing I think I'd say is that if this does turn out to be a terrorism,
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.520]  don't immediately jump to conclusions about who's responsible. There's some,
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.880]  it's more than rumor, it's chatter from within the intelligence services
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:27.360]  that suggests that it might not be what one's mind perhaps leaps to of Islamic radicals,
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:35.280]  but that it could be homegrown extremists who of course have attacked in the past within America.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.840]  Indeed, one recalls the Oklahoma bomb, of course, which was attributed initially to
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:47.520]  Islamic terrorists and turned out to be homegrown. Yes, exactly. And there's reports that that
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.200]  happened on, I'm not saying reports because I just haven't had time to check it out,
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:56.720]  but that happened also on Patriot Day, which is today, the first Monday in April.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.960]  So that might have a special significance. And we know that the Homeland Security have
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.920]  Oh, thank God for Homeland Security. Let's never look at Homeland Security.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.400]  I mean, security services for hundreds of years have been famous for staging their own bombings
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.400]  and shootings to take control. They're always the number one culprit taught in mainline
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:22.880]  criminology and history books. But oh, Alex Jones said, hey, they're running a drill and told people
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:27.440]  be calm before it happened. And we're pulling members of the army running team out to protect
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.960]  them right before it happened. Oh, Alex Jones says they're gonna blame the right wing, which
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:36.480]  they're doing. He's bad. Let's go to the Young Turks talking about it, then we'll go to break
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.400]  and come back with your calls. Here's the Young Turks.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:43.680]  Some who believe it might be right wing terrorists. That suspicion is also understandable.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:47.360]  Let me give you a sense of why. First of all, it was tax day. Second of all-
[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:51.120]  All right, let's move on from him. I wanna get to Chris Matthews. Let's go to Chris Matthews
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.720]  here trying to blame us. Again, I said they do this.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:58.880]  It's Patriot Day, it's the marathon day, it's the Kennedy Library always up there. And also,
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.520]  as you pointed out, I just forgot cuz I filed already this filing day for the federal income
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:08.480]  tax, which does cause some emotions around the country, sometimes in the wrong parts of the
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.720]  brain. Anyway, thank you, Congressman Kennedy, for joining us from Massachusetts. Well, Michael,
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:17.120]  tax day today, that came up- That's enough, get it off there. And I've got more and more clips,
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:22.400]  and then I've got Glenn Beck saying, how dare I say they'd blame the right wing?
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:28.880]  I mean, obviously, that was gonna happen. And again, I expect it from George Soros groups.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.120]  And I still, Olive Branch, God bless you. Fine, if you think you're gonna be safe with
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:36.240]  these people, cuz they're guaranteed gonna do stuff and blame it on you, Glenn.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.920]  They're guaranteed. They've already done it to me before. They're gonna, in mass shootings,
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.280]  you name it, they're gonna go look on a computer. If the person ever visited your website,
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.120]  they're gonna blame you. And I'll be there protecting you when it happens, cuz I'm not
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:53.120]  a scumbag. Okay, we're gonna come back with police and military. Then we've got Joel Skalzen.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.680]  Stay there, David, John, Brian, Eddie, Craig. We're going to Brian, who was at the marathon,
[01:19:57.680 --> 01:19:59.680]  when we come back. Stay with us, call us straight in.

[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:36.240]  wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:41.120]  been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:45.760]  your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:51.920]  would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising

[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.800]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:10.240]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:14.800]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:20.480]  could obtain this world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around
[01:23:20.480 --> 01:23:25.360]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:31.680]  of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only

[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.960]  wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:52.240]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com. That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com. That's 1-866-836-8735,

[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.800]  This is all scripted, designed to target low-grade morons that are the general public,
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.760]  unfortunately. Now I'm gonna go to your phone calls now. Then I've got a big data dump of info
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.920]  coming up in the next segment. We'll continue with calls. Dan Madani's gonna be popping in.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:43.280]  So is Joel Skalzen. So is the head of Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes, today. But without
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:49.040]  further ado, Brian in Mass says you were at the marathon. Thank you for calling in today. Glad
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.880]  you're okay or hope you're okay. What can you tell us, sir? Well, thanks, Alex, for putting me
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:00.080]  on the show here today. I appreciate everything that you're doing. Thank you. Okay, so what I
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.640]  want to do is I don't know if I have bad luck or not. I'm actually originally from Connecticut.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:10.480]  I actually work at Newtown High School. I'm a coach there, but my girlfriend lives up here,
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:16.000]  and she goes to BU, and I decided to do the 5K run before, the day before the Boston Marathon they
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.920]  do. And it was the same thing that pretty much run down there by the finals. So I kind of ran down
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:28.240]  there the day before running by all that stuff, which was kind of pretty eerie. But where it
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.520]  happened, where I was, was about a mile and a half from where it ended on Beacon. And I didn't hear
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:39.120]  the bombs where I were, but my girlfriend's roommate was down there a little bit closer,
[01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:44.320]  and she heard everything. And it was just incredible. And just to relate back to the
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.400]  Sandy Hook thing, and I've been doing a lot of research there, listening to YouTube for a while,
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:53.120]  and everything is just going, you know, everything's just twisted, and everything's
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.080]  kind of just bringing itself together. All these false flag events are really, you know,
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:03.520]  the same feeling from Sandy Hook I'm getting here now. And it was very, it was hard to sleep last
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:07.600]  night. Well, look, I mean, this is a global corporate empire. It's got to have events to
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:12.800]  keep control of the people. And I'm just glad they didn't kill more people to sell their police
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.960]  state. But it's not going well for them. Just like the underwear bomber, the government got the
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:22.480]  guy on the plane. We broke that here. And later it came out in Congress that indeed they ordered
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.480]  him to be allowed on the plane and that everybody said he was drugged up. So I'm glad you're okay.
[01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:33.120]  Good to hear from you. And let's go to the next caller here. Let's go to Eddie in Texas,
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.680]  says his friend is a Fed, has Intel. Eddie, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:44.240]  Hey, Alex. Yeah, I was just sitting here and a buddy of mine, he's a, he has a federal job.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:49.760]  And he told me, I got to stop by your shop. And I said, sure, why not? So he comes over here and he
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:54.800]  tells me, you know, we talk about the bombing and whatnot. And then he tells me, okay, there's
[01:26:54.800 --> 01:27:00.720]  reasons I can't give you, but I feel bad if I didn't give you a warning. Buy as much ammo as
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:06.480]  you can. The only thing I can tell you is buy as much ammo as you can. His friend in the Pentagon
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:12.800]  is not, he will not give me any critical information as to why, but he just told me,
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:19.440]  buy as much ammo as you can, double it. I don't care if you have two, if you have 21 shotguns or
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:26.160]  whatever, you double that by the end of the month. Wow. So you talked to your source and he said his
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:31.200]  friend at the Pentagon just said, get as much ammo as you can. That's exactly what he said.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.480]  And I told him, did they declare martial law in Boston? He said, no, they declared a state of
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.800]  emergency different. And I said, well, you know, I heard different things and he said,
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.960]  all I'm going to tell you and all I'm authorized to tell you is the same thing I've been telling
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.520]  you, buy more ammo. And he told me-
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:52.000]  Well, yeah, I mean, absolutely. Look, the state police came out in Colorado last week and said,
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.960]  we've been told to prepare to confiscate the guns of Christians only. I mean, right there,
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:02.160]  the whole government should be arrested. And then Fox News reports, yeah, the army's being told
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.760]  evangelicals and Catholics and other Christians are in with Al-Qaeda and they're listed as
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:13.760]  extremists. I mean, it's an authoritarian takeover. And we're going to get Joel Skousen's
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:18.000]  take on this. He's always thinking it's more down the road, but they can always move timetables up
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.560]  when they're behind. I mean, you've got all the North Korea craziness going on, the Iran craziness.
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:27.280]  And maybe they're testing us right now, but we're going to find out. Thank you,
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.080]  Eddie. Let's talk to Dave, who's in the Marine Corps. Dave, what is your take on all this?
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.760]  How you doing, Alex? I'm not doing too good. I mean, have I not been saying, I mean,
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:41.600]  when every show says the Tea Party's going to blow up public events, I mean,
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:45.680]  that's pre-programming. I mean, I've seen them do this before. This looks bad. Go ahead. What
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.920]  do you think is happening? I'm going to tell you exactly what's happening.
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:57.440]  The martial art is coming in a couple of days. The next thing is, in the video,
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:07.600]  two seconds before the blast, in intel, the lady with the black shirt, black shorts,
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:15.680]  she's the last one to cross the finish line before the bombs goes off. The four first letters are
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:27.280]  1979. That's very important. Every historical event in 1979 leads up to what has started in
[01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:35.440]  January and leads up to December. Margaret Thatcher, she became Prime Minister in 1979.
[01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:48.160]  A run with the hostages in 1979. Also, you have in 1979.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.480]  Hold on, stay there. Joel Scouser's coming up. I don't want you to be able to finish.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:57.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:06.960]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.800]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.

[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:51.760]  show. In the middle of the second hour, Joel Skalzen, who heads up World Affairs Brief and
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:57.120]  of course was a Marine Corps fighter pilot during the Vietnam era and is really an expert on
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:34:02.880]  geopolitical actions and activities, is going to be joining us here in just a moment.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.600]  Obviously, I get so focused on big news events like this that I don't even talk about our sponsors
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.760]  or the different things that I'm doing. Remember to support Infowars.com.
[01:34:13.760 --> 01:34:20.400]  Remember to buy the books, the T-shirts, the films, the information at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:25.920]  We have the Seed Center up there where you can get all the very best non-GMO,
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:30.960]  non-hybrid seed varieties at the lowest cost out there. We're very, very extremely competitive.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:36.480]  The Infowars Seed Center at InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsHealth.com,
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.400]  the ProPure water filters you can call or order them online with promo code water and save 10%
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:49.280]  off any of the ProPure or any of the water filtration systems. Again, that's InfowarsStore.com,
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:52.640]  the best system out there at the lowest price, hands down.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.120]  Look at the side-by-side comparisons with the competition. And also don't forget,
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:03.760]  we're sending out video feeds right now, as well as the free audio feeds during this new
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.280]  escalation false flag event. The fingerprints are very clear.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:13.280]  We don't just jump to those conclusions. There were drills as usual,
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.960]  stand downs. Now they're saying there weren't drills even though they're admitted.
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:21.520]  Army personnel being pulled out who were in the marathon, people we know and told,
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:27.360]  no, you're going for a wellness check. I'm fine, no, come with us. We've got all that going on.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:32.480]  You've got the immediate right wingers are behind it, but they're not ever actually finding the
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:37.760]  patsy yet, letting it grow. You've got all that happening. So we're gonna get Joel Skalzen's take
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.720]  on that in just one moment. But don't forget, you can go to Infowars.com forward slash listen
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:47.680]  and find the video feed, the free video feed. And please send that out on your email list,
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:51.280]  your Twitter, your Facebook, your friends and family, so they can get an alternative
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:57.200]  of what's happening. I am being demonized. How dare Alex Jones say that the Tea Party
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:05.360]  would be blamed? When, of course, they did. How dare Alex Jones say that there was a drill,
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:10.000]  when there was a drill. And they had loudspeakers saying, be calm, it's no big deal.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.120]  Never mind, we're placing these pressure cooker bags next to you.
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:22.880]  They do these false flags so ham-fistedly, always the same MO with the drill. It looks like there
[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:26.480]  weren't even probably patsies, though they'll probably present a drugged up patsy very,
[01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:32.080]  very soon, bombed out of their mind on Halcyon and five other drugs. So real briefly,
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.840]  cut to the chase there, Dave. Is this something you speculate on, on the messages they like to
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:41.680]  leave calling cards like the ace of spades? Or is this intel you're getting from your
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:47.120]  sources in the Marine Corps? This is intel that we get from the Marine Corps.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:56.480]  This is a domestic false flag, it's not international. The building did not blow up,
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:02.960]  that would have been international. This is all domestic, this is the false flag.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:11.440]  And there is one more event that's gonna take place. It's domestic and I'll send you an email,
[01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.600]  but I can't talk more.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.840]  Well, you're being told by, what area of the Marine Corps are you in?
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.560]  I can't tell you.
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.200]  Well, I mean, specifically though, sometimes they tell you guys stuff that is going to happen,
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.040]  but it really doesn't. But you're being told that within days, there's gonna be an event
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:44.960]  that triggers martial law? Yeah, yeah. I just watched Price of Oil, also a certain embassy.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:52.400]  Well, I noticed that gold imploded yesterday, the stock market went down big time and then
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.440]  all this started. Big of things afoot with Iran, big things afoot with North Korea,
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:01.200]  a very bizarre time. Thank you so much for the call, sir, God bless you.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:05.440]  That caller sounds very credible. Government people, as I've met with them and talked to
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.480]  them in private, get very, very nervous about talking about anything they're being told.
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:14.640]  But a lot of times they're in their own echo chamber with even more propaganda.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:18.640]  Now, somebody I really respect and who's got his finger on the pulse at a lot of levels
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:24.240]  is Joel Skalzen, who I just introduced to World Affairs Brief. And I don't know his take on this
[01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:30.000]  yet, we're gonna get his full take on it right now. But again, I'll tell you, when every drama,
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.600]  every cop show, every sitcom, I mean, I randomly in a hotel room turn it on.
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:37.120]  And I've asked listeners about it, and they say everything they see, every show,
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:44.080]  whether it's drama, fiction, nonfiction, news, cop shows, the Tea Party is killing children
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:49.600]  and burying them in their backyard. They're bombing the football game, they're shooting
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:57.840]  police officers, they're mass murdering. I mean, it is greater demonization, which he deserved,
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:04.560]  that I saw of Hitler in 41, 42, 43, 44, 45 in Disney cartoons and stuff.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:12.880]  I mean, it's to the power of ten. I mean, that we are being demonized as the enemy. And if you know
[01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:17.520]  military basic propaganda, I mean, this tells you, okay, we're about to be set up. I mean,
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.480]  it's not, it's an absolute no brainer. I mean, you turn on MTV, anything,
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:26.880]  Joel Skalzen, that right there is why I said, tis the season. You were on two weeks ago and I said,
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:31.600]  I feel a false flag is imminent. And I said that yesterday before it happened,
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:35.680]  imminent. I mean, you have the ADL sending letters to Obama saying,
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:40.240]  we warned you, we warned Clinton right before the last bombing in 95, we're telling you it's
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:44.160]  imminent. And that's so they can grandstand and say, see, we told you it's imminent when they
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:49.680]  were in Elohim City running the compound McVeigh was in. And feds that blew the whistle got arrested
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:56.720]  like a hell. So I mean, just the way they grandstand publicly, red alert and I believe,
[01:39:56.720 --> 01:40:00.400]  just like I said on 9-11, I believe there'll be a bio attack now. I don't know how I knew that.
[01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:04.880]  That was the anthrax. And thank God the media attacked me, that's on record.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:11.040]  Joel, I'm ranting here. What is your take on all this? I mean, not just my intel, my intellect,
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:17.600]  my spirit, my gut is just reeling off the chart and was before the show yesterday.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.320]  Joel Skalzen, I think this is just the beginning of something bigger.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:28.720]  Well, Alex, it has all of the hallmarks of a government false flag operation. The first
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:33.920]  and foremost one is they always pick high profile events to have the maximum press coverage,
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.560]  the maximum impact on people, whether it's attacking a federal building in the Murrah
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.200]  building, which was clearly a government operation. There were other explosive devices
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:48.480]  found around that building and the local television station took pictures of them.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.040]  They were told to shut down those pictures and not show any of that. They wanted to especially
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:58.400]  point that to a right wing terrorist, which they did. There were many other things about that,
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:06.320]  including eliminating the earthquake seismographs, which showing two explosions.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:10.720]  They edited out the films of the various convenience stores, which went off
[01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:17.200]  during the explosion. The films would have showed shaking twice inside the building.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.600]  They removed those. Sure, and FBI agents came out in the L.A. Times and said they'd seen the
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:27.280]  footage. It was McVeigh with six other guys. That's right. And so, you know, whether it's
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:32.720]  the Murrah building or whether it's a Murrah building or whether it's 9-11 or even the first
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:38.400]  World Trade Center building, these were clearly false flag operations involved with terrorists
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:47.280]  hired by the United States. And there was also a drill going on with airliners crashing into
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:51.760]  buildings going on on the very day that 9-11 happened. Explain why they do drills.
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:58.240]  Well, drills, first of all, have two purposes. One, in case there's a problem, you know,
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.720]  they've got cover in the sense that they if they want to back out, they've got cover. But more
[01:42:02.720 --> 01:42:10.000]  importantly, they tie up resources. They diminish the ability of first responders in aircraft or
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.600]  fighter aircraft during 9-11 to respond because it was just a drill. And so it stopped everyone
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:22.000]  from being locked into the position of immediately responding because they were conflicted with the
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:26.720]  fact that is this a drill or is this real? Yeah, that way they didn't respond to the first two.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:32.560]  But then from what I have, refused orders by the third one. I went ahead and it was recorded two
[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:37.120]  AIM-9s, which I guess are Sidewinders. And then, of course, then they wanted to cover that up that
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:44.400]  basically Air Force people refused to follow orders to stand down. Well, I had a call as
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:49.360]  editor of the World Affairs Brief from a tower operator at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:54.080]  And he said, you know, I personally got the order from the base commander to shut down the tower,
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:01.680]  not let any fighter aircraft take off. So there really were stand-down orders in this case.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:08.240]  There's a couple of other things that are telltale science about this Boston bombing. And one of
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:13.600]  those is that it's a low-grade explosive. If you see the pictures of that, you see red and orange
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:19.200]  fire associated with the explosives. You don't see that with high explosives. It's either zero
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:25.280]  zero light emission or it's white, pure white. There is no orange or red unless it's a low-grade
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:31.520]  explosive. And that indicates that this is something that can be easily blamed on an amateur,
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:37.280]  somebody domestic. It's very difficult to get high explosives unless you're government. I think that
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:43.200]  they have a reason to use low-grade explosives so they can more easily pin this on amateurs
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:47.920]  or someone who would appear to be involved in the American right wing. I don't know how they're
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:52.880]  going to do it yet. They certainly haven't had anyone claim responsibility. And if it's a normal
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:44:01.280]  terrorist attack, almost always, almost always, you have an organization claim the purpose.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:04.720]  I mean, what's the purpose of killing a lot of innocent people if you aren't going to
[01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:10.560]  dramatize your cause and make a demand and make your demands. And so the demand is we're going
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:14.880]  to put TSA on the streets, sticking their hands down your pants and an army everywhere. And I've
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:19.040]  already seen this in Austin last month. That's why I said they're getting close. I can't go to
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:24.320]  the kite festival. I can't go to a sporting event. Here's the National Guard to search my bags and
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:31.440]  grab my wife. Now, Joel, expanding on this, I'm getting chatter, not just on air,
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:35.600]  but off air from military sources that they were already told get ready for something this week
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:41.280]  and that bigger stuff's coming. Now, they may just be testing them, but all the buildup,
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.400]  you know, well, where do you expect this to go? I know you don't like to speculate, but
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:51.440]  I mean, just looking at how they're already saying Al Qaeda right wing, Al Qaeda right wing,
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:55.280]  even if they don't blame it on right wing later, they're already conflating the two terms.
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:00.000]  Well, first of all, I don't think there's any way that you're going to hold a major mass
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.080]  marathon again without extreme security measures. In other words, it's going to justify TSA getting
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:13.280]  bigger and bodier in your face all of the time. And this is part of the reason for the shoe bombers
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:17.520]  and the various other bombers, which are fake bombers. There's no way that a trained terrorist
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:23.760]  would not know that you can't set off plastic explosive in a shoe by a match. You cannot do it.
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:29.280]  Everybody knows that even Marine Corps, you know, corporals know that. Well, that guy was completely
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.880]  drugged out of his mind, just like the other guy who we know got on the plane when the government
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:40.080]  got him on the plane. That is right. But I do not believe, Alex, that this necessarily pretends
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:47.040]  a major martial law event within a couple of days. I personally discount what this person who claimed
[01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:52.800]  to be low level in the Marine Corps was getting from so-called Intel. Look, I'm an officer in the
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.160]  Marine Corps. I can tell you that even a higher officer, you don't get any leaks because the
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:46:04.080]  Marine Corps doesn't get this kind of intel. It just never happens, especially down at the lower
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:09.440]  levels. So I really think that there's a lot of people taking advantage to try to, you know,
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.960]  pretend like they know something. I'll bet you any amount of money, you won't see anything in
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:19.360]  two days in terms of martial law. No, no, I tend to agree with you because they want to roll things,
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:23.680]  they want to roll things out slowly. That's the way they're going to get us for sure.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:29.120]  If they move too quick, it wakes people up. But exactly. But they've got state police coming out
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:34.160]  going. We're being told to prepare to have war with Christians. So the brainwashing is starting
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:38.000]  to get down to the lower levels. So I would imagine, you know, they're in a briefing going
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  big stuff could happen in the next few days. Get ready. Then there's a bunch of speculation.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:46.560]  I mean, I think you've got to remember, Alex, that a lot of this is to bait the right wing,
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:52.400]  to leak these things out. There is no way I can tell you that they will openly come out and say
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:55.760]  or tell these people we're going after because of the Christians. There's too many Christians
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:00.320]  in the state police. They would leak that which they have. And what I'm saying there,
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:05.600]  I think trying to bait Christians into some big uprising to make us look more radical than we
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:11.600]  really are. There is just no way that they would tell that because it isn't just Christians that
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:15.920]  would raise too many questions. They can get away with saying it's the right wing militia or it's
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:21.200]  the and not even the Tea Party can they get away with particularly. I agree with you that it's
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:25.120]  energizing libertarians and conservatives and constitutionalist. But you're looking at it from
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:30.480]  a psychological perspective of why is it so over the top? This is debate. They've shifted into some
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:35.360]  other psych warfare systems where they do outrageous things to create a bigger normalcy
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:41.360]  bias. So down the road, we accept it. But I agree they're not ready now. Yes. Well, that's what I'm
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:46.640]  saying is that we've got to be very careful of these leaks of imminency. I mean, there was one
[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:51.120]  this so-called North Carolina trooper who got on various Internet shows and says that martial law
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:57.040]  was going to be in March and everything and it never happened. And I'm just saying we really
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:00.320]  got to be careful. These guys are very smart. What we're dealing with, they're not going to do
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:04.320]  anything that's going to prove that there's a conspiracy. I agree with you. Now, let me expand
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.120]  on this. They're not happy that our reporter, Dan Madan, who's coming up, got into not one,
[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:12.960]  but two of the press conferences and took them over. And we got them to basically deny that
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:18.160]  there was even a drill, even though there were drills with them announcing everything's fine,
[01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:26.160]  relax, stay calm. This is just a drill. I mean, they're certainly not in control of the narrative
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:30.640]  and they're hopping mad right now that we've injected the term false flag into the national
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:36.400]  narrative. Well, let me tell you that here's a mainstream television news station in the Boston
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.800]  area, Local 15 interviewing the University of Mobile, Alabama's cross country coach.
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:50.560]  His name is Ollie Stevenson, and he says he was at it near the finish line of Boston Marathon.
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.160]  There were serious explosions went off and he thought there was odd there were bomb sniffing
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.120]  dogs at the start and finish lines. They kept making announcements to the participants not
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:04.240]  to worry, just a training exercise, just like you just said. Here is written and television
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.880]  confirmation with an interview that this is all true. In fact, he says, I don't believe it was
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.840]  just a training exercise. He says, I think they must have had some sort of threat suspicion called
[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.160]  in, and that's why they were there. So their denial that they didn't have any idea is a pure
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:23.760]  lie. Well, have you heard Rob Dew, whose brother-in-law is in army intelligence, pretty
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:30.000]  high level, and he's a champion marathon guy. He's on the marathon team for the army. He was there
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.320]  because his family's from New Jersey. He was there and they pulled him out right towards the end and
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.240]  said, you need to go to the hospital, you're dehydrated. And he's like, what? And that's an
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:43.280]  order. Now, is that not pretty important? Yeah, that's an indication that somebody had
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:49.840]  advance notice of that, and I'm convinced there was. So we're going to wait and see what happens.
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:57.200]  I'm convinced they won't overplay this other than to induce a lot more TSA scrutiny of every major
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:02.880]  event. And this will certainly justify it. I certainly would feel nervous about running a
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:10.480]  marathon. So it's part of the incremental rollout of just soft martial law. We don't get there
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:16.640]  overnight, we just slowly cook. And it does accustom people to increase scrutiny of the
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:22.240]  government. And I'm just covering the World Affairs brief for Friday, this almost $4 billion
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:27.760]  Homeland Security building that several congressmen are trying to stop because of the cost overruns
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.720]  and all of the budget sequestration, et cetera. But, you know, one comment that one of the
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:37.200]  congressmen says, if we don't stop this now before they can get everybody under one roof,
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.760]  he says, we'll never be able to dismantle Department of Homeland Security. And I think
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:47.120]  he's absolutely right. Yeah. And again, all those votes are happening right now. So this is a great
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.240]  diversion for the gun bills, the open border bills and the Homeland Security takeover bill.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:55.440]  And that's what I said at the start of the show, folks, come back and tell me what you think about
[01:50:55.440 --> 01:50:59.440]  geopolitical movements. One more segment, the Damodandis coming on and then a bunch of other
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:05.360]  guests. But in the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:12.080]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:16.480]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:21.440]  out of mind. And so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are. We all are.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:26.160]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[01:51:26.160 --> 01:51:31.600]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with

[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:07.680]  your family shivering in the dark because you couldn't afford to pay your electric bill.
[01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:12.240]  That's closer than you think. You probably haven't heard about this yet because the liberal media has
[01:53:12.240 --> 01:53:18.800]  been suppressing what is fast becoming the most shocking news story of 2012. Obama's secret war
[01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.760]  on coal that could increase your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months.
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:29.120]  As shocking as it sounds, it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out
[01:53:29.120 --> 01:53:36.240]  across America. But here's some good news. There's an underground video at exposed123.com that
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:41.040]  thousands of smart patriots have used to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:47.360]  The video at exposed123.com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:52.000]  everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark. So watch it now at
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  exposed123.com before it's too late. Again, that's exposed123.com.
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:14.800]  All right, I'm kind of hyperventilating as usual just because I'm immersed in this stuff. But
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:20.080]  you look at videos where Californians sign petitions to confiscate firearms and
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:25.600]  you know, arrest constitutionalists. And it really shows how much trouble this country's in.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:30.800]  But talking to Joel Skalzen who studies false flags, and I want to look at Iran and North
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:34.480]  Korea briefly, just everything is obviously heating up. I'm not saying it's all gonna blow
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:39.200]  up tomorrow, but there are big events, there are big expansions, there are event horizons.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:42.560]  And I think we've clearly entered one with a crescendo of propaganda.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:49.360]  But how many police would they have involved? Obviously, they'd have an inter-agency secret
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.400]  unit within, so the other cops didn't know, they'd be right next to guys that were part of the drill.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:58.880]  And then they think the cops are so dumb and so compartmentalized that they blow stuff up right
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:02.720]  in front of them and then they don't even get it. Or if a cop does get it, like the police at
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:07.200]  Oklahoma City, they just kill them. I mean, how do they get away with stuff like this when it's
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:12.880]  so obvious? Well, you've got to remember that there's a lot of questions, police aren't dumb.
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:17.200]  They do see these same anomalies we do, but there's a tremendous amount of pressure inside,
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:21.840]  don't say anything. And all of a sudden, you're stepping on national security issues.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:27.920]  They use that all the time within local police forces to control what's going on. But they do
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.840]  keep it very compartmentalized so that the only people, there's only a handful that know that
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.640]  there's a false flag operation going on. A lot of people give an assignments that are part of it,
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.160]  that don't understand until it goes off, then they're told a different story that this is
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:46.160]  actually a terrorist attack. What is the main motive? Get the agenda passed,
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:51.120]  divert everybody to this story while they get all the gun stuff, immigration stuff,
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:57.280]  homeland security stuff rafted through? Well, in general, it does increase the amount
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:03.280]  of tension about terrorism. This will, to some extent, probably change a few votes on the gun
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:11.680]  bill. They're really close to not getting anything. If it weren't for taking to me,
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:19.360]  you know, suppose a Republican, you know, pro-gun person and Joe Manchin supposedly pro-gun to bring
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.160]  out and do and carry water for the establishment, they wouldn't even got anything, but they're
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:28.480]  probably going to get some form of background checks. And there's a lot of false language and
[01:56:28.480 --> 01:56:33.920]  fine print in that Toomey Manchin bill is very, very dangerous that it's going to, you know, end
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:40.800]  up registering a lot more weapons and bringing a lot more people under the guise of background
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:47.920]  checks, not just internet and gun show sales. But I think ultimately they are moving slowly enough
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.480]  that they're increasing the pressure. We won't know until they actually try to blame somebody
[01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:58.800]  for this Boston bombing, but I suspect it's going to be to insert a whole nother level of homeland
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:02.960]  security into the nation. I think that's what they're aiming for. And it's going to be at major
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:07.760]  sporting events. It's going to be at marathons. You're going to see homeland security and lots of
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:12.160]  Oh, they're already announcing that, oh, we've had army and TSA, a Kentucky Derby, but now there'll
[01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:16.960]  be three times more and it'll be in your town everywhere. The idea that government, there were
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:22.400]  400 troops there. There were checkpoints there didn't protect people. I mean, this is the takeover
[01:57:22.400 --> 01:57:28.160]  of society. Here's the article from mfallwars.com. It links to a Washington Post and others. Homeland
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:32.400]  security chief threatens terror attacks and budget cuts go through. Remember that was back,
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:37.920]  Erin Dykes wrote that back in February 26th, a few months ago. And she said, if you cut funding,
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:41.600]  there will be more terror attacks. This is really pretty elementary what's happening.
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:47.920]  That's a very good point. Great piece on your website there. They predicted it and sure enough,
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.400]  it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. Okay, we're going to break here in one minute. Give people
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.760]  the best website because I know there's Joel Skowzen, but there's also World Affairs Brief.

[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:17.520]  It is, Alex. And I'll tell you the special reason why I think that China allowed this to go through
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:20.880]  what they're going to gain from these future missile tests that are going to come through.
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:26.880]  What is it? Well, basically, they're going to launch a salvo of missiles to test our ballistic
[01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:32.080]  missile systems to see how many we can track and how many we can respond to. That's something that
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:37.280]  Russia and China have been waiting to test for a long time. And this gives them an excuse.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.360]  Wow. We'll talk to you again very, very soon.

[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.840]  Hey, I know we've got army folks and police and Marines holding. I want to get your quick take
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:32.000]  on this after the break. And then we're going to have another guest joining us. Doug Hagman,
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.800]  who predicted all this on Monday, talked about how it was imminent. Obama was about to double
[02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:40.320]  down. I mean, this is a false flag, no doubt. Now they're talking about how the duffel bag,
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:43.920]  the bombs, were just sitting there for a while. And the police are like, never mind,
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:49.600]  Drew, move on. I mean, normally, a donut pastry box falls in the ground. They bring in
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:55.280]  dogs and robots and only we protect you from the non-existent bombs.
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:00.160]  All the cities in the US have been getting Homeland Security funds for giant anti-bomb
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:05.440]  robots. This is a military industrial complex PR rollout. How do we sell $50 billion worth
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:14.720]  of robots? I mean, Austin spent like $3 million. They spent like $3 million. Look it up, I forget,
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:19.760]  but I think it was more on some robots for the non-existent bombs. But the government said,
[02:01:19.760 --> 02:01:26.640]  there will be bombs in every city routinely, get ready. And I guess they'll get the cops out with
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:31.440]  the bomb truck and they'll go find a little kid and just go over to the, hold this for me,
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:37.440]  Sonny, on a big black bomb with a fuse on it. Bye-bye, Sonny pie.
[02:01:40.720 --> 02:01:45.680]  Oh, man, this is too incredible. Also, you guys can sit around all day and be on the imaginary
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:50.800]  bomb squad. And now you've got to blow us up here and there. I mean, there is just no end of this
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:55.280]  government. But of course, it's their whole business. It's a human sacrifice. Our ancestors
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:00.560]  used to sacrifice people believing it made the harvest be better. And now they just blow stuff
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:07.360]  up and I would imagine they're like, here, Sonny, sit on my duffle bag for me. Okay, mister, so they
[02:02:07.360 --> 02:02:11.920]  can kill the little kid and use them all over the nose. I mean, of course, they want to kill you
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:17.600]  with vaccines anyways, why not kill you now? So we'll get everybody's take on that. And again,
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:22.560]  I've been trying to get Dan Badani on, but his Skype's been up and down. So we'll get a,
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:27.600]  oh, he's back. Dan, we're going to break here in a minute, but I'll bring you back and then take
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:32.960]  calls and then go to Mr. Hagman ahead of Stuart Rhodes popping in Oath Keepers to get his take
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:39.360]  on this. But Joel Skalzen says false flag. I mean, how could it not be? This is so ridiculous now.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:43.360]  And we're just waiting for the other shoe to drop, the right wing Patsy, they're going to try to
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:48.720]  blame. They're already trying to mix the term right wing in with Al-Qaeda, the group that's
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.520]  completely Islamophobic. Dan, good job getting your question into the governors and others.
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:57.680]  No doubt you shut down their press conferences. What can you tell us about behind the scenes,
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:04.240]  Dan Badani? Since I asked a question and I asked it again, and they would not answer the question,
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:10.080]  and I got the look of death from every federal agency that was there, the government officials,
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.320]  everything. And I knew right away I had to grab my camera quick as soon as the press conference is
[02:03:14.320 --> 02:03:18.560]  over because the woman gets right on the stage all this to the end of the press conference and
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.640]  everybody gives me the look of death. So I grabbed my equipment and I jetted right out of there.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.840]  But I mean, it was crazy. I mean, it's like the first question out and all of a sudden they call
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:33.120]  the press conference. It's cuz you put them on a stand, you oppose them with real questions,
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:37.840]  and all of a sudden the mainstream media don't like it because- Well, that's why I hired you,
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:43.440]  is because you are fearless. And I know you get homesick with, go see your son and your
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:46.880]  family, everybody back in Rhode Island. But as an East Coast reporter, the reports you file every
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:51.600]  week are just phenomenal. And we're hiring more editors so soon we can get more of your reports
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.040]  out. You sent us the raw footage, but great job, Dan. Tell us about more behind the scenes.
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:02.160]  When I got there, I mean, right away, I mean, I seen armored vehicles driving by,
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:08.080]  I got pictures I sent to do, and I got a video I'm gonna be posting soon. I was found actually
[02:04:08.080 --> 02:04:13.360]  the military and the police that were going from in the alleyways, from looking at people's cars
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:18.320]  into the garages with automatic assault weapons and just looking for bombs and everything else.
[02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:24.640]  Oh, yeah, the bombs they planted. The military is now taking over the area. And the news is
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:28.720]  they are in control and they are running the investigation. We're just learning,
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:33.600]  oh, the military's here, totally illegal, but they'll keep us safe from those bombs, Dan.
[02:04:33.600 --> 02:04:37.440]  Tell us more of what you've witnessed there in Boston. We've been reporting since yesterday
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:43.360]  afternoon, Dan Badandi, Infowars.com reporter. And again, look at Infowars on the cutting edge
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:47.280]  of the reporting. We'll also give you an update on some of the latest breaking news

[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:06.480]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:11.440]  sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well-known fact that
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:15.840]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:22.000]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.760]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy. I then searched out the
[02:05:27.760 --> 02:05:33.760]  best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young Jevity products

[02:08:00.160 --> 02:08:08.240]  There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics
[02:08:09.360 --> 02:08:20.320]  in different parts of the world. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:26.560]  We are now eight minutes into the
[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:36.480]  third hour here today and we are tracking the tragic 100 plus dead, 100 injured, three dead
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:42.640]  there at the Boston Marathon. But my only point is not a clip of this coming up in a few minutes
[02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:48.160]  as Obama says, if it's a bomb and it kills civilians, it's terrorism, which I tend to
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:56.000]  agree. But when our military working for the globalist goes in and kills a million plus
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.760]  Iraqis with sanctions and bombs and weapons in the last 15 years, Madeline Albright doesn't
[02:09:01.760 --> 02:09:07.680]  deny it. She says it's a good price to pay. And I've seen cases where they've killed over 200
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:16.080]  people with a predator drone, a wedding, 1000 pound, 2000 pound bomb to get one bad guy who
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:20.880]  hasn't been convicted. And there's really no proof. And look, our government runs Al-Qaeda
[02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:24.800]  in Libya and Syria and gives them 10,000 heat seeking missiles, they run Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:33.360]  And then they'll kill a whole family. And I'll see the video on Pakistani TV, blood everywhere,
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:39.840]  arms, legs. You try to show that, they will kick you off YouTube. You cover that, you're a traitor.
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.000]  Because you're not supposed to personalize those people. Back in the day of Walter Cronkite,
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:49.440]  they'd show a naked eight year old Vietnamese girl running down a path, a rice paddy with her
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:55.440]  skin hanging off from napalm. But now they won't show it. They'll show all the fake violence,
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:00.240]  zombies, murder, death, the most horrific up close stuff. But that's simulated killing,
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.720]  which conditions you to not care. But if it's the real thing, you're not supposed to see it.
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.080]  You're not supposed to even see the flag draped coffins of our dead troops.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:11.760]  You're supposed to just say you're patriotic, but then once they actually get back,
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:15.760]  treat them like garbage. There are troops all over Boston and other major cities,
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:23.360]  not just here but worldwide, all part of the security theater. And again, 400 troops,
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:33.040]  checkpoints, a drill, and it didn't protect anybody. It didn't protect anybody.
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:38.720]  So now they're saying we're gonna have TSA and troops everywhere in America.
[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:43.680]  Will that protect you? And again, they sold billions of dollars of robots to local,
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:49.360]  Austin bought a couple multimillion dollar robots for the coming bombing. We will be bombed,
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:53.920]  they said. I guess if they hyped it enough, mentally ill people might actually try to do it.
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:11:00.400]  And then they pull you over and say this Tannerite you had for your shooting show is a bomb.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:04.000]  I bought it at the local store. Well, you're going to jail anyways.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.360]  Or you've got black powder for black powder hunting. We're gonna take you to jail. Or
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:12.960]  look, you have jumper cables, pipe bombs. I mean, this is the new hysteria of bombs, bombs,
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:17.680]  when you got three people dead. What's the latest? Over 100 injured and how many have died?
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:22.000]  It's three, right? I'm going from memory. Real quick, Dan Badandi, our reporter that took over
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:26.480]  both press conferences and they canceled the press conferences because he was asking real
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:30.480]  questions about, hey, what about the drill? And they're like, there was no drill, Sonny.
[02:11:30.480 --> 02:11:34.000]  Even though the drills are admitted, that's a big deal. Then we're going to your phone calls
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.880]  and then to Doug Hagman. Go ahead and make your points there, Dan, on what else you saw
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:42.560]  while you're there in Boston. Well, I talked to a lot of the athletes
[02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:47.520]  who participated in the event and they had the same scenario if they heard or seen the bomb.
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:52.080]  They said the first thing, the first one they thought was just a fire wreck or something.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:55.600]  Then when a second one went off, that's when they knew there was something wrong.
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:00.960]  And I mean, you had the massive police state that was already there. That's gonna make you question
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.040]  one thing. I know it's a big event. People say they asked behind security, no doubt. But
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:12.080]  for them to be having drills, then local 15 reported that there was announcements
[02:12:12.080 --> 02:12:16.320]  being made moments before the bombs went off to tell people to remain calm.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:19.520]  But you didn't hear that. You didn't hear that. You didn't see that. You didn't build that.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:24.720]  And you didn't hear that stuff because the government knows what's best for you. And
[02:12:25.680 --> 02:12:30.000]  this is showing true signs of a false flag. I mean, I'm calling false flag all over.
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.640]  Yeah, cuz people notice them placing the big duffel bag bombs to be homemade to whoever drugged
[02:12:34.640 --> 02:12:39.440]  up Patsy. They've got to blame it on them. And it's like, nevermind this. Ma'am, can your son
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:46.160]  shit on the duffel bag? This is only a drill. Hug the bag. Marines are trained to jump on the
[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:51.760]  hand grenade. And absolutely, this thing, they ran the anthrax attack. That later came out.
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:59.280]  They ran 7-7. That was drills. It's the same thing, Dan. Other points that you'd like to add?
[02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.680]  Well, the points, too, I wanna make real quick. It's in kind of relation to this.
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:10.480]  The first US nuclear power plant to be formally tested for a terrorist attack plan. This is
[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:16.480]  reported by the Patriot News Central Pennsylvania News, as they are saying today.
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:22.560]  Yeah, NBC News, Three Mile Island to conduct hostile action drill. Yes, everyone's, but who
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:27.040]  stands to gain? Who wants the funding for the police state takeover? Who stands to gain? Who
[02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:30.720]  has the motive? Who's been caught doing this before? Well, absolutely, the FBI. I mean,
[02:13:30.720 --> 02:13:35.280]  how many times do they have their hand in the pot and actually giving bombs to the so-called
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:40.080]  terrorists, coaching them, being in relations with them for a couple years just to get them,
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:44.960]  give them the firearms or whatever they needed. Then that last minute they come in as the saviors,
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:48.800]  even though they gave them the gun. Absolutely, absolutely. In fact, I have the New York Times
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:54.880]  article from April 28th last year, terrorist plots hatched by the FBI document cam on this.
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:58.880]  Thank you, guys. And it goes through the fact that they create completely fake terror groups
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:03.200]  and try to let them then carry out the bombings like the first World Trade Center bombing was
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:10.400]  a FBI operation. New York Times, but the media says Alex claims the FBI has hatched plots.
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:16.560]  Now, it's been admitted in court. Here it is, your precious New York Times. Go ahead, sir.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:20.800]  And right away, right away, they made the announcement that the FBI is taking over
[02:14:20.800 --> 02:14:25.680]  the investigation. And I knew that was gonna happen in the first place. And it was just like,
[02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:30.800]  they were already there. I mean, it was just like all the points we already said, just like 9-11,
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:35.280]  just like Oklahoma City, just like Waco. It's just like one after another. I mean,
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:40.560]  we how many times, Alex, have you told people, show government documents, Army field manuals
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:44.640]  about staging false flag terror. But yet, people still denying it and say,
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:48.640]  oh, there's no such thing as false flag terror when it's right in their faces by their own
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:52.720]  government. By the way, I saw the footage of you asking the governor, could this be a false flag,
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.720]  notice he knew what that was, to take our liberties. And he looked like a bad guy,
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.360]  a Dr. Evil, a black Dr. Evil, totally freaking out and staring at you.
[02:15:01.360 --> 02:15:05.680]  And then they shut the conference down, because the question freaked him out so bad. You had the
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:10.080]  first question, and they had hundreds of press there ready to fawn on these people, and they
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:15.840]  shut it down and look completely panicked. They looked completely guilty, guilty as sin that
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:20.160]  they've been told to shut up. Well, absolutely, and Ingrid shows guilt right there. When you're
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:24.720]  ignorant, you're showing guilt. I mean, now you got the look of death. And all the way till they
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:29.840]  left the room, I'm pounding them. What about the drills? What about the, is this a false flag
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:34.880]  terror? And I called it how I've seen it. And just the look on the FBI's face, I mean,
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:42.720]  I wish I could put the camera in that guy's face. I mean, the FBI agent at the time there
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:46.320]  just gave me this look like if it looks like a kill, I would have been annihilated.
[02:15:46.880 --> 02:15:51.680]  And it was crazy. Well, you're right. And again, well, we're rolling some video here of the
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:56.000]  governor at the press conference after you asked your question. And there's more footage of it.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.920]  In fact, I was seeing a widescreen of it earlier. He looks so upset and so shifty eye in the close
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:07.680]  up shots of this. Dan, I tell you, you're doing a great job and God bless you. We'll keep reporting,
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:12.480]  upload them to your Info Wars YouTube channel, and we'll air them here on the main radio show.
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:18.000]  God bless you. Great job. Be safe. Thank you. I want to get to some calls ahead of Doug Hagman
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.360]  and his intel on this. And then Stuart Rhodes just got off an airplane, is getting to a position
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:28.800]  to be able to call in for for Oath Keepers. He's on his way to Boston right now. But yeah,
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:32.480]  there's the close up footage of the governor acting completely shifty eyed whenever Badandi
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:37.760]  asked this question. We're going to go ahead now and go to some of the calls that have been
[02:16:37.760 --> 02:16:43.520]  holding so long. I appreciate people holding Craig and Mash, former police. What is your take
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.880]  on this whole thing, sir? Hi, Alex. How are you? Great job. I think you're right with the false
[02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:56.000]  flag theory. Yesterday, they unveiled the Homeland Security vehicles with millions, all black.
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:02.640]  And what were the Sandy Hook parents sitting in the grandstands across about 50 yards up
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:09.920]  from the explosion? Why did they have to bring them into it? I think there's a right.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.880]  Oh yeah, I mean, they went too far. They got greedy on this, how they choreographed it. I
[02:17:14.880 --> 02:17:18.800]  mean, did they have Steven Spielberg running this? We know they had Jerry Bruckheimer running the
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:22.880]  fake private lunch rescue that actually came out. I mean, yeah, this is just over. I mean,
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:26.560]  anybody who's got a brain can see the script and go ahead.
[02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:33.200]  On immediately and says it's if it's a group and he sort of had a look in his eyes like,
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:37.200]  you know, there's something he's going to make something else of it. Another thing, Alex,
[02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:42.640]  in Massachusetts, all the police vehicles are black and they're becoming standardized.
[02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:46.800]  When you see them now, you don't even know what town you're in. There's a badge,
[02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:52.240]  a greatest badge on the door of each of these vehicles and they're worth tons, millions.
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:57.120]  No, that's Homeland Security. They tell you what it has to look like. And it's a secret police
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:02.160]  and they're making local police federalized. I mean, we're in a lot of trouble. And the
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:08.640]  training manuals, the stuff that they the stuff that they give the police now is like a joke.
[02:18:08.640 --> 02:18:14.000]  I mean, it's so over the top that obviously the feds are the bad guys. But hey, they're saying
[02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:18.640]  Christian gun owners are the new enemy. Worse than Al-Qaeda. What's worse than Al-Qaeda? Christians.
[02:18:19.440 --> 02:18:24.560]  You're right. But one quick thing. As far as the police takeover, I was a law enforcement for
[02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:30.880]  years. I'm retired, but they're our brothers, sisters, sons, aunts, daughters. When the day
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:35.840]  comes, when they're supposed to turn on us, most of them are going to lay down their weapons and
[02:18:35.840 --> 02:18:41.360]  they're not going to do it. And I'm just praying that that day comes when it comes. I hope it
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:45.040]  doesn't, that they lay down their weapons and support their brothers and sisters, Americans
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:50.000]  like you, me and millions of other people listening. And I want to tell you, I stick
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:56.480]  info.com stickers on polls in my town. I make them up with magic. And I'm spreading the word
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:19:01.440]  out here in Massachusetts. It's a communist state and I'm ready to move out to the, can I tell you
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:05.760]  a quick story real quick? I was out in the Southwest. I don't want to say the state visit
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:13.200]  of my son out near you. I was coming back with my wife. I was at Sky Harbor Airport. It was 10 30
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:18.960]  at night. I saw a guy with a yellow FAA vest taking pictures of a license plate illegally
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:23.680]  parked. So I had my camera, which I like taking pictures. I took a picture near him. He'd come
[02:19:23.680 --> 02:19:28.160]  over to me and said, why did you take that picture? And I said, you know why I took the picture?
[02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:32.800]  Because I wanted to, and this is still America. And he, and then he says, well, why were you taking
[02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:37.200]  the picture up here? I says, cause I like architecture. I took a picture of the over
[02:19:37.200 --> 02:19:41.760]  bridge, like the walkway. And I thought that my wife said, what the heck was that?
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:46.560]  Oh no, no. Everything is about how we're guilty, but they never are. When most of the perpetrators
[02:19:46.560 --> 02:19:50.720]  are the false flag insiders. And that's just a historical fact. They're like, how dare you
[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:54.960]  look at me? Well, you have the motive. You have the history. You've done it over and over again.
[02:19:54.960 --> 02:19:58.880]  Absolutely. It's incredible. God bless you, sir. More calls coming up and we've
[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:03.760]  got special guests joining us. Don't throw away leftovers. Instead,
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:07.760]  throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts,

[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:08.720]  has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S.,
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:13.520]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country
[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.320]  in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be
[02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:24.240]  affected. The fact is you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might

[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:05.600]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire
[02:22:05.600 --> 02:22:11.040]  and live out their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy,
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:16.080]  housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:20.240]  for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:25.200]  perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered
[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:30.240]  by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states,
[02:22:30.240 --> 02:22:35.040]  it's what every American needs to know about central bank power, a gripping adventure into
[02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:40.080]  the secret world of international banking cartel. Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:46.960]  dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book. Call 1-800-686-2237

[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:03.840]  Do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid gland? Did you know that mercury from
[02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:08.400]  your dental fillings comes off your teeth both as a vapor and as metal particles into your body?
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:13.120]  Wherever mercury deposits in your body, it stops cells from functioning normally. Animal studies
[02:23:13.120 --> 02:23:18.480]  show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60%. Mercury deposited into your adrenals or
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:22.080]  thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in function. The number one method by which your
[02:23:22.080 --> 02:23:27.440]  body detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione. The number one superfood that helps turn on all
[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:32.480]  75 trillion cells of your body to produce glutathione is non-denatured whey protein
[02:23:32.480 --> 02:23:38.400]  from grass-fed cows. After investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market, only one
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:42.720]  is the most non-denatured, the most active, the most complete, and in our opinion, the most
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:49.040]  powerful in what nature originally put into the fresh raw whey. It is One World Whey. Call

[02:24:08.880 --> 02:24:16.960]  Alex Jones here back live and when the official radio show ends here in about 35 minutes,
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:24.960]  I'm going into overdrive that some stations carry with Oath Keepers founder, Stuart Rhodes,
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:30.480]  constitutional lawyer, veteran. He's on his way to Boston for the 19th event and they're trying
[02:24:30.480 --> 02:24:35.120]  to blame it on domestic groups as you know right now. Regardless, they're missing the term al-Qaeda
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:41.280]  with conservative now or libertarian because we oppose the unconstitutional things that are
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:45.840]  happening. We're gonna go to Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network who did a great
[02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:51.040]  job on Coast to Coast AM last night breaking all this down. I'll be on for the full show tonight.
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:56.400]  I know I don't work hard enough. We did 11 hours yesterday and I got about five hours sleep and
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:02.720]  I'm doing this and then I'm doing Coast to Coast but wild horses couldn't drag me away. If I'm
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:09.200]  gonna risk my life for liberty, I'm gonna go 110%. That doesn't mean sometimes I'm not gonna be
[02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:15.920]  making mistakes or stumbling around in the great exertion, but I'm on the field here.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.800]  Now, you just heard Joel Skalzen who I really respect saying clear false flag.
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:27.360]  They are breathlessly on the news trying to tie it into Sandy Hook and domestic stuff.
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.800]  Terror in Boston, Hagel, the SEC death, says Pentagon ready to violate posse commentatis,
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:38.560]  they already are. So that roll out's happening. They're saying it's a positive to get the gun
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:44.000]  bills passed cuz this diverts the political heat off of them. And Homeland Security being given
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.480]  autonomous total takeover power, that's happening right now. This is perfect timing.
[02:25:48.480 --> 02:25:52.960]  Big Sis said give me money or there'll be a terror attack and give us more power. I mean,
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:58.480]  this is 101. Every time they're about to pass, more power, this happens. Obama insider admits
[02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:06.400]  to link, attempts to link Boston bombing to tax day. Boston massacre, Obama looks to tax day for
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:12.080]  right wing terror explanation. Family Guy episode predicts Boston Marathon attack.
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:18.240]  Boston Marathon bombing, who do they plan to blame? Eyewitness authorities must have known about
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:24.000]  bombing. Official story unraveling from Boston Marathon bombing. That's all at prisonplanet.com,

[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:39.120]  I'm gonna tweet right now. Guys, I was charging my phone. Will somebody bring it in, please?
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:43.600]  I'm gonna tweet right now that video link for your friends and family so you can send it out
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:50.000]  to folks so they can tune in. Cuz we're gonna be live now right till about eight or nine tonight.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:54.480]  We're gonna run a rebroadcast for an hour or so so we can take a break here. But we're gonna be
[02:26:54.480 --> 02:27:01.360]  live continually here, so infowars.com forward slash. Listen, and when Sha'Carri Jackson and
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:05.120]  them are in here, they'll cover news for 30 minutes. They'll take an hour or two of your calls.
[02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:08.960]  So heavy calls coming up. We're going to break here in a moment for the rest of the hour.
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:13.200]  Doug Hagman will be with us. Sorry, I've gone to my guest a little late today.
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:16.640]  You start going a little late to each guest and it builds up by the end.
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:23.840]  But Doug, the most devastating evidence is that Rob Dew, my news director, constantly
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:29.440]  argues with his defense intelligence brother-in-law, who is actually pretty high up in it.
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:36.000]  And he's on the Army Marathon team, and he can run 24 miles in his sleep. He was running,
[02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:40.640]  he was pretty much fine, and they came over and said, you're dehydrated, we're pulling you out.
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:44.880]  Cuz he was up towards the front, coming up to the finish line right before all this happened.
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:50.800]  They're running drills, all of this. Hagman, what is your latest intel from the Northeast
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:54.400]  Intelligence Network? You're up there, you have the best sources on the East Coast.
[02:27:54.400 --> 02:27:59.920]  You said Monday, Obama's about to double down imminent terror attack, and you were right.
[02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:00.560]  So here you are.
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:06.240]  Well, thanks, Alex. And I gotta tell you this. According to my sources,
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:11.440]  there's just so much to this that we're not hearing, that we may never hear about.
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:15.280]  But I think you've done a great job in breaking things down here. You've got
[02:28:15.280 --> 02:28:22.000]  various situations that mirror historical terrorist attacks here in this country.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:29.760]  And one thing that I was really concerned about is, with all of the accusations of saying, well,
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:36.000]  you can't really say this is a false flag attack, or you can't really conclude anything.
[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:43.280]  While that might be a true statement today, are we wrong? Are we wrong? Are we wrong?
[02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:50.880]  Are we wrong to be a little bit jaded or a little bit gun-shy about what we're seeing here with
[02:28:50.880 --> 02:28:58.480]  respect to this incident? The fact that this appears to fit a certain template that we've
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:07.200]  seen in the past with the training drills, even the prior warnings with the dogs,
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:13.360]  the explosive sniffing dogs, the extreme police presence, the drills, so on and so forth.
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:20.000]  I don't think we're wrong to question the facts at all or to question the motives at all,
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:26.080]  especially over the last 24 hours when you have, as you've pointed out,
[02:29:26.080 --> 02:29:28.640]  the axle rods and the others coming out and saying, hey, wait a minute,
[02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:33.280]  this could very well be a patriot-related attack.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:35.440]  They were saying it within one hour.
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:41.280]  Exactly, exactly. So everything's the agenda on that side.
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:44.880]  There's no real Tea Party person that would blow up people at that.
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:47.600]  They'd attack the UN or something. We'll be right back.
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:49.680]  Why does nobody ever do that, by the way? We'll be right back.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:57.360]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:08.560]  the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S.,
[02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:13.040]  costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the
[02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:17.680]  country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't
[02:32:17.680 --> 02:32:22.800]  think you will be affected. The fact is, you are. We all are. Food shortages drive prices

[02:33:24.800 --> 02:33:28.560]  We're going back to our guest Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network here in just
[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:34.320]  a moment, Chuck in Boston. And you're noticing the FBI saying, give us all your footage just
[02:33:34.320 --> 02:33:40.560]  like Oklahoma City, don't give it to the media. But he's saying he saw cops with backpacks,
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:44.320]  and that's exactly what the bombs were in. And again, they were running a drill,
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:48.800]  people saw stuff that was making them suspicious and they'd say, it's just a drill, nevermind.
[02:33:48.800 --> 02:33:52.720]  I would imagine, by the way, Sonny, can you sit on this bag for me? I'm an officer,
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:57.120]  here's a lollipop. I mean, I'm telling you, that's how sick this is, and they could be firing
[02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:01.600]  who knows what. And it could be Islamic, could be fake, could be real. I mean,
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:04.640]  they're trying to blame it on the Tea Party. We're going back to Hagman in a minute
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:09.600]  with his connections out there on the East Coast. But Chuck, what did you see?
[02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:14.080]  Hi, Alex. Yes, sir, tell us what you saw.
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:18.240]  Yeah, I appreciate what you're doing. I can't talk too long. I got out of Boston as quickly
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:24.880]  as I could. I was in at the 13 mile marker for the race. I was walking from a restaurant over
[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:31.680]  to me and my friend. And what I saw was they caught my eye, it was a cop. And I disguised,
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:35.760]  I sent the video to the UN. Forget the press, forget the FBI, I sent it to the UN.
[02:34:37.120 --> 02:34:41.680]  Whoever they are, the world military, whatever the hell they are. And I put it on YouTube,
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:49.440]  I disguised it. And the name is 9-11 Liars Club. I disguised it as a 9-11 video,
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:51.920]  because it's all connected as conspiracies. But-
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:55.920]  Okay, okay, tell me the name of the video on YouTube and we'll pull it up. Say it again
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:04.080]  clearly. 9-11 Liars Club, I disguised it as that. But what I saw was a state trooper in his car,
[02:35:04.080 --> 02:35:09.200]  unmarked. He had his gun exposed, so he's obviously a cop. And pulling it back, a knapsack,
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:14.080]  a backpack, and put it into the baby carriage. And I said, what, this ain't right. I zoomed in
[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:22.000]  on Alexa's plate and everything. And I caught him on video putting the second one in the baby carriage.
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.240]  And I gotta go, I don't trust this.
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:29.360]  All right, that caller sounded a little bit sarcastic, and maybe I'm wrong reading the
[02:35:29.360 --> 02:35:33.920]  voice. But you open the phones up, you're gonna get some of that stuff. A lot of people that are
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:37.920]  working for The Globalist also think it's funny to make all this a joke. It's gonna be funny when
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:42.240]  they take your private pension fund and go ahead and drink that fluoride and give your kid all the
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:46.960]  shots. You don't do that. It's just for the rest of us, it's all a big joke. And maybe that guy
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:50.960]  wasn't bad, but that sounded like somebody reading a script. That's what Skousen said he thought was
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:56.640]  going on earlier too. And if the guy's wrong, I'm wrong, but that sounded like it was just designed
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:36:01.680]  to be paranoid. You hear these ads that I don't condone going, you better go to this site or
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:06.960]  you're basically dead. I'm saying we need to get informed and involved or the evil will take over,
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:11.920]  and then we're enslaved. I'm not like we're screwed, get ready. It's like we can turn
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:18.080]  this around. But a lot of callers coming in, we've got Trish in New York, Families Military,
[02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:25.200]  John in Washington Army, Bill in Indiana, bombings related, Dean, Army, Billy, we'll get to all of
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:29.680]  you. But let me just shut up so Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Network can get his points
[02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:35.040]  out. What are you hearing? What are you seeing out of this? The police saying there wasn't a drill,
[02:36:35.040 --> 02:36:38.320]  but the drill's on record. What's your take on this? What are you hearing?
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:45.440]  A couple of things. The training drill did happen as it was initially reported. And by the way,
[02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:51.440]  I talked to my source from the DHS this morning, and his reply to that training drill was,
[02:36:53.040 --> 02:37:00.320]  how safe does that make you feel even if things went off exactly as the government stated,
[02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:07.440]  where you had a real live training drill or a real live security force there with dogs
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:13.600]  checking for explosives, finding none? How safe do you feel now? How well did that work out for
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:20.320]  you? That was number one. But more disconcerting than that, Alex, as of this morning when I talked
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:31.360]  to my source, he did say that this was an opening salvo of additional attacks of this nature that
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:40.560]  he classified in his terminology as diversionary attacks, meaning false flag attacks, at least
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:46.960]  that's what I got out of that statement. So what I think what we're seeing here based on the most
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:55.840]  current information I've got is this is not the end of anything. This is the beginning of a more
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:02.160]  deadly, perhaps, a series of attacks. We're seeing the beginning of a, well, it could even be a wag
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:12.080]  with dogs scenario, but a beginning of a campaign to demonize, further demonize the conservative
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:18.240]  base, to further demonize the people that are patriots. And the fact that this happened on
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.840]  patriot's day should be lost on no one. The fact that there are other issues related to
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:30.160]  Boston and freedom should be lost on no one. Clearly, and again, based on my source,
[02:38:30.160 --> 02:38:37.280]  I think the most important, if I can say nothing else today for today's broadcast is expect more
[02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  and look at these as diversions. And that's pretty frightening as far as I'm concerned.
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:50.400]  Well said, and I did confirm that last caller was a disinformation operative
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:56.400]  who's doing a pathetic job, by the way, what he's promoting as 421 views after a few years.
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:02.000]  But it shows how desperate they are that we're being swarmed by trolls online at an unprecedented
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:07.200]  level and on the videos and on air right now. They're very upset about the message we're
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:12.000]  putting out. And I know you don't like to jump the gun, Doug, but I mean, come on.
[02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:19.760]  I mean, come on. Every TV show demonizes patriots. Every channel, even Fox is saying it's probably
[02:39:19.760 --> 02:39:24.560]  right wingers. Whether it turns out to be that or not, they're now mixing Al Qaeda and right wingers
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:32.560]  like it's one thing. And it's just pure demonization when the globalists run Al Qaeda now.
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:37.360]  I mean, that's not debated. So what does your gut tell you this is? And if your source,
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:42.240]  who I've talked to, one of your sources, if your source says he has this information,
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:45.200]  because I have my sources as well. I mean, if we don't know who's behind it,
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:47.920]  then how do we know there's more? This is an opening salvo.
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:56.960]  No, I totally agree with you on this. And even if someone, for example, even if a member of Al
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:04.320]  Qaeda, as you rightfully point out that it's a creation of our intelligence agencies. Even if
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:10.720]  that turns out to be true, well, number one, how do we know there's going to be more? I agree with
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:18.880]  that. Number two, the fact that it could be Al Qaeda for the very reasons that they would state
[02:40:18.880 --> 02:40:29.200]  their religious reasons. However, it's going to be exploited to demonize the patriots,
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:34.400]  the patriots, the constitutional loving people and Christians. So it really-
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:39.120]  Exactly, it might be real. It might be real terrorists that came over from Mexico.
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:42.000]  They would cover it up and find some patriot to blame.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.240]  Oh, exactly. It's almost as if the facts don't matter. It's almost as if everyone is saying,
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:41:01.200]  well, yeah, it's the patriots. It's because of this extreme ideology by the conservative base
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:07.360]  in America that's causing the division in America, when in fact it is the progressive, communist,
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:13.200]  globalist, one world order people that are causing this, that are creating an exacerbating
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:19.680]  situations like this. Everything we've seen since, well, even before the last piece of glass
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:26.400]  hit the pavement in Boston, everything we've seen is an attempt to demonize the very message
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:34.640]  of ours, the patriotic, constitutional loving Christian conservative base in this country. So
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:42.080]  expect more of this. And if this doesn't work, they'll do something else. But we have to
[02:41:42.080 --> 02:41:46.560]  remember too, we're also involved in a three dimensional chess game here. We cannot look at
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:53.680]  this just merely in the context of one event. This happened in the context of other fights,
[02:41:53.680 --> 02:42:00.400]  constitutional rights being eroded, the gun grab confiscation taking place, our economic
[02:42:01.360 --> 02:42:05.840]  just devastation that we have here. That's right. It's a smokescreen from everything
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:10.640]  else they're doing. And meanwhile, Axelrod says it's probably the Tea Party doing it weekly
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:19.360]  standard Young Turks, O'Reilly, slimeball Matthews, all of them. This just goes on and on.
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:26.560]  Here's my point. This is why I said this was eminent. Again, every show says that patriots
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:30.880]  are gonna murder you and your family and bomb public events with no evidence or history.
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:37.600]  Clearly, they're gearing up to do it themselves and blame it on us. That's 101. That's 101.
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:41.600]  And if they do try to say it's Al-Qaeda, everybody's gonna point out, well, why is NATO
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:48.000]  arming Al-Qaeda then? So I don't see them going with that narrative. But I mean, maybe the public's
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:52.240]  so stupid. Maybe they let Al-Qaeda in with a bunch of heat seeking missiles. They shoot down
[02:42:52.240 --> 02:42:56.960]  airplanes and then they go, well, they got them in Libya and everybody's too dumb to get to know that
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:01.680]  our government gave them to them. I mean, it's so simple. I mean, I guess the government just
[02:43:01.680 --> 02:43:05.040]  stage a bunch of bombings, take over. I mean, it's real simple.
[02:43:05.040 --> 02:43:11.120]  Well, I think, Alex, we're in the fight of our lives here. This is the end game. This is for all
[02:43:11.120 --> 02:43:18.080]  the marbles. Our liberties are at stake. Our very way of life is at stake. We're seeing that bankers
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:20.480]  rape, pillage, and plunder our bank accounts. That's how-
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:25.360]  That's why you're seeing hyperventilating by all of the establishment authoritarians that say
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:28.800]  they're leftist, going after the guns and everything and saying your kids belong to the
[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:33.360]  state. It's like they know something huge is coming and they're licking their chops with
[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:37.680]  arrogance. I mean, they are on real power trips and I hope they know we got hundreds of millions
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:42.560]  of guns. We got the jump on you. We know you're terrorists. We know who you are. We know you're
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:47.440]  scum. We know you hate us. I mean, I hope they understand that we know who they are.
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:54.800]  And I think they do, which is why I think we're seeing the reactions that we're seeing.
[02:43:54.800 --> 02:44:01.120]  I think that there's, in their mind, they are not leaving anything to chance. There's no
[02:44:01.120 --> 02:44:08.880]  single point failure for them. And so we may see, in this multi-dimensional chess game,
[02:44:08.880 --> 02:44:12.960]  we may see a terrorist attack like we saw yesterday, or an attack or a bombing like
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:18.560]  we saw yesterday, and then something else take place over in another part of the world.
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:23.360]  I mean, look, it's just like what we're seeing in North Korea. What's that all about? Well,
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:28.720]  that's to divert our assets, military assets over there. Well, things are going to happen in the
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:35.680]  Middle East. Everything is connected here. I was about to say oil, gold, Russia, Europe,
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:43.040]  China, Japan getting in fights now, North Korea, Iran, putting Al-Qaeda in charge of all these
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:49.440]  countries with Homeland Security and NATO. Everything is going like somebody hit the
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:54.880]  dominoes. Basically, somebody tripped the dominoes and the game is in play now.
[02:44:54.880 --> 02:44:59.680]  What is it building towards? Well, ultimately, I mean, we are a captured
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:05.520]  operation. When we can't even have an intelligent conversation about current events, whether it's
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:12.800]  about the pedigree of our current occupant of the White House or about what happened in Benghazi,
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:17.840]  for example, we still haven't gotten any answers to Benghazi. How can we expect,
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:23.040]  how can the average American expect to get the truth on something like what happened yesterday?
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:27.840]  We can't. What's this all building to? This is all building to the ultimate
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:32.880]  things that you talk about, this global domination. It's going to be a situation where
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:37.600]  they're going to collapse our economy. I mean, this is how it's been told to me. Our economy
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:44.560]  is going to be collapsed. It's a deliberate economic collapse of the dollar. We are going
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:51.120]  to be essentially slaves subjugated to a one world global governance. And I know this is hard
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:45:56.720]  to really fathom for some people. It was for me for a long time. But when you see the evidence
[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:02.880]  here, so the bottom line is this, everything that we're seeing is one step closer to the further
[02:46:02.880 --> 02:46:09.040]  erosion of our liberties, to the further enslavement of not only us, but our children
[02:46:09.040 --> 02:46:15.040]  and our grandchildren. And this is for all of the marbles. This is for the entire power structure
[02:46:15.040 --> 02:46:21.920]  of the globe. Something happens here in the United States that further erodes our freedom. Something
[02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:27.920]  happens in North Korea. Something happens in Syria. All of this is to a means to an end. And
[02:46:27.920 --> 02:46:33.600]  the end is our total and complete subjugation and enslavement to a one world global system of
[02:46:33.600 --> 02:46:38.160]  governance, which is why they've got to get rid of it. We can't have a police state and an armed
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:44.720]  citizenry. It just doesn't work out well. So what we're seeing here are methods, are events
[02:46:44.720 --> 02:46:52.400]  that will result in a further gun confiscation, further erosion of liberties. And if, for example,
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:59.120]  Sandy Hook didn't do it, something else will. No single point failure on the part of those
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:04.000]  coming after us. Yeah, and let's not forget, they staged fast and furious. They do stage false
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:09.120]  flags. Even CBS reported they got the memos. They were planning to blame the Second Amendment and
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:13.840]  say, hey, your guns are causing Mexico's problems when it wasn't our guns. And even when they got
[02:47:13.840 --> 02:47:19.360]  caught, they still went forward with it. And I mean, you look at Aurora. I mean, that is open
[02:47:19.360 --> 02:47:27.360]  and shut, classic MK Ultra, staged, drugged, DARPA program, Pentagon psychiatrist over him.
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:32.560]  He's in a brain man interface, machine interface program, just like Theodore Kaczynski
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:39.440]  was in MK Ultra. That's declassified. But no one ever goes, gee, why was the guy from MK Ultra the
[02:47:39.440 --> 02:47:44.800]  reported Unabomber? Cuz the truth is they just set up these drugged out mind control guys to be
[02:47:44.800 --> 02:47:50.960]  their cutouts to tell their radical anti-human story. I mean, it's just incredible how the
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:48:00.080]  globalist- Hey, look, the CIA for 30 years, I believe it was 87 different universities,
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:09.840]  millions upon millions of dollars, how many subjects were affected by this trauma-based mind
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:17.440]  control? We've seen this. It's documented. You've pointed this out. So we do have these Aurora
[02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:22.560]  shooters and other people. People think that this is conspiracy nonsense. I used to laugh at it and
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:26.880]  think, oh my gosh, no, it can't be. But the documentation is out there for anyone to look at.
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:30.800]  But I think the important point right now is this. We have to realize that we're in the fight
[02:48:30.800 --> 02:48:35.760]  of our lives, that there are people who want to take control of us. This is part of their
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:40.560]  operation. You've got David Axelrod, and that was a great article too, by Steve Watson. David
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:47.120]  Axelrod coming out and saying, well, it could very well be a dispute over tax day, referring to the
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:55.440]  bombing of yesterday. So at the end of the day, at the end of when it does come down to the motive,
[02:48:55.440 --> 02:49:00.400]  it's going to be so watered down that people, all they're going to remember is Patriots Day,
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:06.240]  tax day, bombing, that type of thing. And it's a trauma-based, this is where the trauma-based mind
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:10.960]  control comes in and the use of the press to really- No, no, that's it. They're the ones
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:16.960]  engaged in the trauma-based mind control, milking Sandy Hook, milking Aurora, milking this to divert
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:21.440]  us from the 85 billion a month that's transferred to offshore banks. And if you look at all the
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:27.680]  thousands of declassified tests, some of which had thousands of programs within them, or incidences
[02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:33.600]  where they would kill foster kids, veterans, troops, towns, white people, black people,
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:38.640]  they don't care. Of course they would stage something like this, criminal globalist elements,
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:44.480]  because they like doing this as well. And now images of troops with machine guns everywhere
[02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:51.680]  bugging their eyes out at people, as if 400 troops checkpoints didn't stop this. In fact,
[02:49:51.680 --> 02:49:55.920]  it's probably the people running the checkpoints that brought this to you. I mean, it's so
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:49:59.440]  elementary and I think more and more people are, do you think it shook them up that we
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:06.720]  had a reporter take over both press conferences? You know what, I don't know anymore.
[02:50:06.720 --> 02:50:15.120]  I defer to you on that. I really don't know, but all I know is this. I think that we're,
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:23.280]  we are the intended recipients of the shock and awe campaign, this military psyops campaign,
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:31.040]  this campaign of extreme disinformation, and disinformation is the key here. You've got people
[02:50:31.040 --> 02:50:37.280]  that are in the media that are working for the globalists. You've got the people that are
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:40.800]  performing these press conferences that are obviously working for the globalists.
[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:44.320]  Absolutely. We are so infiltrated. That's why they shut down both press conferences.
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:48.800]  Homelandsecurityus.com is the website, homelandsecurityus.com.

[02:54:19.920 --> 02:54:30.400]  I am a Midwest farmer. I make a living off the land. I ride a John Deere tractor. I'm a liberated
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:39.840]  man. The rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July. And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:47.120]  Bankman says he likes me. Bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do. He tells me
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:53.520]  that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too. He ain't my friend. He ain't my friend. And I'll
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:59.520]  ride again. And I'll ride again. All right, that's enough of that great high-wowing music.
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:06.320]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. is the official transmission,
[02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:10.800]  but when this hour ends, we will go to video and audio streams that are already up and running
[02:55:10.800 --> 02:55:17.440]  free for everybody at infowars.com forward slash listen. And then the nightly news at
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:20.800]  seven o'clock will be regrouped and ready. Then I'll do coast to coast a.m. tonight
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:27.520]  for three hours on the globalist master takeover plan. But undoubtedly, I'm going to be able to
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:32.640]  spend some time on this. We'll have more tonight. So that's, I don't know, 560 something radio
[02:55:32.640 --> 02:55:37.440]  stations across the country. So that'll certainly be a powerful one, two punch coast to coast a.m.
[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:41.120]  dot com. I want to take some phone calls right now. I've got some other special reports I'm
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:48.720]  going to play and a recap of all this before I throw it at 20 after to Jocari Jackson and David
[02:55:48.720 --> 02:55:52.960]  Knight. And then it'll be Rob Doods, Jocari Jackson and David Knight, but Rob Dood leading
[02:55:52.960 --> 02:55:58.560]  it on the nightly news seven o'clock central. And that's all available free at infowars.com

[02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:12.160]  any of the feeds tonight that you feel like carrying that will be available at the free
[02:56:12.160 --> 02:56:16.560]  streams in even high quality. We also have low res as well for people that don't have good internet
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:22.400]  connections and info wars dot com forward slash listen. And again, if you follow us on Twitter,
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:26.320]  you can find all that information right there. But I'm going to punch out for a few hours is
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:30.800]  to save my voice so I can do coast to coast a.m. tonight because by the time I was into like
[02:56:31.680 --> 02:56:35.440]  11th hour of transmission yesterday and barking orders behind the scenes,
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:42.320]  I had no voice by nine o'clock last night. But a rascal always I can start to feel it
[02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:47.360]  even now, starting to get a little bit even. Again, I don't do a Clint Eastwood voice on
[02:56:47.360 --> 02:56:54.560]  purpose. Go ahead, punk. Make my day. My name's Bill Clinton. I didn't have sex
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:57:04.560]  with that lady. I always tell you the truth. And in your firearms, it's not that I want to enslave
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:08.480]  you or anything. It's just that we're buying a lot more guns. We like to be the only ones that
[02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:13.600]  have them over at Mina at the airport where we fly the narcotics in. So that's basically all
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:20.560]  I wanted to say to you. How's that sound? OK. Again, I know we got a bunch of callers,
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:27.200]  I'll get to you and then I will get to these video clips, but John. And then.
[02:57:27.200 --> 02:57:34.400]  Others that are patiently holding Trish, Bill, Dean and Billy, I'll get to all of you
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:39.440]  and a little day sometimes on air and make jokes because I'm tired and I start singing along with
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:44.640]  Willie Nelson and then, you know, everything else goes out the window and will also review the
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:50.880]  latest up at DrudgeReport.com. I say that because I want to go over and see what's being covered.
[02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:56.320]  Yeah, explosives made of pressure cookers. Roommate speaks out about Saudi National
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:58:01.840]  being questioned by FBI. Well, if Saudi the Saudis did it, we have to spin the globe
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:06.320]  and then just randomly pick a country like Iraq and attack it like maybe maybe the Pentagon
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:11.360]  can nuke Canada. If Saudi Arabia is involved in this again, we'll just attack another random
[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:19.200]  country like like Luxembourg or something or or or or maybe Mexico or lawmakers question
[02:58:19.200 --> 02:58:24.160]  trusted status for Saudi travelers after Boston. Congressmen are just caution on immigration.
[02:58:24.160 --> 02:58:27.200]  Muslim Brotherhood leader points to conspiracy behind bombing.
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:33.920]  Two men speaking Arabic escorted off plane. It just goes on and on. Witness recount war
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:37.920]  zone at Marathon. Warning, graphic content. That's some of the stuff there. We're covering
[02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:43.760]  it all at Infowars.com. Thank you for listening.
[02:58:43.760 --> 02:58:47.440]  Infowars.com forward slash listen. Send that to your friends and family.
[02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:54.000]  I believe the bankers are our friends. I had tried everything. I'd cut back the
[02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:58.560]  amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:03.280]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[02:59:03.280 --> 02:59:08.960]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:14.080]  be satisfied. Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowars.com, but I want to point
[02:59:14.080 --> 02:59:22.160]  out the three that have helped me lose thirty seven pounds in just two months. Products like
[02:59:22.160 --> 02:59:27.120]  Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy

[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:29.280]  Look at drugs report dot com. We need more cameras. I remember a couple of years ago,
[03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:35.280]  like eight, nine years ago, a two billion dollar Homeland Security grant to put cameras up all
[03:00:35.280 --> 03:00:40.720]  over Boston. I mean, it's the finishing line of the of the biggest sporting events in the world.
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:44.000]  And they're saying they don't have enough cameras. You know, what we need is
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:49.840]  if you're watching us on TV, we do not need more cameras on representative Peter King,
[03:00:49.840 --> 03:01:00.800]  who looks like the bride of Frankenstein. He looks like a pasty like a hell raiser.
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:06.640]  Like you put him in a leather outfit, like a big zipper. You know, down the front of him.
[03:01:06.640 --> 03:01:11.760]  And that's a hell raiser creature right there, ladies and gentlemen. I mean, I'm sorry. It looks
[03:01:11.760 --> 03:01:20.640]  like he's been to hell to look at those eyes, shark eyes, one way eyes like there's nothing behind it.
[03:01:20.640 --> 03:01:26.400]  Peter King, who, by the way, wants your guns, but but but he's a good Republican,
[03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:30.320]  he gets to keep his bodyguards. Hey, buddy, why don't you move to North Korea?
[03:01:30.960 --> 03:01:34.640]  How's that sound? And there's all sorts of jitters, LaGuardia terminal,
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:42.080]  evacuated over a suspicious package. But meanwhile, the borders are wide open.
[03:01:42.080 --> 03:01:46.000]  And the reporters all just, oh, my God, the terrorists are going to get his own
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:50.640]  homeland. Take me away. Save me. Never thinking it could be homeland that's doing it.
[03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:54.080]  John in Washington, and we're gonna go to everybody else. John, thanks for holding
[03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:58.720]  your on the air. Hey, how's it going, Alex? First time caller. I've been listening to
[03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:03.360]  your show for a little while now. And just because you got a great show, man.
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:10.960]  Well, thank you, sir. I've served in the army for over 20 years. And I can tell you that,
[03:02:10.960 --> 03:02:17.440]  from my experience, I, you know, go back to 1995 to 97, the first time I served in Saudi Arabia,
[03:02:17.440 --> 03:02:23.120]  and we were doing anti terrorism training, man, counterterrorism training. And since then,
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:28.080]  I've been to a few more courses throughout the world. A couple places that you know,
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:34.080]  I really can't talk about. But when Iraq broke off, and the first time I saw a, you know,
[03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:38.400]  suicide bomber, I was like, man, I've seen these vests before. And I couldn't really place it. But
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:45.840]  I remember, you know, going through training back in 95 96 in Saudi Arabia, and you know,
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.880]  it was right around the Khobar tower bombing, because there was a bombing in November 2003.
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:59.680]  I mean, in 90, November of 95. In Riyadh, it was a car bomb. And then it was unsuccessful. And then
[03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:05.520]  in 96 is when you know, the Khobar towers blew up in it, you know, skyrocketed all of the anti
[03:03:05.520 --> 03:03:10.480]  terrorism training just went up from there. But I can tell you that everything that we do,
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:16.400]  it leads up to a training event. And these training events culminate with some kind of
[03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:21.040]  joint task force training. And if you look right now, I think that's what's happening. You know,
[03:03:21.040 --> 03:03:27.440]  I think you put your finger right on it, you got joint exercises going on all around the world.
[03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:33.920]  Yeah, so they integrate the military in with the police, they start federalizing the police,
[03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:38.560]  the special event police, then the general police, you standardize the codes, the cars,
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:43.840]  the equipment, the training, and you have total federalization. And the feds themselves are
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:50.560]  globalist. And so it's full globalization. It's a UN UNESCO policy, right through the
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:57.840]  federal government into a new hyper afraid nanny state, surveilling everyone and disappearing
[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:02.640]  people off into government spider holes. Ultra creepy. Homeland Security, though,
[03:04:02.640 --> 03:04:07.760]  has a new website. Learn how DHS helps keep our nation safe by putting al-Qaeda in charge in
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:15.200]  Libyan Syria, and GOP moves to prop up Obamacare. Of course, the big banks wrote it. I mean, of
[03:04:15.200 --> 03:04:21.600]  course, GOP fast tracks bill to fortify Obamacare. I mean, this is so sick. And I told you, that's
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:25.760]  why we're in so much trouble. It's not just the Democrats are pure evil. The Republicans are just
[03:04:25.760 --> 03:04:30.960]  a fake loyal opposition. How do we get around something like that? A whole synthetic reality.
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:36.480]  Well, there's a lot of people in the military that I know, friends of mine that, you know,
[03:04:36.480 --> 03:04:41.600]  they don't, you know, they don't buy into all of the, you know, the BS that goes on. I mean,
[03:04:41.600 --> 03:04:45.840]  you see it every day. I mean, you've been through numerous joint training exercises.
[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:50.480]  I mean, we even train ourselves to act like the terrorists. So like you got,
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:55.040]  you got opposing forces, you got your out for the facts, just like the terrorist elements,
[03:04:55.040 --> 03:04:59.040]  you know, along with, you know, I want to hear more about this one of the other colors.

[03:07:04.400 --> 03:07:08.640]  delivered to your body in the shape that nature gave them if they are to be used to create new
[03:07:08.640 --> 03:07:13.040]  proteins in your body. Just like a brick layer, cannot use bent or twisted bricks to build a
[03:07:13.040 --> 03:07:18.400]  brick wall, so too your body cannot use bent or twisted amino acids to build new proteins.

[03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:19.360]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now,
[03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:32.080]  live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:46.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got the reporters coming in. And I was just talking to
[03:08:46.240 --> 03:08:52.320]  Leanne McAdoo, who's gonna be in here with Ja'Carri Jackson and David Knight. She was talking
[03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:57.760]  about trolls and the standard deal they do in the YouTube videos going, don't you care about
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:01.760]  the people? Yeah, I care about the million dead Iraqis. I care about the hundreds of thousands
[03:09:01.760 --> 03:09:07.280]  that die from bad drug interactions every year and flesh-eating bacteria. I care about the kids
[03:09:07.280 --> 03:09:12.800]  dying from deadly vaccines by the thousands and hundreds of thousands being injured, autism going
[03:09:12.800 --> 03:09:20.320]  from 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 50-something. That's a troll thing they do. That, oh, give this time
[03:09:20.320 --> 03:09:27.600]  with a tragedy for us to find out what really happened. Don't talk about the drill. Hey,
[03:09:27.600 --> 03:09:32.960]  the police are mourning what Dorner did to them. Don't talk about how they claim they burned him
[03:09:32.960 --> 03:09:39.040]  down. Don't look at that. They don't want us upfront addressing the information. I've never
[03:09:39.040 --> 03:09:50.080]  seen trolls going this wild on this many fronts. I've never seen anything like it in my life.
[03:09:50.080 --> 03:09:54.320]  And this is the type of stuff getting posted up to Reddit. And whether it's real or not,
[03:09:54.320 --> 03:09:58.000]  this is exactly what you could expect to see. So this is real. I'll read this now
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.280]  before we go back to the calls, John and others, show that if it unfolds.
[03:10:02.080 --> 03:10:06.320]  I work on a security commission and I've just received word to start campaigning on a
[03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:10.000]  campaign we've been working on the last two months and now it all makes sense.
[03:10:10.640 --> 03:10:17.120]  I'll keep it as short as I can. They're going to pin this event on a male, late teens to early
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:26.000]  20s. And I'd say he did it because he's unstable. And say he did it, he wouldn't say that. And they
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:30.400]  say he did it because he's unstable. They're going to find firearms in an NRA book in his home.
[03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:34.880]  They're going to say he used reloading powder. Yeah, I was thinking that too to then ban that
[03:10:34.880 --> 03:10:38.960]  for the explosion and that reloading powder shouldn't be for sale to the public. Absolutely,
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:43.680]  that shuts down reloading. It's about going after the bullets. They're going to use this to say
[03:10:43.680 --> 03:10:50.640]  that because the powder in ammunition can be used for explosions, the number of rounds you can buy
[03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:57.440]  should be limited and taxed to help pay for these events. I can't do anything or I'll lose my job,
[03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:01.120]  possibly face criminal charges. Please don't let them get away with it.
[03:11:01.120 --> 03:11:06.560]  They won't find the suspect till later this week and the raid is to occur on Friday. This was a
[03:11:06.560 --> 03:11:11.760]  staged event. The people hurt are real, but the event was planned. Don't let them hurt our rights.
[03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:17.120]  I'm going to use a copy of a picture from another thread. So please don't mention me. It will
[03:11:17.120 --> 03:11:23.360]  seriously hurt me. Now again, is that somebody trying to warn folks or is that fake? Folks,
[03:11:23.360 --> 03:11:28.400]  all I know is every show should prepare for veterans to attack, prepare for Christians
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:32.880]  to attack. The tea party is going to blow you up. The tea party is going to shoot you, blah, blah,
[03:11:32.880 --> 03:11:37.840]  blah. And now this happens. I mean, this is incredible. And now they try to deny this drill
[03:11:37.840 --> 03:11:42.880]  was happening. John in the army, Washington, what is your take on this, sir? In closing,
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:49.600]  what is your take on this? Well, you know, I just see this as it's a joint terrorism task force
[03:11:49.600 --> 03:11:54.160]  training exercise. It kind of looks that way to me. You know, all of these guys are, you know,
[03:11:54.160 --> 03:11:58.480]  in place, the commonalities behind them. And I know they're there because it's a big event, but
[03:11:59.120 --> 03:12:03.280]  I mean, with the, with the excess amount of people that they have on the ground
[03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:07.920]  and immediately they jump into this task force and have everybody ready to go, it just seemed to me,
[03:12:08.800 --> 03:12:13.680]  it seemed kind of staged. That's, that's all I know. It seems like a real tragedy terrorist
[03:12:13.680 --> 03:12:19.120]  attack, but, uh, you know, where exactly it's coming from. I mean, it, uh, you know,
[03:12:19.120 --> 03:12:23.040]  I don't know for sure. Well, I mean, the Southern poverty law center, it was deeply involved in
[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:28.160]  Oklahoma city at Elohim city. They come out and say, uh, there's going to be attacks. They're
[03:12:28.160 --> 03:12:32.720]  imminent and we're your savior. I mean, this is so old. I mean, have you seen the TV shows out
[03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:37.200]  there where every bad guy's a Patriot? I mean, I've never seen such a buildup. I mean, this is
[03:12:37.200 --> 03:12:41.760]  all scripted. The, the, the bomb robots delivered everywhere the last year, the body scanners
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:47.680]  delivered right as the underwear bombing happens. I mean, it's all scripted and, and we'll see who
[03:12:47.680 --> 03:12:51.760]  they blame it on, but they're already saying right wing Al Qaeda, right wing, who will it be?
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:55.200]  Right. When you're all kind of not, Hey, are the weatherman back to something, you know?
[03:12:55.200 --> 03:12:59.360]  No, it's none of that. It's just this thing to hang it out there so they can project it
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:04.560]  onto whoever they want. Uh, I appreciate your call, John Dean and Pennsylvania army. Thanks
[03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:12.560]  for holding her on the air. Hey Alex, uh, I'm not in the army now. I served from 1989 to 1993.
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:18.880]  Uh, my unit was alpha company, three 13 military intelligence battalion of the 82nd airborne.
[03:13:18.880 --> 03:13:24.320]  And I wanted to back up what Mr. Skalson was saying about lower level people knowing
[03:13:24.320 --> 03:13:32.720]  intelligence and what's going on. Um, you do not know. Um, we had what was called CW
[03:13:32.720 --> 03:13:39.440]  warrant officers that were specialists in their field, which would be interrogation and things
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:45.520]  like that. My battalion was what was called a seaweed battalion. It was a combat electronic
[03:13:45.520 --> 03:13:53.600]  warfare intelligence. And like you described very well, it is compartmentalized. There
[03:13:53.600 --> 03:14:01.600]  are certain positions like I'll give you an example, our S3, which was our S3 air. The
[03:14:01.600 --> 03:14:09.360]  person sit behind that desk had to be an E seven or above. Just to be in that battalion,
[03:14:09.360 --> 03:14:15.680]  you had to have a top secret clearance. For God's sake. I had an underage drinking when
[03:14:15.680 --> 03:14:22.240]  I was like 19 years old. I was held in limbo for two weeks just to get into that battalion.
[03:14:22.800 --> 03:14:31.120]  So the FBI could run checks on it. It is not, you are not privy to that information and I can't see
[03:14:31.120 --> 03:14:37.120]  it being changed that much. And matter of fact, I would think it would be more stringent nowadays
[03:14:37.120 --> 03:14:42.880]  with, um, you know, everything else going on, especially like with Manning and things like that.
[03:14:43.680 --> 03:14:52.320]  Um, it, it, it just don't happen. Um, and I'll tell you what, in, in a battalion or anything
[03:14:52.320 --> 03:14:59.680]  like that, it's just like high school. I mean, rumor mills roll. Um, absolutely. No, no. That's
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:03.920]  what's going on. Crews went out there when they're out there with role players screaming, I'm an
[03:15:03.920 --> 03:15:08.000]  American. Please don't put me in the camp. Don't take my guns. I'll talk to the Marines. And I go,
[03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:11.760]  we don't know who we're trying to fight. And I'm like, you're trying to fight Americans.
[03:15:11.760 --> 03:15:16.640]  And they don't even know that they don't tell us. It's just the green forest. We're the red force.
[03:15:17.360 --> 03:15:22.560]  And, uh, absolutely. Uh, people inside, it's not like James Bond who knows everything.
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:27.600]  Uh, it's the complete opposite. And then you'll have like two guys inserted. That's
[03:15:27.600 --> 03:15:32.800]  why they do the drill who are deep cover in there. They plant the bombs and they get out.
[03:15:32.800 --> 03:15:36.560]  They bring the Patsy with them. Who's part of the drill. So they can later set him up.
[03:15:36.560 --> 03:15:41.360]  We just know from past operations. Good to hear from you, Dean. Uh, let's go ahead and
[03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:48.000]  talk to Logan. Uh, no, no, no. Logan just got on. Let me go to whoever's been on the longest,
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:51.040]  uh, bill in Indiana. Uh, go ahead. You're on the air.
[03:15:51.920 --> 03:15:57.760]  Yes. Hello. I'm good. Go ahead, sir. Yeah. Uh, yes. I was just calling to talk to you about
[03:15:57.760 --> 03:16:04.560]  what's going on. Go ahead, sir. Um, has anybody thought of any kind of, is this on the radio?
[03:16:05.360 --> 03:16:09.200]  Yeah, we're on the radio. You called in, we don't screen calls. So you're, uh, you're on
[03:16:09.200 --> 03:16:14.560]  there right now, bill. Okay. I want you to look at a 47 year pattern that they're running on us.
[03:16:14.560 --> 03:16:24.000]  And if you do that, you'll go back to 66, the 1919, the 1972. Every 47 years,
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:29.840]  we'll get the history of them years and see what happened yesterday. In 1919,
[03:16:32.240 --> 03:16:33.520]  they had the red scare riots.
[03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:44.000]  Hello? I'm trying to let you talk. Yeah. I was, I'm not a good talker.
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.160]  No, you're doing good, bro. I just want you to be able to make your points.
[03:16:46.960 --> 03:16:51.280]  Okay. I think they're running two patterns on us, the 47 year pattern and at 33,
[03:16:51.280 --> 03:16:57.840]  a 33 will bring us back to 80. And then the 47 look at those magic years. And then 1914,
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:17:02.480]  before that, I hear you very, very interesting. Send me an email with more information.
[03:17:02.480 --> 03:17:05.600]  Now let's talk to Trish in New York. Who's got a family in the military.
[03:17:05.600 --> 03:17:10.640]  What's your take on all this trash? Well, I'm, I'm just, um, I'm just curious
[03:17:10.640 --> 03:17:17.200]  about what you said earlier. Um, because it seems like there needs to be more awareness of,
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:21.760]  of how interrelated what's going on in the middle East is with what's going on here.
[03:17:22.400 --> 03:17:28.080]  And, um, and you brought that to the program. I'm really grateful for that, but, um, I don't know if
[03:17:28.080 --> 03:17:34.800]  you're aware, but, um, Huffington post is now running a story about the Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia
[03:17:35.680 --> 03:17:43.600]  that has made a comment, um, praising the bombings. And, um, he's a guy from a Salafi
[03:17:43.600 --> 03:17:49.200]  group in Jordan, which by the way, we're fully funding on the globalist star to invade all these
[03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:53.760]  countries. So, I mean, if they go with that route again, they've already tried to tie right wing to
[03:17:53.760 --> 03:17:58.960]  it. Is it right wing or is it Al Qaeda implying right wing as the new Al Qaeda? Uh, so we don't
[03:17:58.960 --> 03:18:03.120]  know. They're going to build up the crescendo before they roll out, but it just has all the
[03:18:03.120 --> 03:18:07.280]  signs. I mean, does everybody get my point about how every TV show says the Patriots are going to
[03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:11.360]  blow everything up now and Green Lantern fights the militia and the militia is going to blow up
[03:18:11.360 --> 03:18:15.360]  the football game? I mean, they do this before they stage it and blame it on us.
[03:18:16.720 --> 03:18:20.320]  They're going to be able to get away with that just on its own, but if they tie
[03:18:20.960 --> 03:18:28.800]  together, um, a right winger to, to Al Qaeda, um, you know, that might make the dimension big
[03:18:28.800 --> 03:18:35.680]  enough. Um, I mean, what you mentioned before about the Oklahoma city bombing, um, I've been
[03:18:35.680 --> 03:18:41.280]  working also as a, as a freelance journalist for the last decade. And, um, I don't know if you're
[03:18:41.280 --> 03:18:46.400]  familiar with what went on in Lebanon, their version of nine 11, when that prime minister
[03:18:46.400 --> 03:18:53.200]  was killed over there and I was over there, um, during that time. And what was very odd during
[03:18:53.200 --> 03:18:58.480]  the time I was over there before the bombing happened with all the FBI that were all over
[03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:03.600]  the place in Lebanon and in Beirut. And I know that the CIA and various intelligence
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:11.440]  agencies are over there a lot. But, um, what, what happened was I got hooked up to a guy who,
[03:19:12.320 --> 03:19:19.600]  um, had, he made the claim and, you know, gave various substantiating evidence that
[03:19:19.600 --> 03:19:24.160]  he was having this mad affair with this woman. And had I ever heard of her and,
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:29.360]  you know, and at the time I didn't until later I researched and it turned out it,
[03:19:29.360 --> 03:19:33.280]  he claimed, he gave me the name and the photo and it didn't mean anything to me at the time.
[03:19:33.280 --> 03:19:36.880]  And it turns out it was Carol Howe from the Oklahoma city bombing
[03:19:37.600 --> 03:19:43.760]  and that she had been over in Beirut. He claimed for the nine months up until Hariri was killed
[03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:48.960]  in like a few days before, before the car bombing there, she disappeared. Like he never heard.
[03:19:48.960 --> 03:19:52.720]  And it was Carol how exposed Southern Broadway law center was involved in Oklahoma city. They
[03:19:52.720 --> 03:19:56.240]  tried to put her in prison. Very interesting. I think I remember reading about these connections
[03:19:56.240 --> 03:20:00.080]  before you ought to write an article up about that. Okay. We got the other crew coming in here.
[03:20:00.080 --> 03:20:05.280]  We got nightly news tonight in the last two years alone, the U S has seen huge losses to our food
[03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:11.520]  supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the U S costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone.
[03:20:11.520 --> 03:20:16.960]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight,
[03:20:16.960 --> 03:20:21.920]  out of mind. And so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are, we all are
[03:20:21.920 --> 03:20:26.640]  food shortages, drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,

[03:22:31.840 --> 03:22:36.240]  you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs
[03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:40.640]  they've been available since 1986. Yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[03:22:40.640 --> 03:22:45.920]  of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you
[03:22:45.920 --> 03:22:52.080]  would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising

[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:05.680]  We travel so much and having a fake TV well it gives added peace of mind.
[03:23:05.680 --> 03:23:11.440]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets but fake TV can fool even
[03:23:11.440 --> 03:23:16.720]  professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television. As a recent widow living
[03:23:16.720 --> 03:23:22.240]  alone it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window and know that passing
[03:23:22.240 --> 03:23:27.600]  motorists and pedestrians will think someone is on watching TV when I'm actually away from home.
[03:23:27.600 --> 03:23:33.920]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer and they're so easy to use
[03:23:33.920 --> 03:23:38.240]  you just plug them in and they're ready to go. Plus they're so affordable that we have one

[03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:24.880]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones radio show. We are in the Overdrive segment.
[03:24:24.880 --> 03:24:29.440]  I'm not Alex Jones, I'm Jakari Jackson for the Info Wars Nightly News. Alex is taking a break.
[03:24:29.440 --> 03:24:33.360]  And in this Overdrive segment we will be joined by David Knight and Leanne McAdoo,
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:38.400]  one of our new reporters here in the Info War. But first I just want to recap some of our new
[03:24:38.400 --> 03:24:43.120]  viewers who just may be joining us. One of our reporters Dan Badandi up in the northeast
[03:24:43.120 --> 03:24:48.800]  had a chance to go to a couple news conferences concerning the bombings in Boston.
[03:24:48.800 --> 03:24:51.920]  And I do believe we have a couple of those clips you guys let me know when you're ready.
[03:24:51.920 --> 03:24:57.600]  In this first clip I believe the one that's a minute oh six, Dan confronts the mayor or
[03:24:57.600 --> 03:25:02.000]  governor should I say to ask about some of the things that's going on in the city asking about
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:07.040]  drills or excuse me the police commissioner to ask about the things that are going on in the city.
[03:25:07.040 --> 03:25:11.200]  Are there bomb drills? Were there bomb sniffing dogs? And if there were bomb sniffing dogs,
[03:25:11.200 --> 03:25:15.120]  why weren't any bombs recovering? I do believe we have that clip, so let's go ahead with that.
[03:25:15.120 --> 03:25:41.360]  I have to take any questions. No, next question.
[03:25:45.120 --> 03:25:53.600]  The investigation is in the area that the governor mentioned.
[03:26:00.080 --> 03:26:03.680]  We're actually working very closely with the families right now. We're going through those
[03:26:03.680 --> 03:26:25.920]  right now. And this goes into the Piers Morgan clip after that. But some very real general
[03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:30.560]  questions. Were there bomb sniffing dogs? Were there bomb drills? We've heard a coach of one of
[03:26:30.560 --> 03:26:34.960]  the runners say that he was told that they were running drills and actually saw them themselves.
[03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:38.800]  We've heard people say that they saw some other fishy things going on. We've seen the
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:43.920]  cherry picker photo of the man that's on the roof. And I'll stop for a second about the
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:48.400]  man on the roof. The thing that really surprised me was this lone individual on the roof.
[03:26:48.400 --> 03:26:52.400]  I know many times there are many times our sporting events and people who live in the local
[03:26:52.400 --> 03:26:58.160]  area live around the track or the football field or whatever it may be just watch from their homes.
[03:26:58.160 --> 03:27:02.240]  If they have apartment complex or something that they can get on top of, they often go to the top
[03:27:02.240 --> 03:27:07.200]  of the roof and watch the event. So I thought it was very suspect that there was only one person
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:13.520]  up on the roof as if maybe the roofs were off limit for some reason. I thought that was
[03:27:13.520 --> 03:27:17.520]  very suspicious and we'll have David Knight in a little bit just to talk about that.
[03:27:17.520 --> 03:27:21.200]  But in the meantime, I'll go through some of the news and Alex's stack.
[03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:27.440]  Person briefed on pro bombs and pressure cookers. Now this is from the AP. A person briefed on
[03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:33.280]  the Boston Marathon investigation says that the explosives were a six liter pressure cooker
[03:27:34.160 --> 03:27:38.720]  placed in black duffel bags. The person says the explosives were placed on the ground and
[03:27:38.720 --> 03:27:45.280]  contain shards of metal nails and ball bearings. The person spoke on the condition of an amenity
[03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:52.240]  because of the investigation is ongoing. So we saw the FBI earlier this morning hold a
[03:27:52.240 --> 03:27:56.720]  press conference. And in the press conference, they said they were very confident that they had
[03:27:56.720 --> 03:28:03.120]  secured all the explosives. The investigation is obviously still ongoing for suspect or suspects.
[03:28:03.120 --> 03:28:07.040]  The earlier reports we heard about a Saudi national being the suspect was
[03:28:07.760 --> 03:28:12.560]  later overturned saying, I'm not exactly sure why they chose to single out that individual,
[03:28:12.560 --> 03:28:20.320]  but he has been cleared of the charges from what I am told. So it's a very hard thing for
[03:28:21.200 --> 03:28:25.840]  us in this country at this time. We see just recently Sandy Hook and now we have this new
[03:28:25.840 --> 03:28:34.320]  tragedy in Boston. And regardless if it was a false flag or lone gunman or group with their
[03:28:34.320 --> 03:28:38.960]  particular interests, it's always gonna be used not to let a good crisis go to waste.
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:43.680]  They're gonna find some way to push their new agenda, to push out the new TSA rollouts,
[03:28:43.680 --> 03:28:49.600]  to push out the whatever, the XYZ, the new thing that they wanna test. And I think it's
[03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:54.880]  definitely forthcoming. We already see the TSA Viper teams, we see the TSA at football games,
[03:28:54.880 --> 03:29:00.240]  at whatever else. I think they were at a Romney event last year. I don't know why they'd be at
[03:29:00.240 --> 03:29:04.880]  a Romney event, but they were there checking people's bags. They were at the Obama inauguration,
[03:29:05.440 --> 03:29:10.000]  testing people, checking people's bags, patting people down. And it's definitely more of the
[03:29:10.000 --> 03:29:13.920]  police state that we've been mourning about here on the Info Wars for a good time.
[03:29:13.920 --> 03:29:18.400]  And you can see the quote right there if you're watching on infowards.com forward slash listen,
[03:29:18.400 --> 03:29:24.480]  no crisis should go to waste. That is from Rahm Emanuel. And I do believe we have a break. So
[03:29:24.480 --> 03:29:38.960]  stay tuned. We'll be right back after this break with Leanne McAdoo. And after that, David Knight.

[03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:19.120]  And welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm Jakari Jackson filling in for Alex.
[03:33:19.120 --> 03:33:21.680]  I'm joined here with David Knight. How are you doing, David?
[03:33:21.680 --> 03:33:25.840]  Doing good, Jakari. All right, now there's an article on InfoWars.com.
[03:33:25.840 --> 03:33:29.920]  It was just on a second ago, if you guys can put that back on. The Paul Joseph Watson article
[03:33:29.920 --> 03:33:34.560]  concerning an episode of Family Guy. And we get people who comment and say, why do you guys
[03:33:34.560 --> 03:33:40.400]  reference a cartoon or a video game or whatever else? Now, this particular episode of Family Guy,
[03:33:40.400 --> 03:33:46.880]  I believe it's called, what is it, Cowboys? Turban Cowboys. Turban Cowboys. And in this
[03:33:46.880 --> 03:33:54.640]  episode of Family Guy, the father, Peter Griffin, is a participant in the Boston Marathon.
[03:33:54.640 --> 03:33:59.760]  And it just so happens that two bombs go off in the marathon. So I do believe we have that clip
[03:33:59.760 --> 03:34:05.120]  ready to roll with. I'm Bob Costas here with Boston Marathon winner, Peter Griffin.
[03:34:05.120 --> 03:34:11.840]  Peter, how did you do it? Damn phone's busted. Maybe I dialed wrong.
[03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:19.840]  So you just saw the clip right there. Now, Paul Joseph Watson, I did an article and even
[03:34:19.840 --> 03:34:23.440]  a video accompanying that his video has been taken down. You can see it right there on the
[03:34:23.440 --> 03:34:28.720]  screen if you're watching on InfoWars.com forward slash. Listen, the video has been removed,
[03:34:28.720 --> 03:34:34.400]  as you saw just a second ago, is a very short clip. So I'm not sure what type of copyright
[03:34:34.400 --> 03:34:38.960]  infringements may be on that, but it has been taken down. And that was only about 14 seconds.
[03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:44.800]  And Watson was talking for about, it was over four minutes long in the video. So that's not
[03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:51.120]  a copyright violation. So that's pretty strange. And one of the things that's there is the guy,
[03:34:51.120 --> 03:34:57.520]  the father, they talk about Turban Cowboy. He gets aligned in that episode with an Islamic
[03:34:57.520 --> 03:35:02.000]  terrorist. He's a Tea Party guy, okay? So that all feeds into the narrative that they've been-
[03:35:02.000 --> 03:35:08.960]  And trying to get you on because they keep saying that it's gonna be your right wing extremist even
[03:35:08.960 --> 03:35:12.880]  yesterday. And they keep saying, well, InfoWars is making all these claims without any evidence. I
[03:35:12.880 --> 03:35:16.480]  mean, how many people made claims yesterday that it's gonna be some right winger without
[03:35:16.480 --> 03:35:21.680]  any type of evidence? They say Hollywood, they say politics makes strange bedfellows, but
[03:35:21.680 --> 03:35:25.680]  there aren't any stranger bedfellows on the Tea Party and Islamic terrorists. I mean-
[03:35:25.680 --> 03:35:30.480]  Exactly. Get any more polar opposites together, and yet they keep putting them together as bosom
[03:35:30.480 --> 03:35:32.960]  buddies throughout all these Hollywood shows. They keep-
[03:35:32.960 --> 03:35:38.320]  Exactly. It's not just that it was the following, the Fox TV show. I even saw an episode of
[03:35:38.320 --> 03:35:43.600]  Green Lantern. And I mean, it goes way down the rabbit hole. It's not any one-time deal,
[03:35:43.600 --> 03:35:48.080]  one-off deal. It's something that has happened and continues to happen because I believe that
[03:35:48.080 --> 03:35:52.960]  it was a recent episode. So it's nothing new, and why would they play that right before?
[03:35:52.960 --> 03:35:58.640]  And some people say, well, you're grasping at straws. But then you look at the Batman film.
[03:35:58.640 --> 03:36:02.080]  Alex did a video on that, and people are like, how do you know before it happens?
[03:36:02.080 --> 03:36:06.720]  Because he sees these triggers. And more recently, I don't believe the film has come out yet,
[03:36:06.720 --> 03:36:12.640]  but World War Z. It's all about the dehumanization and the UN is here to save us
[03:36:12.640 --> 03:36:17.440]  heroically. What are your thoughts on that, David? Well, we're criticized by people like
[03:36:17.440 --> 03:36:22.960]  Glenn Beck and Solon, but we see this, as you said, we see it from Hollywood narrative.
[03:36:22.960 --> 03:36:29.360]  We see it from papers that are being put out by West Point Military Academy, other terrorist
[03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:36.240]  organizations. We've seen a steady stream of this narrative about how the enemies of this country
[03:36:36.240 --> 03:36:39.520]  are people who are looking for limited government, people who think there ought to be limits on the
[03:36:39.520 --> 03:36:43.200]  government, people who want to adhere to the Constitution, people that they'd like to
[03:36:43.200 --> 03:36:48.240]  characterize therefore as right wing. We keep seeing this over and over and over again. And
[03:36:48.240 --> 03:36:53.920]  that's why when we saw this happen, we were suspicious of it. Because there's not anything
[03:36:53.920 --> 03:36:58.320]  about, we were criticized for jumping on it saying, well, this might look like this might
[03:36:58.320 --> 03:37:03.360]  be a false flag. Let's take a look at this. You said that right away that we should examine this.
[03:37:03.360 --> 03:37:09.200]  Why? Because when you have a crime in an area, you want to look at the MO of the people that
[03:37:09.200 --> 03:37:12.800]  are there. In other words, if you've got somebody that's a known rapist and he's in the area or
[03:37:12.800 --> 03:37:16.640]  child molester and you have a crime of that type, you're going to take a look at the person that's
[03:37:16.640 --> 03:37:21.920]  there. And we have documented over and over again, there's been declassified documents going back for
[03:37:21.920 --> 03:37:26.240]  decades talking about false flag attacks that the government has done or false flag attacks that
[03:37:26.240 --> 03:37:32.080]  they planned like Operation Northwoods. And so when we see things like that, and we believe
[03:37:32.080 --> 03:37:38.080]  that there were similar things that happened in 9-11 and in the 7-7 bombings and in the Oslo,
[03:37:38.080 --> 03:37:44.480]  Norway bombings, we see that they have a drill that's operating alongside. So as we were already
[03:37:44.480 --> 03:37:50.080]  suspicious because the government had that kind of MO, there's nothing there that anybody would
[03:37:50.080 --> 03:37:54.320]  really gain from except the government because they're going to be able to ramp up the security
[03:37:54.320 --> 03:37:59.760]  state. And then when we saw the drill being reported happening alongside, that was the
[03:37:59.760 --> 03:38:06.240]  thing, that's when we said- Yeah, we were calling BS. Now we'll talk about that drill in just one
[03:38:06.240 --> 03:38:09.920]  second, but we have some news the producers just handed me a second ago. This is from the
[03:38:09.920 --> 03:38:16.480]  mail online. He's a witness, not a suspect. Burnside, a student had his apartment raided
[03:38:16.480 --> 03:38:22.880]  after the police ruled him out. Well, excuse me, before the police ruled him out and the bomb squad
[03:38:22.880 --> 03:38:30.560]  among 20 officers combining flat bags and evidence removed. Police also hunting dark skinned man
[03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:37.040]  with hooded dark colored sweatshirt and backpack seen trying to get into restricted area.
[03:38:37.040 --> 03:38:41.520]  So I guess that's what the new suspect is supposed to be, the dark skinned man,
[03:38:41.520 --> 03:38:45.760]  the man with the hoodie. I'm not exactly sure if that's the person we saw on the rooftops or not.
[03:38:45.760 --> 03:38:49.840]  Well, in terms of the Saudi, I saw one article and I have only seen it in one place. So I don't
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:55.520]  know if this is valid or not, but I saw a report that he was apprehended because he was running
[03:38:55.520 --> 03:39:00.080]  after the bomb. Somebody pointed at him and said, get him. Now, I don't know if they pointed at him
[03:39:00.080 --> 03:39:04.560]  because he was an Arab looking guy doing what most people will probably be doing after a bomb
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:09.840]  goes off and that is running in some direction. So I think that was basically what was going on
[03:39:09.840 --> 03:39:15.360]  with it. I think he was basically just- Singled out because, yeah, because a bomb goes off and
[03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:20.000]  you can see in the videos, there are people of all races from I'm sure all number of countries
[03:39:20.000 --> 03:39:24.160]  and they just scatter, just trying to get away from the blast. But it seems like this guy was
[03:39:24.720 --> 03:39:28.000]  being singled out. Well, and again, there have been a lot of bombings that have been done by
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:33.200]  Muslim people. But interestingly enough, there haven't been any bombings that have been done by
[03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:37.920]  patriot people, certainly not urban bombings. I can't think of any offhand. I mean, they've
[03:39:37.920 --> 03:39:43.920]  tried to pin it on Richard Jewell and stuff like that, but that was fake. I mean, when you're
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:47.280]  looking at something like this, again, going back to what we said, we've seen the government
[03:39:47.280 --> 03:39:51.680]  operate this way many times. So when something like this happens, that's the first thing we want
[03:39:51.680 --> 03:39:57.200]  to look at and look and see if there's any other telltale signs like a simultaneous drill.
[03:39:57.200 --> 03:40:04.240]  Exactly. Now, because we got a lot of criticism saying that this is a possibility, possibly a
[03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:09.920]  false flag, but so many other people were quick to say that it's not a false flag. And I'm like,
[03:40:09.920 --> 03:40:14.000]  well, how is there credibility more than ours when they're just with no evidence that it's not a
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:18.160]  false flag? No, it's not a false flag. And we say, well, there's a possibility. Nobody said it was
[03:40:18.160 --> 03:40:21.600]  definitely, so we didn't hear an info voice. Or you had people like Peter Bergen who immediately
[03:40:21.600 --> 03:40:26.160]  says it's a conservative right-wing terrorist. What evidence do you have of that?
[03:40:26.160 --> 03:40:30.800]  Evidence do you have of that? He'd already been building that narrative for 10 days prior to that.
[03:40:30.800 --> 03:40:34.960]  Okay, an article said he'd put out, and then he immediately does that. And exactly, he doesn't
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:39.120]  have any basis to say it any more than we said, well, we need to look at this and see if it is
[03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:42.960]  a false flag. Why? Because we've seen a lot of false flags. Exactly. And we have reason to
[03:40:42.960 --> 03:40:47.440]  suspect that it may be, just like you said, the drills. Why are they running drills? I mean,
[03:40:47.440 --> 03:40:52.000]  if they have bomb sniffing dogs, shouldn't they sniff a bomb that's right over there?
[03:40:52.000 --> 03:40:56.800]  I mean, just basic common sense questions that thus far have not been really asked.
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:41:01.440]  You know, nobody at the press conferences, at least that we've seen besides Dan Badandi,
[03:41:01.440 --> 03:41:07.040]  has dared to go and question these people on real things that people should be concerned about. I
[03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:12.320]  mean, were there drills? Were there not? We have many eyewitnesses, people who were there at the
[03:41:12.320 --> 03:41:16.160]  event saying that they did. But they didn't want to. They shut down the press conference
[03:41:16.160 --> 03:41:20.480]  when they got asked a pointed question like that. They just want fluff questions,
[03:41:20.480 --> 03:41:24.880]  you know? And we can come across as being hard-hearted because we don't
[03:41:24.880 --> 03:41:28.960]  want to just focus on the victims and that sort of thing. But we're looking further down the road.
[03:41:30.960 --> 03:41:37.200]  It's not that we don't feel what's going on, the people who've lost their lives, many people who've
[03:41:37.200 --> 03:41:44.000]  been horribly mutilated from this. But we also understand where this is headed because we said
[03:41:44.000 --> 03:41:48.240]  it when it happened with 9-11. And we got things like the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland
[03:41:48.240 --> 03:41:52.320]  Security. And we know what they've been building up for. And if you're another country, if you're
[03:41:52.320 --> 03:41:59.280]  Russia, and you see somebody building up arms on your border, pointing missiles at you, you're
[03:41:59.280 --> 03:42:03.200]  going to start getting paranoid about that. And you're going to start arming. And that's what the
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:07.120]  American people are doing. They see the government building up domestic arms when they buy these
[03:42:07.120 --> 03:42:11.520]  hollow-point bullets. That is not for the military. The military has their own armament. They're going
[03:42:11.520 --> 03:42:16.800]  into the public supply to get these things. And the military is prohibited by Geneva Convention
[03:42:16.800 --> 03:42:21.760]  from using hollow-point bullets. And so when we see them getting billions of bullets, which are
[03:42:21.760 --> 03:42:26.480]  just over the top of anything that they would need, and we see them getting armored personnel
[03:42:26.480 --> 03:42:32.240]  carriers, thousands of them, we see them getting bullet-fully automatic rifles. Yeah, bullet-proof
[03:42:32.240 --> 03:42:36.240]  boost to put on the roadblocks and that sort of thing. All of this stuff, and it's like,
[03:42:36.240 --> 03:42:40.160]  what are they doing? Because this is a domestic organization. But at the same time,
[03:42:40.160 --> 03:42:45.200]  we see these military documents where they're talking about selective internment and getting
[03:42:45.200 --> 03:42:50.640]  Social Security numbers and getting other things. That is not for foreign wars. That is not for
[03:42:50.640 --> 03:42:54.720]  urban control in foreign areas. And when they have these military operations that they've been
[03:42:54.720 --> 03:43:01.200]  having increasingly frequently throughout the major US cities, they're doing these as joint
[03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:07.840]  operations with police departments. Are they going to do operations in Iran with the Iranian police?
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:12.560]  I don't think so. These are about doing something domestically.
[03:43:12.560 --> 03:43:16.000]  And people keep saying, what's the big deal about having the troops on the streets? And
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:20.240]  like I've already said, we went to the Formula One racetrack here in Austin,
[03:43:20.240 --> 03:43:24.800]  and they had troops on the streets there, running checkpoints and so forth, and people going into
[03:43:24.800 --> 03:43:29.600]  the racetrack. And it's an acclimation. People get used to seeing the troops at the Super Bowl,
[03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:34.400]  not just during the halftime game, but troops out there checking bags or running checkpoints
[03:43:34.400 --> 03:43:39.280]  or whatever it is. And people get so used to it when they go out to the streets of the city
[03:43:39.280 --> 03:43:43.280]  of Boston. There's a bomb where the troops are already here. I'm not saying the troops were
[03:43:43.280 --> 03:43:49.120]  in on it, but the troops were all ready to go. And we've seen the pictures. I believe it was,
[03:43:49.120 --> 03:43:54.480]  oh, okay, we're watching something on infowars.com forward slash listen.
[03:43:56.320 --> 03:43:59.760]  Okay, this is something that Alex was mentioning earlier today with ManCal. This is,
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:06.320]  wow. Okay, so we see a bunch of bodies, or those are-
[03:44:06.320 --> 03:44:09.600]  Mannequins. Mannequins, yes. Those are the mannequins, okay.
[03:44:09.600 --> 03:44:14.640]  So we see a bunch of mannequins in a truck driving around. I'm assuming that's in the
[03:44:14.640 --> 03:44:16.880]  city of Boston, correct guys? Mannequins that were shot.
[03:44:17.440 --> 03:44:18.880]  Wow. To use as target practice.
[03:44:19.520 --> 03:44:22.640]  I heard Alex talk about that on the radio. I did not see the clip, so I didn't-
[03:44:22.640 --> 03:44:26.720]  Wow, yeah. Yeah, that's shocking to me. That's my first time seeing that clip as well. I heard him
[03:44:26.720 --> 03:44:30.640]  mention it, but yeah, we just saw a truckload full of mannequins, if you're still listening on the
[03:44:30.640 --> 03:44:35.920]  radio, a truckload of mannequins near the Boston event. When the government starts making targets,
[03:44:35.920 --> 03:44:41.360]  starts commissioning targets of civilians, American citizens, pregnant women, elderly people,
[03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:47.360]  kids, and commissioning targets of that and call it no hesitation. When we see them doing all this
[03:44:47.360 --> 03:44:52.000]  other stuff, it's like we're not being paranoid. We're just looking at this and saying, they're
[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:56.720]  up to something, and we've seen them do other things. And I don't see how you can say that
[03:44:56.720 --> 03:45:00.960]  somebody's being paranoid if you're watching on infowars.com forward slash listen or on
[03:45:00.960 --> 03:45:05.840]  prisonplanet.tv. You can see a target of a pregnant woman. This is a shooting target.
[03:45:05.840 --> 03:45:09.520]  Somebody is going to shoot at this. If we keep scrolling down, you'll see a picture of a little
[03:45:09.520 --> 03:45:17.760]  boy, of an old man, of an old woman, of a teenager and her daughter or sister, whoever it is. And
[03:45:17.760 --> 03:45:21.280]  this is what people are planning for. The government is planning to target these people.
[03:45:21.280 --> 03:45:27.280]  Yeah, absolutely. Well, let's talk about something here that is not exactly about the bombing,
[03:45:27.280 --> 03:45:34.320]  but I think this is all related. And that is CISPA. We look at the gun rights and various
[03:45:34.320 --> 03:45:39.040]  things. We see that CISPA is back and headed for a vote this week. That's the headline that I've
[03:45:39.040 --> 03:45:45.360]  got here, guys, if you want to search for that. Basically, this is something that is a cybersecurity
[03:45:45.360 --> 03:45:49.040]  measure, is how it's being put out, okay? And in order to do that, they're going to
[03:45:49.840 --> 03:45:53.680]  enact certain surveillance and controls over the Internet and over free speech.
[03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:58.320]  And it's sad that we see a constituency out there that wants to defend the Second Amendment,
[03:45:59.360 --> 03:46:04.720]  but they're not necessarily interested in Internet freedom or free speech. And then
[03:46:04.720 --> 03:46:09.040]  we also see the people who might be interested in free speech and keeping the Internet free
[03:46:09.040 --> 03:46:13.040]  that are absolutely opposed. Yeah, you have to have all your freedoms. That's right.
[03:46:13.040 --> 03:46:18.240]  We need the Second and the Fourth Amendment and the rest of the Tenement and the Constitution.
[03:46:18.240 --> 03:46:22.240]  Those are put in there for a reason. And you see, and this is why we need to get rid of this
[03:46:22.240 --> 03:46:26.640]  left-right paradigm. And we need people to come together and understand the underlying issue here
[03:46:26.640 --> 03:46:32.000]  is liberty. Because they're coming after them and using the same justifications, the same reason
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:36.720]  they're saying that we need to lose Internet freedom and we need to have no security in our
[03:46:36.720 --> 03:46:42.960]  person places and things. We need to be able to be searched at any time, constantly archived.
[03:46:42.960 --> 03:46:48.160]  I mean, this is the exact opposite of what the founders want to say. In other words,
[03:46:48.160 --> 03:46:53.280]  because of technology, they want to argue that because of technology, we should not have the
[03:46:53.280 --> 03:46:57.200]  Second Amendment anymore because guns are too dangerous. We should not have the Fourth Amendment
[03:46:57.200 --> 03:47:01.120]  anymore because it's too easy for us to hide information from the government.
[03:47:01.120 --> 03:47:06.320]  I don't know how it is. I mean, they can check your phone and your whatever else. I mean,
[03:47:06.320 --> 03:47:13.760]  what is that argument? To me, I look at this and because of technology, it is even more important
[03:47:13.760 --> 03:47:20.320]  that we have, okay, that's something going on. That's not ours. But because of this,
[03:47:20.320 --> 03:47:26.400]  I think it is even more important that we have Fourth Amendment protections, not less.
[03:47:26.400 --> 03:47:32.400]  And so when the government can set up the Utah Data Center, when the government can record and
[03:47:32.400 --> 03:47:37.920]  listen to every phone conversation and archive it and save it to the point where they can data
[03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:42.720]  mine it for everything and make a suspect out of everybody. I mean, you've taken a lot of
[03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:47.520]  technology. I mean, you've taken the Fourth Amendment, what the founders saw from the
[03:47:47.520 --> 03:47:52.400]  British troops that they were concerned about, you've taken that and put it on infinite steroids.
[03:47:52.400 --> 03:47:57.360]  And because they have that kind of technology, we need to press for the Fourth Amendment to be
[03:47:57.920 --> 03:48:02.080]  even stronger. So it needs to be as the fundamental principles that are laid down there,
[03:48:02.080 --> 03:48:05.280]  but it doesn't change because of technology. And that's the argument that they're making.
[03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:09.760]  And we need to get people who are culturally left and people who are culturally right and people
[03:48:09.760 --> 03:48:14.480]  who like this amendment but not that amendment. They need to come together and understand that
[03:48:14.480 --> 03:48:20.880]  this is a government that is coming after us in every direction. Every issue they're coming at us.
[03:48:20.880 --> 03:48:26.720]  And we need to stand together on liberty and on the Constitution and on the Bill of Rights
[03:48:26.720 --> 03:48:31.440]  and insist that technology only makes the government more dangerous and we need to
[03:48:31.440 --> 03:48:37.120]  even more rigidly enforce the protections of the Constitution rather than give them up.
[03:48:37.120 --> 03:48:42.640]  Exactly. And this is the Alex Jones Radio Show and I'm Takari Jackson here with David Knight,
[03:48:42.640 --> 03:48:46.240]  if you're just tuning in. Now we're talking about some of the things that are slipping under the
[03:48:46.240 --> 03:48:52.000]  radar as this situation in Boston continues to develop. The FBI is up there running their checks
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:56.000]  trying to see what new information they can find. But in the meantime, we want to talk about some
[03:48:56.000 --> 03:49:01.120]  things that aren't so much hitting the mainstream just because of all the things going on in Boston,
[03:49:01.120 --> 03:49:05.040]  that's understandable. But we can't forget about CISPA, we can't forget about gun rights,
[03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:09.840]  not just domestic issues, international issues, but David Knight, you were continuing with your CISPA.
[03:49:09.840 --> 03:49:14.320]  Yeah, we're gonna say you need to call your representatives and say, I want you to vote
[03:49:14.320 --> 03:49:21.280]  against gun bans and I want you to vote against CISPA. Come across as a unified front and call
[03:49:21.280 --> 03:49:25.360]  your representatives, whether they're Democrat or Republican. Democrats are probably gonna be
[03:49:26.000 --> 03:49:29.760]  sensitive and supportive of one issue more than Republicans and vice versa.
[03:49:29.760 --> 03:49:35.520]  But you as a voter need to call them up and say, I want you to vote against both of these bills.
[03:49:35.520 --> 03:49:39.600]  And people don't understand how important it is to actually call cuz we get a lot of people,
[03:49:40.560 --> 03:49:45.440]  they'll blog, they'll talk to their friends, they'll preach to the choir. But you need to go
[03:49:45.440 --> 03:49:50.640]  and talk to your elected officials. And I'm not just blowing smoke, when Chuck Schumer compared
[03:49:50.640 --> 03:49:55.520]  private gun sellers to child pornographers, I called his office. I didn't get to talk to him,
[03:49:55.520 --> 03:50:00.400]  I talked to one of his interns, interns, but I called in to make my voice known.
[03:50:00.400 --> 03:50:04.560]  And this is what it has to take. You have to call your representative, lo and behold, show up.
[03:50:05.520 --> 03:50:10.320]  Show up at your city council meeting, do what you have to do. Yell at them like Dan Badandi,
[03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:14.000]  jump on the couch like a Tom Cruise. Get these people to pay attention to you.
[03:50:14.000 --> 03:50:18.400]  It does make a difference. I know that in the early days of homeschooling,
[03:50:18.400 --> 03:50:22.160]  they were gonna pass some measures that were gonna severely terminate it. And boy,
[03:50:22.160 --> 03:50:26.000]  I tell you, the homeschoolers got that network out there, and they gave them an earful,
[03:50:26.000 --> 03:50:29.840]  and they backed off. They really backed off. So that was an important lesson.
[03:50:29.840 --> 03:50:36.000]  But Congress can agree on some things. And they passed this one law, about a year ago,
[03:50:36.000 --> 03:50:40.320]  they passed the STOCK Act. Right, and I think we're about to wrap up.
[03:50:40.320 --> 03:50:54.080]  So come back. Yeah, just hang on to that thought, and we'll be right back here on the Alex Jones

[03:54:25.920 --> 03:54:30.960]  Knight. And we're going to be going for a little bit longer, I believe an extra hour of overdrive,
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:35.840]  but be sure to check out the Infowars Nightly News tonight at 7 p.m. Central. Now, David Knight,
[03:54:35.840 --> 03:54:38.560]  we were talking about some of the things that are slipping through while the Boston
[03:54:39.200 --> 03:54:41.520]  investigation is ongoing. What else do you have?
[03:54:41.520 --> 03:54:46.400]  Well, you know, we can get the two different parties to agree on some things. And one of
[03:54:46.400 --> 03:54:52.240]  the things that they agreed on very quickly was to gut the STOCK Act. Now, that was the,
[03:54:52.240 --> 03:54:58.480]  an acronym, STOCK was Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act. And that came up, if you remember,
[03:54:58.480 --> 03:55:03.920]  there was a report about a year ago that there was a lot of insider trading going on in Congress
[03:55:03.920 --> 03:55:09.600]  on stocks and that sort of thing. And they said, oh, there's no law against that. And people got
[03:55:09.600 --> 03:55:15.440]  pretty upset about that. So they passed that law. And that required that congressmen and about
[03:55:15.440 --> 03:55:21.200]  28,000 aides that were associated with them had to publish anything that was a conflict of interest.
[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:27.280]  And so what happened is, as we were looking the other way, the end of the week last week in the
[03:55:27.280 --> 03:55:32.640]  Senate on the 11th, it was introduced and passed in the Senate unanimous consent is the way they
[03:55:32.640 --> 03:55:37.120]  put it. So they don't keep a roll call vote. And so they just passed it very quickly. And in the
[03:55:37.120 --> 03:55:43.120]  House, they passed it in 30 seconds. 30 seconds. 30 seconds. And said that they did it there
[03:55:43.120 --> 03:55:48.880]  essentially unanimously. So basically what they've done is gutted it because they no longer have to
[03:55:48.880 --> 03:55:54.720]  post that publicly. So whatever remains there, it really isn't useful for people to be able to
[03:55:54.720 --> 03:55:59.440]  investigate that, hold them accountable. So basically, they've essentially gutted that
[03:55:59.440 --> 03:56:03.360]  while we were looking the other way. And it's just more of what we've seen. We've seen,
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:08.880]  what was it last week? Bitcoin dropped significantly. We've seen gold and silver stocks
[03:56:08.880 --> 03:56:14.000]  drop as well. I mean, there's a lot of things going on behind the scenes while this massacre
[03:56:14.000 --> 03:56:18.960]  is going on or while the massacre is being investigated. And it's not just these things.
[03:56:18.960 --> 03:56:23.040]  It's not like we had a chance to talk to many of our listeners yesterday. And I would like to take
[03:56:23.040 --> 03:56:28.240]  some calls after we have Stuart Rhodes on. He's gonna be joining us in a few minutes.
[03:56:28.240 --> 03:56:33.680]  But people need to keep in mind that there are always things going on behind the scenes when
[03:56:33.680 --> 03:56:37.680]  these big events happen. And you need to keep in touch with your local legislators. You need to
[03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:41.280]  talk to people and find out what's going on in your area. Cuz there may be something in your
[03:56:41.280 --> 03:56:45.760]  local area that you can go film, something that's going on that needs to have its story told, but
[03:56:45.760 --> 03:56:50.720]  people just don't know about it. And they're very well aware of the news cycle. Okay, this stuff
[03:56:50.720 --> 03:56:55.360]  was done on Friday. And I know that they can pull all kinds of stuff on Friday and the weekends,
[03:56:55.360 --> 03:56:59.520]  and it's not gonna get covered very much. And when they pull this in and do it in 30 seconds,
[03:57:00.320 --> 03:57:06.400]  and they also know, just as they know that they can do this stuff on Fridays and the weekends,
[03:57:06.400 --> 03:57:10.720]  when you've got a big event like this, they can put all kinds of stuff under the news cycle.
[03:57:10.720 --> 03:57:15.440]  They can put all kinds of stuff under the radar. Whether it's a false flag or not,
[03:57:15.440 --> 03:57:20.240]  they're gonna use that. Just like whether it's a false flag or not, Homeland Security is going
[03:57:20.240 --> 03:57:26.880]  to use it to increase its control over our life, to put agents everywhere. So that's something we
[03:57:26.880 --> 03:57:31.920]  all need to be on the lookout. Everybody keep an eye out and watch Congress like a hawk.
[03:57:31.920 --> 03:57:37.360]  Like a hawk. And speaking of looking out, we have a video. Now this is a video that was sent to me
[03:57:37.360 --> 03:57:41.360]  and I'll just play it first and then we'll comment on it in just one second. So here's the video.
[03:58:07.360 --> 03:58:12.720]  Bizarre object has been left in its place. Draw your own conclusion.
[03:58:14.400 --> 03:58:18.320]  Okay. So if you're not watching the video, if you're listening on the radio,
[03:58:18.320 --> 03:58:23.920]  we just saw a video. Oh, are we about to go to break? Okay. All right. Well, we'll talk about
[03:58:23.920 --> 03:58:27.680]  that on the other side, but stay tuned. I think you're gonna like the explanation of that.
[03:58:27.680 --> 03:58:51.040]  It's coming up after this break. Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit gcnlive.com today.
