[00:00.000 --> 00:18.300]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.300 --> 00:48.140]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[00:48.300 --> 01:07.380]  well it's the eyes of March the day that Julius Caesar was killed 2,000 plus years
[01:07.380 --> 01:14.660]  ago a date that globalists like to launch new wars launch assassinations or
[01:14.660 --> 01:23.620]  launch new movements or revolutions you remember old Charlie Manson in 1969
[01:23.620 --> 01:28.300]  butchering Sharon Tate and cutting her baby out of her body thinking he would
[01:28.300 --> 01:33.980]  launch a race war we're gonna blame black people for doing Charlie Manson
[01:33.980 --> 01:40.820]  tried to launch a false flag Charlie Manson was involved in the MJ ultra
[01:40.820 --> 01:45.780]  playing control program that came out in court just like the unabomber Theodore
[01:45.780 --> 01:56.780]  Kaczynski worked in MK ultra for the CIA and it just goes on from there so I'm
[01:56.780 --> 02:02.260]  not saying this is a false flag I'm not saying this is a staged event I'm
[02:02.260 --> 02:05.900]  saying we need to pull back and investigate every part of this because
[02:05.900 --> 02:12.060]  there was a famous shooting more than 20 years ago in New Zealand that allowed
[02:12.060 --> 02:16.820]  them to confiscate all semi-auto and then all basically bolt action to where
[02:16.820 --> 02:22.580]  all you could have was single-shot shotguns and rifles with special licenses
[02:22.580 --> 02:28.540]  they had similar events take place in nearby Australia and have taken
[02:28.540 --> 02:34.220]  everything but the single-shot firearms their crime rate has only gone up since
[02:34.220 --> 02:39.380]  that point the real crocodile Dundee would not turn in his firearm so they
[02:39.380 --> 02:44.060]  killed him at his house a paramilitary UN funded SWAT team this is the history of
[02:44.060 --> 02:50.740]  this but let's pull back we've got 49 50 people dead the number keeps going up
[02:50.740 --> 02:55.820]  when you actually read the manifesto of the supposed shooter that we have posted
[02:55.820 --> 03:02.060]  on info wars.com and news wars.com you learn why the mainstream media is
[03:02.060 --> 03:06.580]  pulling this down on Facebook Twitter and YouTube because the guy praises
[03:06.580 --> 03:20.540]  communist China he praises all sorts of socialism and environmentalism and then
[03:20.540 --> 03:27.100]  he demonizes PewDiePie and Candace Owens by praising them saying oh I'm not
[03:27.100 --> 03:30.740]  even as radical as Candace Owens she calls for even more violence than I do
[03:30.740 --> 03:37.580]  when it's the opposite she calls for having no violence so I don't know all
[03:37.580 --> 03:41.060]  the angles of this shit but I'll tell you this it's very suspect that in the
[03:41.060 --> 03:45.980]  shooting video that we reviewed we're not posting at info wars.com it's been
[03:45.980 --> 03:49.540]  expunged off the internet but we've got a copy that's some blurred versions we're
[03:49.540 --> 03:52.780]  gonna air here coming up for TV viewers I'll describe them obviously for
[03:52.780 --> 03:59.540]  radio listeners out of the gates he's a weird leftist eco fascist in fact let
[03:59.540 --> 04:05.340]  me give you his words exactly New Zealand Moss terrorist described himself as an
[04:05.340 --> 04:13.020]  eco fascist who hated conservatism and admired communist China Paul Joseph
[04:13.020 --> 04:20.180]  Watson and it's got the quotes from the manifesto up on info wars.com and news
[04:20.180 --> 04:25.820]  wars.com now you'll undoubtedly see headlines today that Joan says no
[04:25.820 --> 04:31.620]  one died at the mosque or mosque the pearl none of that will be true of course
[04:31.620 --> 04:37.220]  they'll just say it and they'll never show you I'm simply questioning like I
[04:37.220 --> 04:40.260]  did Parkland was there a police standout because the student told us there
[04:40.260 --> 04:43.700]  wasn't turned out there was whatever the truth is we're gonna ferret it out we're
[04:43.700 --> 04:50.780]  gonna open the phones up exclusively to New Zealand callers we've got a raft of
[04:50.780 --> 04:55.060]  expert guests joining us as well today whatever you do spread the live link
[04:55.060 --> 05:01.140]  tell folks about that local station you're listening to well I've got some
[05:01.140 --> 05:04.260]  really good news for all the viewers and all the listeners this was gonna be a
[05:04.260 --> 05:07.420]  big loss because we couldn't get the deep-earth crystals anymore 20 year and
[05:07.420 --> 05:11.300]  a half fight but we have the original producer the original crystal source the
[05:11.300 --> 05:16.180]  best atomic iodide in the world X2 is back got it this deal just happened
[05:16.180 --> 05:19.660]  about a month ago we rushed it into production it's been bottled the
[05:19.660 --> 05:24.140]  labels are being put on today and that it's gonna be on an 18-wheeler right here
[05:24.140 --> 05:28.700]  to Austin from the plant in the Rockies and it's gonna be shipped out to you be
[05:28.700 --> 05:34.140]  sure and sign up for auto ship an additional 10% off the 25% off celebration
[05:34.140 --> 05:37.380]  of the fact that we got it back and we're relaunching it research the iodine
[05:37.380 --> 05:41.300]  conspiracy find out why it's so important find out what the globalists don't
[05:41.300 --> 05:45.620]  want you to have the good halogen you have the bad halogens at info wars
[05:45.620 --> 05:49.140]  store.com that's the umbrella site and for his life.com
[05:49.140 --> 05:54.380]  if you write the supplements and this is the King Daddy ladies and gentlemen it is
[05:54.380 --> 06:00.620]  X2 original now back at infowarstores.com
[06:05.620 --> 06:13.140]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:13.140 --> 06:21.700]  we've witnessed a mosque shooting yesterday that means today our time on
[06:21.700 --> 06:30.420]  March 15th 2019 that's killed at least 49 people white racist claims
[06:30.420 --> 06:38.100]  responsibility now isn't it sickening that this individual reportedly does
[06:38.100 --> 06:42.300]  something horrible like this and video tapes the whole thing and then later
[06:42.300 --> 06:49.500]  streams it out and then basically turns himself into the police and the media is
[06:49.500 --> 06:55.500]  white supremacist white man white man white man but when it's a Muslim running
[06:55.500 --> 06:59.300]  over hundreds of people with a truck including toddlers or blowing up a
[06:59.300 --> 07:03.460]  church or shooting people up they go oh this wasn't Islam even though they're
[07:03.460 --> 07:09.820]  yelling Allah Akbar that's my big frustration is that when radical out of
[07:09.820 --> 07:14.500]  control Islam destroys hundreds of churches in Egypt just a few years
[07:14.500 --> 07:19.540]  ago and crucifies practitioners upside down in the city streets it's cute it's
[07:19.540 --> 07:26.780]  funny CNN doesn't even report it they call it a good revolution but then this
[07:26.780 --> 07:30.220]  apparent monster and it looks like it's it's him doing it on the video I've
[07:30.220 --> 07:33.780]  reviewed it it's sickening executing these people the way ISIS goes into
[07:33.780 --> 07:39.340]  churches and does it the whole world is outraged and the West is evil and the
[07:39.340 --> 07:47.900]  West is bad and we need to be more tolerant of Islam so there's so many
[07:47.900 --> 07:52.540]  facets to this New Zealand has taken all the guns the last 20 years except single
[07:52.540 --> 07:57.380]  shot how to get all these full auto Australia's taking everything but single
[07:57.380 --> 08:03.780]  shot how was he able to carry all this out in two different mosques and finally
[08:03.780 --> 08:09.300]  one guy with a gun a good guy with a single shot shotgun ran the coward off
[08:09.300 --> 08:18.220]  good guy with a gun there's that facet and then there's him saying oh you know
[08:18.220 --> 08:22.700]  subscribe to PewDiePie which the media is trying to brand as a white
[08:22.700 --> 08:26.460]  supremacist so they can ban the biggest internet personality out there that's
[08:26.460 --> 08:30.260]  reaching young people there's a whole globalist concerted effort by Soros
[08:30.260 --> 08:34.220]  and others to ban PewDiePie and now this happens putty pies come out and said
[08:34.220 --> 08:37.620]  it's disgusting it's sickening has nothing to do with it and then he also
[08:37.620 --> 08:42.020]  says manifesto says well I like to kill people and murder people and I'm for
[08:42.020 --> 08:46.580]  violence but nobody's more violent nobody's more hardcore than my eyeball
[08:46.580 --> 08:54.300]  Candace Owens who's too radical for me it's sick satire the full manifesto
[08:54.300 --> 08:57.380]  which they're pulling off the internet they say oh don't give a murderer
[08:57.380 --> 09:00.700]  attention he's gonna get the attention they're gonna make him into the right
[09:00.700 --> 09:04.940]  wing white guy they want but we're going to show you where he worships
[09:04.940 --> 09:11.420]  communist China where he hates Christians where he hates conservatives and he's
[09:11.420 --> 09:15.940]  just sounds like your standard leftist devil worshiper Paul Joseph Watson has
[09:15.940 --> 09:22.780]  the big definitive story up on info wars.com and news wars.com that needs to
[09:22.780 --> 09:26.860]  get out there New Zealand Moss Terrorist described himself as an eco fascist who
[09:26.860 --> 09:31.220]  hated conservatism and admired communist China we're gonna go over all of it
[09:31.220 --> 09:35.140]  today and have a bunch of guests on and open the phones up specifically for
[09:35.140 --> 09:41.300]  people in New Zealand or in Australia because there's different conflicting
[09:41.300 --> 09:44.660]  reports be supposedly from Australia in New Zealand both countries are basically
[09:44.660 --> 09:48.580]  around the same they've taken the guns from the few massacres they've had blaming
[09:48.580 --> 09:53.780]  gun owners in general there was a good guy with a gun that began to stop it but
[09:53.780 --> 09:58.260]  here's the big elephant in the room I've asked Paul Watson to an article he's
[09:58.260 --> 10:01.460]  already churned out like three I think Daniels is gonna get it done I don't know
[10:01.460 --> 10:06.660]  what headline you go with it's so crazy but I was looking up the number thousands
[10:06.660 --> 10:11.340]  of Christian churches have been blown up in Africa and the Middle East and Asia
[10:11.340 --> 10:16.540]  including the Philippines thousands can we just play video just type in the
[10:16.540 --> 10:20.260]  YouTube they try to take it down because it shows what Islam is up to radical
[10:20.260 --> 10:29.060]  Islam type in ISIS takes over desecrates churches in Philippines there's
[10:29.060 --> 10:33.100]  dozens of videos and don't show them shooting people they're also executing
[10:33.100 --> 10:37.420]  them they go into the church on Easter what was it last year and shot like a
[10:37.420 --> 10:40.900]  hundred people I think 30 something died I mean that's what goes on it's just a
[10:40.900 --> 10:46.460]  footnote the news oh ISIS attacked the five or six churches on Easter in the
[10:46.460 --> 10:52.700]  Philippines and it's a blip in the newspaper and there's been hundreds I
[10:52.700 --> 11:00.620]  mean every day I see where there's an attack in Indonesia they've taken over
[11:00.620 --> 11:05.340]  whole islands and I lose hundreds of thousands of people on it and our own
[11:05.340 --> 11:12.500]  media says oh the the the Filipino leader he's too mean to Islam he should be
[11:12.500 --> 11:18.380]  nice to them so hundreds of churches were blown up during the Arab Spring that
[11:18.380 --> 11:22.220]  CNN said was so good that Obama funded and they went and blew up hundreds
[11:22.220 --> 11:29.780]  several hundred churches in fact I've got an Egyptian friend that we had on
[11:29.780 --> 11:33.980]  when I was out in Hawaii last year who's a pastor he's always wanting to come on
[11:33.980 --> 11:37.580]  I need to give you his name and number Daria we should get him on because he
[11:37.580 --> 11:42.220]  can talk about this but but he's an Egyptian Christian he can tell you what
[11:42.220 --> 11:47.460]  it's really like and we've had a bunch of the famous Egyptian journalist lady
[11:47.460 --> 11:51.060]  on forget her name we should get her on in the next few days I'm doubly I'll be
[11:51.060 --> 11:55.380]  doing special broadcast about this tomorrow but but the point is just say
[11:55.380 --> 12:02.380]  the guys a monster just say that this scumbag that reportedly did this and I
[12:02.380 --> 12:06.660]  don't see any evidence that he didn't because he videotaped it all himself
[12:06.660 --> 12:13.940]  Brenton Tarrant is a cowardly scumbag monster and you'll see Christians and
[12:13.940 --> 12:19.340]  conservatives and nationalists say that but every time there's a church shot up
[12:19.340 --> 12:23.940]  or Christians run over Muslims say like the two Muslims we have in Congress
[12:23.940 --> 12:29.940]  it's not our job Ilhan Omar I play the video it's not our job when somebody
[12:29.940 --> 12:34.060]  kills people in a car bombs the church we didn't do that why should we have to
[12:34.060 --> 12:41.380]  apologize why should we have to decry it even so I'll say that the backpack
[12:41.380 --> 12:44.980]  killer as they're calling him is a big backpacker around the world I'll say
[12:44.980 --> 12:48.620]  this guy was a crazy person I'll say this guy wanted to be famous I'll say
[12:48.620 --> 12:51.340]  this guy was a coward going in and finding a group he thought would be
[12:51.340 --> 12:58.180]  disarmed in a disarmed country but where are the Muslim groups decrying
[12:58.180 --> 13:06.220]  Islamic terror attacks on Christians and others you could hear a pin drop you
[13:06.220 --> 13:12.580]  could pull up all day just type type in the YouTube Isis blows up Christian
[13:12.580 --> 13:17.740]  church in Iraq Isis blows up Christian church in Syria Isis blows up
[13:17.740 --> 13:25.140]  Christian al Qaeda blows up church in Egypt and there's hours of churches
[13:25.140 --> 13:28.260]  with the they come in they machine gun people they make them stay in the church
[13:28.260 --> 13:34.620]  they roll in a shopping cart of plastic explosive and then they blow the whole
[13:34.620 --> 13:42.060]  church up and they stomp on images of Jesus and they piss all over Mary
[13:42.060 --> 13:47.580]  literally and they eat people's hearts and they put women into sex slavery and
[13:47.580 --> 13:52.740]  they do all this and it never even hits the news it's just a blurb that oh on
[13:52.740 --> 13:58.220]  Easter you watch Easter's coming up here in just a few weeks guaranteed on
[13:58.220 --> 14:05.260]  Easter that's how Muslims celebrate it radical criminal jihadis they will blow
[14:05.260 --> 14:11.100]  up churches all over Kenya all over southern Sudan all over Ethiopia all
[14:11.100 --> 14:16.700]  over Syria all over Iraq all over Egypt all over Pakistan anywhere that someone
[14:16.700 --> 14:21.100]  dare still have a little church or a Christian shrine from thousands of
[14:21.100 --> 14:25.540]  years ago and a few Christians show up boldly enough in Pakistan or ever to
[14:25.540 --> 14:32.340]  say we love you Jesus they'll be a bomb there or they'll all get machine-gunned
[14:33.060 --> 14:39.940]  and there won't be one word shed in condemnation by the establishment
[14:39.940 --> 14:46.100]  Islamic leaders because they have the house of Islam and everything outside
[14:46.100 --> 14:50.220]  the house of Islam is war and the Muslims that aren't radical will get
[14:50.220 --> 14:54.300]  killed if they ever speak out against radical Islam that's how this works
[14:54.300 --> 14:58.780]  England and the UK won't even take famous women given the death penalty that
[14:58.780 --> 15:03.180]  was reprieved because they're Christians and have been baptized won't even let
[15:03.180 --> 15:08.060]  people who have death sentences and fatal was out on them come as a refugees
[15:08.060 --> 15:14.580]  from persecution because it quote might upset the Muslims so that's where this
[15:14.580 --> 15:17.940]  stands whether it's Charlie Manson killing somebody or whether it's the
[15:17.940 --> 15:22.700]  scumbag Brenton Tarrant and the latest thing that happened yesterday in New
[15:22.700 --> 15:28.140]  Zealand that's today today the day starts over there these guys are the very
[15:28.140 --> 15:32.500]  sane evil people that want to go out and kill men women and children who are
[15:32.500 --> 15:35.940]  unarmed their cowards if he thought Islam was so bad he would have gone and
[15:35.940 --> 15:39.020]  joined the military and gone out and fought radical Islam instead he's
[15:39.020 --> 15:43.100]  another lunatic trying to trigger a race war and he admits that's what he wants
[15:43.100 --> 15:48.220]  is a global race war conflagration to depopulate the earth because there's
[15:48.220 --> 15:54.580]  too many people the exact thing that Charlie Manson said in 1969 it's the

[20:03.620 --> 20:27.540]  to the Alex Jones show live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex
[20:27.540 --> 20:36.980]  Jones and so every Palm Sunday every Easter particularly there are some
[20:36.980 --> 20:41.500]  cases hundreds of bombings always dozens of bombings from Pakistan to Egypt to
[20:41.500 --> 20:47.300]  Syria to Iraq to southern Sudan to Ethiopia to Kenya and there's a tax on
[20:47.300 --> 20:50.540]  shopping malls there's a tax everywhere and the Islamists come in and they say
[20:50.540 --> 20:54.740]  are you a Christian yes boom they blow your head off and if you're a TV viewer
[20:54.740 --> 21:00.540]  we're showing you footage of bombs going off and blowing up Christians who dare
[21:00.540 --> 21:11.660]  show up at their church on Christmas or on Palm Sunday every Christmas around
[21:11.660 --> 21:16.420]  the world from Indonesia to Europe there are trucks running over men women and
[21:16.420 --> 21:19.740]  children in the streets there are people screaming Allah Akbar and shooting
[21:19.740 --> 21:25.380]  individuals and it's always a tiny footnote even on Fox News or maybe an
[21:25.380 --> 21:30.620]  AP headline but it doesn't get top billing
[21:31.380 --> 21:35.180]  thousands and thousands and thousands of Christians killed each year by radical
[21:35.180 --> 21:39.380]  Islam hundreds of thousands of people killed total if you look at the Palm
[21:39.380 --> 21:46.620]  Sunday church bombing of just a year ago in Egypt killed 43 wounded dozens but
[21:46.620 --> 21:51.980]  it was a minor footnote compared to terror attack that was terrible in Christ
[21:51.980 --> 21:56.740]  Church New Zealand that's killed at least 49
[21:57.100 --> 22:00.780]  an individual who had left Australia to travel the world including North Korea
[22:00.780 --> 22:05.860]  and Pakistan and we've got his manifesto where he says he loves
[22:05.860 --> 22:11.180]  common is China hates conservatives hates Christians but the media is calling
[22:11.180 --> 22:16.540]  him a white Christian every time there's an Islamic attack they say oh it's not
[22:16.540 --> 22:23.780]  Islamic ISIS isn't even Islam Obama said so that's my issue I can decry this
[22:23.780 --> 22:28.340]  guy I think it's terrible what he did but he's not a Christian he's not a
[22:28.340 --> 22:33.420]  conservative he calls himself an eco fascist that thinks there's too many
[22:33.420 --> 22:37.740]  people you notice the media is fighting the controlled media to get his
[22:37.740 --> 22:40.940]  manifesto taken down they say oh don't give him attention well they're giving
[22:40.940 --> 22:45.100]  him lots of attention they want to project that he's a right-wing Christian
[22:45.100 --> 22:51.740]  show you and I and all of us can be blamed that's the big takeaway they want
[22:51.740 --> 22:55.180]  you to have well take away here is they're covering up what radical Islam
[22:55.180 --> 23:00.980]  does and you don't ever hear it's very rare that you see any type of Muslim
[23:00.980 --> 23:04.780]  groups or individuals when there's a mass killing by someone screaming all
[23:04.780 --> 23:08.340]  Akbar they say that's not me I'm not apologizing I didn't do that that's not
[23:08.340 --> 23:14.180]  Islam okay well then I'm not gonna take the blame for this guy I mean even if he
[23:14.180 --> 23:19.460]  was quote a Christian conservative I didn't do that but he hates Christians he
[23:19.460 --> 23:23.940]  hates conservatives it's in his manifesto and he wanted this attention
[23:23.940 --> 23:28.140]  it's very similar to the attack we saw in northern Europe was it five six years
[23:28.140 --> 23:34.220]  ago the guy said he was a nice Templar and it's gonna do all this it's it's too
[23:34.220 --> 23:37.220]  early to know all the details here but you notice this all streamed on Facebook
[23:37.220 --> 23:43.260]  Facebook's like a telephone I do not blame Facebook and they shouldn't get in
[23:43.260 --> 23:46.540]  trouble they took it down as soon as they knew it's like saying if you called
[23:46.540 --> 23:49.420]  up and threatened to kill somebody over a telephone is a telephone company to
[23:49.420 --> 23:55.460]  blame but notice with gab and Andrew Torba the guy two minutes before he goes
[23:55.460 --> 23:59.860]  into the synagogue and shoots the people that tragic event in Pittsburgh last
[23:59.860 --> 24:05.060]  year that all of conservative internet got blamed and the fact that he was
[24:05.060 --> 24:10.420]  allowed to post on gab he also posted on Facebook that it was gab's fault just
[24:10.420 --> 24:16.900]  absolutely ridiculous it's not Facebook's fault it's not YouTube's fault
[24:16.900 --> 24:21.100]  you know that's the headlines that oh YouTube Facebook and others you know
[24:21.100 --> 24:26.140]  they've got a big responsibility here they're in a bunch of trouble
[24:26.940 --> 24:34.020]  you're all guilty for what Brenton Tarrant did no he was in a country where
[24:34.020 --> 24:39.980]  only single-shot farms are legal he somehow had full auto play some of the
[24:39.980 --> 24:44.460]  audio coming up next segment we blurred out people actually getting killed I've
[24:44.460 --> 24:47.020]  already watched this one it's like it's hard to watch it again so viewer
[24:47.020 --> 24:53.780]  discretion advised you know we've blurred it out so here are the toll-free numbers
[24:53.780 --> 24:57.420]  to join us and then there's a number that's toll because some people can't
[24:57.420 --> 25:02.580]  dial from New Zealand on a 1-800 number I understand but however you can get
[25:02.580 --> 25:06.460]  through the phone line specifically if you're in New Zealand if you're in Christ
[25:06.460 --> 25:13.060]  Church New Zealand now a major Islamic hub in Greece they charged a bunch of
[25:13.060 --> 25:18.900]  people for putting a cross back up on the island of Lesbos the island of
[25:18.900 --> 25:24.580]  womanly love and seriously they did that they kind of named an island off
[25:24.580 --> 25:32.020]  Mexico similar name the island of women the Eastless Maharas Isla Maharas but
[25:32.020 --> 25:35.900]  they put the sign back up so they arrested them for hate because the
[25:35.900 --> 25:40.260]  Muslims can't even see across so we bring in an
[25:40.260 --> 25:43.660]  incompatible religion that doesn't once it gets to high enough numbers live
[25:43.660 --> 25:47.620]  and compatible with us that historically always attacks us and then we
[25:47.620 --> 25:52.740]  wonder when a screwball goes and does this it's terrible but they don't
[25:52.740 --> 25:56.260]  humanize the thousands of churches bombed and shot up every year from
[25:56.260 --> 26:01.540]  Indonesia to Germany they don't ever humanize the Christmas parties shot up
[26:01.540 --> 26:04.500]  in San Bernardino oh it's not Muslims even though they were screaming all
[26:04.500 --> 26:08.220]  Akbar and kicking over the Christmas trees and asking are you Christian are
[26:08.220 --> 26:17.420]  you Jew boom or that Muslims attacked the Kenyan situation and then again most
[26:17.420 --> 26:20.940]  Muslims don't want to kill people but the point is is that the radical ones are
[26:20.940 --> 26:29.180]  the ones that want control like a game so here's the toll-free number for folks
[26:29.180 --> 26:38.620]  to call in from New Zealand I believe you dialed 001-877-789-2539 but you
[26:38.620 --> 26:41.500]  live in New Zealand you know how to call the states we'll put you right to the
[26:41.500 --> 26:49.180]  front of the line we're only taking calls from New Zealand 001-877-789-2539
[26:49.180 --> 27:02.300]  or 001-512-646-1776 001-512-646-1776 and if you live in the nearby area and you
[27:02.300 --> 27:06.100]  want to go cover what's happening or be a correspondent we would love to see
[27:06.100 --> 27:08.940]  what you have to do I even want to start a system where we have some Skype
[27:08.940 --> 27:12.820]  numbers we put out on air some Skype handles and then we only give it out
[27:12.820 --> 27:16.700]  for folks you know to Colin who were on the ground there in New Zealand in fact
[27:16.700 --> 27:20.420]  I want to do that later today I want to give out a Skype handle that will only
[27:20.420 --> 27:25.420]  use obviously in times of emergency for people to call them live reportage so we
[27:25.420 --> 27:28.660]  can actually see what's happening now if you can't get in via the toll-free
[27:28.660 --> 27:44.020]  number it's 011 or 001 excuse me 001-512-646-1776 001-512-646-1776 those
[27:44.020 --> 27:48.540]  are the numbers for folks in New Zealand we have such a big audience in New
[27:48.540 --> 27:52.580]  Zealand in Australia it's huge but I would expect we're going to get some
[27:52.580 --> 27:56.460]  calls specifically from New Zealand let's open the phones up first for New
[27:56.460 --> 28:00.460]  Zealand but this guy was an Aussie anybody knowing they might know about
[28:00.460 --> 28:04.660]  these groups of communists he says he's involved in you see the parallels with
[28:04.660 --> 28:08.940]  Charles Manson wanting to cause a revolution wanting to cause a race
[28:08.940 --> 28:15.020]  war wanting to cause a civil war it's all in his manifesto and again I don't want
[28:15.020 --> 28:18.700]  to give him attention the media is going to give it total attention but
[28:18.700 --> 28:24.420]  misrepresent what he said his manifesto so it's important that we now give
[28:24.420 --> 28:30.020]  attention to who this little monster is he's a monster and when the radicals
[28:30.020 --> 28:34.660]  llamas is going to church and bombing or blow every every year in Syria they try
[28:34.660 --> 28:39.820]  to have Christmas very tolerant nice Islamic country they had to put the
[28:39.820 --> 28:42.380]  military out to guard the churches because the radical muslims want to blow
[28:42.380 --> 28:46.580]  that up speaking of that Syrian girl she lives in Australia her family was

[32:14.700 --> 32:19.740]  iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based
[32:19.740 --> 32:23.540]  iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block
[32:23.540 --> 32:27.260]  us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[32:27.260 --> 32:31.940]  nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the
[32:31.940 --> 32:36.420]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[32:36.420 --> 32:40.980]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemist scientists and others showed
[32:40.980 --> 32:45.100]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[32:45.100 --> 32:51.860]  iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bio available
[32:51.860 --> 32:55.220]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an

[34:35.380 --> 34:39.100]  you're the experts living in New Zealand or Australia I guess it's zero zero one
[34:39.100 --> 34:45.100]  then 512 646 1776 or zero zero one eight seven seven seven eight nine two five
[34:45.100 --> 34:49.820]  three nine some people won't need if you're on a internet phone obviously

[34:57.980 --> 35:00.900]  because we want to hear from you your take on this we're gonna go to our
[35:00.900 --> 35:05.460]  guest here in a moment here's my take away the media is gonna hype this to
[35:05.460 --> 35:09.180]  create major division and every time there's radical Islamic attacks on
[35:09.180 --> 35:12.980]  churches by the hundreds there's almost no coverage when the radical jihadis
[35:12.980 --> 35:16.100]  are being funded by the West there's no coverage of the sex slavery really any
[35:16.100 --> 35:22.540]  other also this guy says he's a communist that hates the conservatives and
[35:22.540 --> 35:25.700]  Christians that's in his manifesto the media is not saying that we have the
[35:25.700 --> 35:30.540]  article in in full wars dot com a man with a single shot shot gun drove the
[35:30.540 --> 35:34.580]  coward out of there so a good guy with a gun if I had a monster a Christian
[35:34.580 --> 35:38.940]  church or period you better have somebody arm there because these mass
[35:38.940 --> 35:42.580]  shooters the media hypes it up they instead of death by cop they just want
[35:42.580 --> 35:46.060]  to go kill a bunch of people and the more they hype it the more it happens I hate
[35:46.060 --> 35:48.960]  having to hype it but they're gonna misrepresent that he's a big
[35:48.960 --> 35:53.620]  conservative Christian so we have to show you who he really is so there's
[35:53.620 --> 35:58.300]  that angle there's also the helter skelter angle that 1969 Charlie Manson
[35:58.300 --> 36:02.620]  who's involved in the whole CIA cults just like Theodore Kassensky the
[36:02.620 --> 36:08.620]  unabomber that's declassified was an MK ultra he went and killed Sharon Tate
[36:08.620 --> 36:16.780]  now there's the blame on black people to cause a race war think about that and
[36:16.780 --> 36:24.700]  so that's what the scumbag Brenton Taren says he wants in his manifesto I've
[36:24.700 --> 36:29.860]  got a copy of the manifesto right here Paul Joseph Watson has written about it
[36:29.860 --> 36:36.940]  at info wars dot com where he hated conservatives New Zealand Moss terrorists
[36:36.940 --> 36:40.460]  described himself as an eco fascist who hated conservatism and admired
[36:40.460 --> 36:46.020]  communist China we're gonna go to Syrian girl from Australia via Skype in a

[38:10.980 --> 38:15.500]  like 4chan to see vile racist commentary just go to some of the far
[38:15.500 --> 38:19.980]  right websites in the US and look at the comments message boards bright mark
[38:19.980 --> 38:23.380]  get away punnett info wars many reprehensible comments from users on
[38:23.380 --> 38:26.900]  stories re terror attack hey how do we know it's not you Oliver Darcy like
[38:26.900 --> 38:30.540]  Jesse small it because back we did our own comments we used to track some of the
[38:30.540 --> 38:34.580]  IP addresses you'd have people saying racist things against whites and racist
[38:34.580 --> 38:38.900]  things against blacks and it was the same person most the time how do we know
[38:38.900 --> 38:42.420]  it into Jesse small it into much of you trolls at CNN that have been caught
[38:42.420 --> 38:46.340]  stages that before you want to say that try to shut things down to shut
[38:46.340 --> 38:52.460]  comments down you sniveling little monster alright Syrian girl joins us
[38:52.460 --> 38:57.380]  thank you so much for coming on the broadcast I know it's very early in the
[38:57.380 --> 39:01.780]  morning Australia time I don't want to get time zones wrong so what time is it
[39:01.780 --> 39:07.820]  Syrian girl Maram Susley always been a mispronounce your beautiful name so
[39:07.820 --> 39:11.300]  it's called a Syrian girl at partisan girl still on Twitter YouTube Syrian
[39:11.300 --> 39:17.860]  girl partisan what time is it in Australia actually Alex it's about
[39:17.860 --> 39:22.820]  only half an hour past midnight because I'm in the west coast of Australia which
[39:22.820 --> 39:26.860]  is like the Wild Wild West so it's an even a different time zone to the east
[39:26.860 --> 39:31.540]  coast but thank you for having me on I really appreciate always that you give
[39:31.540 --> 39:37.100]  me a platform and I respect you and your show and everything you've helped us
[39:37.100 --> 39:42.940]  show what's going on especially in Syria so I guess we should talk about this
[39:42.940 --> 39:47.620]  attack that happened not in Australia but New Zealand which is basically like
[39:47.620 --> 39:52.060]  Australia's Canada you know they're right next door to us we have very similar
[39:52.060 --> 39:57.220]  history culture etc etc and the guy that did this was Australian as well
[39:57.220 --> 40:03.100]  apparently he was going there for work but his manifesto is a garbled mess I
[40:03.100 --> 40:10.540]  mean in it he talks about Candice Owen being his greatest influencer I think he
[40:10.540 --> 40:16.620]  did that on purpose to take her down because she is a black woman and he
[40:16.620 --> 40:21.540]  in some parts of his manifesto could proclaim to be a white nationalist at
[40:21.540 --> 40:26.380]  the same time he talked about climate change you know not hating Muslims but
[40:26.380 --> 40:31.060]  still shooting up Muslims and he also as far as I know I haven't read the whole
[40:31.060 --> 40:35.940]  thing but he also said don't do what I'm doing so why are you doing it you know he
[40:35.940 --> 40:41.780]  said he wants to create basically a civil war he wants Muslims to retaliate and
[40:41.780 --> 40:47.740]  for there to be chaos in it and bloodshed because if you want to war you
[40:47.740 --> 40:55.980]  need soldiers you need armies and you need casualties and unfortunately I
[40:55.980 --> 41:04.700]  believe that things like this have been a direct consequence of foreign policy of
[41:04.700 --> 41:10.780]  you know since the beginning since the 1980s when Al Qaeda was created in order
[41:10.780 --> 41:18.100]  to shut down what was a secular regime in Afghanistan you know they started
[41:18.100 --> 41:21.460]  funding these terrorists and at that time you know these guys were portrayed
[41:21.460 --> 41:28.700]  as the heroes and then the same government brings refugees over to the
[41:28.700 --> 41:33.660]  United States or the West or Australia and they drum up Islamophobia while at
[41:33.660 --> 41:39.140]  the same time you know bringing in refugees and trying to crush and silence
[41:39.140 --> 41:43.620]  these very people that end up doing these shootings that might be against
[41:43.620 --> 41:47.700]  immigration and then so bottom line Syrian girl you're saying they're trying to
[41:47.700 --> 41:51.940]  create a clash of civilizations and we come back we'll talk about that PNAC
[41:51.940 --> 41:55.700]  neocon plan that you're an expert on but just pulling back from this you make
[41:55.700 --> 41:59.340]  great points he blames PewDiePie he blames Candace Owens he says he's doing it
[41:59.340 --> 42:02.660]  for them Candace Owens calls for non-violence he says she's the most
[42:02.660 --> 42:07.380]  ultimately violent person on earth it's like he's trying to frame these people
[42:07.380 --> 42:15.140]  yeah absolutely I completely agree I mean if he is lying about that then how
[42:15.140 --> 42:19.020]  can we take anything that's written in the manifesto seriously but you know
[42:19.020 --> 42:23.380]  what the interesting thing is that Al Qaeda did vow revenge for the Christ
[42:23.380 --> 42:31.260]  Church attack just on social media but they promised to kill more Syrians as a
[42:31.260 --> 42:36.700]  consequence of that because they're currently in Idlib in Syria pulled up
[42:36.700 --> 42:43.260]  there and unfortunately the last time that Syria tried to attack Idlib the
[42:43.260 --> 42:48.180]  US under Nikki Haley actually threatened well you are one of the top experts on
[42:48.180 --> 42:51.060]  this we come back we'll talk about it we've also got callers from New Zealand
[42:51.060 --> 42:54.980]  and Australia stay with us the Syrian girl I'm Alex Jones you're not gonna
[42:54.980 --> 42:59.180]  get live coverage like this anywhere else please spread the live links you
[42:59.180 --> 43:03.380]  know the worst part about getting old I'm still strong 45 is that I won't be
[43:03.380 --> 43:07.060]  there for my children someday that's why I didn't make them strong now now I can
[43:07.060 --> 43:11.700]  be there for my children now I can make them strong now I can instruct them now

[47:01.300 --> 47:15.700]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:15.700 --> 47:26.220]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:26.220 --> 47:32.380]  our arms sushi aka Syrian girl she's been all over international television you
[47:32.380 --> 47:37.860]  name it her family was at the top of the ruling party there decades ago thrown
[47:37.860 --> 47:42.100]  out by Assad she's no fan of Assad but she's given the most piercing on target
[47:42.100 --> 47:46.900]  analysis of the fake chemical attacks now all confirmed the white helmets
[47:46.900 --> 47:50.780]  working with ISIS and with criminal elements of our own government now the
[47:50.780 --> 47:57.020]  attempts to block Trump from pulling out she's been amazing we do have Cherie in
[47:57.020 --> 48:01.620]  New Zealand who I'm gonna go to her just a few minutes and Alex is in Wyoming but
[48:01.620 --> 48:06.260]  he's from Australia I know it's 5 a.m. there you know almost 1 a.m. in
[48:06.260 --> 48:09.460]  Australia I believe they got like five different time zones that's such a big
[48:09.460 --> 48:13.900]  continent and as she described it's New Zealand's an island north of it but it
[48:13.900 --> 48:17.820]  is like they're Canada and so the toll-free number to join us we've given
[48:17.820 --> 48:22.540]  that out we'll give it out again in the next hour we're gonna go to Cherie and
[48:22.540 --> 48:27.780]  Alex here in a moment but recapping will play some of these clips him saying
[48:27.780 --> 48:32.540]  okay go subscribe to PewDiePie or man I love Candace Owens but she's so radical
[48:32.540 --> 48:36.540]  and her calls for violence are so more serious than I am it's all very
[48:36.540 --> 48:41.460]  sarcastic very sick I haven't read the whole manifesto but he sounds like an
[48:41.460 --> 48:48.060]  anti-falunatic you're a smart cookie Syrian girl what do you think well he
[48:48.060 --> 48:52.860]  describes himself as like a centrist actually picking out ideas from both
[48:52.860 --> 48:59.300]  sides and actually he played lots of kind of comedic music but I think that
[48:59.300 --> 49:03.300]  it's not just about this guy because he's a product of really something much
[49:03.300 --> 49:07.220]  bigger than him is a product of the situation that's been created by
[49:07.220 --> 49:11.820]  governments which is why I have to bring this back to the hypocrisy of governments
[49:11.820 --> 49:16.500]  who have been saying all these you know lovely words sympathy for Muslims and
[49:16.500 --> 49:19.820]  they're pretending to care but the same time they're bombing Muslims in the
[49:19.820 --> 49:23.540]  Middle East and they're supporting ISIS and al-Qaeda that have been killing
[49:23.540 --> 49:28.060]  Muslims in the Middle East and you know they're tweeting about relishing the
[49:28.060 --> 49:33.620]  death the the the stabbing of Gaddafi in the street there they're relishing in
[49:33.620 --> 49:38.660]  barbarism and yet they censor channels like yours you know channels I've been
[49:38.660 --> 49:44.300]  trying to expose this and I'm coming at this as both a nationalist and a Muslim
[49:44.300 --> 49:48.740]  and I'm from a country that suffered perhaps more terrorism than any country
[49:48.740 --> 49:53.620]  in the world and and many of the people there were both Muslim and Christian that
[49:53.620 --> 49:57.140]  suffered from it but it seems that they don't really matter because they're not
[49:57.140 --> 50:02.580]  in the West but you know that's that brings me to the point that at the end
[50:02.580 --> 50:07.500]  of the day who's who's suffering this cycle it's all innocent people and al-Qaeda
[50:07.500 --> 50:12.140]  vowed revenge on on Syrians because that's where they are right now that's
[50:12.140 --> 50:18.180]  their headquarters and unfortunately Trump has been pushed into this policy of
[50:18.180 --> 50:22.060]  not getting out of Syria that was something that he promised to do but
[50:22.060 --> 50:26.940]  now the US is giving five million dollars to the white helmets a group that
[50:26.940 --> 50:33.540]  is linked to al-Qaeda and one of its members actually happens to be someone
[50:33.540 --> 50:40.580]  who the UK took the citizenship away from because of his ties to al-Qaeda he
[50:40.580 --> 50:44.580]  is actually let's be clear it's the oldest trick in the book it's the oldest
[50:44.580 --> 50:48.740]  trick in the book to pose as a somebody in the Red Cross but really you the
[50:48.740 --> 50:52.380]  military to poses an ambulance as you're shipping munitions across enemy lines
[50:52.380 --> 50:56.620]  so we understand that we'll have you back up soon to get into all the geopolitical
[50:56.620 --> 50:59.620]  systems it's been too long you should come on at least every month and I know
[50:59.620 --> 51:02.980]  you do come on our other shows but but pulling back I want to go to some calls
[51:02.980 --> 51:08.180]  from Sharia New Zealand who's holding in Alex from Australia and you'll ride
[51:08.180 --> 51:12.660]  shotgun with us and give your analysis it's just that I can't help but think
[51:12.660 --> 51:16.980]  this really smells weird and I don't know exactly what's amiss but it is the
[51:16.980 --> 51:20.980]  Ides of March it is the Ides of March when this happened that was yesterday
[51:20.980 --> 51:25.300]  there it's it's here today I said look for something big on the Ides of March
[51:25.300 --> 51:30.860]  want your take on that and and also semi-autos and autos are illegal in New
[51:30.860 --> 51:34.420]  Zealand so how did he get those he's from another country how did he get them
[51:34.420 --> 51:38.340]  they have strict gun control there's explosive devices in the truck by the
[51:38.340 --> 51:42.060]  way it's all rigged with explosives exactly so how did he get all this
[51:42.060 --> 51:45.140]  military equipment that this proves gun controls a fraud and then a guy with a
[51:45.140 --> 51:51.140]  single-shot shotgun is the guy that drove this coward away they have gun laws
[51:51.140 --> 51:55.500]  in New Zealand and Australia like really extreme gun laws so obviously if
[51:55.500 --> 51:58.780]  you're a criminal and you want to get a gun you're gonna get a gun it's
[51:58.780 --> 52:04.420]  completely ridiculous to even talk about gun laws I mean Syria has gun laws you
[52:04.420 --> 52:10.340]  know I think that that that's question is mute I did want to say that with the
[52:10.340 --> 52:14.580]  US foreign policies it's also that there's backing these Marxist Kurdish
[52:14.580 --> 52:19.740]  militias that are ethnically cleansing as Syrian Christians and you know this
[52:19.740 --> 52:24.020]  this maybe this was part of a plan because why the Ides of March you know
[52:24.020 --> 52:28.820]  what what's possible next step is going to happen is there gonna be a bigger
[52:28.820 --> 52:35.700]  crackdown on censorship this guy either he's a useful idiot or he's a madman
[52:35.700 --> 52:40.860]  but obviously they're going to exploit what he's doing to to crack down and
[52:40.860 --> 52:45.340]  censor nationalists who really do want to have a conversation about the foreign
[52:45.340 --> 52:50.380]  policy and mass migration and I'm saying that as an immigrant so like this
[52:50.380 --> 52:54.700]  conversation needs to be had has to have you had with Muslims as well you know
[52:54.700 --> 52:58.060]  we need to be open about it and not suppressing it because what's gonna
[52:58.060 --> 53:02.300]  happen it's gonna blow up and cause these maniacs from both sides to start
[53:02.300 --> 53:05.580]  killing each other and you know everyone's gonna get caught in the
[53:05.580 --> 53:10.180]  crossfire well I couldn't say it any better and I think you just brought in
[53:10.180 --> 53:14.220]  the missing element the last 53 minutes I thought I'd covered the waterfront
[53:14.220 --> 53:19.260]  they're openly blaming Facebook and YouTube and Twitter for clips of the
[53:19.260 --> 53:23.060]  video he streamed on Facebook being grabbed it's been taken down everywhere
[53:23.060 --> 53:26.180]  they're nothing but communication systems it's like saying get rid of a car
[53:26.180 --> 53:30.060]  because somebody might use a car illegally or get rid of a butcher knife
[53:30.060 --> 53:33.700]  well England's trying to have licenses for knives now and many stores won't
[53:33.700 --> 53:39.180]  sell steak knives anymore it's like putting football helmets on all our
[53:39.180 --> 53:43.260]  heads because we might fall and hit our heads the nanny state is here and so
[53:43.260 --> 53:46.660]  they're just like they blame gab for somebody saying I'm gonna go in and you
[53:46.660 --> 53:51.020]  know do something minutes before he did now they're blaming these big tech
[53:51.020 --> 53:56.100]  companies who again we have section 230 they're protected it's a communications
[53:56.100 --> 54:00.980]  forum you don't shut down the town square because homeless are you know
[54:00.980 --> 54:04.620]  throwing up on it at night and there's somebody got shot there everybody knows
[54:04.620 --> 54:08.300]  town squares have violence at 3 a.m. sometimes you don't blame the town
[54:08.300 --> 54:14.020]  square and so blaming these supposedly free open spaces that we have what I
[54:14.020 --> 54:17.500]  call free squares you know doing something like that it's just a science
[54:17.500 --> 54:22.660]  like saying somebody use their eyes to point a gun so let's gouge everybody's
[54:22.660 --> 54:28.500]  eyeballs out absolutely and there's a double standard I mean they choose what
[54:28.500 --> 54:34.340]  to censor and what not to censor I mean Time Magazine won an award for filming a
[54:34.340 --> 54:40.300]  beheading of a Syrian soldier but when the CIA vetted these guys that turned
[54:40.300 --> 54:44.780]  out to be not so moderate and beheaded a 12-year-old boy his face in that beheading
[54:44.780 --> 54:49.980]  video was censored at the same time you know like in Abu Ghraib all the videos
[54:49.980 --> 54:55.380]  of that torture was on Gaddafi's stabbing that was shown you know so they're
[54:55.380 --> 55:00.020]  very selective I showed the minivan getting blown up from WikiLeaks after
[55:00.020 --> 55:03.260]  everybody else had shown it and my page got taken down great point Syrian girl
[55:03.260 --> 55:08.140]  let's go to Cherie in New Zealand our first caller then to Alex from Australia
[55:08.140 --> 55:11.140]  Cherie thanks for calling thanks for holding what's your take on this
[55:11.140 --> 55:18.540]  tragedy oh hi Alex I'm a huge fan I'm calling from New Zealand well the whole
[55:18.540 --> 55:25.220]  thing's a bit surreal really the reason why I want to call is the timing of it's
[55:25.220 --> 55:33.020]  really interesting we've just had a huge me so here in New Zealand and it's all
[55:33.020 --> 55:37.900]  happened down in Christchurch with the top immunisation rates in the country
[55:37.900 --> 55:42.820]  and this huge measles outbreak and the big push get everyone to have these the
[55:42.820 --> 55:50.820]  MMR shot mainly middle-aged people and and then this happens and you know
[55:50.820 --> 55:57.340]  there's something weird about it going to something very very strange about it
[55:57.340 --> 56:05.460]  all the timing yeah can you hear me oh yes ma'am I'm just listening to you
[56:05.460 --> 56:10.660]  because you didn't how far away do you live from Christchurch I'm in the
[56:10.660 --> 56:14.660]  North I'm in the North Island but my sister-in-law is actually down in the
[56:14.660 --> 56:19.580]  South Island but she's actually in Christchurch right now so she I can get
[56:19.580 --> 56:26.380]  more information from her today and she she was in lockdown yesterday I haven't
[56:26.380 --> 56:29.580]  really talked to her over the phone but I'm sure that I'll find out more
[56:29.580 --> 56:35.460]  information about it today but she watched the whole video screened I don't
[56:35.460 --> 56:39.740]  think she watched it live but somehow she managed to watch the video the whole
[56:39.740 --> 56:42.900]  thing because I just was talking to her on the messenger and I said that she
[56:42.900 --> 56:48.180]  watched the whole thing she did yes so I was like okay but you know things like
[56:48.180 --> 56:56.060]  this don't happen here you know like there's not even a real racial tone
[56:56.060 --> 57:03.100]  between the Muslims and you know New Zealanders although where I do I still
[57:03.100 --> 57:10.300]  live in Hamilton which is in the Waikato and there was a mosque down the road
[57:10.300 --> 57:13.460]  that got torched a couple of times but that's maybe here nor there really I
[57:13.460 --> 57:19.100]  mean that was a while ago yeah so it's just really bizarre but I just find it
[57:19.100 --> 57:22.620]  really bizarre how it happens so all of a sudden the whole country is talking about this
[57:22.620 --> 57:27.540]  measles measles yeah panic panic that's right got to take the vaccines you stay
[57:27.540 --> 57:30.660]  there I want to come back in 60 seconds with you answering girl and then Alex
[57:30.660 --> 57:34.580]  from Australia I want to ask how do you get all these guns I mean you have very

[01:00:06.980 --> 01:00:11.980]  lines of the info war
[01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:49.100]  remember that's subscribe to PewDiePie remember that's subscribe to PewDiePie
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:06.020]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen broadcasting worldwide Syrian girl
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.700]  joins us from Australia Cherie is calling in from the north island of New
[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:15.900]  Zealand there's two islands there off the coast of Australia we've got alex who's
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.780]  in Wyoming right now but from Australia gonna get his take on this gonna take
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:25.780]  more calls I've got my team going through this individuals manifesto that I
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:29.860]  have here in front of me and he clearly says everything I'm doing in this
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:35.940]  manifesto is to cause a civil war is to get the left to go after the guys
[01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:42.140]  to start a civil war so we're going to walk through this whole thing that's
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.740]  why he's trying to get PewDiePie taken off the air with his you know hundred
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:50.820]  billion views or whatever it is and a hundred million subscribers to cause a
[01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:55.180]  rebellion something that Charles Manson wanted originally we're gonna look at
[01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:58.420]  this very closely because I've been seeing Charles Manson since I woke up
[01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:02.380]  this morning at 6 a.m. it turns out that's exactly what this is is a replay of
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:07.620]  that Cherie your take on that situation and this guy wanted to cause a civil
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:14.620]  war and then separately how he had these fully autos and explosives in the
[01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:18.940]  vehicle because correct me if I'm wrong don't you have a license in New Zealand
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:24.820]  and Australia just even have a single shot firearm on your farm yes that's
[01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:32.740]  right in New Zealand you have to have a firearm license and I think the the biggest
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:36.380]  what is it I'm talking to my husband he's telling me the information what is it
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:52.620]  what's it again he had an AR-15 but apparently this magazine that he had was illegal here so I mean he could have got that from you know we have gangs in New Zealand so it's probably not
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:03:00.460]  maybe here nor there I mean although I find it hard to see how he could get it
[01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:06.220]  from the gangs because if he is a what do they call him a white supremacist I mean
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:10.460]  we do have skinheads gangs down in Christchurch that's kind of well known but
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:15.500]  to get it from the other gangs they probably would be in rivalry yeah I don't
[01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:21.780]  know I don't know if he's on drugs it's all of it it's all of it weird right
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:27.420]  now but yes the gun laws are illegal well Shari as this all develops is this
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:31.220]  all develops and unfolds promise that you or your sister your husband or whoever
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:35.260]  can will call in let me give the number out tomorrow Sunday through next week
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:39.140]  so we can get actual real people to give us their take anything else you'd like
[01:03:39.140 --> 01:03:45.420]  to add Shari? I would like to add yeah because it's quite hard with our news network here we are very
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:52.340]  safe in here as well it's very interesting because I was watching I was not able to get my TV set so I
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:57.580]  had to watch it through CNN which I never watched CNN and the link between old
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:03.420]  New Zealand news and CNN was almost instant that's how they link so you
[01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:09.140]  know we probably won't get the truth here but I'm gonna talk to my sister-in-law
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:13.980]  and see what more I can find out maybe before you guys back. Fantastic God bless
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:18.980]  be safe Shari really really sad that that as Syrian girl said they put radical
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:23.180]  Muslims in charge then they let them attack regular Muslims who who allow
[01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.580]  Christians live in peace and attack their churches and all the rest of it and
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.940]  then they bring in folks and have a class of civilization we're gonna come back in
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:34.900]  60 seconds they get sure girls take on where she thinks all this is going then

[01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:46.860]  get her take on that as well have her on the next few days as things unfold the
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:50.820]  number to join us if you're in New Zealand or Australia is country code and
[01:06:50.820 --> 01:07:03.380]  then 512-646-1776 or again 011 or 001-877-789-2539 that's 877-789-2539
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:06.460]  some of you can't use the toll-free numbers we give you our regular number
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:14.380]  512-646-1776 I want to go down to Alex who's Australian visiting Wyoming to
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:17.700]  give us his take and then Syrian girls take what do you think about this
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:21.380]  situation how do you get the guns why is he saying he's a leftist and a
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.100]  conservative that hates conservatives but loves China why is all this coming
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.740]  right now why is he demonizing PewDiePie and the Internet what do you
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:34.740]  think's going on all very good questions Alex I just want to start off by saying
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.220]  my thoughts and prayers go out to the people of Crosschurch I was there two
[01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.660]  years ago and the city is still recovering from those horrific earthquakes
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:46.300]  they had in 2011 was killed near on a hundred people just an interesting fact
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:50.100]  I'd like to bring up is the fact that he described himself as an eco-fascist
[01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:55.180]  however on the day of his attack there was mass climate protests going on where
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:59.380]  you have all the students walking out of the current here across America today
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:02.980]  but it was yesterday for Australia and New Zealand so kind of thinking if you
[01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:06.340]  are so into climate change and preserving it why would you hijack the
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:16.780]  news coverage of us that's a good question yeah very interesting let's get
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.820]  sure you girls take on that Syrian girl what do you think about the point he
[01:08:19.820 --> 01:08:23.580]  just made I just think that a lot of what he said was nonsensical and
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:29.860]  illogical and sometimes contradictory you know I think that he was trolling for
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:34.180]  at least some of his manifesto I mean he threw a line out there about the white
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:38.740]  race and maintaining the white race but Muslims are not a race and not all
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:45.820]  immigrants are Muslim and some Muslims are white and some Christians are brown
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:51.460]  or black so it doesn't really make any if you if it was someone who actually was
[01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:57.340]  into what he was saying he would have probably thought more about it so I
[01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:03.340]  think it maybe he wasn't eco-fascist but I don't think we can trust anything that
[01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:09.540]  he says in his manifesto the whole thing reeks of a scyop I mean whether he's a
[01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:14.780]  crazy person trying to do a scyop or whether others are helping him I want
[01:09:14.780 --> 01:09:19.380]  to know where he got the firearms what do you think Alex well it's very hard to
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:22.900]  mature firearms in both Australia and New Zealand and there's no way he'd be able
[01:09:22.900 --> 01:09:28.020]  to bring guns from Australia to New Zealand for the attachments and extended
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:32.260]  magazines he got are illegal so he obviously you know criminals are going
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:36.900]  to get the hands on guns no matter what sort of gun control policy the people
[01:09:36.900 --> 01:09:42.380]  try to instill well one thing for sure Alex we've got front row seats to what's
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:46.420]  about to come down with this and that means internet censorship that means
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.900]  blaming platforms he was able to speak on again that's like blaming somebody
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:53.380]  using a telephone or writing a letter and they've really made their bed in big
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:57.300]  tech blaming gab and info wars and others to where they're now getting blamed
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:03.020]  which just makes absolutely no sense but we'll we'll discover more as this
[01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.260]  unfolds I wonder if we're gonna see Islamic counterattacks radical Islamic
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:11.940]  counterattacks from this thank you so much Alex what do you think Syrian girl
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:18.100]  I think anyone that's seen the video would be disgusted and enraged and this
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:23.100]  was 100% an act of terrorism it's important to say this I mean he may have
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:27.620]  had a mental illness but a lot of terrorists probably have mental illness
[01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:32.380]  as well and it was politically motivated even though his politics was
[01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:36.980]  completely muddled up and one of the things he did want was to create a civil
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:43.940]  war I think probably there will be tit for tat but then again I think that that
[01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:49.020]  tit for tat will come from groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda and already al-Qaeda
[01:10:49.020 --> 01:10:53.860]  said that they were going to take vengeance because of this shooter but on
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.780]  on Syrians I mean there was a post on social media about it I'll send you the
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:02.860]  link to it but perhaps they'll there'll be something else and they'll probably
[01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:08.260]  use that to for some kind of geopolitical interest somewhere down
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:13.820]  along the line because at the end of the day they use this kind of stuff either
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:19.500]  to create chaos in the Middle East by funding terrorism or create chaos in
[01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:24.060]  Europe and cracking down and censoring them this is all really about control and
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:28.980]  we're in this cycle this is like a cyclone and we're losing the reins
[01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:33.900]  here in the world when it comes to this war well very well said Syrian girl God
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.380]  bless you and your great work that you're doing it's again at partisan girl on
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:42.780]  Twitter YouTube Syrian girl partisan thank you so much and please join us
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.740]  again on the Sunday broadcast thank you 4 to 6 p.m. and I'll probably do a
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.300]  special report tomorrow thank you it's just it's just terrible when you wake
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:54.940]  up in the morning on the other side of the planet a crazy monster has
[01:11:54.940 --> 01:12:01.620]  executed 49 people and injured a whole bunch of others and then I've had a team
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:07.540]  of several people will have this by the bottom of the hour but I'm gonna do this
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:12.540]  at the start of the next hour because really we were doesn't join us to 130
[01:12:12.540 --> 01:12:18.220]  so I'll have one o'clock that's in 45 minutes or so 47 minutes from now I'll
[01:12:18.220 --> 01:12:23.940]  be able to go through as manifesto then and then maybe at that time Matt Bracken
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:27.060]  Stewart Rhodes can pop back in they're about to join us and give their take on
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:31.100]  it but I've already during the breaks gone in and looked at the quotes and he
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:36.220]  says repeatedly I'm gonna list conservative icons to get liberals to
[01:12:36.220 --> 01:12:42.100]  attack them I'm then going to try to get the left to take guns to cause a
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:47.500]  civil war and I'm not just saying this because I want to be able to ideologically
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:53.380]  blame the left this is just a small it squared like the intelligence level was
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:13:00.820]  way more advanced because this isn't clown stuff in your classic low IQ this
[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:09.020]  is done very triangulated to cause major in-fighting and he admits it and it's
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:14.660]  done to create a clash of civilizations and it's also meant to manipulate
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:17.940]  mentally ill people it's written perfectly for mentally ill on all
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:26.140]  different sides to go into this call to arms insanity this is exactly what the
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.740]  globalist need is radical Muslims spread it across the world with radical
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.620]  counter-Muslims who will then have this class of civilizations I believe he had
[01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:41.100]  help you read the cover of the great replacement towards a new society we
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:45.100]  march ever forwards the overall is a communist cosmology but it's anti-imperialism
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:50.340]  with a picture of George Washington workers rights protection of heritage
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:53.700]  and culture that's to suck everybody in ethnic autonomy it's to get all the
[01:13:53.700 --> 01:13:56.740]  different groups fall law and order that's why you go in and shoot a bunch of
[01:13:56.740 --> 01:14:00.980]  innocent people addiction-free community was responsible markets that means
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:06.580]  controlled markets and environmentalism that's the global government so this guy
[01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:12.380]  is uber super bad news that an old Sun symbol old swastika symbol there the
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:18.900]  march ever forwards that is a socialist communist term marks and angles so we
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:22.260]  get Matt Bracken's take on that I'm gonna break down his manifesto next hour
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.620]  it is disgusting and it's designed to cause a civil war just like Charlie
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:31.740]  Manson wanted before we go to break people of sales and we had the biggest
[01:14:31.740 --> 01:14:35.060]  sales in our history during Christmas to sell out of everything so we wouldn't

[01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.540]  points a few segments ago even the Daily Mail has journalists and reporters
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:57.860]  saying that this thing is a trap to set up reporters so they find every group
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:01.620]  and every organization they want to blame to get everybody fighting with
[01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:07.780]  each other which is exactly what he says he wants to do but the manifesto
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:12.500]  itself is a trap in itself laid for journals searching for the meaning
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:16.460]  behind the horrific crime the truth is there and valuable clues the shooter's
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:23.820]  radicalization but it's buried beneath a great deal of for lack better word
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:34.140]  s posting well as you can see if you're a TV viewer we've already listed here
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:37.140]  where he wants civil war where he's explaining it all we're gonna get to
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:40.380]  this next hour we're gonna go to Matt Brackett's gonna write shotgun with
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:44.460]  myself and Stuart Rhodes for the rest of the hour and we're going to him in a
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:49.300]  moment we have another caller though Paul in New Zealand located a half mile
[01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:56.540]  away from the attack in Christchurch so you live in Christchurch Paul thank you
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.820]  for joining us please give us your take on this in our heart and prayers go out
[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:05.500]  to all those that were a killed or injured hi Alex it was a sad day for
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:09.180]  New Zealand was sad day for Christchurch I was about half a mile away from the
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:14.780]  tech I was at a church dinner and along church lunch and then we heard that there
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:18.940]  was a shooting so we thought oh we better head home and when we were driving
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:23.260]  down the road not far from the church we we actually went past where he was
[01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:27.140]  run off the road the police car rammed and rammed the car off the road it was
[01:22:27.140 --> 01:22:30.580]  up on the footpath and so we're there just a few minutes after the rest of the
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:36.060]  guy we then thought I would better get home and get my granddaughter out of
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:40.020]  school because we heard there was multiple shootings around the city and so
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.900]  we got to the school and picked up my granddaughter and then the school it
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:46.660]  when we got home everything was locked down so so a city of half a million
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:51.100]  people was badly completely locked down for a couple of hours so no schools were
[01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:55.660]  open it was quite quite dramatic so we didn't really know what was going on we
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:58.500]  didn't know how many shooters were in the city they were running through Hagby
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:04.100]  Park you know a big park in the center of the city and and so then one of my
[01:23:04.100 --> 01:23:08.940]  friends sent the video through to my son he downloaded off the internet and we
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:12.980]  watched we watched it was almost like watching one of the kids shoot up games
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:18.660]  on it almost looked exactly like that you know it was quite amazing so one thing
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:25.660]  that I used to be a land I'm a landlord and I had actually rented out my flat to
[01:23:25.660 --> 01:23:29.820]  a Muslim couple a few years ago and they went to the mosque there and they
[01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:33.980]  said that the mosque trod was tried to be radicalized a few years ago but the
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:38.500]  Muslim moderate Muslims stood up to the radicalization and put it down in that
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:44.020]  particular mosque so they were you know pretty decent people there a neighbor
[01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:47.620]  who lived next to the mosque was saying that they're really good people they
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:51.100]  got a good relationship with them they're very friendly and so it was really
[01:23:51.100 --> 01:23:55.580]  sad that they're really good people that were actually heard
[01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:02.940]  yeah other gun laws in New Zealand I'm a gun owner and it's a very strict
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:07.060]  vetting I had to go through a two hour interview to renew my gun license and
[01:24:07.060 --> 01:24:10.740]  interview all the family they want to know what your mental health is and so
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:14.820]  it's very strict so they licensed the person not the gun but a person who has
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:19.020]  a license can buy a semi-automatic gun but I think they're probably gonna come
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.980]  after that so you automatically after this because they use that in Australia
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:26.420]  that would ask a thing to actually go after the guns to some of the people but
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:29.860]  you're very cannot use a gun in New Zealand for self-defense there's
[01:24:29.860 --> 01:24:38.260]  very strict laws about that wow New Zealand even for farmers and people to
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:41.260]  get single shots they didn't get a special license so how could he be from
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:46.580]  Australia and a globe trotter they called him the backpacker to do well
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:51.900]  I read his manifesto and he and he said that he chose Christchurch specifically
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:57.060]  because it was a very peaceful place and it's so nowhere in the world would be
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:01.100]  safe so he's not going to divide anybody in Christchurch because everyone gets on
[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:05.020]  really well together there's no racial tension here or anything in very safe
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:07.900]  city it's one of the I think New Zealand's one of the best places to live in
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:11.460]  the world I think it rates the map in the world things but he said he actually
[01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:16.900]  chose it specifically to make a point that nowhere in the world was safe which
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:22.340]  was one of the points that he made unbelievable well please let us get your
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:27.260]  number so we can call you back if things develop or unfold but do you just think
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:30.700]  total mental illness with this guy or do you think somebody might be behind it
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:33.700]  with the way he writes this manifesto to make everybody fight with each other
[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:38.780]  and how he was able to get these I think he targeted other places around the
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.420]  world I think you know I don't think he was targeting New Zealand I think he was
[01:25:41.420 --> 01:25:45.060]  making a statement to actually sort of worldwide statement you know and just
[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:48.820]  for the very fact that he chose Christchurch has been a peaceful what a
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:52.780]  horrible demonic person just to pick a peaceful place and then randomly pick
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:56.860]  people to kill just to make a point that's what ISIS does you know and he
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.900]  was so you know when I watched the video it was just so horrific you know just
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:03.620]  people were just piled in corners and he just kept shooting into them you know
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:08.620]  like no concern no empathy at all it was just disgusting
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:13.900]  so shocked you know sort of all sort of but still shaken it's quite shaken by it
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.340]  but so it's you know for a whole city to be locked down you know it's a half a
[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:20.460]  million city half a million people city I've heard about Christchurch I'll be
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:25.060]  quite honest with you if I ever decided to bug out and quit the elites moving
[01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.980]  there I'd actually looked at Christchurch as a place to move this is
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.500]  just insane well it was actually it's actually called the guys we've won
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:35.980]  multiple awards around the world no I know I search engine years ago best
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:39.980]  places in New Zealand and Christchurch is at the top of the list and it's all
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:42.580]  it's all been rebuilt with all your beautiful buildings there's not a house
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:46.180]  that hasn't been painted or a building that hasn't been renewed the whole
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.820]  center of the city it's just a beautiful place now because of the rebuild
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:52.940]  after the earthquake there's 30 billion dollars spent on the rebuild so you know
[01:26:52.940 --> 01:26:56.860]  it's just a brand-new city now it's just just beautiful well that's just
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:00.780]  terrible well thank you so much Paul for your take on the situation and I'm
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:05.060]  glad that your family was safe with you being right them you know witness the
[01:27:05.060 --> 01:27:08.260]  shooting we're all running around trying to pick up the kids that have to
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:11.420]  score but we got blocked from actually doing it well I'm not somebody that's
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:15.620]  into torture but man I'd sure like to find out why this comeback really did
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.860]  this or he just may be completely insane obviously he's insane thank you so
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:22.220]  much for the call Paul
[01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:25.460]  Bracken thanks for holding while the caller called him but obviously that
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:28.940]  takes precedent we're gonna break a few minutes but what is your just snapshot
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:34.540]  first approximation of this well there's a lot to dig in and the guy the guy was
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:40.660]  a devotee of Anders Breckvik the Swede and he learned from the Breckvik
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:44.740]  incident that any names mentioned in the manifesto would throw a spotlight on
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:49.620]  them so part of its trolling like the Candace Owens thing but I'm going back
[01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:56.380]  to the former guy is even in Australian why do you care so much about Europe this
[01:27:56.380 --> 01:28:00.420]  I'm quoting from the manifesto why do you care so much about Europe aren't you
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:05.500]  an Australian this is in the Q&A format of his manifesto and the answers
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:09.140]  Australia just like the rest of the colonies of Europe is simply an
[01:28:09.140 --> 01:28:12.980]  offshoot of the European people a finger on the hand of the body of Europe he
[01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:17.420]  does not say he's an Australian I was talking today to Brad Johnson who's a
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:24.060]  former CIA station chief in the Balkans you know speak Serbian Russian has he
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:29.980]  has a website called Intel reform dot org and he says the guy sounds like a
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:35.100]  Serbian to him the Cyrillic writing on the on the weapons even using old church
[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:41.100]  Cyrillic this is extremely I notice that it's old and then he could actually who
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:44.340]  knows well let's let's come back to the idea a crypto Islamist and this is a
[01:28:44.340 --> 01:28:48.020]  false flag we're gonna come right back with Matt Bracken he admits he's trying
[01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:51.260]  to cause a civil war if Stuart Rhodes joining us as well we're gonna lay it
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:53.900]  all out today you're not gonna get this anywhere else so they're trying to

[01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:27.020]  eyes of March March 15 2019 I've been saying for months and months that the
[01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:31.660]  globalists like to launch new revolutions new wars on March 15th it goes
[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:37.100]  back thousands of years since Caesar was killed in the Roman forum you've always
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:41.140]  thinking was killed in the Senate it was in the forum but the point is I've been
[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:47.540]  at that spot in Rome it's amazing that it's synthetic it's a false flag
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.500]  regardless because you have a class of civilizations where peanut run by Dick
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:54.220]  Cheney says we're gonna bring in all the radical Muslims we're gonna have a
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:57.460]  clash with the West we're gonna suppress people that oppose it until it
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:02.380]  explodes then we're gonna have a whole new war and out of that comes the world
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:07.780]  government something like there's a crusade to stop Islam out of that comes
[01:34:07.780 --> 01:34:10.540]  the world government synthesis only at Matt Bracken's take on that then also
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:15.380]  bring up founder of all keepers head of all keepers there's also constitutional
[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.500]  lawyer who's practiced law before he's not practicing now he's too busy with
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:25.100]  all keepers a Stuart Rhodes so that's all coming up here in just a moment but
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:28.060]  when you pull back from this just during the break and we didn't have it DVR it
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:32.580]  was on satellite I didn't catch I was unable to tape it I watched it it was
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:37.460]  Ilhan Omar from Somalia that says America's garbage and America's evil
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:42.460]  and Venezuela's great but she sure wanted to get it from Somalia you're
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:46.740]  kidnapped in five minutes if you're a westerner in Somalia five minutes you
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:50.380]  are held for ransom you're killed in many cases their number one business is
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:54.900]  piracy and then after that it's kidnapping women are sold into sex
[01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:59.420]  slavery their genitals are cut off so she flees that comes here there's no
[01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:04.660]  apologies when on Christmas Day all over the world people get run over by
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:09.460]  trucks churches get blown up thousands get killed sometimes it's just a few
[01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:14.540]  days usually it's hundreds Palm Sunday there's usually six seven eight ten
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:21.540]  hundred twenty churches get blown up in Egypt it'll be a minor footnote oh and
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:26.180]  today there were a bunch of bombings no one goes in personalizes the people no
[01:35:26.180 --> 01:35:31.620]  one shows the Coptic Christians no one shows all the brown Christians getting
[01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:36.660]  blown up but when it happens to the Muslims it's a big deal I don't want to
[01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:41.060]  see Muslims gun down I know most of them are but the point is the leadership of a
[01:35:41.060 --> 01:35:44.980]  lot of groups ish so coming up next hour I'm gonna go through the great
[01:35:44.980 --> 01:35:48.180]  replacement as manifesto we've almost completed reading the whole thing and

[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:15.660]  877-789-2539 I'm friends with a Coptic Christian fellow I met who's a pastor and
[01:37:15.660 --> 01:37:20.100]  a business owner and a guy truly smart he's from Egypt and I'm trying to call
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:23.460]  him he's wanting to come on lately but talk about what's happening with
[01:37:23.460 --> 01:37:26.420]  Christians being persecuted strangely enough and I've gotten back with him but
[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:29.940]  I've been calling him he hadn't got back with me so I want to get him on soon as
[01:37:29.940 --> 01:37:33.620]  well going to Matt Bracken enemies foreign domestic comm best-selling
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:38.420]  author terrorism expert Navy SEAL deployed the Middle East comes highly
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:42.300]  recommended in the past few years by a lot of smart folks what there's a lot to
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:46.060]  go through here you drop the mom shell that he may not even be an Aussie how do
[01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:50.380]  you get these guns that are illegal even for people to have you know in a New
[01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:54.700]  Zealand we've confirmed that the scripting the demonizing hand of
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:59.180]  someone's Pewdiepie to the systems both targeting right now he says he wants to
[01:37:59.180 --> 01:38:03.740]  cause a civil war what's really going on here well the fact that he's done so
[01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:09.260]  much traveling makes it very easy for him to appear and disappear he could
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:14.140]  have been taken under somebody's wing and programmed and brainwashed I mean
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:18.940]  starting starting with a very disturbed individual but he seems to have gone on
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:23.620]  quite a journey I'm halfway through his manifesto reading every line he's in a
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:28.780]  very intelligent person you disagree with his thinking but the way he puts
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:32.980]  thoughts together it's at a high level he's a very intelligent person and
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:40.300]  whether he's trolling or sincere or all over the place I can't say but the fact
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:44.380]  that he could assemble these weapons means he either had help you know some
[01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:50.980]  diplomatic pouch etc or he's an extensive planner an extensive planner
[01:38:50.980 --> 01:38:56.020]  possibly even a smuggler if he's doing this all alone you know I call this the
[01:38:56.020 --> 01:39:00.940]  Facebook massacre because what's unique about it is not the location he chose
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:06.020]  New Zealand because it is remote it to show that everywhere white people live
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:10.820]  the Muslims are invading so he chose New Zealand because there hadn't been
[01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:15.460]  anything like this he's not a Kiwi it's not unique to New Zealand what's unique
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:21.660]  about this shooting compared to Dylan Roof Anders Breckvick Parkland Las Vegas
[01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:27.140]  is that he live streamed it on Facebook not to some blog that picked it up he
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:34.060]  put this on Facebook and it ran for like 17 or 20 minutes live worldwide that
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:39.340]  possibly is the unique characteristic if not for Facebook live streaming or
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:43.300]  live streaming in general he might not have done it it might not have had the
[01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:48.340]  impact that he wanted going is they want to now say no more live streaming for
[01:39:48.340 --> 01:39:52.060]  the general public it's too powerful it exposes the power structure they're
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:56.020]  scared of it so now Apple and YouTube and all of them are gonna act like it's
[01:39:56.020 --> 01:39:59.300]  legitimate to start taking that away from the general public because you're
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:03.500]  seeing a demonization of communication systems as if they themselves are bad
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:10.300]  but we're in an info war obviously and I I think that to be effective in an
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:14.660]  info war you use the ammunition that's on the table and the ammunition on the
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:18.940]  table is to call this the Facebook massacre pin this right on Mark Zuckerberg
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:24.100]  Mark Zuckerberg he's the guy that made the tool that instigated this that
[01:40:24.100 --> 01:40:28.700]  allowed that promoted it if not for Facebook live streaming he might have
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:32.020]  done something else or nothing at all but the fact that he knew that his
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:37.540]  manifesto would have worldwide impact in immediately so you can do this in New
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:42.300]  Zealand if and and it's worldwide known seen everywhere without Facebook live
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:46.060]  streaming it this happened in New Zealand it's a news story that we read about in
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:51.020]  the Daily Mail it can be massaged and tailored but because of the powerful
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:56.260]  tool of Facebook live streaming he went to New Zealand and did it that way so I
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:01.700]  say call it the Facebook massacre let Mark Zuckerberg and his minions defend
[01:41:01.700 --> 01:41:06.700]  that it's not the Facebook massacre put that put them on the backheels put them
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:11.140]  on the defensive but here's my problem with that that's where this is already
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:15.060]  going and the momentum is going that way like they blame gab when it wasn't
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:18.340]  gab's fault when it happens five minutes four minutes for the guy did it the
[01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:23.460]  platform a telephone a TV show it's not to blame it's who's saying it and I get
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:26.460]  Zuckerberg and all them have been using this against us so it'd be sweet
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:30.180]  justice to see it done to them but don't you see the long term where this goes
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:36.060]  well this sounds like the Republicans that voted for against the the the
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:40.580]  border emergency saying oh yeah well the Democrats will use this if we use it
[01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:44.740]  look there's ammo on the table load the gun and use it the ammo on the table is
[01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:49.340]  this was a Facebook massacre saying well the Liberals will use this against us
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:53.780]  like with gab or practically blaming infowars for Sandy Hook in their invert
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:58.860]  inverted logic I say call this the Facebook massacre let Mark Zuckerberg
[01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:03.660]  come on 60 minutes and apologize well that's what they expect everybody else
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:08.060]  to do I mean I don't know how grand bells to blame 50 years ago if somebody
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:11.780]  you know called in a bomb thread over the telephone but yeah two more
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:15.140]  platforms of suspended gab in the wake of Pittsburgh shooting you know that
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:19.260]  happened to them so I'm saying exactly under the media's justice you're right
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:24.100]  I guess the best way to teach him would be to say the platform Facebook shut it
[01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.100]  down remove it which is strange and we're gonna go to break take some calls
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:31.740]  and bring through roads on unless this question we come back why have we seen
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:36.180]  Facebook down why have we seen a bunch of other big platforms completely down
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:40.060]  for up to a day in the last few days all the big platforms have been going down
[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:46.740]  very very suspiciously what's really going on Matt Brackens our guest coming

[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:32.220]  we're gonna be taking your phone calls in the next hour Stuart Rhodes is on the
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:36.460]  road founder of Oathkeepers.org he's gonna give his take Matt Braggins and
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:40.660]  Ryb Shutton with us for a few more segments as well we've taken a lot of
[01:47:40.660 --> 01:47:44.460]  calls obviously from Australia and New Zealand about to take some calls from
[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:49.180]  Canada and here in the States again I'm Alex Jones your host Monday through
[01:47:49.180 --> 01:47:54.980]  Friday 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here in the war room with Owen shroyer at 3 p.m.
[01:47:54.980 --> 01:48:01.420]  central and then of course we have weekday mornings that is 8 a.m. central
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:07.740]  standard time David Knight just a footnote too about Roger Stone I like
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:12.220]  Roger he's a nice person I've not been involved in all his politics and all of
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:17.620]  his machinations and the political stuff he does I wanted to hire Roger as a
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:22.020]  political pundit to talk about politics and news here on here and he did a
[01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:25.260]  pretty good job until the last few months and he was just consumed obviously
[01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:29.940]  with what was happening to him and then when he got the gag order he won't even
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:36.100]  talk to me and so Roger no longer works here and he understands that we've got a
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:41.500]  amicable parting that happened a few weeks ago and I wish him well I think
[01:48:41.500 --> 01:48:46.140]  he's being railroaded but people want me to comment on it it's not to the point
[01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:50.380]  where he doesn't want me to comment on at the level he's gotten into with his
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:54.420]  court and the rest of it so it's not my rodeo you've been very supportive of
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:59.700]  Roger I've been very supportive it's just that we're fighting a larger fight
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:04.260]  here and I've been sued by Jerome Corsi because of all the Roger Stone stuff
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:08.700]  and and Larry claiming it's just it's out of control ladies and gentlemen the
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:13.260]  whole situation is completely out of control but it doesn't matter in force
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:16.140]  is growing big breakthroughs have happened we're having a lot of big
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:20.940]  successes thanks to your prayers but it's so important for everyone to

[01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:18.620]  to bring up Stuart Rhodes and get his approximation as a veteran and a man
[01:50:18.620 --> 01:50:22.540]  that's practiced constitutional law and somebody who's been warning about false
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:26.100]  flags I just think the guy getting the guns the fact he traveled all over the
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:30.420]  world the fact that he's shing he wants to cause a civil war that's what
[01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:34.980]  Charlie Manson wanted in Helter Skelter trying to frame black people for
[01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:39.220]  killing Sharon Tate but he got caught Stuart Rhodes what's your first
[01:50:39.220 --> 01:50:45.380]  approximation on this? Well I watched a video I found the video online I watched
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:50.380]  the entire thing I think this guy was a you know I guess you could say a true
[01:50:50.380 --> 01:50:55.380]  believer white nationalist apparently but yeah he wanted to spark a race for
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:59.740]  that's what he wanted so but the expected you know whether he was you know
[01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:04.620]  some kind of a MK ultra manipulated person or not the outcome is gonna be
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:09.840]  the same it's gonna be used to attempt to disarm us even further disarm the
[01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:15.180]  West and also to censor us and crush free speech that's what's gonna happen and
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:18.100]  so we have to just say we're just not gonna accept that we're not gonna
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:21.500]  disarm I mean didn't it didn't help the people in that mosque to be unarmed it
[01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:25.940]  were completely defenseless and that's exactly you know why and why it was
[01:51:25.940 --> 01:51:30.260]  successful so disarming is not gonna save anyone's life so don't do it
[01:51:30.260 --> 01:51:33.340]  I don't want to get a fight going on here and I usually read with Matt Bracken
[01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:37.540]  he's like it's ammo on the table Zuckerberg and everybody blamed gab for
[01:51:37.540 --> 01:51:41.060]  other events so let's blame them for this to me it's a transmission system like
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:45.260]  a telephone I think it's a very dangerous game sure use the left tactics
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:48.660]  against him I just I'm not Machiavellian I'm not trying to be mean to Matt but I
[01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:51.060]  think at a fundamental level I think this is playing with fire what do you
[01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:54.800]  think Stuart well yeah I mean I think it's a fair point it was this is on
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:59.020]  Facebook right to use Facebook as his platform if he had done this on your
[01:51:59.020 --> 01:52:03.500]  show you know live stream is his attack on your show that you know to use that
[01:52:03.500 --> 01:52:08.260]  against you I could see his point but the thing is no I agree that's why we're
[01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:12.340]  having the debate so what do we do we always let the left manipulate and do
[01:52:12.340 --> 01:52:16.780]  all this and we always play clean I get his point but it's like the ring of
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:20.580]  Mordor though Matt Bracken you start you yeah you win the war but you become
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:26.580]  Soron well it's it's going to be a fight in the trenches if we're gonna win
[01:52:26.580 --> 01:52:31.500]  eventually you know I need to I need to get back to the this guy is this is a
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:37.260]  complicated guy Brad Johnson former CIA officer station chief in the Balkans he
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:40.580]  says the guy's got a Serbian accent maybe that's put on as a fake another
[01:52:40.580 --> 01:52:48.900]  layer of texture in his in his you know let's go back he's got this slavic
[01:52:48.900 --> 01:52:54.540]  text on the firearms yeah I slavic the Cyrillic letters in Serbian church
[01:52:54.540 --> 01:52:58.740]  a script you know using letter and lettering that is archaic that is
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:05.260]  orthodox and and then he he's on the car right in he's playing the song the
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:11.660]  Serbian nationalist anthem soldiers anthem called remove kebab with kebab
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:16.980]  meaning like Muslims just kebab so he's playing a Serbian song in the car that
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:21.620]  is these are all these are all you mentioned it let's back you up and play
[01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:24.620]  the clip here it is
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:34.180]  no it's before that or after this okay yeah it comes after it
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:43.660]  you know I had a church there's no damn way I would have armed guards no it's
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:47.340]  before that when he's driving when he's driving they play the Serbian song I
[01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:51.260]  will stop there guys can you go scrub it back a few minutes before thanks we'll
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:59.580]  come back where he was hanging out on the 8chan chat board they they they love
[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:02.340]  the fact that he played that apparently it's something that's like one of their
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:07.100]  inside inside things on that on that chat but then they were like oh he played
[01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:13.180]  the you know that the remove kebab music and it's epic so they're all into
[01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:17.220]  that it could be it could be that you know there's a cultural appropriation who
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:20.900]  knows I think we found it I think we found it for TV and radio listeners here
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:22.900]  it is
[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:46.900]  oh yeah
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:51.620]  so it's clear that he scripted all of this he's prepared it he gets every
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:55.580]  political group he blames them against each other he says I love Trump I hate
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:59.380]  Trump I love Candace Owens but she's even more violent than me you know I love
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:03.100]  PewDiePie subscribe to PewDiePie I mean clearly the guy's trying to get the
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:09.220]  internet censored is what this looks like to me Matt Bracken well he's trying
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:15.540]  to cause massive overreaction leading to a counter overreaction resulting in a
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:19.700]  civil war and I think and then eventually a race war that he hopes the
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:25.700]  whites will live reading the manifesto which I do recommend he is concerned
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:30.300]  with the time element we can't have a you know a white nationalist victory in
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:34.340]  a hundred years because we'll be extinct we have to kick this thing into
[01:55:34.340 --> 01:55:39.820]  overdrive now and that's his goal but he said in going back to the Serbian thing
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:44.540]  it's a Q&A that he wrote and he says but aren't you an Australian and then he
[01:55:44.540 --> 01:55:49.040]  says something about Australia is just a finger of Europe so the fact that he
[01:55:49.040 --> 01:55:55.740]  did not say yes I'm an Australian and Brad Johnson the CIA guy he says he uses
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:56:00.500]  an a Slavic accent when he's saying the PewDiePie thing if you queue up the part
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:04.620]  where he is it's great it's not very high-def but the part where he's saying
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:10.460]  subscribe to PewDiePie it's either a real or a fake Serbian accent the guy's
[01:56:10.460 --> 01:56:14.060]  deep you know I mean exactly and well I've got a couple guys that have been
[01:56:14.060 --> 01:56:17.100]  reading over it with notes we're gonna come in next hour and break all of this
[01:56:17.100 --> 01:56:22.980]  down but this is like this is Charlie Manson 2.0 is what I think what do you
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:27.020]  think Stuart Rhodes well I think you know frankly I think this guy was a
[01:56:27.020 --> 01:56:32.940]  sincere Eurocentric white nationalist I think he traveled the world and like
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:37.020]  you said that his manifesto he traveled in Europe was disturbed by what he saw
[01:56:37.020 --> 01:56:40.340]  about for the mass immigration and I think it just pushed him over the edge
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:44.380]  but and that this is why I think it's going to be used to target all the rest
[01:56:44.380 --> 01:56:48.140]  of us who are concerned about the same thing I mean it's a it's a real threat
[01:56:48.140 --> 01:56:52.660]  to the West it's a real it's a real you know notice when a guy at Christmas runs
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:55.860]  over 200 people and kills a hundred and something they don't they don't humanize
[01:56:55.860 --> 01:56:59.160]  the baby toddlers nothing when a church is blown up it's not talked about but
[01:56:59.160 --> 01:57:03.340]  now with this it's gonna get hyped to the heavens right when the when the
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:07.940]  when the Muslims go crazy and kill us it's never don't blame his law but when
[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:11.820]  when a guy who's worried about or concerned about mass immigration of
[01:57:11.820 --> 01:57:14.900]  Muslims into Europe goes crazy and kills people then they're gonna blame all
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:17.900]  the rest of us have the same concern that's how it's gonna be used this is
[01:57:17.900 --> 01:57:21.380]  why we have to just fight back and say you know what that isn't a racist back
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:24.580]  that this is a problem because this is what drove this guy over the edge and
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:28.300]  not making excuses for him what I'm saying is is that it's a real serious
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:32.980]  problem and he saw it and because he saw it I don't agree with what he did but he
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:36.660]  saw he saw something that's very real we can't back away from that we also can't
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:40.540]  back away from our responsibility to be armed I mean you know the only way to
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:43.740]  stop the shooting like that is the army that's right it was somebody with a
[01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:47.580]  firearm that didn't run him off we'll be right back stay with us living in
[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:52.460]  volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:57.380]  here in Leilani estates but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and
[01:57:57.380 --> 01:58:02.260]  we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:06.780]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:11.820]  unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[01:58:11.820 --> 01:58:17.220]  alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[01:58:17.220 --> 01:58:21.980]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from
[01:58:21.980 --> 01:58:26.420]  our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:31.940]  safe measure but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns
[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:37.020]  out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water so what we've
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:41.540]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:48.100]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[01:58:48.100 --> 01:59:03.100]  by leaps and by bounds the number one best-selling supplement family in the
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:07.980]  world is energy drinks and energy supplements but they are riddled with
[01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:12.980]  dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a
[01:59:12.980 --> 01:59:16.820]  quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects we
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:21.540]  have developed hands down from our research the most powerful healthy
[01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:26.660]  energy drink pre-workout and beyond system in the world there's nothing else
[01:59:26.660 --> 01:59:31.500]  like it must experience it it is a total game changer and it comes in easy to
[01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:36.020]  use packaged mixed in fruit juice or water whatever you'd like warning though
[01:59:36.020 --> 01:59:40.020]  it's very very strong it lasts 10 hours so take a half pack the first time you
[01:59:40.020 --> 01:59:43.500]  take it because turbo force is named turbo force because it will take you
[01:59:43.500 --> 01:59:52.820]  into overdrive turbo force and enforce live com you're listening to the Alex
[01:59:52.820 --> 02:00:15.100]  Jones show
[02:00:22.820 --> 02:00:46.620]  all right I'm going to take your phone calls Jacob Josh Grant Brandon
[02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:51.860]  Catherine James John Sean Zach Ray and others coming up I'm also going to go
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:54.900]  through the manifesto here but finishing up with Stuart Rhodes of
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:01:00.180]  bothkeepers.org Stuart I mean it's true that Islam is run by radical
[02:01:00.180 --> 02:01:04.740]  expansionist Islam it's true that Muslims kill more than anybody in the
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:07.940]  world even the UN admits there's been a doubling the number of Christians killed
[02:01:07.940 --> 02:01:11.620]  the last decade the Christians account for more than half of people persecuted
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:16.460]  and killed on the planet and so it's also true that when Muslims strike out and
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:20.780]  bomb churches or shoot-up churches every Christmas every Easter all over the
[02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:24.420]  world and run down whole families with vehicles we were told it's not Muslims
[02:01:24.420 --> 02:01:28.220]  so that's going to cause unhinged people to get violent but what about the
[02:01:28.220 --> 02:01:31.660]  bigger equation of the class of civilizations and where the globalists
[02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:35.620]  are trying to take this what's their end game well they're in game to destroy
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:39.100]  the West and that's why you have this unholy alliance between the far left
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:43.740]  and the Islamists they both have the same goal which is to destroy the West
[02:01:43.740 --> 02:01:47.580]  and certainly there are some people on the left who don't want to do that there
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:50.980]  are also some some Muslims who don't want to do that but they're you know
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:55.180]  they're they're a minority within their own within their own world the great
[02:01:55.180 --> 02:01:59.020]  majority left is becoming very clear now absolutely hates the West hates this
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:02.860]  country hates everything about it and wants to destroy it yeah it's part of
[02:02:02.860 --> 02:02:05.980]  their religion but like as Matt pointed out not too long ago we're on the show
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:10.260]  together that's their religion Marx is their god you know and Stalin and
[02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:13.460]  Lenin those are the high priests those are the prophets and they publicly say
[02:02:13.460 --> 02:02:19.100]  America is garbage it sucks Christians are horrible I mean these people are
[02:02:19.100 --> 02:02:24.300]  the enemy and so and so they'll excuse in the Marxist world view everything is
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:29.180]  capitalism fault you know human beings are all shaped by by capitalism and so
[02:02:29.180 --> 02:02:35.420]  the way them oh we're in a $5,000 $3,000 outfits AOC said it's indefensible
[02:02:35.420 --> 02:02:41.060]  and inexcusable capitalism yeah so though so you can put your point out
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:44.860]  well this is what the radical Muslims are doing and their heads that's the West
[02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:49.860]  fault so they have this blinder on their faces where they they will accept what's
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:55.620]  being done the patriarchy of the Islamist is okay even though it oppresses
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:03:00.260]  women like crazy you know control circumcision all that stuff that they do
[02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:04.700]  that's okay because that's still the West fault you know but they that's okay
[02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:08.260]  because they're victims too so they're the only victims that are allowed to go
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:11.900]  over the world and blow people up and impress women they're never called out
[02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:15.620]  on it by the left with refer a few exceptions Sam Harris is one of them
[02:03:15.620 --> 02:03:20.220]  right but there's there's good that's why that's all about the West being oh I
[02:03:20.220 --> 02:03:25.540]  was I was in a hotel in in in East Lima Harris off the coast of Mexico and
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:30.580]  they were having a gay wedding and I was watching in the interactions for the
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:34.420]  two days that was this one hotel I was watching all these gay guys trying to
[02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:38.780]  kiss the ass of a bunch of Muslims wearing you know jibs and everything
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:42.820]  there's just Muslims everywhere now and the Muslims would just disgustingly go
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:47.260]  like don't talk to me and the men the women like yeah and the gay guys would
[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:51.060]  just kiss their ass more don't you get they throw you off buildings you dumb
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:56.580]  bastard but they hate their leftist hate America so much they think oh Muslims

[02:04:13.820 --> 02:04:18.580]  just a decadent society and its collapse I mean it just comes to my mind
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:22.660]  because I've been I've been reading the manifesto and you know there's there's a
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:28.980]  lot of what the shooter says that is on point and some of it is about the
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:33.220]  decadence of the West you know the things that we've been discussing the you
[02:04:33.220 --> 02:04:37.780]  know the 11-year-old drag queen and this is a society that's in its in its
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:42.940]  failing stage and the Muslim America and the West has gangrene all over us our
[02:04:42.940 --> 02:04:46.740]  fingers are riding off our toes our eyeballs are falling out and it's just
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:49.380]  it's just insanity we'll be right back with Matt Bracken's final statement
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:52.460]  your phone calls then I'll read the entire manifesto on air thanks to great
[02:04:52.460 --> 02:04:57.020]  work of one of our producers Scott stay with us I've got some really good news
[02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:04.700]  though X2 is back the original X2 deep breath crystal pure atomic iodine what
[02:05:04.700 --> 02:05:09.500]  you want in four store.com it'll be here in a week manufactured in the US in
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:13.940]  four store.com with the best iodine in the world X2 it's available I thought
[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:17.420]  X3 is great we still got another deep breath crystal source but I thought add
[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:20.660]  the other two types of iodine the scientists that do that it sold a lot
[02:05:20.660 --> 02:05:24.980]  that people want original X2 what I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2 but
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:30.020]  it came through about a month ago we now have X2 again and in four store.com so
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:35.020]  hallelujah it's been sold out for about almost three months but we have now had
[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:41.740]  the same company the original X2 develop it again and we were able to do the
[02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:46.620]  exact same formula when a pre-order X2 the ultimate iodine out there learn
[02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:49.780]  about the iodine conspiracy learn about IQ dropping when you don't have it
[02:05:49.780 --> 02:05:54.700]  learn about how the other items are bound get yours today at info or store.com

[02:06:06.540 --> 02:06:14.340]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:22.340]  you better hide what you have to hide
[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:32.340]  see your problems
[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:41.420]  I just wonder why these mass shooters person to hell of Islamic or leftist
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:45.980]  or right wing or whatever would just stop targeting mosque and churches and
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:51.420]  unarmed innocent people you're a real man I'm not saying do this but go find some
[02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:57.740]  soldiers go find some warriors that's what warriors are supposed to do is they
[02:06:57.740 --> 02:07:02.260]  go find the other groups warriors that's why I'm a giant critic of Islam it
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:06.740]  loves to attack women and children Matt Bracken we've got loaded phone lines I
[02:07:06.740 --> 02:07:09.980]  appreciate you giving us so much time and we have gone through the entire
[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:12.940]  manifesto I'm gonna do that after you leave and I'd like to invite you back
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:16.820]  obviously you're a smart guy on the war room today to go back over this this
[02:07:16.820 --> 02:07:20.060]  manifesto where at the end he just admits he wants to cause a total
[02:07:20.060 --> 02:07:25.100]  revolution boiling over of the melting pot well that's what the globalist one
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:29.060]  I mean they want the class of civilizations and out of that comes the
[02:07:29.060 --> 02:07:32.660]  outlawing of religion except they're one world religion their global social
[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:35.900]  score so I think we know the answer so whether it's the council on foreign
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:39.700]  relations or whether it's the project for the American century or whether it's
[02:07:39.700 --> 02:07:44.340]  the CIA-connected Theodore Kaczynski or the CIA-connected Helter Skelter
[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:49.900]  Charlie Manson or this piece of garbage Brenton Tarrant they they're telling us
[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:55.780]  what they want but what comes out of that crisis well I think all all of the
[02:07:55.780 --> 02:08:01.180]  main players the social the social actors in this it seems like all of this
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:07.980]  is heading towards a big cataclysm a big conflict the New Zealand situation the
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:12.420]  guy wants to speed it up because he thinks time is against us the globalists
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:17.140]  want to keep the borders open and keep flooding the you know America and the
[02:08:17.140 --> 02:08:22.100]  West with unassimilable third-worlders for as long as they can before there's
[02:08:22.100 --> 02:08:27.300]  a rupture so what the guy what what Brenton Tarrant did in New Zealand was
[02:08:27.300 --> 02:08:31.100]  try to to speed it up so that the cataclysm happened sooner rather than
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:35.060]  later but you know when Stuart I was agreeing completely with everything that
[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:40.060]  Stuart was saying in the last segments the left and and the Islamists have a
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:45.620]  an alliance of convenience both think that after they destroy freedom destroy
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:50.660]  Western civilization they can then turn on their main enemy but what history
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:56.820]  teaches to me at least is that when socialists have to have to either
[02:08:56.820 --> 02:09:02.380]  confront or blend with Islam Islam wins you know the socialists aren't gonna
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:06.860]  just start chopping off heads the Islamists do so like like Carlos the
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:13.340]  Jackal he converted to Islam and he said only you know a synthesis of Islam and
[02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:18.380]  socialism can defeat America and defeat the West so that's what we're seeing and
[02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:24.860]  in the long run I think let's explain why Napoleon and Carlos the Jackal and
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:29.100]  so many others converted Islam because for a thug male it's the best system
[02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:33.740]  sure you get the you right off the bat you get to oppress women you know you
[02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:37.620]  when you you get you marry who you buy the wife that the girl has nothing to
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:41.220]  say about who she marries and if she gets out of line or doesn't do what you
[02:09:41.220 --> 02:09:45.540]  like her to do you can hit her so it's a it's a deal with the devil hit her you
[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:50.460]  can let's just ground her ass in the pool or stoner to death right and you
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:55.780]  don't forget another famous socialist named Adolf Hitler he happened to be a
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:10:00.700]  national socialist he thought that Islam was great he wished that Islam had
[02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:04.260]  succeeded in fact he had the granny mama Jerusalem and all of the sign on
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:10.740]  absolutely absolutely so wet but when it comes to crunch time when we're all in
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:14.940]  our graves and our women are all in burkas you know we're gonna look back
[02:10:14.940 --> 02:10:19.420]  at these days and if you read the manifesto this is what Tarant is saying
[02:10:19.420 --> 02:10:24.340]  embrace infamy he's saying in 27 years they'll let me out of prison I'll be a
[02:10:24.340 --> 02:10:29.500]  hero you know that I don't know I mean maybe he's crazy but what he's seeing is
[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:35.860]  this race war cataclysm and a complete new order you know based on on whites
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:39.660]  having white homelands basically yeah but if he was so tough he would have
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:45.340]  then say gone to the Middle East and taken out Erdogan or something be such a
[02:10:45.340 --> 02:10:49.940]  commando he go do that no no he's it's a propaganda strike that's why I call it
[02:10:49.940 --> 02:10:54.580]  the Facebook massacre because he didn't do it for the 49 or 50 that he wants to
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:58.780]  kill he did it for the global impact that's why he livestreamed no no I know
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:03.740]  why he did it I just you know these these it's it's it's just instinctively
[02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:07.860]  targeting a bunch of civilians makes me sick but he did it so we'd read his
[02:11:07.860 --> 02:11:14.020]  manifesto and we are but he thinks that in you know in his lifetime that there's
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:19.100]  a good chance he'll be let out of prison you know it's like I looked up somebody
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:22.420]  mentioned the 14 he wrote all over the rifles it has to do with something called
[02:11:22.420 --> 02:11:30.220]  the 14 words and the 14 words goes back to 1984 if you remember the radio talk
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:34.820]  show host Alan Berg in Denver he got murdered by these white nationalists
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:39.340]  called the order some of these guys are in prison for like 200 years but even
[02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:44.620]  from prison they're still writing and still have influence and so the 14
[02:11:44.620 --> 02:11:49.700]  words is about white nationalism so he put that all over his rifles so that
[02:11:49.700 --> 02:11:55.540]  anybody looking at this Facebook live stream would start doing research on
[02:11:55.540 --> 02:11:59.380]  things like the 14 words clearly clearly so so why do you think Charlie
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:04.140]  Manson is the first person I know of in the in the US since World War two who
[02:12:04.140 --> 02:12:08.980]  tried to trigger a race war why does this keep coming up well imagine the
[02:12:08.980 --> 02:12:12.820]  tools that were available then the police cracked the case and we knew it was
[02:12:12.820 --> 02:12:18.940]  Charlie Manson's you know gang of losers but in the in the Facebook era the the
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:23.540]  in the social media era you know you can cause an act and everybody on the
[02:12:23.540 --> 02:12:27.540]  planet knows about it you know two hours later it's just amplified
[02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:31.540]  unbelievably what the Bible talks about the end days is total insanity and mass
[02:12:31.540 --> 02:12:35.980]  murder and just infamy all right Matt Bracken great points enemies farm
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:41.980]  domestic.com thanks for joining us thank you okay folks well I want to go to your
[02:12:41.980 --> 02:12:50.260]  phone calls now I want to go to your phone calls coming up in the next
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:54.500]  segment you know Millie Weaver's got some points she wants to make and I don't
[02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:57.260]  know how I'm gonna go over this manifesto if she comes on the show which I
[02:12:57.260 --> 02:13:00.700]  want to talk to Millie about her take on this I'm gonna have to figure out what
[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:04.140]  I'm gonna do because there's so much to get to and so little time but this is
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:08.620]  gonna be used a sense of the Internet it's gonna be used for cultural collision
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:13.980]  and cultural crisis and then out of that cultural crisis they'll call for a
[02:13:13.980 --> 02:13:19.660]  one-world code of ethics where every ideology has to be approved Christianity's
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:23.500]  banned and radical Islam's banned so we quote don't have these crises anymore
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:27.180]  when the globalists admit the PNAC documents and so many others that that's
[02:13:27.180 --> 02:13:31.140]  their plan. So I'm gonna move Millie to the last segment of this hour and I'll
[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:34.340]  host a little bit in the next hour we'll push baggage back some he'll be all
[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:38.740]  right with that Dr. Nick baggage always informative and so I'll be able to hit
[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:42.620]  the manifesto at the bottom of the hour but I'm gonna get some of these calls
[02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:48.500]  under our belt from Colorado and Iowa and Canada and Texas and Pennsylvania

[02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:02.140]  yes a lot of the news we haven't gotten to is up on infowars.com and newswars.com
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:06.340]  child protective services investigated mother after 11-year-old drag queen
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:10.500]  dances at gay bar the money's paid to the parents so they literally pimp their

[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:39.580]  big labor blast green new deal says that China and India and Mexico don't have
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:43.660]  any of these controls that will bankrupt is further that's the plan of AOC but
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:51.420]  I'm glad that working-class blue collar liberals aren't suicidal so that is all
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:57.860]  coming up ladies and gentlemen but I've been saying the perfect thing with this

[02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:16.300]  false flag to blame us a false flag just simply means that it's not who who you're
[02:15:16.300 --> 02:15:19.940]  told did it didn't really do it or you're told it's a right-wing Christian

[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:31.580]  I'm Alex Jones your host Harris Smith one of our great anchors on reporters he
[02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:35.180]  just returned from a big investigation he was doing well the findings of soon in
[02:20:35.180 --> 02:20:39.740]  Japan and he came in to meet her in the break he said listen I've read the
[02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:44.660]  manifesto several times he said this is 4chan this is 8chan this guy's not a
[02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:50.940]  patsy he's real he's very intelligent but he's terribly wrong and I'll take
[02:20:50.940 --> 02:20:54.980]  calls coming up later in the hour I'm gonna go through the chilling manifesto
[02:20:54.980 --> 02:20:58.980]  to give you the mindset of this attempt by the globalist to create an
[02:20:58.980 --> 02:21:03.420]  atmosphere that causes global crisis out of which a world government forms that's
[02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:10.420]  in the CFR that's in the UN ethos that's that's the PNAC plan so everyone
[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:15.640]  keeps asking what's the plan it's global crisis global infighting you see the
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:19.060]  left promoting it everywhere and then out of that comes a one-world government
[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:22.620]  you can say oh well you know this guy makes points not that any of us agree
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:28.060]  with it of course but he makes points in a sub-level of a crisis that's already
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:31.340]  been engineered so Harrison you're gonna be co-hosting with Owen shroyer at three
[02:21:31.340 --> 02:21:36.460]  o'clock central today give us a prelude to what you discovered yeah basically I
[02:21:36.460 --> 02:21:39.860]  followed this you know from the minute it happened as it was happening live
[02:21:39.860 --> 02:21:45.020]  from the original post on 8chan and just the simple matter is the people in the
[02:21:45.020 --> 02:21:52.300]  media if you aren't fully aware of what the 4chan 8chan Chan culture is then
[02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:56.740]  this manifesto could be absolutely baffling to you you cannot understand
[02:21:56.740 --> 02:22:02.300]  it without absolutely understanding the sarcasm the inside jokes that go on
[02:22:02.300 --> 02:22:06.180]  here so I'll fully break it down with Owen shroyer but it's important to talk
[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:11.340]  about this manifesto and explain this manifesto because it's not going away
[02:22:11.340 --> 02:22:15.940]  and this isn't like the guy who shot up the people in Santa Monica Elliot Rogers
[02:22:15.940 --> 02:22:20.700]  he had a manifesto but it was all nonsense pointless it was self aggrandizing
[02:22:20.700 --> 02:22:26.620]  and just explaining why he did this psychotic act this guy in this attack
[02:22:26.620 --> 02:22:33.140]  yesterday in New Zealand is I believe very thoughtful very intelligent and has a
[02:22:33.140 --> 02:22:38.660]  plan about what he wanted to have happen and so you have to not just ignore
[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:43.020]  this not just shoved under the rug but face it and and and point out exactly
[02:22:43.020 --> 02:22:49.780]  why it's wrong where the logic fails where his hatred and his his overwhelming
[02:22:49.780 --> 02:22:54.980]  obsession with race completely blinds him to the reality of the situation and
[02:22:54.980 --> 02:23:00.940]  here I believe that Americana Renaissance 1776 20 plus years ago I believe that I
[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:04.740]  promoted it others would listen that we could build a global network to relaunch
[02:23:04.740 --> 02:23:08.820]  nationalism we're launching it it worked so now the global is gonna try to use a
[02:23:08.820 --> 02:23:12.500]  race-based system instead of being ideologically based on free market and
[02:23:12.500 --> 02:23:17.780]  Christianity and basic liberty and Western ideas 1776 worldwide to make it on
[02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:20.900]  racial division just because the globalists are going with race to
[02:23:20.900 --> 02:23:26.380]  counter the West if we play that game we lose and so we should be concerned
[02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:30.460]  about his manifesto because his manifesto could take hold just like our
[02:23:30.460 --> 02:23:35.460]  manifesto did and can overwrite our operations right right exactly and he
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:42.020]  just he he he's only gonna make things worse for people like us who don't
[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:49.260]  believe in this racial crap who don't who don't the left makes it racial they
[02:23:49.260 --> 02:23:52.980]  force you to be racial and then if you if you go well they're being racial I
[02:23:52.980 --> 02:23:56.380]  should be racial it makes perfect sense but that's the dirty trap you'll cover
[02:23:56.380 --> 02:24:01.060]  it today 3 o'clock central 4 o'clock Eastern on the war room all right I'm
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:04.180]  gonna be watching that I don't know about you all right enough of that we've
[02:24:04.180 --> 02:24:08.900]  had callers holding up to 40 minutes so they go to your phone calls now who has
[02:24:08.900 --> 02:24:13.660]  been holding the longest that would be Josh in Colorado Josh you're on the
[02:24:13.660 --> 02:24:19.540]  year worldwide thanks for holding thank you Colin from Colorado Springs first
[02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:24.740]  off everyone needs to look up the symbol of the black sun and research it oh
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:29.540]  that's the Nazi secret society had black son yeah the Vareal society you're
[02:24:29.540 --> 02:24:33.220]  talking about on Joe Rogan now the next thing real quick to get to a point
[02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:38.500]  Colorado red flag bill red alert legislator taking over Tom Sullivan
[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:43.900]  father of a kid killed at the James Holmes the Holmes massacre they're
[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:47.620]  coming for our guns in Colorado by the end of the legislator they have full
[02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:52.660]  power right now they're gonna come for the assault weapon seriously I have
[02:24:52.660 --> 02:24:57.580]  inside people in the Republicans here they're taking over Colorado as we
[02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:04.860]  speak well break that down because the Republican Party and the bluebloods have
[02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:08.100]  admitted they're about to try to make their move that they convinced Trump to
[02:25:08.100 --> 02:25:12.220]  get involved with these red flag laws that'll be the end of Trump
[02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:17.420]  well essentially anybody can say that you're crazy and a judge can come take
[02:25:17.420 --> 02:25:22.420]  your gun and now you have to go as many times as you need to go to a judge to
[02:25:22.420 --> 02:25:27.140]  try and get your guns back so mice County of Teller County actually is a
[02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:30.660]  sanctuary now of the Second Amendment but we're not even sure if it's gonna do
[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:34.740]  anything so we have to fight in the the Supreme Court we're pretty much what
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:39.460]  we're in trouble here red alert I mean this guy by the way people say oh don't
[02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:42.940]  get so freaked out your guns will be fine if people didn't get freaked out we
[02:25:42.940 --> 02:25:47.140]  wouldn't have this right the damn Revolutionary War started in 1775 at
[02:25:47.140 --> 02:25:51.540]  Bunker Hill and unless you because they came to take the guns so let's stop
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:54.940]  acting like they don't want them the lefts gone from denying it to be in all
[02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:59.380]  of the newsstand repeal the Second Amendment they're coming that guy down
[02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:06.340]  in New Zealand he's a national socialist he is not a capitalist American you know
[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:12.340]  what they're coming for us that's an attack on us America directly I'm glad
[02:26:12.340 --> 02:26:16.060]  you're upset because I'm sick of collectivist and eco fascist and they
[02:26:16.060 --> 02:26:20.060]  want to organize and run everything they're not America they're not 1776 I
[02:26:20.060 --> 02:26:24.260]  can take a Christian guy from Egypt who's super smart and great and has
[02:26:24.260 --> 02:26:27.900]  brown skin and he'll have a great business a great family it'll be totally
[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:31.820]  law-abiding you make him a Muslim he'll act like a damn animal half the time
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:35.700]  you take a white person to act like that it's the culture and it's the spirit
[02:26:35.700 --> 02:26:39.140]  and we have to have the spirit of Americana defeat their spirit and I
[02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:44.220]  totally agree with you we need to get mad thank you Alex God bless you God
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:48.460]  bless I'm glad Josh is mad that's normal they're teaching five-year-olds how to
[02:26:48.460 --> 02:26:52.700]  suck ding-dongs in schools everywhere and if you're an adult get upset by that
[02:26:52.700 --> 02:26:55.740]  you should be upset they're teaching five-year-olds how to do it so don't
[02:26:55.740 --> 02:27:00.580]  tell me I shouldn't say it on the air well I'm getting angry now let's go and
[02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:04.940]  take another call let's talk to Grant in Iowa says New Zealand Christchurch
[02:27:04.940 --> 02:27:11.420]  attack go ahead you're on the air go ahead and breathe Alex people got to
[02:27:11.420 --> 02:27:18.300]  remind me to do that yeah well just to get started with this idiot he's
[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:22.220]  obviously a sociopath like Bracken was saying he's very intelligent this is
[02:27:22.220 --> 02:27:25.020]  premeditated and that's the most dangerous type of criminal is an
[02:27:25.020 --> 02:27:29.180]  intelligent criminal I'm interested to hear Harrison break down the 4chan
[02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:32.780]  8chan culture because I don't know much about it but you know we can't give him
[02:27:32.780 --> 02:27:35.860]  the crisis that he wants because the media is going to give him the knee jerk
[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:40.180]  reaction that he wants I don't know why we still publish the names of shooters
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:44.780]  we shouldn't even say his name just tell him the Christchurch jerk and you
[02:27:44.780 --> 02:27:49.500]  can't fight terrorism conventionally the only way to combat this behavior in the
[02:27:49.500 --> 02:27:53.260]  short term is to be armed and in the long term is by getting rid of this type
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:58.020]  of ideology well I want to say it 4chan 8chan has some really interesting
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:02.420]  stuff and some funny stuff and some a lot of great many me a lot of great witty
[02:28:02.420 --> 02:28:09.460]  memes but it's also uses an injection port for the fake q stuff and for racial
[02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:14.100]  garbage and for division and the globalist are using it obviously as an
[02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:18.260]  injection port into our veins and so I'm not even saying it's bad I'm just
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:22.620]  saying so many times really bad stuff comes out of it that I then get blamed
[02:28:22.620 --> 02:28:27.860]  with yeah and that's how they use the internet against us you know we're
[02:28:27.860 --> 02:28:31.580]  spreading the truth and they're trying to spread falsehood while we do that so
[02:28:31.580 --> 02:28:35.420]  you know he has a point about infinite immigration he talks about his travels

[02:33:33.460 --> 02:33:38.740]  gonna get to it is right here which is kind of a scary thing I kind of step
[02:33:38.740 --> 02:33:43.860]  back and off sometimes you know if folks knew what was going on behind the
[02:33:43.860 --> 02:33:50.980]  scenes around here if I was at liberty to tell you you would you would be pretty
[02:33:50.980 --> 02:33:55.980]  positive actually there's a lot of bad things happening too but the power
[02:33:55.980 --> 02:34:00.660]  structure has figured out that globalism as it was set up is not gonna work the
[02:34:00.660 --> 02:34:05.620]  people are against it because the people that run the upper echelons were
[02:34:05.620 --> 02:34:10.460]  still compartmentalized they now know what the endgame it was and it's not
[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:15.380]  gonna it's not gonna hunt the dog is not gonna hunt so now there is a mad
[02:34:15.380 --> 02:34:20.580]  scramble to figure out what the establishment is going to do and that's
[02:34:20.580 --> 02:34:25.780]  the point that we have reached here and I'll just leave it at that because I've
[02:34:25.780 --> 02:34:31.140]  got a lot of people not trying to charm me to the table with them but a lot of
[02:34:31.140 --> 02:34:35.260]  people from different levels of government and corporations and the
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:41.940]  military literally saying well what do you think the alternative is well just
[02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:46.180]  how about we don't model everything off after communist China let's start there
[02:34:46.180 --> 02:34:52.100]  or orthodox Islam that's a nice place to start and let's say hands off
[02:34:52.100 --> 02:35:00.140]  sexualizing kids I think that'll get God off our ash right there but you see
[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:05.860]  there's a lot of people that aren't gonna go along with that because they want
[02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:13.340]  raw power now why is this shooting happening clearly the guys very smart
[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:22.180]  it's 4chan 8chan isms and an inside colloquial nomenclature and esoteric
[02:35:22.180 --> 02:35:30.340]  languages of the autistic army to use their own names not belittling those
[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:37.940]  with autism and so whether it's a cutout to demonize that or whether this
[02:35:37.940 --> 02:35:42.620]  person organically came out of that after his world travails his travels I
[02:35:42.620 --> 02:35:48.060]  don't know but he got guns he shouldn't be able to get it was highly organized
[02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:53.340]  and now they're blaming all white people and it's a big smoke screen for all the
[02:35:53.340 --> 02:36:00.840]  things that orthodox radical expansionist Islam is engaged in but the
[02:36:00.840 --> 02:36:04.260]  globalists know that humanity is not going along with learned helplessness
[02:36:04.260 --> 02:36:09.180]  we're not adapting to these paradigms of submission anymore we're actually
[02:36:09.180 --> 02:36:18.020]  adapting and overcoming so looking at the manifesto itself it's posted on
[02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:22.660]  info wars.com Scott one of the great producers went over it you should
[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:25.460]  probably do a video write an article about it because he's made a lot of
[02:36:25.460 --> 02:36:30.260]  good points here but we have a document cam shot for TV viewers the great
[02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:35.580]  replacement and then hiding in plain view is the Nazi black sun symbol the
[02:36:35.580 --> 02:36:39.380]  inner symbol of the inner Nazi party and the occult don't know why I didn't even
[02:36:39.380 --> 02:36:45.260]  notice that probably because it was hiding in plain view and overall it's an
[02:36:45.260 --> 02:36:53.780]  anti capitalist anti decentralized system and when you first begin to turn
[02:36:53.780 --> 02:37:00.980]  into the pages he says I use these firearms because these are firearms
[02:37:00.980 --> 02:37:05.260]  the left trying to ban in the US and I believe that if we can get them to ban
[02:37:05.260 --> 02:37:10.060]  these it will trigger a civil war something with Democrats and even Jack
[02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:17.180]  Dorsey have called for. I can have chosen any weapon or means a TATP filled
[02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:23.060]  renal van household flour method of dispersion and ignition source a
[02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:30.940]  ball peen hammer and a wooden shield gas fire vehicular attack plane attacks by
[02:37:30.940 --> 02:37:36.580]  any means were available I had the will and I had the resources I chose firearms
[02:37:36.580 --> 02:37:41.420]  for the fact that it would have a social discourse the extra media coverage
[02:37:41.420 --> 02:37:46.140]  they would provide the effect it would have on the politics of the United
[02:37:46.140 --> 02:37:50.060]  States and thereby the political situation of the world you see this guy
[02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:54.180]  didn't feel like he had a home as a man to show he was successful that's me to
[02:37:54.180 --> 02:37:58.380]  done this in business but no he had to do it this way the US is torn to many
[02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:02.860]  factions by the Second Amendment along state and social cultural and
[02:38:02.860 --> 02:38:06.780]  importantly racial lines with enough pressure the left wing the United
[02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:12.380]  States will seek to abolish and or attack the very freedom and liberty this
[02:38:12.380 --> 02:38:15.780]  attempt at abolishment of rights by the left will result in a dramatic
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:19.420]  polarization already happens see so now when we talk about what's already
[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:24.220]  happened oh we got it from him this is all written as if like he discovered the
[02:38:24.220 --> 02:38:29.500]  wheel he discovered electricity the attempted abolishment of these rights
[02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:32.940]  for the left will result in a dramatic polarization of the people the United States
[02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:38.500]  and eventually a fracturing of the US along cultural and racial lines well
[02:38:38.500 --> 02:38:42.540]  that's what the WikiLeaks say Hillary needs to do so see he's stating what's
[02:38:42.540 --> 02:38:45.620]  already happened and acting like it's him so it's a form of delusion of
[02:38:45.620 --> 02:38:52.060]  grandeur like I never said I invented 1776 in the Renaissance I said I was
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:56.820]  going to promote it and try to reboot it and our audience together we flip the
[02:38:56.820 --> 02:39:05.700]  switch we score we got it going but to behave like he's triggering all this is
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:09.980]  just as tonight it's already been triggered and then it just goes on from
[02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:18.420]  there where are you as supporter of Donald Trump are you a supporter as a
[02:39:18.420 --> 02:39:23.100]  symbol of renewed white identity which is not what Trump's even doing he's
[02:39:23.100 --> 02:39:28.140]  identity a free market in Americana and unifying see that that's the lie see he
[02:39:28.140 --> 02:39:32.220]  read this this is leftist stuff but professors wrote this among you he had
[02:39:32.220 --> 02:39:36.740]  accomplices this is leftist written as a symbol of renewed white identity and
[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:44.740]  common purpose sure as a policymaker and leader dear god know so you see it's all
[02:39:44.740 --> 02:39:50.300]  meant to create fracture and debate is a particular person that radicalized you
[02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:56.460]  the most now Candace Owens who sat in this studio repeatedly is all about
[02:39:56.460 --> 02:40:00.980]  anti-violence Martin Luther King but oh see it's all cryptic knowing the left
[02:40:00.980 --> 02:40:05.140]  would jump on it persecute her because she doesn't want violence you say she's
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:10.180]  a unifier she's marrying a white guy she's trying to unify everybody is there a
[02:40:10.180 --> 02:40:14.900]  particular person that radicalized you the most yes the person that has
[02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:19.500]  influenced me above all was Candace Owens each time she spoke I was stunned
[02:40:19.500 --> 02:40:23.020]  by her insights in her own views helped push me further and further into the
[02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:30.780]  belief of violence over meekness total sick trolling though I will have to
[02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:35.500]  disavow some of her beliefs the extreme action she calls for too much even for
[02:40:35.500 --> 02:40:42.020]  my taste that is a total satanic inversion of reality this is a left-hand
[02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:51.420]  path devil note unbelievable won't your attack result and calls for removal of
[02:40:51.420 --> 02:40:57.500]  gun rights from whites in the United States yes that's the plan all along you
[02:40:57.500 --> 02:41:02.140]  said you would fight to protect your rights of the Constitution well soon
[02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:06.740]  will come the time that's what I keep telling people you better fight

[02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:56.140]  whole so-called manifesto this was the Navy Seal copypasta folks that know what
[02:47:56.140 --> 02:48:02.380]  that is this is all just internet jokes but then it continues why attack
[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:08.220]  Muslims if all high fertility immigrants are the issue historically
[02:48:08.220 --> 02:48:12.460]  societally and statistical reasons there are the most despised group of
[02:48:12.460 --> 02:48:16.060]  invaders in the West attacking them receives the greatest level of support
[02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:20.420]  they are also one of the strongest groups with a high fertility rate in group
[02:48:20.420 --> 02:48:26.660]  preference and will to conquer so that's a true statement why focus on
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:30.380]  immigration and birth rates for climate change is such a huge issue so he has
[02:48:30.380 --> 02:48:33.540]  the whole leftist propaganda there because they are the same issue the
[02:48:33.540 --> 02:48:37.260]  environment is being destroyed by overpopulation we Europeans are one of
[02:48:37.260 --> 02:48:40.860]  the groups that is not overpopulated the world the invaders are the ones
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:44.300]  overpopulated the world kill the invaders kill the overpopulation and by
[02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:48.140]  doing so save the environment well that's Dick Cheney and use race specific
[02:48:48.140 --> 02:48:52.940]  weapons and wipe out the third world so see he's he's showing you and teaching
[02:48:52.940 --> 02:48:58.660]  you here what the plan is well then why does the Western elite want to get rid
[02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:03.980]  of the West that actually isn't overpopulating so this is just all a
[02:49:03.980 --> 02:49:11.820]  call for global civil war out of which comes the one-world government he was
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:18.740]  on to say conservatism is dead thank God to Christians and he has some quotes
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:23.660]  there to anti from Marxist communist I do not want to convert you and I don't
[02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:27.060]  want to come to your understanding the Gallitarians and those that believe in
[02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:32.420]  hierarchy will ever come to terms I don't want you by my side I don't want to
[02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:37.780]  share power I want you in my sights I want your neck under my boot see you on
[02:49:37.780 --> 02:49:43.100]  the streets you anti white scum so it makes them at the end the poor little
[02:49:43.100 --> 02:49:47.860]  antifa violent victims a bunch of professors dressed up attacking people
[02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:51.940]  who actually want global depopulation as well I believe in global warming to
[02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:56.860]  Turks we can live in peace in your own lands you may it may no harm come to you
[02:49:56.860 --> 02:50:01.740]  on the east side of the Bosphorus but if you attempt to live in European lands
[02:50:01.740 --> 02:50:06.660]  anywhere west of the Bosphorus we will kill you and drive your roaches from our
[02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:11.580]  lands you are coming for Constance noble we will destroy every mosque and
[02:50:11.580 --> 02:50:17.620]  minaret in the city so this is going to retake Constance noble and it goes on
[02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:23.460]  from there so this is it meant to ignite a global religious and race war
[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:29.620]  section two general thoughts and potential strategies so this is the
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:34.500]  globalist trying to trigger international war kind of like in 1984 the
[02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:38.740]  inner party gives Winston a system of rebellion and propaganda to actually
[02:50:38.740 --> 02:50:43.140]  create a false resistance so they have an excuse just to persecute the rape of
[02:50:43.140 --> 02:50:51.500]  European women and then it just goes into all this at the end at the very end
[02:50:51.500 --> 02:50:57.980]  of it he talks about quote the USA and all the rest of it a boiling over in the
[02:50:57.980 --> 02:51:03.360]  melting pot civil war and the so-called melting pot is the United States would
[02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:07.260]  be a major aim of overthrowing the global power structure of the West
[02:51:07.260 --> 02:51:12.620]  egalitarian individualist globalist dominant culture no the globalist have
[02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:21.220]  hijacked the egalitarian Renaissance Christian West the United States is in
[02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:25.020]  turmoil more so than any other time in history because the left's using race to
[02:51:25.020 --> 02:51:29.860]  divide to the WikiLeaks the United States is in turmoil more so than any
[02:51:29.860 --> 02:51:34.020]  other time in history states have other states the electoral college is under
[02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:37.660]  attack at every term and the races reach other throats
[02:51:37.660 --> 02:51:42.100]  now the media says that on top of all this a two-party political system split
[02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:48.220]  by racial societal cultural linguistic and class divides after an election
[02:51:48.220 --> 02:51:52.500]  cycle of two with certain democratic victory those remaining non-democratic
[02:51:52.500 --> 02:51:57.780]  voting non brainwash whites will see the future clear before them and with this
[02:51:57.780 --> 02:52:01.660]  knowledge realize the impossibility of diplomatic or political victory and he
[02:52:01.660 --> 02:52:05.260]  believes he'll be let out of prison 27 years from now after the global race war
[02:52:05.260 --> 02:52:10.260]  the bio weapons are released and all the minorities are wiped out and so they
[02:52:10.260 --> 02:52:12.980]  released the bio weapons they'll claim some scientists that followed this guy
[02:52:12.980 --> 02:52:16.820]  released it but it won't be the scientist randomly doing it will be a
[02:52:16.820 --> 02:52:23.260]  larger plan and that's basically where this satanic programs going people from
[02:52:23.260 --> 02:52:28.260]  Charlie Manson to this fellow want to trigger a civil war so to Theodore
[02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:33.100]  Kaczynski trained by the CIA this is a larger plan by criminals inside our
[02:52:33.100 --> 02:52:38.020]  government not whole agencies but select groups and that's the bottom line and
[02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:41.340]  they use anonymous systems not the four-channer HNR bad they just use
[02:52:41.340 --> 02:52:45.460]  anonymous systems where they can put this out so that they can't be tracked
[02:52:45.460 --> 02:52:50.380]  which again I believe in freedom of speech but I'm being censored so I can't
[02:52:50.380 --> 02:52:55.140]  encounter them what does that tell you okay let's continue with some phone

[02:53:52.020 --> 02:54:00.580]  talk to who's been holding longest here let's talk to Catherine in Canada or is
[02:54:00.580 --> 02:54:03.980]  that Catherine my eyes aren't as good as they used to be Catherine go ahead it's
[02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:08.140]  Catherine welcome from Canada okay I just wanted to point out a weird
[02:54:08.140 --> 02:54:12.620]  coincidence there's an article in the New Zealand Herald from March 11th
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:17.940]  headline read former White House advisor John Podesta praises superstar
[02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:22.700]  Prime Minister just in the Ardern which is the New Zealand Prime Minister and in
[02:54:22.700 --> 02:54:26.700]  the article she says he says that the Democrat should take a leap from the
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:30.980]  New Zealand Prime Minister and as well as fascist the Trump administration so I
[02:54:30.980 --> 02:54:34.860]  think that's a weird coincidence that March 11th John Podesta is in the New
[02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:37.780]  Zealand Herald and now this is happening I don't know if it's connected of course
[02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:42.340]  but it's just a weird quiz coincidence no I agree with you what do you think
[02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:45.980]  about him getting guns that nobody else can get in New Zealand I mean well that's
[02:54:45.980 --> 02:54:50.020]  huge is suspicious that's the thing there's there's demo like prominent
[02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:54.380]  Democrats in New Zealand March 11th and then this happens March 14th but where
[02:54:54.380 --> 02:55:00.340]  are the guns coming from fast and furious bring a bell like we're gonna be
[02:55:00.340 --> 02:55:03.700]  following that we're gonna be following that Catherine call us back and thanks
[02:55:03.700 --> 02:55:06.860]  for holding you're awesome we can take a lot of phone calls the problem is there's
[02:55:06.860 --> 02:55:10.380]  not a lot of time for each person but you're awesome let's go ahead and take
[02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:15.180]  another call here let's talk to Paul in Las Vegas so you're on the air go ahead
[02:55:15.180 --> 02:55:20.020]  Paul yeah Alex for taking my call one of the things I wanted to point out is that
[02:55:20.020 --> 02:55:23.500]  they try to take her guns Americans are so innovative they will come up with
[02:55:23.500 --> 02:55:27.980]  electric weapons that will absolutely put the firearms that we have now in the
[02:55:27.980 --> 02:55:33.100]  antique zone I built hydrogen fuel cells and I could send a brick at yet 4,000
[02:55:33.100 --> 02:55:36.540]  feet per second it's a you know you could fire anything with it it doesn't
[02:55:36.540 --> 02:55:40.020]  have to have gunpowder and things like that so if they try to take her guns
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:43.540]  they're gonna be in real trouble let's remember a ball peen hammer can take
[02:55:43.540 --> 02:55:48.740]  away all the guns you want so you but they want to kill gun culture it's the
[02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:52.260]  use of firearms the system hates and and we're way ahead of them they're
[02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:56.340]  losing yeah I want to give a real quick plug for my good fun me I'm trying to
[02:55:56.340 --> 02:56:00.820]  get the funds for the lawyers and things like that to finish my patent my
[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:04.260]  name is Dan Frank from on Facebook if there's some of the best hydrogen fuel
[02:56:04.260 --> 02:56:07.260]  cells you're gonna get and I thought of them while I was taking your brain force
[02:56:07.260 --> 02:56:11.020]  so if you don't have your products out there people get get the brain force get
[02:56:11.020 --> 02:56:14.260]  the alpha power get all this stuff because it really works are fantastic
[02:56:14.260 --> 02:56:17.220]  well send me an email about this fuel source and I got to move quick to these
[02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:22.580]  calls I do guess coming up but I want to get to everybody let's talk to Jacob in
[02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:26.500]  Colorado Jacob you're on the air thanks for holding
[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:33.820]  hey good talk to you so my point is that how many people were killed in New
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:40.740]  Zealand was around 50 or something like that say that again how many people were
[02:56:40.740 --> 02:56:48.100]  killed in New Zealand they're saying 49 or more okay my point is in 2018 there
[02:56:48.100 --> 02:56:56.380]  was 4,136 Christians killed according to the world watch list 2019 and there was
[02:56:56.380 --> 02:57:04.420]  also 1266 churches yeah we're all no I agree it's it's thousands of churches
[02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:08.020]  have been bombed or shot by radical Islam you never hear about it it's back
[02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:11.420]  of the paper and then I think this is a terrible event but notice the media is
[02:57:11.420 --> 02:57:15.100]  maximizing it because they want you to know about it and Western guilt I
[02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:20.220]  totally agree with you so by talking about this thing in New Zealand we're
[02:57:20.220 --> 02:57:26.860]  just basically following the Marxist agenda by no I get your point but see
[02:57:26.860 --> 02:57:29.820]  they're gonna just put it out there with their spin we have to cover it to
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:33.580]  counter it to create the counter narrative I mean I'm not even creating a
[02:57:33.580 --> 02:57:36.460]  counter narrative I'm just debating different angles but I hear you Jacob

[02:57:42.180 --> 02:57:47.700]  are all coming up in two minutes the globalist the eugenicists are always
[02:57:47.700 --> 02:57:52.980]  talking down to us they're always trying to make us feel small to feel
[02:57:52.980 --> 02:57:57.620]  insignificant they try to censor because they fear you and don't want you to have
[02:57:57.620 --> 02:58:02.540]  the right to access information so you can make your own decisions they want
[02:58:02.540 --> 02:58:07.260]  you to believe you're powerless but the truth is it is we the people and our
[02:58:07.260 --> 02:58:13.420]  ideas and our actions and what we say and what we do that changes the world we
[02:58:13.420 --> 02:58:18.220]  are the power structure we are the inventors we are the trailblazers and
[02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:24.940]  the globalists understand that and they understand that they are basically
[02:58:24.940 --> 02:58:30.340]  trying to control and steal the future from we the people now to help fund our
[02:58:30.340 --> 02:58:33.380]  operation is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalist I

[02:59:46.300 --> 03:00:02.700]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:09.700 --> 03:00:12.700]  okay whenever we get a caller from New Zealand they go to the head of the line
[03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:15.380]  today we'll get the rest of your calls coming up we appreciate all of you you're
[03:00:15.380 --> 03:00:19.180]  awesome and I feel so guilty because we'll get like 30 calls and then there's
[03:00:19.180 --> 03:00:22.620]  no way even an hour to get to them all that's so bad we don't get to you but
[03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:25.900]  I'm trying we got a bunch of guests backed up we're like 30 minutes behind
[03:00:25.900 --> 03:00:29.260]  today I've moved back about our Nick baggage about 30 minutes so I get these
[03:00:29.260 --> 03:00:35.100]  other guests we have a special guest joining us next segment but rod in New
[03:00:35.100 --> 03:00:38.420]  Zealand are you in the north island the south island and what is your take
[03:00:38.420 --> 03:00:42.180]  about this bizarre horrible tragedy all our prayers go out to those poor
[03:00:42.180 --> 03:00:47.140]  Muslims that were killed yeah no it's pretty appalling Alex and great to be
[03:00:47.140 --> 03:00:51.380]  able to talk to you listen to your show on a very regular basis and that is a
[03:00:51.380 --> 03:00:57.540]  tragic event obviously and one point I was thinking about as to why the the
[03:00:57.540 --> 03:01:02.540]  guy might have chosen New Zealand is because life imprisonment here is only
[03:01:02.540 --> 03:01:07.340]  14 years for murder and if you get out on good behavior then he might be in for
[03:01:07.340 --> 03:01:11.820]  eight years big deal unless they can prove insanity or something else and they
[03:01:11.820 --> 03:01:16.580]  can hold them for you know an extended period of time
[03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:22.740]  no man I agree with you what else is your gut tell you what are local saying
[03:01:22.740 --> 03:01:30.020]  well it's certainly you know like other callers and the media saying it's very
[03:01:30.020 --> 03:01:35.020]  uncharacteristic country I don't think it will change much here I think it
[03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:38.500]  sounds like what you've been reading from the manifesto that trying to create a
[03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:44.540]  bigger impact you know within America and other places by proving as he said
[03:01:44.540 --> 03:01:50.180]  that you know New Zealand being so remote is not immune to this sort of thing
[03:01:50.180 --> 03:01:55.220]  and by the time I did wonder if you know partly the reason because they didn't
[03:01:55.220 --> 03:02:00.700]  shoot him he basically gave himself up I think and so he'll get to live and
[03:02:00.700 --> 03:02:05.260]  survive and possibly be running around another eight years who knows unless
[03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:09.420]  they can prove you know really insane or whatever will clear what is your gut
[03:02:09.420 --> 03:02:13.180]  tell you because I read this thing and this this is all nationalism a lot of
[03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:16.460]  it's true now anytime anybody he's saying everything a lot of people have
[03:02:16.460 --> 03:02:20.580]  already said makes it with a bunch of crap and lies so now we talk about it's
[03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:23.460]  okay to be sovereign it's okay to have your own country it's okay to have your
[03:02:23.460 --> 03:02:27.660]  own culture now this mass murderer said it so we're all supposedly getting our
[03:02:27.660 --> 03:02:35.420]  orders from him yeah no it's obviously he's trying to make a bigger impact you
[03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:41.380]  know around the place but for us here in New Zealand it's we have a very broad
[03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:46.460]  representation of races and cultures and all the rest of it here and it is a
[03:02:46.460 --> 03:02:51.580]  pretty very peaceful country to live in as people have stated that it's not easy
[03:02:51.580 --> 03:02:56.420]  to own guns here but he's obviously got a weapon the weapons were legal
[03:02:56.420 --> 03:03:00.660]  some magazines went that he was using so he's got connections I think you're
[03:03:00.660 --> 03:03:04.660]  quite right Alex yeah they're gonna use this to crack down look I bet money he's
[03:03:04.660 --> 03:03:08.860]  in a cult and he had support just like the hellbop people yeah there's all
[03:03:08.860 --> 03:03:12.700]  sorts of cults and I bet money it's gonna come out if we see a cover-up then
[03:03:12.700 --> 03:03:16.620]  we know it stinks to high heaven great points rod from New Zealand anything
[03:03:16.620 --> 03:03:22.260]  else I know that'll be all for today Alex appreciate you calling in and what
[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:29.140]  is it like 8 in the morning there 7 in the morning all right he's gone okay we
[03:03:29.140 --> 03:03:32.340]  got Chuck in Nevada that's a little closer let's go to Chuck in Nevada you're
[03:03:32.340 --> 03:03:38.580]  on the air welcome hi nice to speak to you Alex you know there's nothing that
[03:03:38.580 --> 03:03:41.740]  seems organic about any of this I think you hit the nail on the head a couple of
[03:03:41.740 --> 03:03:46.540]  breaks ago when you went into break as far as far as just being a coordinated
[03:03:46.540 --> 03:03:51.060]  or possibly being a coordinated effort I don't think it's a it's an accident that
[03:03:51.060 --> 03:03:56.060]  Facebook was down for two days and as soon as it comes up this event is
[03:03:56.060 --> 03:04:02.340]  streamed live on it with probably the highest audience available as you know
[03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:06.820]  you take restrict restrict somebody from getting to their Facebook page for a
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:10.340]  day and they're like a rabbit animal trying to get on there get as much you
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:15.060]  know find out what they missed so I think they had a massive audience
[03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:17.940]  everything about this plays out like a Hollywood screenplay when you showed the
[03:04:17.940 --> 03:04:21.860]  couple of clips you did hold on stay there your points are so powerful I want
[03:04:21.860 --> 03:04:24.500]  you to come back and say that again because Facebook and other major
[03:04:24.500 --> 03:04:29.660]  platforms have been down for days comes back up and then this happens and it
[03:04:29.660 --> 03:04:34.100]  just has Psiop written all over it it's the Ides of March when this happened
[03:04:34.100 --> 03:04:37.580]  which is I've been predicting something big what happened there the global
[03:04:37.580 --> 03:04:41.100]  successful days stay there Chuck and then we're gonna have a special guest pop
[03:04:41.100 --> 03:04:48.020]  in then Millie Weaver then Dr. Nick baggage more of your calls it's all coming up
[03:04:53.500 --> 03:05:00.180]  I've got some really good news though X-Coos back the original X-2 deep
[03:05:00.180 --> 03:05:05.660]  breath crystal pure atomic iodine what you want in four store.com it'll be here
[03:05:05.660 --> 03:05:10.180]  in a week manufactured in the US in four store.com with the best iodine in the
[03:05:10.180 --> 03:05:14.260]  world X-2 it's available I thought X-3 is great we still got another deep breath
[03:05:14.260 --> 03:05:17.580]  crystal source but I thought at the other two types of iodine the scientists
[03:05:17.580 --> 03:05:22.380]  that do that it sold a lot that people want original X-2 I was resigned the
[03:05:22.380 --> 03:05:25.980]  fact we didn't have X-2 but it came through about a month ago we now have
[03:05:25.980 --> 03:05:30.460]  X-2 again and in four store.com so hallelujah it's been sold out for about
[03:05:30.460 --> 03:05:36.220]  almost three months that we have now have the same company the original X-2
[03:05:36.220 --> 03:05:42.500]  develop it again and we were able to do the exact same formula when a pre-order
[03:05:42.500 --> 03:05:46.700]  X-2 the ultimate iodine out there learn about the iodine conspiracy learn about
[03:05:46.700 --> 03:05:49.580]  IQ is dropping when you don't have it learn about how the other iodines are
[03:05:49.580 --> 03:05:55.300]  bound get yours today at infowarstore.com or m4slife.com
[03:05:55.300 --> 03:06:10.380]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show all
[03:06:10.380 --> 03:06:13.460]  right we're talking to Chuck and Devato I'm gonna recap what he said because some
[03:06:13.460 --> 03:06:16.900]  people might not have been tuned in Facebook for the first time in its
[03:06:16.900 --> 03:06:20.860]  tenure history goes down for a couple days comes back up everyone I knew was
[03:06:20.860 --> 03:06:24.540]  like piranhas it's not up it's down we're all constantly checking it
[03:06:24.540 --> 03:06:28.820]  suddenly rise it goes back up this happens this guy gets a maximum audience
[03:06:28.820 --> 03:06:34.860]  he's got this classic globalist playbook to create race war which the
[03:06:34.860 --> 03:06:38.860]  Council on Foreign Relations all of them call for it's crazy then we're gonna go
[03:06:38.860 --> 03:06:45.420]  to John Abiskaran and a really smart fellow who I got a chance to interview
[03:06:45.420 --> 03:06:49.500]  about a year ago he's a Coptic Christian formerly lived in Egypt he'll give us
[03:06:49.500 --> 03:06:53.340]  his take on this and then we were pops in and I appreciate her doing that but
[03:06:53.340 --> 03:06:57.420]  Chuck and Devato recap what you said and finish up well yeah basically it was
[03:06:57.420 --> 03:07:00.980]  just the idea that but with Facebook being down right see it comes back up
[03:07:00.980 --> 03:07:07.500]  and we all know unfortunately how obsessed people are with that forum the
[03:07:07.500 --> 03:07:10.500]  I just would have loved to have known the numbers when I came back up and in
[03:07:10.500 --> 03:07:13.380]  the time period that this was taking place you have this live stream taken
[03:07:13.380 --> 03:07:18.540]  taking place right when when it comes back I mean the audience must have been
[03:07:18.540 --> 03:07:22.380]  massive but everything everything about it like I said just a couple of clips
[03:07:22.380 --> 03:07:26.580]  you showed of him in his car and then walking to do this it just it all plays
[03:07:26.580 --> 03:07:30.620]  out like a screenplay the manifesto Matt Bracken mentioned that how
[03:07:30.620 --> 03:07:34.260]  articulate and how intelligent it's written and the guys got a high IQ but
[03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:38.300]  I don't even think the guy wrote it I think it was I mean it's just that there's
[03:07:38.300 --> 03:07:44.460]  too many points that hit there to kill the national mentality you know being a
[03:07:44.460 --> 03:07:47.900]  nationalist or being proud about your country and then hitting me you know if
[03:07:47.900 --> 03:07:52.460]  for anti-second amendment people I mean it's just so many things just pounds
[03:07:52.460 --> 03:07:57.460]  everything and you've been predicting for for a while now that the globalist
[03:07:57.460 --> 03:08:01.220]  need an event they need something to take it to the next level it's just I've
[03:08:01.220 --> 03:08:05.100]  been saying I expect a tax on monster imminent the way and also mainstream
[03:08:05.100 --> 03:08:08.740]  media and again the way the media is covering it the way it's getting so
[03:08:08.740 --> 03:08:13.780]  much coverage this is the perfect thing also get weak minded people to actually
[03:08:13.780 --> 03:08:18.180]  lash out the left can't believe that Christians and conservatives and others
[03:08:18.180 --> 03:08:22.020]  have not been racist despite all the leftist race baiting they can't believe
[03:08:22.020 --> 03:08:25.340]  we haven't lashed out they can't believe we haven't taken the bait and that's
[03:08:25.340 --> 03:08:31.100]  why they're panicking great points Chuck all right John Obiskaron he's named
[03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:36.020]  after a famous Christian that was killed by the pagans so fella I ran into on a
[03:08:36.020 --> 03:08:39.500]  vacation I looked him up he's been involved in a lot of big movies and
[03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:43.060]  Hollywood production that got out of it because it was so evil and moved his
[03:08:43.060 --> 03:08:46.140]  family out of that and you know he's worked a lot of big pastors around the
[03:08:46.140 --> 03:08:49.860]  country doesn't call himself a pastor but I do and because he's formerly from
[03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:53.540]  Egypt and a great American and he's been predicting so much of this global
[03:08:53.540 --> 03:08:57.620]  crisis I wanted to get him to briefly pop in inviting back as a full gas soon to
[03:08:57.620 --> 03:09:01.500]  get into more but John Obiskaron thanks for taking time out to join us and give
[03:09:01.500 --> 03:09:05.940]  us your your view on what's happened with this sad attack with these poor
[03:09:05.940 --> 03:09:14.220]  Muslims being killed in New Zealand yeah it's a it's a real tragedy of course
[03:09:14.220 --> 03:09:18.940]  it's really bad and if you've seen the video anybody's ever seen the video it
[03:09:18.940 --> 03:09:24.140]  it's really graphic and this guy goes in there and kills all these innocent
[03:09:24.140 --> 03:09:29.300]  people that are just at a mosque praying and we actually we absolutely have to
[03:09:29.300 --> 03:09:33.580]  condemn the event what happened obviously the problem is though is the
[03:09:33.580 --> 03:09:39.460]  response the response from the global media with with this event and you're
[03:09:39.460 --> 03:09:42.900]  right you've been talking about this about how they're just trying to grasp
[03:09:42.900 --> 03:09:47.820]  the straws and you just said before I came on yeah the way that Christians and
[03:09:47.820 --> 03:09:52.660]  conservatives we when we were when we are attacked and persecuted and of course
[03:09:52.660 --> 03:09:56.820]  there's a long history of Christians being persecuted all over the world and
[03:09:56.820 --> 03:10:01.780]  and we're being persecuted here in America too by the way it's not as
[03:10:01.780 --> 03:10:05.740]  graphic and bloody but it's persecution in a completely different way that
[03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:08.940]  taking away our First Amendment rights they want to they don't want us to be in
[03:10:08.940 --> 03:10:12.620]  the political realm so they don't want us to have a voice we can't be pro-life
[03:10:12.620 --> 03:10:16.460]  exactly I mean you've got thousands of churches blown up the last few days on
[03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:19.940]  bomb Sunday and on Christmas and on Easter it barely even makes the news
[03:10:19.940 --> 03:10:23.540]  that's my point every time a Christian church is blown up or Christians in
[03:10:23.540 --> 03:10:28.260]  Germany get run over on Christmas Eve let's talk about how was this Islamic
[03:10:28.260 --> 03:10:32.540]  attack on Christians I'm all against what happened here it's terrible but what
[03:10:32.540 --> 03:10:39.220]  we need to see here all these Muslim leaders decry those because I agree we
[03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:44.860]  should decry this attack yes in fact we should we should decry this attack the
[03:10:44.860 --> 03:10:50.140]  way we are and the way that the global media is decrying this attack they should
[03:10:50.140 --> 03:10:57.180]  be decrying the same way at the same level at the same zealousness when any
[03:10:57.180 --> 03:11:01.260]  Christian persecution happens which is happening all the time but it's never
[03:11:01.260 --> 03:11:06.300]  talked about it's never focused on it's in a very glaring bias and I think the
[03:11:06.300 --> 03:11:09.820]  average person is starting to see it especially like today I think that the
[03:11:09.820 --> 03:11:12.900]  way they're reacting today is actually gonna backfire on them in the long run
[03:11:12.900 --> 03:11:17.180]  it's obvious it's obvious what they're doing they're trying to add to what this
[03:11:17.180 --> 03:11:21.100]  gunman is you know reading the gunman's manifesto first of all he made it very
[03:11:21.100 --> 03:11:25.420]  clear he is not a conservative he is not a Christian he is just a guy that's
[03:11:25.420 --> 03:11:29.700]  upset about actually all his talking points he sounded more like he's a
[03:11:29.700 --> 03:11:34.060]  leftist but he wants to start a civil war right that's what he wants he wants
[03:11:34.060 --> 03:11:37.780]  to start this device and that's what Charlie Manson why do these evil people
[03:11:37.780 --> 03:11:41.660]  want a global race war because they don't want to make it about God and about the
[03:11:41.660 --> 03:11:45.580]  spirit or about a free market system or about ideas they want to make it about
[03:11:45.580 --> 03:11:50.100]  color they want to make it about color they want to make it about anything they
[03:11:50.100 --> 03:11:53.860]  can't they just want the war do you know why this is all tied in with the new
[03:11:53.860 --> 03:11:57.220]  world order obviously I'm not saying this guy's part of the new order I'm
[03:11:57.220 --> 03:11:59.980]  saying that you know what you're talking about tell folks what you think is
[03:11:59.980 --> 03:12:05.940]  going on well obviously I think that first of all with the globalist there's
[03:12:05.940 --> 03:12:10.340]  the obvious and agenda to make a one-world governing okay and anybody who
[03:12:10.340 --> 03:12:14.700]  looks into this and just looks into the new world order there's a plethora of
[03:12:14.700 --> 03:12:18.660]  information about it everywhere you just dig in a little bit and see that it's
[03:12:18.660 --> 03:12:23.460]  very obvious that we've got a new order that's been trying to take place and the
[03:12:23.460 --> 03:12:27.780]  one thing in the way of them is the West you can't have a one-world government
[03:12:27.780 --> 03:12:31.580]  with a big boy in the neighborhood like America in the way so we've been seeing
[03:12:31.580 --> 03:12:38.180]  the systematic purpose the purposeful destruction of our system of our free
[03:12:38.180 --> 03:12:42.740]  market and free America system because if they could bring America down and
[03:12:42.740 --> 03:12:46.860]  check then they could easily bring in the new world order what we're seeing as a
[03:12:46.860 --> 03:12:51.220]  resistance from it the rise of bread Brexit with a huge blow to the new world
[03:12:51.220 --> 03:12:54.620]  order and the rise of Trump honestly because Trump everything he's been
[03:12:54.620 --> 03:13:00.100]  doing has been to basically cycle if not stop the new world order agenda and to
[03:13:00.100 --> 03:13:04.620]  bring it that's why this is a battle of nationalism versus globalism so if you
[03:13:04.620 --> 03:13:08.260]  can't get any more nationalism and I mean patriotic nationalist by the way
[03:13:08.260 --> 03:13:13.180]  then make America great again Donald Trump exactly and when we talk for hours
[03:13:13.180 --> 03:13:16.420]  when I met met you over the few days in Hawaii and your great family and your
[03:13:16.420 --> 03:13:20.300]  wife and my wife and all the rest of you are great kids but in Europe's calm on
[03:13:20.300 --> 03:13:24.380]  air and a little bit reserved but you're on fire in person you really said a lot
[03:13:24.380 --> 03:13:28.220]  of really smart things you predicted a lot of what was coming but I mean I think
[03:13:28.220 --> 03:13:32.900]  the global system is panicking because they're losing and and they'll get
[03:13:32.900 --> 03:13:36.300]  their antichrist in but kind of like things collapse right as he takes the
[03:13:36.300 --> 03:13:39.900]  throne he never really has the power they do everything they can they lose
[03:13:39.900 --> 03:13:44.820]  they only has power for for a day I mean and that means I guess a year in the
[03:13:44.820 --> 03:13:51.620]  time of the Bible yes well but yes we're in a referee Alex you realize that I
[03:13:51.620 --> 03:13:55.300]  really see it that way I mean it's not an accident what's happening you're
[03:13:55.300 --> 03:14:00.380]  seeing the fight it's a resistance it's not just the globalist raping the system
[03:14:00.380 --> 03:14:04.220]  and raping the people anymore what you're seeing is a resistance back and
[03:14:04.220 --> 03:14:09.140]  it's from God I'm telling you he's given us a referee he's saying no there's new
[03:14:09.140 --> 03:14:12.340]  world order thing it's not gonna happen right now it's gonna happen on my
[03:14:12.340 --> 03:14:16.140]  timeline because I'm the Lord and sovereign of this world and not on their
[03:14:16.140 --> 03:14:21.460]  timeline not on the enemy's timeline so what with with with Trump coming in
[03:14:21.460 --> 03:14:24.780]  first of all we talked about this before I mean it was a miracle that Donald
[03:14:24.780 --> 03:14:28.060]  Trump won especially with the system in the globalist that was definitely a
[03:14:28.060 --> 03:14:31.300]  miracle we're doing yeah the cheating that they were doing by the way there's
[03:14:31.300 --> 03:14:35.500]  gonna be a lot more about that coming up it's going to become mainstream the
[03:14:35.500 --> 03:14:38.700]  amount of cheating that they've been doing in our voter in our voting system
[03:14:38.700 --> 03:14:42.540]  not only this last election and the 2016 when they tried to cheat to make
[03:14:42.540 --> 03:14:46.140]  Hillary win but they've been cheating all along and that's going to be a big
[03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:49.740]  talking point that's going to be coming up okay but you see that's going to be
[03:14:49.740 --> 03:14:54.860]  revealed because it has to because we the system the fact is the number one
[03:14:54.860 --> 03:14:59.420]  weapon all this time has been secrecy being able to do all of this right and
[03:14:59.420 --> 03:15:03.020]  all the secrecy like you told me here ago is going to be exposed it's gone
[03:15:03.020 --> 03:15:07.460]  come back next week for a full hour John via Skype we love you we appreciate you

[03:15:17.060 --> 03:15:21.460]  believe the third century and he was a warrior saying he was a warrior than the
[03:15:21.460 --> 03:15:24.700]  in the Roman Empire and what happened was when they discovered that he was a
[03:15:24.700 --> 03:15:31.300]  Christian they basically took his rank and and threatened him with imprisonment
[03:15:31.300 --> 03:15:34.300]  and he still refused they imprisoned him they eventually tortured him and
[03:15:34.300 --> 03:15:39.220]  eventually he resisted the whole time all he had to do was the now spike that's
[03:15:39.220 --> 03:15:43.180]  all they had to do and they tortured him and then they eventually killed him and
[03:15:43.180 --> 03:15:46.540]  he's a thing because of that because he stood his ground until the very last
[03:15:46.540 --> 03:15:50.060]  and you got a really cool name out of Egypt that used to be Christian we'll

[03:17:53.860 --> 03:17:59.580]  the globalist the eugenicists are always talking down to us they're always
[03:17:59.580 --> 03:18:05.020]  trying to make us feel small to feel insignificant they try to censor because
[03:18:05.020 --> 03:18:09.300]  they fear you and don't want you to have the right to access information so you
[03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:14.700]  can make your own decisions they want you to believe you're powerless but the
[03:18:14.700 --> 03:18:19.980]  truth is it is we the people and our ideas and our actions and what we say
[03:18:19.980 --> 03:18:25.060]  and what we do that changes the world we are the power structure we are the
[03:18:25.060 --> 03:18:31.500]  inventors we are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they
[03:18:31.500 --> 03:18:36.220]  understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future
[03:18:36.220 --> 03:18:41.020]  from we the people now to help fund our operation is undoubtedly the very tip of
[03:18:41.020 --> 03:18:44.700]  the spear against these globalist I want to encourage listeners and viewers to

[03:20:28.860 --> 03:20:33.300]  have Nick Begich he's always got a lot to cover then the war room starts and we
[03:20:33.300 --> 03:20:37.580]  had a lot of the big news we covered some of it but the big news is this mosque
[03:20:37.580 --> 03:20:42.140]  attack this bizarre manifesto the Ides of March where the media has responded
[03:20:42.140 --> 03:20:47.140]  Facebook being down it goes back up this goes out it's really bizarre Millie
[03:20:47.140 --> 03:20:52.820]  Weaver is our guest here InfoWars.com reporter and Millie I appreciate you
[03:20:52.820 --> 03:20:55.340]  coming on over about 30 minutes behind today so I appreciate you holding
[03:20:55.340 --> 03:20:58.820]  congratulations on the birth of your new child your two great children and your
[03:20:58.820 --> 03:21:04.580]  great husband but the time we have you've got big analysis on the shooting in
[03:21:04.580 --> 03:21:08.620]  New Zealand and how it ties in to you guys your infiltration of some of these
[03:21:08.620 --> 03:21:11.940]  leftist groups show and we're gonna have more of that obviously next week and then
[03:21:11.940 --> 03:21:17.020]  this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. but that tell us more about it now okay so we had an
[03:21:17.020 --> 03:21:22.340]  undercover infiltrate a leftist troll farm the last week and what's
[03:21:22.340 --> 03:21:27.420]  interesting is this troll farm was getting actual directives on how to sow
[03:21:27.420 --> 03:21:32.340]  division and discontent amongst the Trump base and kind of pushed people
[03:21:32.340 --> 03:21:38.940]  into the Yang direction but also so anti-Jewish propaganda out there and kind
[03:21:38.940 --> 03:21:45.580]  of pro-Muslim propaganda so what was crazy is that we saw all of these attacks
[03:21:45.580 --> 03:21:51.980]  happening and then this attack happens in New Zealand and it completely mixes in
[03:21:51.980 --> 03:21:56.900]  and fits exactly what some of their directives were in this troll farm and
[03:21:56.900 --> 03:22:03.500]  actually Oliver Darcy his response to this New Zealand shooting fit completely
[03:22:03.500 --> 03:22:07.860]  into this directive and I'm gonna be putting a report this week on this
[03:22:07.860 --> 03:22:11.300]  spelling it all out there's a lot of information details that I want to go
[03:22:11.300 --> 03:22:16.060]  over here on this so that'll be on my report on Millennial Millie but one of
[03:22:16.060 --> 03:22:20.700]  the directives it says is color the website as hateful by pushing over the
[03:22:20.700 --> 03:22:26.020]  top racist and divisive posts that make no real contribution so you have a leftist
[03:22:26.020 --> 03:22:32.220]  accounts leftist users who are going on sites like info wars or whatever else
[03:22:32.220 --> 03:22:38.660]  creating alt-right racist accounts and putting racial comments and posts to give
[03:22:38.660 --> 03:22:43.060]  the idea that they are a racist platform really this is so huge that you're
[03:22:43.060 --> 03:22:47.940]  about to release this footage yes how soon because Oliver we don't do our own
[03:22:47.940 --> 03:22:51.500]  comments anymore because we used to get subpoenas for threats that people made
[03:22:51.500 --> 03:22:54.620]  and stuff I said hey we'll go with discuss us and you know now we have
[03:22:54.620 --> 03:22:57.660]  vocal all this other stuff we've got a new thing we're testing out but we have
[03:22:57.660 --> 03:23:01.700]  third parties do it there's a liability but you still I'd go man this is a black
[03:23:01.700 --> 03:23:05.900]  guy saying he hates white people a white guy saying it's black people a Mexican
[03:23:05.900 --> 03:23:10.140]  saying he says that and went looking up it was the same IP addresses so that was
[03:23:10.140 --> 03:23:13.700]  like seven years ago so you're saying you've got the proof of their pulling
[03:23:13.700 --> 03:23:17.820]  this crap and then all we are see that snake says shut down info wars they've
[03:23:17.820 --> 03:23:22.500]  got racist commenters that's right Oliver Darcy tweeted out today after this
[03:23:22.500 --> 03:23:27.820]  New Zealand attack essentially pointing the finger at info wars bright part
[03:23:27.820 --> 03:23:32.100]  gateway pundit this is his tweet he says you don't have to go to places like
[03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:36.940]  4chan to see vile racist commentary just go to some of the far-right websites in
[03:23:36.940 --> 03:23:41.140]  the US and look at the comments message boards bright part gateway pundit info
[03:23:41.140 --> 03:23:47.460]  wars many reprehensible comments from users on stories regarding the New Zealand
[03:23:47.460 --> 03:23:53.180]  attack so he's pointing the finger here now at the websites of info wars and
[03:23:53.180 --> 03:23:58.620]  bright part is he now trying to call for your website to be banned Alex it's not
[03:23:58.620 --> 03:24:02.180]  good enough to just ban you from Twitter he wants to pull you off the
[03:24:02.180 --> 03:24:06.860]  internet all together and it what's crazy is this is literally one of the
[03:24:06.860 --> 03:24:13.540]  directives that these leftist troll bot farms had this week so what's going on
[03:24:13.540 --> 03:24:17.300]  why is Oliver Darcy following directives that this leftist troll bot farm is
[03:24:17.300 --> 03:24:22.260]  giving out it just shows that the whole point here is to create division amongst
[03:24:22.260 --> 03:24:27.740]  the left and the right and a lot of them right now on social media is completely
[03:24:27.740 --> 03:24:31.340]  contrived and there are little literal psyops going on right now on the
[03:24:31.340 --> 03:24:36.140]  American public wow because I remember reading even on front line a
[03:24:36.140 --> 03:24:39.900]  documentary like 13 years ago or so where they admitted they had these whole
[03:24:39.900 --> 03:24:43.380]  buildings full of troll bots they claim I'm like the homeland carriage when we
[03:24:43.380 --> 03:24:46.820]  have that we we have two people that do social media and I just post our links
[03:24:46.820 --> 03:24:51.340]  and articles we don't post fights and fake stuff but but that the left was
[03:24:51.340 --> 03:24:56.060]  doing that too they go create fake controversy and a fake right wing even
[03:24:56.060 --> 03:24:59.580]  Netflix last year but they were doing this to attack their report so the left
[03:24:59.580 --> 03:25:03.380]  to go oh look the right wing doesn't like us so the left will go watch the movie
[03:25:03.380 --> 03:25:09.300]  so there's so many levels to this where we've caught the same IP address from
[03:25:09.300 --> 03:25:14.180]  corporations literally spewing racism from all angles to create a fight
[03:25:14.180 --> 03:25:19.140]  exactly and I'm looking at one of the directives right now for March 10th and
[03:25:19.140 --> 03:25:22.740]  I mean some of the things that are telling people to do these these bots it
[03:25:22.740 --> 03:25:27.820]  says push Andrew Yang condemn Trump as anti-Semitic and create opposition to
[03:25:27.820 --> 03:25:30.740]  Trump they're trying to create a lot of division amongst Trump's base right now
[03:25:30.740 --> 03:25:38.100]  by saying that Trump is an Israel Jewish shill and anyone who's pro-Trump still
[03:25:38.100 --> 03:25:42.560]  they're gonna try to oh my god you got these internal documents I gotta hold
[03:25:42.560 --> 03:25:48.020]  you over Nick Beckins will understand it's like this Israel thing Israel
[03:25:48.020 --> 03:25:51.940]  doesn't run anything Israel is is our ally in the Middle East but it doesn't
[03:25:51.940 --> 03:25:56.740]  even matter the forget Israel that the thing is the left is what all YouTube
[03:25:56.740 --> 03:26:00.920]  and Facebook always allow you're a Jewish shill they don't allow you to say
[03:26:00.920 --> 03:26:04.380]  America's great George Washington's wonderful capitalism's good let's come
[03:26:04.380 --> 03:26:10.060]  together and not be racist that has been but if you're Jew Jew Jew Jew magic Jews
[03:26:10.060 --> 03:26:13.980]  run everything get tracks back to Democrats and you've got insiders with
[03:26:13.980 --> 03:26:17.780]  the documents you're gonna release showing where they said called Trump a
[03:26:17.780 --> 03:26:21.680]  Jewish shill cuz I don't know how many times you're working with Trump that
[03:26:21.680 --> 03:26:27.220]  Jewish shill oh yeah we we literally have the documents it's insane and I just
[03:26:27.220 --> 03:26:31.940]  recently was one of the things we did was we had this person who infiltrated
[03:26:31.940 --> 03:26:36.340]  post my latest video here right criticize Andrew Yang and once it got
[03:26:36.340 --> 03:26:41.180]  posted in the message board of the troll farm all the sudden my video began to be
[03:26:41.180 --> 03:26:45.340]  trolled by all these bots and just hundreds and hundreds of comments saying
[03:26:45.340 --> 03:26:49.860]  claiming that I was a Jewish shill explain you've got an insider watching in
[03:26:49.860 --> 03:26:55.900]  a lifetime them troll you yes yes exactly and one of the interesting things
[03:26:55.900 --> 03:27:01.420]  also is that they were pushing and saying to attack Ilhan Omar and and
[03:27:01.420 --> 03:27:04.980]  claim she's anti-Semitic and that she you know say she's not white and and
[03:27:04.980 --> 03:27:09.220]  basically criticize and attack her to make it look like Trump supporters are
[03:27:09.220 --> 03:27:14.580]  attacking her for being Muslim to sell more full spectrum dominance this is so
[03:27:14.580 --> 03:27:18.180]  bombshell yeah when Millie you've done so many big investigative reports I know

[03:32:22.260 --> 03:32:27.620]  are the power structure we are the inventors we are the trailblazers and

[03:33:28.820 --> 03:33:33.340]  shooting and the global scythe eyes of March and to get into milleyweaver and
[03:33:33.340 --> 03:33:37.060]  the infiltration into a leptis trolling farm but it's in the wiki leaks they
[03:33:37.060 --> 03:33:40.420]  try to create racial division it's all going into overdrive I want to play a
[03:33:40.420 --> 03:33:47.100]  clip of Andrew Yang first white people want to put Asians in concentration
[03:33:47.100 --> 03:33:53.300]  camps so here he is and who is going to be the boogie man of the next 10 to 20
[03:33:53.300 --> 03:33:56.980]  years who's going to be the great rival to the United States in the eyes of
[03:33:56.980 --> 03:34:03.860]  American society China that's right and so what do you think the attitude is
[03:34:03.860 --> 03:34:08.300]  going to be over time for the shrinking insecure white majority that's losing
[03:34:08.300 --> 03:34:14.940]  their jobs for let's say Chinese Americans or Asian Americans I don't
[03:34:14.940 --> 03:34:19.700]  I'm like I personally I said to a group at Harvard I think we're one generation
[03:34:19.700 --> 03:34:23.380]  away from falling into the same camps as the Jews who were attacked in the
[03:34:23.380 --> 03:34:26.500]  synagogue in Pittsburgh like just a couple months ago it's like we're
[03:34:26.500 --> 03:34:30.300]  probably one generation away from Americans shooting up a bunch of Asians
[03:34:30.300 --> 03:34:34.340]  saying like you know damn the Chinese because there's a giant cold war or
[03:34:34.340 --> 03:34:41.700]  even more okay so that's a giant over simplification China sells its
[03:34:41.700 --> 03:34:46.340]  political distance organs and makes billions of dollars a year China has two
[03:34:46.340 --> 03:34:51.460]  million people in concentration camps just in Mongolia that's admitted they
[03:34:51.460 --> 03:34:56.500]  don't deny that China has killed more of its own citizens times five that
[03:34:56.500 --> 03:35:01.580]  Hitler did and Hitler was really bad
[03:35:02.220 --> 03:35:08.980]  towards sorrow so tell you different so he sits up there as a chai-kong agent of
[03:35:08.980 --> 03:35:13.180]  the evil political party of the Chinese communists who are doing human
[03:35:13.180 --> 03:35:18.180]  cloning everything it's just unlimited and then he says the shrinking white
[03:35:18.180 --> 03:35:21.500]  majority is making it racial oh you minorities you don't get part of the
[03:35:21.500 --> 03:35:25.460]  American birthright you're the majority now no no no you get after white people
[03:35:25.460 --> 03:35:29.540]  and don't criticize China because China represents all Asians which this is
[03:35:29.540 --> 03:35:35.380]  government propaganda of China the whole Middle Kingdom now all of Asia is under
[03:35:35.380 --> 03:35:39.900]  them actually they're at war with Japan they're at war with South Korea they're
[03:35:39.900 --> 03:35:44.060]  at war with Vietnam I mean these countries hate China has been trying to
[03:35:44.060 --> 03:35:49.900]  dominate them for a thousand years but oh you see if you don't know the
[03:35:49.900 --> 03:35:54.620]  anthropology the sociology the history you're just thinking oh my god yeah the
[03:35:54.620 --> 03:35:59.140]  Asians they're all just perfect little cupcakes and he's telling us that if we
[03:35:59.140 --> 03:36:02.740]  don't accept China stealing all our intellectual property and having you
[03:36:02.740 --> 03:36:06.700]  know $900 billion trade deficits and infiltrating us while we're racist
[03:36:06.700 --> 03:36:10.300]  Millie Weaver I'm gonna turn this over to Nick Beggars but closing comments on
[03:36:10.300 --> 03:36:14.620]  that tomorrow night we'll do a couple hours you'll pop in with your video
[03:36:14.620 --> 03:36:19.460]  your developments seven o'clock central tomorrow night we're doing a special
[03:36:19.460 --> 03:36:22.620]  report on all that's happening but Millie I mean just your take on that
[03:36:22.620 --> 03:36:26.420]  talk about the troll farm and the directive is you know make it all about
[03:36:26.420 --> 03:36:30.580]  Andrew Yang I mean this is incredible he's like the Chinese government spokes
[03:36:30.580 --> 03:36:34.520]  person he doesn't talk about China and organs being sold or Falun Gong or
[03:36:34.520 --> 03:36:38.660]  abusing Chinese people or you know David not adopting a Chinese daughter and
[03:36:38.660 --> 03:36:42.220]  saving her starving in an orphanage or my parents adopting a South Korean
[03:36:42.220 --> 03:36:45.500]  starving in her orphanage or any of that it's all how white people are
[03:36:45.500 --> 03:36:50.300]  inherently evil what a race-based bag of crap that the chai comms are funding
[03:36:50.300 --> 03:36:54.020]  in Hollywood for a race war they don't allow that in China but here they
[03:36:54.020 --> 03:36:58.820]  promote it they piss on our rug I mean isn't it interesting that the same
[03:36:58.820 --> 03:37:03.780]  talking points Andrew Yang is using there saying the fearful shrinking white
[03:37:03.780 --> 03:37:08.340]  people are what people on the left should be worried about meanwhile the
[03:37:08.340 --> 03:37:17.260]  entire manifesto here Hitler level race crap and it's a Chinese government this
[03:37:17.260 --> 03:37:21.460]  literal Chinese government agent is running for president pissing on our
[03:37:21.460 --> 03:37:26.820]  face exactly and it's important to distinguish though that Andrew Yang's
[03:37:26.820 --> 03:37:32.060]  parents are Taiwanese immigrants but that doesn't mean he isn't working for
[03:37:32.060 --> 03:37:41.260]  China oh exactly his campaign slogan is humanity first whereas Trump's is
[03:37:41.260 --> 03:37:45.780]  America first and that really speaks volumes about what who his interests are
[03:37:45.780 --> 03:37:49.260]  for you know he's looking at a global perspective and that's the same thing
[03:37:49.260 --> 03:37:53.260]  that the Chinese way the Japanese had invaded I'm not bashing Japanese they
[03:37:53.260 --> 03:37:56.500]  were under imperial control manipulated into it they're good people the Japanese
[03:37:56.500 --> 03:38:00.940]  had invaded China they killed over two million people they invaded Korea they
[03:38:00.940 --> 03:38:07.140]  attacked our military bases in the Pacific at Hawaii and Honolulu and we
[03:38:07.140 --> 03:38:11.900]  saved the Chinese assets so his and I might even we went too far putting
[03:38:11.900 --> 03:38:15.980]  fifth-generation Japanese in camps in a war but we didn't kill them in the camps
[03:38:15.980 --> 03:38:19.380]  and their sons could sign up for the military and go fight I still think it
[03:38:19.380 --> 03:38:24.380]  was wrong it was too big of a response but the idea that we're effing Chinese
[03:38:24.380 --> 03:38:29.820]  over when our government save their our people save their butt pisses me off
[03:38:29.820 --> 03:38:36.460]  Milly I know it's it's very upsetting and it's upsetting how people are even
[03:38:36.460 --> 03:38:42.300]  falling into this Andrew Yang trap that's being pushed and propagated by these
[03:38:42.300 --> 03:38:46.620]  leftist troll farms it literally says on here you know repair Andrew Yang's
[03:38:46.620 --> 03:38:50.420]  reputation condemn Trump is a Jewish shill I mean and these are all things
[03:38:50.420 --> 03:38:54.140]  we're seeing all this discontent sowed amongst the MAGA movement for Trump right
[03:38:54.140 --> 03:38:58.900]  now whether that troll farms trolling us or whatever this is what they spew
[03:38:58.900 --> 03:39:04.260]  Milly we'll talk to you again tomorrow 7 o'clock central great job thanks Alex
[03:39:04.260 --> 03:39:08.140]  thank you Milly okay I'm gonna hand the baton now for the rest of the segment
[03:39:08.140 --> 03:39:11.660]  and I he signed on for it and I loved our Nick baggage when invited on my show
[03:39:11.660 --> 03:39:14.700]  all the shows we want him to host his own show soon we're trying to get the
[03:39:14.700 --> 03:39:18.580]  board ops higher we're about a year behind but we love him we so wonderful
[03:39:18.580 --> 03:39:22.980]  let's go to dr. Nick beggars give his take on the situation doctor hey thanks
[03:39:22.980 --> 03:39:27.220]  Alex you know I was thinking about this a couple of points that were made earlier
[03:39:27.220 --> 03:39:32.220]  but let's just to talk about the Chinese just for a second you know in terms of
[03:39:32.220 --> 03:39:38.980]  long-term strategies this is really the game you know and people confuse
[03:39:38.980 --> 03:39:44.200]  economics systems with political systems and there you know I mean the
[03:39:44.200 --> 03:39:47.860]  economic system they're running on is clearly capitalism with political
[03:39:47.860 --> 03:39:53.060]  system they're running on as communism and nothing's changed but when you think
[03:39:53.060 --> 03:39:56.740]  about positioning in the world and that's a lot of what I wanted to cover a
[03:39:56.740 --> 03:40:01.580]  little bit today but the other issue that came up that's really bothering me
[03:40:01.580 --> 03:40:06.820]  is this idea of cutting off immediate streaming and I realized this disaster in
[03:40:06.820 --> 03:40:11.580]  New Zealand but no I agree they're trying to end the average person being able to
[03:40:11.580 --> 03:40:16.540]  live stream that's the main mission here right and it's really to again
[03:40:16.540 --> 03:40:23.220]  throttle free speech throttle the town square of the 21st century and these
[03:40:23.220 --> 03:40:27.740]  are utilities now they're a little bit too big maybe breaking up utilities is a
[03:40:27.740 --> 03:40:33.340]  good idea in this case and also making sure that everyone has access including
[03:40:33.340 --> 03:40:38.860]  info wars and even that kind of thing that we find repugnant like what this
[03:40:38.860 --> 03:40:42.540]  guy did streaming on Facebook no you just said it when you only have a
[03:40:42.540 --> 03:40:46.660]  monopoly like Facebook it makes the anomalies more powerful there was 50 of
[03:40:46.660 --> 03:40:50.180]  these you know that will get on occasionally but it's not amplified by
[03:40:50.180 --> 03:40:54.820]  the monopoly right exactly and then you and then the mainstream media has a
[03:40:54.820 --> 03:40:58.820]  chance to sort of weed it out and all the alternative media is a chance to
[03:40:58.820 --> 03:41:06.060]  assess situation you know and airing that is not useful I think I think it's
[03:41:06.060 --> 03:41:11.700]  inflamed it's inflaming for sure it certainly polarizes people even more
[03:41:11.700 --> 03:41:16.420]  extremely than we already are and I think that's really what the globalists
[03:41:16.420 --> 03:41:22.260]  are about it's dividing east and west more pragmatically because it's in the
[03:41:22.260 --> 03:41:26.260]  east that for and I agree and I want to invite you back to my class I want to
[03:41:26.260 --> 03:41:28.580]  invite you back on my Sunday show if you'll do an hour with us and next
[03:41:28.580 --> 03:41:32.620]  week on my show but just doesn't this smell synthetic I'm not even saying
[03:41:32.620 --> 03:41:36.060]  it's fake like he's a product of the programming but this whole thing looks
[03:41:36.060 --> 03:41:41.460]  like PNAC new American century class of civilizations it's just written doesn't
[03:41:41.460 --> 03:41:46.140]  this is very smartly written right right and you know you think about what
[03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:51.060]  happened with Japanese internment World War two I would like to think that we've
[03:41:51.060 --> 03:41:57.700]  evolved from where we were then as a people as a Democratic Republic just in
[03:41:57.700 --> 03:42:02.260]  the same way that we went from a point in time when we had slavery in the US and
[03:42:02.260 --> 03:42:06.900]  that we didn't we had women's suffrage and the women's right to vote and I mean
[03:42:06.900 --> 03:42:11.580]  we had changes in how our country shaped itself and to think we're going
[03:42:11.580 --> 03:42:16.100]  backwards to that that's like again inflammatory speech that's wrong headed
[03:42:16.100 --> 03:42:24.380]  the issue of being against a country is really more about being against not the
[03:42:24.380 --> 03:42:28.700]  people that live there but the philosophy that's being really fostered on the
[03:42:28.700 --> 03:42:33.300]  world and got the leadership of the chai comms is the problem right right and
[03:42:33.300 --> 03:42:41.060]  this is this is all a globalist industrial hijacking is what's going on
[03:42:41.060 --> 03:42:44.340]  and and there's a lot more to be said about that and and you're right that's
[03:42:44.340 --> 03:42:49.060]  where we're at in this century all right not a big baggage straight ahead stay
[03:42:49.060 --> 03:42:54.260]  with us in the war room is only 15 minutes away stay with us the globalist
[03:42:54.260 --> 03:42:59.500]  the eugenicists are always talking down to us they're always trying to make us
[03:42:59.500 --> 03:43:05.060]  feel small to feel insignificant they try to censor because they fear you and
[03:43:05.060 --> 03:43:08.900]  don't want you to have the right to access information so you can make your
[03:43:08.900 --> 03:43:14.540]  own decisions they want you to believe you're powerless but the truth is it is
[03:43:14.540 --> 03:43:19.420]  we the people and our ideas and our actions and and what we say and what we
[03:43:19.420 --> 03:43:24.580]  do that changes the world we are the power structure we are the inventors
[03:43:24.580 --> 03:43:30.580]  we are the trailblazers and the globalists understand that and they
[03:43:30.580 --> 03:43:35.340]  understand that they are basically trying to control and steal the future
[03:43:35.340 --> 03:43:40.060]  from we the people now to help fund our operation is undoubtedly the very tip
[03:43:40.060 --> 03:43:43.740]  of the spear against these globalist I want to encourage listeners and viewers
[03:43:43.740 --> 03:43:47.820]  understand that throughout the second half of the month of March we're going

[03:47:28.580 --> 03:47:34.140]  March 15th 2019 in the stock your Nick Begich and you know I want to pick it up
[03:47:34.140 --> 03:47:38.140]  where we left off you know lots going on today but I want to talk about the
[03:47:38.140 --> 03:47:43.260]  sensors all right because there's all kinds of ways to sensor populations and
[03:47:43.260 --> 03:47:46.900]  the Facebook shut down the streaming you know everybody's in their panic party
[03:47:46.900 --> 03:47:55.140]  today and and really it breaks my heart to see what we're you know what we're
[03:47:55.140 --> 03:48:00.420]  reading about and seeing but at the same time you know as repugnant as what
[03:48:00.420 --> 03:48:08.260]  happened in New Zealand is we cannot allow the shutdown of free and equal
[03:48:08.260 --> 03:48:14.100]  access to speech because who becomes then the gatekeeper you know do we shut
[03:48:14.100 --> 03:48:22.140]  down visual images of war that are shot by mainstream media do we shut down
[03:48:22.140 --> 03:48:27.540]  atrocities you know such as what we saw in some of the film footage after World
[03:48:27.540 --> 03:48:32.620]  War two you know what point do we decide what is acceptable and not
[03:48:32.620 --> 03:48:38.940]  acceptable and this is kind of censoring but using the most extreme events to
[03:48:38.940 --> 03:48:43.260]  create the excuse for censoring and that's what I think we're all seeing and
[03:48:43.260 --> 03:48:47.580]  so there's social sensors you know kind of what is socially acceptable within
[03:48:47.580 --> 03:48:52.580]  the compliance of your culture like in France women can walk down the beach
[03:48:52.580 --> 03:48:57.820]  with no top on no one says he think in Saudi Arabia you try that and you're
[03:48:57.820 --> 03:49:04.100]  going to get beaten with a rod or worse but social sensors which are cultural
[03:49:04.100 --> 03:49:09.220]  they happen all the time how we guard our speech around that religious sensors
[03:49:09.220 --> 03:49:13.700]  you know about religious ideologies within the cultural context that we live
[03:49:13.700 --> 03:49:17.580]  in or where we're situated at any given time you might not want to say certain
[03:49:17.580 --> 03:49:23.180]  things so there's censoring ideological censoring ideas and China you don't want
[03:49:23.180 --> 03:49:27.220]  to be talking about democracy too loudly you might get in deep trouble there
[03:49:27.220 --> 03:49:31.780]  and escorted out of the country might not talk about religion in China either
[03:49:31.780 --> 03:49:36.740]  unless it's all guarded by the state you know and politically and correct so
[03:49:36.740 --> 03:49:41.260]  ideological politically correct censoring which we see in the modern
[03:49:41.260 --> 03:49:48.100]  world now is offensive language which is again another form of censoring speech
[03:49:48.100 --> 03:49:52.620]  generally and access to the town square and that's what we were we left off with
[03:49:52.620 --> 03:49:58.780]  with Alex in the last segment you know that's really the globalist grab you
[03:49:58.780 --> 03:50:05.980]  know back 41 years ago when I was in my late teens I had this idea that the
[03:50:05.980 --> 03:50:12.940]  world was advancing based on information systems communication systems and
[03:50:12.940 --> 03:50:19.100]  transportation systems now look back and the information systems in 41 years you
[03:50:19.100 --> 03:50:22.660]  can see what's happened there and it's continuing communications is
[03:50:22.660 --> 03:50:27.260]  revolutionary you know it used to cost a few dollars a minute to call out of
[03:50:27.260 --> 03:50:32.580]  Alaska now it's free basically on cell phones you know international calls are
[03:50:32.580 --> 03:50:36.860]  free on sky for other medium you know there's I mean it's all changed you know
[03:50:36.860 --> 03:50:42.420]  but communications transportation is being revolutionized we haven't seen all
[03:50:42.420 --> 03:50:45.740]  of that yet there's more to come and that's gonna have to do with alternative
[03:50:45.740 --> 03:50:51.780]  fuels maybe some exotic crazy stuff like anti-gravity based on super
[03:50:51.780 --> 03:50:57.340]  conductivity and other technologies are being advanced in this century so a lot
[03:50:57.340 --> 03:51:04.420]  is is is coming and 25 years ago I predicted the technocracy the rise of
[03:51:04.420 --> 03:51:08.980]  governments based on their command and control of technology and this is what
[03:51:08.980 --> 03:51:15.540]  Eisenhower talked about industrial military complex and truly industrial
[03:51:15.540 --> 03:51:24.060]  military academic complex and this is about moving an agenda forward as the
[03:51:24.060 --> 03:51:28.420]  West is debased you know you look at the entire Western population of about a
[03:51:28.420 --> 03:51:34.300]  billion to that's Europe in the Americas and then you look east and you're
[03:51:34.300 --> 03:51:39.300]  talking four billion you know between Asia China Russia and then you look at
[03:51:39.300 --> 03:51:43.500]  the demographics of this were populations in these reasons are actually
[03:51:43.500 --> 03:51:48.300]  shrinking in Russia and China because of the various policies and that is
[03:51:48.300 --> 03:51:51.580]  continuing and they say oh no panic party because what are you gonna do with the
[03:51:51.580 --> 03:51:58.300]  older generation member just because their population shrinking doesn't mean
[03:51:58.300 --> 03:52:02.500]  what they do is you know requiring more labor it's not it's requiring less
[03:52:02.500 --> 03:52:07.220]  labor because of AI and robotics and that's the real miss and there's four
[03:52:07.220 --> 03:52:12.180]  billion people expected to move into the middle class from the third world in
[03:52:12.180 --> 03:52:18.460]  China and Russia another place to India over the next couple of decades or the
[03:52:18.460 --> 03:52:22.900]  next really three or four decades so the the money the industrialists the
[03:52:22.900 --> 03:52:27.260]  globalists are moving there because they've already gutted this economy look
[03:52:27.260 --> 03:52:29.460]  at the P&L statement I'll give you the numbers
[03:52:29.460 --> 03:52:37.380]  18.6 trillion dollars in gross domestic product last year and a 4.2 trillion
[03:52:37.380 --> 03:52:43.420]  dollar federal budget and that doesn't include state or local spending as a
[03:52:43.420 --> 03:52:51.580]  percentage of our economy that is really huge and then when you factor in you
[03:52:51.580 --> 03:52:57.100]  know that's like 20% of the economy it's almost as much as medical grabbing of
[03:52:57.100 --> 03:53:01.260]  the economy but that's just a federal government and there's no way to really
[03:53:01.260 --> 03:53:06.140]  pay that out of P&L out of the tax receipts it'll be crazy amount of tax
[03:53:06.140 --> 03:53:12.500]  as you'd have to impose on everyone but we also get import taxes you know this
[03:53:12.500 --> 03:53:19.700]  fight with China actually we're generating 10 to 25% I think 10% import
[03:53:19.700 --> 03:53:23.180]  tariffs on a lot of that that's filling the treasury the other thing that
[03:53:23.180 --> 03:53:28.220]  happened is we reached we reached out and grabbed the foreign income of our US
[03:53:28.220 --> 03:53:34.220]  corporations are now taxing on the 15% you know we should restrict their exit
[03:53:34.220 --> 03:53:38.380]  to you know because they can exit freely leave the US and domicile elsewhere
[03:53:38.380 --> 03:53:42.500]  US citizens can't and if we're going to treat corporations like citizens we
[03:53:42.500 --> 03:53:46.180]  should treat them the same way and one is we should tax their worldwide income on
[03:53:46.180 --> 03:53:51.020]  the same base tax at home number one number two they can't leave if you leave
[03:53:51.020 --> 03:53:55.780]  as a citizen you quit your citizenship as individual you give up 20% of your
[03:53:55.780 --> 03:54:00.420]  assets as a parting tax look it up in the IRS code corporations don't they take
[03:54:00.420 --> 03:54:05.780]  their money and run if they had to give up 20% if they exited the US of their
[03:54:05.780 --> 03:54:10.580]  capital base or money their full valuation that would be interesting
[03:54:10.580 --> 03:54:16.220]  valued by the IRS and then if they had to they might I would say if they're
[03:54:16.220 --> 03:54:20.300]  going to leave we should reach back save at a free ride for decades reach back
[03:54:20.300 --> 03:54:26.260]  and get their foreign revenue streams tax appropriately before they leave so
[03:54:26.260 --> 03:54:31.340]  their taxes are current same deal with US citizens by the way but you know when
[03:54:31.340 --> 03:54:35.060]  you look at tax revenues we've got the and I'd really like to see the numbers
[03:54:35.060 --> 03:54:40.340]  how much did this 15% tax on these foreign assets of these corporations
[03:54:40.340 --> 03:54:46.020]  these globalists bring in and how much of it was in the Facebook Twitter Amazon
[03:54:46.020 --> 03:54:50.900]  lefty space because most of it was that's why they're so angry and
[03:54:50.900 --> 03:54:55.380]  controlling speech think about this I want to remind listeners in this last
[03:54:55.380 --> 03:54:59.900]  bit that I have of something that happened in 1992 it's a long time ago a
[03:54:59.900 --> 03:55:03.140]  lot of people weren't even alive that listen to this broadcast that or were
[03:55:03.140 --> 03:55:06.260]  little kids you know because you'd be in your 30s you would have still been a
[03:55:06.260 --> 03:55:11.180]  little kid but Ross Perot was running and a guy named Chuck Carter was a radio
[03:55:11.180 --> 03:55:16.420]  host of the day had you know just all over syndicated in daytime in rush
[03:55:16.420 --> 03:55:21.660]  Limbaugh slot all over the place he had a huge impact on Ross Perot's movement
[03:55:21.660 --> 03:55:25.980]  and the polls and ability to rise up and then they screwed them both over I mean
[03:55:25.980 --> 03:55:31.740]  what happened to Chuck Carter as a case study and how people come into your
[03:55:31.740 --> 03:55:37.500]  organization take control in an indirect kind of way and then destroy it and they
[03:55:37.500 --> 03:55:42.540]  destroyed Chuck Carter in the network he had which was influencing too much of
[03:55:42.540 --> 03:55:49.020]  the alternative I think and the thinking population so they brought in
[03:55:49.020 --> 03:55:53.700]  someone to finance their growth and they grew and then when they hit a point
[03:55:53.700 --> 03:55:56.820]  where their cash flows weren't there they little claws in the contract let
[03:55:56.820 --> 03:56:00.660]  these guys take over then they had editorial control then the whole thing
[03:56:00.660 --> 03:56:04.700]  unravel which was a real goal they didn't care about a few million bucks they're
[03:56:04.700 --> 03:56:10.020]  willing to lose that what they want to do is quiet the voice of opposition and
[03:56:10.020 --> 03:56:13.780]  that's what's happening to info wars right now a lot of other people that's
[03:56:13.780 --> 03:56:18.380]  why we have to think about this way differently we cannot restrict speech
[03:56:18.380 --> 03:56:23.580]  no matter no matter how repugnant we cannot react violently in kind of
[03:56:23.580 --> 03:56:28.180]  violent actions like this but we have to think about what we're doing and make
[03:56:28.180 --> 03:56:35.540]  sure we preserve the fundamentals of a free and debate and discussion you know
[03:56:35.540 --> 03:56:41.220]  China does this restriction nonsense and gives people social scores in the West
[03:56:41.220 --> 03:56:44.740]  what we do is the same kind of thing but it's controlled by corporations
[03:56:44.740 --> 03:56:50.500]  globalists who have set about to manipulate the flow of data and
[03:56:50.500 --> 03:56:56.580]  information in a technocracy that supports them this is the bad marriage
[03:56:56.580 --> 03:57:02.140]  between globalists and governments this is where economic systems override
[03:57:02.140 --> 03:57:06.820]  political systems and you get some real damage political systems you can rebel
[03:57:06.820 --> 03:57:11.620]  you can change you can alter even in the worst of governments but what we're
[03:57:11.620 --> 03:57:17.420]  seeing now in China is a wholesale invasion of privacy and also happening
[03:57:17.420 --> 03:57:21.820]  throughout the West this is dr. Nick baggage and next time I'm on we're gonna
[03:57:21.820 --> 03:57:26.820]  talk more in depth on this I'm gonna try and be in Austin in April and hopefully
[03:57:26.820 --> 03:57:32.340]  do some more in-depth recording but info wars support info wars right now look
[03:57:32.340 --> 03:57:37.540]  at the info wars store and look at our books our videos they're all there and

[03:57:42.540 --> 03:57:47.700]  you know the worst part about getting old I'm still strong 45 is that I won't
[03:57:47.700 --> 03:57:50.860]  be there for my children someday that's why I need to make them strong now now
[03:57:50.860 --> 03:57:55.460]  I can be there for my children now I can make them strong now I can instruct
[03:57:55.460 --> 03:57:59.020]  them now I can teach them what I've learned but not once I'm gone you think
[03:57:59.020 --> 03:58:01.620]  of this digital age your words going forever but now there isn't better
[03:58:01.620 --> 03:58:05.220]  getting rid of what you said they were before it's so much easier to burn
[03:58:05.220 --> 03:58:09.660]  video or text or languages now that we have high tech book burning isn't it but
[03:58:09.660 --> 03:58:14.820]  I have joined my will to the resistance I can't be destroyed now as long as I
[03:58:14.820 --> 03:58:18.660]  realize I've done right and the longer the people know the truth and you can't
[03:58:18.660 --> 03:58:23.380]  be destroyed either as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it
[03:58:23.380 --> 03:58:27.900]  and go through the fire for there is a magic that then takes place the transcend
[03:58:27.900 --> 03:58:32.180]  space and time when you commit be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread
