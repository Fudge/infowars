[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:40.380]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.380 --> 00:50.300]  oh man I've been sitting here ready to go live but as we were going live I was
[00:50.300 --> 00:54.420]  just fumbling through all these stacks of incredible news just trying to think
[00:54.420 --> 01:00.780]  what is the top story what what is most important and I really come to the same
[01:00.780 --> 01:04.620]  conclusion every time I have that thought it's the entire mass of news
[01:04.620 --> 01:15.300]  together that really shows us how truly insane society and civilization is
[01:15.300 --> 01:22.020]  going here's one thing I thought it was pretty incredible yesterday when we
[01:22.020 --> 01:26.500]  broke the story with the video from McCallan Texas on the Mexican border
[01:26.500 --> 01:30.180]  but the head of emergency management said that over 90% of the illegals that
[01:30.180 --> 01:36.740]  show up bust in by the Border Patrol to McCallan to be staged at churches
[01:36.740 --> 01:41.380]  already have tickets provided to them to go wherever they want in the United
[01:41.380 --> 01:46.300]  States quote in the interior and that nothing is being done they're just
[01:46.300 --> 01:52.780]  being paid to get into the US but they could take them in a bus and drive them
[01:52.780 --> 01:56.260]  back over and throw them back into Mexico they don't even do that they
[01:56.260 --> 02:02.180]  drive them into the US and that video is up on info wars dot com no one picked it
[02:02.180 --> 02:08.060]  up no one covered it as of my search about an hour before broadcast time
[02:08.060 --> 02:14.100]  today and then I had missed it in the stack as I was going through it caught
[02:14.100 --> 02:19.340]  red-handed Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deeper into the US the daily
[02:19.340 --> 02:23.300]  mail that I know follows info wars dot com closely and they actually give us
[02:23.300 --> 02:27.020]  credit a lot of times I got to give them credit they every week or so they
[02:27.020 --> 02:30.220]  give us credit for stories we've broken I was reading through this one and
[02:30.220 --> 02:35.940]  didn't see us credited but they broke this yesterday evening we broke this
[02:35.940 --> 02:40.100]  really in the evening before yesterday but I broke it big time here on the
[02:40.100 --> 02:43.620]  air and I'm not into breaks things first it's just I'm trying to get this
[02:43.620 --> 02:47.700]  story out so it's interesting to track it learn how the media works hundreds of
[02:47.700 --> 02:53.140]  illegal immigrant children are being handed to relatives who are in the
[02:53.140 --> 02:59.780]  US illegally too well yeah that's what the Dream Act does as HHS admits it
[02:59.780 --> 03:05.060]  makes no effort to find out their immigration status now when they say
[03:05.060 --> 03:09.700]  handed to you mean paid to get to whether it's Chicago Illinois or Austin
[03:09.700 --> 03:19.460]  Texas whether it's Seattle Washington or Minneapolis St. Paul Minnesota so at
[03:19.460 --> 03:25.060]  least the Daily Mail covered it and they made some phone calls and talked to
[03:25.060 --> 03:30.180]  health and human services people who admitted that's going on they don't
[03:30.180 --> 03:34.220]  even try to check that they have quote verified sponsors it's just you get
[03:34.220 --> 03:36.980]  here you're legal the government's going to pay for it and then you're going to
[03:36.980 --> 03:39.900]  get put on welfare as soon as you get to the quote immigrant illegal immigrant
[03:39.900 --> 03:46.420]  family who and then they bring in the next wave I mean this is this is mind
[03:46.420 --> 03:50.860]  boggling and and folks when you look at who's coming here it is the poorest of
[03:50.860 --> 04:02.620]  the slums of Mexico of Guatemala of Nicaragua El Salvador Paraguay Uruguay
[04:02.620 --> 04:10.780]  Honduras Valice the Caribbean nations that by the way the Caribbean you can
[04:10.780 --> 04:14.060]  look this up is descended in a total bedlam the last few years most areas
[04:14.060 --> 04:17.820]  are just war zones now the Bahamas is the most dangerous place other than
[04:17.820 --> 04:27.900]  Mexico people still go there constantly but the issue here is that the United
[04:27.900 --> 04:32.140]  States in these pockets areas of Arizona you name it are becoming
[04:32.140 --> 04:37.820]  Wallace as well and you look at the truly poor destitute people with no
[04:37.820 --> 04:42.420]  education I mean they're going to be wards the state for generations now you
[04:42.420 --> 04:45.660]  think government's taking the black community and wrecked people my god
[04:45.660 --> 04:48.900]  they're going to have a heyday with the poorest people of Latin America who
[04:48.900 --> 04:52.140]  will never work another day on their lives now they're going directly on the
[04:52.140 --> 04:57.220]  Democratic Party's mammary gland which is your money to the back
[04:58.220 --> 05:02.900]  a chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties
[05:02.900 --> 05:06.420]  this year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water
[05:06.420 --> 05:10.340]  contaminate what are the health effects of having these drugs and our drinking
[05:10.340 --> 05:14.100]  water it's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents my

[06:28.900 --> 06:32.580]  with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics
[06:32.580 --> 06:37.140]  it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat
[06:37.140 --> 06:41.140]  the toxic environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back against made

[08:37.660 --> 08:42.660]  does that make me crazy
[08:42.660 --> 08:46.660]  does that make me crazy
[08:46.660 --> 08:53.660]  does that make me crazy
[08:53.660 --> 09:00.660]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[09:00.660 --> 09:18.660]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this worldwide transmission Thursday the 19th day already
[09:18.660 --> 09:25.660]  of June 2014 I am your host Alex Jones the news websites are
[09:25.660 --> 09:34.660]  prisonplanet.com and of course info wars.com the US military officially
[09:34.660 --> 09:39.660]  throughout the Pentagon the letters are flooding us by the hundreds with photo
[09:39.660 --> 09:43.660]  copies and digital photos that the military personnel are taking for us
[09:43.660 --> 09:49.660]  are snapping for us we've been hit by a tsunami of documentation that at military
[09:49.660 --> 09:56.660]  terminals and computers across the world info wars.com and prisonplanet.com are
[09:56.660 --> 10:02.660]  being blocked that's why we have Facebook that's why we have Twitter it's why we
[10:02.660 --> 10:06.660]  have YouTube and a bunch of other platforms because it's a whack-a-mole
[10:06.660 --> 10:12.660]  type situation for years where we get censored at libraries at colleges you
[10:12.660 --> 10:22.660]  name it we are listed as hate and violence as well as racism and we're
[10:22.660 --> 10:27.660]  seeing censorship happen to info wars not just on the internet but concerted
[10:27.660 --> 10:33.660]  efforts that do absolutely nothing by the way of calling up our AM and FM affiliates
[10:33.660 --> 10:40.660]  with Democratic Party seminar callers they're trained in seminars to call up
[10:40.660 --> 10:46.660]  and threaten them that they better take my show off the air and several affiliates
[10:46.660 --> 10:50.660]  I'm gonna get some honest guests to talk about it I have just said you know what we
[10:50.660 --> 10:53.660]  have him on at night rebroadcast we're just gonna go ahead and put him on live
[10:53.660 --> 10:58.660]  how's that sound because we listen to Alex and we know he's not preaching hate
[10:58.660 --> 11:03.660]  or racism or violence but the opposite it's you people trying to destroy free
[11:03.660 --> 11:08.660]  speech in this country and if you can shut Alex Jones off the air you can shut
[11:08.660 --> 11:12.660]  everybody off the air so that we're getting a lot of new affiliates all
[11:12.660 --> 11:16.660]  over the United States right now the system is upset by that and they don't
[11:16.660 --> 11:26.660]  like it and by the way the biggest boost we ever got on the roadmap to info
[11:26.660 --> 11:33.660]  wars growing and reaching more and more people was when I put out police state
[11:33.660 --> 11:41.660]  2000 in 1999 and authorized folks to make copies of the VHS and the DVD it was
[11:41.660 --> 11:44.660]  the best seller for me at the time it allowed me to hire some crew members
[11:44.660 --> 11:50.660]  build a better studio and a lot of stuff that film became a hit that the Marines
[11:50.660 --> 11:54.660]  who featured largely in the film running checkpoints preparing for urban
[11:54.660 --> 11:59.660]  warfare gun confiscation the Marines were upset by the fact that they were being
[11:59.660 --> 12:05.660]  trained for gun confiscation they watched the film it caused a huge debate and
[12:05.660 --> 12:10.660]  the Marines were told in briefings all over the United States came down from
[12:10.660 --> 12:16.660]  Clinton it came down from the high brass do not watch Alex Jones do not listen
[12:16.660 --> 12:23.660]  to him well most of them didn't know who I was so it made that film a super hot
[12:23.660 --> 12:32.660]  cause celeb documentary that was passed out on military bases then it became
[12:32.660 --> 12:37.660]  popular in the army they would run the Marines run the army give them PT duty
[12:37.660 --> 12:44.660]  write them up you name it chew them out some commanders would call them in and
[12:44.660 --> 12:49.660]  say you know I trust you guys this is America's the first amendment we
[12:49.660 --> 12:55.660]  shouldn't be trained to confiscate guns I want you to watch this film so their
[12:55.660 --> 13:01.660]  attempt to do that totally backfired and that's what's happening here and you
[13:01.660 --> 13:05.660]  know I saw some of the comments on infowars.com by the hired paid trolls on
[13:05.660 --> 13:09.660]  record it's on record they have literally sock puppets is what they call
[13:09.660 --> 13:13.660]  these computer programs that a person loads in the responses but then the
[13:13.660 --> 13:21.660]  sock puppets go out an auto post with bots to the comment sections and they
[13:21.660 --> 13:25.660]  basically cause the Streisand effect before the Streisand effect was even
[13:25.660 --> 13:29.660]  known to exist in 2003 the Streisand effect is a phenomenon whereby an
[13:29.660 --> 13:33.660]  attempt to hide remove our sensor piece of information has the unintended
[13:33.660 --> 13:37.660]  consequence of publicizing the information more widely using facilitated by
[13:37.660 --> 13:41.660]  the Internet using facilitated it's named after American entertainer Barbara
[13:41.660 --> 13:45.660]  Streisand who attempted in 2003 four years after this happened to me to
[13:45.660 --> 13:49.660]  suppress photographs of a residence in Malibu California and inadvertently
[13:49.660 --> 13:53.660]  generating further publicity similar attempts have been made for example in
[13:53.660 --> 13:57.660]  cease and desist letters to suppress numbers files and websites instead of
[13:57.660 --> 14:01.660]  being suppressed the information receives extensive publicity and media
[14:01.660 --> 14:07.660]  extensions such as videos and spoof songs often being widely mirrored across
[14:07.660 --> 14:15.660]  the Internet or distributed on file sharing networks now the system is not
[14:15.660 --> 14:21.660]  stupid up at the top but they have an authoritarian streak to want to just
[14:21.660 --> 14:27.660]  shut me up and shut you up the problem is we're so prolific and we're on so many
[14:27.660 --> 14:31.660]  platforms growing under the censorship see when they would hack and attack one
[14:31.660 --> 14:35.660]  website or ban it I would just start four or five remember I used to have all
[14:35.660 --> 14:39.660]  those in four hours dot net still up Jones report dot com we don't really update
[14:39.660 --> 14:43.660]  we're gonna do something big with it soon because they were always hitting my sites
[14:43.660 --> 14:47.660]  and attacking them every time we were attacked or sensor we would launch a new
[14:47.660 --> 14:51.660]  website that was a primitive form of social network or primitive form of
[14:51.660 --> 14:57.660]  distributing yourself as the MySpace and Facebook's came along we multi distributed
[14:57.660 --> 15:01.660]  over to those but we're gonna launch more shopping carts we're gonna launch more
[15:01.660 --> 15:06.660]  subscribe into more podcast services for you Roku boxy we're already on that for
[15:06.660 --> 15:11.660]  years prison planet dot TV is our own video audio platform to fight
[15:11.660 --> 15:17.660]  censorship just like in studies if a plant doesn't get wind doesn't get rain
[15:17.660 --> 15:21.660]  just gets barely watered it's weak but if it grows under rain and under
[15:21.660 --> 15:28.660]  sleet and under wind if it survives it's stronger
[15:28.660 --> 15:34.660]  and that's the same thing happening here today we expect to be attacked we
[15:34.660 --> 15:39.660]  expect to then each time analyze what the establishment's doing and then grow
[15:39.660 --> 15:45.660]  stronger against that to use an alien analogy like the new movie that I think
[15:45.660 --> 15:51.660]  is pretty good I should do a review of edge of tomorrow where the aliens that
[15:51.660 --> 15:57.660]  invade control time and so they just continue to reset the day over and over
[15:57.660 --> 16:05.660]  again so that the humans can't defeat them but as soon as the humans
[16:05.660 --> 16:09.660]  discover that well they start time traveling as well I'm just gonna leave it
[16:09.660 --> 16:15.660]  at that I'm not gonna give the plot completely away but the global issues
[16:15.660 --> 16:20.660]  supercomputers and their systems of control to not reset the day but always
[16:20.660 --> 16:24.660]  relaunched come like every major city votes down light rail boondoggle scams
[16:24.660 --> 16:28.660]  five ten fifteen times they just keep coming back keep coming back till they
[16:28.660 --> 16:33.660]  finally get it or just do without a vote see we win victories all the time but
[16:33.660 --> 16:38.660]  then think oh I'm not gonna go fight it again the whole war is about realizing
[16:38.660 --> 16:44.660]  that you've got to continue to engage over and over and over and over again
[16:44.660 --> 16:48.660]  and that's what makes you stronger each time it's called the animating contest
[16:48.660 --> 16:56.660]  of liberty aka to quote Thomas Jefferson so you're not animated when you don't
[16:56.660 --> 17:00.660]  care about anybody or yourself or geopolitics or the world you're one of
[17:00.660 --> 17:06.660]  these statistically in studies totally unhappy self-centered narcissistic
[17:06.660 --> 17:11.660]  bots that isn't even human that just runs around regurgitating what mainstream
[17:11.660 --> 17:16.660]  media dumped into their head I mean we all know these people that are fad driven
[17:16.660 --> 17:21.660]  they literally aren't real people they just regurgitate television mainstream
[17:21.660 --> 17:28.660]  garbage they're unsuccessful pathetic people no one wants to be around them
[17:28.660 --> 17:33.660]  except other trendies who all just sit around insecure at Lee bleeding like
[17:33.660 --> 17:39.660]  parents so you can go see the letters issued to the military access denied
[17:39.660 --> 17:46.660]  net war com policy department of defense issued yesterday info wars dot com
[17:46.660 --> 17:53.660]  banned and you are not to visit it now the only way this will work is if they
[17:53.660 --> 17:57.660]  censor us and others and no one comes to our aid and there isn't a Streisand
[17:57.660 --> 18:03.660]  effect and then it sets the precedent they'll start censoring everybody so we
[18:03.660 --> 18:08.660]  hang together or we hang separate but people are getting upset about this
[18:08.660 --> 18:13.660]  blue coat this is separate from blue coat big billion-dollar private NSA tech
[18:13.660 --> 18:17.660]  firm that sells spy technology to companies basically to spy on their
[18:17.660 --> 18:23.660]  employees and others they have limited Lee removed us from most of the public
[18:23.660 --> 18:32.660]  databases but still have us in the governmental databases but this is

[33:42.660 --> 33:46.660]  all their attempts over the years in this credit matt rudge and drudgereport.com
[33:46.660 --> 33:51.660]  has made the number one news aggregate site in the world the pentagon under
[33:51.660 --> 33:56.660]  clinton's attempt to ban info wars dot com in my films back in 1999
[33:56.660 --> 34:02.660]  literally tripled my audience overnight by word of mouth and sales of the film
[34:02.660 --> 34:08.660]  exploded and we noticed almost every order was marines and army people or
[34:08.660 --> 34:13.660]  their families ordering the film that they were told they couldn't see
[34:13.660 --> 34:20.660]  literally i can track what put us financially on the map to expand from
[34:20.660 --> 34:25.660]  it being just myself and buckley ham and my cousin part-time helping me along

[34:38.660 --> 34:44.660]  us and now they're doing it again and we're seeing surges of traffic because
[34:44.660 --> 34:50.660]  when people can't get on something they want on it and people ask the
[34:50.660 --> 34:54.660]  question well then why do they do that because the control freaks always
[34:54.660 --> 34:58.660]  think they can dominate everybody but what happens when you try to put a
[34:58.660 --> 35:02.660]  beach ball on the bottom of the pool you might be able to fight to get it down
[35:02.660 --> 35:07.660]  to the bottom but what happens once you get it six seven feet under the water
[35:07.660 --> 35:14.660]  and then let it go it explodes upward that's why good men and women have to
[35:14.660 --> 35:21.660]  fight tyranny is to create the magical animating contest it is in the contest
[35:21.660 --> 35:27.660]  that we grow stronger that we learn the enemy that we show people the example
[35:27.660 --> 35:32.660]  of choice good people have laid down for so long and done whatever the corrupt
[35:32.660 --> 35:37.660]  social engineers have said that the public didn't even know that there were
[35:37.660 --> 35:45.660]  options but military personnel warned me about urban warfare drills for gun
[35:45.660 --> 35:55.660]  confiscation I went out videotaped it exposed it the Marines then along with
[35:55.660 --> 35:59.660]  Clinton got me fired but I'd already started this indicated radio show out of
[35:59.660 --> 36:04.660]  my house oh I forgot the rest of story when that blew up in their face they
[36:04.660 --> 36:09.660]  called me in to the general manager's office at the FM where I was number one
[36:09.660 --> 36:12.660]  in town and they said we don't care if you're bringing a lot of money here we
[36:12.660 --> 36:16.660]  don't care if you're bringing in top ratings we've been told from the national
[36:16.660 --> 36:20.660]  level the owners of shamrock communication the political strings have been
[36:20.660 --> 36:24.660]  pulled and they're getting a lot of heat and this company doesn't want to be
[36:24.660 --> 36:28.660]  audited and he said by the way I'm a marine former marine as well I want to
[36:28.660 --> 36:32.660]  talk about my marines and I said I'm not about your marines the Marines
[36:32.660 --> 36:37.660]  should be trained to confiscate guns and they then called in the head GM of the
[36:37.660 --> 36:41.660]  whole company that owned newspapers TV stations radio stations all over the
[36:41.660 --> 36:45.660]  country about a month later they said listen we're going to fire you do you
[36:45.660 --> 36:52.660]  understand if you don't shut up about Bill Clinton and about the military and
[36:52.660 --> 36:57.660]  what they're doing and I I didn't BS them but I just went well I'll try to
[36:57.660 --> 37:01.660]  get back on that I didn't and boy they called me in about a month later and
[37:01.660 --> 37:04.660]  they said you get your stuff and you get out of here and the guy wanted me to
[37:04.660 --> 37:07.660]  get in a fight with him I just laughed at him the guy went you know you're not
[37:07.660 --> 37:12.660]  on any radio stations by the way your career is over quit lying and saying
[37:12.660 --> 37:16.660]  you're on over 10 stations from your house because I've been syndicated a
[37:16.660 --> 37:23.660]  couple years out of my house on little bitty networks and I just said okay I
[37:23.660 --> 37:27.660]  had my films going out virally that people can make copies of I had my
[37:27.660 --> 37:31.660]  news website already for three years at that time that was more like a bulletin
[37:31.660 --> 37:34.660]  board like drudge report I could just put links to things I was proving or
[37:34.660 --> 37:38.660]  photos I'd taken because I couldn't pay for the bandwidth of actually posting
[37:38.660 --> 37:42.660]  articles or videos but sometimes I could post photos and get huge bills which
[37:42.660 --> 37:48.660]  forced me to want to make money just to pay the bandwidth bill I never even
[37:48.660 --> 37:53.660]  dream would grow to this size but you know it didn't matter folks I didn't
[37:53.660 --> 37:57.660]  feel sorry for myself and go quit and you know go open a bottle of Jack Daniels
[37:57.660 --> 38:02.660]  because I got fired from my top radio show in Austin I had already known that
[38:02.660 --> 38:07.660]  job wasn't safe I had already made preparations years before and again I'm
[38:07.660 --> 38:11.660]  not talking about myself here ladies and gentlemen I'm talking about what you
[38:11.660 --> 38:15.660]  can do don't take the fact that this shows here for granted don't take any
[38:15.660 --> 38:18.660]  freedom you've got for granted don't take that your bank account is there today
[38:18.660 --> 38:21.660]  for granted don't take that you've got your job today for granted don't take
[38:21.660 --> 38:26.660]  you've got your health today for granted the globalist are usurping
[38:26.660 --> 38:31.660]  everything we've got they're stealing everything we've got to dominate and
[38:31.660 --> 38:41.660]  control us and all I want to do is live in a free society doesn't mean you
[38:41.660 --> 38:45.660]  got to agree with me but we know we're going in the opposite direction of a
[38:45.660 --> 38:51.660]  free society and my message to you is you have power start a YouTube channel
[38:51.660 --> 38:57.660]  start a local online podcast start a local newsletter newspaper start a local
[38:57.660 --> 39:02.660]  radio show start a local access show doesn't matter if you don't have all the
[39:02.660 --> 39:07.660]  answers doesn't matter if you don't want to be famous you're the type of people
[39:07.660 --> 39:13.660]  we need who are in this for the right reasons to go out there and take action
[39:13.660 --> 39:18.660]  and not get caught up in the FBI funded Cointel pro cognitive infiltration
[39:18.660 --> 39:23.660]  infighting the reason I've been successful is I don't infight I move forward
[39:23.660 --> 39:28.660]  most people get caught up in that he said she said name calling it's all by
[39:28.660 --> 39:32.660]  design move forward against the globalist we will win now I want to get into
[39:32.660 --> 39:37.660]  all this news I'm going to tie together two men arrested in Texas on terrorism
[39:37.660 --> 39:47.660]  charges trying to aid the Syrian rebels ISIS that's one hand not known what the
[39:47.660 --> 39:54.660]  other hands doing terrorist supporter Martin Dempsey chairman of the joint
[39:54.660 --> 40:01.660]  chiefs terrorists in Iraq have partnered with Saddam Hussein's old party that is
[40:01.660 --> 40:08.660]  total twisting we're going to explain that so see oh the ISIS groups with
[40:08.660 --> 40:15.660]  Saddam really I didn't know it was being funded by Obama and how that ties
[40:15.660 --> 40:19.660]  together with former teacher charged with sexual assault released on bail
[40:19.660 --> 40:26.660]  admits he raped a six-year-old girl and has been released from jail on a tiny
[40:26.660 --> 40:34.660]  bond paid 5,000 on the $50,000 bond that's what you get out on or 10% and he
[40:34.660 --> 40:38.660]  has basically admitted to a bunch of other stuff with little girls how does
[40:38.660 --> 40:43.660]  this tie into all this I'm going to explain a moment but first off I take it
[40:43.660 --> 40:47.660]  in the morning I take it at noon I take it in the evening all times I just mix
[40:47.660 --> 40:52.660]  it all together in a glass of water together survival shield nascent iodine
[40:52.660 --> 40:59.660]  X2 the only purple crystal source 7 to 12,000 feet mined here in the United
[40:59.660 --> 41:07.660]  States true nascent pure iodine the real deal just an example is that the
[41:07.660 --> 41:11.660]  regular so-called nascent iodine which still everybody needs obviously turns
[41:11.660 --> 41:16.660]  black on paper well if you read real nascent iodine's purple and turns
[41:16.660 --> 41:20.660]  electric blue that's why our original survival shield turns electric blue
[41:20.660 --> 41:25.660]  purple this turns bright electric blue purple we have a time test to show
[41:25.660 --> 41:30.660]  that survival shield turns purple pretty much instantly the survival shield
[41:30.660 --> 41:38.660]  X2 is brown-red and then turns deep electric purple X2 survival shield the
[41:38.660 --> 41:44.660]  strongest nascent iodine out there but does it make me sick like other leading
[41:44.660 --> 41:47.660]  brands that's why I was going to carry the others but we went out and developed
[41:47.660 --> 41:50.660]  this with Dr. Group because he already had it in the pipeline because this is
[41:50.660 --> 41:54.660]  giving me the best results and results may vary but all we've gotten is positive
[41:54.660 --> 41:58.660]  reviews you've heard them you will go through a detox folks consult your
[41:58.660 --> 42:03.660]  health practitioner or medical provider but you the research on iodine is
[42:03.660 --> 42:07.660]  well-known this is not the iodate and all the other stuff that's bound and not
[42:07.660 --> 42:12.660]  nascent this is the pure stuff okay this is the stuff that was put in here is
[42:12.660 --> 42:17.660]  highly controlled a lot of hoops had to be jumped through to get this key element
[42:17.660 --> 42:23.660]  and that's why in the pure form before we put it into the palm oil and go
[42:23.660 --> 42:29.660]  through a proprietary process it turns into gas in the air I mean this stuff
[42:29.660 --> 42:32.660]  will eat through the floor not the stuff you're buying from us it's been it's
[42:32.660 --> 42:36.660]  been putting a solution to be safe but the true crystals like alien blood in
[42:36.660 --> 42:42.660]  the 1970s movie alien literally will eat through steel ladies and gentlemen can

[45:27.660 --> 45:35.660]  morning and I hear 590 our local affiliate am talking about a elementary
[45:35.660 --> 45:46.660]  school first grade teacher Alfredo Gaitan charge was sexual assault
[45:46.660 --> 45:53.660]  released on bail for $5,000 he posted a $50,000 bond paid $5,000 you pay 10%
[45:53.660 --> 45:59.660]  and get out and he has admitted to police he did it and now they're saying
[45:59.660 --> 46:02.660]  it's a bunch of other little girls that he would hold whoever he wanted back
[46:02.660 --> 46:07.660]  during recess I mean I don't want to shoot my mouth off but if some man
[46:07.660 --> 46:13.660]  that did that to my six-year-old daughter I have a six-year-old daughter
[46:13.660 --> 46:16.660]  just as a matter of course I'm coming after you I'm not even calling the
[46:16.660 --> 46:22.660]  police and in the old days that's how it was so people didn't do stuff like
[46:22.660 --> 46:32.660]  this now this happened in north Austin on the round rock arrest at him
[46:32.660 --> 46:38.660]  basically a suburb of Austin Austin an independent school district it
[46:38.660 --> 46:41.660]  happened in Austin but I guess also wouldn't do anything so I guess they
[46:41.660 --> 46:50.660]  had round rock do it and and I'm not bashing Austin the point is is that
[46:50.660 --> 46:53.660]  we're getting to the point now where no one will even stop these people and I
[46:53.660 --> 46:59.660]  heard all of this outrage going on about it's so terrible that this
[46:59.660 --> 47:03.660]  admitted child rapist I mean take one look at this guy if you're watching us
[47:03.660 --> 47:07.660]  on TV these guys don't care what color they are they all have the same
[47:07.660 --> 47:11.660]  wimpy look on their face I mean what kind of person wants to go after a
[47:11.660 --> 47:17.660]  little girl absolutely I want to say violent things I'm not going to say
[47:17.660 --> 47:20.660]  it right now and I'm not just trying to act tough I mean I'm just being honest
[47:20.660 --> 47:27.660]  I wear my emotions on my sleeve so I'm sure everybody's mad but everybody's
[47:27.660 --> 47:34.660]  been trained to not be mad about this next story according to jail records a
[47:34.660 --> 47:40.660]  former teacher arrested for sexually assaulting a six-year-old has been
[47:40.660 --> 47:45.660]  bonded out of jail Alfredo Guy Tan was arrested on Friday after police say he
[47:45.660 --> 47:50.660]  confessed to the assault he accused he's accused of holding a girl back after
[47:50.660 --> 47:55.660]  recess at rally elementary last week and forcing her to perform sexual acts on
[47:55.660 --> 47:59.660]  him I'll perform an act on his head with a baseball bat it was my daughter
[47:59.660 --> 48:07.660]  police charged him with aggravated sexual assault and since his arrest four
[48:07.660 --> 48:11.660]  more students within the Austin independent school district have come
[48:11.660 --> 48:17.660]  forward with allegations of sexual misconduct man you hear about this
[48:17.660 --> 48:23.660]  stuff all the time and and now here's the rest of story here's the rest of
[48:23.660 --> 48:31.660]  story remember this on a world that daily a few weeks ago release of 36,000
[48:31.660 --> 48:37.660]  criminal aliens impeachable offense 36,000 with aggravated assault records
[48:37.660 --> 48:43.660]  including sexual assault rape of children and decency with children bank
[48:43.660 --> 48:49.660]  robbery arson and they're just released members the railway killer who killed
[48:49.660 --> 48:52.660]  20 plus people and they kept arresting him and releasing him because he was
[48:52.660 --> 48:56.660]  an illegal alien and had fake names I mean if you're running from the law
[48:56.660 --> 49:00.660]  from Latin America 800 million people are down there you just come here and
[49:00.660 --> 49:06.660]  you're above the law and the borders just wide open so see when I see an article
[49:06.660 --> 49:13.660]  like this it makes me think about how America is now a criminal playground
[49:13.660 --> 49:19.660]  for people from Latin America to just come here and do whatever they want
[49:19.660 --> 49:24.660]  ladies and gentlemen and it's not that people I guess are criminals in Latin
[49:24.660 --> 49:28.660]  America on average even though it's very kleptocratic society people just
[49:28.660 --> 49:32.660]  given up on corruption let the criminals run wild at every level it's that
[49:32.660 --> 49:37.660]  statistically the criminals are coming here and America is a big joke now
[49:37.660 --> 49:43.660]  let's shift gears back into Austin again this is how my brain works I saw this
[49:43.660 --> 49:48.660]  article this morning and instantly thought you've got the FBI doing their job
[49:48.660 --> 49:53.660]  with one hand and then with the other hand you've got Obama the Pentagon and
[49:53.660 --> 49:58.660]  NATO arming the ISI and the Al Qaeda on record for three and a half years
[49:58.660 --> 50:06.660]  against Libya Syria and now Iraq two men arrested in Texas on terrorism charges
[50:06.660 --> 50:11.660]  the two men and we've got photos of these morons one of them's named Khan the
[50:11.660 --> 50:17.660]  others wolf two men in Central Texas have been arrested on charges of trying to
[50:17.660 --> 50:21.660]  provide material support to terrorists with one of the pair speaking to aid
[50:21.660 --> 50:26.660]  extremist groups fighting in Syria US prosecutors said yesterday
[50:26.660 --> 50:32.660]  Rattal Askemi Khan 23 was arrested at his home in Austin suburb of
[50:32.660 --> 50:38.660]  Round Rock and charged with terrorist activities including committing
[50:38.660 --> 50:45.660]  violent jihad according to court documents unsealed yesterday wolf was
[50:45.660 --> 50:51.660]  arrested at Bush Air National Airport in Houston on Thursday attempted to
[50:51.660 --> 50:54.660]  provide material support I guess I'm going to join the terrorists how are they

[53:12.660 --> 53:18.660]  food for patriots was an opportunity for me to be able to put some things aside
[53:18.660 --> 53:22.660]  I said well this is a product worth having seen as it's so good

[53:39.660 --> 53:42.660]  and this came so quick it came right when they said it was top
[53:42.660 --> 53:46.660]  thanks for supplying all this stuff for us because I think we're all going to be needing it
[53:46.660 --> 53:48.660]  in a very short time
[53:48.660 --> 53:52.660]  join over 50,000 Americans who have trusted food for patriots
[53:52.660 --> 54:08.660]  getsurvivalfood.com to learn more that's getsurvivalfood.com
[54:08.660 --> 54:13.660]  in 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi
[54:13.660 --> 54:19.660]  we took a little bacon by the way I was conflating the ground rock arrest of the reported terrorist
[54:19.660 --> 54:24.660]  trying to support Obama's forces and Saudi Arabian forces in Iraq and Syria
[54:24.660 --> 54:30.660]  and the admitted confessed child pervert child rapist
[54:30.660 --> 54:34.660]  Austin did arrest this guy in north Austin and so good job Austin
[54:34.660 --> 54:40.660]  but now the court has just let him go for $5,000 after being in jail three days
[54:40.660 --> 54:45.660]  and then I was dovetailing that with two men arrested in Texas
[54:45.660 --> 54:50.660]  on the terrorism charges up in round rock north of Austin
[54:50.660 --> 54:53.660]  and the fact that they were arrested were trying to raise money
[54:53.660 --> 54:59.660]  or get weapons or plan to go to Syria to join the groups
[54:59.660 --> 55:04.660]  who are being openly given a green light and weapons by our government
[55:04.660 --> 55:12.660]  so that just shows how uncoordinated and out of control the compartmentalization is
[55:12.660 --> 55:17.660]  whereas you've got FBI and people following the law arresting people
[55:17.660 --> 55:22.660]  that give aid to known terrorist organizations while at the top Obama gives stinger missiles to them
[55:22.660 --> 55:30.660]  and by the way before I get to all these video clips and our guest that's joining us
[55:30.660 --> 55:36.660]  we've got a special report with David Knight not a chance that IRS officials are telling the truth about missing emails
[55:36.660 --> 55:43.660]  it's a very good report Fox and Friends has a report detailing that Health and Human Services
[55:43.660 --> 55:49.660]  is just giving illegal alien children to their extended families in the U.S.
[55:49.660 --> 55:52.660]  well it's beyond that they're taking adults and doing it too
[55:52.660 --> 55:57.660]  we broke that yesterday no one's picked it up it's so sensational
[55:57.660 --> 56:02.660]  so off the chart that no one's picking it up even though if it gets picked up it could put a stop to it
[56:02.660 --> 56:07.660]  no one can believe the border patrol under orders loads them up at the border and ships them into the country
[56:07.660 --> 56:16.660]  wait a minute drudge just did drudge just went with a red link incredible incredible drudgereport.com comes to the rescue
[56:16.660 --> 56:22.660]  claim homeland security paying free legals to be escorted into the United States
[56:22.660 --> 56:27.660]  and then we have DHS to pay for illegal immigrants to be escorted into the United States
[56:27.660 --> 56:32.660]  miners up to the age of 17 to be brought in with dignity and respect a taxpayer expense
[56:32.660 --> 56:39.660]  that's a Paul Joseph Watson article and it goes over the solicitation
[56:39.660 --> 56:45.660]  but that's just a blurb Watson put out we've got to add to this right now
[56:45.660 --> 56:53.660]  Chikari Jackson's video where the head of emergency management can you call Kit Daniels in here please
[56:53.660 --> 57:00.660]  see I've noticed news this big in this bombshell it is like so over the top people don't even know how to deal with it
[57:00.660 --> 57:05.660]  it's like the government funding Al Qaeda it's just hard for people to believe I'm going to talk to him on air
[57:05.660 --> 57:11.660]  hey Kit come on come in you did a great job yesterday just taking the video and just adding the transcript of the
[57:11.660 --> 57:19.660]  McAllen emergency manager to it I want to add to Watson just that transcript about you know in a separate story confirming this
[57:19.660 --> 57:25.660]  because this is going to be attacked and denied because it's so hardcore the emergency manager said they arrive with their
[57:25.660 --> 57:30.660]  tickets given to him by the board of patrol to be shipped quote into the interior and I and we have the video of it
[57:30.660 --> 57:40.660]  just just just basically take that article and add it under Watson's that has the government solicitation at FBO.gov
[57:40.660 --> 57:47.660]  where they're admitting it here so really the government is admitting it here it's already going on
[57:47.660 --> 57:52.660]  they're just getting ready to mainline it and so I guess drudge is careful about only reporting accurate stuff so
[57:52.660 --> 57:59.660]  he waited till even more proof came out to link to this but this is this is huge because if we force this out as well
[57:59.660 --> 58:07.660]  I was running around on a check on my head cut off yesterday if we force this out it is going to be a big big big big deal
[58:07.660 --> 58:14.660]  because we have them red handed the buses come in the board patrol lets them in the board patrol gives them the vouchers so just
[58:14.660 --> 58:19.660]  take your article your transcript add it to the bottom of Watson's just as if it's the article
[58:19.660 --> 58:23.660]  and say confirming this here's the video and then you know just break it down okay
[58:23.660 --> 58:30.660]  redlinkedondrudgereport.com we need this to go mega viral right now good job Watson finding that

[1:00:43.660 --> 1:00:49.660]  and that is an info wars.com story DHS to pay for illegal immigrants to be escorted into the U.S.
[1:00:49.660 --> 1:00:57.660]  minors up to age 17 to be brought in with dignity and respect to taxpayer expense and again that's from the federal government
[1:00:57.660 --> 1:01:04.660]  immigration and customs prospectus okay so once you everybody understand that's from FBO.gov
[1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:10.660]  in fact in case they pull it guys I want a screenshot of that add it to the article
[1:01:10.660 --> 1:01:17.660]  we're going to blow their operation wide open force the public debate about the mega trees and with Obama
[1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:26.660]  giving press conferences saying come to America and honoring illegal alien children that got here illegally
[1:01:26.660 --> 1:01:33.660]  this is all designed to cause a catastrophe and then no one will get in trouble when the border completely collapses
[1:01:33.660 --> 1:01:40.660]  I mean already in New York and Virginia in Democrat held cities they are flipping out as tens of thousands show up
[1:01:40.660 --> 1:01:48.660]  it's like a bomb going off ladies and gentlemen Austin didn't get a lot of the Katrina refugees but we got some
[1:01:48.660 --> 1:01:54.660]  not as much as Houston or San Antonio or Dallas crime exploded there were people all over the streets
[1:01:54.660 --> 1:02:03.660]  and muggings and I mean it's just a fact folks the New Orleans ward folks are really violent and really on average
[1:02:03.660 --> 1:02:09.660]  a very criminal culture probably one of the most criminal in the country and I mean it's not a fun situation
[1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:19.660]  for anybody that had you know the New Orleans sixth generation you know in some case welfare folks
[1:02:19.660 --> 1:02:28.660]  dumped in your city it's not pretty well now that's happening where Castro took a huge giant steaming you know what
[1:02:28.660 --> 1:02:35.660]  on Florida with the dregs of his presence in the 80s repeatedly with the Cuban boat lifts now this is every Latin
[1:02:35.660 --> 1:02:45.660]  America country in the Caribbean with a pipeline like a giant toilet with the dregs of society directly into this country
[1:02:45.660 --> 1:02:53.660]  and I don't want to hear it from people that haven't been to Latin America my cousin Buckley grew up in Guatemala
[1:02:53.660 --> 1:03:00.660]  and they were at the market and saw people blow up with a hand grenade he was what he was kidnapped once
[1:03:00.660 --> 1:03:09.660]  and they finally left the country so I mean I don't want to live like that being kidnapped and having dirt floors
[1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:15.660]  and chickens running around the street and you know what it's coming it's coming I mean there are large areas of
[1:03:15.660 --> 1:03:22.660]  Florida look like Haiti now with broken sewage pipes and you've you've been to Haiti folks probably the biggest
[1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:32.660]  hellhole on earth and there's no helping these third world countries unless you try to export freedom to them
[1:03:32.660 --> 1:03:38.660]  you don't then create a conduit to this nation so that's coming up we're gonna be breaking that down
[1:03:38.660 --> 1:03:43.660]  I want to come back from break and just get ahead of smattering of news I haven't hit yet ahead of our
[1:03:43.660 --> 1:03:51.660]  former State Department official guest who's a very articulate and an elegant speaker on the subject of Iraq
[1:03:51.660 --> 1:03:57.660]  and what's currently happening there as Obama is set to speak and announce that a bunch of US special forces are
[1:03:57.660 --> 1:04:08.660]  going to be sent to supposedly attack ISIS who has been given US weapons and NATO weapons and Qatari and Saudi Arabian
[1:04:08.660 --> 1:04:17.660]  weapons Saudi Arabia is behind this we have our Israeli sources US sources Pentagon sources they all concur with
[1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:27.660]  Aaron Klein said yesterday from Tel Aviv that Saudi Arabia claims they're going rogue but that's with Obama backing
[1:04:27.660 --> 1:04:33.660]  as a double game probably to suck Iran and who they claim they made a deal with I believe it's a quadruple cross
[1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:41.660]  not a triple cross at least a quadruple cross and by the time you get to triple crosses it's just pure evil and the
[1:04:41.660 --> 1:04:49.660]  evil mind thinks that in dishonor they are winning because they don't play by rules the truth is they're just destroying civilization
[1:04:49.660 --> 1:05:12.660]  so this is a quadruple cross that's coming up stay with us in the near future when you realize how fake it all is the
[1:05:12.660 --> 1:05:20.660]  worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible prime director didn't credit Alex Jones

[1:08:34.660 --> 1:08:43.660]  on info wars dot com yesterday the Daily Mail mentioned it today in an article but drudge report dot com has it red linked
[1:08:43.660 --> 1:08:51.660]  we need this to go totally viral red linked drudge report dot com claim but it's directly to the federal government's
[1:08:51.660 --> 1:09:00.660]  purchase website for bids homeland paying free legals to be escorted into the U.S. and then we have video of the head of emergency management
[1:09:00.660 --> 1:09:09.660]  not just the document in mcowen texas major city on the border saying no 90 plus percent of the illegals that show up are
[1:09:09.660 --> 1:09:19.660]  given bus voucher tickets to go quote into the interior of the country to their families you don't go through immigration
[1:09:19.660 --> 1:09:27.660]  you don't go through customs if I fly out of the country to cover something when I come back I'm asked am I a terrorist do I have drugs
[1:09:27.660 --> 1:09:34.660]  why is your passport a few years old you know and they want to look you up and down and let you know you're a piece of filth
[1:09:34.660 --> 1:09:40.660]  but if I'm an illegal alien they go here's a free ticket I only want to know your name we're not going to take your fingerprints
[1:09:40.660 --> 1:09:49.660]  nothing by the way they're moving to fingerprints citizens when we fly period I'm sure you know that they're doing those tests in airports where
[1:09:49.660 --> 1:09:59.660]  you will biometrically retina and thumb print to fly from Dallas to New York because it's only used to control us the schmucks
[1:09:59.660 --> 1:10:09.660]  the suckers the joke the marks the food we are the right whale why was the right well called the right well
[1:10:09.660 --> 1:10:17.660]  there were hundreds of thousands of them estimated and there was only a few dozen left when they stopped whaling them by the 1920s
[1:10:17.660 --> 1:10:24.660]  because the right whale will come over and nudge your boat and will play with you and is real sweet and won't run when you come in Harpoon
[1:10:24.660 --> 1:10:33.660]  and it's got more oil than a sperm well that will try to kill you or other wells for that matter they're nice they're sweet a divers now
[1:10:33.660 --> 1:10:40.660]  that's one of the most elite things to do is there's still not a lot of them even other numbers have gone into the tens of thousands you have to go find them
[1:10:40.660 --> 1:10:52.660]  divers get in with them and pet them and they come over to you it's illegal in the US to pet whales and approach a marine mammals but it's not in other countries
[1:10:52.660 --> 1:11:01.660]  and they're just a sweet whale gullible and mindless they're like a five year old that gets in a car you know with a guy driving a white van
[1:11:01.660 --> 1:11:10.660]  because he says he has candy and a puppy and it's the same deal no one on earth would say come here you'll be instantly legalized
[1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:19.660]  put on welfare given bus tickets come on and I'm predicting wasn't hard to predict two plus two equals four like I did last year
[1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:28.660]  that Obama saying we're going to stop deportations was going to cause a massive surge the massive surges come
[1:11:28.660 --> 1:11:38.660]  they're rolling out an even bigger red carpet now the super surge and then the total search we're getting tens of thousands a week
[1:11:38.660 --> 1:11:47.660]  hundreds of thousands every few months it will then be millions per month and then tens of millions a year
[1:11:47.660 --> 1:11:57.660]  and it will it will be the collapse of civilization the giant FEMA camps will be open to hold the third world population a civil emergency will be declared
[1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:16.660]  and I didn't just think that up my shelf Colonel Oliver North headed up Rex 84 for the continuity of government COG for the National Security Council
[1:12:16.660 --> 1:12:21.660]  and when Republicans and Democrats found out about it they blew the whistle and I ran contrary and the program got suspended
[1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:32.660]  they were planning to cause a collapse in Mexico which they may have done actually decades later to cause a collapse influx and to use that as the cover for martial law
[1:12:32.660 --> 1:12:46.660]  now it looks like Obama dusted off Rex 84 the more things change the more they stay the same I mean these globalist man they just do the same thing over and over and over again
[1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:52.660]  by the way none of this is my opinion Rex 84 was in the Miami Herald there were congressional hearings what you're hearing here is not my opinion
[1:12:52.660 --> 1:13:03.660]  people need to start learning that ladies and gentlemen this is not my opinion it is a fact and we're just going to add the video in the article
[1:13:03.660 --> 1:13:14.660]  Watson's link to it that it subsequently emerged at the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol was paying for bus tickets and vouchers in order to help the illegals be transported into the country
[1:13:14.660 --> 1:13:25.660]  and we have the quotes we're just going to beef up the article add those and add the video so that no one can be in denial about this but this can stop them now before the full collapse
[1:13:25.660 --> 1:13:33.660]  and guys mark down this prediction we need to mark down the dates of specific predictions so we can go back
[1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:53.660]  okay so it is 1213 central time we did the show live on the 19th day of June 2014 and we'll be here in six months with five million extra illegals and crime waves and collapses and everything else
[1:13:53.660 --> 1:14:07.660]  I'd say five to eight months is my dead reckoning electrochemical computer analysis which is rarely wrong unless we stop this now my only predictions that don't come through you I'm sure you've noticed
[1:14:07.660 --> 1:14:19.660]  or when we're able to make the prediction literally like the edge of tomorrow and people listen so we're able to do something preemptively by starting the clock back before it happens
[1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:27.660]  and God has always given us that chance with the minds he gave us to understand that those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it
[1:14:27.660 --> 1:14:37.660]  now I want to go into a constellation of clips before our guest joins us on the new giant war that's about to take place in Iraq that Obama will use as a distraction
[1:14:37.660 --> 1:14:52.660]  in having a fake fight with the people they've helped armed to the teeth so we'll get a former state department and Iraq experts take on this coming up but here is my son
[1:14:52.660 --> 1:15:09.660]  over a year ago did terrorism 101 this piece and he actually listens to the show he's that smart he was 10 then he's 11 now he was 10 years old he wrote this and shot it in two takes in the conference room here
[1:15:09.660 --> 1:15:19.660]  people ask why was he wearing a guy Fox mask because and I think it's reasonable my wife doesn't want his face on TV and guy Fox was British so he can do accents as well
[1:15:19.660 --> 1:15:33.660]  but the issue isn't that it's my son doing the piece I'm just letting you know who the person was who wrote and put out terrorism 101 by the many me of Alex Jones here it is
[1:15:33.660 --> 1:15:53.660]  hello your friendly neighborhood patriot here for an episode of how terrorism really works first off our terrorist group needs a scary name
[1:15:53.660 --> 1:16:14.660]  can you say LCI ADA let's try again LCI ADA does roll off the tongue LCI ADA it's a perfect name now let's say the green piece here represents the terrorists the terrorists then move into Pakistan or Afghanistan or whatever stand is not under
[1:16:14.660 --> 1:16:38.660]  the banker control the media then joins in to hype up the terror threat dry hand operates with impunity from safe havens inside Pakistan once the terror threat is established the banksters puppets send in the troops to take out the terrorists they put in there in the first place
[1:16:38.660 --> 1:16:56.660]  then the bankers install their own dictator to take control of the resources and oppress the people as a bonus the banks via the black ops and intelligence agencies will then ship the drugs back into the host country so they can imprison their own citizens for using the drugs
[1:16:56.660 --> 1:17:10.660]  make huge profits selling the drugs which finance other terror operations around the globe and the cherry on the top is billions upon billions made on money laundering operations for all the bankers
[1:17:10.660 --> 1:17:19.660]  in the sense you're watching as this opium is being grown I know it grinds at your gut how do you deal with it what are you doing about it
[1:17:19.660 --> 1:17:34.660]  frankly this is a part of their culture so while it might grind in my gut it's what they do and if the citizens of the host country gets wise to these games or gets uppity the banks via media will hype a nuclear terror threat
[1:17:34.660 --> 1:17:53.660]  they call it underwear bomber or Christmas tree bomber any excuse to take the American people's rights well that just about wraps it up for terrorism 101 how terrorism really works I'm your friendly neighborhood patriot and now remember what big brother and other
[1:17:53.660 --> 1:18:18.660]  historians say whatever you do don't visit infowalls.com oh no the control freaks don't like it you have done well my apprentice so that's my son a year ago terrorism 101 so this is terrorism 101 2014 and hopefully we'll take
[1:18:18.660 --> 1:18:32.660]  this live breakdown and re-airing of that video and repost it maybe as an article tomorrow morning going over terrorism 101 so people can understand what's really happening the next clip I want to play is
[1:18:32.660 --> 1:18:51.660]  Megan Kelly telling Dick Cheney yesterday that he's been discredited on Iraq I tell you Fox keeps doing that I'm gonna become a fan of Fox News they're also exposing that the government shipping and the illegals not just letting them be here but aiding and abetting it so that's now breaking on Fox as well
[1:18:51.660 --> 1:19:04.660]  let's go ahead and go to Megan Kelly talking to old Dick Cheney let me start with this this is from one item in the Washington Post posted by Paul Waldman today quote there is not a single person in America who has been more wrong
[1:19:04.660 --> 1:19:22.660]  and more shamelessly dishonest on the topic of Iraq than Dick Cheney and now is the cascade of misery and death and chaos he did so much to unleash rages anew Mr Cheney has the unadulterated gall to come before the country and tell us that it's all someone else's fault the suggestion
[1:19:22.660 --> 1:19:40.660]  that is that you cause this mass Mr. Vice President would say you well obviously I disagree I think we went into Iraq for very good all right look everybody knows I was against the war and I didn't like Bush but good job asking that real question and quoting that statement
[1:19:40.660 --> 1:19:58.660]  that's good but it's still Democrats and Republicans blaming each other as a distraction Obama funded ISIS with NATO to take over Syria now they're doing this that's the issue has nothing to do with Bush so this he did it they did it thing as a distraction
[1:20:21.660 --> 1:20:35.660]  folks we're in the weakest economy of our lifetime and it's likely to get much worse virtually zero sectors of the economy are hiring and workforce participation is at record lows and I'm here to tell you this may be the best thing that could happen to you

[1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:26.660]  a couple hours ago they announced Obama was going to have a press conference on Iraq at 1230 eastern well that would have been almost an hour ago
[1:24:26.660 --> 1:24:38.660]  and I guess they do this to build up the suspense as if he's really running something not the national security state all the special interest
[1:24:38.660 --> 1:25:07.660]  but I studied geopolitics I studied that region I have top experts on from around the world whether it's general Hamed Gull the former head of Pakistani intelligence or Ray McGovern the CIA morning briefer to George Bush senior and Ronald Reagan to folks like Colonel Shaffer that ran Stratus Ivy the group that was not authorized to kill bin Laden even though they were able to twice I have a lot of sources and I have sources in Israel we had them on yesterday high level sources
[1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:21.660]  and they say this is a triple quadruple cross Saudi Arabia going in alone but that's only cover so that any outcome can be declared a victory by Obama and the globalist the neocons are involved in this as well
[1:25:21.660 --> 1:25:41.660]  so the Brzezinski's involved the Wolfwood's doctrine the Brzezinski doctrine are almost identical there are two different power groups but they intersect at many levels Iran's involved but the president of Iraq has said that they're double crossing them as well and wanted to take about a third of the country as a new Shiite state
[1:25:41.660 --> 1:26:02.660]  you've got a Sunni group that wants to create a new country out of part of Syria and Western Central Iraq you got Saudi Arabia that said they want part of Iraq you've got a lot of weirdness going on here but it's a mess but no one can deny that Stinger missiles and other impads were given to these different jihadi groups
[1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:17.660]  Sunni groups out of Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is deeply involved in this it is quite a spaghetti bucket to really try to figure out but I think in the final equation the establishment think see con artists and
[1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:32.660]  authoritarians think that full spectrum dominance in my experience is really sophisticated the truth is it always unravels it's dishonorable corrupt authoritarian brains always think their subterfuge is in
[1:26:32.660 --> 1:26:47.660]  snaring everybody else but in the end it's the pit they fall into that's my view short segment long segment coming up Peter van Buren we meant well dot com is an author now he's a major whistleblower 22 year veteran the state department
[1:26:47.660 --> 1:27:06.660]  spent a lot of time in Iraq was part of a lot of the major psi op operations there and then he's gone public and currently works to represent the group working with Edward Snowden and trying to get his information out and again he resigned
[1:27:06.660 --> 1:27:19.660]  honorably because he was basically conscientious objector did not want to be involved in the immoral immoral things he saw happening only got three minutes I appreciate you coming on give me your bottom line take
[1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:34.660]  we're gonna come back on what's going on I just stated the bizarre gestalt what's your expert take I absolutely agree with that many people in the United States imagine this all as a chess game where there's our side and their side and we make
[1:27:34.660 --> 1:27:47.660]  a move and they make a move in fact it's completely chaotic there are so many different players so many different levels of war that it's absolutely inconceivable that the United States in intervention whether it's 100 special forces
[1:27:47.660 --> 1:27:57.660]  or 10,000 regular troops is going to make any significant difference other than to draw us back into the same quagmire I thought we walked out of three years ago
[1:27:57.660 --> 1:28:16.660]  continuum what we have in iraq now is inevitable is the inevitable outcome of the 2003 invasion in 1991 the first golf war the first president bush understood that he was resetting a balance of power in the
[1:28:16.660 --> 1:28:32.660]  Middle East it was messy it was uncomfortable but it was in balance and so after clearing the Iraqis out of Kuwait the United States did not invade iraq in 1991 and that was with the support of then secretary defense Dick Cheney
[1:28:32.660 --> 1:28:47.660]  who had his pre valdemort days in 2003 the invasion of iraq destroyed that balance of power it ended civil society in iraq and it set loose the forces that had been kept on at least a dull simmer
[1:28:47.660 --> 1:29:03.660]  suddenly Sunnis Shias Kurds were at the loose and that brought in the wolves the Iranians came in on the Shia side the Saudis and the Kuwaitis went in on the Sunni side the Kurds were settling scores with the Turks and with the Iranians
[1:29:03.660 --> 1:29:16.660]  and the United States was bumbling in the middle of all this trying to break up a fight with five pit bulls to stand in the middle of five pit bulls there's a real good chance that you're not sure who's going to win but you do know who's going to lose
[1:29:16.660 --> 1:29:32.660]  and in this case I'm afraid it was the United States who has made a terrible mistake by getting into iraq and is continuing to dig that hole deeper by reinserting themselves into iraq as we understand President Obama plans to announce
[1:29:32.660 --> 1:29:47.660]  and I think Peter van Buren is about the most articulate person we know on the subject of iraq I guess he's been there in the middle of it amazing I want to see where he thinks this is all going straight ahead we're going to break it all down stay with us I'm Alex Jones
[1:29:47.660 --> 1:30:13.660]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air
[1:30:13.660 --> 1:30:30.660]  and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[1:30:30.660 --> 1:30:45.660]  when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.

[1:33:12.660 --> 1:33:16.660]  in defense of human liberty Alex Jones
[1:33:16.660 --> 1:33:29.660]  I'm a little by morning
[1:33:29.660 --> 1:33:34.660]  but will it be Baghdad by morning the giant
[1:33:34.660 --> 1:33:50.660]  7 billion 10 billion there's different estimate dollar biggest US embassy in the world the middle of Baghdad the green zone already 200 plus troops sent to guard it you've got ISIS admittedly filled with Al Qaeda people and worse
[1:33:50.660 --> 1:34:19.660]  running around chopping the Iraqi military and police heads off murdering Christians and then I see Fareed Zarkaria on CNN endorsing it two mornings ago seeing how bad the president of Iraq is because he's with the Iranians and then I see the prime minister I call him president criticizing Iran claiming they're involved in a double deal wanting a war
[1:34:19.660 --> 1:34:24.660]  and then I see the weapons that were sent there
[1:34:24.660 --> 1:34:32.660]  to that region right across the border to Syria in the last three years clearly the the blame is with the power structure
[1:34:32.660 --> 1:34:41.660]  the blame is with Bush junior and Cheney going in there in 2003 on lies but it continues with the same warmongering system
[1:34:41.660 --> 1:34:52.660]  that they've through proxies taken on Libya trying to take down Syria and are now acting like they have no idea what's going on with ISIS
[1:34:52.660 --> 1:35:06.660]  but then you see the power structure in the US different groups endorsing different sides Obama making a deal with Iran that reportedly made Saudi Arabia mad and so Saudi Arabia has launched this rogue attack
[1:35:06.660 --> 1:35:15.660]  and I want to dissect it and then ask you where it's all really going because you just broke down what happened previously in some of the history of it
[1:35:15.660 --> 1:35:28.660]  Peter Van Buren we meant well dot com State Department 24 year veteran who blew the whistle he's got his new book ghost of Tom Jode who we will do an interview with him in the near future I promise on that book specifically
[1:35:28.660 --> 1:35:40.660]  that's some today as well but that's on another subject but continuing here Peter you've got the floor break down then more of the history where we currently are
[1:35:40.660 --> 1:35:51.660]  and who you think is really behind the ISIS invasion and where you think that's going Iraq right now is like a very very large bucket of manure
[1:35:51.660 --> 1:36:05.660]  you know every time you take a handful out all that's underneath that is more manure let's take a look back in history in 2003 the Middle East was a difficult messy but but somewhat stable situation
[1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:14.660]  Saddam for all his terrible terrible things that he did as a dictator was holding the disparate elements of Iraq together
[1:36:14.660 --> 1:36:23.660]  broadly Sunnis she has incurred but of course within each of those groups there are many subgroups and splinter groups and people with different very different opinions
[1:36:23.660 --> 1:36:36.660]  when we went in in 2003 and got rid of Saddam a regime change very similar to the regime change that the Obama administration is now starting to bleed about with Maliki getting him out of there
[1:36:36.660 --> 1:36:45.660]  when we did that regime change in 2003 there was nothing to replace it I was there for a big piece of that reconstruction working for the State Department
[1:36:45.660 --> 1:36:55.660]  in fact that's the whole theme of my first book we meant well how I helped lose the war and it was the whistleblowing in that book that got me run out of the State Department
[1:36:55.660 --> 1:37:14.660]  we failed to reestablish either a strong central government or a basis of power that Iraq and the greater Middle East could live with instead we flirted with one side or the other particularly bouncing between the Sunnis and the Shias to see which one we were going to support
[1:37:14.660 --> 1:37:32.660]  but ultimately the bulk of American support came down behind Maliki in 2006 we assisted him if not appointed him in taking over as Prime Minister we watched as the bombing of the Shia mosque in Samara triggered off the insurgency
[1:37:32.660 --> 1:37:53.660]  slash civil war that we're seeing continuing now we then continue to support Maliki despite his clear ties to Iran trading what we thought was the long term empowerment of Iran throughout the Middle East for some short-term gains and stability that would allow us to find an exit strategy in Iraq
[1:37:53.660 --> 1:38:14.660]  and if these things sound complicated they actually are and one of the reasons we're seeing the chaos in Iraq right now and we're going to see it continue there's no question about that is because these issues are complex and are not good things to solve or resolve perhaps is a better word with simple answers
[1:38:14.660 --> 1:38:29.660]  the United States tried those simple answers for nine years of occupation we spent two trillion dollars we spent forty two billion dollars training the Iraqi army which outdid the French recently in terms of throwing down their weapons and and running away
[1:38:29.660 --> 1:38:47.660]  and we sacrificed four thousand five hundred American lives if all of that was too simple an answer and it was it's very unlikely that the United States is going to be able to do anything to kind of settle this problem now
[1:38:47.660 --> 1:39:01.660]  what I'd like to do is talk about why what we're going to be doing will only make things worse but I'll stop for a moment Alex to see if if you have a different direction you wanted me to take it well no I mean I totally agree with you
[1:39:01.660 --> 1:39:17.660]  just as a layman trying to research this from the outside and reporting on it for almost 20 years on air it just seems to be a black hole that the military industrial complex keeps stirred up so there's people in the state department there's military personnel
[1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:32.660]  there's even people in the CIA who genuinely want to stabilize and have a good civilization and who want to promote peace and prosperity but at the higher levels you've got an establishment that once chaos and makes money off no bid contracts
[1:39:32.660 --> 1:39:49.660]  and it looks to me like they know that you know blowing up the golden mosque is as as Ray McGovern here said was really a false flag to get a civil war going we caught in 2006 British special forces dressed up like
[1:39:49.660 --> 1:40:09.660]  well hobbyist running around killing Shiites to get it going so at one level it is mismanagement and funding all sides but when you get down to brass tax that's what they tell people that that are moral and so to us it looks like it's just a big screw up
[1:40:09.660 --> 1:40:16.660]  I mean isn't this really at a certain level premeditated that there are those that are milking the chaos
[1:40:16.660 --> 1:40:32.660]  certainly there are those who are milking the chaos to say it's premeditated almost gives these folks more credit than they deserve if it was premeditated that at least is a plan an evil sad plan but a plan nonetheless
[1:40:32.660 --> 1:40:48.660]  my belief is certainly there are people who take advantage of chaos or who seek to get these things for their own advantage in the defense contractors and people like blackwater are way at the front of that list instead my experience both in 24 years at the State Department
[1:40:48.660 --> 1:41:05.660]  and the time I was actually physically interact negotiating with Sunnis and she is was that what America did for those nine years was chase a series of ever changing short term goals the surge is a perfect example of a short term goal
[1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:18.660]  the idea was to figure out a way to put the Sunnis out of the fight at least temporarily and what we did is we went in and we basically paid them extraordinary amounts of money to stop fighting
[1:41:18.660 --> 1:41:37.660]  at the same time we allowed them to either settle scores amongst themselves or using us special forces to pick off a few bad guys that they didn't like within their own ranks all the Sunnis she had to do really was say that guy over there is al-Qaeda and a night raid would take place and that guy would disappear
[1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:55.660]  whether he was al-Qaeda or somebody who owed the sheik money or someone who had a family debt going back 200 years was was irrelevant the thing about paying protection money as anyone who has ever watched a mafia movie knows is that as soon as you stop paying it the problem starts again
[1:41:55.660 --> 1:42:11.660]  I sat down with a Sunni sheik who had been paid off by the United States who was more than happy to tell me that one of the reasons that we pass through his checkpoints in fact I was sitting in his living room alive was because America had paid him to to assume this new role
[1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:28.660]  he was actually fairly comfortable with the idea but he warned me that the money was stopping the transition to the maliki government was also supposed to include this transition of payoffs and that wasn't happening and while he certainly was going to be a polite host
[1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:46.660]  now myself and my team to leave appeasably that day he really couldn't assure us that it would go on forever by no coincidence about three weeks later there were seven people shot in the back of the head not too far from where this guy works certainly in his area of control
[1:42:46.660 --> 1:43:03.660]  it turned out to be shia leaders that had been rounded up somewhere and brought for execution anyone anyone who says that what's happening in iraq right now is is a surprise or unpredictable or anything along those lines is a liar or a fool
[1:43:03.660 --> 1:43:21.660]  challenge readers to go to my blog we met well dot com go take a look at my blog post from 2011 predicting all of these things very accurately and then ask yourself the question of who's working at the state department now the people who made the mistakes in 2011 that brought us to today
[1:43:21.660 --> 1:43:26.660]  or the people that blew the whistle on it and got kicked out
[1:43:26.660 --> 1:43:44.660]  and the answer is it's the same people that helped create the mess correct absolutely yes look the cast of characters has not changed at all tom rick's has a column where he's got a gentleman named ollie kadiri explaining what to do next in iraq kadiri was the longest continually continuously serving
[1:43:44.660 --> 1:44:03.660]  American in the iraq war he never left currently the state department's point man on iraq who's in iraq right now is a guy named Brett McGurk who was the senior advisor to three or four American ambassadors and almost was ambassador to iraq until my blog outed him
[1:44:03.660 --> 1:44:18.660]  for some naughty sexual excopades on the roof of the embassy that were too embarrassing even for the senate foreign relations committee to overlook that said they pushed him into a non political position and he's running the show it's the same people it's
[1:44:18.660 --> 1:44:23.660]  difficult to imagine why we won't have the same results
[1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:37.660]  expanding on that how do you assess the isis folks and where do you see this going from your expert perspective and life history
[1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:50.660]  what is your gut tell you is going to happen iraq now and what do you think obama is going to in the long term because he's going to announce a bunch of special forces today obviously but do you see this escalating into iraq number three
[1:44:50.660 --> 1:45:00.660]  couple of good questions there and we'll start with isis isis is almost a little bit of a microcosm a way to look at this problem in in in one little piece
[1:45:00.660 --> 1:45:13.660]  the key issue is that in Syria as you mentioned at the top of the interview the united states strongly supports isis we arm them we give them money we train them we have our own sneaky pizza on the ground they're helping them out
[1:45:13.660 --> 1:45:25.660]  there are guys in Syria against the Assad regime over course the in iraq they're now our enemies and we're preparing to at least unleash special forces on them if not if not airstrikes
[1:45:25.660 --> 1:45:34.660]  whereas the united states sees some kind of line or a border or imagines kind of a Berlin wall with checkpoints between Syria and iraq there is none
[1:45:34.660 --> 1:45:45.660]  it's open desert anyone who wanted to wander back and forth across that area is welcome to do so and seeing these problems as national state problems here's Syria here's iraq here's Iran
[1:45:45.660 --> 1:45:55.660]  is one of the huge failures of american foreign policy they cross borders that that don't really exist as far as what's going to happen next
[1:45:55.660 --> 1:46:11.660]  I think it's going to be only a question of whether the disillusion of iraq occurs hyper violently a little bit violently or only somewhat violently it's impossible at this point to imagine any kind of realistic political reconciliation
[1:46:11.660 --> 1:46:23.660]  maliki has had almost seven eight years to pull that off it's very doubtful at this time with troops in the field that that's going to happen the winner in all this is very easy to see
[1:46:23.660 --> 1:46:33.660]  iran iran thanks to the united states had its most significant enemies the iraq ease on the west the Taliban on the east eliminated courtesy of the united states
[1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:43.660]  and iran has moved into iraq in a huge way they brokered the 2010 election that put maliki in power when the united states had to step back powerless to do that
[1:46:43.660 --> 1:47:03.660]  they have their own special forces the cods force on the ground in iraq and they own maliki maliki spent the saddam years in iran in exile and understands where his debts lie whatever he happens to be malving bad about the iranians these days for the united states to click their tongue at
[1:47:03.660 --> 1:47:12.660]  so you say that's him he really works for them totally that's all just window dressing I believe so yes I believe so he's trying to get the united states to do some of his dirty work
[1:47:12.660 --> 1:47:31.660]  you know that's a curious curious issue because I'm not saying iran is run by western groups but certainly the shaw was double crossed at certain levels in 79 they allow the iota humaini to fly in on a parish we know they did the iran contra deal with them
[1:47:31.660 --> 1:47:46.660]  and then the day jimmy carter was you know defeated then they released the hostages again I mean I'm a political democrat republican because you get you have one group of republicans leave and other group of democrats come in it's basically the same
[1:47:46.660 --> 1:48:04.660]  same you know same ideas the same systems just different different labels but what is iran's role in all this saber rattling back and forth I mean I know dick cheney would talk bad about iran all day and then separately had deals were
[1:48:04.660 --> 1:48:19.660]  halliburton when he was vice president he was making money off this is blind trust was the only company that could sell oil filled equipment to him or he tried to get according to sigh her navy seals to attack a us ship to blame iran but then he'd also be doing
[1:48:19.660 --> 1:48:31.660]  deals to protect him I mean when you get down to brass tax there doesn't seem to be any policy at all only a bunch of special interest making money off of the chaos I keep coming back to that
[1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:46.660]  absolutely I mean dick dick cheney is someone who we really should stop listening to at this point I think he's pretty much displayed his lack of credibility his lack of prescience and his other lack of intelligence on any of these issues
[1:48:46.660 --> 1:49:03.660]  the fact that he was more interested in making money for himself and his old cronies then saving American lives kind of tells tells the name of that tale iran is the winner in all this and what will happen with iran is iran will continue to bolster its position as a regional power
[1:49:03.660 --> 1:49:17.660]  Iran is going to secure its western border it may push its western border de facto further towards Baghdad I mean they're never going to fly flags or anything like that but they're going to control territory that they didn't control before
[1:49:17.660 --> 1:49:30.660]  yeah let's not forget there was an eight year war between Saddam Hussein and Iran in the 80s so they're getting politically and with covert military police force what they couldn't get in an overt war that killed millions
[1:49:30.660 --> 1:49:46.660]  absolutely courtesy of the United States and the 4500 young men and women we sacrificed there the same time she is all over the Middle East are now seeing Iran as a major player for their safety their security and as a political force
[1:49:46.660 --> 1:50:04.660]  that's something again that Iran would have had a very very hard time doing the Iranians why would Israel then tacitly support funding Sunni groups trying to take over Syria knowing that they would then pour in and take over Iraq later
[1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:13.660]  this is what happens when like the United States you pursue a policy of a long series of short term goals
[1:50:13.660 --> 1:50:26.660]  you're saying it's one dimensional they don't think a few plays down they only think I don't like Assad take him out they don't think we're going to put a giant Saudi Arabian system in control of this country that's clearly going to end up trying to come in and take over
[1:50:26.660 --> 1:50:38.660]  absolutely absolutely this is this is it if the chessboard analogy I offered has any validity it's if it's three dimensional chess if not four dimensional chess or something even more complex
[1:50:38.660 --> 1:50:53.660]  once you kind of take a deep breath and start in on this it's it's hard to get it all out in one up exhale you've got three different groups in Iraq that are supported by a half a dozen countries outside of Iraq each of those entities has splintered groups and

[1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:32.660]  does the establishment think they've got a plan and that they're in control
[1:54:32.660 --> 1:54:43.660]  because you know clearly the Middle East is deteriorating I know Google knew that the Arab Spring was coming and basically tried to ride
[1:54:43.660 --> 1:54:56.660]  what they already knew was coming because food prices went up like they're now going up here so again I'm not saying the establishment orchestrated the Arab Spring but they now admittedly predicted it and tried to steer it
[1:54:56.660 --> 1:55:09.660]  but it just doesn't ever seem to work or the State Department supporting right wing Nazis in Ukraine who literally how Hitler tried to start a new war with Russia again in my view it's not that Russia is some angel it's just that
[1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:21.660]  America is so bad now is it ineptness or what what's happening in the minds of the people running things I mean do they think they're doing a good job
[1:55:21.660 --> 1:55:34.660]  my own experience is whenever you're not sure go with inept it's the Occam's razor thing the simplest answer is often the correct one and my experience has been ineptness has ruled the day
[1:55:34.660 --> 1:55:46.660]  let's throw some predictions out there about Iraq because as the President has told us we need to look forward not backward and a lot of the commentary I'm reading Dick Cheney and others is looking backward
[1:55:46.660 --> 1:55:56.660]  let's find someone to blame whether it's Obama if you're from that part of the spectrum or it's pushed from another those things happen for sure and history will sort those out but let's look forward
[1:55:56.660 --> 1:56:11.660]  I think the situation in Iraq is very similar to the end of apartheid in South Africa everybody knows it's going to fall apart everyone knows it's an unsustainable system the question is how will it fall apart and particularly how violently will fall apart
[1:56:11.660 --> 1:56:23.660]  I think in Iraq there's no question that you're going to have three separate entities I hate to use the word state because it implies a government who makes postage stamps and picks up the trash and things like that
[1:56:23.660 --> 1:56:36.660]  it'll be like warlord runs sectors sectors let's say sectors that's a good that's an excellent word for this you're going to have the Kurds by the way who rarely come up in these discussions have been keeping on keeping on for a very long time
[1:56:36.660 --> 1:56:53.660]  they carved out their own de facto state early on in in this game in 2003 and sit quietly back watching the rest of it happen behind their own walls with their own military so other than a little score settling and some adjusting of borders will leave the Kurds aside for a second
[1:56:53.660 --> 1:57:09.660]  the she is I think will will hold Baghdad and they'll hold the areas south of Baghdad those are traditional areas I doubt that a Sunni military army mob tribal organization or whatever really has as the the muscle so they'll get the west
[1:57:09.660 --> 1:57:25.660]  the Sunnis will continue to hold the west and bar in western Iraq have been under de facto Sunni control for some time what we're going to be fussing over is in the middle and I suspect that the worst outcome will be continued violence and that certainly will be the
[1:57:25.660 --> 1:57:41.660]  what sending more us fight into the thing will do is just what is Saudi Arabia think it's getting by doing this at least Iran doesn't get the whole country now it's it puts themselves in a position to push back against Iran whenever they want to do that
[1:57:41.660 --> 1:57:59.660]  it puts themselves into a much weakened Iraq as a national state don't forget Iraq basically invaded Kuwait and a good chunk of northern Saudi Arabia though we don't like to talk about that too much the Saudis have a state now that will not threaten them as a state acting
[1:57:59.660 --> 1:58:13.660]  sure I'm not defending Maliki and closing but you know he basically saying what you just said he said all these interest want to break the country up I don't want that I guess from his own self serving interest of prime minister wanting to be in control or is that
[1:58:13.660 --> 1:58:27.660]  absolutely he doesn't want to run off to South America with as much gold bullion as he carries and spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder but that indeed is going to be what you're saying Iraq used to be in three parts it needs to be in three parts
[1:58:27.660 --> 1:58:37.660]  needs to or will be our two different words but it certainly will end up that way all right thank you so much Peter Van Buren we meant well dot com thank you for joining us

[2:00:29.660 --> 2:00:35.660]  I want to attempt a smattering of important news stories I want to cover that I've gotten to
[2:00:35.660 --> 2:00:49.660]  like Nielsen ratings in a new scandal with fixed ratings that's like a fish swimming in the ocean I'm so shocked right now that the rating system is fixed they have to
[2:00:49.660 --> 2:00:59.660]  they're basically have almost no viewers except for passive ones that come across it occasionally so they have to do this
[2:00:59.660 --> 2:01:09.660]  in Arbatron it came out the Spanish radio stations you wonder why so much stuff went Spanish last 15 years that was all rigged that came out years ago
[2:01:09.660 --> 2:01:17.660]  because the establishment wanted that and now they've been caught with Univision rigging everything
[2:01:17.660 --> 2:01:29.660]  that's in the LA Times you heard all the news I've thrown out the last two hours many of you've been listening or have you just joined us top story on Drudge
[2:01:29.660 --> 2:01:43.660]  Sheriff Joe Arpaio Obama's dumping of illegals is intentional again that's like saying that the sky's blue but it's important to restate the simple see a lot of us that know how this works we think everybody else knows
[2:01:43.660 --> 2:01:51.660]  nobody else does not know we need to keep restating the simple the basics and then adding the detail to it
[2:01:51.660 --> 2:02:03.660]  Boehner is running around and saying the administration's own making of this disaster well yeah they don't care if Obama gets blamed he'll get pardoned he's leaving office
[2:02:03.660 --> 2:02:16.660]  this is about future democratic voters shock photo tin foil blankets as hundreds of illegals arrive an hour scabies chicken pox cholera drug resistant TB
[2:02:16.660 --> 2:02:30.660]  I'm telling you we need to headline drug resistant TB that's what the ice whistleblower told us and that's in our video Perry no room left for homeless Texans
[2:02:30.660 --> 2:02:40.660]  yeah I drive by Home Depot all the time and I used to see 15 illegals out front I can send my crew in the morning to any Home Depot in Austin but the one off 35 and 290
[2:02:40.660 --> 2:02:47.660]  and I mean there's like a hundred illegal standing out there and that's at any one time because they they can't even get jobs now
[2:02:47.660 --> 2:02:57.660]  I mean a Mexico's collapse worse than us we're in a depression food prices are set to double how long did I tell you we're going into inflation
[2:02:57.660 --> 2:03:09.660]  when they did QE unlimited ladies and gentlemen they printed tens of trillions digitally for the megabanks of dollars they didn't print but a few hundred billion for the general public doesn't matter
[2:03:09.660 --> 2:03:19.660]  the elites had a plan of control inflation to only give it to themselves so luxury items doubled and tripled a BMW that was 60 grand five years ago was a hundred and twenty grand now
[2:03:19.660 --> 2:03:33.660]  a Porsche that was 60 grand is 160 grand Rolexes that were three thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars that's all happened real estate for the elites gone up
[2:03:33.660 --> 2:03:45.660]  but only the elite the rest of the country the poor the working class the middle class have been eaten to the bone in this entire process and it's only getting worse
[2:03:45.660 --> 2:03:53.660]  and it only will cause more crime and societal breakdown and and what's the answer oh don't try to fix Latin America don't try to build it up
[2:03:53.660 --> 2:04:02.660]  no no no they ever try to get any good leaders overthrown put in leftist or they get a good leftist leader overthrow them put in bad right wing people
[2:04:02.660 --> 2:04:09.660]  because there's a good right wing guy that's moral but didn't run by the West they overthrow them if there's a leftist who's good they throw them out
[2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:20.660]  and put in a bad one I mean it just that's what Carol Quigley Bill Clinton's mentor had a Georgetown political science wrote and his eleven hundred page book Tragedy and Hope that's back in print
[2:04:20.660 --> 2:04:28.660]  that we sell at info wars store.com you should go read it but even if you don't it's good to have as a collector's item to show people the quotes in it
[2:04:28.660 --> 2:04:36.660]  you can find the quotes online and find the page number and go find them in there or they admit the whole plan how do I know how stuff works
[2:04:36.660 --> 2:04:46.660]  because only a thousand of those were printed for high-level CIA and State Department officials in the mid-1960s then the plates got out and thousands more got printed
[2:04:46.660 --> 2:04:57.660]  they were unable to pull them back and folks just print them as part of public interest and I've read it and it was meant so the State Department can understand the four-dimensional chess
[2:04:57.660 --> 2:05:07.660]  man when I get home from work all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep I can take her on romantic dates I get her flowers you name it

[2:08:09.660 --> 2:08:22.660]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[2:08:22.660 --> 2:08:43.660]  so two men have been arrested north of Austin and round rock we're trying to get money weapons allegedly to Syrian rebels fighting Bashir al-Assad that's what the indictment says one of them was arrested round rock the other in Houston trying to get on an airplane
[2:08:43.660 --> 2:09:05.660]  I guess to go over there and fight our government's been funding these groups to attack Assad giving them stinger missiles and then they arrest the al-qaeda affiliated nutballs which they should be arresting the al-qaeda affiliated nutballs for trying to do this if it's true which I'm probably is
[2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:21.660]  instead of trying to grab my genitals at the airport or check baby diapers and I had two former air marshals on yesterday senior air marshals who are causing the big firestorm nationwide talking about what's going on gun running
[2:09:21.660 --> 2:09:40.660]  just total corruption putting people on no fly list for no reason just a federal government out of control remember all the Justice Department people and Homeland Security people that had to resign last year they settled the lawsuits which means they didn't want to fight them
[2:09:40.660 --> 2:10:01.660]  that women would dress up basically in dominatrix outfits and make the men grovel to them and would make them office out of the bathrooms senior Homeland Security people we're talking about deputy heads and people because in my experience folks
[2:10:01.660 --> 2:10:16.660]  studying history how things work most of these short haired you know commando woman lesbian types really aren't even lesbians I would and I'm not knocking women out there I don't I'm not attacking you for sexual issues
[2:10:16.660 --> 2:10:37.660]  I'm talking about the type like Janet Reno or big sis it's about out manning men and then when they get in power positions they want a to have sex with the men and be to dominate them and that's what was alleged and that's what they settled over
[2:10:37.660 --> 2:10:52.660]  and you got all these other Homeland Security people caught trying to fly and meet people that have babies they can rape that comes out every month or so and senators are constantly getting caught with underage boys and not getting in trouble I mean it's just crazy land folks
[2:10:52.660 --> 2:11:07.660]  and then you got Mexico where they're finding new mass graves they found new mass graves today over the Texas border with dead men women and children where the Mexican cartels are robbing and killing and raping the poor people trying to get up here
[2:11:07.660 --> 2:11:26.660]  it's just lawlessness and then if I'm against total collapse your libertarians go Alex you say you're libertarian you should be for no borders Mexico is at failed collapse state the government's offering them free welfare how is that free market to bring them here
[2:11:26.660 --> 2:11:39.660]  they're above the law and then because the law still there and they still get the welfare we're not in some libertarian state where you don't get any free handouts then no one would want to come here but people that wanted opportunity
[2:11:39.660 --> 2:11:49.660]  Switzerland doesn't just take you if you have money I mean if you've got like a hundred million dollars will take you but if you've only got a few million dollars believe me I've looked into it
[2:11:49.660 --> 2:12:06.660]  and you want to move to Switzerland you better have skills if you're an inventor if you're a scientist if you're a Nobel laureate if you're a Pulitzer prize winner if you're a journalist if you are someone who's got something to offer
[2:12:06.660 --> 2:12:25.660]  then you can come to Switzerland even if you don't have a lot of money and it is a wonderland of low crime and culture and quality look at the United States under collectivism it is rotting to the core
[2:12:25.660 --> 2:12:40.660]  see I don't like rigged games people say why are you criticizing Walmart their free market really I've read probably five books on Walmart no people that have worked their mid level and high level have researched their business practices and who they give money to
[2:12:40.660 --> 2:12:55.660]  and what they do their families got more than two hundred billion dollars they've gotten the tax laws written where they pay almost no tax but then they give money to candidates that are promoting banker bailouts to take my money and give it to big banks they're invested in
[2:12:55.660 --> 2:13:17.660]  Walmart would do things the last 20 years now when Walton ran it wasn't like this when the old guy ran it wasn't like this and had a lot of made America stuff and I was a kid and I've gone back and researched it they had a lot of made America and it had stuff people wanted and Walmart became popular in the south and in Texas and in places like you know Arkansas where it came from
[2:13:17.660 --> 2:13:30.660]  because it was a different animal but the last 20 plus years Walmart here's just an example of crony capitalism will come in and will tell 10 egg producers in a county around the Walmart take out loans do all this
[2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:50.660]  to give us you know 10,000 eggs a week and will sign your contract with you but they just told 10 groups to do it well let's say eight of the producers upgrade now there's a glut of eggs so what happens they come to you and they say
[2:13:50.660 --> 2:14:08.660]  okay we will now basically pay you at cost what it is and they tricky to sign a new contract then they come back and they go sorry you got a contract to deliver eggs even though so many other places opened up now you're losing money
[2:14:08.660 --> 2:14:23.660]  and they don't care because then a bunch of them go out of business but now all their competition is already out of business because the eggs were one third the cost at Walmart that they were at any other competitor
[2:14:23.660 --> 2:14:38.660]  that's called a monopolistic practice John D Rockefeller competition is a sin and Walmart has done that on every front till they're the only producer and then soon they say we're not going to sell ammo and guns anymore
[2:14:38.660 --> 2:14:48.660]  there was such a backlash and you boycotted them so they said okay we'll sell guns again but the minute they can shut everybody down they're not going to sell guns anymore
[2:14:48.660 --> 2:14:56.660]  so that's my issue with Walmart
[2:14:56.660 --> 2:15:06.660]  now again I kind of want to jag here just on random subjects that pop in my mind I'm going to give the number down go to your calls for the balance of the hour and interspersed a bunch of news
[2:15:06.660 --> 2:15:24.660]  and play a David Knight report here in a moment but just like Walmart set up slave factories in China to get stuff produced five six seven eight times cheaper than anybody else could it didn't promote any Chinese good jobs or money
[2:15:24.660 --> 2:15:41.660]  it didn't build a civilization to trade with it deindustrialized America it got rid of all the good jobs created service jobs but now even service jobs are contracting the name of the game is control and Walmart strategically did this with the globalist and that's come out on record as well
[2:15:41.660 --> 2:15:55.660]  so same thing with Mexico it's not free market to buy from Walmart because it's rigged and you destroy yourself in the process and other big retailers play the same game Costco and others
[2:15:55.660 --> 2:16:03.660]  and then Costco gives money to anti-gun groups and again there's groups even worse than Walmart folks
[2:16:03.660 --> 2:16:17.660]  there's markets involved in a bunch of this stuff it's all about manipulating markets but then finally Walmart's profits plunging because now they're into the end game and they've so screwed up the country and deindustrialized it shut down their competition
[2:16:17.660 --> 2:16:33.660]  that now they don't even have people that have money to come buy at Walmart so Walmart starts lobbying to get the illegals legalized so they can all get welfare checks and come spend the welfare checks at Walmart but now it's with devalued dollars so the meat prices double over the last three years
[2:16:33.660 --> 2:16:50.660]  see how it doesn't work corruption only works so long Mexico is a lawless state almost every area of the country it's a failed collapse country
[2:16:50.660 --> 2:17:05.660]  and then we're told hey be compassionate help these women and children that are coming here unlimited numbers that will pay for while old people that I know lose their houses because they can't pay the property taxes
[2:17:05.660 --> 2:17:13.660]  or if you don't pay the so-called income tax no judge no jury they come and pull the wedding ring off your fingers wife
[2:17:13.660 --> 2:17:29.660]  where's the compassion there for the people you know the IRS admits they target blue collar mainly now because see once you force the blue collar to stop working it's game over full collapse you go why would the system want that because then they get full control
[2:17:29.660 --> 2:17:48.660]  and it's not like we're just surmising this they put it down in documents like cloward and pevin agenda 21 and others so that's the reality here and that's why you're not going to help the immigrants coming from their collapse societies God bless them
[2:17:48.660 --> 2:18:04.660]  by just bringing unlimited numbers here because there's no free market left for them to come to the country's already shot the question is how dead are we going to be and can we ever rise from the ashes and the globalist want to make sure we can't do that
[2:18:04.660 --> 2:18:21.660]  and so they're flooding the nation with the most unskilled dumbed down hopeless people who believe that Obama and the Democratic Party are their God for giving them a free bus ticket and welfare and three hots in a cut
[2:18:21.660 --> 2:18:36.660]  and it's the analogy of the lifeboat if a lifeboat can carry 20 people and the waters already up to the edge of the gunnels and you're about to swamp the whole boat in the north Atlantic and everybody's going to have a thermion five minutes
[2:18:36.660 --> 2:18:52.660]  if there are a bunch of kids floating up to you there's been famous cases of this in the old days men were so jealous that men would get off and jump into the water so that sharks could eat them or so they could freeze the death and children would be put into the lifeboats
[2:18:52.660 --> 2:19:14.660]  so folks need to understand that that America's already starting to take on water and sink and if we were taking on inventors and entrepreneurs and free market people it would actually help us if it was a limited core groups of highly skilled people
[2:19:14.660 --> 2:19:28.660]  I mean when we got immigrants from all over the world the last 200 years folks they were paying to come here and paying to be indentured servants and paying to go from one tyranny to a lesser tyranny and they were ready to work
[2:19:28.660 --> 2:19:45.660]  they were ready to open the best clothiers the best shoe shops the best eateries the best all that great culture came to America because these were people who had been in caste systems like Germany and Italy and you name it and Russia who wanted to have freedom
[2:19:45.660 --> 2:19:59.660]  and there was no free deal when they got here so they built an amazing country it's the opposite now it's the opposite it's failed kleptocratic countries people getting here for a free handout I'll give the number out when we come back

[2:24:44.660 --> 2:24:47.660]  Look at this headline up on infowars.com
[2:24:47.660 --> 2:24:50.660]  By the way, it's on Houston television
[2:24:50.660 --> 2:24:54.660]  Now it's talking for so long
[2:24:54.660 --> 2:24:57.660]  This is not breaking an infowars.com and they'll get an article on it
[2:24:57.660 --> 2:25:02.660]  It's not broken nationally. I bet drugs links to the Houston story
[2:25:02.660 --> 2:25:07.660]  Texan told to remove American flag because it's a threat to Muslims
[2:25:07.660 --> 2:25:14.660]  Apartment management suggests removing flag will help provide for safety of all residents
[2:25:14.660 --> 2:25:23.660]  And the apartment manager actually talked to KHOU television and admitted it
[2:25:23.660 --> 2:25:27.660]  And said, yeah, the American flag, it's like a gang sign
[2:25:27.660 --> 2:25:31.660]  I told you, see, this is political correctness, folks
[2:25:31.660 --> 2:25:35.660]  Every group can keep their identity, but if you're white, or if it's the American flag
[2:25:35.660 --> 2:25:40.660]  Or if you're a conservative, or if you're a gun owner, or if you're anti-abortion, you're a terrorist
[2:25:40.660 --> 2:25:44.660]  Oh, it's already linked up there from KHOU
[2:25:44.660 --> 2:25:50.660]  Look at that, see, I just could guess because that's so newsworthy
[2:25:50.660 --> 2:25:54.660]  We have our own article up at infowars.com. Good job, Kit
[2:25:54.660 --> 2:25:58.660]  And I think Kit's gonna add some links to the article too to past examples and cases
[2:25:58.660 --> 2:26:02.660]  You can't wear American flag anywhere now. In public school, they say
[2:26:02.660 --> 2:26:06.660]  Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches can't be on menus because it's hurtful to Hispanics

[2:26:10.660 --> 2:26:14.660]  As if what type of food you eat is just some type of issue

[2:26:20.660 --> 2:26:24.660]  To Mexican food, Chinese food, and of course the system knows that
[2:26:24.660 --> 2:26:28.660]  They just want you to talk to just say nothing, oh, oh, help me
[2:26:28.660 --> 2:26:32.660]  It's authoritarianism

[2:26:47.660 --> 2:26:51.660]  Confirmed? We broke this yesterday. We broke it yesterday
[2:26:51.660 --> 2:26:55.660]  With the McAllen emergency manager saying the feds pay to ship the illegals
[2:26:55.660 --> 2:26:59.660]  Into the interior of the country, bring them in illegals
[2:26:59.660 --> 2:27:03.660]  And send them to their family members who are illegals. Well, now we found a federal
[2:27:03.660 --> 2:27:07.660]  Government press release for bids for people to help
[2:27:07.660 --> 2:27:12.660]  Ship the kids into the country and that story is up on infowars.com
[2:27:12.660 --> 2:27:16.660]  And prismplanet.com and it's red linked
[2:27:16.660 --> 2:27:20.660]  On Drudge as well
[2:27:20.660 --> 2:27:24.660]  The story is up there on the site and it makes my head spin
[2:27:24.660 --> 2:27:28.660]  DHS to pay for illegal immigrants to be
[2:27:28.660 --> 2:27:32.660]  Escorted into the US

[2:27:36.660 --> 2:27:40.660]  To taxpayers' expense. Brought in. They pull it in buses, we have the whole
[2:27:40.660 --> 2:27:44.660]  Chain of investigation. Greyhound pulls in, board patrol
[2:27:44.660 --> 2:27:48.660]  Waves them in. They drive up church buses, government funded
[2:27:48.660 --> 2:27:52.660]  501c3. They're not even churches, they're government state run systems
[2:27:52.660 --> 2:27:56.660]  Load them up, they're brought in, they're fed, they're watered, they're then sent
[2:27:56.660 --> 2:28:00.660]  On to the interior. They're signed up with voter registration cards
[2:28:00.660 --> 2:28:04.660]  And welfare checks. And then now they're advertising
[2:28:04.660 --> 2:28:08.660]  The full flood
[2:28:08.660 --> 2:28:12.660]  Absolutely insane to see this type of thing going on

[2:30:06.660 --> 2:30:08.660]  But it's not just the air outside that's toxic
[2:30:08.660 --> 2:30:12.660]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[2:30:12.660 --> 2:30:16.660]  Of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[2:30:16.660 --> 2:30:18.660]  Inside using toxic chemicals within their homes
[2:30:18.660 --> 2:30:22.660]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States
[2:30:22.660 --> 2:30:26.660]  Well over a thousand types of mold and mildew linked to numerous conditions
[2:30:26.660 --> 2:30:30.660]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well
[2:30:30.660 --> 2:30:34.660]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me
[2:30:34.660 --> 2:30:38.660]  It was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment
[2:30:38.660 --> 2:30:41.660]  That we cannot escape but that we can fight back against
[2:30:41.660 --> 2:30:45.660]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA
[2:30:45.660 --> 2:30:48.660]  The new Info Wars Life Lung Cleanse is here
[2:30:48.660 --> 2:30:52.660]  In a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment
[2:30:52.660 --> 2:30:59.660]  Available exclusively at infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-2533-139
[2:30:59.660 --> 2:31:05.660]  General, what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday about a potential fourth hood situation?
[2:31:05.660 --> 2:31:08.660]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex, shoving the crowd
[2:31:08.660 --> 2:31:10.660]  Here we go, folks, I'm being assigned to...
[2:31:10.660 --> 2:31:14.660]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the nightly news
[2:31:14.660 --> 2:31:16.660]  Info Wars is the tip of the spear
[2:31:16.660 --> 2:31:21.660]  Is this another false flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote Homeland Security?
[2:31:21.660 --> 2:31:23.660]  I'm sticking my hands down on the pants on the streets
[2:31:23.660 --> 2:31:27.660]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[2:31:27.660 --> 2:31:30.660]  And that's what prisonplanet.tv is designed to do
[2:31:30.660 --> 2:31:38.660]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels
[2:31:38.660 --> 2:31:42.660]  What we see now is a war against reality, it's a war against the truth
[2:31:42.660 --> 2:31:47.660]  It's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv
[2:31:47.660 --> 2:31:51.660]  And share their membership with up to 11 friends and family

[2:31:58.660 --> 2:32:01.660]  I've always believed in nutrition and herbs
[2:32:01.660 --> 2:32:07.660]  Supermale vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes
[2:32:07.660 --> 2:32:12.660]  Instead of using synthetic chemicals sourced from powerful organic herbs
[2:32:12.660 --> 2:32:16.660]  Harvested around the planet and then concentrated for maximum potency
[2:32:16.660 --> 2:32:21.660]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff
[2:32:21.660 --> 2:32:24.660]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others
[2:32:24.660 --> 2:32:31.660]  We have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula
[2:32:31.660 --> 2:32:38.660]  Super male vitality by info wars life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose
[2:32:38.660 --> 2:32:40.660]  I jump out of the bed ready to fight these criminals every day
[2:32:40.660 --> 2:32:44.660]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started
[2:32:44.660 --> 2:32:46.660]  It's not just the super male vitality
[2:32:46.660 --> 2:32:50.660]  All the products in infowarslife.com are simply amazing

[2:33:03.660 --> 2:33:07.660]  There have been times my friends that I've looked in the mirror
[2:33:07.660 --> 2:33:10.660]  All these lines in my face getting cruel
[2:33:10.660 --> 2:33:12.660]  The past is gone
[2:33:12.660 --> 2:33:14.660]  You are receiving this transmission
[2:33:14.660 --> 2:33:16.660]  You are the resistance
[2:33:16.660 --> 2:33:20.660]  Live from the infowars.com studios
[2:33:20.660 --> 2:33:22.660]  It's Alex Jones
[2:33:22.660 --> 2:33:24.660]  I like this rendition
[2:33:24.660 --> 2:33:30.660]  Every time that I look in the mirror
[2:33:30.660 --> 2:33:37.660]  All these lines in my face getting clearer
[2:33:37.660 --> 2:33:40.660]  The past is gone
[2:33:40.660 --> 2:33:45.660]  All these lines in my face getting clearer
[2:33:45.660 --> 2:33:49.660]  I like watching my children grow up and know they'll have children
[2:33:49.660 --> 2:33:51.660]  Because for sure you live forever
[2:33:51.660 --> 2:33:54.660]  As long as the human species goes on
[2:33:54.660 --> 2:33:58.660]  You win by surviving and being honorable
[2:33:58.660 --> 2:34:00.660]  Well, I know
[2:34:00.660 --> 2:34:02.660]  I know
[2:34:02.660 --> 2:34:04.660]  Nobody knows
[2:34:04.660 --> 2:34:07.660]  Where it comes and where it goes
[2:34:07.660 --> 2:34:10.660]  I don't know if everybody's tuned
[2:34:10.660 --> 2:34:15.660]  You've got to lose to know how to win
[2:34:15.660 --> 2:34:18.660]  Monday through Friday we're here 11am to 2pm central
[2:34:18.660 --> 2:34:20.660]  Back I'll be live this Sunday
[2:34:20.660 --> 2:34:23.660]  4-6pm live in studio
[2:34:26.660 --> 2:34:28.660]  Alright, I want to go to your phone calls
[2:34:28.660 --> 2:34:32.660]  But Obama's speech has concluded his long press conference
[2:34:32.660 --> 2:34:37.660]  And usually he puts our military under NATO command
[2:34:37.660 --> 2:34:39.660]  And doesn't consult Congress
[2:34:39.660 --> 2:34:41.660]  But I guess he's felt so much heat
[2:34:41.660 --> 2:34:44.660]  And Congressman Walter Jones has a bill
[2:34:44.660 --> 2:34:46.660]  That if he does one more military operation
[2:34:46.660 --> 2:34:50.660]  Without congressional approval impeachment will basically start
[2:34:50.660 --> 2:34:53.660]  And the Daily Mail's reporting that they've got the votes in the House
[2:34:53.660 --> 2:34:58.660]  To impeach Obama for violating the Constitution
[2:34:58.660 --> 2:35:02.660]  Again, this is an illegitimate government with now a 7% approval rating
[2:35:02.660 --> 2:35:04.660]  Gallup post-shows
[2:35:04.660 --> 2:35:07.660]  Just 4% have a great deal of confidence
[2:35:07.660 --> 2:35:11.660]  Only 3% say they have quite a lot of confidence in the federal government
[2:35:11.660 --> 2:35:14.660]  That's a
[2:35:14.660 --> 2:35:17.660]  Infowars.com article that Steve Watson did
[2:35:17.660 --> 2:35:19.660]  But it links to Gallup
[2:35:19.660 --> 2:35:22.660]  So before we go to your phone calls just briefly
[2:35:22.660 --> 2:35:25.660]  Here's Obama saying something sensible until you realize
[2:35:25.660 --> 2:35:28.660]  They triggered an army on Qaeda forces
[2:35:28.660 --> 2:35:30.660]  I've really been mulling this over for a long time
[2:35:30.660 --> 2:35:34.660]  To figure out the strategy and also reading the establishment's white papers
[2:35:34.660 --> 2:35:39.660]  It clicked earlier that I know what they're doing
[2:35:43.660 --> 2:35:46.660]  They have made a deal with Iran and Saudi Arabia
[2:35:46.660 --> 2:35:49.660]  And others to split the country in three parts
[2:35:49.660 --> 2:35:51.660]  As I know they proposed earlier
[2:35:51.660 --> 2:35:54.660]  And to leave the central area
[2:35:54.660 --> 2:35:57.660]  Controlled by contractors and the west
[2:35:57.660 --> 2:36:01.660]  In Baghdad to manage it
[2:36:01.660 --> 2:36:03.660]  So it's the globalist model
[2:36:03.660 --> 2:36:05.660]  They come into a country, break it up into sectors
[2:36:05.660 --> 2:36:07.660]  And have a command base in the middle
[2:36:07.660 --> 2:36:10.660]  Like an alien mothership that's landed
[2:36:10.660 --> 2:36:13.660]  To run the planet or the country
[2:36:13.660 --> 2:36:16.660]  And then it runs the torture bases and other central hubs
[2:36:16.660 --> 2:36:18.660]  In that command district
[2:36:18.660 --> 2:36:22.660]  Just like DC is the equivalent of an alien fortress
[2:36:22.660 --> 2:36:25.660]  Or the city of London within London-ish
[2:36:25.660 --> 2:36:28.660]  All these elites always create a city that is above the law
[2:36:28.660 --> 2:36:33.660]  Within the Vatican's got the same thing
[2:36:33.660 --> 2:36:35.660]  That's what's going on here
[2:36:35.660 --> 2:36:38.660]  And Iraq is a model for the rest of the world
[2:36:38.660 --> 2:36:42.660]  They get rid of nation states into larger sectors
[2:36:42.660 --> 2:36:45.660]  But then break those larger sectors into sub-sectors
[2:36:45.660 --> 2:36:49.660]  Balkanization in the name of unity
[2:36:49.660 --> 2:36:52.660]  With no human representation, only elite control
[2:36:52.660 --> 2:36:55.660]  The only political system will be the in-fighting
[2:36:55.660 --> 2:36:57.660]  Of the proletariat against each other
[2:36:57.660 --> 2:37:00.660]  Or the great game of divide and conquer
[2:37:00.660 --> 2:37:02.660]  Alright, enough of that
[2:37:02.660 --> 2:37:04.660]  Let's go to Lord Obama
[2:37:04.660 --> 2:37:07.660]  Sounding very reasonable until you look deeper
[2:37:07.660 --> 2:37:09.660]  Into the Sith Lord's operation
[2:37:09.660 --> 2:37:12.660]  Because of our increased intelligence resources
[2:37:12.660 --> 2:37:15.660]  We're developing more information about potential targets
[2:37:15.660 --> 2:37:17.660]  Associated with ISIL
[2:37:17.660 --> 2:37:19.660]  And going forward, we will be prepared to take
[2:37:19.660 --> 2:37:22.660]  Targeted and precise military action
[2:37:22.660 --> 2:37:25.660]  If and when we determine that the situation on the ground
[2:37:25.660 --> 2:37:27.660]  Requires it
[2:37:27.660 --> 2:37:30.660]  If we do, I will consult closely with Congress
[2:37:30.660 --> 2:37:32.660]  And leaders in Iraq and in the region
[2:37:32.660 --> 2:37:35.660]  I want to emphasize, though, that the best and most effective
[2:37:35.660 --> 2:37:38.660]  Response to a threat like ISIL
[2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:42.660]  Will ultimately involve partnerships where local forces
[2:37:42.660 --> 2:37:44.660]  Like Iraqis take the lead
[2:37:44.660 --> 2:37:47.660]  Now it's not the place for the United States to choose
[2:37:47.660 --> 2:37:48.660]  Iraq's leaders
[2:37:48.660 --> 2:37:51.660]  It is clear, though, that only leaders that can govern
[2:37:51.660 --> 2:37:54.660]  With an inclusive agenda are going to be able to
[2:37:54.660 --> 2:37:56.660]  Truly bring the Iraqi people together
[2:37:56.660 --> 2:37:58.660]  And help them through this crisis
[2:37:58.660 --> 2:38:01.660]  Meanwhile, the United States will not pursue military options
[2:38:01.660 --> 2:38:05.660]  To support one sect inside of Iraq at the expense of another
[2:38:05.660 --> 2:38:08.660]  By the way, when he got sworn in both times
[2:38:08.660 --> 2:38:12.660]  He messed up on the parts about God and other things
[2:38:12.660 --> 2:38:17.660]  So he's a lawyer, they do that on purpose
[2:38:17.660 --> 2:38:21.660]  Where he's saying ISIL when it's ISIL
[2:38:21.660 --> 2:38:23.660]  I mean, it's all just lawyer games, folks
[2:38:23.660 --> 2:38:25.660]  It's all pure bull
[2:38:25.660 --> 2:38:30.660]  It's all about confusion, it's about frying your brain
[2:38:30.660 --> 2:38:32.660]  It's about full spectrum dominance
[2:38:32.660 --> 2:38:35.660]  Ozzy in the great state of Georgia
[2:38:35.660 --> 2:38:38.660]  You are on the air, thanks for calling in today
[2:38:38.660 --> 2:38:42.660]  How are you, Alex? I'm calling in from FEMA Region 4
[2:38:42.660 --> 2:38:45.660]  That's right, formerly Georgia, welcome
[2:38:45.660 --> 2:38:50.660]  I want to let your viewers know that they are the resistance
[2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:53.660]  I'm pretty shook enough
[2:38:53.660 --> 2:38:58.660]  I've witnessed mobilization of U.N. armored trucks
[2:38:58.660 --> 2:39:02.660]  Here from Alabama to Georgia
[2:39:02.660 --> 2:39:04.660]  That's what I wanted to speak on, first of all
[2:39:04.660 --> 2:39:06.660]  And I also want to speak on the illegal immigrants
[2:39:06.660 --> 2:39:08.660]  That are here to replace us
[2:39:08.660 --> 2:39:12.660]  They're also here to suck off of our economy
[2:39:12.660 --> 2:39:15.660]  They're here to bankrupt things from collapsed
[2:39:15.660 --> 2:39:18.660]  Latin American countries that the globalists helped collapse
[2:39:18.660 --> 2:39:20.660]  I feel sorry for them, a lot of them will work hard
[2:39:20.660 --> 2:39:23.660]  But the system wants totally destitute teenagers
[2:39:23.660 --> 2:39:27.660]  That they can force into their system and program
[2:39:27.660 --> 2:39:30.660]  The system bemoans that a lot of illegals won't go on welfare
[2:39:30.660 --> 2:39:34.660]  They advertise every day locally for illegals to go get welfare
[2:39:34.660 --> 2:39:36.660]  But the illegals don't trust the system
[2:39:36.660 --> 2:39:39.660]  But that's why they want the destitute and are advertising
[2:39:39.660 --> 2:39:41.660]  Come here for a free deal
[2:39:41.660 --> 2:39:45.660]  Now tell me about, you saw armored U.N. vehicles
[2:39:45.660 --> 2:39:47.660]  Tell me exactly what you saw
[2:39:47.660 --> 2:39:51.660]  Okay, well first what I saw was a few months ago
[2:39:51.660 --> 2:39:53.660]  And it actually surprised me
[2:39:53.660 --> 2:39:56.660]  It wasn't the U.N. vehicles, it was tanks
[2:39:56.660 --> 2:40:00.660]  And they were on a train and they were being transported here to Georgia
[2:40:00.660 --> 2:40:07.660]  Well now what I'm seeing is that U.N. vehicles, white armored trucks
[2:40:07.660 --> 2:40:09.660]  There's videos of this and everything
[2:40:09.660 --> 2:40:11.660]  Are being transported here to Georgia
[2:40:11.660 --> 2:40:17.660]  And what I believe is going on is that the military, the police
[2:40:17.660 --> 2:40:21.660]  They don't want a single part to do with this
[2:40:21.660 --> 2:40:23.660]  They don't want disarmed American people
[2:40:23.660 --> 2:40:26.660]  So I think they will bring in the U.N. to do it
[2:40:26.660 --> 2:40:31.660]  Well, I used to hear militia people and folks like 19 years ago
[2:40:31.660 --> 2:40:33.660]  Like Mark Kornke, who I respect and like
[2:40:33.660 --> 2:40:37.660]  But he would say things like, you know, they're going to use U.N. troops and I4 troops
[2:40:37.660 --> 2:40:41.660]  And I just thought Americans would fight them
[2:40:41.660 --> 2:40:44.660]  And I just thought, you know, he's going too far
[2:40:44.660 --> 2:40:47.660]  And then now, since NLE09 and stuff
[2:40:47.660 --> 2:40:50.660]  Well even before that, FEMA admitted in public documents
[2:40:50.660 --> 2:40:53.660]  They were training with troops from 14 nations
[2:40:53.660 --> 2:40:57.660]  Including ours, it was 15, to quote, fight domestic terrorists
[2:40:57.660 --> 2:40:59.660]  And then I saw deals, well, back a decade ago
[2:40:59.660 --> 2:41:02.660]  Where U.S. generals would say, we'll take care of terrorists in Canada
[2:41:02.660 --> 2:41:05.660]  They'll take care of terrorists here in Mexico, vice versa
[2:41:05.660 --> 2:41:07.660]  Saw Mexican troops for Katrina
[2:41:07.660 --> 2:41:10.660]  I went to urban warfare drills in 2000
[2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:13.660]  So like, you know, back in 96, 97, I was here on shortwave
[2:41:13.660 --> 2:41:15.660]  You know, oh, the U.N. troops would be like, come on, that's not going to happen
[2:41:15.660 --> 2:41:17.660]  Chinese troops in Mexico
[2:41:17.660 --> 2:41:20.660]  Until I was told that by colonels in the Marine Corps and stuff
[2:41:20.660 --> 2:41:22.660]  And was shown videos and things
[2:41:22.660 --> 2:41:24.660]  And now it's mainstream news
[2:41:24.660 --> 2:41:27.660]  So yes, America is a joke to the world
[2:41:27.660 --> 2:41:30.660]  I mean, it's all being pre-deployed, total treason
[2:41:30.660 --> 2:41:35.660]  And I don't know if any of it will ever be pulled
[2:41:35.660 --> 2:41:38.660]  I don't know if they're going to actually do it, but it's going on
[2:41:38.660 --> 2:41:41.660]  And I've seen the videos of the U.N. vehicles and armored vehicles
[2:41:41.660 --> 2:41:45.660]  And helicopters being deployed around the country
[2:41:45.660 --> 2:41:50.660]  Jim Keith, who they murdered, wrote black helicopters over America
[2:41:50.660 --> 2:41:52.660]  And I read that like in 96
[2:41:52.660 --> 2:41:54.660]  And I read it and thought, this is crazy
[2:41:54.660 --> 2:41:57.660]  And within five years, I thought, this guy's really smart
[2:41:57.660 --> 2:42:00.660]  And within about 15 years, this guy's a genius
[2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:03.660]  You know, 19 years later, he's a total genius
[2:42:03.660 --> 2:42:06.660]  Because everything, I mean, he was the guy saying
[2:42:06.660 --> 2:42:09.660]  They're spraying microplasms in the chem drills
[2:42:09.660 --> 2:42:12.660]  Before the chem drills even started
[2:42:14.660 --> 2:42:15.660]  And then they killed him
[2:42:15.660 --> 2:42:18.660]  I've talked to people that know him and they murdered him
[2:42:18.660 --> 2:42:21.660]  I was like 45 years old or whatever
[2:42:21.660 --> 2:42:24.660]  And that guy just, it was amazing
[2:42:24.660 --> 2:42:30.660]  And he was reporting on the U.N. caches of helicopters
[2:42:30.660 --> 2:42:34.660]  In old military bases that are kept service, even the company names
[2:42:34.660 --> 2:42:37.660]  I mean, he was a real journalist who got into all this stuff
[2:42:37.660 --> 2:42:40.660]  And when we'd have a segment at least every week
[2:42:40.660 --> 2:42:44.660]  Where we remembered someone persecuted or murdered by the New World Order
[2:42:44.660 --> 2:42:48.660]  Like Congressman Larry McDonald, Dr. McDonald
[2:42:48.660 --> 2:42:53.660]  People almost killed like Congressman Hanson, Jim Keith
[2:42:53.660 --> 2:42:57.660]  I mean, there have been so many folks that we need to remember
[2:42:57.660 --> 2:42:59.660]  What they've gone through and what happened to them
[2:42:59.660 --> 2:43:01.660]  But yeah, did you shoot video of this?
[2:43:01.660 --> 2:43:03.660]  Because I've seen some of the video of the U.N. vehicles
[2:43:03.660 --> 2:43:06.660]  Because if you ever see that, sir, you need to shoot video of it
[2:43:06.660 --> 2:43:09.660]  Because just because you know about it, other people need to see it
[2:43:09.660 --> 2:43:13.660]  Did you video it or did you just see the video online?
[2:43:13.660 --> 2:43:16.660]  Of the U.N. trucks, I saw the videos online
[2:43:16.660 --> 2:43:20.660]  Because the guy was from Louisiana, not Louisiana, Alabama
[2:43:20.660 --> 2:43:24.660]  And he was telling, he was saying that they're coming towards Georgia
[2:43:24.660 --> 2:43:26.660]  Towards FEMA Region 6
[2:43:26.660 --> 2:43:30.660]  But also something that I wanted to add is that my belief is that
[2:43:30.660 --> 2:43:33.660]  Our president, which I don't call him my president
[2:43:33.660 --> 2:43:38.660]  I think he's waging a giard on our people, on our American people
[2:43:38.660 --> 2:43:41.660]  Well, there's no doubt that they are bringing in radical Muslims
[2:43:41.660 --> 2:43:43.660]  To cause a cultural clash
[2:43:43.660 --> 2:43:46.660]  And that when you go to the airport, black, white, Hispanic, Arab, old, young
[2:43:46.660 --> 2:43:50.660]  It doesn't matter, if you're Americanized, you're getting a proctology exam
[2:43:50.660 --> 2:43:52.660]  If you've got a giant turban on your head
[2:43:52.660 --> 2:43:54.660]  Talking about a bin Laden, you're going to be worshiped
[2:43:54.660 --> 2:43:56.660]  So I appreciate your call
[2:43:56.660 --> 2:43:58.660]  Let's go to Ian in New York
[2:43:58.660 --> 2:44:01.660]  Ian, you're on the air, go ahead
[2:44:01.660 --> 2:44:03.660]  What's up, Alex Jones? How are you doing?
[2:44:03.660 --> 2:44:04.660]  Good, go ahead
[2:44:04.660 --> 2:44:09.660]  Any way, you were bringing up Walmart earlier on before you went to the break
[2:44:09.660 --> 2:44:14.660]  I just wanted you to know, I worked at a Walmart up here in the Catskills
[2:44:14.660 --> 2:44:16.660]  When I was in my 20s
[2:44:16.660 --> 2:44:19.660]  And I started to see the downfall of it back then
[2:44:19.660 --> 2:44:22.660]  Because back then, when I started
[2:44:22.660 --> 2:44:25.660]  You used to be able to get paid what you were worth
[2:44:25.660 --> 2:44:29.660]  Well, now they broke down the pay raises by departments back then
[2:44:29.660 --> 2:44:33.660]  And what they did was, is if you were in the lowest department which I was in
[2:44:33.660 --> 2:44:35.660]  Which was car pushing
[2:44:35.660 --> 2:44:41.660]  You could only make up to $14 an hour in your actual department if you got to the highest
[2:44:41.660 --> 2:44:43.660]  And that was the highest
[2:44:43.660 --> 2:44:47.660]  And as soon as you want to make more money, you had to move up with the company
[2:44:47.660 --> 2:44:53.660]  But with that many people in one store, how can so many people move up with the company?
[2:44:53.660 --> 2:44:55.660]  Well, that's it
[2:44:55.660 --> 2:44:58.660]  But it's not even what they're paying because in a free market
[2:44:58.660 --> 2:45:01.660]  People don't need to be paid because there's going to be competition
[2:45:01.660 --> 2:45:03.660]  For good people
[2:45:03.660 --> 2:45:08.660]  Who designs an economic model to destroy everything else in the community
[2:45:08.660 --> 2:45:11.660]  And so that's why Walmart is such an issue
[2:45:11.660 --> 2:45:15.660]  Is they create these deserts out there in the culture
[2:45:15.660 --> 2:45:17.660]  And they sell Chinese slave goods
[2:45:17.660 --> 2:45:20.660]  But it doesn't matter because they have giant American flags hanging up
[2:45:20.660 --> 2:45:24.660]  That says Made in America, I appreciate your call, great point
[2:45:24.660 --> 2:45:26.660]  Will in FEMA Region 5
[2:45:26.660 --> 2:45:31.660]  What former state are you in now under FEMA control?
[2:45:31.660 --> 2:45:33.660]  Hello sir, how are you doing today?
[2:45:33.660 --> 2:45:36.660]  I'm good, what former state are you calling from?
[2:45:36.660 --> 2:45:38.660]  Michigan
[2:45:38.660 --> 2:45:41.660]  Oh, they've certainly done a nice job there
[2:45:41.660 --> 2:45:43.660]  Nathan Gatt turned out real good, huh?
[2:45:43.660 --> 2:45:47.660]  Yeah, and even though I know you like to
[2:45:47.660 --> 2:45:49.660]  And kind of talking on Walmart
[2:45:49.660 --> 2:45:57.660]  Because I had to buy some stuff for some camping and family hold goodness that was needed
[2:45:57.660 --> 2:46:01.660]  Because I picked my family out camping while they were going
[2:46:01.660 --> 2:46:03.660]  So there are OCC rules against profanity
[2:46:03.660 --> 2:46:06.660]  Families are hateful and hurt people's feelings that don't have families
[2:46:06.660 --> 2:46:10.660]  Do not wear American flags, do not say the word family, thank you
[2:46:10.660 --> 2:46:15.660]  Well, in any case, when I was checking out and that
[2:46:15.660 --> 2:46:22.660]  I seen a guy buying some ammo and he thought all the ammo reason it was like hard to get 22
[2:46:22.660 --> 2:46:25.660]  And other forms of ammo was everybody was hoarding them
[2:46:25.660 --> 2:46:30.660]  I've never heard of the homeland security doing the bullet buys
[2:46:30.660 --> 2:46:34.660]  Or shutting down the gold smelting facility, the last one in the country this year
[2:46:34.660 --> 2:46:39.660]  Or doing importation bans or trying to buy up all the small calibers
[2:46:39.660 --> 2:46:48.660]  Of course, also on another note, and it's one that if you want to call it a minor economic fight
[2:46:48.660 --> 2:46:54.660]  Here in this region, there's what you could call a minor version of Walmart called Myers
[2:46:54.660 --> 2:46:59.660]  That pulls about the same level of bull in this region
[2:46:59.660 --> 2:47:04.660]  And it does the same thing, and even though some of their stores are Union
[2:47:04.660 --> 2:47:11.660]  Which you know where the money from the former Union dues on that goes
[2:47:11.660 --> 2:47:16.660]  But yeah, they're crazy all over
[2:47:16.660 --> 2:47:21.660]  And the unions are promoting legal aliens coming here to drop down their wages and take their jobs
[2:47:21.660 --> 2:47:23.660]  What a great plan
[2:47:23.660 --> 2:47:25.660]  Good points, good to hear from you Will
[2:47:25.660 --> 2:47:29.660]  Let's talk to Murrell in Oklahoma, you're on the air
[2:47:29.660 --> 2:47:33.660]  I know another Murrell from Oklahoma, Murrell Haggard, go ahead
[2:47:33.660 --> 2:47:38.660]  Alright Alex, how are you today sir? Thank you for having me on your show
[2:47:38.660 --> 2:47:40.660]  You bet, good to have you here sir
[2:47:40.660 --> 2:47:48.660]  Yes, like on these armored vehicles, they're kind of quit saying anything about them
[2:47:48.660 --> 2:47:53.660]  We know the news is put on there that Copperville, Kansas has received one
[2:47:53.660 --> 2:47:57.660]  And a Cherokee Nation may have given one to the Cherokee Nation
[2:47:57.660 --> 2:48:02.660]  So that might maybe be a whole new turn to cowboys and new dens
[2:48:02.660 --> 2:48:06.660]  On this issue with the immigrants, you Eagles
[2:48:06.660 --> 2:48:14.660]  I called my congressman, Mark Whiting-Mullen, and Langford is running for Coteburn's office
[2:48:14.660 --> 2:48:19.660]  And first I started lying to me about, oh those are just little kids
[2:48:19.660 --> 2:48:23.660]  I said well they have the documentation, I didn't tell them where it came from
[2:48:23.660 --> 2:48:28.660]  That mothers and their letting gang members into this, what's going on?
[2:48:28.660 --> 2:48:33.660]  Well we don't know, we can't control that, that's Obama's executive order
[2:48:33.660 --> 2:48:39.660]  And I said well can somebody go up there and get a straight jacket put on his butt
[2:48:39.660 --> 2:48:46.660]  And they told me they finally said that they didn't want to hear it when I caught them in their lives
[2:48:46.660 --> 2:48:50.660]  But they didn't want to hear it, and it wasn't their business that hung up on me
[2:48:50.660 --> 2:48:54.660]  So if you're up behind this listening on election that's going on
[2:48:54.660 --> 2:49:01.660]  You've got people who's down to come in office, they're in on that, they're in on the bad stuff
[2:49:01.660 --> 2:49:05.660]  But I just thank you for your time Alex, God bless what your whole crew does
[2:49:05.660 --> 2:49:13.660]  Thank you so much brother, yeah they got Boehner and others out saying, see we need to legalize the illegals to fix the problem
[2:49:13.660 --> 2:49:17.660]  That's like Obama saying come, come, that'll fix the problem
[2:49:17.660 --> 2:49:20.660]  Be like if your boat had a hole in it and you went let me fix that
[2:49:20.660 --> 2:49:26.660]  So you shot 85 more holes in it, grabbed a hatchet for hacking holes in the bottom of the boat
[2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:32.660]  The country is going into depression, the meat prices are doubling, the fuel prices are increasing
[2:49:32.660 --> 2:49:36.660]  The money machine printing is up on high, the elite is all dancing around
[2:49:36.660 --> 2:49:43.660]  While the rest of the country falls apart, you have to build up the United States to build up the countries around it
[2:49:43.660 --> 2:49:49.660]  You don't, David Knight had the analogy of the oxygen mass
[2:49:49.660 --> 2:49:56.660]  They tell you in a plane if you're with your children and the oxygen pressure gets lost and the oxygen mass drop
[2:49:56.660 --> 2:49:59.660]  You only got like 20, 30 seconds to get it on before you pass out
[2:49:59.660 --> 2:50:03.660]  Get it on yourself, get it working, then get it on your kids
[2:50:03.660 --> 2:50:08.660]  Because if you wait and try to get it on your kids and you're going to pass out, they're not going to be able to get it on you
[2:50:08.660 --> 2:50:12.660]  I mean I really want prosperity in Latin America
[2:50:12.660 --> 2:50:17.660]  But I don't want to live in Guatemala, that's the second largest immigrant group
[2:50:17.660 --> 2:50:22.660]  Guatemala is as close to living hell as you can get
[2:50:22.660 --> 2:50:26.660]  I have family that live down there, I've been down there, it's scary folks
[2:50:26.660 --> 2:50:30.660]  Let me tell you, I've been down there one time and I ain't going back
[2:50:30.660 --> 2:50:36.660]  The whole place is one giant open sur of crime and evil and poverty
[2:50:36.660 --> 2:50:41.660]  It's ultra beautiful, volcanoes, jungles, but it is hell
[2:50:41.660 --> 2:50:45.660]  And those people have no idea what freedom is
[2:50:45.660 --> 2:50:52.660]  By the way, we have a double link on Drudge, this new article, Border Agents Quitting Over Catch and Release of Known Gang Members
[2:50:52.660 --> 2:50:58.660]  MSR Team, Desperate Agents Police for Help Ignored as DHS Bankrolls Invasion
[2:51:28.660 --> 2:51:35.660]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank
[2:51:35.660 --> 2:51:38.660]  Having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt
[2:51:38.660 --> 2:51:45.660]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army
[2:51:45.660 --> 2:51:52.660]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system, call for your copy 800-686-2237
[2:51:52.660 --> 2:51:59.660]  It's time to understand the system, call 800-686-2237, that's 800-686-2237

[2:52:12.660 --> 2:52:17.660]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us that we are the ones responsible
[2:52:17.660 --> 2:52:20.660]  Prime-directed discredit Alex Jones
[2:52:20.660 --> 2:52:22.660]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory
[2:52:22.660 --> 2:52:25.660]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Info Wars
[2:52:25.660 --> 2:52:28.660]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin jail
[2:52:28.660 --> 2:52:30.660]  These people are assaulting us
[2:52:30.660 --> 2:52:32.660]  Targeting of patriots engaged
[2:52:32.660 --> 2:52:38.660]  They are never going to stop, they're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them

[2:52:53.660 --> 2:53:09.660]  Electrally it's for God you can fail it

[2:54:43.660 --> 2:54:50.660]  Big deal in the London Telegraph and several other publications, tell us about what's coming up on the nightly news tonight
[2:54:50.660 --> 2:54:58.660]  Well, it was actually kind of ironic that at this Margaret Thatcher conference, you've got these people who are pushing NAFTA, they're pushing the European Union
[2:54:58.660 --> 2:55:02.660]  She helped kill the takeover of England for a while
[2:55:02.660 --> 2:55:08.660]  Exactly, and after she spoke out at Bilderberg, she was thrown out, but of course David Petraeus has been there now for two years in a row
[2:55:08.660 --> 2:55:13.660]  And he was at this conference, we're going to talk about this tonight in the nightly news, and he answered the question in his conference
[2:55:13.660 --> 2:55:21.660]  After America, what next? Okay, and he talked about America Plus, and he said, well what's coming after America is North America
[2:55:21.660 --> 2:55:26.660]  Highly integrated forces of Canada, the US, and Mexico, and of course he says NAFTA
[2:55:26.660 --> 2:55:30.660]  That's what this is really about, when people don't understand what's going on with immigration, they don't understand anything
[2:55:30.660 --> 2:55:38.660]  It's the collapse of all three countries into total slavery, with Mexico and North Korea and China as the model, we'll cover that tonight at 7 o'clock in detail
[2:55:38.660 --> 2:55:45.660]  The article's Margaret Thatcher conference on liberty, as it happened, London Telegraph, and she fought what they're now selling
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:48.660]  Let's go to your report, David Knight
[2:55:48.660 --> 2:55:56.660]  Half now, the House of Representatives has been investigating the IRS to see if they singled out Tea Party groups for political persecution
[2:55:56.660 --> 2:56:03.660]  A large part of that investigation are incriminating emails that the IRS is now saying have disappeared
[2:56:03.660 --> 2:56:11.660]  Is it credible that Lois Lerner and now six other IRS officials would lose all of their emails due to a computer disk crash?
[2:56:11.660 --> 2:56:19.660]  Now some people might find that credible because that's happened to them with their personal computers, but we're not talking about personal computers
[2:56:19.660 --> 2:56:26.660]  You found one? Did I? It looks like this one is deducting for medical payments covered by insurance
[2:56:26.660 --> 2:56:33.660]  This, we suspect, is how a great many people think of ADP, automatic data processing
[2:56:33.660 --> 2:56:41.660]  The newest tax tool of the Internal Revenue Service, and a new dimension in tax administration
[2:56:41.660 --> 2:56:51.660]  The IRS has policies, procedures, and technology that you don't have on your personal computer. We're told that the electronic records weren't archived for very long
[2:56:51.660 --> 2:57:02.660]  But the IRS's own record keeping requirements for us treats electronic records the same as paper records and requires that we keep records for three to seven years
[2:57:02.660 --> 2:57:15.660]  And definitely if fraud is suspected. But IRS policy says that official emails are federal records and they're required to be printed and stored separately and permanently
[2:57:15.660 --> 2:57:27.660]  And the emails don't just reside on a hard disk. These emails pass through servers and the IRS has a huge IT department to ensure that data is backed up and preserved
[2:57:27.660 --> 2:57:35.660]  And reporter Cheryl Eccason reports that an IRS official told her that email is backed up with something called a RAID
[2:57:35.660 --> 2:57:42.660]  A RAID is a redundant array of independent disks. In other words, two physical hard drives are put together in one enclosure
[2:57:42.660 --> 2:57:46.660]  Information written to one is also written to another
[2:57:46.660 --> 2:57:52.660]  Now what that means is that although a single hard drive might have a meantime between failure of five years
[2:57:52.660 --> 2:57:58.660]  That would give you a probability of about 1 in 78,000 that this would fail
[2:57:58.660 --> 2:58:08.660]  When you put them together in a RAID configuration that's mirrored for security, you wind up with a meantime between failure of 500 years in billions
[2:58:08.660 --> 2:58:17.660]  In other words, it's not credible even if they weren't mirrored that all seven of these would fail and lose the most critical time period that they're looking for
[2:58:17.660 --> 2:58:22.660]  Let's say the IRS officials need to be held to the same standard that they hold the rest of America to
[2:58:22.660 --> 2:58:27.660]  For example, they should be guilty until they can prove that they're innocent
[2:58:27.660 --> 2:58:31.660]  They should be required to retain data for seven years just as we are
[2:58:31.660 --> 2:58:37.660]  We'll be back in overdrive with more. Stay with us at infowars.com
[2:58:37.660 --> 2:58:48.660]  Thank you for watching
[2:59:12.660 --> 2:59:16.660]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week
[2:59:16.660 --> 2:59:20.660]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[2:59:20.660 --> 2:59:26.660]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosilic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate
[2:59:26.660 --> 2:59:30.660]  Fluoride is in teats and coffees and waters and breads and toothpaste
[2:59:30.660 --> 2:59:34.660]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it
[2:59:34.660 --> 2:59:37.660]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water

[2:59:49.660 --> 2:59:53.660]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[2:59:53.660 --> 3:00:06.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[3:00:27.660 --> 3:00:30.660]  Let's jam in as many calls as we can right now in overdrive
[3:00:30.660 --> 3:00:34.660]  Shane in Florida, thanks for holding. You're on the air. Go ahead
[3:00:34.660 --> 3:00:37.660]  Hey, how's it going, Mr. Jones? Shane Hess here
[3:00:37.660 --> 3:00:41.660]  I called you a couple years ago when I was still in the military. I was an Apache driver at the time
[3:00:41.660 --> 3:00:46.660]  I want to let you know that there is something you can find online called CMOS
[3:00:46.660 --> 3:00:49.660]  Which is a common missile warning system
[3:00:49.660 --> 3:00:54.660]  All aircraft in the US military are retrofitted with this technology
[3:00:54.660 --> 3:01:00.660]  Which basically renders any portable service-to-air missile device virtually irrelevant
[3:01:00.660 --> 3:01:02.660]  Is that where it fires out all the flares?
[3:01:02.660 --> 3:01:04.660]  Yeah, that's what it is
[3:01:04.660 --> 3:01:07.660]  And something that we should be putting out there because let's think about this
[3:01:07.660 --> 3:01:12.660]  If we end up having an event which we know could be used as a fall flag or whatever you want to call it
[3:01:12.660 --> 3:01:17.660]  They're going to end up retrofitting every civilian airline with this anyway
[3:01:17.660 --> 3:01:19.660]  So if this is a threat and they're admitting it
[3:01:19.660 --> 3:01:23.660]  Then they should go ahead and just start retrofitting these things now to prevent it from ever happening
[3:01:23.660 --> 3:01:25.660]  That's just my one point there
[3:01:25.660 --> 3:01:30.660]  And then the one other thing I want to let you know is we are still talking in the military every single day
[3:01:30.660 --> 3:01:38.660]  I'm not in my unit anymore, but I have a former Lieutenant who's now a company commander
[3:01:38.660 --> 3:01:45.660]  And she just put together a memo on 31 March of 2014
[3:01:45.660 --> 3:01:50.660]  And bullet 3 says that the soldiers and officers of this command basically upholding their oath
[3:01:50.660 --> 3:01:55.660]  Each member of Delta Company will be required to sign for and maintain a copy of the US Constitution
[3:01:55.660 --> 3:01:58.660]  Issued to them upon arrival to the company
[3:01:58.660 --> 3:02:03.660]  I'm not going to give any specific information about who my former Lieutenant was
[3:02:03.660 --> 3:02:07.660]  But I can certainly forward you what this memo looks like
[3:02:07.660 --> 3:02:11.660]  And there's real stuff happening in the command structure at the low level
[3:02:11.660 --> 3:02:14.660]  To basically awaken people to their constitutional oath
[3:02:14.660 --> 3:02:18.660]  Well that's what I have seen happen the last 19 years on air
[3:02:18.660 --> 3:02:23.660]  Is that when they try to get the military at the low and mid level to do bad things
[3:02:23.660 --> 3:02:29.660]  It actually causes a big awakening and a constitutional rebellion against that tyranny
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:33.660]  Please send that to showtipsatinfowars.com
[3:02:33.660 --> 3:02:37.660]  Just give us the details, we'll cover up the names to protect everybody
[3:02:37.660 --> 3:02:44.660]  That the military is rebelling in a legal and lawful way by promoting the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[3:02:44.660 --> 3:02:48.660]  And reminding people what their real oaths are
[3:02:48.660 --> 3:02:52.660]  And that's the last thing the establishment wants so that's a beautiful thing
[3:02:52.660 --> 3:02:57.660]  And I am aware of that happening and going on and it's very exciting
[3:02:57.660 --> 3:03:01.660]  That's why it's key for veterans to reach out to their friends that are still in
[3:03:01.660 --> 3:03:06.660]  And to let them know that we're awake, that they're waking up and that we can save this country
[3:03:06.660 --> 3:03:10.660]  That's why the globalists are desperately opening the borders up right now
[3:03:10.660 --> 3:03:14.660]  Appreciate a lot of us know who you are, we appreciate what you're doing sir
[3:03:14.660 --> 3:03:17.660]  And we're not going to let this happen
[3:03:17.660 --> 3:03:22.660]  The big thing is are we going to unify around some basic principles of being good people
[3:03:22.660 --> 3:03:27.660]  And so that's why a lot of the rhetoric that we need to have just needs to unify people
[3:03:27.660 --> 3:03:32.660]  Our biggest enemy right now is apathy, people are ready to do something but they're not exactly sure what to do
[3:03:32.660 --> 3:03:36.660]  Exactly, people need to know they have power and just speaking out against evil is good
[3:03:36.660 --> 3:03:42.660]  And then picking things to do locally is good but that's why we have a chance to win
[3:03:42.660 --> 3:03:46.660]  And why the system is so scared because there is a big awakening happening
[3:03:46.660 --> 3:03:50.660]  It really is happening folks, who's up next here
[3:03:50.660 --> 3:03:56.660]  Hubo in Wisconsin and then I'm out of time, I'm sorry the other callers, go ahead
[3:03:56.660 --> 3:04:01.660]  Yeah, hello Alex Jones, thank you for this opportunity, it's Habu
[3:04:01.660 --> 3:04:05.660]  In any case, you know, I believe that you are
[3:04:05.660 --> 3:04:11.660]  Singularly the person who's speaking out from the highest rampart
[3:04:11.660 --> 3:04:17.660]  Against this whole Iraq story that is being fed by the mainstream media
[3:04:17.660 --> 3:04:23.660]  You are a cogent, stentorian and kudos to you
[3:04:23.660 --> 3:04:30.660]  You know, I listened to your previous guest whose website is WeMeantWell
[3:04:30.660 --> 3:04:35.660]  And I don't know what to think of it and he's not here to defend himself so I'm not going to lambage him
[3:04:35.660 --> 3:04:39.660]  Okay, we'll just keep doing more overdrive, we'll do one more segment, we'll talk to Brian, Anthony and Mark
[3:04:39.660 --> 3:04:42.660]  Stay there, you've called before, how do you pronounce your name?
[3:04:42.660 --> 3:04:43.660]  Habu
[3:04:43.660 --> 3:04:48.660]  Habu, okay I'll get it right, alright I can hardly speak English much less, let's get other names right
[3:04:48.660 --> 3:04:52.660]  It's a cool name, I just can't, you know, hardly say my name correctly myself
[3:04:52.660 --> 3:04:55.660]  So Habu, stay there, we'll come back to you, let you finish your point
[3:04:55.660 --> 3:04:59.660]  Then Mark, Brian and Anthony, straight ahead in overdrive
[3:04:59.660 --> 3:05:04.660]  Man, when I get home from work, all Betty does is watch her reality TV and then she goes to sleep
[3:05:04.660 --> 3:05:10.660]  I can take her on romantic dates, I get her flowers, you name it, she's just not the woman I married
[3:05:10.660 --> 3:05:12.660]  Oh Ralph, that's just awful
[3:05:12.660 --> 3:05:17.660]  Does this seem familiar? Are the honeymoon days of your relationship long gone?
[3:05:17.660 --> 3:05:25.660]  If so, consider the abundance of chemical additives, pesticides, BPA containers, contaminated tap water
[3:05:25.660 --> 3:05:30.660]  And other toxic substances found in our environment, experts know our bodies are suffering
[3:05:30.660 --> 3:05:34.660]  And being thrown off balance, especially when it comes to your natural systems

[3:07:57.660 --> 3:08:19.660]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show
[3:08:19.660 --> 3:08:30.660]  I want to go over too much what he said but he sounded a lot like the clueless Senator Biden
[3:08:30.660 --> 3:08:34.660]  When you remember he had his hearings on Iraq and he said
[3:08:34.660 --> 3:08:37.660]  I think this was two or three years after the invasion
[3:08:37.660 --> 3:08:43.660]  That it should be divided into three parts as if it was for him to pre-ordain what Iraq should be
[3:08:43.660 --> 3:08:52.660]  And this person is kind of saying the same thing as have others when the Syrian matter was in bad shape
[3:08:52.660 --> 3:08:56.660]  For the Assad government they were saying oh it should be divided into this or the other
[3:08:56.660 --> 3:09:01.660]  You know these people have no clue respectfully about what is going on there
[3:09:01.660 --> 3:09:04.660]  And it is for the indigenous peoples to decide
[3:09:04.660 --> 3:09:09.660]  And I think this is what we want from the globalist perspective as you say
[3:09:09.660 --> 3:09:21.660]  To divide it into these bunch of stands so that they can't work together and provide their own sovereignty and resistance
[3:09:21.660 --> 3:09:25.660]  That's what's going on is a destabilization program and Brzezinski admits that
[3:09:25.660 --> 3:09:29.660]  And then you got somebody from the State Department like Van Buren who's a smart guy
[3:09:29.660 --> 3:09:33.660]  But from his perspective it's inept but we have all the quotes it's not inept
[3:09:33.660 --> 3:09:37.660]  It's order out of chaos it's milking chaos
[3:09:37.660 --> 3:09:42.660]  And it is the plan to deindustrialize and reduce the population of Iraq
[3:09:42.660 --> 3:09:48.660]  Look they had a stable government before they had Saddam Hussein overthrow it in 79
[3:09:48.660 --> 3:09:52.660]  Then they overthrew him who was stable compared to what was there
[3:09:52.660 --> 3:09:56.660]  And then they talk about how screwed up it is and their answer is break it in more parts
[3:09:56.660 --> 3:10:03.660]  And it's just going to continue on forever this is their model and that's their program
[3:10:03.660 --> 3:10:11.660]  You're absolutely correct and you've been saying this for a long time whether it was Syria or Libya or Iraq before that
[3:10:11.660 --> 3:10:13.660]  And you singly
[3:10:13.660 --> 3:10:18.660]  Oh please don't praise me brother we're all in this together it's pretty simple to see once you've studied it
[3:10:18.660 --> 3:10:22.660]  But at least you are saying it and others aren't so that's the difference
[3:10:22.660 --> 3:10:28.660]  In any case you know I also have a problem with his website that Van Buren that we meant well
[3:10:28.660 --> 3:10:36.660]  Ever since 91 when we you know the highway of death and all the continuous bombing in the 90s
[3:10:36.660 --> 3:10:41.660]  And then you know even Bill Clinton before that and you know it was worth the price
[3:10:41.660 --> 3:10:43.660]  We never meant well
[3:10:43.660 --> 3:10:49.660]  Well I think he means that he meant well and again at the compartmentalized mid-level he was at
[3:10:49.660 --> 3:10:57.660]  They really believe the mission but they're told that the mission is A when the mission is really Q
[3:10:57.660 --> 3:11:02.660]  And so they're following on this mission doesn't make sense because they're compartmentalized
[3:11:02.660 --> 3:11:09.660]  I mean I don't think he's a bad guy I agree totally with his analysis on the situation in Ukraine
[3:11:09.660 --> 3:11:18.660]  He was just involved in Iraq so I think that's where you get what I would call the distortion in that point he was making
[3:11:18.660 --> 3:11:26.660]  But as far as the facts he was giving I think they're pretty accurate but how do you think Iraq's going to end up?
[3:11:26.660 --> 3:11:35.660]  You know I hate to say this I think Iran is going to play a bigger and bigger role and to the detriment of the Iraqi people
[3:11:35.660 --> 3:11:43.660]  And not that I don't like Iran or anything like this but you know if I'm for sovereignty against US interference
[3:11:43.660 --> 3:11:47.660]  I'm also for sovereignty against Iranian and other interference
[3:11:47.660 --> 3:11:53.660]  And you know these the poor people of Iraq have suffered for four decades now
[3:11:53.660 --> 3:11:59.660]  And you know if anything good can come out of this to answer your question
[3:11:59.660 --> 3:12:08.660]  I hope there is a final convulsion which will finally kind of bring this together
[3:12:08.660 --> 3:12:11.660]  The people have had enough but they want to be Iraqis
[3:12:11.660 --> 3:12:14.660]  No I hear you I'll say this and I appreciate your call I've got to move on to others
[3:12:14.660 --> 3:12:19.660]  But our government in 79 puts Saddam Hussein in power
[3:12:19.660 --> 3:12:25.660]  He was CIA he was trained then they tell him to attack Iran then they tell him oh go ahead and invade Kuwait
[3:12:25.660 --> 3:12:31.660]  Then they set him up then they kill over a million people with sanctions and war over the next couple decades
[3:12:31.660 --> 3:12:35.660]  And then now they're invading it with Al Qaeda who was armed
[3:12:35.660 --> 3:12:42.660]  The globalists don't want any strong quasi secular first world nations
[3:12:42.660 --> 3:12:50.660]  That was Saddam's crime was swimming pools 60% of girls going to college and having high IQs
[3:12:50.660 --> 3:12:56.660]  And now they've been totally wrecked and ruined and it's the model of what the globalists push
[3:12:56.660 --> 3:13:01.660]  And Saudi Arabia who's a big partner in this wants a weak neighbor to the north
[3:13:01.660 --> 3:13:06.660]  And it's just a barrel of snakes is all I can say
[3:13:06.660 --> 3:13:10.660]  You know it's easy to have this subterfuge Machiavelli in mind
[3:13:10.660 --> 3:13:13.660]  The Arabs have had that forever look what it's done to him
[3:13:13.660 --> 3:13:18.660]  You've just got to be honorable and when I say Arabs I'm not saying they're dishonorable
[3:13:18.660 --> 3:13:23.660]  I'm saying the Arab elite you know the enemy of my enemy is my friend
[3:13:23.660 --> 3:13:26.660]  Well not necessarily if they're your enemy already I mean it's
[3:13:26.660 --> 3:13:33.660]  You know I mean if Jeffrey Dahmer didn't like some rock band that I like doesn't mean Jeffrey Dahmer is good
[3:13:33.660 --> 3:13:38.660]  Doesn't mean I throw in with Jeffrey Dahmer it's just
[3:13:38.660 --> 3:13:43.660]  These people that look at it and angle expediently for themselves
[3:13:43.660 --> 3:13:47.660]  Oh this will work good for my aims today that is knowledge not wisdom
[3:13:47.660 --> 3:13:51.660]  Let's talk to Mark in Illinois Mark you're on the air go ahead
[3:13:51.660 --> 3:13:53.660]  How you doing?
[3:13:53.660 --> 3:13:58.660]  I'm doing alright brother it's good to be alive and above ground any day above ground is a good day
[3:13:58.660 --> 3:14:03.660]  Any day above the flowers is a good day I'll tell you what Alex you got a live one here
[3:14:03.660 --> 3:14:12.660]  This whole immigration thing the way it's going and the destabilization of this country
[3:14:12.660 --> 3:14:18.660]  And the demoralization of this country I see it all around me I mean I see it every day
[3:14:18.660 --> 3:14:23.660]  You know there's there any jobs here anymore for the most part
[3:14:23.660 --> 3:14:29.660]  You know I see this country going to heck I'm going to try to stay on top of care I could talk about a lot of things
[3:14:29.660 --> 3:14:34.660]  But you know one of the things you brought up earlier with this you know it's David Nighting tonight
[3:14:34.660 --> 3:14:38.660]  And you know the collapse of the you know North America as a whole
[3:14:38.660 --> 3:14:43.660]  You know we all know what it's about it's about you know they're going to bring in the dear marrow you know
[3:14:43.660 --> 3:14:48.660]  And it's the North American Union and all that stuff and the reason why these globalists don't want this stronghold
[3:14:48.660 --> 3:14:53.660]  You know any type of stronghold anywhere is because you can't bring in a one world currency
[3:14:53.660 --> 3:15:00.660]  You know what I'm saying when there's just when any country or any organization or any people have a stronghold anywhere
[3:15:00.660 --> 3:15:01.660]  You just can't do that
[3:15:01.660 --> 3:15:06.660]  That's right it's about a lowering of everybody but the elite who are exempt from all their own regulations
[3:15:06.660 --> 3:15:14.660]  Cloward and Piven, agenda 21 that is the plan and Patreus said what comes after the immigration North American Union
[3:15:14.660 --> 3:15:21.660]  They're going to get rid of all the countries one huge mega sector and then have subdivisions
[3:15:21.660 --> 3:15:24.660]  Just like we were talking about Iraq playing us off against each other
[3:15:24.660 --> 3:15:33.660]  It is total abject treason at the Banff Canada 2007 meeting that we got the documents out of through judicial watch
[3:15:33.660 --> 3:15:41.660]  They said we will use immigration crisis, flu crisis and terror crisis to get rid of all the regulations on us
[3:15:41.660 --> 3:15:47.660]  And to put regulations on the public and it was government there and corporations planning our future great points
[3:15:47.660 --> 3:15:52.660]  The good news is the people are starting to figure that out
[3:15:52.660 --> 3:15:58.660]  I mean we have two articles linked on drudgereport.com right now the biggest news site in the world
[3:15:58.660 --> 3:16:03.660]  With government officials admitting the government is shipping the illegals in not just letting them be here
[3:16:03.660 --> 3:16:06.660]  They're shipping them in this is total treason
[3:16:06.660 --> 3:16:12.660]  This is oh you won't do blanket legalization we'll do it by fiat and say no more deportations
[3:16:12.660 --> 3:16:18.660]  People go no more deportations yeah well then they show up and by the way we're going to pay to get you in
[3:16:18.660 --> 3:16:23.660]  See the sky's the limit folks the sky's the limit
[3:16:23.660 --> 3:16:27.660]  Brian and pencilvania go ahead you're on the air
[3:16:27.660 --> 3:16:37.660]  Hello thank you I'm calling because Pennsylvania is being a tyrant over a citizen by not respecting their constitutional rights
[3:16:37.660 --> 3:16:40.660]  Wow that's that's part of it it's a lawless government
[3:16:40.660 --> 3:16:48.660]  Yeah and I'm fighting it I don't care I'm taking it to the US Supreme Court because I found all the case law that I need to fight
[3:16:48.660 --> 3:16:54.660]  You can find them in court that ties them up even if you don't win you can also just stop complying and act like an illegal alien
[3:16:54.660 --> 3:17:00.660]  And more and more that's what we have to do is just stop complying at any level don't shop with the big corporations
[3:17:00.660 --> 3:17:06.660]  And any law that's unconstitutional I personally am done I'm just done with it all
[3:17:06.660 --> 3:17:12.660]  Yeah and I'm saying for the new world order piss up a rub go ahead
[3:17:12.660 --> 3:17:16.660]  He robbed us of our financial freedom when Ed Rendell was the governor
[3:17:16.660 --> 3:17:21.660]  He sued with 11 other states at the back of company for $2.2 trillion
[3:17:21.660 --> 3:17:26.660]  And then I happened to catch it on the Pennsylvania government channel
[3:17:26.660 --> 3:17:32.660]  That's the only place he made the announcement that he said I can order legislation to end poverty right here now
[3:17:32.660 --> 3:17:38.660]  And I'm not going to do it then I'm going to fix the sewer system in a sex land river valley is going to cost $11 billion
[3:17:38.660 --> 3:17:42.660]  Which was his first installment from the settlement
[3:17:42.660 --> 3:17:49.660]  So I thought he committed treason right then and there when he fell because it were a commonwealth state that he should have ended poverty first
[3:17:49.660 --> 3:17:56.660]  You end poverty by creating a moral culture and creating an equitable culture without monopolies
[3:17:56.660 --> 3:17:59.660]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call we're moving quick here
[3:17:59.660 --> 3:18:03.660]  Government is getting away with whatever it wants corporations that run it are
[3:18:03.660 --> 3:18:07.660]  And so the sky's the limit you're going to see crazier and crazier stuff folks
[3:18:07.660 --> 3:18:10.660]  Because they don't get in trouble why shouldn't they
[3:18:10.660 --> 3:18:17.660]  Last caller sorry to Robert and Francis we're going to talk to Anthony in Florida go ahead and be our tailgunner here today brother

[3:18:26.660 --> 3:18:28.660]  Brother we're not screwing your call you're on the air go ahead
[3:18:28.660 --> 3:18:39.660]  Okay yeah this is definitely a conspiracy by the government to completely collapse us and turn us into a total socialist welfare nanny state
[3:18:39.660 --> 3:18:45.660]  And it's exact and then you know if you don't agree with it you're racist and
[3:18:45.660 --> 3:18:53.660]  Oh no I can't believe it's like a pearl of wisdom when a congressman or the border patrol union had or Joe Arpaio says that
[3:18:53.660 --> 3:19:01.660]  I mean it's like it's two plus two equals four it's being done on purpose to bankrupt the country and bring in socialist
[3:19:01.660 --> 3:19:12.660]  They don't even want hard-working immigrants from Latin America they want teenage kids that will grow up literally hanging from Michelle Obama's breast
[3:19:12.660 --> 3:19:22.660]  I mean literally I mean but it's not her breast it's our money so actually it's Michelle Obama attaching them like ticks to our rear ends go ahead
[3:19:22.660 --> 3:19:37.660]  I got a question too is it possible I could speak with you welfare at some point because I'd like to speak with you is there a way I could get a hold of you

[3:19:45.660 --> 3:19:51.660]  Send me a letter with whatever the information is maybe I can talk to you but who knows please don't be insulted if I don't
[3:19:51.660 --> 3:19:58.660]  Because all I do is work okay and I need to take some time off or I'm gonna burn out great job with the proof
