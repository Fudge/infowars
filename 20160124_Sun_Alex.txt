[00:00.000 --> 00:22.400]  My friends, it is Sunday, the 24th of January, 2016.
[00:22.400 --> 00:25.280]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:25.280 --> 00:32.760]  The most draconian military authorization in U.S. history is being rammed through the
[00:32.760 --> 00:38.200]  U.S. Senate and House as we speak while the East Coast is locked under some of the worst
[00:38.200 --> 00:42.640]  snow in the last decade with this blizzard that's already killed more than 15 people.
[00:42.640 --> 00:46.320]  We're going to be breaking that down straight ahead.
[00:46.320 --> 00:49.680]  I'm not saying this is going to lead to martial law.
[00:49.680 --> 00:52.240]  This is military martial law on paper.
[00:52.240 --> 00:56.840]  We're going to be breaking that down, and a lot more U.S. forces are moving back into
[00:56.840 --> 01:02.640]  Syria and Iraq, and it's hardly even in the news, but first, the establishment media is
[01:02.640 --> 01:04.640]  launching its attacks.
[01:04.640 --> 01:32.240]  I'm here to warn people, you keep telling me to shut up, this isn't a game.
[01:32.240 --> 01:33.240]  Kate's speech.
[01:33.240 --> 01:35.280]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[01:35.280 --> 01:39.600]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro-gun position.
[01:39.600 --> 01:43.560]  1776 will commence again if you're proud to take off fire arms.
[01:43.560 --> 01:45.720]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:45.720 --> 01:47.560]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[01:47.560 --> 01:50.800]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[01:50.800 --> 01:53.320]  It's an Internet talk show called Info Wars.
[01:53.320 --> 01:55.800]  I heard that on Alex Jones, so it's true.
[01:55.800 --> 01:56.800]  Dave.
[01:56.800 --> 01:58.800]  I heard it on Alex Jones, so I know it's true.
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.400]  You're making some very serious allegations against the U.S. government saying that they
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.240]  stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against U.S. citizens.
[02:07.240 --> 02:08.240]  Let's declassify.
[02:08.240 --> 02:09.240]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[02:09.240 --> 02:11.240]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:11.240 --> 02:12.240]  That man's breathless country.
[02:12.240 --> 02:13.240]  He is a conspiracy theorist.
[02:13.240 --> 02:14.240]  Seekly, I think, racist.
[02:14.240 --> 02:15.240]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:15.240 --> 02:16.240]  Considered legit among the crazy.
[02:16.240 --> 02:24.760]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[02:24.760 --> 02:25.760]  and pop him.
[02:25.760 --> 02:29.440]  I'd love to see that in uniform.
[02:29.440 --> 02:33.760]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[02:33.760 --> 02:36.760]  I like that, guys.
[02:36.760 --> 02:50.840]  That is the best.
[02:50.840 --> 02:53.280]  We have gangsters running this country.
[02:53.280 --> 02:54.280]  Criminals.
[02:54.280 --> 02:55.280]  Gangsters.
[02:55.280 --> 02:56.280]  We have more kids.
[02:56.280 --> 02:57.280]  We have more freedoms.
[02:57.280 --> 02:58.280]  We lose.
[02:58.280 --> 03:03.280]  We have a fog that is descended on our entire nation.
[03:03.280 --> 03:06.280]  The globalists are going to blow stuff up and blame it on you.
[03:06.280 --> 03:08.280]  Hillary's the one who runs the cover-up.
[03:08.280 --> 03:13.280]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to unfold in triplicate spage.
[03:13.280 --> 03:15.280]  This is real as it gets.
[03:15.280 --> 03:18.280]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me.
[03:18.280 --> 03:19.280]  I said, Matt, it's over for you.
[03:19.280 --> 03:22.280]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[03:22.280 --> 03:23.280]  You're out of there.
[03:23.280 --> 03:24.280]  You want it, baby.
[03:24.280 --> 03:31.280]  You're about to get it.
[03:31.280 --> 03:39.280]  We did meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant and see how many
[03:39.280 --> 03:42.280]  guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[03:42.280 --> 03:46.280]  We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk-ass brains out.
[03:46.280 --> 03:52.280]  Info wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal
[03:52.280 --> 03:57.280]  cover-up operatives, more than any other institution out there of freedom.
[03:57.280 --> 03:58.280]  And I'm so proud of that.
[03:58.280 --> 04:02.280]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women, no.
[04:02.280 --> 04:06.280]  Bill rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[04:06.280 --> 04:11.280]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when
[04:11.280 --> 04:17.280]  you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[04:17.280 --> 04:19.280]  These people are of the devil.
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.280]  There's been a lot about this.
[04:22.280 --> 04:25.280]  Raise hell and demand accountability.
[04:25.280 --> 04:31.280]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate criminal government in American history.
[04:31.280 --> 04:38.280]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[04:38.280 --> 04:41.280]  We're proud of now moving forward toward the barrier.
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.280]  The police have been telling everybody they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[04:46.280 --> 04:50.280]  Our feet will be, ultimately, a crushing war.
[04:50.280 --> 04:51.280]  That's right.
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.280]  And ladies and gentlemen, the government is not our enemy.
[04:53.280 --> 04:55.280]  It is a reflection of us.
[04:55.280 --> 04:58.280]  It's full of good people as well, but it hasn't captured.
[04:58.280 --> 05:04.280]  Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton denied reports that her private e-mail server had been hacked
[05:04.280 --> 05:10.280]  after being confronted by an Info Wars correspondent at a campaign stop in Iowa.
[05:10.280 --> 05:16.280]  Last week it was reported on InfoWars.com that your e-mail server was hacked and you knowingly
[05:16.280 --> 05:18.280]  continued to use your e-mail server.
[05:18.280 --> 05:19.280]  Can you comment on that?
[05:19.280 --> 05:20.280]  Yeah, it's totally untrue.
[05:20.280 --> 05:26.280]  The question stems from an exclusive InfoWars interview earlier this month in which former
[05:26.280 --> 05:32.280]  Secret Service agent Dan Bongino reported that Hillary continued using her private e-mail
[05:32.280 --> 05:38.280]  to discuss classified information while knowing that her server had been compromised.
[05:38.280 --> 05:41.280]  Clinton's knew it was hacked and she did it anyway.
[05:41.280 --> 05:46.280]  And not only is she not currently indicted or in prison, she's running to be president
[05:46.280 --> 05:47.280]  of the United States.
[05:47.280 --> 05:52.280]  If this is not a red flag to every Paul Revere out there that something's wrong, then you
[05:52.280 --> 05:53.280]  know what?
[05:53.280 --> 05:54.280]  The country is lost.
[05:54.280 --> 06:19.280]  You can learn more right now at InfoWars.com.
[06:19.280 --> 06:25.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide on this 24th day of January 2016.
[06:25.280 --> 06:28.280]  It is Sunday, which means two big playoff games.
[06:28.280 --> 06:32.280]  Right now we've got the New England Patriots against the Denver Broncos.
[06:32.280 --> 06:34.280]  New England, nine points.
[06:34.280 --> 06:36.280]  Denver on top at 17.
[06:36.280 --> 06:39.280]  And we're not going to discuss what's happening in the world economy.
[06:39.280 --> 06:44.280]  We're not going to discuss driverless cars on record to be taxpayer funded to basically
[06:44.280 --> 06:46.280]  ban humans driving cars.
[06:46.280 --> 06:50.960]  We're not going to get into Joe Biden announcing an invasion of ground troops in Syria, which
[06:50.960 --> 06:54.120]  will collide with Russian troops that can start World War III.
[06:54.120 --> 07:00.280]  We are not going to discuss the 6.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Alaska.
[07:00.280 --> 07:08.200]  We are not going to cover Defense 1 and the Associated Press reporting that the authorization
[07:08.200 --> 07:12.580]  of force that they're trying to pass in the Senate would give this president and future
[07:12.580 --> 07:20.280]  presidents unlimited dictatorial power in time and space and geospatially anywhere in the
[07:20.280 --> 07:22.280]  world.
[07:22.280 --> 07:26.080]  Unprecedented is even shocked Republicans, but it's hardly made the news.
[07:26.080 --> 07:30.040]  It is martial law powers being given to the president.
[07:30.040 --> 07:34.040]  Now let's be clear before the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN all run with a story
[07:34.040 --> 07:39.080]  for six months saying, I'm saying this is martial law and the action of martial law
[07:39.080 --> 07:43.080]  and the maximum level of martial law and then we'll all be in FEMA camps next week and
[07:43.080 --> 07:44.840]  they're coming to take our guns.
[07:44.840 --> 07:47.840]  Didn't say that about Jade Helm, not saying about this.
[07:47.840 --> 07:51.200]  Jade Helm and I've talked to the Special Forces troops that were involved in it.
[07:51.200 --> 07:53.240]  They said absolutely, Alex.
[07:53.240 --> 07:57.280]  It was training for anywhere in the world, but also here in the U.S. how to infiltrate
[07:57.280 --> 08:02.920]  and take over towns and to quote dominate the human domain as they've quoted.
[08:02.920 --> 08:07.280]  And that is basically what the training was for to condition us to operate against the
[08:07.280 --> 08:09.280]  American people.
[08:09.280 --> 08:11.800]  And we're not going to do it when the orders come down.
[08:11.800 --> 08:12.800]  Everyone knows.
[08:12.800 --> 08:17.360]  And I'm going to leave it right there that we have a lot of former and current Special
[08:17.360 --> 08:18.960]  Forces people obviously on.
[08:18.960 --> 08:23.240]  You can probably guess who's telling me that, but I don't need to hear it from them.
[08:23.240 --> 08:24.720]  I'm looking at it historically.
[08:24.720 --> 08:30.280]  I know what's going on and I'm warning you, it's kind of like a bad motorcycle gang moves
[08:30.280 --> 08:31.800]  in next door to you in your neighborhood.
[08:31.800 --> 08:36.520]  It's not a normal, you know, great motorcycle gang for veterans or a cop motorcycle gang
[08:36.520 --> 08:37.520]  or a motorcycle gang.
[08:37.520 --> 08:38.520]  It's Christian.
[08:38.520 --> 08:43.840]  Well, you know, most motorcycle gangs are great people, but there is that 3%.
[08:43.840 --> 08:47.920]  3% or as 1% or as they've got different names for it that are into a criminal lifestyle.
[08:47.920 --> 08:53.560]  And let's just say the Hell's Angels moves in next door to you or the Banditos.
[08:53.560 --> 08:58.040]  I don't know when you're going to have problems with them, but I can bet you are.
[08:58.040 --> 09:06.080]  And basically the Hell's Angels or the Mongols or the Banditos have taken over the government
[09:06.080 --> 09:10.400]  and they're changing all the laws in front of us doing whatever they want, running around
[09:10.400 --> 09:13.080]  engaging in tyranny and it's getting worse by the minute.
[09:13.080 --> 09:14.680]  I don't know how bad it's going to get.
[09:14.680 --> 09:17.440]  I don't know how far it's going to go, but man, it's already crazy.
[09:17.440 --> 09:20.680]  And by the way, it's not fair to say bad things about those motorcycle gangs that are actually
[09:20.680 --> 09:24.640]  lawful and good and honorable compared to the people that run our government.
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.760]  And in fact, I'm sorry for comparing them to the government because the government is
[09:28.760 --> 09:33.840]  the worst of the worst at the top at the mid level, low level, a lot of good people.
[09:33.840 --> 09:34.840]  They're not our enemies.
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.240]  The globalists want to start a civil war on this country that's pointed at local, state
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.760]  and low level federal government.
[09:40.760 --> 09:45.320]  That is not, I mean, that is exactly the top of destabilization garbage they pulled everywhere
[09:45.320 --> 09:46.320]  else.
[09:46.320 --> 09:48.520]  I am firmly against it.
[09:48.520 --> 09:53.480]  I'm for a revolution of ideas or revolution in voting with our dollars, our actions, not
[09:53.480 --> 09:55.200]  supporting globalist operations.
[09:55.200 --> 10:02.240]  I am for civil disobedience that's not violent and I'm for defending ourselves 110%.
[10:02.240 --> 10:06.520]  That means you get attacked in cold blood straight up by these people.
[10:06.520 --> 10:11.440]  You know, go first blood Rambo, whatever, but we don't start the fights.
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.520]  We finish them just like Lexington and Concord and don't worry, the globalist will stage
[10:16.520 --> 10:17.520]  false flags.
[10:17.520 --> 10:19.480]  They've done it before they'll do it again and blame us.
[10:19.480 --> 10:21.120]  But here's the good news.
[10:21.120 --> 10:24.400]  People see through that and I don't mean the public.
[10:24.400 --> 10:28.320]  The public kind of understands the concept now on average, but the military and police
[10:28.320 --> 10:31.040]  get it big time.
[10:31.040 --> 10:32.440]  I mean, big time.
[10:32.440 --> 10:33.440]  They get it.
[10:33.440 --> 10:34.640]  They see it.
[10:34.640 --> 10:37.280]  They figured it all out.
[10:37.280 --> 10:40.320]  They've surpassed my knowledge in many ways, studying it now.
[10:40.320 --> 10:42.360]  I mean, I can give you the good news.
[10:42.360 --> 10:44.040]  They're still run by the globalist.
[10:44.040 --> 10:50.680]  We're still in deep trouble, but it's a major ace in the hole that the globalist program
[10:50.680 --> 10:53.240]  of control is now known.
[10:53.240 --> 10:57.880]  Their systems, their modus operandi, their logic, their program, their operation.
[10:57.880 --> 10:59.680]  And that's what this show is here to do.
[10:59.680 --> 11:04.440]  Show their operational manuals sky high.
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.080]  Bring them right out in the open for everybody to see them so people know what they're looking
[11:08.080 --> 11:10.200]  for when things happen.
[11:10.200 --> 11:11.200]  Okay.
[11:11.200 --> 11:14.560]  Obviously, we're not going to be talking about the football here today.
[11:14.560 --> 11:18.080]  I'm not against the football.
[11:18.080 --> 11:26.120]  Okay, it's just that our country has slipped so far that if one more person asked me about
[11:26.120 --> 11:28.760]  the power ball a few weeks ago, I was going to go crazy.
[11:28.760 --> 11:32.320]  And if one more person asked me about, Hey, you know, did you watch the game?
[11:32.320 --> 11:33.320]  Wasn't it great?
[11:33.320 --> 11:35.240]  Look, I'm sorry.
[11:35.240 --> 11:40.520]  My country is being overrun by criminal activity.
[11:40.520 --> 11:46.560]  Bernie Sanders came out on national television on Meet the Press and said basically confiscate
[11:46.560 --> 11:47.960]  guns nationwide.
[11:47.960 --> 11:50.720]  That clip's coming up.
[11:50.720 --> 11:57.480]  Biden says, quote, US Turkey ready for military solution Syria as Russian and Turkish troops.
[11:57.480 --> 12:01.560]  This is mainstream news line up on each side of the border with each other.
[12:01.560 --> 12:04.960]  We got the Russians lining up to fight with NATO.
[12:04.960 --> 12:08.400]  They're already fighting NATO in Ukraine right now.
[12:08.400 --> 12:13.680]  This is so dangerous.
[12:13.680 --> 12:19.480]  It's a real game that could lead to thermal nuclear war and the end of life on this planet.
[12:19.480 --> 12:24.320]  And that's not all it shows saying that that's many analysts stock markets are down about
[12:24.320 --> 12:28.040]  a third worldwide they're plunging.
[12:28.040 --> 12:32.240]  Depression is happening in over a hundred countries recession over 30 countries have
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.560]  civil wars or wars going on in them.
[12:34.560 --> 12:39.080]  The world is on fire to quote the Pentagon two years ago.
[12:39.080 --> 12:44.920]  The average American, the average European is still somewhat sheltered is still somewhat
[12:44.920 --> 12:49.360]  above this, but the water is rising.
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.880]  And so the area of my brain that would be used a war game football.
[12:54.880 --> 12:55.880]  That's what it is.
[12:55.880 --> 12:57.800]  It's chess on a field.
[12:57.800 --> 12:58.800]  I don't play a lot of chess.
[12:58.800 --> 13:01.720]  I used to play chess when I was a kid because games were fun.
[13:01.720 --> 13:02.720]  Video games were fun.
[13:02.720 --> 13:04.440]  Shoot them up games were fun.
[13:04.440 --> 13:06.480]  See, I do that now in the real world.
[13:06.480 --> 13:10.320]  I play chess in the real world for the future of the country and the planet.
[13:10.320 --> 13:17.360]  So see my masculine war gaming centers of my brain aren't watching other warriors have
[13:17.360 --> 13:19.920]  a simulated fight with each other a gladiatorial event.
[13:19.920 --> 13:26.760]  I'm actually alive involved in the real world trying to get other people involved.
[13:26.760 --> 13:34.640]  I'm actually open carrying an M4 on my back in San Antonio with 1500 other Texans in defiance
[13:34.640 --> 13:37.440]  of a city law saying they'll arrest us for doing it.
[13:37.440 --> 13:43.080]  And I marched with the state land commissioner at the Alamo and the police had to stand down
[13:43.080 --> 13:44.560]  because they knew we were in the right.
[13:44.560 --> 13:51.000]  See that's a real field of battle in the information war, not the simulated one with
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.320]  the football game.
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.320]  If your son or daughter is on the lacrosse team or on the basketball team or on the
[13:57.320 --> 14:02.640]  football team or on the swim team, mine are as well.
[14:02.640 --> 14:04.080]  I go watch it.
[14:04.080 --> 14:05.080]  It's great.
[14:05.080 --> 14:06.080]  It's good for them.
[14:06.080 --> 14:11.040]  Competition, working as a team, learning to get hurt, learning to get up, learning to
[14:11.040 --> 14:13.720]  be strong, simulated fighting.
[14:13.720 --> 14:15.600]  It's the legal place to fight.
[14:15.600 --> 14:16.600]  It's good for you.
[14:16.600 --> 14:17.600]  Sports is great.
[14:17.600 --> 14:18.600]  I love it.
[14:18.600 --> 14:19.600]  It's wholesome.
[14:19.600 --> 14:23.000]  When you're playing it or you're watching your family or when you're on a softball team
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.200]  or a baseball team, that's great.
[14:24.200 --> 14:29.040]  Don't, you know, not, not watching TV, not having a barbecue, whatever.
[14:29.040 --> 14:35.800]  What we've got here is a sick country obsessed with football and powerball and LeBron James
[14:35.800 --> 14:43.240]  and having all these role models while our entire future is being stolen.
[14:43.240 --> 14:45.880]  Would be like if somebody invited me over to their house and I lived across the street
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.480]  from a bank and they were said, hey, come over and watch a TV show with us.
[14:51.480 --> 14:54.960]  And then I see the bank being robbed and I say, hey, Mabel, I'm going to go call the
[14:54.960 --> 14:55.960]  police right now.
[14:55.960 --> 14:58.120]  They're robbing the bank and Mabel says, you're crazy.
[14:58.120 --> 14:59.120]  You're insulting.
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.240]  You don't want to come over here and watch TV with me.
[15:01.240 --> 15:06.000]  It's not that it's bad that you're in there watching television.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.160]  That's an allegory of not living in the real world.
[15:08.160 --> 15:14.240]  It's that the real crimes going on 100 yards away or there's a car wreck with bleeding
[15:14.240 --> 15:18.480]  dying people on the street and I'm supposed to go run off and buy a powerball ticket
[15:18.480 --> 15:23.280]  and go run off and watch football all day while the world passes us by.
[15:23.280 --> 15:25.440]  That's why we're so screwed.
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.880]  That's why Congress is doing things they've never done before because people are in a
[15:29.880 --> 15:32.080]  pre-matrix.
[15:32.080 --> 15:33.080]  They're in a trance.
[15:33.080 --> 15:39.960]  We have a sick world in violent, decadent decline where people are living in fantasy
[15:39.960 --> 15:45.200]  land watching TV on their smartphones, playing video games all day while the real world goes
[15:45.200 --> 15:46.200]  on around them.
[15:46.200 --> 15:51.200]  When we come back, the huge developments in the Middle East, the huge developments with
[15:51.200 --> 15:55.040]  the War Powers Act to make the president a military dictator.
[15:55.040 --> 15:57.600]  I'm not kidding.
[15:57.600 --> 15:59.640]  Make the choice for health and vitality.
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.800]  The Info Wars Life Winner Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[16:04.800 --> 16:09.480]  Winner Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.800]  Although there are many vitamin D3 supplements on the market, most are vitamin D2 which is
[16:13.800 --> 16:15.720]  inferior to vitamin D3.
[16:15.720 --> 16:20.360]  This need prompted our research journey to create the most powerful vitamin D3 product

[17:56.320 --> 18:01.800]  I love our kids, I love our kids, why, why, why?
[18:01.800 --> 18:07.240]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true nutraceutical
[18:07.240 --> 18:11.480]  formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[18:11.480 --> 18:16.560]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control, television, music, fast food, GMOs,
[18:16.560 --> 18:20.720]  sugar, you name it, young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are
[18:20.720 --> 18:24.120]  being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[18:24.120 --> 18:28.640]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[18:28.640 --> 18:29.640]  drugs.
[18:29.640 --> 18:33.560]  Working with my team, we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[18:33.560 --> 18:35.600]  that children would actually like and take.
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.160]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[18:39.160 --> 18:43.760]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing

[19:02.040 --> 19:03.040]  tell us what happened.
[19:03.040 --> 19:07.600]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[19:07.600 --> 19:08.920]  Talk about the effects.
[19:08.920 --> 19:10.560]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[19:10.560 --> 19:12.280]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[19:12.280 --> 19:13.480]  I feel like I look better.
[19:13.480 --> 19:14.480]  I feel better.
[19:14.480 --> 19:15.480]  I feel sexier.
[19:15.480 --> 19:16.480]  I love it.

[19:23.600 --> 19:24.600]  your physician.

[20:01.600 --> 20:11.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.160 --> 20:13.160]  You have the power.
[20:13.160 --> 20:14.160]  Humanity has the power.
[20:14.160 --> 20:15.160]  We have the power.
[20:15.160 --> 20:16.160]  Do you want to fight?
[20:16.160 --> 20:17.160]  Do you better believe?
[20:17.160 --> 20:18.160]  You got one.
[20:18.160 --> 20:26.520]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[20:26.520 --> 20:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[20:28.000 --> 20:37.960]  All right, now I want to be 100% crystal clear, not because of media criticism on this subject
[20:37.960 --> 20:44.760]  or media deception, but so the listeners understand because this is the key.
[20:44.760 --> 20:50.320]  They are not going to come out and announce martial law in Germany or in Switzerland or
[20:50.320 --> 20:55.040]  in the Netherlands or France or the United States or Canada or Australia.
[20:55.040 --> 21:03.160]  You're going to call it a state of emergency, a permanent state of emergency, a civil emergency.
[21:03.160 --> 21:05.960]  I have AP and AFP today.
[21:05.960 --> 21:10.160]  I'm going to be going over these in a moment where the French aren't allowed to demonstrate
[21:10.160 --> 21:16.120]  against the government on GMO, on open borders, on taxes.
[21:16.120 --> 21:18.520]  They're arresting people for their political speech.
[21:18.520 --> 21:23.960]  They've arrested now twice the leader of the main conservative party who is the leader
[21:23.960 --> 21:32.720]  in national election polls, Marie Le Pen, whose father almost became president.
[21:32.720 --> 21:37.400]  Now, that'd be like arresting Donald Trump for his statement about barring Muslims.
[21:37.400 --> 21:40.160]  He just said, we're under attack like World War II.
[21:40.160 --> 21:42.760]  They arrested her.
[21:42.760 --> 21:45.960]  She's facing several years in prison.
[21:45.960 --> 21:51.400]  Now I have in the Associated Press French saying, Hollande has made a permanent state
[21:51.400 --> 21:55.800]  of emergency, now they're making a financial emergency, and the tax collectors are just
[21:55.800 --> 21:58.720]  grabbing money out of bank accounts.
[21:58.720 --> 22:03.600]  That's always the real reason for the physical martial law is the financial.
[22:03.600 --> 22:11.720]  Germany and France are now under martial law, and they're organizing under EU edicts.
[22:11.720 --> 22:19.240]  A domestic EU police force nationalizing local police and federal police and codifying that
[22:19.240 --> 22:24.640]  you're not allowed to criticize Muslims, you see, they use that crisis to bring them in
[22:24.640 --> 22:26.640]  and then basically balkanize the country.
[22:26.640 --> 22:27.640]  I have all that.
[22:27.640 --> 22:29.200]  You say, but what does that have to do with America?
[22:29.200 --> 22:33.840]  It's the exact same thing, but it's done with just a straight face.
[22:33.840 --> 22:39.440]  There it is, Wall Street Journal, French president to seek extended emergency powers.
[22:39.440 --> 22:42.400]  Of course he is.
[22:42.400 --> 22:46.240]  And now he's done it.
[22:46.240 --> 22:49.600]  But he's arresting his political enemies.
[22:49.600 --> 22:56.920]  He brought in the radical Muslims when they attacked, he declared civil emergency.
[22:56.920 --> 23:03.440]  I don't have one, I don't have two, I don't have three, I have four articles here in my
[23:03.440 --> 23:13.480]  stack in the last week with calls for civil emergency to take the guns.
[23:13.480 --> 23:17.520]  Eat the press, CNN, you name it.
[23:17.520 --> 23:22.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, member Obama used to say, I'm not a dictator, I can't bypass Congress
[23:22.080 --> 23:23.640]  on borders and guns.
[23:23.640 --> 23:27.680]  He said that hundreds of times, and then now the last year he just goes, Congress didn't
[23:27.680 --> 23:30.320]  act on guns, they didn't get in line.
[23:30.320 --> 23:33.160]  That's a quote, I'm taking action.
[23:33.160 --> 23:37.600]  He told his constituents, I changed the law and open the borders when Congress didn't
[23:37.600 --> 23:38.600]  act.
[23:38.600 --> 23:39.760]  That's a quote.
[23:39.760 --> 23:49.360]  They have a name for that, so explain something, I'm not saying hot martial law is coming.
[23:49.360 --> 23:59.960]  I'm saying slow, creeping, lukewarm tyranny and martial law is already here by every single
[23:59.960 --> 24:07.240]  historical yardstick there is and major universities around the world admit the West is now totalitarian.
[24:07.240 --> 24:16.920]  But they leave the opposition still in place, they still have some of the window dressing.
[24:16.920 --> 24:17.920]  But we're here.
[24:17.920 --> 24:23.440]  So, let me explain something, martial law isn't coming, it's here, it's kind of like
[24:23.440 --> 24:30.000]  you put a turkey in the oven and turn it on to 350 and it's only heated up to like 200.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.640]  But the turkey's in the oven and it's heating up and it's cooking.
[24:32.640 --> 24:38.040]  The turkey's in the oven, the door was closed, the heat was turned up, it's going up right
[24:38.040 --> 24:41.080]  now, the mercury's rising.
[24:41.080 --> 24:46.000]  We got to get out of this pot because we're not a brainless, mindless, dead turkey, at
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  least yet.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.120]  So, the heat going, oh really, where's the tyranny, where's the arrest, where's the,
[24:52.120 --> 24:56.160]  I don't know, all these thousands of Christians persecuted by the IRS, I don't know, all these
[24:56.160 --> 25:00.280]  filmmakers and writers and governors being arrested, the Attorney General, totally
[25:00.280 --> 25:05.240]  upstanding record of Texas, sues Obama over open borders and gun control and they indict
[25:05.240 --> 25:06.240]  him.
[25:06.240 --> 25:11.840]  I mean, what are you talking about, where's the attacks?
[25:11.840 --> 25:16.440]  Obama had the FBI crawl through everything we've done for two years.
[25:16.440 --> 25:21.160]  The FBI wouldn't recommend indicting us for something, so Obama's shopping around every
[25:21.160 --> 25:22.160]  agency right now.
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.000]  I've confirmed that from the feds, face to face.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.160]  And you know how mad Obama is, let me tell you, when we go out to events to cover Hillary,
[25:31.160 --> 25:36.040]  the Secret Service sees us, completely leaves us alone and smiles at us because they know
[25:36.040 --> 25:38.240]  what's going on, they know what's happening as well.
[25:38.240 --> 25:42.440]  So, the good news is, the people in government realize there's a criminal takeover.
[25:42.440 --> 25:46.360]  They know more than the public.
[25:46.360 --> 25:51.600]  But let me tell you something, they're making their move.
[25:51.600 --> 26:00.600]  So, we know there's all these Rhino Republicans up there in Congress, like Mitch McConnell,
[26:00.600 --> 26:06.320]  from Kentucky, the senator, the leader of the Senate, and I covered this in emergency
[26:06.320 --> 26:09.520]  report Friday evening when I learned about it.
[26:09.520 --> 26:16.520]  It all sort of unfolding Thursday, but was in one publication until Friday.
[26:16.520 --> 26:26.400]  Each one, and I guess it was a Don Salazar that brought it to my attention, and it was
[26:26.400 --> 26:29.840]  mad out there as well.
[26:29.840 --> 26:36.640]  And you read it, and then you go to the actual authorization, it is insane.
[26:36.640 --> 26:40.480]  But it's so dry that you say, the president could use military force any time he wants
[26:40.480 --> 26:45.840]  anywhere, 360, anywhere in the world, any time, and Congress has nothing to say about
[26:45.840 --> 26:46.840]  it.
[26:46.840 --> 26:50.280]  Just like the last spending authorization they did, before, they just said 100 plus of them,
[26:50.280 --> 26:51.280]  but it was limited.
[26:51.280 --> 26:54.040]  This time, they just said, the president could spend any amount of money he wants, however
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.600]  he wants, in perpetuity, blank check, Congress signs over its authority.
[26:57.600 --> 27:03.360]  I mean, that's financial martial law, just like the financial emergency in France and
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.360]  in Europe.
[27:04.360 --> 27:05.360]  They just do whatever they want.
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.360]  It's a blank check.
[27:06.360 --> 27:10.560]  It's like, Obamacare just says, the government insurance companies can do whatever they want.
[27:10.560 --> 27:15.120]  I don't know how much worse it's going to get with what they actually do.
[27:15.120 --> 27:22.840]  But I know they have put on paper that they've got martial law in place in America.
[27:22.840 --> 27:26.280]  Congress seven years ago wouldn't vote to shut down 1,000 power plants.
[27:26.280 --> 27:28.640]  Obama just did it with executive action.
[27:28.640 --> 27:29.840]  Congress won't vote to take the guns.
[27:29.840 --> 27:32.720]  He's doing it with executive action.
[27:32.720 --> 27:38.120]  And they've got their talking heads all over TV saying, let's just go ahead and start taking
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.840]  these guns, and let's go ahead and have a civil war with these gun owners, and let's go ahead
[27:41.840 --> 27:45.240]  and just see if they try to fight us.
[27:45.240 --> 27:48.840]  These are crazy people.
[27:48.840 --> 27:53.440]  And crazy is, crazy does, just like Hitler, they're starting to fight with the Russians.
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.040]  I guess that's where every crazy dictator goes to get their ass kicked, is you just
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.520]  go start a fight with the Russians for no reason, and then they're over here starting
[28:00.520 --> 28:01.520]  all these wars.
[28:01.520 --> 28:05.840]  U.S. troops have gone back into Iraq, they're beefing them up in Afghanistan, and Joe Biden,
[28:05.840 --> 28:09.960]  I've got the clip comes out and says, we're going in with ground troops to Syria before
[28:09.960 --> 28:13.040]  the authorization is even passed.
[28:13.040 --> 28:17.320]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back and walk through all of this,
[28:17.320 --> 28:25.280]  but yeah, I'm not watching the New England Patriots versus the Denver Broncos.
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.920]  Right now, because I'm in the real world battling for the future of this country, all the average
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.640]  person is mesmerized in fantasy land, watching football and playing video games and drinking
[28:35.640 --> 28:36.640]  a 12 pack of beer.
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.480]  And hey, listen, if the country wasn't going down in flames, I'd be watching football
[28:40.480 --> 28:42.480]  playing video games and drinking a beer.
[28:42.480 --> 28:47.840]  But man, you don't play video games or watch football when you're on the deck of the Titanic,
[28:47.840 --> 28:50.520]  and it's listing and about to break in too.
[28:50.520 --> 29:19.840]  So keep watching football wars.com, stay with us.

[30:14.680 --> 30:43.640]  We'll see you in the next video.
[30:43.640 --> 31:12.040]  We'll see you in the next video.
[31:12.040 --> 31:41.840]  We'll see you in the next video.
[31:41.840 --> 32:08.240]  We'll see you in the next video.
[32:08.240 --> 32:13.440]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are

[33:02.160 --> 33:17.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.200 --> 33:25.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[33:25.760 --> 33:35.680]  So there's this process in history where countries get rid of their due process.
[33:35.680 --> 33:38.000]  And then suddenly you reach a flash point.
[33:38.000 --> 33:41.400]  It's like throwing paper in a fire, it doesn't burst in flames right away.
[33:41.400 --> 33:43.520]  And all of a sudden it just goes boom and explodes.
[33:43.520 --> 33:49.200]  But you look at the scale of time, a year, two years is like the blinking of an eye politically.
[33:49.200 --> 33:54.200]  We basically are bursting into flame right now.
[33:54.200 --> 34:01.520]  Across the board, every form of oppression and tyranny is just rearing its ugly head.
[34:01.520 --> 34:06.560]  There's a major revolution by the tyrants to seize control, to overturn due process,
[34:06.560 --> 34:11.560]  to overturn basic freedoms.
[34:11.560 --> 34:17.560]  And before I get to the Senate leader, surprises lawmakers with new ISIS war powers requests
[34:17.560 --> 34:23.240]  before I get to what's in that and how it ties into Biden, U.S. Turkey, ready for military
[34:23.240 --> 34:25.680]  solution in Syria, boots on the ground.
[34:25.680 --> 34:30.720]  Before I tie all this together and why it's such a big deal and just adds to the season
[34:30.720 --> 34:40.000]  of corruption we're in, I like Ted Cruz, we've interviewed him here, he is the guy behind
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.880]  the front runner, Donald Trump, those two are battling each other.
[34:42.880 --> 34:48.200]  But when I see a clip like the one that's premiering at infowars.com, sent to us by
[34:48.200 --> 34:52.200]  a listener and we checked out the providence of the clip, it's really not gotten any attention
[34:52.200 --> 34:56.560]  yet, it just broke at infowars.com, I am forced to cover it.
[34:56.560 --> 35:02.040]  Now it's my opinion that Cruz is joking around here, Arnold told Rolling Stone he wanted
[35:02.040 --> 35:09.920]  to be Hitler, wanted to be a dictator, admired tyrants, wanted to be bigger than Jesus, told
[35:09.920 --> 35:12.520]  filmmakers that as well with pumping iron.
[35:12.520 --> 35:15.960]  So with Schwarzenegger, we know his actions, we know he'd like to be a dictator, he's
[35:15.960 --> 35:23.760]  an SS officer, you know, the rest is history, but in the case of Ted Cruz, I mean, I want
[35:23.760 --> 35:26.080]  to see the full clips of this.
[35:26.080 --> 35:29.560]  But if you asked me when I wanted, when I was 18 years old, I wanted to run our family's
[35:29.560 --> 35:32.680]  ranch and be a cattle rancher and be an outdoorsman.
[35:32.680 --> 35:39.480]  I got involved in politics because they were trying to take our guns.
[35:39.480 --> 35:42.800]  And so I do find it very disturbing when you ask somebody, what do you want to be, what
[35:42.800 --> 35:46.400]  do you want to do, and you say, I want to rule the world and take over.
[35:46.400 --> 35:48.280]  You know, what do we want to do today, Pinky?
[35:48.280 --> 35:52.080]  Well, the same thing we do every day, take over the world or whatever that cartoon says.
[35:52.080 --> 35:56.760]  I've only seen it a few times like some big pink mouse or something.
[35:56.760 --> 36:02.000]  All I know is I don't want to take over the world and, you know, maybe super intelligent
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  people are like that.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.000]  I mean, I think I'm pretty smart.
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.320]  Ted Cruz, I'll tell you, is very smart.
[36:06.320 --> 36:11.400]  I've read his writings, I've watched him, you know, give filibusters.
[36:11.400 --> 36:15.640]  He's obviously in the top 1% of smartest people or less.
[36:15.640 --> 36:17.720]  And he's a constitutionalist on many fronts.
[36:17.720 --> 36:25.360]  He needs to explain this clip, though, because it's the exact type of stuff we're facing.
[36:25.360 --> 36:29.000]  Here I am talking about how we're having a dictatorship of the bureaucracy, the power
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  structures turning the presidency into a dictatorial office.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.640]  That's different than the president being a dictator and staying in office.
[36:35.640 --> 36:39.560]  We're just getting an imperial post that operates outside of the Constitution.
[36:39.560 --> 36:43.640]  And no one can deny that process is almost complete.
[36:43.640 --> 36:46.760]  You don't hear folks saying America's a free country anymore, do you?
[36:46.760 --> 36:52.680]  Oh, we give up our liberty for security, but you don't get security when you give up liberty.
[36:52.680 --> 36:55.720]  You get enslavement.
[36:55.720 --> 37:03.360]  So just to set the table here of where we are in this election, here's Ted Cruz talking
[37:03.360 --> 37:11.120]  about wanting to rule the world and be a dictator, video is up on infowars.com, then his father
[37:11.120 --> 37:18.280]  responds at the end in the same timeframe, I guess the same conference that folks have
[37:18.280 --> 37:23.560]  dug up, you know, Ted wants to rule the world, what do you think?
[37:23.560 --> 37:27.360]  And then Ted's father responds, well, I don't think he should end up ruling the world.
[37:27.360 --> 37:28.360]  Here's the clip.
[37:28.360 --> 37:36.120]  What I want to do in life, well, my aspiration is to, oh, I don't know, be in a teen tit film
[37:36.120 --> 37:41.120]  like that guy who played Horatio, you know, he was in Malibu, Bikini Beach Shop.
[37:41.120 --> 37:48.120]  Well, other than that, take over the world, world domination, rule everything, rich,
[37:48.120 --> 37:56.120]  powerful, that sort of stuff.
[37:56.120 --> 38:01.120]  Rich, powerful, take over everything, world domination.
[38:01.120 --> 38:02.120]  Ted Cruz, 2016.
[38:02.120 --> 38:04.720]  Cruz, you think Ted's going to rule the world one day?
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.120]  I hope not.
[38:08.120 --> 38:13.120]  That's his dad, Rafael Cruz, you know, because your son, can you really take over the world?
[38:13.120 --> 38:16.480]  Well, I hope not.
[38:16.480 --> 38:20.520]  So that's the Cuban refugee saying he hopes his son doesn't become a dictator.
[38:20.520 --> 38:27.640]  Obviously, we need to find out the full context of all of this, but it is really something
[38:27.640 --> 38:28.640]  else.
[38:28.640 --> 38:31.040]  And we'll go more into the context of that a little bit later.
[38:31.040 --> 38:34.880]  Let's go ahead and get into the real world stuff, not an 18-year-old Ted Cruz wanting
[38:34.880 --> 38:38.360]  to be world dictator, because, you know, obviously, Bill Clinton's lined up for that job.
[38:38.360 --> 38:42.280]  If Hillary can get in as president, she wants to make him Secretary General.
[38:42.280 --> 38:43.880]  Let's get into what's currently happening.
[38:43.880 --> 38:45.800]  This is from Defense 1.
[38:45.800 --> 38:52.840]  On Thursday, Senate leaders surprised lawmakers with new ISIS war powers request.
[38:52.840 --> 38:59.680]  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered members a snow weekend surprise, quietly teeing
[38:59.680 --> 39:06.520]  up a debate on legal underpinning of the fight against ISIS, which means war powers, who
[39:06.520 --> 39:09.080]  commands the military, who gives the war authorization.
[39:09.080 --> 39:12.680]  After months of worrying that such a resolution such as the authorization of military force
[39:12.680 --> 39:15.880]  would tie the next president's hands, I love that spin.
[39:15.880 --> 39:18.560]  They already gave the president incredible powers.
[39:18.560 --> 39:21.320]  So McConnell's answers just give him unlimited.
[39:21.320 --> 39:26.080]  McConnell moved to fast-track the measure, surprised even his top deputy, Senate Majority
[39:26.080 --> 39:32.800]  Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who was unaware that McConnell had set up the authorization.
[39:32.800 --> 39:37.360]  He did, Cornyn asked National Journal on Thursday morning.
[39:37.360 --> 39:42.760]  The AUMF, hooked forward by McConnell, would not restrict the president's use of ground
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.560]  troops, nor have any limits related to time or geography, nor would it touch on the issue
[39:47.560 --> 39:53.080]  of what to do with the 2001 AUMF, which the Obama administration has used to attack ISIS
[39:53.080 --> 39:57.600]  despite the authorization's instructions to use force against those who plan the 9-11
[39:57.600 --> 39:58.600]  terrorist attacks.
[39:58.600 --> 40:02.200]  By contrast, the legal authority put forward by the administration last February wouldn't
[40:02.200 --> 40:06.200]  authorize him during offensive ground combat operations and would have ended three years
[40:06.200 --> 40:09.760]  after enactment unless reauthorized.
[40:09.760 --> 40:13.720]  And then it goes on, Lindsey Graham and others that co-sponsored him.
[40:13.720 --> 40:18.080]  There's never been a war resolution in this country's history, saying anywhere, anytime,
[40:18.080 --> 40:23.320]  in the future, including America, do whatever you want, don't even come to us, just like
[40:23.320 --> 40:27.920]  the authorization on the debt ceiling being raised.
[40:27.920 --> 40:34.000]  They just said, you know what, unlimited, don't have to come back, you're done, boom.
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.080]  They're just signing over their authority left and right.
[40:37.080 --> 40:39.280]  Am I saying this is imminent?
[40:39.280 --> 40:40.280]  Announcement of martial law?
[40:40.280 --> 40:43.040]  No, because we're already in it, folks.
[40:43.040 --> 40:47.360]  It's just more now of Congress signing away its authority to an executive, so the next
[40:47.360 --> 40:50.360]  executive can come in and do whatever they want, whoever that is.
[40:50.360 --> 40:52.080]  This is craziness.
[40:52.080 --> 40:56.440]  You can go back to the original article.
[40:56.440 --> 40:59.640]  This is back on the 10th of this month.
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.000]  Mitch McConnell makes clear that he wouldn't authorize war under Obama.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.880]  Look, I don't want to tie the hands of the next president.
[41:05.880 --> 41:09.800]  The next president may want to actually defeat ISIS, and I think the AUMF authorization,
[41:09.800 --> 41:14.680]  he's military force, the ties of the president's hands behind his back is not something I would
[41:14.680 --> 41:18.680]  want to do to a new president who's going to have to clean up this mess created by all
[41:18.680 --> 41:22.040]  of his passivity over the last eight years.
[41:22.040 --> 41:23.040]  What spin?
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.680]  They give the president unlimited military power compared to previous ones.
[41:27.680 --> 41:31.200]  And then they claim we've got to give the president even more power because Obama hadn't
[41:31.200 --> 41:36.480]  done his job arming, supporting ISIS in al-Qaeda, and the neocons all know that they're knee-deep
[41:36.480 --> 41:38.840]  in it as well.
[41:38.840 --> 41:41.360]  Incredible is the answer to that.
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.280]  And then they come out with this military authorization to just basically make the president
[41:45.280 --> 41:50.720]  a military dictator and say that's to beat ISIS when you could have said ground troops
[41:50.720 --> 41:57.120]  or whatever, but again, ground troops will mean absolutely devastating civil war with
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.320]  thousands of U.S. troops being killed to back the rebels that are 90% al-Qaeda, al-Nusra,
[42:02.320 --> 42:07.720]  and ISIS, while hobbyist, and our own military is an open revolt against that.
[42:07.720 --> 42:10.640]  We're going to go to break.
[42:10.640 --> 42:16.240]  When we come back, I'm going to walk through more of this, but you can see what they're
[42:16.240 --> 42:17.840]  doing here, folks.
[42:17.840 --> 42:21.200]  You can see how they're laying the groundwork for all of it.
[42:21.200 --> 42:26.320]  And now when we come back, they've got Russian and Turkish troops who are NATO wind up against
[42:26.320 --> 42:31.280]  each other, and mainstream media admits it's a huge escalation in a proxy war with Russia
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.880]  that's in its own backyard trying to stop radical Islamists who've been attacking Russia.
[42:35.880 --> 42:42.920]  And again, Russia's not some lion, panacea, perfect, you know, angel here, but Russia
[42:42.920 --> 42:44.000]  didn't start this.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.440]  And our government with Saudi Arabia is running ISIS, and they want to send in U.S. forces
[42:49.440 --> 42:57.400]  to the rescue against Assad and think you're so dumb, they claim it's against ISIS.
[42:57.400 --> 43:00.880]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[43:00.880 --> 43:06.080]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[43:06.080 --> 43:09.280]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[43:09.280 --> 43:14.520]  Just one of the key compounds, BiOPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[47:02.160 --> 47:20.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:20.240 --> 47:32.280]  Here's the really big question I'm asking.
[47:32.280 --> 47:36.640]  Why are governments all over the world, arming themselves against their local populations?
[47:36.640 --> 47:38.040]  Why are governments digging in?
[47:38.040 --> 47:42.400]  Why are they getting armored vehicles for the first time in modern history and setting
[47:42.400 --> 47:43.960]  us for civil unrest?
[47:43.960 --> 47:50.520]  Why are elites moving to armored redoubts, armored fortresses, and in offshore floating
[47:50.520 --> 47:51.520]  islands?
[47:51.520 --> 47:57.440]  Well, they tell us it's to get away from worldwide collapse.
[47:57.440 --> 48:00.960]  And then we cover it, and they have the New York Times and others say, we're fear porn
[48:00.960 --> 48:02.720]  dealers and that nothing's going to happen.
[48:02.720 --> 48:05.760]  I hope nothing happens.
[48:05.760 --> 48:11.280]  But you see the establishment gearing up for all this and passing civil emergency legislation
[48:11.280 --> 48:16.320]  all over the world, and things are deteriorating quickly.
[48:16.320 --> 48:23.920]  So I want to ask former military, current military, citizens, constitutional lawyers,
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.840]  others, first-time callers as well.
[48:28.840 --> 48:34.720]  Am I wrong in being concerned about the most open-ended military authorization ever?
[48:34.720 --> 48:38.360]  They're trying to hand Obama?
[48:38.360 --> 48:39.360]  That's how the double think works.
[48:39.360 --> 48:44.120]  They give him huge, wide-open, open-ended powers, and they go, those aren't strong enough.
[48:44.120 --> 48:47.640]  We're not going to tie president's hands because you won't do anything about ISIS when he's
[48:47.640 --> 48:48.640]  already authorized.
[48:48.640 --> 48:52.240]  We're just going to give you in perpetuity total control to do whatever you want and
[48:52.240 --> 48:58.640]  make the president a dictator when it comes to military force.
[48:58.640 --> 49:02.040]  That's how you move the Overton window.
[49:02.040 --> 49:06.640]  It's like, you know, we're not going to let this robber steal $5 million from the bank.
[49:06.640 --> 49:08.960]  We're going to let him steal $50 million.
[49:08.960 --> 49:15.600]  That'll show him, and it just fits into the open borders by executive power, coming after
[49:15.600 --> 49:17.960]  the guns by executive power.
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.440]  But it's how these lawyers spin it, like it's no big deal.
[49:23.440 --> 49:28.360]  It's like Obama came out and said, my executive order is non-binding and advisory only on
[49:28.360 --> 49:32.080]  how we're just going to put people on a no-gun buy list who have no criminal record.
[49:32.080 --> 49:35.520]  And lawyers were on TV going, that's really smart because he doesn't have the authority.
[49:35.520 --> 49:40.800]  He just says it's an advisement, but they're ordering the FBI to do it, which is real.
[49:40.800 --> 49:46.440]  You think it's real when Obama advises ICE to let the illegals come in, put them on buses,
[49:46.440 --> 49:49.280]  give them vouchers, ship them in?
[49:49.280 --> 49:54.320]  Oh, the president doesn't have the power to shut down coal power plants.
[49:54.320 --> 49:58.640]  He just orders the EPA to do it.
[49:58.640 --> 50:04.840]  Well, you know, when Hitler ordered that attack on Russia, it was advisory.
[50:04.840 --> 50:09.440]  So the generals didn't really follow orders, they just did what they thought was advisory.
[50:09.440 --> 50:16.400]  No, folks, it's dictatorship with some weird little legalese added on to say, well, we
[50:16.400 --> 50:22.960]  didn't really mean it, but we're doing it.
[50:22.960 --> 50:27.960]  And then we get to this.
[50:27.960 --> 50:31.600]  This is military authorization to go into Syria like they tried three years ago in our
[50:31.600 --> 50:36.960]  own military, our own chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Dempsey at the time who's left
[50:36.960 --> 50:37.960]  now retired.
[50:37.960 --> 50:38.960]  So notice it's a home of their ballgame.
[50:38.960 --> 50:42.440]  He went to the White House and he said the military will not file a side of al-Qaeda.
[50:42.440 --> 50:43.640]  That's who you're turning Syria over to.
[50:43.640 --> 50:44.640]  This is immoral.
[50:44.640 --> 50:45.760]  Syria didn't attack us.
[50:45.760 --> 50:46.760]  We're not doing it.
[50:46.760 --> 50:50.960]  I told you that first, it came out in the news a year later.
[50:50.960 --> 51:00.240]  Rand Paul came out and said we're not al-Qaeda's air force, so did Ted Cruz, who was credit.
[51:00.240 --> 51:05.680]  And now, bipartisanly, we hear U.S. Turkey ready for military solution in Syria.
[51:05.680 --> 51:08.760]  Geneva peace talks postpones destined to failure.
[51:08.760 --> 51:12.560]  Biden has announced.
[51:12.560 --> 51:16.120]  Here's another one.
[51:16.120 --> 51:18.840]  America and Turkey begin ground invasion of Syria.
[51:18.840 --> 51:21.320]  How will Russia respond?
[51:21.320 --> 51:27.840]  That's the Associated Press announcement by AFRICOM and U.S. CENTCOM.
[51:27.840 --> 51:32.840]  In Syria escalates as Russia and U.S. establish air bases along Turkish borders, significant
[51:32.840 --> 51:38.440]  developments out of peace talks that have now been canceled, and it goes into the forces
[51:38.440 --> 51:44.480]  lining up against each other on the border.
[51:44.480 --> 51:52.120]  WikiLeaks cables portray Saudi Arabia as a cash machine for terrorists, and meanwhile
[51:52.120 --> 51:54.960]  they're giving authorization for boots on the ground.
[51:54.960 --> 51:59.360]  Syria and U.S. troops have gone into Iraq now.
[51:59.360 --> 52:03.000]  Here's zero hedges article on it.
[52:03.000 --> 52:13.760]  Mitch McConnell moves to grant the president unlimited war powers with no expiration date.
[52:13.760 --> 52:18.320]  The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products
[52:18.320 --> 52:19.320]  of human labor.
[52:19.320 --> 52:24.440]  Orders a way of shattering to pieces or pouring into the stratosphere or sinking into the
[52:24.440 --> 52:28.920]  depths of the sea materials, which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,
[52:28.920 --> 52:34.600]  and hence, in the long run, too intelligent, George Arwell.
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.400]  This was a Pentagon mole sending U.S. troops to Iraq.
[52:39.400 --> 52:40.520]  That was two days ago.
[52:40.520 --> 52:41.520]  They'd already done it.
[52:41.520 --> 52:47.720]  Here's AP and the military times.
[52:47.720 --> 52:52.040]  Hundreds more U.S. troops may go to Iraq, but they already sent a whole bunch.
[52:52.040 --> 52:53.040]  Here's another one.
[52:53.040 --> 52:56.760]  The power is given to Barack Obama authority over just about everything during a major
[52:56.760 --> 52:59.080]  national crisis.
[52:59.080 --> 53:00.320]  Remember this CNN op-ed?
[53:00.320 --> 53:02.560]  Can we queue up the Bernie Sanders on the gun grabbing please?
[53:02.560 --> 53:03.560]  Thank you.
[53:03.560 --> 53:08.000]  CNN op-ed calls for Obama to declare national safe emergency to gut second amendment.
[53:08.000 --> 53:14.560]  CNN calls for them to use civil emergency to take the guns.
[53:14.560 --> 53:20.560]  Oh, here's AFP.
[53:20.560 --> 53:21.560]  Disquiet.
[53:21.560 --> 53:22.560]  That's French news agency.
[53:22.560 --> 53:23.560]  Disquiet.
[53:23.560 --> 53:24.560]  Oh, they're concerned.
[53:24.560 --> 53:26.560]  Grows over French state of emergency.
[53:26.560 --> 53:32.120]  When a state of emergency was imposed in France after the November attacks, numb with terror
[53:32.120 --> 53:37.720]  wear, citizens welcomed the show of force, but a sense of creeping unease over civil
[53:37.720 --> 53:43.120]  liberties has turned to outright opposition in many quarters as French President Hollande
[53:43.120 --> 53:48.760]  indicated this week that he would seek to renew the measures for another three months
[53:48.760 --> 53:53.720]  and has already declared civil emergency over the money.
[53:53.720 --> 53:55.240]  I'm going to stop there.
[53:55.240 --> 53:58.760]  We got all the civil emergency talk.
[53:58.760 --> 54:01.760]  Just have the president declare a civil emergency.
[54:01.760 --> 54:03.000]  Well, they've already done it.
[54:03.000 --> 54:08.000]  They're already acting under executive fiat and they're not getting in trouble.
[54:08.000 --> 54:11.640]  The Republicans are handing him more power because they work for the very same special
[54:11.640 --> 54:18.600]  interest and it's that illusion of fighting that's creating the fact that people are
[54:18.600 --> 54:19.600]  fighting.
[54:19.600 --> 54:20.600]  Look at this.
[54:20.600 --> 54:23.800]  Bernie Sanders calls for the Talitarian gun confiscations.
[54:23.800 --> 54:26.520]  Sanders will ban guns that are primarily quote designed to kill people.
[54:26.520 --> 54:27.520]  That's all guns.
[54:27.520 --> 54:29.320]  It's not about hunting Sanders.
[54:29.320 --> 54:31.600]  This is the old way to ban it like they've done in Europe.
[54:31.600 --> 54:33.280]  Oh, stuff they could kill cops.
[54:33.280 --> 54:36.800]  Well, that's any bullets and anything that's semi auto.
[54:36.800 --> 54:39.600]  Let's go to this clip from him on NBC's meet the press.
[54:39.600 --> 54:41.320]  This video is on info wars.com.
[54:41.320 --> 54:42.800]  Here it is.
[54:42.800 --> 54:47.800]  What I said several months ago, having a D minus voting record from the NRA having voted
[54:47.800 --> 54:50.960]  to ban assault weapons way back in 1988.
[54:50.960 --> 54:54.480]  Yeah, that was a piece of legislation that I wanted to relook at.
[54:54.480 --> 55:00.200]  And what that legislation had among other things is a prohibition on armor piercing ammunition
[55:00.200 --> 55:02.160]  designed to kill police officers.
[55:02.160 --> 55:07.200]  It had language in it for a child lock safety for our kids.
[55:07.200 --> 55:08.200]  Important provision.
[55:08.200 --> 55:11.520]  Not your kids turn it that I did not like and I was willing to rethink.
[55:11.520 --> 55:12.520]  We have reformed it.
[55:12.520 --> 55:13.520]  There's a bill apparently.
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.280]  I like that bill, it makes some good changes and we will be supportive of it.
[55:18.280 --> 55:19.280]  Make some good changes.
[55:19.280 --> 55:22.000]  Strongly in an instant background check.
[55:22.000 --> 55:23.600]  I think we have to expand it.
[55:23.600 --> 55:29.800]  I think we have to make sure 100% that we keep guns out of the hands of people who should
[55:29.800 --> 55:35.160]  not have that people with criminal backgrounds, people who are mentally unstable has been
[55:35.160 --> 55:36.160]  my view.
[55:36.160 --> 55:38.160]  That's enough.
[55:38.160 --> 55:45.280]  Again, Bernie Sanders talks about wealth redistribution all day and the more liberalism
[55:45.280 --> 55:50.960]  we get, the more government we get, the less middle class there is and it's the big mega
[55:50.960 --> 55:55.280]  rich that are funding people like him and Hillary and others because they want a big
[55:55.280 --> 55:57.360]  domesticated dumb down population.
[55:57.360 --> 55:59.160]  It's so simple.
[55:59.160 --> 56:03.360]  Socialism and communism always creates a total train wreck disaster but you've got the same
[56:03.360 --> 56:07.880]  dumb down idiots that want to get two, three college degrees to get jobs that didn't exist.
[56:07.880 --> 56:11.240]  They're lined up to him wanting everything free.
[56:11.240 --> 56:14.040]  Just like Obamacare was supposed to be free.
[56:14.040 --> 56:20.880]  Now Sanders is promising some free healthcare.
[56:20.880 --> 56:21.960]  It's a fixed system.
[56:21.960 --> 56:23.840]  The bigger the system gets, the more it gets fixed.
[56:23.840 --> 56:25.520]  You have a small government, you have prosperity.
[56:25.520 --> 56:27.880]  You have a big government, you get a screw job.
[56:27.880 --> 56:28.880]  That's history.
[56:28.880 --> 56:30.760]  But you folks don't want to admit that.
[56:30.760 --> 56:36.880]  That is the socialist useful idiots out there.
[56:36.880 --> 56:40.920]  We're going to come back and take your phone calls and get into a ton of other really important
[56:40.920 --> 56:42.200]  news items the next hour.
[56:42.200 --> 56:43.840]  The Sunday phone number is a little different.
[56:43.840 --> 56:46.360]  I want to hear from military, police, first time callers.
[56:46.360 --> 56:49.720]  What do you think about this process in the tyranny we're seeing?
[56:49.720 --> 56:58.400]  The number is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.

[59:51.680 --> 01:00:01.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:07.960]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:14.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.600]  Do you hear that?
[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:20.800]  That's Europe being flushed down the giant toilet in the House of Globalism.
[01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:26.120]  George Soros, one of the main plumbers responsible for the leaking pipes of Europe, is declaring
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:30.920]  to the public like the proud Black Lives Matter funding billionaire criminal he is, that
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.040]  the EU is on the verge of collapse.
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:41.240]  While the Dutch Prime Minister says, and let me be clear, the current numbers are not sustainable.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.720]  We are running out of time.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:50.440]  We need a sharp reduction in the number of refugees in the coming six to eight weeks.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:56.360]  The UK's Express reports frustrated female refugee center workers who welcome the refugees
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.040]  with open arms and compassion are on the verge of quitting after regularly being sexually
[01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:08.920]  assaulted and even threatened with decapitation by a wave of 25-year-old male refugees.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.520]  Meanwhile, the ungrateful invaders are now suing the German government, complaining that
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.960]  the asylum process is taking too long.
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:21.960]  Some European countries are beginning to fight back, as Denmark is considering moving
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:25.600]  the refugees to camps outside the cities.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.120]  While a wave of derelicts dubbed rape fugees victimized record numbers of women and children
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.720]  across Eurasia, but in Sweden where the rape epidemic in particular is exploding, Sweden
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:43.520]  is funding a sniper training course for recently arrived third world refugees as part of their
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.520]  integration program.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:50.960]  Despite the ever-growing refugee terrorist attacks across Europe, the sniping course
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:57.560]  began on a small scale in the fall, interest exploded among the non-white invaders to take
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.960]  the course.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.760]  Sweden has officially lost its collectivized mind.
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:08.560]  And where does the Obama administration stand on the preparedness of the inevitable confrontations
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.400]  within the United States?
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.240]  The Washington Examiner reports, a pair of Department of Homeland Security officials
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.040]  told the Senate on Wednesday that the government does not search for most of the people who
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:26.840]  overstayed their temporary visas, a day after DHS said that nearly 500,000 people were still
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.840]  in the United States after having overstayed their visas last year.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:38.120]  Those DHS officials had to testify because the DHS has failed miserably in an attempt
[01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:43.640]  to implement a biometric refugee tracking system that was supposed to be up and running
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:48.960]  over 10 years ago, as required by law in 2004.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:54.000]  The Washington Free Beacon reports, senior Obama administration officials had trouble
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.160]  in the past year informing Congress about the number of individuals who had overstayed
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.160]  their visas.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.600]  The administration also could not provide Congress with statistics about the number
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:10.160]  of Syrian refugees who had been granted residency in the United States in 2015.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:17.040]  There are currently 1,000 open investigations into ISIS members in the United States right
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.280]  now.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.840]  And that number is trivial.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:26.920]  The investigations of 113 of those foreign-born individuals with terror charges have been blocked
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.760]  by the Obama administration since 2014.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.520]  So, America, can I ask you a question?
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:40.040]  What are you going to do when and if the rape of your sister, mother, wife, or girlfriend
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:45.840]  by Middle Eastern refugees starts happening in your town, John Bowne, for Enforce.com.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:51.280]  But folks, I want to explain something here, okay?
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:04:01.120]  Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa, like Libya or Jordan or even Egypt,
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:05.280]  raping women is not put up with, and women do get suppressed some, do have some of their
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:09.960]  rights taken and I'm against it, but they get to go to college and they get to drive
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:14.760]  cars and they get to run things and be doctors and lawyers, and they don't put up with it.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:20.920]  But if you talk about Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and other places, women are literally lower
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:22.640]  than animals.
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.080]  They lock them up, basically.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.080]  They beat them up.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.040]  They can kill them whenever they want.
[01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.920]  And you take the low classes out of Saudi Arabia and other areas.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:34.680]  These are people, the Saudi Arabia is basically kicked out into Syria.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:37.680]  This is like the hillbillies of the Saudi Arabians and people.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:41.720]  And you put them into Europe with all the super, you know, liberal trendies and stuff.
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:44.080]  I mean, it's explosive mixture.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.760]  And it is going on.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.400]  And they just treat women like dirt.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.480]  I mean, it's a fact, folks.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:53.360]  It is a fact that it's just crazy that the left is into this.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:05:23.320]  These are sick people.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:34.520]  We�re introducing the best yet, the brand new ProPure ProMax high-performance shower

[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:35.040]  Jones ladies and gentlemen there's a big fight brewing and info wars.com and
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:41.520]  present planet.com right now it only went up about 40 minutes ago and people
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:47.240]  are upset hundreds of comments they're saying why is info wars posting a video
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.600]  of Ted Cruz saying he wants to be world dictator when he was 18 others saying
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:07:00.120]  don't defend Ted Cruz how dare you Donald Trump your scum listen I went and
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.800]  looked at major news sites today and nobody had this which makes it even
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:10.920]  more of a responsibility that we posted I like Ted Cruz I'd be happy with him
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:16.680]  or Donald Trump I'm on record about that they're a trillion times better than
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:22.560]  Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders but if you got a video of Ted Cruz talking
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.400]  about being a dictator and his dad responding to it saying it's not good
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:32.200]  we're not gonna not post it I mean I when I saw it when Nico told me about it
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.720]  this you know this morning and I said or this afternoon I said is it on other
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:43.600]  sites is it out there and he said no because if it was on 50 sites I probably
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.800]  wouldn't have posted it because it's already out there it's because it wasn't
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:52.360]  out there that I have a responsibility to put it up you know sometimes there's
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:57.080]  bad examples of gun owners doing bad things and we will post the article
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.680]  because we'll also then say statistically gun crimes dropping but
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.840]  there's still some bad uses of guns but you know just like there are butcher
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:10.120]  knives we really try to have a real intellectual argument because the
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.960]  minute I start becoming delusional the minute I start tailoring information to
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.960]  what I want to believe in self-censoring we're done we're done I believe in the
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.440]  Second Amendment because we fought a revolution to create it every other
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:31.680]  country's basically been disarmed I know the elite want to take our guns to
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.000]  enslave us it doesn't mean there aren't problems with guns there doesn't mean
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.720]  there aren't bad things happening with them still statistically it's very very
[01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:42.960]  rare compared to drowning or dying in a car wreck or cancer being you know
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:49.440]  whatever still the point is they want our guns to enslave us and their
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:52.480]  arguments about wanting to keep us safe aren't the real reason they're doing it
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:56.560]  and so we've had a political and social and cultural break with the
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:03.200]  establishment because we know the social contract has been severed we have an
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.480]  elite that want to conquer us and have it out for us and are cold-blooded and
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.120]  are doing horrible things all over the world
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:18.160]  Chris Shane Dwayne James Ryan Kevin Dwayne Steve and others we're gonna go to
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:26.880]  all of you we're gonna all of you right now and then I'm going to get more into
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.560]  Bloomberg sensing an opening looks to run for the White House New York Times
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:35.240]  Hillary is on the verge of being indicted that's being reported it may
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:39.640]  actually happen the signs are there
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:49.480]  Trump comes out and says black people elect me and I'll actually come speak
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.560]  in your neighborhoods and I'll try to get make-work projects and I'll try to get
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:59.040]  your wages up Obama's doubled your unemployment I will actually pay
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.880]  attention to you because I don't take you for granted
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:08.040]  absolutely in business and life you want to go do deals with who really needs
[01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:11.400]  you the most not with who doesn't need you I mean you know there's a lot of
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.280]  common sense stuff here and num and poll numbers show that 20% of Democrats
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.960]  saying they're gonna vote Trump which will make him beat Hillary right now in
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:24.000]  Gallup bunch of them like something like 7% of that is black of the 20 so like
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.200]  almost a third of it or more that's exciting and it doesn't mean Trump's
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:35.560]  perfect or we can totally trust him it's just that we know Hillary's bad we
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.840]  know Jeb Bush is bad so I'm gonna get to all that I'm gonna get to a very
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:45.720]  interesting article that ties into our major problems we face a drug to cure
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:50.200]  fear the New York Times reports kind of like that scientist Nica pointed out that
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:56.400]  was studying the woman who didn't feel pain I'm gonna get more into it but you
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.400]  need pain to know when something's burning your hand or to know when you're
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:07.880]  got a gallstone or you know whatever the case is or when your leg is sprained
[01:11:07.880 --> 01:11:14.680]  don't walk on a lead heel just like you need fear it's fear and adrenaline in a
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:23.880]  fight that makes you win that that makes your senses hone I mean I've been in
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:28.920]  situations before growing up in Dallas where they were life-threatening I'm
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.040]  just gonna leave it that because it's just reality stranger than fiction I'm
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:35.720]  not gonna get into some of the stories but when somebody pulls out a butcher
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:41.960]  knife on you at a 7-eleven parking lot and comes at you with it everything goes
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:51.640]  in a slow motion and you get real strong and when that person's on the ground and
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:55.680]  been disarmed and stomped and you're just waiting with the ambulance to get
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:01.040]  there you're so alive it's incredible and let me tell you it's addicting that's
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.280]  what people become police officers or soldiers they've experienced that they
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.800]  wanted again and again and again I've never been more alive than when
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.880]  somebody's coming in with a butcher knife and actually you're fighting with
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:16.120]  them on the ground that butcher knife starts getting driven down into your
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.440]  shoulder about an inch you gonna find some strength you didn't know you had
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:31.800]  fear control become strength that's now shown quote and everything I do what
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:37.000]  we've been able to build is because 21 years ago I saw the threat to human
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.840]  liberty and I took action and built one of the most powerful independent media
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:48.200]  operations in the world thanks to your support and the reason I tell that story
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:52.880]  is because you're not supposed to have fear and go cower in the corner you're
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:59.480]  supposed to have fear and take action and turn that fear into will fear and
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.880]  courage are about one millimeter away from each other just like love and hate

[01:20:45.280 --> 01:21:13.840]  the answer to 1984 you know I'll be pretty honest with you I'm proud of the fact
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.040]  that I don't even know what the next playoff is or who's playing who or what's
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:23.280]  going on I just know about legislation and world events and what ice the cells
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:29.760]  are doing in America but New England's losing 12 to Denver at 20 that's what's
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.360]  really important right folks and a lot of people have supposedly piled their
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:37.800]  money up on the Patriots in Vegas but looks like that's not going too well in
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:47.000]  the AFC championship game right now though let's go ahead and go to your
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.440]  phone calls here as promised who's up first here guys all right let's go to
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:22:02.920]  James in South Carolina you're on the air hello go ahead hey Alex first off
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.920]  kudos on playing the video of crews I wouldn't expect anything less of info
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:15.960]  wars second off speaking of these ISIS terror cells isn't that what Obama's
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:21.520]  got up his sleeve here well I mean with this legislation they're trying to get
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:26.600]  through yeah they're trying to pass legislation to make the presidency be
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.560]  able to use the military anywhere they want in the world anytime including
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:34.960]  boots on the ground major war without congressional authorization saying it's
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:40.360]  no big deal but they've never done it in 240 years of US history that's admitted
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:46.440]  in the news articles but it's no big deal and on top of that to fight an
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:52.080]  enemy our government and NATO and Saudi Arabia and Turkey admittedly have been
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:57.360]  arming and protecting even Donald Trump's talking about it so wow talk about
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:01.840]  a false flag the jihadi radical Islamists terrorists are real but the
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:05.200]  fact that they're being protected and let in is the false flag and look at
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:10.640]  Europe declared civil emergency martial law after the jihad attacks that they
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:16.280]  brought in it's pretty simple isn't it yeah it's pretty easy to see and Alex
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:21.160]  you always talk about how the elite are bunkering down and and a lot of people
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.840]  don't understand this but you don't have to be rich to bunker down people need
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:33.080]  to look up car people look up adobe super adobe you can build a bunker for
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:38.880]  penny I just built one my girlfriend built it I'm disabled I've got to crush
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:44.200]  vertebrae in my bag she built this thing with her bare hands 24 inch walls
[01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:48.320]  bulletproof fireproof storm and again if nothing bad comes or happens that's
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:51.880]  great it just improves the value of your own property they have quote a storm
[01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.040]  cellar out in the back under a fake you know tree trunk that you lift up and you
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:23:59.840]  go down in there and play poker or whatever absolutely that's what it's
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:04.240]  all about and you know folks used to have their own storm cellars for for
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:08.040]  tornado alley now they just wait in the house and dive with a tornado and it
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:11.240]  goes because it's kooky and weird to have your own storm shelter but you're
[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:15.440]  absolutely right the elite are moving to rural areas saying they believe a
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:19.160]  global collapse is coming that's a canary in the coal mine we appreciate your
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.280]  call great points all right who should I go to next year because I know there's
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.480]  so many callers I can't remember who's been in holding longer all right Ryan in

[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:41.280]  call you're on here hey I just wanted to manage you for the courage that you
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:46.880]  have because I know a lot of people are you know probably thinking very bad
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.160]  things about you right now and again the courage hats off to you the biggest
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:55.720]  thing that you talked about is what are we doing about this news you're telling
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:25:01.120]  us and I am trying to do things about it I just I want to ask you what is the
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:06.600]  best way to talk about this to my friends and family without them thinking
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.840]  that I'm kind of a nut you know or some kind of a famous salesman once said the
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.120]  hardest person to sells your friends and family they have disrespect for
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.720]  themselves and who they are subconsciously so if you're associated
[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:24.160]  with them because they hate themselves they won't want to listen to you it's
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.200]  the same statement of profits not known in his own country I would go to city
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.760]  council and speak about these issues boldly and confidently I would do your
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.960]  own access show call into radio start your own newsletter become a leader even
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:42.880]  in small ways and then your friends and family will listen I would send them a
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:47.600]  video of this call you know it'll be on YouTube tonight and say you know how to
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.760]  wake up your friends and family the tyranny well that's what we'll call
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:53.760]  this and send it to them and say hey even constitutional lawyers say we're
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:57.640]  going into tyranny we've been signed on to debts that are impossible to pay the
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:26:01.160]  president's being given dictatorial power this is all happening because
[01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:05.400]  Americans think of themselves as jellyfish that aren't politically involved
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.840]  I bless you and I appreciate your call that's what I would do it's not your job
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.000]  to save the world it's just your job to be involved and doing the right thing if
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.560]  more people just hit a little bit many hands make light work we wouldn't be in
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:22.600]  this position but there's such political illiteracy I saw a university study out
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:28.000]  last week where 10% of college seniors think judge Judy's on the Supreme Court
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.120]  something like 80% of people on average in college don't know the three branches
[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.920]  of government and then when they hear somebody that's informed they just go
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:39.800]  conspiracy theory not because they actually look down on you they're feel
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:45.720]  scared that you even have language skills yeah it's 10% of college grads
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:49.880]  think judge Judy is on the Supreme Court 59% of college students surveyed
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:56.000]  believe the father of the Constitution was Thomas Jefferson well that's pretty
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.280]  good because he was the father of the Declaration of Independence and he had a
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.040]  hand in the Constitution cabinet in Colorado you're on the air thanks for
[01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:11.000]  holding welcome what's up Alex I just want to salute you for what you do
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.320]  because I'm straight out of Dallas Texas just like you are so I know I
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.120]  understand how it is down there the way you talk about you know growing up and
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.800]  stuff my parents are about the same age as you and except they didn't really
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:27.880]  understand what was going on so they didn't inform me as I grew up so one day
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:31.680]  I just stumbled across your show and you basically woke me up so I thank you for
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:36.720]  that well God bless you my friend and hats off to you what's on your mind well
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.880]  first off I want to about that Ted Cruz video I mean people need to understand
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:46.800]  info was is going to cover any candidate no matter what they're doing even if
[01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:51.240]  it's someone like Rand Paul if you were to do something wrong you guys are
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.320]  going to cover it because that's what y'all do you know y'all exposed to the
[01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:59.040]  y'all school the truth so people need to get over that fact absolutely even when
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.040]  I make a mistake I try to get up here and talk about it because because it's
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:07.080]  that transparency and genuineness that's all we got and I don't I think he was
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.360]  probably joking almost with joking in the headline but we don't know that he
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:14.480]  needs to respond and say hey that's out of context hey that's a joke or tell us
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:18.080]  why he'd make a good dictator I mean I'll be honest I like Trump he gets a
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:21.600]  little into the white horse thing to where he's gonna save us you know it's
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:26.520]  all a little bit creepy go ahead yeah yeah I agree with with Trump to you gotta
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:30.840]  watch some of the things he said but a lot of those candidates are watching the
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.680]  show and they do respond to what you have to say I agree stay there Kevin stay
[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:37.920]  there don't hang up yeah Ted Cruz came out and said the people have drugs
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.880]  report to counter the mainstream media and and and so I mean he gets it he's a
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.320]  good guy it's a great voting record but he's sitting there on video talking about

[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:31.240]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones by the way with 12 seconds to go we're
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:36.640]  here watching with a big playoff game the Patriots versus the Broncos 18 to
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:41.760]  20 will they be able to type the game or is it all over who cares I mean it's a
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:46.600]  badge of honor that I don't know about this if the country wasn't being
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.440]  collapsed if world government wasn't being announced then I might be watching
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:54.880]  this game but again people go man it's weird he gets excited about politics he
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:58.680]  gets excited about freedom excited about sovereignty excited about medical
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:03.520]  innovation but he doesn't like football it's not that I don't like football it's
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.400]  paid for propaganda I told people years ago that all that stuff where they'd
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.840]  cut the troops and talk about the troops was paid for and it shouldn't be paid
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.200]  for the NFL's just donate the time into it oh shut up you conspiracy theorist and
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:24.000]  last year they admitted all fake that's all I'm saying and then they don't
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.000]  actually take care of the troops when they get injured and private groups have
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.040]  to do it and the VA's got them on death list with a computer deciding who to
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.120]  treat see what I mean oh but we all feel good watching the NFL kind of like
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.480]  Walmart has big American flags in it saying made in America when almost
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:48.840]  everything they have is made in Chinese slave factories so we'll announce that
[01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:56.400]  as it unfolds but going back to your phone calls right now let's talk to
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:59.160]  Kevin in Colorado Kevin you got cut off with a break go ahead and finish your
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:08.280]  point all right so you brought up a good and about everything being made in
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:13.960]  China because one thing you know my brother's real big into the NFL and to
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:17.520]  me it's just completely distracting people from what's going on like the
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:24.120]  Obama you know getting military powers you know and just stuff like that it's
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:30.480]  unbelievable now I've actually worked at a retail center like like that and it's
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:35.480]  unbelievable how they they watch us on cameras we have iPads that are watching
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:39.120]  us listening to us we have finger printers that we have to fingerprint for
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:42.760]  any kind of return and anytime we get people's returns we have to get all
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.880]  their information and and people say oh good that's for security the point is
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:50.920]  it will become ubiquitous to buy and sell to do it and that gives the
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:54.600]  government corporations total control and they admit their planning to do it
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.960]  and by the way the Broncos are going to the Super Bowl they have one we've got
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:03.280]  dredgerport.com showing that the final 18 to 20 and again while we're busy
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.200]  watching play games the real game to dominate humanity is taking place go
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:15.080]  ahead exactly and you know this and I it's the name of my store has American
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:18.560]  in it and it's crazy how all the clothes are made from China by slave
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:22.080]  laborers you know we all need to get get together we need to bring back our
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:26.440]  jobs to America we need a you know even if you're going home and just creating
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.040]  a YouTube channel or getting on Facebook you need to start reposting your
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:34.640]  things videos of you know info wars they need to get on person planning it
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.080]  doesn't cost very much I did that this year on when it was on sale and now I'm
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:44.360]  on YouTube and I repost the videos because you know I'm the more we can do
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.800]  and get people awake that's what we need to do we all need to stand up because
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.960]  Alex Jones isn't the only one who can get mad we need to get mad and we need to
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.280]  do something about it God bless you everybody's got a smart phone or you
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:37:01.840]  can buy a cheap video camera for like 50 bucks and you can go out just as a
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.480]  newsgatherer I had a buddy will have a buddy he ended up being my camera guy
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:09.240]  for years and they took over some of his family businesses it doesn't do it anymore
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:15.640]  because he's so successful but he was a taxi driver and he made sometimes as much
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:21.640]  money videotaping houses burning or wrecks or whatever for the news then he
[01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:25.800]  made as a taxi driver with his video camera and I said hey you ought to just
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:29.760]  come work for me and they work for me part-time as I call him anytime he can
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.200]  work with me he wasn't trained in school any of that you know he get 500 bucks
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.400]  sometimes for a house fire 200 bucks for you know car wrecker you know 500 bucks
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:44.440]  for a police shooting or whatever and his brother's also an awesome cop
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:51.160]  interesting enough so I guess you might the point is is that there's so many
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:57.120]  things out there just entrepreneurally but separately for this country everybody
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:00.760]  should have a camera on them and then shoot video what you see and talk about
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:08.440]  it just the power of the people doing that is incalculable what it does I want
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:14.000]  to go back to phone calls here it's just that we've gotten in this position by
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:19.160]  being passive by not being involved and if people that want to promote liberty
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:22.920]  just get involved and just let Congress know they're not going to put up with
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:29.840]  tyranny things will change what is CNN and MSNBC said so many times Congress
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:33.440]  introduced a bill to stop giving armored vehicles of local police because of
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:37.360]  Alex Jones Congress is investigating why federal agencies are all arming
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.000]  themselves or Congress is investigating while the military is trying to take on
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.440]  the Tea Party or Congress is investigating into the IRS why they're
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:51.440]  following talking points of Alex Jones and bills are being passed I'm just one
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.360]  talk show host you get upset about Mitch McConnell trying to give Obama
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:01.760]  dictatorial power over the military he spins it criticizing Obama you don't
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.920]  want enough power to deal with I says I'm gonna give you all the power and then
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:10.040]  it's just you know total control these are the tricks they play we have to make
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:15.280]  that an issue we have to let them know we're aware of what they're doing
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:19.280]  DeWayne, Illinois then DeWayne in the Bay Area I guess that's out in San

[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.000]  in you know then then then then major brands but the bio PQQ is really
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:40.400]  something special that's been proven with the DNA the telomeres the body
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.560]  that's why you have areas that have been you know numb or areas of nerve damage
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:49.400]  we can actually say with DNA force it regrows nerves I mean it's a
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:54.200]  nutraceutical it's they've made a prescription in Europe the bio PQQ it
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:41:01.160]  cost us now $14,000 a kilo for the bio PQQ what did it do and that's one
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:07.280]  ingredient of a whole bunch of DNA force what did it do oh I I pretty much
[01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:12.200]  forgot of what I had you know I got factor five it's a blood disorder and
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:16.680]  you you don't clot properly you make blood clots that are bad for you they
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:23.560]  can kill you wow and with the DNA force it totally went away now that I'm off
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.080]  yeah the Japanese we can't say this in America but folks should check out bio
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.840]  PQQ and what they say it does but the Japanese government lets them say the
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.120]  Japanese are and then along with the people in the world by the way but for a
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:41.560]  lot of reasons bio PQQ is incredible it is incredible and they've got knockoff
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:44.920]  synthetic versions that are still probably do something but nothing we
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:53.760]  have the biological source of bio PQQ we have the earth-based animal-based bio
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.800]  PQQ not the synthetic and it is incredible

[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.680]  analysts at the time said this was Kim Jong-un and a display of saber-rattling

[01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.440]  clip but I don't want to play that even off YouTube if we need to Glenn Beck
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.360]  tells Iowa crowd he prefers Bernie Sanders over Donald Trump that's all you

[01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.920]  acting like it meanwhile Paul Ryan to meet with Obama next week is that just
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:24.960]  special oh but the Des Moines register endorses Clinton and Rubio that tells
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:28.480]  you all you did on that front I mentioned this then I'm going to your calls I'm
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:35.240]  gonna cover this more tomorrow but a drug to cure fear a chemical so you don't
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:39.080]  fear oh don't fear so you don't pay attention and run off the road don't
[01:50:39.080 --> 01:50:42.840]  fear so you don't lock your front door don't fear so you don't try to spend
[01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:46.040]  time with your kids they don't get on drugs you have fear when you get to an
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:49.640]  edge of a cliff for a reason and everything the system's trying to do is
[01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:56.080]  about turning off your basic instincts and people have done that to tyranny to
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:00.560]  corruption to being usurped and it's because the world is so complex we
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:05.760]  become just spectators or basically cogs in a machine instead of realizing the
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:13.800]  decisions we make and what we do change this machine for better or for worse the
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:19.880]  World Health Organization oh among us who among us hasn't wanted to let go of
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:23.040]  anxiety and forget about fear phobias panic attacks and disorders like
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:27.680]  post-traumatic stress are extremely common 29% of American adults will
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:33.240]  suffer from anxiety at some point in their lives and then it goes over the
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:37.800]  neuroscience psychiatry units and what they're developing folks that's like
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:43.120]  saying get rid of feeling you put your hand on hot stove so what if it burns
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:49.360]  your skin and now we go into the collapse of society because people won't go
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:54.120]  through justifiable pain or fear or anxiety of what people even think about
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:52:02.080]  them to stand up for what's right and so we lose our humanity I forget who it
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.520]  was that said legit those that avoid legitimate suffering you know avoiding
[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:12.800]  legitimate suffering is basically the fount or the root or the spring from
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:17.480]  which mental illness springs people won't admit they're wrong I know so many
[01:52:17.480 --> 01:52:24.000]  people that that I don't want to defeat that I don't want to outsmart that I
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.880]  don't want to crush but in some weird mental illness primitive form of
[01:52:29.880 --> 01:52:36.640]  dominance they want to take me on then they fail by the providence of God and I
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:44.600]  take no pleasure and the globalists are experts at manipulating people and it's
[01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:49.200]  very very sad and they want you domesticated they want you dumb they
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:52.200]  want to turn off your own self-preservation instincts because they
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:55.960]  don't want sentient involved people involved they don't want to compete with
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:58.880]  you they don't want to live with you they hate you because they hate
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:02.520]  themselves Chris and Indiana you're on the air thanks for calling on this
[01:53:02.520 --> 01:53:09.640]  Sunday World Wide Broadcast evening Alex go ahead for all those skeptical
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:12.520]  people out there that I know are in your show that listened to your show
[01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:18.080]  including you and me may read the first two paragraphs of the preface of
[01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:23.840]  Donald Trump's book entitled crippled America it'll take one minute I haven't
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.480]  read the intro to his book crippled America though I plugged it when he was
[01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:30.480]  on what does he say go ahead and read it to us you have in front of you I have a
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:34.880]  very in front of my eyes right now the first two paragraphs first page beginning
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:39.640]  some readers may be wondering what picture we used on the cover of this
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:44.080]  book is so angry and so mean-looking I had some beautiful pictures taken in
[01:53:44.080 --> 01:53:49.160]  which I had a big smile on my face I looked happy I looked content I looked
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.640]  like a very nice person my family loved those pictures and wanted me to use one
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:58.960]  of them the photographer did a great job but I decided it was not appropriate in
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:04.200]  this book we are talking about crippled America unfortunately there's very
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:09.160]  little that's nice about it so I wanted a picture where I was not happy a picture
[01:54:09.160 --> 01:54:13.440]  that reflected the anger and unhappiness that I feel rather than joy
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:19.640]  because we are not in a joy situation right now we're in a situation where we
[01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.640]  have to go back to work to make America great again all of us that's why I've
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:27.680]  written this book and that's the end of paragraph two end of the first page and
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:32.120]  the globalists don't exactly just him saying make us great again get involved
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:37.160]  cut taxes free market make better trade deals the globalists do want us to fall
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:41.440]  into this large old global government they do want to sabotage us they do
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:45.320]  want to bankrupt us they do want to get us on welfare of course they want to
[01:54:45.320 --> 01:54:48.960]  increase black unemployment they think that's their slaves you know for the
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:54.320]  Democratic Party and what just what he's saying is revolutionary and you must
[01:54:54.320 --> 01:55:00.200]  support what he's saying go ahead I just wanted to say that that at the very
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.480]  end of that second part it says that's one sentence those three words all of
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:08.360]  us and that's why you got all these minority groups protesting this thing
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:12.960]  because he they want to cut off the Gibbs which is the wealth he wants to cut
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:16.520]  well and folks are scared folks are scared they don't understand how good it

[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.480]  products for you the price that I've taken right now I've been taking them
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:39.520]  for about a month and they are great thank you taking the the nation I had I
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:46.960]  in X2 it's like night and day I've left caffeine alone completely the the
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:51.960]  super male vitality is great and the deep cleanse is excellent also I've been
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:56.040]  taking the brain force though the major difference with that and the vitamin D
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:00.720]  3 and D12 well thank you sir you help funder operation but yeah so many people
[01:56:00.720 --> 01:56:05.320]  are deficient or they're eating or drinking iodine that's bound that
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:08.280]  there's very little iodine out there that isn't bound up with something this
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:12.480]  is actually pure actually goes into your blood goes into your brain and all I know
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:16.560]  is when I don't take it I feel the difference oh it's definitely and the
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:20.800]  second thing I want to do is I want to talk about the Farrakhan interview I
[01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:25.800]  thought that that was excellent Alex and what I wanted to touch on is the fact
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:30.240]  that media is not reporting on it at all yeah notice they're always all over
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:34.520]  Farrakhan they're not because it was so positive yeah well you know I looked on
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.960]  Google and don't don't go anything I've seen was the nation Islam newspaper and
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:44.640]  the article that you guys wrote that's it and that lets you know when there's a
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:48.080]  total shutdown of news and information they're afraid of it because it doesn't
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:51.320]  fit into the narrative God bless you real fast Dwayne in the Bay Area you got
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.000]  one minute go ahead thanks for holding how you doing Alex if one more person
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.240]  comes up to me and tells me what can you do about all this I'm gonna blow my
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:03.800]  stack but anyway what I called for was I just talked to two local sheriffs in
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:08.280]  the county I live in and they say that they are Syrian refugees being brought
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.240]  in through the Travis Air Force base already being done right here right now
[01:57:12.240 --> 01:57:17.000]  sir they put 320 something at my alma mater we check to every other high
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.520]  school hundreds they claim there's only 50 something the whole state of Texas I
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:25.360]  agree somebody get down there with a camera get it on tape we we don't have
[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:28.600]  the I mean I'd send reporters I don't even have the the funds to send
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:32.520]  reporters there they're in Michigan other areas and in Iowa right now but
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:37.760]  absolutely brother everybody needs a document that something's going on and
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:41.480]  it's crazy God bless you sorry didn't have more time Dwayne let's put the one
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.320]  on hold and get more details from him and get him in touch with one of our
