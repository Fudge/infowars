[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  But for you to say that you're comfortable with fake news getting posted, that that's
[00:12.200 --> 00:13.200]  okay.
[00:13.200 --> 00:20.280]  You can't define fake news because what this is about is left-winging mainstream media,
[00:20.280 --> 00:25.440]  blaming conservative media for losing the election, losing credibility and losing readers.
[00:25.440 --> 00:29.960]  Their definition of fake news is anything that doesn't align with their leftist agenda.
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.960]  Freedom of speech is staring down the barrel of a gun loaded by a cancer of global interests
[00:35.960 --> 00:41.200]  that have laid claim to the last remaining fragments of the First Amendment of the United
[00:41.200 --> 00:43.080]  States of America.
[00:43.080 --> 00:49.040]  RT reports former congressman Ron Paul revealed a list of fake news journalists he claims
[00:49.040 --> 00:56.320]  are responsible for bogus wars and lies about Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the election.
[00:56.320 --> 00:59.640]  Journalists from CNN, The New York Times and The Guardian are included.
[00:59.640 --> 01:04.880]  According to the report on his website, Ron Paul Liberty report, this list contains the
[01:04.880 --> 01:10.280]  culprits who told us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and lied us into multiple
[01:10.280 --> 01:11.280]  bogus wars.
[01:11.280 --> 01:17.040]  Paul claims the list is sourced and holds a lot more water than a list previously released
[01:17.040 --> 01:23.280]  by Melissa Zimdar's who is described by Zero Hedge as an ultra-liberal assistant professor
[01:23.280 --> 01:25.880]  of communications at Merrimack College.
[01:25.880 --> 01:29.400]  Zimdar's list in itself should be considered fake.
[01:29.400 --> 01:35.800]  A list containing actual fake news sites alongside true news gathering alternative view sites
[01:35.800 --> 01:42.720]  that utilize the system of dissecting the mainstream narrative and its long history of fake reporting.
[01:42.720 --> 01:46.640]  Fake reporting is nothing new, just ask Brian Williams.
[01:46.640 --> 01:52.200]  After a ground fire incident in the desert during the Iraq War invasion, I made a mistake
[01:52.200 --> 01:55.640]  in recalling the events of 12 years ago.
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.880]  It did not take long to hear from some brave men and women in the aircrews who were also
[02:00.880 --> 02:02.280]  in that desert.
[02:02.280 --> 02:08.000]  I want to apologize, I said I was traveling in an aircraft that was hit by RPG fire.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.200]  I was instead in a following aircraft.
[02:11.200 --> 02:17.080]  With the loss of the globalist foothold and the quiet death of the Smith-Mon act in 2013,
[02:17.080 --> 02:20.120]  propaganda is being waged on all fronts.
[02:20.120 --> 02:25.240]  George Orwell said threats to freedom of speech, writing and action, though often trivial and
[02:25.240 --> 02:31.160]  isolation are cumulative in their effect and unless checked lead to a general disrespect
[02:31.160 --> 02:33.320]  for the rights of the citizen.
[02:33.320 --> 02:40.920]  Is the Constitution a living document open to interpretation or is it something that
[02:40.920 --> 02:45.240]  must be read strictly and adhered to regardless of the day?
[02:45.240 --> 02:51.800]  You know Scott, that is the question that is asked constantly of judges.
[02:51.800 --> 02:58.560]  And so to talk about strict interpretation or living constitution, those are not words
[02:58.560 --> 03:03.320]  I use and they're not words that I think have much meaning.
[03:03.320 --> 03:09.280]  The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world, lies will pass into history,
[03:09.280 --> 03:10.280]  George Orwell.
[03:10.280 --> 03:14.080]  You know when you first got in there and started looking around and didn't find anything, you
[03:14.080 --> 03:20.120]  get that kind of sinking feeling that uh oh and then time went on and then we got tips,
[03:20.120 --> 03:24.520]  you know, I'll never forget the tip that there was crates buried, you know, in the
[03:24.520 --> 03:26.800]  infrades or whatever they said.
[03:26.800 --> 03:30.160]  Maybe these are them and they sent frogmen and there was nothing there.
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.440]  In our age there is no such thing as keeping out of politics.
[03:34.440 --> 03:40.440]  All issues are political issues and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly,
[03:40.440 --> 03:43.440]  hatred and schizophrenia, George Orwell.
[03:43.440 --> 03:47.600]  You have to represent all of the people and the people have to believe that.
[03:47.600 --> 03:52.560]  You have to have the rule of law that applies to everyone, not just to some of the people.
[03:52.560 --> 03:58.080]  For those of you who are concerned about my using personal email, I understand and I am
[03:58.080 --> 04:04.320]  sure they will reach the same conclusion they did when they looked at my emails for the
[04:04.320 --> 04:05.320]  last year.
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.200]  There is no hate here.
[04:09.200 --> 04:14.400]  All the war propaganda, all the screaming and lies and hatred comes invariably from people
[04:14.400 --> 04:17.360]  who are not fighting George Orwell.
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.080]  We're helping us to destroy ISIL and we will destroy them.
[04:21.080 --> 04:23.240]  You're keeping us safe.
[04:23.240 --> 04:27.880]  The low key announcement of additional troop deployments marked the 11th by the Obama administration
[04:27.880 --> 04:33.600]  in the last 27 months, each time ranging from 200 to 1500, such that the total number
[04:33.600 --> 04:39.040]  of U.S. troops and advisors in Iraq will exceed 5,000 by the time the president leaves office.
[04:39.040 --> 04:43.720]  It is up to the individual and boldened by the rights of a free press and the protection
[04:43.720 --> 04:50.040]  of the liberty passed down from the founders to control their own mind and their own destiny.
[04:50.040 --> 04:53.040]  John Baum for Infowars.com.
[04:53.040 --> 04:57.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, the 22nd day of November 2016.
[04:57.240 --> 04:58.240]  We're live.
[04:58.240 --> 05:00.240]  Stay with us.
[05:00.240 --> 05:05.880]  Late document shows, Trump does actually plan to build a wall, 1989 miles plan for rapid
[05:05.880 --> 05:06.880]  build.
[05:06.880 --> 05:11.520]  Article up at Infowars.com, Kansas Secretary of State Chris Koba, an expert on border
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.320]  security and legal immigration met with Trump on Sunday in New Jersey.
[05:15.320 --> 05:20.400]  Koba was holding a file of papers, one of which was snapped by a media photographer from
[05:20.400 --> 05:21.400]  a distance.
[05:21.400 --> 05:26.120]  It is entitled Department of Homeland Security Koba strategic plan for first 365 days.
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.600]  When zoomed in, the paper reads that in addition to 386 miles of existing wall, there's a
[05:30.600 --> 05:34.400]  further 1,989 miles plan for rapid build.
[05:34.400 --> 05:37.840]  According to Trump's past statements, the total length of the wall wouldn't need to
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.240]  run the whole 2,000 miles of the border due to natural barriers.
[05:41.240 --> 05:44.520]  The document flies in the face of claims by Hillers supporters and media opponents that
[05:44.520 --> 05:47.320]  Trump's promise to build a wall was just hot air.
[05:47.320 --> 05:50.880]  At the start of the year, left wing website Crooks and Liars snart, will Trump supporters
[05:50.880 --> 05:53.440]  hate to break into you, but there's not going to be a wall.
[05:53.440 --> 05:54.440]  Well, guess what?
[05:54.440 --> 05:55.440]  We're getting that wall, baby.
[05:55.440 --> 05:56.440]  Woo!
[05:56.440 --> 05:59.640]  It's been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[05:59.640 --> 06:04.600]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's
[06:04.600 --> 06:09.560]  talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid, the potential
[06:09.560 --> 06:11.920]  for power grid chaos.
[06:11.920 --> 06:18.440]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very
[06:18.440 --> 06:20.040]  real threat to our grid.
[06:20.040 --> 06:23.320]  My friend's chaos is already here, and it's going to get a lot worse.
[06:23.320 --> 06:27.920]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply
[06:27.920 --> 06:29.320]  of backup electricity.

[06:34.400 --> 06:35.400]  system.

[08:24.000 --> 08:40.280]  Today, I would like to provide the American people with an update on the White House transition
[08:40.280 --> 08:44.040]  and our policy plans for the first 100 days.
[08:44.040 --> 08:49.640]  Our transition team is working very smoothly, efficiently and effectively, truly great and
[08:49.640 --> 08:54.960]  talented men and women, patriots indeed, are being brought in, and many will soon be a
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.400]  part of our government, helping us to make America great again.
[08:59.400 --> 09:04.680]  My agenda will be based on a simple core principle, putting America first.
[09:04.680 --> 09:10.480]  Whether it's producing steel, building cars, or curing disease, I want the next generation
[09:10.480 --> 09:16.880]  of production and innovation to happen right here on our great homeland, America, creating
[09:16.880 --> 09:19.800]  wealth and jobs for American workers.
[09:19.800 --> 09:25.000]  As part of this plan, I've asked my transition team to develop a list of executive actions
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.320]  we can take on day one to restore our laws and bring back our jobs.
[09:30.320 --> 09:31.760]  It's about time.
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.520]  These include the following.
[09:33.520 --> 09:39.200]  On trade, I am going to issue our notification of intent to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific
[09:39.200 --> 09:42.960]  Partnership a potential disaster for our country.
[09:42.960 --> 09:48.280]  Instead, we will negotiate fair bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back
[09:48.280 --> 09:50.320]  onto American shores.
[09:50.320 --> 09:56.400]  On energy, I will cancel job-killing restrictions on the production of American energy, including
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.760]  shale energy and clean coal, creating many millions of high-paying jobs.
[10:01.760 --> 10:03.760]  That's what we want.
[10:03.760 --> 10:05.800]  That's what we've been waiting for.
[10:05.800 --> 10:11.320]  On regulation, I will formulate a rule which says that for every one new regulation, two
[10:11.320 --> 10:16.480]  old regulations must be eliminated, so important.
[10:16.480 --> 10:21.600]  On national security, I will ask the Department of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
[10:21.600 --> 10:26.960]  of Staff to develop a comprehensive plan to protect America's vital infrastructure from
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.320]  cyber attacks and all other form of attacks.
[10:31.320 --> 10:36.520]  On immigration, I will direct the Department of Labor to investigate all abuses of visa
[10:36.520 --> 10:40.720]  programs that undercut the American worker.
[10:40.720 --> 10:46.480]  On ethics reform, as part of our plan to drain the swamp, we will impose a five-year ban on
[10:46.480 --> 10:52.280]  executive officials becoming lobbyists after they leave the administration and a lifetime
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.360]  ban on executive officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.240]  These are just a few of the steps we will take to reform Washington and rebuild our
[11:02.240 --> 11:03.520]  middle class.
[11:03.520 --> 11:08.600]  I will provide more updates in the coming days as we work together to make America great
[11:08.600 --> 11:10.480]  again for everyone.
[11:10.480 --> 11:13.440]  And I mean everyone.
[11:13.440 --> 11:15.480]  It's Tuesday, October 22nd, 2016.
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.720]  We'll be here for the next three hours and 50-plus minutes, and of course, there'll
[11:19.720 --> 11:22.160]  be InfoWars and Outly News tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[11:22.160 --> 11:26.480]  It kind of feels like a Friday, even though it's a Tuesday, because a lot of people are
[11:26.480 --> 11:29.440]  going to obviously be taking off the next few days.
[11:29.440 --> 11:36.520]  We'll have some rebroadcast, but also some original content and live feeds at infowars.com
[11:36.520 --> 11:39.920]  throughout the holiday, obviously, because this is not work for me.
[11:39.920 --> 11:46.640]  This is a very distinct honor and pleasure to be your host.
[11:46.640 --> 11:49.320]  I talked about it last week, and I'm going to say it again.
[11:49.320 --> 11:51.960]  A lot of very exciting things happening.
[11:51.960 --> 11:55.920]  Trump is delivering on every front.
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.920]  He is looking at appointing and talking about appointing some people I don't like, like
[12:00.920 --> 12:01.920]  Bolton.
[12:01.920 --> 12:07.960]  But on the actual policies, he's already announcing, he is delivering.
[12:07.960 --> 12:11.760]  He also did something particularly delicious yesterday.
[12:11.760 --> 12:18.040]  He called in the corporate prostitute, Decepticon, fake news media, and said, I hate you.
[12:18.040 --> 12:19.600]  You're lying scum.
[12:19.600 --> 12:21.000]  You're rats.
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  Your system is collapsing.
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.560]  And basically, I don't want to work with you, so get out of here.
[12:28.560 --> 12:35.240]  This is beautiful, and I can tell you, laughing at the media is the times I've talked to Trump
[12:35.240 --> 12:38.960]  off air is something we do, because they really are a joke.
[12:38.960 --> 12:40.600]  They're the enemy of this country.
[12:40.600 --> 12:41.600]  They must be denigrated.
[12:41.600 --> 12:42.960]  They must be hated.
[12:42.960 --> 12:45.280]  All respect must be removed from them.
[12:45.280 --> 12:50.640]  There's a big new study out via Canada and the UK, and there's two studies, actually,
[12:50.640 --> 12:57.800]  but it's out of Canada with a Canadian ambassador being interviewed speaking about the studies.
[12:57.800 --> 13:03.040]  Finding that, again, US media is the most untrusted in the world after the European
[13:03.040 --> 13:05.840]  Union-controlled media and the UK media.
[13:05.840 --> 13:11.240]  And, of course, they're all lockstep of political correctness and globalism, a very, very exciting
[13:11.240 --> 13:12.240]  thing.
[13:12.240 --> 13:14.960]  But speaking of delivering, it's now official.
[13:14.960 --> 13:15.960]  You just heard him.
[13:15.960 --> 13:21.840]  On day one, they will signal we are leaving the TPP, which we never entered, but Obama
[13:21.840 --> 13:23.480]  signed us on to.
[13:23.480 --> 13:25.920]  He's also announcing the end of the carbon tax.
[13:25.920 --> 13:33.000]  We've been under seven years carbon regulations that are a tax, but Congress never ratified
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  it.
[13:34.000 --> 13:43.200]  Congress rejected cap and trade in, what, 2003.
[13:43.200 --> 13:47.360]  So think about that, and then it rejected it again in 2006.
[13:47.360 --> 13:51.640]  Bushes tried it, Obama's tried it, Congress has rejected it.
[13:51.640 --> 13:52.640]  Let me see.
[13:52.640 --> 13:55.000]  It's actually three times I remember.
[13:55.000 --> 13:56.560]  So now, why are we under it?
[13:56.560 --> 14:01.120]  Just like the EU, almost every member nation never got to vote to enter it, like the UK.
[14:01.120 --> 14:06.440]  How in the hell are they then signed on to it?
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.040]  But let me not belabor that, let me, that's just one of the big things he's announcing.
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.360]  Bye-bye carbon tax, bye-bye TPP.
[14:14.360 --> 14:21.080]  Making America rich again, Trump's stock market rally breaks all-time record, US stocks hit
[14:21.080 --> 14:30.800]  high, leaked documents shows Trump does actually plan to build a wall, 100, 1,989 miles planned
[14:30.800 --> 14:36.320]  for rapid build with the 300 miles they've got, that's total wall.
[14:36.320 --> 14:40.600]  Obama admin finds police departments for not hiring non-citizens, now they're actually
[14:40.600 --> 14:43.280]  hiring illegals to be the police officers.
[14:43.280 --> 14:48.520]  Tim Allen says Hollywood calls Trump a bully, then bullies anyone who supports him.
[14:48.520 --> 14:52.560]  Obama administration shuts down aerial surveillance on the border while saying we're facing an
[14:52.560 --> 14:57.360]  al-Qaeda ISIS imminent attack.
[14:57.360 --> 15:03.040]  Hell exit, secession effort begins signatures gathering on the California ballot.
[15:03.040 --> 15:09.200]  I say we cut California loose folks and build a wall, I'm serious, cut it loose.
[15:09.200 --> 15:12.440]  Not because of the color of the people that are there, but because it is totally given
[15:12.440 --> 15:17.320]  over to bankruptcy, totally given over to gun control, totally given over to corruption.
[15:17.320 --> 15:22.200]  The elites there all have lawyers that write the laws to basically pay no taxes, while
[15:22.200 --> 15:26.720]  everything is written to rob the average person, it is a disaster, we either somehow
[15:26.720 --> 15:32.120]  recapture California politically or it's a cancer that must be cut off, and I'm serious,
[15:32.120 --> 15:34.520]  I say cut it off.
[15:34.520 --> 15:40.520]  It will descend into Bedlam and will look like Mexico City, and that's fine.
[15:40.520 --> 15:48.320]  But we cannot collapse into total tyranny, it's a beautiful state, wonderful people,
[15:48.320 --> 15:52.120]  but I have to tell you when California finally does collapse, the migration of trendies will
[15:52.120 --> 15:53.960]  bring down any area they come to.
[15:53.960 --> 16:02.120]  Trend is under assault, infested by the laziest, stupest, dumbest, most arrogant, horrible
[16:02.120 --> 16:08.920]  politically correct demons, shuffling, waddling around in circles, and they're all the banshees
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.520]  and people that moved to California thinking it was the new heaven, the new nirvana, the
[16:13.520 --> 16:19.080]  new cloud nine, the new Valhalla, and then they destroy it even worse, and then they
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.880]  come here to the point of, I mean if my headquarters weren't in Austin, if I didn't have family
[16:23.880 --> 16:27.800]  from here and I wasn't from here, I would be pulling up right now, in fact I'm actually
[16:27.800 --> 16:32.160]  looking at a few years leaving these studios and leaving Austin, I just can't handle it.
[16:32.160 --> 16:37.320]  They have captured it, the defecation in the streets, the homeless people everywhere, the
[16:37.320 --> 16:42.920]  just nihilistic hatred of anything decent, running into the ground, the big megabanks
[16:42.920 --> 16:51.000]  tax exempt, robbing everyone, passing a gen 21 laws so that your apartment's 200 feet
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.240]  and costs the same as the 1,000 square foot, I mean you want to get scammed and butt raped.
[16:57.240 --> 17:03.400]  Austin, Texas is the place for it to happen, and I'm sorry to use that mild French, I apologize,
[17:03.400 --> 17:06.560]  I'm going to stop it.
[17:06.560 --> 17:11.320]  I love Austin, it's a beautiful town, great people, but there's total election fraud,
[17:11.320 --> 17:15.360]  and you can't unseat the scum, and they just love it.
[17:15.360 --> 17:20.520]  They've destroyed California, now they're destroying my beloved Texas.
[17:20.520 --> 17:26.120]  Trump's secession effort begins signature gathering on the California ballot.
[17:26.120 --> 17:32.200]  Now that's just some of the news on that front, let me give you the splendid delicious news.
[17:32.200 --> 17:36.400]  But let me just mention this and I'll cover it after a break.
[17:36.400 --> 17:42.280]  President-elect Slam's smug media in face to face at Trump Tower were in a room of liars,
[17:42.280 --> 17:45.520]  the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.
[17:45.520 --> 17:49.240]  It's supposed to be an off the record meeting, but the Trump folks have confirmed this went
[17:49.240 --> 17:56.000]  on, he told them, look, I hate you, you hate me, let's just be honest, you work for corporate
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.320]  execs that are fools, you've bankrupted yourselves, you have no credibility, and I just want to
[18:00.320 --> 18:04.560]  declare that you're scum, that's exactly what I tell them.
[18:04.560 --> 18:10.200]  The New York Times and stuff want to talk to me, I go, are you talking to me as a prop
[18:10.200 --> 18:16.880]  to pretend we're doing an interview?
[18:16.880 --> 18:24.080]  And I loved watching so-called journalists like Stephanopoulos and people scurrying out
[18:24.080 --> 18:25.080]  of there.
[18:25.080 --> 18:30.960]  And Wolf Blitzer looked like he'd been flogged with a cat or nine tails when he left.
[18:30.960 --> 18:36.200]  Donald Trump's media summit was an effing firing squad.
[18:36.200 --> 18:41.240]  He told Jeff Zucker, quote, I hate your network, everyone at seeing is a liar and you should
[18:41.240 --> 18:52.880]  be ashamed, I'm sorry, this is too good, it's too good, Trump knows exactly what to do.
[18:52.880 --> 18:57.400]  We must bankrupt these organizations, they're already financed by King Pins and drug dealers
[18:57.400 --> 19:00.200]  and every other criminal organization you can imagine, they want to bring the country
[19:00.200 --> 19:02.560]  down, you're going down.
[19:02.560 --> 19:05.600]  Whatever little sponsorship you've got left, everybody has to contact your sponsors and
[19:05.600 --> 19:10.640]  say, I will never use your product if I see your ad on there one more time.
[19:10.640 --> 19:13.640]  You want to bring down America, we're going to get in your face, we're going to lean on
[19:13.640 --> 19:16.600]  you and see how you like it, you little bullies.
[19:16.600 --> 19:19.600]  You bullied this country around a little too long.
[19:19.600 --> 19:24.280]  Now, there's a story from Steve Watson and Breitbart is chewing them up for this and that's
[19:24.280 --> 19:25.280]  his chief strategist.
[19:25.280 --> 19:28.600]  Obviously, there's some separation there with the writers, I don't control my writers
[19:28.600 --> 19:29.600]  right.
[19:29.600 --> 19:33.440]  I just hire them as their patriots and have a history to tell the truth, but Trump gives
[19:33.440 --> 19:38.080]  Hillary a pass, Breitbart leads with criticism.
[19:38.080 --> 19:45.160]  And this is what Conway is saying, that all he wants to be nice to her until he gets in.
[19:45.160 --> 19:48.680]  A Senator's Sessions appointment means that's not the case, but just let Trump get in in
[19:48.680 --> 19:51.400]  58 days, then we'll see what happens.
[19:51.400 --> 19:55.940]  But it's not up to Trump, to be up to the Attorney General and justice, and I got a
[19:55.940 --> 20:00.280]  feeling justice is going to be served, they'll be back, stay with us.
[20:00.280 --> 20:04.760]  We use cell phones against our heads every day, but now a landmark U.S. government study
[20:04.760 --> 20:09.840]  confirms increased health risks from exposure to EMF radiation emitted from these devices.

[24:16.480 --> 24:23.400]  It's going to be relegated to the South, a party of old, racist, decrepit, baby boomer
[24:23.400 --> 24:29.000]  pieces of garbage to quote the Democrats.
[24:29.000 --> 24:30.000]  To quote AIDS Greliks.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.200]  But it didn't work, did it?
[24:32.200 --> 24:38.400]  Instead, they're talking about the Democratic Party going extinct and the Republican establishment
[24:38.400 --> 24:49.840]  being run out on a rail or just absorbed by the Trumpian revolution.
[24:49.840 --> 24:56.200]  You know, there's a big article out dealing with Trump's son-in-law, who is what is top
[24:56.200 --> 25:01.840]  advisers, Jared Kushner, and the headline from Forbes is that he won Trump the White
[25:01.840 --> 25:02.840]  House.
[25:02.840 --> 25:03.840]  That's the headline on DrudgeReport.com.
[25:03.840 --> 25:04.840]  You can see the cover of Forbes.
[25:04.840 --> 25:09.200]  And I think, to a certain extent, that's true, because he got Trump early on to mainly focus
[25:09.200 --> 25:14.560]  on the Internet and to realize, to see Trump's not big on the Internet, that that was already
[25:14.560 --> 25:15.560]  the new media.
[25:15.560 --> 25:21.200]  They give him the credit for doing early videos that got 75 million views and stuff like that,
[25:21.200 --> 25:22.200]  folks.
[25:22.200 --> 25:26.680]  We've got Trump 500 million views on our videos about Trump.
[25:26.680 --> 25:29.720]  I mean, I'm not trying to get credit for that.
[25:29.720 --> 25:34.160]  I'm just stating, if Forbes thinks 75 million views is a big deal.
[25:34.160 --> 25:36.680]  I can show them where the views are.
[25:36.680 --> 25:42.600]  Or Drudge probably sent, I don't know, 20 million people a day, sometimes, pro-Trump info.
[25:42.600 --> 25:43.840]  But none of us get the credit.
[25:43.840 --> 25:48.760]  It's the globalist discrediting themselves, I mean, so arrogant that gets the credit,
[25:48.760 --> 25:50.360]  and then it's the leakers.
[25:50.360 --> 25:54.200]  But the reason it is important to look at how we won this is so that we continue to repeat
[25:54.200 --> 25:56.360]  it and aren't arrogant.
[25:56.360 --> 25:58.240]  We have to deliver tax cuts.
[25:58.240 --> 26:02.960]  We have to deliver at least spending freezes.
[26:02.960 --> 26:06.000]  And we have to absolutely secure our borders.
[26:06.000 --> 26:11.000]  And we have to cut the billion-dollar fighter programs that are pieces of crap and actually
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.360]  have a strong defense military.
[26:14.360 --> 26:16.880]  And of course, we have to get fairer tariff deals.
[26:16.880 --> 26:24.400]  And we'll have such prosperity and such a boom that the era of socialism will be broken
[26:24.400 --> 26:29.800]  worldwide and the era of the robber barons will be over.
[26:29.800 --> 26:34.360]  And again, you had a lot of followers that kind of believed the mainstream media and
[26:34.360 --> 26:35.360]  thought it was invincible.
[26:35.360 --> 26:37.880]  But a lot of the reporters and people working for the system, they didn't really believe
[26:37.880 --> 26:38.880]  it.
[26:38.880 --> 26:39.880]  They didn't like what was happening.
[26:39.880 --> 26:42.080]  And you're seeing that facade really collapse now.
[26:42.080 --> 26:48.000]  Now, there are the bitter, bitter, bitter people who believe in the whole false cosmology.
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  They're going to become more psychopathic.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.480]  And I'm going to talk about that in the next break, next segment.
[26:52.480 --> 26:54.120]  But just look at these numbers.
[26:54.120 --> 27:02.080]  That party going extinct, administration is disintegrating.
[27:02.080 --> 27:03.800]  They don't have any of their top people.
[27:03.800 --> 27:06.120]  Everyone basically hates them.
[27:06.120 --> 27:10.640]  Dems serving donor class, not working class.
[27:10.640 --> 27:12.640]  Representative Ryan admits.
[27:12.640 --> 27:16.720]  And again, they are just so disconnected, so arrogant, they think they're invincible.
[27:16.720 --> 27:23.920]  Look at this headline, 96% hopeful poll showed tremendous confidence in President Trump.
[27:23.920 --> 27:29.840]  And all the national polls show people that thought he would destroy the planet, day one
[27:29.840 --> 27:34.160]  are now seeing stock market go up, they're seeing confidence, they're seeing Ford announcements
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.920]  coming back, they're seeing Apple talk about coming back.
[27:38.920 --> 27:42.960]  And then the media spends it and says, well, it was never clear that Ford was going to
[27:42.960 --> 27:43.960]  go to Mexico.
[27:43.960 --> 27:45.840]  So this isn't really a victory.
[27:45.840 --> 27:47.000]  Oh, really?
[27:47.000 --> 27:51.200]  They said they were going to Mexico with that SUV factory.
[27:51.200 --> 27:56.040]  The point is, is that there are economic things we can do to strengthen this nation
[27:56.040 --> 27:58.720]  and not just sell the country out.
[27:58.720 --> 28:06.840]  And they're still upset that's happening, and that's why they're so incredibly discredited.
[28:06.840 --> 28:11.960]  You can see that big scientific poll from Pew Research up on infowars.com.
[28:11.960 --> 28:18.560]  I already talked about him delivering on the announcement, day one in 58 days when he gets
[28:18.560 --> 28:24.840]  in to pull out of TPP, a foreign global government, in the carbon taxes, they go, you're not allowed
[28:24.840 --> 28:29.600]  to do that, Hollande, the president of France lectured Trump yesterday from the national
[28:29.600 --> 28:37.120]  podium in France, from the royal palace, said you're not allowed to do that, no matter
[28:37.120 --> 28:39.760]  what you say, you're in it.
[28:39.760 --> 28:43.680]  Congress never voted to put us into that unilaterally.
[28:43.680 --> 28:45.560]  It's fraud.
[28:45.560 --> 28:49.480]  But that's the arrogance with the communist Chinese and the French president, the socialist
[28:49.480 --> 28:51.800]  dirtbag, lecturing us.
[28:51.800 --> 28:56.400]  Now, when we come back, I want to read more of the quotes, and again, I don't believe
[28:56.400 --> 29:01.920]  mainstream media, but more than 20 agencies were represented there, and they all basically
[29:01.920 --> 29:02.920]  said the same thing.
[29:02.920 --> 29:03.920]  So now you know it's true.
[29:03.920 --> 29:09.560]  Plus, it fits with what I know Trump basically says behind the scenes.
[29:09.560 --> 29:13.840]  He just called them in and said, you're scum, you're liars, you're delusional, no one watches
[29:13.840 --> 29:14.840]  you.
[29:14.840 --> 29:17.440]  You're so arrogant.
[29:17.440 --> 29:19.040]  Why did you lie about me so much?
[29:19.040 --> 29:20.840]  Why do you put out fake tweets?
[29:20.840 --> 29:24.240]  Why do you put out fake statements?
[29:24.240 --> 29:27.080]  What the hell is Bloomberg doing putting out fake tweets?
[29:27.080 --> 29:29.120]  What is your problem?
[29:29.120 --> 29:32.960]  Don't you know the American people see through you?
[29:32.960 --> 29:38.080]  How dare you not want to turn the economy back on so you can squat on top of people?
[29:38.080 --> 29:39.600]  That's what's going on behind the scenes.
[29:39.600 --> 29:40.600]  It's beautiful.
[29:40.600 --> 29:43.200]  They need to be read the riot act.
[29:43.200 --> 29:45.680]  Hey, scum, we see you.
[29:45.680 --> 29:49.280]  We know who you are, dirtbags.
[29:49.280 --> 29:50.560]  We're on the march.
[29:50.560 --> 29:53.080]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.080 --> 30:23.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:23.000 --> 30:29.880]  What I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn't like Trump because he was a bully.
[30:29.880 --> 30:34.000]  But if you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump, you got bullied for doing that.
[30:34.000 --> 30:37.720]  Alan also questioned how left-wing comedians can make jokes based on Trump's supposed
[30:37.720 --> 30:42.120]  dislike of homosexuals when there was little to no evidence that he was against gay people.
[30:42.120 --> 30:45.000]  Then he waved the LGBT flag at the convention.
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.360]  The actor said that Hollywood was playing a version of Chinese whispers where something
[30:48.360 --> 30:51.360]  Trump said ends up being completely misconstrued.
[30:51.360 --> 30:55.000]  As we previously discussed, Hollywood is a place where diversity is celebrated, apart
[32:21.360 --> 32:25.680]  are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[32:25.680 --> 32:30.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.880]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[32:32.880 --> 32:34.560]  It works like an antioxidant.
[32:34.560 --> 32:37.520]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[32:37.520 --> 32:40.640]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[32:40.640 --> 32:41.680]  It's in powder form.
[32:41.680 --> 32:44.360]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[32:44.360 --> 32:45.360]  I take this.
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.240]  This is the product that I take.
[32:47.240 --> 33:16.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:17.600 --> 33:23.280]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:23.280 --> 33:32.280]  Every time I look in the mirror, every time that I look in the mirror, all these lines,
[33:32.280 --> 33:36.280]  all these lines in my face get clearer.
[33:36.280 --> 33:38.280]  The past is gone.
[33:38.280 --> 33:40.280]  The past is gone.
[33:40.280 --> 33:43.280]  It'll all go by like dust shall dawn.
[33:43.280 --> 33:47.280]  It'll all go by like dust shall dawn.
[33:47.280 --> 33:49.280]  Isn't that the way?
[33:49.280 --> 33:51.280]  Isn't that the way?
[33:51.280 --> 33:55.280]  Everybody's got their dues in life to pay.
[33:55.280 --> 33:58.280]  Out of this rendition, it's better than Aerosmith's.
[33:58.280 --> 34:00.280]  Well, I know.
[34:00.280 --> 34:07.280]  Well, I know nobody knows where it comes and where it goes.
[34:07.280 --> 34:14.280]  I know it's everybody's sin, you've got to lose to know how to win.
[34:14.280 --> 34:16.280]  You've got to lose to know how to win.
[34:16.280 --> 34:19.280]  You've got all these globalists giving their money to their parents and grandparents.
[34:19.280 --> 34:23.280]  Totally arrogant, drunk on power because they didn't attain it themselves.
[34:23.280 --> 34:27.280]  Seeing themselves separate from us.
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.280]  What fools, they're no different than us.
[34:32.280 --> 34:42.280]  When it comes to being human, they are different than us because they don't have the soul
[34:42.280 --> 34:46.280]  truly empathized with their fellow humans.
[34:46.280 --> 34:49.280]  They're stunted.
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.280]  Alright, let's get right into the really big important news, obviously.
[34:53.280 --> 34:55.280]  Incredibly exciting things happening.
[34:55.280 --> 34:58.280]  Fukushima dodged a bullet, but narrowly.
[34:58.280 --> 35:02.280]  Be like a bullet going through your hair and cutting a swath through your hair,
[35:02.280 --> 35:04.280]  but not hitting you in the skull.
[35:04.280 --> 35:07.280]  Japan reported a 7.8.
[35:07.280 --> 35:12.280]  US geological saying 7.3, 7.6 had varied.
[35:12.280 --> 35:17.280]  That's about the strength that hit five, six years ago and made those reactors explode
[35:17.280 --> 35:20.280]  that are still melting down into the Pacific Ocean today.
[35:20.280 --> 35:25.280]  They were reporting that the tsunami was going to have to be 10 feet or higher when it came in,
[35:25.280 --> 35:32.280]  but it was only a few feet high, caused some flooding but not any massive damage like you saw
[35:32.280 --> 35:40.280]  in that dramatic footage that we all witnessed when the big tsunami hit Fukushima before.
[35:40.280 --> 35:45.280]  So that is certainly some good news there.
[35:45.280 --> 35:51.280]  Continuing, we are having Black Friday specials that kick off each day
[35:51.280 --> 35:55.280]  and that run for 24 hours right through Friday, I guess right through the weekend.
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.280]  And today, it is survival shield nascent iodine X2.
[35:59.280 --> 36:06.280]  Now, obviously, you would take potassium iodine, this is beyond that, it's pure iodine, true iodine, atomic iodine,
[36:06.280 --> 36:11.280]  that goes into the thyroid other glands so that you don't absorb the fluoride and the other garbage
[36:11.280 --> 36:17.280]  and during a radiological event, the radioactive iodine is the most common fallout.
[36:17.280 --> 36:21.280]  But see, that's just an example. You want your thyroid filled with good iodine all the time
[36:21.280 --> 36:24.280]  so it's not absorbing all the other trash that's out there.
[36:24.280 --> 36:31.280]  As it operates off halogen, off iodine, if it doesn't have that, it will absorb anything else to operate on.
[36:31.280 --> 36:35.280]  And you just see the record thyroid problems out there and the things that are going on.
[36:35.280 --> 36:41.280]  I've lost so much weight, been so much healthier, now that I've been taking it for years and I religiously take it now
[36:41.280 --> 36:46.280]  and it's almost a crutch because, I'm going to be honest, I work out now a third of what I used to
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.280]  and with the supermal vitality and survival shield X2 and things like that
[36:50.280 --> 36:56.280]  and the DNA force I take daily now, it's really a joke that I only work out now two or three times a week
[36:56.280 --> 37:00.280]  and I was working out six, seven days a week and it just wasn't having the same effect.
[37:00.280 --> 37:08.280]  It was all because of my whole metabolic system was not getting what it needed.
[37:08.280 --> 37:14.280]  So this is truly symbiotic. You get great products, you fund the tip of the spear operation, fighting the globalists.
[37:14.280 --> 37:24.280]  I want to thank you all for your support. Black Friday week, free speech special, 30% off survival shield X2, nascent iodine.
[37:24.280 --> 37:31.280]  We have the all new brain force plus has arrived on 20% more in each bottle and a stronger formula on top of that.
[37:31.280 --> 37:39.280]  What's plus plus really bio PCA Black Friday special started yesterday, we're standing in a few days, 25% off
[37:39.280 --> 37:47.280]  on our ultimate new hair, skin and nails formula at 1995. It is a joke level deal. It's now 1496.
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.280]  That doesn't even make any money on that. That's a lost leader right now.
[37:51.280 --> 37:57.280]  The leading competitors have the same stuff in it and are $45, $50, $60 for one ingredient that's in it.
[37:57.280 --> 38:01.280]  It's ridiculous. That's what we do. We take knockout.
[38:01.280 --> 38:07.280]  We take nine things that are known to help you give deep restful regenerating sleep
[38:07.280 --> 38:15.280]  like lemon balm and chamomile and held trip to fan and Valerian root and about a ton and more.
[38:15.280 --> 38:20.280]  I remember saying a few years ago, I was sitting there. Sometimes I'm trouble sleeping and my kids would sometimes too.
[38:20.280 --> 38:23.280]  So I give them a little melatonin tablet, a little bit of larian root.
[38:23.280 --> 38:31.280]  And I was like, why am I buying this tincture from Whole Foods and this other thing and this is $19 and this is $19 and I'm giving them both.
[38:31.280 --> 38:37.280]  Because together it works better and I'm like, hey, I'm taking two. That's 40 bucks.
[38:37.280 --> 38:40.280]  Let's see how much this stuff costs. Organic high quality.
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.280]  We went out and found out we could put nine things in there. All the same does as what other people do.
[38:44.280 --> 38:50.280]  It would cost probably $100. Let's sell it for $19.95. That's what we do.
[38:50.280 --> 38:57.280]  Super high quality, organic. It's an amazing deal.
[38:57.280 --> 39:02.280]  Infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.280]  And thank you for all the great five star reviews for the products on the third party side power reviews and others.
[39:07.280 --> 39:10.280]  Be sure and read those reviews for yourself.
[39:10.280 --> 39:14.280]  And it is your purchases that make everything we do here possible.
[39:14.280 --> 39:18.280]  So I want to thank you all again.
[39:18.280 --> 39:23.280]  And then we're going to try to help get your taxes cut. Again, it's all symbiotic.
[39:23.280 --> 39:29.280]  It's a non-zero sum game. A 360 win is the coin to the realm here these days.
[39:29.280 --> 39:35.280]  I'm even hearing more in the culture now about 360 wins and wins all around.
[39:35.280 --> 39:40.280]  And what do you call a win where everybody wins? It's a 360 win.
[39:40.280 --> 39:45.280]  And you can really do that folks with technology and what we've got.
[39:45.280 --> 39:49.280]  The problem is some people are going to be better than you or I at certain things.
[39:49.280 --> 39:52.280]  They're going to be more beautiful. They're going to be faster. They're going to be taller.
[39:52.280 --> 39:55.280]  They're going to be stronger. We're going to have gifts that they don't have.
[39:55.280 --> 39:58.280]  Together, we work together to build a better world.
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.280]  But you have to let people shine. You have to let people be winners.
[40:02.280 --> 40:05.280]  You have to let the best kids get something at the trophy.
[40:05.280 --> 40:08.280]  And not just give everyone a participation trophy.
[40:08.280 --> 40:13.280]  And tell your kids, sorry, you get a piece of pizza.
[40:13.280 --> 40:18.280]  Because then kids learn to fail and they learn to win.
[40:18.280 --> 40:23.280]  But if you don't learn how to fail and deal with it, you become a but hurt wimp.
[40:23.280 --> 40:26.280]  And I'm telling you, it is basket case world out there.
[40:26.280 --> 40:30.280]  Where about half the people, you can't criticize them. You can't tell them to fix something.
[40:30.280 --> 40:33.280]  You can't tell them to change something or they take it personal.
[40:33.280 --> 40:36.280]  And that is the mark of losers.
[40:36.280 --> 40:40.280]  They are instilling that in us on purpose.
[40:40.280 --> 40:46.280]  They're trying to make the military where it can't chew people out or put people through dangerous situations.
[40:46.280 --> 40:48.280]  Well, they're going to have a bunch of wimps, folks.
[40:48.280 --> 40:51.280]  You can't put the troops in red high heels and have them learn how to be trannies.
[40:51.280 --> 40:53.280]  And I'm not bashing trannies.
[40:53.280 --> 40:57.280]  The point is that's not where trannies are supposed to be.
[40:57.280 --> 41:02.280]  This is all just a mentally ill joke.
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.280]  That they take away our basic rights and give us these faux rights.
[41:06.280 --> 41:09.280]  I'm going to get into this right now.
[41:09.280 --> 41:13.280]  So I'm going to get into fake news. I'm going to get into the leftist bullying.
[41:13.280 --> 41:20.280]  I want to break down the fact that their bullying went so far it caused people to basically rebel.
[41:20.280 --> 41:25.280]  And as they saw people start to wake up, they thought, oh, we better bully harder.
[41:25.280 --> 41:30.280]  Most people went along with political correctness just out of hospitality, just out of being nice.
[41:30.280 --> 41:35.280]  And it was done by increment early on with reasonable sounding things to set the precedent.
[41:35.280 --> 41:37.280]  But as it got over the top, people are done.
[41:37.280 --> 41:39.280]  They have broken with you.
[41:39.280 --> 41:41.280]  They will never listen to you again.
[41:41.280 --> 41:43.280]  There's no gimmick you can push that'll work.
[41:43.280 --> 41:48.280]  Even when the mainstream media tells the truth now, people don't listen to it.
[41:48.280 --> 41:50.280]  They do not believe it.
[41:50.280 --> 41:52.280]  You have self-immolated.
[41:52.280 --> 41:54.280]  You have blown yourselves up.
[41:54.280 --> 41:59.280]  You have poured five gallons of gasoline on yourselves and struck a match.
[41:59.280 --> 42:05.280]  And you didn't do it for a good cause, like a Buddhist monk.
[42:05.280 --> 42:13.280]  You did it for a bunch of disconnected, arrogant, corporate lackeys
[42:13.280 --> 42:20.280]  who thought they were going to shut down competition and show up innovation worldwide and play technocrat.
[42:20.280 --> 42:24.280]  Well, they may get their goal someday, but not without a hell of a fight.
[42:24.280 --> 42:26.280]  And it's hard to hold back innovation.
[42:26.280 --> 42:28.280]  It's hard to hold back people that want to be free.
[42:28.280 --> 42:33.280]  You may get 30, 40, 50% of people to be mind-numb, drooling zombies.
[42:33.280 --> 42:40.280]  But the 30, 40, 50% that aren't zombies are going to take action and wreck your world cupcake.
[42:40.280 --> 42:46.280]  If three or four percent of us take action against you politically and economically, we'll devastate you.
[42:46.280 --> 42:52.280]  But you're not facing three to five percent like you were in the Revolutionary War in 1776.
[42:52.280 --> 42:54.280]  1782.
[42:54.280 --> 43:05.280]  You are now facing, my friends, 30% that are hardcore away, who are now becoming confident, who are now reaching out to others.
[43:05.280 --> 43:06.280]  You cannot beat us.
[43:06.280 --> 43:07.280]  You can fight us.
[43:07.280 --> 43:11.280]  You can protract this for a long time.
[43:11.280 --> 43:15.280]  But incontrovertible, you have lost.
[43:15.280 --> 43:18.280]  You have failed.
[43:18.280 --> 43:19.280]  History shows it.
[43:19.280 --> 43:21.280]  The facts bear it out.
[43:21.280 --> 43:25.280]  Current analyses show it to be conclusive.
[43:25.280 --> 43:30.280]  The only way you can win is killing everyone in a giant nuclear war and releasing bio weapons.
[43:30.280 --> 43:31.280]  You can.
[43:31.280 --> 43:35.280]  The elite currently can still attempt to kill everybody.
[43:35.280 --> 43:36.280]  It's the only power they have left.
[43:36.280 --> 43:37.280]  Long term they'll lose.
[43:37.280 --> 43:43.280]  And as long as we don't let the technocracy flow get in place, so the elite controls it by computer and by robot,
[43:43.280 --> 43:50.280]  as long as we keep humans involved in the chain of command, the military is not going to let you do that.
[43:50.280 --> 43:51.280]  And I'm not saying they're angels.
[43:51.280 --> 43:52.280]  They're mercenaries a lot of them.
[43:52.280 --> 43:53.280]  They want money.
[43:53.280 --> 43:54.280]  They want power.
[43:54.280 --> 43:58.280]  But they don't want to piss on prosperity and hurt grandma.
[43:58.280 --> 44:00.280]  They're more than happy to kill jihadis and stuff like that.
[44:00.280 --> 44:03.280]  But they're not looking to mount America's head on the wall.
[44:03.280 --> 44:08.280]  And you've now picked fights with the people that do the hanging.
[44:08.280 --> 44:16.280]  One good part of that movie, Elysium, when the corrupt president is a bitching out her illegal mercenary commander,
[44:16.280 --> 44:25.280]  I could have you hung for what you've done, he goes, oh, it really stabs her out in the neck and he goes, we do the hanging around here.
[44:25.280 --> 44:27.280]  But there's all these disconnected wimps.
[44:27.280 --> 44:32.280]  These technocrats never killed anybody, never broke anybody's neck, never punched somebody's nose into their head,
[44:32.280 --> 44:34.280]  never done anything.
[44:34.280 --> 44:40.280]  And they just sit here shooting their mouths off at everybody about how tough they are and how they're going to dominate everybody.
[44:40.280 --> 44:41.280]  No, you're not.
[44:41.280 --> 44:44.280]  Bully.
[44:44.280 --> 44:48.280]  You're not even good at bullying.
[44:48.280 --> 44:55.280]  I've had people cussing me out in public, walking up, brandishing guns, you name it, since Trump lost in Austin.
[44:55.280 --> 44:56.280]  And guess what?
[44:56.280 --> 44:57.280]  They always run off.
[44:57.280 --> 44:58.280]  They show the gun and then run off.
[44:58.280 --> 45:00.280]  They drive by and cuss at me and then drive off.
[45:00.280 --> 45:01.280]  Some of it's on tape.
[45:01.280 --> 45:02.280]  I'm just standing there.
[45:02.280 --> 45:08.280]  I'm not going anywhere.
[45:08.280 --> 45:11.280]  That said, though, I'm going to go ahead and set it up and go with full time security.
[45:11.280 --> 45:17.280]  Not that I'm living in fear, but I have to go ahead and do it because, quite frankly, this is too important an operation.
[45:17.280 --> 45:19.280]  But that goes into expensing and things.
[45:19.280 --> 45:23.280]  And I don't want to cut back from what we do here in the operations.
[45:23.280 --> 45:32.280]  I want to bring in as much money as possible to throw everybody cold in that furnace we can to get this locomotive of freedom going as fast as it can at ramming speed.
[45:32.280 --> 45:36.280]  I want as much wind in our sales to take us as fast as we can.
[45:36.280 --> 45:45.280]  It's all about the wind, folks, and not winning because I want to be a, quote, winner, like some trophy from a football game, but really defeating the tyrants.
[45:45.280 --> 45:50.280]  And that's the epic holy grail opportunity that Donald J. Trump has right now.
[45:50.280 --> 45:51.280]  It's amazing.
[45:51.280 --> 45:57.280]  So here is a clip of Tim Allen, the man's man, just a good wholesome guy on a right wing and on a left wing.
[45:57.280 --> 45:58.280]  I love to get him on the show.
[45:58.280 --> 46:00.280]  We never tried, but let's try.
[46:00.280 --> 46:08.280]  On Fox, just saying there is no information on Trump.
[46:08.280 --> 46:11.280]  Everything they say about him, is it true?
[46:11.280 --> 46:15.280]  You try to go find the statements and it's always not what he said.
[46:15.280 --> 46:16.280]  It's taken out of context.
[46:16.280 --> 46:17.280]  It's twisted.
[46:17.280 --> 46:23.280]  And so the very people bullying everyone and are the ones saying that Trump is a bully.
[46:23.280 --> 46:24.280]  Here it is.
[46:24.280 --> 46:31.280]  So, Gigi Hadid mocking our next first lady, appropriate or not?
[46:31.280 --> 46:33.280]  I don't think it's appropriate in that venue.
[46:33.280 --> 46:37.280]  But again, this is a, I'm not a spokesman for Hollywood.
[46:37.280 --> 46:38.280]  I'm a comedian.
[46:38.280 --> 46:39.280]  Right.
[46:39.280 --> 46:44.280]  So I get to tour around the country and I do comedy and I do a show that leans, we have a point of view.
[46:44.280 --> 46:46.280]  Your character is a conservative.
[46:46.280 --> 46:48.280]  Point of view, but it's written by liberals.
[46:48.280 --> 46:49.280]  We have a liberal staff.
[46:49.280 --> 46:50.280]  That goes without saying.
[46:50.280 --> 46:51.280]  That's redundant.
[46:51.280 --> 46:56.280]  But we have a sense of humor about ourselves and there's a point of view and there's a place to do it.
[46:56.280 --> 47:01.280]  What I think is what I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn't like Trump because he was a bully.
[47:01.280 --> 47:06.280]  But if you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump, you got bullied for doing that.
[47:06.280 --> 47:12.280]  And that's where this, it gets a little hypocritical to me, is that you can now bully people.
[47:12.280 --> 47:20.280]  You're always on the defense with this, but mostly what I'm finding is there's no source material for comedians.
[47:20.280 --> 47:21.280]  That's it.
[47:21.280 --> 47:22.280]  There's no source material.
[47:22.280 --> 47:23.280]  There's nothing there.
[47:23.280 --> 47:26.280]  Bloomberg, again, on Sunday, put out a tweet.
[47:26.280 --> 47:27.280]  I couldn't believe it.
[47:27.280 --> 47:30.280]  It was just a made up tweet saying, yeah, I ripped off 6,000 young people.
[47:30.280 --> 47:32.280]  Yeah, I settled it big deal.
[47:32.280 --> 47:34.280]  Donald Trump quote tweeted.
[47:34.280 --> 47:36.280]  What the hell?
[47:36.280 --> 47:42.280]  I mean, when Donald Trump does stuff that's real, like, oh yeah, Snowden's a traitor killing.
[47:42.280 --> 47:43.280]  No, Trump, you're wrong.
[47:43.280 --> 47:45.280]  Or let him into an iPhone.
[47:45.280 --> 47:46.280]  Give him a warrant.
[47:46.280 --> 47:49.280]  They want the keys to all the iPhones, Trump.
[47:49.280 --> 47:50.280]  I mean, you know, he's got blind spots.
[47:50.280 --> 47:51.280]  We all do.
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.280]  But there's not much there after that that isn't BS.
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.280]  And that's what's frustrating.
[47:58.280 --> 48:01.280]  There's a lot of people running to me and go, he hates gay people.
[48:01.280 --> 48:03.280]  I'm like, okay, where's the quote?
[48:03.280 --> 48:06.280]  He did, he does.
[48:06.280 --> 48:08.280]  I quite frankly thought it was over the top.
[48:08.280 --> 48:11.280]  And he was like waving an LGBT flag at the R and C.
[48:11.280 --> 48:14.280]  And everybody in a clap said, we've got to be nice to all the gay people now.
[48:14.280 --> 48:18.280]  And the Republicans are all, yeah, I just thought it was like, wow, he's got conservatives doing stuff they never do.
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.280]  And then the left just says he hates gay people.
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.280]  I mean, it's the upside down level of it all that makes your head spin.
[48:27.280 --> 48:31.280]  I mean, if they got away with these lies, we'd really be in trouble.
[48:31.280 --> 48:33.280]  The lies blew up in their face.
[48:33.280 --> 48:35.280]  Hallelujah.
[48:35.280 --> 48:38.280]  Hallelujah.
[48:38.280 --> 48:40.280]  Trump's trying to unify people.
[48:40.280 --> 48:43.280]  But first, we've got to have a country to do it.
[48:43.280 --> 48:45.280]  Nobody's got open borders like this.
[48:45.280 --> 48:47.280]  They turn it into some personal attack.
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.280]  I can't just move to England or Mexico and just say, I'm here to have my baby free.
[48:51.280 --> 48:55.280]  They'd say, you're crazy.
[48:55.280 --> 48:57.280]  But you can come here and do it.
[48:57.280 --> 48:59.280]  You can go to Germany and do it.
[48:59.280 --> 49:01.280]  And again, they get the minorities in.
[49:01.280 --> 49:03.280]  They make them the majority and they wind them up to be racist.
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.280]  We've got to change all that.
[49:06.280 --> 49:09.280]  Federal judge came out and told a bunch of bitching illegals.
[49:09.280 --> 49:12.280]  You know, hey, if you don't like Trump in the president, go to another country.
[49:12.280 --> 49:14.280]  Don't come here and bitch about it all day.
[49:14.280 --> 49:20.280]  I don't like go to China and complain about their president, even though he's not even elected.
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.280]  What are the communist Chinese doing involved in our elections?
[49:23.280 --> 49:30.280]  Again, how did we get to this point?
[49:30.280 --> 49:34.280]  Now, speaking of bullying, we're going to break here in a minute.
[49:34.280 --> 49:35.280]  I'm going to come back and get into it.
[49:35.280 --> 49:38.280]  I want to get more into these quotes from Trump.
[49:38.280 --> 49:43.280]  The election is getting people uninvited to Thanksgiving.
[49:43.280 --> 49:48.280]  Americans say the idea of talking politics, Thanksgiving, and stressing them out.
[49:48.280 --> 49:50.280]  And it just goes on from there.
[49:50.280 --> 49:53.280]  I personally have been noticing this, seeing it.
[49:53.280 --> 49:56.280]  Everybody in the office says it's happening to them.
[49:56.280 --> 50:00.280]  And I want to make this point.
[50:00.280 --> 50:03.280]  I have hired Democrats before.
[50:03.280 --> 50:05.280]  I have thought we could wake them up.
[50:05.280 --> 50:09.280]  I have family friends and long-term friends that are liberals.
[50:09.280 --> 50:11.280]  I'm tolerant.
[50:11.280 --> 50:15.280]  I just think it's kind of a joke what they believe and how they've been caught.
[50:15.280 --> 50:16.280]  I'm nice to them.
[50:16.280 --> 50:23.280]  I have had people say, I'm not coming to your Thanksgiving, even though they've become other years because of Trump.
[50:23.280 --> 50:31.280]  And I have had friends of the family say, I'm not coming to visit you this Christmas because we're not friends anymore.
[50:31.280 --> 50:41.280]  And I mean people that I've known for over a decade that have told me, I'm sorry, I can't associate with you.
[50:41.280 --> 50:44.280]  Thank you for letting me know what type of person you were.
[50:44.280 --> 50:46.280]  I was tolerating you.
[50:46.280 --> 50:59.280]  And if this shows you're in a cult, because you're in a cult, folks, when you don't associate with somebody because you disagree with the Republican or Democratic views.
[50:59.280 --> 51:09.280]  You know, in the coming election, no matter who gets in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid.
[51:09.280 --> 51:11.280]  The potential for power grid chaos.
[51:11.280 --> 51:20.280]  EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid.
[51:20.280 --> 51:23.280]  My friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse.
[51:23.280 --> 51:29.280]  That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.
[51:29.280 --> 51:33.280]  Now I've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house.
[51:33.280 --> 51:35.280]  The solutions from science system.
[51:35.280 --> 51:37.280]  Simply put, this thing is amazing.
[51:37.280 --> 51:40.280]  Solutions from science only makes the best equipment.
[51:40.280 --> 51:42.280]  Go to powergridchaos.com.
[51:42.280 --> 51:45.280]  That's powergridchaos.com to check it out.
[51:45.280 --> 51:52.280]  Now if this is key, right now, get 70% off their top of the line perfect power solar generator.
[51:52.280 --> 51:54.280]  This is the one I use in my home.
[51:54.280 --> 51:59.280]  Go to powergridchaos.com and get 70% off.
[51:59.280 --> 52:01.280]  My name is Lee and I'm 41.
[52:01.280 --> 52:04.280]  I've been using One World Way for two and a half years now.
[52:04.280 --> 52:08.280]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc from a car accident three years ago.
[52:08.280 --> 52:16.280]  And since that time, I've been unable to walk long distances, do any minor lifting or just normal activities with my children without having severe back pain.
[52:16.280 --> 52:23.280]  Since I've started using One World Way, I've been able to walk more, engage in activities with my children and have less lower back pain.
[52:23.280 --> 52:27.280]  One World Way has helped me regain back my strength, confidence and have a healthier life.
[52:27.280 --> 52:33.280]  I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds, my A1C dropped two points and I have more energy now.
[52:33.280 --> 52:36.280]  One World Way has helped me regain back my life.
[52:36.280 --> 52:42.280]  The results for clients on One World Way have surpassed the results for most any other supplements as well as all other weight protein powders.
[52:42.280 --> 52:45.280]  One World Way is non-denatured and frequency encoded.
[52:45.280 --> 52:50.280]  We believe the frequency encoded increases your body's production of glutathione and energy production.
[52:50.280 --> 52:55.280]  Call 888-988-3325 or visit OneWorldWay.com.
[52:55.280 --> 53:16.280]  That's One World W-H-E-Y dot com.
[53:26.280 --> 53:29.280]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[53:29.280 --> 53:37.280]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol and how to survive in combat.
[53:37.280 --> 53:39.280]  Skills you'll need when it hits the fan.
[53:39.280 --> 54:04.280]  Go to DrivenDVD.com, DrivenDVD.com.
[54:04.280 --> 54:12.280]  By the way, I've even got some people in the office freaking out over the former head of the campaign, Conway, going on TV and saying,
[54:12.280 --> 54:16.280]  oh, Trump thinks Hillary's been through enough, he's not planning to go after.
[54:16.280 --> 54:25.280]  Well, it's not the President's job to prosecute people, it's the Attorney General he appoints and Jeff Sessions is the number one constitutional attack dog
[54:25.280 --> 54:33.280]  and that signals he's going to do the right thing and step aside politically and not be involved.
[54:33.280 --> 54:37.280]  Now, quite frankly, I think the Democrats are smart enough to understand something, so I'll say this.
[54:37.280 --> 54:43.280]  Trump doesn't want to be political, he doesn't want to violate the law, so he's stepping aside.
[54:43.280 --> 54:48.280]  But Trump is very justice-oriented, that means vindictive in their nomenclature,
[54:48.280 --> 54:57.280]  and it is my belief that he's going to step aside and let the AG and or state AGs as well go after Hillary.
[54:57.280 --> 55:05.280]  Now, he doesn't want to telegraph that because then what happens? Let's think, folks, who gives a pardon in the 58 days he's got left?
[55:05.280 --> 55:10.280]  Barack Hussein Obama.
[55:10.280 --> 55:14.280]  And then there's a pardon for Hillary.
[55:14.280 --> 55:22.280]  So they want to either let him do the pardon and force that out in the open, or regardless, they're going to go ahead with a strong AG.
[55:22.280 --> 55:29.280]  All Trump can do is put an AG in of high credibility and high moral standing, who always does what he says he'll do,
[55:29.280 --> 55:35.280]  and probably one of the most honorable people in Congress is Walter Jones or Jeff Sessions.
[55:35.280 --> 55:45.280]  Congressman Jones and Jeff Sessions are known for doing exactly what they say they'll do to a compulsive level like Ron Paul.
[55:45.280 --> 55:53.280]  I mean, it's compulsive because I'm the type of guy that does what I say I'm going to do, but if things really change and it's going to hurt somebody if I do what I said I'll do,
[55:53.280 --> 55:57.280]  I'll try to explain to them, hey, I think we should do something different. Those guys won't even argue it.
[55:57.280 --> 56:03.280]  They'll just do it no matter what. Very dogged is the way I would describe it.
[56:03.280 --> 56:10.280]  You talk about attack dogs, I mean, this is it, like a bunch of hounds going after, you know, a wolf or whatever.
[56:10.280 --> 56:20.280]  So it's on. It's on. And they know that. And I would expect Trump to not be sitting there poking Hillary and poking Obama.
[56:20.280 --> 56:26.280]  And here's the deal. I was told over a week ago by multiple sources. I talked to another source there by those.
[56:26.280 --> 56:33.280]  He checked and said, yeah, that's dead on. Chelsea is over there. Chelsea's been meeting with Trump's daughter,
[56:33.280 --> 56:42.280]  oldest daughter and Christian's wife and is just begging, please don't indict my mommy and my daddy.
[56:42.280 --> 56:49.280]  And the word is then the Democrats will leave Trump alone if they win in four or eight years and they'll do the same cover your butt program.
[56:49.280 --> 56:53.280]  Well, you know what? Trump doesn't need that. Trump isn't going to run a corrupt ship.
[56:53.280 --> 56:57.280]  Trump really runs things by the book, has top law firms certify everything.
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.280]  He's firing all the lobbyists right now, again, delivering on every promise.
[57:02.280 --> 57:10.280]  So this is a big deal. It's a big deal. You know, I said I'd get into the bullying and we're going to do that when we start the next hour.
[57:10.280 --> 57:20.280]  Because all over the country, people I know, staff here, I mean, multiple crew members are not having Thanksgiving with their parents.
[57:20.280 --> 57:25.280]  They're not having Thanksgiving with their children. Maybe I can get some of them to actually come on here.
[57:25.280 --> 57:29.280]  I didn't ask one of them yesterday if we want to tell a story on air. And I mean, I know his parents, too.
[57:29.280 --> 57:38.280]  They're nice people, man, but they are flipped out. Especially one guy's mom is to the point that she didn't.
[57:38.280 --> 57:42.280]  I mean, I know people aren't getting out of bed folks. We're talking almost two weeks into this and people are in their beds.
[57:42.280 --> 57:50.280]  I mean, this is this is crazy. This is crazy town folks because they really believe a guy that loves Hitler just got elected.
[57:50.280 --> 57:55.280]  They believe all the crap and they're the minority, but they are susceptible.
[57:55.280 --> 58:00.280]  And I'll tell you who they mainly are. It's white people. The really weird stuff I'm getting from white people.
[58:00.280 --> 58:06.280]  Mainly white liberals and baby boomers who just they've always been the heroes their whole lives.
[58:06.280 --> 58:09.280]  They were fighting the right wingers. They were fighting the, you know, this and that.
[58:09.280 --> 58:18.280]  And they just are heroes in their minds and they have no respect for anybody else or their views or their opinions.
[58:18.280 --> 58:25.280]  I've had two different people I know who I've never even seen, but you know, who are I just invite to come over because I don't do a lot of entertaining.
[58:25.280 --> 58:30.280]  But I do around Christmas and other holidays on like 50 people in my house sometimes and they're like, oh, we're not going to be coming.
[58:30.280 --> 58:36.280]  I'm like, all right. And then I get another email, you know, because Trump, you understand, right?
[58:36.280 --> 58:41.280]  I'm like, oh, don't let the door hit you on your ass out the door.
[58:41.280 --> 58:50.280]  I am pretty darn reclusive. And I only have people around like twice a year or, you know, here and there for my kids to have pool parties, whatever.
[58:50.280 --> 58:53.280]  Electrify your day with Secret 12. It's like lightning in a bottle.

[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:33.280]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:41.280]  So, the Republican Party was going to be extinct. I wouldn't care if it was all those blue blood scumbags up there.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.280]  But no, the Paul Ryan Party is going extinct. And who else is going extinct? It's Democratic Party.
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:57.280]  Get Daniel's article up on InfoWars.com. So, he just joined us. I was getting into people I've known for a decade, people I've known for longer than that.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.280]  And you just tacitly, a couple of times a year, oh, hey, we're going to have a Thanksgiving party the day before or whatever.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:11.280]  You're welcome to come over. We're going to grill steaks or whatever. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just too upset about the Trump thing.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:16.280]  Great. You just need to say you're not coming over. But thank you for letting me know. You don't like me.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.280]  I guess you see me as a winner or whatever. God forbid you get your taxes cut.
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:29.280]  And like I said, I've got multiple crew members who are not going to have dinner with their parents who are baby boomers because it's just too uncomfortable.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280]  And they're told, by the way, if you're coming over for Thanksgiving, keep your mouth shut.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:37.280]  Well, you know what? We're just not coming over to Thanksgiving.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:41.280]  And so, during the next break, I'm going to go ask some of these folks they want to come on and talk about this.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:46.280]  And I want to open the phones up specifically on two topics.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:51.280]  Now, I don't screen the calls. That means you can disagree or agree, but I do get on topics sometimes.
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:55.280]  So here's what I'd like you to call in on and this only.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:02.280]  Are you upset about Conway going on TV and saying Trump's not going to go after Hillary?
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:09.280]  That's not politicking. That's not lying because technically the president isn't the one that does that. It's the attorney general.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.280]  The president needs to be hands off now so that this isn't a...
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.280]  I mean, it's impressive to say she should be in jail. She should be locked up.
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:22.280]  She's a criminal during the debates on TV dozens of times. That's why we love Trump.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:28.280]  Now, the guy that'll do that publicly, do you think he's really going to back off Hillary?
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:33.280]  No, there's going to be a new inspector investigation.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:37.280]  Special prosecutor. There's going to be AG investigations.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:43.280]  No matter if they try to block the confirmation over racism made up crap on Jeff Sessions, Senator Sessions.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.280]  But regardless, maybe you think there is a problem with that. I'd like to hear from you on that subject.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:50.280]  That's number one. Number two, this is just as important.
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:57.280]  Have you had liberals, fascists that have hijacked word liberal, get in your face over Trump winning?
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.280]  Have you had your boss get in your face, your employees get in your face?
[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.280]  Have you had people threaten you like I have?
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.280]  A guy brandish a gun, show me his gun, threaten me in a parking lot.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.280]  I was like, what the hell is your problem, dude? That happens Saturday.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:20.280]  Have you experienced this bizarreness and have you had family say, hey, if you're coming to Thanksgiving, keep your mouth shut?
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.280]  I mean, I have crew members, two of them told me.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:28.280]  I know one of my parents was like, yeah, you better not talk about politics if you come, okay?
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.280]  Just, you know, mom's real upset right now.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.280]  So promise me you'll keep your mouth shut.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.280]  Yeah, I think I'll be coming over.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.280]  How insulting is this?
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.280]  But again, they believe in their cosmology, it's okay.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.280]  This has never before happened in modern history.
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.280]  What happened to us as a country?
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:49.280]  I want to hear from you about just this incredible backlash, this mental illness that's in the news.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:53.280]  I mean, they're actually reporting, but I'm witnessing it.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.280]  The election is getting people uninvited to Thanksgiving.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.280]  USA Today.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:04.280]  Trump and Clinton supporters are getting uninvited from Thanksgiving dinners because of their political views.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:12.280]  I don't know anybody that's conservative saying liberals can't come over, we want you to come over so we can deprogram you.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:16.280]  The thing is, you don't want to hear it from us because you're the intellectuals that listen to Rachel Maddow,
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:24.280]  who wears ironic glasses and has a neck that resembles an ostrich.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.280]  People keep thinking Rachel Maddow's a man.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:29.280]  I think it's an ostrich.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.280]  I don't know, just a joke.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.280]  And then I've got more fake news discovered.
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.280]  Michael Zimmerman pointed this out to me.
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.280]  It's incredible.
[01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:40.280]  That's coming up on the other side as well.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.280]  The toll-free number to join us.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.280]  800-25-99-231.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.280]  800-25-99-231.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.280]  And then we've got Margaret Howe.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.280]  And we've got Joe Big's coming in with a bunch of huge news straight ahead.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:59.280]  And Kanye West has been hospitalized for supporting Trump.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.280]  Late document shows Trump does actually plan to build a wall.
[01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.280]  1989 Miles' plan for Rapid Build.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.280]  Article up at infowars.com.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:15.280]  Kansas Secretary of State Chris Kobach, an expert on border security and legal immigration, met with Trump on Sunday in New Jersey.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:21.280]  Kobach was holding a file of papers, one of which was snapped by a media photographer from a distance.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.280]  It is entitled Department of Homeland Security Kobach Strategic Plan for first 365 days.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:34.280]  Zoomed in, the paper reads that in addition to 386 miles of existing wall, there's a further 1,989 miles plan for Rapid Build.
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:41.280]  According to Trump's past statements, the total length of the wall wouldn't need to run the whole 2,000 miles of the border due to natural barriers.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:47.280]  The document flies in the face of claims by Hillar supporters and media opponents that Trump's promise to build a wall was just hot air.
[01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:53.280]  At the start of the year, left-wing website Crooks and Liars Snark will Trump supporters hate to break into you, but there's not going to be a wall.
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.280]  Well, guess what? We're getting that wall, baby.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.280]  Woo! This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.280]  A way to produce their own supply of backup electricity.

[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:28.280]  Alright, we're about to take your phone calls at 800-25-99231 on the report out of USA Today that I personally am witnessing myself.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:34.280]  I have friends, I have family that have been uninvited to Thanksgiving, uninvited to Christmas.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  I have crew members, just parents I know that are nice people, but are so brainwashed that they've said, hey, maybe you shouldn't come to Thanksgiving if you're going to bring up politics.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:47.280]  Which means they bring it up, you sit there and take it.
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:51.280]  This is happening, and I've had people threaten me on the street.
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:58.280]  I had a guy follow me out of a restaurant and brandish his concealed carrier. I don't know if he had a license for it, but he did it.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.280]  And I was just like, I didn't even say anything to him. I'm like, what are you doing?
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.280]  He thought he was scaring me. As soon as he noticed I wasn't scared. I'm mouth hanging up and he ran around the corner.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:11.280]  But this is the mental illness these people are involved in.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:16.280]  I've been dehumanized. You've been dehumanized. We don't count now.
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:19.280]  So they can act however they want, whenever they want.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:25.280]  And that's why Trump understands you can't grovel to these people anymore. That only encourages them.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:33.280]  So he invited a whole bunch of media executives, including the head of CNN, Zucker, to Trump Tower.
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.280]  President-elect Slam's smug media in face-to-face Trump Tower meeting.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:44.280]  We're in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media, who got it all wrong.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:50.280]  That's infowars.com. Here is the New York Post. Donald Trump's media summit was an effing firing squad.
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:58.280]  Well, they are traders. Donald Trump scolded media big shots during an off-the-record Trump Tower sit-down Monday.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:03.280]  Sources told the Post it was an effing firing squad, one source told The Encounter.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:11.280]  Trump started with CNN, Jeff Zucker. He said, I hate your network. Everyone at CNN is a liar. You should be ashamed, the source said.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:17.280]  The meeting was a total disaster. Trump went on to say, I hate you.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:27.280]  You know what Trump says to patriots on the phone? I love you. It's just so real, folks.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:34.280]  Oh, it went an upside-down world where the president calls me and says, I love you, keep it up, you're doing a great job.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:41.280]  You're going to cut those taxes and make America great again. Oh, just wait, Alex.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.280]  That's why the elite are crapping themselves. We were already the greatest country in the world.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:51.280]  We had about the 90s, half the world's wealth, and most of it was in the middle class.
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.280]  We already lost like 15, 16% of that. By the mid-50s, it was like 80%.
[01:10:55.280 --> 01:11:00.280]  And so I could get the argument, hey, we're like too rich. Let's help people around the world.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:06.280]  That's how they sold good people on globalism. But that's mid-level. At the high level, it's about austerity worldwide, making us poor too.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:17.280]  We're going back to Americanism, not globalism. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:21.280]  And it just continues. I'm sorry.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:30.280]  It was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in their thinking. They would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:35.280]  But instead, they got a Trump-style dressing down the sources added.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:42.280]  And what's great about this is the most arrogant of them was Wolf Blitzer, who got on TV a week and a half ago when Trump went to D.C.
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:50.280]  And said, he doesn't tell us his itinerary or where he's going. This is outrageous. I won't stand for this. I'm filing a complaint.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:58.280]  So Trump said, will you come on to Trump Tower, sweetheart? Walked him in there and said, listen, you little sniveller, protocols all over.
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:06.280]  I'm the president. I'll go eat where I want. I'll do what I want. And I'm not going to tell you where I'm going for my safety. What the hell does that mean?
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:12.280]  Do you think it's safe for us to always say where we're going? The Secret Service for decades hasn't wanted to tell the press itinerary.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:21.280]  You're not in the driver's seat anymore. Nobody listens to you. Nobody respects you. The small audience you have hates my guts and hates the American people's guts.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:30.280]  So understand this. I'm here to tell you, I know you're a piece of crap and I hate you. Now get out of my office.
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:40.280]  Trump reportedly, because I've told people that we're there screaming at these people. The real Donald Trump. Wouldn't you love to see that?
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:48.280]  They lie about his family. They lie about America. They lie about us. They put fake quotes out. They stir up race war. They stir up, well, cops are getting killed.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:58.280]  That's their fault because, you know, cops are bad. These are outrageously evil people, folks, and you got to dress them down.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:04.280]  The only hope they've got is that the executives get it through their head and realize they're going to totally collapse if they don't stop.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:11.280]  The problem is they're so committed to globalism and so committed to crony monopoly systems that they're not going to stop.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:22.280]  So we have to fully withdraw all support from them at any time we speak of them, even covering an article. We say the traitor, deceptive, evil media, the fake media.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:31.280]  The name they tried to, I've looked for the ultimate name, not prostitutes, not decepticon media, not collaborator media, not enemy media,
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:42.280]  not corporate media, not deceiver media, not UN media. Why didn't I see it? The fake media. The name they've got the president pushing and the communist Chinese pushing
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:49.280]  and all the world telling us we're fake, we're dumb, we elected Trump, oh, we're so stupid, oh, we're such big idiots, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:59.280]  Fake media, fake media, fake media, fake media. They're the fake media. We're the completely real media. We don't lie about stuff.
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:07.280]  It's like the fake media came out. Like, let's get that report. I want to play that coming up from Ron Paul, shocking fake news exposed by Ron Paul.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:15.280]  And he goes, exactly what we've said. It's mainstream media that's fake, that lied us into the wars, that lies about all this other garbage.
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:26.280]  It goes on and on and on. And now Kanye West, they used to call Kanye or Kanye West, gets out and says, hey, Trump hadn't really done anything.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:33.280]  Let's give him a chance. He had such a backlash from his idiot supporters that he quote, oh, he's gone into a mental institution.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:40.280]  He's had a mental breakdown. That's how they always do it. Oh my gosh. That's what his executives have told him. We are so close folks.
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:47.280]  This whole damn breaking, this whole damn falling of bullying and control. Joe Biggs has just run into the control room.
[01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.280]  He's got some breaking news for us, Joe.
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:58.280]  Well, no, I wanted to comment on what you were saying really quick. I tweeted out yesterday, someone who witnessed real Donald Trump chewing out the line media Trump Tower today said it was like an effing firing squad.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:08.280]  And Anthony Kumi wrote back to me and made a really good point that I thought I'd bring up. It says, notice how the media has to create this Nazi image of Trump lining up media personalities and shooting them.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.280]  They can't stop effing them.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:15.280]  That's right. And look, they have lied about him. He wouldn't be real.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:23.280]  Listen, when CNN calls here now and my producer goes, listen, they've been begging. They really want you on. I go get on the phone and I say, is it going to be live?
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.280]  No, Mr. Jones. Or the lion say, yeah, it's live.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.280]  And then an hour before they call back and go, actually, it's going to be taped.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.280]  And I go, nope, I'm only going to be on their lives. You're not going to edit me. And they'll start being real arrogant.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:46.280]  Listen, you're a pack of liars. I know you are. Go to hell. In fact, there's behind the scenes footage of me on CNN one time. The last time I was on like five years ago or three years ago with what we actually taped versus what went on air.
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:56.280]  Biggs, come back here real quick. He's in there. The controlman ran off. You're coming on in about an hour and 15 minutes with a Margaret. What are some of the topics you're going to be breaking down?
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:06.280]  We're going to talk about some more in depth stuff about the media coming in and basically just being told off by Trump. Some of our inputs on that as well.
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:14.280]  Ron Paul calling out the fake media, giving his list. And the Kanye West thing. I think the Kanye West story is kind of a big deal.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:28.280]  Because you think about it, he is one of the most followed people on Twitter. He's this darling child for the New World Order and people use him as a tool to kind of brainwash these kids. And he kind of comes to this realization point where he goes, you know what, maybe he's not that bad.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:38.280]  You know, if I would have voted, I would have voted for Trump. Let's give him a chance. And then within an hour, this guy all of a sudden has this nervous breakdown and the doctors put him in a psychiatric ward.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:48.280]  I mean, I don't get that. That's so weird because the last thing we need is someone with that many followers who could really mold a lot of young minds. The last thing we need is him talking about how he's pro Trump.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:59.280]  Sure. They're sending the message that you must be mentally ill. If you finally go, it's a hoax, like Tim Allen said. He hasn't done anything. There's no source material. It's all made up.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:03.280]  Thank you, Joe. We'll talk to you coming up the bottom of the next hour.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.280]  But the good news is, Democratic Party going stink admits Democratic rep.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:16.280]  I'm going to go to some of your phone calls here in a moment and we go to the bottom of the hour. And when Owen Schroyer joins us, we'll continue with your phone calls.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:23.280]  I'm going to get to a huge fake news story that Michael Zimmerman heard them talking about on local radio this morning.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:29.280]  He went and checked it and found out as usual, it is a total and complete lie.
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:39.280]  So that's coming up at the bottom of the hour. I'm going to go to one of the writers. They should probably blurb this or write about it because I told you we're going to set up a whole section on exposing fake news on info wars.com.
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:48.280]  A new section, a new tab on the right hand side that you can click on. It'll be a page of videos and articles, both video reports and article reports that break down fake news.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.280]  And let me tell you, there's plenty of it. And guess who's actually doing MSM.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.280]  And here's the example. The Daily Beast. That's Newsweek.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.280]  Texas Republicans want to out LGBT kids in school.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:11.280]  Now you read the article. You read the bill. It's two different things entirely.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:20.280]  There is no mention of sexual persuasion, of sex, of gay people, of anything in here.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:28.280]  There is, there is zero, zero, zero information. Guys, I had the full bill. Yes.
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.280]  I'm going to print that for me again because I had it right here.
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:36.280]  Now it's actually a wiki leak. I just picked up. I can't keep track of all this anymore.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.280]  And it's incredible. You read the bill and it has nothing to even do with that.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:48.280]  I mean, the lying, but again, you've got to make your group persecuted so you can then tell people who the bad guys are.
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:56.280]  They're trying to get you. And what it's actually says is that if your kid tells the teacher,
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:00.280]  thinking about committing suicide or something, that the school's allowed to contact the parents.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:04.280]  Well, of course they should be able to do that. But see, there's a lot of stuff going on in these schools
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.280]  where kids are being recruited into all sorts of weirdness. Satan worship, you name it.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:14.280]  And they don't want those kids to be able to talk to their parents or they don't want teachers to be able to talk to parents.
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:20.280]  So they don't want the school, the good people in the school to talk to parents about what's going on.
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:24.280]  There's a real agenda here. And if you read Salon and other liberal publications, they say,
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:30.280]  oh, it's time to legalize pedophilia. It's loving. Nambla is loving.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:36.280]  And we should just go along with all this.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:43.280]  So there's something very deep and very dark here about this fake news agenda because they don't want you having context
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.280]  of what's happened to your children. And they don't want you having contact with your children.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:50.280]  They want to cut you off from your children because as Melissa Harris Perry said,
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:53.280]  your kids belong to the state, not you.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:20:15.280]  We'll be right back on all the shows your phone calls are straight ahead.

[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:03.280]  My name is Lee and I'm 41. I've been using One World Wave for two and a half years now.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:08.280]  I suffered a bulged L4 and L5 disc from a car accident three years ago,
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:14.280]  and since that time I've been unable to walk long distances, do any minor lifting or just normal activities with my children
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.280]  without having severe back pain.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:22.280]  Since I've started using One World Wave, I've been able to walk more, engage in activities with my children, and have less lower back pain.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:27.280]  One World Wave has helped me regain back my strength, confidence, and have a healthier life.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:33.280]  I've noticed a weight loss of about 20 pounds, my A1C dropped two points, and I have more energy now.
[01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.280]  One World Wave has helped me regain back my life.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:42.280]  The results for clients on One World Wave have surpassed the results for most any other supplements as well as all other weight protein powders.

[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:35.280]  Coming up, I'm going to get into huge fake news, put out with the Democrats as usual.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:42.280]  I've got the bill here. It has nothing to do with gays, or sex, or anything.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:48.280]  It allows teachers to talk to parents, which they should always do, but people are suing over that.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.280]  They want to cut off communication. It says nothing about it.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.280]  But look at the headline on the Daily Beast.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:01.280]  Texas Republican wants to out LGBT kids in school.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.280]  No, the Democrats want to get sexually involved with kids that want to bring sexualization in
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:14.280]  and form sexual relationships and sexual cultures with kids. They have a name for it.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.280]  Just read the WikiLeaks.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:22.280]  James in Florida is up next, but first, Pete. Pete in California.
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280]  You're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.280]  Good morning, Commander.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.280]  Hey, brother.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:34.280]  Say, about Hillary, I guess this is more of a question than an opinion.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:42.280]  But what, if Hillary is put, if she's prevented from, or if she's given a pardon by Obama,
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:47.280]  is she prevented from testifying in another investigation?
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:53.280]  Because, I mean, I think this investigation should go down to the bottom
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:58.280]  and go after all these people that have been involved with her over the years.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:02.280]  Well, I've checked the law. I've checked what past presidents have done.
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:06.280]  It is believed that a president can do a 360 pardon,
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:12.280]  not only for ongoing investigations, not for ongoing criminality.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.280]  And the foundation is an ongoing criminal enterprise.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:20.280]  And so I believe that it can always be reopened because the crime machine is ongoing.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:26.280]  And not even a presidential pardon can pardon an ongoing criminal operation.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:30.280]  Well, that's good to hear. I mean, I think this really needs to be exposed
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:35.280]  and exposed well to the American people so they see everything that's happening.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.280]  That's now with the mainstream media and so forth. Everyone's trying to cover it up.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:43.280]  I think it really needs to come out into the open.
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  I hardly agree with you. The issue here is, Trump isn't involved in this now
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.280]  because it's not his job. He's called for it. He's trying to put an attorney general in
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.280]  who you can bet your bottom dollar is going to go after Hillary.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:59.280]  So if Conway's going around on TV saying, oh, he wants to leave Hillary alone,
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:03.280]  she's been through enough, let's move forward, let's bring the country together,
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:07.280]  that is political to try to heal the country.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:11.280]  And that is the position of someone that's trying to be a peacemaker,
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:14.280]  a classic female trait. Okay, fine.
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.280]  The issue here is justice must be done.
[01:27:17.280 --> 01:27:22.280]  And so if he puts an attorney general in that sits on top of FBI investigations
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:26.280]  or things like that, then I'm going to get moody pissed.
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:30.280]  But I don't think it's going to happen with Senator Sessions. Great points, Pete.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.280]  James in Florida, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:37.280]  Hey, Alex, how you doing? Good, my friend.
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.280]  Good, I just wanted to say, I was upset when I first heard the news
[01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.280]  what Kellyanne Conway had said, but after thinking about it for a while,
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:47.280]  it makes a lot of sense that he is hopefully just kind of playing possum,
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.280]  playing politics, trying to avoid the pardon.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  And then, you know, we'll see what happens when he gets into office.
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.280]  Really, like you said, it's not his duty to go after her personally.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.280]  So it's probably a pretty smart political move.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:03.280]  Well, I mean, exactly. If he goes after him himself, that will get her off
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:05.280]  because he's not supposed to do that.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:11.280]  Look, the signal of Jeff Sessions, you couldn't have put somebody better, okay?
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.280]  Who's proven they'll go after people.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:17.280]  So it's on. It's on.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.280]  And I'm not putting Conway down from her perspective.
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:23.280]  It's true that is not Trump's job now.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:28.280]  It's justice is separate through the AG who will be appointed by the president
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:32.280]  but confirmed by Congress or nominated by the president, confirmed by Congress.
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.280]  And so he wants to get sessions in.
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:38.280]  But watch, they're going to fight Sessions. Chuck Zimmer is sworn to fight Sessions
[01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:44.280]  like it's the end of the world because they know it is high noon in Dodge City, baby.
[01:28:44.280 --> 01:28:47.280]  And there's a new sheriff in town with Jeff Sessions.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.280]  Absolutely. And I just got one other point.
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:54.280]  You know, all of us that we were called deplorables, you know, it's really bothering me
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:59.280]  that they keep the mainstream media keeps trying to frame us as so-called white nationalists
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:03.280]  and all right. And they have pictures of Nazis, you know, saluting or whatnot.
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:07.280]  And, you know, most of us are not Nazis. I'd say so.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:09.280]  I think we need to reject that. We need to correct it.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:13.280]  We can't go by the terms that they put on top of us because otherwise we lose, I think.
[01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.280]  Well, plus they're discredited.
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.280]  And so when someone calls you a name, you're not.
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:23.280]  And usually they're the ones pushing race themselves, not because they even believe in it
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:25.280]  because it's a control system. They're race pimps.
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.280]  They're not even only races. They're just using race and racism to control.
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.280]  I mean, look at Jared Kushner.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:36.280]  I mean, the guy is one of the most prominent Jewish families in America, billionaires,
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.280]  you know, in the free market and in real estate.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:42.280]  And he's one of Trump's favorite people, one of his top advisors.
[01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:47.280]  I mean, you've got, okay, so this guy's anti-Semitic, but he's married into Jews and his top advisor is Jewish.
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.280]  I mean, just know this floats. It's all BS.
[01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:52.280]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:30:21.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:51.280]  We're on the march.
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:59.280]  This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:26.280]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:43.280]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:52.280]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:18.280]  I started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:22.280]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:29.280]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:36.280]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:42.280]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.280]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:50.280]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:37.280]  Listen to this part of the guitar, right here from Deep Purple. This is Vladimir Putin's favorite band.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.960]  See you give me orders right now. Yeah, no because we like the same man
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:47.200]  We're both you know both telepathically connected. He's saying let it play he's saying that I'm not just connected to Trump telepathically
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:53.480]  I'm it's what it's my power. I'm not really a broadcast. That's a big cigarette. What's that part right there? Frank it up
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:57.320]  That's a joke folks
[01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:05.260]  We don't talk telepathically we do it with a telephone you like rock and roll Alex. I love it
[01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:07.660]  Hey, I tell you man
[01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:14.300]  You can see that good always takes the day as long as it takes action. It always comes from behind. It's biblical
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:17.220]  It's historical. It's a cycle. There's a lot of bad stuff happening
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:23.700]  We're a long way from being out of the woods, but I gotta tell you big huge victories are taking place right now
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:25.380]  Yeah, it's great
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:30.820]  And the biggest victory is the freak out of the mainstream media and the liberals and we're seeing it everywhere
[01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:32.820]  they want to call us fake news and
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:35.500]  The one thing that I heard from
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:42.060]  Trump and he was scathing the people at this meeting yesterday apparently he says you're the enemy you're a bunch of scum
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:45.740]  Exactly, you know what and you know what that was I was thinking about this Alex Donald Trump
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:52.940]  Bless his heart did what everybody listening to this broadcast wishes that they could have done for the last 10 20 years
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:59.900]  Get all of the mainstream media in the same room and then tear them a new you know what I mean
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:04.900]  I I'm jealous that Donald Trump got this opportunity. I'm actually envious, right? I mean he got this party
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:09.220]  I'm already in this one. He said yeah, yeah, I mean here was my favorite one
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:15.140]  I can just imagine he's talking to these reporters and he's like yeah, you know, I was listening and they got it wrong
[01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:20.540]  You got it wrong the election coverage. You got it wrong and apparently we have the quotes
[01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:25.580]  It's I hate you. You're a bunch of liars CNN. You're the worst one a bunch of I mean he tore the day
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:32.260]  Alex refers to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost and hosted a debate a clearly said
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:35.380]  I hate your network. Everyone at CNN is a liar. You should be ashamed
[01:35:36.900 --> 01:35:42.220]  Don't you wish you had the opportunity to say that right? Well, he knows they have no audience the small audience
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:43.780]  They have or like the middle patients
[01:35:43.780 --> 01:35:50.380]  I remember when I got in when I got in back of a CNN broadcast and I called out Don Lemon
[01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:56.740]  I said Don you read all the teleprompter Don's reading all the teleprompter and Jake Tapper was sitting off to the side shooting me
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:00.940]  This dirty look like how dare you how dare you disrupt our broadcast?
[01:36:00.940 --> 01:36:06.700]  I'm Jake Tapper and I take tapper we have racial attacks against minorities by white Trump supporters
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:10.500]  We don't have any proof in the congressman goes well. Here's all the videos the wife being attacked
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:13.020]  He goes, why are you bringing up race and then the congressman laughs? He goes?
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.460]  This is what you brought up. What the hell? I mean, it's like upside down land man
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:23.020]  Well, and then of course you've got the people who will say oh don't talk to me about white people dealing with anything as you provide
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:27.220]  Massive videos of people being attacked because the white but actually for the nightly news
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:31.700]  I'm gonna take a segment from Don Lemon last night and we're gonna break it down
[01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:34.100]  He he tries to foment a race war
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:39.900]  He tries to say that anybody with the alt-right is a racist and a Nazi and again with no proof
[01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:44.200]  He just says it matters. It's total fake news pushing for sedition in the country
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:47.340]  But what's great is we pointed it out Paul Watson pointed it out
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:54.600]  The fake media is the corporate media caught lying about Iraq the wars about Trump about the economy about the open borders
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:59.320]  They're the fake news media and so now the name they gave us is now their official name
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.160]  The MSM is the fake media the dying media the dinosaur fake media that they're full title
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:07.880]  It's kind of an imperial title is the
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:15.000]  Collaborator disgusting prostitute discredited traitor collapsing dinosaur fake
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:22.520]  Propaganda propaganda corporate fraudsters. Yeah, and so they but it's gonna be longer like you could go on all day
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:27.160]  I'm a Roman Emperor. I mean, it's an Alinsky tactic though, right to get out in front of your opponent
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:31.080]  So they call us fake news. Oh, they knew the pedophile stuff was coming out on the on the Clintons
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:35.640]  So they just have these fake lawsuits and then it turned out fake women every time wasn't even real
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:40.680]  Oh, it's totally fake and they're all dropped. Oh, and he wants to get the Jews. That's why I see advisors a Jew
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:43.560]  What's wants to get the Jews?
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.920]  Son-in-law he hates women. That's why he's married multiple women and Kelly and Conway successfully
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:51.080]  Managed his campaign first ever. Yeah, he hates women though
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.560]  Has his daughter. What do you make of the point that Tim Allen made that you look you bullies are bullying everyone about Trump
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.880]  But I go to the source material. There's nothing there. He really said you just lie. Well, it won't matter
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.240]  I mean, this is the same. This is the same hypocrisies that we've been calling out
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:11.240]  You've been calling out for years and then you've had this story that came out today from the Daily Mail
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:16.800]  These Hamilton actors and actresses that lectured Mike Pence essentially
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.840]  I mean, it wasn't the worst thing that you know, they weren't that
[01:38:20.040 --> 01:38:26.400]  You're paying you're paying 50 bucks or or yeah to go hear them and then it's a mainly black cast
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.000]  You're going to see a black cast
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:33.680]  Support them then they bet you and call you a racist Pence takes the high roads as I lie. It's I'm fine with it
[01:38:33.680 --> 01:38:38.000]  No big deal turns out most of them didn't even vote. Exactly. They talk about it
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.600]  I mean, if you're not gonna vote don't bitch about the results of the election
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.640]  You didn't vote you have it shows. It's all about it's just like they people virtue signal
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:52.560]  There's six times less likely to give the charity and studies and I they tell you all day how you should give money
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.320]  And you know that these protesters
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:39:00.320]  I mean if we could get a percentage of how many of them voted, you know that it wouldn't be probably even 90 probably under
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:05.000]  8070 I mean, who knows how many of these people even voted they don't they're not even from the city
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:13.160]  It's like what was it 35% of people arrested 70 something in in Seattle and Portland others. They hadn't even voted
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:19.080]  Well, Alex, I've got a stack of news. You've got they were paid. They were paid. How do you decide? They were paid
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.120]  They were paid be there. Well, yeah, there's George Soros paid protesters
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120]  Who also has given
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:28.960]  $11,000. Have you seen the video the three surface? I couldn't find it for years where he admits
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:34.720]  He was a Nazi collaborator and they said you feel bad. He smiles. It gets happy and says no, I picked the winning side
[01:39:35.160 --> 01:39:36.320]  What?
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:42.560]  He said it was the guy lecturing us that were anti-semitic. He said it was the brightest time of his life is what he said
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:49.120]  So he gets an ADL award. Yeah, and then he's I mean is the ADL not a frickin joke
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:53.200]  Bankster hedge fund manager. He's got all this influence at one point in time
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.000]  It was said he had more influence than the United States government
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:00.400]  So who knows, you know, it's weird. He looks like Emperor Palpatine
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:07.480]  But him and Hillary Clinton both look like Emperor Palpatine the bags under the eyes the domineering death stare
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:14.360]  He is Emperor Palpatine. He does get these with my training. You will come to the dark side
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:18.960]  Feel the power of hate. That's how fun to do that
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:25.120]  You do it but bankrupt the economy you flood the nation with Islamists
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:27.280]  What do you think about this for fake news Alex? Remember?
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:32.840]  It wasn't even an hour after Trump won and they were announcing that stocks were crashing them
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:35.280]  Well, they tried to crash them. Yeah, but here we go
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.760]  And so within five hours it reversed biggest stock market in history
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.080]  CNBC stocks mostly higher hitting all-time highs
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:49.320]  Telecoms rise 2% so there you go. Just like after Brexit the economy actually takes off
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:55.520]  What do you know you get a corrupt government off of your back, you know, Alex we've had a totally managed economy
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:01.520]  He's signaling what was a fair wildcat. I was talking to the people in accounting the other day
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:03.840]  And she was she you know
[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:08.920]  She was saying how she gives them a she gives the people on the phone a hard time because of how much money they take out of
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:14.240]  Our taxes. I'm like even even in our accounting department folks. We're fighting the info war
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.200]  Even the people in our accounting department are fighting the good fight
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:23.640]  Sick of the federal government taking thousands and thousands of dollars out of our paychecks every time around
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:30.320]  I mean, it's it's and that's the thing about these protests and the big bankers that want bigger government have written the laws with their tax exempt
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:36.000]  It's like, oh, you only got 50 billion dollars, bro. Meanwhile, if I hire people, I'm paying 40% federal tax
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  I was thinking about this Alex
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.840]  So we had four police officers shot on Sunday too fatally, right?
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:50.500]  And nobody even knows their names because the media didn't humanize them except Donald Trump who actually called the family of the slain
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:55.640]  San Antonio police officer nothing from Obama Trump did call but here's what I was thinking Alex
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:42:01.280]  So we had black lives matter protests in the streets after Mike Brown was shot
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.920]  You know, we've we've had these protests now going on for two years, right? Okay, so I'm thinking
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.520]  What what is the opposite side of the spectrum?
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:15.440]  What if there was a blue lives matter protest or a cops live matter protests and all the police officers decided to protest?
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:16.840]  You know what would happen?
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:21.600]  Society would actually have to change. You know why because police officers contribute to society
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:27.160]  Okay, so all of these protesters can protest all day long and nothing is gonna happen
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:34.200]  Society doesn't have to take notice because they don't contribute to society in mass if police officers protested
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:41.760]  If police officers went on strike that would influence society because they contribute to society and let's be specific because this always turns into a
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.240]  You know zero some game where we got to pick sides. There are problems with police
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.320]  There's corruption everywhere, but they're the lowest level of government
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:54.960]  We're supposed to change the top to change the problems there not let George Soros some bastard collaborator
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:43:00.720]  Globalist come in and foment a civil war directing all our anger with the government on to them
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:05.120]  It's a total scapegoat and admitted sigh off and only an idiot would be part of it
[01:43:05.120 --> 01:43:09.760]  And just like you've been saying police officers are starting to wake up quicker than most people
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:13.520]  I used to be a bigger critic until I until I saw that they were the ones actually listening
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.320]  It's the weirdest thing and don't you know, okay? Well, you're awake. What's going on good?
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.920]  Don't you want the police officers to be on your side if if you know what hits the fan?
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:27.240]  I mean don't we want good police officers who want to continue to be brave continue to maintain their oath to protect and serve
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:32.520]  Absolutely, and I was at most cops that they're always, you know a post-it letters to the editor from the police unions
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.040]  They don't want to just write tickets all day. They want to go help people
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:42.120]  And there are some cities that run it right and just run right enough tickets to pay for the revenue and don't try to always expand or jack stuff up
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:45.280]  Joe Travis County Sheriff's Department has been that way now
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:50.080]  They've got a really badly reconquista as you know as the head of it who says she won't deport any illegals
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.880]  Well, it's already gotten to the point where they can drunk drive and hurt whoever they want
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:44:00.080]  I'm not against people period, but you can't just drunk drive and then be let go because you're illegal because the sheriff isn't gonna prosecute you
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.240]  But I want to go to some phone calls and go to some of this other news
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:08.280]  But so much happening here that needs to be mentioned. Have you because I've been asking callers are calling on this. Nobody has yet. I
[01:44:09.880 --> 01:44:12.800]  Don't want to name names. I haven't talked to some of the folks who are in the office that told me about it
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.160]  I didn't think to ask them yesterday and this morning
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:17.200]  two people
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.200]  Right back there in that office
[01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:21.400]  Had their parents tell them
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:26.480]  Don't come to Thanksgiving if you're gonna bring up politics. So they're like, we're just not gonna come and it's another person's brother
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:32.720]  Just basically makes fun of us makes fun of him doesn't want to associate with them because he's a mainline conservative
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:38.120]  Not one of those Trump guys and it just shows how they buy into mainstream media and think they're cool
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:45.280]  Because they're on the trendy side when all you are are people that have been totally conned. Why don't you want lower taxes?
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.920]  Why don't you not want war with Russia? Why don't you want to sit out ship in jihadis?
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:55.440]  Why don't you want there to be a border Obama has ordered the drones turned off on the southern border in the last 58 days
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:45:02.240]  It's sabotaging our country the country is seeing 300% the illegals flooding across putting many of them Muslims jihadis
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:09.360]  You name it and they're saying imminent terror attacks, but the borders wide open. I mean, this is insane
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:15.360]  This is out of control. So our virtual border that that he says we have so no wall is needed
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.720]  I agree a real virtual border would be all we needed that's been turned off. Nobody turns their border off
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:25.800]  This shows this instinct to assault our country and they shut down the s2
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:32.300]  Area which was a route that a lot of people were coming in they've completely stood down on that route one of the most trafficked
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.240]  Trafficked routes and they're saying we don't we don't even know who's giving these orders
[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:39.600]  We assume it comes in the White House, but we don't even know but back to your Thanksgiving point
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:44.880]  I remember Thanksgiving and Christmas last year talking to my family and there's it's it's a mix
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:52.040]  I would say between conservatives and liberals and but pretty much everyone laughed at me at Thanksgiving and and I was
[01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:57.080]  Laughed at Thanksgiving and there were a couple that came over by Christmas 30 people basically laughed at me just laughing
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.600]  And you know you talk about this trouble never get the nomination
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.360]  How do we react? We just sit there and smile and laugh like I know what you're wrong
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:07.440]  I'm right. I know I do this 18 hours a day like all the top pollsters
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.880]  You know more than me though because you saw a report on Fox or something laughing and culture over a year ago
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:17.040]  You know, who do you think out of 14 people running as Republicans is it just oh Donald Trump and everyone laughed?
[01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:32.920]  I know that there may have been one or two of my family members in my extended family that voted for Clinton
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:37.040]  Maybe I'm not sure if they did. Oh, listen, I had people over and I'd say let me guess you heard that on MPR
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:42.320]  They go, yeah, how do you know I go? I've heard it word for word. I know the script. Let me guess you watch him as NBC. Well, yeah
[01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:46.240]  I mean, he's crazy. You'll never be uh-huh. It's like this. It's like this
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:50.720]  Thing without any facts. Well, it's sad though. He was already in the lead
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:57.580]  He had the most money and in clothes the other guys were were boobs. He was real. He was real
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:03.640]  I am just sick. I'm so sick of how I'm right like 98% of the time and no matter how many times
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.200]  I'm right or house or how I change the entire media paradigm or what I do
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:12.640]  People that have done nothing never have any respect for me. Now high-powered folks have massive respect. I'm up
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:17.400]  It's crazy how winners know how to respect other people and listen these people listen to anything
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:22.720]  You mean you built a news empire by yourself. Well, I did with the help of the listeners and it is an empire now
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:25.840]  It's small but my god 80 plus million viewers during election week
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:28.200]  So our new low is 40 million a week
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:36.120]  It's it's sad though to think that people will be separated for Thanksgiving over politics and of course my family there
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:39.600]  They'll invite me. I'm not worried about that. I'd sad to hear that there's others around here
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:43.480]  but it kind of shows the hypocrisy again where
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:47.880]  Well, it shows family that many things and it shows the states there God
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:52.600]  They're in a cult folks only a cult tells you you can't see your family now
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:58.120]  That's what calls to and isn't the left liberal. I mean, aren't they supposed to be open to other ideas?
[01:47:58.120 --> 01:48:03.280]  Aren't they supposed to be willing to have the edgy or the conversation that takes you out of the comfort zone?
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.280]  I mean, that's what a liberal is the fact that they want to totally shut you out
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:10.280]  The fact that they basically they want to censor you from dinner
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.200]  I mean, they want to censor their look at all the comments on us today and stuff where they people are like
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:16.920]  Yeah, my dad's uninvited me, you know my dad
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.000]  Because I he saw my Facebook. He's like I'm like a little Nazi police officer
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.280]  I noticed you did not vote for Hillary. Well, you are not well
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.560]  Let me tell you my dad ever did that to me. It'd be ten years till I talked to him again
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:32.640]  And I don't mean that meanly you this this is this is dishonorable
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:35.240]  What in the hell?
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:38.120]  And here's the story, you know notice wiki leaks stop releasing stuff
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:42.820]  I wish that had just gone out there. We're going if people voted wrong, but I mean well Kim dot com
[01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:45.680]  What are you gonna do folks when it comes out there deadline kids, huh?
[01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:50.200]  Kim dot com said he thinks that there's gonna be a big email drop or leak before
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:55.320]  The inauguration and usually I agree. No, I think he's got the he's got the ear please Kim dot com
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:56.280]  He wanted to come on me one day
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.200]  I was out doing something and I guess he didn't want to come on with other hosts
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:04.320]  But whatever only Kim dot com back on great guy. Oh, yeah, he they need to launch the thermal nuclear weapons
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:07.300]  They need to release it just so the hit this people with their goddess
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:12.720]  Knee deep in pedophilia. You name it reportedly so they'll come out and send it though
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.880]  There's a story on Washington Post
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:23.280]  It's called to Americas and it breaks down all of these cases of families that are basically being blacklisted from Thanksgiving or Christmas
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:29.520]  Grandma's and granddaughters not getting along with one another. It's all very sad. I mean we could sit here and talk about it
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:32.720]  But you know what it is. I think we should just let's let's hear from the callers Alex
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:36.520]  Absolutely, we're gonna break in a minute go to calls and we've got Charles in New York
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.760]  Those says coping with Hillary supporters because I've asked people calling on that
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:49.800]  So, so let's see if he's on that topic Charles. Welcome. Okay, thank you very much, Alex. Welcome. Go ahead
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.400]  Okay
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.040]  Encoping with people that believe that Hillary Clinton should have elected president
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:04.160]  I I find it the best way to answer is to say that she was the right sex America is ready for a female president
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:06.160]  it just happens that the
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:08.200]  Democrats chose the wrong candidate and
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.080]  because
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.040]  Trump wasn't attractive as a as a male
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:14.880]  opponent
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:17.600]  People have resented that very much, but I usually say
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:19.840]  What?
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:23.360]  Candidate would you have preferred to have voted for if she was a female?
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.400]  Let's say Merrill Streep against Hillary Clinton
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:35.040]  Who would you vote for or in the case of a woman that would lie to the families of the of the ambassadors and the victims of Benghazi?
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:39.640]  When they came home and and and she lied to them to their face
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:45.120]  Exactly. She stole the nomination and by the way, that's in the WikiLeaks. I'm gonna cover that when we come back
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:48.560]  She stole the nomination from him. And so again, it's all a fraud
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:53.720]  We will not certify your fraud and at the cult of Hillary Clinton. Thank you Charles great points. We'll be back

[01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.620]  maybe you shouldn't come to
[01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:03.940]  Thanksgiving or you know, please don't bring up politics and I was telling you some of the stories
[01:55:03.940 --> 01:55:06.740]  I personally have experienced well, this is unprecedented
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:10.500]  And again, these are people defending Hillary Clinton
[01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:15.460]  Imagine if they had a Democrat who wasn't a crook then you could maybe argue some of this
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:19.460]  But it's just crazy how they doubled and tripled and quadrupled down this lady

[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:27.460]  We've got some video clips coming up as well
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:32.020]  But before I go to Stephen, Ohio and others the
[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:35.140]  Tyrants have really gotten us conditioned even though we're somewhat upset. I
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:42.580]  Should be more upset about the border totally open illegal shipped in the smuggling process completed for a permanent underclass
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:49.540]  People try to come here legally they make it really hard to do so you just do it illegal and then now Obama orders
[01:56:49.540 --> 01:56:53.900]  The drones all turned off which is a constitutional role. They said he has the drones on us
[01:56:53.900 --> 01:57:00.020]  So you're saying that we've got a government right now. That's deteriorating our border, which is essentially our country
[01:57:00.020 --> 01:57:05.020]  You've been saying that for years and then also on the heels of all these Thanksgiving stories now
[01:57:05.020 --> 01:57:11.260]  The family is being torn apart, which you've also been saying for years and that is fomented by the media
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:14.660]  So I guess your fake news turns out to be real somehow Alex
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:18.100]  I don't know how that works out, but we're seeing it right now
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:23.620]  You're not allowed to go to your Thanksgiving dinner if you're a Trump supporter in some of these families
[01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:29.900]  And why is that because the media has conditioned people to believe that you are a racist a neo-nazi a
[01:57:30.660 --> 01:57:36.780]  Homophobe you hate women whatever it is. We know all the narratives and now you're not allowed to go to your family's Thanksgiving dinner
[01:57:36.780 --> 01:57:41.380]  I'm sorry for the families that are experiencing this. I'm glad that my family is not that way
[01:57:41.380 --> 01:57:46.340]  Well, listen if your family's gone bad and they're the type of trash I would be proud of not go
[01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:50.380]  Yeah, you just wouldn't want to go. That's what we got to continue via the libertarian
[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:58.380]  Constitutional Trump movement to have meetups and have groups and just form our own families of every color race and creed that are common sense
[01:57:58.380 --> 01:57:59.540]  That's your family
[01:57:59.540 --> 01:58:00.060]  Yeah
[01:58:00.060 --> 01:58:03.900]  In fact, if you know anybody out there that's been shunned by the liberal family in bottom of your Thanksgiving
[01:58:03.900 --> 01:58:05.540]  And you really need to do that anyway
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:10.900]  Just get an emergency preparedness family that's in your area. I mean go to your neighbor's house say hey look
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:12.580]  Do we have ammunition? Do we have food?
[01:58:12.580 --> 01:58:16.540]  Do we have water if something goes down and we can't communicate with people that are far away?
[01:58:16.540 --> 01:58:21.380]  I need to have people that are local here that I can communicate with and make sure that we've got a survival plan
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:26.660]  So it's like a it's like a win-win Alex. That's it. We're going to break them back with Steve and others
[01:58:26.660 --> 01:58:32.020]  I haven't gotten to this yet. I promise it like it after I'll get to it. We caught him in some huge fake news
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:39.380]  This is some of the biggest fake news ever third hour 70 seconds away spread the word they hate this broadcast
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:43.860]  They hate it when you spread the word. We're kicking their butt in war, but it's a war. Send the videos out
[01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:47.660]  Keep the wave going. We're just starting to win

[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:22.060]  It's been a good move
[02:00:22.060 --> 02:00:27.060]  You like to come to the beach with a pima colada and a cigar
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:35.060]  Problem is I ever start really taking vacations. I'm gonna just be gone. I'm gonna say Owen David Knight
[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:40.060]  Bye-bye, you're in charge pull lots and enjoy yourselves
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:43.060]  You'd come back gravity would bring you
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:47.060]  I don't know man, you know, I'm like either either I'm doing it Rob do is at my house this weekend
[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:53.060]  So like 10 or 11 every night with his four kids with a baby on his on his on his leg
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:01:00.060]  Well, his wife hung out with my family at an event and the girls over there and he was over there every night
[02:01:00.060 --> 02:01:05.060]  We were like shooting hours of live videos. Yeah, you and I just couldn't stop you're a madman. No, no, it's not bad
[02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:10.060]  I was like it was like 11 o'clock because we should probably do another one and like and like he's got his baby girl
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:15.060]  I said a swiss little girl with a fire fire going outside and speaking of I met she walks over she was fired
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:19.060]  He was gonna have fires her house was like epigenetics. She was just saying fire
[02:01:19.060 --> 02:01:24.060]  Maybe some of these liberals need to experience a fire a bonfire starting it with their own hands lighting it
[02:01:24.060 --> 02:01:31.060]  Cooking something trying to ban that. Well, yeah, it's killing. It's killing us, you know, Rob do you're just popping in souls McBreen
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:33.060]  We're gonna go to calls I
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:40.060]  Was talking about you and some other people in in the office that aren't going to Thanksgiving because you've been admonished to keep your mouth shut
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:42.060]  Right
[02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:50.060]  Well, that's that's partly true before the election happened my wife and I decided we were gonna take the family out to a late cabin
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:54.060]  Just to be with the family because with the election going on. I've been gone a lot
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:59.060]  Haven't really seen the kids haven't hung out with the kids and we're just like let's just make a long weekend out of it
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:03.060]  And get away from this and we didn't even know who was gonna win we decided to do this at the end of September
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:09.060]  But after the election I was told by two family members that our house is a no politics zone
[02:02:09.060 --> 02:02:13.060]  We're not talking politics and so whatever I don't care
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:21.060]  Either way if Hillary won I would have been the same way I would have been like go let's go after Hillary and and what Trump let's see what
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:28.060]  What Trump does right now? I'm pretty happy with what he's been doing and I agree with most America that I think it's 96% said they're hopeful
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:34.060]  I'm notice how fast it's flipping and all the polls on them. Yeah, so the stock market stuff. Oh, he's really doing he said he do
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:39.060]  He's gonna kill the TPP he's gonna look all this stuff was illegal Obama did outside of Congress
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:43.060]  That's why Trump can turn it off because it wasn't even done properly
[02:02:43.060 --> 02:02:48.060]  They're like Francis like you just can't do that as president really how do Obama do it without Congress
[02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:55.060]  I love that one how they just say oh it's too late we already signed it we already decided well no we're deciding now
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:03:00.060]  So your decision plus legally we really can't get out of it it was never ratified
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:08.060]  That little piece of crap Halan is gonna anyways dude. Yeah, I mean I was just stalking your story and several others don't want to come on here
[02:03:08.060 --> 02:03:11.060]  This is personally happening to me where folks go look I'm not coming over cuz of Trump
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:21.060]  No, I totally believe that I've seen it on social media and Facebook people are having flip outs and hey, you know what to each his own as far as I'm concerned
[02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:26.060]  You know, it's like this Hamilton thing people are getting so overblown about it
[02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:34.060]  I personally think it's not that big a deal and we admonish the SJW is for like crying about little things like this and then we're crying about somebody being
[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:42.060]  Like talked to and he wasn't even that rude. I don't think he was rude for what he said at the at the event and I think hey let's welcome dialogue like this
[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:46.060]  Well, notice we're telling you guys it's boring if we argue or confront somebody
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:49.060]  Oh, I know but when they do it from the stage when you've paid to see them that's okay
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:56.060]  But that's actually a that's actually a good point that you make Rob because people who are saying don't come to my dinner because of your politics
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:01.060]  They're censoring their own life. I mean that's the left censoring you need to talk more at this point
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:09.060]  We need to open dialogue and I truly believe that that is how things are going to change in this country because look hey
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:14.060]  Half the country didn't vote for Donald Trump or those who voted I guess I should say so
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:20.060]  By the way, Hillary stole five states. We need to hammer that down. I agree and now we're saying oh it's up by 1.7 million votes
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:24.060]  And I'm like hey, let's start looking at these votes. Let's check ballot images
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:27.060]  Let's look at registered voters with total number of votes cast
[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:29.060]  Look, they tried it's over 100%
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:32.060]  They failed, they are super upset
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:36.060]  Yeah, thank you Rob do let McBreen pop in about his brother that makes big jokes about us
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:40.060]  And thanks for all the big joke and then we will look at but he's from a conservative man
[02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:45.060]  He's one of these Ted Cruz type guys, you know Fox News said Trump was a cook so
[02:04:45.060 --> 02:04:47.060]  George Bush was good
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:50.060]  George Dubby Bush is my daddy
[02:04:50.060 --> 02:04:53.060]  He was my daddy before he was his daddy
[02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:54.060]  He was a Texan
[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:57.060]  Cook Texan, he's from Australia
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:05:21.060]  The platypus is from Texas
[02:05:28.060 --> 02:05:40.060]  The total length of the wall wouldn't need to run the whole 2,000 miles of the border due to natural barriers
[02:05:40.060 --> 02:05:44.060]  The document flies in the face of claims by Hillary supporters and media opponents
[02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:47.060]  Trump's promise to build a wall was just hot air
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:50.060]  At the start of the year left wing website Crooks and Liars Smart
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:53.060]  Well Trump supporters hate to break it to you but there's not going to be a wall
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:55.060]  Well guess what, we're getting that wall baby
[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:58.060]  This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com

[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:52.060]  Replacing older or more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job

[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:30.060]  I had a sort of other crew coming in today
[02:08:30.060 --> 02:08:32.060]  To host part of the next hour with me
[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:34.060]  But Rob does a piece of work
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:36.060]  Who wants to talk about their parents?
[02:08:36.060 --> 02:08:38.060]  I love his parents, I know them both
[02:08:38.060 --> 02:08:40.060]  But his dad a lot more than his mom
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:42.060]  And so I was like hey you did say they were basically saying
[02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:44.060]  Watch your mouth or don't come
[02:08:44.060 --> 02:08:46.060]  He goes alright alright alright I'll get to it you're right
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:48.060]  But he goes but I'm going to point something else though
[02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:50.060]  That you were wrong about
[02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:52.060]  I saw the first hour of last night's show
[02:08:52.060 --> 02:08:54.060]  So what am I wrong about dude I don't know yet
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:58.060]  Yesterday you said BBC has a $1 billion budget
[02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:00.060]  Here it is it's actually $3.7 billion
[02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:02.060]  You were wrong Alex
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:04.060]  So you underestimated again
[02:09:04.060 --> 02:09:06.060]  You were conservative again
[02:09:06.060 --> 02:09:09.060]  I was pointing out on Quantcast we're way bigger than them
[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:10.060]  Oh I know I know
[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:12.060]  And they're like only internet globally
[02:09:12.060 --> 02:09:14.060]  So we're bigger than the BBC
[02:09:14.060 --> 02:09:17.060]  And our budget is like $40 million or whatever
[02:09:17.060 --> 02:09:18.060]  Exactly yeah
[02:09:18.060 --> 02:09:22.060]  I was just pointing out that you always underestimate things
[02:09:22.060 --> 02:09:25.060]  When you know you're talking about the deaths and what not
[02:09:25.060 --> 02:09:27.060]  But here it is you were $2.7 billion
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:30.060]  They have $2.7 billion more than you thought
[02:09:30.060 --> 02:09:32.060]  My memory said something like $3 billion
[02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:35.060]  I just automatically said it's like a billion dollar
[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:37.060]  Maybe $3 billion I said check it out
[02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:40.060]  And actually last night I was watching the first hour of the show
[02:09:40.060 --> 02:09:43.060]  And which by the way the crew did an amazing job
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:46.060]  In that first hour yesterday
[02:09:46.060 --> 02:09:48.060]  Because I don't really sit and watch the show like
[02:09:48.060 --> 02:09:51.060]  As a spectator as a person watching it
[02:09:51.060 --> 02:09:54.060]  But it was really nice to see what these guys have did
[02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:56.060]  And I'm like I'm gonna fact check him on this
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:58.060]  $3.7 billion wow
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:01.060]  They have that much money and we're still beating them
[02:10:01.060 --> 02:10:03.060]  That's what's so amazing is that
[02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:05.060]  Well it's scary though to see the POTUS
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:06.060]  A hundredth of that
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:09.060]  The lame duck possum running around saying
[02:10:09.060 --> 02:10:11.060]  Fake news must be shut down worldwide
[02:10:11.060 --> 02:10:12.060]  That's their answer
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:14.060]  But they don't have the POTUS
[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:16.060]  And the POTUS just the new POTUS
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:19.060]  He just the great orange toad
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:21.060]  And he just called them into his office
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:23.060]  And shoot them out and said you're liars
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:25.060]  You're a joke get out of my office
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:26.060]  I hate you
[02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:28.060]  And they are the most butt hurt people right now
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:30.060]  There was pictures of them walking out
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:32.060]  And like Wolf Blitzer just looking like
[02:10:32.060 --> 02:10:34.060]  You know he'd just seen a ghost
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:35.060]  And Lester Holt kind of
[02:10:35.060 --> 02:10:37.060]  He's got Clark sharing Hillary drinking champagne
[02:10:37.060 --> 02:10:38.060]  Like a boob
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:40.060]  Yeah these guys are losers and they needed to be called out
[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:42.060]  And they totally deserved to be called out
[02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:44.060]  For the way they've been treating the American people
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:46.060]  For the last 30 years
[02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:48.060]  Now again a bunch of people don't want to come on air
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:50.060]  Don't come or you know watch what you say
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:52.060]  But I mean tell me what you really told me
[02:10:52.060 --> 02:10:54.060]  After the election it came out
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:56.060]  And I have yet to speak
[02:10:56.060 --> 02:10:58.060]  To a couple of my family members
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:00.060]  But it was told to me the houses will be
[02:11:00.060 --> 02:11:02.060]  No politic zones
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:04.060]  Which I think Ellen got it right though
[02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.060]  I said it's going to be no your politic zone
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:08.060]  Yeah it's a censor your politic zone
[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.060]  Yeah you sit there and you take it
[02:11:10.060 --> 02:11:12.060]  And they're going to sit there like Rachel Maddow
[02:11:12.060 --> 02:11:14.060]  And lecture you and again they're reaching out
[02:11:14.060 --> 02:11:16.060]  Saying by the way don't come here and talk
[02:11:16.060 --> 02:11:18.060]  Say stuff it's like okay I'm not
[02:11:18.060 --> 02:11:20.060]  Yeah but we had already planned
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:22.060]  To go somewhere else and I can't wait to go
[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:24.060]  Hang out with the family for a few days
[02:11:24.060 --> 02:11:26.060]  We're going to leave the electronics at home
[02:11:26.060 --> 02:11:28.060]  I don't know how that's going to work out
[02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:30.060]  Because my kids love those
[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:32.060]  Freaking iPads and
[02:11:32.060 --> 02:11:34.060]  But let me tell you
[02:11:34.060 --> 02:11:36.060]  Thanksgiving is a time to get together with your family
[02:11:36.060 --> 02:11:38.060]  And if for some reason your family doesn't want to
[02:11:38.060 --> 02:11:40.060]  Get together with you then just
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:42.060]  Make your circle a little smaller and
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:44.060]  You know don't feel bad about
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:46.060]  Because I'm going to tell you
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:48.060]  There's something wrong with people that
[02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:50.060]  Blood is thicker than politics
[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:52.060]  If you're I mean I let liberals around me
[02:11:52.060 --> 02:11:54.060]  That I've known forever
[02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:56.060]  Because hey you know they're still people
[02:11:56.060 --> 02:11:58.060]  I can see their point of view
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:00.060]  But they're the ones that are
[02:12:00.060 --> 02:12:02.060]  I mean that's all I hear about is they're the ones saying
[02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:04.060]  We don't want to be with you as if it hurts you
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:06.060]  As if they want to teach you something
[02:12:06.060 --> 02:12:08.060]  I'm kind of like I don't really want to hang out with you anyways
[02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.060]  I'm never going to talk to you again bye bye
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:12.060]  I get into fights with my family
[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:14.060]  My aunts and uncles I mean like cats and dogs
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:16.060]  Will fight politics and religion
[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:18.060]  But at the end of the day we're still family
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:20.060]  We can still break bread together
[02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:22.060]  You know I still want to eat a meal with you
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:24.060]  I don't hate you just because we have different politics
[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:26.060]  So this is sad to me but this is the
[02:12:26.060 --> 02:12:28.060]  This is the conquering of the family
[02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:30.060]  That you've been talking about for so long
[02:12:30.060 --> 02:12:32.060]  Oh yeah they really teach you to fight with your family
[02:12:32.060 --> 02:12:34.060]  Alright thank you Rob do
[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:36.060]  And forward to Natalie News director thank you my friend
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:38.060]  Alright thank you Alex and hey I love my family
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:40.060]  But if you're going to talk politics to me
[02:12:40.060 --> 02:12:42.060]  Come on that's all I'm going to say
[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:44.060]  And you'll do it to five million people
[02:12:44.060 --> 02:12:45.060]  Ah I do suffer
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:46.060]  Sure
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:48.060]  How dare you speak out with the Donald Trump as a
[02:12:48.060 --> 02:12:49.060]  Razzles
[02:12:49.060 --> 02:12:51.060]  Alright let's bring Darren McBrain in here
[02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:53.060]  Now McBrain has a very nice brother
[02:12:53.060 --> 02:12:55.060]  But he also polices him on Facebook
[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:57.060]  And that's what people are saying in the USA today
[02:12:57.060 --> 02:12:59.060]  That oh my dad saw my Facebook post
[02:12:59.060 --> 02:13:01.060]  And now he won't talk to me
[02:13:01.060 --> 02:13:03.060]  You know I'm sorry
[02:13:03.060 --> 02:13:05.060]  I might lose my daddy
[02:13:05.060 --> 02:13:07.060]  Daddy loves Hillary
[02:13:07.060 --> 02:13:09.060]  So McBrain your brother likes to make jokes doesn't he
[02:13:09.060 --> 02:13:11.060]  Well to be honest Alex
[02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:13.060]  I have two older brothers
[02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:15.060]  But they don't acknowledge me
[02:13:15.060 --> 02:13:17.060]  On Facebook or on YouTube
[02:13:17.060 --> 02:13:19.060]  If these guys made a
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:21.060]  Five minute video about how to change oil
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:23.060]  In a Ford pickup truck
[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:25.060]  I would watch it just to see how they're doing
[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:26.060]  Or whatever
[02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:27.060]  But these guys
[02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:29.060]  These guys do not
[02:13:29.060 --> 02:13:31.060]  Anything I do on Facebook
[02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:33.060]  They just don't acknowledge it
[02:13:33.060 --> 02:13:35.060]  So and I talked to my brother
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:37.060]  Like about a month ago
[02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:39.060]  Before the election
[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:41.060]  And
[02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:43.060]  This is the first time we actually talked about politics
[02:13:43.060 --> 02:13:45.060]  He says who are you going to vote for little brother
[02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:47.060]  And I was just surprised that he didn't know
[02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:49.060]  Because it's all over Facebook and YouTube
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:51.060]  I'm pretty wide open as far as
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:53.060]  Who I'm voting for
[02:13:53.060 --> 02:13:55.060]  And I said Donald Trump
[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:57.060]  And he says Donald Trump's a clown
[02:13:57.060 --> 02:13:59.060]  And I said alright fair enough
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:01.060]  Who are you going to vote for
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:03.060]  And he says I'm not voting for anybody
[02:14:03.060 --> 02:14:05.060]  This is the first time he was not going to participate
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:07.060]  In the election
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:09.060]  And then I started talking
[02:14:09.060 --> 02:14:11.060]  About how Info Wars has made
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:13.060]  An incredibly big impact
[02:14:13.060 --> 02:14:15.060]  On the Trump campaign
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:17.060]  As we have been to all these Trump rallies
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:19.060]  And it was just amazing
[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:21.060]  All the people that were there
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:23.060]  It seemed like and I think Joe Biggs
[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:25.060]  Is seeing it everybody that went to these Trump rallies
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:27.060]  I know Owen Shroyer he's seen it as well
[02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:29.060]  Every fifth person
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:31.060]  Had an Info Wars shirt on
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:33.060]  Every tenth person there was a group of ten people
[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:35.060]  With Info Wars shirts on
[02:14:35.060 --> 02:14:37.060]  And I told my brother we're making a huge impact
[02:14:37.060 --> 02:14:39.060]  On this campaign
[02:14:39.060 --> 02:14:41.060]  And he says no offense little brother
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:43.060]  But I don't see how that's helping him too much
[02:14:43.060 --> 02:14:45.060]  It's like
[02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:47.060]  My family
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:49.060]  A large portion of my family
[02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:51.060]  I think they picture us as fake news
[02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:53.060]  And they picture us like we are
[02:14:53.060 --> 02:14:55.060]  You know we're in our mother's basement
[02:14:55.060 --> 02:14:57.060]  Doing internet blogs
[02:14:57.060 --> 02:14:59.060]  Let's talk about this because
[02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:01.060]  There are certain people in life
[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:03.060]  That think if they get the cool parking spot
[02:15:03.060 --> 02:15:05.060]  At the Yacht Club
[02:15:05.060 --> 02:15:07.060]  Or they're invited to some cool
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:09.060]  Organization
[02:15:09.060 --> 02:15:11.060]  Or they're the head of the country club
[02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:13.060]  The head of Bushwood
[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:15.060]  The third gambling's illegal at Bushwood
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:17.060]  They think just being part of that
[02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:19.060]  Is why they've arrived
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:21.060]  And that's a
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:23.060]  These organizations and groups
[02:15:23.060 --> 02:15:25.060]  They're just all about giving each other awards
[02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:27.060]  And all this crap and I'm sure your brothers are nice guys
[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:29.060]  Plus you're the little brother
[02:15:29.060 --> 02:15:31.060]  These salesmen will tell you
[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:33.060]  Family's the hardest group to sell
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:35.060]  But they sit there and they get so incredibly arrogant
[02:15:35.060 --> 02:15:37.060]  I've had family do this
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:39.060]  Until they finally click and all their neighbors
[02:15:39.060 --> 02:15:41.060]  Are like I'm sorry you're right
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:43.060]  And they just can't imagine
[02:15:43.060 --> 02:15:45.060]  That you've actually gone out and trailblazed something
[02:15:45.060 --> 02:15:47.060]  And so they think fox news or whatever
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:49.060]  That's God
[02:15:49.060 --> 02:15:51.060]  And Megan Kelly she's making jokes about Trump
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:53.060]  So that must be
[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:55.060]  You know the highest order of things
[02:15:55.060 --> 02:15:57.060]  Let me give people the news flash
[02:15:57.060 --> 02:15:59.060]  We were as big as Fox News
[02:15:59.060 --> 02:16:01.060]  Election Week
[02:16:01.060 --> 02:16:03.060]  Now their numbers have gone down some too
[02:16:03.060 --> 02:16:05.060]  But our new plateau is 40 million views a week on the web
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:07.060]  Not counting threshold radio
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:09.060]  We're talking 45 million, 50 million people
[02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:11.060]  Conservatively now
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:13.060]  Now they go oh but your views don't count
[02:16:13.060 --> 02:16:15.060]  When it's our views it's big
[02:16:15.060 --> 02:16:17.060]  And splendid and huge
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:19.060]  It's this delusion of people
[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.060]  That still think
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.060]  Like ooh I saw a clip of you on CNN
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:25.060]  I'm like whoop dee doo their average show's got
[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:27.060]  200,000 viewers
[02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:29.060]  I mean I could fart in the wind and have that many viewers
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:31.060]  On a video at home
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:33.060]  And again I'm not bragging about me
[02:16:33.060 --> 02:16:35.060]  I don't sort of say how big we are
[02:16:35.060 --> 02:16:37.060]  Drudge is like five times bigger
[02:16:37.060 --> 02:16:39.060]  On overall views than Fox News
[02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:41.060]  You never hear that the media is like drudges over
[02:16:41.060 --> 02:16:43.060]  Drudges it's the same deal they just keep making
[02:16:43.060 --> 02:16:45.060]  These delusional announcements
[02:16:45.060 --> 02:16:47.060]  But it's not the case but notice
[02:16:47.060 --> 02:16:49.060]  You should call your brother invite him on the show
[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:51.060]  And say hey big brother
[02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:53.060]  Did you notice that
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:55.060]  You know help Trump win and Trump has said that
[02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.060]  How do you feel now
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:59.060]  Is there any way if info wars had
[02:16:59.060 --> 02:17:01.060]  7 billion viewers a day
[02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:03.060]  Would it be important
[02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:05.060]  Or is it just what you decide is important
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:07.060]  And I found this these people are delusional
[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.060]  I wouldn't say we were
[02:17:09.060 --> 02:17:11.060]  Basically number one if we weren't
[02:17:11.060 --> 02:17:13.060]  But the thing is
[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:15.060]  It's the people that aren't number one
[02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:17.060]  That think they're number one because
[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:19.060]  They're associated with something they say is number one
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:21.060]  It's like Hillary supporters
[02:17:21.060 --> 02:17:23.060]  It's like make believe it's like little girls
[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:25.060]  Dressing up and pretending they're princesses or something
[02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:27.060]  And now the reality hit them
[02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:29.060]  That all their delusion
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:31.060]  Wasn't right that they were on the wrong side of history
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:31.060]  Darren?
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.060]  Look I've said from the very beginning
[02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:35.060]  That this entire election
[02:17:35.060 --> 02:17:37.060]  Has been Hillary Clinton and the mainstream
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:39.060]  Establishment media
[02:17:39.060 --> 02:17:41.060]  Versus Donald Trump and social media
[02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:43.060]  And Donald Trump and independent media
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:45.060]  And now we've won
[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:47.060]  So I think my brothers and I love my brothers
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:49.060]  They're great Christian guys
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.060]  They're great families
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:53.060]  They're Air Force veterans
[02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:55.060]  These guys were drunk
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:57.060]  3 o'clock in the morning if your truck breaks down
[02:17:57.060 --> 02:17:59.060]  But they have this misconception
[02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:01.060]  That we are the crazy conspiracy theorist
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:03.060]  But look at us now
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:05.060]  The head of Breitbart
[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:07.060]  Is now going to be the chief White House strategist
[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:09.060]  So the tide is turning my friends
[02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:11.060]  And we are the mainstream now
[02:18:11.060 --> 02:18:13.060]  And independent media is truly
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:15.060]  Taking over and it's about time
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:17.060]  And I'm very excited to see it happen
[02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:19.060]  Asking your brothers
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:21.060]  It's just that there's this arrogance
[02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:23.060]  There are other folks in the office that don't want to talk
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:25.060]  Who've had families say hey don't come here if you're going to do this
[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:27.060]  And it's just like rejecting your family
[02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:29.060]  Like Hillary's my god
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:31.060]  Don't come here
[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:33.060]  If you're not going to submit and let us lecture you
[02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:35.060]  That's right
[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:37.060]  And I also want to point out
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:39.060]  That meanwhile I have
[02:18:39.060 --> 02:18:41.060]  Lots of other family members
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:43.060]  Who think what we're doing is fantastic
[02:18:43.060 --> 02:18:45.060]  But these guys
[02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:47.060]  It's the closest family members doesn't it
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:49.060]  And these guys just
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:51.060]  They won't watch anything I do
[02:18:51.060 --> 02:18:53.060]  I never hear it'd be nice to talk to them
[02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:55.060]  And say hey you know that video you did
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:18:57.060]  It doesn't matter what topic
[02:18:57.060 --> 02:18:59.060]  That good job we might not agree with you
[02:18:59.060 --> 02:19:01.060]  But good job these guys just pretend like
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:03.060]  My dad's a smart guy
[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:05.060]  I learned all the stuff about the New World Order from him
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:07.060]  He had bookshelves full
[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:09.060]  Of Carol Quigley's books and presents
[02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:11.060]  His books when I was a little kid
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:13.060]  So I read those and I was like 10, 11, 12, 13 years old
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:15.060]  And dad he had on his bookshelf and I was into reading
[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:17.060]  But still it was still about a year
[02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:19.060]  And a half ago my dad he knows
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:21.060]  I'm telling the truth about this but sometimes he thinks I go too far
[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:23.060]  He went because he knows a lot of folks
[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:25.060]  To like this dinner
[02:19:25.060 --> 02:19:27.060]  A private dinner at a house big mansion
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:29.060]  And there were current and former generals there
[02:19:29.060 --> 02:19:31.060]  And he'd been invited
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:33.060]  By one of his friends to it
[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:35.060]  It was a big defense contractor
[02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:37.060]  And my dad goes well these were top generals
[02:19:37.060 --> 02:19:39.060]  They were saying you're dead on and you're the leader
[02:19:39.060 --> 02:19:41.060]  And you're the best and your son is the one
[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:43.060]  Who stands the whole paradigm
[02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:45.060]  Your son's the spirit driving the resistance
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:47.060]  And my dad was like no I guess I'll listen to you
[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:49.060]  And it was weird to have my dad
[02:19:49.060 --> 02:19:51.060]  Looking up to me for the first time
[02:19:51.060 --> 02:19:53.060]  I didn't like it so I think it's your big brothers
[02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:55.060]  It's kind of like this thing they can't respect you
[02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:57.060]  Because you're the little brother
[02:19:57.060 --> 02:19:59.060]  But try having your dad go from yeah yeah
[02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:01.060]  You're right about a lot of this
[02:20:01.060 --> 02:20:03.060]  I taught you a lot of this to like whoa
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:05.060]  Like looking at you in awe it's really weird
[02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:07.060]  It's quite frankly not pleasing
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:09.060]  I can imagine
[02:20:09.060 --> 02:20:11.060]  It's like top generals
[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:13.060]  Like then my dad was like ooh
[02:20:13.060 --> 02:20:15.060]  Anyways
[02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:17.060]  But for the rest of the public you would think
[02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:19.060]  That they would see that your reports and the thing you've been saying
[02:20:19.060 --> 02:20:21.060]  Continue to come true
[02:20:21.060 --> 02:20:23.060]  You know it's just time and time again
[02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:25.060]  I just don't know why it's generals and military people
[02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:27.060]  That click with me
[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:29.060]  Because I'm not being the military they just click though
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:31.060]  That's weird I mean I think it's because
[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:33.060]  They see it from within Alex
[02:20:33.060 --> 02:20:35.060]  They actually see what you're talking about from within the government
[02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:37.060]  And just like most of the people that listen to you
[02:20:37.060 --> 02:20:39.060]  And the things you say resonate with them
[02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:41.060]  Is because they've been thinking this thing
[02:20:41.060 --> 02:20:43.060]  In their mind or they've been feeling this way
[02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:45.060]  In their soul but they've never had
[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:47.060]  And then I just say what they already did
[02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:49.060]  You just say it you just put it out there
[02:20:49.060 --> 02:20:51.060]  You connect the dots and then it just clicks
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:53.060]  In people's heads
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:55.060]  So you're like this
[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:57.060]  I don't even know it's like you're some sort of
[02:20:57.060 --> 02:20:59.060]  A magical mystery being
[02:20:59.060 --> 02:21:01.060]  That takes what everybody's been thinking
[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:03.060]  And saying for so long and then you actually present it
[02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:05.060]  To people and then they scratch their heads
[02:21:05.060 --> 02:21:07.060]  And say that's exactly what I've been thinking
[02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:09.060]  I can see that
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:11.060]  There's a large portion of the American public
[02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:13.060]  That they get their news from
[02:21:13.060 --> 02:21:15.060]  The view
[02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:17.060]  Can you imagine?
[02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:19.060]  Or they get from John Stuart
[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:21.060]  Or late night television
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:23.060]  And I've always said there's a lot of people
[02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:25.060]  That they form a strong political opinion
[02:21:25.060 --> 02:21:27.060]  Without even watching the news
[02:21:27.060 --> 02:21:29.060]  Or reading newspapers
[02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:31.060]  I don't go to stuff that reaffirms my view
[02:21:31.060 --> 02:21:33.060]  I'm really trying
[02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:35.060]  I don't go sideways I'm going to talk about it
[02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:37.060]  My integrity is all I've got but he's not going sideways
[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:39.060]  So far and which even freaks me out more
[02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:41.060]  It's like my god he's starting to deliver
[02:21:41.060 --> 02:21:43.060]  What the hell we're so used to losing
[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:45.060]  Are we ready to win?
[02:21:45.060 --> 02:21:47.060]  Well I was talking with Darren McBreen
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:49.060]  Earlier today and Darren was actually
[02:21:49.060 --> 02:21:51.060]  He was piping hot
[02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:53.060]  Walking around the office back there he had the story
[02:21:53.060 --> 02:21:55.060]  He's like Trump's not going to prosecute Hillary
[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:57.060]  What the hell's going on?
[02:21:57.060 --> 02:21:59.060]  He said he'd lock it up
[02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:01.060]  So was Margaret
[02:22:01.060 --> 02:22:03.060]  I was talking and I said well I agree
[02:22:03.060 --> 02:22:05.060]  I even shot a report this morning I said the same thing
[02:22:05.060 --> 02:22:07.060]  I shot a report saying I wish Trump wouldn't have settled
[02:22:07.060 --> 02:22:09.060]  But you know maybe hey
[02:22:09.060 --> 02:22:11.060]  Maybe this is a good, it's a chess move from Trump
[02:22:11.060 --> 02:22:13.060]  I hate to be shark like but he cannot be connected
[02:22:13.060 --> 02:22:15.060]  To it when they go after
[02:22:15.060 --> 02:22:17.060]  That'll derail it
[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:19.060]  So that's what I'm saying
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:21.060]  We're not Machiavelli but Trump
[02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:23.060]  When he needs to be is just pull it
[02:22:23.060 --> 02:22:25.060]  Look Jeff Sessions is all you need to know
[02:22:25.060 --> 02:22:27.060]  Yeah I agree I'm very confident that
[02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:29.060]  Sessions will at least go after it
[02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:31.060]  He's going to lie to hand by Trump
[02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:33.060]  To act like he's easy enough
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:35.060]  That way
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:37.060]  Maybe Obama will say
[02:22:37.060 --> 02:22:39.060]  No need to pardon Hillary
[02:22:39.060 --> 02:22:41.060]  Because it looks like Trump's not going to prosecute her
[02:22:41.060 --> 02:22:43.060]  And it would be so perfect
[02:22:43.060 --> 02:22:45.060]  Because Obama knows what's going on
[02:22:45.060 --> 02:22:47.060]  He's in this as well
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:49.060]  Imagine this
[02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:51.060]  Imagine Barack Obama punishes Hillary Clinton
[02:22:51.060 --> 02:22:53.060]  Without actually an indictment
[02:22:53.060 --> 02:22:55.060]  Without an investigation
[02:22:55.060 --> 02:22:57.060]  Just pardons her without anything looming
[02:22:57.060 --> 02:22:59.060]  Because he knows he's a criminal
[02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:01.060]  Hard to be one
[02:23:01.060 --> 02:23:03.060]  I think Trump should press and then have them pardon
[02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:05.060]  Because there will still be crimes they can go after
[02:23:05.060 --> 02:23:07.060]  But I think you've taken the right course
[02:23:07.060 --> 02:23:09.060]  I wonder if the Democrats are dumb enough
[02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:11.060]  They are pretty delusional
[02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:13.060]  They might actually buy the fact that he's easing off
[02:23:13.060 --> 02:23:15.060]  So that he can get into office
[02:23:15.060 --> 02:23:17.060]  I know they're all watching right now but they're so
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:19.060]  I don't think they get it
[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:21.060]  Doesn't it tell you media
[02:23:21.060 --> 02:23:23.060]  He called you in and said you're his enemy and he hates you
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:25.060]  So that ought to tell you something
[02:23:25.060 --> 02:23:27.060]  I'm bringing great points
[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:29.060]  Anything else?
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:31.060]  Well, I just look forward to the day
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:33.060]  And I could see this in the near future
[02:23:33.060 --> 02:23:35.060]  This is a very good possibility
[02:23:35.060 --> 02:23:37.060]  When
[02:23:37.060 --> 02:23:39.060]  Leanne McAdoo steps up to a White House press conference
[02:23:39.060 --> 02:23:41.060]  And says President Trump
[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:43.060]  I have a question
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:45.060]  She could say info wars, Leanne McAdoo
[02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:47.060]  And I have a question
[02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:49.060]  So I think that's where we're heading
[02:23:49.060 --> 02:23:51.060]  Like we said, the head of Breitbart
[02:23:51.060 --> 02:23:53.060]  Is now the chief White House strategist
[02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:55.060]  And I agree with you
[02:23:55.060 --> 02:23:57.060]  Trump's gonna go the route of doing big press conferences sometimes
[02:23:57.060 --> 02:23:59.060]  When he wants to
[02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.060]  But he's gonna do daily videos
[02:24:01.060 --> 02:24:03.060]  Where he talks directly to the people
[02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:05.060]  He's bypassing the mainstream media
[02:24:05.060 --> 02:24:07.060]  So that whole model of the press briefing itself won't be there
[02:24:07.060 --> 02:24:09.060]  But when he does do press conferences
[02:24:09.060 --> 02:24:11.060]  If we have reporters on hand
[02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:13.060]  They bring us in front and center
[02:24:13.060 --> 02:24:15.060]  To those press conferences
[02:24:15.060 --> 02:24:17.060]  And the difference is, oh, there's 500 press
[02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:19.060]  Bring them in randomly to the microphone
[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:21.060]  That's what Trump's gonna do
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:23.060]  Trump protests surrounded by
[02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:25.060]  500 Trump protesters and commies
[02:24:25.060 --> 02:24:27.060]  Threatening to beat me up
[02:24:27.060 --> 02:24:29.060]  And Secret Service would come up behind me
[02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:31.060]  And say, hey, we got your back
[02:24:31.060 --> 02:24:33.060]  Hey, you're all right, we got your back
[02:24:33.060 --> 02:24:35.060]  We love what you're doing
[02:24:35.060 --> 02:24:37.060]  So, that's what's up, folks
[02:24:37.060 --> 02:24:39.060]  Yeah, and people say, let's just have a war with the government
[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:41.060]  They're evil, the average person in the government is just like us
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:43.060]  They're not evil, it's the globalist people
[02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:45.060]  They want us to have some damn civil war
[02:24:45.060 --> 02:24:47.060]  Like, here, Jones is a traitor
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:49.060]  He doesn't want a war with the government
[02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:51.060]  We're taking it back over
[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:53.060]  Peacefully, politically
[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:55.060]  With Donald Trump, that's what we hope
[02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:57.060]  That's what we believe, this is our peaceful revolution
[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:59.060]  We don't need sticks and stones in the streets
[02:24:59.060 --> 02:25:01.060]  We don't need to burn things down
[02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:03.060]  And we're promoting free market
[02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:05.060]  What makes wealth and prosperity
[02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:07.060]  The problem is, we can't give our kids everything
[02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:09.060]  Because they're gonna spoil brats
[02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:11.060]  The only byproduct problem is the decadence
[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:13.060]  The problem is, it works too well
[02:25:13.060 --> 02:25:15.060]  And that's what you're seeing with these protesters
[02:25:15.060 --> 02:25:17.060]  Most of them are probably spoiled brats
[02:25:17.060 --> 02:25:19.060]  And they have to get babysit
[02:25:19.060 --> 02:25:21.060]  By the police officers
[02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:23.060]  That are riding around on their bikes
[02:25:23.060 --> 02:25:25.060]  As they're protesting the cities
[02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:27.060]  And then they say, oh, but these are peaceful protests
[02:25:27.060 --> 02:25:29.060]  Well, we've seen what happens, that's why police officers
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:31.060]  Are surrounding these protesters
[02:25:31.060 --> 02:25:33.060]  So, I don't know, but this is what happens
[02:25:33.060 --> 02:25:35.060]  When you get the liberalization of college
[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:37.060]  Oh, I love these grips for screaming kill cops
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:39.060]  And throwing bottles at them and the media's like
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:41.060]  Look at the cops being mean to the little pro-
[02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:43.060]  Oh, yeah, and they wouldn't even show what they're doing
[02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:45.060]  I'm all for protesting, we've been in these rallies
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:47.060]  These little bastards punch us
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:49.060]  And throw stuff at us
[02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:51.060]  They've been arrested, they're finally getting arrested now
[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:53.060]  This should have been going on a long time ago
[02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:55.060]  Oh, and then I had a story I saw
[02:25:55.060 --> 02:25:57.060]  Either today or last night
[02:25:57.060 --> 02:25:59.060]  They're saying that
[02:25:59.060 --> 02:26:01.060]  You're committing a hate crime
[02:26:01.060 --> 02:26:03.060]  If you're bullying a Trump protestor
[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:05.060]  It's what they're saying now
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:07.060]  It's a hate crime to bully a Trump protestor
[02:26:07.060 --> 02:26:09.060]  Meanwhile, there's actual hate crimes going down
[02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:11.060]  Against Trump supporters
[02:26:11.060 --> 02:26:13.060]  So it's another Alinsky technique
[02:26:13.060 --> 02:26:15.060]  Take the reality, invert it
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:17.060]  And get out ahead of your enemy
[02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:19.060]  And claim that they are the ones guilty of your actions
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:21.060]  It's really not
[02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:23.060]  I gotta say this though, I've seen the videos
[02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:25.060]  Millie Weaver's shot as they threatened to beat her up last weekend
[02:26:25.060 --> 02:26:27.060]  And I don't care if they were black, white, or Hispanic
[02:26:27.060 --> 02:26:29.060]  But the white people's pictures look like goblins
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:31.060]  They look like little weird demon ghouls
[02:26:31.060 --> 02:26:33.060]  And would threaten to attack her
[02:26:33.060 --> 02:26:35.060]  And I was like wanting to attack them
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:37.060]  That's why I realized I can't go out and public with these people anymore
[02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:39.060]  I mean, what are you doing with these snarling commies
[02:26:39.060 --> 02:26:41.060]  I'm gonna kill you, you filthy bitch
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:43.060]  And they're like, threatening to attack a woman
[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:45.060]  Does that make you feel angry?
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:47.060]  I try to just take a deep breath
[02:26:47.060 --> 02:26:49.060]  And just try to calm myself
[02:26:49.060 --> 02:26:51.060]  Take the blood pressure down
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:53.060]  But here's the thing, it's like, I've met Millie Weaver
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:55.060]  She's a really nice girl
[02:26:55.060 --> 02:26:57.060]  Sweet girl!
[02:26:57.060 --> 02:26:59.060]  Why would you hate her? I mean, okay, you don't agree with whatever her politics are
[02:26:59.060 --> 02:27:01.060]  Or you don't like the things she's reporting on
[02:27:01.060 --> 02:27:03.060]  But again, why do you get so mad?
[02:27:03.060 --> 02:27:05.060]  It's Alex, I think
[02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:07.060]  She's like politely, what are your views?
[02:27:07.060 --> 02:27:09.060]  Shut up, info wars, bitch
[02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:11.060]  We're gonna beat your ass
[02:27:11.060 --> 02:27:13.060]  Two guys bowing up on a woman
[02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:15.060]  Donald Trump hates women, I'm gonna beat you
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:17.060]  It's like, you know, just
[02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:19.060]  And then they want a fight
[02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:21.060]  They're the ones that want the fight, Alex
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:23.060]  They will get crushed in a fight
[02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:25.060]  That woman calling for violence
[02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:27.060]  Do you realize if there was actually a civil war?
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:29.060]  That woman looked like a...
[02:27:29.060 --> 02:27:31.060]  It's always like some, I'm sorry, some 300-pound wimp
[02:27:31.060 --> 02:27:33.060]  Have you ever been in a fight, once the fighters?
[02:27:33.060 --> 02:27:35.060]  I don't want to start a civil war with these people
[02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:37.060]  I don't want to start a civil war with these people
[02:27:37.060 --> 02:27:39.060]  But if they want to start a civil war with us
[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:41.060]  Okay, you're gone, bye
[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:43.060]  That's the end of you, history, your history
[02:27:43.060 --> 02:27:45.060]  See ya
[02:27:45.060 --> 02:27:47.060]  But we would roll over these people
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:49.060]  Like, hot knife or butter
[02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:51.060]  It would actually be very sad
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:53.060]  But we would rather empower them
[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:55.060]  But the problem is they don't want to be empowered
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:27:57.060]  They want to wear black outfits
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:59.060]  To have Satan tattoos
[02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:01.060]  Because you know what their empowerment is, Alex?
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:03.060]  You're a racist
[02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:05.060]  That's their empowerment, is calling you a racist
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:07.060]  They're better than you
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:09.060]  So I called you a racist, I'm better than you
[02:28:09.060 --> 02:28:11.060]  That's right, let's go to a call here
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:13.060]  Steven Ohio, I'm sorry that you hold so long
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:15.060]  You're only here, Steve, welcome
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:17.060]  How are you doing?
[02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:19.060]  I'm actually from Peebley, Missouri
[02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:21.060]  But I'm in a truck sitting out here in Ohio
[02:28:21.060 --> 02:28:23.060]  Waiting to get loaded
[02:28:23.060 --> 02:28:25.060]  But as far as the stuff with these
[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:27.060]  Crazy people out here that
[02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:29.060]  Are lost
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:31.060]  They're ignorant
[02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:33.060]  They just don't know what's going on
[02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:35.060]  What happens when you get screwed over
[02:28:35.060 --> 02:28:37.060]  And you find out that you've been screwed over
[02:28:37.060 --> 02:28:39.060]  You know, you get mad
[02:28:39.060 --> 02:28:41.060]  These people out here that are
[02:28:41.060 --> 02:28:43.060]  You know, protesting for Hillary
[02:28:43.060 --> 02:28:45.060]  And this, that and the other
[02:28:45.060 --> 02:28:47.060]  They're ignorant
[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:49.060]  They don't know what they're doing
[02:28:49.060 --> 02:28:51.060]  Now these ones that are being bussed in
[02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:53.060]  That's a totally different story
[02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:55.060]  They need to be locked up
[02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:57.060]  As far as Hillary goes
[02:28:57.060 --> 02:28:59.060]  A serious message needs to be sent
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:01.060]  On him, but on her
[02:29:01.060 --> 02:29:03.060]  Not just her
[02:29:03.060 --> 02:29:05.060]  Her handlers needs to go down
[02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:07.060]  And her handlers, handlers
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:09.060]  Need to go down
[02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:11.060]  They're the real terrorist
[02:29:11.060 --> 02:29:13.060]  Yeah, Trump can't leave that
[02:29:13.060 --> 02:29:15.060]  This terrorist network in place
[02:29:15.060 --> 02:29:17.060]  He's got to get the ball rolling
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:19.060]  So for you as a litmus test
[02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:21.060]  Tax cuts, controlling the border
[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:23.060]  Or prosecuting Hillary
[02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:25.060]  Well, all of it
[02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:27.060]  I mean, we've got to get our nation back
[02:29:27.060 --> 02:29:29.060]  Excuse me, I'm a veteran
[02:29:29.060 --> 02:29:31.060]  In my day
[02:29:31.060 --> 02:29:33.060]  I mean, when Nixon started
[02:29:33.060 --> 02:29:35.060]  Stay there, you're a powerful college
[02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:37.060]  Stay there, I'm going to come right back to you
[02:29:37.060 --> 02:29:39.060]  Three minutes when you're getting your load
[02:29:39.060 --> 02:29:41.060]  Right back to you, I promise
[02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:43.060]  Bangs through Jesse, Diane, Eddie and Donna
[02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:45.060]  And then we've got other guests coming in
[02:29:45.060 --> 02:29:47.060]  Owen Schroeder, Bill and the Mountain News
[02:29:47.060 --> 02:29:49.060]  7 o'clock Central, thank you
[02:29:49.060 --> 02:29:59.060]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:29.060]  What I find odd in Hollywood is that they didn't like Trump because he was a bully
[02:30:29.060 --> 02:30:33.060]  But if you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump, you got bullied for doing that
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:37.060]  Alan also questioned how left-wing comedians can make jokes based on Trump's
[02:30:37.060 --> 02:30:39.060]  Supposed dislike of homosexuals
[02:30:39.060 --> 02:30:42.060]  When there was little to no evidence that he was against gay people
[02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:45.060]  Then he waved the LGBT flag at the convention
[02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:48.060]  The actor said that Hollywood was playing a version of Chinese whispers
[02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:51.060]  Then Trump said, ends up being completely misconstrued
[02:30:51.060 --> 02:30:54.060]  As we previously discussed, Hollywood is a place where diversity is celebrated
[02:30:54.060 --> 02:30:57.060]  Apart from diversity of opinion
[02:30:57.060 --> 02:31:21.060]  Joe Biggs with Infowars.com

[02:32:01.060 --> 02:32:02.060]  It took you over a year to do it
[02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:03.060]  Why is this so good?
[02:32:03.060 --> 02:32:09.060]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[02:32:09.060 --> 02:32:14.060]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[02:32:14.060 --> 02:32:18.060]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites
[02:32:18.060 --> 02:32:22.060]  Which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism
[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:26.060]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around
[02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:28.060]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere
[02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:30.060]  These are all parasites
[02:32:30.060 --> 02:32:32.060]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said that there's so many things that are in it
[02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:37.060]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood
[02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:40.060]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year
[02:32:40.060 --> 02:32:43.060]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today
[02:32:43.060 --> 02:32:46.060]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, InfowarsLife.com
[02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:49.060]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period
[02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:53.060]  And you can support the broadcast, InfowarsLife.com
[02:32:53.060 --> 02:32:55.060]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center
[02:32:55.060 --> 02:33:20.060]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[02:33:25.060 --> 02:33:33.060]  Careful what you wish, you might just get it
[02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:38.060]  America has providence, America is magic
[02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:40.060]  You have to take it in your hands
[02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:45.060]  The destiny, all these fools that thought they would dominate the spirit of this republic
[02:33:45.060 --> 02:33:47.060]  Are now entering the vortex
[02:33:47.060 --> 02:33:50.060]  But now, we have to deliver
[02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:53.060]  We have to stand up and be strong, we have to be good
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:56.060]  We have to work with everybody, we have to be inclusive
[02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:59.060]  We have to prove we're not what these enemies have said we are
[02:33:59.060 --> 02:34:03.060]  The great dividers, they're the dividers, we have to come together
[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:05.060]  And Trump is delivering on many fronts
[02:34:05.060 --> 02:34:09.060]  The economy's already back, he's already killing TPP, he's already announcing the end of carbon taxes
[02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:12.060]  The media says, well that's a dictator, how did he do that?
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:14.060]  Obama did it outside of law
[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:18.060]  So, now the president can kill it because it was done by the president
[02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:22.060]  As Ron Paul always said, if he was president he couldn't just take over and fix everything, he's not a dictator
[02:34:22.060 --> 02:34:25.060]  But so much that's been done dictatorially
[02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:27.060]  That you can turn it off, all it takes is the bully pulpit
[02:34:27.060 --> 02:34:31.060]  Now I want to go to Steve and others that are holding that, both the reporters pop in, you guys jump in
[02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:35.060]  Margaret Howell and of course, we've got Joe Bigster with us anytime they want to pop in
[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:37.060]  They've got a bunch of news to cover
[02:34:37.060 --> 02:34:39.060]  I'll host a little bit into the next hour
[02:34:39.060 --> 02:34:42.060]  With these guys today, but not that I'm going to punch you out here
[02:34:42.060 --> 02:34:46.060]  We've already covered a ton of the news, but it's a very exciting time to be alive
[02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:53.060]  Democratic party going extinct admit Democrats top rep, 96% in national polls
[02:34:53.060 --> 02:34:57.060]  Hopeful, showed tremendous confidence in President Trump because the world didn't end when he got in
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:35:00.060]  Day one, presidency would draw from the TPP
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:04.060]  Day one, the presidency would draw from the carbon taxes that have roughly doubled our power price
[02:35:04.060 --> 02:35:06.060]  In some areas tripled like California
[02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:13.060]  This is a big deal, this is, hey China, you've got 20-something apple plants, can we have one?
[02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:18.060]  And so they're just desperate to not let, the new thing is, Ford was saying they were going to move to Mexico
[02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:20.060]  They'd already made the announcement
[02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:23.060]  Trump made threats, said I'm going to put a tariff on you, that's not fair
[02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:27.060]  The head of Ford, Mr. Ford said, we're going to stay then
[02:35:27.060 --> 02:35:33.060]  That was the media spun it then, three days after and said, they weren't 100% going there
[02:35:33.060 --> 02:35:38.060]  The point is, is we're putting the announcement out, stay here, we'll have incentives
[02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:44.060]  So just watching the media, always cheering against America, always bad-mouthing, bitter clingers
[02:35:44.060 --> 02:35:48.060]  Always out to get us, I want to go back to Steve, what he wants to see in others
[02:35:48.060 --> 02:35:52.060]  But just briefly, both of you, why do you think the MSM hates America so bad?
[02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:55.060]  I mean I'm not putting words in your mouth, I think that's clear, disagree if you do
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:36:00.060]  And what do you make of them only intensifying their lying and their race-baiting
[02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:03.060]  When that's what got them to this point
[02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:09.060]  I think they hate us, I don't know if it's just stupidity or if they believe this elitist garbage
[02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:15.060]  That they're basically a talking points memo for a liberal defunct government
[02:36:15.060 --> 02:36:18.060]  So it's coming out of George Soros, he hates us, that's why the media hates
[02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:22.060]  They're not aware that they hate us, I don't think they are
[02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:24.060]  They're just delusional elitists
[02:36:24.060 --> 02:36:28.060]  I just know what they're creating out there, I'm telling you this weekend I went out with a whole bunch of my buddies
[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:32.060]  Who were one guy from California, one of the other buddies of mine from Florida
[02:36:32.060 --> 02:36:34.060]  I had a guy pull a gun on me
[02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:38.060]  I went out wearing a t-shirt that says Trump build the wall, looks like the Vans logo
[02:36:38.060 --> 02:36:44.060]  And I had a guy look at me, deadlock, big old dude, looks at me, rips his shirt off and is like
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:46.060]  I'm gonna beat your effin butt
[02:36:46.060 --> 02:36:50.060]  And I'm sitting there like, okay, over a t-shirt, you're this frustrated
[02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:53.060]  Dude, I'm not mad at you because I didn't catch it on tape
[02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:55.060]  But you're so shock when it happens, I get why you don't
[02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:58.060]  When you go in these places, have it rolling, it's gold dude
[02:36:58.060 --> 02:37:03.060]  I had this guy come out, show me the gun, and I'm in my car and I'm just like
[02:37:03.060 --> 02:37:07.060]  And he walks around the corner with his wife, it's like, another guy comes up and goes, F you
[02:37:07.060 --> 02:37:09.060]  At the same restaurant, F you Alex Jones
[02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:14.060]  I'm on Rainey Street, and this guy is so bad that it takes four of his little girlfriends
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:16.060]  To come pull him away and like, don't do it, don't do it
[02:37:16.060 --> 02:37:18.060]  So he was just acting tough for them?
[02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:22.060]  Well, I've got a buddy that I call Big John for a reason, he's about six foot eight
[02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:24.060]  And he's about 350 pounds
[02:37:24.060 --> 02:37:25.060]  Oh, you're combat buddies
[02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:30.060]  You're a big, giant guy, what are the Citadel? And then I had my buddy Jordan and a couple other guys
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:31.060]  So what have gone well?
[02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:32.060]  It would have gone well for him
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:35.060]  But the funny thing is though, he was so just mad
[02:37:35.060 --> 02:37:40.060]  I said, dude, it's okay, we can go to Home Depot, let's go make some mortals, let's start building the wall, man
[02:37:40.060 --> 02:37:42.060]  Let's make our border stronger
[02:37:42.060 --> 02:37:45.060]  You're a racist, I'm gonna kill you
[02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:46.060]  Was he a white guy?
[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:47.060]  No
[02:37:47.060 --> 02:37:49.060]  He said, manly white people that come out first
[02:37:49.060 --> 02:37:54.060]  So he gets pulled away by four white girls, and as this happens, all the security guys are making phone calls
[02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:55.060]  And I'm like, what are they doing?
[02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:57.060]  Well, I know you're not calling the cops on me
[02:37:57.060 --> 02:37:59.060]  So we leave this bar and start walking down the road
[02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:01.060]  And everyone's like, nope, you're not allowed to come in
[02:38:01.060 --> 02:38:02.060]  You're not allowed to come in
[02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:03.060]  You're not allowed to come in
[02:38:03.060 --> 02:38:04.060]  And I go, why?
[02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:06.060]  That's it, I'm putting Trump shirt on, I'm going down there
[02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:08.060]  You got to, rainy street is gold
[02:38:08.060 --> 02:38:11.060]  Well then what the hell, get with the camera right now
[02:38:11.060 --> 02:38:13.060]  Right now there's no one there
[02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:16.060]  I meant one that's going on at night, I'll pay for the drinks
[02:38:16.060 --> 02:38:17.060]  Okay
[02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:18.060]  You gotta get down there
[02:38:18.060 --> 02:38:19.060]  Okay, I just need some security
[02:38:19.060 --> 02:38:22.060]  No, no, this happened to me, dude, so how bad is it?
[02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:25.060]  No, look, so there's a bar called Bungalow
[02:38:25.060 --> 02:38:27.060]  I go every weekend and just wear a shirt and go out there and see what happens
[02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:29.060]  I've gone by myself and I've gone with other people
[02:38:29.060 --> 02:38:31.060]  There's a bar called Bungalow, and I feel
[02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:33.060]  Yeah, it's too bad, it's a nice area
[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:34.060]  I just have a girlfriend live over there, really
[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:35.060]  I feel in this situation when I'm sitting there
[02:38:35.060 --> 02:38:37.060]  I have a girlfriend in one of those houses, it's a bar now
[02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:38.060]  Yeah
[02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:39.060]  So you go in the bar where you should be a bedroom
[02:38:39.060 --> 02:38:42.060]  Like, well I should be a bedroom in here and the bar, it's a bar now
[02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:43.060]  It's like they turn the houses into bars
[02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:45.060]  No, so I'm sitting here at this place called Bungalow
[02:38:45.060 --> 02:38:48.060]  And one of the guys that's there that I just ran into as a fan
[02:38:48.060 --> 02:38:50.060]  He's wearing that red shirt, Trump is my president
[02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:52.060]  And he's like, do you mind if I hang out with you?
[02:38:52.060 --> 02:38:53.060]  I was like, I don't care
[02:38:53.060 --> 02:38:55.060]  So we go in a bar called Bungalow and I'm like, can I get a drink
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:38:57.060]  And the guy who's the manager, he looks at the bartender
[02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:58.060]  And he starts whispering
[02:38:58.060 --> 02:39:00.060]  And I go, is there a problem?
[02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:02.060]  Is there a reason that I can't get service?
[02:39:02.060 --> 02:39:05.060]  Well, I'm not really comfortable with your friend here
[02:39:05.060 --> 02:39:07.060]  Wearing that t-shirt in our establishment
[02:39:07.060 --> 02:39:09.060]  I was like, you're literally, you're denying me service
[02:39:09.060 --> 02:39:12.060]  Because he's wearing a t-shirt that says Trump is my president
[02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:14.060]  So then I start rolling
[02:39:14.060 --> 02:39:16.060]  And I film this guy and they come over and their security
[02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:18.060]  Oh good, can we put this up yet?
[02:39:18.060 --> 02:39:20.060]  I just put it up on the thing
[02:39:20.060 --> 02:39:22.060]  I didn't know if I could put that up with the drinking and people screaming
[02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:24.060]  I don't care, put it up immediately
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:26.060]  So we've got this and the guy kicks us out
[02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:28.060]  So I put up a video immediately after
[02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:30.060]  I think I kicked out in DC and they
[02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:32.060]  Yes, in that place, the guy got fired and all that
[02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:34.060]  So I put up a response afterwards
[02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:36.060]  I was like, look, Bungalow, they will kick you out
[02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:38.060]  If you're a Trump supporter, do not go here
[02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:40.060]  So then they started getting flooded with calls
[02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:43.060]  And when I went back there this weekend to go look at Bungalow
[02:39:43.060 --> 02:39:45.060]  It's Saturday night, jam-packed time
[02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:47.060]  It was the only bar that was dead
[02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:49.060]  It went from a five-star review down to a two
[02:39:49.060 --> 02:39:51.060]  And nobody would even go
[02:39:51.060 --> 02:39:53.060]  It was just security sitting outside
[02:39:53.060 --> 02:39:55.060]  In the cold, freezing their butt off
[02:39:55.060 --> 02:39:57.060]  And I walked by going
[02:39:57.060 --> 02:39:59.060]  No, I agree, that's it
[02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:01.060]  I'm putting on Trump's my president
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:03.060]  I'm going down there, the shirt, by the way, is about to sell out
[02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:05.060]  It's a limited edition in FullWarStore.com
[02:40:05.060 --> 02:40:07.060]  We need your support, but it's at $9.95
[02:40:07.060 --> 02:40:09.060]  That shipping included, that is at cost
[02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:11.060]  We went to Hotel Van Zant
[02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:13.060]  And my buddy was wearing that shirt
[02:40:13.060 --> 02:40:15.060]  And the lady was so like, we gave her $100
[02:40:15.060 --> 02:40:17.060]  She wasn't wearing a Trump shirt
[02:40:17.060 --> 02:40:19.060]  And this guy literally jumps out of a chair
[02:40:19.060 --> 02:40:21.060]  But he goes, watch out, mad dog
[02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:23.060]  The guy runs up to my vehicle
[02:40:23.060 --> 02:40:25.060]  And starts showing me his gun
[02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:27.060]  He didn't know we had guys right next to his other car
[02:40:27.060 --> 02:40:29.060]  That were already getting ready
[02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:31.060]  So the lady at Hotel Van Zant
[02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:33.060]  We give her $100 to pay for our drinks
[02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:35.060]  She's so triggered by this T-shirt
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:37.060]  That she runs off with our $100 bill
[02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:39.060]  And does not come back
[02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:41.060]  She goes on break and leaves
[02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:43.060]  We have to ask management, another bartender
[02:40:43.060 --> 02:40:45.060]  Liberals are having to not go to work now
[02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:47.060]  They're just sleeping for weeks
[02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:49.060]  We pushed you a case of a 69-year-old guy
[02:40:49.060 --> 02:40:51.060]  Who literally lit himself on fire in a coffee shop
[02:40:51.060 --> 02:40:53.060]  Oh yeah, that happened just a few days ago
[02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:55.060]  Seriously
[02:40:55.060 --> 02:40:57.060]  This whole place
[02:40:57.060 --> 02:40:59.060]  The thing is people say, where's the footage of the guy with the gun?
[02:40:59.060 --> 02:41:01.060]  You're in your car, you've just eaten
[02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:03.060]  A guy runs up and pulls a gun out
[02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:05.060]  I mean, you're just like, ugh
[02:41:05.060 --> 02:41:07.060]  So I'm not bitching you to get it on tape
[02:41:07.060 --> 02:41:09.060]  We have to go document it now
[02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:11.060]  The lady runs off with our change
[02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:13.060]  Lady runs off with our $100 bill
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:15.060]  Doesn't come back for like 45 minutes to an hour
[02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:17.060]  After we complain and bitch and go
[02:41:17.060 --> 02:41:19.060]  Hey man, we need our change
[02:41:19.060 --> 02:41:21.060]  This is ridiculous
[02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:23.060]  So she comes back and throws the thing on the table
[02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:25.060]  And the money just kind of falls out or whatever
[02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:27.060]  And then she walks off again
[02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:29.060]  Then everyone in the bar is like
[02:41:29.060 --> 02:41:31.060]  Ugh, I just don't know if I can be here right now
[02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:33.060]  And they all leave
[02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:35.060]  It's just me and three other guys wearing Trump shirts
[02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:37.060]  Was John there?
[02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:39.060]  Yeah, big John
[02:41:39.060 --> 02:41:41.060]  Getting here and everyone leaves
[02:41:41.060 --> 02:41:43.060]  The whole thing clears
[02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:45.060]  And this guy comes up to me, he's like
[02:41:45.060 --> 02:41:47.060]  I just saw you post something on Twitter saying you were here
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:49.060]  I figured there was some triggering going on
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:51.060]  He's like, where's everybody at? This place is usually pretty busy
[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:53.060]  I was like, well, apparently a Trump t-shirt
[02:41:53.060 --> 02:41:55.060]  Has offended them so bad that everyone
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:41:57.060]  Well, here's the deal, it's like open carry
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:41:59.060]  You have to do it to prove the Second Amendment's not outlawed
[02:41:59.060 --> 02:42:01.060]  Now, I wore hats and stuff out and got a few things
[02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:03.060]  And I'd go out to restaurants and even put like stuff in a koozie
[02:42:03.060 --> 02:42:05.060]  Said Trump's my president
[02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:07.060]  I've got to do it now
[02:42:07.060 --> 02:42:09.060]  I've got to go out because we've got to like show them
[02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:11.060]  It's okay that we want to cut your taxes
[02:42:11.060 --> 02:42:13.060]  It's okay we're not out to destroy America
[02:42:13.060 --> 02:42:15.060]  I love doing it
[02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:17.060]  Please do, you like it, that makes me so nervous
[02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:19.060]  I can't say, I'm not going to
[02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:21.060]  I'll be honest, man, I'm a little concerned
[02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:23.060]  It's literally like going into a war zone for no reason
[02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:25.060]  Alright, I got to go call Steve's been holding
[02:42:25.060 --> 02:42:27.060]  Again, we've got Margaret Howell
[02:42:27.060 --> 02:42:29.060]  And of course we've got Joe Biggs or other folks
[02:42:29.060 --> 02:42:31.060]  I'm not exaggerating, these people are
[02:42:31.060 --> 02:42:33.060]  Crazy and they're disinviting their families
[02:42:33.060 --> 02:42:35.060]  That is so crazy
[02:42:35.060 --> 02:42:37.060]  That is so crazy
[02:42:37.060 --> 02:42:39.060]  You had two family members call him and go
[02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:41.060]  Now watch your mouth, if you don't want to be too much on there
[02:42:41.060 --> 02:42:43.060]  I get it, like watch your mouth boy
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:45.060]  You come here
[02:42:45.060 --> 02:42:47.060]  My family's all from like Clemson, South Carolina
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:49.060]  Greenville, South Carolina, Charlotte
[02:42:49.060 --> 02:42:51.060]  So they're good old boys
[02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:53.060]  They're like, yeah, Trump man, that's my president right there
[02:42:53.060 --> 02:42:55.060]  Hell yeah, they're always calling me
[02:42:55.060 --> 02:42:57.060]  Like man, I saw you on Info Wars, yeah, Trump
[02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:59.060]  Yeah, but here's the thing
[02:42:59.060 --> 02:43:01.060]  If you were for Hillary, they wouldn't say don't come around
[02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:03.060]  They probably would
[02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:05.060]  Be like man, this guy fell far from the tree
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:07.060]  He is not part of this group
[02:43:07.060 --> 02:43:09.060]  In my experience
[02:43:09.060 --> 02:43:11.060]  I've never seen conservatives act like this
[02:43:11.060 --> 02:43:13.060]  I mean, I'm
[02:43:13.060 --> 02:43:15.060]  Closer than the liberals
[02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:17.060]  If I owned a bar
[02:43:17.060 --> 02:43:19.060]  If someone came in
[02:43:19.060 --> 02:43:21.060]  With a I'm with her t-shirt on
[02:43:21.060 --> 02:43:23.060]  I might just sit here and kind of laugh
[02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:25.060]  Inside my head and go, oh, that's kind of interesting
[02:43:25.060 --> 02:43:27.060]  So you know, why do you like her
[02:43:27.060 --> 02:43:29.060]  And I would engage in a conversation
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:31.060]  And I would ask him, would you like a diaper
[02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:33.060]  No, I'd say what kind of beer do you want
[02:43:33.060 --> 02:43:35.060]  Because you know what, regardless of red or blue
[02:43:35.060 --> 02:43:37.060]  Guess what I'm looking for, money
[02:43:37.060 --> 02:43:39.060]  Because I'm a business owner
[02:43:39.060 --> 02:43:41.060]  And the fact that you would deny money
[02:43:41.060 --> 02:43:43.060]  I even looked at the guys like, dude, I would have given you a $100 tip
[02:43:43.060 --> 02:43:45.060]  If you would have been cool
[02:43:45.060 --> 02:43:47.060]  And he's just like
[02:43:47.060 --> 02:43:49.060]  Dude, all I know is this guy bowed up
[02:43:49.060 --> 02:43:51.060]  Chased me out and then showed me his gun
[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:53.060]  And I'm just like, is this really happening?
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:55.060]  Well, I thought this guy was going to have a heart attack
[02:43:55.060 --> 02:43:57.060]  From his over usage of steroids
[02:43:57.060 --> 02:43:59.060]  And he was just like
[02:43:59.060 --> 02:44:01.060]  I took four of his little girls to come pull them off
[02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:03.060]  He was just acting tough for the women
[02:44:03.060 --> 02:44:05.060]  And John's just like, oh, you know if you come over here
[02:44:05.060 --> 02:44:07.060]  I'm just going to grab you by your skull
[02:44:07.060 --> 02:44:09.060]  And throw you down the walkway
[02:44:09.060 --> 02:44:11.060]  And he's just like
[02:44:11.060 --> 02:44:13.060]  You're racist
[02:44:13.060 --> 02:44:15.060]  For a t-shirt, dude, red cloth
[02:44:15.060 --> 02:44:17.060]  And some white right here, like that's enough
[02:44:17.060 --> 02:44:19.060]  To get you thrown in jail
[02:44:19.060 --> 02:44:21.060]  These people are crazy, man, these people are nuts
[02:44:21.060 --> 02:44:23.060]  I just don't get it
[02:44:23.060 --> 02:44:25.060]  The one guy goes by and goes, hey, a few Alex Jones
[02:44:25.060 --> 02:44:27.060]  And the next guy runs up with a gun
[02:44:27.060 --> 02:44:29.060]  And I drive up and down the road
[02:44:29.060 --> 02:44:31.060]  Just playing like Trump songs and stuff
[02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:33.060]  That I've found that people have made
[02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:35.060]  And I'll sit through with my make
[02:44:35.060 --> 02:44:37.060]  Great again hat on
[02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:39.060]  Yeah, I'm pushing buttons, but who cares
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:41.060]  That's the whole point though
[02:44:41.060 --> 02:44:43.060]  I should be able to walk around and not feel scared
[02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:45.060]  For my life because I
[02:44:45.060 --> 02:44:47.060]  No, I agree, instead of getting intimidated
[02:44:47.060 --> 02:44:49.060]  We've got to really double down
[02:44:49.060 --> 02:44:51.060]  Oh, of course
[02:44:51.060 --> 02:44:53.060]  But be careful, folks, these people are crazy
[02:44:53.060 --> 02:44:55.060]  And they're entitled
[02:44:55.060 --> 02:44:57.060]  I want to see these taxes cut
[02:44:57.060 --> 02:44:59.060]  Straight up and down, I mean, my God
[02:44:59.060 --> 02:45:01.060]  I'm paying $2,100 a year for just tax
[02:45:01.060 --> 02:45:03.060]  For a struct
[02:45:03.060 --> 02:45:05.060]  My taxes is almost
[02:45:05.060 --> 02:45:07.060]  As much as sometimes more
[02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:09.060]  Than what I actually make
[02:45:09.060 --> 02:45:11.060]  I know, I was talking to my town
[02:45:11.060 --> 02:45:13.060]  About taxes
[02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:15.060]  It's crazy
[02:45:15.060 --> 02:45:17.060]  But I mean, what are these
[02:45:17.060 --> 02:45:19.060]  Go back to what you guys were just talking about
[02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:21.060]  Joe, I love you, man
[02:45:21.060 --> 02:45:23.060]  Thank you, sir
[02:45:23.060 --> 02:45:25.060]  But be careful out there, man
[02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:27.060]  Because this country is a tender box
[02:45:29.060 --> 02:45:31.060]  Out there just ready to implode
[02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:33.060]  And this is exactly where
[02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:35.060]  The handlers of the handlers want us
[02:45:35.060 --> 02:45:37.060]  So
[02:45:37.060 --> 02:45:39.060]  What are these people going to do, though
[02:45:39.060 --> 02:45:41.060]  When the NWO trials start
[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:43.060]  We had Nuremberg for World War II
[02:45:45.060 --> 02:45:47.060]  I know, it's not about vindictiveness
[02:45:47.060 --> 02:45:49.060]  We've got to cut the cancer out
[02:45:49.060 --> 02:45:51.060]  They've got to be prosecuted
[02:45:51.060 --> 02:45:53.060]  We shouldn't stir stuff up
[02:45:53.060 --> 02:45:55.060]  But if we don't exercise our free speech
[02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:57.060]  They win
[02:45:57.060 --> 02:45:59.060]  That's why I'm going to start every week
[02:45:59.060 --> 02:46:01.060]  Going around with the Trump circle
[02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:03.060]  It's just like a muscle
[02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:05.060]  If you don't use it, you get muscle atrophy
[02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:07.060]  I like how you take it
[02:46:07.060 --> 02:46:09.060]  Instead of making it a bummer, make it a big joke
[02:46:09.060 --> 02:46:11.060]  Oh, it's funny, though
[02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:13.060]  The guy was so mad and I was laughing
[02:46:13.060 --> 02:46:15.060]  I was even trying to tell the girls around him
[02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:17.060]  I was like, do you understand how ridiculous this is
[02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:19.060]  This guy, in the middle of everybody
[02:46:19.060 --> 02:46:21.060]  In the middle of the freezing night
[02:46:21.060 --> 02:46:23.060]  Like, no one wants to see that
[02:46:23.060 --> 02:46:25.060]  And second of all, it took four of your little girls
[02:46:25.060 --> 02:46:27.060]  To calm you down and pull you away
[02:46:27.060 --> 02:46:29.060]  Because you were so triggered by a t-shirt
[02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:31.060]  When people get out of here
[02:46:31.060 --> 02:46:33.060]  When they're not choosing between groceries and healthcare anymore
[02:46:33.060 --> 02:46:35.060]  When they're making money, when they see opportunity
[02:46:35.060 --> 02:46:37.060]  This is going to change, it's going to take some time
[02:46:37.060 --> 02:46:39.060]  You know how many people that are going to come apologize
[02:46:39.060 --> 02:46:41.060]  When their paycheck gets $500 bigger a week
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:43.060]  They'll just pinch
[02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:45.060]  Oh, they're going to all be apologized
[02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:47.060]  Screw you, Trump, for cutting my taxes
[02:46:47.060 --> 02:46:49.060]  Duh, piece of filth
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:51.060]  Oh, there's going to be
[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:53.060]  There's going to be like a long list of people
[02:46:53.060 --> 02:46:55.060]  I've already got names of people like, oh, you didn't let me
[02:46:55.060 --> 02:46:57.060]  Because of this, this and that, and then I'm going to wait in a couple years
[02:46:57.060 --> 02:46:59.060]  And I'm like, oh my god, he actually came around
[02:46:59.060 --> 02:47:01.060]  He's pretty cool, man, I'm like, do you think so?
[02:47:01.060 --> 02:47:03.060]  Alright, great point, Steve, thank you
[02:47:03.060 --> 02:47:05.060]  Let's go ahead and take another call here, it's been all along
[02:47:05.060 --> 02:47:07.060]  It's Jesse, Jesse in Texas
[02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:09.060]  You're on the air worldwide
[02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:11.060]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:47:11.060 --> 02:47:13.060]  Yeah, I was calling to say that I think that
[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:15.060]  That Trump, yeah, he is doing the smart move
[02:47:15.060 --> 02:47:17.060]  Kind of distance himself from Hillary
[02:47:17.060 --> 02:47:19.060]  I think that they are going to actually
[02:47:19.060 --> 02:47:21.060]  Eventually go after, I think it's just
[02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:23.060]  To kind of get people to cool down on that
[02:47:23.060 --> 02:47:25.060]  Yeah, I think so with sessions, yeah
[02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:27.060]  It's a chess move
[02:47:27.060 --> 02:47:29.060]  We'll see, we'll see what happens
[02:47:29.060 --> 02:47:31.060]  It better be a chess move, but go ahead, go ahead, Jesse
[02:47:31.060 --> 02:47:33.060]  And then I was like, that bad ally you are
[02:47:33.060 --> 02:47:35.060]  Talking about the families, yeah, and my wife and I
[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:37.060]  Her side of the family
[02:47:37.060 --> 02:47:39.060]  We're all Trump supporters
[02:47:39.060 --> 02:47:41.060]  And then my side of the family
[02:47:41.060 --> 02:47:43.060]  I'm about to Trump
[02:47:43.060 --> 02:47:45.060]  I'm not an idiot
[02:47:45.060 --> 02:47:47.060]  But my mom, my brother and sister
[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:49.060]  They're all pretty much brainwashed
[02:47:49.060 --> 02:47:51.060]  And I mean, my mom
[02:47:51.060 --> 02:47:53.060]  My mom's coming to Thanksgiving
[02:47:53.060 --> 02:47:55.060]  My brother said he had to work, but he does live in L.A.
[02:47:55.060 --> 02:47:57.060]  But he did block my wife on Facebook
[02:47:57.060 --> 02:47:59.060]  After she started, I mean
[02:47:59.060 --> 02:48:01.060]  Because we're not afraid to try and wake people up
[02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:03.060]  And I mean, we've been
[02:48:03.060 --> 02:48:05.060]  Very active on social media
[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:07.060]  Well, that's what Jesse, you won
[02:48:07.060 --> 02:48:09.060]  And the censors failed, didn't they?
[02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:11.060]  Your face, when they
[02:48:11.060 --> 02:48:13.060]  When they put stuff on Facebook disagreeing with me
[02:48:13.060 --> 02:48:15.060]  I'd let them be there
[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:17.060]  We don't block people, we want them on our side
[02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:19.060]  They're just all into how they're in control
[02:48:19.060 --> 02:48:21.060]  Sorry, Jesse, go ahead
[02:48:21.060 --> 02:48:23.060]  Yeah, but it's just the entire election
[02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:25.060]  It's like, go in and see them posting stuff
[02:48:25.060 --> 02:48:27.060]  And then go into the main comment boards
[02:48:27.060 --> 02:48:29.060]  Where there's hundreds, thousands of comments
[02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:31.060]  And all these people arguing
[02:48:31.060 --> 02:48:33.060]  And every time I go in and see
[02:48:33.060 --> 02:48:35.060]  These people, they seem like
[02:48:35.060 --> 02:48:37.060]  They're trolls or something, I just shut them down with facts
[02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:39.060]  And it's so easy to shut people down
[02:48:39.060 --> 02:48:41.060]  When you have the facts behind you
[02:48:41.060 --> 02:48:43.060]  And it's just amazing
[02:48:43.060 --> 02:48:45.060]  How many people still, when you present them
[02:48:45.060 --> 02:48:47.060]  With solid facts, they
[02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:49.060]  They just
[02:48:49.060 --> 02:48:51.060]  Still don't believe it, they well
[02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:53.060]  Well, they may change the subject
[02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:55.060]  It's cognitive dissonance, they're delusional
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:57.060]  They're, here's the good news
[02:48:57.060 --> 02:48:59.060]  Human intelligence, human action
[02:48:59.060 --> 02:49:01.060]  Beat AI, beat Zuckerberg
[02:49:01.060 --> 02:49:03.060]  And beat the Soros trolls
[02:49:03.060 --> 02:49:05.060]  They spent 50 million, they admit
[02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:07.060]  Just the Democrats' Soros
[02:49:07.060 --> 02:49:09.060]  On bots and fake trolls
[02:49:09.060 --> 02:49:11.060]  And we kicked their butt
[02:49:11.060 --> 02:49:13.060]  Blue, so the good news is
[02:49:13.060 --> 02:49:15.060]  HUMAT
[02:49:15.060 --> 02:49:17.060]  HUMAT
[02:49:17.060 --> 02:49:19.060]  Good point, bloody
[02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:21.060]  HUMAT defeated AI
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:23.060]  In the first robot war
[02:49:23.060 --> 02:49:25.060]  We win!
[02:49:25.060 --> 02:49:27.060]  Sorry, go ahead
[02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:29.060]  Yeah, it's just
[02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:31.060]  It's just amazing, but yeah
[02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:33.060]  My sister, yeah, she didn't call it all about it
[02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:35.060]  I'm gonna thank human, I don't think she's coming
[02:49:35.060 --> 02:49:37.060]  But I mean, my mom's sister
[02:49:37.060 --> 02:49:39.060]  Both live in Austin, that's where I'm from
[02:49:39.060 --> 02:49:41.060]  I live in Fredericksburg, just when I came back
[02:49:41.060 --> 02:49:43.060]  From school, I just couldn't, the city
[02:49:43.060 --> 02:49:45.060]  Had changed so much, and it was just
[02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:47.060]  I hear you, Austin is a great place, but man
[02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:49.060]  The damn commies are so hard to deal with
[02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:51.060]  Thank you for the call, great point
[02:49:51.060 --> 02:49:53.060]  The only city surrounded by Texas
[02:49:53.060 --> 02:49:55.060]  Well, I mean, here's the thing
[02:49:55.060 --> 02:49:57.060]  It's like Portland in the middle of Texas
[02:49:57.060 --> 02:49:59.060]  Well, the thing is, they're so intolerant
[02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:01.060]  And they're so weird
[02:50:01.060 --> 02:50:03.060]  And then they want our guns, but why'd you
[02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:05.060]  Come here then?
[02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:07.060]  It's funny that you bring that up, so if you
[02:50:07.060 --> 02:50:09.060]  Pull up Facebook and you look on the right
[02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:11.060]  The trending thing, one of the top things
[02:50:11.060 --> 02:50:13.060]  It's trending says Hillary Clinton, and it goes
[02:50:13.060 --> 02:50:15.060]  Oh my god, Hillary Clinton is now retaking
[02:50:15.060 --> 02:50:17.060]  The popular vote, and is this enough
[02:50:17.060 --> 02:50:19.060]  To spark a revolution?
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:21.060]  And it's like all these little articles I just saw
[02:50:21.060 --> 02:50:23.060]  Like when I was sitting back there were like
[02:50:23.060 --> 02:50:25.060]  Should we start a revolution over this?
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:27.060]  How are you gonna start a revolution?
[02:50:27.060 --> 02:50:29.060]  Well, they're trying to, December 19th, there's a vote
[02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:31.060]  Before the electorate, the 4.5 million
[02:50:31.060 --> 02:50:33.060]  Decision, they're trying to
[02:50:33.060 --> 02:50:35.060]  Oh, they're going after the electors
[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:37.060]  They're going after what's happening
[02:50:37.060 --> 02:50:39.060]  With states, they're trying
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:41.060]  For the constitutional convention
[02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:43.060]  That the electors are getting threats
[02:50:43.060 --> 02:50:45.060]  The thing is, she stole 5 states
[02:50:45.060 --> 02:50:47.060]  She had 3 million dead people and others vote
[02:50:47.060 --> 02:50:49.060]  Trump won, we've got to get stories out
[02:50:49.060 --> 02:50:51.060]  Like I've been doing, exposing the fact that
[02:50:51.060 --> 02:50:53.060]  Trump really won the popular vote
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:55.060]  This is a fraud
[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:57.060]  I'm telling you, get your Trump as my president shirt

[02:51:21.060 --> 02:51:23.060]  Of Heart and Body Extract

[02:52:31.060 --> 02:52:33.060]  It makes sense to have a sustainable backup method
[02:52:33.060 --> 02:52:35.060]  To cook food and boil water
[02:52:35.060 --> 02:52:37.060]  If your current plan includes using a fuel burning stove
[02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:39.060]  Or cooking over an open fire
[02:52:39.060 --> 02:52:41.060]  Then there's a much better way

[02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:05.060]  I have a confession to make
[02:53:05.060 --> 02:53:07.060]  I spent years unable to think clearly
[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:09.060]  Like I was in a fog
[02:53:09.060 --> 02:53:11.060]  I was going through the motions
[02:53:11.060 --> 02:53:13.060]  Running my companies
[02:53:13.060 --> 02:53:15.060]  And I hated feeling mentally sluggish
[02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:17.060]  I couldn't get ahead like this
[02:53:17.060 --> 02:53:19.060]  It's no secret
[02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:21.060]  My brain is under siege
[02:53:21.060 --> 02:53:23.060]  And we are experiencing lower IQs
[02:53:23.060 --> 02:53:25.060]  But now there is a weapon
[02:53:25.060 --> 02:53:27.060]  To fight back and win

[02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:43.060]  It feels great to get things done again

[02:53:59.060 --> 02:54:01.060]  An empowerment of the American
[02:54:01.060 --> 02:54:03.060]  Liberty movement
[02:54:03.060 --> 02:54:05.060]  To give more freedoms to every American
[02:54:05.060 --> 02:54:07.060]  With that big news breaking
[02:54:07.060 --> 02:54:09.060]  From the army times

[02:54:11.060 --> 02:54:13.060]  But what's really unfolding here
[02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:15.060]  Is the total discrediting
[02:54:15.060 --> 02:54:17.060]  Of the con artists running globalism
[02:54:17.060 --> 02:54:19.060]  Their big stuff suit con game
[02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:21.060]  Is coming to an end

[02:54:55.060 --> 02:54:57.060]  Up to 50% off on things like
[02:54:57.060 --> 02:54:59.060]  Cloyville Silver
[02:54:59.060 --> 02:55:01.060]  And your purchase of the products
[02:55:01.060 --> 02:55:03.060]  Makes it all possible
[02:55:03.060 --> 02:55:05.060]  So I salute you all and thank you
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:07.060]  Repeatedly
[02:55:07.060 --> 02:55:09.060]  Alright, so military times
[02:55:09.060 --> 02:55:11.060]  Just came out with an article
[02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:13.060]  That says
[02:55:13.060 --> 02:55:15.060]  Recruiters can carry concealed guns
[02:55:15.060 --> 02:55:17.060]  U.S. military personnel can now request
[02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:19.060]  To carry concealed hang guns
[02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:21.060]  For protection at government facilities
[02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:23.060]  According to new defense department
[02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:25.060]  Directive issued last week
[02:55:25.060 --> 02:55:27.060]  In response to a series of deadly shootings
[02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:29.060]  Over the last seven years
[02:55:29.060 --> 02:55:31.060]  So is Obama blocking that the whole time?
[02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:33.060]  More than likely. I was admitted
[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:35.060]  And now what do you make of him ordering the drones
[02:55:35.060 --> 02:55:37.060]  To stand down on the southern border?
[02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:39.060]  I mean that's a really helpful tool
[02:55:39.060 --> 02:55:41.060]  And I had a chance to go out and stay
[02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:43.060]  For the week in Arizona
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:45.060]  With a guy named Glenn Spencer
[02:55:45.060 --> 02:55:47.060]  He has his own private drones
[02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:49.060]  He's got these drones that shoot up out of the ground
[02:55:49.060 --> 02:55:51.060]  That go off these seismic readers
[02:55:51.060 --> 02:55:53.060]  That can tell your foot traffic
[02:55:53.060 --> 02:55:55.060]  And they go up and then they send live feedback
[02:55:55.060 --> 02:55:57.060]  To him and then he can call the board patrol
[02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:59.060]  And hey you got five, six guys here
[02:55:59.060 --> 02:56:01.060]  That are walking up their arm, they're not armed
[02:56:01.060 --> 02:56:03.060]  They're carrying drugs, they're smuggling human beings
[02:56:03.060 --> 02:56:05.060]  Whatever it may be and it's a really effective way
[02:56:05.060 --> 02:56:07.060]  I mean I think it's a great idea to have
[02:56:07.060 --> 02:56:09.060]  On October 1st, no border patrol agents
[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:11.060]  On this one route
[02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:13.060]  That is known for smuggling
[02:56:13.060 --> 02:56:15.060]  That makes no, okay really
[02:56:15.060 --> 02:56:17.060]  And then we brought you an article Alex
[02:56:17.060 --> 02:56:19.060]  About how the president
[02:56:19.060 --> 02:56:21.060]  Is most likely going to free these
[02:56:21.060 --> 02:56:23.060]  Asylum seekers that are being held in
[02:56:23.060 --> 02:56:25.060]  Facilities before he leaves office
[02:56:25.060 --> 02:56:27.060]  Because you know he's got a lot
[02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:29.060]  Going on with that
[02:56:29.060 --> 02:56:31.060]  He's got to make sure that at least he can put
[02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:33.060]  One dent in Trump's immigration policy
[02:56:33.060 --> 02:56:35.060]  I agree, isn't the best part of all this
[02:56:35.060 --> 02:56:37.060]  Having out the fake news yet on or this
[02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:39.060]  With Paul after calls and let him take over
[02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:41.060]  Isn't the best part Trump calling
[02:56:41.060 --> 02:56:43.060]  In the mainstream media and chewing him out
[02:56:43.060 --> 02:56:45.060]  And saying I hate you, you're lying
[02:56:45.060 --> 02:56:47.060]  Oh I loved it because they all thought they were being invited
[02:56:47.060 --> 02:56:49.060]  Like oh yes, Trump's going to bring me up
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:51.060]  We're the mainstream media, we're in charge
[02:56:51.060 --> 02:56:53.060]  Well Blitzer's like I'm going to bring my champagne
[02:56:53.060 --> 02:56:55.060]  Just like it was
[02:56:55.060 --> 02:56:57.060]  It's not media
[02:56:57.060 --> 02:56:59.060]  And Trump's like you're fired, you're a liar
[02:56:59.060 --> 02:57:01.060]  You're garbage and then they go oh my god
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:03.060]  It was like a firing squad
[02:57:03.060 --> 02:57:05.060]  We lied about it and told these lies and we lost
[02:57:05.060 --> 02:57:07.060]  And now he's rolling over to us
[02:57:07.060 --> 02:57:09.060]  And letting us run our lives
[02:57:09.060 --> 02:57:11.060]  He calls Alex Jones up and fakes him
[02:57:11.060 --> 02:57:13.060]  Oh my god
[02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:15.060]  Could you imagine just being that fly on the wall
[02:57:15.060 --> 02:57:17.060]  I just want to sit there
[02:57:17.060 --> 02:57:19.060]  And listen to him chew these people out
[02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:21.060]  Like you and Owen were saying earlier
[02:57:21.060 --> 02:57:23.060]  Could you imagine like that's something that all of us
[02:57:23.060 --> 02:57:25.060]  Every American who's been lied to
[02:57:25.060 --> 02:57:27.060]  Our entire lives by these
[02:57:27.060 --> 02:57:29.060]  We've all screamed at the television set
[02:57:29.060 --> 02:57:31.060]  Let's jam in one call before a break
[02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:33.060]  Eddie you're on the air, go ahead
[02:57:33.060 --> 02:57:35.060]  I'll be super quick
[02:57:35.060 --> 02:57:37.060]  I'll be very quick buddy, I got two quick points
[02:57:37.060 --> 02:57:39.060]  And I'd like to talk to all the listeners
[02:57:39.060 --> 02:57:41.060]  About supporting you at the end
[02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:43.060]  Number one
[02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:45.060]  I really want to see Millie Weaver be the DC
[02:57:45.060 --> 02:57:47.060]  Correspondent, the Info Wars flag
[02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:49.060]  Needs to be there
[02:57:49.060 --> 02:57:51.060]  You're almost ready to go 24 hours
[02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:53.060]  But I think a lot of these people you've got
[02:57:53.060 --> 02:57:55.060]  Right there now can do half hour spots
[02:57:55.060 --> 02:57:57.060]  We're ready to be the
[02:57:57.060 --> 02:57:59.060]  Never be able to be called
[02:57:59.060 --> 02:58:01.060]  Fake or anything
[02:58:01.060 --> 02:58:03.060]  They need to be there and the questions
[02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:05.060]  Need to be asked
[02:58:05.060 --> 02:58:07.060]  That we all want to answer
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:09.060]  Number two, Donald Trump
[02:58:09.060 --> 02:58:11.060]  I did it this morning too, it's really idiotic
[02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:13.060]  I agree with you guys
[02:58:13.060 --> 02:58:15.060]  It's just a head fake
[02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:17.060]  He knows there's going to be another big drop
[02:58:17.060 --> 02:58:19.060]  He's being the good guy saying I'm not going to prosecute
[02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:21.060]  But in light of all this new evidence
[02:58:21.060 --> 02:58:23.060]  From the data drop
[02:58:23.060 --> 02:58:25.060]  We have to prosecute because the pedophile rings
[02:58:25.060 --> 02:58:27.060]  All this stuff, it's good
[02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:29.060]  He's a good guy now
[02:58:29.060 --> 02:58:31.060]  He's like a head of the game
[02:58:31.060 --> 02:58:33.060]  But it's almost time for Info Wars
[02:58:33.060 --> 02:58:35.060]  Hold on, don't hang up Eddie
[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:37.060]  Stay there, we'll be right back
[02:58:37.060 --> 02:58:39.060]  Proof will be in the future, but we'll see
[02:58:39.060 --> 02:58:41.060]  Fourth hour straight ahead at infowars.com
[02:58:41.060 --> 02:58:43.060]  Fourth live show
[02:58:43.060 --> 02:58:45.060]  If your local station doesn't carry it
[02:58:45.060 --> 02:58:47.060]  Infowars.com, Fourth live show
[02:58:47.060 --> 02:58:49.060]  And spread that link
[02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:51.060]  The enemy hates it
[02:58:51.060 --> 02:58:53.060]  We're selling a product DNA Force
[02:58:53.060 --> 02:58:55.060]  That is the very best
[02:58:55.060 --> 02:58:57.060]  We produce
[02:58:57.060 --> 02:58:59.060]  You took years for you to develop DNA Force
[02:58:59.060 --> 02:59:01.060]  It's been something that I've been working on
[02:59:01.060 --> 02:59:03.060]  For a long time, Alex, because I think
[02:59:03.060 --> 02:59:05.060]  It's very, very important
[02:59:05.060 --> 02:59:07.060]  What the aging process is
[02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:09.060]  Is when the cell replicates
[02:59:09.060 --> 02:59:11.060]  We lose a little bit of our telomeres
[02:59:11.060 --> 02:59:13.060]  Telomeres are the little cups
[02:59:13.060 --> 02:59:15.060]  On the end of our chromosomes
[02:59:15.060 --> 02:59:17.060]  When it runs out, you start dying
[02:59:17.060 --> 02:59:19.060]  We chose the PQQ because it has over
[02:59:19.060 --> 02:59:21.060]  175 different clinical trials
[02:59:21.060 --> 02:59:23.060]  It's one of the most effective substances
[02:59:23.060 --> 02:59:25.060]  It works like an antioxidant
[02:59:25.060 --> 02:59:27.060]  It works to repair nerve growth
[02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:29.060]  Factor
[02:59:29.060 --> 02:59:31.060]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount
[02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:33.060]  It's in powder form
[02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:35.060]  We have so many five star reviews
[02:59:35.060 --> 02:59:37.060]  I take this, this is the product that I take
[02:59:37.060 --> 02:59:39.060]  Infowarslife.com
[02:59:39.060 --> 02:59:41.060]  We fight the global
[02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:43.060]  We fight the new world order
[02:59:43.060 --> 02:59:45.060]  Secure your DNA Force today
[02:59:45.060 --> 02:59:47.060]  At infowarslife.com
[02:59:47.060 --> 02:59:57.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:00:17.060 --> 03:00:19.060]  If you are receiving this transmission
[03:00:19.060 --> 03:00:21.060]  You are the resistance
[03:00:21.060 --> 03:00:23.060]  We now take you live
[03:00:23.060 --> 03:00:25.060]  To the Central Texas Command Center
[03:00:25.060 --> 03:00:27.060]  It's Alex Jones
[03:00:27.060 --> 03:00:29.060]  I recognized a long time ago
[03:00:29.060 --> 03:00:31.060]  This was a military
[03:00:31.060 --> 03:00:33.060]  Rainwashing attack
[03:00:33.060 --> 03:00:35.060]  They have the WikiLeaks
[03:00:35.060 --> 03:00:37.060]  We know that's a fact now
[03:00:37.060 --> 03:00:39.060]  I studied history, it was very clear
[03:00:39.060 --> 03:00:41.060]  And because we are recognizing the enemy
[03:00:41.060 --> 03:00:43.060]  For what it is, we have a good chance of winning
[03:00:43.060 --> 03:00:45.060]  Paul Watson is going to be hosting today
[03:00:45.060 --> 03:00:47.060]  Not David Knight
[03:00:47.060 --> 03:00:49.060]  And so he's coming up
[03:00:49.060 --> 03:00:51.060]  At about 10-15 after
[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:53.060]  Margaret Howe is here with us
[03:00:53.060 --> 03:00:55.060]  A lot of calls to get to
[03:00:55.060 --> 03:00:57.060]  A lot happening, a lot of history unfolding
[03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:59.060]  We didn't even get to a lot of the stories you guys have
[03:00:59.060 --> 03:01:01.060]  Like Ron Paul warning of a false flag
[03:01:01.060 --> 03:01:03.060]  We'll go to some calls in a moment
[03:01:03.060 --> 03:01:05.060]  Ron Paul warning of a false flag
[03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:07.060]  To get Trump into a war
[03:01:07.060 --> 03:01:09.060]  I think that's a really prescient warning
[03:01:09.060 --> 03:01:11.060]  Margaret
[03:01:11.060 --> 03:01:13.060]  He points out that the neocons
[03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:15.060]  The war before 9-11 happened
[03:01:15.060 --> 03:01:17.060]  Conveniently on mainstream media
[03:01:17.060 --> 03:01:19.060]  They were going on and talking about
[03:01:19.060 --> 03:01:21.060]  You know
[03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:23.060]  Things that would get us into war, frankly
[03:01:23.060 --> 03:01:25.060]  And just
[03:01:25.060 --> 03:01:27.060]  This article, we've got it up on our website
[03:01:27.060 --> 03:01:29.060]  It was written by Steve Watson
[03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:31.060]  And it highlights the fact that
[03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:33.060]  We could see another false flag
[03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:35.060]  I love Dr. Paul, I really respect him
[03:01:35.060 --> 03:01:37.060]  He put together that amazing fake news list
[03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:39.060]  He's always right on cue
[03:01:39.060 --> 03:01:41.060]  And for him to come out and say this
[03:01:41.060 --> 03:01:43.060]  But it's unbelievable
[03:01:43.060 --> 03:01:45.060]  We've got the shadow government
[03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:47.060]  That's still very much intact in Washington
[03:01:47.060 --> 03:01:49.060]  And we could see something like this happen
[03:01:49.060 --> 03:01:51.060]  What do you think?
[03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:53.060]  It's definitely a possibility
[03:01:53.060 --> 03:01:55.060]  Who was it that came out with?
[03:01:55.060 --> 03:01:57.060]  Was it one of the WikiLeaks where they talked about
[03:01:57.060 --> 03:01:59.060]  There was an actual shadow government
[03:01:59.060 --> 03:02:01.060]  That was operating on the 7th floor
[03:02:01.060 --> 03:02:03.060]  That was making all these secret deals
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:05.060]  Well, they call it 7th floor
[03:02:05.060 --> 03:02:07.060]  They go, as you know, Bill Gerberg
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:09.060]  Shadow government, you know, 7th floor
[03:02:09.060 --> 03:02:11.060]  There's something shadow, what?
[03:02:11.060 --> 03:02:13.060]  Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a possibility
[03:02:13.060 --> 03:02:15.060]  I wouldn't put it past
[03:02:15.060 --> 03:02:17.060]  I mean, they're desperate, they're trying to do whatever they can
[03:02:17.060 --> 03:02:19.060]  I agree with Paul, they're going to try something
[03:02:19.060 --> 03:02:21.060]  The next 56 days
[03:02:21.060 --> 03:02:23.060]  They're not going to just let this happen, they're arrogant
[03:02:23.060 --> 03:02:25.060]  But think about this, this is happening right when the military
[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:27.060]  Is all of a sudden saying, well, due to domestic terror threats
[03:02:27.060 --> 03:02:29.060]  By the way, Obama's ordered the drones to stand down
[03:02:29.060 --> 03:02:31.060]  By the way, folks
[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:33.060]  We just got a bat emergency message
[03:02:33.060 --> 03:02:35.060]  From Roger Stone, yes, get him on right now
[03:02:35.060 --> 03:02:37.060]  I don't want to cut into Paul's time
[03:02:37.060 --> 03:02:39.060]  And host one day, but Paul should be hosting
[03:02:39.060 --> 03:02:41.060]  Like two, three days a week, he's so damn popular
[03:02:41.060 --> 03:02:43.060]  But it is a great job, Paul's coming up
[03:02:43.060 --> 03:02:45.060]  But Roger Stone has some breaking news
[03:02:45.060 --> 03:02:47.060]  He never does this, so it must be big
[03:02:47.060 --> 03:02:49.060]  Let's get Stone on right now
[03:02:49.060 --> 03:02:51.060]  I'll go ahead and call Stone right now
[03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:53.060]  We'll take a few more calls here
[03:02:53.060 --> 03:02:55.060]  Eddie in Arizona, anything else?
[03:02:55.060 --> 03:02:57.060]  Yeah, bro, I just wanted to say
[03:02:57.060 --> 03:02:59.060]  I'm telling you
[03:02:59.060 --> 03:03:01.060]  We need a melee reader with the
[03:03:01.060 --> 03:03:03.060]  Info Wars flag there in DC
[03:03:03.060 --> 03:03:05.060]  Asking important questions, I think she could do
[03:03:05.060 --> 03:03:07.060]  Three minutes of content a day
[03:03:07.060 --> 03:03:09.060]  You got Margaret Howe, she's good for half hour content a day
[03:03:09.060 --> 03:03:11.060]  You got Joe Biggs, she's good for half hour
[03:03:11.060 --> 03:03:13.060]  I agree, all of it costs money
[03:03:13.060 --> 03:03:15.060]  Look, you buy the products
[03:03:15.060 --> 03:03:17.060]  We deliver on every front
[03:03:17.060 --> 03:03:19.060]  You buy products, you support us, you'll see more people
[03:03:19.060 --> 03:03:21.060]  More correspondence, more defeats
[03:03:21.060 --> 03:03:23.060]  Of the globalist, more victory
[03:03:23.060 --> 03:03:25.060]  Dollar signs mean victory
[03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:27.060]  I need your prayers
[03:03:27.060 --> 03:03:29.060]  I need you to spread our material
[03:03:29.060 --> 03:03:31.060]  I need you to buy our products
[03:03:31.060 --> 03:03:33.060]  That's all I'm asking for, brother
[03:03:33.060 --> 03:03:35.060]  I've done it for years, I've been a long time
[03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:37.060]  I know, and let me ask you a question
[03:03:37.060 --> 03:03:39.060]  Have you seen...
[03:03:39.060 --> 03:03:41.060]  Sir, sir, have you seen us deliver?
[03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:43.060]  Everyone needs to get off their butts
[03:03:43.060 --> 03:03:45.060]  And support it, everyone needs a shortwave
[03:03:45.060 --> 03:03:47.060]  Solar powered radio, every person in America
[03:03:47.060 --> 03:03:49.060]  Needs one, Alex sells them
[03:03:49.060 --> 03:03:51.060]  Everybody, Anthroplex, you'll be
[03:03:51.060 --> 03:03:53.060]  Pull vaulting out of bed, guys
[03:03:53.060 --> 03:03:55.060]  Everybody needs these products, you guys got to get up
[03:03:55.060 --> 03:03:57.060]  And do it, make it happen
[03:03:57.060 --> 03:03:59.060]  We're on the edge of making it happen
[03:03:59.060 --> 03:04:01.060]  That's it
[03:04:01.060 --> 03:04:03.060]  Look, I'm not bitching at folks
[03:04:03.060 --> 03:04:05.060]  If they want to support us, they can
[03:04:05.060 --> 03:04:07.060]  I'm just saying, have we not delivered?
[03:04:07.060 --> 03:04:09.060]  Have we not? I mean, have we not?
[03:04:11.060 --> 03:04:13.060]  So, when folks buy the products
[03:04:13.060 --> 03:04:15.060]  The money, like 95% of it
[03:04:15.060 --> 03:04:17.060]  Will go to the war
[03:04:17.060 --> 03:04:19.060]  I mean, I'm telling you folks, you energize us
[03:04:19.060 --> 03:04:21.060]  This is one place you know
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:23.060]  You buy something, it goes into
[03:04:23.060 --> 03:04:25.060]  Direct energy into a fight against the globalist
[03:04:25.060 --> 03:04:27.060]  I mean, I am so committed
[03:04:27.060 --> 03:04:29.060]  I'll give my blood to this fight
[03:04:29.060 --> 03:04:31.060]  Any other points?
[03:04:31.060 --> 03:04:33.060]  He hung up
[03:04:33.060 --> 03:04:35.060]  Well, you heard him, he said Anthroplex
[03:04:35.060 --> 03:04:37.060]  Pull vaulting out of bed
[03:04:37.060 --> 03:04:39.060]  What does that mean?
[03:04:41.060 --> 03:04:43.060]  Alright, stay with us, guys
[03:04:43.060 --> 03:04:45.060]  We're going to come back
[03:04:45.060 --> 03:04:47.060]  After a break, right after this quick break
[03:04:47.060 --> 03:04:49.060]  We've had a lot of crazy
[03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:51.060]  Computer stuff going on at GCN today
[03:04:51.060 --> 03:04:53.060]  GCN, I even said GCN
[03:04:53.060 --> 03:04:55.060]  Some new computers, but they seem to be
[03:04:55.060 --> 03:04:57.060]  In their own little world up there
[03:04:57.060 --> 03:04:59.060]  Not for long
[03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:29.060]  Well, guess what? We're getting that wall, baby!
[03:05:29.060 --> 03:05:56.060]  Woo!
[03:05:56.060 --> 03:05:59.060]  This has been Joe Biggs with infowars.com

[03:06:32.060 --> 03:06:34.060]  Has been revealed concerning
[03:06:34.060 --> 03:06:36.060]  The connection between iodine and the gut
[03:06:36.060 --> 03:06:38.060]  Which many experts are now saying
[03:06:38.060 --> 03:06:40.060]  Could be the biggest revelation
[03:06:40.060 --> 03:06:42.060]  Ever concerning iodine
[03:06:42.060 --> 03:06:44.060]  You can pull these studies up for yourself
[03:06:44.060 --> 03:06:46.060]  This is the real deal, folks
[03:06:46.060 --> 03:06:48.060]  And the truth is that iodine is essential
[03:06:48.060 --> 03:06:50.060]  In my view to any optimum health regimen
[03:06:50.060 --> 03:06:52.060]  Stock up on survival shield

[03:08:24.060 --> 03:08:26.060]  Ladies and gentlemen
[03:08:28.060 --> 03:08:31.060]  The globalists are now tasting Americana steel
[03:08:31.060 --> 03:08:33.060]  Paul Watson we're having Skype trouble with
[03:08:33.060 --> 03:08:35.060]  From England
[03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:37.060]  We'll be on in the next 5-10 minutes
[03:08:37.060 --> 03:08:40.060]  But it's perfect timing as Roger Stone
[03:08:40.060 --> 03:08:42.060]  Never calls in, hardly ever
[03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:44.060]  He says, oh emergency I want to come on here
[03:08:44.060 --> 03:08:46.060]  Talk about breaking news
[03:08:46.060 --> 03:08:48.060]  Let me guess, I bet it's dealing with
[03:08:48.060 --> 03:08:50.060]  Conway announcing that Trump won't go after Hillary
[03:08:50.060 --> 03:08:52.060]  Well it's not Trump's job
[03:08:52.060 --> 03:08:54.060]  To go after Hillary
[03:08:54.060 --> 03:08:56.060]  It'll be the Attorney General
[03:08:56.060 --> 03:08:58.060]  And I'll think Jeff Sessions being chosen
[03:08:58.060 --> 03:09:00.060]  For the nomination
[03:09:00.060 --> 03:09:02.060]  For confirmation in the Senate
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:04.060]  As the Attorney General
[03:09:04.060 --> 03:09:06.060]  Will be a major signal
[03:09:06.060 --> 03:09:08.060]  That justice is being done
[03:09:08.060 --> 03:09:10.060]  But we'll find out right now
[03:09:10.060 --> 03:09:12.060]  It was over a week ago I learned from sources
[03:09:12.060 --> 03:09:14.060]  I talked to Stone, he heard the same thing
[03:09:14.060 --> 03:09:16.060]  That Chelsea Clinton was contacting
[03:09:16.060 --> 03:09:18.060]  Ivanka Trump
[03:09:18.060 --> 03:09:20.060]  Trump's daughter
[03:09:20.060 --> 03:09:22.060]  And saying please don't go after my mommy
[03:09:22.060 --> 03:09:24.060]  And my daddy
[03:09:24.060 --> 03:09:26.060]  We're going to find out right now from Roger Stone
[03:09:26.060 --> 03:09:28.060]  Roger Stone, what's the breaking news?
[03:09:28.060 --> 03:09:30.060]  Well I am
[03:09:30.060 --> 03:09:32.060]  somewhat stunned
[03:09:32.060 --> 03:09:34.060]  And I am hopeful like Alex
[03:09:34.060 --> 03:09:36.060]  As so many other supporters of Donald Trump
[03:09:36.060 --> 03:09:38.060]  Are that Ms. Conway
[03:09:38.060 --> 03:09:40.060]  Is somehow incorrect
[03:09:40.060 --> 03:09:42.060]  I think you're exactly right
[03:09:42.060 --> 03:09:44.060]  That this is not a question
[03:09:44.060 --> 03:09:46.060]  Immediately for the President
[03:09:46.060 --> 03:09:48.060]  It's a question for the grand jury
[03:09:48.060 --> 03:09:50.060]  And that the
[03:09:50.060 --> 03:09:52.060]  Either we are a nation
[03:09:52.060 --> 03:09:54.060]  Of laws
[03:09:54.060 --> 03:09:56.060]  Or we are a nation of men
[03:09:56.060 --> 03:09:58.060]  Now we were told
[03:09:58.060 --> 03:10:00.060]  Over and over again
[03:10:00.060 --> 03:10:02.060]  During Watergate
[03:10:02.060 --> 03:10:04.060]  That no person
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:06.060]  Was above the law
[03:10:06.060 --> 03:10:08.060]  In all honesty
[03:10:08.060 --> 03:10:10.060]  The criminality of the Clintons
[03:10:10.060 --> 03:10:12.060]  Is such that we don't even have a full catalogue
[03:10:12.060 --> 03:10:14.060]  Of the crimes for which they
[03:10:14.060 --> 03:10:16.060]  Could be
[03:10:16.060 --> 03:10:18.060]  Correct
[03:10:18.060 --> 03:10:20.060]  The assertion by
[03:10:20.060 --> 03:10:22.060]  FBI Director Comey
[03:10:22.060 --> 03:10:24.060]  That the 650,000
[03:10:24.060 --> 03:10:26.060]  Emails
[03:10:26.060 --> 03:10:28.060]  Contains no damning evidence
[03:10:28.060 --> 03:10:30.060]  Against the Clintons is false
[03:10:30.060 --> 03:10:32.060]  NYPD was
[03:10:32.060 --> 03:10:34.060]  Pressured to go along
[03:10:34.060 --> 03:10:36.060]  With that narrative
[03:10:36.060 --> 03:10:38.060]  Less justice
[03:10:38.060 --> 03:10:40.060]  Indite a number of officers
[03:10:40.060 --> 03:10:42.060]  In the
[03:10:42.060 --> 03:10:44.060]  Garner
[03:10:44.060 --> 03:10:46.060]  Controversy
[03:10:46.060 --> 03:10:48.060]  NYPD was blackmailed through Election Day
[03:10:48.060 --> 03:10:50.060]  Because they've seen the emails
[03:10:50.060 --> 03:10:52.060]  And they know otherwise
[03:10:52.060 --> 03:10:54.060]  I think
[03:10:54.060 --> 03:10:56.060]  That a special prosecutor
[03:10:56.060 --> 03:10:58.060]  Someone of true independence
[03:10:58.060 --> 03:11:00.060]  Has to look at the Clinton Foundation
[03:11:00.060 --> 03:11:02.060]  The Clinton
[03:11:02.060 --> 03:11:04.060]  Email scandal
[03:11:04.060 --> 03:11:06.060]  So far
[03:11:06.060 --> 03:11:08.060]  The
[03:11:08.060 --> 03:11:10.060]  650,000
[03:11:10.060 --> 03:11:12.060]  Wiener
[03:11:12.060 --> 03:11:14.060]  Treasure trove
[03:11:14.060 --> 03:11:16.060]  Of emails to determine
[03:11:16.060 --> 03:11:18.060]  Whether some charges
[03:11:18.060 --> 03:11:20.060]  Should be brought against Hillary
[03:11:20.060 --> 03:11:22.060]  Or Bill
[03:11:22.060 --> 03:11:24.060]  Or Chelsea
[03:11:24.060 --> 03:11:26.060]  Or Podesta
[03:11:26.060 --> 03:11:28.060]  Or many of their co-conspirators
[03:11:30.060 --> 03:11:32.060]  I personally just think
[03:11:32.060 --> 03:11:34.060]  I am hopeful that this doesn't reflect
[03:11:34.060 --> 03:11:36.060]  The President's view
[03:11:36.060 --> 03:11:38.060]  Now I'm going to post
[03:11:38.060 --> 03:11:40.060]  A petition
[03:11:40.060 --> 03:11:42.060]  To President-elect Trump
[03:11:42.060 --> 03:11:44.060]  To Jeff Sessions
[03:11:44.060 --> 03:11:46.060]  Although I have some disagreements
[03:11:46.060 --> 03:11:48.060]  With him on
[03:11:48.060 --> 03:11:50.060]  Marijuana policy
[03:11:50.060 --> 03:11:52.060]  And drug law reform
[03:11:52.060 --> 03:11:54.060]  Nonetheless, I think is a solid
[03:11:54.060 --> 03:11:56.060]  Law and order
[03:11:58.060 --> 03:12:00.060]  Patriot and a guy who has
[03:12:00.060 --> 03:12:02.060]  Had the courage to be there
[03:12:02.060 --> 03:12:04.060]  For Donald Trump
[03:12:04.060 --> 03:12:06.060]  Unlike say, oh I don't know
[03:12:06.060 --> 03:12:08.060]  Mitt Romney
[03:12:08.060 --> 03:12:10.060]  Of almost insulting
[03:12:10.060 --> 03:12:12.060]  Boarding party
[03:12:12.060 --> 03:12:14.060]  Romney, a man who called Donald Trump
[03:12:14.060 --> 03:12:16.060]  A con man
[03:12:16.060 --> 03:12:18.060]  A fraud
[03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:20.060]  It's not just respectful disagreement
[03:12:20.060 --> 03:12:22.060]  Or
[03:12:22.060 --> 03:12:24.060]  Donald isn't really qualified
[03:12:24.060 --> 03:12:26.060]  It's not even opposition
[03:12:26.060 --> 03:12:28.060]  It was
[03:12:28.060 --> 03:12:30.060]  Needlessly personal
[03:12:30.060 --> 03:12:32.060]  And obviously turns out to be wrong
[03:12:32.060 --> 03:12:34.060]  Isn't it ironic
[03:12:34.060 --> 03:12:36.060]  Mitt struggled in Ohio
[03:12:36.060 --> 03:12:38.060]  Carried Ohio
[03:12:38.060 --> 03:12:40.060]  Easily
[03:12:46.060 --> 03:12:48.060]  I don't know if we have an audio
[03:12:48.060 --> 03:12:50.060]  Issue here
[03:12:50.060 --> 03:12:52.060]  Do you hear Joe Biggs?
[03:12:52.060 --> 03:12:54.060]  I'm sorry
[03:12:54.060 --> 03:12:56.060]  I could not
[03:12:56.060 --> 03:12:58.060]  I said to look on Mitt Romney's face
[03:12:58.060 --> 03:13:00.060]  When he came out of that meeting with Trump
[03:13:00.060 --> 03:13:02.060]  It was like a son
[03:13:02.060 --> 03:13:04.060]  Who's done something bad and his dad just spanked him
[03:13:04.060 --> 03:13:06.060]  He came out and kind of had his face down
[03:13:06.060 --> 03:13:08.060]  He had his smirk on his face and quickly went to the vehicle
[03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:10.060]  And I was like, man, I was like, what the hell just happened
[03:13:10.060 --> 03:13:12.060]  Let me erase this and then we're going to get stoned
[03:13:12.060 --> 03:13:14.060]  Back on obviously there's special reports
[03:13:14.060 --> 03:13:16.060]  Over the holiday at infowars.com
[03:13:16.060 --> 03:13:18.060]  But what do you make of him
[03:13:18.060 --> 03:13:20.060]  Reportedly bringing him the MSM and saying
[03:13:20.060 --> 03:13:22.060]  I hate you, your traders, your liars, your scum
[03:13:22.060 --> 03:13:24.060]  I think it's important to degrade them
[03:13:24.060 --> 03:13:26.060]  And let everybody know this isn't real media
[03:13:26.060 --> 03:13:28.060]  And not just acquiesce to the same old game
[03:13:28.060 --> 03:13:30.060]  Where they run the show
[03:13:30.060 --> 03:13:32.060]  I'm in total agreement
[03:13:32.060 --> 03:13:34.060]  Look, somewhere Dick Nixon is smiling
[03:13:34.060 --> 03:13:36.060]  Trump brings in
[03:13:36.060 --> 03:13:38.060]  The mainstream media
[03:13:38.060 --> 03:13:40.060]  Who maligned him
[03:13:40.060 --> 03:13:42.060]  Who lied about him
[03:13:42.060 --> 03:13:44.060]  Who battered him day in and day out
[03:13:44.060 --> 03:13:46.060]  With half truths
[03:13:46.060 --> 03:13:48.060]  With falsehoods
[03:13:48.060 --> 03:13:50.060]  The New York Times
[03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:52.060]  On the day after his election
[03:13:52.060 --> 03:13:54.060]  Said that he ran a campaign
[03:13:54.060 --> 03:13:56.060]  Where he actively disparaged
[03:13:56.060 --> 03:13:58.060]  Black people
[03:13:58.060 --> 03:14:00.060]  Gay people
[03:14:00.060 --> 03:14:02.060]  And so on
[03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:04.060]  No, he did not
[03:14:04.060 --> 03:14:06.060]  Nor did he disparage Arabs
[03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:08.060]  He did not
[03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:10.060]  Those are falsehoods
[03:14:10.060 --> 03:14:12.060]  And so he is
[03:14:12.060 --> 03:14:14.060]  Absolutely right
[03:14:14.060 --> 03:14:16.060]  CNN became a veritable arm
[03:14:16.060 --> 03:14:18.060]  Of the Clinton campaign
[03:14:18.060 --> 03:14:20.060]  The mainstream media
[03:14:20.060 --> 03:14:22.060]  Who at least in the 60s and 70s
[03:14:22.060 --> 03:14:24.060]  Pretended some
[03:14:24.060 --> 03:14:26.060]  Objectivity
[03:14:26.060 --> 03:14:28.060]  Where they were hysterical
[03:14:28.060 --> 03:14:30.060]  Of their desire to defeat Trump
[03:14:30.060 --> 03:14:32.060]  If you figure that
[03:14:32.060 --> 03:14:34.060]  Soros
[03:14:34.060 --> 03:14:36.060]  And his other left wing associates
[03:14:36.060 --> 03:14:38.060]  Spent, let's call it
[03:14:38.060 --> 03:14:40.060]  A billion and a half
[03:14:40.060 --> 03:14:42.060]  500 million to the quasi
[03:14:42.060 --> 03:14:44.060]  Criminal activities of David Brock
[03:14:44.060 --> 03:14:46.060]  500 million
[03:14:46.060 --> 03:14:48.060]  In the hands of a man
[03:14:48.060 --> 03:14:50.060]  Who admire, you know, who Joseph Goebbels
[03:14:50.060 --> 03:14:52.060]  Would be proud of
[03:14:52.060 --> 03:14:54.060]  In their effort to attack you, me
[03:14:54.060 --> 03:14:56.060]  As all proven by
[03:14:56.060 --> 03:14:58.060]  The WikiLeaks and by
[03:14:58.060 --> 03:15:00.060]  Proven by James O'Keefe
[03:15:00.060 --> 03:15:02.060]  I guess because
[03:15:02.060 --> 03:15:04.060]  We're MVPs
[03:15:04.060 --> 03:15:06.060]  So it is
[03:15:06.060 --> 03:15:08.060]  Extraordinary
[03:15:08.060 --> 03:15:10.060]  That if you add the value
[03:15:10.060 --> 03:15:12.060]  Of the CNN assault on Trump
[03:15:12.060 --> 03:15:14.060]  Let's call that two billion
[03:15:14.060 --> 03:15:16.060]  Of advertising
[03:15:16.060 --> 03:15:18.060]  And the fact that Trump and his
[03:15:18.060 --> 03:15:20.060]  Patriotic supporters
[03:15:20.060 --> 03:15:22.060]  Probably raised and spent
[03:15:22.060 --> 03:15:24.060]  270 million
[03:15:24.060 --> 03:15:26.060]  That's the first in Scoliath's story
[03:15:26.060 --> 03:15:28.060]  In history
[03:15:28.060 --> 03:15:30.060]  And you've got a lot to say
[03:15:30.060 --> 03:15:32.060]  If you want to continue taping
[03:15:32.060 --> 03:15:34.060]  I'll get Paul Watson here
[03:15:34.060 --> 03:15:36.060]  We can connect in 10 minutes
[03:15:36.060 --> 03:15:38.060]  I can interview you for the nightly news
[03:15:38.060 --> 03:15:40.060]  So much unfolding, but
[03:15:40.060 --> 03:15:42.060]  StoneColdTruth.com
[03:15:42.060 --> 03:15:44.060]  Thank you so much Roger Stone
[03:15:44.060 --> 03:15:46.060]  For joining us
[03:15:46.060 --> 03:15:48.060]  Paul Watts is taking over
[03:15:48.060 --> 03:15:50.060]  Let me talk to you during the break
[03:15:50.060 --> 03:15:52.060]  I mean, Alex, I think this is a crucial moment
[03:15:52.060 --> 03:15:54.060]  It's coming up next week
[03:15:54.060 --> 03:15:56.060]  I salute your entire staff
[03:15:56.060 --> 03:15:58.060]  Alex, you guys are doing a phenomenal job
[03:15:58.060 --> 03:16:00.060]  Let me just say Florida looks awesome
[03:16:00.060 --> 03:16:02.060]  Right now, I wish I was there
[03:16:02.060 --> 03:16:04.060]  Well, I'm in the bunker
[03:16:04.060 --> 03:16:06.060]  Preparing my book
[03:16:06.060 --> 03:16:08.060]  I will be publishing a book called
[03:16:08.060 --> 03:16:10.060]  The Making of the President 2016
[03:16:10.060 --> 03:16:12.060]  How Donald Trump
[03:16:12.060 --> 03:16:14.060]  Orchestrated a revolution
[03:16:14.060 --> 03:16:16.060]  That will be in bookstores
[03:16:16.060 --> 03:16:18.060]  On inauguration day
[03:16:18.060 --> 03:16:20.060]  It's a Herculean task
[03:16:20.060 --> 03:16:22.060]  I know, Herculean, cleaning out the stables
[03:16:22.060 --> 03:16:24.060]  I look forward, stay there
[03:16:24.060 --> 03:16:26.060]  We're about to go to break, I'm going to turn over to Watson
[03:16:26.060 --> 03:16:28.060]  Let me talk to you real quick
[03:16:28.060 --> 03:16:30.060]  Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com
[03:16:30.060 --> 03:16:32.060]  You guys are awesome, mountain news coming up
[03:16:32.060 --> 03:16:34.060]  We'll take some more stuff with all this great news
[03:16:34.060 --> 03:16:36.060]  You wanted to cover as well
[03:16:36.060 --> 03:16:38.060]  A lot of things happening
[03:16:38.060 --> 03:16:40.060]  But let's let him take over
[03:16:40.060 --> 03:16:42.060]  We'll skip this network break, so we'll get some more time
[03:16:42.060 --> 03:16:44.060]  Paul Joseph Watson from London
[03:16:44.060 --> 03:16:46.060]  We have you, please take over
[03:16:46.060 --> 03:16:48.060]  Thanks Alex
[03:16:48.060 --> 03:16:50.060]  For Trump's announcement
[03:16:50.060 --> 03:16:52.060]  Or at least Kellyanne Conway's announcement
[03:16:52.060 --> 03:16:54.060]  That there won't be a
[03:16:54.060 --> 03:16:56.060]  Special prosecution at least at this time
[03:16:56.060 --> 03:16:58.060]  Of Hillary Clinton
[03:16:58.060 --> 03:17:00.060]  It's interesting on the one hand
[03:17:00.060 --> 03:17:02.060]  Because of course you've got a lot of anger over this
[03:17:02.060 --> 03:17:04.060]  You only need to look at the comments on infowars.com
[03:17:04.060 --> 03:17:06.060]  To see that
[03:17:06.060 --> 03:17:08.060]  And so we're not downplaying that anger
[03:17:08.060 --> 03:17:10.060]  One thing I did notice before I go on to the main
[03:17:10.060 --> 03:17:12.060]  Meet of this issue
[03:17:12.060 --> 03:17:14.060]  Is that the first media outlet to criticise
[03:17:14.060 --> 03:17:16.060]  Trump over this was
[03:17:16.060 --> 03:17:18.060]  BrightBart.com
[03:17:18.060 --> 03:17:20.060]  Now you've had the leftist media for the past
[03:17:20.060 --> 03:17:22.060]  Two weeks whining and wailing
[03:17:22.060 --> 03:17:24.060]  About how now the alt-right
[03:17:24.060 --> 03:17:26.060]  Is now in control of everything
[03:17:26.060 --> 03:17:28.060]  And the...
[03:17:28.060 --> 03:17:30.060]  Yeah, they're saying it's state run media
[03:17:30.060 --> 03:17:32.060]  And the very first outlet to criticise
[03:17:32.060 --> 03:17:34.060]  Trump is BrightBart.com
[03:17:34.060 --> 03:17:36.060]  So that goes out the window
[03:17:36.060 --> 03:17:38.060]  And Bill Mitchell who's been on this show
[03:17:38.060 --> 03:17:40.060]  Obviously he was proven completely correct in saying
[03:17:40.060 --> 03:17:42.060]  The polls were rigged
[03:17:42.060 --> 03:17:44.060]  He's got a lot of the political capital after that
[03:17:44.060 --> 03:17:46.060]  He basically says that this
[03:17:46.060 --> 03:17:48.060]  Is Trump playing the long game
[03:17:48.060 --> 03:17:50.060]  That this is a pardon blocker
[03:17:50.060 --> 03:17:52.060]  So if Trump had gone after
[03:17:52.060 --> 03:17:54.060]  Hillary even before he became president
[03:17:54.060 --> 03:17:56.060]  That would give Barack Obama
[03:17:56.060 --> 03:17:58.060]  The excuse to claim that
[03:17:58.060 --> 03:18:00.060]  There was a witch hunt against Hillary
[03:18:00.060 --> 03:18:02.060]  Yeah, that's the calculus I've seen
[03:18:02.060 --> 03:18:04.060]  Yeah, and that that would
[03:18:04.060 --> 03:18:06.060]  Have given him the excuse
[03:18:06.060 --> 03:18:08.060]  The justification to pardon Hillary Clinton
[03:18:08.060 --> 03:18:10.060]  So, you know, Mitchell makes the point
[03:18:10.060 --> 03:18:12.060]  That Obama's manipulation
[03:18:12.060 --> 03:18:14.060]  Of the FBI and the Attorney General
[03:18:14.060 --> 03:18:16.060]  Was part of why people voted
[03:18:16.060 --> 03:18:18.060]  For Trump, right?
[03:18:18.060 --> 03:18:20.060]  They wanted that swamp drained
[03:18:20.060 --> 03:18:22.060]  So they don't want Trump interfering
[03:18:22.060 --> 03:18:24.060]  Politically in those areas
[03:18:24.060 --> 03:18:26.060]  So, you know, Bill Mitchell thinks
[03:18:26.060 --> 03:18:28.060]  They're playing the long game that
[03:18:28.060 --> 03:18:30.060]  The AG sessions is going to come out
[03:18:30.060 --> 03:18:32.060]  With the FBI a couple of months into
[03:18:32.060 --> 03:18:34.060]  A Trump administration. No, I agree
[03:18:34.060 --> 03:18:36.060]  If Trump goes after him now
[03:18:36.060 --> 03:18:38.060]  They'll try to block sessions even harder
[03:18:38.060 --> 03:18:40.060]  Yeah, so as we know, Alex
[03:18:40.060 --> 03:18:42.060]  Eventually has to wait until
[03:18:42.060 --> 03:18:44.060]  What is it? January 19th
[03:18:44.060 --> 03:18:46.060]  Until he can really start to get his teeth
[03:18:46.060 --> 03:18:48.060]  Sunk into these issues. I understand
[03:18:48.060 --> 03:18:50.060]  The anger, but then you look at TPP
[03:18:50.060 --> 03:18:52.060]  He's already pulling you out of that
[03:18:52.060 --> 03:18:54.060]  You look at the wall, which
[03:18:54.060 --> 03:18:56.060]  For weeks people said, for months
[03:18:56.060 --> 03:18:58.060]  People said, oh, he's never going to build
[03:18:58.060 --> 03:19:00.060]  The wall. Glenn Beck, Trump is never
[03:19:00.060 --> 03:19:02.060]  Going to build the wall. I'll apologize
[03:19:02.060 --> 03:19:04.060]  If he builds the wall. LA Times
[03:19:04.060 --> 03:19:06.060]  All the rest of them are in the article
[03:19:06.060 --> 03:19:08.060]  Now there's this screenshot
[03:19:08.060 --> 03:19:10.060]  This photograph taken of Trump
[03:19:10.060 --> 03:19:12.060]  Meeting with his Homeland Security
[03:19:12.060 --> 03:19:14.060]  Expert and what does it say?
[03:19:14.060 --> 03:19:16.060]  2000 miles build
[03:19:16.060 --> 03:19:18.060]  The wall rapidly. So he's
[03:19:18.060 --> 03:19:20.060]  Fulfilled his promise on TPP
[03:19:20.060 --> 03:19:22.060]  Looks like he's going to do it on the wall
[03:19:22.060 --> 03:19:24.060]  So just have a little patience
[03:19:24.060 --> 03:19:26.060]  I mean, I understand the anger
[03:19:26.060 --> 03:19:28.060]  But you can see what Trump's doing
[03:19:28.060 --> 03:19:30.060]  He's trying to be presidential
[03:19:30.060 --> 03:19:32.060]  He's trying to not give Obama that excuse
[03:19:32.060 --> 03:19:34.060]  To claim there's a witch hunt against Hillary
[03:19:34.060 --> 03:19:36.060]  And to give her that presidential pardon
[03:19:36.060 --> 03:19:38.060]  You know, we'll wait and see what unfolds
[03:19:38.060 --> 03:19:40.060]  After that
[03:19:40.060 --> 03:19:42.060]  So let's continue with the news
[03:19:42.060 --> 03:19:44.060]  Let's continue with the news here
[03:19:44.060 --> 03:19:46.060]  Thanks, Alex. Now
[03:19:46.060 --> 03:19:48.060]  What I wanted to talk about is Twitter
[03:19:48.060 --> 03:19:50.060]  First off, because of course we've had
[03:19:50.060 --> 03:19:52.060]  This math purge of so-called alt
[03:19:52.060 --> 03:19:54.060]  Right accounts over the past two weeks
[03:19:54.060 --> 03:19:56.060]  Of course they left it far too late
[03:19:56.060 --> 03:19:58.060]  Because it was after the election
[03:19:58.060 --> 03:20:00.060]  Now what's interesting is
[03:20:00.060 --> 03:20:02.060]  There's a convicted pedophile
[03:20:02.060 --> 03:20:04.060]  Who was convicted
[03:20:04.060 --> 03:20:06.060]  Three years ago
[03:20:06.060 --> 03:20:08.060]  In the United Kingdom called Ian Watkins
[03:20:08.060 --> 03:20:10.060]  Now this was a former
[03:20:10.060 --> 03:20:12.060]  Lead singer, I believe, the frontman of a band
[03:20:12.060 --> 03:20:14.060]  Called The Lost Prophet
[03:20:14.060 --> 03:20:16.060]  Absolutely harrowing
[03:20:16.060 --> 03:20:18.060]  Case where he raped
[03:20:18.060 --> 03:20:20.060]  A baby
[03:20:20.060 --> 03:20:22.060]  I mean, it's difficult to even read about the details
[03:20:22.060 --> 03:20:24.060]  Of this case. I'll read it from the NME article
[03:20:24.060 --> 03:20:26.060]  The Twitter account
[03:20:26.060 --> 03:20:28.060]  Of ex-Lost Prophet's frontman
[03:20:28.060 --> 03:20:30.060]  And convicted pedophile Ian Watkins
[03:20:30.060 --> 03:20:32.060]  Has recently become active again
[03:20:32.060 --> 03:20:34.060]  Despite the singer being in jail
[03:20:34.060 --> 03:20:36.060]  Singer Watkins was jailed
[03:20:36.060 --> 03:20:38.060]  In December 2013 for 29 years
[03:20:38.060 --> 03:20:40.060]  Plus six years on license
[03:20:40.060 --> 03:20:42.060]  For a serious string of child sex
[03:20:42.060 --> 03:20:44.060]  Offences including the attempted rape
[03:20:44.060 --> 03:20:46.060]  Of a baby
[03:20:46.060 --> 03:20:48.060]  So you've got a convicted pedophile
[03:20:48.060 --> 03:20:50.060]  Who attempted to rape a baby
[03:20:50.060 --> 03:20:52.060]  Whose Twitter account has not only
[03:20:52.060 --> 03:20:54.060]  Been active for the past three years
[03:20:54.060 --> 03:20:56.060]  It's been verified for the past three years
[03:20:56.060 --> 03:20:58.060]  He started tweeting
[03:20:58.060 --> 03:21:00.060]  Or somebody started tweeting from it
[03:21:00.060 --> 03:21:02.060]  Yesterday
[03:21:02.060 --> 03:21:04.060]  And this account is still active
[03:21:04.060 --> 03:21:06.060]  On Twitter
[03:21:06.060 --> 03:21:08.060]  Twitter's a private company
[03:21:08.060 --> 03:21:10.060]  It can keep who it likes
[03:21:10.060 --> 03:21:12.060]  So it's keeping a convicted pedophile
[03:21:12.060 --> 03:21:14.060]  There is a red carpet
[03:21:14.060 --> 03:21:16.060]  For jihadis and pedophiles
[03:21:16.060 --> 03:21:18.060]  While banning Milo for criticizing ghostbusters
[03:21:18.060 --> 03:21:20.060]  While banning people for having different
[03:21:20.060 --> 03:21:22.060]  Opinions
[03:21:22.060 --> 03:21:24.060]  While verifying the Muslim Brotherhood
[03:21:24.060 --> 03:21:26.060]  This is another article out of Heat Street
[03:21:26.060 --> 03:21:28.060]  Twitter verifies Muslim Brotherhood's account
[03:21:28.060 --> 03:21:30.060]  To verify pledges to curb hate speech
[03:21:30.060 --> 03:21:32.060]  This is a group that has
[03:21:32.060 --> 03:21:34.060]  Not only been linked with but outright
[03:21:34.060 --> 03:21:36.060]  Endorses violent
[03:21:36.060 --> 03:21:38.060]  Terror attacks
[03:21:38.060 --> 03:21:40.060]  So people have said all along
[03:21:40.060 --> 03:21:42.060]  Well they don't ban ISIS accounts
[03:21:42.060 --> 03:21:44.060]  Well there are too many ISIS accounts to ban them all
[03:21:44.060 --> 03:21:46.060]  It's like whack them all they keep popping up
[03:21:46.060 --> 03:21:48.060]  Okay they verified
[03:21:48.060 --> 03:21:50.060]  The Muslim Brotherhood
[03:21:50.060 --> 03:21:52.060]  Now that's an application process
[03:21:52.060 --> 03:21:54.060]  Where somebody, an individual within Twitter
[03:21:54.060 --> 03:21:56.060]  Has to make the judgment call
[03:21:56.060 --> 03:21:58.060]  On whether to verify the Muslim Brotherhood
[03:21:58.060 --> 03:22:00.060]  What's verification
[03:22:00.060 --> 03:22:02.060]  Well not only do you get a little blue tick
[03:22:02.060 --> 03:22:04.060]  Next to the account name
[03:22:04.060 --> 03:22:06.060]  But this verifies your account as an official
[03:22:06.060 --> 03:22:08.060]  Account
[03:22:08.060 --> 03:22:10.060]  It allows you access to features
[03:22:10.060 --> 03:22:12.060]  Which normal Twitter users don't have
[03:22:12.060 --> 03:22:14.060]  And it results in your content becoming
[03:22:14.060 --> 03:22:16.060]  Extremely more widespread
[03:22:16.060 --> 03:22:18.060]  So Twitter in verifying
[03:22:18.060 --> 03:22:20.060]  The Muslim Brotherhood is directly
[03:22:20.060 --> 03:22:22.060]  Contributing
[03:22:22.060 --> 03:22:24.060]  To the spread of violent
[03:22:24.060 --> 03:22:26.060]  Terrorist, Islamist
[03:22:26.060 --> 03:22:28.060]  Propaganda
[03:22:28.060 --> 03:22:30.060]  Exactly and again
[03:22:30.060 --> 03:22:32.060]  You know
[03:22:32.060 --> 03:22:34.060]  Saudi Arabia keeps buying more
[03:22:34.060 --> 03:22:36.060]  And more stock in Twitter
[03:22:36.060 --> 03:22:38.060]  They're banning Milo for criticizing ghostbusters
[03:22:38.060 --> 03:22:40.060]  They're banning alt-right people
[03:22:40.060 --> 03:22:42.060]  This pedophile convicted
[03:22:42.060 --> 03:22:44.060]  Three years ago
[03:22:44.060 --> 03:22:46.060]  Still has a Twitter account
[03:22:46.060 --> 03:22:48.060]  I mean I'm getting emails
[03:22:48.060 --> 03:22:50.060]  I'm getting messages
[03:22:50.060 --> 03:22:52.060]  You've all heard about pizza gate
[03:22:52.060 --> 03:22:54.060]  I think it's a kind of mass hysteria
[03:22:54.060 --> 03:22:56.060]  But now you're getting claims that
[03:22:56.060 --> 03:22:58.060]  Twitter is not banning people
[03:22:58.060 --> 03:23:00.060]  Who are sharing child pornography
[03:23:00.060 --> 03:23:02.060]  No I haven't looked into that
[03:23:02.060 --> 03:23:04.060]  Because when you get messages from people saying
[03:23:04.060 --> 03:23:06.060]  Hey Paul look at this child pornography scandal
[03:23:06.060 --> 03:23:08.060]  Obviously I'm not going to click on those links
[03:23:08.060 --> 03:23:10.060]  Okay the UK government
[03:23:10.060 --> 03:23:12.060]  Just passed a law
[03:23:12.060 --> 03:23:14.060]  Where internet service providers
[03:23:14.060 --> 03:23:16.060]  Keep your internet history and share it
[03:23:16.060 --> 03:23:18.060]  With the government as and when they like
[03:23:18.060 --> 03:23:20.060]  But those are the claims circulating
[03:23:20.060 --> 03:23:22.060]  Today on Twitter
[03:23:22.060 --> 03:23:24.060]  And add to that a convicted pedophile
[03:23:24.060 --> 03:23:26.060]  Now somebody is tweeting from his account
[03:23:26.060 --> 03:23:28.060]  Three years after
[03:23:28.060 --> 03:23:30.060]  He was convicted of molesting
[03:23:30.060 --> 03:23:32.060]  Children
[03:23:32.060 --> 03:23:34.060]  And that's who Twitter thinks
[03:23:34.060 --> 03:23:36.060]  Should have free speech
[03:23:36.060 --> 03:23:38.060]  Meanwhile they're banning people
[03:23:38.060 --> 03:23:40.060]  For criticizing ghostbusters
[03:23:40.060 --> 03:23:42.060]  I mean it's got to the point now where
[03:23:42.060 --> 03:23:44.060]  You disagree with someone
[03:23:44.060 --> 03:23:46.060]  You argue with someone on Twitter
[03:23:46.060 --> 03:23:48.060]  And they treat that as harassment
[03:23:48.060 --> 03:23:50.060]  And they will report you for responding
[03:23:50.060 --> 03:23:52.060]  To their tweet
[03:23:52.060 --> 03:23:54.060]  They will report you for screen-shotting
[03:23:54.060 --> 03:23:56.060]  Their tweet
[03:23:56.060 --> 03:23:58.060]  In fact let's take a look at another two examples
[03:23:58.060 --> 03:24:00.060]  That just came up within the past 20 minutes
[03:24:00.060 --> 03:24:02.060]  This is a tweet
[03:24:02.060 --> 03:24:04.060]  Morning everyone
[03:24:04.060 --> 03:24:06.060]  Except white people
[03:24:06.060 --> 03:24:08.060]  Have an awesome day
[03:24:08.060 --> 03:24:10.060]  I hope a white person dies today
[03:24:10.060 --> 03:24:12.060]  Now this is interesting because somebody
[03:24:12.060 --> 03:24:14.060]  Did a little experiment on Twitter
[03:24:14.060 --> 03:24:16.060]  Where they took tweets
[03:24:16.060 --> 03:24:18.060]  Black Lives Matter people and leftists
[03:24:18.060 --> 03:24:20.060]  Who hate white people
[03:24:20.060 --> 03:24:22.060]  Who are racist against white people
[03:24:22.060 --> 03:24:24.060]  It's not reverse racism, it's just racism
[03:24:24.060 --> 03:24:26.060]  And don't forget the mayor of New York
[03:24:26.060 --> 03:24:28.060]  Came out with a sign and said F-whiteness
[03:24:28.060 --> 03:24:30.060]  And everybody's agreeing, that's why people are bad
[03:24:30.060 --> 03:24:32.060]  Yeah
[03:24:32.060 --> 03:24:34.060]  That's racism
[03:24:34.060 --> 03:24:36.060]  That is allowed on Twitter
[03:24:36.060 --> 03:24:38.060]  Somebody took those tweets where it was
[03:24:38.060 --> 03:24:40.060]  Anti-white hatred, anti-white racism
[03:24:40.060 --> 03:24:42.060]  Replaced white for black
[03:24:42.060 --> 03:24:44.060]  They were immediately banned
[03:24:44.060 --> 03:24:46.060]  In both ways
[03:24:46.060 --> 03:24:48.060]  You can't allow flagrant racism
[03:24:48.060 --> 03:24:50.060]  Against white people
[03:24:50.060 --> 03:24:52.060]  And not the other way around
[03:24:52.060 --> 03:24:54.060]  Because again this encourages
[03:24:54.060 --> 03:24:56.060]  The real white supremacists
[03:24:56.060 --> 03:24:58.060]  The real neo-nazis
[03:24:58.060 --> 03:25:00.060]  It actively encourages them
[03:25:00.060 --> 03:25:02.060]  To harass people
[03:25:02.060 --> 03:25:04.060]  To be more racist
[03:25:04.060 --> 03:25:06.060]  So again it's a complete double standard
[03:25:06.060 --> 03:25:08.060]  They're blocking people for their opinions
[03:25:08.060 --> 03:25:10.060]  Meanwhile verifying
[03:25:10.060 --> 03:25:12.060]  The Muslim brotherhood
[03:25:12.060 --> 03:25:14.060]  That endorses violent terror attacks
[03:25:14.060 --> 03:25:16.060]  Allowing people
[03:25:16.060 --> 03:25:18.060]  To keep verified accounts
[03:25:18.060 --> 03:25:20.060]  Who have convicted pedophiles
[03:25:20.060 --> 03:25:22.060]  For three years
[03:25:22.060 --> 03:25:24.060]  I mean it's no wonder that Twitter's stock is tanking
[03:25:24.060 --> 03:25:26.060]  It's no wonder that
[03:25:26.060 --> 03:25:28.060]  That is a sinking ship
[03:25:28.060 --> 03:25:30.060]  And why many other platforms
[03:25:30.060 --> 03:25:32.060]  Many other social media platforms like Gap
[03:25:32.060 --> 03:25:34.060]  Are now coming to prominence
[03:25:34.060 --> 03:25:36.060]  Because Twitter has made its decision
[03:25:36.060 --> 03:25:38.060]  After the election
[03:25:38.060 --> 03:25:40.060]  I don't expect info wars
[03:25:40.060 --> 03:25:42.060]  Or elix or myself to be on there
[03:25:42.060 --> 03:25:44.060]  For very much longer
[03:25:44.060 --> 03:25:46.060]  The way it's going
[03:25:46.060 --> 03:25:48.060]  But you know that's just the game
[03:25:48.060 --> 03:25:50.060]  We played it for a while if they want to become a cesspit
[03:25:50.060 --> 03:25:52.060]  For pedophiles
[03:25:52.060 --> 03:25:54.060]  And violent Islamists
[03:25:54.060 --> 03:25:56.060]  And racist
[03:25:56.060 --> 03:25:58.060]  Then that's their business
[03:25:58.060 --> 03:26:00.060]  They're a private company
[03:26:00.060 --> 03:26:02.060]  Good luck to them
[03:26:02.060 --> 03:26:04.060]  Again I mentioned this earlier
[03:26:04.060 --> 03:26:06.060]  There was a long range photo
[03:26:06.060 --> 03:26:08.060]  Took of Obama
[03:26:08.060 --> 03:26:10.060]  Meeting with
[03:26:10.060 --> 03:26:12.060]  Secretary of State Chris Kobach
[03:26:12.060 --> 03:26:14.060]  Who is a border security
[03:26:14.060 --> 03:26:16.060]  And legal immigration expert
[03:26:16.060 --> 03:26:18.060]  They met on Sunday in New Jersey
[03:26:18.060 --> 03:26:20.060]  Some people are saying was this deliberate
[03:26:20.060 --> 03:26:22.060]  But they took a photograph
[03:26:22.060 --> 03:26:24.060]  Of Trump and Kobach meeting
[03:26:24.060 --> 03:26:26.060]  He was holding a file of papers
[03:26:26.060 --> 03:26:28.060]  In his arms
[03:26:28.060 --> 03:26:30.060]  One of them was visible when you zoomed in on the photograph
[03:26:30.060 --> 03:26:32.060]  This is not fake news
[03:26:32.060 --> 03:26:34.060]  People have come out and said oh that's photoshopped
[03:26:34.060 --> 03:26:36.060]  It's not photoshopped
[03:26:36.060 --> 03:26:38.060]  You can look at the original photo
[03:26:38.060 --> 03:26:40.060]  And zoom in it's very easy
[03:26:40.060 --> 03:26:42.060]  This paper is entitled
[03:26:42.060 --> 03:26:44.060]  Department of Homeland Security
[03:26:44.060 --> 03:26:46.060]  Kobach strategic plan for first 365 days
[03:26:46.060 --> 03:26:48.060]  And of course when you zoom in
[03:26:48.060 --> 03:26:50.060]  The paper reads
[03:26:50.060 --> 03:26:52.060]  In addition to 386 miles
[03:26:52.060 --> 03:26:54.060]  Of existing wall
[03:26:54.060 --> 03:26:56.060]  There is a further
[03:26:56.060 --> 03:26:58.060]  1,989 miles
[03:26:58.060 --> 03:27:00.060]  Planned for rapid build
[03:27:00.060 --> 03:27:02.060]  Okay so
[03:27:02.060 --> 03:27:04.060]  Trump's
[03:27:04.060 --> 03:27:06.060]  Without the TPP
[03:27:06.060 --> 03:27:08.060]  And it looks like according to this
[03:27:08.060 --> 03:27:10.060]  He's fulfilling his promise
[03:27:10.060 --> 03:27:12.060]  On building the wall
[03:27:12.060 --> 03:27:14.060]  Confounding left wing
[03:27:14.060 --> 03:27:16.060]  Pundits, media outlets
[03:27:16.060 --> 03:27:18.060]  Who for months have said that it's not going to happen
[03:27:18.060 --> 03:27:20.060]  That it was all hot air
[03:27:20.060 --> 03:27:22.060]  In fact I quote some of them in the article
[03:27:22.060 --> 03:27:24.060]  Crooks and liars quote
[03:27:24.060 --> 03:27:26.060]  This is from January
[03:27:26.060 --> 03:27:28.060]  Well Trump supporters hate to break it to you
[03:27:28.060 --> 03:27:30.060]  But there is not going to be a wall
[03:27:30.060 --> 03:27:32.060]  So again they claimed that
[03:27:32.060 --> 03:27:34.060]  Trump's promise to build a wall
[03:27:34.060 --> 03:27:36.060]  Was just
[03:27:36.060 --> 03:27:38.060]  Rhetoric to rally people up to get people
[03:27:38.060 --> 03:27:40.060]  Excited at his campaign speeches
[03:27:40.060 --> 03:27:42.060]  The street.com published an article
[03:27:42.060 --> 03:27:44.060]  Insitled here's why
[03:27:44.060 --> 03:27:46.060]  Donald Trump's Mexico wall will never ever happen
[03:27:46.060 --> 03:27:48.060]  Going back
[03:27:48.060 --> 03:27:50.060]  Back in May he said this quote
[03:27:50.060 --> 03:27:52.060]  Whether his face was
[03:27:52.060 --> 03:27:54.060]  Buried in a plate full of Cheetos
[03:27:54.060 --> 03:27:56.060]  I'm not quite sure about that but he said
[03:27:56.060 --> 03:27:58.060]  One way or another he's not going to build the wall
[03:27:58.060 --> 03:28:00.060]  And if he does then I'll apologize
[03:28:00.060 --> 03:28:02.060]  To him on that day but he's not going to build
[03:28:02.060 --> 03:28:04.060]  That wall in Mexico he's not going to pay for it
[03:28:04.060 --> 03:28:06.060]  And if he does I will apologize on that day
[03:28:06.060 --> 03:28:08.060]  That's Glenn Beck well
[03:28:08.060 --> 03:28:10.060]  Glenn Beck may be about to eat his words
[03:28:10.060 --> 03:28:12.060]  Because according to this document
[03:28:12.060 --> 03:28:14.060]  The wall is getting ready
[03:28:14.060 --> 03:28:16.060]  For rapid build to cover
[03:28:16.060 --> 03:28:18.060]  The entire 2,000 mile stretch
[03:28:18.060 --> 03:28:20.060]  Of the border
[03:28:20.060 --> 03:28:22.060]  So we'll wait to see if that happens
[03:28:22.060 --> 03:28:24.060]  CNN
[03:28:24.060 --> 03:28:26.060]  Which accuses us of being fake news
[03:28:26.060 --> 03:28:28.060]  While itself being fake news
[03:28:28.060 --> 03:28:30.060]  And interviewing its own camera men
[03:28:30.060 --> 03:28:32.060]  And pretending they're
[03:28:32.060 --> 03:28:34.060]  Organic anti-Trump protesters
[03:28:34.060 --> 03:28:36.060]  Made an outrageously false claim
[03:28:36.060 --> 03:28:38.060]  On Monday afternoon this is out of the daily caller
[03:28:38.060 --> 03:28:40.060]  Surprise
[03:28:40.060 --> 03:28:42.060]  CNN makes a false claim and press
[03:28:42.060 --> 03:28:44.060]  Picks it up
[03:28:44.060 --> 03:28:46.060]  CNN made a false claim Monday afternoon
[03:28:46.060 --> 03:28:48.060]  And various journalists ran wild with it
[03:28:48.060 --> 03:28:50.060]  It all started with a segment on CNN's
[03:28:50.060 --> 03:28:52.060]  The lead which quoted prominent white
[03:28:52.060 --> 03:28:54.060]  Nationalist figure Richard Spencer
[03:28:54.060 --> 03:28:56.060]  As wondering if Jews were actually people
[03:28:56.060 --> 03:28:58.060]  So basically they got this
[03:28:58.060 --> 03:29:00.060]  Discussion panel
[03:29:00.060 --> 03:29:02.060]  Around the talking about the question
[03:29:02.060 --> 03:29:04.060]  Of whether Richard Spencer
[03:29:04.060 --> 03:29:06.060]  Was the head of the alt-right
[03:29:06.060 --> 03:29:08.060]  Was linked in with Breitbart
[03:29:08.060 --> 03:29:10.060]  Smear Association
[03:29:10.060 --> 03:29:12.060]  And then of course it turns out
[03:29:12.060 --> 03:29:14.060]  That the quote in which he said that
[03:29:14.060 --> 03:29:16.060]  Jews aren't actually people
[03:29:16.060 --> 03:29:18.060]  Was never made
[03:29:18.060 --> 03:29:20.060]  They completely invented this out of
[03:29:20.060 --> 03:29:22.060]  Whole cloth
[03:29:22.060 --> 03:29:24.060]  Paul you're going to break I'm sure
[03:29:24.060 --> 03:29:26.060]  Amazing Bloomberg this weekend
[03:29:26.060 --> 03:29:28.060]  Put on a fake tweet where Trump bragged
[03:29:28.060 --> 03:29:30.060]  Oh I lied to conservatives
[03:29:30.060 --> 03:29:32.060]  I robbed kids
[03:29:32.060 --> 03:29:34.060]  And then it was all fake
[03:29:34.060 --> 03:29:36.060]  I mean it's crazy
[03:29:36.060 --> 03:29:38.060]  It was completely made up
[03:29:38.060 --> 03:29:40.060]  He was talking about the left wing and the media
[03:29:40.060 --> 03:29:42.060]  Jews weren't even mentioned but they had a huge fake story
[03:29:42.060 --> 03:29:44.060]  About it and we'll be back to talk about it
[03:29:44.060 --> 03:29:54.060]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[03:30:14.060 --> 03:30:16.060]  During an appearance on Megan Kelly's show last night
[03:30:16.060 --> 03:30:18.060]  The Home Improvement star made a perceptive observation
[03:30:18.060 --> 03:30:20.060]  About Hollywood's obsession with Trump
[03:30:20.060 --> 03:30:22.060]  He was responding to leftist comedians
[03:30:22.060 --> 03:30:24.060]  Mocking student to be First Lady Melania Trump
[03:30:24.060 --> 03:30:26.060]  What I find odd in Hollywood
[03:30:26.060 --> 03:30:28.060]  Is that they didn't like Trump because he was a bully
[03:30:28.060 --> 03:30:30.060]  But if you had any kind of inkling that you were for Trump
[03:30:30.060 --> 03:30:32.060]  You got bullied for doing that
[03:30:32.060 --> 03:30:34.060]  Alan also questioned how left wing comedians
[03:30:34.060 --> 03:30:36.060]  Could make jokes based on Trump's
[03:30:36.060 --> 03:30:38.060]  Supposed dislike of homosexuals
[03:30:38.060 --> 03:30:40.060]  When there was little to no evidence
[03:30:40.060 --> 03:30:42.060]  That he was against gay people
[03:30:42.060 --> 03:30:44.060]  Then he waved the LGBT flag at the convention
[03:30:44.060 --> 03:30:46.060]  The actor said that Hollywood was playing
[03:30:46.060 --> 03:30:48.060]  A version of Chinese whispers where something
[03:30:48.060 --> 03:30:50.060]  Trump said ends up being completely
[03:30:50.060 --> 03:30:52.060]  Misconstrued as we previously discussed
[03:30:52.060 --> 03:30:54.060]  Hollywood is a place where diversity is celebrated
[03:30:54.060 --> 03:30:56.060]  Apart from diversity of opinion
[03:30:56.060 --> 03:31:24.060]  This has been Joe Biggs with Infowars.com
[03:31:24.060 --> 03:31:26.060]  Deep Cleanse doesn't hold back
[03:31:26.060 --> 03:31:28.060]  Instead of buying five, six, or even

[03:32:04.060 --> 03:32:06.060]  That we can produce

[03:32:08.060 --> 03:32:10.060]  DNA force for us. It's been something
[03:32:10.060 --> 03:32:12.060]  That I've been working on for a long time, Alex
[03:32:12.060 --> 03:32:14.060]  Because I think it's very, very important
[03:32:14.060 --> 03:32:16.060]  What the aging process is
[03:32:16.060 --> 03:32:18.060]  Is when the cell replicates
[03:32:18.060 --> 03:32:20.060]  We lose a little bit of our telomeres
[03:32:20.060 --> 03:32:22.060]  Telomeres are the little cups
[03:32:22.060 --> 03:32:24.060]  On the end of our chromosomes
[03:32:24.060 --> 03:32:26.060]  And when it runs out, you start dying
[03:32:26.060 --> 03:32:28.060]  We chose the PQQ because it has over
[03:32:28.060 --> 03:32:30.060]  175 different clinical trials
[03:32:30.060 --> 03:32:32.060]  It's one of the most effective substances

[03:32:34.060 --> 03:32:36.060]  It works to repair nerve growth
[03:32:36.060 --> 03:32:38.060]  Factor

[03:33:22.060 --> 03:33:26.060]  Your hair is burning
[03:33:26.060 --> 03:33:28.060]  We're back live this fourth hour
[03:33:28.060 --> 03:33:30.060]  Of the Alex Juncture before the break
[03:33:30.060 --> 03:33:32.060]  We're just getting into CNN
[03:33:32.060 --> 03:33:34.060]  Fake news
[03:33:34.060 --> 03:33:36.060]  Which had a panel discussion about
[03:33:36.060 --> 03:33:38.060]  An alt-right founder who questioned
[03:33:38.060 --> 03:33:40.060]  If Jews were people
[03:33:40.060 --> 03:33:42.060]  And this was not only a panel discussion
[03:33:42.060 --> 03:33:44.060]  While it was taking place
[03:33:44.060 --> 03:33:46.060]  All these other mainstream media
[03:33:46.060 --> 03:33:48.060]  Flash fake news reporters
[03:33:48.060 --> 03:33:50.060]  Were blowing up on Twitter about it
[03:33:50.060 --> 03:33:52.060]  Freaking out about it
[03:33:52.060 --> 03:33:54.060]  Because this alt-right founder
[03:33:54.060 --> 03:33:56.060]  This Richard Spencer guy
[03:33:56.060 --> 03:33:58.060]  He's a white nationalist
[03:33:58.060 --> 03:34:00.060]  We're not on the same page as him
[03:34:00.060 --> 03:34:02.060]  Which is why the media is really interested
[03:34:02.060 --> 03:34:04.060]  In holding him up as the leader of the alt-right
[03:34:04.060 --> 03:34:06.060]  Because he's an actual white nationalist
[03:34:06.060 --> 03:34:08.060]  But this quote
[03:34:08.060 --> 03:34:10.060]  Supposedly
[03:34:10.060 --> 03:34:12.060]  In which he said that Jews aren't people
[03:34:12.060 --> 03:34:14.060]  It doesn't exist
[03:34:14.060 --> 03:34:16.060]  You can go to the video of the speech
[03:34:16.060 --> 03:34:18.060]  That they're talking about
[03:34:18.060 --> 03:34:20.060]  40 seconds in
[03:34:20.060 --> 03:34:22.060]  It's in this article
[03:34:22.060 --> 03:34:24.060]  CNN makes a false claim and press picks it up
[03:34:24.060 --> 03:34:26.060]  He's clearly talking about the media
[03:34:26.060 --> 03:34:28.060]  And the left
[03:34:28.060 --> 03:34:30.060]  He doesn't even say anyone's not people
[03:34:30.060 --> 03:34:32.060]  He doesn't even say the word Jews
[03:34:32.060 --> 03:34:34.060]  And yet CNN had a whole
[03:34:34.060 --> 03:34:36.060]  Segment bashing him about it
[03:34:36.060 --> 03:34:38.060]  Everyone was freaking out on Twitter
[03:34:38.060 --> 03:34:40.060]  It was absolutely ridiculous
[03:34:40.060 --> 03:34:42.060]  So again, CNN
[03:34:42.060 --> 03:34:44.060]  The aficionados of fake news
[03:34:44.060 --> 03:34:46.060]  Coming out with fake news once again
[03:34:46.060 --> 03:34:48.060]  This story just broke
[03:34:48.060 --> 03:34:50.060]  Now I was going to write a story about this
[03:34:50.060 --> 03:34:52.060]  Because I saw it just before I came on the air
[03:34:52.060 --> 03:34:54.060]  Absolutely shocking
[03:34:54.060 --> 03:34:56.060]  You want to talk about the tolerant left
[03:34:56.060 --> 03:34:58.060]  We had
[03:34:58.060 --> 03:35:00.060]  The tweets earlier that I read out
[03:35:00.060 --> 03:35:02.060]  In fact let's read those again
[03:35:02.060 --> 03:35:04.060]  Every single day if you go to Twitter and you type in
[03:35:04.060 --> 03:35:06.060]  You type in the search box
[03:35:06.060 --> 03:35:08.060]  Accept white people in brackets
[03:35:08.060 --> 03:35:10.060]  You will come up with tweets like this
[03:35:10.060 --> 03:35:12.060]  Morning everyone
[03:35:12.060 --> 03:35:14.060]  Accept white people
[03:35:14.060 --> 03:35:16.060]  Have an awesome day
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:18.060]  I hope a white person dies today
[03:35:18.060 --> 03:35:20.060]  Here's another one
[03:35:20.060 --> 03:35:22.060]  As of just a couple of hours ago
[03:35:22.060 --> 03:35:24.060]  Another peaceful anti-racist
[03:35:24.060 --> 03:35:25.060]  Progressive
[03:35:25.060 --> 03:35:26.060]  Good morning to everyone
[03:35:26.060 --> 03:35:28.060]  Accept white people
[03:35:28.060 --> 03:35:30.060]  Who say that we have to give Trump a chance
[03:35:30.060 --> 03:35:32.060]  And wish him a successful presidency
[03:35:32.060 --> 03:35:34.060]  Please choke
[03:35:34.060 --> 03:35:36.060]  These are the anti-racist tolerant liberals
[03:35:36.060 --> 03:35:38.060]  Well now you have
[03:35:38.060 --> 03:35:40.060]  The national editor
[03:35:40.060 --> 03:35:42.060]  Of Politico
[03:35:42.060 --> 03:35:44.060]  Yesterday of course deleted it immediately
[03:35:44.060 --> 03:35:46.060]  When he got some backlash
[03:35:46.060 --> 03:35:48.060]  Gave out the address
[03:35:48.060 --> 03:35:50.060]  Of Richard B. Spencer
[03:35:50.060 --> 03:35:52.060]  The same guy that CNN made up
[03:35:52.060 --> 03:35:54.060]  A fake quote about
[03:35:54.060 --> 03:35:56.060]  And basically called on his followers
[03:35:56.060 --> 03:35:58.060]  Bearing in mind this is the national editor
[03:35:58.060 --> 03:36:00.060]  Of Politico
[03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:02.060]  Michael Hirsch
[03:36:02.060 --> 03:36:04.060]  Called on his followers
[03:36:04.060 --> 03:36:06.060]  To basically go and violently attack someone
[03:36:06.060 --> 03:36:08.060]  Because of their opinions
[03:36:08.060 --> 03:36:10.060]  Because of their beliefs
[03:36:10.060 --> 03:36:12.060]  The left is tolerant and progressive
[03:36:12.060 --> 03:36:14.060]  Embraces diversity
[03:36:14.060 --> 03:36:16.060]  Except when it comes to diversity
[03:36:16.060 --> 03:36:18.060]  Of opinion then they want to beat you
[03:36:18.060 --> 03:36:20.060]  To a bloody pulp
[03:36:20.060 --> 03:36:22.060]  So he gives out the address
[03:36:22.060 --> 03:36:24.060]  The home address
[03:36:24.060 --> 03:36:26.060]  Docs' Richard B. Spencer
[03:36:26.060 --> 03:36:28.060]  Encourages people to go and attack him
[03:36:28.060 --> 03:36:30.060]  With baseball bats
[03:36:30.060 --> 03:36:32.060]  This is the national
[03:36:32.060 --> 03:36:34.060]  Editor of Politico
[03:36:34.060 --> 03:36:36.060]  I was going to write this article
[03:36:36.060 --> 03:36:38.060]  Because it wasn't up yet
[03:36:38.060 --> 03:36:40.060]  Daily call has scooped it
[03:36:40.060 --> 03:36:42.060]  National Politico editor resigns
[03:36:42.060 --> 03:36:44.060]  After publishing home addresses
[03:36:44.060 --> 03:36:46.060]  Of alt-right icon Richard Spencer
[03:36:46.060 --> 03:36:48.060]  Advocating for baseball bats
[03:36:48.060 --> 03:36:50.060]  Because he's a peaceful, tolerant liberal
[03:36:50.060 --> 03:36:52.060]  He wants to cave in people's heads
[03:36:52.060 --> 03:36:54.060]  With baseball bats
[03:36:54.060 --> 03:36:56.060]  Because they have a different opinion to him
[03:36:56.060 --> 03:36:58.060]  And that's progressive
[03:36:58.060 --> 03:37:00.060]  National editor at Politico
[03:37:00.060 --> 03:37:02.060]  Michael Hirsch resigned
[03:37:02.060 --> 03:37:04.060]  After publishing the home address
[03:37:04.060 --> 03:37:06.060]  Of alt-right figurehead Richard Spencer
[03:37:06.060 --> 03:37:08.060]  This is the big boogeyman that say
[03:37:08.060 --> 03:37:10.060]  You know, the media is pinning
[03:37:10.060 --> 03:37:12.060]  Everything on because he is an actual
[03:37:12.060 --> 03:37:14.060]  Basically a neo-nazi
[03:37:14.060 --> 03:37:16.060]  But still
[03:37:16.060 --> 03:37:18.060]  You don't advocate killing people
[03:37:18.060 --> 03:37:20.060]  No matter what
[03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:22.060]  Political beliefs they hold
[03:37:22.060 --> 03:37:24.060]  That's intolerant, that's wrong
[03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:26.060]  That's not progressive
[03:37:26.060 --> 03:37:28.060]  Politico confirmed his resignation
[03:37:28.060 --> 03:37:30.060]  Following requests for comment
[03:37:30.060 --> 03:37:32.060]  From the Daily Caller
[03:37:32.060 --> 03:37:34.060]  This is his quote
[03:37:34.060 --> 03:37:36.060]  This is what the national editor of Politico wrote
[03:37:36.060 --> 03:37:38.060]  On his own Facebook page
[03:37:38.060 --> 03:37:40.060]  Exercise your rights
[03:37:40.060 --> 03:37:42.060]  As decent Americans Hirsch wrote
[03:37:42.060 --> 03:37:44.060]  In a public Facebook post
[03:37:44.060 --> 03:37:46.060]  Here are his two addresses
[03:37:46.060 --> 03:37:48.060]  Now you go down onto the comments
[03:37:48.060 --> 03:37:50.060]  And I don't think they've got them in this article
[03:37:50.060 --> 03:37:52.060]  In fact they probably have here
[03:37:52.060 --> 03:37:54.060]  So he gets confronted by one of his followers
[03:37:54.060 --> 03:37:56.060]  On Facebook who says
[03:37:56.060 --> 03:37:58.060]  Why are you giving out his addresses
[03:37:58.060 --> 03:38:00.060]  You want us to send him a letter
[03:38:00.060 --> 03:38:02.060]  Well no, Michael Hirsch
[03:38:02.060 --> 03:38:04.060]  The editor of Politico responds
[03:38:04.060 --> 03:38:06.060]  In a peaceful, tolerant manner
[03:38:06.060 --> 03:38:08.060]  And says this
[03:38:08.060 --> 03:38:10.060]  I wasn't thinking of an effing letter
[03:38:10.060 --> 03:38:12.060]  He lives part of the time next door
[03:38:12.060 --> 03:38:14.060]  To me in Arlington
[03:38:14.060 --> 03:38:16.060]  Our grandfathers brought baseball bats
[03:38:16.060 --> 03:38:18.060]  To bond meetings
[03:38:18.060 --> 03:38:20.060]  Want to join me
[03:38:20.060 --> 03:38:22.060]  So he's openly inciting violence
[03:38:22.060 --> 03:38:24.060]  Using baseball bats
[03:38:24.060 --> 03:38:26.060]  Against Richard B. Spencer
[03:38:26.060 --> 03:38:28.060]  Because he thinks he's a neo-nazi
[03:38:28.060 --> 03:38:30.060]  Now bear in mind
[03:38:30.060 --> 03:38:32.060]  That leftists think that Donald Trump
[03:38:32.060 --> 03:38:34.060]  Is literally Hitler
[03:38:34.060 --> 03:38:36.060]  This is the hysteria
[03:38:36.060 --> 03:38:38.060]  That they're pushing
[03:38:38.060 --> 03:38:40.060]  This is why Trump wears a bulletproof vest
[03:38:40.060 --> 03:38:42.060]  This is why reportedly he carries his own gun
[03:38:42.060 --> 03:38:44.060]  This is why he's got his own security
[03:38:44.060 --> 03:38:46.060]  Secret service security
[03:38:46.060 --> 03:38:48.060]  This is why Trump Tower is on
[03:38:48.060 --> 03:38:50.060]  Complete lockdown
[03:38:50.060 --> 03:38:52.060]  This is why there's no fly zone around Manhattan
[03:38:52.060 --> 03:38:54.060]  Because the mainstream media
[03:38:54.060 --> 03:38:56.060]  The fake news
[03:38:56.060 --> 03:38:58.060]  This is the only thing they actually try to do properly
[03:38:58.060 --> 03:39:00.060]  Is incite crazy people
[03:39:00.060 --> 03:39:02.060]  To kill Trump
[03:39:02.060 --> 03:39:04.060]  Incite crazy people
[03:39:04.060 --> 03:39:06.060]  To attack Trump supporters
[03:39:06.060 --> 03:39:08.060]  This is the national editor
[03:39:08.060 --> 03:39:10.060]  Of Politico magazine
[03:39:10.060 --> 03:39:12.060]  Encouraging people
[03:39:12.060 --> 03:39:14.060]  To take baseball bats
[03:39:14.060 --> 03:39:16.060]  To the home address of someone
[03:39:16.060 --> 03:39:18.060]  Giving out his address
[03:39:18.060 --> 03:39:20.060]  Encouraging people to violently attack him
[03:39:20.060 --> 03:39:22.060]  This is the tolerant left
[03:39:22.060 --> 03:39:24.060]  Meanwhile the SPLC says
[03:39:24.060 --> 03:39:26.060]  That Trump supporters
[03:39:26.060 --> 03:39:28.060]  Are racist, are violent
[03:39:28.060 --> 03:39:30.060]  Are going to commit hate crimes
[03:39:30.060 --> 03:39:32.060]  Meanwhile this is happening
[03:39:32.060 --> 03:39:34.060]  Hate crimes against Trump supporters
[03:39:34.060 --> 03:39:36.060]  Over the last two weeks
[03:39:36.060 --> 03:39:38.060]  How many times do we have to see this
[03:39:38.060 --> 03:39:40.060]  But again it's the same as after Brexit
[03:39:40.060 --> 03:39:42.060]  They said oh there's all these hate crimes
[03:39:42.060 --> 03:39:44.060]  Against foreigners turned out to be complete BS
[03:39:44.060 --> 03:39:46.060]  It was because
[03:39:46.060 --> 03:39:48.060]  Butthurt Weiney leftists were
[03:39:48.060 --> 03:39:50.060]  Reporting hate crimes
[03:39:50.060 --> 03:39:52.060]  Which were basically people disagreeing with them
[03:39:52.060 --> 03:39:54.060]  And somebody saying a mean thing
[03:39:54.060 --> 03:39:56.060]  But again this is out the American mirror
[03:39:56.060 --> 03:39:58.060]  Trump supporters American flag stolen
[03:39:58.060 --> 03:40:00.060]  Vandals paint red swastika on front door
[03:40:00.060 --> 03:40:02.060]  A 77 year old Vietnam war veteran
[03:40:02.060 --> 03:40:04.060]  Is not going to be intimidated by thugs
[03:40:04.060 --> 03:40:06.060]  Who spray painted a swastika
[03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:08.060]  On his front door and stolen American flag
[03:40:08.060 --> 03:40:10.060]  From his yard
[03:40:10.060 --> 03:40:12.060]  This is Thomas Rod Kowsky
[03:40:12.060 --> 03:40:14.060]  Of Silver Spring, Maryland
[03:40:14.060 --> 03:40:16.060]  Who late last month
[03:40:16.060 --> 03:40:18.060]  Had his Trump Penn sign stolen
[03:40:18.060 --> 03:40:20.060]  From his front lawn
[03:40:20.060 --> 03:40:22.060]  And now they're attacking his property
[03:40:22.060 --> 03:40:24.060]  Stealing his American flag
[03:40:24.060 --> 03:40:26.060]  Painting Nazi swastikas
[03:40:26.060 --> 03:40:28.060]  On his door
[03:40:28.060 --> 03:40:30.060]  Because these people are tolerant
[03:40:30.060 --> 03:40:32.060]  Peaceful progressives
[03:40:32.060 --> 03:40:34.060]  Here's another one out of EAG
[03:40:34.060 --> 03:40:36.060]  And again
[03:40:36.060 --> 03:40:38.060]  You look at it on the flip side
[03:40:38.060 --> 03:40:40.060]  As we see over and over again
[03:40:40.060 --> 03:40:42.060]  Leftists invent fake hate crimes
[03:40:42.060 --> 03:40:44.060]  To make themselves look like victims
[03:40:44.060 --> 03:40:46.060]  Meanwhile carrying our actual hate crimes
[03:40:46.060 --> 03:40:48.060]  Against people with whom they disagree
[03:40:48.060 --> 03:40:50.060]  Because they're really honest
[03:40:50.060 --> 03:40:52.060]  And straight up like that
[03:40:52.060 --> 03:40:54.060]  Bowling Green student lied about
[03:40:54.060 --> 03:40:56.060]  Attacked by Trump supporters
[03:40:56.060 --> 03:40:58.060]  Bowling Green police are exposing
[03:40:58.060 --> 03:41:00.060]  Bowling Green State University student
[03:41:00.060 --> 03:41:02.060]  Alicia Long as a liar
[03:41:02.060 --> 03:41:04.060]  After she allegedly concocted a story
[03:41:04.060 --> 03:41:06.060]  About being attacked by Trump supporters
[03:41:06.060 --> 03:41:08.060]  The day after his historic election
[03:41:08.060 --> 03:41:10.060]  So again just like the Muslim who claimed
[03:41:10.060 --> 03:41:12.060]  She was attacked
[03:41:12.060 --> 03:41:14.060]  Hate crime against her that proved to be
[03:41:14.060 --> 03:41:16.060]  Complete BS
[03:41:16.060 --> 03:41:18.060]  Bowling Green police looked into this
[03:41:18.060 --> 03:41:20.060]  And even in the place where she said it happened
[03:41:20.060 --> 03:41:22.060]  She completely made it up
[03:41:22.060 --> 03:41:24.060]  So again
[03:41:24.060 --> 03:41:26.060]  Real hate crimes taking place against Trump supporters
[03:41:26.060 --> 03:41:28.060]  You saw the shocking footage
[03:41:28.060 --> 03:41:30.060]  Out of Chicago about 10 days ago
[03:41:30.060 --> 03:41:32.060]  Where the Trump supporter was violently beaten
[03:41:32.060 --> 03:41:34.060]  Dragged in his vehicle
[03:41:34.060 --> 03:41:36.060]  By a mob
[03:41:36.060 --> 03:41:38.060]  Who were later charged but not charged
[03:41:38.060 --> 03:41:40.060]  With a hate crime
[03:41:40.060 --> 03:41:42.060]  And now we have this
[03:41:42.060 --> 03:41:44.060]  This was up on infowars.com last night
[03:41:44.060 --> 03:41:46.060]  Not
[03:41:46.060 --> 03:41:48.060]  Making fun of
[03:41:48.060 --> 03:41:50.060]  Butthurt leftists deemed a hate crime
[03:41:50.060 --> 03:41:52.060]  So somebody
[03:41:52.060 --> 03:41:54.060]  Actually just left a note
[03:41:54.060 --> 03:41:56.060]  Outside an office of student
[03:41:56.060 --> 03:41:58.060]  Diversity building
[03:41:58.060 --> 03:42:00.060]  At Edgewood College in Madison
[03:42:00.060 --> 03:42:02.060]  Saying quote
[03:42:02.060 --> 03:42:04.060]  That's what the note said
[03:42:04.060 --> 03:42:06.060]  They left it in the window of this building
[03:42:06.060 --> 03:42:08.060]  The
[03:42:08.060 --> 03:42:10.060]  Officials in charge of this organization
[03:42:10.060 --> 03:42:12.060]  This university
[03:42:12.060 --> 03:42:14.060]  Immediately treated it as a hate crime
[03:42:14.060 --> 03:42:16.060]  Called the Wisconsin police
[03:42:16.060 --> 03:42:18.060]  Who were also treating it
[03:42:18.060 --> 03:42:20.060]  As a hate crime
[03:42:20.060 --> 03:42:22.060]  So you look at Wisconsin hate crime law
[03:42:22.060 --> 03:42:24.060]  Which
[03:42:24.060 --> 03:42:26.060]  Relates to race, religion, color, disability
[03:42:26.060 --> 03:42:28.060]  Sexual orientation, national origin
[03:42:28.060 --> 03:42:30.060]  Or ancestry
[03:42:30.060 --> 03:42:32.060]  So if a crime has been committed
[03:42:32.060 --> 03:42:34.060]  And it's motivated by any of those factors
[03:42:34.060 --> 03:42:36.060]  Then it's a hate crime
[03:42:38.060 --> 03:42:40.060]  But how is leaving a note
[03:42:40.060 --> 03:42:42.060]  Gloting about the result of an election
[03:42:42.060 --> 03:42:44.060]  How is that a crime?
[03:42:44.060 --> 03:42:46.060]  Okay
[03:42:46.060 --> 03:42:48.060]  For it to be a hate crime
[03:42:48.060 --> 03:42:50.060]  It has to target people
[03:42:50.060 --> 03:42:52.060]  It has to be motivated by racism
[03:42:52.060 --> 03:42:54.060]  By sexism, by xenophobia
[03:42:54.060 --> 03:42:56.060]  Any of those factors, fine
[03:42:56.060 --> 03:42:58.060]  But how is leaving a note
[03:42:58.060 --> 03:43:00.060]  Which is a joke
[03:43:00.060 --> 03:43:02.060]  In the window of a building
[03:43:02.060 --> 03:43:04.060]  How is that even a crime to begin with
[03:43:04.060 --> 03:43:06.060]  Yet not only is the university
[03:43:06.060 --> 03:43:08.060]  Treating it as a hate crime
[03:43:08.060 --> 03:43:10.060]  So Madison
[03:43:10.060 --> 03:43:12.060]  Wisconsin police
[03:43:12.060 --> 03:43:14.060]  So again, they've been beating up Trump supporters
[03:43:14.060 --> 03:43:16.060]  Verbally abusing them
[03:43:16.060 --> 03:43:18.060]  Choking them, attacking them
[03:43:18.060 --> 03:43:20.060]  Again
[03:43:20.060 --> 03:43:22.060]  Barely even in the media narrative
[03:43:22.060 --> 03:43:24.060]  Nobody covers it, actual hate crimes
[03:43:24.060 --> 03:43:26.060]  Against people because of their race
[03:43:26.060 --> 03:43:28.060]  Because of their political beliefs
[03:43:28.060 --> 03:43:30.060]  Actual hate crimes taking place
[03:43:30.060 --> 03:43:32.060]  Meanwhile, the left
[03:43:32.060 --> 03:43:34.060]  Is creating fake hate crimes
[03:43:34.060 --> 03:43:36.060]  That never happened
[03:43:36.060 --> 03:43:38.060]  And then treating
[03:43:38.060 --> 03:43:40.060]  Those that left in window
[03:43:40.060 --> 03:43:42.060]  Was saying suck it up pussies
[03:43:42.060 --> 03:43:44.060]  As hate crimes
[03:43:44.060 --> 03:43:46.060]  This is how the left behaves
[03:43:46.060 --> 03:43:48.060]  This is why
[03:43:48.060 --> 03:43:50.060]  Trump got in in the first place
[03:43:50.060 --> 03:43:52.060]  Because many Americans
[03:43:52.060 --> 03:43:54.060]  Were sick to the back teeth
[03:43:54.060 --> 03:43:56.060]  Of these whining cry bullies
[03:43:56.060 --> 03:43:58.060]  And their completely hypocritical behaviour
[03:43:58.060 --> 03:44:00.060]  None that very subject
[03:44:00.060 --> 03:44:02.060]  Tim Allen
[03:44:02.060 --> 03:44:04.060]  The actor, the Home Improvement Star
[03:44:04.060 --> 03:44:06.060]  Has come out and said that Hollywood calls Trump a bully
[03:44:06.060 --> 03:44:08.060]  Then bullies anyone who supports Trump
[03:44:08.060 --> 03:44:10.060]  Let's get this clip ready
[03:44:10.060 --> 03:44:12.060]  This is Tim Allen on
[03:44:12.060 --> 03:44:14.060]  Megan Kelly last night
[03:44:14.060 --> 03:44:16.060]  Talking about the supreme hypocrisy
[03:44:16.060 --> 03:44:18.060]  In Hollywood, let's go to the clip
[03:44:18.060 --> 03:44:20.060]  So
[03:44:20.060 --> 03:44:22.060]  Gigi Hadid
[03:44:22.060 --> 03:44:24.060]  Mocking our next first lady
[03:44:24.060 --> 03:44:26.060]  Appropriate or not
[03:44:26.060 --> 03:44:28.060]  I don't think it's appropriate in that venue
[03:44:28.060 --> 03:44:30.060]  But again, this is a
[03:44:30.060 --> 03:44:32.060]  I'm not a spokesman for Hollywood
[03:44:32.060 --> 03:44:34.060]  I'm a comedian
[03:44:34.060 --> 03:44:36.060]  I tour around the country
[03:44:36.060 --> 03:44:38.060]  And I do comedy and I do a show that leans
[03:44:38.060 --> 03:44:40.060]  We have a point of view
[03:44:40.060 --> 03:44:42.060]  Your character is a conservative
[03:44:42.060 --> 03:44:44.060]  But it's written by liberals
[03:44:44.060 --> 03:44:46.060]  We have a liberal staff
[03:44:46.060 --> 03:44:48.060]  We have a sense of humor about ourselves
[03:44:48.060 --> 03:44:50.060]  And there's a point of view
[03:44:50.060 --> 03:44:52.060]  And there's a place to do it
[03:44:52.060 --> 03:44:54.060]  What I find odd in Hollywood
[03:44:54.060 --> 03:44:56.060]  Is that they didn't like Trump because he was a bully
[03:44:56.060 --> 03:44:58.060]  But if you had
[03:44:58.060 --> 03:45:00.060]  Any kind of inkling that you refer to Trump
[03:45:00.060 --> 03:45:02.060]  You got bullied for doing that
[03:45:02.060 --> 03:45:04.060]  It gets a little
[03:45:04.060 --> 03:45:06.060]  Hypocritical to me
[03:45:06.060 --> 03:45:08.060]  You're always on the defense with this
[03:45:08.060 --> 03:45:10.060]  But mostly what I'm finding
[03:45:10.060 --> 03:45:12.060]  Is there's no source material
[03:45:12.060 --> 03:45:14.060]  For comedians
[03:45:14.060 --> 03:45:16.060]  If I want to find a joke on the show
[03:45:16.060 --> 03:45:18.060]  We go up river to find the joke
[03:45:18.060 --> 03:45:20.060]  And he was against homosexual somehow
[03:45:20.060 --> 03:45:22.060]  And I said
[03:45:22.060 --> 03:45:24.060]  Donald Trump?
[03:45:24.060 --> 03:45:26.060]  And he didn't wave the flag at the convention
[03:45:26.060 --> 03:45:28.060]  The LBGD flag
[03:45:28.060 --> 03:45:30.060]  And I said that was an unusual
[03:45:30.060 --> 03:45:32.060]  Face on that but Donald Trump
[03:45:32.060 --> 03:45:34.060]  But a close associate to him
[03:45:34.060 --> 03:45:36.060]  I don't see it and so I can't make a joke about it
[03:45:36.060 --> 03:45:38.060]  I feel like we're playing that game
[03:45:38.060 --> 03:45:40.060]  I played when I was a kid on telephone
[03:45:40.060 --> 03:45:42.060]  Did you ever play that in high school?
[03:45:42.060 --> 03:45:44.060]  That's what's happening
[03:45:44.060 --> 03:45:46.060]  It's only funny to me because I'm a comedian
[03:45:46.060 --> 03:45:48.060]  I can do this but it's very difficult
[03:45:48.060 --> 03:45:50.060]  In Hollywood to find any source material
[03:45:50.060 --> 03:45:52.060]  That would
[03:45:52.060 --> 03:45:54.060]  So again that's Tim Allen
[03:45:54.060 --> 03:45:56.060]  Last night on Fox News saying basically
[03:45:56.060 --> 03:45:58.060]  Hollywood said that Trump was a bully
[03:45:58.060 --> 03:46:00.060]  He was hateful, he was a bigot
[03:46:00.060 --> 03:46:02.060]  And yet they behave like hateful
[03:46:02.060 --> 03:46:04.060]  Bigoted bullies
[03:46:04.060 --> 03:46:06.060]  And this is why James Wood had to
[03:46:06.060 --> 03:46:08.060]  Basically give up on his career
[03:46:08.060 --> 03:46:10.060]  Back a few years ago
[03:46:10.060 --> 03:46:12.060]  When he vehemently began to criticize Barack Obama
[03:46:12.060 --> 03:46:14.060]  Because doing that
[03:46:14.060 --> 03:46:16.060]  In Hollywood is career
[03:46:16.060 --> 03:46:18.060]  Suicide because left wingers
[03:46:18.060 --> 03:46:20.060]  Aren't very tolerant people
[03:46:20.060 --> 03:46:22.060]  They're all for diversity
[03:46:22.060 --> 03:46:24.060]  Until it comes to diversity of opinion
[03:46:24.060 --> 03:46:26.060]  Again this was out the Huffington Post
[03:46:26.060 --> 03:46:28.060]  We've talked about this before
[03:46:28.060 --> 03:46:30.060]  This was a quote
[03:46:30.060 --> 03:46:32.060]  From Victoria Jackson
[03:46:32.060 --> 03:46:34.060]  A former Saturday Night Live cast member
[03:46:34.060 --> 03:46:36.060]  Who said quote, in LA
[03:46:36.060 --> 03:46:38.060]  There is a secret underground group
[03:46:38.060 --> 03:46:40.060]  Of showbiz conservatives
[03:46:40.060 --> 03:46:42.060]  It started with two people in the year 2000
[03:46:42.060 --> 03:46:44.060]  I was at the fifth or tenth meeting
[03:46:44.060 --> 03:46:46.060]  And now there are over 2,000 people
[03:46:46.060 --> 03:46:48.060]  Again
[03:46:48.060 --> 03:46:50.060]  They don't want to lose their career
[03:46:50.060 --> 03:46:52.060]  And conservatives are blacklisted
[03:46:52.060 --> 03:46:54.060]  They have to have secret societies
[03:46:54.060 --> 03:46:56.060]  And conservatives in Hollywood
[03:46:56.060 --> 03:46:58.060]  Because liberals are so intolerant
[03:46:58.060 --> 03:47:00.060]  That if they get any
[03:47:00.060 --> 03:47:02.060]  Incling of somebody with a different opinion
[03:47:02.060 --> 03:47:04.060]  They will shut down their career
[03:47:04.060 --> 03:47:06.060]  In an instant
[03:47:06.060 --> 03:47:08.060]  And you see a little bit of that now
[03:47:08.060 --> 03:47:10.060]  With Kanye West
[03:47:10.060 --> 03:47:12.060]  Who of course has been a little bit crazy
[03:47:12.060 --> 03:47:14.060]  For a few years now
[03:47:14.060 --> 03:47:16.060]  But as soon as he comes out against Hillary Clinton
[03:47:16.060 --> 03:47:18.060]  Against the left
[03:47:18.060 --> 03:47:20.060]  And against the celebrity elite
[03:47:20.060 --> 03:47:22.060]  Represented by Beyonce and Jay-Z
[03:47:22.060 --> 03:47:24.060]  They lock him up in a psych ward
[03:47:24.060 --> 03:47:26.060]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:47:26.060 --> 03:47:28.060]  Still trying to get him on the show today
[03:47:28.060 --> 03:47:30.060]  Maybe we can beam that into existence
[03:47:30.060 --> 03:47:32.060]  Let's go on to some other news here
[03:47:32.060 --> 03:47:34.060]  In the final few minutes of this segment
[03:47:34.060 --> 03:47:36.060]  Sweden is having
[03:47:36.060 --> 03:47:38.060]  To build entire new cities
[03:47:38.060 --> 03:47:40.060]  To accommodate the massive influx
[03:47:40.060 --> 03:47:42.060]  Of Muslim migrants
[03:47:42.060 --> 03:47:44.060]  Even as their own population labors under
[03:47:44.060 --> 03:47:46.060]  Increasing property prices
[03:47:46.060 --> 03:47:48.060]  No property for them
[03:47:48.060 --> 03:47:50.060]  But they're building entire new cities
[03:47:50.060 --> 03:47:52.060]  Because that's liberal and progressive
[03:47:52.060 --> 03:47:54.060]  Even as their rape skyrockets
[03:47:54.060 --> 03:47:56.060]  Even as people are being attacked
[03:47:56.060 --> 03:47:58.060]  But you know, I guess the solution
[03:47:58.060 --> 03:48:00.060]  As they're doing is to just
[03:48:00.060 --> 03:48:02.060]  Give ISIS jihadist jobs
[03:48:02.060 --> 03:48:04.060]  And put them in the government
[03:48:04.060 --> 03:48:06.060]  Yes, that's actually now happening in Sweden
[03:48:06.060 --> 03:48:08.060]  The Express reports
[03:48:08.060 --> 03:48:10.060]  Run over in Germany
[03:48:10.060 --> 03:48:12.060]  Germans are strangers in their own country
[03:48:12.060 --> 03:48:14.060]  Due to Muslim infiltration
[03:48:14.060 --> 03:48:16.060]  A third of Germans feel they are strangers
[03:48:16.060 --> 03:48:18.060]  In their own country due to an infiltration
[03:48:18.060 --> 03:48:20.060]  By Muslims, a new study has revealed
[03:48:20.060 --> 03:48:22.060]  A new survey found 34.7%
[03:48:22.060 --> 03:48:24.060]  Of Germans completely
[03:48:24.060 --> 03:48:26.060]  Or slightly agree with the view
[03:48:26.060 --> 03:48:28.060]  Quote, because of the many Muslims
[03:48:28.060 --> 03:48:30.060]  I sometimes feel like a stranger in my own country
[03:48:30.060 --> 03:48:32.060]  Meanwhile
[03:48:32.060 --> 03:48:34.060]  German court says
[03:48:34.060 --> 03:48:36.060]  Islamic Sharia patrol is legal
[03:48:36.060 --> 03:48:38.060]  The German court has thrown out
[03:48:38.060 --> 03:48:40.060]  A case against a group of extremist
[03:48:40.060 --> 03:48:42.060]  Salafist Sharia police for the second time
[03:48:42.060 --> 03:48:44.060]  Claiming they have not broken the law
[03:48:44.060 --> 03:48:46.060]  So again, we had the media lecturing us
[03:48:46.060 --> 03:48:48.060]  For the past what, five, six years
[03:48:48.060 --> 03:48:50.060]  Muslim no-go areas don't exist
[03:48:50.060 --> 03:48:52.060]  That's conspiracy theory
[03:48:52.060 --> 03:48:54.060]  Meanwhile, film crews go to these
[03:48:54.060 --> 03:48:56.060]  Areas and are attacked
[03:48:56.060 --> 03:48:58.060]  We were chased out one ourselves
[03:48:58.060 --> 03:49:00.060]  Now they're saying that these Muslim
[03:49:00.060 --> 03:49:02.060]  Sharia patrols
[03:49:02.060 --> 03:49:04.060]  Where they go up to people on the street
[03:49:04.060 --> 03:49:06.060]  Groups of Muslims in high visibility jackets
[03:49:06.060 --> 03:49:08.060]  If they're drinking alcohol
[03:49:08.060 --> 03:49:10.060]  They tell them to stop
[03:49:10.060 --> 03:49:12.060]  If they're holding hands, they tell them to stop
[03:49:12.060 --> 03:49:14.060]  They harass people who they think
[03:49:14.060 --> 03:49:16.060]  Might be gay
[03:49:16.060 --> 03:49:18.060]  A court in Germany
[03:49:18.060 --> 03:49:20.060]  Has said that is not illegal
[03:49:20.060 --> 03:49:22.060]  Because they were not wearing
[03:49:22.060 --> 03:49:24.060]  Uniforms that were quote
[03:49:24.060 --> 03:49:26.060]  Suggestively militant
[03:49:26.060 --> 03:49:28.060]  So I guess they have to be wearing
[03:49:28.060 --> 03:49:30.060]  Full camo and body armour
[03:49:30.060 --> 03:49:32.060]  For that to be intimidating
[03:49:32.060 --> 03:49:34.060]  Because it's not intimidating at all
[03:49:34.060 --> 03:49:36.060]  Is it for six or seven
[03:49:36.060 --> 03:49:38.060]  Muslim guys in
[03:49:38.060 --> 03:49:40.060]  High visibility jackets to come up
[03:49:40.060 --> 03:49:42.060]  Screaming at people telling them
[03:49:42.060 --> 03:49:44.060]  To stop drinking alcohol
[03:49:44.060 --> 03:49:46.060]  Stop holding hands
[03:49:46.060 --> 03:49:48.060]  No, that's not intimidating at all
[03:49:48.060 --> 03:49:50.060]  Okay, that's now legal in Germany
[03:49:50.060 --> 03:49:52.060]  So good luck with that
[03:49:52.060 --> 03:49:54.060]  Angela Merkel seeking a new term
[03:49:54.060 --> 03:49:56.060]  We'll see what happens
[03:49:56.060 --> 03:49:58.060]  Meanwhile
[03:49:58.060 --> 03:50:00.060]  Over in airstrip one
[03:50:00.060 --> 03:50:02.060]  Milo Yenopoulos has basically
[03:50:02.060 --> 03:50:04.060]  Been put on a government extremist
[03:50:04.060 --> 03:50:06.060]  List for speaking out against Islam
[03:50:06.060 --> 03:50:08.060]  They banned him from
[03:50:08.060 --> 03:50:10.060]  Giving a speech at his own school
[03:50:10.060 --> 03:50:12.060]  After the government's counter
[03:50:12.060 --> 03:50:14.060]  Extremism unit
[03:50:14.060 --> 03:50:16.060]  Intervened
[03:50:16.060 --> 03:50:18.060]  So Milo has been out giving
[03:50:18.060 --> 03:50:20.060]  Speeches about actual extremism
[03:50:20.060 --> 03:50:22.060]  In terms of
[03:50:22.060 --> 03:50:24.060]  Islamists
[03:50:24.060 --> 03:50:26.060]  He tries to come back to the UK
[03:50:26.060 --> 03:50:28.060]  And give a speech in front of his old school
[03:50:28.060 --> 03:50:30.060]  Warning people about the dangers of extremism
[03:50:30.060 --> 03:50:32.060]  And he as a gay man
[03:50:32.060 --> 03:50:34.060]  Is put on an extremist list
[03:50:34.060 --> 03:50:36.060]  Absolutely chilling
[03:50:36.060 --> 03:50:38.060]  This is what Milo said on Facebook
[03:50:38.060 --> 03:50:40.060]  Given that he's banned from Twitter
[03:50:40.060 --> 03:50:42.060]  Much more press to come
[03:50:42.060 --> 03:50:44.060]  The government's anti-extremism unit
[03:50:44.060 --> 03:50:46.060]  Should focus on terrorism
[03:50:46.060 --> 03:50:48.060]  Not harassing homosexuals
[03:50:48.060 --> 03:50:50.060]  He calls it chilling
[03:50:50.060 --> 03:50:52.060]  It's caused national astonishment
[03:50:52.060 --> 03:50:54.060]  And it is absolutely disgusting
[03:50:54.060 --> 03:50:56.060]  We'll be back with a final segment
[03:50:56.060 --> 03:51:16.060]  On the Alex Jones show, don't go away

[03:54:18.060 --> 03:54:20.060]  I just wanted to mention

[03:55:00.060 --> 03:55:02.060]  And George Soros funded attack dogs
[03:55:02.060 --> 03:55:04.060]  Who are trying to shut down free speech on an open web
[03:55:04.060 --> 03:55:06.060]  That's going on right now on Twitter
[03:55:06.060 --> 03:55:08.060]  Eventually they're going to cut off

[03:55:40.060 --> 03:55:42.060]  Final news stories here, of course in France
[03:55:42.060 --> 03:55:44.060]  We've got a presidential election
[03:55:44.060 --> 03:55:46.060]  Coming up next year
[03:55:46.060 --> 03:55:48.060]  Fion
[03:55:48.060 --> 03:55:50.060]  I guess that's how you pronounce it
[03:55:50.060 --> 03:55:52.060]  Fion lead in right wing primaries
[03:55:52.060 --> 03:55:54.060]  Throws far right Le Pen off balance
[03:55:54.060 --> 03:55:56.060]  They're already announcing the end for Marine Le Pen
[03:55:56.060 --> 03:55:58.060]  And we know how well that worked out with Trump
[03:55:58.060 --> 03:56:00.060]  Francois Fion's
[03:56:00.060 --> 03:56:02.060]  Shock lead in Sunday's primary to choose a
[03:56:02.060 --> 03:56:04.060]  Conservative candidate in the next year's
[03:56:04.060 --> 03:56:06.060]  Presidential election has thrown the far right
[03:56:06.060 --> 03:56:08.060]  National front completely off balance
[03:56:08.060 --> 03:56:10.060]  It's over for Marine Le Pen
[03:56:10.060 --> 03:56:12.060]  The mainstream media fake news has said so
[03:56:12.060 --> 03:56:14.060]  They're wrong on everything else
[03:56:14.060 --> 03:56:16.060]  So basically the guy who looks
[03:56:16.060 --> 03:56:18.060]  Set to win the Conservative candidacy
[03:56:18.060 --> 03:56:20.060]  Is somebody
[03:56:20.060 --> 03:56:22.060]  Who is an actual Conservative
[03:56:22.060 --> 03:56:24.060]  They're saying they don't have much dirt on him
[03:56:24.060 --> 03:56:26.060]  He's for controlling
[03:56:26.060 --> 03:56:28.060]  The threat posed by Islam which of course
[03:56:28.060 --> 03:56:30.060]  Is massive in France because they've cowed out
[03:56:30.060 --> 03:56:32.060]  To it for over a decade
[03:56:32.060 --> 03:56:34.060]  He's more Conservative than
[03:56:34.060 --> 03:56:36.060]  The other challenger Alan Juppey
[03:56:36.060 --> 03:56:38.060]  Whose message is a happy
[03:56:38.060 --> 03:56:40.060]  Reconciliation of multi-cultural
[03:56:40.060 --> 03:56:42.060]  Friends because that's proven
[03:56:42.060 --> 03:56:44.060]  Really successful hasn't it
[03:56:44.060 --> 03:56:46.060]  Over the past couple of years
[03:56:46.060 --> 03:56:48.060]  So basically they're saying that because
[03:56:48.060 --> 03:56:50.060]  This guy is quite Conservative that he
[03:56:50.060 --> 03:56:52.060]  Will easily defeat Marine Le Pen
[03:56:52.060 --> 03:56:54.060]  Which we saw
[03:56:54.060 --> 03:56:56.060]  In the Republican
[03:56:56.060 --> 03:56:58.060]  Primaries with you know people like Chris Christie
[03:56:58.060 --> 03:57:00.060]  They had very harsh
[03:57:00.060 --> 03:57:02.060]  Conservative rhetoric turned out
[03:57:02.060 --> 03:57:04.060]  To be completely worthless
[03:57:04.060 --> 03:57:06.060]  But of course you have to remember
[03:57:06.060 --> 03:57:08.060]  According to leftist logic
[03:57:08.060 --> 03:57:10.060]  In the US election
[03:57:10.060 --> 03:57:12.060]  Not supporting Hillary meant that you hated
[03:57:12.060 --> 03:57:14.060]  Women okay
[03:57:14.060 --> 03:57:16.060]  She had a vagina
[03:57:16.060 --> 03:57:18.060]  She was going to be the first female president
[03:57:18.060 --> 03:57:20.060]  Anyone who opposed that hated women
[03:57:20.060 --> 03:57:22.060]  So
[03:57:22.060 --> 03:57:24.060]  By that score, by that logic
[03:57:24.060 --> 03:57:26.060]  Everyone who doesn't support Marine Le Pen
[03:57:26.060 --> 03:57:28.060]  Because she would be
[03:57:28.060 --> 03:57:30.060]  The first female president of France
[03:57:30.060 --> 03:57:32.060]  Everyone who doesn't support that
[03:57:32.060 --> 03:57:34.060]  Hates women and this is a key
[03:57:34.060 --> 03:57:36.060]  Message that we need to get out to liberals
[03:57:36.060 --> 03:57:38.060]  As we draw closer to this presidential election
[03:57:38.060 --> 03:57:40.060]  France has never had
[03:57:40.060 --> 03:57:42.060]  A female president
[03:57:42.060 --> 03:57:44.060]  It's bigoted and sexist to not
[03:57:44.060 --> 03:57:46.060]  Support Marine Le Pen
[03:57:46.060 --> 03:57:48.060]  Because she has a vagina
[03:57:48.060 --> 03:57:50.060]  Okay, hashtag I'm with her
[03:57:50.060 --> 03:57:52.060]  Let's get that message out there
[03:57:52.060 --> 03:57:54.060]  There's a new study
[03:57:54.060 --> 03:57:56.060]  Out of Science Direct
[03:57:56.060 --> 03:57:58.060]  Which shows that liberals are more
[03:57:58.060 --> 03:58:00.060]  Prone to criminal behaviour
[03:58:00.060 --> 03:58:02.060]  Well what a surprise
[03:58:02.060 --> 03:58:04.060]  Political ideology represents an imperfect yet
[03:58:04.060 --> 03:58:06.060]  An indicator of a host of personality traits
[03:58:06.060 --> 03:58:08.060]  And cognitive preferences
[03:58:08.060 --> 03:58:10.060]  One of which includes
[03:58:10.060 --> 03:58:12.060]  Criminal behaviour, we've had the study before
[03:58:12.060 --> 03:58:14.060]  Where poorer conservatives
[03:58:14.060 --> 03:58:16.060]  Are more generous than wealthy liberals
[03:58:16.060 --> 03:58:18.060]  Now a new scientific study
[03:58:18.060 --> 03:58:20.060]  Finds
[03:58:20.060 --> 03:58:22.060]  That liberals are more prone to criminal behaviour
[03:58:22.060 --> 03:58:24.060]  Which is not a surprise
[03:58:24.060 --> 03:58:26.060]  Given that they always want
[03:58:26.060 --> 03:58:28.060]  To take things away without
[03:58:28.060 --> 03:58:30.060]  Having earned them
[03:58:30.060 --> 03:58:32.060]  That's going to wrap it up for the show
[03:58:32.060 --> 03:58:34.060]  Tonight Alex will be back 11 to 2 tomorrow
[03:58:34.060 --> 03:58:36.060]  Thanks for joining us
