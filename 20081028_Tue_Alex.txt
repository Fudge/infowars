[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.120 --> 00:20.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.960 --> 00:35.240]  Alex Jones is taking the day off folks. I'm back. I haven't been back since really the end of the
[00:35.240 --> 00:39.800]  summer. I'm Jason Burma so I'm gonna be sitting in all four hours today but it's jam-packed.
[00:39.800 --> 00:46.160]  We're gonna be playing a lot of the Willie Nelson, Alex Jones, Jesse Ventura conversations that we
[00:46.160 --> 00:53.000]  threw up on Infowars.com in the wee hours of the morning last night I guess I don't know 3am is
[00:53.000 --> 00:59.400]  kind of a vague area I guess they started going up at around 11 to 1 but last one got up there at
[00:59.400 --> 01:03.240]  3 but we're even gonna have some more for you we're also gonna have Willie on the bus exclusively
[01:03.240 --> 01:10.680]  in the second or third hour. We also have Webster Tarpleon to talk about the elections and of course
[01:10.680 --> 01:18.560]  other things and Ray McGovern will be on later as well the 26 year CIA veteran the intelligence
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.880]  analyst that would literally do the briefings for Dick Cheney and company during the Reagan
[01:23.880 --> 01:31.120]  administration so big show today right off the bat there's a couple things I want to talk about
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.720]  we're gonna do a news blitz later we're gonna talk about we are change talking to Sarah Palin
[01:35.720 --> 01:42.400]  about 9-11 and a new investigation I got to tell you she gave a pretty generic milk toast positive
[01:42.400 --> 01:47.720]  answer very quickly and I think that's because a she wasn't on camera and you know she's on a
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.280]  campaign trail she's not there to ruffle any feathers right now she's sitting there and
[01:52.280 --> 02:02.160]  shaking hands with the audience and I'm sitting here staring at the news week with her with
[02:02.160 --> 02:06.600]  a rifle over her arm I mean let me just ah it's in the beginning segment I don't want to go off
[02:06.600 --> 02:13.920]  on Sarah Palin too much but what a joke I haven't I haven't really been able to uh vent I guess
[02:13.920 --> 02:19.640]  about the election too much what a joke that this woman was even chosen as a vice presidential
[02:19.640 --> 02:23.960]  candidate literally a heartbeat away from somebody who's not in the best health I'm sorry but if
[02:23.960 --> 02:29.760]  you haven't seen McCain on the campaign trail the last 18 months two years he looks like death
[02:29.760 --> 02:35.880]  itself I mean the man is a walking corpse there's I don't think he can survive four years in
[02:35.880 --> 02:40.760]  office quite frankly you know not that it really matters both of them are really severe puppets
[02:40.760 --> 02:45.920]  of the establishment and Sarah Palin I mean she's got three kids you know much time that
[02:45.920 --> 02:51.040]  takes alone and she's the governor yes I guess she's a little career driven but you know she's
[02:51.040 --> 02:54.920]  corrupt just like the rest of them she's a human being and she'll just go along to get along I
[02:54.920 --> 03:00.640]  mean she's already in this quote-unquote conservative party that's anything but conservative and when
[03:00.640 --> 03:08.200]  anyway she she says she's in favor of a new investigation but I you know she says it's
[03:08.200 --> 03:12.920]  to keep in the minds of people play that clip later of course we're gonna talk about the quote
[03:12.920 --> 03:19.160]  unquote failed assassination attempt on Barack Obama that's pretty breaking I'm pretty curious to
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.560]  see you know these guys apparently are white supremacists we're gonna play a mainstream
[03:23.560 --> 03:30.280]  clip from CBS that we're gonna try to shoot him with a scope rifle at 750 yards I'm not sure
[03:30.280 --> 03:33.480]  but I saw some people in the media reporting something about the decapitation I didn't see
[03:33.480 --> 03:40.240]  anything about that in this one I'm wondering you know obviously there's races in the world folks
[03:40.240 --> 03:47.080]  I'm not I'm not advocating that obviously there are people that would have a vested interest in
[03:47.080 --> 03:52.120]  just killing this man out of hate not because of what he stands for anything like that but just
[03:52.120 --> 03:55.600]  because of the color of his skin and that's unfortunate but I want to see if these guys
[03:55.600 --> 04:01.240]  are in an organization what kind of ties they have because you know that these guys get caught
[04:01.240 --> 04:08.520]  all the time being coddled and prodded by feds it's it's the way it is they infiltrate very
[04:08.520 --> 04:13.920]  quickly and they put these ideas in their heads and then lo and behold it comes out it was a fed
[04:13.920 --> 04:20.000]  off and this and that and to strike fear into people or actually to carry it out so let's see
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.480]  where that goes I want to get Tarpley's opinion on that obviously he's weighed in heavily in the
[04:24.480 --> 04:30.480]  election in the last year and we're gonna talk about Lou Dobbs doing like a nine minute report
[04:30.480 --> 04:36.200]  basically saying what we've been saying for years what Alex has been saying for well over a decade
[04:36.200 --> 04:42.560]  now that martial law is a very big concern here in the United States this is the Alex Jones show
[04:42.560 --> 04:50.560]  prisonplanet.tv prisonplanet.com and we're gonna come back with a little Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura and Alex Jones.
[05:07.560 --> 05:10.560]  Do you like being a puppet sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[05:10.560 --> 05:15.360]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was the stage? Was it engineered by you, David
[05:15.360 --> 05:17.560]  Rockefeller, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR?
[05:26.560 --> 05:31.560]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[05:32.560 --> 05:36.560]  An inside job? How dare you?
[05:36.560 --> 05:42.560]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[05:42.560 --> 05:45.560]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[05:51.560 --> 05:57.560]  Please rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com
[05:57.560 --> 06:00.560]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[06:00.560 --> 06:05.560]  I had the opportunity to speak to my 90 year old grandmother at some length here recently
[06:05.560 --> 06:10.560]  and she was talking about the Great Depression and we were talking about the gas prices, the food prices,
[06:10.560 --> 06:14.560]  this economic uncertainty we're in these you know really kind of perilous times no one knows where we're headed
[06:14.560 --> 06:18.560]  or where we might end up and she was reminded of the Great Depression and how in those days
[06:18.560 --> 06:22.560]  folks who lived in the country did okay because they had chicken and eggs and they could grow gardens
[06:22.560 --> 06:26.560]  and can their food but how difficult it was for people who lived in urban areas or in the cities
[06:26.560 --> 06:30.560]  because they didn't have the landscape for gardening or the know-how and they didn't have the chickens
[06:30.560 --> 06:32.560]  and the livestock so it's a lot different for them.
[06:32.560 --> 06:36.560]  Well we know one thing's certain right now we're headed into much higher prices on food
[06:36.560 --> 06:38.560]  and there is a global food shortage.
[06:38.560 --> 06:40.560]  Now what can you do to prepare? Do what I did.
[06:40.560 --> 06:42.560]  Sell some toys off in the garage.
[06:42.560 --> 06:44.560]  Go to the J. Michael Stevens efoodsdirect.com company.
[06:44.560 --> 06:46.560]  Get some food and put it away and be safe.
[06:46.560 --> 06:48.560]  Put a little security in your life.
[06:48.560 --> 06:49.560]  You deserve security.
[06:49.560 --> 06:55.560]  Go to efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com, 1-800-409-5633.

[08:01.560 --> 08:07.560]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues.
[08:07.560 --> 08:11.560]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[08:15.560 --> 08:23.560]  Alright folks we are back and I'm just going to jump right in to a little bit of a conversation with Willie,
[08:23.560 --> 08:30.560]  Alex Jones and Jesse Hunter. Jesse really recounts when he went down to the governor
[08:30.560 --> 08:36.560]  and all of a sudden he was asked to go downstairs and a bunch of people told him that they were from the CIA
[08:36.560 --> 08:41.560]  and they wanted to talk to him and he said well you know what let's let Jesse tell the story
[08:41.560 --> 09:00.560]  because obviously he can tell it a lot better than I can.
[09:00.560 --> 09:06.560]  So I'd be like a typical former service guy felt that I guess it's my obligation to go down
[09:06.560 --> 09:13.560]  and talk to these guys so I went down and being who I am I got down there and you know the bottles of the capital
[09:13.560 --> 09:21.560]  right in the capital I mean it was in the basement I'll never forget it they were seated all in a big half circle
[09:21.560 --> 09:31.560]  and I got the chair in the center and that's where I was put with this half circle group of 23 members of the CIA
[09:31.560 --> 09:44.560]  and I think the first thing that really made me got my awareness up was as I looked at them all they were all your neighbors.
[09:44.560 --> 09:50.560]  I mean you weren't looking at James Bond here you know you went down there with the feeling you were going to walk in
[09:50.560 --> 09:58.560]  and see all these former Navy SEALs and former Delta Force guys who are now out and they're now working in the intelligence community
[09:58.560 --> 10:05.560]  and all this it was Grandma Jones down the street it was so-and-so I mean they were of all ages.
[10:05.560 --> 10:06.560]  You knew them?
[10:06.560 --> 10:09.560]  No none of them.
[10:09.560 --> 10:12.560]  Yeah they looked that's the point I didn't do really.
[10:12.560 --> 10:22.560]  It's the fact that when I looked at them I saw my neighbors not actually what I meant by that Willie was I saw
[10:22.560 --> 10:30.560]  my people just like my people you'd never suspect because these are people in the Central Intelligence Agency
[10:30.560 --> 10:41.560]  they were of all ages all colors all looked like almost say a different categories of wealth.
[10:41.560 --> 10:43.560]  What kind of training do you think they had?
[10:43.560 --> 10:45.560]  I don't know this was part of it though.
[10:45.560 --> 10:53.560]  I'm sure they get trained and actually I found out this was actually many of them part of their training.
[10:53.560 --> 11:01.560]  This was a training exercise that was likewise going on as well as fact giving and so I sat down and I looked at them all
[11:01.560 --> 11:06.560]  because I wrote about it in my last book and so I don't mind talking at all about it.
[11:06.560 --> 11:12.560]  I remember I looked at them all and the first thing I said I said well I said before you asked me any questions
[11:12.560 --> 11:21.560]  I got a few for you that I'd like to answer and I said quit pro quo you know if you ask me questions I get to ask you questions
[11:21.560 --> 11:25.560]  and I said my first question is what are you doing here?
[11:25.560 --> 11:32.560]  And the head guy they were very formal they were always governor sir very much that way very respectful
[11:32.560 --> 11:38.560]  but I remember the head guy looked at me and he said what do you mean governor and I said well what I mean is that your
[11:38.560 --> 11:43.560]  mission statement says you're not to be operational inside the United States.
[11:43.560 --> 11:45.560]  What are you here for?
[11:45.560 --> 11:48.560]  This is clearly inside the United States.
[11:48.560 --> 11:53.560]  Well I got hammered and hawed and didn't really get an answer you know double talked and all that.
[11:53.560 --> 12:02.560]  Then I said my second question I said I want to go around the room and I said I want you to tell me your name and what you do.
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.560]  Half of them wouldn't tell me their names half of them wouldn't tell me what they did who knows if they're really telling me their
[12:08.560 --> 12:15.560]  correct name no way of knowing and so I said well look if you're not going to cooperate fully with my questioning
[12:15.560 --> 12:21.560]  I said I'm probably going to find it difficult to fully cooperate with yours it's got to be equal here.
[12:21.560 --> 12:31.560]  So I ended up and the amazing thing like I said to Alex or made mention to him was that all of their questions dealt about how I won the election.
[12:31.560 --> 12:41.560]  They wanted to know what we did how we did it did we think da da da da and so when I got done that day I drove home and all the way
[12:41.560 --> 12:50.560]  home I kept thinking it was on my mind and I kept thinking who would I call who do I know that can answer these questions for me or help me
[12:50.560 --> 12:53.560]  and then the name popped up Dick Marcenco.
[12:53.560 --> 12:55.560]  Do you know what Dick Marcenco is?
[12:55.560 --> 13:06.560]  Dick Marcenco is the author of the Role Warrior books. He's a 32 year member of SEAL Team and Dick created SEAL Team 6 which is the anti-terrorist unit.
[13:06.560 --> 13:13.560]  These are the guys that have hair like you Willie and Beards and you'd never suspect they're in the United States Navy.
[13:13.560 --> 13:23.560]  They're deep under cover you know and Dick created them he created Red Cell and Dick retired after 32 years he's a good friend of mine.
[13:23.560 --> 13:32.560]  So I got home and I rang Dick up and I told him what happened that day and I said Dick I said you got any idea why the CIA 23 members
[13:32.560 --> 13:39.560]  want to interview me and Dick starts laughing on the other end and I said what's so fun?
[13:39.560 --> 13:47.560]  He said well he said I don't he said I've been out of it a few years like he said I can't directly tell you why he said I don't know directly why
[13:47.560 --> 13:53.560]  he said I have an idea and I said well Dick your idea is going to be better than mine.
[13:53.560 --> 13:59.560]  I said I had six years in the Navy you had 32 I said you got a lot more expertise I said what's your idea?
[13:59.560 --> 14:05.560]  He said well he said here's what I believe he said they didn't see you coming.
[14:05.560 --> 14:14.560]  He said it made sense he said they their job is to gather intelligence so that they could report that to the government
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.560]  can then make decisions based on the gathering of that intelligence.
[14:19.560 --> 14:22.560]  He said clearly they didn't see you coming.
[14:22.560 --> 14:29.560]  And they wanted to know how you did it and Dick goes they also wanted to know are there more of you on the horizon?
[14:29.560 --> 14:31.560]  Is this a trend we're missing?
[14:31.560 --> 14:39.560]  Are we missing something here that could be happening within the United States like the next election?
[14:39.560 --> 14:47.560]  Are we going to see four more independent governors win or is Minnesota kind of an isolated incidence here?
[14:47.560 --> 14:54.560]  And when Dick got through saying that to me I thought he's right on that's exactly what it was.
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.560]  Well there you go even more evidence that this shadow government this continuity of government special interests
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.560]  corporations have really taken over and now you know I want to play this Dove's clip I don't want to just play clips here
[15:05.560 --> 15:11.560]  but it's really important for people to understand how all this stuff has been integrated and I'm going to go over this with Tarpley
[15:11.560 --> 15:14.560]  and really on a mass level on 9-11 as well.
[15:14.560 --> 15:21.560]  I mean this is really where they tested out whether or not they could get out with a massive military operation inside the United States
[15:21.560 --> 15:30.560]  a false flag up here using military drills using continuity of government as a cover and that's what's brought us here today
[15:30.560 --> 15:38.560]  even plus years later with Lou Dobbs finally coming around finally coming around and saying I mean this is a big report right here
[15:38.560 --> 15:45.560]  this is on CNN alright he's literally talking about finally posy commentatus.
[15:45.560 --> 15:52.560]  I want to let people know we're streaming over at prismplanet.tv so when we play clips like this you're probably going to be able to see the video.
[15:52.560 --> 16:00.560]  We got a little bit of a setup fix here there's no more humming on the laptop so we can stream everything right from here it's a little easier on John Harmon
[16:00.560 --> 16:10.560]  up at GCN headquarters in Minnesota and I also want to get Tarpley's take on you know how far continuity of government has really come
[16:10.560 --> 16:18.560]  now with this bailout because we're talking about a massive now economic takeover I mean they've done it before like I said you know
[16:18.560 --> 16:26.560]  Ventura mentioned to us this all happened to get you know in the 80s when they took over the farming industry and I believe that was also discussed on the bus
[16:26.560 --> 16:32.560]  we may have that in the second or third hour we're going to have a little bit of Willie Nelson on the bus.
[16:32.560 --> 16:38.560]  130 that's when that's coming on so that should be pretty exciting for everybody
[16:38.560 --> 16:45.560]  and prismplanet.tv members of course are going to get that in the highest quality possible when the video is up.
[16:45.560 --> 16:53.560]  Now I'm going to start playing some of this Dobbs because I think it needs to be played we'll get into the Barack Obama assassination later
[16:53.560 --> 17:03.560]  but here we go here's the Dobbs martial law clip this is Moneyline with Lou Dobbs Lisa Sylvester is the reporter.
[17:03.560 --> 17:16.560]  This is one of the reasons tonight about an army combat brigade being trained to deal with civil disturbances in the United States.
[17:16.560 --> 17:25.560]  The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 generally prohibits federal uniform services from carrying out domestic law enforcement duties except in cases expressly
[17:25.560 --> 17:33.560]  principles of our country separation of military and civilian government. Luis Giovanni has our report.
[17:33.560 --> 17:41.560]  They've spent 30 months on the streets of Baghdad now the first brigade combat team of the army's third infantry division is back in the USA.
[17:41.560 --> 17:50.560]  The Army Times reporting quote they may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios end quote.
[17:50.560 --> 18:00.560]  The question arises why and isn't that what the National Guard does infantry brigade is designed to engage an enemy with maximum effective force and destroy it.
[18:00.560 --> 18:09.560]  That's not the sort of thing anybody wants to see in in the streets of the United States almost 5000 strong the brigade is based at Fort Steward Georgia under quote
[18:09.560 --> 18:16.560]  the primary purpose of this force is to provide help to people in need in the aftermath of a WMD like event in the homeland.
[18:16.560 --> 18:25.560]  So that were they called to support civil authority those governors or local state jurisdictions that might need our help that they would be responsive and capable in the
[18:25.560 --> 18:37.560]  aftermath of an event like this end quote on Capitol Hill questions about how the Pentagon determined that thinly stretched military with two conflicts underway could spare these troops.
[18:37.560 --> 18:44.560]  That's a misuse of assets as assets can be deployed I think more efficiently somewhere else when you have the guard that you can call upon a moment's notice.
[18:44.560 --> 18:57.560]  Historically the posting is unusual in modern history army troops have been used at extraordinary junctures under the first president Bush to contain the 1992 riots in Los Angeles under President Lyndon Johnson in response to
[18:57.560 --> 19:06.560]  Detroit's 1967 riots and in the grips of a depression by President Herbert Hoover to contain army veterans demanding their bonuses.
[19:06.560 --> 19:13.560]  All actions says historian Robert Dallock undertaken by unpopular presidents on edge about.
[19:13.560 --> 19:25.560]  The capacity to lead to vote public support for whatever it is they think needs to be done.
[19:25.560 --> 19:33.560]  Lisa the Army Times journalist tells us that the story has generated intense public interest and four weeks into.
[19:33.560 --> 19:45.560]  Intense public interest are you kidding me did you just hear that folks when was it there well during the depression during the riots and under Bush one and 90s under those riots.

[21:07.560 --> 21:09.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11.
[21:09.560 --> 21:12.560]  Who is the enemy in London.
[21:12.560 --> 21:13.560]  This is his M. O.
[21:13.560 --> 21:14.560]  We have to look to the Middle East.

[22:18.560 --> 22:22.560]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.

[24:14.560 --> 24:19.560]  Hello folks, we are back. I'm Jason Burma, serving in for Alex Jones today.
[24:19.560 --> 24:22.560]  We're going to have tarply on in about 30 minutes.
[24:22.560 --> 24:28.560]  And at 1.30 we're going to play Willie Nelson on the bus, discussing a host of issues,
[24:28.560 --> 24:33.560]  you know, from the rave of the farmers in the 80s and where it's really gotten to today.
[24:33.560 --> 24:39.560]  You know, the problems in the country today, 9-11 Truth, the whole shebang.
[24:39.560 --> 24:44.560]  And speaking of 9-11 Truth, I guess I should play this, this Palin clip or a little portion of it.
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.560]  And hopefully people will be able to hear it. It's in a very crowded, you know, she's campaigning.
[24:50.560 --> 25:15.560]  I mean, come on, let's be real here. So hopefully you guys will be able to hear it. Here we go.
[25:15.560 --> 25:44.560]  And there's a story over at PrismPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[25:44.560 --> 25:50.560]  But, you know, again, she's on the campaign trail. She doesn't know she's being taped.
[25:50.560 --> 25:57.560]  You know, I doubt she has any idea what any of these host of issues there are on 9-11.
[25:57.560 --> 26:04.560]  So, you know, again, I don't know, how is this woman qualified to run the country when John McCain dies?
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.560]  I mean, let's be honest, he's an older gentleman. He's not the pillar of health.
[26:08.560 --> 26:11.560]  We're not electing Jack LaLaine or we're not electing anybody.
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.560]  They're really selecting whoever they want with their dye-bold machines and their corruption, which makes me sick.
[26:17.560 --> 26:23.560]  Oh, so with this first-hour news blitz, I guess I should get into these.
[26:23.560 --> 26:27.560]  I guess they're calling them skinheads, but I saw a couple of the mugshots and they both had hair.
[26:27.560 --> 26:31.560]  Apparently one of them has a neo-Nazi tattoo. I'm not saying they're not neo-Nazis.
[26:31.560 --> 26:35.560]  There's plenty of races out there, folks. There's plenty of ignorant people.
[26:35.560 --> 26:42.560]  So let's see what CBS has to say. And like I said, I want to see if these guys perhaps were provocative,
[26:42.560 --> 26:51.560]  if they are part of some ridiculous Ku Klux Klan or neo-Nazi organization that has been infiltrated by the FBI,
[26:51.560 --> 26:57.560]  because the FBI loves that stuff. It's called order out of chaos, divide and conquer.
[26:57.560 --> 27:03.560]  They like to stir up conflicts with race, conflicts with religion.
[27:03.560 --> 27:11.560]  It keeps the masses knitting about little things, and at the same time, it becomes very real because people buy into it.
[27:11.560 --> 27:18.560]  And then it creates this conflict where they're able to put in their own rules and regulations, put them in their privatized prisons,
[27:18.560 --> 27:30.560]  and the private corporations will use them to be a telemarketer for $0.39 an hour and ask you if you want to change phones or perhaps get this new insurance plan.
[27:30.560 --> 27:37.560]  Isn't that lovely? I love how America works, don't you? Well, I'd like to change all that.
[27:37.560 --> 27:42.560]  But we begin with an alleged plot to assassinate Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.
[27:42.560 --> 27:49.560]  Tonight, four people are under arrest. CBS4 investigator Brian Moss has learned exclusive details just within the past few hours.
[27:49.560 --> 27:55.560]  Brian, one man told the FBI there was actually a plan to shoot Obama Thursday night at Invesco.
[27:55.560 --> 28:02.560]  That's indeed part of what we found out, Jim, unsettling information, and clearly federal authorities are taking this very seriously.
[28:02.560 --> 28:08.560]  Tonight, we've learned details about this apparent plot that has law enforcement now trying to connect the dots.
[28:08.560 --> 28:15.560]  Early Sunday morning, police in Aurora pulled over 28-year-old Theron Gartrell on a routine traffic stop.
[28:15.560 --> 28:24.560]  The driver of a vehicle was driving erratically. The maneuver appeared to be going from one lane erratically into another lane.
[28:24.560 --> 28:31.560]  It turned out to be anything but routine. In his rented pickup truck, police found two high-powered scoped rifles,
[28:31.560 --> 28:40.560]  a bulletproof vest, two wigs, a spotting scope, two walkie-talkies, a wireless phone, three IDs in other people's names,
[28:40.560 --> 28:46.560]  part of a pistol, camouflaged clothing, and 4.4 grams of methamphetamine.
[28:46.560 --> 28:51.560]  One of the rifles is listed as stolen out of Kansas, according to the ATF.
[28:51.560 --> 29:00.560]  Members of the agency are clearly on a heightened alert based upon the security that's involved with a convention,
[29:00.560 --> 29:09.560]  the size of the one that's occurring in Denver. And so behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious.
[29:09.560 --> 29:17.560]  According to an FBI bulletin shared with CBS4, Gartrell told authorities the weapons belonged to a friend, Nathan Johnson.
[29:17.560 --> 29:21.560]  Police arrested Johnson and his girlfriend at a Denver hotel on drug charges.
[29:21.560 --> 29:29.560]  At the same time, the Secret Service hit this hotel in nearby Glendale early Sunday morning to talk to Sean Robert Adoff,
[29:29.560 --> 29:35.560]  an associate of Gartrell's and Johnson's. But Adoff jumped out a six-floor window to escape police.
[29:35.560 --> 29:40.560]  He suffered only a broken ankle. When he was arrested, the FBI says he had it.
[29:40.560 --> 29:50.560]  All right, folks, we'll be back with the rest of the Barack Obama assassination type attempt, tarply coming up and willing else on the bus. Infowars.com.
[29:50.560 --> 30:00.560]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:09.560 --> 33:16.560]  Alright folks, we are back. This is the Alex Jones Show. I am Jason Bermas. Improving once again I am anything but perfect on a human being.
[33:16.560 --> 33:27.560]  I just played a clip from the assassination attempt over at the DNC. But this is a whole new plot. And it's over at the Drugs Report. There's a couple articles about it. Let me read it off here.
[33:27.560 --> 33:53.560]  Skinheads in Obama assassination plot. And it's wacky because they show a picture of a dumb and dumber. Two white supremacists who plotted a killing spree targeting African Americans that was to culminate with the murder of Senator Barack Obama have been arrested on a variety of federal charges.
[33:53.560 --> 34:07.560]  According to the court affidavits, sworn by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives Agent Daniel Cowart, 20, and Paul Schleschman, 18, began discussing the murder plot after meeting online about a month ago.
[34:07.560 --> 34:23.560]  Okay, so these guys meant some kind of racist forum perhaps. In the ATF affidavit, a copy of which you'll find below, Cowart and Scheslman discussed the killing spree to include targeting a predominantly African American school going state to state while robbing individuals and continuing to kill people.
[34:23.560 --> 34:30.560]  Alright, yeah, that's realistic. Come on. As soon as you start killing spree in one town, you're probably going to get killed.
[34:30.560 --> 34:46.560]  The pair's final act of violence would be an attempt to kill Obama, the Democratic presidential nominee. In separate interviews with investigators, the men said they planned to spread their vehicle towards Obama while shooting at him from the windows, apparently befitting the historic assault.
[34:46.560 --> 35:06.560]  Cowart and Scheslman stated they would dress in all-white tuxedos and wear top hats during the assassination attempt. Geez. Cowart and Scheslman were arrested last Wednesday night by Tennessee Sheriff deputies soon after the pair used chalk to write numerous racially-motivated words and symbols, including a swastika, on the exterior of Cowart's automobile.
[35:06.560 --> 35:19.560]  Cowart left and Scheslman are pictured in these mug shots snapped by the Crockett County Sheriff's Department. As a result of this bizarre plot, the wannabe assassins were named in a three-count federal felony complaint, a copy of which you'll find here.
[35:19.560 --> 35:41.560]  And then the affidavits pretty quick. Brian A. Weeks, employed by the Special Agents. Pod-conducting separate interviews. White power and skinhead views. Killing 88 people and beheading 14 African Americans. That's right, they were going to behead people as well.
[35:41.560 --> 35:54.560]  This is just off the charts weird, huh? I mean, when you see a picture of these guys, it doesn't look like they could be capable of any of this. I mean, who knows, maybe these are just meted up kids.
[35:54.560 --> 36:02.560]  You know, something like a mind control thing. I don't know. I don't want to venture off, but it's very bizarre. They're very young.
[36:02.560 --> 36:16.560]  I, you know, these guys are just, I can see that there is a swastika tattoo on the one guy holding a scoped rifle. But think about that. They're going to kill 88 people, behead 14, and then kill the president in tuxedos and top hats.
[36:16.560 --> 36:23.560]  I mean, do these guys have the tuxedos? Obviously, they had the weaponry and they're delusional and they met on the internet and they're a threat.
[36:23.560 --> 36:33.560]  But, you know, where is it? I want to get Tarpley's take on it. We'll go over it in about 25 minutes when we have him on.
[36:33.560 --> 36:41.560]  You know, I've been on it for about 35 minutes. I really haven't promoted anything that we do here over at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[36:41.560 --> 36:53.560]  And I am a filmmaker. I just put out a film called Fabled Enemies about two months ago now. And you can get it over at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Watch it in high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[36:53.560 --> 37:10.560]  But, you know, being with Jesse Winter and Alex Jones and of course, Willie Nelson all day two days ago, you know, we talked a lot about, you know, what was going on and how it was handled.
[37:10.560 --> 37:29.560]  And Alex, you know, really had to talk to Jesse about what the New World Order was. And he, you know, you know, Jesse being Jesse did the old Philadelphia explain it to me like I'm a six-year-old, Alex.
[37:29.560 --> 37:38.560]  So, Alex, of course, brings up Quigley. Now, for those of you out there that don't know Quigley and why this is important in this whole system, I mean, we're days away from an election.
[37:38.560 --> 37:48.560]  Of course, we're going to talk about that later with Tarpley as well. But it doesn't matter. They've put in four establishment candidates. And by, why do I say four? Two people around for President Jason.
[37:48.560 --> 38:04.560]  Well, the other guys are really there. I mean, again, McCain's a walking corpse. And if somebody who is not quite as delusional and fairytale-land and much more psychopathic and sociopathic and racist truly did want to try something on Obama for nothing but the color of his skin.
[38:04.560 --> 38:13.560]  Who knows? You know, I mean, game over. I mean, chances are it would be the globalist if it was allowed to happen, if it wasn't foiled. But you never know.
[38:13.560 --> 38:24.560]  So, those two candidates, McCain and Obama, I mean, you've really got to look closely at who they chose for Vice President. And I went over Sarah Palin in the segment before.
[38:24.560 --> 38:36.560]  And you know, if you guys want to call in, maybe we'll take callers next segment. We can talk about anything you want, especially the election and what you think about these candidates. But Sarah Palin is going to go any establishment route they want.
[38:36.560 --> 38:44.560]  And Lord knows. I mean, Lord knows who the VP there will be. And then there's Joey B or Joey Biden.
[38:44.560 --> 38:59.560]  And Joey Biden's in my latest film, Fabled Enemies, you know, cracking jokes and laughing about, you know, funding in 9-11. The student scholars for 9-11 Truth got him on record saying there would be a lot coming out about 9-11 across the board as this administration left, which I think will be the case.
[38:59.560 --> 39:07.560]  However, he's a Council on Foreign Relations gentleman for new listeners. The Council on Foreign Relations is like this.
[39:07.560 --> 39:20.560]  I don't know. I guess they call it the upper class, but really not the super upper class. I mean, this isn't, this is mid-level minions, but they're little think tanks where they began to set policy with one another and hobnob and this and that.
[39:20.560 --> 39:32.560]  And he's been with them for years. He's well aware of the quote, unquote, New World Order. And these are the people that control the race. I mean, they control your thoughts.
[39:32.560 --> 39:41.560]  I hate to say it. I don't want to sound so cynical and off the wall, but yeah, I mean, they project everything you see, hear, consume. I mean, it's crazy.
[39:41.560 --> 39:54.560]  They own the media. I mean, think about it. You turn the television on no matter what mainline station they're talking about the election somehow, some way. And these four people who are campaigning.
[39:54.560 --> 40:04.560]  So going back to, you know, Alex explaining the New World Order to Jesse and this will hopefully be posted the next few days. Remember, there's a lot posted right now over info wars.
[40:04.560 --> 40:23.560]  He said, well, you know, for instance, Carol Quigley, who was a Georgetown professor, you know, inner circle of the elite was given access to a lot of these round table members or basically the ruling, the Anglo ruling class that had consolidated a lot of power
[40:23.560 --> 40:40.560]  around the mid 1800s, early 1900s. Okay. And this book is called tragedy and hope. And he talks about how they recruit people and massage them into it through road scholarships and the math, you know, cars and women, the whole nine.
[40:40.560 --> 40:54.560]  I mean, he basically shows you how they, how they recruit people and he also talks more, more about their policies and how most of them, you know, he's in favor of and he may not be in favor of their methods all the time.
[40:54.560 --> 41:04.560]  But overall, their goals are goals that he would like to see. Now he makes the point that Bill Clinton, of course, was a Quigley protege.
[41:04.560 --> 41:13.560]  And for those that don't know, on two separate occasions, Bill Clinton, you know, gave big ups to his mentor, Carol Quigley.
[41:13.560 --> 41:22.560]  So tragedy and hope is the book. G. Edward Griffin gives a stunning presentation on the quote, quote unquote, New World Order and how it was formed.
[41:22.560 --> 41:28.560]  And really, you know, he does that when he does the creature from Jekyll Island. It's just amazing.
[41:28.560 --> 41:36.560]  And this is open source information. And it's really out there mostly or was out there mostly for the elitists.
[41:36.560 --> 41:44.560]  They did like a small print run. And now it's been a cult classic and reprinted because more people are hip and aware of these things.
[41:44.560 --> 41:53.560]  But this consolidation of power takes place. And now we're left with Barack Obama who, come on, I mean, if you can't see that this man is a globalist,
[41:53.560 --> 41:59.560]  he's talking about a million and a half man youth brigade. A million and a half man youth brigade.
[41:59.560 --> 42:05.560]  Sounds like not to youth. Sounds like not to youth to me, especially when you give the speech in Berlin.
[42:05.560 --> 42:15.560]  I mean, God and Sky News, which is a, you know, Fox News out in Europe in London.
[42:15.560 --> 42:21.560]  They call it his New World Order speech. And he talks about global citizenship.
[42:21.560 --> 42:26.560]  And, you know, that's another thing that's just, you know, again, great. I don't know how much we got on camera with that.
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.560]  But wow, that experience with Ventura and Willie Nelson was just off the wall.
[42:31.560 --> 42:37.560]  I mean, you're in Willie's little luck town where they've shot, you know, movies and music videos.
[42:37.560 --> 42:43.560]  And, you know, Willie's just chilling behind the bar and having a good time and riding around his old Chevy pickup.
[42:43.560 --> 42:49.560]  I mean, he's not blinging. And that's why, you know, I really admire somebody like Willie Nelson,
[42:49.560 --> 42:55.560]  who has the guts to step up and say all these things and jeopardizes everything.
[42:55.560 --> 43:01.560]  His, you know, his family, you know, his stability. I mean, obviously he's Willie Nelson.
[43:01.560 --> 43:07.560]  But I mean, you know, you can get attacked and he was attacked severely, especially by Fox News or Riley and all that.
[43:07.560 --> 43:09.560]  But I mean, he's got a beautiful place on the land, but he didn't overdo it.
[43:09.560 --> 43:16.560]  He's not blinging like a rap star. You know, I mean, this, that truck must have been 10, 15 years old.
[43:16.560 --> 43:19.560]  I mean, he's taken in stray horses so they don't die.
[43:19.560 --> 43:25.560]  It was unbelievable. I mean, the little room that was like this little, I don't know, like a back door.
[43:25.560 --> 43:29.560]  I guess it would be like a shed, maybe about a 20 by 40 room.
[43:29.560 --> 43:32.560]  I mean, it was nice. Don't get me wrong, but it wasn't like decked out.
[43:32.560 --> 43:39.560]  He didn't have fine art all over the place. Just a simple man, a great man, a great musician with a great heart.
[43:39.560 --> 43:44.560]  It's amazing. And then, I don't know, I really love that song, Simple Man by Leonard Skinner.
[43:44.560 --> 43:48.560]  It was covered by, I think it was like Shine Down or something recently.
[43:48.560 --> 43:55.560]  And I believe in that. You know, I mean, I don't believe everything in the song, but you know, you got to live simply.
[43:55.560 --> 43:58.560]  You got to try to take care of your own, be good to other people.
[43:58.560 --> 44:04.560]  I don't believe in this social Darwinism that this quote unquote New World Order does believe in.
[44:04.560 --> 44:09.560]  That's what they believe in. Okay. They are social Darwinists. They're predators.
[44:09.560 --> 44:15.560]  And they use our apathy, our ignorance against us in a manner where we think, you know, this is another thing.
[44:15.560 --> 44:20.560]  Again, we talked about forever and it's over info wars.com. You can go check out the ride with Jesse,
[44:20.560 --> 44:27.560]  but we talked about how we want to pick a winner and we're fooled into believing that we can't vote our hearts.
[44:27.560 --> 44:32.560]  Well, that's ridiculous. Come election day.
[44:32.560 --> 44:38.560]  I'll be casting my vote for Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney.
[44:38.560 --> 44:43.560]  Is she perfect far from it? Is anybody perfect? No.
[44:43.560 --> 44:52.560]  However, I really feel like, you know, she's, she's open. She's a smart woman. She's savvy. She's a bulldog.
[44:52.560 --> 44:59.560]  And I, you know, Chuck Baldwin, great. You know, I talked about Bob Bar with Jesse is what, you know, we, we all were just like,
[44:59.560 --> 45:05.560]  what about Bob Bar? I'm like, you know, Bob Bar to me, although he's pretty good. He's, he's soft on a lot of issues.
[45:05.560 --> 45:08.560]  He's played politics for a long time. I don't know if I really trust him.
[45:08.560 --> 45:15.560]  And he said, well, what about Nader? And I mentioned, well, Nader again, he's really good on a lot of issues.
[45:15.560 --> 45:19.560]  The thing is, I feel he's a little bit of a socialist and he's not the best speaker anymore.
[45:19.560 --> 45:23.560]  He's getting on in years like all the speaking shouldn't count. You should vote for the man.
[45:23.560 --> 45:30.560]  And I'm like, yeah, but his presentation, you know, although it's solid and I like it, I feel like McKinney's got more fervor.
[45:30.560 --> 45:36.560]  So that's the great thing. You know, we could have an open debate in this country, but there isn't an open debate.
[45:36.560 --> 45:44.560]  The last three people I just named, you know, Bob Bar, Cynthia McKinney, Ralph Nader, Chuck Baldwin, four people.
[45:44.560 --> 45:49.560]  They're not even in 95% of the public consciousness.
[45:49.560 --> 45:53.560]  Well, you know, 30 to 40% of the public consciousness isn't going to vote anyway.
[45:53.560 --> 45:57.560]  Probably actually, I think it's more than that. But like 60, 70% isn't going to vote anyway.
[45:57.560 --> 46:04.560]  So they're not even in. So the people that do vote out of that percentage, maybe 5% know those candidates.
[46:04.560 --> 46:09.560]  And it's because the mainstream media wants to keep you in this two-party dictatorship.
[46:09.560 --> 46:13.560]  And Jesse elaborated that on that in length.
[46:13.560 --> 46:19.560]  So remember that when you're out in the polls, you know, this radio show has a substantial listening audience.
[46:19.560 --> 46:22.560]  And I'm hoping that you're going to go out there and vote your heart.
[46:22.560 --> 46:28.560]  I mean, another great thing about Jesse, Jesse's rocking a shirt when we go down to the backyard.
[46:28.560 --> 46:36.560]  And that great event there, Jimmy Vaughn, Willie Nelson, tons of other acts, you know, streamed it free on PrismPlanet.com.
[46:36.560 --> 46:39.560]  Just amazing stuff.
[46:39.560 --> 46:47.560]  And it says Obama, McCain, anybody but.
[46:47.560 --> 46:55.560]  And of course, anybody but is checked and he really says, you know, remember he was talking, he was up on Barack Obama when he first came on this show.
[46:55.560 --> 46:58.560]  He thought Barack was the real deal. He was saying the right things.
[46:58.560 --> 47:03.560]  And then he started to backpedal like a politician and Jesse realized it.
[47:03.560 --> 47:06.560]  And that is what he did. That's what they do.
[47:06.560 --> 47:10.560]  Okay. That's what politicians do. They backpedal.
[47:10.560 --> 47:12.560]  They do what the establishment tells them.
[47:12.560 --> 47:16.560]  And it's unfortunate because he's a really good speaker. He's very charismatic.
[47:16.560 --> 47:21.560]  He's got the people up in a fervor, up in a fervor.
[47:21.560 --> 47:26.560]  And that's why this story will be totally hyped. I mean, these two kids, they think about that folks.
[47:26.560 --> 47:30.560]  Obviously, you know, what kind of meds are these kids on?
[47:30.560 --> 47:35.560]  They might, they're not kids, they're young men, but I mean, you know, but let me, let me repeat it.
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.560]  They were going to go on a killing spree that included killing 88 people and be heading 14 African Americans.
[47:40.560 --> 47:46.560]  Of course, you know, to be heading, that's going to be really easy to do. I faced upon my training and experienced the numbers.
[47:46.560 --> 47:50.560]  88 and 14 have special significance with the white power movement.
[47:50.560 --> 47:54.560]  The individuals discussed doing home invasion robberies to fund their killing spree.
[47:54.560 --> 48:00.560]  So they're just going to rob all these people, kill all these people, then buy tuxedos, white tuxedos and top hats,
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.560]  and kill the president or the would be president.
[48:05.560 --> 48:11.560]  Hyped up big, but you know, again, we'll see where it goes.
[48:11.560 --> 48:14.560]  I think you're going to see a lot of that. There's a lot of delusional people out there.
[48:14.560 --> 48:21.560]  I mean, people get death, you know, the presidents especially get ludicrous death threats all the time.
[48:21.560 --> 48:30.560]  I mean, this office alone has been visited by the Secret Service because people posting physical threats on message boards towards the president and other public officials.
[48:30.560 --> 48:33.560]  They will show up and those people need to be dealt with.
[48:33.560 --> 48:36.560]  They're absolutely sick in the head. That's not how you deal with these people.
[48:36.560 --> 48:40.560]  You don't go out and go and murder them. Okay, I'm sorry.
[48:40.560 --> 48:47.560]  Or an attempted murder or, you know, like that crazy guy at the Grove years ago putting on a Captain America mask
[48:47.560 --> 48:49.560]  and letting off all these rounds and doing crazy stuff.
[48:49.560 --> 48:55.560]  That's not how you deal with people. You have to expose it. You have to change the system.
[48:55.560 --> 49:00.560]  And you know, we got a shot of changing some systems, you know, maybe not everybody out there.
[49:00.560 --> 49:03.560]  You know, obviously I said, get out there, vote your heart.
[49:03.560 --> 49:06.560]  But you know, this isn't a, you know, a baseball game.
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.560]  You're not trying to vote who's going to win or you're not gambling on it, hopefully.
[49:10.560 --> 49:16.560]  I'm sure Vegas is taking odds. The sixth society we live in.
[49:16.560 --> 49:18.560]  Vegas is taking odds on the top, man.
[49:18.560 --> 49:21.560]  But there are elections that do really matter.
[49:21.560 --> 49:27.560]  I would love to see Cindy Sheehan take the seat of Nancy Pelosi in the house.
[49:27.560 --> 49:30.560]  Are you happy? Are you listening, California?
[49:30.560 --> 49:34.560]  Are you listening? We need to get Cindy Sheehan into Congress.
[49:34.560 --> 49:42.560]  And yesterday, you know, Jesse popped in already on behalf of Dean Barkley out in the great state of Minnesota
[49:42.560 --> 49:46.560]  where GCN, John Harmon and Ted Anderson are all located.
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.560]  The great folks over there. Let's get him elected, Senator.
[49:51.560 --> 49:53.560]  Well, that's one in a hundred. That might even be bigger.
[49:53.560 --> 49:58.560]  I mean, those two are huge on two different levels. Okay, you only get two senators per state.
[49:58.560 --> 50:00.560]  Now, state senators, another thing, but that's not what he's going for.
[50:00.560 --> 50:03.560]  He's going for the real deal, the whole shebang-o, the Senate.
[50:03.560 --> 50:11.560]  Okay, but on the other level, you know, congressmen in New York and California
[50:11.560 --> 50:17.560]  tend to get a lot more press coverage than any other congressman in the country at all, no matter what.
[50:17.560 --> 50:23.560]  And Cindy Sheehan already has a huge name for herself, huge name in the media.
[50:23.560 --> 50:30.560]  For her to be elected to Congress would be a massive victory for the common sense movement,
[50:30.560 --> 50:34.560]  for the peace movement and for the truth movement.
[50:34.560 --> 50:40.560]  So things do matter. Your vote can come. I hope you're registered. God.
[50:40.560 --> 50:48.560]  Remember, folks, coming up, we got Tarpley on the flip side of the hour and about an hour and a half after that,
[50:48.560 --> 50:52.560]  we're going to have Willie Nelson on the bus. It's infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[50:52.560 --> 51:10.560]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[51:10.560 --> 51:13.560]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and home owners alike
[51:13.560 --> 51:17.560]  to sterilize homes and cars, making them free from bacteria, moles, viruses,
[51:17.560 --> 51:22.560]  and complete removal of secondhand smoke. Padotors, you name it. What else can three oxygen atoms,
[51:22.560 --> 51:28.560]  in other words, ozone do? Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations.
[51:28.560 --> 51:34.560]  And have you ever heard of ozone therapy? Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[51:34.560 --> 51:41.560]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[51:41.560 --> 51:51.560]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators by going to IonicZone.com or calling 800-549-9535.

[52:00.560 --> 52:07.560]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:07.560 --> 52:11.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:11.560 --> 52:13.560]  bin Laden. This is his ammo.
[52:13.560 --> 52:16.560]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:16.560 --> 52:23.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:23.560 --> 52:30.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:30.560 --> 52:34.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[52:34.560 --> 52:41.560]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[52:41.560 --> 52:48.560]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com
[52:48.560 --> 52:53.560]  or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[52:53.560 --> 53:00.560]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[53:02.560 --> 53:04.560]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?

[54:24.560 --> 54:34.560]  Oh, Johnny Cash!
[54:34.560 --> 54:38.560]  Man, I'm so greedy. Imagine getting to meet him.
[54:38.560 --> 54:43.560]  You know, I just got to meet Willie Nelson. That's not enough for me. I'd like to meet Johnny Cash from Beyond the Grave.
[54:43.560 --> 54:46.560]  I do listen to a lot of Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, though.
[54:46.560 --> 54:51.560]  I mean, more than people would think. I'm really not that into country, but they have some really great songs.
[54:51.560 --> 54:55.560]  They just really hit you hard.
[54:55.560 --> 54:59.560]  And this is, you know, before we go to Tarpley in the next hour.
[54:59.560 --> 55:04.560]  This is a big story that just broke over at PrismPlanet.com.
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.560]  But fluoride added to children milk in schools throughout UK city.
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.560]  So they're raping the economy. They're putting troops on the streets.
[55:12.560 --> 55:19.560]  They're giving us a two-party dicks-hatership where really the elitists control the game.
[55:19.560 --> 55:28.560]  And now, now, they're going to add fluoride to children's milk in schools throughout UK city.
[55:28.560 --> 55:30.560]  Not going to, they have.
[55:30.560 --> 55:35.560]  Fluoride is being added to children's milk in 42 schools throughout the city of Sheffield in the UK,
[55:35.560 --> 55:41.560]  despite the chemical's proven link to liver and kidney damage, cancer and lowering of IQ.
[55:41.560 --> 55:47.560]  A new strategy with the focus of preventing dental problems among children is to be introduced in Sheffield,
[55:47.560 --> 55:50.560]  reports the Yorkshire Post.
[55:50.560 --> 55:56.560]  The move comes in response to figures showing that the state of the children's teeth in the city is slightly higher than the national average.
[55:56.560 --> 55:58.560]  My God.
[55:58.560 --> 56:02.560]  At present, fluoride is added to children's milk in 42 primary schools in the city.
[56:02.560 --> 56:08.560]  This will continue and the local NHS is also planning to begin talks on the possibility of adding fluoride to water.
[56:08.560 --> 56:09.560]  The report continues.
[56:09.560 --> 56:12.560]  Delicious! Let's put fluoride in everything!
[56:12.560 --> 56:13.560]  Awesome!
[56:13.560 --> 56:14.560]  You know what?
[56:14.560 --> 56:18.560]  It's really like steak. Can't we just inject into that? I'm sure they're going to.
[56:18.560 --> 56:20.560]  Codex elementarius, anybody? Anyway.
[56:20.560 --> 56:25.560]  While fluoride has been proven to have a minimal effect on the prevention of tooth decay,
[56:25.560 --> 56:32.560]  the negative effects of the chemical are legion according to several medical studies far outweighing any positive aspects.
[56:32.560 --> 56:38.560]  A recent Scientific American study concluded that fluoride can subtly after an endocrin...
[56:38.560 --> 56:46.560]  It can subtly alter endocrin function, especially in the thyroid, the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism.
[56:46.560 --> 56:54.560]  The report also notes that a series of epidemiological studies in China have associated high fluoride exposures with lower IQ.
[56:54.560 --> 56:58.560]  Literally the dumbing down of the populace.
[56:58.560 --> 57:05.560]  But that's okay because I can go buy an iPhone for $300 at AT&T and my problems are solved.
[57:05.560 --> 57:11.560]  Even though I'm a little dumber, I got a cooler little toy where I can sloth over and get my sports scores.
[57:11.560 --> 57:13.560]  You know, I'm on the plane the other day.
[57:13.560 --> 57:15.560]  Coming into Austin.
[57:15.560 --> 57:17.560]  And every...
[57:17.560 --> 57:20.560]  UT! Woo! Where's the score?
[57:20.560 --> 57:23.560]  Oh, they're up! They need to be up two possessions.
[57:23.560 --> 57:26.560]  Luckily, the guy I was sitting next to wasn't...
[57:26.560 --> 57:29.560]  He was actually really interesting. He was a smart guy. He was into satellites.
[57:29.560 --> 57:32.560]  He was just coming from overseas and we had an awesome conversation.
[57:32.560 --> 57:38.560]  You know, not only about 9-11 government-sponsored terror, but the New World Order and globalization.
[57:38.560 --> 57:41.560]  And we talked about the Bohemian Grove. I mean, we got into some stuff.
[57:41.560 --> 57:44.560]  And that was just great. It shows you you can be a human being.
[57:44.560 --> 57:47.560]  You can reach out to other people. This was a total stranger.
[57:47.560 --> 57:51.560]  I'm sitting next to you on a flight for two and a half hours. I gave him a copy of my film.
[57:51.560 --> 57:53.560]  That's why it's so...
[57:53.560 --> 57:57.560]  That's why it's important to go to infowars.com. Go get fabled enemies. Go get loose change Final Cut.
[57:57.560 --> 58:01.560]  Go get Alex's film, The Road to Tyranny, the one that really woke me up to a lot of this stuff.
[58:01.560 --> 58:03.560]  Beyond 9-11.
[58:03.560 --> 58:07.560]  Really showed a pattern. Showed me Oklahoma City. Showed me the first World Trade Center bombing.
[58:07.560 --> 58:11.560]  Showed me how the feds had put those together as well.
[58:11.560 --> 58:15.560]  And you got to make copies. You got to hand them out.
[58:15.560 --> 58:19.560]  Spindle Town, USA. You know? That's how we make a difference.
[58:19.560 --> 58:23.560]  Send them down. Make them watch it. Please talk to these people. Let them know.
[58:23.560 --> 58:25.560]  It's a two-party dictatorship.
[58:25.560 --> 58:29.560]  We need to change the local government. Cindy Sheehan, Dean Barkley, let's do it.
[58:29.560 --> 58:33.560]  infowars.com, prismplan.com. We'll be back after this break.
[58:51.560 --> 58:55.560]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[58:55.560 --> 58:59.560]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do. At least we thought we did.
[58:59.560 --> 59:06.560]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[59:06.560 --> 59:15.560]  Whitman, EVA director on the AT made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[59:15.560 --> 59:22.560]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[59:22.560 --> 59:26.560]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting the countdown.
[59:26.560 --> 59:31.560]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[59:31.560 --> 59:38.560]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prismplanet.tv
[59:38.560 --> 59:43.560]  and aggressively spread it worldwide. Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[59:43.560 --> 59:53.560]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[59:53.560 --> 59:59.560]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:11.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:00:11.560 --> 1:00:17.560]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:17.560 --> 1:00:23.560]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:23.560 --> 1:00:26.560]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[1:00:26.560 --> 1:00:30.560]  I am not Alex Jones. I am Jason Bermas sitting in on this Wednesday.
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:35.560]  Actually, is it Wednesday? Yeah, it's Wednesday already, right? No, is it Tuesday?
[1:00:35.560 --> 1:00:41.560]  God, I'm getting my days mixed up. It's a Sunday Monday. And it's Tuesday, Jason. I'm out of it.
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:49.560]  Tuesday, October 28, 2008. And it's great, you know, we're going to put fluoride in the kids' milk at schools.
[1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:55.560]  And we're going to dumb down, you know, the populace even more delicious.
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:01:01.560]  That's awesome. Go read the whole article over at prismplanet.infowars. It's beyond belief.
[1:01:01.560 --> 1:01:07.560]  Top is coming up in about five minutes. After the break, we're going to have him on for at least an hour.
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:11.560]  We're going to discuss the election. I really want to get in depth about these two candidates.
[1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:16.560]  He's been very anti-Obama, and I'm anti-Obama as well, but, you know, I'm also anti-McCain.
[1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:19.560]  So it's just so hard for me to want any of it.
[1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:27.560]  I did pull up a news clip of the assassination attempt on Obama, the right one. Finally, I got it right.
[1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:33.560]  You know, second try. And, you know, these are skinhead punk kids. I haven't read the whole affidavit yet.
[1:01:33.560 --> 1:01:38.560]  I will get to it, but let's play this clip right now before we come up on this break.
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:41.560]  And right now there's another breaking story coming into our newsroom.
[1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:49.560]  Federal agents have disrupted an alleged plot to assassinate presidential candidate Barack Obama, as well as dozens of African-Americans.
[1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:53.560]  ABC7 investigative reporter Chuck Gowdy joins us with details. Chuck.
[1:01:53.560 --> 1:01:58.560]  Linda, two alleged skinheads, according to federal authorities, met about a month ago on the Internet.
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:07.560]  They have been in custody since last Wednesday as authorities investigated what was behind the suspected plot against Senator Obama.
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:14.560]  Last week, according to the authorities, they were driving around Central Tennessee discussing a white power murder plot,
[1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:19.560]  their car sporting a swastika in window chalk, and other race hate symbols.
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:24.560]  Federal prosecutors a short time ago, releasing a copy of the charges in the plot against Obama,
[1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:30.560]  that he was to be among 102 black victims targeted by a pair of young men from rural Tennessee.
[1:02:30.560 --> 1:02:37.560]  Authorities say the suspects plan to kill 88 victims with gunfire and 14 people by decapitation.
[1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:41.560]  Federal agents say there is significance to those numbers in skinhead circles.
[1:02:41.560 --> 1:02:51.560]  88 stands for Heil Hitler, H is the eighth letter of the alphabet, and 14. There are 14 words in the main marching orders of neo-Nazis.
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:56.560]  We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.
[1:02:56.560 --> 1:03:02.560]  The men, allegedly led by this man, 20-year-old Danny Cowart of Bells, Tennessee,
[1:03:02.560 --> 1:03:07.560]  allegedly plan to go on a national killing spree with Mr. Obama as their final target.
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:12.560]  They said that would be their last final act, according to a federal official,
[1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:19.560]  that they would attempt to kill Senator Obama. They didn't believe they would be able to do it, but that they would get killed trying.
[1:03:19.560 --> 1:03:24.560]  We took these photos a little while ago from Cowart's MySpace page on the Internet,
[1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:28.560]  a site loaded with pictures of guns that he claimed to own.
[1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:33.560]  Cowart and a man named Paul Schleselman, 18 years old, were arrested in Tennessee
[1:03:33.560 --> 1:03:38.560]  after Crockett County Sheriff's received a tip from a neighboring sheriff's department.
[1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:45.560]  The plotters admitted to investigators that they were planning to rob a gun shop to steal weapons for their killing spree.
[1:03:45.560 --> 1:03:53.560]  Investigators say the men had several weapons at the time they were arrested last week, including a Fuzzy 308 rifle and sawed-off shotguns.
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:59.560]  According to the affidavit on file in Washington, the men planned to go on a nationwide killing spree,
[1:03:59.560 --> 1:04:05.560]  targeting an African-American school in Tennessee, but they then planned to go to other states,
[1:04:05.560 --> 1:04:09.560]  and when they finally met up with Obama, according to federal investigators,
[1:04:09.560 --> 1:04:13.560]  they planned to drive their vehicle as fast as they could toward him,
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:19.560]  all of them dressed in white tuxedos and wearing top hats as they carried it out.
[1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:24.560]  We're still looking into this. It's just unfolding within the past hour out of Washington,
[1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:28.560]  and we will have much more coming up later on the ABC7 News.
[1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:30.560]  So there you go.
[1:04:30.560 --> 1:04:36.560]  We're these guys recruited because they're nuts on Myspace, or they're on medication, or they're just straight racists.
[1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:38.560]  Obviously, they didn't think they could do it.
[1:04:38.560 --> 1:04:41.560]  Who knows? We're going to get Webster Tarpley's take after the break.
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:59.560]  For more information on this, go to www.TarpleWars.com.
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:03.560]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:07.560]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:05:07.560 --> 1:05:11.560]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:13.560]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:16.560]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:23.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:30.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:05:30.560 --> 1:05:34.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:05:34.560 --> 1:05:41.560]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:48.560]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com
[1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:53.560]  or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.

[1:06:00.560 --> 1:06:04.560]  Break the law and you're caught on film.
[1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:09.560]  Practically impossible for police to spot plates that have been treated with a reflective spray.
[1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:11.560]  The reflection blinded our camera.
[1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:16.560]  We are under the microscope. Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:20.560]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[1:06:59.560 --> 1:07:05.560]  Phase one of the insiders' plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout.
[1:07:05.560 --> 1:07:12.560]  International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as savior.
[1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:14.560]  But we've only seen the beginning.
[1:07:14.560 --> 1:07:22.560]  Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times. Shortages and empty shelves will spread fear and panic across the land.
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:26.560]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to seize total power.
[1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:31.560]  Phase one is a one-world currency, which we are currently being prepared to accept.
[1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:35.560]  Phase two of their insidious plan is complete control of our food supplies.
[1:07:35.560 --> 1:07:45.560]  Go to www.foodshortageusa.com for the details. That's www.foodshortageusa.com to learn how to prepare for the unthinkable.

[1:08:00.560 --> 1:08:07.560]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:15.560]  All right, folks, we are back. It is the Alex Jones Show. I am Jason Burma, sitting in for Alex.
[1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:23.560]  I want to remind everybody to go to infowars.com and pick up a copy of my latest film, Fabled Enemies Dills with Really the Intelligence Ties,
[1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:30.560]  with the massage, the Pakistani ISI, the continuity of government program here in the United States, and 9-11.
[1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:39.560]  But right now we have Webster Tarpley, who, of course, is the author of Synthetic Terror, and, of course, Obama, the postmodern coup.
[1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:41.560]  Thanks for being on Webster.
[1:08:41.560 --> 1:08:49.560]  Another book, an even newer one, called Barack H. Obama, The Unauthorized Biography. So I've got two on Obama this year.
[1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:54.560]  Excellent. Well, obviously, I mean, let's get right into it. We're one week away from the election.
[1:08:54.560 --> 1:09:00.560]  You have been very anti-Obama. I mean, I'm not saying you're promocaine, obviously, or not, but why?
[1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:06.560]  For our audience, why don't you give an overview of why you think he is the much more dangerous candidate?
[1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:14.560]  Well, the short answer is because he's a fascist, and that is something unlike any other candidate seen so far.
[1:09:14.560 --> 1:09:21.560]  And in order to get into this, you've got to really go back and look at what fascism was, which is not what Naomi Klein,
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:27.560]  I'm sorry, Naomi Wolf, or Naomi Klein, for that matter, or this guy, Britt, or others are going to tell you,
[1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:33.560]  or, for that matter, Jonah Goldberg, there's a whole cottage industry to try to obscure what fascism was.
[1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:39.560]  Fascism is not a top-down dictatorship that becomes more and more stringent and oppressive,
[1:09:39.560 --> 1:09:43.560]  and you get a complete police state from the top down.
[1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:50.560]  For that, you wouldn't need a new term. That would just be a police state dictatorship, or a tyranny, or despotism, or something like that.
[1:09:50.560 --> 1:09:59.560]  Fascism has another component, which is a demagogic pseudo-revolutionary, hyper-revolutionary mass movement,
[1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:05.560]  and that's got to have grassroots cover. It's got to be anti-authoritarian. It's got to be radical.
[1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:08.560]  It's got to be leftist. It's got to be anti-establishment.
[1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:13.560]  And the only candidate in the field right now who has that is, of course, Obama.
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:21.560]  He's got this legion of Kool-Aid drinkers and fanatics, people who are devoted to a personality cult of Obama,
[1:10:21.560 --> 1:10:28.560]  and not to any set of issues, and there's a kind of utopian, apocalyptic aspect to this,
[1:10:28.560 --> 1:10:33.560]  that what's going to come out of this is not just policies that might be better or might be worse,
[1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:38.560]  but it's a radical renewal of the world, a renewal of the human personality, and so forth.
[1:10:38.560 --> 1:10:41.560]  And this is the most dangerous stuff you can get.
[1:10:41.560 --> 1:10:49.560]  So I would say right now the biggest danger is a seizure of power by the repo clique, by the Reed Pelosi Obama clique.
[1:10:49.560 --> 1:10:53.560]  That would essentially be the Mussolini fascist corporate state.
[1:10:53.560 --> 1:11:00.560]  And again, corporate in this case means a guild. It doesn't mean a modern corporation in the way that Mussolini used it.
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:08.560]  And that would be pretty much, you've got the fascistization of the economy through the $700 billion bailout for Goldman Sachs.
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:17.560]  That has set up what amounts to a compulsory state-sponsored cartel to drive down wages, to drive down production,
[1:11:17.560 --> 1:11:23.560]  but to shore up this $1.5 quadrillion derivatives bubble that we're stuck with.
[1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:28.560]  Well, let's get into the bailout in a minute, and I want to talk about what you just said about Obama,
[1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:34.560]  because I can't help but agree with you that he does have this rock star image where people do follow him.
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:45.560]  I mean, I've seen more artwork that spooks me out, that reminds me more of Maoist propaganda and these portraits of him in blue and off red.
[1:11:45.560 --> 1:11:47.560]  It is spooky to me there.
[1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:53.560]  And I do see where you're coming from on the fascist end as well, but are we really going to see that much of a difference
[1:11:53.560 --> 1:11:58.560]  than someone like McCain coming in who really looks like, I mean, no offense, but a walking corpse?
[1:11:58.560 --> 1:12:03.560]  I mean, I don't think he's going to make many decisions except for that on behalf of the establishment.
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:07.560]  I agree that he probably will not be able to coerce the people as easily.
[1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:10.560]  This guy, Obama, is definitely a charismatic guy.
[1:12:10.560 --> 1:12:16.560]  He's a good speaker, and he has been able to get away with, again, campaigning on almost nothing, just on his words and his personality.
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:20.560]  I don't know of any campaign points, such as, you know, getting us out of Iraq.
[1:12:20.560 --> 1:12:24.560]  We don't see that happening. People believe that, but it's just a de-escalation.
[1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:30.560]  It's quite the contrary if I may. Obama is the biggest warmonger in the field. Obama is a bigger warmonger than McCain.
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:35.560]  Obama is personally committed to bombing the hell out of Pakistan.
[1:12:35.560 --> 1:12:37.560]  He's very, very strong on that.
[1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:45.560]  And he started with that already a year ago this summer in Chicago, demanding the unilatable U.S. bombing of Pakistan and no two ways about it.
[1:12:45.560 --> 1:12:52.560]  He repeated that in his Denver convention speech saying, we've got to go and get bin Laden at the cave where he exists.
[1:12:52.560 --> 1:13:04.560]  Now, the world has changed. Nobody, any, not even these characters, have any serious interest in this bin Laden, al-Qaeda, 9-11, war on terror.
[1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:08.560]  This is not what they're doing now. They're attacking Pakistan because it's a Chinese ally.
[1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:12.560]  The world has radically shifted, and Obama, of course, is a key part of the shift.
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:16.560]  We no longer have a neocon Bush-Cheney regime in Washington.
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:28.560]  What we've got is a Rice-Gates-Mullen-Paulson regime, which is run by trilaterals, builder-burgers, people like Goldman Sachs, Soros, David Rockefeller, and so forth.
[1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:31.560]  And the target list has changed radically.
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:34.560]  Pakistan is the target because it's a Chinese ally.
[1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:44.560]  Biden is famous for his anti-Sudan tirades, and it's not about bin Laden and al-Qaeda. It's that you need a humanitarian invasion.
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:47.560]  He says, we've got to go in and save the people from genocide.
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:50.560]  But do you think they'll also sell the public with that?
[1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:52.560]  Let me finish the point.
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:55.560]  The point is that what they're after is to cut off the oil to China.
[1:13:55.560 --> 1:14:00.560]  Everybody knows that China gets six, seven, eight percent of their oil from Sudan.
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:07.560]  So the whole strategic map has changed. The people that are caught in the left liberal universe, they still don't understand this.
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:12.560]  They still think that they're dealing with Bush-Cheney and the neocons and that there's going to be an attack on Iran.
[1:14:12.560 --> 1:14:16.560]  I don't think there will be. There's an attack on Pakistan that's going on every day.
[1:14:16.560 --> 1:14:18.560]  There's an imminent attack on Sudan.
[1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:23.560]  And above all, the whole thing has shifted with Georgia being played against Russia by these people.
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:26.560]  We're now looking at confrontations in Central Europe.
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:31.560]  So the short answer to your question is, which imperialist do you want to fight?
[1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:38.560]  Do you want to fight a demagogic imperialist of the type of Obama who promises a facelift for the Anglo-American policy
[1:14:38.560 --> 1:14:44.560]  who can turn out 200,000 German lemmings in Berlin who's got this legion of Kool-Aid cultists?
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:52.560]  Or do you want a tired old reactionary, a lame duck, a transitional figure, someone who would be facing like McCain,
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:59.560]  facing a Congress that would be very hostile to him because they would feel that they had been robbed of their one-party state?
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:05.560]  I think what you really hope to get out of this thing, and it's a very modest program, is divided government.
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:12.560]  We want gridlock. We don't want bipartisan unity around new bailouts of the type that Goldman Sachs is demanding.
[1:15:12.560 --> 1:15:18.560]  We don't want the Social Security Trust Fund to be looted in this attempt to prop up the derivatives bubble.
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:22.560]  So Obama is simply more dangerous and more effective.
[1:15:22.560 --> 1:15:25.560]  If you want to organize the Third World War, you need Obama.
[1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:32.560]  You're not going to get anywhere with McCain because nobody in Europe is going to deliver money or troops to the U.S. based on McCain's face.
[1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:38.560]  McCain can't go to Africa and say, brothers, join with me and kick out these Chinese interlopers.
[1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:41.560]  Obama can do these things. He's more effective for imperialism.
[1:15:41.560 --> 1:15:46.560]  And I'm basically in the business of trying to make imperialism weaker rather than stronger.
[1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:49.560]  That's, I think, a way to approach the election.
[1:15:49.560 --> 1:15:54.560]  Well, I hear you there, Webster, but I just feel in my heart I can't vote anything but my heart.
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:56.560]  You know, I can't vote for the lesser than too evil.
[1:15:56.560 --> 1:15:58.560]  Wait, wait. Forget vote. What is vote?
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:01.560]  Vote. One wretched, miserable little vote.
[1:16:01.560 --> 1:16:04.560]  What you've got to do is attack Obama.
[1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:09.560]  Basically, expose Obama for what he is, and the people will do the rest.
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:15.560]  Right now, again, the worst possible outcome is Obama, Pelosi, and Reid.
[1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:19.560]  That is a government that will, among other things, try to shut down this radio program.
[1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:26.560]  The whole Genesis Network would be a target for hate crimes and for what they call the Fairness Doctrine.
[1:16:26.560 --> 1:16:29.560]  Do you think Cindy Sheehan has a shot against Pelosi in there?
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:37.560]  I wish her well. I hope she does the best she can, and I hope she at least embarrasses Mrs. Pelosi as much as possible.
[1:16:37.560 --> 1:16:43.560]  But the question of dictatorship, see, one thing is, you know, the FBI comes and harasses you.
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:45.560]  That's what we've seen with the Patriot Act.
[1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:47.560]  And it's clear that that has limits.
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:54.560]  You get to a point where the police and the secret police are not enough and the army cannot be relied on,
[1:16:54.560 --> 1:16:59.560]  and that's the classic point where the financiers, the Soros, Rockefeller, Goldman Sachs types,
[1:16:59.560 --> 1:17:08.560]  turn to a mass movement of gutter snipes and hooligans and thugs and goons and fervently idealistic students,
[1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:14.560]  and that's pretty much the Obama, this legion that he's got, the sort of left liberals,
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:20.560]  who they've been so blinded by their hatred of Bush and Cheney that they have imitated them in many ways,
[1:17:20.560 --> 1:17:23.560]  and they're now interested in suppressing free speech.
[1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:30.560]  They want to shut you down if you criticize their idol, and they bring to this a religious fanaticism
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:32.560]  that you just don't see on the other side.
[1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:37.560]  There's no group in this society that is, you know, a thousand percent devoted to McCain,
[1:17:37.560 --> 1:17:41.560]  and this simply means that Obama is by far the most dangerous.
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:46.560]  So if you come out of it with McCain and a Democratic Congress, let them fight each other to a standstill.
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:49.560]  That's the most you can hope for. I don't know what else you can hope for.
[1:17:49.560 --> 1:17:53.560]  And by the way, don't blame me for the situation, because I didn't create it.
[1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:57.560]  Well, absolutely, no one here is blaming you, Webster. Absolutely not.
[1:17:57.560 --> 1:17:59.560]  I don't know, I just see it as a lose-lose.
[1:17:59.560 --> 1:18:06.560]  I mean, you put Barack Obama in, you're more likely to get a progression of this with the people really standing for it,
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:08.560]  but again, he's a charismatic guy, he's a good speaker.
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:13.560]  I haven't seen a speaker, a politician as slick as him, since Bill Clinton, who was able to...
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:20.560]  Well, I wasn't around when Mussolini was around, so I don't speak Italian,
[1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:23.560]  so I can't really speak to how charismatic he was.
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:26.560]  But, you know, Clinton, I mean, he was smooth. He still is smooth.
[1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:30.560]  I mean, he's really good, and I see that in Barack Obama.
[1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:32.560]  He's able to smile and get around almost anything.
[1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:37.560]  Don't you think this is too superficial? I'm talking about a fascist mass movement.
[1:18:37.560 --> 1:18:43.560]  Now, Clinton didn't have this in his wildest dreams, and Mrs. Clinton, she had no such thing.
[1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:44.560]  Well, I would disagree.
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:45.560]  Bush doesn't have it.
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:48.560]  I would disagree that Bill Clinton didn't have that mass movement.
[1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:52.560]  By the time he was elected the second time, the country really did love him, Webster.
[1:18:52.560 --> 1:18:53.560]  You know what I mean?
[1:18:53.560 --> 1:18:57.560]  That's not a fascist mass movement. That's just a politician who is...
[1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:00.560]  What can you say about Clinton? He was better than Bush the Elder.
[1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:03.560]  He was better than Dole, and he was better than Bush the Younger.
[1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:06.560]  So, on that basis, he got a lot of people to follow,
[1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:09.560]  and I think he did some things that were very bad.
[1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:11.560]  But there's just no comparison.
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.560]  What you're doing is mixing apples and oranges.
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:19.560]  You're saying, just another bourgeois regime, just another reactionary, just another...
[1:19:19.560 --> 1:19:24.560]  And you're mixing that with a fascist mass movement and a one-party state.
[1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:29.560]  He's not even in right now, and right now the economy is being raped on another level
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:31.560]  with the bailout and the threat to congressmen.
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:32.560]  You're fine. Let's look at that.
[1:19:32.560 --> 1:19:34.560]  Yeah, let's look at that on the flip side.
[1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:36.560]  I do. I want to talk about the bailout.
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:38.560]  I want to talk about the economy being raped.
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:40.560]  I want to talk about the pension funds being gone.
[1:19:40.560 --> 1:19:43.560]  I want to talk about the Dow just totally and completely dropping.
[1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:46.560]  I think I went another 200 points yesterday.
[1:19:46.560 --> 1:20:00.560]  Go to WebsterTarpleyInfoWars.com, PrismPlanet.com, PrismPlanet.tv.
[1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:04.560]  I am so frustrated. I can't seem to remember anything anymore.
[1:20:04.560 --> 1:20:05.560]  What?
[1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:07.560]  Seriously, my memory and attention span is terrible.
[1:20:07.560 --> 1:20:09.560]  I read something and forget.
[1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:10.560]  I forget people's names.
[1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:14.560]  I hear all this great information on the radio, and I want to tell people, but I forget.
[1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:16.560]  Okay, slow down.
[1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:18.560]  Poor attention and memory loss is not your fault.
[1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:23.560]  Factors like fluoride in the water, aluminum and deodorants, genetically modified foods,
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:25.560]  the way the education system taught you.
[1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:27.560]  It's all meant to dumb you down.
[1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:30.560]  You know, I can remember everything now, even entire books.
[1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:31.560]  What? How?
[1:20:31.560 --> 1:20:34.560]  There is this website called School of Phenomenal Memory.
[1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:38.560]  Their online course is a real breakthrough in the field of memory improvement.
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:43.560]  In fact, they guarantee that every single person will be able to memorize any type of information,
[1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:47.560]  including entire books, after they complete just 60 lessons.
[1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:53.560]  And they offer a no-questions-asked, no-time limit, money-back guarantee.
[1:20:53.560 --> 1:20:54.560]  Wow. What's the website?
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:21:00.560]  Now, don't forget. It's pmemory.net, the letter P, memory.net.
[1:21:00.560 --> 1:21:05.560]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[1:21:05.560 --> 1:21:10.560]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:13.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[1:21:13.560 --> 1:21:16.560]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:19.560]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:22.560]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:29.560]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:35.560]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:39.560]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:41.560]  It's making great progress for the world government.
[1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:43.560]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[1:21:43.560 --> 1:21:45.560]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:46.560]  That's their affidavit.

[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:04.560]  Do you want to pay for the government bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:09.560]  You may have no choice. Obviously, taxpayers are on the hook for over $6 trillion.
[1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:13.560]  That's right, trillion dollars in mortgages held by these two corporations.
[1:22:13.560 --> 1:22:21.560]  The part that most people don't realize is that this bailout can have significant adverse effects on their 401Ks and IRAs.
[1:22:21.560 --> 1:22:26.560]  Unless you're planning to help pay for this bailout with your personal retirement funds, you need to act now.
[1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:30.560]  The solution is to fund a self-directed IRA with gold and silver.

[1:23:00.560 --> 1:23:05.560]  As a parent, your biggest fear is getting a phone call that your child has been attacked or worse.
[1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:10.560]  With your child going to college or moving out on their own, it's important to keep these safety tips in mind.
[1:23:10.560 --> 1:23:15.560]  Teach them to be aware of their surroundings. Walk on well that passed with friends or students.
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:18.560]  Secure the windows and doors of their dorm room or apartment.
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:20.560]  Know how to reach campus security.
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:24.560]  Always tell someone where they're going and when to expect their return.
[1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:27.560]  And always carry a self-defense device.

[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:24.560]  We're discussing the election. We're discussing the bailout.
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:30.560]  And before the break, I was trying to make the point that this rave of the economy has already really more than begun.
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.560]  I mean, this bailout is huge and this is under the Bush regime.
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:37.560]  And now we're moving probably into, you know, Obama.
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:42.560]  And to me, it's almost like the same people are heading both of them up.
[1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:45.560]  It's just going to be a continuation.
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:50.560]  You know, and I don't think that it's any less severe. I mean, I still see an agenda in Eurasia.
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:57.560]  I still see an agenda here at home, but don't we already live in really a pseudo-fascist society right now?
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:06.560]  I mean, the corporations pretty much have a dominant monopoly on the arms industry, on the housing market, on the media itself, Webster,
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:10.560]  and now really the banking cartel has gone just out of control.
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:15.560]  So I understand you think it's going to go to another level, so here you go, Webster. Go for it.
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:21.560]  You're making the mistake that people in Italy made in 1919, and they said, how could it get worse?
[1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:27.560]  We've got people that are forgotten today. We've got FACTA. We've got salandra. How could it be worse?
[1:25:27.560 --> 1:25:33.560]  And when Mussolini seized power with the March on Rome in 1922, they found it could get infinitely worse.
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:39.560]  And the same thing was in Germany. It was complicated by the fact that people by that time in the early 30s
[1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:44.560]  had been looking at Mussolini for a while, and there were a lot of leftists and labor people in Germany who said,
[1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:49.560]  well, burning is as bad as bad can be. He's already a fascist.
[1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:52.560]  So this Hitler will not make a big difference.
[1:25:52.560 --> 1:25:59.560]  And then when they went off the cliff in January of 1933, they saw that there was a qualitative difference.
[1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:05.560]  And this you can see in the memoirs and the memorabilia of the period.
[1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:09.560]  People had this idea that it was already as bad as it could get.
[1:26:09.560 --> 1:26:14.560]  But their imagination was nowhere near rich enough to grasp what was coming their way.
[1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:18.560]  But, Webster, wouldn't they need another big event, another big false flag,
[1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:22.560]  off either here or in Europe or Canada, perhaps, or maybe in Mexico?
[1:26:22.560 --> 1:26:24.560]  Sure. But of what type?
[1:26:24.560 --> 1:26:30.560]  The whole scenario for Obama has now been blurted out by Biden in Seattle on the 19th of October.
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:35.560]  He says basically two things. One is a 12-month perspective where he says,
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:42.560]  all economic decisions to deal with this systemic crisis and breakdown crisis of the banking system,
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:46.560]  these decisions that we will have to make will be sound decisions, he says,
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:53.560]  because he's a banker's boy, but they will be so unpopular that our regime will collapse in the polls within 12 months.
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:58.560]  So we want you to support us because we're making sound decisions even though everybody's going to say,
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:01.560]  wait a minute, what are you doing? I didn't vote for this. I didn't want this.
[1:27:01.560 --> 1:27:03.560]  That's the 12-month perspective.
[1:27:03.560 --> 1:27:07.560]  I mentioned this one because this is the one the Republicans generally don't want to talk about
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:10.560]  because they're going to try to do the same thing. That's correct.
[1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:13.560]  Now the other side of it is the six-month perspective,
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:17.560]  that there's going to be a generated international crisis hooked up
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:21.560]  and it's going to involve the Middle East, but Russia.
[1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:24.560]  Russia, Russia, Russia is the one that I would point you to
[1:27:24.560 --> 1:27:30.560]  because that already represents a qualitative escalation of the insanity and the danger.
[1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:37.560]  A country like Iran, basically defenseless in the sense of international intercontinental strategic weaponry.
[1:27:37.560 --> 1:27:41.560]  They can do a lot in the Gulf. They can do things in Iraq. They can do a great deal.
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:46.560]  But there's really very little way that they could strike the United States with any military means.
[1:27:46.560 --> 1:27:50.560]  But when you're dealing with Russia and China, then everything changes radically.
[1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:54.560]  You're talking about intercontinental ballistic missiles, hydrogen bomb, warheads,
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:58.560]  things that are much better in fact than a lot of things that the U.S. has.
[1:27:58.560 --> 1:28:03.560]  So Biden says we're going to have a test in the first six months
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:07.560]  and then he points out the righteousness of the U.S. position will not be evident.
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:11.560]  It won't be clear that we're doing the right thing and I think it means two things.
[1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:16.560]  The false flag question. The old false flag will not be repeated.
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:24.560]  I don't see just a repetition of the old false flag because the targets are no longer bin Laden, al-Qaeda, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan.
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:31.560]  That's over with. What is the target now is Russia, Moscow, and it somehow got to be a false flag
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:37.560]  that will get you a strike against an enemy of today, Pakistan maybe, Sudan.
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:39.560]  Again, these are Chinese out there.
[1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:42.560]  All right, but let me stop you there. Don't you think that they would use that same boogeyman?
[1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:49.560]  Bring out the General Mamoud Ahmed connection, the ISI connection, the fact that bin Laden lived there to spook the American public.
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:56.560]  I mean, you don't think they'll use that card again just to try to take with them the already somewhat conservative base
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:58.560]  that still believes in this war on terror?
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:03.560]  The whole war on terror is a totally discredited, used up and useless construct at this point.
[1:29:03.560 --> 1:29:08.560]  The intelligence community is not Johnny One Note. They can't be.
[1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:14.560]  You can't just go on till Kingdom come repeating bin Laden, al-Qaeda, and all this other stuff.
[1:29:14.560 --> 1:29:16.560]  This is discredited. This gets you nowhere.
[1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:19.560]  If you looked at the two conventions, these things were hardly mentioned.
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:24.560]  Biden was one of the ones who mentioned it, probably the only one at the Democratic convention,
[1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:27.560]  and at the Republican convention it was very, very much eclipsed.
[1:29:27.560 --> 1:29:31.560]  The new target is Russia. You've got to find ways to strike at Russia,
[1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:34.560]  and that gets you into a different kind of false flag.
[1:29:34.560 --> 1:29:38.560]  We'll come back to you right after this WebsterTarpley, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[1:29:38.560 --> 1:29:40.560]  I'm Jason Burns, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[1:29:40.560 --> 1:30:00.560]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.560 --> 1:30:07.560]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:30:07.560 --> 1:30:11.560]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:13.560]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:30:13.560 --> 1:30:16.560]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:23.560]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:30.560]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:34.560]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:41.560]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:45.560]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:28.560]  Alright, we are back at the Alex Jones show. Coming up in about an hour, we're going to have the exclusive Willie On The Tour bus interview.
[1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:37.560]  So cool to be able to go up to Willie Nelson's house, interview him and Jesse Ventura, you know, having conversations about what's going on in the world today.
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:43.560]  Right now we're discussing the election, the bailout with Webster Tarpley.
[1:33:43.560 --> 1:33:53.560]  And Webster, maybe you can explain this to me a little bit better, how this bailout is able to go from one administration to the other and then get just so much worse.
[1:33:53.560 --> 1:34:04.560]  I mean, obviously this is a down payment. This first $750 billion with another $150 billion on top of it that we know about publicly is probably, you know, a multiple trillion dollar deal.
[1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:13.560]  It will go into either administration, but you know, again, you really think that Obama can get the world behind him into this conflict with Russia.
[1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:21.560]  Now, obviously there was a test run for that, the Georgian conflict. Why do you think that this conflict with Russia has to happen?
[1:34:21.560 --> 1:34:29.560]  Do you feel that Russia is unhappy with their place in the world? Do you feel like they don't feel like they're going to have, you know, first world status in this new global order?
[1:34:29.560 --> 1:34:30.560]  Explain.
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:36.560]  If the Russia is not the aggressor, Georgia was the aggressor egged on by Soros, Brzezinski and others.
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:41.560]  Well, I agree there. I mean, absolutely. I mean, what's his name? Not Soros.
[1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:44.560]  So what's the president's name? I can't...
[1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:45.560]  Takash Vili.
[1:34:45.560 --> 1:34:52.560]  Yes, Akash Vili went on Glenn Beck and he, you know, he basically said that Russia was against the new world order right on television.
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:35:01.560]  So obviously they want their place in NATO, Georgia. They were under U.S. direction with special forces there and Israeli special forces as well, probably Blackwater.
[1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:03.560]  They were the aggressors. There's no doubt about that.
[1:35:03.560 --> 1:35:10.560]  But I mean, where do you... Why do you think Putin can't get along? You know, other... Why do you think they sent Georgia in there?
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:16.560]  Well, the issue is, who will have imperialist world domination for the next hundred years?
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:25.560]  And what we have now is an unprecedented crisis of Anglo-American imperialism. In other words, U.S.-British world domination has never been more threatened than right now
[1:35:25.560 --> 1:35:36.560]  because of pure bankruptcy, because of this 1.5 quadrillion-dollar derivatives bubble, which is now destroying the banking systems of London and New York.
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:38.560]  And these are the epicenters of the crisis.
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:47.560]  The normal response of Europe under these circumstances would be break off from the U.S. and the British and do east-west trade energy deals with Russia and Eurasia
[1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:55.560]  and save themselves at the same time that the rest of the world runs like as fast as they can from London and New York.
[1:35:55.560 --> 1:35:58.560]  So the Brzezinski calculation is something like this.
[1:35:58.560 --> 1:36:08.560]  If you can smash Russia and China, above all, if you can get an endgame where you get Russia and China at war with each other in World War III,
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:16.560]  this is the ultimate goal for somebody like Brzezinski, a geopolitician, then the U.S. and the British can rule the world for another hundred years.
[1:36:16.560 --> 1:36:22.560]  But if they don't do this, the U.S.-British empire is simply doomed, so they're interested in doing this.
[1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:35.560]  Now, from that we get the bailout. Now, remember, if you go back to Nazi Germany, a lot of the fascist economic infrastructure was indeed installed before Hitler's seizure of power.
[1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:45.560]  This was done by a guy called Schacht, S-C-H-A-C-H-T, Yalmar Schacht, who was the head of the central bank, and then he became Hitler's finance minister.
[1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:49.560]  But the problem is you've also got to have a political structure that goes with it.
[1:36:49.560 --> 1:37:00.560]  So here we have already the fascist corporate state, and again that means the state-sponsored compulsory cartel for the purpose of crushing wages,
[1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:10.560]  driving down production, right, destroying industrial capacity, but shoring up the derivatives bubble, purely fictitious, bloated speculative values.
[1:37:10.560 --> 1:37:16.560]  But you've got to have a political administration that goes with it, and that means this fascist mass movement.
[1:37:16.560 --> 1:37:25.560]  What we've seen so far is the situation where Bush taps your phone, the national security agency taps your phone, violating the FISA law,
[1:37:25.560 --> 1:37:29.560]  or some FBI agents come to your house and harass you.
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:44.560]  Fascism is when a mob of hooligans and goons and students and fanatics come to your home, burn it out, lynch you, rape your wife, and destroy everything that you've ever put together.
[1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:49.560]  So this is really the nightmare scenario that you project in America. If he gets elected, how would you...
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:56.560]  You can see this coming. Look, it's also the idea of an extra-legal goon squad that operates with the tolerance of the police.
[1:37:56.560 --> 1:38:02.560]  I mean, Mussolini's March on Rome in October 1922, militarily was a joke.
[1:38:02.560 --> 1:38:09.560]  There was no way they could seize control of Rome, but the army was told, don't do anything, and the police were told, fine, let them in.
[1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:15.560]  This is what we need. The ruling class wants this to be the next government.
[1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:24.560]  You've got this case up in Burlington, Vermont. The guy goes up to a book table of middle-aged ladies tabling for Obama, asks a very interesting question.
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:34.560]  What's the relation of Obama to Brzezinski? The middle-aged charming ladies call the cops, the guys thrown to the ground, threatened with a taser, kept in jail for 36 hours.
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:43.560]  He's now got a court date in Missouri. You've got prosecutors and sheriffs who are saying, if you lie about Obama, we're going to come after you with criminal charges.
[1:38:43.560 --> 1:38:52.560]  Anybody who's got a Federal Communications Commission license knows that they will be in big trouble if we get the Obama Pelosi read regime.
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:59.560]  Larry Sinclair goes to the National Press Club in June, gives his charges against Obama, which you can see at his website,
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:08.560]  and then he's arrested with a hoped-up warrant by Beau Biden, the son of Joe Biden, the current Democratic vice presidential candidate.
[1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:15.560]  So you're getting an unmistakable pattern of goon squad activities where it's an illegal or extra-legal goon squad.
[1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:27.560]  Another one, if Bush taps your phone under FISA, the left liberals, of course, will scream, but you can hack into Palin's email if you're a young fascist from Tennessee
[1:39:27.560 --> 1:39:33.560]  and you put that up on thegalker.com, and everybody thinks that's wonderful. The left liberals think that's great.
[1:39:33.560 --> 1:39:38.560]  See, the interesting thing about the left liberals is normally they would be concerned about police state measures,
[1:39:38.560 --> 1:39:48.560]  but the genius of fascism is it allows the fascist mass movement to present itself under left cover, and that's really the key thing.
[1:39:48.560 --> 1:39:54.560]  Obama has that, right? Obama's got some left cover. McCain, of course, has none, so when it comes to strike-breaking,
[1:39:54.560 --> 1:40:00.560]  when it comes to imposing austerity, Obama's more effective. McCain will say, we've got to fight the war on terror,
[1:40:00.560 --> 1:40:07.560]  and people will say, get lost, go home, we're sick of this tissue of lies. Obama will say, I'm doing it for the polar bears,
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:13.560]  for global warming, I'm doing it for the third world solidarity, for people starving in Africa.
[1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:18.560]  Well, I don't think there's a doubt that he's more worldly, he's more influential, he's more well-spoken, he's more...
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:25.560]  I don't know why you keep coming back to this. I think the guy is a wreck. In other words, what I see is mental impairment
[1:40:25.560 --> 1:40:32.560]  from cocaine in marijuana. He's not eloquent at all. If you take away the glass plates of the teleprompter,
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:38.560]  the guy's tongue tied. He can't put two words together. He's actually worse as a speaker than Bush,
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:41.560]  except if he's got the glass plates of the teleprompter.
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:42.560]  You really think so?
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:43.560]  Sure.
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:50.560]  I don't know, Webster. You can put together some of these right-wingers, who are at least doing something.
[1:40:50.560 --> 1:40:58.560]  They put together, you know, he stammers, he stutters, he hems, he hauls, he gurgles, he gargles.
[1:40:58.560 --> 1:41:03.560]  You know, you know, you know. Whenever he's in deep water, you can hear him searching for the words.
[1:41:03.560 --> 1:41:08.560]  I think in terms of being a spontaneous speaker without the glass plates of the teleprompter,
[1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:15.560]  he's one of the worst we've seen in recent years. It's a complete media facade of lies and distortions
[1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:21.560]  and an above-all-hero worship, because this is the other thing for people to understand.
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:26.560]  If you want to know who Wall Street's candidate is, turn on any television network for the evening news.
[1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:31.560]  You will know within 10 minutes, Wall Street demands Obama. If you don't want Obama,
[1:41:31.560 --> 1:41:32.560]  there's something wrong with you.
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:35.560]  Well, I agree there. I mean, obviously, we've got more, so what do you do?
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:40.560]  How do you respond? You want to fight back against Wall Street and defeat their candidate.
[1:41:40.560 --> 1:41:43.560]  Yeah, I agree. I think that they've got the other guy in their pocket.
[1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:45.560]  And like I said, McCain doesn't look too good.
[1:41:45.560 --> 1:41:47.560]  But he's a weak entry. He's a weak entry.
[1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.560]  I agree, but what happened to McCain?
[1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:50.560]  He's not going to be able to deliver.
[1:41:50.560 --> 1:41:53.560]  In other words, he'll try to deliver austerity. It won't work.
[1:41:53.560 --> 1:41:56.560]  He'll try to deliver a coalition against Russia. That won't work either.
[1:41:56.560 --> 1:42:01.560]  What if he dies, Webster, in office, and then they just put in Palin and they put somebody in as the VP
[1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:03.560]  that they can, you know, more easily massage.
[1:42:03.560 --> 1:42:06.560]  A much better bet than Obama-Biden.
[1:42:06.560 --> 1:42:12.560]  At least the only person who's not an investment banker, not a banker's boy, not a millionaire.
[1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:15.560]  I'd take a chance. What are you going to do?
[1:42:15.560 --> 1:42:20.560]  Well, then I'd also like to ask what you think the shot of Obama being assassinated in office is.
[1:42:20.560 --> 1:42:22.560]  I mean, obviously, you think he's ridiculous.
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:27.560]  You think that this is one of the memes spread by the Obama campaign.
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:31.560]  As a matter of fact, this is actually a turning point in the intelligence picture.
[1:42:31.560 --> 1:42:38.560]  If you're listening to the news reports today, we've got these two pathetic patsies, two mythomaniacs,
[1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:43.560]  two white supremacist skinheads, one from Tennessee, one from Arkansas,
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:47.560]  and they had a plan. They're going to rob a gun shop, go to a black high school,
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:52.560]  kill determined numbers of people, cut the heads off some of them, jump back in the car,
[1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:58.560]  rob another gun shop, get white tuxedos, and then attack Obama with rifles from afar.
[1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:05.560]  This is absolutely ridiculous. This is in the same league with the Fort Dix Six, right?
[1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:09.560]  The six who wanted supposedly to barge into Fort Dix and start shooting,
[1:43:09.560 --> 1:43:14.560]  or the JFK pipeline bombers, or the Canadian fertilizer bombers.
[1:43:14.560 --> 1:43:17.560]  Absolutely ridiculous. I mean, there's no way you're going to kill them.
[1:43:17.560 --> 1:43:18.560]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:21.560]  I mean, Rob Holmes on the way. I read part of the affidavit and played the clip.
[1:43:21.560 --> 1:43:26.560]  But this is a necessity because this is a meme of the Obama myth.
[1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:32.560]  And one of the things the Kool-Aid cultists and lemming legions of Obama need to be told periodically
[1:43:32.560 --> 1:43:35.560]  that there are dark forces conspiring against their men,
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:40.560]  because otherwise it might begin to dawn on him that he is the candidate of Goldman Sachs.
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:45.560]  Look, you have this guy Kramer, who goes on CNBC in the afternoons.
[1:43:45.560 --> 1:43:48.560]  Kramer speaks for the trading desk at Goldman Sachs.
[1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:54.560]  Now, Goldman Sachs' money is flowing to Obama at about three to one to four to one.
[1:43:54.560 --> 1:43:58.560]  So for every dollar that McCain gets bundled for him from Goldman Sachs,
[1:43:58.560 --> 1:44:01.560]  Obama gets three, four, and maybe more.
[1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:07.560]  The government, right now, this is not again, it's not a Bush-Cheney government anymore.
[1:44:07.560 --> 1:44:11.560]  Those are lame ducks, caretakers, ground keepers.
[1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:13.560]  They count for absolutely nothing.
[1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:14.560]  All right, well then, I've got to ask.
[1:44:14.560 --> 1:44:17.560]  If you look at this bill, that Paulson runs the government.
[1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:21.560]  Paulson is the economic dictator of the U.S. Gates.
[1:44:21.560 --> 1:44:24.560]  It's so powerful that he's going to stay on into Obama,
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:29.560]  and he's a Brzezinski boy from the Carter administration, 77 to 79.
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:33.560]  Well, I've got to ask you, for instance, the continuity of government program.
[1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:37.560]  It was revamped in the 80s under George Herbert Walker Bush.
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:39.560]  Cheney's pretty much been in the succession program.
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:43.560]  Since that, obviously, he was part of it on 9-11.
[1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:47.560]  Do you think his role in continuity of government or shadow government just ends?
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:48.560]  I think it's finished, of course.
[1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:49.560]  He's worked up.
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:50.560]  He counts for absolutely nothing.
[1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:52.560]  He can't go to the North Korea.
[1:44:52.560 --> 1:44:54.560]  Look, I give you a concrete case.
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:59.560]  He didn't want North Korea taken off the terrorist list, and he fought a big battle,
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:02.560]  and Condoleezza Rice walked all over him.
[1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:06.560]  You've got Biden going to the Israelis and saying to them,
[1:45:06.560 --> 1:45:10.560]  Dear Israelis, there's going to be a nuclear armed Iran,
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:13.560]  and you are going to do nothing about it, and you are going to like it.
[1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:15.560]  Mullen goes to the Israelis and says,
[1:45:15.560 --> 1:45:17.560]  Don't you dare do anything vis-a-vis Iran.
[1:45:17.560 --> 1:45:20.560]  We have our policy, and you will damn well do what you're told.
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:27.560]  So this entire world, see, the world of Bush Cheney and the neocons is gone, finished,
[1:45:27.560 --> 1:45:29.560]  put, they're washed up.
[1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:34.560]  If you're looking for covert operations, Obama is the covert operation.
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:36.560]  It is a post-modern coup.
[1:45:36.560 --> 1:45:41.560]  It's based on the Orange Revolution in Kiev, the Roses Revolution in Tiflis, Georgia.
[1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:45.560]  These other things that were going on during the Bush Cheney years,
[1:45:45.560 --> 1:45:50.560]  the National Endowment for Democracy, the left wing of the CIA, the foundations,
[1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:56.560]  the Soros, Brzezinski, Human Rights, International Crisis Group, left cover world.
[1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:00.560]  If you're so focused on the top-down stuff, do you think the police state
[1:46:00.560 --> 1:46:04.560]  is coming from some building in Washington, D.C., it's wrong.
[1:46:04.560 --> 1:46:09.560]  It's coming from a gutter near you with Obama fanatics coming up out of the sewer
[1:46:09.560 --> 1:46:13.560]  and coming after you with the connivance of the police and intelligence.
[1:46:13.560 --> 1:46:16.560]  They've also kind of set up an indoctrination.
[1:46:16.560 --> 1:46:19.560]  He's talked about the million-and-a-half-man youth brigade.
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:23.560]  Do you think he's going to use more of the bureaucracies, maybe homeland security
[1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:27.560]  or something like that to bring these into a business to indoctrinate youth?
[1:46:27.560 --> 1:46:30.560]  That'll take some time, don't you think, Webster, at least a couple years.
[1:46:30.560 --> 1:46:32.560]  This is the Obama regime.
[1:46:32.560 --> 1:46:34.560]  He's got five volunteer organizations.
[1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:37.560]  He's got a Homeland Security Corps, a Green Corps.
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:38.560]  That's great.
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:41.560]  If they decide that you're a polluter, they'll come and burn you out
[1:46:41.560 --> 1:46:43.560]  or do something like this.
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:48.560]  The whole logic of Obama is stuff like in Mussolini had this youth movement
[1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:50.560]  called Balila, this kind of stuff.
[1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:52.560]  Nobody knows these things in the U.S. anymore.
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:59.560]  That's one of the problems is that the early phase of fascism is now 75 to 90 years behind us.
[1:46:59.560 --> 1:47:02.560]  So there's basically nobody left who remembers it.
[1:47:02.560 --> 1:47:05.560]  And the people who purport to write about fascism don't tell you.
[1:47:05.560 --> 1:47:10.560]  But the idea of having mass organizations of the government
[1:47:10.560 --> 1:47:15.560]  from somebody who comes into power with a movement of fanatics,
[1:47:15.560 --> 1:47:17.560]  that's fascism.
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:18.560]  That's Mussolini.
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:22.560]  And it's not the conservative reactionary kind of stuff with Bush.
[1:47:22.560 --> 1:47:28.560]  For example, one of the criticisms that Obama has of Bush is he attacks him from the right.
[1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:33.560]  He says, Bush, after 9-11, you should have decreed crushing austerity.
[1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:36.560]  You could have cut the living standard by a third or a half
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:39.560]  and given that money to Wall Street under the cover of the war on terror.
[1:47:39.560 --> 1:47:42.560]  You didn't do that, Bush. That's what we're going to do.
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:44.560]  And he does it with left cover.
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:48.560]  Not Bin Laden, not Al-Qaeda, but again, the polar bear, global warming.
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:53.560]  Hold on. Listen, I listened to his acceptance speech actually when I was driving back to New York.
[1:47:53.560 --> 1:47:54.560]  It was on NPR or something.
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:47:55.560]  And he mentioned Bin Laden.
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:47:58.560]  And he mentioned, you're right, he mentioned going into Pakistan and wherever it took him.
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:47:59.560]  Absolutely.
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:01.560]  This is the only place, though.
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:03.560]  And again, you've got to understand why are they doing what they're doing.
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:09.560]  The Afghan war is now being run for the purpose of destroying Pakistan as a unified state.
[1:48:09.560 --> 1:48:11.560]  Well, I don't want an opium.
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:13.560]  Yeah, fine, but this has been going on forever.
[1:48:13.560 --> 1:48:14.560]  Tell me something new.
[1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:19.560]  The new thing is, instead of having one Pakistan with a government in Islamabad,
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:21.560]  it's going to be five or six mini-states.
[1:48:21.560 --> 1:48:23.560]  This is the Brzezinski policy.
[1:48:23.560 --> 1:48:25.560]  Micro-states and mini-states.
[1:48:25.560 --> 1:48:29.560]  So, Pushtunistan, Balochistan, Waziristan, Sindh,
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:32.560]  and they have these separatist groups that correspond to each of these.
[1:48:32.560 --> 1:48:37.560]  The goal, again, being that it must be destroyed because in a strategic confrontation,
[1:48:37.560 --> 1:48:41.560]  Pakistan traditionally goes with China against India.
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:45.560]  But the Anglo-Americans imagine that they'll be using India against both.
[1:48:45.560 --> 1:48:48.560]  Out of that, don't you feel they still want to build some kind of a Eurasian Union
[1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:49.560]  that's under their control?
[1:48:49.560 --> 1:48:52.560]  I mean, you're saying Iran is probably off the table no matter what.
[1:48:52.560 --> 1:48:58.560]  Iran is on the table, but as a kamikaze puppet to be thrown against Russia
[1:48:58.560 --> 1:49:01.560]  in the same way that Georgia has been thrown against Russia.
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:04.560]  There is a plan, and this is pure Brzezinski.
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:08.560]  Brzezinski would say, look, I installed this government.
[1:49:08.560 --> 1:49:11.560]  The Mullahs were installed by Brzezinski.
[1:49:11.560 --> 1:49:15.560]  I read about this at some length in Obama the Postmodern coup,
[1:49:15.560 --> 1:49:17.560]  the making of a Manchurian candidate.
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:20.560]  That you can get from the Alex Jones Info War stories.
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:22.560]  I've also got Obama the unauthorized biography.
[1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:26.560]  Both of these reflect the fact that the overthrow of the Shah
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:30.560]  and the bringing in of Khomeini was a Carter Brzezinski project.
[1:49:30.560 --> 1:49:32.560]  The project against the Soviets.
[1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:38.560]  Remember, Brzezinski's world is determined by a fanatical hatred of Russia.
[1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:42.560]  And in this void of ideas, and you could see it, you could see this in public,
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:48.560]  the main public opponent of the neocons in terms of an alternative imperialist strategy
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:52.560]  has been Brzezinski since 2006, 2007, right?
[1:49:52.560 --> 1:49:56.560]  And he even tried to stop them from attacking Iran because he says,
[1:49:56.560 --> 1:49:58.560]  why do you want to attack Iran?
[1:49:58.560 --> 1:49:59.560]  I have plans for Iran.
[1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:02.560]  I can turn the Iranians against the Russians.
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:04.560]  And look what I can accomplish.
[1:50:04.560 --> 1:50:06.560]  Other possibilities, right?
[1:50:06.560 --> 1:50:08.560]  You've got Poland and Ukraine.
[1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:11.560]  This is Brzezinski country, par excellence.
[1:50:11.560 --> 1:50:13.560]  Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, these places.
[1:50:13.560 --> 1:50:18.560]  What they'd like to do this winter is to have a crisis where Poland and Ukraine
[1:50:18.560 --> 1:50:23.560]  cut off the flow of natural gas from Russia into Western Europe.
[1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:26.560]  So you get a hysteria in Western Europe, people who are cold
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:31.560]  and sitting in the dark and can't cook their food and start blaming Russia.
[1:50:31.560 --> 1:50:37.560]  So you play Europe and above all play these unstable dictatorships of Eastern Europe
[1:50:37.560 --> 1:50:40.560]  that are sort of NATO, IMF, puppet states.
[1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:43.560]  Play them against Russia and try to get rid of both of them that way.
[1:50:43.560 --> 1:50:44.560]  That's Brzezinski.
[1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:48.560]  You know what folks, let's take your calls on all these matters with Webster Tarpley.
[1:50:48.560 --> 1:50:51.560]  In the next segment, hopefully we'll hold them over past the hour.
[1:50:51.560 --> 1:50:54.560]  This is the Alex Jones show, infowars.com, prisonplan.com.
[1:50:54.560 --> 1:50:58.560]  Willie Nelson on the bus coming up in about 35, 45 minutes.
[1:51:06.560 --> 1:51:09.560]  What will you do when it happens?
[1:51:09.560 --> 1:51:15.560]  When you turn to your loved ones, will you see starvation and fear or confidence
[1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:20.560]  because you knew what was coming and got prepared with patreonfood.com?

[1:51:24.560 --> 1:51:29.560]  Your indifference today will determine the magnitude of your suffering tomorrow.
[1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:34.560]  What good is it to know the truth about any conspiracy unless you take action?
[1:51:34.560 --> 1:51:40.560]  patreonfood.com has 100 pounds of dry food supplies for just $3 a pound.

[1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:37.560]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:52:37.560 --> 1:52:43.560]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:52:43.560 --> 1:52:46.560]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th avenue.

[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:31.280]  there is a lot of photographic evidence from the day after the cult
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:35.440]  the bill is classed the beams you know the way the beams are caught
[1:55:35.440 --> 1:55:38.560]  when they do the control demolition
[1:55:38.560 --> 1:55:41.520]  uh... you guys should have a car some kind of picture book or something
[1:55:41.520 --> 1:55:43.720]  people well i would say this

[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:50.280]  and uh... steven jones both have excellent powerpoint presentations
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:51.200]  there's excellent
[1:55:51.200 --> 1:55:55.720]  you to presentations i believe we show that evidence in loose change second
[1:55:55.720 --> 1:55:59.360]  edition we show even more evidence on top of that in loose change final cut
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:01.160]  that's all available for free
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:04.600]  online and uh... you really just have to look around for them in obviously that's
[1:56:04.600 --> 1:56:06.200]  compelling evidence i think that
[1:56:06.200 --> 1:56:07.480]  steven jones
[1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:11.600]  is on the right track with some kind of a thermite thermate
[1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:15.040]  basis to cut those beams in the manner that they are worth thanks for the call
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:15.600]  eric
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:20.560]  uh... let's jump to rick in south carolina rick what's on your mind
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:23.640]  hi jason uh... always good to hear you on
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:26.040]  on the show i'll thank you and
[1:56:26.040 --> 1:56:29.640]  and i'm in wednesday carpley is an incredible intellect
[1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:31.560]  i want to jump back a little bit
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:34.880]  uh... to the beginning of the show when you mentioned uh...
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:38.680]  dean barkley and send the sheen and we certainly want to get behind them and
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:40.080]  help them but also
[1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:44.440]  uh... i wanted to throw somebody else uh... is the name out because uh...
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:47.400]  what if we could get rid of lindsay graham
[1:56:47.400 --> 1:56:50.960]  and we're getting very close to it there's a guy running neck and neck with
[1:56:50.960 --> 1:56:54.160]  him lindsay graham has four million dollars
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:58.720]  and run uh... lots of ads this guy has has uh... done it on a shoestring with a
[1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:00.840]  hundred thousand dollars so far
[1:57:00.840 --> 1:57:02.440]  i give a website
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:06.600]  and his name is bob comley he's running as a democrat against
[1:57:06.600 --> 1:57:08.000]  when the ground
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:09.080]  and uh...
[1:57:09.080 --> 1:57:12.880]  is uh... his website is aim high with bob
[1:57:12.880 --> 1:57:15.840]  dot com aim high with bob dot com
[1:57:15.840 --> 1:57:19.240]  do you have any comments on the presidential election rick
[1:57:19.240 --> 1:57:21.040]  uh... i think that
[1:57:21.040 --> 1:57:24.480]  uh... i'm going to i know i'm going to vote third party i'm probably going to
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:28.440]  vote for chuck baldwin i think they are the good one to i think that the
[1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:31.480]  mckinney is to i think we should go to a conscious i think
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:34.920]  whoever we vote for we should vote third party to let them know
[1:57:34.920 --> 1:57:38.320]  we're not eating the oatmeal anymore what do you think about that webster i
[1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:39.440]  think for the cal rick
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:43.160]  that maybe you know even if we can't get our candidates elected if we get a
[1:57:43.160 --> 1:57:46.760]  substantial amount of people voting third party just third party you know
[1:57:46.760 --> 1:57:52.040]  nader mckinney baldwin bar that that does show the establishment that there
[1:57:52.040 --> 1:57:53.760]  is a large number of us
[1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:57.840]  i think people should look at a vote as a strategic uh... asset in other words
[1:57:57.840 --> 1:57:59.360]  it's not a sacrament
[1:57:59.360 --> 1:58:01.360]  you're not marrying anybody
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:04.440]  you could get into strategic voting again i think a lot of people are
[1:58:04.440 --> 1:58:07.080]  listening to this are actually opinion leaders
[1:58:07.080 --> 1:58:11.360]  who should be able to move ten twenty fifty a hundred votes not just their one
[1:58:11.360 --> 1:58:14.080]  wretched miserable tormented little boat
[1:58:14.080 --> 1:58:17.840]  uh... at the end of all this right now but you use your influence
[1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:20.920]  to move the masses my point would be three
[1:58:20.920 --> 1:58:22.000]  first of all
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:26.880]  you want to stop obama at all costs that the absolute imperative no bomb up
[1:58:26.880 --> 1:58:28.000]  the second one
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:31.600]  you've got to punish people who voted for the bailout i thought this after the
[1:58:31.600 --> 1:58:35.040]  uh... break webster it's info wars dot com prison plan dot com is the alice
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:42.040]  joan show will be back after this

[1:58:55.640 --> 1:58:58.240]  act of war against this country
[1:58:58.240 --> 1:59:00.920]  the enemy struck america on september eleventh
[1:59:00.920 --> 1:59:02.440]  but who is the army

[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:21.560]  some u.s. investigators believe that there are israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s.
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:25.440]  i'm aware that uh... some israeli citizens have been detained
[1:59:25.440 --> 1:59:27.240]  london's connections to the cia

[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:06.960]  big brother
[2:00:06.960 --> 2:00:08.760]  mainstream media
[2:00:08.760 --> 2:00:10.520]  government cover-ups
[2:00:10.520 --> 2:00:12.080]  you want answers
[2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:13.640]  well so does he
[2:00:13.640 --> 2:00:15.440]  he's alex jones
[2:00:15.440 --> 2:00:18.680]  on the gcm radio network
[2:00:18.680 --> 2:00:21.000]  live from austin texas
[2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:23.000]  alex jones
[2:00:23.000 --> 2:00:29.760]  all right folks we are back it is tuesday october twenty eight two thousand eight one week from election day
[2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:32.320]  and we've been talking to us in the past hour
[2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:35.560]  we're taking your calls right now and uh...
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:39.600]  in these last in these five minutes before we go to the next segment uh...
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:41.320]  webster and take more callers
[2:00:41.320 --> 2:00:46.040]  i want to go over those three points now obviously your agenda is to stop obama at all costs what are the
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:50.280]  other two big points that we have to get by on the selection in a few more comments first of all no
[2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:53.840]  bombastop obama at all costs if you don't stop obama
[2:00:53.840 --> 2:00:56.600]  you're going off a cliff you're leaping into an abyss
[2:00:56.600 --> 2:00:58.960]  and most people have very little idea
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:03.400]  of what fascism was and what this is going to look like uh... again reread that
[2:01:03.400 --> 2:01:04.760]  thing from biden
[2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:10.440]  uh... tremendous crushing brutal economic austerity within the first twelve months
[2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:14.800]  and that an international confrontation probably with false flag or some form of
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:16.960]  aggression in the first six months
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:20.920]  secondly anybody who voted for the bailout has to be punished you got a vote
[2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:23.000]  against any elected official
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:26.280]  who supported that bailout obama of course was the one who uh...
[2:01:26.280 --> 2:01:29.400]  who organized the whole black caucus with a conference call to uh...
[2:01:29.400 --> 2:01:30.880]  to switch their votes into it
[2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:34.640]  mccain i think that related because he did a lot of republicans
[2:01:34.640 --> 2:01:37.720]  who were against it you remember in the house it was stopped for the first time
[2:01:37.720 --> 2:01:38.480]  around
[2:01:38.480 --> 2:01:41.800]  with uh... with quite a few republican votes the third one
[2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:44.000]  you gotta come out of this with gridlocked
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.200]  no one party state
[2:01:46.200 --> 2:01:50.240]  we do not want the president see the senate and the house of representatives
[2:01:50.240 --> 2:01:51.920]  in the hands of the same people
[2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:54.240]  the monstrosities of the bush era
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:57.640]  are largely in the period of one party republican rule
[2:01:57.640 --> 2:02:01.480]  which is from about uh... january of two thousand and three
[2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:05.160]  to about january of two thousand and seven that's the republican
[2:02:05.160 --> 2:02:08.240]  one party state and that's what gets you the iraq war
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:09.920]  and a lot of other things uh...
[2:02:09.920 --> 2:02:10.720]  going with it
[2:02:10.720 --> 2:02:13.080]  as part of the third parties go
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:14.520]  uh... sent the mckinney
[2:02:14.520 --> 2:02:18.520]  roza clemente is somebody that i've known from forecasting in new york city
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:21.920]  uh... she needs to develop a much more aggressive critique
[2:02:21.920 --> 2:02:25.840]  of obama she could be very very effective nader has probably attacked
[2:02:25.840 --> 2:02:27.360]  obama more
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:31.600]  than others of the idea that obama betrayed the black community doesn't
[2:02:31.600 --> 2:02:34.120]  care about them uses them
[2:02:34.120 --> 2:02:37.640]  uh... bob bars running mate wane uh... route
[2:02:37.640 --> 2:02:41.160]  is somebody who graduated from columbia nineteen eighty three
[2:02:41.160 --> 2:02:45.600]  and point out that he was in the same year and the same department is obama
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:49.480]  at columbia college and nobody ever heard of obama there's no sign that
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:53.080]  obama ever attended columbia during those years this is the
[2:02:53.080 --> 2:02:56.120]  the big mystery i think that's when he was recruited by uh...
[2:02:56.120 --> 2:02:57.600]  by brisinski
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:01.360]  if you're a state where where it's clear that it's going to go one way or
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:03.880]  another if you're in a state like uh...
[2:03:03.880 --> 2:03:07.360]  you know i guess texas is pretty much uh... you know a lost cause
[2:03:07.360 --> 2:03:08.360]  for obama
[2:03:08.360 --> 2:03:10.200]  then you can you can think about
[2:03:10.200 --> 2:03:14.080]  uh... trying to make a statement with these third party votes you got to do
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:18.360]  what's congenial for you and some people obviously uh... you know i want to
[2:03:18.360 --> 2:03:19.320]  support them
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:20.400]  and maybe out of that
[2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:24.000]  but some of these third parties can come up with a permanent infrastructure
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.920]  and some government funding that would be a good thing
[2:03:26.920 --> 2:03:28.720]  yeah i mean obviously i mean
[2:03:28.720 --> 2:03:30.720]  the way i look at it look in new york
[2:03:30.720 --> 2:03:35.160]  they're gonna vote obama no matter what i i i i i don't see mccain getting the
[2:03:35.160 --> 2:03:36.600]  you know new york vote
[2:03:36.600 --> 2:03:40.040]  i'm going third party and i hope other people in new york vote third party as
[2:03:40.040 --> 2:03:43.080]  well i mean new york it can show there's a lot of changes in california
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:45.960]  is the same way i mean that's going obama i mean you don't think that john
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:48.920]  mccain has a shot neither of those two states no but this is a very very
[2:03:48.920 --> 2:03:52.680]  close election and i i i do believe that any place any place we have blue
[2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:54.000]  color workers they
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:57.440]  the thing the group that's undercounted of the pulma democrats
[2:03:57.440 --> 2:03:58.520]  the uh...
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:02.960]  the reagan democrats the hillary clinton democrats it's about twenty five percent
[2:04:02.960 --> 2:04:06.280]  of of uh... the democratic party who uh...
[2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:09.160]  you know just they will not vote for obama and i think that's going to be a
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:10.360]  surprise
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:13.720]  the whole appellation area in particular is
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:17.800]  fundamentally hostile to obama because they have a class instinct they can see
[2:04:17.800 --> 2:04:22.440]  that obama is a class enemy he's somebody who's coming to impose
[2:04:22.440 --> 2:04:25.840]  crushing austerity in the name of the wall street banks
[2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:28.400]  he's an elitist he's an oligarch
[2:04:28.400 --> 2:04:32.400]  uh... he's a puppet he has no life of his own everything that he's got it
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:34.920]  been given to him by these bankers

[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:26.040]  we're discussing the bailout the elections you know webster's books
[2:08:26.040 --> 2:08:30.600]  obama the post a modern coup and what is the obama the presidency h2o what was
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:36.960]  it i'm sorry man what is it obama h obama the unauthorized biography the
[2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:41.240]  unauthorized biography kind of like your george bush unauthorized biography
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:44.760]  which is a tradition let me just add one quick thing you know one person from
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:49.440]  the nine eleven truth movement who has i think completely understood the profound
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:54.040]  change the phase change that we've gone through is phil berg and phil berg i'd
[2:08:54.040 --> 2:08:57.760]  believe will be at the supreme court here in washington the united states
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:02.040]  supreme court uh... attempting to argue his case which uh... has been uh...
[2:09:02.040 --> 2:09:05.480]  defeated in the appealing it right yeah this is an appeal it's a direct
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:07.240]  interlocutor appeal
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:11.680]  to the supreme's uh... that obama is not a natural born citizen that he was in
[2:09:11.680 --> 2:09:16.840]  effect born in kenya and naturalized as a citizen of indonesia making him an
[2:09:16.840 --> 2:09:20.240]  illegal alien and people who were concerned about illegal aliens better
[2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:24.800]  start with this one or it's it's going to be a lost cause uh... any other way
[2:09:24.800 --> 2:09:28.400]  soap soap berg is waging a valiant struggle and i i i heard people to
[2:09:28.400 --> 2:09:30.120]  support him he's got a website
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:31.840]  called obama crimes
[2:09:31.840 --> 2:09:35.240]  and uh... you can go there and give him a contribution encourage him
[2:09:35.240 --> 2:09:39.480]  uh... he's gotten tremendous uh... media impact he's got uh...
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:43.040]  seventy to eighty million hit on this website in about two months
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:45.200]  and this is an example of somebody
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:47.840]  who learned the lesson of nine eleven which is
[2:09:47.840 --> 2:09:49.680]  covert operations
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:51.760]  by the intelligence agencies
[2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:56.280]  designed to manipulate public opinion are bad whether they're left uh... left
[2:09:56.280 --> 2:09:58.960]  cover like obama or the right wing
[2:09:58.960 --> 2:10:02.480]  uh... racist uh... war on terror stuff from nine eleven
[2:10:02.480 --> 2:10:05.880]  not to get off on a tangent before we go into calls but you uh... just meant
[2:10:05.880 --> 2:10:07.200]  mention the uh...
[2:10:07.200 --> 2:10:10.040]  kenya citizenship thing do you think that's something that might come out
[2:10:10.040 --> 2:10:13.440]  after this man is already president will like automatically amend the
[2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:14.560]  constitution
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:17.840]  no i think there are a lot of things that are held over obama's head for
[2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:20.540]  control in other words the whole redsco
[2:10:20.540 --> 2:10:22.040]  complex the whole
[2:10:22.040 --> 2:10:25.840]  sewer and and uh... and that's full of corruption
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:31.520]  with uh... tori redsco not coming out she alfamari these characters from uh...
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:34.400]  well from chicago but also from the eastern mediterranean they're all
[2:10:34.400 --> 2:10:35.360]  levitating
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:40.040]  uh... arabs uh... that he's uh... obama's got these three convicted felons
[2:10:40.040 --> 2:10:41.360]  that it was godfather's
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:44.040]  i'm sure that the feds could indict obama
[2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:45.120]  at any time
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:48.240]  but they're holding that over his head if if people are interested in in the
[2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:50.440]  obama the unauthorized biography
[2:10:50.440 --> 2:10:53.960]  i do that a comparison to harry s truman who was controlled
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:56.560]  among other things in the same way with room it was that
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:58.200]  the pendergast machine
[2:10:58.200 --> 2:10:59.880]  in missouri that he came out of
[2:10:59.880 --> 2:11:02.140]  proven could have been indicted at any point
[2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:06.040]  that the uh... that the bankers decided that he wasn't they wasn't obeying them
[2:11:06.040 --> 2:11:08.880]  and obama will be the same story i'd rather think that the
[2:11:08.880 --> 2:11:12.920]  the hope of the ruling elite is to keep the citizenship issue as yet another
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:17.480]  means to beat him over the head if he starts getting rambunctious in office
[2:11:17.480 --> 2:11:20.480]  all right let's go to callers let's uh... let's take air and in california
[2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:22.000]  and are you with us
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.480]  uh... yeah i think the web service
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:25.840]  uh... just want to
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:30.080]  talk about uh... you know michelle obama which he gave that big speech which is
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:31.880]  where that keel shirt of some type
[2:11:31.880 --> 2:11:33.720]  right back in the middle of her shirt was a
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:34.920]  sun symbol
[2:11:34.920 --> 2:11:37.080]  sure enough today on the drug report
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:39.040]  uh... there's a picture of her from yesterday
[2:11:39.040 --> 2:11:40.640]  uh... on
[2:11:40.640 --> 2:11:44.120]  jay Leno or maybe a few days ago and sure enough she's got a sun symbol right
[2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:46.240]  on her shirt i mean is that a coincidence because
[2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:48.520]  i don't think so
[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:52.040]  you know i'll say this you know that their cfr they're obviously globalist
[2:11:52.040 --> 2:11:54.120]  they're obviously you know
[2:11:54.120 --> 2:11:56.840]  social climbers as well are they into the occult
[2:11:56.840 --> 2:11:59.440]  i don't know i mean i don't know if they go to bohemian grove i don't know
[2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:01.240]  how seriously they would take that
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:04.880]  if they did i haven't seen a whole lot of evidence but it does follow suit it
[2:12:04.880 --> 2:12:05.880]  does seem like
[2:12:05.880 --> 2:12:09.440]  a lot of the upper echelon elites do get into that sort of things so is it a
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:11.320]  possibility yet is yes
[2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:12.800]  is it a probability
[2:12:12.800 --> 2:12:16.440]  you know let me weigh in with some evidence with the big big big people
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:20.680]  this is the deployment of the trilateral builder bergrand
[2:12:20.680 --> 2:12:24.080]  uh... chicago school right now in other words this is what
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:25.280]  the trilateral
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:27.840]  and builder burgers are doing right now
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:32.120]  in our time it's not somebody else is that it's not like they want mccain or
[2:12:32.120 --> 2:12:35.200]  hillary clinton or you know john edwards it's it's
[2:12:35.200 --> 2:12:38.080]  it's the people who are the prime deployment now
[2:12:38.080 --> 2:12:41.400]  that thing i suppose that's the old soul and victor smithra
[2:12:41.400 --> 2:12:42.600]  from the uh...
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:44.160]  from the busy teen empire
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:46.880]  the other thing you've got to see about these people is the foundation
[2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:48.960]  milieu haven't talked about that enough
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:52.280]  the mother of obama worked for the ford foundation top official
[2:12:52.280 --> 2:12:55.680]  obama's whole life is working for foundations the joys
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:13:01.240]  the camellia the woods the annenberg his friend the weatherman terrorist bomber
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:05.160]  killer butcher cop killer bill ares
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:08.640]  you've got all sorts of money from the annenberg foundation came to millions of
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:09.480]  dollars
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:13.560]  burning door another weatherman terrorist butcher cop killer
[2:13:13.560 --> 2:13:17.160]  uh... it comes with money from the mccArthur foundation
[2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:18.320]  how does this happen
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:22.040]  well my explanation is having known these people i knew them
[2:13:22.040 --> 2:13:25.020]  personally at least from a distance in in sd s
[2:13:25.020 --> 2:13:29.460]  forty years ago those were always agents they were always operatives
[2:13:29.460 --> 2:13:31.400]  uh... they were foundation funded
[2:13:31.400 --> 2:13:33.900]  terrorists in the middle nineteen sixties
[2:13:33.900 --> 2:13:36.120]  uh... and all barbara has bought into this
[2:13:36.120 --> 2:13:38.040]  mentality in other words with obama
[2:13:38.040 --> 2:13:41.160]  you are in effect putting a weatherman terrorist
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:43.440]  into the white house or someone who thinks
[2:13:43.440 --> 2:13:44.800]  like a weatherman
[2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:49.160]  terrorist because as far as i can see bill ares is the guy's best friend and
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:52.920]  that represents a very very personal choice for him
[2:13:52.920 --> 2:13:57.920]  all right let's jump to daniel in california daniel what's on your mind
[2:13:57.920 --> 2:13:59.960]  uh... you know that
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:04.680]  yes jason uh... first time caller and i wanted to uh... bring up the uh...
[2:14:04.680 --> 2:14:10.440]  subject on the wide obama supporters are so further over obama
[2:14:10.440 --> 2:14:12.800]  okay um...
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:17.360]  basically i thought uh... found a pretty plausible theory as to uh... why
[2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:20.840]  that's the case uh...
[2:14:20.840 --> 2:14:23.840]  basically uh... he uses uh...
[2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:28.000]  hidden or covert hypnosis techniques in the speeches
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:29.080]  he uses it
[2:14:29.080 --> 2:14:33.280]  let me say this before we get into like hypnosis and thing like that
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:34.080]  people
[2:14:34.080 --> 2:14:37.400]  or a and speak a certain way they move their hands are there's a guy on the
[2:14:37.400 --> 2:14:39.200]  uk that does a show
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:43.040]  uh... it's not david blana stuff his name is darren brown it's more
[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:45.400]  how the mind works how you're able to
[2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:47.040]  plant certain words
[2:14:47.040 --> 2:14:51.040]  uh... so you know certain part of the brain activate to move a certain manner
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:52.800]  and these people are especially
[2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:56.440]  uh... you know agents that are recruited by intelligence organizations like the
[2:14:56.440 --> 2:15:00.160]  cia and the nsa when they're going to be speakers are taught these
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:01.120]  techniques
[2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:02.560]  that are there
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:07.200]  to basically corral people to convince them to persuade them to do things in
[2:15:07.200 --> 2:15:08.520]  that correct webster
[2:15:08.520 --> 2:15:12.680]  yet uh... in particular though that there's also the the emotional need in
[2:15:12.680 --> 2:15:13.640]  other words
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:17.480]  when somebody joins what amounts to a fascist mass movement or neofascist
[2:15:17.480 --> 2:15:19.520]  mass movement of the obama type
[2:15:19.520 --> 2:15:23.920]  they're doing this for the satisfaction of immediate emotional needs in effect
[2:15:23.920 --> 2:15:29.120]  they want to be duped part of it is the hatred for bush cheney in the neocons
[2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:32.240]  which i can understand which i get in some ways i share
[2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:35.480]  has blinded people and that's where you have to part company
[2:15:35.480 --> 2:15:40.240]  if they've lost all criteria of judgment as long as you're something other than
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:43.720]  bush cheney there's also this question of alienation
[2:15:43.720 --> 2:15:46.520]  uh... the previous caller mentioned michelle obama
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:50.360]  the centerpiece of michelle obama speeches during the primaries was
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:53.360]  this stuff about our souls are broken
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:58.280]  we all have broken souls we need the healing touch of the beatific
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:04.360]  uh... personality the one the messiah the mochi uh... barack obama
[2:16:04.360 --> 2:16:08.640]  there's a there's a passage in mind comp by hitler where he talks about the fact
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:12.440]  that if you're a worker and you're in your factory you're living in alienated
[2:16:12.440 --> 2:16:16.920]  life when nothing really belongs to you emotionally but if you go to a national
[2:16:16.920 --> 2:16:22.480]  socialist rally then you feel fulfilled nationally racially and all these other
[2:16:22.480 --> 2:16:26.960]  ways and it's a very similar dynamic in these obama mass meetings right the
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:33.280]  fact that he he he prefers stadiums he prefers large crowds again read mine
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:38.800]  comp hitler says the bigger the crowd the more easy it is to control the more
[2:16:38.800 --> 2:16:42.640]  people that are there the more you can brainwash them and the more
[2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:46.880]  undifferentiated in other words what you want is the messy mass not people who
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:51.880]  were there as consumers or workers or housewives but just the mass and when
[2:16:51.880 --> 2:16:56.720]  you've got the mass especially at night he says at night is better because people
[2:16:56.720 --> 2:17:00.840]  are more irrational then you can get them in the palm of your hand and you're
[2:17:00.840 --> 2:17:04.000]  you're not convincing them with arguments you're convincing them with an
[2:17:04.000 --> 2:17:07.840]  emotional experience which is irrefutable and i like the hive like
[2:17:07.840 --> 2:17:11.320]  mentality of being around all these things and just going with the flow
[2:17:11.320 --> 2:17:14.760]  yeah but it's dangerous that was when you get a mass movement of this sort
[2:17:14.760 --> 2:17:19.120]  under depression conditions after all the tremendous damage done to the society
[2:17:19.120 --> 2:17:23.520]  by bush and cheney this is where it gets really really scary what we need to
[2:17:23.520 --> 2:17:27.680]  sometime to build an alternative right now this tremendous confusion uh...
[2:17:27.680 --> 2:17:32.400]  right now people say oh i want the austrian school i want the free market
[2:17:32.400 --> 2:17:35.840]  uh... that this is impossible in the depression i'd i'd advocate
[2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:39.440]  return to new deal method they work before they will work now but it's going
[2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:42.840]  to take a discussion process to get people to understand this and they're
[2:17:42.840 --> 2:17:46.520]  also going to have to see in the course of this depred depression that uh...
[2:17:46.520 --> 2:17:50.480]  a lot of that that the free market freedom night from hyac Austrian school
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:53.480]  simply doesn't work but right now the main thing is
[2:17:53.480 --> 2:17:55.560]  to stop obama so that you have
[2:17:55.560 --> 2:17:58.960]  at least a breathing space to try to get some kind of an alternative
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:00.800]  together which you don't have right now
[2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:03.240]  we were just talking about schools of philosophy so i
[2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:04.480]  just gotta ask you
[2:18:04.480 --> 2:18:06.800]  have you seen the zeitgeist agenda yet
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:10.720]  i'm not interested in this stuff because of this vulgar attack on religion
[2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:14.320]  which i think is is just useless and and uh... and pointless
[2:18:14.320 --> 2:18:17.600]  you gotta remember the british intelligence is running a huge attack on
[2:18:17.600 --> 2:18:18.720]  christianity
[2:18:18.720 --> 2:18:20.840]  with uh... christopher hitchhens
[2:18:20.840 --> 2:18:25.200]  with this awful darwinian character docking to get docking to go to the
[2:18:25.200 --> 2:18:27.680]  military imperialist
[2:18:27.680 --> 2:18:31.840]  i mean just the the most of this kind of stuff out there to ben stein just put
[2:18:31.840 --> 2:18:34.800]  out a movie called expelled the case for intelligent design where he takes
[2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:37.600]  docking to others on pretty hardcore he talks about
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:40.160]  social darwinism yeah yeah you can actually have
[2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:44.800]  here's here's the problem we live in a black mitsian least action universe
[2:18:44.800 --> 2:18:48.320]  that was the problem with darwin and the problem with malphos and anybody who
[2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:49.400]  follows them
[2:18:49.400 --> 2:18:53.100]  is that it seems that the the universe is entirely random
[2:18:53.100 --> 2:18:56.520]  and that it's a matter of indifference whether there's development or higher
[2:18:56.520 --> 2:19:00.720]  energy states or whether there's not so therefore darwin has to assume
[2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:04.560]  that all the the the the progress in evolution which undoubtedly is there
[2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:07.560]  there's no doubt about evolution and the progress
[2:19:07.560 --> 2:19:11.840]  towards towards humanity from from lower life forms that's all clear
[2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:15.960]  but he says this is the blind watchmaker this is all a matter of of
[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:20.400]  dischance interaction and it could happen or it could not happen no
[2:19:20.400 --> 2:19:24.840]  it's wrong the darwinian malphosian universe is not the universe that you
[2:19:24.840 --> 2:19:25.520]  see
[2:19:25.520 --> 2:19:28.880]  the universe that you see is a gut-free villiam leibniz
[2:19:28.880 --> 2:19:32.400]  least action universe where there is if you will
[2:19:32.400 --> 2:19:37.520]  a built-in bias in the physical order of things in favor of development and
[2:19:37.520 --> 2:19:40.040]  higher energy states that's what you see
[2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:42.040]  well you don't need one more segment with us
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:44.560]  can you stay one more segment with us?

[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:10.440]  a survival retreat is a place you go to live not die
[2:20:10.440 --> 2:20:13.640]  it is a place out of the mainstream of events that contains the means to
[2:20:13.640 --> 2:20:15.880]  survive without outside support
[2:20:15.880 --> 2:20:17.680]  a place where you find shelter

[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:31.280]  why retreat?
[2:20:31.280 --> 2:20:34.440]  this is a question that ninety percent of our population cannot

[2:20:35.800 --> 2:20:36.800]  if they could
[2:20:36.800 --> 2:20:40.280]  that same ninety percent would have to admit that things may not continue on
[2:20:40.280 --> 2:20:41.640]  as they are now
[2:20:41.640 --> 2:20:44.400]  they would also have to admit that they will need a retreat

[2:21:39.200 --> 2:21:43.040]  current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set
[2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:45.920]  the stage for the united states to be the next target

[2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:26.400]  physically just like the old card the difference is an RFID chip hidden inside

[2:24:36.760 --> 2:24:38.600]  really goes into the intelligence ties
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:40.680]  behind 9-11 it really lets you
[2:24:40.680 --> 2:24:44.000]  understand this international intelligence cartel so i encourage
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:47.400]  people to grab that right now we're finishing up with WebsterTarley we've
[2:24:47.400 --> 2:24:49.080]  talked the bailout we've talked
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:51.240]  Obama the postmodern coup the new
[2:24:51.240 --> 2:24:55.120]  Obama unauthorized biography you can get that over at amazon.com we're taking
[2:24:55.120 --> 2:24:55.880]  your calls
[2:24:55.880 --> 2:25:00.560]  so let's jump to Kevin in Boston Kevin what's on your mind
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:04.440]  thank you Jason for taking my call uh... Webster I respect your research and
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:06.480]  your uh... the books
[2:25:06.480 --> 2:25:09.920]  and i agree with you that we want no obama punish those who voted for the bailout
[2:25:09.920 --> 2:25:12.280]  and no to fascism but i think the
[2:25:12.280 --> 2:25:16.480]  suggestion that uh... by voting for mccain is going to be anything but obama
[2:25:16.480 --> 2:25:17.480]  is just
[2:25:17.480 --> 2:25:22.080]  falling into the false uh... left-right dialectic you know of uh... paradigm
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:25.520]  left-right paradigm that both candidates are puppets of the new world order
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:28.200]  chuck baldwin whether he gets in or gets not your least your voting for
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:31.680]  something that's not going to be more the same where there is no
[2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:35.280]  well obama is it is going to be defeated not going to be a difference they're
[2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:36.360]  going to be the same
[2:25:36.360 --> 2:25:39.400]  uh... the idea that the big deal with it the new deal worked
[2:25:39.400 --> 2:25:43.000]  as an answer to the economic problem the path i think it's a fallacy uh... if we
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:44.480]  just simply end the fed
[2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:47.680]  uh... and with something interested for use of our own money that that would be
[2:25:47.680 --> 2:25:48.320]  an answer
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:52.200]  and i think there's a book um... dan hopsiker wrote that had a uh... called
[2:25:52.200 --> 2:25:55.960]  barry and the boys to see i a the mob and america secret history had a
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:25:57.160]  picture in the photo
[2:25:57.160 --> 2:26:02.360]  uh... on the cover of uh... barry field cia drug pilot that uh...
[2:26:02.360 --> 2:26:06.160]  they were within mexico prior to the jfk assassination
[2:26:06.160 --> 2:26:10.200]  uh... he seated with portagos and several other uh... well-known cia agents
[2:26:10.200 --> 2:26:13.600]  portagos of course was named a director cia by bush
[2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:17.320]  in the big deal people connect to clinton's and the bush is uh... right up
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:20.760]  through your point sir is that this thing continues that this live i have
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:24.320]  been has been around for you know thirty or forty years at least at least this
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:28.120]  one top of the the bush regime in the shadow government continuity a
[2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:30.520]  government program and you don't think it's going to end right
[2:26:30.520 --> 2:26:34.600]  yeah it is to say no will bomb anything will bomb as if that is any sort of an
[2:26:34.600 --> 2:26:38.440]  answer misses the point of all this week all right kevin it's a good call i got
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:41.840]  to give him a chance to respond there's something about of a counter movement
[2:26:41.840 --> 2:26:44.360]  inside the democratic party at the pooma
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:47.840]  the pooma democrats you can go to uh... pooma's unleashed
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:49.400]  just say no deal
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:53.680]  there's a whole complex of fact they vary in political quality quite obviously
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:57.560]  but it is essentially the backlash out of the democratic party against the
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:26:58.480]  obama
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:26:59.720]  howard dean
[2:26:59.720 --> 2:27:01.200]  seizure of power
[2:27:01.200 --> 2:27:05.240]  and one of the benefits here is that there's an openness to new deal now
[2:27:05.240 --> 2:27:08.080]  this uh... candidate that you've mentioned
[2:27:08.080 --> 2:27:10.200]  uh... the problem there of course is
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:14.240]  that this is pure reactionary republican herbert hoover
[2:27:14.240 --> 2:27:17.960]  economics this is the kind of thinking that made the great depression
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:23.360]  as deep and as destructive as it was there is no debate really about what
[2:27:23.360 --> 2:27:27.840]  effective economics are it's new deal economics if you're in a depression
[2:27:27.840 --> 2:27:31.440]  you better get new deal economics up and down the line that would be let's let's
[2:27:31.440 --> 2:27:34.000]  get beyond that we only have a couple minutes i want to know what you think
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:37.200]  about his power structure comment that these guys have really i think this is
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:40.960]  i think this is misleading in other words it's clear that wall street has a
[2:27:40.960 --> 2:27:45.640]  very strong decided preference if you don't know that wall street the enemy
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:49.040]  that's the problem a lot of libertarians think that government is their main
[2:27:49.040 --> 2:27:53.920]  enemy i think that's extremely foolish government is dominated by wall street
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:57.120]  if you look at of you know look at somebody like green span is that the
[2:27:57.120 --> 2:28:00.960]  federal reserve is an independent power not that they are but aren't they in
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:04.480]  essence their operational arm their think tank arm where a lot of their
[2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:08.320]  i don't know what it comes down to and a lot of this is people looking for
[2:28:08.320 --> 2:28:11.760]  reasons not to mobilize essentially to do nothing
[2:28:11.760 --> 2:28:15.680]  and to uh... said to say well uh... i'll just vote for this one
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:18.880]  third-party candidate and leave it at that that's really
[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:22.240]  choosing uh... i think i have a very uh... facile
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:25.760]  way out of it i was going to get another call that i let's jump to uh... john
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:28.640]  ohio john what's on your mind
[2:28:28.640 --> 2:28:32.640]  johnny with me yes i agree with uh... very much of uh... well the valuable
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:36.800]  things that uh... partly saying uh... i really appreciate it but uh... i think
[2:28:36.800 --> 2:28:40.000]  uh... my approach would be uh... that uh... we have to show
[2:28:40.000 --> 2:28:43.760]  the overlap because between these neocon fascist to uh...
[2:28:43.760 --> 2:28:48.000]  of the bush cheney uh... group the mccain group and uh... the old obama
[2:28:48.000 --> 2:28:51.360]  because uh... i i think you know if i'm a vote for somebody is going to be
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:56.160]  from a genuine left at w-s-w-s dot org or workers or type of uh...
[2:28:56.160 --> 2:28:59.760]  real left a point of view uh... the fake left uh...
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:03.840]  it has been the favorite of the c-i-a all the way back to the vietnam war
[2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:07.120]  where they prefer to have a fake liberal cover
[2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:11.200]  on right wing propaganda anti-communist pro-war v pro
[2:29:11.200 --> 2:29:15.040]  vietnam war propaganda but i'd like to say though
[2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:18.640]  what i'd like to say though is that i think we can show the overlap
[2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:24.000]  between i'd compare obama's reality he is every bit as much of a war monger
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:28.160]  and then some as a bush and cheney around the world i gotta let you go john i
[2:29:28.160 --> 2:29:30.800]  gotta let you go finish up web sir i got about 20 seconds
[2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:34.640]  in other words the the new group around brzezinski and soros
[2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:38.480]  is worse because the neocons have the elementary
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:42.720]  cunning of a bully pick on defenseless countries with brzezinski you don't have
[2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:46.560]  that he's picking on russia and china he's picking on states that have all
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:50.000]  right i don't know i don't thank you so much for joining us
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:55.600]  obama the postmodern too we're on the march the empires on the run

[2:34:56.640 --> 2:35:00.400]  you're supposed to be retiring willy by the way he does one song after a good
[2:35:00.400 --> 2:35:03.200]  thing to give up he does one song after another too it's just
[2:35:03.200 --> 2:35:06.240]  painful you saw him this summer like i said i was at
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:09.440]  hinkley at the casino and willy played up there was great
[2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:12.640]  i gotta tell you know willy you need a new guitar
[2:35:12.640 --> 2:35:17.920]  well it's getting kind of holy yeah that guitar is right back there but i'm looking at that guitar
[2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:21.440]  and i'm going my god that's got to be willy's first guitar he's out there with
[2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:25.200]  look at that son of a gun it's wore out it's got a nice sound though
[2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:28.320]  it's got the best sound that's why you keep playing it sure
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:32.000]  but uh no i had the last he's the expert tributary i wasn't at that guitar and i
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:34.960]  says i'll bet you there i'd like to have that could do an interview with that
[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:37.360]  guitar i think you tell i gotta have to shoot it
[2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:41.520]  if there's one state in america that that embarrasses me and i hate to say it
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:45.840]  it's texas you know they're voting turnout i mean their
[2:35:45.840 --> 2:35:50.720]  last government election 26 percent of texans voted for their governor
[2:35:50.720 --> 2:35:54.000]  that's that's horrible well yeah it's embarrassing
[2:35:54.000 --> 2:35:57.920]  in your country and i think this year there's more reason to vote people will
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:02.160]  get up and vote against something yeah more than they will force well
[2:36:02.160 --> 2:36:05.600]  willy specifically this year they're voting against
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:10.720]  welly specifically you were talking about uh you were starting to allude to
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:14.480]  they went too far with 9-11 but in your own words because it has backfired with
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:17.760]  84 percent in in major polls believing they're being lied to about it
[2:36:17.760 --> 2:36:20.560]  and some polls about 60 leaving it's an inside job
[2:36:20.560 --> 2:36:23.680]  you know polls five years ago 36 saying inside job
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:27.280]  well wait a minute actually i gotta interject where are all these people i'm
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:32.000]  running into the opposite nobody wants everyone i run into does not believe
[2:36:32.000 --> 2:36:34.960]  but you're trying to talk to the government no no no even people on the
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:39.360]  street i got chewed out yesterday watching a football game when they asked
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:42.720]  me what i was doing i said i'm investigating 9-11 oh you're one of
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:46.000]  them crazies well i mean that's probably the regular people that's probably the
[2:36:46.000 --> 2:36:49.440]  time these were not these were not these were not people up in kyan
[2:36:49.440 --> 2:36:51.280]  government just ask me a question let me tell you
[2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:55.120]  okay angus and reid poll wall street journal poll 84 percent believe they've
[2:36:55.120 --> 2:36:58.160]  been lied to about the official story i can show you hundreds of polls
[2:36:58.160 --> 2:37:01.360]  all i know is i've done several thousand radio interviews
[2:37:01.360 --> 2:37:04.560]  where the talk show host is attacking me and almost every caller agrees with me
[2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:07.760]  let's ask willy willy what what response did you get from going public for
[2:37:07.760 --> 2:37:11.760]  9-11 truth well i had a lot of people that agreed with me
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:16.240]  and uh i had a lot of people that didn't uh i'd go on
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:20.800]  people shows like Amy Goodman she's uh you know she wanted to hear my views and
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:24.640]  her and a lot of her listeners agreed that there is something there
[2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:28.560]  there is things to be answered there are questions uh it's not a cutting-dried
[2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:32.160]  situation never was to me so is there a reason to
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:36.400]  investigate well yeah are there anything uh is there
[2:37:36.400 --> 2:37:39.840]  anything that they're trying to hide evidently or they talk to jesse
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:43.840]  well this is a paradox because because every i mean most people i run into
[2:37:43.840 --> 2:37:46.240]  you know privately you'll say oh no i don't know something's going on or even
[2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:50.000]  publicly now i do run into kind of the neocon 30 percent
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:55.360]  you know pro-war people and you're watching a football game aren't you
[2:37:55.360 --> 2:37:58.000]  and you know with that kind of and i'm not saying football but you know that
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:01.440]  particular group that's your Sean Hannity rush limbaugh
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:04.640]  no it isn't these are people i grew up with
[2:38:04.640 --> 2:38:08.880]  really he's a nut Sean Hannity and rush them all people well yes i was at a
[2:38:08.880 --> 2:38:12.640]  football i was at the golfer game watching it yesterday
[2:38:12.640 --> 2:38:17.440]  with some friends that i've known since i was in fifth grade
[2:38:17.440 --> 2:38:21.360]  and a few of them there when they asked me what i was doing now and i said i was
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:25.200]  investigating 9-11 they said you're not one of them
[2:38:25.200 --> 2:38:28.880]  crazies that thinks that there was da da da da da to it
[2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:33.200]  there's a certain percentage of people who will not believe that their government
[2:38:33.200 --> 2:38:36.640]  will do anything exactly you have a bigger percentage
[2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:38.800]  than how they're there that there are that certain
[2:38:38.800 --> 2:38:41.440]  print and they're bigger than they're bigger than you think
[2:38:41.440 --> 2:38:45.280]  but they will not believe that their government is capable of doing what we
[2:38:45.280 --> 2:38:49.280]  say it may or may not have happened exactly really
[2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:53.040]  is right on with that alex there is a print no i'm not saying there is this
[2:38:53.040 --> 2:38:56.480]  i'm not saying there is a bigger than my in-law like i told you
[2:38:56.480 --> 2:39:00.640]  about my in-laws they're elderly people i try to show them this
[2:39:00.640 --> 2:39:05.200]  they want nothing to do they will not they will not believe
[2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:09.200]  that our country the great country that they all served and went through
[2:39:09.200 --> 2:39:14.160]  world war two and all of this they will they refuse to believe
[2:39:14.160 --> 2:39:16.640]  i don't want to be able to be evil can't believe it
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:20.560]  well it is that myth and you can't if you're not going to change them i mean
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:24.080]  i've pleaded with them i said there's a lot of you are not going to change their
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:27.440]  mind they will not change their mind there's a lot of them that still
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:31.760]  love what's going on out there they love their war
[2:39:31.760 --> 2:39:35.200]  they don't know why mainly because they don't have any kids over there
[2:39:35.200 --> 2:39:38.320]  it's your kids and my kids well that's what i was going to say
[2:39:38.320 --> 2:39:43.200]  is that there is over 30 percent of the public still believes that wmd's were
[2:39:43.200 --> 2:39:45.600]  found and around 30 percent of the public believes
[2:39:45.600 --> 2:39:49.200]  Saddam Hussein carried out 9-11 so i would say it'd be
[2:39:49.200 --> 2:39:52.320]  higher than that probably i would say higher than that
[2:39:52.320 --> 2:39:55.840]  it was half they would higher than that it was 55 four years ago but now it's
[2:39:55.840 --> 2:40:00.000]  about 35 percent now 30 percent but that's what i'm saying
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:03.760]  is that you've got 30 percent that the wmd's were found they think Saddam
[2:40:03.760 --> 2:40:06.640]  carried out the attacks so i'm not saying governor
[2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:10.640]  that i don't understand that there's people out there but they're complete
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:13.760]  zombies living in total denial and we know who they are
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:17.600]  i don't care if they say wmd's were found i'm not going to agree with them
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:22.320]  because we know they're i mean it's delusional so yes you've got 30 percent
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:25.760]  that if they were told the moon was made out of cheese by George Bush they believe
[2:40:25.760 --> 2:40:29.840]  that so and you got because he's government and as long as the president
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:33.600]  says it's okay that's right it's true and you're not going to change those
[2:40:33.600 --> 2:40:36.720]  folks i can't believe it i'm actually ranting on
[2:40:36.720 --> 2:40:41.360]  willy nelson's bus i agree with willy that because my
[2:40:41.360 --> 2:40:46.480]  i love my mother and father law dearly and i respect them they're terrific people
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:51.440]  but they just will not accept that that our our government would be
[2:40:51.440 --> 2:40:55.680]  evil how do you get past that denial willy i mean how do you get folks to
[2:40:55.680 --> 2:40:57.680]  break out well some people break out of it i don't
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:01.760]  worry about it yeah go on with my thinking and my my job
[2:41:01.760 --> 2:41:06.160]  and let him live with their thoughts i don't have to be responsible for him
[2:41:06.160 --> 2:41:09.760]  yeah do you think the truth of 911 will ever officially come out like
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:13.120]  other things have i don't know the truth about john kennedy didn't come out or
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:15.920]  you know exactly i wanted to get you to talk about kennedy
[2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:19.520]  give a sure view on that i don't know what happened
[2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:23.840]  i don't know what happened at 911 i did know that a lot of investigations went
[2:41:23.840 --> 2:41:28.160]  on kennedy that uh that were stifled just like what you're doing now they tried
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:32.160]  to hold that back and uh you know we know he was killed we don't
[2:41:32.160 --> 2:41:36.240]  know who done it uh the other argument of 911 we know
[2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:39.280]  those buildings fail although a lot of people know it would
[2:41:39.280 --> 2:41:43.440]  think it was done this way we think it was blown up intentionally so
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:47.440]  we're never gonna be able to convince everybody and we're never gonna really
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:52.080]  know for sure no and willy's exactly right because
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:56.400]  the simple way they get to that is by the removal of all evidence all evidence
[2:41:56.400 --> 2:41:59.520]  is gone like when john kennedy was assassinated
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.160]  the first thing lyndon johnson did was he said that the limousine was where a
[2:42:04.160 --> 2:42:08.720]  homicide took place there should have been the yellow tape around that limo
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:12.320]  that limo shouldn't have been touched till investigators went through it with a
[2:42:12.320 --> 2:42:16.560]  fine tooth comb instead lbj orders it sent to
[2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:21.120]  Cincinnati it's cleaned and refurbished not one person got to look at the
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:25.840]  actual crime scene which is backwards to what normally is done that's what
[2:42:25.840 --> 2:42:29.520]  causes for me the light to go on because when
[2:42:29.520 --> 2:42:34.080]  they start doing a crime scene the exact opposite of the way it's
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:37.200]  supposed to be done that tells you that there's
[2:42:37.200 --> 2:42:41.760]  ulterior forces involved here now you shift to 911
[2:42:41.760 --> 2:42:46.320]  in 911 the high priority was removal of everything
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:51.040]  it was not investigating it there were people the priority went to the
[2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:55.120]  removal the investigators were considered secondary
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:59.200]  well that's the exact amount well that's the exact opposite of the way it
[2:42:59.200 --> 2:43:02.800]  should be hold off on my monsters that's the exact
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:07.680]  opposite of the way it should be the investigation should always take priority
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:12.080]  even if they use the excuse well we were searching for bodies there could
[2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:14.800]  have been alive people in there which you can accept
[2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:18.320]  it still doesn't still doesn't relieve them
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:22.640]  they could have removed that metal and put it somewhere to where later
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:26.240]  it could have been looked at and that's what we all assumed they were doing
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:29.280]  they were doing but it turned out they weren't doing that they were
[2:43:29.280 --> 2:43:33.200]  destroying it all they were building a new ship out of it as a monument they
[2:43:33.200 --> 2:43:36.640]  were selling it to china and melting it down and doing
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:40.080]  everything and so it's come down to today and willy's
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:45.120]  exactly correct we will never know because here's the reason
[2:43:45.120 --> 2:43:51.600]  now we're all experts and has with no evidence with no concrete scientific
[2:43:51.600 --> 2:43:55.680]  evidence to go to all of our opinions are valid
[2:43:55.680 --> 2:44:00.480]  whether they be for or against because there's no way they happen at the pentagon
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:04.080]  the very same thing happened they came in they cleaned up everything they took
[2:44:04.080 --> 2:44:08.480]  all the video cameras away and they dared anybody to say anything
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:12.640]  yeah and so now there's no way to prove or discipline well willy
[2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:15.920]  willy isn't that right there historically especially in a criminal
[2:44:15.920 --> 2:44:20.000]  investigation a cover-up is generally seen as an evidence
[2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:23.680]  of guilt or that there should be a massive investigation can you speak to
[2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:26.160]  that well i think that's true anytime you cover up
[2:44:26.160 --> 2:44:30.080]  evidence or take evidence away uh you have an agenda there you're
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:32.560]  trying to stop people from knowing what happened
[2:44:32.560 --> 2:44:36.080]  and i really do believe that's what happened so i think the cover-ups the
[2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:39.600]  biggest piece of evidence of that it isn't inside job
[2:44:39.600 --> 2:44:43.840]  that that certainly plays a huge role what's your take on
[2:44:43.840 --> 2:44:47.120]  how they block the funding for the firefighters and police and emergency
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:50.640]  workers from all that deadly dust why why wouldn't congress
[2:44:50.640 --> 2:44:54.720]  uh i mean we've been to congress have you know made a film about it
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:57.200]  uh and they they just say no we're not going to take care of even though all
[2:44:57.200 --> 2:45:00.960]  the CAT scans and hospitals hospitals say it's killing them
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:04.320]  and this firefighter uses a 600 number the official
[2:45:04.320 --> 2:45:07.520]  government it reports a few months ago
[2:45:07.520 --> 2:45:11.280]  say it's uh over 1100 of them
[2:45:11.280 --> 2:45:15.200]  well first of all there's a long list of things that
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:19.680]  we could talk about that we don't like about this government
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:26.240]  what it's doing and what it has done and uh it goes back
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:30.400]  further than the bush administration it goes all the way back to
[2:45:30.400 --> 2:45:35.520]  other administrations a long time ago when this country started going the
[2:45:35.520 --> 2:45:39.200]  wrong way and started doing things around the world
[2:45:39.200 --> 2:45:43.040]  thinking that we were the world's policeman and uh
[2:45:43.040 --> 2:45:48.560]  if also uh we were the world's resource gatherer if there was something
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:53.760]  over there you had we're gonna come get it uh we'll make you a deal you can't
[2:45:53.760 --> 2:45:57.040]  turn down so that's something going on as long as
[2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:00.320]  i can remember as long as i've been watching our government operate
[2:46:00.320 --> 2:46:03.600]  so this is just one more time i think that they're
[2:46:03.600 --> 2:46:08.480]  stepped over the line doing things as far as i'm concerned that's not what i
[2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:12.480]  heard them for they they work for me they work for you they work for jessie
[2:46:12.480 --> 2:46:15.840]  and they're screwing up well i think that like you said earlier the people
[2:46:15.840 --> 2:46:18.800]  are finally really getting fed up and i don't think they're gonna
[2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:23.040]  go back to sleep again i think i think the revolution's on
[2:46:23.040 --> 2:46:28.960]  well let me i do i don't think they're gonna go back to sleep
[2:46:28.960 --> 2:46:34.960]  well you can wait and go back to sleep we'll wake them up
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:38.640]  we'll wake them up but i i bet they go back to sleep again
[2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:42.320]  well willy what are you saying i mean i hope i'm wrong i talked
[2:46:42.320 --> 2:46:46.480]  i mean i know i just i believe some of them will go back to sleep because one
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:50.320]  of them didn't want to get woke up but there are
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:54.800]  a group of intelligent young people out there not
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:46:59.760]  very many of my age or your age most of the people my age or your age think
[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:04.960]  just exactly like what you said things are the way they are don't mess with them
[2:47:04.960 --> 2:47:08.240]  go do your job keep your head down you know
[2:47:08.240 --> 2:47:12.240]  don't stir up anything but there's some young people out there with a lot of
[2:47:12.240 --> 2:47:15.200]  guts a lot of balls they're going to stir it up
[2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:18.560]  and they're going to elect obama they're going to
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:21.760]  elect some government officials are going to elect some senators and
[2:47:21.760 --> 2:47:25.200]  congressmen who'll go in there and start doing the right thing
[2:47:25.200 --> 2:47:30.000]  for a while and then you're right in a little while everybody will go back to
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:33.280]  sleep and the guys will say all right we're gonna let them
[2:47:33.280 --> 2:47:37.200]  let them have it for four to eight years because look how we screwed it up
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:41.120]  let's back out out of the alloy and let them have our problems that we created
[2:47:41.120 --> 2:47:44.880]  for a while and we'll go over here and we'll reorganize
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:48.080]  and we'll think it over and we'll raise some more money and we'll go get it
[2:47:48.080 --> 2:47:53.200]  I agree fully because let's go let's go Alex we talked about history and how
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:57.600]  if you don't study history the old cliche you're deemed to repeat it
[2:47:57.600 --> 2:48:01.760]  well look at my generation and willies
[2:48:01.760 --> 2:48:06.560]  we're the generation of the 60s we were supposed to be the rebels we were
[2:48:06.560 --> 2:48:09.760]  supposed to be the ones who were anti-establishment
[2:48:09.760 --> 2:48:15.200]  the ones who learned from vietnam the ones that saw all this stuff go down
[2:48:15.200 --> 2:48:19.040]  and yet what has happened to all of us where did we all go
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:22.720]  I was so proud of the peaceniks I was so proud of the guys who got out there
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:26.320]  and fought against the war and to come home from vietnam and say
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:30.560]  hey that's wrong but they went back to sleep that's right
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:35.520]  what happened to peace on earth I remember growing up that that was what
[2:48:35.520 --> 2:48:38.720]  we were all taught was going to happen one day I go to church and they well
[2:48:38.720 --> 2:48:41.920]  you've got the prince of peace Jesus he's gonna come and there's going to be
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:46.160]  peace on earth for a thousand years I said I can't wait
[2:48:46.160 --> 2:48:50.480]  or is it but that's essentially the problem we can we do it and
[2:48:50.480 --> 2:48:54.240]  hopefully something will change but the problem is this
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:58.080]  everybody lives in their own little world and if their own little world is
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:02.320]  not effective directly they will ignore it but right now with the economy
[2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:06.080]  sinking yeah their world is affected I agree yeah and
[2:49:06.080 --> 2:49:10.000]  gasoline and they are affected they're gonna have to start growing their own
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:14.160]  vegetables again oh yeah that's great I'm glad to see
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:17.360]  them having to get out and dig in that soil and plant a seed
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:21.360]  and when you sit back and watch it grow but that's America
[2:49:21.360 --> 2:49:25.200]  and hard times of course where they've been is not American
[2:49:25.200 --> 2:49:29.440]  living on you know eight or ten houses and six yachts and
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:32.880]  going off and starting these big corporations where they screwed me and
[2:49:32.880 --> 2:49:36.800]  you out of money and they grew overseas and that's not America
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:41.120]  now I want to see one of those guys get out there and have to grow his own potatoes
[2:49:41.120 --> 2:49:45.120]  we have to stop electing Democrats and Republicans
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:49.120]  and we have to start electing and destroying the system they've created

[2:54:55.280 --> 2:55:00.560]  latest article where he really denounces the washington post i believe
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:04.960]  for their little editorial page all it looks like the war with iran is off the
[2:55:04.960 --> 2:55:09.360]  table with both us and israel how sad and he really goes over that how that's
[2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:11.760]  not a sad thing and he does hope it's the truth and i
[2:55:11.760 --> 2:55:16.000]  doesn't understand their attitude towards it but in this segment i want to uh
[2:55:16.000 --> 2:55:19.680]  i want to read this article out of the uh national post
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:23.360]  now this is a big uh paper out in canada
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:27.600]  and jonathan k i guess this uh guy writes for them for many years
[2:55:27.600 --> 2:55:31.760]  wrote something about the 9-11 truth movement and then he had to write this
[2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:35.760]  jonathan k on the humbling frustrations of debating 9-11 truthers
[2:55:35.760 --> 2:55:39.520]  want to fill up your inbox write a column announcing the 9-11 truth movement
[2:55:39.520 --> 2:55:42.960]  these are the people who dismissed the official 9-11 explanation as white
[2:55:42.960 --> 2:55:46.560]  house pebble on one truth or sec believes the american government or rogue
[2:55:46.560 --> 2:55:48.960]  elements within it plan the september 11th attacks
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:52.240]  under a false flag another concedes al-qaeda's involvement
[2:55:52.240 --> 2:55:55.920]  but insists the plot was known to the warmongering bush administration
[2:55:55.920 --> 2:55:59.440]  other truthers favor more exotic explanations featuring missiles remote
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:03.200]  controlled airliners the massage mini nukes and even space weapons
[2:56:03.200 --> 2:56:06.560]  what they all have in common i've learned is a hate on for journalists who
[2:56:06.560 --> 2:56:10.960]  blindly dismissed them as nutbars as i did a few weeks ago in a blog post
[2:56:10.960 --> 2:56:14.160]  about ex-liberal candidate and unapologetic unapologetic
[2:56:14.160 --> 2:56:18.000]  truther leslie hughes normally i confess these are the sort of
[2:56:18.000 --> 2:56:20.880]  correspondence i delete from my inbox without much guilt
[2:56:20.880 --> 2:56:24.000]  as with the conspiracy with all conspiracy theorists see this is what i
[2:56:24.000 --> 2:56:27.360]  don't like debate is pointless since they have no chance of convincing me
[2:56:27.360 --> 2:56:31.520]  nor i them why waste my time parsing their arguments but see he admits he won't
[2:56:31.520 --> 2:56:35.280]  be swayed no matter what but something about the truth or email i got aroused
[2:56:35.280 --> 2:56:38.480]  my interest for one thing there was a lot of it
[2:56:38.480 --> 2:56:41.520]  which perhaps should not surprise me as the post adrian
[2:56:41.520 --> 2:56:44.640]  uh... home freeze reported last week thirty nine percent of canadiens either
[2:56:44.640 --> 2:56:47.760]  reject or doubt the official explanation
[2:56:47.760 --> 2:56:51.520]  for the nine eleven attacks that's forty percent that's four in ten
[2:56:51.520 --> 2:56:56.240]  that's a major thing in camp that major secondly many of these messages a majority
[2:56:56.240 --> 2:57:00.160]  in fact were lucid and coherent well-written even
[2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:03.760]  some of the centers have letters after their names and even email addresses
[2:57:03.760 --> 2:57:07.840]  contain the donate domain names of recognizable universities
[2:57:07.840 --> 2:57:11.440]  conspiracy sit theorists they may be but they're certainly not subhuman
[2:57:11.440 --> 2:57:14.480]  readers who try to convince me the holocaust never happened nor the
[2:57:14.480 --> 2:57:17.760]  anti-sash social paranormal acts who send me weekly updates about their
[2:57:17.760 --> 2:57:21.120]  decade-long litigation campaign against their ex landlords
[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:24.480]  so i like that to you at least admits you know
[2:57:24.480 --> 2:57:28.000]  we we have a uh... standing thirdly they have a point
[2:57:28.000 --> 2:57:31.440]  something that hit home when i read this stinging comment in a message from
[2:57:31.440 --> 2:57:35.600]  winnipeg area writer dallas hanson take a look at the amount of evidence
[2:57:35.600 --> 2:57:38.400]  suggesting a blackout i'm sure you're a smart guy
[2:57:38.400 --> 2:57:41.600]  but posturing is though that you've got all the answers to nine eleven and if
[2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:44.240]  aming those who question the explanation we've been given
[2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:48.400]  is a little much september eleventh wasn't a black op
[2:57:48.400 --> 2:57:52.400]  but hanson is right that like mainstream journalists i overplay my
[2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:55.920]  intellectual hand when it comes to nine eleven and just about everything else
[2:57:55.920 --> 2:57:58.880]  besides i could lie to mr. hanson and my readers
[2:57:58.880 --> 2:58:02.000]  and tell them i've read the u.s. government's 571 page
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:05.520]  nine eleven commission report or popular mechanics magazine authority
[2:58:05.520 --> 2:58:09.600]  report on debunking the nine eleven myths but the truth is that i haven't
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:13.200]  i never felt the need to because i'm a purely instinctive level
[2:58:13.200 --> 2:58:16.880]  i've always believed the truthers case was complete nonsense
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:19.760]  but he cops to it and he says he's gonna read those things while i sent him an
[2:58:19.760 --> 2:58:23.120]  email urging him to watch fabled enemies and then the
[2:58:23.120 --> 2:58:25.840]  loose chain series and i hope you help me out and do the same i'd like to see

[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:35.120]  what's on your mind
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:38.320]  yeah i don't know good yeah i wanted to speak
[3:01:38.320 --> 3:01:42.240]  so i really was calling to speak to your last guest but i'm gonna speak on
[3:01:42.240 --> 3:01:45.440]  some of the points that he made from the back of the brocco bomber
[3:01:45.440 --> 3:01:50.240]  okay first i want to talk about him um saying that while later
[3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:52.880]  we're stepping up and the brocco bomber
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:55.920]  is through in the black community and things like that
[3:01:55.920 --> 3:02:00.560]  the first thing about that i want to say is a lot later that doesn't speak up
[3:02:00.560 --> 3:02:05.280]  anytime when issues go on in the black community and injustice is done by
[3:02:05.280 --> 3:02:07.920]  people in this country i've never heard a lot better speaker
[3:02:07.920 --> 3:02:11.040]  well he's a bit of a gun grabber i'll give him that i mean he always talks
[3:02:11.040 --> 3:02:14.080]  about it you know against automatic weapons in inner cities and stuff like
[3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:17.600]  that i'm not really for that so i mean i feel like that's a foreign you know a
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:20.000]  form of gun control it's kind of soft but continue
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:23.440]  well i mean i'm well i'm gonna speak of black i'm black so i'm gonna tell you
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:26.560]  like some of it i don't know what's going on but some of the things are going
[3:02:26.560 --> 3:02:30.560]  like with the juniors six son bale killing and just all kind of just
[3:02:30.560 --> 3:02:34.160]  so are you going for barack let me let me finish sure i've never heard him
[3:02:34.160 --> 3:02:37.440]  speak up and he's been on al sarkin so so it's like he's not like he hasn't
[3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:41.280]  had a chance to speak on those things but when he's all al sarkin so and that's
[3:02:41.280 --> 3:02:44.960]  about as much in the black community as as much as
[3:02:44.960 --> 3:02:48.400]  you can get i mean the bigger opportunity is you can get to speak to the black
[3:02:48.400 --> 3:02:51.600]  community he hasn't done that and also
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:55.600]  um when it comes to uh barack obama you know um
[3:02:55.600 --> 3:02:59.200]  you're not caring about the black community guys like professor charles
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:03.120]  oventry dick gregory martin would became a third these are some of the most
[3:03:03.120 --> 3:03:06.000]  prominent people in the black community and they're not part of new world
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.360]  order matter of fact these people are some of the most anti-new world order
[3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:11.760]  people you can get if you ever listen to dick gregory's
[3:03:11.760 --> 3:03:15.360]  but i don't know how that translated into barack obama being anti-new world
[3:03:15.360 --> 3:03:18.480]  order i'm about to tell you all right you have to listen to dick gregory
[3:03:18.480 --> 3:03:22.160]  um speaking he's speaking on war valentine's radio show all the time

[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:28.800]  he's always speaking against the new world order and he's always on breaking
[3:03:28.800 --> 3:03:31.040]  things down he's kind of like jordan maxwell
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:35.200]  he's like the black jordan maxwell okay all the people back to barack obama
[3:03:35.200 --> 3:03:38.880]  so if barack obama is so much this globalist and new world order people
[3:03:38.880 --> 3:03:42.240]  why are all these prominent people who are very anti-new world first of all

[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:03.040]  does not mean that they can't be part of this globalist system
[3:08:03.040 --> 3:08:06.960]  a part of this quote unquote new world order let me read you something
[3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:10.320]  off the harvard university website the gazette news
[3:08:10.320 --> 3:08:16.000]  from september 27th 2001 now this is basically two and a half weeks
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:18.720]  after 9 11 because you did just mention people like
[3:08:18.720 --> 3:08:22.400]  you know martin luther king jr a great man but then you mentioned people like
[3:08:22.400 --> 3:08:26.640]  al sharpton and you know other people who were under suspicion
[3:08:26.640 --> 3:08:30.160]  and uh... of just being corrupt i mean not necessarily being part of any
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:33.040]  globalist organization but very corruptible
[3:08:33.040 --> 3:08:36.720]  all right this is what jesse jackson had to say in front of harvard university
[3:08:36.720 --> 3:08:41.360]  two and a half weeks after 9 11 it is easy to handle triumph
[3:08:41.360 --> 3:08:44.640]  can we handle trouble or disaster said jackson
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:49.040]  let us rise together for hope healing and a vision for the new
[3:08:49.040 --> 3:08:52.800]  world order and uses this term all the time he's not the only guy
[3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:56.560]  so i just wanted to bring that up to jameel look into it like i said i'm
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:00.080]  i'm voting for an african-american day for president on november
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:03.840]  fourth one week from today i will be voting for sythia mckinney
[3:09:03.840 --> 3:09:07.040]  um... the green party candidate for president president
[3:09:07.040 --> 3:09:11.280]  i encourage people not to waste their vote and vote third party i disagree
[3:09:11.280 --> 3:09:14.800]  with harpley i don't think getting mccain into offices
[3:09:14.800 --> 3:09:18.240]  is probable or possible unless you know the elitist really want that they
[3:09:18.240 --> 3:09:21.040]  rigged the voting the voting machines to do so
[3:09:21.040 --> 3:09:24.320]  all right without further ado we're going to bring on rama govern
[3:09:24.320 --> 3:09:29.120]  the twenty six year cia analyst he debrief people like dick cheney and
[3:09:29.120 --> 3:09:33.840]  others in the eighties his latest uh... editorial
[3:09:33.840 --> 3:09:38.080]  is attack on iran off the table and he really goes after the washington post
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:41.520]  for really putting a down swing on it like it's a bad thing
[3:09:41.520 --> 3:09:44.880]  that the attack on iran maybe off the table both here in israel
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:49.440]  uh... thanks for joining us ray you welcome patient glad to be with you
[3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:52.880]  now ray you know before we uh... get into this editorial
[3:09:52.880 --> 3:09:57.040]  election days a week away uh... you know i interviewed you a little over two
[3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:00.880]  years ago right in the run up to the two thousand and six election
[3:10:00.880 --> 3:10:04.800]  and we talked about the democratic congress getting in and possibly embolden
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:07.920]  them two years later were not out of iraq i mean
[3:10:07.920 --> 3:10:11.280]  obviously there are democrats i want to see and i'd love to see cindy she had
[3:10:11.280 --> 3:10:14.720]  take policy seat all man that would be a huge triumph
[3:10:14.720 --> 3:10:19.440]  but will give you your take on the election right now
[3:10:19.440 --> 3:10:23.440]  well uh... if i take five steps back jason
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:27.760]  i say to myself wow uh... i thought
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:32.800]  it was going to be a choice between a mccain type person
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:36.960]  and uh... uh... mrs clinton
[3:10:36.960 --> 3:10:40.240]  that would have been a real real problem for me
[3:10:40.240 --> 3:10:44.240]  i never thought that i would have a candidate running
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:48.400]  uh... who has said sensible things about iraq
[3:10:48.400 --> 3:10:52.640]  i had said said less than sensible things about other things
[3:10:52.640 --> 3:10:57.040]  but certainly in my view uh... you have to uh...
[3:10:57.040 --> 3:11:01.280]  look at uh... what the alternative is and uh...
[3:11:01.280 --> 3:11:05.840]  i noted your advice to to people in your own decision to uh...
[3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:09.040]  to to support my good friends and the uh...
[3:11:09.040 --> 3:11:12.880]  however i would ask people to reflect on what that could mean
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:16.320]  because uh... that happened once before lots of people
[3:11:16.320 --> 3:11:20.960]  supported a third-party candidate and we got george w four so
[3:11:20.960 --> 3:11:24.640]  think hard about that uh... before you waste your vote
[3:11:24.640 --> 3:11:27.920]  and you're obviously talking about ralph nader who was running the uh...
[3:11:27.920 --> 3:11:30.960]  previous two elections and also in this one correct
[3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:35.600]  for whom i also have great good great respect it's just that the reality
[3:11:35.600 --> 3:11:39.280]  is such that the very troublesome things of the intrude
[3:11:39.280 --> 3:11:43.360]  and i just still can't get over it but well i think my problem with barato is
[3:11:43.360 --> 3:11:46.480]  this he's he does talk about a de-escalation in iraq but that's been
[3:11:46.480 --> 3:11:50.160]  on the table for some time now and it never seems to go through
[3:11:50.160 --> 3:11:53.360]  and uh... you know we had webster tarpley on a couple hours ago
[3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:57.760]  and he really talked about how uh... obama is talking about possibly an
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:02.960]  invasion or a bombing of pakistan to go after the remnants of the taliban or
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:07.680]  al-qaeda and bin laden and that could cause a whole new situation
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:10.400]  in the middle east in eurasia
[3:12:10.400 --> 3:12:14.000]  yeah jason uh... again i know what's true uh...
[3:12:14.000 --> 3:12:17.920]  i think what one has to do is be really careful about taking
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:22.400]  campaign rhetoric uh... as a sign of real intention
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:27.680]  i mean look at what the obama has said about israel for example i mean it's
[3:12:27.680 --> 3:12:33.280]  almost sickening how uh... the candidates uh... rabbi among themselves to tell the
[3:12:33.280 --> 3:12:36.240]  american public who loves israel the best
[3:12:36.240 --> 3:12:39.360]  joe biden trying to outdo everyone else by saying
[3:12:39.360 --> 3:12:43.280]  yeah you we all love israel but i love israel with a passion
[3:12:43.280 --> 3:12:47.360]  you know i mean that's really ridiculous so you expect a kind of rhetoric
[3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:51.440]  from obama from anybody and when he talks about uh...
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:54.480]  you know about it can't stand for for example
[3:12:54.480 --> 3:12:58.880]  uh... he has to uh... sort of show the american people how tough he is that he
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:13:03.360]  is possibly he is up to uh... up to the the task
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:07.520]  she's a military cat task but i would fully expect
[3:13:07.520 --> 3:13:12.160]  and uh... i've been wrong about these kinds of things before
[3:13:12.160 --> 3:13:16.000]  but i would fully expect that once uh... were he to be in office
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:19.280]  that the the people that he would gather around him
[3:13:19.280 --> 3:13:24.320]  would tell him away feckless exercise not only rock but afghanistan has
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:29.120]  been and that the history dictates that no one wins this kind of battle or
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:32.320]  occupation and he would come to a census so
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:37.040]  i'm not willing to uh... to address what obama says about these things as
[3:13:37.040 --> 3:13:40.320]  as though they should be taken at face value
[3:13:40.320 --> 3:13:44.640]  so you do think that he's somewhat genuine and there's a possibility that
[3:13:44.640 --> 3:13:48.800]  these aggressions in the middle east uh... will subside after he's elected
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:54.080]  and he puts in an administration that you feel would deescalate the war
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:57.600]  well yeah i have you know the notion of the year
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:14:01.120]  candidate says you know a hundred years no problem
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:05.520]  uh... coming into office uh... turns my hair on end
[3:14:05.520 --> 3:14:10.880]  uh... i don't think that a fellow who's uh... made his reputation by
[3:14:10.880 --> 3:14:14.960]  uh... crashing airplanes and getting shot down
[3:14:14.960 --> 3:14:18.560]  has shown any real acuity with respect to
[3:14:18.560 --> 3:14:23.520]  policies to be crafted or followed and so it's a matter of compared to what
[3:14:23.520 --> 3:14:28.640]  finally and uh... you know what i look at uh... the democratic candidate
[3:14:28.640 --> 3:14:31.840]  and you look at the debates uh... there's a fellow
[3:14:31.840 --> 3:14:36.240]  with a cool head head easy and eager to learn
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:40.320]  and uh... i think he's teachable i think he uh...
[3:14:40.320 --> 3:14:44.320]  will probably avoid the mistakes of predecessors who thought they could come
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:49.120]  into washington and and just the uh... the people in the press and others
[3:14:49.120 --> 3:14:52.560]  with whom you really have to sort of work out a compromise so that they will
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:56.160]  give you half a chance to have your message heard
[3:14:56.160 --> 3:15:01.680]  and you know it's going to be not a very hard act to follow
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:05.440]  i mean these eight years have been a disaster for a country
[3:15:05.440 --> 3:15:08.960]  and you know just as uh... my friend bobby gates
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:12.880]  uh... the secretary of defense uh... just as he followed
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:16.240]  rumsfeld and had like a two-year honeymoon
[3:15:16.240 --> 3:15:20.560]  uh... so too i think whoever replaces bush
[3:15:20.560 --> 3:15:23.600]  presumably if it's the favorite contender
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:27.120]  that he will have a uh... honeymoon period where people would just so
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:31.600]  delighted to listen to a person who just conceivably might tell the truth on
[3:15:31.600 --> 3:15:35.120]  occasion uh... that if he's of a mind to that i'm
[3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:39.520]  hopefully is he can change these crazy policies
[3:15:39.520 --> 3:15:43.280]  well i don't share your optimism i feel like
[3:15:43.280 --> 3:15:47.360]  he is the slicker candidate by far he's obviously more well-spoken when
[3:15:47.360 --> 3:15:50.560]  john mccain comes out and talks about a hundred-year war
[3:15:50.560 --> 3:15:54.480]  or he talks about us being the enemy i mean you i think you can kind of see
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:15:57.280]  the senility in his face he doesn't look the healthiest
[3:15:57.280 --> 3:16:01.200]  i can't even believe that they've put him up there honestly in the run up to
[3:16:01.200 --> 3:16:04.240]  this i thought that they would go with someone more like a romney
[3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:07.840]  uh... i mean mccain's establishment and uh...
[3:16:07.840 --> 3:16:12.400]  the the palin pick i mean it it's bizarre it's not like he has a strong ticket
[3:16:12.400 --> 3:16:15.360]  it's almost like they're throwing the election i mean do you really think that
[3:16:15.360 --> 3:16:19.040]  mccain has a shot at winning this
[3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:22.320]  uh... you know i this is not my
[3:16:22.320 --> 3:16:26.320]  field of expertise jason i'm just uh... like my opinion is
[3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:31.120]  in this area is not worth anything more than the next persons but uh...
[3:16:31.120 --> 3:16:35.120]  you know uh... there are so many variables and so so many shenanigans
[3:16:35.120 --> 3:16:38.240]  been played over the last couple of elections
[3:16:38.240 --> 3:16:42.240]  that uh... i would encourage anyone who is as afraid as i am
[3:16:42.240 --> 3:16:47.120]  of palin and mccain to make sure that not only that the vote is taken but that
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:16:51.600]  the votes counters all right well let's jump to this uh... iran situation you
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:55.680]  you wrote this editorial um... you know we've discussed iran at length on the
[3:16:55.680 --> 3:16:59.600]  radio in uh... tv interviews with you in fours and myself
[3:16:59.600 --> 3:17:03.200]  did you really think right now we are off the table with iran it looks like
[3:17:03.200 --> 3:17:07.120]  there will not be a war of aggression out there
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:12.800]  uh... yes they do jason uh... and i say that as one who for three years uh...
[3:17:12.800 --> 3:17:16.240]  was saying that chances chances were at least equal
[3:17:16.240 --> 3:17:20.080]  equal and probably greater than equal that uh...
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:25.600]  bush and cheney uh... to fulfill their promise to israel would quote take care
[3:17:25.600 --> 3:17:30.160]  of iran what's changed well there are a bunch of things that have changed
[3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:35.360]  uh... one is that the uh... senior uniform military in this country
[3:17:35.360 --> 3:17:39.600]  have shown a little guts for a change uh... we had admiral fallon
[3:17:39.600 --> 3:17:42.800]  resigning after saying we're not going to do iran
[3:17:42.800 --> 3:17:47.680]  on my watch uh... resigning rather than letting himself be on the receiving end
[3:17:47.680 --> 3:17:52.960]  of the idiotic order to start a war with iran and risk the fortunes and
[3:17:52.960 --> 3:17:56.800]  lives of all those troops he has a rock at kennis and
[3:17:56.800 --> 3:18:00.240]  and in the Gulf he didn't want to put himself in that position and so he
[3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:03.760]  he in effect quit by going to the president saying
[3:18:03.760 --> 3:18:07.040]  we're not going to do iran that would be crazy now
[3:18:07.040 --> 3:18:10.720]  general admiral mullen mike mullen who came in
[3:18:10.720 --> 3:18:14.480]  you know i'm not i was an army officer so it's really hard for me to say these
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:19.280]  good things about maybe admiral's but uh... admiral mullen
[3:18:19.280 --> 3:18:23.520]  me and i can't get guts you know guts that we haven't seen he he goes back
[3:18:23.520 --> 3:18:27.520]  from israel and says uh... it would be very foolish
[3:18:27.520 --> 3:18:32.080]  to open yet a third war a third front in that part of the area
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:35.920]  and then we later learned that we we learned this from these early really
[3:18:35.920 --> 3:18:38.800]  press i mean you don't think you know anything like this from the american
[3:18:38.800 --> 3:18:43.040]  press so the what i call it the fawning corporate media
[3:18:43.040 --> 3:18:47.440]  we learned from the israeli press that when mullen was there
[3:18:47.440 --> 3:18:51.680]  he braced his opposite numbers in the israeli leadership and he said look
[3:18:51.680 --> 3:18:55.920]  don't even think don't even think of any tricky
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:19:00.320]  tricks in the version gulf or anything that would provoke the iranians so that
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:03.920]  they would attack you and then you would expect us to come in we're not going to
[3:19:03.920 --> 3:19:08.080]  come in if you provoke the attack and then you know the real place
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:10.880]  chris and you know what you brought up you brought up well bring it up on the

[3:23:56.960 --> 3:24:03.280]  year cia veteran he's discussing with us the uh... military personnel who have returned home and said
[3:24:03.280 --> 3:24:07.920]  no war with iran and you were just discussing a gentleman who just returned from israel and said
[3:24:07.920 --> 3:24:15.280]  the same thing right yes this was his chairman of the joint chiefs jason uh like mullen an admiral
[3:24:15.920 --> 3:24:22.480]  who's out there in june actually and uh totally israelis uh not only do we not want a new war
[3:24:22.480 --> 3:24:28.880]  with iran but uh don't even think about trying to provoke one by doing something to uh you know to
[3:24:28.880 --> 3:24:36.240]  to let the let the boom go up now um what i'm starting to say is he did something incredibly
[3:24:36.240 --> 3:24:44.560]  gutsy something that no u.s statesman has done in 41 years and that is he raised the incident
[3:24:44.560 --> 3:24:54.080]  of the u.s liberty ship that was deliberately attacked by israel on the 8th of june 1967 with 34
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:25:01.680]  crewmen killed 174 wounded uh there was an incredible attack and we have uh bulletproof
[3:25:01.680 --> 3:25:07.360]  evidence that it was intentional exactly why this really did it is a matter of some speculation
[3:25:07.360 --> 3:25:13.680]  talking about the u.s.s liberty of course yes and uh what mullen said was that you know he said
[3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:22.480]  look he said we don't want any more u.s.s liberty type incidents oh now why was it so powerful
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:29.040]  because israeli know that mullen knows as a naval officer what happened back on that terrible day
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:36.320]  june 8th 1967 and that mullen was not going to happen again that's about as direct that's about
[3:25:36.320 --> 3:25:42.720]  as as clear a message as you can send to the israeli leaders and right after that right after that we
[3:25:42.720 --> 3:25:49.280]  saw a slight attenuation of the propaganda out of israel and out of the united states with respect
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:57.520]  to what a terrible threat iran is or was but really isn't now the next big factor that has made it
[3:25:57.520 --> 3:26:05.280]  unlikely that we will be striking iran by air uh is the russia the russian bear we talk about the
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:11.440]  bear market well i'm talking about the russian bear who has it has it up to here now with his nose
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:18.880]  being tweaked what happened was the russians saw israel and saw us uh that is cheney and ellie
[3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:26.080]  abramson those types in the white house as being behind that idiot sakashvili's attack on south
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:31.920]  asesia now why was that important well the russians are up to here and they said look you know
[3:26:31.920 --> 3:26:36.640]  not only are we going to repel this attack and and they did so completely out of all
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:41.360]  and agree for that not only we're going to repel the attack but don't even think about georgia
[3:26:41.360 --> 3:26:48.160]  becoming port of nato or the ukraine and besides israelis if you thought that you could use georgian
[3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:56.240]  airfields to attack iran look at the map you folks uh if it was the only feasible way without flying
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:03.440]  over iraq and uh and other countries who would deny overflight permission uh coming down from
[3:27:03.440 --> 3:27:08.160]  georgia would have been quite feasible and that is according to some reports is what the israelis
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:14.480]  had in mind so the russians so it came down real hard uh walmer went up to russia other people
[3:27:14.480 --> 3:27:18.880]  went up to russia and they said look it's all over you know don't even think about attacking iran and
[3:27:18.880 --> 3:27:24.160]  they said the same thing to us and again we intelligence analysts look at all sources and
[3:27:24.160 --> 3:27:30.320]  we saw a very short fall off of all the warnings out of the white house about how bad ron is how
[3:27:30.320 --> 3:27:36.320]  it's supplying or opponents in iraq and how it's developing but they'll all fell right off in early
[3:27:36.320 --> 3:27:44.320]  august and it's still pretty before down two other factors i've mentioned briefly you know apac the
[3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:55.920]  american israel um political political something committee um they drafted legislation actually
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:28:02.240]  this is not so bizarre they do this regularly they drafted legislation which from the substance of
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:08.080]  bills in the house and in the senate uh which amounted to calling to print for president bush
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:14.560]  to blockade iran an act of war okay now traditionally when the israelis draft this kind
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:19.760]  legislation they put the word out and a hundred representatives you know cospons the thing like
[3:28:19.760 --> 3:28:24.160]  you know like before you could say jack robinson okay and that happened but guess what
[3:28:24.160 --> 3:28:30.800]  and the same thing happened in the senate guess what grassroots folks inundated their
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:36.640]  representatives with calls with emails with faxes and everything else and got them thinking
[3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:42.880]  and actually some of the cosponsors withdrew their sponsorship of that bill uh because they
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:48.080]  were afraid that indeed the president would be encouraged here's congress telling him
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:53.520]  to make an act of war on iran i think they also didn't want to fall victim to what i call the
[3:28:53.520 --> 3:28:59.280]  hillary clinton factor you know hillary actually thought it would be a smart political move what
[3:28:59.280 --> 3:29:02.800]  you voted for the war gets you right all right hold that thought ray we're gonna be with you
[3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:07.280]  after the break we're gonna take your calls ray mcgovern c i analyst it's the alex joneshow

[3:32:41.600 --> 3:32:46.560]  we're back it's the alex jones show i am jason bermus sitting in for alex jones we are with
[3:32:46.560 --> 3:32:51.920]  reama govern we're discussing the upcoming election and he just mentioned that uh
[3:32:52.720 --> 3:32:57.360]  hurley clinton was a bit of a warmonger against iran i mean she's pretty much said everything
[3:32:57.360 --> 3:33:02.480]  was on the table i want him to finish up his point on that and then i want to get his take on this
[3:33:03.120 --> 3:33:06.960]  coming international crisis that people like joe biden
[3:33:06.960 --> 3:33:12.960]  colin powell and now a key member of the pentagon advisory panel are talking about i want to think
[3:33:12.960 --> 3:33:17.440]  of i want to know whether he thinks this is a reality is this something that's coming up i i mean
[3:33:17.440 --> 3:33:22.400]  obviously with the bailout in the economy anything's possible uh but why don't you finish up your
[3:33:22.400 --> 3:33:30.080]  point and then comment on that sure y'all the business about the attack on iran uh being off
[3:33:30.080 --> 3:33:37.200]  the table probably um i just finish up by saying that uh it was a grassroots effort but many of
[3:33:37.200 --> 3:33:42.880]  the congressmen who actually had co-sponsored the bill withdrew that co-sponsorship and uh
[3:33:43.520 --> 3:33:48.720]  i think it wasn't altogether altruistic i think they were thinking about two years from now when
[3:33:48.720 --> 3:33:54.640]  they're when they're running again and there's a wider war still and they voted for it uh what i call
[3:33:54.640 --> 3:34:02.080]  the uh hillary clinton effect would set in you'll recall that back in october 2002 she thought it was
[3:34:02.080 --> 3:34:07.600]  the politically smart thing to do to vote for a war turned out to derail her her attempt to be
[3:34:07.600 --> 3:34:13.280]  president it will derail the attempts of others to be represented as her senators if they voted for
[3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:18.560]  a wider war and that's why the whole thing was squashed and this is the first time in recent
[3:34:18.560 --> 3:34:26.160]  memory that i've seen a grassroots effort able to defeat uh to defeat legislation not only proposed
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:32.720]  by but drafted by apac and the last thing of course is the financial crisis you know i think
[3:34:32.720 --> 3:34:38.480]  everybody kind of realizes that we run out of money i was spending billions in iraq and afghanistan
[3:34:38.480 --> 3:34:47.200]  every week so where we get the money yet to to get involved in a war with iran which is not at all
[3:34:47.200 --> 3:34:56.240]  like iraq or afghanistan but rather a very very strong country with lots of armed forces that
[3:34:56.240 --> 3:35:03.600]  dwarf ineffective this was something had before we attacked iraq so do you think there's a chance
[3:35:03.600 --> 3:35:08.800]  of this international crisis that biden and powell and other people in the pentagon are now talking
[3:35:08.800 --> 3:35:15.040]  about in the first months of his presidency if you get sent well jill biden is not one of my
[3:35:15.040 --> 3:35:19.520]  favorites you know he kind of runs off the mouth without thinking about what he's going to say
[3:35:20.240 --> 3:35:25.200]  and we're also dealing again here with the uh political rhetoric rather than reality
[3:35:26.560 --> 3:35:33.680]  my guess is that biden was just trying to draw a parallel between or something between obama
[3:35:33.680 --> 3:35:41.600]  and uh and jfk so even you did it we can't just accuse the neocons now that's all right continue
[3:35:41.600 --> 3:35:50.800]  yeah my apologies that's all right senior moments here uh yeah it's always politically good to
[3:35:50.800 --> 3:35:55.920]  compare your candidate with john kennedy for whom lots of people have continuing respect
[3:35:55.920 --> 3:36:02.160]  including myself and we all know at least those of those of us old as i am uh that kennedy was
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:08.000]  confronted he was young and he was confronted by hushroff he was actually confronted by the cia he
[3:36:08.000 --> 3:36:13.600]  was confronted by our military when they decided to go through with that bay of pigs foolishness
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:19.360]  and then expected kennedy to uh bail him out by sending the air force to save these guys
[3:36:19.360 --> 3:36:25.840]  uh they mousetrap them and so he was upset he was beset by all kinds of challenges not only
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:33.040]  from hushroff and vienna in may of 1961 but also the bay of pigs before that and you know there
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:39.200]  was the berlin uh out of the trouble over berlin excess and everything else so my guess and it's
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:45.280]  only guess is that what biden was referring to is what you know kennedy initially braced and shocked
[3:36:45.280 --> 3:36:52.160]  by all this came through and even when the uh the challenge to us in cuba with the russians
[3:36:52.160 --> 3:36:58.560]  sending uh missiles down there when that happened he was able to handle that in a cool and collective
[3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:04.800]  way but a strong way and he made the russians back down that's the memory most of us have a kfk
[3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:10.240]  but i think it's nothing more than that i don't think biden has any any special matter of fact
[3:37:10.240 --> 3:37:15.360]  given his record he certainly has no special foresight or insight into what's going to happen
[3:37:15.360 --> 3:37:19.360]  over the next half a year well i hope you're correct all right let's take some callers
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:24.480]  i hear that brian and arizona disagrees so you jump to the front of the line brian what's on your
[3:37:24.480 --> 3:37:31.920]  mind hey brian how are you hi doing good how are you good i think this uh first of all i want to
[3:37:31.920 --> 3:37:36.880]  make one comment about what they're saying about the barock will be tested i think they realize
[3:37:36.880 --> 3:37:41.520]  they need to warn everybody and what they're going to stage is more false flag terrorism
[3:37:41.520 --> 3:37:47.360]  but they need to brainwash the people instill it in their minds first and the one disagreement i have
[3:37:47.360 --> 3:37:53.520]  is about some footage that was used in a film and better footage could have been used um i happen
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:38:01.920]  to personally know the guys from v t h e pentacon dot com and they actually have even newer testimony
[3:38:01.920 --> 3:38:07.600]  other than the two pentagon police officers on site at the sicko that said the plane came in a
[3:38:07.600 --> 3:38:13.200]  different route on 9 11 than what the government's official fairy tale said and they have loyed the
[3:38:13.200 --> 3:38:18.240]  cab driver now they've re-interviewed him they've gone out and they've seen the cap that was staged
[3:38:18.240 --> 3:38:24.640]  on the south side flyover and even loyed's wife agrees that it was a north side flyover they've
[3:38:24.640 --> 3:38:29.840]  got a whole lot of new information yeah you know i like those guys and i like what they do i just
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:35.040]  feel like focusing on one issue like that when we're never going to get the 84 tapes that are
[3:38:35.040 --> 3:38:41.360]  still classified uh you know out to the public i mean god bless them for their research you know we
[3:38:41.360 --> 3:38:45.760]  went out to dc with them two plus years ago you know we interviewed loy the cab driver we
[3:38:45.760 --> 3:38:49.760]  interviewed the pastor who was the first on the scene you can see there we interviewed the first
[3:38:49.760 --> 3:38:54.480]  guy with a camera on the scene bob pew where you saw his footage all over the ap i just think that
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:38:59.280]  that issue is just it's more of a you know we already know they allowed whatever had to happen
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:03.200]  at the pentagon to happen i mean we that was something i've discussed with you years ago ray
[3:39:03.200 --> 3:39:08.400]  is that normanetta now on six or seven different occasions speaks about with you know whatever
[3:39:08.400 --> 3:39:13.760]  hit the pentagon we had about 20 20 minutes before and to do something about it we had uh you
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:18.880]  know 120 miles out 100 miles out 50 miles out 20 miles out to the order still stand so i think
[3:39:18.880 --> 3:39:23.680]  that that's a more compelling issue and to really focus on my new show like that at this point
[3:39:24.240 --> 3:39:28.960]  is is kind of you know it's it's counterproductive i thank you for the call brian let's go to
[3:39:29.520 --> 3:39:37.040]  mike in washington mike what's on your mind hey is this you like hey hey i just kind of off
[3:39:37.040 --> 3:39:44.160]  subject but i have an idea for the iphone okay like uh you know the obama you click on the widget
[3:39:44.160 --> 3:39:49.840]  and it brings up obama's little site okay i think alex needs to have one of these so you
[3:39:49.840 --> 3:39:54.480]  can if you look at obama's thing you can just go with well i'll tell you what right now i'm
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:58.400]  looking at info wars dot com and he's got something on the right that says listen to the alex jones
[3:39:58.400 --> 3:40:03.680]  show live on your cell phone so uh maybe you can do that i i mean that that's probably coming up
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:07.520]  we are moving into new offices we're trying to put together new things i'm putting together my own
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:12.320]  show we're we're trying to become more of a mainstream outlet to people i mean we can only
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:17.200]  do so much i mean when you literally have a staff and i'm not part of that staff i'm a staff of one
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:22.400]  but when you have a staff like alex of 10 people and two of those guys work in the newsroom and
[3:40:22.400 --> 3:40:28.320]  they're also your main editors i mean they're also your main cameraman it is tough to do everything
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:33.600]  but we do need your help all right let's jump to yet another call let's go to carlyle in texas carlyle
[3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:40.640]  you're on the line with rama govern and myself hey i actually have a uh come into the plug it's
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:44.960]  kind of off the subject from what you guys have been talking about okay but it has to do with
[3:40:44.960 --> 3:40:49.520]  how um chief osveido wants to force it to use the federal grants to forcibly you know take
[3:40:49.520 --> 3:40:55.520]  people's blood that refuse breathalyzers okay and i know i was jones had chief osveido you know

[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:27.040]  thanks for the plug all right let's jump to andy in north carolina andy what's on your mind
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:33.760]  mr mcgovern how are you there hi andy hey jayson how are you good man hey uh listen
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:39.120]  i'm mr mcgovern um i was going to ask you and correct me ryan and kentucky ryan that you were
[3:41:39.120 --> 3:41:46.800]  slightly dismayed by the fact that hillary didn't get the nomination uh not dismayed just really
[3:41:46.800 --> 3:41:53.760]  really really really really happy that someone who did something crass for for what for political
[3:41:53.760 --> 3:42:01.360]  purpose and as a result four thousand two hundred u.s. servicemen are killed that it turned out to be
[3:42:01.360 --> 3:42:06.960]  just the opposite of what she expected the war turned sour and the person who was against the
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:12.480]  war from the beginning won the nomination that should be an object lesson to all people who
[3:42:12.480 --> 3:42:19.440]  make important decisions based on their ambitions to be president or whatever well i certainly
[3:42:19.440 --> 3:42:25.280]  agree that you know that to see hillary go down is is a good thing and that is a is a victory if
[3:42:25.280 --> 3:42:31.280]  that's the case uh my thing is a little bit larger point i was left dumbfounded because i was i guess
[3:42:31.280 --> 3:42:35.360]  i'd become intellectually lazy that you know hillary was going to be given the nomination and we
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:39.680]  would just continue as we had because i figured the bush is going to create this police state
[3:42:39.680 --> 3:42:44.320]  if he's going to leave it he's going to leave it to someone that's going to continue on that thing
[3:42:44.320 --> 3:42:48.400]  and i think while we were all sleeping and maybe you could speak to this or maybe you disagree
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:52.400]  that this uh... thing the tarpley talks about i think he was a windbag really but i got to
[3:42:52.400 --> 3:42:57.120]  listen to him this whole obama thing in the fascism thing he he's on to it and i think that maybe
[3:42:57.120 --> 3:43:01.760]  we've slept walk through this and we're going to get a dictator that everybody loves rick and rino
[3:43:01.760 --> 3:43:07.040]  carry the one that you know it's hate it well let me say this i'm i'm definitely fearful of that i i
[3:43:07.040 --> 3:43:14.080]  think tarpley has somewhat of an ultra perspective on you know obama brings you know super fascism
[3:43:14.080 --> 3:43:19.760]  to the united states i don't see that but i do unfortunately i mean i i differ from mr mcgovern
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:25.120]  and i do see him bringing in more globalization i did not like his speech in berlin again i mean
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:30.480]  a million and a half man youth brigade talking about global citizenship um he seems to be on
[3:43:30.480 --> 3:43:34.800]  the wrong side of the coin on the carbon tax debate and i think a lot of people are gonna
[3:43:34.800 --> 3:43:39.920]  love him like i said i i disagree with tarpley where he says that obama isn't that well spoken
[3:43:39.920 --> 3:43:44.160]  and he stutters and stammer's i don't see that much at all and i watch him in extended periods of
[3:43:44.160 --> 3:43:50.240]  time i see him as a confident man who can look you in the eye he can orate well and he is good
[3:43:50.240 --> 3:43:56.560]  with his hands and his head motion i mean he's very good at answering questions and seem incredible
[3:43:56.560 --> 3:44:01.120]  and smart so you know i don't see that you want to speak to that uh... mr mcgovern what do you
[3:44:01.120 --> 3:44:06.800]  think i mean obviously you're in support of them well you know compared to what sort of thing
[3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:10.240]  and that you're quite right we're gonna have to wait and see
[3:44:10.240 --> 3:44:17.600]  um but i'm less concerned about the global aspects that seem to trouble so many people
[3:44:17.600 --> 3:44:26.720]  i mean if if adopting a global perspective means uh going back and realizing that the new
[3:44:26.720 --> 3:44:33.760]  new guidelines for war for example was set up after world war two and resulted in the charter
[3:44:33.760 --> 3:44:40.160]  of the united nations which prohibits any country from conducting a preventive attack
[3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:47.360]  or a quote preemptive end quote attack of the kind that bush and cheney have done
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:53.840]  um you're not allowed to attack another country unless there's an imminent threat to your country
[3:44:53.840 --> 3:44:59.040]  and there was nobody argues there was an imminent threat uh this crew thought they could change not
[3:44:59.040 --> 3:45:05.600]  only international law as uh as contained in the u n charter but national law because as you know
[3:45:05.600 --> 3:45:12.160]  once the senate approves such a charter and it did something like 95 to 2 once the senate approves
[3:45:12.160 --> 3:45:17.920]  that it becomes the law of the land and so a war of aggression is just not a really good thing to do
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:23.440]  and to be obama is focusing on that kind of thing that we would have a modicum of respect for the
[3:45:23.440 --> 3:45:29.280]  law well i have my head off to that kind of perspective all right let's jump to ryan in
[3:45:29.280 --> 3:45:36.320]  kentucky ryan what's on your mind let's talk about the uh recent uh news uh the public health
[3:45:36.320 --> 3:45:43.840]  emergency for anthrax botulism and smallpox until 2015 and how that could possibly played in the
[3:45:43.840 --> 3:45:52.880]  future and also on how that the the coast guard is actually the agency in charge of a biotech or
[3:45:52.880 --> 3:45:57.840]  a pandemic flu release well to be honest i don't really know much about this uh this new warning
[3:45:57.840 --> 3:46:03.200]  maybe you could send that over to uh erina info wars dot com i mean again something slipped through
[3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:08.000]  the cracks here we don't get everything we try to report as much as we can on our four hour radio
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:12.800]  show but that is something a point of interest we would be into so please email that to erina
[3:46:12.800 --> 3:46:19.040]  info wars all right let's go to rick in reno rick what's on your mind is obama going to have the
[3:46:19.040 --> 3:46:25.440]  coattails to end this war well i mean i i mean i'll i'll let reya answer that on his perspective
[3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:30.080]  obviously he's optimistic and hopeful that he does i don't believe so i mean i i see these
[3:46:30.080 --> 3:46:33.600]  de-escalation plans they're already in place they're talking about they're going to take a few
[3:46:33.600 --> 3:46:39.200]  thousand here and a few thousand there but but all it will take in my mind at least is an insurgency
[3:46:39.200 --> 3:46:44.800]  to keep the excuse to have have these people there i mean obama's been very slick with his his
[3:46:44.800 --> 3:46:48.560]  stance on the war he's you know obviously said that we have to take care of problems at home
[3:46:48.560 --> 3:46:54.320]  before we can take care of problems abroad he's very well spoken but i will leave that question
[3:46:54.320 --> 3:47:02.320]  to mr mcgovern do you think he's going to end this war well you know the war is over folks
[3:47:03.440 --> 3:47:11.120]  the iraqis have invited us out we cannot stand to stay there illegally past the 31st of december
[3:47:11.120 --> 3:47:17.920]  but we will incur the opprobrium of the whole world and the iraqis so it's just a matter of time and
[3:47:17.920 --> 3:47:25.280]  it's just a matter of setting the timetable for withdrawal now if we linger on like we did in
[3:47:25.280 --> 3:47:31.680]  saigon and in virens there in south vietnam then it's going to be a case of picking up the residual
[3:47:31.680 --> 3:47:37.360]  american presence off the rooftop to make sure that we don't have to go to the other side of the
[3:47:37.360 --> 3:47:44.000]  building up the residual american presence off the rooftops of the the billion dollar embassy
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:50.160]  we've just created there in the green zone and it's going to be a horror but it need not be so
[3:47:50.160 --> 3:47:57.600]  we need to listen to the iraqi 70 percent of the iraqis according to us army sponsored surveys 70
[3:47:57.600 --> 3:48:04.960]  percent want us out of there okay so all we have to do is disavow any any intention to grab more
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:12.800]  than our share of the oil to disavow any intention to build permanent military bases and uh and just
[3:48:12.800 --> 3:48:19.680]  say okay you can take this for real international community and then and only then you know the
[3:48:19.680 --> 3:48:25.280]  arab league countries india pakistan the west european they'll come in behind us and help us
[3:48:25.280 --> 3:48:30.720]  exit as gracefully as we can because they like us you know they all hate us by now but they're
[3:48:30.720 --> 3:48:35.360]  interested they're more interested in stability in that area than we are and of course they're
[3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:40.720]  also interested in getting a portion of the oil so it's over it's just a matter of whether we linger
[3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:46.400]  for two three four more years and take the kinds of casualties that we've had since the surge or
[3:48:46.400 --> 3:48:52.000]  whether we in a more enlightened way say okay maliki we understand the pressures you're under
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:56.960]  we're not going to press just any longer than you want us and just help us exit and as graceful
[3:48:56.960 --> 3:49:02.880]  away as is possible that's the answer and vote for those who you'll think that we have to stay
[3:49:02.880 --> 3:49:09.920]  there to referee a civil war between the sunni and shia i mean that that just doesn't force for me
[3:49:09.920 --> 3:49:15.120]  i don't i don't want one american young man or woman to perish because we're referring
[3:49:15.120 --> 3:49:20.560]  refereeing a civil war and that's what pretty much what it's down to right now i'm with you there
[3:49:21.600 --> 3:49:26.240]  ray you know you just talked about uh the oil and i was just wondering uh your opinion on whether
[3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:31.520]  or not you know this current economic crisis is going to continue to drop the price of oil by the
[3:49:31.520 --> 3:49:36.000]  barrel and you know how is this going to affect the oil industry you think that they're just going
[3:49:36.000 --> 3:49:41.280]  to subside on their massive profits they've taken in the last four years for a little while i do
[3:49:41.280 --> 3:49:46.240]  you think they're doing this you know to maybe make the economic crisis a little a little less
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:53.200]  worse so what what's your take on that well you know the uh the price of oil fluctuates depending
[3:49:53.200 --> 3:49:59.760]  on how big a threat there seems to be in the persian gulf and i think the oil companies are
[3:49:59.760 --> 3:50:05.200]  seeing what i reported earlier uh that there's less likely to be a wider war there and that the
[3:50:05.200 --> 3:50:11.840]  us will have to depart now the problem remains because you know as i've said to countless audiences
[3:50:12.480 --> 3:50:18.080]  one of the most most important factoids in the international situation is that the world is
[3:50:18.080 --> 3:50:23.600]  running out of oil and uh you know so in in a very real sense you can look at the attack on

[3:50:43.360 --> 3:50:50.080]  audiences one of the most most important factoids in the international situation is that the world
[3:50:50.080 --> 3:50:56.640]  is running out of oil and you know so in a very real sense you can look at the attack on iraq

[3:54:40.880 --> 3:54:47.280]  what's on your mind sir hi jason i'd just like to see i'm really pleased that i get through i've
[3:54:47.280 --> 3:54:52.960]  been trying to get through the show for a couple of months now what led me to you guys was a video
[3:54:52.960 --> 3:54:59.760]  called no end in sight about the iraq war okay which i was pretty disgusted with and so that led me
[3:54:59.760 --> 3:55:07.520]  on to you guys and now everywhere i look i can see things that alec is talking about he's been
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:12.880]  speaking about for months and i'm trying to tell people and it's so hard well other videos do you
[3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:17.520]  have out there those are those are the tools man i mean it's it's one thing to step up to somebody
[3:55:17.520 --> 3:55:22.640]  and talk to them you know you can you can get a light to start to switch on but when you hand them
[3:55:22.640 --> 3:55:27.200]  an info bomb like the movie that you know no end in sight that brought you out maybe you should be
[3:55:27.200 --> 3:55:32.720]  making copies of that or iraq for sale or my films loose change final cut uh... fabled enemies
[3:55:32.720 --> 3:55:37.760]  alexis films and games first you have to educate yourself and get the information then i always
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:42.800]  tell people the next level is to set up a little burner something that you can copy this information
[3:55:42.800 --> 3:55:47.920]  to you and then you know get a point of interest with somebody in other words an agreement point
[3:55:47.920 --> 3:55:51.680]  somewhere where you can relate to them and then hand off the dvd that's how you're going to reach
[3:55:51.680 --> 3:56:00.080]  the masses continue donnie yeah and i didn't notice a couple of weeks ago in glasgow where i live
[3:56:00.080 --> 3:56:07.120]  mm-hmm a private car with a kind of rig on the roof mm-hmm like a roof rack type thing but it was
[3:56:07.120 --> 3:56:13.920]  it was this big object sticking up from it and it really was it resembled the the machines they use
[3:56:13.920 --> 3:56:19.200]  the new york the sound detectors so yeah well what those are and i thank you for the call because
[3:56:19.200 --> 3:56:22.960]  i got a couple other ones those aren't sound detectors those are sound wave weapons and
[3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:28.240]  they're using those not only in domestic cases with the national guard like they did at the dnc
[3:56:28.240 --> 3:56:33.680]  and the rnc in 2004 but they're now using it for military applications and when they pointed at you
[3:56:33.680 --> 3:56:39.040]  in fire it literally feels like your whole body is a flame and you just want to move
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:44.240]  the quickest possible there's different levels different frequencies you know it can go further
[3:56:44.240 --> 3:56:51.760]  it can be lighter it's it's literally like a ray gun it's pretty crazy let's jump to mark in georgia
[3:56:51.760 --> 3:57:01.040]  mark what's on your mind you with me mark okay maybe we drop mark um let's go yes sir what's up
[3:57:01.040 --> 3:57:08.880]  there we go hallelujah i forgot i never mind uh yeah quite right quickly um the status of forces
[3:57:08.880 --> 3:57:14.480]  agreement is dead in the water according what i've read the iraqi representatives know that it's
[3:57:14.480 --> 3:57:22.320]  political poison and with this not being ratified it's like uh basically we can't stay there without
[3:57:22.320 --> 3:57:30.400]  this agreement without our forces being subject to their law in other words uh you know you rape
[3:57:30.400 --> 3:57:34.800]  or murder somebody we lock you up and we have to that seems to me like it's going to be political
[3:57:34.800 --> 3:57:38.720]  rhetoric i don't think there's going to be any any nuts behind that at all just like uh ray
[3:57:38.720 --> 3:57:43.280]  mcgovern says we're not leaving at the end of uh january you know what i'm saying and they're not
[3:57:43.280 --> 3:57:49.440]  going to start convicting or prosecuting members of blackwater or our military i am not as optimistic
[3:57:49.440 --> 3:57:54.560]  as mr mcgovern i don't see this change coming with obama i see i don't see the dark future that
[3:57:54.560 --> 3:57:59.200]  tarply has but definitely leaning towards that way i am jason bermas i subbed in for alex jones

[3:58:08.240 --> 3:58:13.520]  any any nuts behind that at all just like uh ray mcgovern says we're not leaving at the end of uh
