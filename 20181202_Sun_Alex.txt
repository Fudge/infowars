[00:00.000 --> 00:18.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:18.360 --> 00:36.360]  so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones we have
[00:36.360 --> 00:42.480]  before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future generations a new
[00:42.480 --> 00:48.720]  world order a world where the rule of law not the law the jungle governs the
[00:48.720 --> 00:55.280]  conductive nations when we are successful and we will be we have a real
[00:55.280 --> 01:01.080]  chance at this new world order an order in which a credible united nations can
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.480]  use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise and vision of the UN's founders
[01:06.480 --> 01:13.600]  it's a need for new world order but it has different characteristics in different
[01:13.600 --> 01:20.080]  parts of the world never before has a new world order had to be assembled from
[01:20.080 --> 01:26.560]  so many different perceptions or on so global a scale nor has any previous
[01:26.560 --> 01:30.680]  order had to combine the attributes of the historic balance of power system
[01:30.680 --> 01:36.120]  with global democratic opinion and the exploding technology of the
[01:36.120 --> 01:42.280]  contemporary period after 1989 present bush kept with said and it's a phrase
[01:42.280 --> 01:49.280]  that I often use myself that we needed a new world order I think his task will
[01:49.280 --> 01:54.880]  be to develop an overall strategy for America in this period when really a new
[01:54.880 --> 02:02.520]  world order can be created it's a great opportunity it isn't that a crisis what
[02:02.520 --> 02:11.520]  is at stake is more than one small country it is a big idea a new world
[02:11.520 --> 02:19.000]  order where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the
[02:19.000 --> 02:27.080]  universal aspirations of mankind peace and security freedom and the rule of
[02:27.080 --> 02:34.220]  law such is a world worthy of our struggle and worthy of our children's
[02:34.220 --> 02:58.600]  future
[03:04.220 --> 03:13.580]  The way that y'all was doing, when you're riding 15 hours, there's nothing we mustn't do.
[03:13.580 --> 03:25.500]  And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip would be the same.
[03:25.500 --> 03:33.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this Sunday, the second day of December 2018.
[03:33.580 --> 03:37.820]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours. I just played a little bit of a compilation.
[03:37.820 --> 03:41.660]  There's hours of this on YouTube of world leaders talking about a new world order.
[03:41.660 --> 03:45.980]  And then they go further. They say that means a world government where the nation state
[03:45.980 --> 03:50.860]  has been abolished. And boy, have we come a long way back from the days when they said that didn't
[03:50.860 --> 03:56.140]  exist. Back in the days of Congressman Larry McDonald and Senator Barry Goldwater and Ronald
[03:56.140 --> 04:02.700]  Reagan exposing it. And then George H. W. Bush forcing his way onto the ticket in 1980.
[04:02.700 --> 04:09.900]  So I don't wish George H. W. Bush any bad will. Now they died Friday night at 94 at the ripe old age.
[04:10.540 --> 04:17.980]  But I do see it as symbolic of the death of world government that that has happened. And also there's
[04:17.980 --> 04:25.020]  a big powerful article in the New York Times of all places saying that the curtain has been pulled
[04:25.020 --> 04:30.300]  on the Clintons, that it's curtains for the Clintons. So the Clintons are globalists,
[04:30.300 --> 04:34.700]  the Bushes are globalists, at least George H. W. Bush was. And this whole plan to have America
[04:34.700 --> 04:40.380]  sign over its sovereignty, these foreign multinationals is dead on arrival. They're fighting back.
[04:40.380 --> 04:45.740]  So we'll break it all down on the other side of this live global Sunday broadcast. I'm Alex Jones,
[04:45.740 --> 05:00.220]  live from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, NewsWars.com, Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[05:00.220 --> 05:04.380]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment
[05:04.380 --> 05:10.060]  from the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally
[05:10.060 --> 05:15.660]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine
[05:15.660 --> 05:21.740]  in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good
[05:21.740 --> 05:26.220]  but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it. So we discovered
[05:26.220 --> 05:31.980]  deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible. Now,
[05:31.980 --> 05:36.780]  due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[05:36.780 --> 05:42.220]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[05:42.220 --> 05:48.700]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[05:48.700 --> 05:54.460]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[05:54.460 --> 06:10.380]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at M4sLive.com.
[06:24.940 --> 06:40.380]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:46.140 --> 06:51.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Alex Jones, your host and we're here live Monday through Friday from
[06:51.180 --> 06:57.980]  11 a.m., the 3 p.m. Central of my weekday show but I'm also here Sundays live. 4 to 6 p.m.
[06:57.980 --> 07:01.020]  want to thank you for joining us today. This evening want to thank the great crew for the
[07:01.020 --> 07:06.860]  amazing job they do. Wow, obviously we're going to talk about the passing, we're going to talk about
[07:06.860 --> 07:14.780]  the passing of George Herbert Walker Bush at 94 on Friday and I'm certainly not dancing on his grave
[07:14.780 --> 07:26.780]  but I am very pleased that is a portend or an omen or a sign or a sign that his entire stinking
[07:26.780 --> 07:32.620]  world government project that he launched with David Rockefeller and others is in ashes right
[07:32.620 --> 07:39.660]  now and badly damaged, will never come back. It may try to form itself into you know some
[07:39.660 --> 07:45.020]  new criminal cabal and certainly stolen tens of trillion dollars but they are in big, big, big
[07:45.020 --> 07:51.420]  trouble. We're going to be looking at all that. Also we're going to be looking at what happened
[07:51.420 --> 08:00.300]  while Trump has been down in South America for the G20. We're also going to look at massive
[08:00.300 --> 08:06.460]  violence all over France by the French against the open borders, the Islamic invasion,
[08:06.460 --> 08:10.620]  the media tells you it's about gas taxes going up and that's part of it but we've had
[08:11.180 --> 08:17.020]  crew and folks over there they are on fire literally and figuratively sick of the globalist
[08:17.020 --> 08:22.380]  UN invasion and that ties into our reporters who in the last two weeks off and on have been
[08:22.940 --> 08:28.220]  in Mexico the migrant UN funded illegal alien invasion similar to what hit Europe
[08:29.420 --> 08:34.780]  tried to attack two weeks ago got pushed back and now the Mexican police under pressure from
[08:34.780 --> 08:39.980]  Trump have basically forced the 5000 or so that had made it to the border about 40 miles south
[08:39.980 --> 08:46.060]  of Tijuana into a sports stadium and they're processing up to a thousand a week or so and
[08:46.060 --> 08:52.380]  flying them back to where they came from in Central and South America. So the big announcement
[08:53.180 --> 08:58.380]  is that Bush has had you know his his day with world government but now we have our
[08:58.380 --> 09:03.660]  nationalist president, President Trump and we have other nationalists popping up everywhere
[09:03.660 --> 09:10.060]  after this nightmare and Trump's just had a big victory with the caravan being turned back
[09:10.060 --> 09:14.620]  because once that caravan made it through it would invite all the other caravans the 55,000
[09:14.620 --> 09:19.420]  other people still who haven't made it to the border who were in Mexico who smashed over the
[09:19.420 --> 09:24.860]  Guatemalan border a month ago that would embolden them and I think we haven't seen the last of this
[09:24.860 --> 09:30.460]  but we just won this battle we've not won the war and we've got incredible reports on infowars.com
[09:30.460 --> 09:37.580]  filed today by our own Greg Reese and we will be playing that coming up at the bottom of the hour
[09:37.580 --> 09:43.900]  we have reporters on the ground exclusive information newswars.com and infowars.com we'll
[09:43.900 --> 09:50.540]  also be looking at some of the history of the bushes and why they are such unsavory people
[09:51.660 --> 09:56.140]  and we'll also look at the latest political correctness and you've heard that Charlie Brown's
[09:56.140 --> 10:02.140]  Thanksgiving is racist because they invite a black child or friends with over their house
[10:02.140 --> 10:09.100]  that's racist and then also we have brutal threat news reindeer is now racist we've been told
[10:09.900 --> 10:16.140]  by mainstream media and now radio station pulls baby it's cold outside as a clear publicity stunt
[10:16.140 --> 10:22.140]  saying the idea that a woman wants a man the fact that she wants to snuggle everybody knows
[10:22.140 --> 10:31.500]  cold weather makes you frisky at least it does myself and we're going to be looking at all of that
[10:32.220 --> 10:39.580]  here today and then we're also going to look at the left being radicalized more and more towards
[10:39.580 --> 10:44.140]  what they really were always supposed to be and that's basically communists and socialists
[10:44.780 --> 10:50.060]  but the grassroots to socialize things erect the society direct the culture and the multinationals
[10:50.060 --> 10:58.780]  are offshore above the law so that is all coming up today just a small portion of what we're going
[10:58.780 --> 11:05.580]  to be breaking down and we have also footage from southern california of following a queue from
[11:05.580 --> 11:12.940]  north africa in the middle east migrants land boat on california beach 100 miles from the border
[11:12.940 --> 11:20.700]  so that whole invasion has begun and the socialist dingbat alexandra cortez compares
[11:20.700 --> 11:23.580]  her election victory to moon landing and us
[11:26.380 --> 11:33.420]  electioneering isn't that interesting that uh that you've got new york totally run by a bunch
[11:33.420 --> 11:38.540]  of socialists and people and then she compares her coming from nowhere being put in power by
[11:38.540 --> 11:43.900]  the establishment being worshiped to the moon landing truly disgusting so we're going to be
[11:43.900 --> 11:48.620]  looking at all of that coming up today as well uh the first thing i'm going to hit though when we
[11:48.620 --> 11:57.260]  come back uh is the whole situation with george herbert walker bush who is being so worshiped
[11:57.260 --> 12:05.580]  right now uh in the controlled corporate press and we're going to compare uh him to donald trump
[12:05.580 --> 12:10.860]  you know cnn rarely tells the truth but sometimes they do they have a headline up today that george
[12:10.860 --> 12:19.180]  herbert walker bush is the opposite of donald j krump and that's true one's a nationalist
[12:19.740 --> 12:25.580]  one believes in america one is a uh was a parasite elitist blue blood skull and bonzer
[12:25.580 --> 12:33.900]  who was all part of the ivy league white shoe boy elitist faction that saw the average public
[12:33.900 --> 12:40.780]  a scum uh and so george herbert walker was ambassador to china helped set up the modern
[12:40.780 --> 12:46.140]  deal for china to have one sided trade deals to deindustrialize the u.s i mean he is a globalist
[12:46.140 --> 12:52.620]  through and through his father was the top nazi agent in the u.s that's on record we'll be looking
[12:52.620 --> 12:59.660]  at all of that when we return and then the nationalist rebellion across the board that is
[12:59.660 --> 13:05.420]  taking place against all of this garbage and there's also another report we're going to be
[13:05.420 --> 13:11.820]  getting to next hour it's very uh frightening scientists urge world to share dna and central
[13:11.820 --> 13:17.180]  database for your protection that we know the rockefellers and the univ actually been studying
[13:17.180 --> 13:22.300]  dna and putting them in these different dna vaults so they can build bio weapons that are race specific
[13:22.300 --> 13:28.540]  and that's been declassified so we'll break down the rest of the story uh when we come up to the
[13:28.540 --> 13:35.260]  next segment i will plunge uh directly into all that i've already given you somewhat of a prelude
[13:36.540 --> 13:46.860]  but we will be doing that coming up in the next segment um please remember that info wars is under
[13:46.860 --> 13:52.380]  attack because we're actually talking about the real world the different global combines different
[13:52.380 --> 13:58.540]  corporate power structures the different alliances out there and the ether in which these corrupt
[13:58.540 --> 14:03.660]  alliances swim uh is the fact that the public isn't aware of how the real world works people
[14:03.660 --> 14:09.740]  that get political science degrees are kind of given an education on the porch of how things
[14:09.740 --> 14:15.260]  work they're not brought into the house and so info wars does is break down from reading
[14:15.260 --> 14:21.660]  policy papers and studying how the world really works and so we're going to continue to do that
[14:21.660 --> 14:27.580]  despite the establishment desperately trying to kick us off air because they know we have the answer
[14:27.580 --> 14:33.180]  to defeat their 1984 system now we're ending these specials today if you'd like to support

[18:02.060 --> 18:08.300]  in modern medicine introducing pollen block we have found an extraordinary new natural way to
[18:08.300 --> 18:14.220]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways
[18:14.220 --> 18:21.340]  eye comfort and respiratory functions in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate
[18:21.340 --> 18:27.020]  certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began
[18:27.020 --> 18:32.380]  studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research
[18:32.380 --> 18:39.020]  a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural
[18:39.020 --> 18:44.620]  and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts
[18:44.620 --> 18:50.060]  by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[18:50.060 --> 18:56.300]  responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com
[18:56.300 --> 19:01.580]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets we've taken thousands of years of known
[19:01.580 --> 19:06.860]  research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very
[19:06.860 --> 19:11.500]  best systems that god gave us your mother nature to detoxify the body that's why i'm introducing
[19:11.500 --> 19:17.820]  z shield toxic metal and chemical defense support it's made in the usa it's filled with
[19:17.820 --> 19:22.380]  known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it
[19:22.380 --> 19:28.060]  supports the info war it is a classical 360 win this is the formula that i personally have been
[19:28.060 --> 19:33.180]  taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a

[19:57.660 --> 20:13.580]  and force life dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:13.580 --> 20:29.500]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[20:29.500 --> 20:49.180]  well there's a headline we're seeing everywhere whether it's the new york times the washington
[20:49.180 --> 20:57.660]  post fox news or cnn presidents of celebrities put politics aside to honor george herbert
[20:57.660 --> 21:07.900]  walker bush that's right the 41st president of the united states but you see if you know about
[21:07.900 --> 21:14.700]  h.w. bush and his history everything he did was anti-american anti-gun anti-family
[21:14.700 --> 21:20.620]  anti-american worker i mean this guy was a global elitist social climber scum
[21:20.620 --> 21:29.420]  i'm going back to the earliest days of the rockefellers serving that family uber bad news
[21:30.380 --> 21:33.580]  and i'm going to go over some of the history of them and i don't take any pleasure the fact that
[21:33.580 --> 21:38.300]  he's dead and boy did he look like a crazy jack-o-lantern in the last few years with that
[21:38.300 --> 21:46.780]  demented once the man twice the child face he had but let's talk about the facts of this guy because
[21:46.780 --> 21:58.220]  his death friday night is another telltale milestone or art type omen of the fall of the new world
[21:58.220 --> 22:03.900]  order the fall of world government the fall of the anti-nation state project that he helped
[22:03.900 --> 22:08.300]  quarterback from the time he was the head of the cia never working for the cia which is
[22:08.300 --> 22:13.260]  ridiculous he was given direction of it immediately because he'd been working for it since he got out
[22:13.260 --> 22:21.980]  of the military and then if you expand on that he then became the ambassador to china everything he
[22:21.980 --> 22:28.300]  did was about shelling national sovereignty in this country out so here's the headline
[22:28.300 --> 22:34.540]  presidents and celebrities put politics aside to honor bush oh my goodness
[22:35.100 --> 22:40.380]  george h.w. bush's state funeral set for wednesday the stock market will be closed
[22:40.380 --> 22:46.700]  and it just goes on from there but here are some headlines i thought you might want to see from
[22:46.700 --> 22:55.340]  years past how bush's grandfather that's george w. bush h.w.'s father press cut bush how bush's
[22:55.340 --> 23:02.700]  grandfather helped hitler rise to power as the head nazi in the united states who got a lot of
[23:02.700 --> 23:08.460]  the nazi wealth at the end of world war two and who helped the nazis get out of germany
[23:08.460 --> 23:15.980]  and then who helped the world government project of the eu as well and that dove tells another very
[23:15.980 --> 23:23.260]  powerful article out of the new york times curtains for the clintons and marine dowd breaks down
[23:23.260 --> 23:27.980]  that all over the country they would rent these big sports stadiums for 20 000 people
[23:27.980 --> 23:33.660]  and only a thousand or so would show up to see the clintons and how the democrats just wish
[23:33.660 --> 23:45.900]  they'd go away but they won't and hillary is planning to run again curtains for the clintons
[23:45.900 --> 23:56.700]  and again if you study real history the clintons both bill and hillary were groomed right at the
[23:56.700 --> 24:05.580]  same time her in illinois bill in little rock meeting with kennedy when he was only 15 uh we
[24:05.580 --> 24:11.740]  would have a rockefeller when he was 15 because he was the illegitimate son of a rockefeller that
[24:11.740 --> 24:17.260]  evidence is overwhelming from a lady of the night and and and hillary in time life books
[24:18.300 --> 24:21.740]  in the 60s in high school saying this will be the first female president
[24:21.740 --> 24:30.060]  and her father being a known mafia boss uh in chicago so they were groomed and we even know
[24:30.060 --> 24:34.300]  who their cia handlers were when they were both in england they were both sent into moscow as well
[24:35.100 --> 24:39.340]  uh they were they were hired because of their criminality early on by the globals by the deep
[24:39.340 --> 24:45.740]  state by corrupt elements of the cia and they were put into long-term projects to become presidents
[24:45.740 --> 24:52.300]  and so was baroque to san obama that's been declassified as well so that's all this is
[24:53.740 --> 24:58.940]  is a deep state project of these nobodies george herbert walker bush his dad's the top nazi
[24:59.500 --> 25:03.580]  so he gets in power and then and then george dubby gets in power and and then and then
[25:04.300 --> 25:09.820]  obviously they thought hillary would be in power so you have to understand george herbert walker
[25:09.820 --> 25:14.860]  bush went to china and got the deals signed to do one side of deals where we wouldn't have any
[25:14.860 --> 25:20.540]  tariffs they'd have huge tariffs but as long as globalist corporations got to exploit chinese labor
[25:21.740 --> 25:25.500]  there's no labor disputes in china they just kill your ass there's no environmental standards
[25:25.500 --> 25:29.980]  or nothing you never hear a word out of our corporate media because there's an alliance
[25:29.980 --> 25:36.380]  between the chai coms and the globalist anti-american cfr faction and they've all written books on this
[25:36.380 --> 25:41.020]  and admitted it so here comes trump and here comes Nigel ferrage and here comes all these other
[25:41.020 --> 25:45.340]  nationalists saying you know what you may be these elites that took control of our countries
[25:45.340 --> 25:52.300]  through international agreements like the tpp the imf the world bank uh the world trade organization
[25:52.300 --> 25:57.980]  but we're going to oppose this now you know george herbert walker bush talked about invading iraq
[25:58.860 --> 26:02.140]  because they weren't following the rule of law but under globalism they don't even follow nation
[26:02.140 --> 26:06.620]  state's rule of law so now i'm just saying was set up and told by the u.s. ambassador abel
[26:06.620 --> 26:11.660]  clesping you should invade so wait we're going to back you they just backed him in a seven-year
[26:11.660 --> 26:18.300]  war with iran that killed millions but saddam was overthrown because he was stabilizing the
[26:18.300 --> 26:22.620]  middle east and there was another planet he stabilized it you saw continue with the arab
[26:22.620 --> 26:26.860]  spring and hillary and destabilizing north africa and destabilizing everything else
[26:28.380 --> 26:34.940]  right through to what's happening currently because they want to cross the borders of europe
[26:34.940 --> 26:42.940]  they have an official u.n plan developed more than 70 years ago to do this this has been a long
[26:42.940 --> 26:49.180]  term strategic elite plan of the european elites and the british empire and what's left of america
[26:50.060 --> 26:54.460]  that's why you can type into a search engine e u was a plan of hitler it was a plan of hitler
[26:55.580 --> 27:02.460]  and this whole system is about empire so when george herbert walker bush dies
[27:02.460 --> 27:11.260]  and the whole corporate media acts like jesus was just crucified it's because they're propping up
[27:11.260 --> 27:15.020]  this corrupt anti-american fossil
[27:17.980 --> 27:22.220]  and they want you to think he's this great guy when all he ever did was work against the
[27:22.220 --> 27:26.460]  interest of the united states and the average people they think having a nation state or
[27:26.460 --> 27:32.940]  caring about a middle class is stupid a decade after scanners at grocery stores have become
[27:32.940 --> 27:39.820]  ubiquitous they were in everywhere in 1992 he went into a grocery store in front of the cameras and
[27:39.820 --> 27:45.820]  didn't know what a scanner was they'd been around since the 70s they had been almost everywhere
[27:45.820 --> 27:53.100]  by the 80s in 1992 he didn't know what a grocery store scanner was you know me and one of my friends
[27:53.100 --> 27:58.700]  have a name of these trust fund babies call them aliens because you get around really really rich
[27:58.700 --> 28:01.580]  people who've never had to work a day in their life and they just expect everything because
[28:01.580 --> 28:07.340]  they're the establishment and they don't know how to tie their shoe laces like yunker his father
[28:07.340 --> 28:14.700]  was the head of the whole nazi industrial operation grandfather served hitler he doesn't
[28:14.700 --> 28:20.060]  know how to put his shoes on or walk hardly everyone just props him up he's the unelected
[28:20.060 --> 28:27.260]  head of the eu and you can't get rid of him so that's what they've set up so hillary and bill
[28:27.260 --> 28:31.020]  and the democrats hating them and no one showing up at their events and george herbert walker bush
[28:31.020 --> 28:37.100]  dying are all road size the end and the collapse of world government so i'm sad for george
[28:37.100 --> 28:41.740]  herbert walker bush because you don't wish death on anybody but you know he was a war criminal
[28:42.380 --> 28:47.500]  and he did launch all these giant evil wars and now the same corporate press that hates america
[28:47.500 --> 28:52.620]  tells us how great he is well i say he was a great evil and a great enemy of america

[33:51.020 --> 34:00.940]  in 1990 died at 94 man what a pedigree his father was the head nazi in the u.s on record congressional
[34:00.940 --> 34:08.220]  hearings found it prescott bush he helped sell us out to communist china he almost had the nra
[34:08.220 --> 34:14.780]  shut down as president he groomed bill and hillary clinton the cia and staged that whole election
[34:14.780 --> 34:20.620]  decades later he helped sign us on the napkin and gat and deindustrialized the united states
[34:21.500 --> 34:27.420]  i mean george herbert walker bush his his death though as a signpost it's like the clinton's
[34:27.420 --> 34:32.620]  can't fill stadiums even five percent and everybody hates them it all shows that globalism's
[34:32.620 --> 34:40.700]  like garbage you can't get anybody to even take it and george herbert walker bush ladies and
[34:40.700 --> 34:47.260]  gentlemen who helped have the fake fall the soviet union it was declassified they were
[34:47.260 --> 34:52.300]  trying to prop it up actually when it did fall they helped set up oligarchs here to loot the russians
[34:52.300 --> 34:58.860]  further in economic slavery but again that that project's failing too everything he touched 30 years
[34:58.860 --> 35:05.660]  ago is now turning into ashes and george herbert walker bush and the clinton globalist dynasty
[35:05.660 --> 35:12.940]  the whole thing is dead we have before us the opportunity to forge for ourselves and for future
[35:12.940 --> 35:19.660]  generations a new world order a world for the rule of law not the law of the jungle
[35:19.660 --> 35:27.660]  rule governs the conduct of nations when we are successful and we will be we have a real
[35:27.660 --> 35:34.060]  chance at this new world order an order in which a credible united nation a credible united nations
[35:34.060 --> 35:38.700]  then he goes on to say it takes control of the nation states unelected looting the population
[35:38.700 --> 35:45.020]  opening being borders flooding us with third world populations driving down the wages like
[35:45.020 --> 35:50.700]  ross perot warned they would do this is the reality and now he has a legacy of ashes
[35:52.220 --> 35:56.940]  after all the things george herbert walker bush did his entire family's discredited
[35:56.940 --> 36:06.140]  jeb bush george bush junior all of them but i don't wish him harm he's dead but i won't sit up
[36:06.140 --> 36:10.860]  here and lie like other people and tell you what a great person he was i don't mind trump
[36:10.860 --> 36:15.740]  being magnanimous and taking the high row and how could you not look at george herbert walker
[36:15.740 --> 36:19.980]  going around out of his mind you know looking like a three-year-old the last few years and not
[36:19.980 --> 36:26.540]  feel sorry for him because i don't want to see anybody be involved in evil and end up going to
[36:26.540 --> 36:32.780]  hell and i'm not a judge god does that but if i was a betting man i would tell you that george
[36:32.780 --> 36:39.740]  herbert walker bush is not in a very good place today and you know the reason i'm demonized the
[36:39.740 --> 36:44.060]  reason they try to take us off air everywhere is because we'll just study the history and tell
[36:44.060 --> 36:50.060]  you what's really going on period and that's what we're doing here on air is breaking down the whole
[36:50.060 --> 36:55.100]  world government project of what was left of the british empire and the rockefeller foundation
[36:55.100 --> 37:02.860]  and the carnegan foundation and the fact that ronald reagan and bary goldwater and larry mcdonnell
[37:02.860 --> 37:10.140]  and so many other people fought so hard to expose it in some cases gave their lives like larry mcdonnell
[37:10.140 --> 37:15.260]  and then we've paid so much we've gone through so much to do this makes it that much more savory
[37:15.900 --> 37:21.980]  to see nationalists and patriots being elected and i don't care what's benjamin yet and yahoo in
[37:21.980 --> 37:30.060]  israel or donald j trump in the united states or nigel forage in the uk or the nationalists and
[37:30.060 --> 37:35.500]  folks getting elected all over the place in france and germany and italy uh and and and and brazil
[37:36.380 --> 37:40.540]  i admire them all not because they're perfect not because i agree with all their politics but
[37:40.540 --> 37:45.500]  because they're honorable people who are going up against the globalist cartel they're all trying
[37:45.500 --> 37:50.220]  to indict net and yahoo trump they're already trying to stab and kill the great patriot in
[37:50.220 --> 37:54.220]  brazil they're trying to kill and attack you know the new italian president is a patriot
[37:55.340 --> 37:59.580]  these people really care about their own population they're saying no to this big global
[37:59.580 --> 38:08.940]  of take down backed by the hollywood scum and backed by the chai comes and backed by the e u and
[38:08.940 --> 38:14.860]  it's a beautiful thing to see and so all these years later the whole world government project
[38:14.860 --> 38:21.820]  has fallen and all the king's horses and all the king's men can't put their world government back
[38:21.820 --> 38:29.420]  together again now here's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna give the phone number out and i always
[38:29.420 --> 38:33.820]  feel guilty at the end of a show because we have a phone system that can take thousands of calls
[38:33.820 --> 38:39.980]  at once we had 24 000 calls in two hours once it's digital we can see it but 30 or so can get on
[38:39.980 --> 38:44.700]  there and then i i get like 20 calls up and then i only take 10 up well that 10 calls on a show is
[38:44.700 --> 38:53.260]  a lot but i always feel guilty about the 10 we don't get to so let's do this let's open the phones up
[38:53.260 --> 39:01.980]  take 10 keep the other lines busy and then if we take those 10 then we'll open the phones up and
[39:01.980 --> 39:06.220]  take new ones because i just am not going to have people sit there on holds and you know the show
[39:06.220 --> 39:10.300]  anymore it's something that i don't like i just feel disrespectful like i'm running a restaurant
[39:10.300 --> 39:14.780]  or something you know in the information war people get to have their say i respect your say
[39:14.780 --> 39:18.460]  you're actually giving us something out the other way around and like you came and sat in line and
[39:18.460 --> 39:22.460]  don't get your cheeseburger or whatever so that's something i went to implement with the crew i hadn't
[39:22.460 --> 39:30.540]  told them yet we're going to take 10 calls specifically on world government specifically
[39:30.540 --> 39:34.860]  on the bushes specifically on how much trouble they're in because you know we we see their counter
[39:34.860 --> 39:38.700]  offensive and we see their attacks and we feel like we're getting our ass kicked and you know
[39:38.700 --> 39:43.420]  those of us in the front line are but at the end of the day the whole world is awake to
[39:43.420 --> 39:50.860]  world government turning against it and you see ridiculous articles like in january of this year
[39:50.860 --> 39:56.620]  saying is there such a thing as globalism the globalists call their world government system
[39:56.620 --> 40:03.740]  globalism and then they they they they conclude no there isn't that's like saying the there isn't
[40:03.740 --> 40:11.820]  a blue sky at midday and i saw this big carnagian down an article in politico this weekend about
[40:11.820 --> 40:16.700]  larry mcdonnell let me do a whole piece on it's time to honor that man incredible democrat congressman
[40:16.700 --> 40:23.100]  doctor medical doctor and i was reading even their own admissions like every paragraph they'd
[40:23.100 --> 40:27.580]  make a joke about it was like the former cia director was his total backer and ronald reagan
[40:28.220 --> 40:33.580]  totally worked with him and members of nato and everyone else and he was just the guy who's
[40:33.580 --> 40:40.220]  going to do all the work 20 hours a day and then you read the end the carnagian down it wrote the
[40:40.220 --> 40:47.340]  article which is the shadow world government that ran the marshal plan i mean it's it's it you want
[40:47.340 --> 40:52.380]  to know the mother ship baby or kind of like hit the clown you know it's just a finger of the demon
[40:52.380 --> 40:58.220]  you look at the allegory but down the well is the big creature down the well is the carnagian
[40:58.220 --> 41:05.500]  down and i mean it's the it's the enchilada baby it created the rockefeller foundation it spawned
[41:05.500 --> 41:11.980]  the whole world government program and you read this article about him blowing up at the jet he's
[41:11.980 --> 41:17.500]  on killing him and everything else and then they're just and then they just make jokes like tinfoil hat
[41:19.660 --> 41:24.860]  there's like every top he had four four star generals on his board of directors the former
[41:24.860 --> 41:29.660]  founder of the cia all these people and he was just the guy willing to work 20 hours a day to
[41:29.660 --> 41:34.460]  collate create a database because they knew there was going to be an attempted global takeover of
[41:34.460 --> 41:38.460]  america and they were desperately trying to create a database of who these networks were
[41:38.460 --> 41:42.540]  because they knew they were creating a database of us to come kill us later and of course now the
[41:42.540 --> 41:48.060]  database is public to the patriots are and they're lazing targets at all the trump homes and tucker
[41:48.060 --> 41:54.300]  carlson and everywhere else and you know now people get how real this is but to a trained eye you read
[41:54.300 --> 41:59.500]  that political article and it is just like wow if i put it back on screen if you can't all get folks
[41:59.500 --> 42:05.740]  the headline but don't scroll down i'll give them the headline thanks it's the congressman who created
[42:05.740 --> 42:12.140]  his own deep state really and of course he was exposing the real big state oh and who was them
[42:12.860 --> 42:20.940]  who was the deputy head of it roi cohen donald john trumps chief mentor and fred trumps big buddy
[42:20.940 --> 42:29.580]  and i told you trump was recruited by a group of patriots decades ago and he kept saying i don't
[42:29.580 --> 42:34.460]  want to do it i don't want to do it it got so bad he refused him five years ago and they and then
[42:34.460 --> 42:38.860]  finally his wife came in we have to do it but the point is you read this article this is all the
[42:38.860 --> 42:47.180]  secrets of trump actually called western goals and see i remember being a kid little kid and a boy

[47:47.580 --> 47:55.100]  eyes i like eighteen right now i'll take your that the virtue signaling controlled left has called
[47:55.100 --> 48:03.420]  for the banning or the not airing of a best-selling song from back in nineteen forty nine neptune's
[48:03.420 --> 48:10.940]  daughter baby it's cold outside which i mean everybody knows women and men get frisky and

[48:29.500 --> 48:33.180]  so you've got to have the leftist waddle in like they did the last week
[48:33.180 --> 48:40.620]  and say that charlie brown's thanksgiving was racist because they invite the lat kid over
[48:40.620 --> 48:44.940]  her actually it was revolutionary when that was done in nineteen sixty three
[48:47.340 --> 48:49.980]  it was done to fight racism but it doesn't matter just you you'll just
[48:49.980 --> 48:53.900]  territorially just say it is she get the news and make everything wholesome bad
[48:55.500 --> 48:59.740]  and say that the creator of peanuts who's an anti-racist support martin with her king
[48:59.740 --> 49:05.340]  as a racist because then you get to create racism and division oh oh they didn't stop there
[49:05.340 --> 49:09.340]  there was another big articles everywhere root off the red nose reindeer's we take it off tv
[49:09.340 --> 49:15.740]  it's racist and you know a lot of channels agree we'll we'll take it down right now
[49:16.700 --> 49:23.340]  and it's all about if you just a virtue signal something it's racist you know people joked
[49:23.340 --> 49:27.340]  about a year ago and said that milk is racist and it's white when new york times ran real articles
[49:27.340 --> 49:33.180]  saying yeah white supremacist are drinking milk because it's white there you go the huff is in
[49:33.180 --> 49:38.620]  post we're all thread those rangers seriously problematic but meanwhile radio station pulls
[49:38.620 --> 49:44.300]  baby it's cold outside i wonder if this is a stunt it's a radio station of the news in cleveland
[49:44.300 --> 49:48.940]  probably not she's like you know there's just something creepy about a woman wanting a man
[49:50.540 --> 49:57.900]  and we're not going to play it and was like oh oh yeah yeah a woman saying man baby it's cold outside
[49:58.780 --> 50:03.660]  let's go inside and have a little bit of fun here that's and have children and have a life and
[50:03.660 --> 50:09.100]  men and women you know the species oh no that they said well post me to movement
[50:10.300 --> 50:14.460]  where you know all men wanting to have contact with women is a bad thing you know japan's been
[50:14.460 --> 50:18.140]  through that and now the men won't date women they're begging them to bed but they won't
[50:20.300 --> 50:21.660]  and so it's the collapse of society
[50:24.940 --> 50:29.180]  it's a christmas classic probably being played in shops and radio stations all over the world
[50:29.180 --> 50:35.900]  but a radio station in cleveland ohio has decided to remove baby it's called outside from its playlist
[50:35.900 --> 50:39.660]  following complaints from listeners that we should click on the bbc article and show you
[50:39.660 --> 50:45.500]  they had a poll 98% say this is bs well that shows the 2% are obviously saying
[50:47.420 --> 50:52.620]  but again why is what 2% being said being forced everywhere this is about division
[50:53.660 --> 50:57.180]  but a radio station in cleveland ohio has decided to remove baby it's called
[50:57.180 --> 51:03.980]  outside from its playlist following complaints from listeners oh i bet complaints local media
[51:03.980 --> 51:08.220]  just look at these two together it looks like they're having a horrible time her and that
[51:08.220 --> 51:12.540]  tight fitting dress she just hates to wear him and that tight fitting suit or dancing i mean
[51:12.540 --> 51:16.620]  great night and then they have a great dinner and have some drinks and go home and make love and
[51:16.620 --> 51:21.020]  it's just so horrible because we got to have the weird government media get in the middle of men
[51:21.020 --> 51:32.140]  and women how perverted and sick and freakish is that local media reports that listeners said the
[51:32.140 --> 51:38.700]  song was inappropriate and at odds with the hashtag pound me too it's a pound sign pound me too movement
[51:39.580 --> 51:45.020]  but a poll on the station's facebook page showed the majority of response did not want the song
[51:45.020 --> 51:53.580]  banned 98% we pulled the article glenn anderson a host on the star 102 station blogged that although
[51:53.580 --> 52:00.460]  the song was written a different era the lyrics felt manipulative and wrong no you feel manipulative
[52:00.460 --> 52:05.900]  and wrong the world we live in is extra sensitive now you mean mentally ill and erotic and people
[52:05.900 --> 52:10.940]  get easily offended because people like you play into it but in a world where the pound me too
[52:10.940 --> 52:16.940]  movement has finally given women the voice they deserve the song has no place does the hashtag
[52:16.940 --> 52:22.540]  was the pound sign written by frank losser in 44 baby it's cold outside has been considered
[52:23.260 --> 52:28.220]  and and covered by lady gaga well she's got to be fired immediately and it goes on michael boobly a
[52:28.220 --> 52:34.780]  tom jones but this is just evil folks and they teach you to project onto christian remember
[52:34.780 --> 52:39.420]  sign felt had a 13 year old daughter like five years ago i guess she's like 18 or 19 now and he
[52:39.420 --> 52:43.980]  said you know honey we moved out to this rural area northern new york but we want you to have
[52:43.980 --> 52:48.460]  more friends and meet more boys because all you do is play video games all day she goes oh my god
[52:48.460 --> 52:52.940]  boys and girls to say boy and girl is hateful and sign felt went i'm a liberal but this is
[52:52.940 --> 52:59.900]  brainwashing and the media attacked sign felt for not being sensitive your daughter's good no no
[52:59.900 --> 53:08.380]  boy and girl is bad whether it be boiling girl killer whale boy and girl walruses boy and girl
[53:08.380 --> 53:16.700]  uh hedgehogs any mammals liking each other is bad the ultimate divide and conquer men
[53:16.700 --> 53:20.140]  and women hating each other there are good men there are bad men there are good women there are
[53:20.140 --> 53:27.820]  bad women but this idea of war against the sexist is even in the wiki leech with hillary talking
[53:27.820 --> 53:34.540]  about how to do it so that women don't look for a good husband men don't look for a good wife or
[53:34.540 --> 53:44.300]  no or relationship it's all hillary is my woman hillary is my man hillary is your pimp you just
[53:44.300 --> 53:50.620]  vote for her and worship her and you'll get some floating castle in the sky up there that gives
[53:50.620 --> 54:00.940]  you all your dreams come true talk about cynical talk about wicked just look at how unhappy the
[54:00.940 --> 54:05.260]  folks that sang the song look together here in this photo of your tv viewer just zoom in on that
[54:05.260 --> 54:11.980]  look at hate that's so unnatural our entire species history who we are all the genetics carried by the
[54:11.980 --> 54:18.460]  woman no yeah the women care the genetics men are literally embryonic a woman until the female
[54:18.460 --> 54:23.580]  decides to make it a female and they're just telling you because they care about her that's
[54:23.580 --> 54:27.260]  how they put all the chemicals and things to sterilize her and attack her and turn the
[54:27.260 --> 54:33.180]  herb spring on her and everything is to get rid of her and then get rid of him there'll be no more
[54:33.180 --> 54:40.860]  her but see they love you so much they're gonna keep a woman from oh out in the beautiful snow
[54:40.860 --> 54:48.700]  covered forest in a cottage with a man and happy little children and if you oh you can't have that
[54:48.700 --> 54:55.900]  so if that's your enemy you attack it until it's seen as a virtue signal here let's go up can we
[54:55.900 --> 55:06.700]  cue it back up i should give the number out to 877-789 alex 877-789-2539 877-789-2539 on the
[55:06.700 --> 55:16.860]  specifics of globalism but let's hear this taboo this verboten this forbidden fruit of
[55:18.300 --> 55:23.820]  what have we for the first time in the western world there are more old people than young
[55:23.820 --> 55:30.060]  and all the studies show if you don't have 2.2 people on average to take care of every two people
[55:30.060 --> 55:34.460]  because society collapses but then you add on all the third world populations and they're on a
[55:34.460 --> 55:39.500]  welfare state it will collapse things within 20 years but that's okay trump tried to get the economy
[55:39.500 --> 55:43.020]  going the federal reserve raised interest rates to kill it because they don't want that they want
[55:43.020 --> 55:50.060]  societal collapse to consolidate control and then things are so sick that this cult tells you charlie
[55:50.060 --> 55:58.380]  bounds racist rudolf the red nose reindeer's racist and maybe it's cold outside is racist i mean if you
[55:58.380 --> 56:05.980]  want to get a little misogynistic or exploitive it's a very sick song in a good way because men
[56:05.980 --> 56:10.780]  like to really give women stuff when they love them and women kind of send us out of the robots for
[56:10.780 --> 56:17.420]  war everything else which is fine but it's that song hey santa sort of Rolex under the tree for me
[56:17.420 --> 56:22.140]  i mean if you really wanted to target one but no no they targeted this one because it's so sweet
[56:22.140 --> 56:27.340]  it's so good it's so wholesome baby kind of the love is all about men and women having a good time
[56:27.340 --> 56:31.100]  well that was the 60s and they were baiting you into not having long-term relationships
[56:31.820 --> 56:36.860]  but it's that man and woman buying together that magic that could build a whole new world
[56:38.060 --> 56:41.740]  man and woman create the whole new future do things together it's so powerful they're attacking
[56:41.740 --> 56:49.500]  it here's this evil song according to the sick left here it is i really can't maybe it's cold outside

[57:57.100 --> 58:00.620]  don't consist of the things that are enumerated on a piece of paper it consists of the things that

[58:05.180 --> 58:11.500]  are prohibitions they're prohibitions against powerful organizations and individuals taking
[58:11.500 --> 58:16.060]  those god-given rights from us as individuals you better understand that because they're taking
[58:16.060 --> 58:24.140]  them right now we have seen what they want to do they called it un-agent 21 now they call it the
[58:24.140 --> 58:30.380]  un-2030 agenda they want everybody off of the rural lands they want people out of the suburbs they

[01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:35.580]  getting more excited what don't you see how can you do this thing to me they're bound to be talked to
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.820]  how can you do this thing don't worry they're bearing on radio stations they don't care about
[01:00:39.820 --> 01:00:45.420]  the radicals lamas is raping and murdering women worldwide it's back to un is funding it
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:50.700]  here's john bounds report your phone calls are coming up this is key beto and cortez are the
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:58.140]  future here it is it only took 24 hours for these smug democrats and mockingbird media to
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:01:05.500]  circle their wagons after the honduran caravan storm the border and border patrol responded
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:13.180]  with non-lethal force 2020 presidential hopeful beto or orc weighed in claiming it should tell us
[01:01:13.180 --> 01:01:19.500]  something about her home country that a mother is willing to travel 2000 miles with her four month
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:26.700]  old son to come here it should tell us something about our country that we only respond to this
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:33.260]  desperate need once she is at our border beto either doesn't do his homework or chooses to
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:40.460]  ignore the billions in aid us aid is given to honduras over the years in 2017 alone the us gave
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:47.500]  181 million to the honduras and of course we know for a fact due to the courageous efforts of
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:56.140]  project veritas that beto's campaign aided the caravan meanwhile rising bullhorn for the socialist
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:03.740]  democrats alexandria ocasio-cortez compared the caravan to the holocaust senator lindsay graham
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:10.540]  responded saying ocasio-cortez should take a tour of the holocaust museum in dc and might help her
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:18.700]  better understand the differences between the holocaust and the caravan in tijuana cortez responded
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:25.740]  by defining america's defense of its borders as a rise in fascism writing this administration
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:31.820]  has jailed children and violated human rights perhaps we should stop pretending that authoritarianism
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:39.180]  and violence is a historical event instead of a growing force the washington times reports the same
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:44.700]  tear gas agents that the trump administration is taking heat for deploying against the border mob
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:50.380]  is actually used fairly frequently including more than once a month during the later years of
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:56.220]  president brocco obama's administration according to homeland security data u.s. customs and border
[01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:05.500]  protection has used c.s. since 2010 and deployed it 26 times in the fiscal 2012 and 27 times in
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:14.060]  2013 the use dropped after that but was still deployed three times in 2016 mr. obama's final
[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:19.660]  full year in office this whole but obama did it but obama did it i don't care what obama did i don't
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:25.420]  care what trump is doing right here right now what kind of parent drags their kid into the fray
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:31.900]  of confronting a heavily guarded u.s. border anyway meanwhile according to north carolinians
[01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:39.340]  for immigration reform and enforcement there was yet another month of child rape in october of 2018
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:46.940]  22 illegal aliens were arrested for 81 child rapes and or sexual assaults then courtes attempted to
[01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:54.140]  stick it to the man deeming graham a racist saying i heard your joke about ethnic dna preferences
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:04:00.780]  last month perhaps you would enjoy a visit or revisit to the smithsonian museum of african
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:06.860]  american history and culture it's a great educational experience this after graham
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:13.100]  joked on a fox news panel about possibly learning his dna would turn out to be partly iranian
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:19.580]  you know courtes i ran death to america it has zero to do with the african american history museum
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:26.220]  but thanks for playing the race card from your stack deck of elizkiite cards and better the golden
[01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:32.300]  dud for the democratic bid for senate seat in texas is pushing his presidential aspirations
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:37.660]  even though democratic failure rama manuel has said that you don't promote a loser in becoming
[01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:44.780]  a rork in courtes i will never grow tired exposing their treasonous and anti-american
[01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:51.180]  rhetoric for what it is an ongoing threat to american citizens their children and our national
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:05:01.340]  security john bough reporting the globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen
[01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:06.620]  and pump the environment from the bad halogen's fluoride chlorine bromine you name it that it
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:12.620]  lowers iq it literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:18.860]  the best iodine in the world we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:22.780]  that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:28.460]  it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been
[01:05:28.460 --> 01:05:34.300]  incredible now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:39.500]  more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed us the
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:45.580]  research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:51.820]  super charges it and makes it even more bio available ladies and gentlemen you want to
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:06:00.300]  research it you want to see it it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at enforce live.com
[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:08.300]  waging war on corruption
[01:06:10.540 --> 01:06:16.380]  it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:22.220]  well i'm not going to sit here and try to carry favor with the globalist george herbert
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:28.300]  walker bush was an absolutely horrible evil man who hated this country sold us out to communist
[01:06:28.300 --> 01:06:34.460]  china tried to set a bunch of oligarchs up to suck russia dry tried to prop up the old soviet union
[01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:40.300]  total neural order trash but i'm not glad he's dead i don't wish harm on the dead
[01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:45.580]  but he's a major signpost his death along with the clinton's and a marine doubt article about
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:50.300]  how no one is going to their rallies they'll get a 20 000 person deal they can't even sell
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:55.900]  a thousand tickets they are a joke so this just shows how the whole corporate media and all of it
[01:06:55.900 --> 01:07:03.420]  is just backing these corrupt fossils that were able to hijack our country and i see it as a signpost
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.980]  of what's happened to him but then you see them attacking our president trying to plunge our economy
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:12.220]  saying america was never great will never be that great this is their world government program
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:17.820]  there are riots all over france at this time not the muslims rioting like they do every week but
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:23.020]  the british the british people are rebelling the french people are rebelling the italian people
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:30.380]  are are are rebelling the brazilian folks are rebelling people don't want to be under globalism
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:37.340]  and the worst riot since the 60s hit france and this isn't the muslims so they're not going around
[01:07:37.340 --> 01:07:41.580]  burning other you know french people's houses and robbing them like the muslims do they're
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:49.340]  targeting the government so it's on because macron has totally opened their borders and
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:55.340]  sold them out all right i'm taking your phone calls right now but i'm going to go to each person
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:08:00.220]  in about a minute because i want to get to everybody today and i'm going to move the next
[01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:03.980]  person no matter how good your call is or how bad it is i'm going the next person i love you
[01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:08.060]  all i appreciate you but we're talking about what does george herbert walker bush's death
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:13.580]  signify what do you make of the incredible historic fight we're in the federal reserves
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:18.380]  attempts to implode the economy that bush uh and you know others had basically sold out along
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:24.460]  with clinton and obama and then trump comes along and in two years turns it around so the
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:28.220]  federal reserve comes in and raises interest rates seven times and trump warrants that'll kill
[01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:33.980]  the economy and sure enough it's begun when all trump's doing is trying to get us a fair shake
[01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:39.500]  with these unfair trade deals it's really crazy but they see us as nuts for being nationalists
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.660]  and not being sellouts so who we're going to go to we're going to chase the patriot
[01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:51.980]  then ryan then devin then brad then david and george and jason and everybody else it's holding
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:56.460]  and again we have a phone system that takes more than 20 calls but i have a new thing where
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.540]  we're going to take 10 if i get to those we'll open the phones back up and take the next 10
[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:06.380]  but i'm not going to leave callers on hold that's my new pet peeve again i'm all shown with info wars
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:10.220]  dot com and news wars dot com the globalists are doing everything they can to shut us down
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:16.060]  they're lying about us to build a straw man then they're moving against us on every platform and
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:20.700]  if they're successful at shutting us down the globalists admit they think they can then shut
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:25.500]  all of you down so our fight is your fight so please keep us in your prayers whatever you do
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:32.060]  the word of mouth you engage in about news wars dot com about info wars dot com is unstoppable
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:37.420]  they tried to psychologically poison people against info wars poison the well create a
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.900]  inoculation they call it psychologically so that you won't look at what we cover
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:50.220]  again they create a facsimile a dummy a straw man of who we are not what we really say but those of
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:54.140]  you that have stood with us we really salute you because we stand with you as well and
[01:09:54.140 --> 01:09:58.380]  somebody's got to fill the space of not being a trader somebody's got to stand against globalists
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:05.980]  okay who's up first here we've got devin and ryan and chase let's go ahead and talk to chase the
[01:10:05.980 --> 01:10:12.780]  patriot in california go ahead chase alex thank you so much for taking my call and thanks again
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:17.980]  for making that t-shirt commercial the previous call yes sir hey i want to yes i want to talk
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:23.180]  you know this war against globalism you know the difference between the bushes who were promoting it
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:28.780]  and what we see from president trump today you can see at the g20 unit i just filed a report on
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:35.100]  my youtube about this you think about those globalists that are there like paul kagami is invited
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:42.220]  the warlord ruthless leader of africa of rwanda he's sitting there making deals with china and
[01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:48.300]  all these other globalists but we at least have one lion one champion we have donald trump president
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:53.340]  trump looking him face to face eye to eye and saying things aren't going down the same way
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:58.220]  like the bushes and it's just such a night and day it's just beautiful to see sovereignty
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:03.660]  and americanism promoted again worldwide well remember the media about a year and a half ago
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:08.380]  was telling the truth they said it was a bad thing they go they go trump does whatever he says he's
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:13.500]  crazy now oh he's a liar he's a fraud but the washington post cnn all have the same talking
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:19.260]  point george hw bush was the exact political opposite of don trump yeah he was a puppet he
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.900]  was a globalist he was a sellout he hated the country you know he was connected to the nazis
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:28.140]  it's all the opposite with trump and i'm not here to kiss trump's ass i don't get
[01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:35.500]  any support for supporting trump i get lawsuits i get threats i get attacks i get lies i get
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:42.140]  demonized because he's a good guy and he does care about the country so but oh i supported george
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:48.060]  herbert walker bush oh i supported let me tell you something i had the clinton's reach out i had
[01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:52.860]  the bushes reach out when i was first on air they collect talk show hosts like they collect
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:12:00.060]  that's a joke photo like they collect baseball cards and i'm not for sale god bless you chase
[01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:08.940]  good to hear from you all right up next here who is up next let's talk to david in the center of
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:14.780]  the cancer the part of california invading america the main censorship command base
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:19.100]  david in san francisco man how do you survive out there thanks for calling
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:26.700]  well but the grace of god that's how i exist now i like this it's possible if we can just
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:31.820]  have a moment of silence and respect for my words about bush i think it would be
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:39.020]  uh appreciated um now there's a there's a reason why nancy reagan didn't want to talk
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:44.860]  to the bushes uh after her husband almost got killed there's a reason why the bushes
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:52.140]  stay uh voted with hillary not the president and it's found in roger stone's book called
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:57.660]  the bush crime family in the franklin cover-up by senator john de camp have you read this book
[01:12:57.660 --> 01:13:05.660]  well you wanted a moment of silence so go ahead you know i i mean after i'm done just have a minute
[01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:10.700]  or two for the people to think about what i said because you know i respect the truth okay and the
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:17.180]  truth is the truth and he bush senior said he has no memory where he was at november 22nd
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.580]  don't give me that line i was at her lady mount carmel in first grade everyone was old enough
[01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:27.340]  to remember if they know exactly where they were at when kennedy was killed okay and the fact is he
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:33.500]  took over for the cia after bill colby died in a mysterious fishing accident okay and he was in

[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:54.220]  transmission i'm alex jones your host it's 5 20 central standard time very thankful to all the
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:59.340]  listeners and supporters and radio and tv stations that know the corporate globalist media are a
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:03.580]  bunch of anti-american trash that have totally sold this country out and they know everything
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:09.340]  they say about us is a lie a damn lie and our support with the general public and radio and
[01:21:09.340 --> 01:21:15.580]  tv stations has only gone up in the face of silicon valley absolutely blocking us at every level
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:21.100]  trying to shut down our bank accounts trying to find out what software we use hack attacks you name
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:27.980]  it because i'm a loyal american who believes in freedom i don't want to go join some cartel and
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:32.380]  go kiss the ass of the establishment and get into the power structure and sit around with a bunch
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:39.100]  of heartless soulless people you couldn't pay me to join them you couldn't threaten to kill me to
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:46.060]  join them you understand it's not hard to not sell out to them what's hard is feeling weak
[01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:51.180]  that i'm not fighting them enough because they are totally ruthless and evil they ally themselves
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:56.860]  with the most horrible communist chinese regimes and others and they think those of us that have
[01:21:56.860 --> 01:22:03.020]  conscience are mentally ill and then when we kick their political butts up and down the street
[01:22:04.540 --> 01:22:08.300]  they move to censor us and block us and that's when the frustration comes
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:14.140]  that my fellow americans and others don't realize what an incredible juncture crossroads we are in
[01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:21.980]  history it's an incredible time and then if you study trump's real policies he is swinging for the
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:29.180]  fences for sovereignty and freedom and prosperity and working so hard
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:38.940]  with true programs to unify this nation so i am honored to be persecuted for supporting trump
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:45.180]  i'm not hedging my back i've been told
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.700]  hell all over the place you've seen it you back off you don't support trump we're gonna
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.300]  destroy you and they just keep escalating they're like you want more you want more
[01:22:54.300 --> 01:23:00.780]  you know i don't want more but i'm not backing down you understand in fact i'm far from breaking
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:09.100]  me i'm out of broke 15 years ago because i wasn't a trillion percent sure i was 100
[01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:13.260]  percent right now i know i was beyond right in fact you guys are so much worse than i thought
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:19.580]  let me tell you i'll let me let me just give you the little message ain't ever happening ever
[01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:28.620]  period but then i look at the average man i know over some petty crap acted tough saying
[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:32.460]  your car's got a bigger engine guys are getting to fight with you but if it's the whole birthright
[01:23:32.460 --> 01:23:37.980]  of their kids their whole future and they see as the establishment they just roll over and it's
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:44.460]  sick and it makes me depressed and then i gotta watch john mccain that globalist trader and
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:49.820]  george herbert walker bush even worse sit there and be lauded when these are the authors of
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:58.300]  the sellout of our country makes me sick but the good news is all over the world people are waking up
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:07.340]  in all over the world momentum is moving against the new world order and so that's the
[01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:14.620]  solace i've got dead people say oh i've sacrificed my life for freedom well you're gonna get a chance
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:21.260]  to them your name your treasure who you are and who cares of a bunch of slaves of the system
[01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:28.060]  get in your face who cares those are victims those are brain dead followers that's what leadership is
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:32.460]  is being willing to do things that are hard on the surface but you know what committing my
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:36.700]  children and your children to total slavery to the new world order is a lot harder
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:46.300]  than losing everything i got and my personal name because while they're busy destroying my name
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:53.180]  the world's busy waking up now they do want to end up using my name as a weapon against
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:58.380]  the liberty movement so it's important to stand up for impoverished but it doesn't matter to me
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:04.780]  what happens to me and that's not some statement of oh i'm such a loving giving guy i'm in a total
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:10.380]  war and i just want the enemy to know they're always like how do you like hundreds of thousands
[01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:14.700]  articles saying horrible things about you that's what i expected i mean i never knew i'd be this
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:21.580]  successful but um it's just wonderful actually and they've already figured that out they just
[01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:26.060]  want other people to see what's been done to me and have them back away from promoting freedom
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:34.300]  but when those people are cowards they don't help the globalists they just create a vacuum
[01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:41.900]  where other people who are called by the spirit of liberty fill that gap so when we come back
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:46.380]  from break the last two segments i'm going to take every call that's holding rick ryan devin
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:52.780]  bill brad jason nick george we're going to all of you but the big news this week that just came in
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:58.380]  like a blip and left well trump sent out that tweet about indicting the deep staters with images of
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:04.460]  comey and miller and hillary for being in bed with russia and saying he was and engaged in treason
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:07.820]  and then i told you he was going to make his move last sunday before he did that on monday
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:15.820]  and the next day he he said these are criminals they work for foreign powers they want to overthrow
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:21.340]  the country i'm trying to restore it and they're going to be devastated by what i'm going to release
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:29.740]  and you know the one thing about trump is he always keeps his promises and so i feel good
[01:26:29.740 --> 01:26:40.940]  at a deep gut level god's never forsaken us but i said us it doesn't forsake if i get killed or
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:47.580]  thrown in prison or demonized on every tv channel out there as long as god doesn't forsake the children
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:52.620]  it's our job as men
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:27:01.820]  to the right thing and again what i'm saying a hundred years ago was common exercise in the west
[01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:08.380]  many other cultures cover their ass and they're called slaves but people stand up for liberty
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:11.980]  and freedom and they're willing to put their lives on the line that's called civilization
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:18.860]  and so i am extremely blessed to be here with you i'm very honored to be here and i'm very thankful
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:26.300]  to everybody that supports us and the crew and i just for christmas i want an enlightenment
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:32.300]  and i want to have people realize that what trump's doing is in their clear self-interest
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:38.380]  and the right thing to do and that buying into hollywood hype and corporate hype is is a joke
[01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:44.700]  because these people are not caring about you they hate trump because he he isn't selling you out with
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:51.820]  them we're gonna break come right back with your calls please do not forget that without your financial

[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:44.380]  like Jeff Bezos that is your vote for freedom and your vote that we continue to stand in the

[01:29:02.460 --> 01:29:06.940]  info wars is being openly targeted by the democratic party left to cia operatives the
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:12.060]  corrupt justice department and the entire sorrows crime syndicate people say why would you start a
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:17.260]  fight with them because they were already dominating and running america into the ground and i knew we
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:22.780]  had no future we didn't do this so we've already had incredible success but if you will simply
[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:27.820]  realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made

[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:16.940]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory functions in the 1960s
[01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:22.140]  researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal
[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:28.140]  immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in public trials and decades
[01:32:28.140 --> 01:32:33.420]  later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet that helps the
[01:32:33.420 --> 01:32:38.940]  alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is not an
[01:32:38.940 --> 01:32:44.220]  antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity

[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:05.260]  let's go ahead and talk to brad in the great state of texas brad thanks for calling welcome
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:13.980]  hey thank you so much for taking my call alex earlier you were talking about um uh how how
[01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:20.220]  george bush had faked the fall of communism in eastern europe and the ussr that's really interesting
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:26.140]  because most people don't know about this what really happened was back in november of 1989
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:34.940]  the communist parties of a chex vivakia hungry etc they all stayed in power but renamed themselves
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:40.380]  to the socialist party and the dictators had stepped down and then number two in the party
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:46.780]  would come to power and then that person was in bed with the world economic forum the devos
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:51.580]  group the builder bird group etc well let's let's sit you're saying history and you're accurate so
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:57.420]  far let me just give it to folks because this is on what i'm saying is like a fact george soros
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:35:06.140]  was given billions by george herbert walker bush to go in and go no don't go free market
[01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:11.820]  stay socialist let us loot your people because the soviet union was collapsing and then then they
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:17.740]  tried to prop up the soviet union even front line has released the transcripts where george w bush
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:21.980]  didn't know george herbert walker bush didn't know it was falling they were trying to keep
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:28.300]  gorbachev and prop it up they wanted a fake perestroika where they still kept it under socialism
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:33.660]  just not communism and the west could loot it and they kind of got that for a while uh with you know
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:39.500]  the next guy uh that came in boris yeltsin but then putin threw them all out and that's why
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:45.180]  they're so pissed at putin go ahead absolutely well putin was actually put in power by western
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:50.220]  intelligence but then about a year later he totally flipped on the globalist and started
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:55.500]  sending people like uh uh roman abramovich and of course he was never put in power by him but he
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:36:01.340]  did fool them yes he did fool him and that's why they're so pissed yeah but the whole idea was
[01:36:01.900 --> 01:36:09.100]  you have to you have to uh be through with the old union to then put in the new union the european
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:15.020]  union and the european union was gonna which then took all the former heads of eastern europe
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:21.660]  communists literally almost every e you had is either a former top nazi or their kid or a former
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:28.380]  head of an eastern european country it's crazy that's absolutely right alex now beautifully
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:33.580]  said brad and and that's why putin's evil that's why netanyahu's evil that's why trump's evil is
[01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:39.660]  because they're all nationalist the average right wing lunatic that the super right winger believes
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:45.420]  israel runs everything israel's left right like eight different groups netanyahu is literally
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:50.060]  defending his country they're trying to and david died his wife they're trying to indict him just
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:56.220]  like trump because they're nationalist and so putin respects netanyahu because they're nationalist
[01:36:56.220 --> 01:37:00.460]  trump respects putin and netanyahu because they're nationalists they respect him just like the new
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:06.060]  leaders in italy and the new leaders in greece and the new leaders in in in brazil they're all
[01:37:06.060 --> 01:37:11.580]  different people but they're standing up against the globalists which are trying to kill them
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:17.020]  and like oh my god i get death threats from white supremacist constantly they're just such idiots
[01:37:17.020 --> 01:37:21.900]  man it's totally different than what they even think they have no idea how it works anything else
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:28.140]  brad well if they would just go research israel and if they found out the truth they would find
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:32.860]  out that israel was put there for destruction to start a future war exactly and and and that came
[01:37:32.860 --> 01:37:37.580]  out in the wiki leaks which we already knew that they planned to overthrow it and then caused a
[01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:44.060]  giant war and netanyahu's trying to stop that so again you always wonder like why does the media
[01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:50.860]  demonize netanyahu here's an example i'm not a rocket scientist but about seven years ago i finally
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:56.860]  went when i bashed cops doing wrong i get 10 million youtube views they never demonetized
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:03.340]  and i sometimes i get 300 000 checks but everything else is demonetized when i talk about the new
[01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:09.180]  world order and i went oh my god they they're demonizing police selectively to take them over
[01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:13.420]  which will be later confirmed so i stopped bashing cops and that was the last deal for them
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:18.540]  because i finally went i was literally didn't know it she like you think you don't sell out
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:22.460]  you don't know you've sold out you have bashing police and it doesn't mean cops aren't out of
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:27.180]  control and there's some problems the point is in general they wanted me to bash cops and the
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:33.180]  left was promoting me as soon as we stop we lost like five million a year on youtube let me again
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:39.020]  their project is bashed the cops not to reform them but to then overthrow them see how that works
[01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:43.100]  and it's the same deal like the average right winger or left winger come together and hating
[01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:49.340]  israel you do that you get promoted on youtube everywhere else because again it's all part of
[01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:55.180]  a larger plan isn't that sick yeah that's absolutely sick and all they do well if you
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:39:00.140]  look at david duke he goes to say ron iran it gives us speeches saying how bad the united
[01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:05.820]  states is in israel is i mean iran oh and notice he's not and i'm not saying take him off he's all
[01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:13.740]  over youtube he's all over everywhere and yeah exactly last thing the bullets were also put
[01:39:13.740 --> 01:39:19.340]  in power by the globalist at a last minute deal by 79 told exactly and here's the deal
[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:23.340]  david duke's still on air and all these other people because they create division
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:29.500]  every black people hispanics they all love me i love them i want freedom and they cannot have
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:35.340]  somebody like me or trump who is literally trump who opened golf courses up to jews and black people
[01:39:35.340 --> 01:39:39.660]  he was the guy that did that and then they turned around he's the nazi no these people are using
[01:39:39.660 --> 01:39:45.180]  race-based politics and i'm look i don't i don't put ferrican in the same camp as as as as duke
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:50.620]  ferrican wants to try to not have a race war now but everything he says positive gets ignored
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:57.740]  and it's a very complex situation god bless you i appreciate your call and folks we're we're getting
[01:39:57.740 --> 01:40:05.980]  to the heart of the matter here you know this gets very complex but i just oh god you know the
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:12.460]  it it's a bad situation that's all i can tell you it's a very bad situation and the globalists
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:18.140]  have bet that you're weak and stupid they think you're morons and it's just i mean my god the most
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:22.860]  hot thing ever since i've been on air is bashing jews in israel israel is a bunch of people at
[01:40:22.860 --> 01:40:29.980]  each other's throats there's eight different factions at least and i'm not defending israel
[01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:36.380]  but it's mentally ill to claim israel is this big thing running stuff that ain't what's going on
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:43.020]  and i don't say that to defend israel i was in hollywood trying to make movies 15 years ago
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:48.620]  now here from top producers the chinese won't like that and then i when i met with a bunch of
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:55.020]  top producers and major lawyers i went on air like 12 years ago and said china's buying hollywood
[01:40:55.020 --> 01:41:01.500]  and man they had the white supremacist go nuts they go oh my god you liar it's the jews and all
[01:41:01.500 --> 01:41:06.700]  this stuff and i was just like oh yeah it's the jews it italians but italians almost much of the
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:11.020]  jews too by the way i mean i think they used to keep their head down you gotta you go to hollywood
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:14.460]  the highest level there's a bunch of italian guys and they ain't playing games okay let's put
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:19.100]  you that way they all went legit let's say the last 50 years they run hollywood so it's the yeah
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:22.860]  jewish groups are powerful hollywood there's no doubt about that and then you've got the italians
[01:41:22.860 --> 01:41:26.940]  but let me tell you who's buying it up it's the chikoms well now that's vanity fair it's associated
[01:41:26.940 --> 01:41:34.140]  press it's hollywood reporter china owns a whole damn thing man and not the chinese people but the
[01:41:34.140 --> 01:41:41.020]  chikom commies man they killed a hundred plus million people hitler only killed 30 something
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:47.580]  he's a horrible guy so that's where this has gone so crazy so i live this life i'm not complaining
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:53.900]  who are liberals confront me in the street white supremacist hate me black supremacist
[01:41:53.900 --> 01:42:00.780]  mexican supremacist are a lot to give me and all i want is freedom i want to unify everybody
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:06.300]  around free market and prosperity and space travel and life extension everybody getting along
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:11.740]  we all go out on the golf course and play golf together like trump but see he's the nazi
[01:42:11.740 --> 01:42:20.220]  just like i am and i sit there and read the adl scumbag liars man saying i'm anti- israel
[01:42:20.220 --> 01:42:25.260]  when they know full well they're funded by soros who in the wiki leaks wants to destroy israel
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:30.700]  and his damn son and you know it's personal for me all the stuff they've done to us
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:36.940]  but the personal thing and i don't feel sorry for myself i'm sorry because i face his billions
[01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:42.620]  but i just don't want to lose that's why it's personal now they call him a holocaust survivor
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:47.340]  that i'm attacking when he said he doesn't believe in jojoba and and doesn't care about jews and
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:51.820]  don't round him up and he doesn't believe israel's exist and then that monster now calls me anti-

[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:11.020]  they got their new world order they're they're almost there but if we had if if the good people
