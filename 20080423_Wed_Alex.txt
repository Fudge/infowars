[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:18.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome. The very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:24.000 --> 00:33.000]  It is the 21st day of April 2008 on this live Wednesday edition. We'll be here for the
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  next four hours from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[00:38.000 --> 00:43.000]  Luke Radowski will be joining us in 30 minutes to talk about the arrest of two We Are Change
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  activists in New York City for engaging in the First Amendment.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  We have some amazing audio of the Secret Service. We're going to be playing coming up
[00:51.000 --> 00:58.000]  before he joins us. Then in an hour and a half, Bob Chapman will pop in for an hour with his weekly
[00:58.000 --> 01:04.000]  roving visit to talk about the deteriorating, the ongoing deterioration of the global economy
[01:04.000 --> 01:12.000]  by design. And then from 1.30, or from the middle of the third hour into the fourth hour,
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  Richard Reeves does camera work for us. He's also in some of our shoots driven for us.
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.000]  Sounds easy. It's actually hard running around cities while we jump out with cameras.
[01:23.000 --> 01:29.000]  And he has worked with the Ron Paul campaign, and he's really into this whole delegate thing,
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  so I thought we'd have him on to explain the different strategies and ideas for Ron Paul
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  in the convention and what people are really talking about doing, what the different camps are.
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.000]  So that should be quite illuminating to try to bring some method to the madness so people
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  understand exactly what they're up to. So Richard Reeves will be in studio to talk about that issue
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  and a couple of other things with us coming up from the middle of the third hour into the fourth hour.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  Then I'm going to have another news blitz the last 30 minutes of that fourth hour today as well.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  People seem to like that yesterday when I covered about 35 news articles in 30 minutes.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  Okay, let me just say this. I don't boss Luke Radowski around. I don't boss we are Change LA
[02:12.000 --> 02:18.000]  or we are Change Colorado or we are Change Ireland or any of these groups.
[02:18.000 --> 02:22.000]  A lot of them call me up and say, hey, Schwarzenegger's coming tomorrow. What should we say to him?
[02:22.000 --> 02:27.000]  And I would, I said, well, bring up his belt buckle that why do you wear Nazi belt buckles on TV?
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  And on the cover of Time magazine when your dad was a Nazi, why do you not repudiate the SS officer
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  who killed American troops Kurt Valtime? You've refused repudiate him. Why are you a Nazi lover?
[02:39.000 --> 02:51.000]  And if you had more time, you know, why do you, why do you, you know, say that you admire Hitler?
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  We need to embarrass this monster. And they did do that. I'm told that video is coming out in the next day or two.
[02:57.000 --> 03:02.000]  But they only call me about once a week. Different groups call me ask what my opinion is.
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  I am not in control of these organizations. They're not even control themselves.
[03:06.000 --> 03:14.000]  These are true grassroots movements. And it's unstoppable because there's so many facets and arms and different manifestations of it
[03:14.000 --> 03:19.000]  that it's hard for the enemy to set them up or track or trace all of them.
[03:19.000 --> 03:28.000]  That said, I have told my crew, I have told listeners, I have told Luke, I have told them all that this is under mafia rules
[03:28.000 --> 03:31.000]  with the Bushes and the Clintons and others.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.000]  And if you've ever worked for the government or you've ever worked for the CIA or FBI or even as a postal person,
[03:37.000 --> 03:43.000]  they have a weird sick rule that if you criticize them, they will send hit teams to kill you.
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.000]  But if you've never worked for them, this is just what I've found and been told by government people and studied throughout history.
[03:49.000 --> 04:00.000]  It's a weird cultural tribal rule. They tend to leave you alone to a certain extent, to a greater extent, if you leave their families alone.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  You see, I want my family left alone, too.
[04:03.000 --> 04:11.000]  I mess with the kingpins, I mess with the men, or I mess with women who've got pants on like Hillary Clinton who are trying to take my liberties and freedoms.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  I do not mess with their squaws.
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.000]  Now, I'm not saying we are changes bad, but I did last week when I heard they were going to do this, I said, bad idea, don't do it.
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  I talked about it a lot in the office. I said, I'm worried about it.
[04:23.000 --> 04:28.000]  And people are like, well, it's just politely going up and bringing up, you know, the fact that...
[04:28.000 --> 04:38.000]  And overall, I think it's a good thing to do, but you're going to see totally different actions from the establishment when you do that.
[04:38.000 --> 04:47.000]  So just as a rule, leave the mafia dons, wives and daughters and sons alone.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  Leave them completely alone. We'll be right back.
[04:51.000 --> 04:58.000]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird Group.
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  What their objective being world domination?
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[05:12.000 --> 05:20.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000]  That's their after easy.

[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  You can trace every disease, every illness and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[05:58.000 --> 06:02.000]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained and utilized than have heated,
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  the champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients, your body craves.
[06:12.000 --> 06:16.000]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[06:16.000 --> 06:20.000]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins and trace minerals.
[06:20.000 --> 06:26.000]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness,
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[06:30.000 --> 06:35.000]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  Put the champion juicer to work for you and your family.
[06:38.000 --> 06:43.000]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy fresh flower.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  The champion juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  The world's finest juicer is champion juicer.
[06:50.000 --> 07:14.000]  Ask for it at your favorite health food store online today.
[07:23.000 --> 07:26.000]  Protogrow is a proprietary blend of full-spectrum nutrients from the sea.
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  It literally contains the basic building blocks of life itself.
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  In fact, protogrow is so effective at producing rapid plant growth in record time
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  that it almost forces plants to grow even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  It's also perfect for growing your own survival foods and might just be the ultimate hard times barter item.

[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[07:57.000 --> 08:02.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:02.000 --> 08:09.000]  I'm just telling all activists this, whether they're 9-11 Truth, We Are Change, M4 Wars groups.
[08:09.000 --> 08:14.000]  I'm not making a moral judgment.
[08:14.000 --> 08:32.000]  It's kind of like I'm a navigation system on a boat with GPS telling you where there are rocks right underneath the surface where dangerous shoals are.
[08:32.000 --> 08:40.000]  And you're going to get a different response even if you are 100 yards away from Laura Bush and one of her daughters.
[08:40.000 --> 08:46.000]  And even if you are polite, you are going to be physically attacked, you are going to be set up, you are going to go to jail.
[08:46.000 --> 08:52.000]  And God forbid you get video or photos of the daughters falling down drunk on each other.
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.000]  You're going to be mailed weaponized US government super anthrax and you're going to die.
[08:57.000 --> 09:01.000]  And the news is going to say Al Qaeda did it.
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  Now later, the History Channel will come out and admit the government did it as they've now done.
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  That's right.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  But that's kind of just a threat to everyone. Hey, we mail anthrax out.
[09:10.000 --> 09:12.000]  We bomb innocent countries.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  We attack skyscrapers with remote control aircraft.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  We kill you slaves.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  And they're totally arrogant.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  They're full of bravada, hootspa, whatever you want to call it.
[09:23.000 --> 09:29.000]  And it's hard to get their attention as they're busy destroying the planet and murdering people in mass.
[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  The only way you can get it is by going up and messing with their women.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  And, you know, I mean, they're maids, they're servants, they're babysitters.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  They're dying all the time, getting run over, being found in the Kenny Bunkport water.
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  I mean, every year or so another member of the household gets killed because they just smart off or say something.
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.000]  I mean, these are dangerous, dangerous, dangerous killers.
[09:54.000 --> 09:55.000]  Just look at their women.
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  I mean, they look like completely crazed satanic maniacs.
[10:01.000 --> 10:11.000]  Remember Barbara Bush, George Herbert Walker Bush's wife on Larry King Live, what was it, 2002?
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  She was saying, leave my family alone.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  You can criticize George or anybody you want, but you criticize any of my family.
[10:18.000 --> 10:19.000]  You will, you are dead.
[10:19.000 --> 10:21.000]  And Larry King said, what do you mean?
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  I've got to pull that.
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  We have a transcript of that.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  We wrote an article about it on infowars.com.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  And Larry King said, what do you mean?
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  She said, what I just said, we will kill you.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  I mean, they publicly say they'll commit murder on national television.
[10:34.000 --> 10:37.000]  So just to understand that, I've told a story of my buddy.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  It was actually Kevin Booth.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  We still lived here in Austin.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  It was his wife, Trey's 40th birthday.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  So we were at City Grill Steakhouse downtown.
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  And this is like three months after 9-11.
[10:50.000 --> 10:59.000]  And all of a sudden, all of a sudden, we were walking in and these federal marshals
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  freaked out and they go, Alex Jones, I was just listening to you on the radio today.
[11:03.000 --> 11:04.000]  What are you doing here?
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  And I said, what are you doing here?
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  And he goes, I'm not allowed to say, but just, just please let them eat in peace.
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.000]  So I go in.
[11:12.000 --> 11:13.000]  It's a big restaurant.
[11:13.000 --> 11:14.000]  Guess where they sit us.
[11:14.000 --> 11:16.000]  I'm wondering who it is.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  They seat us right next to the Bush daughters.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  Who are drinking.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  I think they hadn't turned 21 yet.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  They're drinking wine.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  There were two heavy metal guys with devil tattoos all over them.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  And they're looking at me and I don't look at them.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  I just try to give them the vibe of I don't see you.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  And Kevin's like, I've got a camera in the car.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  I've got a video camera in the car.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  I'm going to videotape them, put it on the web.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  And I said, yeah, you might as well just go jump out in front of traffic.
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  Do you want Bush to mail weaponized anthrax to you?
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  Remember where the first anthrax letter went of the most weaponized grade US patented coated
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.000]  in bentonite and not just coated little microscopic wings had been attached to each spore.
[12:04.000 --> 12:05.000]  Okay.
[12:05.000 --> 12:08.000]  Only patented by the US super advanced.
[12:08.000 --> 12:17.000]  It was mailed directly to American media, the owners of the inquire to the editor who
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  was the one that paid to have camera people follow the Bush daughters.
[12:21.000 --> 12:29.000]  And it was mailed to his office and he died of respiratory failure from the anthrax US
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  government weapon off.
[12:31.000 --> 12:39.000]  Then Dashrell and other Democratic leaders got mailed it, al-Qaeda mailed it to the anti-war people.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  Oh my God, what is it?
[12:40.000 --> 12:41.000]  What is it you won't buy?
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  It's kind of like they just chopped up that Palestinian school teacher here in Austin
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  for mailing school books to Palestinians.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  Just chop him up in public, tie him up, ground him, have the cops take him out of suicide.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  Just a bit of message to everybody.
[12:54.000 --> 13:03.000]  The cattle will still believe that you tie yourself up and gag yourself and cut yourself up in pieces and throw yourself in the water.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  And but to the rest of us that understand what's going on.
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  I mean, why would massage run around in his front yard with machine guns?
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  The neighbors have now confirmed.
[13:13.000 --> 13:14.000]  Just it's all.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  So you know, yes, we're here.
[13:16.000 --> 13:23.000]  And why do you think Ariel Sharon told the AP and UPI we're going to kill US citizens on US soil.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  If you aid the Palestinians or if you get in the way of anything we're doing, it's a message.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  We will kill you.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  We rule you.
[13:31.000 --> 13:33.000]  You are slaves.
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  Period.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.000]  Now.
[13:40.000 --> 13:45.000]  I commend the amazing courage founding father level courage and we are changed.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  They are confronting sports and they're confronted carry this week.
[13:47.000 --> 13:53.000]  They are the main event in the new film 9 11 Chronicles.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Truth rising part one truth rising.
[13:55.000 --> 14:05.000]  I just am telling them where the rocks are and to leave the women of these mafia dons alone.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  Now, what happened then was an absolute outrage.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  Of course, it's a total violation of the First Amendment.
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.000]  The gang member like Secret Service are completely creepy.
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.000]  They say, we don't want to hear about your constitution.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  We got Luke coming on a few minutes.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Gary, one of the great guys that we are changed.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  You've seen many videos.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  He'll list a lot of facts calmly.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  I've seen him confront many people, including Robert Kennedy Jr.
[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  Where he just completely listed some facts.
[14:35.000 --> 14:43.000]  He did that as Barbara as Laura Bush and one of her daughters walked by.
[14:43.000 --> 14:47.000]  And a large man and we've talked to four different witnesses who saw it.
[14:47.000 --> 14:53.000]  Of course, people are so befuddled when it happened that one girl only had a snapshot camera and she dropped that.
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  They smashed Gary's camera.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  That's why we don't have it.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  We don't have the tape.
[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  Smash it destroyed it tapes gone.
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  And this huge guy just attacks Gary and starts pummeling.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  I mean, just beating the police then arrested.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  Gary stage the arrest of this guy.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  Let him go instantly at the police station.
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  He wrote him a note.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  Gary saw handed it to him.
[15:17.000 --> 15:19.000]  They let him go probably stage.
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  We're going to put the video of this guy up.
[15:22.000 --> 15:23.000]  I mean, it's still photos.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  One lady thinks she got still photos.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  And then they charged him with third degree assault.
[15:32.000 --> 15:40.000]  So then they also arrested Matt LaPasic who got into the event.
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  He's the guy who got arrested in New Hampshire for asking Giuliani a question.
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  Remember that all on video.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  Never touched the cops and the cops tried to charge him with assaulting them.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  Then they had to drop it.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  I mean, they think God was video of it or he'd be in prison right now.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  And the cops all stand around the video we've got and decide how to frame up Gary.
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  That's that's on video too.
[16:02.000 --> 16:08.000]  Remember, we have the police working with Larry Silverstein's goons walking up and saying, we're going to claim you've got bombs.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  We know you're not a terrorist, but we're going to put you in jail.
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  We're going to frame you if you don't leave.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.000]  Then Luke says, okay, I'll leave.
[16:16.000 --> 16:17.000]  Please don't frame me.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  And they say, no, it's too late for that.
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.000]  We're going to frame you now.
[16:23.000 --> 16:24.000]  That video is on the web.
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.000]  What do you see it in this film?
[16:25.000 --> 16:32.000]  The actual video on DVD, not, you know, a cruddy internet version.
[16:32.000 --> 16:39.000]  So we are changing Ireland on video, the guy shoves him in the back, runs around, shoves him in the face, chases one of them.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  This is a former, you know, guy tied in with the heavies in Ireland, very serious character.
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  Now EU Parliament members selling out sovereignty of Ireland.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  He is, he attacks them.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  He's chasing them.
[16:52.000 --> 16:57.000]  They give the video, audio, everything to the Sunday Times, BBC, they don't care.
[16:57.000 --> 17:09.000]  It's put out associated press TV in the US that a anti EU gang viciously attacks and steals the bag and beats and tackles and tortures.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  They didn't, they said everything about torture.
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  They implied it.
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  This poor innocent and then the police did nothing.
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  It was we are changed that called the police.
[17:19.000 --> 17:30.000]  So we're seeing the setups, we're seeing people show up with signs behind we are changed with international TV crews in tow.
[17:30.000 --> 17:48.000]  Fox News, BBC, you name it, with signs saying that we are changed that 911 truth was behind the bombing of the facility, the Army Navy Marine Corps Recruiting Center in Times Square, which itself was a big firecracker.
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  Which weeks before, Geraldo saying we're going to bomb or terrorist.
[17:52.000 --> 17:55.000]  And then he says that day, it's probably 911 truth.
[17:55.000 --> 18:00.000]  And then all the other shows parrot that and say we should quote be arrested and sent to camps and tortured.
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  Those are quotes to secret camps and tortured as a talking point.
[18:04.000 --> 18:21.000]  The government has their tops al-Qaeda men in al-Zahari come out and say that Israel, the US, no one's involved in 911, that 911 truth works for Ahmed Dinajid.
[18:21.000 --> 18:26.000]  Of course, it's just some fake audio tape put out by the Intel Center as usual.
[18:26.000 --> 18:34.000]  It never ends with Adam Pearlman slash Adam Goddana, the ADL openly doing al-Qaeda tapes, threatening everyone.
[18:34.000 --> 18:36.000]  I mean, how dumb do you think we are?
[18:36.000 --> 18:39.000]  So know this, we are changed.
[18:39.000 --> 18:45.000]  We are changed, use the peaceful black panthers of our day.
[18:45.000 --> 18:51.000]  But they're engaging in guerrilla information warfare and confronting the criminals and the traders of this country.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  And so they're trying to infiltrate you, they're trying to set you up right now.
[18:54.000 --> 18:57.000]  But there's too many chapters, we need to form more chapters.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  We need to form other groups under other names.
[18:59.000 --> 19:17.000]  We need to everybody go out and confront politicians so that our info war peaceful attack pattern cannot be analyzed or dealt with because it is completely organic and completely random with chaos theory and they can't respond even with their predictive computers.
[19:17.000 --> 19:19.000]  It's unpredictable.
[19:19.000 --> 19:28.000]  And then it continues to capture the media spotlight, capture media events, inject 9-11 truth into the consciousness as more and more big hitters go public.
[19:28.000 --> 19:37.000]  Presidents and prime ministers and governors and congresswomen and men, all going public saying it's an inside job.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  We're very close to bringing down the terrorist.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  Okay, but know this, we are changed on the front lines, ladies and gentlemen.
[19:44.000 --> 19:52.000]  In the second 1776 in the info war, they need your prayers now and they need to break off and leave the women alone.
[20:15.000 --> 20:21.000]  But now it's cancer's turn to die with lace med inks, patented methodology.

[21:03.000 --> 21:06.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.000]  What their objective being world domination?
[21:09.000 --> 21:12.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[21:12.000 --> 21:22.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[21:28.000 --> 21:32.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.

[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  Prisonplanet.tv
[23:53.000 --> 24:19.000]  The Bush crime family has made public statements repeatedly warning everyone to leave their family alone.
[24:19.000 --> 24:26.000]  And I'm not saying it's not your right in duty to go up and confront them and yell at them.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  I'm told it wouldn't even really yelling. You know, how do you feel knowing your husband?
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  Knowing that your father carried out the 9-11 attacks.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  These guys have got a lot of courage, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  A lot of courage.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  And I hope the White House doesn't double cap them all in the head. I hope they don't mail them anthrax and claim.
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  They'll have Al Zahari come out and claim he's behind it. It's just no end to these people.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  They're very dangerous.
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  I'm playing this to beat them, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  We need to grow the We Are Change chapters now. We need to confront every scumbag politician from local to national.
[25:05.000 --> 25:16.000]  And let's go ahead and start airing the audio of We Are Change while they're outside. They're about 50 yards away and they're coming over to some of the other members that didn't get arrested
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.000]  who are back further so they couldn't get it all on video telling them, you know, just get out of here or threatening to arrest them.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  Just goons and plain clothes not saying who they are.
[25:27.000 --> 25:29.000]  And again, it's all in the name of the president being safe.
[25:29.000 --> 25:38.000]  Oh, I have mainstream news articles here where in California, one million police cannot get drunk driving, cannot get tickets, are literal gods.
[25:38.000 --> 25:45.000]  See, it's all about their security. And they say it for 9-11. That's why it's just, it's our security. We're just better than you.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  It's all about this sick upper class.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  It goes government officials, cops, illegal aliens, and then down the bottom, citizens.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  Let's go ahead and air some of the audio from the video that's up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com right now.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  Not today. Not today.
[26:03.000 --> 26:07.000]  Well, you're staying right here. I was going to be on that side. All right?
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  You want to be on that side? Okay, you want to be on that side? I sort of think.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  Stop right there.
[26:12.000 --> 26:22.000]  So he politely, they're walking up towards the event and this guy in plain clothes comes over, Secret Service, and says, go over to that side.
[26:22.000 --> 26:28.000]  He just says, roll nicely. It's on video. Well, who are you? He says, who are you? How dare you ask me who I am?
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  I mean, go back to it.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  My name's Tom Flynn. I'm with the Secret Service. Who are you?
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  Because of my name, you have a driver's license?
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  Let me see your driver's license.
[26:42.000 --> 26:50.000]  Well, hey, you asked me my identification. Let me see your identification.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  Why do you need to see my identification? What was I doing wrong?
[26:53.000 --> 27:00.000]  Listen, in about two seconds, you're going over to the other sidewalk. In about two seconds, you're going over to the other sidewalk.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  But you understand why I asked you.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  And why you cannot ask me, because it's the law.
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  Are you kidding me? You're telling me the law?
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  I know the law.
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  All right, you stay right there.
[27:09.000 --> 27:10.000]  Okay.
[27:10.000 --> 27:15.000]  But what were you going to, I mean, were you going to sign up?
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  Am I touching you?
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  I mean, you can't tell me where I could go where I cannot go.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  You want a bet? You want a bet?
[27:21.000 --> 27:26.000]  Yes. I mean, I know my rights. I know I didn't do anything.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  This is called a protected zone, okay? The United Secret Service creates a protected zone.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  Stop right there.
[27:32.000 --> 27:39.000]  See, now they're making whole cities protective zones. They made Ottawa a protective zone.
[27:39.000 --> 27:45.000]  And then, quote, said no protesting allowed in the whole city into Montabello, across the river.
[27:45.000 --> 27:51.000]  And then they hired police to stage as anarchists so that they could physically attack.
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.000]  Our Secret Service was running in Canada.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  And it came out in the major Canadian papers.
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  Remember, that's where the Secret Service is.
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  These are the guys who were ordered to stand down in Kennedy's motorcade.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  And there's the famous film of them waving their hands saying,
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  why have we been ordered to stand down?
[28:07.000 --> 28:13.000]  This is a Secret Service that hires and orders police to stage events so they can attack peaceful protesters.
[28:13.000 --> 28:18.000]  This is a Secret Service that opened the door to take out Lincoln.
[28:18.000 --> 28:23.000]  Now, I'm not saying all the Secret Services like this, but it is the Secret Service.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  See, that was right back when they were changing the name of Secret Societies to Intelligence Agencies.
[28:28.000 --> 28:34.000]  And so it's got the old name of what it is, a Secret Society. Let's go back to it.
[28:34.000 --> 28:44.000]  You want to look that up on the internet? Go ahead.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  Did you hear that?
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  Hit pause. Rewind it about 10, 20 seconds.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  Did you hear that? Don't give me that Constitution.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.000]  It's like Bush signed the executive order.
[28:56.000 --> 28:58.000]  Even after they gave him White House memos,
[28:58.000 --> 29:05.000]  the generals refused to sexually assault children with pliers, torture women in front of their husbands.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  And this is all mainstream news.
[29:07.000 --> 29:12.000]  I told you about it six years ago that they were torturing people in the Middle East.
[29:12.000 --> 29:17.000]  I told you five years ago with the invasion, but now it's admitted.
[29:17.000 --> 29:20.000]  George Bush signed an order saying, do it.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  And they spy on everybody. They do whatever they want.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  They violate all the laws.
[29:24.000 --> 29:29.000]  They've been taking your DNA for 35 years at birth and putting the DNA database.
[29:29.000 --> 29:32.000]  These people are crooks. The Constitution.
[29:32.000 --> 29:38.000]  FEMA teaches police that it is the enemy of the government, that the founding fathers are bad.
[29:38.000 --> 29:44.000]  I have the traders on video. They are the terrorists.
[29:44.000 --> 29:48.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:48.000 --> 29:54.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:54.000 --> 29:58.000]  World Products now is introducing the new detoxer foot and body pads
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.000]  that work while you're sleeping to pull heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[30:02.000 --> 30:06.000]  Our detoxer pads release unwanted toxins, relieve stress and pain,
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  and improve the immune system, circulation and blockages, all while you're sleeping.
[30:10.000 --> 30:14.000]  Very simply, you put one pad on each foot before bedtime and go to sleep.
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  And when you wake up, the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[30:17.000 --> 30:20.000]  You peel them off and throw them away. It's that simple.
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  Call 908-691-2608.
[30:23.000 --> 30:29.000]  We encourage our customers to detox in as many ways as possible to bring the body back to a balance.

[33:14.000 --> 33:32.000]  Music
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  Yep, the head of the National Enquirer
[33:35.000 --> 33:38.000]  put photographers on the Bush daughters.
[33:38.000 --> 33:43.000]  Music
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  And he was the first to get mailed.
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  That weaponized anthrax.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  Music
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  Along with every other Bush enemy.
[33:53.000 --> 33:59.000]  Music
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  These people don't play games.
[34:01.000 --> 34:05.000]  They blow up your own federal buildings with you in them cops.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  They attack our own buildings.
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  They put poison in our water.
[34:10.000 --> 34:14.000]  These are hardcore killers.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  Music
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  Every day, every morning, every night when I wake up,
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  when I go to sleep,
[34:21.000 --> 34:24.000]  I consciously let that burn into my brain.
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.000]  I let that sink into my soul.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  And I tell you, that'll humble you.
[34:30.000 --> 34:34.000]  And then fancy cars, big houses don't matter anymore.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  You don't feel inadequate anymore.
[34:36.000 --> 34:40.000]  You don't feel insecure like most Americans
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  who've been ruined by Madison Avenue to feel inadequate.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  You realize what life's really about and you do smell the coffee.
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  You do enjoy the green grass and the blue skies
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  and the pretty little colored fishes swimming around in a mountain stream.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  When you look down at them or a doodle bug crawling along in the grass,
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  you appreciate life because you realize that we're in a jungle
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.000]  and you realize we've got monsters running our society.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  Play that audio again to the Secret Service guys.
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  Say, you know, give me that Constitution.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  Won't you give me that?
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  Finish playing it.
[35:13.000 --> 35:17.000]  This is called the protected zone, okay?
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  The United States Secret Service creates a protected zone
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  whenever there's a protecting town.
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  You want to look that up on the internet? Go ahead.
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  But still on the US Constitution.
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  Don't give me the US Constitution.
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  No, but that should give you.
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  It's a great, great country.
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  It's trying to protect me.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  Look it up on the industry.
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  Title 18, USC 3050 section.
[35:39.000 --> 35:42.000]  Look it up.
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  Look it up, buddy.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  All right. It goes on and on. We'll play more later.
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  It gets even worse.
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  But there have been a bunch of federal and state court cases.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  The Secret Service has won.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  Some of them lost a few of them.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  They won most of them.
[35:57.000 --> 36:01.000]  Famous case of South Carolina, 2004.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  Fella with no criminal record had a sign
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  saying get us out of Iraq.
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  In another case, the guy had no blood for oil.
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  What was that in Tennessee?
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  And he was standing there at a impromptu rally
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  for George Bush, about 500.
[36:17.000 --> 36:20.000]  The AP reported about 500 supporters were there.
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  There were just a couple of people against.
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  The Secret Service came over and said,
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  they're all allowed to be here without a permit.
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  You're not allowed to.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  And they said, leave.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  And they arrested him.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  And he got a year in prison for that federal court.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  Oh, yeah, this is East Germany.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  This is go to the gulag.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  This is China where you go out and you protest in Tiananmen Square.
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  You go to jail.
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  There it's three years.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  First time of the gulag reeducation.
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  Here it is one year.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  And it's all about keeping these drug dealing,
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  murdering mafia crooks like Clinton and Bush
[36:56.000 --> 36:59.000]  and Hillary and the rest of them and McCain and power.
[36:59.000 --> 37:02.000]  Like we're a bunch of terrorists.
[37:02.000 --> 37:05.000]  Meanwhile, the borders wide open and they're bringing in record numbers
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  of every group you can imagine has nothing to do with security.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  There was a case in Tennessee where that was Memphis.
[37:17.000 --> 37:21.000]  I had the guy I was about three years ago to was in the local Tennessee papers.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  This guy was a Republican Vietnam vet on the coffee shop
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  right by the federal building.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  Bush was coming into town in a couple days
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  and Secret Service.
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  Well, it was actually a sign of Secret Service.
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  Federal Marshals came in and said, listen,
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  and they said real bossily.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  The guy said he thought he was like in a third world police state.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  Forget his name.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  We interviewed him again three years ago.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  And they were real rude to him.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  And he said, well, what are you talking about?
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  And they said, listen, you're not allowed to put signs up saying
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  you don't like Bush in your windows.
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  We're telling all the businesses this.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Do you understand you will be arrested?
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  This is a no protest zone.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  If you put signs in your business windows,
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  then later he talked to the neighbors and found there were some that didn't like Bush
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  that were planning to put signs up and they were already spying on them,
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  tapping the phones on the route where Bush.
[38:13.000 --> 38:14.000]  I mean, that's what they do everywhere.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  Armies of these guys.
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  And the guy said, I'm a Vietnam vet.
[38:18.000 --> 38:19.000]  I was a Republican.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  I'm no longer.
[38:21.000 --> 38:22.000]  He said, I love law enforcement.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  I love the government.
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  I sell him coffee all day.
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.000]  The guy was basically one of their bootlickers.
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  But he said, I'm putting a sign up in my window.
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  And of course they did nothing.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  But that's what this has become now.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  A political commissar.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  That's what they were in Russia and China.
[38:39.000 --> 38:44.000]  A political officer comes in and says, I am here to make sure you do not put up sign.
[38:44.000 --> 38:49.000]  I am here to make sure that when the head of the bullet bureau comes into your city
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  two days from now, that you do not say anything that would be embarrassing of him.
[38:54.000 --> 38:58.000]  Do you understand the comrade?
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  Of course, Luke Radowski's, his family fought against the communist
[39:02.000 --> 39:05.000]  and had to leave Poland as political dissidents.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  And now his family is just now starting to wake up to the fact that
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  what Luke's been saying for six years is true,
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  that the evil is here, not just in Russia, not just in Poland.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  And now he's dealing with the same type of persecution that they witnessed.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  Luke Radowski, a really amazing one happened.
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  I can only commend you guys for your courage.
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  But I would, unless you want anthrax in the mail, I would just leave.
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  I know you were peaceful, you're not any threat to them, but they don't care.
[39:32.000 --> 39:37.000]  They've sat on TV, the matriarch of the family.
[39:37.000 --> 39:42.000]  Barbara has said that they will kill anyone that even bothers them.
[39:42.000 --> 39:46.000]  I hope they don't kill you and I'm not being joking about this.
[39:46.000 --> 39:49.000]  Luke, what do you think of this whole situation?
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.000]  I am livid because Gary is still in jail.
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.000]  He was supposed to see a judge actually this morning
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  and they're holding him till tonight and they're still not letting him see a judge.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  He's not being arraigned yet to this date.
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  He's facing third degree assault charges for being beat up by this thug
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  who was let go by the police department.
[40:08.000 --> 40:13.000]  I am just livid right now that Matt LaPace had to be dragged out, arrested.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  His face was slammed into doors.
[40:15.000 --> 40:19.000]  He was slammed into doors being dragged out from the event.
[40:19.000 --> 40:23.000]  I mean, the police officers at the 19th precinct really give a bad name
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  to all the police officers here in New York City.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  And I am livid right now that this is going on.
[40:27.000 --> 40:28.000]  Let's be clear.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  Gary and there's a bunch of witnesses to this.
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  They smashed his camera.
[40:32.000 --> 40:35.000]  Gary, and Gary's a very nice fellow.
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.000]  He just said in a loud voice from across the grate behind the grate
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  in a controlled area where the slaves are pinned.
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  What exactly did he say?
[40:45.000 --> 40:48.000]  Luke, we're told that he said, you know, how do you, you know,
[40:48.000 --> 40:53.000]  how does it feel knowing that your husband, your father is responsible
[40:53.000 --> 40:54.000]  for the 9-11 attacks?
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  Is that correct?
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  Yeah, that's exactly what he said.
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  And the video of him saying is actually up on the website.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  And then you see him getting assaulted.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  You see him.
[41:02.000 --> 41:03.000]  Okay, so the video is now up.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  You see me alone.
[41:05.000 --> 41:06.000]  And then you see the camera being turned off.
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  The camera was smashed.
[41:07.000 --> 41:08.000]  The camera is broken.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  Okay, so as of last night, I thought the tape wasn't working.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  You were able to get it working.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  So it's now on the video.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  It's a new video that's up.
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  The video is up on WeAreChanged.org.
[41:18.000 --> 41:21.000]  It's the main video on InfowarsandPrisonPlanet.com right now.
[41:21.000 --> 41:22.000]  Okay.
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  And it's the video of everything that happened yesterday.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  Sadly, we do not have video of Gary being assaulted,
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  but there are many witnesses, which we got on tape,
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  which we got on video.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  No, no, that's what I meant.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  You're describing exactly what happened.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  This man wanted to fight.
[41:34.000 --> 41:35.000]  Everything was over.
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  Gary was walking away.
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.000]  Well, this is a secret service that commands the police to stage events.
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.000]  They've been caught trying to destroy our First Amendment.
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  Yeah, and we're being attacked on all sides here.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  And I think there's a reason for that,
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  because we're really winning this Infowar.
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  We're winning the minds of the American people.
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  And now, right now, the system is staging provocative attacks on us
[42:01.000 --> 42:02.000]  from all sides.
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  We're being attacked everywhere.
[42:04.000 --> 42:05.000]  Ground zero.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  We're being attacked in Ireland.
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  We AreChanged.
[42:07.000 --> 42:08.000]  LA was also arrested.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  And I would just like to put out a call to any lawyers listening,
[42:11.000 --> 42:14.000]  if people could, if we could get any legal representation to help us.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  We would really appreciate it.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  In New York, we need civil rights lawyers.
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  We need to show that this was racketeering,
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  that this was civil rights violation, a conspiracy.
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.000]  This was done by design to not just violate his First Amendment,
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  but to then set him up with false charges.
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  Exactly.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  And we're looking for any lawyers to help us out.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  And if you're not a lawyer, if you could donate,
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  we could buy some legal counsel.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  We're looking for as much help as we could get right now,
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.000]  because we definitely need it.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  We're going to make this a huge deal,
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  because this is a huge deal,
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  because we're standing up for the Constitution.
[42:44.000 --> 42:45.000]  I don't want to give any names out.
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  You're getting the video of Schwarzenegger
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  and how you guys were assaulted up.
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.000]  There's an individual who has run up to you guys,
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  bitten people on the face, slapped people, screamed,
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  tries to stick Hitler mustaches on people,
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.000]  waving signs saying that you guys did the attacks,
[43:01.000 --> 43:05.000]  the attack on the Army Center there in Times Square.
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  I mean, so obvious showing up with film crews.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  This is so incredibly obvious.
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  I mean, this is out of control.
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  I mean, I said it again, I said it before,
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  I'm going to say it again.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  Every time they attack us, we're going to raise our efforts
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  twice as much, and that's why you're going to see
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  Arnold Schwarzenegger being confronted,
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  John Kerry being confronted.
[43:23.000 --> 43:26.000]  You're going to see this lunatic attacking us at ground zero,
[43:26.000 --> 43:28.000]  and we also got a new eyewitness testimony
[43:28.000 --> 43:33.000]  that saw explosions happening on Route 11 inside the lobby.
[43:33.000 --> 43:36.000]  We're going to be releasing all those videos in the next coming week.
[43:36.000 --> 43:37.000]  We better do it fast, Lou.
[43:37.000 --> 43:39.000]  We're doubling our efforts.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Every time they attack us, we're going to double our efforts.
[43:41.000 --> 43:42.000]  It's time right now.
[43:42.000 --> 43:43.000]  This is 2008.
[43:43.000 --> 43:47.000]  It's now or never, and that's why I'm asking everybody out there
[43:47.000 --> 43:49.000]  to be the change that they want to see as well.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  It's time right now to rise up to confront these criminals
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  and stand up for this country.
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[43:56.000 --> 43:59.000]  We're going to play more of this audio coming up after the break
[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  where some of the witnesses are talking about
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  what they saw happen to Gary.
[44:03.000 --> 44:07.000]  Now, you understand, Luke, I'm not armchair quarterbacking this.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  I have had experience with this.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  I'm not saying you guys are bad or wrong.
[44:11.000 --> 44:14.000]  I'm just saying, hey, when you're out in your motorboat,
[44:14.000 --> 44:17.000]  there's some rocks over there and there isn't a buoy.
[44:17.000 --> 44:22.000]  So I'm trying to be a buoy marking shallow water jagged rocks.
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  You guys did a great job.
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  You shouldn't have been treated like this.
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  My only point is they kill their maids.
[44:29.000 --> 44:30.000]  They kill their nannies.
[44:30.000 --> 44:36.000]  They kill media heads who just even say anything about their family.
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  There is nothing more dangerous than getting them next near their family.
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  So I'm just telling you, it's mafia rules.
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.000]  We'll leave you alone basically as long as you don't get near their family.
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  I'm just saying, stay away.
[44:48.000 --> 44:52.000]  I try to tell you guys, I mean, I'm not trying to be preachy here,
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  but do you see what I'm saying, Luke?
[44:54.000 --> 44:55.000]  You definitely make a point.
[44:55.000 --> 44:58.000]  And there's really no reason to go after their family
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  because they're not the real criminals behind this.
[45:00.000 --> 45:03.000]  And we're going to start raising our efforts on the real criminals.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.000]  Forget their families.
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  Forget their lives.
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  They're not even going to concentrate on that no more.
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  We're going to concentrate on the real criminals.
[45:09.000 --> 45:10.000]  I'm not 11.
[45:10.000 --> 45:14.000]  I'm asking everybody listening out there to double their efforts.
[45:14.000 --> 45:15.000]  The time is now.
[45:15.000 --> 45:18.000]  And when we prove to ourselves that whenever they attack us,
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  we raise our efforts, they back down.
[45:20.000 --> 45:21.000]  They stop.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  Last year when I got the death threats, I doubled my efforts.
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.000]  I confronted David Rockefeller, Giuliani, Edwards,
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  and they stopped giving me the death threats.
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  By the way, it's not just you saying you got death threats.
[45:31.000 --> 45:36.000]  You have the retired police with active duty police in uniform saying,
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  we're going to frame you with a bomb.
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  You're going to frame you as a terrorist.
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  Hardcore super felonies on video and nothing happened.
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  I mean, you guys are under massive attack.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.000]  And not only that, I mean, we just recently got more death threats online
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  with YouTube comments, with messages, with emails.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  I get people saying they're going to kill me, strangle me.
[45:56.000 --> 46:00.000]  I don't care whatever threats they send out to me because when they do,
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  I'm going to double my efforts and I'm not scared.
[46:02.000 --> 46:03.000]  Yeah, let's be clear, Luke.
[46:03.000 --> 46:04.000]  We're already committed to this.
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  We're not worried about getting killed.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  It's that we want to continue our work and fight the info war in a smart way.
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  We want to continue the work.
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  We want to live to fight another day and defeat the enemy,
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  which we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  They are not invincible.
[46:18.000 --> 46:19.000]  They will be defeated.
[46:19.000 --> 46:20.000]  They are terrorists.
[46:20.000 --> 46:23.000]  Look, even if they do something to me,
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  the message of weird change, the spirit of weird change will continue
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  because it's not about one person.
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  It's about everybody doing what they can,
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  being the difference that they want to see in this world,
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  doing the right thing.
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  That's what's beautiful about weird change.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  It's not about one person.
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  It's about everybody doing something.
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  And that is the key to the human spirit.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  That is the key to the human spirit.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  The globalists try to get that human spirit to falsely,
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  the false self-sacrifice to serve their evil ends.
[46:49.000 --> 46:53.000]  What will defeat them is the true idea of self-sacrifice
[46:53.000 --> 46:56.000]  for the human community, for justice, for liberty, for freedom,
[46:56.000 --> 47:01.000]  to stop being afraid and commit to this fight everywhere the scum is being confronted.
[47:01.000 --> 47:05.000]  The people are discovering they can go in, take over press conferences,
[47:05.000 --> 47:07.000]  take over events, get the media coverage.
[47:07.000 --> 47:09.000]  All these big names are going public.
[47:09.000 --> 47:18.000]  Now they've had Zawa Hiri, their operative, come out and say that 9-11 Truth works with Iran.
[47:18.000 --> 47:24.000]  The Intel Center, as usual, pointing out the audio, putting up fake video.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  I mean, it's so obvious they are in crisis mode, Luke.
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.000]  The tide is turning, the time is right now, it's 2008.
[47:31.000 --> 47:37.000]  We have to do it now before the new president is selected into the office of the White House.
[47:37.000 --> 47:38.000]  We have to do it now.
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.000]  And I just wanted to say, I will never hurt anybody, but I myself,
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  I'm not scared of being hurt myself.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  And that's why I wanted to put out there.
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.000]  We're a nonviolent grassroots organization based on the principles of Martin Luther King and Gandhi.
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  Nothing will stop us.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  We are unstoppable. We are winning the minds of the American people.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  And the time is right now to stand up and do the right thing.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  Now or never, it's 2008.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  We can't wait after the new president is selected.
[48:06.000 --> 48:14.000]  Look, I just can't believe that they would beat Gary up and then that they would...
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  I mean, I can't believe it, but that's all they do.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  They attack you and then charge you for attacking you.
[48:20.000 --> 48:27.000]  Not only that, but when this nut job at Ground Zero attacked us, Sabrina Rivera actually got a summons to come into court.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  And she was charged just the same as this nut job that attacked us at Ground Zero.
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  And now we have to go to court with this nut job.
[48:33.000 --> 48:34.000]  That's what they do.
[48:34.000 --> 48:37.000]  That's what the police department, that's what the Port Authority Police Department did at Ground Zero.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  There's no law. There's no order.
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  There's no respect.
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  There's no justice served here.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  And that's where we're going public with everything.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  That's why we have truth on our side.
[48:46.000 --> 48:47.000]  And we're not scared.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  We're never going to back down.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  We're going to double our efforts.
[48:50.000 --> 48:51.000]  We're going to step it up.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  And we're asking everybody here listening right now to step up with us because the time is now.
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  It's either now or never.
[48:58.000 --> 48:59.000]  It is.
[48:59.000 --> 49:08.000]  Or we can submit to the globalists and let them stage more attacks and launch World War III and keep carrying out eugenics against us and keep all their operations going.
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  I mean, they're attacking us.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  They draw first blood over and over again.
[49:11.000 --> 49:19.000]  All we're doing is standing up and speaking back and being physically attacked by them and set up by them at every level, showing their criminality.
[49:19.000 --> 49:28.000]  But here's the deal, whether it's Ireland or whether it's Ground Zero or whether it's Los Angeles, everywhere it's coming out, that they attack us and then set us up.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  On video, everyone's seeing who the bad guys are.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  Everyone's seeing who the crooks are.
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  Everybody's seeing who the provocateurs are.
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  Everybody's learning.
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  That's why it's important to go to infowars.com.
[49:41.000 --> 49:42.000]  We are change.org.
[49:42.000 --> 49:43.000]  Get these videos.
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.000]  Get them out to everybody.
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Write stories about it.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  Listeners, explain to everyone what's happening.
[49:48.000 --> 49:49.000]  Let everyone know.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  Listen, for decades, cops have been above the law.
[49:52.000 --> 49:57.000]  Now, the last 10 years all over the nation, depending on which area, they have their own plates.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  They're above the law.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  That's just now coming out mainstream news.
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  People are finally finding out that government thinks it's God.
[50:04.000 --> 50:05.000]  It's over scum.
[50:05.000 --> 50:06.000]  Do you understand?
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  This is real revolution, Luke.
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  The time is now and we're making huge headways.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  We're making a huge impact.
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  Huge people, huge celebrities are coming out.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  I don't know about you, Alex, but this is a beautiful time to be alive.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  Every time I do something, I feel happy.
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.000]  I feel more.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  I feel so alive by confronting these politicians, by doing the right thing.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  Whatever happens to me, I don't care because my soul, my spirit, and my mind is at peace.
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  What I did is right.
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  What they're doing is wrong and they're going to have to live with that.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  And when they pass away, when they leave this earth,
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  they're going to have to deal with the consequences
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  and they have to understand what they're going through
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  and they're going to understand what they did is wrong.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  And deep in their gut, they know there's more than just this life.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Everybody, there are no atheists in foxholes.
[50:49.000 --> 51:16.000]  Luke, stay there.
[51:21.000 --> 51:24.000]  Or you would like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve.

[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  The father's responsible for 9-11.
[53:56.000 --> 54:01.000]  What about the majority of Americans that are saying your father's responsible?
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  Intelligence was manipulated and your children are being sent to Iraq
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  and you're all okay with it?
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  You're all okay with it and you're going to go to Iran?
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  Put down in my face.
[54:11.000 --> 54:17.000]  You're standing behind me.
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  You only live once.
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  My life isn't about shopping malls and bobbles.
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  Gold trinkets hang around my neck.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  Is your life about death?
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  Are you going to be part of the Second American Revolution?
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  Are you going to go toe-to-toe against evil?
[54:37.000 --> 54:43.000]  Or are you going to lie down?
[54:43.000 --> 54:50.000]  This is it.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  This is it.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  You've got to make your decision now.
[54:55.000 --> 54:59.000]  Worldwide it's the time to commit or submit.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  I can't submit.
[55:01.000 --> 55:05.000]  I am committed to resist the new world order.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  I am committed to spread the word to every hill and mountain,
[55:09.000 --> 55:16.000]  to every valley, to every hamlet, to every city.
[55:16.000 --> 55:20.000]  That the enemy is amongst us and waging war against us.
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.000]  And if they think that they're going to win,
[55:24.000 --> 55:33.000]  they've got another thing coming.
[55:33.000 --> 55:37.000]  Let's go back to Luke Radowski.
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  Luke, it is shaking them up.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  It's freaking them out.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  There are scores of national programs,
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  every news channel saying we're terrorists.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  We need to be sent to torture camps.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  These are quotes to secretly be tortured.
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  That we need to be killed.
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  That we need to be arrested.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  That we are with Al Qaeda.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  Now they've got the provocateurs trying to say that at ground zero.
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  Definitely, we're hurting them bad.
[56:01.000 --> 56:05.000]  The article with the supposed top Al Qaeda,
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  number two had been lauding coming out
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  and saying the 9-11 truth works for Iran.
[56:09.000 --> 56:13.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  Again, I want to repeat.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  This means we are hurting them bad.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  They are squealing, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  It's like a bully starts a fight with you
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  and they'll slug you for a while while you're punching back.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  Then you kind of hear that whimper.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  And then they start crying.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  And then you can really take them down to the ground
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  in the Info War and bust their skull wide open.
[56:31.000 --> 56:34.000]  Luke, in the Info War, I smell blood.
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  It's time to really turn the heat up.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  This is a critical time and I pray for everybody listening right now
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  to understand the importance of this time right now
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  to take action, to get out there,
[56:44.000 --> 56:47.000]  to talk to everybody, to talk to your local police departments,
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  to talk to people in the military,
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  and to educate them about the truth.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  Educate them about what's really happening
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  in the United States of America.
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  I really pray for everybody listening right now
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  to take action, get motivated, and get involved
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  because this is what life's about.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  Life's about doing the right thing, doing the good thing.
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  It's not about the shopping malls.
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  It's not about parasilting.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  It's about standing up for liberty, standing up for life,
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  standing up for peace.
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  And that's what we're about.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  And that's what I hope people will stand up for.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  And that's what I pray that people will take action right now
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  and do the right thing.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  He's still in the detention camp.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  These are now little FEMA camps
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  where freedom lovers go here in the United States
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  just like Tiananmen Square.
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  You go to the camp and get framed
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  here in the so-called Free Society.
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  19th Precinct, 153 E67 Street,
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  3rd Street in Lex, New York, New York.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  Just really quick, Alex.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  He was taken down to Central Bookings.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  We're going to post a new telephone number up on our website
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  where people could call and ask to release.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Gary, we're going to release his last name
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  so people could call in and demand
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  this man to be released
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  because he was arrested for being assaulted.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  This man was beat up.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  Also, I think it's really...
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  I don't think it's... We don't want to be deceptive,
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  but it's not good that they don't know
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  that the camera was knocked out of his hands
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  and that all of the assault isn't on video
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  because now they'll continue to frame up.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  They'd probably drop it if they knew there was video.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  So it's just such criminals.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  You still give the 19th criminals a call.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  212-452-0600.
[58:18.000 --> 58:21.000]  They're hired thugs of the establishment, period.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  They're there to serve and suck off the slave population
[58:24.000 --> 58:26.000]  while overrunning the country with illegal aliens.
[58:26.000 --> 58:31.000]  212-452-0600.
[58:31.000 --> 58:52.000]  We'll be right back.
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  For the first time in history,
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  the elite's plan for world government
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  is blown wide open.
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  You will learn the secret that drives
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  the entire new world order agenda.
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  Most people have no idea.
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  They have all the money they need.
[59:29.000 --> 59:33.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com

[59:38.000 --> 59:41.000]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[59:41.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  You have been warned.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  Now into hour number two, three hours more.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  Layout before us.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  A lot of important guests coming up.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  Vital info straight ahead.
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  Gary Matlabasek, other innocence arrested
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  for engaging in the First Amendment
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  by the secret police goons
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  and framed publicly in front of witnesses.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Much of it on camera.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Give the NYPD, the New York
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  PERP department,
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  the people who work for the private banks
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  that own us, the slaves
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  who have framed up an innocent American
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  with pleasure and enjoyment as usual.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  646-610-5000.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  646-610-5000.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  Not content to run most the drugs
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  and prostitution in New York for 200 years.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  The New York police department,
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  they've really only been around about 150,
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  but they had constables before that.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  They're the gangs of New York.
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Now they have to frame citizens
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  that don't want to be slaves.
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  It's unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  They physically assault you and then charge you
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  just like they attack that black guy, black NFL guy.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  He doesn't even touch them. They taser him.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  He begs with his hands, please.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  I'm a police sergeant.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  The guy just screams with pleasure at the groveling
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  and tazers him.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Then they put on the news that the black guy's bad.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  It's just how it works.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  I'm supposed to sit there and enjoy it and say the cops are good.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  646-610-5000.
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Let them know their criminality is all on video.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  646-610-5000.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  Don't give the scum what they want
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  to sit there and act screaming or threatening.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Just be, we know you're criminals.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  We know you engaged in crime. We know you framed him.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  We understand
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  that this will be exposed.
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  You need to stop now and stop being criminals.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Stop violating the First Amendment
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  in George Washington
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  who fought right there in your city.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  646-610-5000.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  Tell them to release Gary.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  They know who he is.
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  Luke Radowski in closing
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  wearchange.org.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  People can support you there.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  But the big thing is we need New York lawyers
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  or New Jersey lawyers, anybody nearby
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  who can go in with all this footage and witnesses
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  and not just
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  get these false charges dropped
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  but also start a civil rights lawsuit
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  which New York loses one every couple of days.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  They just use taxpayer money
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  to pay it off. That's why they don't care.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  But Luke, any other closing comments
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  about what's happened
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  being arrested for
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  what you just heard earlier
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  talking about how the Bush crime family is behind 9-11?
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Well, I just wanted to say
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  that people should support us.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  People should help us. Start your own change chapter.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  Start whatever chapter organization
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  you want. Just do the right thing.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  I just wanted to say publicly that
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  I will never commit suicide. I love my life.
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  I will never do anything like that.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  They're going to try to frame us again.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  I just wanted to make that point clear. Call the police
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  and help us out. We're going to start a national movement
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  with the length of every month action
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  where we're going to start educating police officers
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  and military personnel about the truth
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  about what's really going on in this country.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  Help us out. Join us. Become the change you want to see
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  in this world and help start the Second American Revolution.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  Absolutely.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  Luke Radowski, thank you for spending time with us.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Thanks for having me, brother.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  You bet. Yeah, you can watch the video
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  by the time they smash the camera
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  where he gets assaulted
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  and you can have all the eyewitnesses
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  in one video who saw it all happen.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  They then describe what happened.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  We're trying to get a steel camera film developed
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  right now that shows this guy's face
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  that did assault him.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  This is how it works.
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  I remember I was peacefully back
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  when I really wasn't even anti-bush.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  We didn't know what he would do. We knew he was bad.
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  In 2000, during the speed of the election,
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  I was down at the Capitol by the governor's mansion
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  and Secret Service would come up and shove on you
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  and then go, you planted something violent, Alex.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  And I'd say, you know, I'm playing close
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  and I'd say, come on, man.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  Number one, don't touch me.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  Number two, you know I'm nonviolent.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And they'd have the Bush supporters hitting me
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  on the head with their signs
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  fighting with the Democrats. That was all fun.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  It was harass us
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  because we were down there with our video cameras.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  And that's what this country is.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  It's a bunch of crooks that work for a corrupt government
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  that works for foreign banks
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  that are busy destroying this country right now.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  All right, I got masses of news I'm going to cover.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  When Bob Chapman joins us in 25 minutes,
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  a lot of other audio clips coming up too.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  A huge radio show lined up.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  Very important guest about the Ron Paul strategy.
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  You want to make heads or tails of what's going on
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  with their delegate activities?
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Well, we'll talk to somebody who's in the thick of it
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  coming up to stay with us.

[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  The EPA has stated that indoor air
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  is up to five times more polluted than outdoors,
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  causing 50% of all illnesses.

[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  and other diseases cannot live
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity,
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  and loss of weight.
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  in an alkaline environment.
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Do your part, alkalize, and supercharge your body now.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate

[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  Music
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  You want answers?
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:04.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:04.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  Music
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  We are back live.
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  Have you noticed how the police, the military,
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  when they're involved in policing now?
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Yeah, we told you for years that was coming,
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  and now it's here.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  The Secret Service all of them just treats you like absolute dirt.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  I mean, they set up checkpoints two, three miles.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  They move them all the time on a major-state road.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  I mean, a major four-lane, two-lane.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  It gets larger and smaller in different areas.
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  In Crawford, then you just pull up and they just go,
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  turn around.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  Who are you?
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  I'll arrest you right now.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  Get back you.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  They just look at you like you're just absolute dirt.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  And I have that here out of the Herald.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  The Monterey Herald.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  This is the Monterey newspaper.
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  It's in a bunch of other papers because the newspapers just
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  now discovered that in California, one million vehicles,
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  if you want to get technical, 996,000,
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  but that was last year's numbers they've issued more,
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  are above the law.
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  No tickets, no running red lights, no drunken driving.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Now, in Texas, two legislative sessions ago,
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  we read the bill on air, almost passed a law that anyone
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  who'd criticized government or criticized police,
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  this was in the bill, that DPS intelligence would,
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  and they did this by the way in the 70s and got caught.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  It was big national scandal.
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  They were spying on peace groups, churches.
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  It's really federal intelligence.
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Quite a group of people.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  I've been surveilled by them.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  Like, I'm not going to notice a white van parked
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  out front of my house with a black window in the back
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  with an air conditioner on the top with state plates.
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  You walk over and they won't open the door,
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  but the thing's running.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  They get real mad.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  I mean, come on.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Why don't you go surveil some of your cop bosses
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  bringing in narcotics?
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  Why don't you actually, or your whore running buddies?
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Instead of leaving me alone, somebody
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:34.000]  doesn't even speed anymore and still gets pulled over
[1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  by your random searches.
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  I don't even drink one beer anymore.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  Period.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Not much one beer and drive.
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  Nothing.
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  I do nothing.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  I pay your taxes to your private banks.
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  I do it all.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  But I'm going to tell you your crux.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  Your system is criminal.
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  And I'm sick of bending over to it.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I'm sick of mincing words.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  And I'm not talking about individual police,
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  but the system is as rotten as a dead cow in the ditch
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  that's been dead for a week and a half.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  And I'm not going to look at the maggots and the bloated guts
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  and the stench and say it's beautiful or say
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  it smells like lavender.
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:20.000]  I am not going to play along with it anymore.
[1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  All right.
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  I said I cover news and I'm already going into a complete
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  and total insane rant mode here.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Editorial loophole let some avoid tickets tolls.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000]  Now, this is actually a whitewash article.
[1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000]  If you read out of the way of peasants,
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  I know I talked about this yesterday,
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  but you've heard me say they're above the law.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:46.000]  And in many states, well, I digress going back.
[1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:50.000]  They almost passed a bill where they will have
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  in all the police computers, not your tickets,
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  not your arrest record, not your DNA type.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  What's happening now?
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  Not your cell phone tracking live time,
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  not all your slave identifiers.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  And that's what we are slaves here to be chemically attacked,
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  here to be lobotomized, here to be enslaved,
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  here to be sterilized, here to die.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:12.000]  We serve the globalist.
[1:12:12.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  You two cops, they're chemically attacking your children
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.000]  every day, public documents.
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  You're too dumb to look it up.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Maybe some of you are.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Maybe you will.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  I call the public dumb too, folks, not just you.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Your house is on fire.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  I'm trying to get you up and get you out of it.
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  You're laying there in your bed, laughing at me.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  I don't have time for it, man.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:32.000]  I'm risking my life here.
[1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  That's why I get mad.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  Hold on.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  Let me just settle down.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  They almost passed a law in Texas,
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  and some states have done it,
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  where they watch your political statements.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  So the police know when they pull you over
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  if you are someone who's been critical of them.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:50.000]  I'm not kidding.
[1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  So they can have their way with you.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  So they can push you around.
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  They already, all over the country,
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  every major department has squad cars.
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  LA's got hundreds of them.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Houston's got a bunch.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:04.000]  Austin had just bought, what, four or five years ago?
[1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  I don't know what they have now,
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  that just randomly read everybody's plates
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  and run your plates, which state law,
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  in every state, says is illegal.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  They're not supposed to just randomly run your plates,
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  but they just do it.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  Oh, we have computers that randomly run your plates
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  to look for stolen cars.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Sure you do.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  When my car got stolen twice,
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  it didn't come out.
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  But it's to look for stolen.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  Just like the gunshot detectors they put in in 1998 in Austin,
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  there's now hundreds of them with the thousands of cameras.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  They said, we're gunshot detectors.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:34.000]  You went to the company's website.
[1:13:34.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  They bragged it was to listen to people at 200 yards away,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  and no one ever got busted from the gunshot detectors.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  There are really microphones all over the city.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  So to know who you are,
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  and to know what you've said about them,
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  like a Google search in their computer.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  They already have Google in most of their cars,
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  and they're already doing web searches on everybody
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  in a lot of the departments.
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  Some departments don't allow it.
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:06.000]  So they're all little intelligence operatives.
[1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  They're all little commas are political officers.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And they wanted to know, and so they could harass you,
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  and we said to the officers for their own safety
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.000]  to know if you criticized them.
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.000]  And that was narrowly defeated.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  And DPS intelligence just runs around doing whatever they want.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  They're not dealing with rocket attacks and murders
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  and massive kidnappings and dead cops
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  and Los Zetas paramilitary killing cops in Dallas
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  and killing cops in San Antonio.
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  That's all kept real quiet or any of the serious things.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  It's just spying on people's political speech.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  So when you read about this, realize it's not just them
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  that are at a higher level of status in class.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  It's that you are being identified and tracked
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  and that you are scum.
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  Editorial loophole lets some avoid tickets and tolls.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  For no good reason, thousands of cars registered
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  to Monterey County drivers are essentially exempt
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  from parking tickets, exempt from citations
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  and running red lights at intersections,
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  monitoring by cameras except from fees,
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  exempt from fees from toll roads.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Yeah, I lived in a neighborhood with a bunch of cops
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  like six years ago, so you'd leave work the same time
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  or come home the same time you'd be behind them.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  You'd know their cars because you'd soon get out
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  of their private cars and their police uniforms.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:30.000]  They drive like complete maniacs around here.
[1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  You look over the back fence.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:34.000]  They're stumbling around drunk with their buddies,
[1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  barbecuing, and they all go get in their cars and leave.
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  All the time you hear about cops on motorcycles
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  and cars killing people, wrecking.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  They'll have alcohol levels where most people
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  couldn't even walk.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  There's cases where cops will pull them over
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  and then they'll get in trouble.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  But then the bars that sell the cops to liquor,
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  they go to jail.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  The gods are above the law when they kill themselves,
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  but the bars that sell them the alcohol,
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  it's all their fault.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  They go persecute and give them manslaughter charges.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:08.000]  That just happened where this cop and his girlfriend
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  were so drunk they just got totally plastered
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  on their high-powered motorcycle and went plowing
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  their guardrail in the hill country and they went
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  and arrested the bartender.
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  By the way, it came out they ordered the bartender
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  to give them more drinks.
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  Ha ha ha, it's just sick, man, it's sick.
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  A bunch of drunk PTSD nuts running around
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  doing whatever they want.
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  These local cars are among the 996,000 California vehicles
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  registered to owners employed by or affiliated with.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  That's right, their family are gods too.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  A long list of public safety.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  Public safety, it's for your safety.
[1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  Agencies and quasi-public safety agencies, quasi, yeah.
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  That's right, LCRA around here, the private mafia group
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  has their own SWAT teams, they rule, they're above the law.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  I've talked to people that used to work for them,
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  they just flashed their security badge
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  and the police basically bow down.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  They're part of infrastructure protection.
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  The owners, therefore, are able to keep their home addresses
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  from public disclosure under state's
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  confidential records program.
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  They're all secret agents.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  Once upon a time, the program made sense until 1990.
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  Criminals and everybody else could use license plate numbers
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:20.000]  to get the home addresses of most Californians
[1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  through Department of Motor Vehicle records.
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  But after a couple of highly publicized stalker attacks
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  on actresses, Rebecca Schaefer and Teresa Solanda,
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  the law was changed to make the DMV addresses records
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  off limits to public while allowing law enforcement agencies
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  to have access to home addresses
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  except those protected under confidential records programs.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  Yeah, what about cop stalking hot women?
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  I always read about that.
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  But only after the cop goes nuts and rapes and kills them.
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  Their favorites to sit outside the topless bars
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  and pull the topless dancers over drunk in demand services.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  That's all right, it's freedom.
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  The confidentiality program has been in place for more than a decade.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  It should have been amended in 1990
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  to enable law enforcement agencies to obtain
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  how much the DMV addresses, information on anyone when necessary.
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  But as the Orange County Register reported recently,
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  police officers, relatives of police officers,
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  parole agents, social workers at Shaw Kidnapping Rings,
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  animal control officers and judges and city council members,
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  legislators and others that are part of the crime syndicate
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  remain under a special cloak of protection
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  that does little to shield them from crooks or stalkers
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  but that immunizes them from inconveniences
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  such as parking fines, highway tolls.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  When they drive past a toll booth without paying,
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  a ticket is generated, but the highway authority
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  can't figure out where to send it.
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  The officers and the officers get to keep a secret plate
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  when they retire.
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  If they change jobs and no longer are eligible,
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  they can keep the protected plates for three years.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  On the Southern California toll road,
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  3,722 vehicles traveled toll free in the past five years
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  because of this misplaced confidentiality.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  Many of those vehicles made hundreds of free trips
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:12.000]  and then the article just gets worse.
[1:19:12.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  It just gets worse from there.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  This is everywhere now.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  This is everywhere now.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  And see what scary is?
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  The cops on their own squad car videos,
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  I've seen hundreds of them,
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  will beat you up on video.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  You don't even resist your human instincts neutralized
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  and then they charge you and send you to prison.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  I'm tired of the injustice
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  and you're making good cops look bad.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  By the way, police, you're losing the info war.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  People absolutely hate you.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  I hope you know that.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  It's a big idea, a new world order.
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  In the near future,
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg group.
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  But their objective being world domination.
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:22.000]  For the first time in history,
[1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:32.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[1:20:56.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed,
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  retained and utilized than have heated.
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  The champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients or body craves.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.

[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness,
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  and pure body cleansing. Put the champion juicer to work for you and your family.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flower.

[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide,
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  Time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design,
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.

[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  We're back live, Bob Chapman coming up.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Understand the psychological system here.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  We bash the police for the bad things they do,
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  the tyrannical training, the shift into martial law,
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  the public martial law drills, roundups, public violations by design,
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  of the Fourth Amendment, the endopocicom and tautus, FEMA camps,
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  spies, the total conversion of the economy over into a prison fortress,
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  literally.
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  We come out and bash the police,
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  and then that further compacts them into their gang mentality of see everyone's against you.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  Because the average cop isn't a bad person, bad man or woman.
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  They've just been incrementally twisted, so they hear this,
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  and they go, I don't do that stuff.
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  That's an exaggeration.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  That's bull.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  This guy's a liar.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  And so it further compacts them into the mindset,
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  I do not personally hate you.
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  I do hate watching videos of you beat people half to death
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  and then charging them just so you want to cover up for yourself.
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  I mean, they'll even show squad car video of them beating you and say,
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  he spoke back so I had to beat him,
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  and that speaking was resistant, so I want five years in prison.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Or, oh, you didn't pay your fare on the,
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  or you couldn't get it out of your pocket quick enough on the subway.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  We now taser you for punishment.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  This is all happening.
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  They tasered a guy yesterday and he caught on fire.
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Now they're going to up the taser power.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  People die every day.
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:01.000]  It's a murder weapon.
[1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  Cops have died in the test with it.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:07.000]  Especially big guys, especially athletes,
[1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  because their hearts are already, already amped all up.
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  Just like they've had champion basketball players just collapse of heart attacks.
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  You know, it's the best race horses have serious, you know, problems.
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  It's like marathon runners are always dropping dead,
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  but I'm already digressing.
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  The point here is I don't want to be your enemy,
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  but you've got unlimited power.
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  You've been given the green light to do whatever you want.
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  You're stealing old ladies money out of their purses
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  without even arresting them with acid, formative, or seizure.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  I see that in the news every week.
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  You're scary as hell.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  And I care about my children a lot more than I care about you.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  I don't want them growing up in this third world pit.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  You don't like it, leave it.
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Hey, you're the ones that came in with these foreign powers
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  and these foreign systems and overthrew my well life.
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  I want you to leave.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  You like being a thug?
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Go down and see they'll give you a job in Mexico or Russia or China.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  Stop destroying my country right in front of me.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  Derek, the sales guy here in the office won't come on air,
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  but he was in there defending the police just now.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Well, a lot of them are nice, so most of them are nice,
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  but there is this one who pulled me over five times from work
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  when I was 20 in Clear Lake, and I wasn't speeding.
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  I don't know why he didn't like me, but I had long hair.
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  Then he beat me, you know, until my legs were bloody,
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  but, you know, he was probably just having a bad day.
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  I'm not bashing Derek, but I mean, I always see the abused
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  making excuses for this.
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  I'm tired of it, man.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  See, I've taken psychology, and I've read a lot of graduate-level
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  criminology outside of college, but textbooks, it's very interesting.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  Go take it.
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  Just go take some courses or buy some advanced criminology textbooks.
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  But really, it's in the 101 that criminals and psychopaths
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  radiate towards power positions, and the number one and two are
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  government positions and law enforcement.
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Now, most of them are just guys get out of the military,
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  they want a job.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Or most of them are just people that their dad's a cop,
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  so they're going to be a cop.
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  There's the old hunter slash guardian slash warrior class
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  that that's the honorable job they want to have.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  Or in big cities, that's the job you can have if you're blue collar.
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  Not anymore, folks.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  It's more of the German or Soviet model where these are scary people.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  I mean, I've been downtown.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  That's why I won't go downtown anymore at night to go to a restaurant
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  or a movie, because that's where the special Roydhead divisions.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  I mean, huge shaved head guys with devil tats all over them.
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  And I've had them, and I've been with friends.
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  If you're with good-looking women, that really makes them mad,
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  because women don't like shaved head Roydheads.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  And they get really mad if you're with good-looking women.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  And they'll just come over and say,
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:00.000]  what's going on? Let me see her ID.
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  Hey, you got a problem, boy? Go ahead and make a move.
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  They wear black gloves, huge Royd muscles, and they'll just look at you.
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:10.000]  Just like out of a movie, man, like out of Road Warrior or something.
[1:29:10.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  Just give us the gas. I spell your lives.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  I don't want to live like this.
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  Just stop pushing. Stop pushing. Stop pushing all the time.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  Stop treating me like crap.
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Just at least treat me like a scum slave, not a trash filth scum slave.
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  At least treat me as good as you treat the illegal aliens, your god.
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:36.000]  We'll be right back to talk about the globalists sucking out the economy.
[1:29:36.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  It's only begun. Your masters are raping you right now.
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:32:47.000 --> 1:33:16.000]  Protect your family.
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:24.000]  Living on the road, my friend, was gonna keep you free and clean.
[1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:32.000]  And now you wear your skin like art, and your breath as hard as kerosene.
[1:33:32.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  You weren't your mama's only boy, but her favorite wanted scene.
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  You began to cry when you said goodbye.
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  Man, I've loved Willie Nelson since I was a little kid.
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  I can't believe he's been a fan of this show for ten years.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  I can't believe he went public against the New World Order on my show.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  I've already lived one hell of a life.
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  Oh, but that's the way it goes.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  Who would have ever thought Charlie Sheen go public on this show?
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  And Andres Romulo or Governor Jesse Ventura?
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  The California congressman a few months ago went public here.
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  San Francisco Chronicle writer saying 9-11's an inside job.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  Or Ray McGovern who went public here.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  Or Paul Craig Roberts.
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  We're gonna go to Bob Chapman, the international forecaster in just one moment.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  I can't play this song though without letting you listen to Merle Ager.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  Here's a little verse coming up here.
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  We're gonna talk a lot in the next 45 minutes with Bob Chapman.
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  The boys tell how far Joe fell.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  And left his living in a cheap hotel.
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  So the story ends, we're told.
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  I don't need your prayers, it's true.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  To save a few, we left it too.
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  He only did what he had to do.
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  And now he's growing old.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:51.000]  I want to tell our police and military something.
[1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  Don't let the New World Order destroy your name.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:59.000]  They're setting you up, they're gonna use you to bring in tyranny.
[1:36:59.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  Then they're gonna have globalist reforms and flush you down the toilet.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  Just like they're using the U.S. to take over the planet right now,
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:11.000]  while at the same time demonizing us globally and making the New World Order look good.
[1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  Rupert Murdoch's newspapers demonize the U.S. worldwide,
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  but then domestically or pro-war, it's all staged.
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  You better realize you're being trapped, you're being set up.
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  Bob Chapman was with Army Intelligence.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  Then of course he had the largest financial newsletter in the U.S. until he retired.
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  Then he came back with the International Forecaster.
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  He is one of the top 10 icons of the Patriot Movement in the last 40 years.
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  You know, Bob, that's a point I don't think you've ever made on my show.
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  I don't think people know that you've been fighting the New World Order since the late 60s.
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  Tell folks before we get into the news and the finances of what's happening
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  just so they know a little bit more about you because you don't toot your own horn.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  How long you been in this? You're a moss back.
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Well, yes, I am.
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  I can remember back in 1964 getting together with Gary Allen and Ed Griffith and Alan Stang.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  We were all headed in the same direction.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  They at that time were all writers.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  I was a wannabe, I guess, and was a stockbroker specializing in gold and silver shears.
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  That's when that evolution started for me.
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  It's been 45 years or so that I've been involved in bringing the truth to people.
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  Boy, I bet things have changed since 1964.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:49.000]  Thank goodness for the Internet because that's really made the big change
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  because we're able to disperse information to so many so quickly and at such a small cost.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  And then we've always had radio programs that talk about the things we talk about,
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  but they were pretty limited in what they could say 25 and 20 and 15 years ago.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  And they were regional.
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  That's true.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  And so they were of limited reach, we'll call it.
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  And of course, today with what's going on, not only with the Internet,
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  but with the stations like this one that carries this kind of information,
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  more and more people are learning how they're being taken.
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  Now, Bob, I want to give you the economy, the food rationing a lot
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  because you've been writing about that for a while.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  But before we do that, I don't know if you've heard about this.
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  It's all over California papers.
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  I've been talking about it for years.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  Now they're, A, why do you think they're now reporting on it?
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  And B, what do you think this means?
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  They admit that 996,000 special plates, you're allowed to drunk drive,
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  you're allowed to run red lights, cops, their families, government workers,
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  CPS child kidnappers, they all, it admits here, this is out of the Monterey Herald,
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  also out of other papers, that they are above the law.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  It says officers have a special cloak of protection, a shield,
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  and that they are above the law.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  Now, I already knew that, but people couldn't believe me.
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  And I remember Aaron Russo saying, he was talking to Nick Rockefeller,
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  and Nick Rockefeller told him, hey, in the new system,
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  we're all going to have a chip at first a card,
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  and that we're all going to be above the law.
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  That is, we in the elite, and that the public are all going to be slaves.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  A, were you aware of this, and B, why do you think they're now reporting on it?
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  Well, I was aware of it, but like yourself, I never had any confirmation.
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  No one would talk about it.
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  And what does it mean, the exposure of it?
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  I really don't know.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  I have to think about that.
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  It all depends on what the source was that exposed it, and how did they find out?
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  Oh, they don't even deny it.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  It's on the books since 1990 in California.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  No, but the generation of the information itself.
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  I mean, you talked about a newspaper, and other newspapers exposing it.
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  What was the original source of exposure?
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  One of them was the Monterey Herald, several others,
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  and it was the papers editorial board put out the loophole,
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  let some avoid tickets tolls.
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  There's another one, Lou Rockwell, out of the way peasants.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  But yeah, that's my question.
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  Why have the papers suddenly decided to question God?
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  I think that shows a split in the power structure.
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  Well, it could very well be.
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  It looks like in order to get that kind of information confirmed,
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  you would have to have had a break in rank, somebody who was really disturbed,
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  that those groups of people were able to do that.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  Well, I tell you, that is a key sign of tyranny in Nazi Germany.
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  You were above the law, you were a party member, and same thing in Russia.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  You're a communist party.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  It goes on in China, too, right now.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  A good example of that, and one of the reasons why they had such speculation
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  in this stock and property markets, particularly along the coast,
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  is that a party member would walk into a bank and say,
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  look, I have a business plan and I have a new corporation,
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  and I need to borrow $7,500,000 equivalent in Yon.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  And they can't refuse them.
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  And of course, most of these loans are never paid back.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  And so the recipient goes off and gambles with the money.
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  He makes money, he hides it, and if he doesn't make money,
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  he throws his hands in the air and says, look, you know, it was a catastrophe,
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:10.000]  and I'm sorry, but I can't pay it back.
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  And because he's a party member, it's okay.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:16.000]  Bob, you lived in South Africa, Europe, you were a military intelligence
[1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  before that, all over the world, saw these systems.
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  99% of the time governments are run by fat cat thugs.
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  Everything turns into third world sess because there's no free market
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  and no one has a reason to work because it's all just sucked off of them
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  and why should they be stolen?
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  It's like the collapse of the Soviet Union, at least on paper.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:40.000]  It's the same system over and over again where a small group of thugs,
[1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:44.000]  just like what you mentioned with China, in China, for those that don't know,
[1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:48.000]  the grandsons of the first generals that took over with Mao,
[1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  they own all the big companies.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  They run it all.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  The people are sick of it.
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  They allow some low level limited free market,
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  but then they come and shake them down.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  And I don't think Americans realize that we're now entering into that.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  We're here in Austin, the former mayors and people openly own the banks
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  that get all the deals for the stolen property they took under environmental guys.
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  They're handing roads over.
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  They're just taking farms and ranches at gunpoint.
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  I mean, it's already here, Bob.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  I mean, it's just where I live for a decade.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  They've been raping the daylights out of people.
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  I mean, just stuff that's hardcore racketeering.
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  I mean, can you describe for people what this means or how it's going to unfold,
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  that black uniforms and secret arrest,
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  and that that's not for the turban people,
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  but that's for you with land and money?
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  Well, I think it's pretty obvious that it's a police state, no matter what you call it.
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  And, you know, we saw that, as you mentioned, in many other societies.
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  And that's the kind of society that we're entering into now
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  or already are in deeply into it.
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  And the manifestations are special license plates for special people
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  who are above the law,
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  and people who operate within law enforcement,
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  who sometimes are worse than the criminals that are on the street,
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  that they're supposed to be picking up.
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:18.000]  You know, I've talked to some attorneys lately about the antics of the FBI and ATF,
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  and it's incredible the things that they do.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  And so we're working towards a, and we're already into,
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:34.000]  as far as I'm concerned, a fascist state in America.
[1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  Well, do you agree that on a curve, we're just going over the hump downward, though?
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:44.000]  What we think is intense right now is that point where you just start moving forward
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  on the water slide towards the pool.
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:50.000]  I would agree with that.
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:56.000]  And in fact, I think most everything that they want is in place.
[1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  All they have to do is have an event or a chain of events
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:06.000]  which would make things happen more quickly,
[1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  and then they would put everything into overdrive,
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  and all of a sudden you would have a takeover of all the banks.
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  You would have a federalization of law enforcement.
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  You would have people like you and I who would be picked up
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:28.000]  and put in internment camps so we can't open our mouths anymore.
[1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  And in all of those manifestations...
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:34.000]  Well, Bob, in their public attack pattern,
[1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:38.000]  they actually will just take me out to a grave,
[1:46:38.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  shoot me in the back of the head and throw me in a pit,
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  or they might want to beat me up for a few days and have fun.
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  You know, I mean, that's what they tend to do.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  You and I will actually be killed.
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.000]  In all probability, yes.
[1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:54.000]  And there's not an awful lot you can do about it.
[1:46:54.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  You can take some of them with you.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:58.000]  I'm not even worried about it. Yeah, I'm not even. I don't care.
[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:00.000]  They're scum, you know.
[1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:02.000]  They're going to lose in the end.
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000]  We're going to take the country back, and one day,
[1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  hundreds of thousands of them are going to be on trial.
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  They're going to get full due process, full jury trials,
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:12.000]  and they're going to hang high.
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:14.000]  Well, you know, it's interesting that you say that.
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  I've said that on other programs,
[1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:20.000]  and I cite the instance in Germany
[1:47:20.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  of the chief of police of Hamburg.
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  And in 1933, the National Socialist Party was elected,
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  and they appointed Adolf Hitler as their chancellor.
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  So one of the first moves that Mr. Hitler did
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  was that he consolidated the police
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:44.000]  and the formulation of the Gestapo and the SS.
[1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:48.000]  And he called this gentleman, whose name I can't remember,
[1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:50.000]  to Berlin and said,
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  look, I know that you dislike me greatly,
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  but you're the greatest police chief and we want you to continue.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  And so he said, fine.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  And so all during the war, he functioned as that police chief,
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  and he was responsible for sending dissidents and others
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000]  off to camps.
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  And some of them were exterminated,
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  and some of them were worth to death.
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  And at the end of the war, they had their trials.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:22.000]  And at Nernberg, he said, they said, why did you do this?
[1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  You know, you were wonderful policemen
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  and you went along with this program.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  You should have argued and not done it.
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  And he said, look, it was the law,
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  and as long as it's a law, I did that.
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  And that's the excuse that these people have.
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  Well, there are laws which are totally immoral,
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  like sending people off to be worked to death,
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  or beaten to death, or shot to death, or whatever.
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  And this is the kind of mentality today
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  that is so prevalent in America.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:56.000]  Well, Bob Chapman, you're absolutely right.
[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  You know, they say truth is stranger than fiction.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  Imagine a fiction book written 30 years ago
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  where the son of a Nazi police chief,
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  a captain, that's equivalent of Colonel in the SS,
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  running an entire city and county,
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  a huge area, groves and surrounding areas,
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  who was, this is admitted,
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  involved in the arrest of thousands,
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  including Austrians, Germans who were sent to death.
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  And then the guy is elected governor of the largest state,
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  seventh largest economy in the world.
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  He wears SS belt buckles on TV.
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  He tells film crews he admires Hitler.
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  He gets ADL awards for being wonderful.
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  And he runs around trying to ban guns in California.
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  I mean, how do you make that typesch?
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  That's what I mean.
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  We're living in the twilight zone, Bob.
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  Well, the people don't want to speak out
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  because they're afraid.
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  They're terrified.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  Particularly people in business who have to work
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  and have to make a living.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Look at the economists and the analysts
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  who work for large corporations.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  They don't dare say there's something wrong,
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  no matter what it may be, because they'll lose their jobs.
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  That's why economists and analysts
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  are wrong two-thirds of the time.
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  I mean, that's a spectacular record.
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  I mean, one would be better off flipping a coin
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  than listening to them.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  And that's just one little segment of society.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  And, you know, I heard an instance recently
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  in a brokerage firm where a compliance officer
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  said that, well, the sale of this stock in our company
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  is going to dilute down the ownership of the people
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  that already are in the company.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  And so what happened was the person was fired.
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  Stay there. I want to hear about this.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  We'll get into the financial end of this with Bob Chapman.

[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  I'm totally blown away. We are changed.
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  The Arnold Schwarzenegger video just came in.
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  We just got it in the mail from two days ago.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  It has Arnold Schwarzenegger picking his nose
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  and considering eating it.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  He considers the...
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  I don't want to sound like a five-year-old. It's just funny.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  But that isn't what matters.
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  We have a close-up of this, by the way.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  It's going up in the next few hours
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  at werchange.org and infowars.com.
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  Little secret. There's already a test video up.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  But Schwarzenegger gets confronted
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  about his Nazi belt buckle, how he loves Hitler.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  Luke could not have done a better job
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  and it gets to Schwarzenegger.
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  That cowardly piece of trash.
[1:54:38.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  Your little black uniforms won't save you, punk.
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  This isn't the movies. You are an enemy.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  And I won't rest until you get out of my country.
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  Piece of trash. You are not going to be our president.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  You piece of trash.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  After all your father did to the good German people
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  and after what you set up over there,
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  you degenerate piece of filth
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  that was bought and paid for by the ADL and others.
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  Why do they give him all these awards?
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  Because they can destroy him anytime they want, folks.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  He's totally compromised.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Let's go back to Bob Chapman.
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Bob, that's why they love Arnold, isn't it?
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  Because they can...
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  They've got all that dirt on him.
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  The makers of Pumping Iron have the video.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  And Arnold admits he made it.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  It was in the...
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  What's the major magazine?
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  The Rolling Stones saw the footage
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  and wrote a story in 79 about it
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  where he said he admires Hitler.
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  The ADL can release that anytime they want.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  How compromise is Arnold Schwarzenegger as their puppet?
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  Totally.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  And that's why he's used the way he's used.
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  And that's why he takes the positions that he does.
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  And that's why George Schultz is his mentor.
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  And Schultz at Bechtel Corporation,
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  former Secretary of State,
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  is one of the top alumnus in the United States.
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  Yeah, Schultz is a top kingmaker.
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  He absolutely is and has been for years.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  In fact, when Bush won the nomination for president in 2000,
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  they admitted on CNN he had to go meet with Schultz
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  at Bohemian Grove to get the nod.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  It's said that Bush Sr. Colin Powell met with Bob Schultz
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  and that he basically gave the go-ahead.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  I've heard the same story.
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  And I'm sure it's true.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  How does Schultz get into that power position?
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  I guess he's just so old.
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  It's whoever's left at the top.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  Well, you know, it's just like David Rockefeller
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  is probably not functioning very well anymore.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  He's in his 90s.
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  And so power, you know, drops down to the next level
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  of younger alumnus.
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  And, you know, in the theoretical area,
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  you've got the Brzezinski and Kissinger.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  But you have so many people that we don't even know the names of.
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  People who have been doing this for many years
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  who are extremely important that we'll never even know about.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  The office is just rolling.
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  Burmese just saw the Arnold Pix's nose, looks at it.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  And the point is, every time you see him,
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  it's a scripted photo, a scripted video.
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  This is absolute gold.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  I'm sorry, Bob.
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  This is just absolute gold, this video.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  We're about to break.
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  We're going to have you to the 20 or 30 after,
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  depending on how long you can stay.
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  Whatever you think is most important economically
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  when we come back in 70 seconds, Bob.
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  And I want to get into this food rationing.
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:34.000]  We have the documents.
[1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  We have the evidence that they have orchestrated this.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  I want to get your take.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  If you agree with that and how they've orchestrated it,
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  why they've orchestrated it with Bob Chapman,
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:46.000]  the website is TheInternationalForecaster.com.

[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:12.000]  A film about political change in D.C.
[1:58:12.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  This is really part two to America's Freedom to Fascism.
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  This film should be just as important as that film.
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:20.000]  We're carrying it discounted at infowars.com.
[1:58:20.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  And also, the Showtime Special,

[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:44.000]  It is a big idea.
[1:58:44.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  A new world order in the near future.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:51.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:58:51.000 --> 1:58:54.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:57.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:58:57.000 --> 1:59:00.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[1:59:00.000 --> 1:59:03.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  For the first time in history,
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:17.000]  You will learn the secret
[1:59:17.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Builder Bird is making big progress for the world government.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  Most people have no idea.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  They're not after money.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:25.000]  They have all the money they need.
[1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  They're after power.

[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  T-minus 30 minutes, Richard Reeves will be in studio with the inside Ron Paul info.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  A lot of key information.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:25.000]  Newsblood's coming up the last 30 minutes of the show.
[2:00:25.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  I'll also open the phones up when Richard Reeves is in studio with us.
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:29.000]  We'll even open the phones up now.
[2:00:29.000 --> 2:00:35.000]  If you want to talk to Bob Chapman in the next 30 minutes, 1-800-259-9231.
[2:00:35.000 --> 2:00:37.000]  1-800-259-9231.
[2:00:37.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  The premiere of the Arnold audio is coming up in about the next 15 minutes or so.
[2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:55.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and go back to Bob Chapman.
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.000]  Bob, you've got the floor.
[2:00:57.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  What's happening with the economy as it continues to deteriorate?
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  Everybody's admitting we're in a recession.
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:05.000]  Bush said last night, the North American Union meeting,
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  that the recession doesn't exist just like the NAU doesn't exist.
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  Mr. Bush wouldn't know the truth if it jumped up and bit him on the cheek.
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:23.000]  But he is incapable of telling the truth about anything.
[2:01:23.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  But getting back to the facts, yes, we've been in a recession for over two years.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  And it became noticeable a year ago, November, in a manufacturing sector.
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  And then this past November, in the consumption area,
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  especially evolving now into services, unemployment's not 5.1%.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  Unemployment is over 14%.
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  And I think the public has really got it now.
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:57.000]  And that's showing up in the figures for consumer confidence.
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  They know that the government is just plainly and simply overwhelmingly lying to them.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  And so the financial end of our economy and the world economy
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  has been, for the last eight months, on the edge of collapse.
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  And the only thing that's kept the financial system from collapsing
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  is money, which is being created and guaranteed by governments,
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:33.000]  such as the United States government, which is being in the case of the United States,
[2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  given out to financial companies by the Federal Reserve,
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  is what's keeping the thing afloat.
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  And it's not going to work.
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:47.000]  The lower interest rates, the increase in money and credit, it will not work.
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  Look back and see that money and credit has been increased by the Federal Reserve
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  for the last four years at over 6%.
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  It's now averaging over 17%.
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  And it's the 18 of 20 major governments are doing the same thing.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  So there'll come a time when no one will want to or very few will want to borrow money
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  or be able to borrow money.
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  And that's when the system's coming down.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  Bob, I know you scant all the financial news.
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  Last week, three different European central bankers came out and said that
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  when the Bear Stearn situation came up in late March,
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  that it almost collapsed the global economy completely, and they say it could happen anytime.
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:29.000]  They're now starting to talk about total implosion.
[2:03:29.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  You're still saying, and I agree with you, that it's controlled.
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  But are they trying to hedge their bet because what they're doing is so dangerous,
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  they may lose control of their bloodsucking and that it may explode out of control?
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  Well, quite frankly, I think it's in part disinformation
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  accompanied by good information, which is not unusual for these people.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  And I still contend that Bear Stearns was a financial assassination.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  And they didn't want anybody to see the books of and in the trouble that JPMorgan Chase was in.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  And they didn't care for Bear Stearns because they were outsiders.
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  And so by absorbing Bear Stearns, that gave cover to the Federal Reserve to energize its own shareholder, JPMorgan Chase.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.000]  Exactly.
[2:04:23.000 --> 2:04:25.000]  Bob Chapman, stay there. We've got a break again.
[2:04:25.000 --> 2:04:27.000]  A long segment coming up. Your calls from Bob Chapman.

[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  Truth is our weapon, and prisonplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:53.000]  Gasoline prices are out of control. Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[2:05:53.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:01.000]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  SFR recently ran this ad, and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  and get another one free of charge.
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:41.000]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping, share in the oil company's secret, and get SFR now.

[2:07:44.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:31.000]  M.O. wrote a news article yesterday titled, it was actually two days ago, on April 21st, Sunday, I said it would be Monday,
[2:08:31.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  food shortages are a globalist depopulation agenda, and then he answers the question with all the declassified government plans, Kissinger's 1974 plan for food control genocide,
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:59.000]  how the IMF and World Bank would go in and make the countries let big agrarian to shut down food production, how they would stage wars to reduce food production and starve people, how they would use IMF and World Bank loans to make countries sign on to that to carry out sterilization and one-child policy.
[2:08:59.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  India tried to enforce it, China is the only successful one to do it, on a large scale, Peru did it, and it's all documented here.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  And then, notice they've said, we need a global tax for world poverty and hunger and for evil carbon that humans exhale that plants breed.
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:25.000]  Forget all the toxic waste, forget all the genetic engineering, all the real environmental problems. No, we need to have 10 million government controlled core led by Al Gore.
[2:09:25.000 --> 2:09:35.000]  This is like Mal's little red book with his youth brigades, the communist youth brigades. This is serious, look it up, I'm not joking, out pushing all of this on us.
[2:09:35.000 --> 2:09:47.000]  And so here they are openly engineering the operation. The public doesn't know how to look these documents up, they don't know about the IMF World Bank documents that came out in 2002, how they admit they engineer it then.
[2:09:47.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  We have multiple sources, Club of Rome documents, CFR documents, Richard N. Haas writing for the CFR in a public paper saying we'll use the threat of terror.
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  This is a decade ago, it was just republished, they're bragging again, and the threat of carbon as a way to quote, make humans the enemy and the state will organize society around making humans the enemy.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  So they're engineering a lot of this, weather place some into it. This is globalization, the country that could feed the world over three to four times depending on which harvest it was which year.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  Now can't even feed itself and imports close to 40% of our food. Bob Chapman, international forecaster, what do you think's really behind this? What's your analysis?
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  Well there are a number of things and I'm going to go through them rather quickly. The first is this higher prices for food and the shortage of food is inflationary.
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  And the inflation has really been caused by the central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve. And so in order to deflect people away from the source, which can be the only source of inflation, the Fed, they create these situations where there's a shortage in this higher prices.
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  Let me stop you, I forgot that point, that's exactly what I saw about a month ago and there's so many facets, I forgot that. They at first were claiming that food prices were up because of a shortage, not because of inflation.
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  Go ahead.
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  And that was the original message. Now the ultimate for this is people control. That's the next step and they would do that by rationing or limiting prices, all of which doesn't work.
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  China's tried it and it doesn't work and Nixon tried it and price controls are ridiculous.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  And the third thing is that one of the major reasons for all of this is, as you pointed out, in the readings that you've read, which I've read as well, they want to get rid of the useless eaters.
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  And that's the third world that just seems to be hanging around. And of course it's a profit center as well and that brings us back to the ethanol aspects of this where a lot of this agricultural produce is going.
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:29.000]  And by the way, not just to interrupt Bob, not just in the US, Brazil, Europe, they're all turning their corn and other things into this ethanol. That's not biofuel, that's done with trash folks.
[2:12:29.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  That's a good thing. This is separate from what Willie Nelson's doing. This is taking the raw materials and engaging in this.
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  On the bottom line, just like the Federal Reserve banks have engineered the financial implosion to consolidate, but as you said, it's gotten out of control, they're engineering much of this and then still posing as the savior.
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:57.000]  That's their formula. Create the crisis, offer the solution. The solution is the next phase of their intensifying control.
[2:12:57.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  I agree. And Brazil is using sugar. Europe, like we are using corn and other things, which takes away from production for edible grains and beans and things like that, which people need.
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  Now, the profit center aspect would be 85% of ethanol, which is produced, at least in the United States, is produced by ADM, Archer Daniels Midland. And that company, the majority ownership, lies in the hands of the Andrews family, who are all illuminous.
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  So where do you see this going? They have food riots in over 50 countries. They're reporting on a daily basis from Indonesia to Egypt, from areas of Africa.
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  I mean, there's all sorts of crises, all sorts of strikes, all sorts of power outages. It's like civilization. And this isn't just over-reportage. They're actually under-reporting it.
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:11.000]  It's like things are unraveling. Is it that the globalists have gotten so busy snatching up the infrastructure and have gotten so greedy that they're not even managing things well now and things are just unspooling?
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:33.000]  Well, it's plant chaos. And it's all part of the things like, when you have financial problems, like back in 2000, 2001, I predicted there would be an incident, which happened to be 9-11, and that there would be an invasion of Iraq and Afghanistan, and why to keep people's eye off the ball.
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  If you have wars going on over there, people aren't paying that much attention to what's going on in the economy, and the fact that, at that time, we were in a recession.
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  Of course, we were pulled out by this gargantuan creation of money and credit and the boom that turned into a bust and a bubble by the Federal Reserve and the housing market.
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  And so this is another distraction, this let's starve them to death situation. And that's exactly what they're doing, and it's not going to stop. They're going to keep right up with it.
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  Even the G7 said the other day at their meeting, we're going to stop making ethanol from edible agricultural products. And I didn't hear anything else after that.
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:28.000]  It's amazing. I want to take some calls, Bob, but there's other financial things happening of the entire pantheon of developments in the next few minutes.
[2:15:28.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  What is important that you'd like to impart to our audience before we take calls?
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  Well, I think the most important thing that people should realize is that the financial system is broken, and they are not going to be able to resuscitate it.
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  They're going to be able to extend it for some period of time. That period of time is unknown, two, three, four, five years at the very most.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  And in the meantime, what do they do to offset that? They'll have more wars. They'll probably have a draft and selective service.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  They'll continue with their weather-controlled disasters, such as New Orleans, and the things we're talking about here, about the price of food and the unavailability of food.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:30.000]  Let me stop you again. For listeners out there laughing, it's on the weather channel. It's declassified. When it got declassified, I had the father of modern weather weapons,
[2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  meteorologist Ben Livingston on the show twice, and he came to Austin for me to interview him. It's on prisonplanet.tv.
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:49.000]  They had certified in 67, Stanford Research Institute, Naval Weapons Laboratory that he ran, that they could create, kill, stop, steer, empower, weaken anything they want with hurricanes.
[2:16:49.000 --> 2:16:52.000]  And that was with primitive technology, Bob.
[2:16:52.000 --> 2:16:55.000]  And it's probably a lot better now.
[2:16:55.000 --> 2:17:01.000]  Well, meteorologists said that Katrina acted very bizarre, and that they did blow it up in the flood of the 20s.
[2:17:01.000 --> 2:17:10.000]  And the evidence is they did blow up the levees this time as a big martial law drill and as a way to snatch the property and give it to casino builders, which they've now done.
[2:17:10.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  That's right. And that's how they evolve these things. And they're all planned. Some of these plans are 20 and 30 years in the making.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:30.000]  Well, one year before New Orleans, one year before New Orleans, they made the movie for FX Channel Oil Storm starring Mayor Ney Negan, Ray Negan, where a hurricane hits and floods New Orleans.
[2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:33.000]  Sorry, go ahead.
[2:17:33.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  Well, I kind of let me flat foot it here, but these different events are all part of a move to make people confused, so they won't act on things, so that they don't understand things.
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:18:03.000]  I mean, you come out and say, we had the people who, the person who was involved in weather alteration of the program, and yes, it is a fact. That's great.
[2:18:03.000 --> 2:18:12.000]  And then a lot of people are going to believe it because you've had him on, but most of the people don't listen to these programs.
[2:18:12.000 --> 2:18:27.000]  And so consequently, most of the people are going to believe what they hear on the news, on the general media. And so consequently, people are going to remain confused because they really don't know what the truth is.
[2:18:27.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  Bob, I was backing up to get it out to them.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  I agree. I was backing up what you were saying because people probably almost ran off the road when you said that.
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  And weather, I mean, they flooded the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Vietnam. They had weather control. I mean, this, much of this is declassified.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:54.000]  And it's just the globalists are playing golf. We're going to do one more little quick segment with Bob. We're going to take three calls, one from DeWayne and Mike and one from Joe.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:59.000]  Bill, Chris and others, you can hold. We'll get to you after Bob is gone. We're going to break now and come back with just a five minute segment.
[2:18:59.000 --> 2:19:07.000]  Take three quick questions for Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com. In the 30 seconds we've got left, Bob, pick a date.
[2:19:07.000 --> 2:19:15.000]  I mean, so you're saying you don't think the economy will implode completely in the next year. You think, though, on the outside, four to five years?
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:20.000]  So are you saying two years from now? On average, you're saying that's probably the date? Or what are you saying?
[2:19:20.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  No.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:25.000]  You're saying you don't know?
[2:19:25.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  I don't know.
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:35.000]  Well, it seems to me things are deteriorating faster than even I thought they would. And I hope we've got three, four years.
[2:19:35.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  But a lot of people are out of work. The truck drivers I know are going out of business. I mean, it is just amazing what's happening.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  Final segment, Bob Chapman, your call straight ahead. Stay with us.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:52.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:57.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:57.000 --> 2:20:03.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[2:20:03.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:26.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[2:20:26.000 --> 2:20:29.000]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:29.000 --> 2:20:33.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power.

[2:23:50.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  Alright, the Arnold Schwarzenegger audio of it being called a Nazi, and key info being brought up really upset the weak coward.
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:05.000]  We'll love you playing that audio coming out in the next segment.
[2:24:05.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  Let's go back to Bob Chapman and your calls. Joe in Arkansas on the network phone number. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  I'm Joe from Wisconsin, but it's good to talk to you, Bob and Alex. I just wanted to comment on the food situation.
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:26.000]  Monsanto is building that seed bank up in Scandinavia, but at the same time they're also pushing GMO foods on us.
[2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:33.000]  And that doesn't necessarily scare me, but they had this outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in England.
[2:24:33.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  It all relates back. It was one of these contaminated releases that their solution was scorched earth.
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  By the way, it was admitted that the government released it. Go ahead.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  Yeah, it was a scorched earth policy though. They just killed all the herds for like thousands of miles. Just kill everything.
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:25:00.000]  And what scares me most is now with their seed bank, they can say, oh, the entire biosphere we contaminated, well, we'll just have to scorch earth all of you.
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:09.000]  Well, the inflation rate also is, you know, under my skin too, but I'm most concerned about what they're going to do about food.
[2:25:09.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  Okay, let's go to Bob and get his take on that. Yeah, Monsanto's business plan they admit is to infect everything. Go ahead.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  Well, I've been very, very disturbed with what Monsanto and a few other firms have been doing for the last 15 years. I've been writing about it.
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  And in the process, Monsanto has made a great deal of money. And I don't think most people realize that.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  Now, this stock has gone from $18 a share to close to 100, and that is as a result of their earnings.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:26:04.000]  And I think what the intention of the alumnus is through Monsanto and that handful of firms, they want to control in total all of the production of food in the world.
[2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  And that's why they literally block anybody from suing Monsanto or stopping their activities. They are a part of the larger program.
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  You can always tell when something's on the inside track because it's given total protection.
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:34.000]  Exactly. And that's what's gone on with them and others. And if you notice, there's merges and merges and merges. And when all is said and done, we'll have two or three firms doing what Monsanto is doing, and that'll be it.
[2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:41.000]  And then they'll all just intermarry and it'll be a new Imperium. Thanks for the call, Joe, wherever you're at.
[2:26:41.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  Let's talk to DeWayne in New Mexico. You're on the air. Go ahead. Go ahead, DeWayne. You're on the air.
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:27:00.000]  Awesome. First, I wanted to say what's up to Kurt. We missed him in his old job, but I'm glad he's fighting the fight and doing what he needs to do.
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:16.000]  I've been doing a lot of video-watching and reading on mind control experiments and so on and so forth, and I was reading an article you guys reposted by Alex to answer about mind control through television and how it accesses the reptilian brain and so on and so forth.
[2:27:16.000 --> 2:27:30.000]  Anyways, I was wondering with food prices going the way they are and fuel prices going the way they are and these crazy conspiracy theorists who mentioned that fuel prices and food prices were going to be skyrocketing.
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  Everything is now coming true, yet you still see people ignoring all the evidence of total collapse happening.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  The mainstream media doesn't comment on intense cities and everybody says it's okay. Bembernake admits to the Federal Reserve causing the first Great Depression and then everybody's okay with the Federal Reserve causing this next one.
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:55.000]  Obviously, people aren't waking up.
[2:27:55.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  Look, look, look. In disasters, when they tell people that a dam is broken and high water is coming in five minutes, there's always a percentage that will deny it and stay and die.
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:14.000]  There are always people when a ship is sinking who refuse to leave saying everything's fine. They are in denial, but they were the minority a hundred years ago.
[2:28:14.000 --> 2:28:17.000]  The government, the psychological warfare experts have ingrained-
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.000]  They've ingrained in the others.
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  Exactly, have ingrained the public on how to be cowardly, denial-stricken creatures. Bob Chapman?
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:28.000]  Yeah.
[2:28:28.000 --> 2:28:38.000]  I agree. It's human nature to take the easy way out and say, gee, I hope it doesn't happen. I don't believe it can happen and it's not going to happen.
[2:28:38.000 --> 2:28:45.000]  It's just all too many people are doing that today. Probably 70 to 75% of the population.
[2:28:45.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  It includes a lot of bright people who just can't be bothered by naysayers who bring all these facts to light because they just think it can't happen.
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:06.000]  Well, aside from getting everybody to take out their TVs into the middle of nowhere and lighting them up with 223, what exactly can we do?
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:13.000]  It seems like everybody is okay with everything going to hell in a handbasket. Even though they're starving, they don't want to fight.
[2:29:13.000 --> 2:29:18.000]  And once they're starving to the point of no return, it's too late. They're going to be too weak to fight.
[2:29:18.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  Most of the public will beg the black uniformed thugs to stab them with bayonets and kill their children.
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:31.000]  And that sounds sarcastic, but no, a lot of them love being slaves. Bob Chapman, thank you for spending all the time with us today, sir.
[2:29:31.000 --> 2:29:34.000]  I'll be back and thank you for having me.
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:39.000]  You bet. We'll be right back ourselves, ladies and gentlemen. Stay with us. More calls straight ahead.
[2:29:39.000 --> 2:29:49.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:49.000 --> 2:29:56.000]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle-MD. I'm the Neutromatical Report here on Genesys. Allison's Natural Antibiotic from Allamax Neutrocynicals U.S. is a real thing.

[2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:20.000]  Acinetobacter infections of ravage or everyday health. Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies of disease activators that cause chronic health issues

[2:31:55.000 --> 2:32:02.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.

[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  Everybody knows that the boat is leaking. Everybody knows the captain line.
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  Everybody got this broken feeling like their father or their daughters died.
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  Everybody talking to their pockets. Everybody wants a box of chocolate and a long stem rose.
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  Everybody knows. Everybody knows that you love me baby. Everybody knows that you really do.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:28.000]  Everybody knows that you've been faithful. Give or take a night or two.
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:42.000]  Everybody knows you've been discreet but there were so many people you just had to meet without your clothes.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  Everybody knows. Everybody knows.
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:57.000]  Richard Reeves is going to be in studio with us coming up here in about five minutes.
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  I am going to stream the YouTube video down line for prisonplanet.tv members.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:12.000]  This is just a Schwarzenegger test video. This has not been put out yet on the main YouTube channel.
[2:35:12.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  That's why we're not giving the address out because Luke wants to do a better encoding of it, which is great.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  But just for prisonplanet.tv viewers who are watching right now, the radio listeners are listening on the internet.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  They're listening on satellite. They're listening on AM and FM dial. That's all free.
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  Just for prisonplanet.tv members, they're able to see the studio cam, the document cam.
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:38.000]  They're able to see all of it. We're about to play this Schwarzenegger being confronted by Luke Radowski.
[2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:44.000]  Other members of We Are Changed. The video starts with Arnold picking his nose and examining the contents.
[2:35:44.000 --> 2:35:48.000]  It is soft work, but it just shows everything scripted.
[2:35:48.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  How the media covers up and only shows the good side or the flattering side of Schwarzenegger.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:35:58.000]  And then Luke walks beside him and people try to push him off and try to stop him and try to threaten him.
[2:35:58.000 --> 2:36:02.000]  Bringing up Kirk Volltime, bringing up Arnold Wears Nazi belt buckles. It's just amazing.
[2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:06.000]  I want to commend We Are Changed and I want to just commend everybody out there.
[2:36:06.000 --> 2:36:12.000]  So here is the video of this, ladies and gentlemen, the audio for the radio listeners.
[2:36:12.000 --> 2:36:23.000]  Prisonplanet.tv members. This is the maiden voyage you are seeing this video now for the first time.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:54.000]  How are you doing, Arnold?
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  Arnold, can I get your comment on Kirk Volltime?
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:18.000]  Did you all meet Timbo? Did you all know Timbo, one of the great students of this university here?
[2:37:18.000 --> 2:37:42.000]  Anyone on Kirk Volltime, sir?
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:03.000]  Hey guys, so Arnold, what about Kirk Volltime? What about him?
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:05.000]  Comment on him. He's your buddy, right?
[2:38:05.000 --> 2:38:06.000]  Can I help you out?
[2:38:06.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  I was just asking a question. You wanted to answer my question beforehand. I was there in front.
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  I'm Aaron McLeer, Governor's Press Secretary.
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  There you go. My name is Luke.
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Hi, Luke.
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:14.000]  Oh, you're the Secretary then?
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:15.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  What do you need? I don't understand your power of question, Sam. What can I help you with?
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  With Kirk Volltime, we just want to comment.
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:22.000]  Please, Kirk Volltime.
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:26.000]  It's his good friend, good buddy. We just want to comment from him about his relationship with him first.
[2:38:26.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  Okay. Thanks, Arnold.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:29.000]  What's this?
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:31.000]  This is just something my friend gave it to me.
[2:38:31.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  Okay.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:33.000]  And what are all these things?
[2:38:33.000 --> 2:38:34.000]  These are the press passes.
[2:38:34.000 --> 2:38:35.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:35.000 --> 2:38:36.000]  How did you get them?
[2:38:36.000 --> 2:38:40.000]  I registered. I come from Austin, Texas. I'm a reporter.
[2:38:40.000 --> 2:38:41.000]  Okay.
[2:38:41.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  Austin, Texas.
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:47.000]  Infowars.com. You get a chance to check out that website.
[2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:49.000]  It's full of people, a lot of people.
[2:38:49.000 --> 2:38:51.000]  You work for the university as security?
[2:38:51.000 --> 2:38:52.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:52.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  Okay.
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:54.000]  Just to make sure everything's okay?
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:55.000]  Yeah.
[2:38:55.000 --> 2:38:56.000]  Any questions, I'm here. Ask me.
[2:38:56.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  Okay.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:38:59.000]  This is just a journalist. I'll do our job.
[2:38:59.000 --> 2:39:00.000]  Okay.
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  All right. Thank you.
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:27.000]  We were very nice to Arnold Schwarzenegger in the beginning, but since he never wanted to answer any of our questions, we decided to step it up a notch.
[2:39:27.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  Arnold, you still got your Nazi belt on?
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  Yeah.
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:32.000]  You got the SS belt on today, Arnold?
[2:39:32.000 --> 2:39:33.000]  You got the SS belt on?
[2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:41.000]  Why don't you answer questions about your friend Wildheim, who's a known Nazi war criminal?
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:43.000]  What did you do at the Bohemian Grove, sir?
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  What did you do at the Bohemian Grove?
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:47.000]  You came to the Bohemian Grove?
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:48.000]  Yes, you did.
[2:39:48.000 --> 2:39:49.000]  Well, I lived because of you.
[2:39:49.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  I just threw you out of the inside, sir.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:52.000]  You've been out of here.
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:54.000]  Do you have the SS belt on again?
[2:39:54.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  What about your father, who was an SS officer?
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  Your stepfather was an SS officer.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  Yes, sir. You said in your book you loved Hitler.
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  You did.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:03.000]  It's a comment.
[2:40:17.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  So, Arnold, no comment about your friend Wildheim, who's a known Nazi war criminal, who you said you loved publicly, sir?
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:27.000]  I'm not doing anything bad.
[2:40:27.000 --> 2:40:29.000]  Answer the questions. What about your friend?
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:30.000]  I'm not doing anything bad.
[2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:32.000]  Don't worry, Bobby. I ain't...
[2:40:45.000 --> 2:40:47.000]  Slow down on me. Remember.
[2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:49.000]  Any comment?
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  Any comments on Kirk Wildheim, your good friend, who you said you loved, who's a Nazi war criminal?
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:55.000]  Any comments on that?
[2:40:55.000 --> 2:40:57.000]  Mr. Governor, is this on a baseball?
[2:40:57.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  Excuse me.
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  This time of year to go, I'll go.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:03.000]  Arnold, what about when we go?
[2:41:03.000 --> 2:41:05.000]  You coming out yet, Arnold?
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  No problem.
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:11.000]  Mr. Governor, is this on a baseball?
[2:41:11.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  Arnold, thanks for coming in.
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:14.000]  Thank you, Arnold.
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  We know that you're a Nazi, and this is not going to be hidden. We know that, sir.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  You're a Nazi history. You won't be...
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  Governor.
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:22.000]  Stay on the sidewalk.
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  Stay on the sidewalk.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:25.000]  Hey, Tripp.
[2:41:25.000 --> 2:41:27.000]  Hey, Tripp.
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:29.000]  Stay on the sidewalk, please.
[2:41:29.000 --> 2:41:31.000]  Mr. Governor, please.
[2:41:31.000 --> 2:41:33.000]  Can you sign the autograph for me?
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:35.000]  Arnold, thanks for coming, Arnold.
[2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.000]  Arnold, please.
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  You will never get a new old daughter.
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  Arnold, please.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  Arnold, please.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:45.000]  Arnold, we know that you're a Nazi.
[2:41:45.000 --> 2:41:47.000]  Stand back. Stand back.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:49.000]  Can you give the graduation speech, please?
[2:41:49.000 --> 2:41:55.000]  Oh, my.
[2:41:55.000 --> 2:41:57.000]  Please, one more time, please.
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:01.000]  But that is only a little bit of exchange because
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:03.000]  the book of the ACA,
[2:42:03.000 --> 2:42:05.000]  the book of the ACA...
[2:42:05.000 --> 2:42:07.000]  The book of the ACA...
[2:42:07.000 --> 2:42:09.000]  The book of the ACA...
[2:42:09.000 --> 2:42:11.000]  Okay, folks.
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:13.000]  We are back live here,
[2:42:13.000 --> 2:42:16.000]  and we're gonna be taking calls later in the show
[2:42:16.000 --> 2:42:23.400]  this hour and into the fourth hour today. Again, Luke, we just got in the mail this
[2:42:23.400 --> 2:42:28.920]  morning, the Arnold Schwarzenegger footage that we were just streaming to PresidentPlanet.tv
[2:42:28.920 --> 2:42:34.840]  viewers. You notice it's a YouTube template, but this is a test because they're uploading
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:43.440]  a better quality version of it right now. This one cut off some of the websites and
[2:42:43.440 --> 2:42:53.000]  things, so they're redoing it. That's why we're not showing you the title of the video
[2:42:53.000 --> 2:42:56.520]  because it's a test video, but the higher quality one will be up in the next hour or
[2:42:56.520 --> 2:43:06.480]  so at wearchange.org, infowars.com. Wearchange, Rhode Island, where this took place. And these
[2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:10.000]  individuals, there's a lot more in the video, people freaking out that they dare talk bad
[2:43:10.000 --> 2:43:14.560]  about their God, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now, understand his father was an SS captain who
[2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:18.840]  ran an entire city and sent thousands of their deaths, that's admitted. Then when his father
[2:43:18.840 --> 2:43:30.360]  died, his mother married the number two SS guy from World War II in Austria. Just amazing.
[2:43:30.360 --> 2:43:35.640]  But this type of stuff was going on. Here's the black ski mask police and their little
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:44.720]  German outfits. I don't want to bash the Germans, their little Nazi outfits to keep Lord Schwarzenegger
[2:43:44.720 --> 2:43:52.640]  safe from the evil American rabble. The cops get to be above the law and get to drink and
[2:43:52.640 --> 2:43:58.240]  drive and get to do whatever they want. So it's fun to be part of that whole system.
[2:43:58.240 --> 2:44:07.080]  Okay, till about 30 after in the next hour, so for the next 40 minutes or so, we're going
[2:44:07.080 --> 2:44:21.640]  to have my good friend Richard Reeves here in studio with us. And Richard has been deeply
[2:44:21.640 --> 2:44:25.320]  involved with the local Ron Paul campaign, the local Ron Paul meetup group here in Austin,
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:29.080]  one of the largest in the country. And he was bringing up broker convention to me six,
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:34.040]  eight months ago before it was all the big buzz. And so I thought that I would have Richard
[2:44:34.040 --> 2:44:40.000]  Reeves in studio with us because there's some people in the camp who, if you say that Ron
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:44.440]  Paul isn't going to be president, they will get mad at you and say that you're an Alcatraz
[2:44:44.440 --> 2:44:49.360]  terrorist. Basically, I'm joking, but they say, you know, next to that. And then there
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:53.040]  are others who say, no, we're just trying to take over the party, take over the state
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:44:58.280]  and federal platform of the party. We're trying to inject real issues at the convention.
[2:44:58.280 --> 2:45:06.000]  I'm all for that. Some have misconstrued what I have said and have claimed that I am against
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:10.040]  Ron Paul people becoming delegates. That's not what I said. I have just talked people
[2:45:10.040 --> 2:45:16.040]  in Minnesota and in Tennessee and in Missouri and other places where they were told of the
[2:45:16.040 --> 2:45:22.280]  Ron Paul campaign at the delegate process at the county level months ago, that if you
[2:45:22.280 --> 2:45:32.880]  are a delegate and if four Ron, four John McCain votes, then you need to, you need to
[2:45:32.880 --> 2:45:48.600]  then go vote for McCain. I rarely have coughing attacks on air and I'm having one. It's about
[2:45:48.600 --> 2:45:57.200]  every five year occurrence. I'm not quite sure why I'm having one, but perhaps somebody
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:07.800]  can get me some water. Actually, I do know why. I was eating a sandwich and you're eating
[2:46:07.800 --> 2:46:11.840]  sandwiches like in a three minute break trying to gobble the whole thing and you end up having
[2:46:11.840 --> 2:46:16.120]  some go down the wrong hole. Then you ignore it and I guess having a little piece of food
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:28.280]  in your lungs doesn't feel too good. All right, I'm feeling better now. Richard, you having
[2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:29.280]  fun in here?
[2:46:29.280 --> 2:46:33.600]  Yes, sir. I think my ears just got blown out there. Alex, thanks for having me in the big
[2:46:33.600 --> 2:46:35.240]  Info Wars ivory tower today.
[2:46:35.240 --> 2:46:44.320]  Yeah, yeah, ivory. Oh my God. Oh, geez. Yeah, I muted the mics and tried to roar the piece
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:49.040]  of food out of my lungs. It didn't work, but it dislodged it for a second. I want to start
[2:46:49.040 --> 2:46:54.400]  over here, Richard, while I compose myself, just tell us about yourself and why this is
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:59.760]  so important and there's different camps in this whole movement that I support. There's
[2:46:59.760 --> 2:47:03.320]  a few camps that I just think are misguided, but I mean, try to break down the delegate
[2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:09.000]  process and how these things really work for people who are layman out there.
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:12.920]  Okay. Well, ultimately, the bottom line is, let me start with the bottom line. What this
[2:47:12.920 --> 2:47:17.040]  is about is the number one thing you talk about all the time and that's waking people
[2:47:17.040 --> 2:47:22.040]  up. It's getting in the Republican party, waking these people up, getting them on our
[2:47:22.040 --> 2:47:27.360]  team and the consequence of that and a side effect of that is growing our numbers, waking
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:31.760]  people up, grows our numbers and says simply what it's all about. And at the same time,
[2:47:31.760 --> 2:47:37.000]  we can enjoy the synergy of taking back the Republican party, which is one of the major
[2:47:37.000 --> 2:47:40.440]  parties in our country. It's like you've got two big battleships out there when it
[2:47:40.440 --> 2:47:44.600]  comes to parties. You've got the Republican battleship and the Democrat battleship and
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:48.760]  the Republican battleship is listening to one side. Thanks to the bad leadership they've
[2:47:48.760 --> 2:47:54.200]  had for so long that we've got a real opportunity and Aaron Russo talked about this on one of
[2:47:54.200 --> 2:47:59.520]  the last interviews he had with you prior to his passing. He talked about trying to
[2:47:59.520 --> 2:48:04.720]  get in the Republican party and getting it taken over. Now, I know that the focus unfortunately
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:09.800]  has been a lot about the possibility of a brokered convention and that was a very valid
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:15.760]  possibility up till when Romney suspended, when Romney suspended, when he stepped out,
[2:48:15.760 --> 2:48:19.760]  which I think was March, it was right after the March primaries. No, actually, I think
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:25.960]  it was February, February 5th or 6th, about two days after Super Tuesday, when Romney
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:30.200]  stepped out, then that really reduced the chances of having a brokered convention. And
[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:34.840]  we can talk about the details of that. But bottom line is I'm very, very excited about
[2:48:34.840 --> 2:48:38.920]  what's happened over the last year and a half. And at the same time, I'm frustrated as well.
[2:48:38.920 --> 2:48:47.240]  But in general, we have a lot to be excited about going forward. And the thing about us
[2:48:47.240 --> 2:48:53.080]  becoming delegates, like I say, we get involved in the Republican party. We're going to send
[2:48:53.080 --> 2:48:59.320]  a contingent here in Texas somewhere between 10 and 30 percent, Ron Paul loyal delegates
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:03.800]  to the state convention. As a matter of fact, one of the projects we're working on now is
[2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:09.280]  we're going to be sending out DVDs to the entire delegation and including the alternate
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:12.680]  delegates that are going to the state convention in Houston. We're going to be sending them
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:17.440]  out DVDs. So we're going to work on waking those people up. And that's what needs to
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:22.440]  happen all over the country. We need to have all these Ron Paul meetup groups, which by
[2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:27.040]  the way, that is one of the most exciting things that's come out of this whole thing
[2:49:27.040 --> 2:49:33.360]  are these Ron Paul meetup groups prior to January of 07. We really didn't have any way
[2:49:33.360 --> 2:49:39.200]  to link up patriots, liberty and freedom lovers all over the United States. We didn't have
[2:49:39.200 --> 2:49:44.160]  a way to link them all up, get them networked together. And those Ron Paul meetup groups
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:48.920]  really made that possible. So I would encourage all the folks out there in this audience that
[2:49:48.920 --> 2:49:53.720]  I know are awake about the New World Order, their hip on the left-right paradigm being
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:58.480]  a fraud. They know about the Federal Reserve. I would encourage them to by all means, we've
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:03.640]  got to keep these Ron Paul meetup groups all over the states and counties, cities, you
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:08.200]  name it. They need to keep on going and growing their numbers.
[2:50:08.200 --> 2:50:12.520]  By the way, this information is so important that I'm not even going to go to break myself
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:16.160]  on my end of the internet streams and for President Plenidot TV viewers. The network
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:20.360]  will break here in a few minutes. I'm just going to continue and then we'll come back
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:27.920]  for the AFM affiliates and short affiliates that are out there. We are with Richard Reeves.
[2:50:27.920 --> 2:50:32.320]  He is a coordinator here in Austin, really doing a great job keeping the Ron Paul revolution
[2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:38.800]  going. And I'm going to try to clarify my position on all of this and where I stand
[2:50:38.800 --> 2:50:49.120]  when we get back. Stay with us.
[2:50:49.120 --> 2:51:07.520]  It is a big idea. A New World Order. For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they
[2:51:07.520 --> 2:51:13.760]  hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[2:51:13.760 --> 2:51:21.760]  is at hand. For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown

[2:52:47.760 --> 2:52:52.240]  I don't mind that I'm getting older but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile. It
[2:52:52.240 --> 2:52:56.480]  was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth and those crow's feet over
[2:52:56.480 --> 2:53:01.360]  by my eyes. People were starting to think I looked unhappy but really I was just embarrassed
[2:53:01.360 --> 2:53:06.280]  by those wrinkles. Then I heard about a product called Tottenall. Tottenall is a serum that
[2:53:06.280 --> 2:53:11.320]  goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles and

[2:54:13.840 --> 2:54:19.320]  We're back live talking to Richard Reeves. He does some camera work for us and also a
[2:54:19.320 --> 2:54:25.280]  local Austin activist. He's been intimately involved in this move to get Ron Paul people
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:31.560]  to take over the delegate positions. Richard, try to describe the different camps because
[2:54:31.560 --> 2:54:35.600]  from my perspective there are different camps. There are people that say he will be president.
[2:54:35.600 --> 2:54:41.160]  We are going to take the delegates. John McCain will not be the nominee. The meanwhile, Ron
[2:54:41.160 --> 2:54:47.520]  Paul is saying, no, it looks like McCain will be the nominee. If your delegate is for McCain,
[2:54:47.520 --> 2:54:51.360]  give it to McCain. Then I just point that out and people say, oh, I'm making that up.
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:55.960]  It's not true. Then they say that I don't support Ron, but people taking over the delegates.
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:54:59.360]  When I've said I think they should take over the delegates, take over the platforms, inject
[2:54:59.360 --> 2:55:04.160]  real issues, take over the party to stop election fraud and to be able to inform other
[2:55:04.160 --> 2:55:09.640]  Republicans and wake them up to the fact that the main line Republican party is not constitutionalist
[2:55:09.640 --> 2:55:14.120]  and it's two sides of the same coin. That's my position. Maybe I should ask it this way.
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:19.840]  What is your view of what this delegate takeover is really about, Richard Reeves?
[2:55:19.840 --> 2:55:24.320]  Well, my view is that we just need to do what Ron Paul has said, and that's to have as many
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:29.880]  delegates there at St. Paul Convention as possible. Now, will that be enough to win?
[2:55:29.880 --> 2:55:34.120]  Who knows? I mean, the only possibility I'm saying, Ron Paul does want everybody to take
[2:55:34.120 --> 2:55:35.560]  over the delegates for him.
[2:55:35.560 --> 2:55:38.960]  Well, he said that in the past. I haven't heard him in the last month, what he said
[2:55:38.960 --> 2:55:40.080]  on that. But the thing of it is,
[2:55:40.080 --> 2:55:46.000]  Well, where is he saying that he wants the people that are taking over the delegates
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:47.280]  to make him the nominee?
[2:55:47.280 --> 2:55:52.160]  Well, on the website in the past on RonPaul2008.com, he said, what we want to do is ultimately
[2:55:52.160 --> 2:55:57.280]  have as many delegates vote for Ron Paul as possible up at the St. Paul Convention. And
[2:55:57.280 --> 2:56:02.000]  as far as I know, that's still the stance. Now, that being said, that does not mean that
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:07.360]  he wants people that are bound to John McCain. Like here in Texas, the rules of the Republican
[2:56:07.360 --> 2:56:14.160]  Party state that the delegates that go to the St. Paul Convention are bound and contracted
[2:56:14.160 --> 2:56:19.440]  to vote for John McCain. So on those, I say we don't mess with those. We follow the rules.
[2:56:19.440 --> 2:56:23.560]  But to be clear, there are some people, because this is a grassroots deal, who want them all?
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:27.760]  Well, and of course that's fine. But the thing is to me, the more realistic, I think
[2:56:27.760 --> 2:56:31.760]  Ron Paul, they're still an outside chance that something can happen. I mean, we know
[2:56:31.760 --> 2:56:35.500]  John McCain has had health issues in the past. Look at Gary Hart years ago, one of your
[2:56:35.500 --> 2:56:42.000]  favorite CFR guys, Gary Hart was a big leader in the Democrat Party for nomination back
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:47.120]  a few elections ago. He had it in. He went down. And the other thing about McCain is
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:51.200]  he has got federal election commission problems in a big way.
[2:56:51.200 --> 2:56:54.800]  Well, that's the thing. He openly goes to England and every one of those contributions
[2:56:54.800 --> 2:56:59.000]  is a felony. And so does Hillary and nobody. I mean, they just commit felonies everywhere.
[2:56:59.000 --> 2:57:03.800]  Well, I understand that. But with the FEC case, the part I'm talking about is that he
[2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:09.520]  agreed to do public financing of his presidential campaign back sometime in 07. In the fall
[2:57:09.520 --> 2:57:15.680]  of 07, he used that potential money that he's now maxed that out. And now he's, well, there's
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:21.480]  actually kind of three issues on it. He used the public financing opportunity coming up.
[2:57:21.480 --> 2:57:26.440]  He used that as a way to actually collateralize a loan to continue his campaign in the fall
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:31.760]  of 07. Then on top of that, since he accepted public financing, the grease, the skids were
[2:57:31.760 --> 2:57:35.800]  greased for him to get on ballots all over the United States, which normally he would
[2:57:35.800 --> 2:57:40.200]  have had to pay fees or maybe gather signatures. He had a lot of hoops that he had to jump
[2:57:40.200 --> 2:57:44.600]  to get on these ballots that by accepting the public financing for presidential race,
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:49.240]  he was put on these ballots basically for free. And that was, that's now controversy
[2:57:49.240 --> 2:57:54.360]  as well. Then the third, I mean, there's no doubt that they mean to give it to a Democrat.
[2:57:54.360 --> 2:57:58.760]  He's a dead horse. They're just running to make it look like a kind of like Bob Dole.
[2:57:58.760 --> 2:58:06.520]  He's a Bob Dole candidate. Exactly. That they ran against Clinton. So you guys think that
[2:58:06.520 --> 2:58:10.520]  the media is not going to destroy him until he gets the nomination officially, and then
[2:58:10.520 --> 2:58:15.840]  they'll destroy him. So our job to inform the Republican party and those conventioneers
[2:58:15.840 --> 2:58:19.680]  and delegates, Hey, these are issues with John McCain. So we need to do that. Richard,
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:23.240]  I totally agree. There we go. That's where I think you guys should take over the delegates.
[2:58:23.240 --> 2:58:31.160]  I've just been told that I need to support trying to push him for president. Thank you

[2:59:58.600 --> 3:00:05.080]  We are now into our number four, Richard Reeves, a little coordinator to try to get Ron Paul
[3:00:05.080 --> 3:00:09.920]  the delegates. Maybe we should start here. I know a lot of the audience knows this. A
[3:00:09.920 --> 3:00:15.680]  lot of them understand this, Richard. But explain how the delegate process, how the
[3:00:15.680 --> 3:00:20.520]  electoral college works, how nominations work, how this works that we've had broker
[3:00:20.520 --> 3:00:25.440]  conventions before. And certainly, it was a close race of just four or five points.
[3:00:25.440 --> 3:00:30.880]  You could have Ron Paul behind McCain in the convention, have a revolt, and then have Ron
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:35.280]  Paul win the nomination. But even when it's two, three points difference, it is political
[3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:40.120]  suicide, and they've been failures in the last hundred years when they've had them.
[3:00:40.120 --> 3:00:43.720]  For the candidate who's behind, because it looks like they're trying to take popular
[3:00:43.720 --> 3:00:48.360]  vote, the delegates are supposed to represent and honor that popular vote through common
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:52.080]  practice. Now, it's a little bit different from state to state. I am for taking over
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:56.360]  the party. I am for making sure real issues are there, for making sure Republicans know
[3:00:56.360 --> 3:01:00.160]  that John McCain is staged. These can take a dive for Hillary and Obama, who are going
[3:01:00.160 --> 3:01:03.800]  to be on the same ticket together. Just watch. That's what they've been saying for years.
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:08.720]  The insiders. So with this scripted deal, I know that most of you guys in the Ron Paul
[3:01:08.720 --> 3:01:13.600]  Revolution who are doing this are trying to foil that, expose that, sabotage that. I
[3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:18.320]  support all that. I'm just saying, there are a lot of people saying, no, he will be president.
[3:01:18.320 --> 3:01:20.960]  We're going to have all the delegates, which of course that's not even happening either,
[3:01:20.960 --> 3:01:24.320]  but you all guys are getting a lot of delegates, which I commend. And we're going to go say
[3:01:24.320 --> 3:01:31.600]  Ron Paul is our nominee. So just explain the delegate process to people. Please, Richard.
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:37.200]  Okay. To start with, to win the nomination, you're supposed to have 1,191 delegates,
[3:01:37.200 --> 3:01:43.000]  which is 50% plus one of the total delegate count. Now, one thing that was a little bit
[3:01:43.000 --> 3:01:46.840]  inaccurate about what you said is it didn't necessarily have to be close race. It could
[3:01:46.840 --> 3:01:51.200]  be, for example, John McCain, maybe he would have ended up with 1,000 delegates. Let's
[3:01:51.200 --> 3:01:56.640]  say Romney got 3,400. Huckabee had theoretically, if he'd had 4,500 and Ron Paul got a hundred
[3:01:56.640 --> 3:02:02.760]  or whatever, that opens it up for a brokered convention. If nobody reached that magic 1,191
[3:02:02.760 --> 3:02:08.680]  number, then it's up for grabs. And those delegates, I didn't say you couldn't have a broker convention.
[3:02:08.680 --> 3:02:13.320]  I said politically, if they're not neck and neck, and even when it's neck and neck, it's
[3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:18.360]  supposed to go historically to whoever has the majority. Well, no, it's those delegates
[3:02:18.360 --> 3:02:23.440]  on the floor make that decision. And whoever gets the most number of delegates, I didn't
[3:02:23.440 --> 3:02:27.400]  say they couldn't make the decision. I'm saying it's political suicide.
[3:02:27.400 --> 3:02:28.400]  Well, perhaps.
[3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:29.760]  Do you have any historical examples?
[3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:31.240]  Well, Abraham Lincoln is an example.
[3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:34.240]  So he had 60 delegates versus somebody with 1,000.
[3:02:34.240 --> 3:02:35.760]  You know, I don't know the exact numbers involved.
[3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:36.960]  No, it was neck and neck, neck and neck.
[3:02:36.960 --> 3:02:41.120]  Okay. Well, that's not my understanding on the Abraham Lincoln. And bottom line is, sooner
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:44.840]  or later, we're going to have a face down with the press anyway. But I wouldn't have
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:48.040]  been too concerned about that. But now let's talk about realistically speaking. I mean,
[3:02:48.040 --> 3:02:51.760]  the opportunities for something to happen, and Ron Paul to become the Republican nominee
[3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:57.480]  right now rely on a health issue with John McCain, a scandal issue with John McCain,
[3:02:57.480 --> 3:03:02.440]  FEC. I know the Democrats filed a lawsuit last week about these FEC issues. We were talking
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:08.280]  about a little while ago, which the last third of the issue with the FEC is he has overspent
[3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:10.200]  in the primaries by several million dollars.
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:11.240]  You're right about that, Richard.
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:16.440]  And so if something happens with the FEC and the Republican delegates, but anyway, the
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:22.320]  fact of the matter is, is there are many, many states, Iowa, Wyoming, Michigan, Nevada,
[3:03:22.320 --> 3:03:28.760]  Maine, Alabama, Alaska, a lot of these states were won by Romney or Huckabee. Those delegates
[3:03:28.760 --> 3:03:34.040]  for the Ron Paul campaign are fair game. And the way we get those delegates is you get,
[3:03:34.040 --> 3:03:39.620]  you start at the very beginning, you go to canvassing your neighborhood, a simple get
[3:03:39.620 --> 3:03:43.960]  out the old fashioned, get out the vote effort on election day. And by the way, we've got
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:47.680]  several elections coming up, which I've got the list of, but on election day, you go to
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:52.600]  your precinct convention and precinct caucuses, you become delegates to your precinct. Then
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:57.320]  from your precinct convention, you go to your regional convention, which could be a county
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:04:02.680]  or senatorial district in Texas. We have senatorial district conventions and county conventions.
[3:04:02.680 --> 3:04:07.000]  You go to your regional conventions and you keep moving up as delegates through the convention
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:12.400]  process here in Texas. We're going to have a minority of Ron Paul supporters going to
[3:04:12.400 --> 3:04:16.640]  the state convention. I think it's probably going to be between 10 and 30%. Ultimately
[3:04:16.640 --> 3:04:22.080]  at St. Paul, we can have a 10 or 30% minority and that won't be enough to push it over to
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:26.960]  do a broker convention thing or whatever, but we can still nonetheless be up there waking
[3:04:26.960 --> 3:04:33.400]  people up, handing out DVDs, et cetera. Wonderful. I am, man, I am fully behind all that. I just
[3:04:33.400 --> 3:04:37.360]  thinking some of the vitriol, not with you, but with some others, me just saying it wasn't
[3:04:37.360 --> 3:04:43.160]  realistic to go take delegates from McCain because of how that would be seen. Just reporting
[3:04:43.160 --> 3:04:49.360]  that out, we're supposed to strategize here. I was evil. It is a big idea, a new world
[3:04:49.360 --> 3:04:56.680]  order in the near future. Earth is dominated by powerful government is known as the builder
[3:04:56.680 --> 3:05:04.160]  bird. Both their objective being world domination or thousands of years, their dark order group.
[3:05:04.160 --> 3:05:09.160]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:05:09.160 --> 3:05:17.640]  80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elites plan for world
[3:05:17.640 --> 3:05:22.600]  government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world

[3:06:07.120 --> 3:06:12.200]  systems, church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love of God and of country
[3:06:12.200 --> 3:06:16.680]  that prompts or constrains us. This will change the character, not civil enforcement. From
[3:06:16.680 --> 3:06:21.160]  history we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome, religious intolerance
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:25.880]  resulted. This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation. America
[3:06:25.880 --> 3:06:30.680]  and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda. Protestant America? Awake before it is too
[3:06:30.680 --> 3:06:35.880]  late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling. Jesus is coming soon. For free materials call

[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:33.080]  even if you try to understand it. But to also clarify that I have the entire time supported
[3:08:33.080 --> 3:08:40.120]  trying to get delegates. I just day one when Ron Paul put out that press release saying,
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:42.880]  well, it's pretty clear we're not going to get the nomination, but I'm going to continue
[3:08:42.880 --> 3:08:47.280]  to fight for our values. Then I talked to state coordinators and people who were being
[3:08:47.280 --> 3:08:53.040]  told by the campaign, hey, you need to, if you're supposed to cast a ballot as a delegate
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:56.960]  for McCain, you need to do that and follow the state rules. And then I would say that
[3:08:56.960 --> 3:09:02.040]  on air and people would email me saying you're a liar. It's not true when it's on record.
[3:09:02.040 --> 3:09:05.080]  So, you know, I think there's a little bit of delusional stuff going on out there and
[3:09:05.080 --> 3:09:08.600]  I just don't want to build up expectations. I want people to realize we've already had
[3:09:08.600 --> 3:09:12.440]  a great victory. Tens of millions of people have woken up to liberty and freedom. They
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:16.480]  found out about real issues. They found out about the Federal Reserve, the North American
[3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:22.080]  Union, the inflation tax. They have discovered Ron Paul, who was a doorway, a gateway into
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:27.320]  this show and hundreds of other prominent radio shows and websites. And it's been wonderful.
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:31.200]  Some people are all bummed out and run off and said, oh, you know, Ron Paul didn't do
[3:09:31.200 --> 3:09:35.480]  it right. He didn't run third party, so I hate him. And I said, no, no, no. You know,
[3:09:35.480 --> 3:09:39.240]  he's doing what he said he'd do. That's, that's fine. Other people are saying, no, he will
[3:09:39.240 --> 3:09:43.480]  be president and they're going to kind of be like the UFO cult when he, when the UFOs
[3:09:43.480 --> 3:09:47.480]  don't land, they're going to freak out. And then you've got people in the middle like
[3:09:47.480 --> 3:09:50.280]  Richard who I agree with. They were saying, no, we need to take over the party, take
[3:09:50.280 --> 3:09:55.960]  over the delegates, do as much as we can to change the platforms to take over the Republican
[3:09:55.960 --> 3:10:00.520]  Party. And that's what's exciting is that all over the place, the Republican Party's
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:04.880]  at city and county level are now Ron Paul strongholds, hundreds and hundreds of them.
[3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:08.320]  And that Richard is where I want to commend you and everybody else. You have just done
[3:10:08.320 --> 3:10:10.880]  a fabulous job and you've worked so hard, Richard.
[3:10:10.880 --> 3:10:15.200]  Well, Alex, I appreciate that, but you know how it feels like you can never do enough.
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:21.240]  The thing of it is, is that we've got to remember is that us waking people up, you've said it
[3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:26.680]  a million times. If you've said it once, waking people up, getting them awake and bringing
[3:10:26.680 --> 3:10:31.120]  them along with what we're trying to do. And that's the big picture behind this whole delegate
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:36.240]  process. But you know, I mean, for example, in Pennsylvania, the Republican Party is supposed
[3:10:36.240 --> 3:10:41.640]  to allocate 74 delegates in Pennsylvania. Well, those are all unallocated delegates.
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:46.920]  So all these Ron Paulers that end up going to Pennsylvania, they could potentially vote
[3:10:46.920 --> 3:10:51.120]  their unallocated Alex, despite the fact, whatever the popular vote is now, I'm not saying break
[3:10:51.120 --> 3:10:56.120]  the rules. There's an important difference. The rule is in Pennsylvania, these are unallocated
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:11:01.200]  delegates. They can vote any which way they want to vote. Now, most states, like Texas,
[3:11:01.200 --> 3:11:05.720]  like I said, it does appear that John McCain has the number of bound delegates that he
[3:11:05.720 --> 3:11:10.080]  needs to get to get the nomination. However, there are some wild card issues out there
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:15.100]  with health. I don't want to dwell on that. But the thing of it is, is that what happens
[3:11:15.100 --> 3:11:19.400]  if the window opportunity opens up and we're not there, which I think at this point, we're
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:22.840]  going to have a 10 to 30% representation in St. Paul.
[3:11:22.840 --> 3:11:26.320]  That's wonderful. And that's going to be a good minority. And you know what? We're going
[3:11:26.320 --> 3:11:31.600]  to be up there handing out DVDs. And probably in advance, we'll probably make our best efforts.
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:35.320]  I know here in Texas, we're going to send DVDs to all these delegates before they go
[3:11:35.320 --> 3:11:40.560]  to St. Paul. So, you know, if we can change hearts and minds, then the thing of it is,
[3:11:40.560 --> 3:11:45.360]  is we've been indoctrinated in so many things and you discussed it all the time. And politics
[3:11:45.360 --> 3:11:49.360]  is a big way that the majority of Americans have been indoctrinated. They go to November,
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:53.560]  the first Tuesday in November, they get the ballot and they vote. It's kind of like when
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:56.500]  you go to a fast food place, you go to the drive-up window and you get your hamburger
[3:11:56.500 --> 3:12:00.800]  fries and a soda, or it's kind of like you go to the Chevy dealer and you buy a car.
[3:12:00.800 --> 3:12:05.360]  You don't think of all the processes, all the different steps that had to occur. For
[3:12:05.360 --> 3:12:08.080]  instance, let's say you go to New Orleans and you see them in Mississippi River, you
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:11.840]  see that water flowing right there through New Orleans. Well, some of that water started
[3:12:11.840 --> 3:12:14.640]  up in Minnesota. And that's the same way we need to...
[3:12:14.640 --> 3:12:15.880]  Some of it started in Canada.
[3:12:15.880 --> 3:12:20.120]  Exactly. So there you go. So that's the way we need to have a look at politics now is
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:21.360]  we need to start thinking...
[3:12:21.360 --> 3:12:26.600]  The process, getting into the guts. And just in just the process of getting into the guts,
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:30.980]  we learn how it works. We learn how corrupt it is. We learn there's these little gatekeepers
[3:12:30.980 --> 3:12:35.600]  and infiltrators that the system has put in place. And we learn that we're as smart as
[3:12:35.600 --> 3:12:40.360]  they are. We're just not dirty scumbags who want to suck blood out of the system. We want
[3:12:40.360 --> 3:12:44.800]  them off our back. And that's why I totally support this process. I just don't want to
[3:12:44.800 --> 3:12:49.800]  see all these infiltrators and saboteurs inside the New World Order if he doesn't get elected
[3:12:49.800 --> 3:12:53.840]  or doesn't get the nomination freaking out and leaving. I wanted to know it's a victory.
[3:12:53.840 --> 3:12:56.960]  That's all I said is that it's a victory what you're doing.
[3:12:56.960 --> 3:13:02.960]  Absolutely. And that's important. It is a process. For instance, I've described it sometimes
[3:13:02.960 --> 3:13:10.080]  in military terms, sometimes described in baseball terms. We're right now in the political
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:17.160]  scheme of things. We're like a real good 5A high school football team or 5A baseball team.
[3:13:17.160 --> 3:13:21.800]  We've been through Pee Wee back in early 2000s. I think we were in Pee Wee League. Then we
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:25.880]  moved up to Pony League, Little League, etc. And then we got into junior high high school.
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:31.760]  And we're like a really good high school baseball team in politics. And we proved that. We got
[3:13:31.760 --> 3:13:36.000]  sidetracked at the New Hampshire boat. I'd say we're a good college team. And then the
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:40.920]  next level is going to the majors. And then after that, we're moving on to professional
[3:13:40.920 --> 3:13:44.760]  and then and then went in the pennant. Well, that's just it. See, in 2010, personally,
[3:13:44.760 --> 3:13:50.680]  I think we will be a college team in 2010. If we can keep everybody fired up and working,
[3:13:50.680 --> 3:13:55.760]  get out there in your precinct level right now. For instance, we've still got Guam. Let's
[3:13:55.760 --> 3:14:01.160]  see. No, I'm sorry. Indiana, North Carolina, Hawaii, Kentucky, Oregon, Idaho, New Mexico,
[3:14:01.160 --> 3:14:06.040]  South Dakota, and Nebraska. All these states are yet to vote. Folks, if you're in these
[3:14:06.040 --> 3:14:12.240]  states, get out there and drive by Canvas, your precinct, go to your precinct, your county,
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:18.120]  tax assessor office or whoever runs elections there, get your precinct map, drive by Canvas,
[3:14:18.120 --> 3:14:23.320]  your precinct, look for bumper stickers, yard signs, etc. and contact these people and get
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:28.680]  you a little cadre of folks in your precinct and then go divvy up that precinct, go door
[3:14:28.680 --> 3:14:34.200]  to door, make the phone calls, turn up these people, go fashion, get out, vote, efforts,
[3:14:34.200 --> 3:14:38.640]  and then get your precinct conventions and caucuses. And we can send a lot of delegates
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:44.320]  out of these upcoming states that have yet to vote because the mainstream media is declaring
[3:14:44.320 --> 3:14:49.160]  McCain the victor. So as a matter of fact, you know, some of these Republican talk show
[3:14:49.160 --> 3:14:53.280]  hosts like Cunningham, Bill Cunningham and Limbaugh and Hannity and others, they're
[3:14:53.280 --> 3:14:57.200]  suggesting for Republicans to go vote for Hillary. So we should be able to dominate
[3:14:57.200 --> 3:15:03.440]  in these states with delegates. It's really disgusting shifting gears. As I predicted,
[3:15:03.440 --> 3:15:07.320]  people thought I was nuts when I did it, but I knew that they were behind Hillary and Obama
[3:15:07.320 --> 3:15:15.120]  that to now hear Limbaugh endorsing Hillary Clinton. People couldn't believe that I was
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:21.160]  right about that, but it's staged. McCain, Obama, Hillary, they're all together. Obama's
[3:15:21.160 --> 3:15:25.160]  friends with Hillary, that's all staged and emitted. McCain vacations with the Clintons
[3:15:25.160 --> 3:15:31.920]  just like the Bush's, his wife has campaigned for. I mean, this is as phony as a $3 bill.
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:38.280]  They're just, oh, what's the term I've heard people use, you know, the chief news reader.
[3:15:38.280 --> 3:15:43.040]  I mean, that's really all they are. Well, in the Pied Piper for the Republican Party,
[3:15:43.040 --> 3:15:46.920]  the good opportunity that opens up for us is the Ron Paulers and all these different states
[3:15:46.920 --> 3:15:51.000]  can get involved in the nuts and bolts and the machinery, the Republican Party. A lot
[3:15:51.000 --> 3:15:54.800]  of them, since they go vote Democrat, they're not going to be eligible to go to their conventions.
[3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:59.280]  They're not going to be eligible to caucus, et cetera. So that opens up for Ron Paul people
[3:15:59.280 --> 3:16:03.960]  to get more active in that and ultimately have more influence in their communities.
[3:16:03.960 --> 3:16:09.200]  I would encourage everybody that possibly can to run for precinct committee chairman,
[3:16:09.200 --> 3:16:13.640]  run for chairman of your precinct. It's a small office, but it's like politics at the
[3:16:13.640 --> 3:16:19.760]  atomic level. It's where it all starts. That stream of creating these candidates, cultivating
[3:16:19.760 --> 3:16:23.200]  candidates. I mean, where are the bad candidates coming out of right now? They're coming out
[3:16:23.200 --> 3:16:27.080]  of both the Democrat and Republican parties. Ultimately, we're going to be involved in
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:30.920]  the Democrat Party as well to, if we're ever going to have a real chance of getting back
[3:16:30.920 --> 3:16:34.280]  our government, we're going to have to do that. But right now the focus is on the Republican
[3:16:34.280 --> 3:16:39.520]  Party because it is so weak and because the Ron Paul campaign has spearheaded it. But
[3:16:39.520 --> 3:16:43.920]  we're going to be able to soon in 2010, I think we're going to have, because of the
[3:16:43.920 --> 3:16:47.760]  work that's gone on right now, is we're going to have ultimately thousands of candidates
[3:16:47.760 --> 3:16:53.400]  running in 2010 for local offices from dog catcher to city council, to mayor. I mean,
[3:16:53.400 --> 3:16:57.840]  you were talking about running for mayor just the other day, to county commissioners, state
[3:16:57.840 --> 3:17:03.480]  reps, state senators, et cetera. We need good candidates. Let's like I say, let's get, like
[3:17:03.480 --> 3:17:07.160]  I was talking about the example with the Mississippi River, New Orleans, let's get to the headwaters
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:08.160]  of the political process.
[3:17:08.160 --> 3:17:12.480]  And we only win by engaging in the process, even though it's rigged and has scams and
[3:17:12.480 --> 3:17:16.840]  fraud. You don't give up because of that. You get deeper into the guts to ferret it
[3:17:16.840 --> 3:17:21.280]  out. I mean, I go back to just five, six years ago, you'd see polls are 20, 25%, depending
[3:17:21.280 --> 3:17:25.680]  on the poll, thought that the election system was fraudulent and diaboled was a scam. Now
[3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:30.960]  I've seen polls as high as 86% major national polls. And so now those companies are getting
[3:17:30.960 --> 3:17:36.240]  sued. They're getting removed. They're getting, people think it's an oxymoron on air when
[3:17:36.240 --> 3:17:41.080]  I say there's a lot of thieving and scamming and fraud going on, kind of like he got second
[3:17:41.080 --> 3:17:45.600]  place in Nevada and they said he got third place or kind of like he got first place in
[3:17:45.600 --> 3:17:50.440]  Louisiana and they said he got third place, you know, or second place. They lie. They
[3:17:50.440 --> 3:17:53.560]  have been caught in fraud. People say, well, you're saying there's fraud. Then why do you
[3:17:53.560 --> 3:17:57.920]  say vote? Because you have to stay involved just because they're cheating. You keep going
[3:17:57.920 --> 3:18:01.840]  to the tables showing how it's a rig deck, showing, because if you just give up and walk
[3:18:01.840 --> 3:18:05.800]  away, they win, you know, you take your marbles and leave, they win. You got to stay in the
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:11.600]  game, even if it's rigged to keep showing everybody how it's a fraud. And so I see people
[3:18:11.600 --> 3:18:15.840]  doing that now. Now, I'm not criticizing Ron Paul, but this isn't a cult. So I'm going
[3:18:15.840 --> 3:18:21.320]  to say my ideas for this. Some say you shouldn't even question Ron Paul. When I had him on
[3:18:21.320 --> 3:18:24.720]  air about a month ago, and I'm getting him on soon again, I politely said during the
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:29.680]  break and on air, I said, you need to come out with a plan against socialized health
[3:18:29.680 --> 3:18:35.040]  care, you come out with a plan against the war, a pullout plan, write a one pager, simple
[3:18:35.040 --> 3:18:40.320]  plan for you need to come out against the open borders. And he's like, well, I've done
[3:18:40.320 --> 3:18:44.000]  all that. And I go, no, have like a battle plan. People will do it their own creative
[3:18:44.000 --> 3:18:48.840]  way on your website, ask people to form into core groups, and then to even get directives
[3:18:48.840 --> 3:18:54.680]  from the campaign, you know, to continue this as a defense for the Republic to take those
[3:18:54.680 --> 3:18:59.920]  2030, you can debate even more Ron Paul supporters, say, Hey, the fight isn't over. Now we're
[3:18:59.920 --> 3:19:05.320]  going into this mode. Instead of shifting into a promote and a book and, and kind of
[3:19:05.320 --> 3:19:09.400]  taking some time off. I know he was tired and 73 years old. And instead of giving the
[3:19:09.400 --> 3:19:14.120]  main movement a ball to carry, it became this delegate thing. And I'd say, and I've looked
[3:19:14.120 --> 3:19:19.280]  at the numbers, I'd say there's 20% of the revolution left that from what it was at
[3:19:19.280 --> 3:19:24.640]  its peak, when I think we could have kept 90% and then expanded that this was a once
[3:19:24.640 --> 3:19:28.800]  in a lifetime. I'm not saying we've lost it. We can still codify a plan and go out and
[3:19:28.800 --> 3:19:33.400]  get these people. And so Richard, when we come back, I want to discuss that with you
[3:19:33.400 --> 3:19:38.520]  on the other side for prison planet TV viewers that are watching us on television right now.
[3:19:38.520 --> 3:19:41.440]  We're going to continue during this four minute break and we'll be right back for all the
[3:19:41.440 --> 3:19:46.080]  radio listeners. After that, on the other side, you go to my streams. What's the matter?
[3:19:46.080 --> 3:19:54.080]  It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by powerful
[3:19:54.080 --> 3:20:00.760]  government. It's known as the builder bird. But their objective being world domination
[3:20:00.760 --> 3:20:06.280]  for thousands of years, their dark order group. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[3:20:06.280 --> 3:20:14.840]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first
[3:20:14.840 --> 3:20:20.280]  time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn
[3:20:20.280 --> 3:20:24.680]  the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda. The old America is making great
[3:20:24.680 --> 3:20:28.320]  progress for the world. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have
[3:20:28.320 --> 3:20:32.440]  all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after these years. Order in game
[3:20:32.440 --> 3:20:39.440]  on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:20:39.440 --> 3:20:45.120]  In game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:50.600]  This is Steve Shank, J. Michael Stevens Group. Let's get real. Flower is already being rationed.
[3:20:50.600 --> 3:20:55.560]  Prices on food are getting so high, warehouses are installing security systems and guards.
[3:20:55.560 --> 3:21:01.320]  You can expect soon to see criminal activity in food. We're all in a foot race as to whether
[3:21:01.320 --> 3:21:06.280]  the food will become so expensive we can't afford it or there will be no food at any
[3:21:06.280 --> 3:21:11.600]  price. We can't grow enough of our own food even with genetically altered trash. It will
[3:21:11.600 --> 3:21:16.640]  give you the opportunity to eat perfectly engineered food. They think God didn't get
[3:21:16.640 --> 3:21:21.440]  it right, so Monsanto had to step in. If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a
[3:21:21.440 --> 3:21:30.440]  supply of food, it's okay. We won't tell. Call 800-409-5633 on the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[3:21:30.440 --> 3:21:38.040]  That's 800-409-5633. It may be a little bit crazy. That's okay. Because there is no such
[3:21:38.040 --> 3:21:45.280]  thing as a little bit dead.
[3:21:45.280 --> 3:21:49.760]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[3:21:49.760 --> 3:21:56.000]  the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely

[3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:15.440]  Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose. From hijackers being trained at US military bases
[3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:21.160]  to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[3:22:46.320 --> 3:22:50.080]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:55.040]  disease such as cancer or diabetes? Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[3:22:55.040 --> 3:22:59.220]  what we drink, the environment and our high stress lifestyles. It's these choices that
[3:22:59.220 --> 3:23:04.000]  cause decreased energy, weight gain and eventually disease. The easiest way to reduce disease
[3:23:04.000 --> 3:23:09.200]  causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water. At SnyderHealth.com we offer
[3:23:09.200 --> 3:23:13.920]  a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization
[3:23:13.920 --> 3:23:20.040]  technology for over 25 years. Instantly transform ordinary tap water into clean, living and

[3:23:41.600 --> 3:24:01.800]  SnyderHealth.com. Richard in the five minutes we've got left and I want to have you back
[3:24:01.800 --> 3:24:07.000]  in as this develops in the next month or so. Give people some of the dates, what they need
[3:24:07.000 --> 3:24:11.600]  to do around the country, people in Austin, how they can help you and others. You guys
[3:24:11.600 --> 3:24:15.400]  are taking over the party, you're injecting real issues, you're getting ready to run
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:19.920]  in the next election in two years, thousands of people nationwide, your leadership, other
[3:24:19.920 --> 3:24:26.400]  leadership, fabulous idea. I am totally behind it in my own meager capacity and again I don't
[3:24:26.400 --> 3:24:30.440]  want people to think it's a loss if Ron Paul doesn't get the nomination. That wasn't even
[3:24:30.440 --> 3:24:34.760]  the goal by the serious minds. The goal is to take over the party.
[3:24:34.760 --> 3:24:37.760]  That's right and ultimately we'll be doing the same thing in the Democrat Party and Travis
[3:24:37.760 --> 3:24:44.000]  County we're already on our way. What the folks here can do in Texas is Charlotte Brown,
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:49.960]  the guest host with George Butler on a GCN live program, is heading up the effort to
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:54.720]  get DVDs out to all the state delegates and the alternate delegates and her website to
[3:24:54.720 --> 3:25:02.360]  contact her is OperationWakeUp.com. OperationWakeUp.com and on the top right hand side of that homepage
[3:25:02.360 --> 3:25:06.920]  is her email. So folks, if you can volunteer or donate to that effort to get these DVDs
[3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:09.840]  out, which by the way I'm very anxious, I'm going to buy that DVD if you've got it in
[3:25:09.840 --> 3:25:15.200]  stock today that Washington, you're fired. I'm going to get that because it sounds like
[3:25:15.200 --> 3:25:21.520]  it's right up our alley of what we're trying to do and let me talk a little bit about the
[3:25:21.520 --> 3:25:25.800]  third party. That has been a big topic of conversation and I want to go back to the
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:33.320]  06 to give real life examples of problems that third party runs give us. We had to abstain
[3:25:33.320 --> 3:25:39.280]  from the primaries. In 06, members of your audience, including myself, we worked in the
[3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:44.480]  Republican Party up against Mike Krusey in the primary. We worked in the Travis County
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:50.160]  in the Democrat Party against Karen Sonleitner and then at the same time, most of us couldn't
[3:25:50.160 --> 3:25:56.040]  vote if we wanted to sign a petition for either Kinky Friedman or Strayhorn. So that kind
[3:25:56.040 --> 3:25:57.040]  of divided us up.
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:26:01.080]  Got lots of Byzantine rules, but for listeners with a national, international audience right
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:05.520]  now, they need to all get with their local Ron Paul meetup groups and other organizations.
[3:26:05.520 --> 3:26:10.400]  The fight is still going. We can't give up. Look at how much ground we've gained. Don't
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:14.200]  expect to win the Super Bowl, kind of like you said earlier in your first time out on
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:19.080]  the field. This is very, very exciting what's happening and what are the delegate numbers
[3:26:19.080 --> 3:26:22.680]  right now? How many? I mean, just I know it's hard to know state statement. I know there's
[3:26:22.680 --> 3:26:27.640]  a lot of news articles saying Ron Paul folks are capturing counties, capturing cities,
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:30.200]  capturing districts. We know this is happening.
[3:26:30.200 --> 3:26:34.120]  Well, the delegate numbers are according to the news. It's probably when McCain has probably
[3:26:34.120 --> 3:26:40.240]  around 1300 out of that 1300, 1400 some odd. I think he's probably got bound delegates.
[3:26:40.240 --> 3:26:44.840]  Probably 1100 or 1200 bound delegates. He's going to get more bound delegates in these
[3:26:44.840 --> 3:26:49.320]  upcoming elections, but we've got what we've got to remember are the unallocated and unbound
[3:26:49.320 --> 3:26:54.120]  delegates. It would be beautiful. Okay. How many, how many does Ron Paul have now?
[3:26:54.120 --> 3:26:58.640]  Officially, I'd say it's a low number. I would say it's probably less than a hundred,
[3:26:58.640 --> 3:27:01.520]  but what can happen at the convention? We don't, but, but I mean, at the state level,
[3:27:01.520 --> 3:27:04.880]  we know Ron Paul, people are capturing a lot of them. So those chips won't come out on
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:08.880]  the table till later. That's right. It's a process to see where it ends up. For instance,
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:14.560]  we had a central district 25. We had a majority of Ron Paulers in central district 25. I think
[3:27:14.560 --> 3:27:19.280]  they're sending 80 or 90% of their delegation are Ron Paulers, both the delegate and the
[3:27:19.280 --> 3:27:23.680]  alternate slate. They sent a huge majority and there may be other, it's very hard to
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:26.920]  find that news. You've really got to scour, but we're going to find out and give folks
[3:27:26.920 --> 3:27:29.000]  the data, the convention when we're going to learn all this.
[3:27:29.000 --> 3:27:32.760]  Okay. Here in Texas, like I said, we need people to go to operation, wake up.com and
[3:27:32.760 --> 3:27:39.440]  get on board with the DVD project. The convention dates for Texas are June 12th, 13th and 14th.
[3:27:39.440 --> 3:27:43.280]  That's a Thursday, Friday and Saturday. That's going to be in Houston, Texas at one of the
[3:27:43.280 --> 3:27:48.760]  good Illuminati people, George R. Brown convention center part of, but then coming up in Minnesota
[3:27:48.760 --> 3:27:52.200]  later this year, there's going to be the national convention. That's right. The national campaign
[3:27:52.200 --> 3:27:58.480]  or national convention in St. Paul is starting on September 1st. And I believe that's a Monday.
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:01.960]  So it'll be up there. That'll be an exciting event to see if we can get as many Ron Paulers
[3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:05.600]  as possible. And we're about four months away from that now. That's right. That's right.
[3:28:05.600 --> 3:28:09.760]  And so that's coming up. And earlier I made the example of some local politics going on
[3:28:09.760 --> 3:28:14.960]  here. And the reason I make that though is to emphasize why a third party run makes it
[3:28:14.960 --> 3:28:22.400]  kind of difficult because the Achilles heel of us taking out a lot of incumbents is in
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:28.840]  the primaries. It's very important that we be able to participate in the Republican primaries.
[3:28:28.840 --> 3:28:33.600]  And if, you know, when we've got the constitutionalists on the left and the Democrat party, we need
[3:28:33.600 --> 3:28:37.640]  them to be able to participate in these primary parties because that's where the headwaters
[3:28:37.640 --> 3:28:42.040]  to these bad politicians is. No, I understand. But if the big battle is about who the executive
[3:28:42.040 --> 3:28:45.600]  is going to be, who the president is going to be, it's a rigged game with these three
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:52.600]  stage candidates, these puppets. There's no doubt. A marionette. And so the whole point
[3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:56.520]  is Ron Paul had something historical going. Massive momentum built up. I understand the
[3:28:56.520 --> 3:29:01.600]  anger of people who wanted him to run third party. And I think it was one of the few times
[3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:05.720]  in history that there could have been a chance for something to happen. At least in the Info
[3:29:05.720 --> 3:29:09.680]  War, it would have expanded and continue the debate and the discussion. But I think this
[3:29:09.680 --> 3:29:14.360]  alternate plan is just as good. Either way, we fight, we get involved in the Info War,
[3:29:14.360 --> 3:29:18.040]  we win. Richard Reeve, I'm going to come back and do a big news blitz, but I want to thank

[3:34:32.120 --> 3:34:36.120]  I'm where the night is going.
[3:34:36.120 --> 3:34:40.120]  I will move on.
[3:34:40.120 --> 3:34:48.120]  I'll try to find a way to face another day.
[3:34:48.120 --> 3:34:51.120]  All right.
[3:34:51.120 --> 3:35:06.120]  I'm going to do a news blitz here for you.
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:17.120]  And I'm also encouraging all of the listeners out there.
[3:35:17.120 --> 3:35:22.120]  Because I get so busy on air, I never even plug what makes all of this possible.
[3:35:22.120 --> 3:35:26.120]  And what is the best tool I've found to wake people up out there.
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:33.120]  Sometimes I've been told how dare I mention that videos are the most effective tool.
[3:35:33.120 --> 3:35:35.120]  But they really are.
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:38.120]  And I hope that everybody will go to infowars.com.
[3:35:38.120 --> 3:35:39.120]  We'll order on DVD.
[3:35:39.120 --> 3:35:42.120]  Washington, you are fired.
[3:35:42.120 --> 3:35:45.120]  And American Drug War, the last wide hope.
[3:35:45.120 --> 3:35:48.120]  This has three hours of extras on it.
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:53.120]  All available at infowars.com.
[3:35:53.120 --> 3:35:55.120]  Washington, you're fired.
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:36:00.120]  And American Drug War, we also have Ron Paul's new book that's out.
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:03.120]  The Manifesto for Freedom.
[3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:08.120]  And just a lot more there available right now at infowars.com.
[3:36:08.120 --> 3:36:14.120]  Or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[3:36:14.120 --> 3:36:19.120]  Man, it is weird not doing commercial sometimes on my own internet feed.
[3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:24.120]  And for the prisonpana.tv viewers, because then you come out of break and there was no break.
[3:36:24.120 --> 3:36:26.120]  And you're used to having those breaks as a breather.
[3:36:26.120 --> 3:36:32.120]  I can't go around shouting orders during the break.
[3:36:32.120 --> 3:36:36.120]  I can look out my window and see Burmese working hard right out there.
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:38.120]  Everybody, you want to see Burmese?
[3:36:38.120 --> 3:36:40.120]  Everybody want to see Burmese out the window?
[3:36:40.120 --> 3:36:43.120]  Here, let me show prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[3:36:43.120 --> 3:36:45.120]  Get up out of my seat here.
[3:36:45.120 --> 3:36:48.120]  And we will uh-huh.
[3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:51.120]  There he is, right out there.
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:53.120]  Ha ha ha ha.
[3:36:53.120 --> 3:36:56.120]  Oh man.
[3:36:56.120 --> 3:37:00.120]  How's it going Burmese?
[3:37:00.120 --> 3:37:02.120]  Ha ha ha.
[3:37:02.120 --> 3:37:05.120]  I ought to get a wireless camera and walk around the office with it.
[3:37:05.120 --> 3:37:08.120]  I can do the show out front on a headset.
[3:37:08.120 --> 3:37:16.120]  Paul was joking I could go to the beach with my family and hear the show with a headset over the skype system over the access unit.
[3:37:16.120 --> 3:37:20.120]  There he is out there working.
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:22.120]  And who is that?
[3:37:22.120 --> 3:37:24.120]  Over there on the wall.
[3:37:24.120 --> 3:37:27.120]  I know I've walked away from my microphone ladies and gentlemen.
[3:37:27.120 --> 3:37:32.120]  I'll be back over there just in a moment.
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:34.120]  Here's our studio in here.
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:36.120]  If you want to get a look at it.
[3:37:36.120 --> 3:37:41.120]  I've got a little camera on me and got the document camera right there.
[3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:46.120]  I've got another camera, another screen in here and I control things from right here.
[3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:50.120]  We also got some folks out there that do some of the work.
[3:37:50.120 --> 3:38:02.120]  And uh, well basically this is my, this is my little broadcast pod in here.
[3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:05.120]  Go ahead and set this camera back up here.
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:08.120]  This is truly insane radio.
[3:38:08.120 --> 3:38:10.120]  Brought to you by the meathead.
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:12.120]  All right, hold on a minute.
[3:38:12.120 --> 3:38:15.120]  Ah, get my camera back up there.
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:17.120]  Okay, oh man.
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:21.120]  Some days doing this fourth hour I get really tired.
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:26.120]  Especially if I want to go through a big news blitz of information.
[3:38:26.120 --> 3:38:30.120]  But here we go.
[3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:39.120]  Team minus 22 minutes left in this transmission against charity.
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:41.120]  Food shortages are a globalist population agenda.
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:44.120]  I mentioned this last few days, but I really should read this whole article,
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:46.120]  but there's just not time.
[3:38:46.120 --> 3:38:51.120]  I think everybody should really as soon as possible go read that story.
[3:38:51.120 --> 3:38:57.120]  By the way, is the Schwarzenegger video officially up yet?
[3:38:57.120 --> 3:39:02.120]  I saw that test version, good thing we played it then and whoever pulled that down.
[3:39:02.120 --> 3:39:09.120]  And uh, I wonder if Burma's was involved in that.
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:16.120]  And then we've got, oh man, teasing people is one of my few pleasures.
[3:39:16.120 --> 3:39:18.120]  This is something that's really, really serious.
[3:39:18.120 --> 3:39:21.120]  Oh, I said I'd take phone calls.
[3:39:21.120 --> 3:39:23.120]  And then we got phone calls on the main network phone system
[3:39:23.120 --> 3:39:28.120]  and we got phone callers here in the call in number.
[3:39:28.120 --> 3:39:31.120]  But we will take a few calls.
[3:39:31.120 --> 3:39:41.120]  I'm going to go do two intensive news blitz today at 512-646-5400.
[3:39:41.120 --> 3:39:46.120]  Coming soon, a medical research lab is planned for the heart of London.
[3:39:46.120 --> 3:39:54.120]  Is it safe to house a facility dealing with deadly diseases in a large urban population?
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:39:57.120]  Natasha Gilbert reports.
[3:39:57.120 --> 3:40:02.120]  And here is the London Guardian story there.
[3:40:02.120 --> 3:40:04.120]  It's called Coming Soon.
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:07.120]  Came out yesterday.
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:14.120]  Now this is an important article because under BioShield program,
[3:40:14.120 --> 3:40:24.120]  36 level 4 bio weapons laboratories were built from 2001 to 2006.
[3:40:24.120 --> 3:40:26.120]  Last time I looked it up.
[3:40:26.120 --> 3:40:31.120]  And they put level 4 bio weapons labs in new level 2 and level 3
[3:40:31.120 --> 3:40:36.120]  and aging level 2 and 3 facilities all over major cities,
[3:40:36.120 --> 3:40:46.120]  Chicago, Baltimore, Maryland, Galveston, Texas, Los Angeles.
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:52.120]  And they admitted in the press that these are laboratories with very specific bio weapons.
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:40:55.120]  And this is the super stuff.
[3:40:55.120 --> 3:40:57.120]  I mean, anthrax is a level 3.
[3:40:57.120 --> 3:40:58.120]  We're talking a level 4.
[3:40:58.120 --> 3:41:05.120]  We're talking about mammal pox that killed 99.9% of whatever it comes in contact to.
[3:41:05.120 --> 3:41:08.120]  Total death, total destruction.
[3:41:08.120 --> 3:41:11.120]  Meanwhile, the cops are running around freaking out, running checkpoints,
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:18.120]  harassing bedraggled families that work 20 hours a day, you know,
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:20.120]  on their Prozac, driving home from work.
[3:41:20.120 --> 3:41:23.120]  You know, police running around hiding under their chairs from Al Qaeda.
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:25.120]  Ben Lawton's going to get us any minute.
[3:41:25.120 --> 3:41:30.120]  Oh, he put out a new video report agreeing with Bush on something uploaded by a known Neocon CIA website.
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:32.120]  But everything's okay.
[3:41:32.120 --> 3:41:35.120]  Meanwhile, we got genetic engineering completely out of control.
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:37.120]  Bio weapons labs everywhere.
[3:41:37.120 --> 3:41:41.120]  Fish infusion systems, giant nuclear reactors being built.
[3:41:41.120 --> 3:41:49.120]  I mean, you tell the local Austinites they've got very high powered research.
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:53.120]  New Karen Austin reactor, and they'll tell you it doesn't exist.
[3:41:53.120 --> 3:41:55.120]  The JJ Pickle Center.
[3:41:55.120 --> 3:41:57.120]  You can Google it in five seconds and find it, but you won't.
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:41:59.120]  You're pre-programmed to Coward.
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:02.120]  It's all right, don't matter.
[3:42:02.120 --> 3:42:04.120]  Run around, police, run checkpoints, looking for elk tout everywhere.
[3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:09.120]  Meanwhile, your boss is writing public documents saying you want to use race-specific bio weapons to release on the public.
[3:42:09.120 --> 3:42:11.120]  Dick Cheney wrote that and everything's fine.
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:13.120]  That's why I'm living in the twilight zone, man.
[3:42:13.120 --> 3:42:20.120]  We got the sons of Nazis that send people to their death, actual SS officers running around under the control of the ADL.
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:24.120]  Uh, wearing SS belt buckles on TV.
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:26.120]  I just can't handle it anymore, man.
[3:42:26.120 --> 3:42:30.120]  I just, I'm living in the frickin' twilight zone here.
[3:42:30.120 --> 3:42:33.120]  I mean, I really am.
[3:42:33.120 --> 3:42:36.120]  Let me read this article to you.
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:40.120]  A medical research lab is planning for the heart of London.
[3:42:40.120 --> 3:42:42.120]  It's planning for the heart of London.
[3:42:42.120 --> 3:42:47.120]  Is it safe to house a facility dealing with deadly diseases in a large urban population?
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:49.120]  Natasha Gilbert reports, let me see.
[3:42:49.120 --> 3:42:56.120]  The last two foot and mouth releases were admitted by the government and accidentally released during bio weapon drills at Porton Down.
[3:42:56.120 --> 3:43:00.120]  Then it came out they released it on purpose.
[3:43:00.120 --> 3:43:03.120]  The government is run by psycho killers, you understand?
[3:43:03.120 --> 3:43:07.120]  They're bored, they're tired of mistresses and jets and money and power.
[3:43:07.120 --> 3:43:08.120]  They like killing you.
[3:43:08.120 --> 3:43:09.120]  They like killing me.
[3:43:09.120 --> 3:43:11.120]  They like poisoning your water.
[3:43:11.120 --> 3:43:12.120]  They like playing God.
[3:43:12.120 --> 3:43:16.120]  They like running at all.
[3:43:16.120 --> 3:43:21.120]  Oh, God.
[3:43:21.120 --> 3:43:31.120]  A 500 million pound, that's over a billion dollar medical in US money, research laboratory in the heart of London could carry out work on the world's most deadly diseases.
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:49.120]  Guardian education is learned backed by the Prime Minister, the land to be built yards from St. Eurostar terminal in the British Library will replace the National Institute of Medical Research in Mill Hill, which includes one of the UK's 10 category four labs.
[3:43:49.120 --> 3:43:53.120]  Now, again, weaponized anthrax is level three.
[3:43:53.120 --> 3:44:08.120]  Level four is supposed to be underground in pressurized like a submarine sealed with automatic burners ready to burn it up underground surrounded by three fences with minefields and machine gun nest huge armored doors to enter.
[3:44:08.120 --> 3:44:14.120]  And they're robotically controlled in the lab so humans don't even get into the pressurized area.
[3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:18.120]  Now, instead, they're sticking level four and level two and three facilities that get hit by hurricanes.
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:19.120]  It's all over.
[3:44:19.120 --> 3:44:33.120]  They're going to climb. Remember four years ago when they mailed super weaponized flu that kills the vast majority of those that come in contact with it was like 5000 different labs were accidentally shipped it by the Centers for Disease Control.
[3:44:33.120 --> 3:44:37.120]  They accidentally shipped the super deadly flu.
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:39.120]  The government loves you.
[3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:40.120]  Give them all your rights.
[3:44:40.120 --> 3:44:42.120]  I'll kind of will get you.
[3:44:42.120 --> 3:44:43.120]  What's up?
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:52.120]  Make an eye contact.
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:58.120]  These have included security levels and work on highly contagious and incurable diseases such as Ebola.
[3:44:58.120 --> 3:44:59.120]  Lass of fever.
[3:44:59.120 --> 3:45:05.120]  The government also has around three in the 50 category three labs where work on SARS and HIV takes place.
[3:45:05.120 --> 3:45:08.120]  Yes, where they're building new ones for you and your family.
[3:45:08.120 --> 3:45:13.120]  Look, I know you're not going to listen to chops and I know the evil's probably going to end up winning a few more rounds.
[3:45:13.120 --> 3:45:18.120]  And I'm not saying this for effect when your children are dying and you're dying of the bio weapon attack.
[3:45:18.120 --> 3:45:19.120]  It isn't Alcada.
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:23.120]  Okay.
[3:45:23.120 --> 3:45:25.120]  It isn't the Alcada you think it is.
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:27.120]  Look, man, I want to go surfing.
[3:45:27.120 --> 3:45:28.120]  I want to go to Hawaii.
[3:45:28.120 --> 3:45:30.120]  I want to go see Crater Lake.
[3:45:30.120 --> 3:45:35.120]  I want to go camping in in in.
[3:45:35.120 --> 3:45:38.120]  I don't want to be here.
[3:45:38.120 --> 3:45:39.120]  Okay.
[3:45:39.120 --> 3:45:41.120]  I do not want to have to talk to you.
[3:45:41.120 --> 3:45:45.120]  I do not like the fact that you take it as me begging than I warn you and you get on a petty power trip.
[3:45:45.120 --> 3:45:53.120]  I don't like the fact that psychopathic Nazis hooked up with a bunch of nuts in Israel and other places run everything that were completely screwed.
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:45:54.120]  Okay.
[3:45:54.120 --> 3:45:57.120]  I'm telling you the truth here.
[3:45:57.120 --> 3:45:58.120]  You've just got to die.
[3:45:58.120 --> 3:45:59.120]  Don't you?
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:01.120]  They've got to kill you first before you wake up as you're dying.
[3:46:01.120 --> 3:46:03.120]  You'll probably think about that.
[3:46:03.120 --> 3:46:08.120]  I take no pleasure in that.
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:12.120]  It's all over.
[3:46:12.120 --> 3:46:16.120]  Oh, geez.
[3:46:16.120 --> 3:46:17.120]  Now, listen to the crap.
[3:46:17.120 --> 3:46:18.120]  It's the same way they sold bio shell.
[3:46:18.120 --> 3:46:21.120]  They say it's done to protect from terrorism.
[3:46:21.120 --> 3:46:31.120]  They have to have all these weapons to protect you because they study the weapons and produce thousands of gallons a piece of them as the Baltimore Sun reported three years ago.
[3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:34.120]  Thousands of gallons of liquid death was the term they used.
[3:46:34.120 --> 3:46:44.120]  The potential threat of terrorism, as well as the ongoing investigation in the biosafety branches of the peer bright laboratory in Surrey, which caused last year's outbreak of foot and mouth disease.
[3:46:44.120 --> 3:46:57.120]  Another one they did means a discussion to build a category four lab in King's Cross area by 2013 that caused a potential storm as London gears up to host the Olympics.
[3:46:57.120 --> 3:47:12.120]  Folks, the government of Australia six years ago released the full genetic code diagram to make a mammal pox for any mammal that kills close to 100%.
[3:47:12.120 --> 3:47:14.120]  They're not worried about that.
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:16.120]  They're worried about carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[3:47:16.120 --> 3:47:19.120]  That's the deadly weapon that must be stopped.
[3:47:19.120 --> 3:47:29.120]  The deadly booga booga that we all have to fear and that films are shown to all your kids in public school about the earth is going to die from the deadly carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:37.120]  It's making us the enemy in the words of the chairman of the CFR so the state can quote wage war against the enemy human kind.
[3:47:37.120 --> 3:47:39.120]  But the elite will do that waging war.
[3:47:39.120 --> 3:47:41.120]  Do you get it cops?
[3:47:41.120 --> 3:47:43.120]  You're not the most powerful people.
[3:47:43.120 --> 3:47:45.120]  You're nothing to them.
[3:47:45.120 --> 3:47:47.120]  You think you're part of the power structure.
[3:47:47.120 --> 3:47:48.120]  Do you hear me FBI?
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:50.120]  Do you hear me BATF?
[3:47:50.120 --> 3:48:03.120]  You understand they've killed hundreds of microbiologists who were in government weapons programs in the US, England, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, on and on and on, Italy.
[3:48:03.120 --> 3:48:04.120]  It's over 300.
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:05.120]  They murder them.
[3:48:05.120 --> 3:48:06.120]  They double tap them.
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:07.120]  They run over them.
[3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:08.120]  They kill them.
[3:48:08.120 --> 3:48:16.120]  They're all in key bio weapons programs or identifying key bio weapons programs because they don't want these universities finding out who's going to release this stuff.
[3:48:16.120 --> 3:48:18.120]  That's why they don't care about me warning you.
[3:48:18.120 --> 3:48:22.120]  They don't care about me on the air because they're going to kill you and your family.
[3:48:22.120 --> 3:48:23.120]  Do you understand me?
[3:48:23.120 --> 3:48:24.120]  Do you think 9-Eleven's anything?
[3:48:24.120 --> 3:48:27.120]  That was just to set the table and get you ready for their eugenics.
[3:48:27.120 --> 3:48:32.120]  You think I make movies where I say they plan to kill 80% of you to get your attention?
[3:48:32.120 --> 3:48:35.120]  You think you think I like attention of murdering killers?
[3:48:35.120 --> 3:48:37.120]  You think I just make this stuff up?
[3:48:37.120 --> 3:48:38.120]  I'm not making any of it.
[3:48:38.120 --> 3:48:41.120]  Find out that the damn CFR, excuse me.
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:45.120]  Find out that the CFR came out and said you're the enemy.
[3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:49.120]  You and your family.
[3:48:49.120 --> 3:48:52.120]  You think I like being surveilled by these bastards?
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:48:56.120]  You think I like the fact that they got their finger right there on the button to kill me?
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:48:58.120]  But they don't want to scare you before it's too late.
[3:48:58.120 --> 3:49:05.120]  They want to move on all of you at once after a few more terror attacks and economic collapse when they got you really under their control grid.
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:12.120]  It's when you think you're safe cops and you're strutting around in your cities with everybody locked down having to thumb scan to leave their homes and buy and sell.
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:16.120]  You think you're the big boss and you're the heroes on TV and everybody kisses your butt?
[3:49:16.120 --> 3:49:24.120]  That's when you're going to get sick and everybody around you is going to be sick and you're going to fall over and die because your dirty masters are going to murder you.
[3:49:24.120 --> 3:49:26.120]  You understand me, boy?
[3:49:26.120 --> 3:49:28.120]  This isn't a joke.
[3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:29.120]  This is for real.
[3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:30.120]  And let me tell you something.
[3:49:30.120 --> 3:49:40.120]  In your gut, all of you out there watching, all of you out there listening, all of you that serve this system, all of you psychopaths that think you're on top of things and think you run the whole show who only care about yourselves.
[3:49:40.120 --> 3:49:43.120]  You know deep in your cowardly gut.
[3:49:43.120 --> 3:49:47.120]  You know I'm telling you the truth right now and you know it's true.
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:55.120]  That's why this show upsets you because you know there's some of us who have courage and who love humanity enough to warn everybody.
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:49:57.120]  And I am mad.
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:49:58.120]  I am bitter.
[3:49:58.120 --> 3:50:01.120]  I am angry because I have sacrificed so much to do this.
[3:50:01.120 --> 3:50:08.120]  I have sacrificed more than you know, more than you can imagine because it's my instinct to defend and warn people.
[3:50:08.120 --> 3:50:10.120]  I am upset about what's happening.
[3:50:10.120 --> 3:50:15.120]  I am disgusted by what's going on.
[3:50:15.120 --> 3:50:23.120]  I don't even want to do this radio show but I do more hours and I'm going to go over four hours today because I've got a responsibility to warn you.
[3:50:23.120 --> 3:50:24.120]  And I'll take your calls.
[3:50:24.120 --> 3:50:28.120]  Eric, Mark, Carter, Mark and a couple others and that's it when we get back.
[3:50:28.120 --> 3:50:34.120]  I'll probably only go 10, 20 minutes into the fifth hour.
[3:50:34.120 --> 3:50:36.120]  God help us.
[3:50:36.120 --> 3:50:38.120]  God help us.
[3:50:38.120 --> 3:50:39.120]  God help us.
[3:50:39.120 --> 3:50:40.120]  God help us.
[3:50:40.120 --> 3:50:41.120]  God help us.
[3:50:41.120 --> 3:50:42.120]  God help us.
[3:50:42.120 --> 3:50:43.120]  God help us.
[3:50:43.120 --> 3:50:44.120]  They're going to claim this crap's going to get out of there.
[3:50:44.120 --> 3:50:46.120]  They're going to say terrorists released it.
[3:50:46.120 --> 3:50:48.120]  It is a big idea.
[3:50:48.120 --> 3:50:50.120]  A new world order.
[3:50:50.120 --> 3:50:55.120]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:50:55.120 --> 3:50:58.120]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:50:58.120 --> 3:51:01.120]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:51:01.120 --> 3:51:06.120]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:51:06.120 --> 3:51:14.120]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:51:14.120 --> 3:51:20.120]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:51:20.120 --> 3:51:24.120]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:51:24.120 --> 3:51:27.120]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:51:27.120 --> 3:51:28.120]  Most people have no idea.
[3:51:28.120 --> 3:51:29.120]  They're not after money.
[3:51:29.120 --> 3:51:30.120]  They have all the money they need.
[3:51:30.120 --> 3:51:31.120]  They're not after power.
[3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:32.120]  That's their aptitude.
[3:51:32.120 --> 3:51:40.120]  Order in game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:51:40.120 --> 3:51:43.120]  In game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:51:43.120 --> 3:51:45.120]  You have been warned.
[3:51:45.120 --> 3:51:52.120]  Fact, rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[3:51:52.120 --> 3:51:56.120]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[3:51:56.120 --> 3:52:01.120]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live,
[3:52:01.120 --> 3:52:03.120]  is unable to remove all toxins.
[3:52:03.120 --> 3:52:04.120]  The solution.
[3:52:04.120 --> 3:52:08.120]  Detoxification integrated with the electrochipramere energy foot spa.
[3:52:08.120 --> 3:52:13.120]  The electrochipramere energy foot spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins,
[3:52:13.120 --> 3:52:17.120]  while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:24.120]  Detoxification works with the electrochipramere energy foot spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells.
[3:52:24.120 --> 3:52:26.120]  The building blocks of human life.
[3:52:26.120 --> 3:52:27.120]  For mental clarity.
[3:52:27.120 --> 3:52:28.120]  Restored vitality.
[3:52:28.120 --> 3:52:30.120]  A stronger immune system.
[3:52:30.120 --> 3:52:33.120]  Clear skin and health in every aspect of your being.

[3:52:42.120 --> 3:52:45.120]  888-212-8871.
[3:52:45.120 --> 3:52:47.120]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[3:52:47.120 --> 3:52:53.120]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[3:52:53.120 --> 3:52:56.120]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:52:56.120 --> 3:53:02.120]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[3:53:02.120 --> 3:53:06.120]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:53:06.120 --> 3:53:11.120]  In the Info War, prisonplanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:53:11.120 --> 3:53:14.120]  Prisonplanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[3:53:35.120 --> 3:53:37.120]  Join prisonplanet.tv.
[3:53:37.120 --> 3:53:39.120]  Burn the info bombs to disc.
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:41.120]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[3:53:41.120 --> 3:53:43.120]  Bring down the New World Order.
[3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:45.120]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[3:53:45.120 --> 3:53:52.120]  I hear the train coming.
[3:53:52.120 --> 3:53:54.120]  It's rolling around the bend.
[3:53:54.120 --> 3:53:57.120]  And I ain't seen the sun shine since.
[3:53:57.120 --> 3:53:59.120]  I don't know when.
[3:53:59.120 --> 3:54:01.120]  I'm stuck in fools in prison.
[3:54:01.120 --> 3:54:05.120]  And time keeps dragging on.
[3:54:05.120 --> 3:54:07.120]  But that train keeps on moving.
[3:54:07.120 --> 3:54:10.120]  But that train keeps on rolling.
[3:54:10.120 --> 3:54:11.120]  On down to.
[3:54:11.120 --> 3:54:13.120]  On down to Stanton.
[3:54:13.120 --> 3:54:16.120]  And the train track that goes to Stanton is right here.
[3:54:16.120 --> 3:54:21.120]  Right down the street.
[3:54:21.120 --> 3:54:23.120]  Don't ever play with guns.
[3:54:23.120 --> 3:54:28.120]  But I shot a man in Reno.
[3:54:28.120 --> 3:54:33.120]  A bunch of control freak murderers are in control of everything.
[3:54:33.120 --> 3:54:36.120]  They got a sick plan for you and your family.
[3:54:36.120 --> 3:54:40.120]  Hey cops, go to any big environmental meeting with top professors.
[3:54:40.120 --> 3:54:43.120]  On climate and the environment.
[3:54:43.120 --> 3:54:47.120]  And watch them get standing ovations when they talk about how they're going to kill everybody.
[3:54:47.120 --> 3:54:49.120]  You'll think you're in a cult.
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:54:52.120]  Hell, who knows? You might join them. You might like it.
[3:54:52.120 --> 3:54:54.120]  Is it powerful to kill everybody?
[3:54:54.120 --> 3:54:56.120]  Well, it made me feel tough.
[3:54:56.120 --> 3:54:58.120]  Is it the law to kill children?
[3:54:58.120 --> 3:55:01.120]  Then I say kill them.
[3:55:01.120 --> 3:55:05.120]  That's the crazy mindset.
[3:55:05.120 --> 3:55:09.120]  I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car.
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:13.120]  They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars.
[3:55:13.120 --> 3:55:16.120]  Oh, I knew I had it coming.
[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:19.120]  I know I can't be free.
[3:55:19.120 --> 3:55:22.120]  But that train keeps on moving.
[3:55:22.120 --> 3:55:27.120]  And that's what tortures me.
[3:55:27.120 --> 3:55:30.120]  All right, I got to stop screwing around in the fourth hour.
[3:55:30.120 --> 3:55:32.120]  I just get not even depressed.
[3:55:32.120 --> 3:55:35.120]  I just get sick of it, man.
[3:55:35.120 --> 3:55:37.120]  I just get tired of it, don't you?
[3:55:37.120 --> 3:55:39.120]  I'm going to continue into the fifth hour.
[3:55:39.120 --> 3:55:42.120]  I got a few other news items I want to hit.
[3:55:42.120 --> 3:55:45.120]  We'll say Bita Genesis here in about four minutes.
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:47.120]  Appreciate John Harmon up there on the show.
[3:55:47.120 --> 3:55:49.120]  Ted Anderson, everybody.
[3:55:49.120 --> 3:55:54.120]  I got Snoop in here running the things down here in Austin, Texas.
[3:55:54.120 --> 3:55:57.120]  And Sneaky Snoops, his name.
[3:55:57.120 --> 3:56:00.120]  And then I'm going to quit screwing around.
[3:56:00.120 --> 3:56:02.120]  We're going to go ahead and take some of your calls.
[3:56:02.120 --> 3:56:05.120]  Eric and Philly, you're on the air. Good to hear from you, Eric.
[3:56:05.120 --> 3:56:07.120]  Hey, Alex. Hi.
[3:56:07.120 --> 3:56:09.120]  Hey, how you doing?
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:13.120]  You know, we really do appreciate your work ethic.
[3:56:13.120 --> 3:56:17.120]  It's a very good influence on us.
[3:56:17.120 --> 3:56:19.120]  Well, thank you, Commander.
[3:56:19.120 --> 3:56:22.120]  Right. So I have a whole list of stuff here.
[3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:25.120]  I want to talk to you, but I don't even know where to begin.
[3:56:25.120 --> 3:56:27.120]  Start with the Pricity and John.
[3:56:27.120 --> 3:56:29.120]  All right.
[3:56:29.120 --> 3:56:30.120]  It's up.
[3:56:30.120 --> 3:56:34.120]  One thing people talk about is how the Wuminati worships Lucifer.
[3:56:34.120 --> 3:56:36.120]  And that's why they're so bad.
[3:56:36.120 --> 3:56:38.120]  Yes.
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:41.120]  Do you think Lucifer is real?
[3:56:41.120 --> 3:56:43.120]  I do believe, yeah.
[3:56:43.120 --> 3:56:45.120]  There's a dark forest called whatever name you want.
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:47.120]  The point is that even if you don't believe in it,
[3:56:47.120 --> 3:56:51.120]  the globalists believe in it very strongly.
[3:56:51.120 --> 3:56:52.120]  Right.
[3:56:52.120 --> 3:56:55.120]  And are you familiar with Skype?
[3:56:55.120 --> 3:56:56.120]  Yeah.
[3:56:56.120 --> 3:57:00.120]  Skype's a form of internet communication over kind of like a phone line.
[3:57:00.120 --> 3:57:01.120]  Right.
[3:57:01.120 --> 3:57:05.120]  And there's a Skype cast where you can like host it and have people call in or whatever.
[3:57:05.120 --> 3:57:09.120]  And I've been talking to a lot of Saudis and stuff like that and telling them
[3:57:09.120 --> 3:57:13.120]  about that story about the Palestinian guy in Austin that you were just talking about.
[3:57:13.120 --> 3:57:16.120]  I was getting that story out to them.
[3:57:16.120 --> 3:57:20.120]  Yeah. I noticed all the sites that say I don't talk about Israel and I do every day
[3:57:20.120 --> 3:57:24.120]  wouldn't post the stories we had about him being probably murdered.
[3:57:24.120 --> 3:57:29.120]  Because it's more important just to hate me and be right about the fact that I'm bad
[3:57:29.120 --> 3:57:32.120]  than it ever is to admit that they're wrong and have slandered me.
[3:57:32.120 --> 3:57:34.120]  Same thing with the Catholics run it all crowd.
[3:57:34.120 --> 3:57:37.120]  Yeah. It's the Illuminati run it all.
[3:57:37.120 --> 3:57:39.120]  That's right. And they run every major group.
[3:57:39.120 --> 3:57:42.120]  It doesn't say that these other groups aren't evil or bad or being controlled.
[3:57:42.120 --> 3:57:45.120]  It just means it's a larger overarching system.
[3:57:45.120 --> 3:57:46.120]  Good to hear from you.
[3:57:46.120 --> 3:57:49.120]  We're going to end this side of the GCN Radio Network transmission now.
[3:57:49.120 --> 3:57:52.120]  There are the audio streams over at infowars.com,
[3:57:52.120 --> 3:57:55.120]  the one place to listen to the overdrive,
[3:57:55.120 --> 3:58:01.120]  or to watch us online at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:58:01.120 --> 3:58:04.120]  Where for 15 cents a day you can see the fourth hour.
[3:58:04.120 --> 3:58:06.120]  A lot of times more than that.
[3:58:06.120 --> 3:58:09.120]  On video, the document cam, the guest cam,
[3:58:09.120 --> 3:58:12.120]  and a lot more at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:58:12.120 --> 3:58:15.120]  15 cents a day and your membership lets us hire more people
