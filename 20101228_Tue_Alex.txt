[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:40.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.560 --> 00:49.200]  and gentlemen we are live it is Tuesday the 28th day of December 2010 we're gonna
[00:49.200 --> 00:53.880]  be live here for the next three hours we've got a lot of important news we're
[00:53.880 --> 00:58.760]  gonna go over and here in just a moment but first I wanted to just throw out
[00:58.760 --> 01:04.360]  there that we've got Charlotte is or be joining us in the third hour today it's
[01:04.360 --> 01:08.920]  been about a year since I've had her on and then I suddenly had her on a month
[01:08.920 --> 01:15.040]  ago and then two weeks ago because she's basically completely retiring and
[01:15.040 --> 01:21.520]  going on a three-month tour around the world here next month and who knows we
[01:21.520 --> 01:25.840]  may never hear from her again I'm sure we'll hear from her again it's kind of
[01:25.840 --> 01:29.800]  like dr. Paul Craig Roberts saying he's done he's gone and then a few months
[01:29.800 --> 01:36.440]  later popping back up people get sick of the new world order and they they try to
[01:36.440 --> 01:39.680]  get away from it but then you can't get away from it because it's everywhere and
[01:39.680 --> 01:43.240]  they just come back but she hasn't said she's completely leaving forever she's
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.560]  just gonna be gone for a while and so I figure get her on because it's important
[01:48.560 --> 01:52.480]  and I'll tell you more about that when we come back the next segment because her
[01:52.480 --> 01:58.640]  father was sculling bones and Bohemian Grove so was her grandfather and she's
[01:58.640 --> 02:02.840]  the lady who leaked Anthony Sutton the material that was his big seminal book
[02:02.840 --> 02:07.680]  she was the secret source but she couldn't reveal that when her father was
[02:07.680 --> 02:13.320]  still alive and of course he died what was it five six years ago then she could
[02:13.320 --> 02:18.320]  reveal that she was indeed the source and I set the guys up a few weeks ago to
[02:18.320 --> 02:29.000]  interview her as I'm just going over it now up in Maine and she talked to him
[02:29.000 --> 02:32.640]  for several hours about the deliberate dumbing down of society the documents
[02:32.640 --> 02:34.920]  that she got when she was the head of policy at the Department of Education
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.240]  and then as an aside they did like an hour interview and she showed them the
[02:40.240 --> 02:43.960]  sculling bones grandfather clocks they've got and all these books they were
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.000]  allowed to videotape some of it she didn't want videotaped but the guys
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.400]  were able to see it just amazing stuff I mean you want to go inside sculling
[02:53.400 --> 03:02.600]  bones this is the closest you can get to the real deal so we got her joining us
[03:02.600 --> 03:08.920]  for a full hour coming up in the last hour of transmission today now that said
[03:08.920 --> 03:14.160]  we had a lot of other news obviously here and I've tried this many times and
[03:14.160 --> 03:20.200]  almost always failed but when you first don't succeed try try again buy
[03:20.200 --> 03:26.840]  increments I get a bit better about it I'm going to attempt to read just the
[03:26.840 --> 03:33.240]  headline and maybe a brief one-sentence comment on almost all of the hundred or
[03:33.240 --> 03:38.080]  so news articles in front of me when I read each one of these articles it
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.000]  causes a giant brainstorm connections understandings and then I tend to just
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.720]  start going into one story and then never even getting to the next but I will
[03:46.720 --> 03:50.440]  attempt to just hit the headlines then dive back into some of the articles and
[03:50.440 --> 04:02.400]  and then in the second hour we are going to take a marathon of phone calls this
[04:02.400 --> 04:07.040]  will be another attempt either the caller calls in with something so
[04:07.040 --> 04:13.520]  incredible that I go back and forth with them for 20 minutes or I take a call
[04:13.520 --> 04:16.600]  and then hang up on them and then rant about a subject for 20 minutes and take
[04:16.600 --> 04:19.720]  two or three calls an hour I want to attempt and I'm only succeeded a few
[04:19.720 --> 04:27.120]  times to take 30 or 40 phone calls next hour okay and so next hour I'm gonna
[04:27.120 --> 04:33.160]  open up my phone system here in Austin and we're gonna open the Genesis phone
[04:33.160 --> 04:39.560]  system and we're gonna give each caller about 45 seconds I'm gonna do it gonna
[04:39.560 --> 04:43.360]  happen of course all the folks that answer the phones take the calls go this
[04:43.360 --> 04:46.760]  will be easy they're out there placing bets what do you think I'll take five
[04:46.760 --> 04:54.040]  calls yeah I'll spot you 20 takes seven all right I'm taking six we'll see what
[04:54.040 --> 04:57.520]  happens big transmission a lot of key intel straight ahead you don't want to

[06:58.840 --> 07:02.920]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[07:02.920 --> 07:07.240]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[07:07.240 --> 07:11.440]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[07:11.440 --> 07:15.440]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[07:15.440 --> 07:19.320]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[07:19.320 --> 07:23.600]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[07:23.600 --> 07:27.760]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[07:27.760 --> 07:32.080]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[07:32.080 --> 07:35.320]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[07:35.320 --> 07:39.640]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[07:39.640 --> 07:42.960]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[07:42.960 --> 07:46.200]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[07:46.200 --> 07:51.200]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[07:51.200 --> 07:56.000]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[07:56.000 --> 08:05.440]  1-877-327-0365 from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[08:05.440 --> 08:13.360]  the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:17.640 --> 08:24.440]  until Anthony Sutton wrote his pivotal book several decades ago on skull and
[08:24.440 --> 08:30.320]  bones and America's secret establishment the mainstream media basically
[08:30.320 --> 08:37.640]  denied that the Yale secret society even existed but Anthony Sutton was able
[08:37.640 --> 08:45.200]  to bust it wide open with the internal secret annals of skull and bones now a
[08:45.200 --> 08:49.320]  lot of times things are hidden in plain view I've had Charlotte is or beyond
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.280]  many many times on this syndicated radio broadcast and we are live the 28th
[08:54.280 --> 09:01.640]  day of December 2010 on this Tuesday and she is retiring from doing radio
[09:01.640 --> 09:05.360]  interviews and things for the foreseeable future so I've had her on
[09:05.360 --> 09:11.880]  twice in the last month and I sent a crew Aaron Dykes and Rob do three weeks
[09:11.880 --> 09:17.680]  ago up to Maine to interview her before she leaves the country for several
[09:17.680 --> 09:23.800]  months of travel to basically get it on record everything she witnessed at the
[09:23.800 --> 09:29.200]  Department of Education as the head of policy and I had put a footnote on there
[09:29.200 --> 09:32.800]  because I knew that she was the person who had given Sutton all the
[09:32.800 --> 09:36.000]  information she couldn't talk about that when her father skull and bones
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.400]  Bohemian Grove her grandfather skull and bones Bohemian Grove his father
[09:40.400 --> 09:45.280]  skull and bones true Eastern establishment you know blue blood family
[09:45.280 --> 09:51.960]  she couldn't go public about that till her father died and as an aside I said
[09:51.960 --> 09:55.320]  then get into skull and bones with her well the two-hour interview expanded
[09:55.320 --> 09:59.040]  into a three three and a half hour interview on skull and bones on Bohemian
[09:59.040 --> 10:02.680]  Grove she showed them skull and bones grandfather clocks that's what each
[10:02.680 --> 10:07.840]  member gets when they become a made member of it upon graduation she took
[10:07.840 --> 10:15.960]  them into secret annals she let them videotape most of it not some of it and I
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.360]  haven't talked to her yet but when I get her back on the show today I think I'm
[10:20.360 --> 10:24.040]  gonna be sending the boys before she leaves coming up in just a couple weeks
[10:24.040 --> 10:32.320]  back up there because talking to him a lot of it was even stuff she said don't
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.280]  videotape it it was just after the interview was over she's like her son
[10:36.280 --> 10:41.000]  is like oh show them show them the stuff in the attic and then they pull out
[10:41.000 --> 10:45.200]  even more secret skull and bone stuff I mean you think everything Anthony Sutton
[10:45.200 --> 10:50.120]  pulled out was powerful it was from Charlotte is or be but it's the mother
[10:50.120 --> 10:54.400]  load up there the mother load I mean all of it everything you see in the Good
[10:54.400 --> 10:59.360]  Shepherd the Robert De Niro produced film with Matt Damon everything you see
[10:59.360 --> 11:04.440]  in you know the big best-selling books about secrets of the tomb with
[11:04.440 --> 11:09.600]  Alexandra Robbins and all the rest of it this is where it all comes from and
[11:09.600 --> 11:18.040]  more you know I started making a JFK film that I never finished for five years
[11:18.040 --> 11:21.880]  been working on it I want to make another occult masterpiece film that
[11:21.880 --> 11:25.240]  really shows how the secret societies operate and why they have secret
[11:25.240 --> 11:29.800]  societies I've been working for two years on the master eugenics film I've been
[11:29.800 --> 11:33.680]  working for over a year and a half on a chemtrail film which is absolutely
[11:33.680 --> 11:40.360]  proves everything it's it's it's unbelievable but regardless we've got
[11:40.360 --> 11:46.400]  for prison planet TV members and by next week we're gonna have the special
[11:46.400 --> 11:49.680]  video interview with Charlotte is or be with many video shots of these
[11:49.680 --> 11:54.800]  documents and internal skeletons books going up on prison planet TV sometime
[11:54.800 --> 11:59.840]  next week and we've got the Russell means at wounded knee video going up this
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.360]  week we've had the inside the ran corporation only person never be given
[12:04.360 --> 12:08.560]  access to their annals because they thought he was one of them Alex Abaya
[12:08.560 --> 12:12.920]  that went up I mean these are exclusive interviews all over the country that
[12:12.920 --> 12:20.280]  prisonplanet.tv members get it all in one place in the highest quality and I
[12:20.280 --> 12:26.240]  allow folks I encourage people to basically create a username and passcode
[12:26.240 --> 12:29.960]  that you can share with friends and family obviously don't have the same
[12:29.960 --> 12:32.760]  username and passcode that you use for other things if you're gonna share it
[12:32.760 --> 12:37.920]  but that's common sense and six people can be logged in with the same username
[12:37.920 --> 12:41.760]  passcode at the same time so you can share it with friends and family our goal
[12:41.760 --> 12:47.880]  is to get the word up I do want to tell you that we got words strangely enough
[12:47.880 --> 12:53.920]  two weeks ago from YouTube that the info warrior backup YouTube channel that
[12:53.920 --> 12:58.120]  we set up a few years ago that when Burmese was here we've been using the
[12:58.120 --> 13:02.260]  post of his stuff we got word from them that oh you've been given director
[13:02.260 --> 13:06.760]  status on this account so now we can upload two three four hour five hour
[13:06.760 --> 13:11.720]  videos if we want to it and so yes well the exclusive interviews that have been
[13:11.720 --> 13:17.480]  going up to prisonplanet.tv are being a ladled out for everyone for free and
[13:17.480 --> 13:21.480]  most people who have a subscription site would not be making announcements about
[13:21.480 --> 13:24.760]  it but I know I have wonderful listeners that have prisonplanet.tv
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.080]  memberships because they want to support us and because they want to have a
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.600]  access to where everything is archived in one place and so if you can't afford
[13:33.600 --> 13:39.200]  the 595 a month or during until early next year we're gonna be offering the

[13:42.600 --> 13:49.720]  5.3 months free we're not here to make money that is certainly something we
[13:49.720 --> 13:53.440]  need to do to operate and something we need to do to be able to continue to
[13:53.440 --> 13:56.600]  operate and expand in the fight against the globalist in the face of the
[13:56.600 --> 14:01.720]  globalist but the number one over-driving directive the prime
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.840]  directive is engage the globalist resist them break people out of their
[14:06.840 --> 14:11.320]  mind control trance engage the new world order shadow the left right paradigm

[14:22.760 --> 14:29.720]  honest and wholesome which historically ever enlightenment and empowerment and
[14:29.720 --> 14:37.200]  beauty and creativity has flowed from like a mountain spring versus the pus
[14:37.200 --> 14:44.680]  that flows from the scruffulous cankerous new world order filth pit so I

[15:35.400 --> 15:41.120]  defeat the globalist quicker okay I'm not doing something that is that is
[15:41.120 --> 15:48.720]  heroic here it's called survival if you corner a raccoon a raccoon will attack
[15:48.720 --> 15:51.920]  a grizzly bear of its corner and sometimes win because it'll run around
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.280]  jubble on the back of the bear and start clawing its eyes out that's been
[15:55.280 --> 16:01.280]  videotaped it's got the fight and spirit you ever seen a Wolverine whoopey
[16:01.280 --> 16:09.320]  mountain lion that weighs four five six times it's got the initiative but you
[16:09.320 --> 16:14.320]  can also try to get out of the way of the grizzly bear and I'm just trying to
[16:14.320 --> 16:18.440]  get people to have their basic survival instinct and recognize that the
[16:18.440 --> 16:23.120]  globalist are a threat that the globalist are a threat and that if we
[16:23.120 --> 16:27.280]  recognize it's a threat we can do incredible things together and we are
[16:27.280 --> 16:33.400]  cornered we are under assault all of us together they like to give the delusion
[16:33.400 --> 16:39.400]  to bureaucrats and control freaks and uniformed enforcers and executives that
[16:39.400 --> 16:42.880]  they're part of the elite that's the disease at the average yuppie even
[16:42.880 --> 16:48.680]  making fifty thousand a year believes their members of the elite and the
[16:48.680 --> 16:52.200]  minute you show them and prove to them that they're under assault and that
[16:52.200 --> 16:55.320]  they're under attack many of them will finally wake up and break their
[16:55.320 --> 17:03.760]  conditioning now the point here is my over driving mission is to have a
[17:03.760 --> 17:08.880]  healthy happy society we'll never have a utopia but if we just give in to the
[17:08.880 --> 17:12.160]  fact that all that's the way it is corruptions the way it is and we just
[17:12.160 --> 17:16.840]  give into it we know things are going to fall apart even faster we know
[17:16.840 --> 17:21.680]  globalism is a disease it is modern slavery it is high-tech serfdom we know
[17:21.680 --> 17:26.720]  its fruits are death and poison we must resist it we don't have a choice and the
[17:26.720 --> 17:32.320]  big secret is when we get up on our hind legs we have victory after victory
[17:32.320 --> 17:41.720]  after victory so I am not a hero I am a cornered badger I am a cornered
[17:41.720 --> 17:49.400]  Wolverine I am a cornered little dog okay it's the same thing and I don't have
[17:49.400 --> 17:53.320]  a choice and I'm doing everything I can doesn't mean I'm perfect all the answers
[17:53.320 --> 17:59.160]  to fight the globalist and God bless you all for what you've done and and your

[24:29.600 --> 24:32.280]  scanned some of this in and put on her website but we can't make it ever
[24:32.280 --> 24:36.840]  download maybe she was consented to the file as a zip file also when I
[24:36.840 --> 24:40.360]  interview her son he's really informed an interesting and former military guy
[24:40.360 --> 24:44.240]  and demolition special forces guy I want to in fact I wanted to interview him
[24:44.240 --> 24:47.680]  while we were up there but I guess he had to go to work or something but I want
[24:47.680 --> 24:51.960]  to send you both back up there to get the full skull and bones interview did
[24:51.960 --> 24:56.880]  you get video of the grandfather clocks and all that yeah we shot that a lot of
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.320]  that but then she pulled out the real stuff after the interview was done oh
[25:00.320 --> 25:05.160]  yeah the hardcore yeah we were we packed up everything and I mean literally
[25:05.160 --> 25:08.360]  everything was packed up it took us an hour to pack everything up and we were
[25:08.360 --> 25:12.240]  kind of you know chit-chatting with her eating cookies eating cookies and she
[25:12.240 --> 25:16.920]  said she sent her son she said go get the books up in the attic or even he
[25:16.920 --> 25:21.440]  met he had the idea I think and he came back and and it was you know rosters of
[25:21.440 --> 25:26.080]  who's this is after she interviewed for six full yeah I mean we talked for she
[25:26.080 --> 25:29.880]  was really tired at the end she was like huh and really all right five more
[25:29.880 --> 25:34.640]  questions you know well here's the deal I know she wanted to go for all that time
[25:34.640 --> 25:39.960]  oh yeah literal Vulcan mind-meld you got to get up there and get two hours on
[25:39.960 --> 25:43.400]  skull and bones all right now she did speak you guys said about an hour on
[25:43.400 --> 25:46.600]  skull and bones we've got that going up on prison planet on TV next week she
[25:46.600 --> 25:51.240]  talked a lot about her father and in his relationship with skull and bones
[25:51.240 --> 25:57.040]  she did a really long you know well I've got a list of questions yeah like the
[25:57.040 --> 26:03.640]  rituals and how it ties into different elites and everything so I really want
[26:03.640 --> 26:07.760]  to get you back up there because like I said she's leaving for three months and
[26:07.760 --> 26:14.280]  her books out of print and she's kind of silent she's 80 years old now yeah she
[26:14.280 --> 26:18.080]  looks good though she does run around she cooked this dinner so she's nice
[26:18.080 --> 26:22.400]  lady I know you guys got in late because of global warming blizzards you're she
[26:22.400 --> 26:26.080]  was demanding you know that she would give you a good old main hospitality and
[26:26.080 --> 26:30.440]  you stay there we did upstanding a hotel because you got in so late but I'm sure
[26:30.440 --> 26:33.760]  she won't mind you coming back now that she's sweet on both of you and make you
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.960]  more cookies and stuff get that information man yeah because you know
[26:37.960 --> 26:41.040]  she plays herself down she's the person that blew it wide open through Sutton
[26:41.040 --> 26:45.920]  we need to get the full data information of the people we can do it I
[26:45.920 --> 26:49.560]  remember just ten years ago with the system denying that skull bones even
[26:49.560 --> 26:54.000]  existed yeah you know I've read the Anthony Sutton book and the interesting
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.080]  thing is he was able to put all that together through the list because you
[26:58.080 --> 27:01.760]  know we did flip through it even though we didn't film the list I see a guy like
[27:01.760 --> 27:07.280]  Avril Harriman he has a bio more than half a two-thirds of a page long because
[27:07.280 --> 27:11.120]  he did so many diplomatic things while doing all this skull duggery through
[27:11.120 --> 27:15.200]  skull and bones with Russia and Nazi Germany you know alongside Prescott Bush
[27:15.200 --> 27:18.480]  and the others as you know and so that's how he was able to piece it all
[27:18.480 --> 27:22.480]  together because it has all the kind of suppressed bios of all these individuals
[27:22.480 --> 27:27.080]  yeah it shows what they did shows our activity and then on top of that she is
[27:27.080 --> 27:30.960]  this rare book from the the Reese hearings in Congress and I think it was
[27:30.960 --> 27:34.720]  19 the government had destroyed right they thought yes she thinks she has the
[27:34.720 --> 27:39.400]  only cop how much was she offered for that she actually bought it off of a guy
[27:39.400 --> 27:43.560]  who was offered a lot of money for it from the Rockefellers they offered him
[27:43.560 --> 27:47.200]  you know whatever you want they said name your price and he didn't sell and
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.680]  then she sold it to Charles he sold it to Charlotte for you know it was about
[27:52.680 --> 27:57.200]  $3,000 and then didn't he fall down and hit his head then I don't I think I
[27:57.200 --> 28:00.440]  remember reading that okay so what else you want to throw out at folks about this
[28:00.440 --> 28:05.400]  interview that's coming up live today I mean we're gonna recap a lot of stuff
[28:05.400 --> 28:09.480]  she's talked about Charlotte's a wealth of knowledge and you know just sitting
[28:09.480 --> 28:14.120]  back listening to you know the people from you know from two generations back
[28:14.120 --> 28:19.320]  she's really got her eye on things and she's really been able to chronological
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.160]  lies a lot of this stuff is in terms of education that's her main forte but then
[28:23.160 --> 28:27.040]  going into skull and bones I mean she's just a wealth of knowledge so you know
[28:27.040 --> 28:30.840]  you can learn a lot and you talk about her hidden influence with the Sutton
[28:30.840 --> 28:36.000]  book the real story of skull and bones back in the early 1830s had to do with
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.200]  education because they sent the key scholars over to Germany to learn the
[28:40.200 --> 28:43.760]  psychological techniques because the Prussians had funded it to create total
[28:43.760 --> 28:47.880]  brainwash zombies that's on record and now we have total brainwash zombies
[28:47.880 --> 28:53.000]  well she's an expert on education obviously she's traced that back and it
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.320]  ties in with the skull and bones so it's all the more interesting for that
[28:56.320 --> 28:59.320]  reason by the way this article that I intend to get to later this week if I
[28:59.320 --> 29:04.160]  have time but I want to spend like an hour on it it's about how Indonesia got
[29:04.160 --> 29:11.280]  founded and it's a really wicked article like oh it's authoritarian but but it's
[29:11.280 --> 29:18.240]  still you know for the overall good excuse me Singapore but in there it
[29:18.240 --> 29:25.240]  admits this British trained basically dictator set it up and it admits that
[29:25.240 --> 29:29.480]  it's designed to have people not think for themselves and be robots the article
[29:29.480 --> 29:34.320]  admits that but but it tells you how good that is Aaron isn't that nice stay
[29:34.320 --> 29:36.480]  there I want to finish up briefly with skull and bones I'm gonna get to all the
[29:36.480 --> 29:39.920]  news then your phone calls coming up any other tidbits you want to add we're

[33:28.920 --> 33:34.440]  this later they've got video and still photos but let's go over the grandfather
[33:34.440 --> 33:42.000]  clocks and why these are so important in all the skull and bones photographs the
[33:42.000 --> 33:48.880]  way they arrange the men the skulls the grave robbing they do the sexual
[33:48.880 --> 33:54.640]  activities in the Kalman error the worshiping of Lucifer some of this
[33:54.640 --> 33:59.320]  even caught on video by the New York Observer is there being leaked all of
[33:59.320 --> 34:04.240]  this years before but as you guys are talking we'll show some of these photos
[34:04.240 --> 34:09.200]  what is this on screen right now these are the certificates they go along with
[34:09.200 --> 34:13.120]  getting a grandfather clock when you're a member of skull and bones she showed us
[34:13.120 --> 34:17.360]  the photo to it's not in this stack of her grandfather he was one of the two
[34:17.360 --> 34:22.600]  seated in the front row with the other 14 members total of 16 right on the
[34:22.600 --> 34:27.520]  back row yes with the grandfather clock the son told us a story about when you
[34:27.520 --> 34:31.000]  get the grandfather clock they want you to show that you're willing to
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.960]  participate in skull and bones so they give you the money but you have to do
[34:35.960 --> 34:39.760]  the specifications for the clock so they're all unique and they all have
[34:39.760 --> 34:43.240]  different stylings but they're all official skull and bones and so that's
[34:43.240 --> 34:47.440]  her father's certificate of that he's a full-born made member of the true mafia
[34:47.440 --> 34:51.080]  pretty much and that that's a lot of correspondence there between him and the
[34:51.080 --> 34:55.960]  clockmaker and how much it was it wasn't in today's dollars it wasn't that
[34:55.960 --> 35:02.520]  expensive you know around 300 but the clock is also a signet where if you're
[35:02.520 --> 35:05.080]  living somewhere overseas and other skull and bones member who may have
[35:05.080 --> 35:08.280]  never met you from another class they can come and see the clock sure has
[35:08.280 --> 35:12.480]  certain symbols put into it and it's always five minutes fast and it never
[35:12.480 --> 35:17.000]  stops they have it timed out to where they make it to where it never stops it's
[35:17.000 --> 35:21.040]  never supposed to stop yeah they told us the father was very particular about
[35:21.040 --> 35:24.720]  making sure the clock never stopped and they never knew why he was so preoccupied
[35:24.720 --> 35:29.240]  with it but it's because that's the tradition yeah so and there there's a
[35:29.240 --> 35:32.800]  good shot of the clock right there well it's more than that they supposedly put
[35:32.800 --> 35:37.160]  something into the clock it's a bunch of black magic but well I agree but and you
[35:37.160 --> 35:41.640]  also see the the associated fraternity I forget the name of it I'm not that
[35:41.640 --> 35:45.480]  familiar with the Greek letters but oh right yeah the the actual Greek letters
[35:45.480 --> 35:51.600]  for skull and bones that she gets into their worship of eulogyum eulogyas
[35:51.600 --> 35:55.800]  their main deity she might she talked a little bit about that mainly it was how
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.040]  her father went into Bohemian Grove and he apparently didn't like it that much
[36:00.040 --> 36:03.560]  he only won a couple times yeah well when he was dying of cancer she's she's
[36:03.560 --> 36:06.880]  told this before on air she was listening to him for months to radio
[36:06.880 --> 36:10.480]  interviews about the New World Order yeah well she was taken care of him and he
[36:10.480 --> 36:14.760]  were penned and became a Christian and accepted Jesus and and just wouldn't
[36:14.760 --> 36:17.720]  get into me that he just said it's horrible it's horrible and that's what
[36:17.720 --> 36:22.160]  Nixon said to he told her he said you know if I if I was still able to I would
[36:22.160 --> 36:26.240]  help you you know that's what he said well a couple days before he before he
[36:26.240 --> 36:30.800]  passed so pretty it is pretty powerful interview the whole makes me want to cry
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.360]  that's beautiful yeah I mean you know I think people eventually you'll people
[36:35.360 --> 36:38.400]  will see the evil and you know they're either gonna accept it or they're gonna
[36:38.400 --> 36:43.760]  push it away and you know who knows what the society was like back then well
[36:43.760 --> 36:49.440]  there is something sexy and powerful about evil true black evil but once you
[36:49.440 --> 36:54.320]  really get close to it you find out it is not good right and you know his soul
[36:54.320 --> 36:58.320]  was probably you know aching at some point and hearing I think hearing his
[36:58.320 --> 37:03.400]  daughter hit the path and you know she's faced a lot of stuff for the past she's
[37:03.400 --> 37:07.560]  taking a lot of people you know her her family's kind of divided on how you know
[37:07.560 --> 37:12.800]  all the work she does so her son's her the son that we met is totally you know
[37:12.800 --> 37:17.040]  with her he was he's an interesting guy tell tell folks about him yeah he was in
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.080]  Iraqi one yeah Samuel is his name and right when we got there he pulled out
[37:21.080 --> 37:27.080]  two photos from the Pentagon blast it was going over how you know he's like
[37:27.080 --> 37:30.560]  this is an incendiary device because there's no smoke and here's the smoke
[37:30.560 --> 37:34.040]  three seconds like he says it's it's high-powered plastic explosive sure white
[37:34.040 --> 37:38.000]  orange blast well and there's people that were talking about smelling cordite in
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.680]  the Pentagon they knew what it smelled like and they could smell it and you know
[37:41.680 --> 37:45.440]  it just had so happened that was the the the area of the building that was hit
[37:45.440 --> 37:49.520]  that would that had all the financial records from the two trillion that
[37:49.520 --> 37:55.520]  disappeared you know that Romsell was talking about on September 10th so all
[37:55.520 --> 38:00.960]  that stuff got destroyed and you know that there's a few people in there that
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.880]  I guess who were in on that investigation also died so of them there
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.360]  wasn't about hundred people died and have we shown the the we have shown the
[38:11.360 --> 38:15.960]  grandfather clock correct yeah I'm amazing well go get on the phone with
[38:15.960 --> 38:21.520]  it right now she's a sweetheart get up there get the full data as soon as you
[38:21.520 --> 38:27.480]  can she's leaving soon right good job men all right that's coming up in an
[38:27.480 --> 38:31.120]  hour and a half and I said I'd get into the news and I'm going to get into the
[38:31.120 --> 38:37.960]  news oh Aaron real quick you listen to my Christmas Eve audio blog I don't know
[38:37.960 --> 38:41.240]  how to describe it but I think it's got some good Intel and some good issues that
[38:41.240 --> 38:44.800]  we haven't really talked about before but also some issues we have kind of ties
[38:44.800 --> 38:48.040]  it all together you've written an article about it it's up on prisonplanet.com
[38:48.040 --> 38:53.600]  it's also up on GCNlive.com Alex Jones audio blog war on common sense losing
[38:53.600 --> 38:56.920]  our cultural instincts under the New World Order what's your take on this
[38:56.920 --> 39:01.200]  and latest audio blog well you know these audio blogs are always when you're
[39:01.200 --> 39:05.760]  very reflective and kind of almost in a spiritual mode but we've talked so much
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.840]  in endgame and the others about the artificial humanity that's being created
[39:09.840 --> 39:13.800]  under this New World Order system and here you are at Christmas time talking
[39:13.800 --> 39:18.200]  about how even when our culture was never perfect we're losing our cultural
[39:18.200 --> 39:22.440]  instincts in the common sense of just kind of following our ancestors and
[39:22.440 --> 39:26.640]  recognizing you know what they have done for us in the past and so it's very
[39:26.640 --> 39:30.000]  interesting I think and and people in the past did think about their
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.080]  progeny and future progeny and it was all about building up humanity and then
[39:34.080 --> 39:38.520]  and that man could be improved the globalist attitude is we're all animals
[39:38.520 --> 39:43.680]  they are ascendant gods we have to be exterminated and that's actually in the
[39:43.680 --> 39:48.560]  National Geographic article they talk to the minister mentor the the the 80-something
[39:48.560 --> 39:55.840]  year-old dictator of you know this Singaporean model system and they
[39:55.840 --> 39:58.360]  admit it's the model for the New World Order they don't tell you that the
[39:58.360 --> 40:02.560]  British set it up as a front you know that is a publicly available you know
[40:02.560 --> 40:06.680]  the Singaporeans and the minister mentor he's just an MI6 officer and a
[40:06.680 --> 40:11.520]  communist Marxist who set up a capitalist haven and it's all about the
[40:11.520 --> 40:15.520]  humanization and he talks about Confucius was wrong we cannot improve
[40:15.520 --> 40:21.280]  man we can only basically dumb man down into vassal slaves and this article
[40:21.280 --> 40:24.960]  basically ends with how great it is I mean these people are sick this is one
[40:24.960 --> 40:28.800]  of the biggest magazines in the country writing an article selling you pure evil
[40:28.800 --> 40:32.480]  I haven't seen this article Alex but all that stuff you're talking about riddled
[40:32.480 --> 40:36.240]  in what out of Suxley and all the others have always said learning to love your
[40:36.240 --> 40:41.600]  servitude you mentioned in this blog how people will mindlessly defend the road
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.600]  to servitude that we're being set under it's about selling ourselves out as
[40:45.600 --> 40:49.280]  humans I think so it's definitely something to think about and they admit
[40:49.280 --> 40:54.720]  this article the people are comfortable they're horribly unhappy but they have
[40:54.720 --> 41:01.440]  this petty bobbles and they describe it he's talking to a psychiatrist in the
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.320]  islands ruled by psychiatrists and they spy on everybody and they execute you
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.400]  basically we criticize the government but our media says it's great and they
[41:10.400 --> 41:13.320]  also I know internally drug the water supply but they do different tests in the
[41:13.320 --> 41:17.400]  population and and the psychiatrist describes it as slitting your wrist and
[41:17.400 --> 41:22.160]  easing into a hot tub of water and they say oh we've we're dying out faster than
[41:22.160 --> 41:25.280]  anybody you know we have one of the lowest replacement rates in the world
[41:25.280 --> 41:30.360]  and it's like it's wonderful we're dying we're dead there's no future it's oh
[41:30.360 --> 41:35.440]  it's beautiful I mean this is literally like hellraiser that's who these people
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.040]  are I've read some about the Tavistock Institute and I think it's very
[41:40.040 --> 41:44.360]  interesting that Edward Bernays who produced the modern consumer society on
[41:44.360 --> 41:49.160]  the one hand was involved and so were people technocrats like out as Huxley so
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.480]  where does that merge the scientific dictatorship with with buying into this
[41:53.480 --> 41:58.840]  bread and circuses and the bobbles and the rest of the consumerism well we know
[41:58.840 --> 42:04.880]  that globalism is death and we know it is you know not improving man it is
[42:04.880 --> 42:09.320]  destroying who we are and it's being done greedily by the elitist who don't
[42:09.320 --> 42:13.480]  believe any of what they're pushing they don't actually you believe that we
[42:13.480 --> 42:18.240]  can't be improved they when you get deeper believe they are improved and
[42:18.240 --> 42:23.280]  we're trash and really it's an active mode of full-spectrum dominance total
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.000]  control just like the Romans if you resisted them too much they just kill
[42:27.000 --> 42:31.560]  everybody or the Israelites they would go into an area of and people resisted
[42:31.560 --> 42:35.840]  they wipe everybody out this is actually an ancient form of domination and
[42:35.840 --> 42:41.280]  because you know you want when everybody else is dead and the problem is with the
[42:41.280 --> 42:45.280]  globalist is they're gonna continue with this and kill each other there could
[42:45.280 --> 42:49.800]  be two globalist 500 years from now with live ascension technology you know
[42:49.800 --> 42:56.120]  who were 600 years old in a you know crystal palace on Jupiter for one of
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.560]  its moons obviously not on Jupiter the gas giant who knows and those two would
[43:00.560 --> 43:04.480]  be fighting with each other over the power I mean I mean it is a guarantee
[43:04.480 --> 43:09.240]  yeah in our time we're living under this nightmare like the HD Wells rhetoric
[43:09.240 --> 43:13.300]  where we're gonna split into two species that's totally in fitting with the
[43:13.300 --> 43:18.040]  eugenic dream of becoming godhood yeah well I mean they're on power trips
[43:18.040 --> 43:22.720]  there they have high IQs they compete with each other through a social
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.880]  Darwinistic template but the truth is they are psychopathic or at least
[43:27.880 --> 43:33.640]  sociopathic control freaks who have constructed a scientific rationale and
[43:33.640 --> 43:42.200]  system to carry out their blood thirsty enjoyment I don't know what else to say
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.120]  about that I mean that's it and this is who we face and the average good person
[43:47.120 --> 43:51.480]  can't is almost blind to this because they can't see in that spectrum of
[43:51.480 --> 43:59.520]  psychological realm and so what do you do folks I mean I was once blind to this
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.160]  you must face them you must begin to see them and once you can see them and you
[44:04.160 --> 44:07.040]  can read the writings they think you're blind because they know when you're
[44:07.040 --> 44:12.560]  fear subconsciously you are blind you choose to not see it it's right there
[44:12.560 --> 44:17.520]  though I agree it's very psychological domination and they cold-bloodedly will
[44:17.520 --> 44:22.080]  carry out their rationale to kill off humanity at the intervals they see fit
[44:22.080 --> 44:27.760]  so I'm totally frightened by this large eugenic system and as you know I've been
[44:27.760 --> 44:32.160]  reading on that for years and it's it is what you say it's it's very scary now I
[44:32.160 --> 44:37.640]  was told something by Rob Jacobson he'd never told me before and I'm glad I mean
[44:37.640 --> 44:44.200]  to hear this now if Rob interpreted this wrong tell me if I'm wrong but it's
[44:44.200 --> 44:46.960]  good to have these moments live on air together I meant to privately talk to
[44:46.960 --> 44:51.840]  you about this we don't hire people who agree with us because I found it's
[44:51.840 --> 44:55.840]  dangerous they think that it's like some Valhalla and I'm floating around and
[44:55.840 --> 45:01.200]  now this is a bunch of hard work here I don't hire people generally I had bad
[45:01.200 --> 45:06.880]  luck with people who who are quote fans I do you I normally find that those
[45:06.880 --> 45:11.640]  really aggressive types they just want to be Alex Jones and and and so I don't
[45:11.640 --> 45:15.240]  really associate with a lot of those folks I'm not saying a fan or supporter
[45:15.240 --> 45:19.680]  or someone who loves liberty is bad necessarily I mean just just statistically
[45:19.680 --> 45:25.560]  it's dangerous I hire people who will work hard and they don't have to even
[45:25.560 --> 45:28.000]  agree with me but then everybody who works here a while finds out it's much
[45:28.000 --> 45:32.680]  worse than what I'd said but but I was told that for about six months you kind
[45:32.680 --> 45:36.200]  of laughed behind the scenes and it was a little bit of a joke and you thought I
[45:36.200 --> 45:41.000]  was exaggerating but as you study more and more stuff now you then found out
[45:41.000 --> 45:45.160]  that it was actually worse than I was even saying now that's according to
[45:45.160 --> 45:49.720]  Jacobson is that true I don't know if I ever thought it was a joke totally but
[45:49.720 --> 45:54.640]  yeah I didn't fully understand the whole system and definitely when I started
[45:54.640 --> 45:58.800]  looking into eugenics in particular I realized the depths of it I think well
[45:58.800 --> 46:03.120]  that's the key to all of it but I had been reading Kurzweil and Huxley in
[46:03.120 --> 46:08.680]  1984 and all that stuff prior to being here so in some ways I was on that path
[46:08.680 --> 46:12.200]  already I don't know but I'm saying that happens a lot of people I mean they
[46:12.200 --> 46:16.360]  hear all this and it's the same thing new listeners here look I was the same
[46:16.360 --> 46:21.640]  way Aaron when I first got a really awakened to a certain degree oh now
[46:21.640 --> 46:28.520]  going back 17 18 years ago and I was about 19 I was more the Federal Reserve
[46:28.520 --> 46:31.840]  is private there is a mega elite that doesn't want a free market they want
[46:31.840 --> 46:35.560]  to shut off competition I read their own writing so I knew that was real but I'd
[46:35.560 --> 46:40.400]  hear people talk about skull and bones Bohemian Grove worshiping stone owls and
[46:40.400 --> 46:43.720]  I would tell those folks that came with me in parking lots or wrote me letters
[46:43.720 --> 46:47.640]  or you know came to events you know you're crazy but then I found that that
[46:47.640 --> 46:55.000]  was all real and and I mean it's when you discover just how crazy this is yeah
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.120]  I mean I guess where I came from I knew about stage terror actually just
[46:59.120 --> 47:03.200]  intuitively but no I didn't know about all these secret groups and they
[47:03.200 --> 47:07.480]  dominated psychologically and tell you that you're wrong to think about 911
[47:07.480 --> 47:11.200]  being an inside job or the other false flag terrors and then when you do find
[47:11.200 --> 47:14.640]  out about everything going on behind the scenes or even just a little bit of it
[47:14.640 --> 47:21.040]  is frightening and sometimes laughter is also a sign of fear actually yeah but
[47:21.040 --> 47:26.600]  then you realize that we're already in a form of psychological death and and
[47:26.600 --> 47:33.280]  physical degeneration that being accelerated by these people and so the
[47:33.280 --> 47:38.120]  true death is the death of the will to give into them and then you realize that
[47:38.120 --> 47:42.080]  that's the big trick there is no choice it's either you give up your
[47:42.080 --> 47:46.280]  individuality you give up your spirit your soul your heart to these people or
[47:46.280 --> 47:51.680]  you resist them and for me that's no choice at all and and sure they're
[47:51.680 --> 47:54.720]  scary they could come kill me and my whole family today they could set me up
[47:54.720 --> 48:01.320]  they could pull me over and throw drugs in my car but to give into that fear is
[48:01.320 --> 48:06.920]  to die it's it's the little death giving in to fear over and over again you're
[48:06.920 --> 48:13.280]  not even really alive anymore now you are being governed by by weaker instincts
[48:13.280 --> 48:17.720]  wait but I agree because this thing started so long ago before I was born
[48:17.720 --> 48:22.040]  and it's said to have already been finished like it's a done deal but what
[48:22.040 --> 48:26.480]  we do to define ourselves by taking action in the time we're at I agree I
[48:26.480 --> 48:31.480]  mean that's where life is what we choose to take action and what how we stand up
[48:31.480 --> 48:34.800]  in our time to what we can well that's their greatest assaults and one of their
[48:34.800 --> 48:38.600]  greatest lies is they tell us we don't have free will they tell us we don't have
[48:38.600 --> 48:41.760]  power they tell us we don't have determination but they know the truth
[48:41.760 --> 48:46.280]  they know how powerful the human is the human mind over a hundred and ten years
[48:46.280 --> 48:51.000]  ago Max Planck and others envisioned and wrote on shock boards equations that
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.520]  can destroy entire cities or power entire planets imagine a hundred and ten
[48:56.520 --> 48:59.720]  years later what the great thinkers have envisioned that's why the globalist
[48:59.720 --> 49:04.160]  control education they put on high-tech reservations the latest technological
[49:04.160 --> 49:09.280]  developments to hoard to themselves they know the secrets they already have
[49:09.280 --> 49:13.520]  advanced technology they don't want the general public to have to take part in
[49:13.520 --> 49:18.480]  this and they want to wall us off from it not to keep us as some little toy but
[49:18.480 --> 49:22.680]  to phase us out and that's what the average cheeseburger eating beer drinking
[49:22.680 --> 49:28.360]  tough guy out there needs to know that's what the average liberal bureaucrat needs
[49:28.360 --> 49:34.480]  know the average cop you know that's a side issue I told do and Douglas when
[49:34.480 --> 49:36.880]  they went up to the airport that the cops would come even though they were on
[49:36.880 --> 49:40.120]  public property you know on city streets that aren't on the airport and tell them
[49:40.120 --> 49:43.440]  to leave even though they have no right over the first minute to do it and at
[49:43.440 --> 49:48.440]  first the cops got their number you know ran their IDs and then said you can
[49:48.440 --> 49:52.720]  stay until more cops showed up and and of course the higher you went the more
[49:52.720 --> 49:56.240]  thuggish and they just got out and said we have the video I don't care what your
[49:56.240 --> 50:00.280]  rights are you're gonna leave or we're gonna arrest you and that's what's
[50:00.280 --> 50:04.520]  happened to you with security guards you know in places like Kansas City on a
[50:04.520 --> 50:08.960]  sidewalk federal security guards from a half mile away come up with guns and
[50:08.960 --> 50:13.000]  say you can't videotape the Federal Reserve from half a mile away and you
[50:13.000 --> 50:16.280]  guys wisely went ahead and left because when you started arguing they put their
[50:16.280 --> 50:19.320]  hands on their guns and said look and that's what tyranny is it's a little
[50:19.320 --> 50:24.240]  monkey a nobody and you have now become a slave I have become a slave when a
[50:24.240 --> 50:29.400]  monkey outside of law in a little monkey suit with their hands on their
[50:29.400 --> 50:35.400]  guns with no authority no law criminally can just boss you around that is the
[50:35.400 --> 50:40.360]  nature and the essence of it is there is their exercise of this upon us and the

[55:24.880 --> 55:29.760]  evidence there's your common sense who in your gut are you afraid of who in
[55:29.760 --> 55:34.160]  your gut are you concerned about when you see a photo of a guy with a turbine
[55:34.160 --> 55:40.560]  and a and a big beard do you have fear or when you see President Obama or

[55:57.160 --> 56:01.760]  criminals oh they're low-level minions are a bunch of useful idiots I mean
[56:01.760 --> 56:09.560]  here's an example here's an example of all the new stories today I've got one
[56:09.560 --> 56:17.960]  article out of raw story and it's linked to the AP Huffington Post others have
[56:17.960 --> 56:24.760]  got the full text of it but here it is counterterrorism expert tells cops kill
[56:24.760 --> 56:31.240]  militant Muslims including children now what now when I read something like that
[56:31.240 --> 56:35.920]  I have the whole backstory or a lot of it I remember troops coming home and
[56:35.920 --> 56:39.440]  giving interviews about how they go into whole villages in Afghanistan and
[56:39.440 --> 56:45.080]  Iraq and kill everyone including babies and in the army came out with private
[56:45.080 --> 56:48.360]  Gruckheimer in one case you can pull up at the good times they came out on
[56:48.360 --> 56:53.480]  fosters and said well let's clarify we only kill everyone in certain villages
[56:53.480 --> 56:58.600]  we only torture children in front of certain people's parents remember that
[56:58.600 --> 57:02.720]  in the Washington Post they're trying to sell you on evil all these Hollywood
[57:02.720 --> 57:07.680]  movies now where they show our troops torturing and killing people because
[57:07.680 --> 57:12.120]  they're the good guys they're trying to warp your mind to make it societally
[57:12.120 --> 57:19.960]  acceptable to have a red terror types scenario this is real but when I read
[57:19.960 --> 57:23.720]  this I understand what it is I've already known they're training the police
[57:23.720 --> 57:26.960]  with things like this they're training police in every major city that
[57:26.960 --> 57:30.720]  militias and gun owners and veterans of their number one threat and are going to
[57:30.720 --> 57:35.400]  attack them any minute that will probably happen if they start trying
[57:35.400 --> 57:39.920]  secret arrest and internment yeah patriots will start fighting they won't
[57:39.920 --> 57:44.280]  be terrorist they'll be fighting a soviet slash Nazi system and they're
[57:44.280 --> 57:49.040]  gonna be called terrorist we're trying to peacefully expose this before it gets
[57:49.040 --> 57:53.520]  to that you think the globalist care police and military if half of you get
[57:53.520 --> 57:59.520]  chewed up fighting with millions of veterans they're putting us into a
[57:59.520 --> 58:05.120]  scenario where they want to fight to chew you up to then bring in the
[58:05.120 --> 58:10.000]  international forces which is in all the documents the NLE09 the FEMA the
[58:10.000 --> 58:15.480]  drills I've been to that's phase two but when I read this I understand what it
[58:15.480 --> 58:20.040]  is they get the cops all in there they hold up the little Muslim puppet and
[58:20.040 --> 58:25.040]  say who Muslim puppet kill its babies because they know if they can train
[58:25.040 --> 58:28.240]  people think about killing people's babies they'll do anything what are the
[58:28.240 --> 58:31.600]  Nazis teach what are the black supremacists teach kill the white women
[58:31.600 --> 58:35.280]  kill the white babies kill the black babies they can get that they get anything
[58:35.280 --> 58:40.960]  then they remove the Muslim puppet and put the cowboy puppet killing killing on

[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.120]  kids by 2015 this is Cicera 2005 when they first came out with a plan five
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.960]  years ago on drugs and they're and now they want statins and lithium in the
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:20.040]  water source ABC news they're not playing games but in 1984 land they can be
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.800]  announcing they want to put drugs in the water but then when I say they're
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:28.200]  announcing and I'm still the cook to see a yuppie can't admit a threat can't
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.280]  admit we're right so they just go help put my kids on statins immediately put
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:36.600]  them on riddling immediately because if the cowards don't get into it then they
[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:40.360]  have to admit it was a bad thing so the average lackey out there just runs
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.240]  towards tyranny but their hands out drooling because they have to give into
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:49.160]  everything or admit to themselves that it's the wrong thing so see once you
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.760]  show out to evil then you've got to give in to all of it man I am wound up I am
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.400]  so fired up today your phone calls blitzkriegs of news

[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.800]  with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:08.960]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:13.280]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:17.240]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.600]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:25.960]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.720]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.840]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:37.800]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:41.600]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.320]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:50.320]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.760]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun should

[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:09.560]  yourself produced colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:12.720]  entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to

[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.360]  child to finally get through on you and I got a couple few a lot of interesting
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:44.840]  things to say my family whole family I like for instance my grandmother was

[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.720]  grandmother went through eight husbands that's besides the point my grandpa Mo
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.840]  was uh what was the secret service or something but anyways my grandfather when
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.680]  I was a child okay my last name's Ailerman it's German don't don't get me
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.680]  wrong I'm not proud no wrong it's good to be proud to be German it's gonna be
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:12.240]  proud to be Russian or Chinese the point is go ahead but what I'm saying
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:15.920]  though is my my grandfather was a Nazi okay okay okay we're proud of that I
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:20.320]  understand yeah go ahead and uh my my grandfather Mo told me when I was a
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:23.920]  child he's on the Missarvi side of the family he told me this a long time ago
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:27.400]  see I was awakened when I was a child I'm 32 a Troy we're doing phone blitzes
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.720]  today make your point quick all right he told me a long time ago that the Nazis
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:36.520]  he says he says Troy it's not over he says they'll be running almost everything
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:41.040]  in America you'll see when you get older he told me this a long time ago Alex and
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.880]  I really want to tell you I appreciate what you're doing for everybody man and
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.440]  I'm trying to get I want you to send I got some my email in there for you I
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:54.280]  want you to send me some stuff some bullet points because I'm gonna do a
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.280]  flyer thing and I'll use my own money to print it out because running around
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:03.360]  saying watch Alex Jones info wars this isn't working well enough so I'm gonna
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.620]  print out a flyer with your bullet points and let everybody read it that
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:13.960]  way I'll print up millions of them if I have to Troy God bless you and I can
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:16.720]  talk to you for 10 hours and we'll never get to the rest of the people but it's
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.800]  funny you mentioned that because one of the notes I wrote this morning was
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:26.280]  getting into the Nazis you know you got a lot of people that say the Vatican
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:29.200]  runs the whole world or the Jews run the whole world or the Masons run the
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:33.840]  whole world or space aliens run the whole world and it runs the gamut the
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:40.160]  truth is evil people and evil mafias run almost every country and quote racial
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:44.640]  or religious group that's what happens over time with entropy corruption takes
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:50.360]  hold that's why all societies and cultures fall but as long as they can
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.840]  make it about only one group is evil or another group is evil then you can
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.840]  never defeat the corruption because everybody's always saying they're good
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:03.840]  it's the other group that's bad instead of recognizing human nature people are
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:10.760]  people but on the issue of Nazis if I have time I'll bring that up with
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:15.680]  Charlotte later because it is a bullet point I want to cover because when you
[01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:19.120]  really get deep into this the Rothschilds are right up at the top of the
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.840]  New World Order they are Jewish well then why were they involved financing
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:27.360]  Hitler but then some Rothschilds never got out of France and were killed I mean
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:30.800]  it gets very it gets very strange why did our government bring tens of
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:39.160]  thousands of Nazis over and then publicize Israelis and Jewish groups
[01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:45.240]  even before Israel existed hunting down Nazis Simon Wiesenthal I mean now it's
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:48.960]  in the New York Times that the bushes were Nazis and and and the London
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.000]  Guardian that the bushes were Nazis and that the Nazis were brought over here
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:01.760]  and mass to run to not be part of to run most federal departments I mean that is
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.080]  they wouldn't be the cabinet head they would be the head of the basis the head
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:11.200]  of the projects the heads of everything why it's more than just they had brains
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.040]  which obviously they did it was German physicists that developed the plans for
[01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:21.880]  the a bomb that was then transferred to the United States before the war it's
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:26.800]  more than that the philosophy but we didn't get the philosophy of eugenics
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:33.280]  and extermination from the Germans they got it from England in the US and we
[01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.640]  got it from them it's and that's the history but I'm already digressing I
[01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:42.240]  said I take a bunch of calls and I'm not doing it I'm trying here Tim in
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.600]  Washington Tim you're on the air go ahead yeah I was going today I appreciate
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.400]  all that you're doing for everybody and I just had a quick question for you and
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.520]  I'll take it off there okay I was wondering if you were if you're
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.120]  familiar with the Aldous Huxley car in conspiracy with the subterfuge of the
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:02.960]  boomers and the 60s and I was wondering your take on that as far as it's I am
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.880]  familiar but why don't you encapsulate it for folks I'm just now learning about
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.240]  it myself if there's it's so much it's so much convoluted news or
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:15.560]  informational internet that's really hard to what do you get from it what do you
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:20.560]  get from it I think it's the one of the most ingenious plans ever divulged by a
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:27.040]  strategist and it's almost it's there it throws up huge walls as far as what
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:31.200]  people can trust and it's pretty much created this diversion of one of fire
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:36.400]  though quantify it restate it for folks because I heard heard the part about
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:42.720]  restate your full question well do you think my guess the question is is that
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:47.680]  how much of an effect you think it's having still today as far as but but
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.040]  Ben you said several things I didn't make out stated again what are you are
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:58.080]  you familiar with all the success of aquarium conspiracy with Alan Watts
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:05.680]  Timothy leary the LSD yes the British invasion the 60s revolution of free
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:10.520]  love and okay do you think that there's a way to combat that with the media
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:15.760]  campaign well look that's what I talk about a bit in this new 21 minute
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.760]  audio blog that's up on info wars.com is how they had to destroy all the other
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:25.160]  existing orders to build their new order on top of it and they had to break up
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:32.600]  the family and they had to teach people to be shallow so they never formed deep
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:38.840]  relationships and basically develop in their hierarchy of needs to being a
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:42.560]  fully developed person it's about arrested development a junior high
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:50.080]  mentality it's very very sophisticated to get into all of it but the best way to
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.480]  look at it is from a narrow spectrum looking at one small piece of it the
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:58.920]  feminist and it's all declassified it's on record she admits it Gloria Steinem
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:04.480]  was funded by the CIA to create Miss magazine they put down having children
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.720]  having families but they all themselves had children had big families you know
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.480]  they know that's what we're designed to do and how great it is they just don't
[01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:13.960]  want you to have it so you could be isolated so they the hyenas can rip your
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.800]  guts out it's kind of like meerkat manner you know the ruling meerkat group
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.760]  doesn't want your group to get together and breed and be strong and stick
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:27.080]  together they teach it's cool to fight with each other they teach it's cool to
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.400]  run off on each other to snitch to the other you know boss meerkat group so
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:35.560]  your group gets destroyed I mean it just goes into basic tribe pack
[01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:40.520]  psychology so they attack our strong tribal instincts which are a defense
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:44.160]  mechanism against their dehumanization because they fully want to take over
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.600]  human society and remake it and atomize it to it to where it's unrecognizable to
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:53.200]  where the language is destroyed or you cannot communicate with people and we're
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:58.320]  already reaching that tipping point where much of the population literally has
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:01.720]  no original thoughts in their heads and you can't communicate with them and
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.280]  they're threatened by large words they're threatened by ideas and they are
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:10.680]  destroyed but they don't count because the enemy just has armies of them we
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:18.080]  have armies of people that can think I'll take a thinker over 10 drones now the
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:23.840]  larger see I said I take a lot of calls this is a very complex issue it's
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:27.880]  totally real and it's all on record they all wrote about it it's all been
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:32.600]  implemented but the feminist situation going back to Edward Bernays the nephew
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:43.560]  of of course Sigmund Freud he worked for the Department of War before was the
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.600]  Department of Defense General Motors Ford PR he's the reason you eat bacon
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:50.800]  with eggs they they couldn't really get rid of pork bellies they had so many
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:54.200]  pork bellies because that was a part people saw as trash meat was only used
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:17:01.400]  in flavoring in stews and green beans and for for lard and things and so they
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:04.920]  had a national push there's nothing better than bacon with eggs now that
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:10.240]  overall isn't an evil thing except it shows their power they financed the
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.600]  feminist movements at the Rockefeller's financed Margaret Sanger all the big
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.640]  suffrage groups they took something that sounded reasonable that I would support
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:22.520]  women voting and and you know being part of the larger democratization of the
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:29.480]  Republic Society to a point because then the government domesticates women and
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:32.640]  uses them as an army because women generally on average are more
[01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:36.960]  conformist than men that's why Hitler said first you get the women then you
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:40.120]  have the children so follow the men Hitler mainly targeted women not the
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.360]  women are bad it's just the enemy psychologically saw this and Goebbels
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.520]  wrote about Bernays he admired much of his propaganda but hated him because he
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:54.840]  was a Jew Joseph Goebbels but he used a lot of Bernays systems as well and so
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:58.680]  Bernays simply had the big cigarette makers finance all the feminist groups
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:06.320]  gave him tons of money paid for their their bus tickets in 1920s before
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:10.760]  that their train tickets their hotels and all they had to do was smoke cigarettes
[01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:16.560]  and say show the men smoke cigarettes yeah show the men it was men that owed the
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.560]  tobacco companies so it was a big joke on women use them as a weapon to then
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.560]  destroy the family and to teach them it was cool to have birth control that it
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:30.360]  was cool to have abortions that it was fun and now just look at society who

[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:02.680]  you're on the air yes Alex yes sir bear.org that it's fairness and accuracy
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.920]  in reporting reported that in the 8th of October that Chris Matthews actually
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:12.240]  advocated for Tommy for Phil Donahue to get kicked off the air because he had
[01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:18.200]  anti-war views so Chris Matthews those is if so no no no he's a total he's a
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:22.040]  total hypocrite they do what they're told that through the Defense Department
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:27.440]  and through the Department of Labor and other agencies he is directly paid by
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.240]  the government just like Armstrong Williams Chris Matthews isn't a liberal
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:36.960]  he's not a conservative he is a government operative period it none of
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:42.880]  it's real that but to fool people it's just like in England or you'll go to
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:49.040]  tourist traps like Port Aransas Texas I found out one company owns almost every
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:53.160]  one of the big tourism things with the fake sharks out front and you know where
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:57.480]  you buy the beach towels and caps and chairs or you know shirts or bathing
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.840]  suits one company owns all the big ones and there's a few little mom and pops
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.800]  and just like in England the vast majority of people buy from two stores
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:12.280]  they're owned by the same company but but but one has a green scheme one has
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:16.440]  an orange scheme and so people think there's a choice and that's all it is
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:22.960]  with Fox News and with MSNBC but Fox News knows that you've woken people up
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.160]  I've woken people up and now if they want to stay relevant they've got to play
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:33.240]  the part of Patriots so that at the key point they can still exercise influence
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.920]  that shows how bad we're beating them do you see the beauty we got them on their
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:47.560]  heels it's time to realize it and put the spurs in anything else sir all right

[01:33:15.640 --> 01:33:20.080]  to your call Charlotte Isherby is coming up with groundbreaking sculling bones
[01:33:20.080 --> 01:33:25.200]  Intel she's agreed to have the guys come back up and interview her and get
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:36.480]  sculling bones information never before seen anyways very exciting you know the
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:40.400]  truth is ladies and gentlemen when we start to resist evil we begin to have
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:46.120]  success and we grow our liberty muscles we grow our minds and we are
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:52.360]  fulfilled it is our job to build and create and be honorable and to resist
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:57.800]  evil and sometimes be defeated by it sometimes win but it's the battle that
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:03.520]  matters it's being in the field on the field in the fight resistance is
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.600]  victory fighting back is victory knowing who the enemy is is victory and I
[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:15.720]  mean it it is so valuable to me that I am not afraid of being killed I'm not I
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:22.520]  am afraid of failing I'm afraid of being weak and human I'm afraid of the
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:28.080]  enemy lying about me and trying to destroy my name to destroy my work but
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.560]  that won't work because other people have now learned the paradigm shift
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:39.840]  information and it's loose I get a little bit of an adrenaline rush every
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:43.120]  time I think about it a lot of you out there or new listeners you get excited
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.840]  when your team wins the Super Bowl and it's down to sudden death over time and
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:51.800]  they kick that field goal with three seconds left or they run you know through
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:56.960]  and the and the running back jumps over the top and you know gets the touchdown
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:01.440]  by one inch you have that adrenaline rush that's a false adrenaline rush off
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:06.960]  of symbolic warfare but when I'm in the info war and truly defeating and having
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:13.560]  victories against the globalist it is more valuable than all the accolades all
[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.640]  the power all the women all the art all the everything means nothing compared to
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:28.560]  defending liberty feeling really good right now I'm sorry okay I got to stop
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.600]  right now because I said I was gonna take your phone calls I really should
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:39.440]  take off a week more often I'm just so recharged oh it's amazing I'm too
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:48.480]  recharged actually I I'm alive sucking in breath and I love life so much that
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.000]  I'm willing to lay down my life for others so that they can be free and so
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.440]  that evil doesn't win because I can't stand corruption and manipulators and
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.840]  liars and people that know humanity secrets and they use those secrets not
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:06.200]  to empower and build and unloose the human spirit but they use it to shudder
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:12.440]  it and to dumb it down that is such a crime against the universe a crime
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.960]  against the maker
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:22.920]  you know I don't know all of the great creators plans I don't know all the
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:27.240]  handiwork I can't even begin to imagine it but I can see what I can see and let
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.760]  me tell you something I couldn't get mad at God no matter what happened to me no
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:36.920]  matter what comes because I know it's all part of the plan and that is a great
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:41.360]  feeling it's the best feeling in the world and again I'm not on some high
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.920]  horse telling you I'm pious or I'm good or I got all the answers I'm just telling
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:51.360]  you I'm tuned in to love I'm tuned into light I'm tuned in to decency I'm tuned

[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:02.520]  just flows and flows and never stops and it is good and one drink out of this
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:07.680]  one drink out of this well ladies and gentlemen if you ever really peer into
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:13.360]  the universe into infinity if you ever get outside this controlled matrix false
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:23.960]  grid and tap in to just one sliver one micron of our destiny you won't have
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:28.080]  fear anymore you won't have fear of the New World Order you'll have fear of God
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:38.680]  but it's not fear like I'm scared it's fear of not fulfilling your mission
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:49.640]  all right I want to get into some financial news than your calls ex-shell

[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:06.880]  it measures long-term unemployment well they've done that decades ago under the
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:10.000]  old calculations and we've had top economists from the government
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:14.560]  previously in the government number two under Reagan and others countless
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:21.320]  Nobel Prize winners telling you that people like what's his name who's the
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.800]  Nobel Prize winner that we've had on bunch who quit the World Bank right when
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:30.680]  all those documents got leaked Joseph Sticklets that's a memory trick if you
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.480]  can't remember the name of the person you just remember the information they put
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:40.560]  up that it's been about 22% for about three years and now it's about 23 and a
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.960]  half the TV tells you it's 9.8 though something must be true now they're
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:50.320]  changing it again to further cover up the unemployment but USA Today tells you
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:55.520]  they're changing it to give you a more accurate number they're gonna
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:40:02.200]  intensify the lies and they tell you that it's to stop the line lies within
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:07.480]  lies within lies within lies within lies within lies within lies within lies
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:13.360]  within lies within lies when the truth is just so much easier oh it looks
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.640]  harder the world tries to tell you what the truth is harder but no it's just
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.040]  better to surrender to the truth and to begin seeking it and by degree learning
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:28.960]  more of it new global banking rules proposed on bankers pay and the UN and
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.440]  other global organizations are proposing it this is the shareholders of the big
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.880]  banks want to set caps on pay and scapegoat the CEOs who are horrible
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:46.480]  scallywags but but that's a diversion AP non-US banks gained from Fed's crisis
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:54.520]  fund more money and QE2 and now QE3 pumping out FT and a bunch of other
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.200]  news here price of silver soaring Wall Street Journal it's almost doubled in
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.560]  the last year unexpected surge was unexpected for us because we're not
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.200]  living in La La land an unexpected surge in investor demand is sending
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.440]  silver prices soaring and speculators and mining companies are digging in the
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.040]  past four months the metal has upended forecast not our forecast and up into
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:24.360]  ours rising 51% I'm sorry I said almost to a series of 30 year highs before
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:34.520]  inflation silver closed Thursday to 2931 and continues it's up even more today
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:40.600]  this is from gold continues gains amid thin trading on weak dollar that's out
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:49.200]  of the Times we've got a bunch of other news articles here dealing with that
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:57.480]  there's also another article here by a well-meaning person saying watch the
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:02.040]  other guys closing credits explaining economic collapse and it goes into how
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:08.000]  the Will Ferrell movie is so good at the end it tells you who to blame it's
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.440]  about bankers robbing people but at the end it explains that the top 2% are
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.720]  making too much money and that the answer is basically collectivism which is
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:23.640]  what the mega ultra less than one one thousand now 300 million people you're
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:28.200]  talking maybe a couple hundred super class they want to shut down somebody
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.080]  making a million bucks a year this movie will Ferrell tells you go go have the
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:36.360]  government rob the guy making a million a year when it's the guy making a
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:41.920]  million a year that all the studies show employs most people not the mega rich so
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.080]  see the mega rich are gonna scapegoat the giant horde of people losing their
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.320]  jobs losing their welfare losing their unemployment benefits on people making
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:58.120]  200,000 300,000 a million five million a year and just watch for all those people
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:01.240]  out there who buy into this your life's not gonna get better when they shut down
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:05.640]  the middle class sure if somebody had a million bucks 200 years ago they were
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.880]  rich if they had a million bucks a hundred years ago they were wealthy a
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:13.720]  million dollars if you do the numbers to 1960s numbers is about the equivalent of
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.440]  having a hundred thousand dollars in the bank is somebody with a hundred
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:22.240]  thousand dollars rich no I mean in most big cities you can't buy a four five
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:25.960]  bedroom house in a decent neighborhood for less than a million is that a rich
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:29.920]  person somebody with a million dollars in the 60s would probably have six or
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:35.320]  seven houses and huge companies it's all made up but now they have little
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:40.120]  Hollywood messages at the end you're in the credits saying rich people making
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:46.640]  hundreds of thousands they're your enemy get them and the average person says oh
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:57.280]  isn't that good of Hollywood they're telling me who the bad man is hmm okay I
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:44:01.880]  said I'd get to your calls but a Ted is out of town today and I do want to
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:05.320]  encourage people to take advantage of minus resources deals I believe in these
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:09.560]  deals these are smoking hot these are incredibly good deals their regular
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:14.200]  prices are excellent these special loss leaders are smoking I mean look at this
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:25.280]  one three silver dollars for ninety two dollars but all they've done is is is
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:28.280]  changed the wording here Ted always says it verbally different this is the
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:33.200]  internal printout of the special but I can tell you the brokers don't particularly
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:36.200]  like these because they're pre-market folks they want to make a little money
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:40.080]  they make nothing on these but they're there to take your order for these silver
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:45.080]  dollar offer Obama deception fall the Republic in game with three silver
[01:44:45.080 --> 01:44:48.920]  dollars for ninety two dollars five dollar shipping and handling before it
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:51.400]  was ninety eight dollars free shipping and handling it's the same thing that's
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:56.920]  just factored in there ninety two dollars five dollar shipping a total of ninety
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:02.840]  seven dollars credit cards expected see I'm reading their internal thing here
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:09.360]  limit one per customer hey what is that it's not limit one per customer don't
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:12.280]  even run the brokers are great folks but I mean who can blame them I mean they
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:17.080]  they get nothing when they do these orders you get nothing I like it the
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:20.480]  point is that's a loss leader silver ride up at thirty dollars an ounce right
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:26.160]  now I mean do do the math you're getting it at spot and three films valued
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.400]  sixty dollars for ninety seven dollars so it's about a hundred and sixty dollar
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:33.760]  value for ninety seven keep doing I mean do the math right there and that's how
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:38.720]  you fund us but you really don't doing this this is Ted's crazy loss leader

[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:32.240]  story this is a story I I did how do I say this I did some business with the
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:40.080]  United States and I transferred the money with Western Union you heard me yes
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:50.120]  sir oh and I did that for many years on the one day comes a telephone from the
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:58.120]  Swiss Western Union office and said you cannot send any more money the money you
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:05.960]  sent that is not that they cannot pick it up she is not allowed to get the money
[01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:16.080]  on the I you have to pick up the money back in your Western Union office and so
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:23.040]  I called where Western Union the main office in Switzerland on I said what is
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:34.200]  going on they said well homeland security has you on the list and I financing a
[01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:38.520]  bomb and again this is happening everywhere millions of people on the
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:42.520]  list and now they're saying this woman that wouldn't let them grab her breast
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:47.680]  she can't fly anymore and she's banned from the airport now they're on the

[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:12.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:22.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:34.560]  well I give myself an A and an A plus getting a lot of calls last hour probably got to 10 or so but or more but I want to go to Leo Terany everybody else that's holding in 30 seconds
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:42.560]  Robert and Switzerland finishing up how does the story end what you with you trying to send money through Western Union
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:52.560]  Robert and Switzerland you still there buddy yeah he's gone he misunderstood that I was gonna hold him over let's talk to Leo and mass thanks for holding Leo you're on the air
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:01:08.560]  hi yeah you know you're talking about I've been a subscriber for a while you're talking about this surveillance state going up let's have our own version of it I asked you to do a video game and where people would be going around finding these things and trashing them
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:13.560]  and I think it should be localized to each different area so you could
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:26.560]  Oh we can't call for anything illegal here it'd be terrible that people all over the country like they did in Arizona this year attacked all the red light cameras and the state capitulated and pulled them all out because the people were unstoppable
[02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:37.560]  I mean it'd be terrible if people actually exercised their power against Terany like the founding fathers did that is a horrible thing you're calling for that type of civil disobedience that's just horrible Leo
[02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:48.560]  yeah well see it's a winner for us and wearing getting people to be aware of where they are so if people could turn in these things to the video game company and then people would know where they are locally
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:02:04.560]  well if you did something like that you couldn't have a central system ideas are bulletproof not central command centers ok and but it is terrible though to I mean that's stuff like the founding fathers did I mean you don't you don't go out to
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:19.560]  all these surveillance systems that they lied about and several for traffic and now they admit her homeland security I mean you don't do that or one of the CIA agents might might you know might not get caught when they're setting off a bomb I mean one of the Muslims
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:31.560]  I mean this is horrible what you're calling for Leo they're terrorists out there that want to get us never mind the government you know thousands of secret tests murdering people that are now declassified let's let's trust them
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:41.560]  you know the government's good we need to have more surveillance course all of the surveillance is illegal all of the wireless in fact I've got a big folder today
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:57.560]  where like here it is smartphone spying on you Forbes Apple hit with two federal lawsuits over tracking iPhone and iPad users is Google Android next Apple suit over applications giving information to advertisers that's all uncivil and illegal
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:06.560]  people go to jail for reading their neighbor's email but when the government does it it's illegal but they don't get in trouble so how dare you try to stop crime on your own
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:17.560]  what a sicko Leo don't recall here again what what no you're you're the da evil evil tyranny rival in California on the air I hope you're not as founding father issues Leo
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:33.560]  no hey thanks for taking my call I'm glad to speak with you let with you and your team are doing in a week for probably like seven eight months now but I just want to get out there how is it possible for
[02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:48.560]  like Charles Manson to basically brainwash and get people to do what he wanted to do when our government is selling death and eugenics to propaganda and all that other crap but
[02:03:48.560 --> 02:04:02.560]  well I mean number one and I don't have an hour to get into it Charles Manson was a front fall guy they scrambled his brain after it's a hundred percent that that was a CIA brainwashing operation to kind of officially in the
[02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:14.560]  sixties culture and then moving to a new phase that that was a hundred percent theatrical production Sharon Tate was not killed by those lunatics and I mean the whole thing was a production
[02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:21.560]  okay I mean I mean I mean you know he hung out with all of the most powerful people out there I mean it was totally staged
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:32.560]  well it's all inside job totally staged absolute absolutely it would take hours it's ridiculous how much evidence there is
[02:04:32.560 --> 02:04:48.560]  okay last thing was last month you did a quick pyramid scheme about because Beck was saying George Soros was on top of the pyramid I liked how that was a little educational thing is it possible you could do more little things like that
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:58.560]  yes yes I've got two graphics guys working on a whole pyramid presentation of the upcoming film to explain different pyramidal power structures we're absolutely on it well done we'll be right back with Charlotte

[02:05:09.560 --> 02:05:20.560]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:29.560]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:36.560]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:44.560]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science

[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:31.560]  Charlotte can talk about a lot of issues and we'll go to them quickly towards the end
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:34.560]  but Charlotte is or be doesn't like to brag about herself
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:39.560]  but she was the head of policy department of education under Reagan the number two position
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:43.560]  her father and grandfather were skull and bones her father Bohemian Grove
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:48.560]  she is the lady decades ago that blew skull and bones wide open
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.560]  the mainstream media denied that anything was even going on up until she leaked Sutton the info
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:58.560]  now that was not known for a long time who did it because her father was still alive
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:03.560]  I want this history now that it can be talked about to be discussed first
[02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:08.560]  and she'll tell you well read Sutton's book or read Chris Milligan's excellent fleshing out skull and bones
[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:14.560]  recent to see their deep research and overall bringing the info together
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:22.560]  but she was a skull and bones East Coast family and she's got many documents never before seen
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.560]  my guys were able to see them when they were up there three weeks ago
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.560]  and so she's agreed we appreciate it because I sent them up there about the department of education
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:34.560]  brainwashing program and then I knew she had broken this info
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.560]  she was a computer separately you know briefly on this issue as part of other interviews
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:43.560]  I wanted to get her on today and you know she was telling me during the break
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:47.560]  getting her on well Alex you know the stuff's out there it's on my website
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:52.560]  I know but not the specifics of the family and how it works you know we see films like
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:57.560]  The Good Shepherd directed by Robert De Niro with Matt Damon that the media held is very accurate
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:03.560]  I don't know if it's accurate from what she's seen I mean it's got the guide rest up as the devil as a king
[02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:08.560]  the devil's and that's reportedly accurate the New York Observer got some of the devil's equal death
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:12.560]  and all that stuff on video on the outside courtyard of the tomb
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:21.560]  but I specifically you know wanted her to just get into some of the other areas like in that film
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:29.560]  and also some of the reports that there's skull and bones families and that sometimes you know the wives get inducted in as well
[02:10:29.560 --> 02:10:34.560]  so I wanted to talk to Charlotte about that because this is important historical information
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:40.560]  skull and bones is one of the most powerful ruling class groups where a whole bunch of presidents CIA directors
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:46.560]  secretaries of state you name it come from and so Charlotte joins us for the next 40 minutes or so
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:49.560]  we'll talk about this and then we'll get to those calls as I promised to
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:55.560]  but Charlotte the author of deliberate dumbing down of America which was now gone out of print
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:01.560]  now joins us here today but you can still read the free digital copy at her website
[02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:04.560]  we'll tell you how to do that as well she's a great humanitarian
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:06.560]  Charlotte great to have you here with us today
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:12.560]  good afternoon Alex and I hope I can live up to your expectations
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:17.560]  oh I'm sure you can believe me I've seen the footage the guy shot of the documents
[02:11:17.560 --> 02:11:21.560]  now Charlotte let's go back to the beginning and start with Anthony Sutton
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  then we'll get into your family and your gracious to talk about this until some of it's painful
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:29.560]  you know to go back and remember your father's death when you were caring for him and other things
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:35.560]  but let's discuss how you got it to Sutton why it couldn't be known at the time
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:40.560]  what his book on skull and bones and the secret establishment covered
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:48.560]  well he was a remarkable person and I think that for those who haven't you know heard
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:54.560]  Sutton's background was very very establishment up until the time that
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:12:01.560]  he stumbled over the establishment right and you know he was educated at
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:05.560]  the University of London got into good in California is English
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:10.560]  and while a research fellow at the prestigious Hoover Institute he produced the monumental
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:15.560]  three-value series Western technology and Soviet economic development
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:19.560]  and other books in the world were the best enemy money come by
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:24.560]  Wall Street in the Bolshevik Revolution Wall Street and Hitler and others
[02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:32.560]  and so what happened was I am the daughter and granddaughter of skull members of skull and bones
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:39.560]  we go into a little bit later on that but I think that I had been in touch with Sutton
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:45.560]  in the early 80s in regard to United States policy towards the Soviet Union
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:53.560]  always bothered me that I couldn't I mean honestly if you really want me to say something
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:59.560]  that's going to get you famous for the rest of time Alex for having a number one
[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:06.560]  coupon on your program I have been coming to this conclusion ever since I came back
[02:13:06.560 --> 02:13:11.560]  from overseas and worked in Soviet affairs to the Department of State
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:16.560]  I don't think there ever was a cold war I mean I don't think there ever was a problem
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:21.560]  between United States and Soviet Union they can call it cold war because it wasn't hot
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:24.560]  but that's not kooky that's actually come out in documents
[02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.560]  well yeah I know and I've always felt that way but I think
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:32.560]  no but they love McCarthy I mean the Russians have now released the documents
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:37.560]  New York Times headline McCarthy was right it turned out but they liked him
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:42.560]  just interrupting talking about Communists as long as it was file clerks
[02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:45.560]  so they could have a police state in the name of countering the Soviets
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:51.560]  and build us into the authoritarian system but as soon as he said the army is running
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:55.560]  the Communist boom it was over for him because he found out the truth sorry go ahead
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:14:02.560]  yeah no that's true and I think though that starting with all of his extraordinary research on
[02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:08.560]  giving aid to the Soviet Union I mean we were making it possible for the development of their country
[02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:10.560]  technologically and militarily
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:13.560]  gave him the nukes and then executed the Rosenbergs
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:20.560]  and then also you know I ran into the Marburg book which is really my favorite book
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:25.560]  my favorite book Charlotte's favorite book she has thousands of books
[02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:32.560]  is by George Racy Jordan from Nature Jordan's Diaries
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:38.560]  now I would say that and Sutton and a few of the other books that your guys took pictures of
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:44.560]  that book too you know that really was definitely important in bringing me to the
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:46.560]  conclusion that there never was a Cold War
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:50.560]  they had to bring the wall the wall had funny wall had to come down and all that
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:54.560]  and it did and and all of this had been in secret papers predicted
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:58.560]  that all of this was necessary for the merger to take place
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.560]  yeah the Carnegie's wrote about that in the 20s
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:06.560]  absolutely so anyway so Sutton must have called me
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:13.560]  and he I guess I mentioned to him because I was staying out of the house
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:16.560]  I was taking care of my father in New Jersey
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:25.560]  and I think I probably said you know have you checked on on the order at Yale
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:31.560]  and he said well yeah he had and he was very very interested in what do you know
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:36.560]  and I told him that you know my father and grandfather were members of the order
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:41.560]  I have to point out that my father really had absolutely zero less than zero to do with
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:45.560]  the policies of the order which have brought us to where we are right now
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:49.560]  my dad was the great constitutionalist wonderful man
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:54.560]  I can't think of I could go on forever talking about him
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:16:01.560]  and he was beloved by everybody from the garbage man to the top people in the corporations
[02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:05.560]  and that's why it was his daughter that blew him wide open
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:08.560]  and well he did not know that
[02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.560]  no I know but it just shows the bloodline
[02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:13.560]  but what he did do
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:18.560]  so I'll mention this first because
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:24.560]  I was at that point working with Phyllis Schlafly putting together
[02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:28.560]  the book Child Abuse in the classroom that's quite a marvelous book folks
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:33.560]  and it is at Samuel's website it's free you can read it
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:39.560]  so it's all the documentation on the hearings we had in the early 80s which I was instrumental in
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:45.560]  on what they're doing to our children that the destruction of our children's morals and values
[02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:49.560]  so anyway Phyllis and I were talking about putting that book of hers together
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:52.560]  in order for her to sell it at the republican convention
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:54.560]  coming up in what's 84 I guess
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:59.560]  and my father was dying of cancer
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:04.560]  and we put a little room off of the kitchen for him at home
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:08.560]  so that he didn't have to go up and down stairs and we'd be close to him
[02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:13.560]  so we had to listen to all this mouse out of his daughter Charlotte
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:16.560]  and talking on the phone with people like Phyllis
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:23.560]  and so he heard all about globalism and all these dreadful programs in those schools
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:27.560]  so about a week before he died
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:31.560]  he looked at me and he said Char
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:36.560]  if I had longer I'd help you
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:39.560]  so really something remarkable happened there
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:43.560]  I think he was Phyllis and I or myself or whatever we brainwashed
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:46.560]  we deprogrammed him
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:51.560]  but anyway it was during that period that Sutton found out about
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:54.560]  the books arrived in the mail one day three of them
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:57.560]  the membership list
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:18:00.560]  so I was taking care of my father's mail
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:03.560]  and I opened them up and I looked at them
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:05.560]  and let me point out at this point
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.560]  I knew nothing about skull and bones
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:09.560]  I knew nothing about what they did
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:12.560]  all I knew was we had a great big grandfather clock
[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:16.560]  that my father had always said don't ever let it wind down
[02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:19.560]  my son Sam says he knows why that is
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:23.560]  because evidently there's some sort of mysterious reason
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:27.560]  for that because I guess they're never meant to wind down
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:30.560]  so that always was funny about that
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:32.560]  do not let that clock wind down you've got to keep it going
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:35.560]  so anyway that's all I knew
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:37.560]  and a few other things I can tell you about too
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:40.560]  but I wasn't done
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.560]  so when I saw the list
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:44.560]  I thought well I've never seen these before
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:48.560]  so there were three books that with the present membership
[02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.560]  the past membership is something at all
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:54.560]  all members from the beginning all mixed up
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:57.560]  and so I took them into my father and he said
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:19:00.560]  oh gee he said I've never seen that before
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:03.560]  he said they never put the list in books
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:06.560]  okay well so I let him look at it
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:09.560]  and then I took them back and then I talked to Tony Sutton
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:12.560]  and he said Charles would you lend them to me
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:14.560]  and I said well I don't know why not
[02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:16.560]  as long as you get them back to me
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:19.560]  as soon as you can I said I feel a little bit like a traitor
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:22.560]  but I feel it's important for you to have them
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:25.560]  so anyway I sent them to him
[02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:28.560]  and he called me a couple of days later
[02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:32.560]  and he said this is the most remarkable experience
[02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:33.560]  I've ever had
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.560]  he said I've been trying to figure this thing out
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.560]  for a long time and you're not kidding
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:40.560]  he had a lot of volumes that he was doing for Hoover
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:44.560]  and I just have never really been able to
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:47.560]  you know pinpoint
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:51.560]  where does this support for working with the Soviets
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:54.560]  and bringing this country down come from
[02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:55.560]  stay there when I write back
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:56.560]  Charlotte is or be
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:00.560]  they must destroy the Republic to build their system
[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:02.560]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:05.560]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:07.560]  number one new climate legislation
[02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:09.560]  could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:11.560]  number two our new energies are
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:13.560]  wants to control how much power
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.560]  your electric company allows you to have
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:18.560]  it's true total government control of electricity
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:20.560]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:20:20.560 --> 02:20:23.560]  number three in some areas of the country
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:25.560]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:27.560]  and now new socialist legislation
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:29.560]  is only compounding the problem
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:31.560]  number four dangerous weather is always
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:32.560]  a threat to local grids
[02:20:32.560 --> 02:20:34.560]  every year thousands of families
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.560]  lose their power from weather related onages
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:38.560]  number five a solar power generator
[02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:40.560]  provides powerful backup insurance
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.560]  and peace of mind folks I really believe
[02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:44.560]  in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:46.560]  from science one of my oldest sponsors

[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:05.560]  are we going to see economic growth slide
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:07.560]  into a recession or at worst depression
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:09.560]  hi Ted Anderson from Midas Resources
[02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:12.560]  we all know when a company acts irresponsibly
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:14.560]  divesting ourselves in a move towards safety
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:16.560]  is prudent when the market becomes volatile
[02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:18.560]  US Treasuries are a safe haven
[02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:20.560]  but what do you do when the US government
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:23.560]  overextends itself and spends beyond its means
[02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.560]  many investors are turning toward gold
[02:21:25.560 --> 02:21:28.560]  as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments
[02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:31.560]  Midas Resources has put together a powerful book
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:33.560]  titled 10 reasons to own gold
[02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:35.560]  discussing costs, benefits, risks
[02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:38.560]  featuring full color illustrations, weights and measures

[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:48.560]  discover how gold may be right for you
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:50.560]  and your IRA by calling

[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:56.560]  the book is free

[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:02.560]  they helped to create a new world order
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.560]  we are part of a new world order
[02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:07.560]  a new world order based upon collective action
[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:10.560]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists
[02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.560]  through their own words and documents
[02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:14.560]  the new world order really is a tool
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:17.560]  for addressing a new world of possibilities
[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:19.560]  it means all the world under their control
[02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:22.560]  the United Nations would take over America
[02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:25.560]  the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world
[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:28.560]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence
[02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:30.560]  have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:33.560]  to establish an oppressive world government
[02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:36.560]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:39.560]  of a world constitution for the global financial system
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:41.560]  global governance with the establishment of a G20
[02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:44.560]  so it's going to be an inner ruling elite
[02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:45.560]  and then everyone else
[02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:47.560]  and I got news for you, you're everyone else

[02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:14.560]  using low doses to greatly reduce the number
[02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:16.560]  severity and duration of common colds
[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:20.560]  Alley C contains 300 milligrams of stabilized allicin
[02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:22.560]  the active ingredient in crushed garlic
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:24.560]  Studies show Alley C is effective against
[02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:27.560]  MRSA, bacterial, fungal and viral infections
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:29.560]  one tablet of Alley C has the equivalent
[02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:31.560]  of 40 cloves of garlic

[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:20.560]  Aaron Dykes during the break ran and said
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:22.560]  yeah I was reading Sutton's book
[02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:24.560]  and then I looked at it online
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:26.560]  the Brown Brother Harriman's building
[02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:27.560]  which also funded Hitler
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:29.560]  and here in the U.S. it surrounded all
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:31.560]  the Russian embassies and government facilities
[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:33.560]  and that's because the Russians
[02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:35.560]  this was admitted at the time
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:39.560]  were funded by the United States
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:41.560]  during Stalin's time
[02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:43.560]  now Hitler was a little different
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:45.560]  they funded him, told him he was going to have
[02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:47.560]  western support to invade other countries
[02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:49.560]  then set him up and brought him down
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:52.560]  but the Russian system is definitely a staged event
[02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:55.560]  in the 1880s and 90s, probably still staged
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:58.560]  but you were getting into Anthony Sutton
[02:24:58.560 --> 02:25:00.560]  Charlotte Isherby
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:02.560]  once he got the skull and bones
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.560]  membership list from you
[02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:06.560]  the official internal list
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:08.560]  he said he was blown away, please continue
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:10.560]  Yeah, he, well he just said
[02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:12.560]  he went and had copies made
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:14.560]  you know kinkos or something
[02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:16.560]  and then he put it all out on the dining room table
[02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.560]  and he looked and he said it was the first time
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:21.560]  that he understood completely
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:23.560]  what it happened
[02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:25.560]  and that this was the entity
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:27.560]  whatever you want to call it
[02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:30.560]  the organization, the order of the fraternity
[02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:33.560]  the whatever that was responsible
[02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:36.560]  for the direction
[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:39.560]  that our country was moving in militarily
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:41.560]  a corporate was and education
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:43.560]  he saw it
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:45.560]  and so he was thrilled
[02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:47.560]  and actually I have to give Tony credit
[02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:49.560]  for not blowing the whistle
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.560]  I didn't ask him not to
[02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:53.560]  he just felt that
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:55.560]  it wasn't right for him to identify me
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:57.560]  you know, my dad was
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:59.560]  by that time he was gone
[02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.560]  so I had no problem
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.560]  with that
[02:26:03.560 --> 02:26:05.560]  but Tony just felt that
[02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:07.560]  it wasn't right and I appreciated that
[02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:09.560]  so anyway
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.560]  it was very sad that he passed away
[02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:13.560]  by the way
[02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.560]  and I've always wondered about that
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:17.560]  he was a real gentleman, I tried to interview him
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:19.560]  I interviewed him once
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:21.560]  and I tried to interview him a few years later
[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:23.560]  I guess back in 1999 and he sent me
[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.560]  it was like one week before he died
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:27.560]  because I remember hearing like two weeks later
[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:29.560]  he just died and I got a kind email saying
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:31.560]  I appreciate your work Mr. Jones
[02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:33.560]  I'd love to come on, I'm too ill
[02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:35.560]  and then he dies a week later
[02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:37.560]  I mean that's a classy guy
[02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:39.560]  well I don't even know that he was that ill
[02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.560]  I think he was ill, he had something wrong
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:43.560]  with you know that inner ear business
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:45.560]  yeah
[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:47.560]  that's why I couldn't meet with him
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:49.560]  way back then
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:51.560]  I wanted to meet with him when I was in California
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:53.560]  and he couldn't because of that
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:55.560]  but he told me
[02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:57.560]  he said, other than that Charlotte, I'm fine
[02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:59.560]  and so
[02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:01.560]  I was, I believe
[02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:03.560]  you know, let's talk, we're really getting into
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:05.560]  conspiracy stuff here
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:07.560]  I don't know why Anthony
[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:09.560]  died, I have no idea
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:11.560]  well I mean of course anybody can die
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:13.560]  he could have had a heart attack
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:15.560]  I did talk to someone who was very close to him
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:17.560]  and
[02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:19.560]  the feeling I got
[02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:21.560]  was that it was not
[02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.560]  there were
[02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:25.560]  definitely questions about Anthony's
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:27.560]  pasting
[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:29.560]  I may have talked to him right after he'd been poisoned
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:31.560]  then because he said I'm not feeling well, I can't
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:33.560]  come on
[02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:35.560]  he was literally
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:37.560]  it was weird, it was like
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:39.560]  that with
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:41.560]  Gary Webb who wrote the
[02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:43.560]  New York Alliance series about the CIA
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:45.560]  drug dealing
[02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:47.560]  he sent me this disc
[02:27:47.560 --> 02:27:49.560]  that was all his material and said you have a website
[02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:51.560]  put it up and then he called back six months later
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.560]  and he said you never put it up and I said
[02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:55.560]  this is like a 98 or something and I said well I'm not very technical
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:57.560]  I'm going to try
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:59.560]  and we barely had info wars up
[02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.560]  working well then
[02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:03.560]  and then I called him back
[02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:05.560]  we had put up a lot of it and he said
[02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:07.560]  I'm not ready to come on yet, this is a few years later
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:09.560]  he said I'm writing the book though
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:11.560]  it's going to blow him out of the water
[02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:13.560]  he was about to come out with that book when they shot him twice
[02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.560]  in the head
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:17.560]  well they don't have any problem doing these things
[02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:19.560]  as most of your
[02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:21.560]  your listeners know
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.560]  you know the wonderful
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:25.560]  the
[02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.560]  transcript of the
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:29.560]  the Reese committee hearing, the 3000 pages
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:31.560]  that we have up on
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:33.560]  Samo's website that's the investigation
[02:28:33.560 --> 02:28:35.560]  of the tax exempt foundation
[02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:37.560]  1953
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:39.560]  and I understand from
[02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:41.560]  I think Stan Monteith
[02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:43.560]  I found out from Bob Goldsboro
[02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:45.560]  I bought the copy of it from
[02:28:45.560 --> 02:28:47.560]  Robert Goldsboro
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:49.560]  but I didn't pay
[02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.560]  I paid $3,000 for it
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:53.560]  but I understand that
[02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:55.560]  Goldsboro was offered
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:57.560]  any amount of money
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:59.560]  to get that one copy
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:01.560]  this is a foundation
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:03.560]  one of the minions said
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:05.560]  we will pay you anything you want
[02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:07.560]  and
[02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:09.560]  Goldsboro said no good for him right
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:11.560]  and then about
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:13.560]  15 years later I knew
[02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:15.560]  Goldsboro well
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:17.560]  I said you know Bob really
[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:19.560]  I mean you're just sitting with that thing
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:21.560]  we want to put it up on the internet
[02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:23.560]  so he sold it to me
[02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:25.560]  for very little basically huh
[02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:27.560]  so the point is this
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:29.560]  that these people really mean business
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.560]  I mean when they're willing to pay anything
[02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:33.560]  for 3000 pages of congressional testimony
[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:35.560]  because of course after the hearings
[02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:37.560]  were shut down they went around the country
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:39.560]  and bought up all the
[02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:41.560]  all the copies that were in the library
[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:43.560]  so anyway
[02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:45.560]  let's continue with Scull and Bones
[02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:47.560]  one of the key globalist organizations
[02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:49.560]  and what their master plan is
[02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:51.560]  more about your family Aaron's got some questions as well

[02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:33.560]  recently he created a video

[02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:14.560]  here you were getting into
[02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:16.560]  what antony sutton had discovered
[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:18.560]  what skull and bones is
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:20.560]  what their master plan is
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:22.560]  how they build up the muslim enemy that
[02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:24.560]  they really secretly control from the top
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:26.560]  the low levels don't know it
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:28.560]  they create the nazi threat
[02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:30.560]  by funding it they create the soviet
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:32.560]  which is on record now
[02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:34.560]  they create the fake global
[02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:36.560]  warming which is just made up to sell
[02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:38.560]  their takeover they claim
[02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:40.560]  they're fixing education when really they're trying to destroy it
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:42.560]  i mean they are the masters
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:44.560]  of this gaelian dialectic
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:46.560]  and what is in these documents
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:48.560]  and what has been discovered is
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:50.560]  german sciences of brainwashing
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:52.560]  as you know
[02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:54.560]  to create hessian brainwashed
[02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:56.560]  soldiers for sale worldwide
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:58.560]  that technology
[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:00.560]  spread through skull and bones i mean
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:02.560]  quantify what skull and bones is
[02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:04.560]  from your deep research and what sutton
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:06.560]  discovered that erin's got some points
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.560]  well the order
[02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:10.560]  i do believe that it is
[02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:12.560]  connected with the illuminati
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:14.560]  and there is some
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:16.560]  pretty sound research that connects them
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:18.560]  it is a german order
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:20.560]  there is no question about that
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:22.560]  i know that
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:24.560]  and uh...
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:26.560]  it's the elite everybody knows
[02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:28.560]  a lot of this stuff
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:30.560]  the elite how many families
[02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:32.560]  200 families or whatever
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:34.560]  more perhaps
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:36.560]  in the country you have enough money and have been very
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:38.560]  carefully educated
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:40.560]  whether there are bones
[02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:42.560]  or even some other fraternities
[02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:44.560]  that are close to bones
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:46.560]  but i think one of the best quotes
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:48.560]  is a very simple writing
[02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:50.560]  that could be
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:52.560]  book cover on two thousandth book
[02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:54.560]  and the reason i like it
[02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:56.560]  is because
[02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:58.560]  the guy that they were talking about
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:00.560]  e.o. mathison
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:02.560]  who was skull and bones 1923
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:04.560]  with a friend of my father's
[02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:06.560]  i don't think they were very good friends
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:08.560]  because my father wasn't deeply involved
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:10.560]  but my father knew him and had mentioned him
[02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:12.560]  this is what is right on the cover of the book
[02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:14.560]  it says quote
[02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:16.560]  e.o. mathison
[02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:18.560]  skull and bones 1923
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:20.560]  to donald ogden steward
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:22.560]  uh...
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:24.560]  an earlier skull and bones year 1916
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:26.560]  about mathison
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:28.560]  maddie they called him
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:30.560]  upcoming appearance
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:32.560]  before the house committee on unamerican activities
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:34.560]  so
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:36.560]  that's a fascinating quote
[02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:38.560]  as long as we have somebody
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:40.560]  from bones
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:42.560]  who can bring pressure on the committee
[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:44.560]  i should think we'd be alright
[02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:46.560]  now that tells you the power
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:48.560]  of someone from bones
[02:38:48.560 --> 02:38:50.560]  now that's mathison talking
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:52.560]  to another bones character
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:54.560]  and i knew
[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:56.560]  mathison's daughter
[02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:58.560]  she lived in camden when i was on the local school board
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:00.560]  going up against all these
[02:39:00.560 --> 02:39:02.560]  guys destroying programs
[02:39:02.560 --> 02:39:04.560]  and she was from the
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:06.560]  a very elite lady
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:08.560]  and she was the
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:10.560]  daughter of mathison
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:12.560]  and i went to a party
[02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:14.560]  a christmas party one one evening
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:16.560]  and of course everybody was beating up on me then
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:18.560]  because i
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:20.560]  i supported grammar things like that
[02:39:20.560 --> 02:39:22.560]  and i didn't like values destroying programs
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:24.560]  but she cornered me
[02:39:24.560 --> 02:39:26.560]  at this christmas party
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:28.560]  and really beat up on me
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:30.560]  about my opposition
[02:39:30.560 --> 02:39:32.560]  to what was going on in the schools
[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:34.560]  i was on the school board
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:36.560]  and i was so upset that i started to cry
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:38.560]  i really
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:40.560]  i really because it was in public
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:42.560]  that she was doing that
[02:39:42.560 --> 02:39:44.560]  and so i just put my coat on
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:46.560]  it was a snowy night the moon was out
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:48.560]  and all and i walked home
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:50.560]  and i never forgot
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:39:52.560]  that because that was a daughter
[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:54.560]  of an important
[02:39:54.560 --> 02:39:56.560]  person in the order that's the one that they just
[02:39:56.560 --> 02:39:58.560]  but i just quoted
[02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:00.560]  so she fell for all
[02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:02.560]  the garbage i didn't
[02:40:02.560 --> 02:40:04.560]  although my father was never
[02:40:04.560 --> 02:40:06.560]  like him and my dad would never have
[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:08.560]  been involved in
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:10.560]  in hearing in congress
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:12.560]  and lying and all this stuff
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:14.560]  but your dad as he was dying
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:16.560]  did talk about bohemian grove
[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:18.560]  well my dad i want to correct you on this
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:20.560]  alex my dad was not a member
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:22.560]  of bohemian grove
[02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:24.560]  he was invited once
[02:40:24.560 --> 02:40:26.560]  by edwin blair who was a very close friend
[02:40:26.560 --> 02:40:28.560]  of his
[02:40:28.560 --> 02:40:30.560]  i think they were well made
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:32.560]  sure sorry i got confused by that
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:34.560]  but to be specific your dad did say
[02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:36.560]  that he didn't like it
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.560]  he went to he went because he was invited
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:40.560]  he went and spent 10 days or something
[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:42.560]  out there and he came home
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:44.560]  and he said it was very lush very
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:46.560]  elegant very interesting lectures
[02:40:46.560 --> 02:40:48.560]  and all but he would never go back
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:50.560]  he said that
[02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:52.560]  i will never go back
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:54.560]  so that was dead
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:56.560]  now you know i i can defend my father
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:58.560]  i cannot really defend my grandfather
[02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:00.560]  that much although i loved him
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:02.560]  and he was he was a mining engineer
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:04.560]  and he was very prominent
[02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:06.560]  and he was probably number
[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:08.560]  one of the top in the world
[02:41:08.560 --> 02:41:10.560]  in the late 1890s
[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:12.560]  wasn't harding a mining engineer too
[02:41:12.560 --> 02:41:14.560]  what's that? Harding, President Harding
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:16.560]  i don't know
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:18.560]  i mean to be specific here though charlotte
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:20.560]  i'm not saying your dad was a bad guy
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:22.560]  he was a great guy obviously
[02:41:22.560 --> 02:41:24.560]  and through his daughter this information
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:26.560]  comes to us as well
[02:41:26.560 --> 02:41:28.560]  going back into memory
[02:41:28.560 --> 02:41:30.560]  i remember you saying that your dad said
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:32.560]  you know basically
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:34.560]  that he disagreed with it all now
[02:41:34.560 --> 02:41:36.560]  and that he didn't like it
[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:38.560]  what he said he really didn't say that
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:40.560]  he never got that close to what
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:42.560]  it all was
[02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:44.560]  he said to me a week before he died
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:46.560]  because i was
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:48.560]  really on my white horse that was getting
[02:41:48.560 --> 02:41:50.560]  my horse very dirty now
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:52.560]  but i was on my white horse from 1970
[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:54.560]  to right now
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:56.560]  and he knew what i was doing
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:41:58.560]  and he said before he died
[02:41:58.560 --> 02:42:00.560]  char
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:02.560]  if i had more time i'd help you
[02:42:02.560 --> 02:42:04.560]  and so
[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.560]  yeah i think that he
[02:42:06.560 --> 02:42:08.560]  you know he was a
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:10.560]  near of three towns
[02:42:10.560 --> 02:42:12.560]  on long island and in jersey
[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:14.560]  he was an Episcopalian
[02:42:14.560 --> 02:42:16.560]  he went to church he was a good Christian
[02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:18.560]  all that now my grandfather
[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:20.560]  was a mason
[02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:22.560]  my grandfather
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:24.560]  what came from pennsylvania
[02:42:24.560 --> 02:42:26.560]  he was the one that i do believe
[02:42:26.560 --> 02:42:28.560]  you know please grandfather forgive me
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:30.560]  he's the one
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:32.560]  who was very close to the
[02:42:32.560 --> 02:42:34.560]  papians in south africa
[02:42:34.560 --> 02:42:36.560]  he was out there he opened up the gold mines
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:38.560]  in the late 1880s
[02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:40.560]  in Johannesburg
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:42.560]  and i had a picture of him with
[02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:44.560]  sir A. Bailey i can't find that picture
[02:42:44.560 --> 02:42:46.560]  i don't know where it is but anyway
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:48.560]  so that's the Cecil Rhodes connection right there
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:50.560]  absolutely so grandpa
[02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:52.560]  really was involved
[02:42:52.560 --> 02:42:54.560]  i think but on the other hand
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:56.560]  he was my grandfather and he was very
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:42:58.560]  dear to me and i loved him
[02:42:58.560 --> 02:43:00.560]  and he was not a snob
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:02.560]  that's very interesting grandpa was
[02:43:02.560 --> 02:43:04.560]  the last person on earth he'd call a snob
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:06.560]  and my father too the whole family
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:08.560]  has always been very
[02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:10.560]  we just sort of get along with everybody
[02:43:10.560 --> 02:43:12.560]  well sure charlin we're not here to
[02:43:12.560 --> 02:43:14.560]  put your family on trial for your dad
[02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:16.560]  and grandfather being skull and moans members
[02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:18.560]  i just want to make the point here that
[02:43:18.560 --> 02:43:20.560]  they're not all
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:22.560]  what people think they are
[02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.560]  but it's really interesting i mean i knew
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:26.560]  my father's best friends they were
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:28.560]  all in his wedding you know
[02:43:28.560 --> 02:43:30.560]  when a skull and bones guy gets married
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:32.560]  all the ushers are
[02:43:32.560 --> 02:43:34.560]  the members of skull and bones in that class
[02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:36.560]  and then from that time on
[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:38.560]  you see them all the time
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:40.560]  they were visiting the house
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:42.560]  i mean they were my parents best friends
[02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:44.560]  and their wives
[02:43:44.560 --> 02:43:46.560]  and they were you never never never would have known
[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:48.560]  what the basic
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:50.560]  what their goals were there was one
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:52.560]  in particular my sister's
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:54.560]  father godfather
[02:43:54.560 --> 02:43:56.560]  huh and very nice and he
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:58.560]  believe it or not was
[02:43:58.560 --> 02:44:00.560]  the the founder of
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:02.560]  the hemlock society
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:06.560]  which pushes suicide did you hear
[02:44:06.560 --> 02:44:08.560]  me well yeah
[02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:10.560]  i mean this sort of thing really did surprise
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:12.560]  me but you know well
[02:44:12.560 --> 02:44:14.560]  i mean let's talk about what it is because from
[02:44:14.560 --> 02:44:16.560]  Sutton's research the info we've got
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:18.560]  it is certainly a death cult a
[02:44:18.560 --> 02:44:20.560]  Germanic death cult
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:22.560]  and it's mainline books have now been
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:24.560]  written clearly you've got the
[02:44:24.560 --> 02:44:26.560]  Illuminati going on in Germany at the time it's
[02:44:26.560 --> 02:44:28.560]  founded 1832 German money British
[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:30.560]  money
[02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.560]  the the skull and bone symbol
[02:44:32.560 --> 02:44:34.560]  worn on the Nazi caps specifically
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:36.560]  though
[02:44:36.560 --> 02:44:38.560]  what is the
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:40.560]  what is the end game goal
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:42.560]  from from what you've researched
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:44.560]  and what you know i mean what is
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:46.560]  skull and bones what what are they after
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:48.560]  well
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:50.560]  you know i don't i think
[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:52.560]  you know a half of them are two
[02:44:52.560 --> 02:44:54.560]  thirds of them are just
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:56.560]  little boys you know they think they're playing
[02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:58.560]  little boys games right
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:00.560]  a third of them
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:02.560]  mean they're big business huh
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:04.560]  i mean one of my father's
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:06.560]  roommates who who i really liked
[02:45:06.560 --> 02:45:08.560]  very well he was named with Charles
[02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:10.560]  Bobford and
[02:45:10.560 --> 02:45:12.560]  he was a very fine man
[02:45:12.560 --> 02:45:14.560]  and and i have nothing but good
[02:45:14.560 --> 02:45:16.560]  things to say about him but when i was
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:18.560]  in the state department in the late 50s
[02:45:18.560 --> 02:45:20.560]  and middle-easter affairs
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:22.560]  all of a sudden i was in the elevator when
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:24.560]  the Suez Canal was blowing up or something
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:26.560]  was going on somebody's always going on out there
[02:45:26.560 --> 02:45:28.560]  but anyway i'm get the elevator
[02:45:28.560 --> 02:45:30.560]  is Chuck Bobford
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:32.560]  and so i said hello mr.
[02:45:32.560 --> 02:45:34.560]  Bobford and what he
[02:45:34.560 --> 02:45:36.560]  you know what i found out that he was
[02:45:36.560 --> 02:45:38.560]  the legal counsel from
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:40.560]  david poke for the
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:42.560]  Suez Canal company
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:44.560]  huh
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:46.560]  ok now
[02:45:46.560 --> 02:45:48.560]  i did write about that
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:50.560]  in um
[02:45:50.560 --> 02:45:52.560]  not nancy's book but in fleshing out
[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:54.560]  skull and bones i have a chapter in that book
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:56.560]  right
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:58.560]  i was asked to do a chapter in that book
[02:45:58.560 --> 02:46:00.560]  which basically tells a lot of this stuff
[02:46:00.560 --> 02:46:02.560]  that we're talking about right now alex
[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:04.560]  so um anyway
[02:46:04.560 --> 02:46:06.560]  Charles Bobford died
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:08.560]  finally died and
[02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:10.560]  interesting story
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:12.560]  he was had a horrible stroke
[02:46:12.560 --> 02:46:14.560]  and he was divorced from his sort of fancy wife
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:16.560]  he ended up marrying this lovely woman
[02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:18.560]  who i had known at david's
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:20.560]  poke when i worked there as a legal
[02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:22.560]  secretary
[02:46:22.560 --> 02:46:24.560]  he married this gal who didn't have
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:26.560]  any fancy background or anything
[02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:28.560]  she's a wonderful woman
[02:46:28.560 --> 02:46:30.560]  and he spent the rest of her life
[02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:32.560]  his life being taken care of
[02:46:32.560 --> 02:46:34.560]  by her now these are the weird things
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:36.560]  about skull and bones people
[02:46:36.560 --> 02:46:38.560]  you know i mean here he was very famous
[02:46:38.560 --> 02:46:40.560]  all over the world he could type his name
[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:42.560]  in Charles Bobford
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:44.560]  he's a member of everything the french
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:46.560]  credit care the blobby block
[02:46:46.560 --> 02:46:48.560]  you know what my father said about him once
[02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:50.560]  oh yeah he did this is this is funny
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:52.560]  at the dining room table
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:54.560]  once my dad he sat back
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:56.560]  he i guess he maybe had a few drinks
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:58.560]  and he had a cigar and he was talking about
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:00.560]  you know he said boy
[02:47:00.560 --> 02:47:02.560]  it's really interesting how chuck got
[02:47:02.560 --> 02:47:04.560]  that promotion and i said
[02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:06.560]  what are you talking about they said well you know
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:08.560]  Chuck Bobford the one i'm talking about
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:10.560]  now he said
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:12.560]  when he was just a private
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:14.560]  or something in or a lieutenant
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:16.560]  in world war two in europe
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:18.560]  but after he got
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:20.560]  promoted to being the under secretary
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:22.560]  for nato or something
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:24.560]  and dad dad said you know
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:26.560]  it's really interesting how some people
[02:47:26.560 --> 02:47:28.560]  can rise to the top
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:30.560]  he was making a joke charlotte
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:32.560]  we're almost out of time all of this is
[02:47:32.560 --> 02:47:34.560]  intriguing information erin
[02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:36.560]  you've got comments about skull and bones
[02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:38.560]  just a little bit about uh... avril heron
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:40.560]  excuse me avril heron
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:42.560]  who was one of the major players
[02:47:42.560 --> 02:47:44.560]  in the 20th century
[02:47:44.560 --> 02:47:46.560]  hi charlotte by the way
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:48.560]  i saw his name
[02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.560]  in the membership list you have
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:52.560]  he has a bio maybe two-thirds
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:54.560]  of a page long
[02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:56.560]  and his public bio just shows how much
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:47:58.560]  he was involved with russian diplomacy
[02:47:58.560 --> 02:48:00.560]  it's on record that he knew
[02:48:00.560 --> 02:48:02.560]  stolen more than any other person
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:04.560]  not from russia
[02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:06.560]  and then you read tarply
[02:48:06.560 --> 02:48:08.560]  and you read sutton and these other authors
[02:48:08.560 --> 02:48:10.560]  about how much he impressed
[02:48:10.560 --> 02:48:12.560]  god bush at brown brothers heron
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:14.560]  were involved in setting up the soviet union
[02:48:14.560 --> 02:48:16.560]  oh absolutely yes
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:18.560]  heron is such an important one
[02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:20.560]  and uh... well you know
[02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:22.560]  it's uh...
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:24.560]  it's just pure evil
[02:48:24.560 --> 02:48:26.560]  that's all i can say
[02:48:26.560 --> 02:48:28.560]  any order like that
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:30.560]  we start studying it or what their goals are
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:32.560]  you know
[02:48:32.560 --> 02:48:34.560]  even if they haven't done all these awful things
[02:48:34.560 --> 02:48:36.560]  you know the games they play
[02:48:36.560 --> 02:48:38.560]  and the horrible
[02:48:38.560 --> 02:48:40.560]  you know what they go through
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:42.560]  to become a member
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:44.560]  that i couldn't understand was my father
[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:46.560]  was very sound you know
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:48.560]  he was a very sound person
[02:48:48.560 --> 02:48:50.560]  i can't even imagine him going through those ridiculous
[02:48:50.560 --> 02:48:52.560]  well he's young that's why the elite put their children
[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:54.560]  into these organizations and so it can be done by their peers
[02:48:54.560 --> 02:48:56.560]  because they know they'll do things that peers say
[02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:58.560]  that they wouldn't do if their parents
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:00.560]  were telling them to do it
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:02.560]  in fact specifically let's go back to your son
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:04.560]  and his research
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:06.560]  into the clock
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:08.560]  and i've done other research
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:10.560]  and other occultic orders
[02:49:10.560 --> 02:49:12.560]  where they can
[02:49:12.560 --> 02:49:14.560]  basically do a spell
[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:16.560]  where they claim that this spirit is attached to you
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:18.560]  as long as the clock
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:20.560]  is still moving
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:22.560]  well i think that's probably what Samuel was talking about
[02:49:22.560 --> 02:49:24.560]  yeah
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:26.560]  but you know what i did to it
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:28.560]  i had these three copper balls
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:30.560]  on the top of it
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:32.560]  and they need to be repaired
[02:49:32.560 --> 02:49:34.560]  so the guy at the shop said
[02:49:34.560 --> 02:49:36.560]  well look i'll give you three eagles
[02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:38.560]  for the time being charlotte
[02:49:38.560 --> 02:49:40.560]  so we took the gold balls off
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:42.560]  there's three of them on the top of the clock
[02:49:42.560 --> 02:49:44.560]  and i put three eagles up there
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:46.560]  and you know
[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:48.560]  scolimbos must be having hysterics
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:50.560]  yeah we've shown the photo of that clock
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:52.560]  we'll show it again here in a moment
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:54.560]  but specifically from your son's research into it
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:56.560]  i mean one other occultic
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:49:58.560]  information do you have
[02:49:58.560 --> 02:50:00.560]  or was there anything
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:02.560]  any other little things
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:04.560]  that your father was concerned about
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:06.560]  no
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:08.560]  no i really can't be very helpful on that
[02:50:08.560 --> 02:50:10.560]  well i know that
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:12.560]  what i have to say about the order
[02:50:12.560 --> 02:50:14.560]  and the lack of attention
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:16.560]  to certain very important things
[02:50:16.560 --> 02:50:18.560]  that they've been doing
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:20.560]  it's okay to write about the order
[02:50:20.560 --> 02:50:22.560]  you can say anything
[02:50:22.560 --> 02:50:24.560]  you want about the order
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:26.560]  but don't touch education
[02:50:26.560 --> 02:50:28.560]  and
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:30.560]  that we know because that was her name
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:32.560]  Samantha was her name that gallerote
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:34.560]  the book when tony's book was coming out
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:36.560]  on fleshing out
[02:50:36.560 --> 02:50:38.560]  you know fleshing out scolimbos
[02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:40.560]  uh... yes uh... uh... alexandra
[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:42.560]  uh...
[02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:44.560]  thompson i believe
[02:50:44.560 --> 02:50:46.560]  let me look up her name real quick
[02:50:46.560 --> 02:50:48.560]  yes
[02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:50.560]  it's important to point this out
[02:50:50.560 --> 02:50:52.560]  because just before
[02:50:52.560 --> 02:50:54.560]  america's secret establishment
[02:50:54.560 --> 02:50:56.560]  by satan came out
[02:50:56.560 --> 02:50:58.560]  she thought they found out
[02:50:58.560 --> 02:51:00.560]  and they got her to write that book
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:02.560]  i think you know this is what i've heard
[02:51:02.560 --> 02:51:04.560]  okay and uh...
[02:51:04.560 --> 02:51:06.560]  if you look at her book
[02:51:06.560 --> 02:51:08.560]  and any other book that's been
[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:10.560]  written or allowed to be reviewed or whatever
[02:51:10.560 --> 02:51:12.560]  do you see nothing about education
[02:51:12.560 --> 02:51:14.560]  nothing
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:16.560]  and as far as i'm concerned
[02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:18.560]  of course turning over all our secrets
[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:20.560]  of stuff to the soviet union
[02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:22.560]  is total reason right
[02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:24.560]  but uh... the method
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:26.560]  the pavlovian the method
[02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.560]  coming out of leipzig germany
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.560]  and it was scolimbones
[02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:32.560]  you know it was uh...
[02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:34.560]  the hopkins university that sent these guys
[02:51:34.560 --> 02:51:36.560]  over there originally
[02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:38.560]  it was a mind control program that they were
[02:51:38.560 --> 02:51:40.560]  going to bring in and she must have gotten married
[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:42.560]  because now her last name is alexandra
[02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:46.560]  no it's alexandra robbins
[02:51:46.560 --> 02:51:48.560]  that's her name go ahead
[02:51:48.560 --> 02:51:50.560]  and if you read her book it's good
[02:51:50.560 --> 02:51:52.560]  but there isn't a single mention
[02:51:52.560 --> 02:51:54.560]  of the mind control method
[02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:56.560]  by the way she comes from another
[02:51:56.560 --> 02:51:58.560]  what is it scroll and key or order of the serpents
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:00.560]  because i had her on
[02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:02.560]  she admits she comes from one of the other elite groups
[02:52:02.560 --> 02:52:04.560]  yeah well i
[02:52:04.560 --> 02:52:06.560]  that's interesting i didn't know that
[02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:08.560]  but again what i want to point out
[02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:10.560]  is that the reason that
[02:52:10.560 --> 02:52:12.560]  the fact that they won't mention
[02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:14.560]  education
[02:52:14.560 --> 02:52:16.560]  is really the most
[02:52:16.560 --> 02:52:18.560]  i think the most important thing that happened
[02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:20.560]  was their role in
[02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:22.560]  bringing that horrible method over
[02:52:22.560 --> 02:52:24.560]  from leipzig
[02:52:24.560 --> 02:52:26.560]  and uh...
[02:52:26.560 --> 02:52:28.560]  i know that Tony
[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:30.560]  he was also very
[02:52:30.560 --> 02:52:32.560]  uh... interested in the work
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:34.560]  done by uh...
[02:52:34.560 --> 02:52:36.560]  paolo leone
[02:52:36.560 --> 02:52:38.560]  and i want to tell your people to go on the internet
[02:52:38.560 --> 02:52:40.560]  look
[02:52:40.560 --> 02:52:42.560]  and google this book
[02:52:42.560 --> 02:52:44.560]  it's called the leipzig connection
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:48.560]  leipzig
[02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:50.560]  germany okay connection
[02:52:50.560 --> 02:52:52.560]  and it may not talk about skull and bones
[02:52:52.560 --> 02:52:54.560]  it does talk about a lot of the german professors
[02:52:54.560 --> 02:52:56.560]  and everything but
[02:52:56.560 --> 02:52:58.560]  that book to me people were saying
[02:52:58.560 --> 02:53:00.560]  my book's great you know everybody else's book is great
[02:53:00.560 --> 02:53:02.560]  i think the most important book
[02:53:02.560 --> 02:53:04.560]  ever written on american education
[02:53:04.560 --> 02:53:06.560]  is called the leipzig connection
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:08.560]  and you can order it
[02:53:08.560 --> 02:53:10.560]  because that's what's going in right now
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:12.560]  now Anthony Sodden also
[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:14.560]  felt that that was the most
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:16.560]  important book because he has quoted
[02:53:16.560 --> 02:53:18.560]  from it in his marvelous book
[02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:20.560]  on the order well everything
[02:53:20.560 --> 02:53:22.560]  is education and they
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:24.560]  federalized it now they're internationalizing it
[02:53:24.560 --> 02:53:26.560]  people get more and more dumb
[02:53:26.560 --> 02:53:28.560]  down they can't communicate
[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:30.560]  and then oh by the way it's an incredible article
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:32.560]  in national
[02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:34.560]  geographic about singapore
[02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:36.560]  and uh... uh...
[02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:38.560]  british intelligence operative they don't admit that
[02:53:38.560 --> 02:53:40.560]  but it's public and an admitted communist
[02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:42.560]  uh... you know from
[02:53:42.560 --> 02:53:44.560]  the big government funded oxford
[02:53:44.560 --> 02:53:46.560]  the minister mentor
[02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:48.560]  he posed as an anti british guy
[02:53:48.560 --> 02:53:50.560]  to bring in the new government
[02:53:50.560 --> 02:53:52.560]  and they admitted here that their
[02:53:52.560 --> 02:53:54.560]  their system of education
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:56.560]  is to dumb people down
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:53:58.560]  so that they can't communicate
[02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:00.560]  so they can just be factory
[02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:02.560]  drones and they
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:04.560]  they admit it's tyranny and they admit
[02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:06.560]  the singapore model is for the entire world
[02:54:06.560 --> 02:54:08.560]  but it's just so incredible
[02:54:08.560 --> 02:54:10.560]  to see now charlotte how
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:12.560]  out in the open uh... they've gotten
[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:14.560]  with all of this
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:16.560]  well we should send me that will you
[02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:18.560]  yeah it's a national
[02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:20.560]  geographic uh...
[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:22.560]  january uh... two thousand
[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:24.560]  and ten uh... issue
[02:54:24.560 --> 02:54:26.560]  national geographic merging
[02:54:26.560 --> 02:54:28.560]  man and machine is the uh...
[02:54:28.560 --> 02:54:30.560]  is the uh... cover of it
[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:32.560]  and i had gotten it
[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:34.560]  you know for a separate issue
[02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:36.560]  uh... wanting to read about the bionic
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:38.560]  stuff which is another system
[02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:40.560]  uh... which again i'm for
[02:54:40.560 --> 02:54:42.560]  technology but they're using it for control
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:44.560]  uh... but it's got the article
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:46.560]  about uh... about singapore
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:48.560]  and it's just so scary
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:50.560]  the first photograph in it
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:52.560]  uh... basically promotes
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:54.560]  uh... the the draconian
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:56.560]  controls that they're putting
[02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:58.560]  into the country

[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:26.560]  now they don't tell you it was british intelligence

[02:55:40.560 --> 02:55:42.560]  oh it's kind of sad

[02:56:10.560 --> 02:56:12.560]  controlled society
[02:56:12.560 --> 02:56:14.560]  and and just how wonderful it is and how
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:16.560]  it's the model for the rest of the planet
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:18.560]  and you may not like it but they know best

[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:38.560]  oh no no they say this is the model now
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:40.560]  that the global elite love it and it's what we're going to have
[02:56:40.560 --> 02:56:42.560]  right and and and and
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:44.560]  and they talk about how great it is
[02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:46.560]  well i just hope that
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:48.560]  uh...
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:50.560]  uh... the american people will

[02:57:02.560 --> 02:57:04.560]  well these are very sick people
[02:57:04.560 --> 02:57:06.560]  and they say we're animals in here
[02:57:06.560 --> 02:57:08.560]  and that the ruling elite knows best
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:10.560]  and that freedom is bad
[02:57:10.560 --> 02:57:12.560]  i mean it's so sick though
[02:57:12.560 --> 02:57:14.560]  that they now just put it out in the open charlotte
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:16.560]  that's what i want to see it and if you don't send that to me
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:18.560]  i'm going to be very upset
[02:57:18.560 --> 02:57:20.560]  was there a photo of scanning
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:22.560]  someone's fortune? oh yeah
[02:57:22.560 --> 02:57:24.560]  it talks about the medical tyranny and how great it is
[02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:26.560]  oh yeah please please please
[02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:28.560]  well who knows you know
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:30.560]  i can read it on the boat and maybe when i get it
[02:57:30.560 --> 02:57:32.560]  to get to singapore i can get in some trouble
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:34.560]  no no no we don't want that to happen
[02:57:34.560 --> 02:57:36.560]  you're not allowed to
[02:57:36.560 --> 02:57:38.560]  just like china they shut down the only independent magazine
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:40.560]  today
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:42.560]  in china and our government says
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:44.560]  that's good now and now the fcc
[02:57:44.560 --> 02:57:46.560]  is announcing they're taking over the internet
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:48.560]  now that's big news today and j rocker
[02:57:48.560 --> 02:57:50.560]  fellow says we'd be better off without it
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:52.560]  they're really just out in the open
[02:57:52.560 --> 02:57:54.560]  i know
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:56.560]  i know
[02:57:56.560 --> 02:57:58.560]  well
[02:57:58.560 --> 02:58:00.560]  anyway i don't know what else i can tell you about the order at yale
[02:58:00.560 --> 02:58:02.560]  except
[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:04.560]  i'm positive that it is a
[02:58:04.560 --> 02:58:06.560]  very important
[02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:08.560]  branch of the illuminati i'm really pretty
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:10.560]  positive of that
[02:58:10.560 --> 02:58:12.560]  well it's the only direct branch to the illuminati
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:14.560]  this document of the original
[02:58:14.560 --> 02:58:16.560]  illuminati and that's confirmed
[02:58:16.560 --> 02:58:18.560]  and the guys did see the book
[02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:20.560]  the original book that i have you know by robinson
[02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:22.560]  and
[02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:24.560]  that's an extraordinary book and it's tough
[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:26.560]  i mean the fact that one page there sounds like
[02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:28.560]  out of a united states global education
[02:58:28.560 --> 02:58:30.560]  uh textbook
[02:58:30.560 --> 02:58:32.560]  it's amazing it talks about
[02:58:32.560 --> 02:58:34.560]  dropping borders
[02:58:34.560 --> 02:58:36.560]  and changing the children's values
[02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:38.560]  i mean charlotte we're out of time we're gonna be right back
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:40.560]  after the break we're going to overdraft stay with us
[02:58:40.560 --> 02:58:42.560]  are you tired of searching
[02:58:42.560 --> 02:58:44.560]  for great talk radio
[02:58:44.560 --> 02:58:46.560]  something more important search
[02:58:46.560 --> 02:58:48.560]  we are the gcm
[02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:50.560]  radio network
[02:58:50.560 --> 02:58:52.560]  hundreds of nations
[02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:54.560]  have fallen to tyranny in the last
[02:58:54.560 --> 02:58:56.560]  century alone this is our last chance
[02:58:56.560 --> 02:58:58.560]  to not relive history
[02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:00.560]  as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:02.560]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the americans
[02:59:02.560 --> 02:59:04.560]  at home
[02:59:04.560 --> 02:59:06.560]  i've turned a tremendous influence
[02:59:06.560 --> 02:59:08.560]  on our president in congress
[02:59:08.560 --> 02:59:10.560]  and they really are calling the shots
[02:59:10.560 --> 02:59:12.560]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:59:12.560 --> 02:59:14.560]  as american citizens to pay attention
[02:59:14.560 --> 02:59:16.560]  fall of the republic identifies
[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:18.560]  the enemies of our nation
[02:59:18.560 --> 02:59:20.560]  the criminal offshore cartel
[02:59:20.560 --> 02:59:22.560]  held bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:59:22.560 --> 02:59:24.560]  and on its ashes constructing world
[02:59:24.560 --> 02:59:26.560]  government
[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:28.560]  they're asking for more matches
[02:59:28.560 --> 02:59:30.560]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:59:30.560 --> 02:59:32.560]  today seems like nobody does care
[02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:34.560]  and right now in washington dc
[02:59:34.560 --> 02:59:36.560]  we have seen
[02:59:36.560 --> 02:59:38.560]  a fall of the republic
[02:59:38.560 --> 02:59:40.560]  get your copy of fall of the republic
[02:59:40.560 --> 02:59:42.560]  on dvd
[02:59:42.560 --> 02:59:44.560]  at info wars dot com
[02:59:44.560 --> 02:59:46.560]  we're watching online right now
[02:59:46.560 --> 02:59:48.560]  in super high quality
[02:59:48.560 --> 02:59:50.560]  at prisenplanet.tv
[02:59:50.560 --> 02:59:52.560]  coast to coast
[02:59:52.560 --> 02:59:54.560]  direct from austin
[02:59:54.560 --> 02:59:56.560]  you're listening
[02:59:56.560 --> 02:59:58.560]  to the alex jones broadcasting network
[02:59:58.560 --> 03:00:00.560]  network
[03:00:08.560 --> 03:00:10.560]  my friends
[03:00:10.560 --> 03:00:12.560]  we have charlotte iserby with us
[03:00:12.560 --> 03:00:14.560]  we're not going to go too far into overdrive
[03:00:14.560 --> 03:00:16.560]  because the first hour was pretty powerful
[03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:18.560]  rants and information
[03:00:18.560 --> 03:00:20.560]  but charlotte
[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:22.560]  is our guest right now an amazing lady
[03:00:22.560 --> 03:00:24.560]  the author of deliberate dumbing down of america
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:26.560]  now out of print but you can go to her website
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:28.560]  and read it free online very gracious of her
[03:00:28.560 --> 03:00:30.560]  but all she wants is justice
[03:00:30.560 --> 03:00:32.560]  and you realize how oppressive and anti-freedom
[03:00:32.560 --> 03:00:34.560]  these new world architects are
[03:00:34.560 --> 03:00:36.560]  you just want to defeat them
[03:00:36.560 --> 03:00:38.560]  i mean because our children
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:40.560]  children humanity has no future
[03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:42.560]  and we've got to get good people
[03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:44.560]  rallied against it but i kind of
[03:00:44.560 --> 03:00:46.560]  into that last hour
[03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:48.560]  scrambled there
[03:00:48.560 --> 03:00:50.560]  trying to apologize to georgia
[03:00:50.560 --> 03:00:52.560]  and other people that were patiently
[03:00:52.560 --> 03:00:54.560]  holding that we're going to try to go to
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:00:56.560]  but just finishing up with charlotte iserby
[03:00:56.560 --> 03:00:58.560]  any other points that you've got
[03:00:58.560 --> 03:01:00.560]  or questions for erin dykes
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:02.560]  well we could probably talk all day
[03:01:02.560 --> 03:01:04.560]  as we did before in the interview
[03:01:04.560 --> 03:01:06.560]  but i just wanted to thank you again
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:08.560]  for speaking with us and all the interesting stuff
[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:10.560]  that you brought out
[03:01:12.560 --> 03:01:14.560]  oh is that erin?
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:16.560]  yes it's erin dykes he's here with you
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:18.560]  oh hello erin yeah well thank you
[03:01:18.560 --> 03:01:20.560]  of course
[03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:22.560]  thank you erin we send you our best
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:24.560]  from here
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:26.560]  and i just
[03:01:26.560 --> 03:01:28.560]  am very grateful that you guys are there
[03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:30.560]  because i don't know that
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:32.560]  there's any other group that's doing
[03:01:32.560 --> 03:01:34.560]  anything like you were doing
[03:01:34.560 --> 03:01:36.560]  your listeners all know that
[03:01:36.560 --> 03:01:38.560]  the council for national policy is
[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:40.560]  just as evil as the council
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:42.560]  in foreign relations so the left and the right
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:44.560]  have the same agenda
[03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:46.560]  and so we've got to understand
[03:01:46.560 --> 03:01:48.560]  that and once we do
[03:01:48.560 --> 03:01:50.560]  understand that we can work together
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:52.560]  sort of in the middle and
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:54.560]  let's briefly talk about the council
[03:01:54.560 --> 03:01:56.560]  for national policy because the hunt brothers
[03:01:56.560 --> 03:01:58.560]  if i'm not
[03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:00.560]  incorrect set that up and
[03:02:00.560 --> 03:02:02.560]  for some evidence show they were actually against the globalist
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:04.560]  but then it got infiltrated
[03:02:04.560 --> 03:02:06.560]  and taken over or was it always
[03:02:06.560 --> 03:02:08.560]  bad because i've had people
[03:02:08.560 --> 03:02:10.560]  on and
[03:02:10.560 --> 03:02:12.560]  folks have pointed this out i wasn't really aware of it until
[03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:14.560]  the last decade and some people
[03:02:14.560 --> 03:02:16.560]  kind of on the left say oh it's even more powerful
[03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:18.560]  they kind of make it a left right paradigm
[03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:20.560]  but i see cfr
[03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:22.560]  council for national policy a lot of people
[03:02:22.560 --> 03:02:24.560]  in both groups are kind of like porch masons
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:26.560]  they're not at the top of the pyramid
[03:02:26.560 --> 03:02:28.560]  but certainly now that the council
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:30.560]  for national policy there's no doubt it's
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:32.560]  promoting a globalist agenda i mean what's your view on it
[03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:34.560]  oh i believe so i mean if you take
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:36.560]  you know nafta
[03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:38.560]  uh...
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:40.560]  richard alan uh... he was
[03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:42.560]  he was with
[03:02:42.560 --> 03:02:44.560]  reagan right in the right house
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:46.560]  he was fired because he accepted a
[03:02:46.560 --> 03:02:48.560]  risk watch from the japanese
[03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:50.560]  and he went to work for the heritage foundation
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:52.560]  and
[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:54.560]  he's council for national policy
[03:02:54.560 --> 03:02:56.560]  and that heritage foundation
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:58.560]  ed polner who set up an office
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:00.560]  in moscow when the
[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:02.560]  world came down these are cmp people
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:04.560]  but richard alan wrote nafta
[03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:06.560]  and you know so
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:08.560]  people have got to understand that
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:10.560]  you know although you know heritage foundation
[03:03:10.560 --> 03:03:12.560]  you know turns out all these
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:14.560]  wonderful reports and everything that
[03:03:14.560 --> 03:03:16.560]  ninety percent of which you could agree with
[03:03:16.560 --> 03:03:18.560]  but ten percent
[03:03:18.560 --> 03:03:20.560]  of what they're doing is
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:22.560]  really even more important than
[03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:24.560]  the ninety percent because if they have
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:26.560]  the globalist agenda they love
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:28.560]  the u n they want an international
[03:03:28.560 --> 03:03:30.560]  system they of course think they're going to run it
[03:03:30.560 --> 03:03:32.560]  but uh... they're going to run it
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:34.560]  with rock of all and everybody else
[03:03:34.560 --> 03:03:36.560]  it's a very very bad organ
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:38.560]  that's hardly the word it's a very just
[03:03:38.560 --> 03:03:40.560]  people deceptive group
[03:03:40.560 --> 03:03:42.560]  that i found out through
[03:03:42.560 --> 03:03:44.560]  trying to work with them uh... they hate me
[03:03:44.560 --> 03:03:46.560]  but ross hailey
[03:03:46.560 --> 03:03:48.560]  from texas down there where you guys
[03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:50.560]  are uh... she was a lovely
[03:03:50.560 --> 03:03:52.560]  like the grandom
[03:03:52.560 --> 03:03:54.560]  of the council for national policy
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:03:56.560]  and uh... she close friend
[03:03:56.560 --> 03:03:58.560]  of norman dodd she and i
[03:03:58.560 --> 03:04:00.560]  will put together a project to get out
[03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:02.560]  of the u n a really good project
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:04.560]  and we sent letters to three hundred
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:06.560]  or more members of the
[03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:08.560]  council for national policy to help us
[03:04:08.560 --> 03:04:10.560]  sam on my son typed
[03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:12.560]  all the labels out of the computer this was
[03:04:12.560 --> 03:04:14.560]  fifteen years ago we didn't
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:16.560]  get one single response
[03:04:16.560 --> 03:04:18.560]  even though she
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:20.560]  ross hailey was highly thought of
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:22.560]  at the end the council for national policy
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:24.560]  you know this segment is over
[03:04:24.560 --> 03:04:26.560]  but now i want to get you back on
[03:04:26.560 --> 03:04:28.560]  about the cmp
[03:04:28.560 --> 03:04:30.560]  and the infiltration of conservative movements
[03:04:30.560 --> 03:04:32.560]  by the globalist this is
[03:04:32.560 --> 03:04:34.560]  just like skull and bones you've got democrats
[03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:36.560]  and republicans from there correct
[03:04:36.560 --> 03:04:38.560]  you absolutely do and i think
[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:40.560]  they're more dangerous
[03:04:40.560 --> 03:04:42.560]  i think that the neoconservatives
[03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:44.560]  are more dangerous than the left
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:46.560]  because the left
[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:48.560]  tells the truth as bad as it is
[03:04:48.560 --> 03:04:50.560]  they don't lie all the time to us
[03:04:50.560 --> 03:04:52.560]  about what they're doing
[03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:54.560]  but the right wing is lying
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:04:56.560]  incredible i'm going to have you back on
[03:04:56.560 --> 03:04:58.560]  soon on the cmp
[03:04:58.560 --> 03:05:00.560]  stay with us folks this is important
[03:05:00.560 --> 03:05:20.560]  we'll see you next time bye bye
