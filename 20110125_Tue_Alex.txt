[00:49.160 --> 00:56.040]  and then we our interview got cut off short because we got or she got time zones messed up
[00:56.040 --> 01:01.880]  Phyllis Schlafly will be joining us the founder of the Eagle Forum coming up in the last 30 minutes
[01:01.880 --> 01:07.280]  the broadcast today to talk about the future of this country and are we really going to see change
[01:07.280 --> 01:13.040]  out of this Republican House of Representatives and what's gonna happen if they don't deliver on
[01:13.040 --> 01:19.280]  fully repealing Obamacare or what's gonna happen if they go along with Obama who Mr. Gibbs said
[01:19.280 --> 01:25.360]  yesterday at the White House briefing will be pushing gun grabbing victim disarmament tonight
[01:25.360 --> 01:30.080]  in the state of the Union so she'll be popping in with us in the last 30 minutes of the broadcast
[01:30.080 --> 01:37.200]  we're going to have open phones throughout the transmission today on any subject or any item
[01:37.200 --> 01:41.120]  you wish to discuss but I do want to open the phones up at least the first half of the broadcast
[01:41.120 --> 01:45.840]  to first-time callers only because I just talked to so many people who've tried to call in over
[01:45.840 --> 01:51.520]  the years who can never get involved any of the issues I'm about to cover you are welcome to call
[01:51.520 --> 01:58.000]  in about now we had a chilling phone call at the end of the broadcast yesterday from a man who had
[01:58.000 --> 02:04.320]  been in the military in the army and then in the National Guard assigned to the state guard
[02:04.320 --> 02:11.840]  in the northwest for martial law takeover drills and to set up checkpoints and run people's drivers
[02:11.840 --> 02:17.040]  license and license plate and then put them in the backs of army trucks now what was so chilling
[02:17.040 --> 02:24.320]  about the phone call is I have been to more than 15 I was trying to count it up in my mind last night
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.240]  instead of counting sheep going to bed at midnight I was trying to count how many urban warfare
[02:28.240 --> 02:33.120]  drills I've been to where they're openly training to put Americans in FEMA camps and now you know
[02:33.120 --> 02:41.280]  about the John Warner defense authorization act the 10 regional FEMA governors Rex 84 the emergency
[02:41.280 --> 02:48.400]  centers act the model states emergency powers act what was so chilling from hearing from him is
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.080]  that there's no way he could fake that and not be telling the truth because everything he was
[02:52.080 --> 02:57.440]  saying on air I've separately confirmed myself and reverse engineered from the public record and
[02:57.440 --> 03:04.160]  from attending these of these events some of which were unannounced I just got tips from inside
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.720]  police departments in the military and was able to jump on airplanes or get in the car
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.240]  and drive to cover those but just to hear it from a member of the military and how when they would
[03:14.240 --> 03:19.440]  ask questions about the role players saying I'm an American I'm your uncle I'm your dad I go to
[03:19.440 --> 03:23.600]  church with your wife and but they're still taken out of their car at the checkpoint and put in the
[03:23.600 --> 03:29.600]  army truck to hear that really brings it home how serious it is and how they were immediately
[03:30.160 --> 03:34.240]  kicking them out of the National Guard and the State Guard if they even ask questions
[03:35.440 --> 03:42.080]  the same thing is done obviously with the TSA and we've confirmed we first got reports of it from
[03:42.080 --> 03:46.880]  callers and then we confirmed and saw blurbs in the news that they call the TSA in and said you
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.200]  have a problem with the radiation from these scanners you have a problem sticking your hands
[03:51.200 --> 03:56.080]  down people's pants and if you have any problem I tell you thank you very much and about a week
[03:56.080 --> 04:01.200]  later you get your pink slip you're laid off this is how they're doing it this is how they're building
[04:01.200 --> 04:09.280]  an army of police military and TSA government not even police officers not even sworn officers
[04:09.840 --> 04:13.680]  goon squads who know nothing about the bill of rights and constitution they're just creating a
[04:13.680 --> 04:18.000]  new brown shirt brigade that really believes they're protecting us from terrorism and now
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.400]  rolling them out on the streets and we also have it in the clergy response teams and the infregard
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.800]  reports that have come out in the documents we've received that they are preparing for a total
[04:27.360 --> 04:33.920]  takeover and a hot form not a cold form of creeping tyranny and and and slow martial law
[04:33.920 --> 04:40.240]  but building up towards a hot martial law a mass roundup with the red list the blue list and the
[04:40.240 --> 04:45.280]  rest of it now we've got to get the word out about this speak out against it to say no to it
[04:45.280 --> 04:51.840]  because it's so brazenly tyrannical so illegal so unconstitutional so treasonous that if we stand up
[04:51.840 --> 04:55.440]  and aren't intimidated by this and speak out against it they won't get away with it but
[04:55.440 --> 05:00.400]  they're beta testing it right now we'll be right back with big news on the tsa inventory
[05:02.000 --> 05:08.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[05:08.080 --> 05:13.280]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[05:13.280 --> 05:18.960]  Americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence on our president in congress and they
[05:18.960 --> 05:25.680]  really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[05:25.680 --> 05:31.440]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held

[08:47.520 --> 08:51.920]  callers at least in the first hour and a half ahead of several informative guests that we have
[08:51.920 --> 09:04.960]  joining us the toll-free number to get involved on air is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 okay obviously
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.200]  i'm going to talk some about the state of the union coming up tonight with barry sataro aka
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.160]  barack obama the white house press secretary confirmed what we reported on a week ago
[09:15.760 --> 09:20.000]  that there are rumors and he's now confirmed those that obama will throw down the gauntlet
[09:20.640 --> 09:24.080]  of course he's such a liar and his handlers are such liars we don't know that's actually
[09:24.080 --> 09:27.920]  going to happen but we've confirmed that they are saying gibb said in the press conference
[09:27.920 --> 09:33.200]  yesterday white house press conference that they will be bringing out gun grabbing victim
[09:33.200 --> 09:39.200]  disarmament tonight a lot of other big facets coming up a real constitutional split with
[09:39.200 --> 09:43.280]  the supreme court justices at least two of them reporting that they're not going to be attending
[09:43.280 --> 09:49.760]  the night because obama singled them out and excoriated them which is just an amazing thing
[09:49.760 --> 09:55.680]  to do via the separation of powers completely unconstitutional in the spirit of what he did
[09:55.680 --> 09:59.200]  at the last state of the union we're going to be going over that important stack and i'd love to
[09:59.200 --> 10:05.280]  hear from you on your views ahead of the state of the union we're also being told that the big
[10:05.280 --> 10:12.240]  push is going to be some new campaign slogans that are going to be rolled out it's a republican
[10:12.240 --> 10:17.600]  slogan used on the west coast in oregon and washington and that's confirmed but he's stealing it
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.720]  and the headline here in roll call is republican owns obamas win the future and that's another
[10:24.720 --> 10:32.720]  a spin or variant of hope and change let the confidence men just drag you and and and and
[10:32.720 --> 10:38.560]  and string us along a little bit longer while the banks consolidate their global government
[10:38.560 --> 10:46.720]  run through their 1.5 quadrillion uh in derivatives so that is coming up huge unrest uh via what's
[10:46.720 --> 10:55.200]  more and more looking like nato slash cia instituted operations of course from tunisia uh to egypt
[10:55.760 --> 11:02.320]  into yemen serious riots exploding all over that area of the world many of these countries so
[11:02.320 --> 11:10.880]  called allies of the anglo-american establishment or the west another chilling article by paul
[11:10.880 --> 11:17.920]  joseph watson up at prisonplanet.com carnegie endowment that's one of the top globalist
[11:17.920 --> 11:22.960]  tax-free foundations openly pushing world government now for 100 plus years carnegie
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.880]  touts green credentials of gingis con for slaughtering 40 million people and let me forget
[11:28.880 --> 11:35.200]  the 1996 un biological diversity assessment where it talked about we must reduce the world
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.400]  population by 80 we show screenshots of that public assessment in my film road to tyranny
[11:40.400 --> 11:46.400]  now out for nine years and they said we we need to bring back human sacrifice like the aztecs have
[11:46.400 --> 11:52.000]  we need to bring back wars to reduce population we need to have ways of slaughtering people
[11:52.880 --> 11:58.480]  and of course you saw that in the state department of random 200 put out by kissinger in 73 he
[11:58.480 --> 12:04.240]  classified in 92 where he said we need to fund the third world through imf and world bank money
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.120]  and make sure they reduce their populations through forced sterilization and abortion or
[12:09.120 --> 12:14.320]  they won't get any of the imf world bank loans and we need to fund enemy nations on their
[12:14.320 --> 12:20.080]  borders to start wars and to create famines so this is part of their disgusting out of control
[12:20.080 --> 12:27.440]  policy and this article is up at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com uh lauding gingis con i mean
[12:27.440 --> 12:32.800]  these reports now come out almost every day as they openly uh you know explain what they're doing
[12:32.800 --> 12:39.840]  it's not like the globalists have to get over some moral compulsion to not kill they see it as moral
[12:39.840 --> 12:46.160]  of course it came out that the earth first battalion back in the 1970s and 80s at the pentagon
[12:47.040 --> 12:54.080]  it got whitewashed to a great extent by the men who stare at goats movie with george cloney and
[12:55.600 --> 13:01.440]  others but in the earth first battalion and and and you can pull these up it's at any library it
[13:01.440 --> 13:06.800]  was published by the u.s. army they say we are the pale horse death we bring death worldwide
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.920]  you know bring in the world government i mean this is just amazing amazing stuff the first
[13:11.920 --> 13:17.280]  time i saw this was about 13 years ago tex marge let me dig through his giant archives at his office
[13:17.280 --> 13:22.160]  and i first saw a copy of the earth first battalion not to be confused with the environmental radical
[13:22.160 --> 13:28.000]  group earth first but they did basically take their name from that uh calling for uh this type
[13:28.000 --> 13:33.520]  of global carnage that they're bringing in to cleanse the earth of the parasite disease that is
[13:33.520 --> 13:39.600]  mankind so remember who's in control of the government a bunch of eugenicists hell bent
[13:39.600 --> 13:47.680]  on mass extermination but the first thing i want to get into today is an article that erin dykes
[13:47.680 --> 13:56.720]  and i wrote together uh last night and um i actually just gave erin the research notes
[13:56.720 --> 14:00.640]  and the points i wanted to be made and erin did the lion's share of putting out this excellent
[14:01.280 --> 14:06.640]  report that is up at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com if you're watching or listening
[14:08.720 --> 14:15.040]  on the radio or at prisonplanet.tv right now you can go over to drudgereport.com
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.960]  and it is the very top link uh on the drudge report the number one alternative news site in the
[14:20.960 --> 14:29.680]  world uh ventura strikes back with lawsuit against tsa the inside story from alex jones
[14:29.680 --> 14:37.440]  about the former governor's humiliating pat down experiences that included touching um
[14:38.960 --> 14:48.080]  groping gripping and rubbing the genitals at the hands of the tsa and of course he talked about
[14:48.080 --> 14:55.760]  this and broke the news uh here in november that he was uh not going to be flying anymore and that
[14:55.760 --> 15:03.040]  basically his career uh in television uh producing tv shows was over because he is not going to ever
[15:03.040 --> 15:08.320]  fly again and he did not fly uh down to mexico uh for the winter he drove his rv through the
[15:08.320 --> 15:14.640]  snowstorms in minnesota in late december and uh traveled down there and uh back at the time i had
[15:14.640 --> 15:19.920]  him back on early december and he confirmed to me he told me in september that he didn't know what
[15:19.920 --> 15:24.160]  he was going to do that his career was ending because he he couldn't subject himself to this
[15:24.160 --> 15:29.200]  this groping the sexual assault and that's what his lawsuit talks about and he didn't know what to do
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.920]  then in november privately he told me that he was considering a lawsuit that in early uh
[15:33.920 --> 15:40.480]  december to get the timeline straight um he told me off air and so john harman heard it and the
[15:40.480 --> 15:47.280]  crew heard it but no one else did that he was initiating the lawsuit in early 2011 uh but
[15:47.280 --> 15:53.200]  obviously not to tell anybody about it until the lawsuit had been launched and i said well
[15:53.200 --> 15:57.040]  hopefully we can get you on once this happens and he said well you know i don't do media
[15:57.040 --> 16:03.120]  when i'm in mexico but he said i might do your show but let's wait and see um and then he said
[16:03.120 --> 16:07.920]  he can go into town and and maybe get on a phone line and call in because he he lives
[16:07.920 --> 16:16.080]  an hour from pavement an hour from any town his little bungalow has uh solar power and um
[16:16.080 --> 16:22.640]  so he really can't do uh interviews from there but i uh got a call from tyrell ventura last night
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.360]  saying well the lawsuit has dropped and i said i know i'm on it right now writing an article
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.120]  i was on the other line actually with erin going through the article that we published in the
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.560]  early morning hours today and he said well he'll work on getting him on the show in the next few
[16:36.560 --> 16:43.200]  days or in the next week but regardless uh that uh if i give tyrell questions well actually have
[16:43.200 --> 16:47.120]  jesse's email down there but he's got to go into town to get it that jesse will write a statement
[16:47.120 --> 16:52.000]  for the show a bare minimum but we already have his statement it's what's in the lawsuit and it's
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.800]  what he said in november and december when he broke on this show that he was no longer going
[16:56.800 --> 17:01.440]  to be traveling because he couldn't subject himself to the sexual humiliation there's
[17:01.440 --> 17:08.880]  already precedent here now a woman in texas who sued over them pulling off her shirt and bra and
[17:08.880 --> 17:14.080]  bearing her breast and then laughing and she was quite attractive and then the tsa men in front of
[17:14.080 --> 17:19.200]  witnesses came up and said man i wish i could have been part of that search baby went once
[17:19.200 --> 17:25.840]  she was in the gate area crying uh they were so inhuman because they fire everybody that's human
[17:25.840 --> 17:31.120]  they fire everybody that's got a soul they fire anybody who understands that ripping colostomy
[17:31.120 --> 17:37.280]  bags off people or urology bags or making they make people who can't walk i've seen this they
[17:37.280 --> 17:41.920]  order them to get up and and old men and women who look like they are five seconds from death
[17:41.920 --> 17:49.200]  two minutes from midnight can't get up and then they make passengers pick them up i mean these are
[17:49.200 --> 17:54.160]  people that are incredibly fragile that could break bones or pull muscles just getting from their
[17:54.160 --> 18:01.280]  wheelchair to a toilet and they're always going to visit their family one more time or uh once i saw
[18:01.280 --> 18:07.520]  in 2003 i was in a san francisco airport and they had private security on top of tsa at the gate
[18:07.520 --> 18:14.400]  searching people again not just at the checkpoint and i saw a group of world war two um survivors
[18:15.920 --> 18:21.840]  of pearl harbor and some of them had hats that you know said the arizona on them and and and and
[18:21.840 --> 18:30.560]  one of these guys looked like he was about to die he had his his his eye uh you know the uh the

[25:32.720 --> 25:38.080]  in the lawsuit they are violating his civil rights as a disabled american with a titanian
[25:38.080 --> 25:42.240]  hip every time he goes through they pull him out and do lengthy searches i've witnessed it
[25:42.240 --> 25:48.080]  i'm gonna go through that and he gets even more upset watching them force people in wheelchairs
[25:48.080 --> 25:53.840]  to get up and it is just a nightmare situation especially in atlanta uh where i witnessed it
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.480]  go on for about eight minutes and he started speaking up against it and the tsa was giggling
[25:58.480 --> 26:02.240]  and smirking and thought it was a lot of fun and they all knew exactly who he was and a bunch of
[26:02.240 --> 26:07.600]  people gathered around and because he spoke out against it they took their time humiliating him
[26:07.600 --> 26:13.440]  letting him know that government owns him that he has no private space former governor jesse ventura
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.920]  has taken steps he's actually filed the suit against the tsa and the department of homeland
[26:17.920 --> 26:24.720]  security naming their chiefs john pistole and big sis janet napolitano in a lawsuit that will
[26:25.440 --> 26:30.880]  take on invasive airport pat downs and then we have a link there in the article to the lawsuit
[26:30.880 --> 26:37.120]  if you want to read it to the federal lawsuit then torra first told alex jones of his intent
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.400]  to sue the tsa privately back in november while traveling for the making of true tv's conspiracy
[26:42.400 --> 26:48.480]  theory expressing grave concern about what he viewed as his country's transformation into east
[26:48.480 --> 26:54.560]  germany as far back as september ventura confided in jones that his career was under threat and
[26:54.560 --> 26:59.200]  that he was considering abandoning travel altogether because of the fact that he was being harassed by
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.880]  tsa agents every single time he went through an airport security checkpoint i witnessed him
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.640]  you know on the phone telling the execs at your tv i can't do this anymore i'm done
[27:08.640 --> 27:12.000]  i can't travel i can't go anywhere i'm never flying again and of course he then announced
[27:12.000 --> 27:20.000]  that here on the air continuing jones recalls ventura's outrage at the tsa's harassing old
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.880]  people in wheelchairs with the invasive new pat down procedures the former governor himself
[27:24.880 --> 27:30.800]  is routinely sent to secondary screening every time he is due to a hip replacement in 2008
[27:30.800 --> 27:35.440]  and jones witnessed him undergo repeated humiliating searches during pat downs at the hands of the
[27:35.440 --> 27:41.920]  tsa worse at airports across the country even those presenting medical cards which tsa's supposed
[27:41.920 --> 27:47.920]  to accept uh describing special needs or equipment from a doctor or routinely ignored as tsa agents
[27:47.920 --> 27:55.840]  demand that medical patients remove uh your astronomy bags prosthetic breast or the tsa be
[27:55.840 --> 28:00.960]  allowed to grope a pacemaker patients breast and we have links to all the mainstream articles about
[28:00.960 --> 28:06.240]  that that's why i want to leave the united states ventura told jones at the time that's what he said
[28:06.240 --> 28:10.400]  to the tsa right in front of me i was sitting there in the chair waiting for him to go through the
[28:10.400 --> 28:15.760]  the write down the pat down the grope down this is why i go down to mexico this is wrong he was
[28:15.760 --> 28:20.480]  saying to the tsa in fact i think i'm gonna have erin's asleep now as he stayed up all night doing
[28:20.480 --> 28:25.840]  this we need to have watson add that he he was telling tsa this he wasn't even really telling me
[28:25.840 --> 28:31.520]  this he was standing there with him all over him and as it went on and on i was sitting there in
[28:31.520 --> 28:35.360]  fact i was sitting there taking photos of with my iphone we went through the checkpoint went and
[28:35.360 --> 28:39.520]  got food and i said look at these photos he goes i'm glad you took them in case something happened
[28:40.080 --> 28:47.040]  but uh nothing happened so erase them and i said okay and i erased them but i had the photos on
[28:47.040 --> 28:51.360]  this iphone a whole bunch of this went on for like eight minutes probably longer by the time
[28:51.360 --> 28:54.960]  i started timing and it was eight minutes i was just sitting there while they were you know hands
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.880]  between his legs all over and would have been good evidence but ventura was embarrassed by it
[28:58.880 --> 29:04.480]  and wanted to erased uh what would have helped with the suit but he got i mean i told him about it
[29:04.480 --> 29:11.120]  he said get rid of him uh but the point is is that this went on and on and on so telling the tsa
[29:11.120 --> 29:16.160]  that's why i want to leave the united states ventura told jones at the time this is why i go down to
[29:16.160 --> 29:23.520]  mexico this is wrong he told the tsa ventura indicated that he has uh was most concerned about
[29:23.520 --> 29:29.920]  the destruction of the fourth amendment and passing of the america he once knew we're gonna

[33:23.840 --> 33:30.080]  we have two articles up at info wars dot com prism punna dot com uh not just the ventura
[33:30.080 --> 33:37.680]  strikes back with lawsuit against tsa we have another one uh with the headline uh dealing
[33:37.680 --> 33:48.400]  with the fact that his lawsuit is uh getting into the issue of the fact that this is sexual abuse
[33:49.520 --> 33:56.000]  and so we need to get these articles out to everyone out there that we can but continuing
[33:56.720 --> 34:04.320]  with this article here during one tsa pat down procedure on ventura that jones
[34:04.320 --> 34:08.560]  witnessed at atlanta international airport ventura loudly proclaimed his disgust the united
[34:08.560 --> 34:14.240]  states had turned into east germany and that america he loved and served in the u.s military
[34:14.240 --> 34:19.840]  was dead while tsa agents conducting the pat down merely smiled they knew who ventura was and that he
[34:19.840 --> 34:25.680]  was a public figure yeah crowd gathered around but still subjected the former governor to an
[34:25.680 --> 34:31.200]  eight-minute plus invasive search and when they call you out and put you in the glass box it's all
[34:31.200 --> 34:35.680]  about humiliation it's like having the dunce hat put on you and this is all peer pressure
[34:36.320 --> 34:43.600]  that's being uh engaged in uh here but as i said if you go up to info wars dot com there's two
[34:43.600 --> 34:50.080]  articles by paul joseph uh watson uh dealing with this and two articles dealing with this from
[34:50.080 --> 34:58.400]  erin dykes the second article is ventura lawsuit tsa pat downs classify as unlawful sexual abuse
[34:58.400 --> 35:04.400]  and we need to get these out again to everyone so that people realize what's happening in the
[35:04.400 --> 35:12.080]  society and that all of this violates our constitutional rights in a big way continuing
[35:12.640 --> 35:19.360]  uh ventura filed his lawsuit monday january 24 2011 in minnesota and news reports have named
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.600]  david ulson as his lawyer the former governor has indicated that his suit will include violations
[35:25.600 --> 35:30.400]  of the americans with disabilities act in the fourth amendment arguing that he and others
[35:30.400 --> 35:36.000]  with disabilities have been discriminated against and unduly signaled out by the tsa despite presenting
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.040]  no threat and warning no reason for a lawful search further ventura has argued that his ability
[35:43.040 --> 35:48.800]  to travel freely has been infringed hampering his ability to work yeah they're destroying your
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.080]  right to travel your uh right of passage that's the first thing the nazis did was set up internal
[35:54.080 --> 35:58.800]  checkpoints and banned certain groups from being able to engage in commerce that's the same thing
[35:58.800 --> 36:04.000]  the soviets did that's how the communist chinese shut you down that's what fidel castro does this
[36:04.000 --> 36:14.480]  is a main tool of tyrants over and over again uh in history uh continuing uh here in november 2010
[36:14.480 --> 36:20.160]  ventura vowed on the alex jones show that he would never again fly on commercial aircraft
[36:20.160 --> 36:26.720]  so long as current tsa policies remain in place it probably means an end to my career ventura
[36:26.720 --> 36:31.520]  lamented on the radio broadcast we have a link to that video and audio as the drugs report exposed
[36:31.520 --> 36:36.800]  months ago ventura uh had been groped during tsa pat downs and is uncomfortable with the
[36:36.800 --> 36:42.480]  invasion of privacy as well as the abuse of government power now kstp in minnesota is reporting
[36:42.480 --> 36:47.440]  that ventura accused the agencies of violating his basic rights to privacy and dignity and his
[36:47.440 --> 36:52.640]  right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures ventura alleges that pat downs include
[36:52.640 --> 36:59.680]  warrantless non-suspicion based uh offensive touching uh gripping and rubbing of the genitals
[36:59.680 --> 37:07.040]  and other sensitive areas of his body which the lawsuit contends met the definition for an unlawful
[37:07.040 --> 37:14.160]  sexual assault in november uh jesse ventura confirmed alex jones that he would be suing
[37:14.160 --> 37:20.000]  the tsa in the new year and would explain more once the suit was filed ventura is in the baha
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.600]  area of mexico but alex was told yesterday by his management that ventura would be giving jones
[37:25.600 --> 37:30.080]  a written statement and should be appearing on the alex jones show in the near future if he's able
[37:30.080 --> 37:37.360]  to uh continuing homeland security in the ever encroaching siren song of public safety is attempting
[37:37.360 --> 37:42.800]  to uh bar our right of free passage across the country those who refuse to cooperate with body
[37:42.800 --> 37:48.880]  scanners or pat downs are told they will be arrested detained or fined just as in nazi germany we're
[37:48.880 --> 37:57.040]  increasing uh increasingly geared towards internal passports where we must satisfy on the spot inspection
[37:57.040 --> 38:02.480]  or we refuse the ability to travel and now it's expanding again to trains buses highways tsa
[38:02.480 --> 38:08.480]  into walmarts dhs everywhere they're running psas on tv about how they're going to be in the mall
[38:08.480 --> 38:13.680]  and at sport stadiums uh you know protecting you we covered that last week this is the rollout of
[38:13.680 --> 38:20.640]  the federal gun force tourism is down by the billions of dollars angry uh travel and vacation
[38:20.640 --> 38:26.000]  industry representatives told the tsa to back down citing some 41 million potential fliers
[38:26.000 --> 38:32.080]  who avoided travel due to anxiety over airport security but airports are only the leading phase
[38:32.080 --> 38:36.720]  tsa viper squads and mobile x-ray scanners are rolling out onto the streets of america
[38:36.720 --> 38:41.200]  and train bus stations sport stadiums and shopping malls will be next homeland security
[38:41.200 --> 38:47.600]  is unveiling 9 000 telescreens at 9 000 locations across america including walmart to encourage
[38:47.600 --> 38:52.000]  people to spy on their neighbors if anyone could stop the police state as the people of the united
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.440]  states the bigger picture is looking more and more like 1984 it is vital that we resist these
[38:57.440 --> 39:03.680]  police state measures and make our voices heard we commend governor jessie ventura for standing up
[39:03.680 --> 39:10.880]  to the tsa and using his prominent name to fight back against uh clear bullying and intimidation
[39:10.880 --> 39:15.440]  by the government agency trying to expand its mandate of power yeah it's a power grab others
[39:15.440 --> 39:19.760]  have fought the tsa including a man in seattle recently won his suit over the right to use a
[39:19.760 --> 39:24.960]  camera moreover the tsa had to settle with an amarillo texas woman after the agent shockingly
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.600]  exposed her breast and then laughed about it uh the news reported in the suit reported they actually
[39:29.600 --> 39:34.480]  came up and said man i wish i'd have been part of that search honey uh so that's again one of the
[39:34.480 --> 39:41.280]  articles there's another article of ventura lawsuit tsa pat down's classify as unlawful
[39:41.280 --> 39:46.560]  sexual abuse another article authored by erin dyke solely this article ventura strikes back
[39:46.560 --> 39:53.600]  with lawsuit against tsa is again erin dyke's and alex jones please help us get this out to
[39:53.600 --> 40:01.680]  everyone you know it is so important that people realize the full spectrum what's happening
[40:01.680 --> 40:06.640]  normally when you see a mainstream news article about the tsa they only report on one tiny
[40:07.280 --> 40:14.320]  factor in the overall uh larger equation one little fraction of it this article is a full
[40:14.320 --> 40:18.880]  spectrum breakdown to give people the big picture and that's why it's such a godsend that a juggernaut
[40:18.880 --> 40:24.960]  uh site like the drudge report is top link to it because we've been fighting against this tsa
[40:24.960 --> 40:31.440]  takeover society uh now for at least nine years i saw governor ridge eight years ago uh the incoming
[40:31.440 --> 40:37.120]  head of homeland security at the time right as it was getting a cabinet level position i openly saw
[40:37.120 --> 40:42.560]  him announce that tsa is going to be all over america that the airports were a beta test so we
[40:42.560 --> 40:47.760]  knew what they were going to do and now what's happening so for those marveling uh that we
[40:47.760 --> 40:52.000]  vacuately been able to break down the future it's not hard they told us what they would do
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.600]  and there's no doubt this has nothing to do with security it's about a federal power grab
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.640]  as they bring us into this orchestrated engineered depression they're trying to end our way of life
[41:00.640 --> 41:07.680]  this is a globalist revolution against liberty and freedom now we also again have the lawsuit linked
[41:07.680 --> 41:12.880]  uh in the first paragraph of the article if you want to read it uh in full in the article
[41:12.880 --> 41:17.920]  ventura strikes back with lawsuit against tsa it's also in the second ventura article
[41:17.920 --> 41:24.800]  ventura lawsuit tsa pat downs classify as unlawful sexual abuse and i'll cover that story
[41:25.360 --> 41:31.040]  that second part after we take some of your phone calls uh but if they get away with this tsa
[41:31.040 --> 41:36.320]  takeover they're going to get away with everything if they can set this precedent stick their hands
[41:36.320 --> 41:40.560]  down our pants and to put us in naked body scanners that bathe us in radiation which they
[41:40.560 --> 41:44.240]  admit is dangerous now if they can get away with that they can get away with anything and they're
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.000]  building this army of dumbed down goons who think it's normal and right to do all of this but the
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.120]  good news is the courts are ruling over and over again what they're doing is wrong and this in
[41:55.120 --> 42:00.880]  ventura has sued the head of the w w f and one that nobody ever beat he sued other people he's
[42:00.880 --> 42:06.480]  not litigious but if you stomp on him and violate his rights he will come after you in court and uh
[42:06.480 --> 42:10.560]  he's you know he told me privately said i've never lost a lawsuit of the few he's filed and
[42:10.560 --> 42:14.800]  he's going after him and they did deep research on this the last two months and as we need to get
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.200]  behind this by certainly spreading the word about it to spur others to stand up for their rights
[42:19.200 --> 42:24.000]  and to file more suits resistance is victory john in new york you're on the air thanks for holding
[42:24.960 --> 42:32.400]  hi alex how you doing i'm a first time caller um and i just wanted to touch on something that
[42:32.400 --> 42:36.800]  i haven't heard a whole lot about lately which is the thing called climate change
[42:37.600 --> 42:43.280]  um i noticed uh we've been having a lot of like record cold temperatures and tons of snow and
[42:43.840 --> 42:50.480]  one thing uh i've paid attention to is the mainstream media has not um been reporting on
[42:50.480 --> 42:55.760]  tying that in with the um you know the weather the cold weather with the um climate change and i
[42:55.760 --> 43:03.040]  was wondering what your take was on that well look there are thousands and thousands of many
[43:03.040 --> 43:09.920]  climates i forget the number that's broken down by the different global atmospheric and
[43:10.480 --> 43:15.840]  oceanic organizations but there's thousands and thousands of many climates and subclimates
[43:15.840 --> 43:20.640]  and so you can always find places in the world that are going to be having record highs or record
[43:20.640 --> 43:26.400]  lows or record rainfall or record high seas especially because now there's more buoys and
[43:26.400 --> 43:31.040]  more satellites and more instruments reading all of this and so i want to be careful about saying
[43:31.040 --> 43:35.520]  that you know record cold since they've been recording temperatures in western europe in the
[43:35.520 --> 43:42.240]  last 350 plus years you know saying oh look it's not warming it's cooling uh but certainly they
[43:42.240 --> 43:47.040]  said warming warming warming warming they lied and said that when carbon dioxide goes up uh in
[43:47.040 --> 43:53.200]  the ice core samples that then temperature goes up temperature goes up then there's more life
[43:53.200 --> 43:59.440]  and the next 50 to 100 years it varies then carbon dioxide goes up which has been much higher
[44:00.560 --> 44:04.560]  every chance they get they always want to you know tie it into you know when there's weird
[44:04.560 --> 44:08.560]  weather anomalies they want well sure but i mean what they've done is they've shifted from
[44:08.560 --> 44:13.600]  global warming to climate change and then now they've even shifted to our deteriorating climate
[44:13.600 --> 44:16.800]  that came out the new york times about a year ago that they have internal talking points from
[44:16.800 --> 44:22.160]  the wirehouse and the un on this so they're just teaching people if it's cold it's your fault if
[44:22.160 --> 44:26.080]  it's hot it's your fault if there's a thunderstorm it's your fault meanwhile there's a whole nother
[44:26.080 --> 44:31.840]  part of this equation and that's all the governments and private corporations running around doing
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.880]  weather manipulation that's admitted but most of it is classified but the fact that massive
[44:36.880 --> 44:41.680]  programs are going on that's declassified and so how do we know a lot of this bizarre weather
[44:41.680 --> 44:46.400]  isn't being done intentionally or all the weather modification going on from the middle east to
[44:46.400 --> 44:51.120]  china to the us i mean every major country's doing it how do we know that isn't causing
[44:51.120 --> 44:56.080]  chain reactions in climate which we've had climatologists on to talk about you know i mean it
[44:56.080 --> 45:02.400]  may not even be intentional but what we do know is that human interaction with the environment
[45:02.400 --> 45:09.920]  dealing with climate is very small compared to main drivers like the sun other types of
[45:09.920 --> 45:15.040]  particles coming in from deep space that they know now for at least 20 years is what's forming
[45:15.040 --> 45:19.840]  the nuclei in the atmosphere so it's the weather in space that's the main driver then
[45:19.840 --> 45:26.400]  secondarily there's the moon which is controlling 76 percent of the earth's surface manipulating
[45:26.400 --> 45:31.920]  the tides which has a massive atmospheric effect and they debate whether it's the second biggest
[45:31.920 --> 45:36.560]  effect or the third because then there's the internal earth's magnetic field coming out the
[45:36.560 --> 45:42.320]  poles that's also causing serious atmospheric anomalies you know that's why we have the
[45:42.320 --> 45:48.320]  northern lights the aurora borealis but very good points anything else john yeah real quick i just
[45:48.320 --> 45:53.840]  wanted to request that maybe you can get some guests on your show um there was um uh Naomi
[45:53.840 --> 45:59.840]  wolf was one that i i listened to in uh over the years and she had some good key points and i thought
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.160]  maybe she could try to get her out as a guest you know we've had Naomi wolf on a few times
[46:04.160 --> 46:07.600]  she is a big liberal but she is against the police state and spoken out against obama
[46:07.600 --> 46:12.160]  and the last two times he tried to get her on she had phone problems each time and had to get off
[46:12.160 --> 46:17.440]  uh so we you know it's just what can you do if the phones don't work uh but i appreciate your call
[46:17.440 --> 46:26.320]  john uh lani in california you're on the year go ahead alex hey buddy hey how's it going how are you
[46:26.320 --> 46:34.960]  doing oh i just uh had a couple of uh well actually just mainly if uh you've really noticed the uh
[46:34.960 --> 46:44.320]  uh excuse me the predictive programming that's uh been going on lately uh mainly uh going on
[46:44.320 --> 46:52.320]  like talking about like the illuminati and stuff like uh basically uh what was it there's uh like
[46:52.320 --> 46:58.400]  a comic book uh like have you heard of the avengers no i really don't read a lot of comic books but
[46:58.400 --> 47:04.800]  i am aware that on tv and movies in marble comics it's just everywhere the illuminati the new world
[47:04.800 --> 47:09.760]  order is the hottest issue out there for many years now people are waking up to the secret ruling
[47:09.760 --> 47:14.880]  class the social engineers the priest class so the establishment is producing all of these
[47:14.880 --> 47:21.360]  movies and programs trying to spin it or saying that oh the statue of liberty is lucifer but it's
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.480]  the good lucifer you know we're seeing more and more of this you know they tried to just say
[47:26.480 --> 47:31.360]  none of it existed for so long but now because they can't just deny it they're basically trying to
[47:31.360 --> 47:38.080]  take it over uh and and and you know if they can't beat us join us but then spin it uh but that just
[47:38.080 --> 47:44.480]  shows how effective the alternative media has become yeah exactly that's uh that's what i'm totally
[47:44.480 --> 47:50.640]  seeing but uh i mean i did see the uh the uh watchman that came out a few years ago and that
[47:50.640 --> 47:58.880]  whole thing's illuminati at the end and it's true to the comic book uh the the uh the god man who's
[47:58.880 --> 48:08.160]  ascended uh what's his name mr manhattan he long uh he's teamed up with uh this other guy
[48:08.880 --> 48:14.640]  mazzy damn nameless i forget the name i only seen it once uh who's the lucifer type and he
[48:15.520 --> 48:21.680]  basically uses this this energy weapon to destroy a bunch of major cities to bring in world peace and
[48:21.680 --> 48:26.960]  to reduce world population and mr manhattan at the end says i do see what you've done now this is
[48:26.960 --> 48:32.720]  beautiful killing people in mass it made perfect sense and so basically any comic book movie i see
[48:32.720 --> 48:40.320]  has those uh those type of uh parallels in it yeah no exactly uh and also they're making a video
[48:40.320 --> 48:47.600]  game dealing with uh the illuminati the night's template and uh this other group i've never
[48:47.600 --> 48:52.880]  heard of personally but it's called the dragon and basically the whole point of the game is that it's
[48:52.880 --> 48:59.360]  uh one of those big uh like a kind of like world of warcraft but basically the object of the game
[48:59.360 --> 49:08.480]  is that you use these supposed uh you know powers of the illuminati or the night's template or the
[49:08.480 --> 49:15.440]  dragon for good for humanity to to help out well this is what this is what these mystery schools
[49:15.440 --> 49:21.040]  and the roja crucians and all branches of this do and i appreciate your call what they do is they
[49:21.040 --> 49:26.400]  bring people in to these different masonic orders and they say here is a group of questions about what
[49:26.400 --> 49:32.000]  you would do in moral situations and if you answer it in a moral way and you don't believe
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.240]  the end justifies the means and you're against enslavement and tyranny they go you're like the
[49:36.240 --> 49:41.360]  founding fathers you're the good guy you now are going to advance but then you really don't advance
[49:41.360 --> 49:45.760]  you become a porch mason or a porch night's template or a roza crucian it's all different
[49:45.760 --> 49:52.160]  flavors of the same kool-aid and then you go out and raise money and do good works and give them a
[49:52.160 --> 49:59.280]  front of good guys but if you do uh basically tie into their illuminati view of the injustice
[49:59.280 --> 50:04.240]  the means and you can do evil but also good it's all about the greater balance then you truly are
[50:04.240 --> 50:09.520]  advanced up into the higher degrees uh and orders and they do the same thing in the military the
[50:09.520 --> 50:15.360]  delta force i first heard limbaugh about 18 years ago cover this i was in college at the time
[50:15.360 --> 50:19.040]  just got out of high school listening to him and i heard him talk about yeah i got friends in delta
[50:19.040 --> 50:23.440]  force and what they do when uh they've already gone through all these courses and proven that
[50:23.440 --> 50:29.200]  they're the toughest out there and the smartest is they're given uh 10 hours at night after they're
[50:29.200 --> 50:35.360]  totally exhausted to read mackey of ellie's the prince and then they're given a questionnaire
[50:35.360 --> 50:42.480]  and if they and depending on how they answer that and how they write an essay on that that
[50:42.480 --> 50:46.800]  that's what's decided about where they'll be put in the organization and if you decide the end
[50:46.800 --> 50:51.600]  justifies the means go ahead and do horrible things for a greater good you're advanced and of
[50:51.600 --> 50:55.520]  course and then later i saw in mainstream news that was actually true uh but i mean that's just
[50:55.520 --> 51:02.480]  an example of what they do they're right back a more your call stay with us we all know that

[54:42.880 --> 54:48.480]  they have total gun bans in place there's one gun shop in the country for police to buy guns
[54:48.480 --> 54:55.200]  okay total gun ban and it is abject bedlam now later i'm going to get into this authority
[54:55.200 --> 55:01.120]  sphere cops being targeted after at least 11 officers shot in 24 hours but going over all
[55:01.120 --> 55:07.520]  these cases it's drug dealers or it's people angry that family had been sentenced uh to life in prison
[55:07.520 --> 55:13.920]  it's it's criminals that's why we have the guns is to protect ourselves we're an armed society
[55:13.920 --> 55:18.800]  nobody's going to change that we've always been a violent frontier society we need guns and you've
[55:18.800 --> 55:24.480]  seen the statistics that more than 20 times on average guns are used to stop or frustrate crime
[55:24.480 --> 55:28.640]  for every time they're used in a crime i mean look at the places that have total gun bans like
[55:28.640 --> 55:34.160]  chicago and new york highest crime rates in the country the criminals move there because only the
[55:34.160 --> 55:39.760]  citizens who are law abiding follow those unconstitutional rules but this is terrible that
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.120]  police officers are being killed everywhere but they're saying you know they don't think it's a
[55:43.120 --> 55:48.000]  fluke well what are you going to do as the mexican mafia and others start targeting police as they've
[55:48.000 --> 55:54.640]  done and some of this does appear to be connected to that so we're going to be breaking that down
[55:54.640 --> 56:00.240]  but certainly bad news and they're saying they're going to beef security up at police stations
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.760]  look if somebody's ready to give their life you can't stop them they could take all of the guns
[56:05.760 --> 56:18.080]  in america and i could with a shank take all the guns i ever wanted i mean with a do you know what
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.320]  a ball peen hammer will do i remember reading about world world war two i'm already getting
[56:22.320 --> 56:27.600]  into this i guess i remember in world war i'm reading about world war two and how uh they'd
[56:27.600 --> 56:33.520]  be having a you know warfare uh in the forest uh in and around the battle of the bulge but many
[56:33.520 --> 56:40.800]  other battles and the us troops would use ball peen hammers because when you snuck up on a machine
[56:40.800 --> 56:46.400]  gun in placement if you gun them all down you know the old special forces move is with the knife
[56:46.400 --> 56:51.520]  grab the grab around the face around the mouth so they can't yell stab them in the kidneys that
[56:51.520 --> 56:56.080]  tends to make people go into shock immediately that's not what the troops would do most of the time
[56:56.080 --> 57:01.520]  they would use a ball peen hammer uh in those special forces airborne type crews and they would
[57:01.520 --> 57:06.880]  just slam it down full power on somebody's head usually killing them but definitely knocking
[57:06.880 --> 57:13.280]  them out so i mean if they took all the guns what are you gonna do about a ball peen hammer
[57:13.280 --> 57:18.160]  you could take all the guns all the tanks all the weapons you ever wanted with a ball peen hammer
[57:19.120 --> 57:25.440]  period period a big heavy ball peen hammer is the equivalent of what knights would use
[57:25.440 --> 57:31.440]  in warfare of a trudgeon that maybe we should search engine a trudgeon or a mace a mace of
[57:31.440 --> 57:37.440]  course is a trudgeon on the end of a chain that you would swing around for effect uh but a trudgeon
[57:37.440 --> 57:44.160]  and the uh 21st century version of that is a heavy ball peen hammer so i don't want violence against
[57:44.160 --> 57:50.160]  government but we have a drug dealing corrupt society because of the drug war i saw statistics
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.240]  just a few days ago out of several european countries in fact we reprint that for me if you
[57:54.240 --> 57:59.680]  get a chance because i forget the exact nations it showed massive in fact one headline was country
[57:59.680 --> 58:05.920]  closing nine prisons because of lack of crime after decriminalizing drugs i mean you got people
[58:05.920 --> 58:10.480]  hopped up out of their minds it gives the criminal element something to make money out of it corrupts
[58:10.480 --> 58:16.720]  the police and most of this stuff in mexico and here in the u.s drug related take the money out of it
[58:18.080 --> 58:21.920]  i mean how many interviews have you seen where where drug dealers admit they don't want drugs
[58:21.920 --> 58:30.400]  to be criminalized the government's making money off of it as well so you can never take
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.880]  all the guns and stop either criminals or the citizens from doing whatever they want okay
[58:34.880 --> 58:38.720]  that's the way it is the only thing you can do is have guns to protect yourself from criminals
[58:38.720 --> 58:48.800]  we'll get right back this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:34.720]  i actually the stepfather my stepfather was a godfather of montreal so uh her daughter was my
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:40.960]  bright to be uh it's gino vendetti it's andrea vendetti those two people are not known at all
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:47.120]  from people from usual people that's the way it works the illuminati always have their best their
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:58.960]  best uh let's say uh players always hidden and uh imagine you know like gino vendetti the godfather
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:05.520]  of montreal and nobody in quebec but really the the inner circle knows that it's it's unbelievable
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:13.760]  how much yeah real money and power spends all its time trying to stay hidden yeah that's it and
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.440]  what i wanted to say okay first there's one thing industry the omerta the the the secrecy law doesn't
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:26.960]  concern me in quebec okay that's because people knows me people respect me so the what i say
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:35.360]  uh if ever i get to be killed it won't be by by the by the the street let's say okay so uh
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:42.320]  what i knew also was that the one of the elzangels because actually they were elzangels one of the
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:49.920]  elzangels one of the sixth ed of the elzangels in 1991 was bush senior and at that time well
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.800]  richard you're gonna have to send me an article on this or something uh if you want to go over

[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:08.880]  take a call here let's go ahead and talk to derrick in minnesota derrick you're on the earth thanks
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.240]  for calling hey no problem alex what's going on i thought you were talking to gsp for a second
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.640]  i don't know what what's gm oh george st pier he's a french canadian mma fighter i
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:25.680]  thought you might know because you pay attention to mix martial arts and now and then um many ways
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:34.240]  uh you had charlotte isabate i think on uh sometime recently yes and uh she wanted to go over uh the
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.560]  cnp issue and during that interview you actually claim that joel skellen agreed with her position
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:47.600]  on the cnp and that's completely incorrect actually joel skellen uh you had on previously and joel
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:53.600]  said that uh the group was intersexual and did nothing but collect fees and isabel said that
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:58.800]  there were nothing but dirty and that they're the uh the top of the republican party the dirtiest of
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.960]  the dirty uh players sure but i mean derrick you know you know like you imply she wanted to talk
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.840]  about it i had her on specifically uh for a second interview because at the end of a show
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.080]  when she was bringing it up and the show ended so i had her back up for more than 30 minutes to get
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:19.040]  into it then it went off into ronald reagan and i'm going from memory about what scowleson said
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:25.200]  um he was talking about conservative groups in washington i thought he'd said the cnp but we'll
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.560]  have him back up and bring that up to him you know i do three four hours of radio every day so it's
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:36.640]  it's i mean i'm i had her on to cover the subject i mean is there something wrong with that no not
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.240]  at all i think it's about time you talked about it i mean you've been covering it up for like how
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.960]  many years now people have tried to bring it up to you and you've claimed that it was a cfr-funded
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.920]  left-wing conspiracy theory and it was a big distraction well sir i'm above left-wing and
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.760]  right-wing and i do think the council and farm relations is more powerful than that conservative
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:59.440]  spinoff group uh but i mean people invent things to be controversies as drama queens people are so
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:04.480]  jealous of the show this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:09.840]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.960]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:20.480]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:26.240]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.680]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:36.160]  a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related

[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:32.080]  big phone blitz of interviews we did it through the production company we'll see if he shows up
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.240]  for the show because when they when they've got him doing 20 30 interviews they routinely get late
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:42.720]  but that's scheduled here in about 23 minutes from now he should be joining us here on air
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:49.680]  because coming up in two nights from now thursday night is the bohemian grove special and
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:56.720]  i agreed to not get into a lot of it but i told them and they agreed that if you know if i got
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.960]  arrested obviously i was going to talk about it or people got arrested i had to provide so that i
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:07.200]  could talk about it obviously before it came out well i didn't get arrested two of their hosts did
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:16.080]  get arrested and i had to go jump in the river um and and and i wasn't even inside the bohemian grove
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.240]  i was on the edge of it at the watermark but i knew they were still going to try to arrest me and
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.520]  they were uh and trump stuff up so i got out of there and i'm just going to leave it at that but
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.720]  we'll see how much of it he wants to get into but i also want to talk to him about his
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.840]  new book the inner circle and how he's good buddies with george herbert walker bush uh
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.360]  you know i sort of dread what's going to come out on the show tonight from now but i always take
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.080]  the field or most of the time i do sometimes i don't do big mainstream interviews anymore but
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.400]  even though i know a lot of times this stuff could be a setup i just can't not take the challenge
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:58.480]  and went out to california and it was quite a quite an event but we'll see what ends up airing
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.680]  thursday night with this coming out but uh he didn't announce to the world until about two
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:06.960]  weeks ago that he's good buddies with george herbert walker bush and that he's part of the inner
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:12.400]  circle and there's a photo of him in us today doing this hand sign in front of one of the
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:17.040]  government buildings that's a temple it's got the big pyramid behind him i'm going to ask him about
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.720]  all of that um coming up in a friendly way uh coming up obviously too big uh reports out
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:34.160]  uh right now and that's ventura strikes back with lawsuit against tsa top story on drudge
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.040]  our article from info wars dot com and ventura lawsuit tsa patdowns classified as unlawful sexual
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.600]  abuse and i will be covering that article that i haven't gotten to uh later but melzer's coming up
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.520]  and uh we had a caller earlier wanting me to talk about the cmp so you want it you got it i'm
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.560]  going to bring it up to phyllis schlafly when she comes up on the show in the last 30 minutes and
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:02.720]  some other issues i tried to get into it last time but she got on the show 15 minutes late
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.520]  and so we only had about 10 minutes with her uh but i'm going to bring that up because you know
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.880]  people say well bring this up about israel so i do or bring this up about the vatican so i do
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.360]  bring this up and then it's like when i do bring it up you're see you're bad and i'm just like what
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.080]  i mean i mean it's crazy and and and and that's what some folks do they go well alex jones is
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:26.160]  interviewing jewish people he must work for israel or alex jones is interviewing catholics he must
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.800]  work for him as if catholics or jews are bad or as if i'm not allowed to interview people or alex
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:36.560]  interviewed somebody that was part of the cfr or the cmp or alex jones had had the air of the
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:42.320]  wroth child fortune on you bet i did and if other talk show hosting people that are jealous of this
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:47.920]  show and the fact that we reach millions of people would learn journalistic skill they could do that
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.760]  see um four years ago i saw that david the wroth child heir to the richest fortune on the planet
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.360]  i had a new children's book out about environmentalism and basically hating yourself
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.520]  and turning everything over to the wroth child carbon trading company we called this is how
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:08.320]  producers do it for those that don't know we called the publisher and we said when are they
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.760]  going to do a promotions blitz just like brad melzer's doing right now and they said oh he's
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:19.680]  doing one on earth day and we can give you 10 minutes he's doing about 15 interviews that day
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:26.000]  and we said yes we want to promote his book yes and so they just dial the number put him on the
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.480]  phone he's like who is this right before we go live i go oh it's alex jones you guys wait alex
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:36.000]  jones i've heard of you and then we go live and then i start blasting him on air so he stayed on
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.760]  trying to defend himself i rip him to pieces i put it in the film in game and that's proof that i'm
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:48.640]  a wroth child agent because i was able to get him on the show or i work for pat bucanon because i um
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:56.400]  in the early 1990s was actually in 92 and then again a little bit 96 george humphrey who was
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.000]  waking up to the new world order city council member who'd been a liberal he was supporting
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.600]  pat bucanon because he was hentine after him get and then i have pat bucanon on it's like
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:09.760]  everything pat bucanon ever stood for you stand with him it's just mental illness uh and and
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:15.680]  it's about making everything about alex jones and not about the information i'm covering exposing
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:20.960]  the tsa takeover exposing the martial law preparations exposing the banking takeover
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.560]  exposing what's happening all over the world exposing the move towards uh anti gun you know
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:33.520]  that's what this show is about is about issues uh but um just incredible absolutely incredible
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:39.520]  if you didn't hear that last caller it's funny i have i have um phyllis schlafly coming on and i plan
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.120]  to even ask her about that and that'll just be more proof i'm evil because i know how to pick a
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:47.680]  telephone up and get someone on the show i mean this is a real radio show we're actually on big
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:53.600]  affiliates all over the country we we call and get guest on i i have a big crew i mean it's it's
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:14:00.560]  it's just lie upon lie upon lie upon lie i mean i i see these endless lies put out by people that
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:08.240]  genesis is owned by some saudi arabian uh they say genesis is owned by a porno company because
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:14.480]  there's a genesis porno magazine and production house uh people say we're owned by abc because
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:18.640]  about all the satellites we've leased that you could call and lease one of them was abc for a
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:24.160]  few years because that's what stations pick us up off of this is disinformation and it's put out by
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.640]  people counting probably government in most cases counting on people's ignorance manipulating
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.200]  their ignorance to try to distract from what we're doing but i should be glad this is going on it
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.200]  means we're having a huge effect i should be glad that nightline's demonizing me and i should be glad
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:47.040]  that msnbc and cnn are demonizing me and saying i'm dangerous and evil because it means we're doing
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:51.040]  the right thing it means we're having an effect now not to be distracted any further but that is
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:56.800]  an important lesson for folks i want to get into some news uh here for folks right now first let's
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:15:00.880]  get into the state of the union i'll cover this more coming up in the first half of the next
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:06.400]  hour but i want to get to it now uh exclusive president obama to propose budget freeze and
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:11.760]  earmarks ban tonight uh yeah we'll see if they actually implement that he he's always proposed
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:15.840]  a lot of things and sung a good song let's see if he actually dances to the tune if he walks the
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:22.000]  walk of the talk uh so we've got that also obama's speech will target spending and a divided congress
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:29.440]  that's cnn and he's going to basically tell everyone that america's problems same stuff we saw
[01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:34.160]  for the tucson shooting with his staged pep rally there all the america's problems aren't the banking
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.720]  cartel aren't the new world order it's us it's the american people and our rhetoric and that
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.600]  we're angry at each other and leberman's in the news saying america's being discredited worldwide
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:49.360]  because of our vitriol no people worldwide see america standing up against tyranny and the patriot
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.480]  act and the tsa and the illegal wars and the warrantless wiretapping and say america may still
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:16:02.480]  be good people are saying no to this chinese style police state but again they try to put it off on
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.480]  us the people and make the debate about how we're causing problems we're causing shootings we're causing
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:14.160]  violence there's also a story out of politico white house says berthers aren't rational
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:21.360]  and it goes on to say that gibbs confirmed that they will be bringing up gun control
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:27.840]  as part of the state of the union tonight so nbc was right last week when they said that
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:32.800]  that's the word that victim disarmament and then attack on the second amendment not just an attack
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.840]  on the first and saying sit down shut up they're trying to tell the congress people to sit together
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:43.600]  now to not sit divided in their houses the founders said gridlock was good they said a separation of
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.440]  powers was good so you couldn't get a dictator you couldn't get a hitler or a napoleon or something
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:54.080]  like that because of the separation of powers the different powerful groups would fight with each other
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.000]  and never be able to consolidate power they understood human nature so gibbs is now uh
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:04.880]  saying that he's also saying berthers aren't uh rational and they've peaked everybody's interest
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.720]  with the governor of hawaii saying i'm going to release it and then coming out a month later
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:13.920]  and saying actually i can't find it uh is it true what some have said that they may produce
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:19.840]  the original birth certificate soon is some type of coup to uh to boost his approval rating will
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:27.360]  it be real if he releases it also we now know one of the new spin terms that they're going to be
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:34.720]  uh issuing uh at this uh state of the union propaganda piece tonight there's a republican
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:43.200]  term that's copyrighted websites used by republicans uh in oregon and it's win the future so just
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:52.000]  another spin on uh hope and change um continuing here supreme court justices could be no shows
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.720]  for obama state of the union fox news just one day before president obama state of the union
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:01.840]  this came out last night uh it's still not clear whether chief justice john roberts will attend
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:07.840]  or like high court justice samuel elito skipped the event and it says that they may do that because
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:14.000]  of obama's rebuke of the justices which was unprecedented uh at the last state of the union
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:23.280]  so we've uh got uh that report as well there uh continuing looking at the violence uh around
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:31.520]  the world most of it drug related when you decriminalize drugs it takes almost all the
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:35.760]  money out of it and so now there's not all these violent wars over the drug money your
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:40.320]  police don't get corrupted like they got corrupted on record during alcohol prohibition in the 10
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:45.360]  years of prohibition there and here's a headline drug friendly netherlands to close eight prisons
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.880]  i said nine earlier i was going for memory uh not enough crime the crime has dropped so much
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:55.920]  because of drug decriminalization they're having to shut prisons meanwhile the u.s is the capital of
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:19:02.240]  prisons worldwide even outstripping authoritarian china uh here's fox news authority sphere cops
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:08.800]  being targeted after at least 11 officers shot dead in 24 hours going over these cases in michigan
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.280]  and many other places most of them appear to be crime or drug related and so it's basically
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:20.480]  street thug mafia type hits retaliations on police the same thing that we see in mexico uh
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.240]  going on and again we have a new report out of mexico from cnn mexican police gunman opened fire
[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:32.720]  at soccer game seven dead uh the answer to this happening is for the police to be armed and to
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:38.880]  protect themselves uh and to be able to profile real criminals not be busy out there revenue
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.520]  generating on the general population and keeping the prisons filled with nonviolent offenders
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.960]  instead of keeping thugs like this in jail these people all had priors from what i was reading
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:54.080]  so we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen uh we're going to get into carnegie endowment
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.480]  touts green credentials of gingers con for slaughtering 40 million people stay with us

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:47.440]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. They aren't as empty as my conscience seems to be.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:59.440]  I have hours only, lonely. My love is vengeance.
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:07.440]  It's hard to turn that off, isn't it? The one and only, the who. Meet the new boss, famous the old boss. Won't get fooled again.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:15.440]  No one knows what it's like to feel these feelings like I do.
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:23.440]  Coming up later in the next hour, I'm going to get into the economy in Ventura lawsuit. TSA Patdown's classified as unlawful sexual abuse.
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:29.440]  Coming out and calling a spade a spade. Calling a duck a duck. Calling this sexual abuse what it is.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:39.440]  And I've even heard the state police in Texas to give them some kudos that I rarely do. I heard the head of the state police just a few months ago go on and testify that this is wrong.
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:47.440]  A sworn police officer, unless it's an emergency, can't stick their hands down your pants, can't grope you. This is illegal. That's wrong.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.440]  That's exactly what Ventura is saying, so we're going to be breaking that down.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:59.440]  But continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, we need more prominent people to be heard, to speak up, to stand up.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:06.440]  I routinely get calls from top musicians in the world. I routinely get calls from Hollywood people.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:11.440]  And nine times out of ten, they don't want to go on air. They just want to say, we appreciate your work. We're supporting you.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.440]  But they're not going that extra mile of lending their celebrity to the issue to give it attention.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.440]  Ventura is doing that. But he's doing it because his rights are being violated and he will not fly through this.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:29.440]  But I recently got an amazing call that I'm not going to talk about until I have more discussions with him from some household name.
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:40.440]  And we'll see if we're able to get them on the show. And then all of their hundreds of millions of fans, and it doesn't get any bigger than this, will then, you know, tune into this truth.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:47.440]  I mean, this music group dwarfs a wonderful group like Muse.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:51.440]  So we know we're fans of the show and we love the music. And Mr. Bellamy has been on the show.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:57.440]  And the only news links he has on his websites are infowars.com and prismplanet.com and our Auxiliary.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:02.440]  The Propaganda Matrix, Paul Watson's backup site.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:05.440]  But it just, I know so many names, so many people.
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.440]  And it's all like, oh, look, I know a bunch of famous people. It's wow. That's just another cross-reference of society.
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:16.440]  How many people are awake? But it doesn't get any bigger.
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:24.440]  It doesn't get any bigger. And I just constantly have to deal with this. Just huge people.
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:31.440]  But again, I don't know if they want to go on the show yet. I'm going to move slow on that.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:36.440]  And I know they're probably listening right now, so I want to say hi and appreciate the great music you're sending us.
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:42.440]  And I can't wait to hear it. I can't believe there's going to be a shout-out in the new album to this show.
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.440]  It's just absolutely incredible. People won't believe it.
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.440]  But I guess you've seen all the folks we've had on, you know, Willie Nelson.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.440]  I mean, the list goes on and on. A great people that recognize tyranny.
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:28:00.440]  And I mean, this is as big as Willie Nelson. And in pop culture, really bigger.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:07.440]  All right, I'm not going to give away any more. I can't give away any more. I'm going to leave it right there.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:11.440]  But it shows how many people are awake. It's so exciting.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.440]  Okay, here's some of the other news. Renewed push to give Obama an Internet kill switch.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:23.440]  And this is out of CBS News. I mean, there they are. Just a kill switch.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:28.440]  And Lieberman is pushing for open restrictions on free speech, open restrictions on the Internet,
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.440]  giving the government total surveillance power and the power to shut off anything they don't want.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:41.440]  And we're still investigating it last night, but it looks like we may have had someone hack in yet again to infowars.com
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:47.440]  and start erasing and pulling down and editing and butchering Aaron Dyke's article on Venturi.
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:53.440]  It would have been done at midnight last night. He fought with this all night long to finally get it up this morning.
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:58.440]  It would go up. People would comment. It'd be pulled down. And we don't think it's our caching systems.
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:07.440]  I hope it wasn't a hack. We've had admitted many attempted hacks and we know it's government affiliated corporations and grips that are doing that.
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:12.440]  We've got some great hackers that are helping us try to secure things. We've done a better job at that.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.440]  But we're certainly under attack, but it makes you feel a lot better inside.
[01:29:16.440 --> 01:29:20.440]  It gives you a warm feeling to know there are so many great people out there, average folks.
[01:29:20.440 --> 01:29:29.440]  It almost made me cry when I was at a fireworks shop on New Year's evening buying some fireworks to go out in the county and shoot them off.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:36.440]  And a father, well, this little boy ran up and just had like stars in his eyes, but in a loving way, loving liberty.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.440]  And said, thank you for what you're doing, Alex. And I shook his dad's hand.
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:45.440]  And I got in my car and started crying a little bit just because it's just such a responsibility to be able to reach out to so many people.
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:49.440]  Whether they're movie stars or just folks in the street, I just love you all.
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:51.440]  I love that you love liberty.
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:30:20.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:28.440]  The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.440]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:39.440]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:43.440]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.440]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:31:00.440]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number three.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America3.com.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:06.440]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June of 2009.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:16.440]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:21.440]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:30.440]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect. They both make fabulous investments.
[01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:35.440]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.440]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:49.440]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term. This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[01:32:20.440 --> 01:32:28.440]  Number 3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:35.440]  Number 4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:45.440]  Number 5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.

[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:23.440]  We are live and Brad Meltzer, best-selling author of a long string of books. His newest one is The Inner Circle.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:31.440]  And Brad Meltzer.com is the website, and they've got their Secret Societies episode set to air on Thursday night on the History Channel.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:41.440]  And I don't know how much of this we can get into, but I was bringing these points up during the break when we just got him on a few minutes ago. We got a lot to talk about.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:48.440]  But Brad, tell us about the show. Tell us about why you guys contacted yours truly to be part of your Secret Society episode.
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:34:03.440]  Yeah, listen, at the end of the day, we were going to do this episode we wanted to do on the Ultimate Secret Society, better to me than Skull and Bones, better to me than Freemasonry, better to me than, you know, because it exists today, and that is to look at Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:13.440]  And our job on Decoded Every Week, you know, History Channel came to me and said, give us your 10 best mysteries, conspiracies, and we'll give you a team to look at them and try and figure them out.
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:22.440]  And that's what we do every week, Thursday nights, as you know, at 10 o'clock and 9 central. And when we started looking at this one, we said, OK, what's the best modern Secret Society?
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:29.440]  And it really is Bohemian Grove. And as we looked around to say, OK, who's the expert on this place? Who knows? And who's been inside?
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:38.440]  Yours truly, you know, yourself was the name that kept coming up and up and up. And my buddy Noah is actually one of your biggest fans. He lives in Austin, and he loves you.
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:46.440]  And he basically was like, you know, you got to talk to us. Everyone knew it was a list of one. And you were the guy who got inside and took the footage.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:56.440]  So, you know, for the people who are listening, you're going to see not only the voice of Alex, you're going to see him running around with our team who goes out there in the field and tries to get back into Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.440]  And it is, I think you know Alex was one of the, had to be at least one of the best adventures he had this year.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:09.440]  Now, you're not, you told me during the break, you're not sure yet what the final cut is even going to be, because that's how it works with the production crew.
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:16.440]  How much can we talk about with what happened there and History Channel not wanting folks to see my footage inside?
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:27.440]  You know, you know what happens? It's not that they actually, they would love you for everyone to see it. And they actually, we put the whole episode together and cut it together with your footage in there.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:35.440]  You see everything that happens with you. You see it, you know, you guys trying to get in, you see, I don't want to ruin the episode, but I will tell you, you'll see some of the team going to jail.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:43.440]  I'll leave it at that. And you know, we'll let people see how it happens. But what happened was, I actually recorded the full version, you know, with the footage.
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:53.440]  And History wanted to go because it's the best footage. Let's be honest, right? It's incredible. The problem is, is that the footage was, and I know you know this as well,
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:02.440]  but the footage because of California's hidden camera laws, there are legal issues about airing what they consider still to be obtained with a hidden camera.
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:06.440]  But this is 10 years old. I don't think that law is retroactive.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:11.440]  I couldn't tell you, you know, I actually don't know the law about it.
[01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:18.440]  Also, this was an event with hundreds of world leaders setting policy secretly. They admit that in the lakeside chats.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:21.440]  So I think the lawyers are wrong, but I know they're airing on the side of caution.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:25.440]  Yeah, they're airing on the side of caution. The good news is, is I actually, there's no hiding what happened.
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.440]  I actually, to make sure, I was so determined to make sure that the footage be seen.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:37.440]  That what I do, and I know this is in the show, is no matter what, if the footage isn't in there, is I actually physically describe everything that's in the footage you gave us.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:43.440]  So there's no hiding, you know, what happened or what the, you know, the owl or what he says.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.440]  I'm told they did incredible, I heard they did incredible storyboards.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:50.440]  Oh, is that what they did? They actually did a storyboard?
[01:36:50.440 --> 01:36:51.440]  That's what I was told, yeah.
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:37:00.440]  Oh, good, I hope so, because what they did is, is they were like, I knew that they delayed the episode from running, because they were fighting to make sure the footage gets in there.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:05.440]  And I kept saying, listen, if you don't have the footage, you lose the best part of the show, because when people see it, it blows your mind, right?
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:14.440]  It's like, you go, what is that? And that was my favorite part of watching that footage, because you're like, oh my gosh, is that Walter Cronkite's voice coming out of a giant owl?
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:20.440]  And I said to them, can you guys do, whether it's animation or some other way around it?
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:26.440]  So if they did storyboards, that'll be even better. I actually will tell you, I 100% recorded in case everything went to pot.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:30.440]  I physically described it on air, so that we didn't lose that.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:35.440]  Well, also, we've got the people going to jail, so there's all that new incredible stuff.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:41.440]  Oh, you see everything. Oh yeah, there's no hiding. I mean, we used, that's what the best part of the episode, and this I have seen.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:45.440]  I've seen the footage, is when you guys try and get inside, and what happens as a result.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:52.440]  It is, and it is on camera, and you see everyone, and the good part is you even see the Bohemian Grove guy who tried to first turn your way.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:38:02.440]  I guess he signed, he amazingly signed the release, so that when he sees you the second time, even though you know he doesn't want to be on camera at that moment, but he's on camera.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.440]  Well, to be clear, the day before I got there, or the day I got there, they went to the front gate.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:19.440]  He came up, they videotaped him, he's the head of security, he signed the release, and the next day, we go up from the river, and then that was a whole other issue, but that's coming up Thursday evening.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:26.440]  Yeah, it's good stuff, man. I think people are going to go like, wow, that's spectacular.
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:38.440]  It's not, it's not, it's right there, right at the front gate, right on the river, you see everything, and you see him coming out of jail, and you see Buddy, I mean, it's amazing footage, and it's amazing that they caught it all on tape.
[01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:45.440]  Absolutely, now is, I haven't seen the footage, is my escape jumping in the river on there?
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:57.440]  I saw your escape, your escape is awesome. You moved fast for a man of such young age, I was impressed. It was pretty impressive.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:09.440]  The funniest part of the whole thing is, you know that if they want to get anyone right there, you're the one they want to nab, you're the guy who gets away, which is, you know, just again, incredible to see it all play out.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:21.440]  But I saw everything, and the clip that I saw, you see everything, and I think the only question was is, you know, can you once, once the laws get broken, how much of it you can show, but you see everything leading up to it.
[01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.440]  I saw the footage of you actually getting away. I actually don't know.
[01:39:26.440 --> 01:39:43.440]  Well, I must have looked like a total clown though, because the canoe company made me wear the quote, waterproof baggy clothes, and then they weren't waterproof, all the water went down, and so it was all hanging, like five, six pounds of water off of me, and I'm just hot tailing it.
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:51.440]  But we've only got about eight minutes left with you, and Brad, promise me that sometime in the near future I can have you for a full 30 minutes or so.
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:57.440]  Listen, we should talk about it, because it's fun, and I want to hear what you think of the episode, so we should definitely talk again.
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:09.440]  Absolutely. Now listen, I told folks that I went out to California, and I said it was Bohemian Grove, but I said I'm not getting into anything that happened, and I said they seem like good folks, and it seems like it's going to be fair.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:24.440]  But then, you're in USA today, and we'll put the photo up on screen, saying I'm part of the secret circle, or I mean I'm part of the inner circle, and you're doing this Masonic hand sign in front of a temple, a Masonic temple, which is the National Archives.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:32.440]  You've got the big pyramid behind you, and then I'm like, whoa, what have I gotten myself into, so I'd like you to respond to that.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:39.440]  Yeah, no, the best part of that, I mean, it was great, because my wife said, you were making a Freemason pose, and I'm like, I was where?
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  And she goes, on USA Today, dummy, I mean that is just news to me, and anyone who knows me knows I'm not a Freemason.
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:51.440]  We take our cameras and went right into Freemason headquarters, and we filmed everything there.
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:55.440]  We have no problems showing, asking the hard questions.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:03.440]  I had no idea, if I were a Freemason, I guess I would know what I was doing, but I had no idea. They just basically said, make a couple poses, you know, try and look calm.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:07.440]  They wanted me to sit down with my legs crossed, and so they wanted me to pose in front of the National Archives.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:14.440]  My novel's about the National Archives, so of course that's where I was standing, but I love the fact that people think that I'm somehow sending secret messages.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.440]  Well, perhaps.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.440]  I guess that should be my new goal in life.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:23.440]  Yeah, perhaps USA Today, one of their people was an illuminist, and they were asking you to do those poses, you're saying?
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:27.440]  You know, the camera guy just said, just do something different, and I was like, okay, I'll put my hands together.
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:30.440]  You know, there's one where I'm sitting down, and I'm holding my knees.
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:33.440]  The truth was, they just liked the picture.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:36.440]  I mean, if there is a great conspiracy, these guys are good.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:38.440]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  Then I learned that you've done NPR interviews and others saying that George Herbert Walker Bush was basically the incentive, or was involved somehow, influencing your new book,
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:58.440]  the Inner Circle, and that, you know, he's going to write you little letters and things.
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:00.440]  I mean, this is the Grand Pubaugh.
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:07.440]  One of the Grand Pubaugh's a Bohemian Grove, and reportedly has been involved in some of the rituals before.
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:10.440]  And how did you get to know George Herbert Walker Bush?
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:18.440]  You know, I got a letter a couple years ago that said he read my novel Millionaires, and I'm on his time in a copy for me.
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:22.440]  And you know what, you're the President of the United States. I'll send you a free book.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440]  I'll send you a coloring book. I'll send you any kind of book you want.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:27.440]  You know, and I was, you know, just being truthful.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.440]  I never hide my sources.
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:33.440]  You know, I got a letter from Clinton a couple years back also saying that he liked one of the novels.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  And when you write novels and you write thrillers, I don't care whatever anyone thinks of them.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.440]  When the President of the United States says they like your book, that's a cool day.
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:43.440]  That's a good day.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:50.440]  Well, that's like Ronald Reagan endorsing Tom Clancy, and he came from nowhere to being, you know, a guy that's made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:56.440]  Yeah, I mean, but you know, but does that mean George Bush influences, you know, that they, I mean, you know, let's be clear.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.440]  You know, what happened was, is I was writing a book.
[01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:04.440]  I got a call from the Department of Homeland Security a couple years ago, and they asked me to come in and brainstorm different ways that terrorists could attack us.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.440]  And what happened was, I guess I had seen in my novels, I do this, you know, I reveal a lot of stuff.
[01:43:08.440 --> 01:43:10.440]  I show where the secret tunnels are below the White House.
[01:43:10.440 --> 01:43:15.440]  I like to go after the truth. I like to find things that are hidden and show them to the public.
[01:43:15.440 --> 01:43:19.440]  And I guess they read the novels and said, this guy's research is good. They have me come in.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:25.440]  And I was taken by the fact that of all the people they could get, they were taking regular people like myself.
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  And I said, where does that start?
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:30.440]  And I actually traced it back to of all people, another President named George Washington.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:34.440]  And George Washington, amazingly, had his own personal spy ring.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:40.440]  And the spy ring, you know, he sent invisible ink messages. They sent secret coded messages to each other.
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:41.440]  Cyphers.
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:43.440]  Yeah, it was Cyphers, exactly.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.440]  But he also wrote letters about the Illuminati trying to take over Masonry.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:53.440]  Yeah, he did write about the Illuminati and some of his old letters, and he did, and he actually was a Mason, to be clear.
[01:43:53.440 --> 01:43:54.440]  I mean, he was a Freemason.
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:44:03.440]  But what was amazing to me is, in this particular case, rather than asking Freemasons, he said, give me regular ordinary citizens because of my spy ring.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.440]  That's who no one will look at. No one will notice them.
[01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:07.440]  You know, when you get the military guys, people look for them.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:09.440]  And I was so taken by that.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.440]  I said to George Bush, and I said to my guy in Homeland Security, who I was talking to, I said, for my new novel,
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:19.440]  wouldn't it be cool if you found out that George Washington's spy ring still existed to this very day?
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  And he said to me, what makes you think it doesn't?
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:23.440]  I said, what are you talking about?
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.440]  I said, think about it.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:26.440]  He says, you know, it's George Washington's spy ring.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:29.440]  It was one of the great success stories of the Revolutionary War.
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:37.440]  Hey, we know Nixon had spy rings, so you're telling me that you've had presidents tell you, hey, wink, wink, they're still spy rings.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.440]  I mean, I'm not trying to give you the third degree.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.440]  No, it wasn't Bush.
[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:45.440]  It was actually a guy, you know, a guy said to me, you know, saying, wink, wink, no, I don't want to be a cool plot for the book.
[01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  But here's the thing is, I actually went to former President Bush and I said, you know, is it true?
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:51.440]  You know, could you have?
[01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.440]  I said to him, flat out, sir.
[01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:56.440]  I said, you know, would it be, for my novel, I'm researching George Washington's spy ring.
[01:44:56.440 --> 01:44:58.440]  Could it still exist today?
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:04.440]  I said to him, you know, and the message is, when every president leaves office, they leave a secret note for the president who follows them.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:10.440]  So Reagan left one for Bush, Bush left one for Clinton, Cleveland left one, you know, on and on.
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:13.440]  So I said to him, could you send the secret messages in those notes?
[01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.440]  And I get an email back that comes from Bush and it says, the president wants you to see this.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440]  I don't know what's attached to it.
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:26.440]  I open up the document and attached to the document, Bush has sent me the secret letter that he wrote to Bill Clinton.
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:28.440]  And Alex, my first thought is, oh my gosh, he sent me a secret code.
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.440]  There's a cipher.
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:32.440]  So I start checking to see whether there's freemason code in it.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:35.440]  I start checking to see whether there's Thomas Jefferson's old code in it.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:38.440]  I check to see if every third letter of every word spells out, I hate you, Bill.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:39.440]  I'm like, what's the story here?
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.440]  And the truth was, it was actually, I've still tried to crack the thing.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.440]  If any of you are readers, I'll be happy to send you the letter if you want to try and crack it.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:49.440]  But there's no code in it as far as I can find.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.440]  It was really just this generous letter saying, you know, I wish you the best of luck.
[01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:56.440]  Sure, but I mean, obviously you're, you're charmed or you've hit the zeitgeist.
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:03.440]  You got all these presidents writing you, you know, influencing your book, Bush senior, Scullin' Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:03.440 --> 01:46:10.440]  And then, you know, in the headline in USA Today, Brad Meltzer is part of the inner circle.
[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:15.440]  Man, I tell you, I can't wait to have you back up for a longer interview.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:21.440]  And I'm, you were telling me off air that I, that you think I come off looking pretty good, but you haven't seen the final cut.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.440]  I'm just, I'm just certainly holding my breath here a little bit.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:30.440]  What time does it air coming up Thursday evening, Eastern Time on History?
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:33.440]  It's 10 o'clock Eastern Time, 9 o'clock Central Time.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:39.440]  But you know, here's the thing, Alex, is if, if I were, you know, if, if, if the, if the, you know, the one guy on the internet who says,
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:45.440]  man, Brad Meltzer's in with George Bush, if I were in with George Bush, why would I be doing an episode on Bohemian Grove and having you come on?
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:47.440]  I was about to say, he may not like that.
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:52.440]  That'll be the last thing I should write, isn't that the last thing I should ever do? And you watch, I can tell you one thing,
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.440]  watch my remarks at the end of this episode. And it's not, it ain't a love letter to Bohemian Grove.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:02.440]  You're going to see. I mean, I, I can tell you right now what I said at the end of it, because I'll tell you, I mean, I'm not ashamed to say it,
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:08.440]  is I think, you know, on the episode, you'll see that the, that the three people who are in the episode, they're kind of like, you know what,
[01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:11.440]  I understand Bohemian Grove a little better now, maybe we're a little hard on them.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.440]  But I actually come on on the other episode and I say flat out, right to the audience, I say, listen,
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:19.440]  here's the thing I don't like, I'm going to disagree with my team here.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:26.440]  And, and for one moment to say that, you know, what I don't like about Bohemian Grove is simply the idea that some people get more say than other people.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.440]  And that's not the American system to me.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:29.440]  Sure.
[01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:35.440]  And, and you know, that's just not like, I like the idea, you know, our, our democracy is built by being transparent and being things can be seen,
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:41.440]  not in, not in any other way. And, and that smell, I'm not saying it's definitely happening, but that smell,
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:46.440]  but you feel like some people are getting more say than others, rubs me the wrong way.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  It's, it's the secret room.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:51.440]  And listen, I don't mind being criticized that they're being debate.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  I think that makes a good informative show.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.440]  So I got thick skin.
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:55.440]  I'm a tough guy.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:01.440]  I'm just seeing, you know, all these major power brokers that you're involved with that are then involved in Bohemian Grove.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:02.440]  We're going to find out.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:03.440]  And, and you know what?
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.440]  I believe your perspective.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.440]  I believe that you believe this is fair and riveting.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:08.440]  And I'm honored to be part of the show.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:13.440]  We'll find out exactly what happens Thursday because even you haven't seen the exact final cut.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.440]  I know networks tweak things to the very end.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.440]  It's a bread.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.440]  Meltzer.com.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:21.440]  The inner circle is his latest thriller already a best seller.
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.440]  And we'll link this interview up at info wars.com.
[01:48:23.440 --> 01:48:30.440]  And Brad, after I've seen the episode, please come on with us in the next few weeks so we can hash it over,
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:32.440]  but also talk about some of the other episodes.
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:33.440]  But thanks for including me.
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.440]  Yeah, I don't know. I seriously tell your guy, I mean, he has my contact before I've been straight up with him.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:41.440]  And you know, that a time, man, because I think you're going to be really pleased.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  Okay, well, we'll, we'll, you know, Friday, call your people and try to set something up next week, Brad.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:47.440]  Brad, thank you so much.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:49.440]  Thank you so much for the time.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  I'll speak to you, brother.
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:54.440]  All right, there goes Brad Meltzer.
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:57.440]  I mean, again, the crew all seemed nice.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:02.440]  He seemed nice, but there was a few little creepy things going on, obviously.
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:03.440]  And we'll see what happens.
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:06.440]  But you can see he's a slick, well-spoken guy.
[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  And I don't really watch any television as folks know.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  I watch kind of boil downs on YouTube or on the web or what my crew brings me.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:17.440]  I watch movies on my DVD player.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.440]  And that's about it when I jog or when I watch a late night movie with my wife.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  But I haven't seen all these promos airing, but I was on a radio interview earlier today.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.440]  And they were bringing up, hey, we see all over TV with this history channel promo.
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:35.440]  So maybe we should go to the decoded site on history and see the trailer because I've been told there is one.
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.440]  And I'm sure it'll be the newest thing up there playing the promo.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:42.440]  And let's try to get a little bird's-eye view or a snapshot idea.
[01:49:42.440 --> 01:49:44.440]  And we'll air it coming up the next hour.
[01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:50.440]  We're able to find it of what's coming up Thursday night, 10 o'clock Eastern, 9 o'clock Central.
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  But, you know, I told them no on the Statue of Liberty episode.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:50:00.440]  And I said, no, I knew they had Mark Dyson involved who I like, but I just said, no, I'm not doing it.
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:01.440]  No, I'm not doing it.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.440]  And then they called me and said, please go to Bohemian Grove.
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:07.440]  And I said, when is the date?
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:08.440]  And they said, here's the date.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:15.440]  And it was like three days before or two days before I was scheduled and had agreed to speak in Santa Cruz.
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.440]  I tentatively agree.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  We were looking at that date and I said, boom, that's it.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.440]  I will travel for that.
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:22.440]  I love doing multiple things, you know, on the same trip.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.440]  And it was a circus.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.440]  And I was not going to jail.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:37.440]  I had to get back down the coast 100 miles or 90 miles to Santa Cruz to speak to two sold out houses of 800 people per night.
[01:50:37.440 --> 01:50:39.440]  And they ended up cramming other hundreds.
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  It was really about 900 each night or 1800 in the two speeches.
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.440]  I gave a Saturday and Sunday evening.
[01:50:44.440 --> 01:50:47.440]  And so, boom, I got out of there.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:50.440]  But they did not get out of there and they went to jail.
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.440]  But I didn't trespass, I only went up to the water line.
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:51:22.440]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen with a bunch of other news, your calls, and we got another guest coming up.

[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:27.440]  Okay, for one segment in the next hour, from 8 after to 20 after, we've got Joel Seehuzen,
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:30.440]  President and CEO of Liberty Guard, of course, works with Bob Barr.
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:33.440]  Bob Barr investigates TSA standout on National Hopped Out Day.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:42.440]  This is a guess they just set up because today is the last day for the TSA to respond to the foyer request
[01:54:42.440 --> 01:54:50.440]  that then becomes an order dealing with their spying reportedly on myself, Matt Drudge, and others, and the naked body images that they reportedly got.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:56.440]  I want to go to some calls in this segment and the next, and I've got other news coming up we do have fellow Schlafly on.
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:55:01.440]  But obviously, the intensified resistance to TSA is mounting, and that's exciting.
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  I want to tell you about PurewaterFreedom.com.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.440]  That's one word, PurewaterFreedom.com.

[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  20 super foods that are not homogenized.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:43.440]  They're not heated up.
[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:45.440]  The damage is a lot of the nutrients.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:48.440]  Instead of a vitamin, sometimes a lot of it passes through you.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:51.440]  With these mixes, you absorb a lot more of it.
[01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:53.440]  And we live in this toxic environment.
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  It's so important.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  And they have, of course, the green food, the inner food.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:00.440]  They've got healthy coffee infused with rainforest polysaccharides.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:02.440]  They've got a whole bunch of great products.

[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:33.440]  Yes, thank you for taking my call.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:35.440]  Welcome.
[01:56:35.440 --> 01:56:38.440]  I just wanted to let you know, I saw on C-SPAN,
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:41.440]  there was a gentleman named John Lott,
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:44.440]  who has a book out called More Guns, Less Crime.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:47.440]  Yep, we've interviewed him. We put a special one-hour video
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:51.440]  out on PrismPlanet.tv two weeks ago on it. Amazing info. Go ahead.
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.440]  Yeah, it was great. And the interesting thing about him
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:57.440]  is he's just that numbers country.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:00.440]  He's not even really a second amendment advocate or anything like that.
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:03.440]  Yeah, he's a statistics professor.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:10.440]  Right. But that's, yeah, that's a great, I mean, you know,
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  unbiased opinion.
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:18.440]  Also, I just wanted to say five star soap's a great product
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:20.440]  in Ron Paul 2012.
[01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:24.440]  Absolutely. Draft Ron Paul 2012.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:27.440]  And that means just getting the hype going at the grassroots.
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:30.440]  So people understand, hey, he was right about the fellow deserve.
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:32.440]  He was right about currency evaluation. Let's get behind him.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.440]  Shallie in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  Hey, Alex. Hey.
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:40.440]  I've talked to you before.
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:45.440]  In July or August of 2009, I sent you an email with some information
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:51.440]  regarding closed military bases and what I thought basically
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:53.440]  they were going to be doing with them.
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:55.440]  And I've been doing a lot more research.
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.440]  And it's all confirmed in the Emergency Centers Act.
[01:57:58.440 --> 01:58:04.440]  Well, what I find is that every single closed base links to a company
[01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:07.440]  called globalsecurity.org.
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:11.440]  And globalsecurity.org, if you type in any closed base,
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.440]  it comes up globalsecurity.org.
[01:58:14.440 --> 01:58:21.440]  And basically they have taken over the bases and everything about them.
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:25.440]  And they have web pages of every single closed base,
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:32.440]  and specifically certain bases that have some kind of significant stuff going on,
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:35.440]  like the one they closed in Jacksonville, the street across the street
[01:58:35.440 --> 01:58:37.440]  called New World Avenue.
[01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:39.440]  Tell you what, stay there. We'll be right back.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:41.440]  I want to hear more from you.

[01:59:50.440 --> 02:00:01.440]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.440 --> 02:00:10.440]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.440]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:14.440]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:18.440]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:35.440]  and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:37.440]  I've heard of GlobalSecurity.org.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:42.440]  I'm looking at their site, reportedly involved in all sorts of operations
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:44.440]  around the world and running bases.
[02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:48.440]  You know, instead of just speculating, I know under the Base Closure Act,
[02:00:48.440 --> 02:00:51.440]  they've taken them, they've set up National Guard or State Guard bases.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:54.440]  They've set up threat fusion centers, these command bases,
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:57.440]  and then with the CIA over it.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:01.440]  And I'm not particularly sure about GlobalSecurity, this company,
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:04.440]  and their involvement in bases.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:08.440]  But I do say on their site that they have Afghanistan facilities
[02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:12.440]  and other facilities all over the world.
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  But, you know, I can't specifically speak to that.
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:21.440]  It more looks like an index of what's going on with different bases.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:26.440]  But we know under the Emergency Centers Act that it states they will use the bases.
[02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:28.440]  Of course, we have the previous plans for them to use them,
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:31.440]  but more funding to use the bases during emergencies
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:33.440]  for any way Homeland Security wishes.
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:36.440]  Then we have the Houston Chronicle with the documents now four years ago
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:40.440]  where they want to use the bases as FEMA camps to hold political dissidents.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:44.440]  So it's all on record. It's covered my film, Police State for the Rise of FEMA.
[02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:49.440]  100% confirmed the entire takeover plan was also accurately covered
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:52.440]  in the Police State episode of Jesse Ventura's show, Conspiracy Theory.
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:55.440]  That's why that show got pulled after Homeland Security pressure,
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:57.440]  and that's now all on record as well.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  But did you have any other comments that you wanted to make about it, Sally?
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:09.440]  Yes, I do. Also, we did have that episode DVR, and it did disappear from our DVR.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:12.440]  Oh, no, I haven't internally confirmed from a major cable company
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.440]  where they got the orders to erase it. I mean, it's on record, yeah.
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:21.440]  Well, specifically, my list, and just the points I wanted to make
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:26.440]  is when I went down the list of the specific closed bases that I had the list,
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:29.440]  it came up global security for every single one of them.
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:35.440]  And like specifically one in Dayton, which is Dayton, Ohio, it's now called Gentile Station.
[02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:40.440]  And so they renamed it that. And then the one in Jacksonville, that was at Cecil Field,
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:44.440]  when they closed that, now that's called New World Avenue.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.440]  Yeah, well, there's no doubt that the government has been training for more than 20 years,
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  asking troops, will you fire on Americans, and having role players,
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:55.440]  scream, I'm an American, not the camp, I'm your dad, I'm your mom,
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:59.440]  oh please don't take my guns, you know, setting up checkpoints and arresting people.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:02.440]  So there's no doubt that's going on, and there's no doubt they got InfraGuard
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:06.440]  and largely response teams, and it's all just proven on record.
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  I appreciate your call, Sally, very interesting.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:13.440]  Rich in New York, Rich, you're on the air.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.440]  Hey, Rich, how you doing, buddy? Okay, let's move on.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:19.440]  Todd in California, Todd, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:23.440]  Yes, hello, Alex. I want to bring up something.
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:27.440]  I don't know if you remember, but last year at either the G20 or G8 meeting
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:33.440]  where Obama said that he will offer solutions, proposals next year,
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:37.440]  reporting to 2011, and I want to get your take on that.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:41.440]  I think he's referring to, you know, austerity measures that will become.
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:44.440]  Oh no, they've already said that, they've already told us how cool it is.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:48.440]  They raise the taxes, the majority of the money goes to interest on debt
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:52.440]  to foreign bankers who created it by fraud, and then cut all the benefits,
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.440]  and then tell you it's your benefits are the problem,
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:57.440]  and certainly a lot of them are out of control.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.440]  It's wrong to tax people and give it to other people,
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:02.440]  but you could get rid of all the benefits, all the entitlements,
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:06.440]  and there'd be just tens upon tens upon tens
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.440]  into the hundreds of trillions of dollars conservatively that's owed
[02:04:09.440 --> 02:04:13.440]  because we've signed on to too big to fail derivatives.
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.440]  Exactly, and I also want to touch upon the government takeover
[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:22.440]  of our pensions and IRAs. How exactly will they do that?
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:25.440]  Will they make us liquidate our holdings?
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:29.440]  I have a private IRA, but we have to liquidate our holdings
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:31.440]  and then buy government bonds.
[02:04:31.440 --> 02:04:33.440]  Well, there's a cocktail of things they've done,
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.440]  but look what they've done in other countries.
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:39.440]  They'll take them to, quote, protect them when they say that the fund,
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:42.440]  the fund's already been looted, so they tell you it's insolvent.
[02:04:42.440 --> 02:04:46.440]  The government takes it over to back it and then puts a tax on it,
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:49.440]  and then they just keep ratcheting the taxes up from there.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:52.440]  They've got some other things they do, and then on cost of living benefits
[02:04:52.440 --> 02:04:56.440]  for things like Social Security, a government pension for the public,
[02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:20.440]  they then freeze the cost of living and increase the cola.
[02:05:26.440 --> 02:05:55.440]  That's H-O-M-E-G-A-I-N-150.com
[02:05:56.440 --> 02:06:04.440]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:06.440]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:10.440]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:13.440]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees,
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.440]  but for the rest of us, things seemed to be getting worse.
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.440]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:21.440]  They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:24.440]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver,
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:27.440]  you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:29.440]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:33.440]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious
[02:06:33.440 --> 02:06:35.440]  than any financial resource.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:38.440]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis,
[02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:40.440]  and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:44.440]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy-fix meals
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.440]  to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:49.440]  This will freeze the cost to your food while you can still afford it.
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:55.440]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the Internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:07:21.440]  That's eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:34.440]  I'm looking for America.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:36.440]  Wear American and be proud.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:39.440]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:43.440]  Land on a free and my home of the brave
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:52.440]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone, long gone.
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:55.440]  But I know in my heart it's still in place.
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:08:01.440]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:05.440]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:08:05.440 --> 02:08:13.440]  The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:17.440]  We are live eight minutes into this third hour.
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:22.440]  Unfortunately, the founder of the Eagle Forum will be joining us live to talk about this so-called
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:24.440]  New Republican Revolution.
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:28.440]  Will it actually restore liberty in this country?
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:35.440]  The top story at drugsreport.com is our article written by Aaron Dykes and yours truly last night.
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:40.440]  Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA.
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:42.440]  I guess technically it's today's story.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.440]  It went up about 1 a.m. last night.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:48.440]  It's the inside story from Alex Jones about the former governor's humiliating pat-down experience
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:52.440]  that included touching, groping, and rubbing of the genitals at the hands of the TSA.
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:57.440]  As I flow with Ventura, traveled with him and seen it from my shelf.
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:01.440]  He's now filed the suit he told me about privately in November because he says his career is over.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:03.440]  He's not traveling anymore by plane.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:09.440]  Problem is TSA wants to roll this out and is rolling it out nationwide with the Viper teams and the rest of it.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:15.440]  We are joined right now by Joe Seehuzen.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:20.440]  He is the president and CEO of Liberty Guard, the organization founded by Bob Barr.
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:22.440]  Of course, the headline from back in December.
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.440]  Bob Barr investigates TSA stand-down on National Opt-Out Day.
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:27.440]  They're also in the FOIA request.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:29.440]  It's really an order.
[02:09:29.440 --> 02:09:34.440]  Asking for key terms like Alex Jones, presentplanet.com, Drudge Report,
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:42.440]  because there's reports of them from TSA workers issuing memos that were basically extremist and dangerous.
[02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:44.440]  And if they don't respond to that, today's the deadline.
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:49.440]  We'll talk about what moves forward in this segment that we have Joe Seehuzen on with us.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:52.440]  Joe, thank you for joining us from libertyguard.org.
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:55.440]  Thank you, Alex. Great to be here.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:03.440]  Break down what the FOIA is dealing with and what's going to happen if Homeland Security doesn't respond to this.
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:10.440]  A big question is, has the TSA, for political reasons,
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:20.440]  potentially jeopardized the safety of American citizens flying on certainly the largest day of flying thanksgiving day?
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:24.440]  And that's a serious question that we wanted to find out about.
[02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:37.440]  And the genesis of this, of course, is that many groups and people saw that these pat-downs, these invasive pat-downs,
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:46.440]  which took a great deal of time, which were offensive to people, which were very unpleasant and unsavory,
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:49.440]  they were taking place that took a great deal of time.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:58.440]  And many groups were saying, gee, on a busy day, let's make a point that many Americans don't like this and don't want it.
[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:05.440]  And as a consequence, we'll go through some of this and we'll bring media attention to this issue of,
[02:11:05.440 --> 02:11:14.440]  do we want these image scanning machines, which are also invasive or even worse, these pat-downs, which are offensive?
[02:11:14.440 --> 02:11:23.440]  And it turns out that on this day that Liberty Guard and other groups called for, in a sense, an opt-out,
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:28.440]  where folks would not go through the scanner but take the pat-down,
[02:11:28.440 --> 02:11:34.440]  it turns out that media reported, and many eyewitness accounts from around the country,
[02:11:34.440 --> 02:11:41.440]  showed that these machines in question and the pat-down procedures were not taking place.
[02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:46.440]  And as a consequence, the natural question arises, since we've been told,
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:51.440]  without these pat-downs and without these scanning machines, we're really not safe.
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:57.440]  The traveling public in the United States, flying in airplanes without these pat-down procedures and the scanners,
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:01.440]  anything could happen and they must take place.
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:09.440]  But because there was going to be national media attention on this day and on this issue, these machines were shut down.
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:13.440]  Or that is what we're concerned may have happened. They were shut down.
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:16.440]  In fact, our question is why were they shut down?
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:21.440]  And we have filed a Freedom of Information Act, Liberty Guard has filed a Freedom of Information Act,
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:27.440]  to find that out in fact, because it's in fact the PSA, for its own political gain,
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:31.440]  was willing to put the lines of countless Americans in jeopardy.
[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:33.440]  I think that's something the American public ought to know.
[02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:39.440]  Yeah, this terror threat is so imminent, so deadly, they've got to force people in wheelchairs that can't walk to be forced up
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:42.440]  or they've got to stick their hands down our pants to keep us safe from al-Qaeda.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:47.440]  How could they just, and by the way, we had a crew that flew the day before Thanksgiving.
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  I had friends and family that flew the day after Thanksgiving.
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:54.440]  The stand-down was the day before, the day of, and for at least three days after,
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:59.440]  they were just not using the machines and countless media outlets went out and confirmed that day and the day after.
[02:12:59.440 --> 02:13:03.440]  They were not being used, so there's no doubt that that went on.
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:05.440]  So, I mean, what are these scanners really all about?
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:12.440]  Is it about training us to submit to federal takeovers and to our persons being violated?
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:18.440]  Well, absolutely. You know, a very reasonable person would ask these very reasonable questions.
[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:23.440]  And the first question is, do any of these procedures, are they truly effective?
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:28.440]  And those are real questions that we want hard answers to and hard numbers to and want to know.
[02:13:28.440 --> 02:13:36.440]  And certainly, these photographic imaging machines, which essentially are see-through scanners,
[02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:42.440]  see-through people's clothing, and then these stand-downs, which are just the breathtaking in their intrusiveness
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:47.440]  and their degradation of everyday Americans.
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:50.440]  And we want to know that.
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:59.440]  And again, the TSA went ahead and denied that they were playing politics with passenger security procedures.
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:06.440]  In fact, there are spokesmen or a woman named Tawika O'Reilly in response to our comments.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:13.440]  The Liberty Guard claimed, quote, that AIT operations were normal throughout the week, including last Wednesday.
[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:18.440]  And this is the punchline. Any suggestions to the contrary are not true.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:27.440]  And goodness, how dare everyday Americans make any suggestions that government bureaucrats would play politics with American safety?
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:30.440]  That seems outrageous on the face of...
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:36.440]  And so now that they're on record saying that they didn't do this and that we're idiots for saying it,
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:41.440]  if you're able to get the documentation showing if they lied, which we know they are lying clearly,
[02:14:41.440 --> 02:14:45.440]  then they're going to have a very serious problem on their hands.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:50.440]  Well, that's exactly it, Alex. And that takes us right to the present moment.
[02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:55.440]  We did file this FOIA request. And as you know, there's a time period in which they have to respond.
[02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:04.440]  As of 5 o'clock Eastern today, they likely will have not responded in another couple hours, I guess.
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:11.440]  And then we at Liberty Guard have a choice to make and certainly want input from all of your listeners.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:19.440]  So whether we go ahead and give them an extension, give them more time to comply,
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:23.440]  or really file a suit in federal court.
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:27.440]  And, you know, frankly, both of those will require funding on our part.
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.440]  And if any of your listeners can do the help us at Liberty Guard, we appreciate it.
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:35.440]  But we're going to move forward because it's too important an issue, regardless.
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:42.440]  And we are prepared to file a suit against the TSA in federal court if they don't comply,
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:49.440]  because we're not willing to trust them when they say that they will not play politics with the safety of everyday Americans.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:52.440]  So we say, prove it.
[02:15:52.440 --> 02:15:56.440]  Clearly, the momentum has completely shifted against TSA.
[02:15:56.440 --> 02:15:59.440]  Congress is talking about investigations.
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:07.440]  Airports are moving to kick the government TSA out, but then bring in private security that will basically follow some of the same activities,
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:10.440]  but hopefully won't be quite as goonish.
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:14.440]  We had them just lose last week the suit in Texas.
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:21.440]  They settled it where they pulled the woman's shirt off and revealed her breast and then laughed and came up to her when she was crying in the gate,
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.440]  reportedly, and said, man, I wish I'd have been part of that search.
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:33.440]  We now have them losing a court case out on the West Coast, as I'm sure you know, dealing with videotaping the TSA.
[02:16:33.440 --> 02:16:40.440]  And you see polls where seven out of 10 Americans or more are very upset about what's happening.
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:47.440]  Now we hear TSA saying they're looking at other things in the future, but they're talking about a trusted traveler type thing where you even get more permission to travel.
[02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:54.440]  And meanwhile, they just canceled the virtual fence on the border, never really built any of the physical fence, built some show fence.
[02:16:54.440 --> 02:17:03.440]  I mean, where is this government hubris and arrogance going in your view with the mounting resistance?
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:06.440]  Well, I would say this, Alex.
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:13.440]  I suspect that the nature of government bureaucracies is that they will go as far as we will let them.
[02:17:13.440 --> 02:17:19.440]  I don't think they're self-policing.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:31.440]  I think their mission is to grow, to get bigger, to get richer by way of more budget to them, to hire more staff to expand their scope.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:37.440]  And I'm sure they can find numerous rationale to justify any and every behavior.
[02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:46.440]  I think the only way that these federal bureaucracies will know where the line is gone is where the American people tell them it is.
[02:17:46.440 --> 02:17:53.440]  And I think civil liberties, because they're so, at least historically, so ubiquitous in this country.
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:55.440]  We have them and we take them for granted.
[02:17:55.440 --> 02:17:57.440]  They're almost in a way nebulous to us.
[02:17:57.440 --> 02:17:59.440]  We're just used to free speech.
[02:17:59.440 --> 02:18:02.440]  We're used to freedom of movement.
[02:18:02.440 --> 02:18:07.440]  That until we see a concrete example, it doesn't wake us up.
[02:18:07.440 --> 02:18:14.440]  And I think when Americans watch the television and they saw elderly people, they saw people with infirmities.
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:23.440]  They saw a woman with a prosthetic breast and a gentleman with a colonoscopy kind of bag and young children being searched.
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:26.440]  This is horrific to watch.
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:28.440]  It looks like images of Nazi Germany.
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:33.440]  What do you think of Ventura's lawsuit that was filed yesterday?
[02:18:33.440 --> 02:18:45.440]  Well, I think Jesse is a tremendous patriot and anytime people stand up and say, this is the line, this is where it's going to stop with me, I think it's a good thing.
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:58.440]  And I think that in all of these issues, whether it's Liberty Guard's action or Mr. Ventura's action and other actions, I think it's where everyday Americans get behind that and say it's going to stop right here.
[02:18:58.440 --> 02:18:59.440]  Exactly.
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:02.440]  It's an example for others to resist.
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:03.440]  Absolutely.
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:04.440]  We're going to stop it right here.
[02:19:04.440 --> 02:19:06.440]  And we're almost out of time.
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:12.440]  What's your view on DHS now rolling out 9,000 locations with telescreens saying watch your neighbors.
[02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:16.440]  They now have promo videos showing the TSA at sports stadiums.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:19.440]  I mean, they clearly want to be on the streets of America.
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:33.440]  Well, again, Alex, and thank you and your listeners for your leadership fighting for America's freedom, but I would re-state that, again, these groups have no mission other than to get bigger and more powerful and more intrusive.
[02:19:33.440 --> 02:19:35.440]  And they will do so.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:40.440]  Obviously, Congress has not done its job in regulating and controlling.
[02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:50.440]  And so the American people need to be very specific and very clear that the erosion of our liberties is going to stop and we need to pick our point where that takes place.
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:52.440]  I tell you what, Joe, we got to go to break.
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:53.440]  We got to go to break.
[02:19:53.440 --> 02:19:54.440]  Do five more minutes with us.
[02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:56.440]  I want you to be able to finish up with the important points you're making.
[02:19:56.440 --> 02:20:21.440]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:47.440]  We'll be right back.

[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:40.440]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:40.440 --> 02:22:43.440]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:49.440]  It's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:26.440]  Give the TSA and Homeland Security more time to answer their foyer about the stand down in and around the Thanksgiving holiday or whether they're going to go ahead and just file a lawsuit.
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:37.440]  I personally, and I know Bob Barr is a smart guy and so is Joe, but I would go ahead and just file the suit if they don't respond just to go ahead and get the process sped up because they want to drag their feet on this.
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:43.440]  A lot of times, as you know, Joe, once that suit's filed, then they'll perhaps comply, then you can find out if they're black and stuff out.
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:57.440]  More and more, we need TSA whistleblowers to send infowars.com, showtips at infowars.com or go to Liberty Gardens, send you information confirming the leaks we've already had that the stand down did go on.
[02:24:57.440 --> 02:25:03.440]  Plus, the leaks we've had that they're targeting, the Drudge Report and Alex Jones and people like that and saying these are extremists.
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:13.440]  But continuing, you were getting cut off by the break there. You were talking about the awakening and people really coming together now that our fundamental rights and even our personal space is being violated.
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:33.440]  Well, I think, yes, I think your show and just chronically and detailing the agencies, the bureaucracies, the actions, the scope creep, the expansion of government, of bureaucracies and the steady erosion of our civil liberties.
[02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:44.440]  And every day, citizens might look at one component of that and say, well, that's not that bad. And maybe we ought to just trust our politicians and all will be well.
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:50.440]  I think if anyone looks at the aggregate scope of what's happening, it's alarming.
[02:25:50.440 --> 02:26:10.440]  We were chronicling, pointing out, showing the big picture scope of this erosion of civil liberties, the erosion of our Constitution and the growth of bureaucrats, which are, in many cases, not fully accountable or responsible and are playing fast and loose with our freedoms.
[02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:20.440]  And so I think, again, on these various issues, I think all of us need to stop and do a gut check and say there's points at which we're not going to let things erode any further.
[02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:33.440]  And in the case of Liberty Guard, we're saying to the TSA, you need to prove to us, you need to prove to the American people that you did not take a risk in the lives of tens of thousands of Americans for your own political reasons,
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:42.440]  prove that to the American people. And if not, we're going to show up shortly in a federal court and demand that you do.
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:55.440]  And so we certainly appreciate the support of your listeners, but we also ask them to support all the wonderful programs and projects where people are standing up and standing tall and saying, this is where it's going to end.
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:06.440]  Absolutely. If we don't hang together, we will surely hang separate, as Benjamin Franklin said. And this is clearly one of the straws that is breaking the camel's back.
[02:27:06.440 --> 02:27:20.440]  Anybody who's flown a lot has seen people in wheelchairs are trying to force up, who look like they're on the edge of death, the yelling at people, my grandmother flying in from a wedding in Mexico a few years ago.
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:28.440]  My parents were with her at Houston and people just screaming on her crutches because she had polio in the 50s, but still uses crutches.
[02:27:28.440 --> 02:27:36.440]  She hasn't given up and gone to a wheelchair. And she doesn't want to fly now after that. I mean, they treat us like total trash.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:48.440]  And clearly they know this is about political domination. What about the Tenth Amendment issue of TSA now saying with the Viper teams that they are now on the streets of America and are expanding that?
[02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:53.440]  I mean, that right there just shows how much trouble we're in.
[02:27:53.440 --> 02:28:09.440]  Well, again, thanks to you for, again, looking at all these issues and disseminating the information and letting countless Americans look and see what's happening because as all of this unfolds, it's unfolding at a breathtaking pace.
[02:28:09.440 --> 02:28:21.440]  And unless we involve ourselves and unless we decide to stand tall, it's going to sweep over us. Our civil liberties will buckle. Our Constitution is certainly threatened.
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:35.440]  Obviously, we've all talked about the debt and its impact on this country, but it has to be that the information is out there and that people engage and say that this is where we're going to draw the line.
[02:28:35.440 --> 02:28:47.440]  Joe, anybody who's studied history or just common sense, if we'll put up with warrantless searches and hands down our pants, I mean, it's always more and more and radiation bathing scanners, what won't we put up with?
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:55.440]  I mean, this is really the maker to break it test. People going back three, four months ago before this became the big issue said, why are you spending so much time on it?
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:58.440]  And why were we having contests for people to make videos to expose it?
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:10.440]  The point is, we recognize this is a key juncture in our republic's history, right as we're going into this government orchestrated implosion of the economy, right as we're seeing these attacks on liberties.
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:22.440]  They want to set the precedent for total federalization of our society, the threat fusion centers, the infra-guard, the clergy response teams, the citizen spies, the telescreens going in Walmart.
[02:29:22.440 --> 02:29:29.440]  I mean, this is right out of 1984, and we've got to recognize it, come together and say no, and that's why folks really need to support libertyguard.org.
[02:29:29.440 --> 02:29:37.440]  Joe, see you soon. Thank you so much for joining us, and I look forward to talking to you.
[02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:42.440]  How soon do we have 20 seconds? How long do we see the decision on Sue or give her more time? A few days?
[02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:49.440]  I think it's going to be a few days, and we are listening to our members and others and their input. Hey, let's go forward or let's go.
[02:29:49.440 --> 02:29:59.440]  All right, let's go forward, Joe. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:19.440 --> 02:30:30.440]  The name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:37.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:30:37.440 --> 02:30:47.440]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:30:47.440 --> 02:31:01.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.440 --> 02:31:16.440]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[02:31:16.440 --> 02:31:34.440]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[02:31:34.440 --> 02:31:52.440]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs system works.
[02:31:52.440 --> 02:32:08.440]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:37.440]  If you'd like to learn more about the Silver Lungs system, visit our website at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about the Silver Lungs system.
[02:32:37.440 --> 02:33:04.440]  If you're an owner and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business? I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain. Call us at 1-800-340-7091 to visit our website www.5starssoap.com for buying a one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[02:33:04.440 --> 02:33:22.440]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:22.440 --> 02:33:33.440]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:33.440 --> 02:33:41.440]  Our key story that we were just covering with the head of Liberty Guard, Bob Barb's operation, is up at the Drudge Report top story.
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:51.440]  It's also on Infowars.com and PrismPlanet.com. Ventura strikes back with lawsuit against TSA. Ventura lawsuit, TSA patdown is classified as unlawful sexual abuse.
[02:33:51.440 --> 02:33:55.440]  We'll continue to cover that obviously as the transmission continues.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:34:06.440]  The next 30 minutes, or 27 minutes to be technical, Phyllis Schlafly joined us a week or so ago, but we can only get about 15 minutes, whether she's been gracious to come back with us, really needs no introduction.
[02:34:06.440 --> 02:34:12.440]  She's the National Leader of the Conservative Movement since the publication of her bestselling 1964, A Choice on an Echo.
[02:34:12.440 --> 02:34:22.440]  She has been a leader of the pro family movement since 72 when she started her national volunteer organization, now called Eagle Forum, who's really done a great job all over the country fighting the NAFTA Highways.
[02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:27.440]  Ms. Schlafly's monthly newsletter called The Phyllis Schlafly Report is now in its 43rd year.
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:33.440]  Her syndicated column appears in 100 newspapers. Plus, her radio commentaries are her daily and over 500 radio stations.
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:39.440]  And her radio talk show on the education called The Eagle Forum Live is her weekdays on 75 stations.
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:45.440]  EagleForum.org is her website. We have her information linked up at Infowars.com.
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:53.440]  And I wanted to get her on about the so-called conservative movement, because we see Republicans giving us government almost as big as Obama.
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:57.440]  Bush doubling government, Obama tripling at the first year.
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:06.440]  And we see these articles about Republicans' mainline are going to come in and teach the Tea Parties how to behave, and Giuliani saying they could be a problem.
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:12.440]  And so there's this struggle. Can the Republican Party be used to try to restore the Republic?
[02:35:12.440 --> 02:35:21.440]  And we're going to talk to Phyllis Schlafly about that. Also, we're going to get her view on what's happening right now with the big state of the Union coming up tonight.
[02:35:21.440 --> 02:35:31.440]  Gibbs told us yesterday and today there will be gun grabbing pushed on the heels of the drug addict lunatic in Tucson that had nothing to do with conservatives.
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:39.440]  They tried to frame people with that they will call for everybody to shut up their political rhetoric because we're telling the truth and it's effective in hurting them.
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:44.440]  They're climate tax, they're carbon taxes, they're government takeover of healthcare.
[02:35:44.440 --> 02:35:49.440]  They want us to shut up and they're saying, speech is bad. So they're not just attacking the Second Amendment.
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:54.440]  Now it's the First Amendment. Very brazen calls for the return to the fairness doctrine, restricting free speech on talk radio.
[02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:58.440]  And he's going to claim he's going to try to balance the budget and have earmark freezes.
[02:35:58.440 --> 02:36:01.440]  Now he's suddenly talking like Rand Paul. We'll see if that's the case.
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:05.440]  But I wanted to get Phyllis Schlafly's take on all of this. Phyllis, thank you for joining us.
[02:36:05.440 --> 02:36:10.440]  Hello, Alex. Good to join you. Good to have you. What do you want to tackle first?
[02:36:10.440 --> 02:36:15.440]  What's going on with the Republicans and where you see it headed or the State of the Union coming up?
[02:36:15.440 --> 02:36:21.440]  Well, I can't predict what Obama's going to say. I know the media have been trying to predict everything.
[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:32.440]  But I think he's not moving to the center. He's just the left wing socialist like he's always been and he's trying to suit people with some good words.
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:40.440]  So I don't believe there's any real change there. In Obama, I think he is a dedicated guy who just as he told Joe the Palmer,
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:47.440]  he wants to spread the wealth around and that doesn't just mean from people who are taxpayers to non-tax payers,
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:51.440]  it means from the U.S. to other countries around the world.
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:37:04.440]  And however, the conservative movement I think demonstrated its force in the November election. I believe in the two-party system, that's what we've got.
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:15.440]  I'm not the supporter of any third party. I think that we're going to have to retake the conservative control of the Republican Party,
[02:37:15.440 --> 02:37:24.440]  which we did in 1964 and then we did in 1980, and somehow it flipped away under George W. Bush, but we can get it back.
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:27.440]  And we will come to the two-party people.
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:44.440]  Phyllis Laffley, you know, you knew Ronald Reagan well and of course Nancy Reagan and Reagan did some good things on the Second Amendment and cutting taxes, but are you saying that this modern conservative movement is going to try to imitate Reagan?
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:52.440]  Because I don't like the big giant war on drugs. I agree with Ron Paul on that. It's been used to take our liberties and look at the war on drugs he's done in Mexico,
[02:37:52.440 --> 02:38:02.440]  it's like liquor prohibition, increased crime and corruption of police. I don't want to see the main line kind of Republican move towards invading all these countries that's bankrupting us.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:13.440]  I mean, when you say true conservative movement, how do you define it on like the TSA and the groping or all these wars? I mean, where do you stand on that as the leader of the Eagle Forum?
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:22.440]  Well, I think the biggest war going on at the present time is immediately south of our border, and we certainly don't want to let it come into this country.
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:38.440]  I agree that we ought to have a sense on the border as Congress has voted and even Obama signed or voted for and George Bush signed, and I think that that's where more people are being killed than any place else.
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:47.440]  So I would cannot let that drug war come into the United States. I think the immigration issue is tremendously important.
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:38:59.440]  I think the illegals are coming in and taking jobs from our people who are high school dropouts. We already have a great supply of high school dropouts. We don't need a new supply of them.
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:03.440]  And so I think that should be a major focus.
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:12.440]  Sure, but specifically to my question, because we saw what Newt Gingrich did, Mr. Carbon Tax, Mr. Globalist with the Republican Takeover in 94.
[02:39:12.440 --> 02:39:21.440]  I'm specifically saying, where do you and the Eagle Forum stand on? We don't just have all of the entitlements at the left likes.
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  We've got all of these giant military industrial complex situations going on.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:36.440]  And specifically, we look at the Netherlands and others that have decriminalized many drugs and their crime rate is imploded. They're shutting down prisons. I mean, where do you stand?
[02:39:36.440 --> 02:39:45.440]  Well, I'm certainly not for making drugs legal. And you know, it was on the ballot in California, the trendsetter of our country.
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:53.440]  And I think everybody thought legalization of marijuana was going to take place. And surprise, surprise, the people voted it down.
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:59.440]  Well, I've got to say, I mean, you know, we've got triple the heroin, double the cocaine flowing in. We had 20 years ago.
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:06.440]  Well, that's because the big majority of it's come in from Mexico. And I think we should take every step necessary to stop it.
[02:40:06.440 --> 02:40:13.440]  Well, what do you think about the TSA saying that they've got to do all these things to keep us safe, but they did just cancel the virtual fence?
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:15.440]  As you know, they never built.
[02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:19.440]  Well, the virtual fence was always a fraud, I think.
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:25.440]  Oh, we need a real fence, a real concrete fence. Fences work in other countries around the world.
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:32.440]  And you need a double fence. And you need that to let the illegals come in.
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:40.440]  Sure. Shifting gears back over to Obama, he got that 15-point Gallup bounce that's short-lived.
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:45.440]  It's already dropped down to 12 in just a week after that poll came out from the shooting.
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:55.440]  And he had that political pep rally there in Tucson with the 14,000 t-shirts about together we thrive and really tried to capitalize on it and tried to attack the First Amendment.
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:40:59.440]  What's your view on that whole debacle?
[02:40:59.440 --> 02:41:07.440]  Well, of course, what happened in Arizona was a tragedy, but I think Obama's trying to capitalize on it.
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:24.440]  You know, Clinton and I think Rahm Emanuel, too, have said that after Clinton was beaten in the Republican off-year election in 1994, he felt that he bounced back because of the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:41:24.440 --> 02:41:28.440]  Now, I don't understand that, but apparently that's what he believes.
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:42.440]  And so that urban legend has percolated through to Obama, and I think he was trying to get this bounce back from the Arizona killing, which, of course, he had nothing to do with.
[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:47.440]  We're glad he expressed his sympathy, but that's enough. Move on and do what he ought to be doing.
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:54.440]  Well, there are calls for the Internet kill switch. That's in CBS News today under federal control. Cyber security.
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:58.440]  Well, we certainly don't want CBS running the Internet.
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:42:07.440]  But, I mean, CBS is reporting on that they are pushing the Internet kill switch, and I'd be against that under a Republican president or a Democratic president, and we do see the push for the fairness doctrine.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:11.440]  That doesn't sound too liberal. That sounds authoritarian.
[02:42:11.440 --> 02:42:26.440]  Well, of course, the effort to talk about reinstating the fairness doctrine is an attempt to get Rush Limbaugh off the air. You know he is a powerful audience, and when they got rid of the fairness doctrine, why then we got Rush?
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:40.440]  And, of course, when you have freedom out there, the conservatives can win because we have good arguments and we can make our case, and the liberals can't get any eggs to run their show because they're so boring and they don't have any answers.
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:49.440]  Well, well said on that front. Phyllis, you know, you probably don't even remember who I am, but in the last 16 years on air I've interviewed you every few years.
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:58.440]  You've been friendly to come on with us. I wanted to bring up another issue because we're talking about who controls these political parties, and we know that Wall Street gave all that money to Obama, but also to McCain.
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:09.440]  We know that Wall Street, a lot of it is offshore now and pushes for having open trade with China, but then they're not fair with us.
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:20.440]  What's your view on China and who Gentiles talking down the dollar and all these things that are happening? I mean, what's the Eagle Forum's position on Chinese relations?
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:31.440]  Well, I think China is the enemy. If you read any of the press that you get out of China or you get India reporting on China, they hate it.
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:38.440]  They're building up their military because they want to be the one superpower, and they're doing it with our money, and I don't think we ought to let them do it.
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:50.440]  And this thing of Obama making nice with Wall Street, you know this CEO of General Electric who's pro Obama, he's creating jobs in China.
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:54.440]  He's not creating jobs in this country, and it's all a big hoax.
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:44:02.440]  And Wall Street gives to the person they think they're going to win, and they thought that Obama's going to win last time, so they were generous to him.
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:11.440]  But I think we ought to do something to reclaim a good American job in this country.
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:15.440]  That is what we need, and I don't hear anybody giving any good answers to that.
[02:44:15.440 --> 02:44:19.440]  Well, you get rid of NAFTA and GATT. We were told it was going to be wonderful by Al Gore. Look what it's done.
[02:44:19.440 --> 02:44:24.440]  Yeah, look what it's done. I agree with you. I was opposed to NAFTA. I was opposed to GATT.
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:37.440]  Incidentally, I think GATT, the one that was rammed through in the lame duck session, and they decided, I think they decided against the U.S. in six out of seven cases they had.
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:40.440]  So that's the way it is when you deal with these.
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:48.440]  Yeah, it's certainly one way. Now, getting into another issue, do you know Charlotte Isherby, who had a policy at the Department of Education?
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:50.440]  Yes, I do.
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:52.440]  What's your view of her work?
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:45:04.440]  Well, I haven't talked to Charlotte in a number of years, but she certainly did very good work and exposed a lot of the mischief in the education department and in the public schools.
[02:45:04.440 --> 02:45:13.440]  Sure. My view on this is that I respect her and the work she's done, and she certainly said nice things about you.
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:25.440]  But overall, she's been critical and said that just like the left, and I don't see it as a leftist organization because they got Republicans and Democrats in the Council on Farm Relations who we know pushes for globalism.
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:33.440]  But I know I've read you've been involved in conservative think tanks and organizations, you know, from their inception like the CMP.
[02:45:33.440 --> 02:45:36.440]  Where does the CMP stand in all of this?
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:47.440]  Well, they don't have any policy position. They just need to have a good time and meet at the risk, Carlson, and enjoy talking to a lot of important people.
[02:45:47.440 --> 02:46:01.440]  Yeah, there's been kind of leftist professors and people over the years that have been kind of threatened by people exposing the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, who were on record having, you know, the entire power elite in them pushing for globalism and world government.
[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:16.440]  But then I get reports and hear people say that, you know, that really things like the CMP, that's the real power out there, and that it's actually been used to take over conservative movements.
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:17.440]  What's your view on that?
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:31.440]  No, they haven't taken over the conservative movement. I urge people to be active in the Republican Party because that is the vehicle by which we can achieve our political goals. But you certainly are right about the CFR.
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:42.440]  A lot of objections to them, but one of the things I've talked about recently is one of their papers they put out. You know, there are always people who are wanting to rewrite the Constitution. They think they can do a better job.
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:55.440]  And you know, what is the provision of a U.S. Constitution that the globalists hate the most? It is the treaty provision that says you've got to have a two-thirds vote in the Senate in order to ratify treaty.
[02:46:55.440 --> 02:47:15.440]  And they have manipulated around. NAFTA was not a treaty. It did not get the two-thirds vote. I don't believe that did either. And they've gone to a great length to try to get the international agreement through without obeying the treaty provision of the Constitution, which I think is just great.
[02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:26.440]  Because most of those UN treaties cut a piece of our sovereignty out and give the controls of some commission of left-wing so-called experts.
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:35.440]  Well, one other reason I brought up the CMP is I know any organization, you know, with any organizational power, they're going to be people inside of it who have globalist tendencies.
[02:47:35.440 --> 02:47:47.440]  But I did see a Seymour Hirsch report that said that the military and the U.S. is being run by the Knights of Malta and by Opus Die.
[02:47:47.440 --> 02:47:55.440]  And then I'd seen claims going back decades that those groups were powerful inside the CMP. What do you think of what Seymour Hirsch is saying?
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:48:03.440]  Well, most of them are all Catholics. And I can tell you, there are not very many Catholics in CMP.
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:07.440]  Yeah, because I guess it's James Dobson and people who are Protestants in there.
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:20.440]  Oh, yeah. It's largely evangelical. And they don't have any policy statements. They just get together for the conviviality of it.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:21.440]  Absolutely.
[02:48:21.440 --> 02:48:30.440]  And the Knights of Malta, most of what they do is charitable work. It's a completely Catholic organization. I don't think they have any political support.
[02:48:30.440 --> 02:48:37.440]  Sure. I mean, absolutely. From looking at the CMP rolls, it's predominantly Protestant. But at the same time, I mean, certainly there's powerful networks.
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:41.440]  I'm sure it would be offended if you said the Knights of Malta and Opus Die ran it.
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:43.440]  Who would be offended?
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:45.440]  The members of the CMP.
[02:48:45.440 --> 02:48:50.440]  I mean, I think anytime something's secret, people start asking questions.
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:56.440]  Well, that's right.
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:59.440]  So, I mean, what does go on at CMP meetings?
[02:48:59.440 --> 02:49:05.440]  Just speeches. Speeches and dinner. That's all. Just speeches and dinner.
[02:49:05.440 --> 02:49:10.440]  They don't pass any resolution. They don't endorse any campaign.
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:14.440]  Sure. Was it set up by the Hunt Brothers?
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:24.440]  No. I think in the early days, Bunker Hunt was a member. But the other Hunt, the famous one, was never a member.
[02:49:24.440 --> 02:49:29.440]  Sure. Well, I see things like Howard Phillips, who does, you know, fights naff to get the New World Order.
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:33.440]  He's pretty, I mean, I see good fruits from him. And I see you doing a lot of good work.
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:42.440]  I mean, I do see a lot of main, you know, mainline, you know, what you call rock, rib, Republican, hardcore conservatives, you know, tend to turn a blind eye to a lot of big government stuff out of Republicans.
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:47.440]  But I'm glad to hear that. I know for many years, you've, you've spoken out against that.
[02:49:47.440 --> 02:49:50.440]  And, you know, Charlotte was saying, you know, to me on and off air, you know, you're one of the better members of that.
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:50:05.440]  She just is critical of CMP because when she tried to get into the, you know, Carnegie documents and others that came out congressional hearings dealing with the plan to merge the U.S. and the Soviet Union together back in the 80s, that CMP didn't want to hear about it.
[02:50:05.440 --> 02:50:13.440]  Well, education has not been something that they've been particularly interested in. In fact, I'm complaining about that.
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:21.440]  I personally think that a lot of well-to-do people have their children in private schools and they don't care what happens to the public schools.
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:22.440]  Sure.
[02:50:22.440 --> 02:50:32.440]  And while I pay a lot of private schools and private colleges, I recognize that 89 percent of the kids in this country go to public schools and we're paying for them.
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:43.440]  And I feel they should be taught the correct American history and they should not be taught that they should forget what their parents taught them, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:45.440]  All right. Phyllis, we'll have to stay there. Final segment with you.
[02:50:45.440 --> 02:50:49.440]  I want to get into other topics that you think are most important in the five minutes we have left.
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:54.440]  And then an incredible Haritz headline. I was just handed it. We're going to link it up at Info Wars and Prison Planet.
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:51:01.440]  Security Scanner Blame for Woman's Death. They're using these X-ray scanners on the highways in the U.S. The Army is in New York.
[02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:05.440]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:10.440]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.440 --> 02:51:16.440]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days and it works. For all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:25.440]  When I first joined, I was being sued. So I used the program methods and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:32.440]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing. There is no other program of its kind. Don't be alone with creditors gang up on you.

[02:52:01.440 --> 02:52:10.440]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:15.440]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:21.440]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.440 --> 02:52:26.440]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:36.440]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:42.440]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:49.440]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:36.440]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:36.440 --> 02:53:42.440]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:50.440]  Gold is outperform paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:50.440 --> 02:53:56.440]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:56.440 --> 02:54:23.440]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:23.440 --> 02:54:42.440]  All of a sudden I saw Sherry Dunn Brown came in due to me down. So I shot, I shot, I shot him down and I say...
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:54.440]  You can't make this stuff up. Haritz reporting. Security scanner blame for woman's death. A body scanner. We're going to get an article out on that at infowars.com the next 30 minutes.
[02:54:54.440 --> 02:55:05.440]  Kurt's working on it. Also study. Genghis Khan's mass killing cut carbon footprint. We've got a report on that but it's also being reported on by the New York Times.
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:14.440]  They're giving volunteers, giving speed cameras all over the country to spy on citizens.
[02:55:14.440 --> 02:55:22.440]  These aren't even environmentalists in my research. They're eugenicists and more and more they're saying look it isn't even about carbon. It's about getting rid of people.
[02:55:22.440 --> 02:55:27.440]  We have Ted Turner praising the one child policy of China. How do we stop these people?
[02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:38.440]  Well, I think we have to keep speaking up against them because there are people who want to worship the earth instead of God and there are people who want to limit the number of people.
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:49.440]  They simply want to get rid of a lot of the people. Let me mention before we run out of time, Alex, if you run out of things to talk about on this program you can always go to my website.
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:56:01.440]  It's eugenicist.com.org. All kinds of wonderful information. Absolutely. You guys do do a lot of good work and you're fighting the North American Union. Where do you see the SPP going?
[02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:25.440]  Well, that was a Bush project and I think Obama is really more wanting to distribute our wealth to the rest of the world. He isn't confining it just the North America. But he hasn't got anything to close the border and he did meet once or twice with the Mexican president.
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:37.440]  That doesn't seem to be high on his agenda. But I'm certainly against erasing the border. We want the United States the way it is and we don't want to combine with any other country.
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:50.440]  And I do think the disaffection with the euro has cooled off a lot of people on this idea of moving into a common market with other countries and sharing their currency.
[02:56:50.440 --> 02:57:00.440]  Yeah, well, plus Mexico is a complete bedlam filled hellhole, the worst on earth now for overall murders. Why would we want to merge with a third world kleptocracy?
[02:57:00.440 --> 02:57:15.440]  I can't imagine. But they're sending their people in here and teaching their kids that Mexico really owns California, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona. And they should not be taught that in the public schools.
[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:20.440]  I think we should have them taught the truth and not lies like that.
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:28.440]  Well, I mean, I would even call that liberal. That's the globalist agenda through our schools and, you know, why did Bush push all of that just like Clinton, just like Obama?
[02:57:28.440 --> 02:57:39.440]  And that's my whole point about, you know, really going after conservatives and holding their feet to the fire. I've not been a fan of Rick Perry, but he's trying to, you know, restrict abortions here and trying to make women get sonograms, which is, I think, a good thing.
[02:57:39.440 --> 02:57:41.440]  What's your view on that?
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:54.440]  Oh, yes. And I think if you see the new polls, well, of course, most of the Republicans who were elected in November are pro-life. It is just an amazing change. And the change in the public opinion polls is great.
[02:57:54.440 --> 02:58:08.440]  And I attribute a lot of that to the picture. You know, we're a kind of a picture society. People don't read much anymore. And when you look at the picture, they say, oh, that looks like a baby. Even a second grader can figure that out.
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:20.440]  Absolutely. Well, Phyllis Levy, thank you for coming on and being interrogated about things here. And we really appreciate you spending time with us and look forward to talking to you again in the near future as things unfold.
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:26.440]  EagleForum.org. We'll talk to you again in the near future. Have a great week coming up.
[02:58:26.440 --> 02:58:27.440]  Have a great day.
[02:58:27.440 --> 02:58:33.440]  All right. There goes Phyllis Levy. And I brought up the CMP witch hunt thing while she was on with us.
[02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:41.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, get this story about Ventura suing them out to everybody. It points out the sexual abuse they want to put on all of us.
