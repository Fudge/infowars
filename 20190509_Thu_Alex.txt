[00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.415]  We're live, May 9th, 2019.
[00:00:09.415 --> 00:00:14.538]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:17.560]  Alex Jones is a new category.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.382]  His name and his website
[00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:24.439]  Will not be spoken or texted.
[00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.163]  They even got live systems now on their apps where they're going to listen to what you're saying in live time.
[00:00:29.163 --> 00:00:34.907]  And if you speak the word Alex Jones, you will be banned.
[00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:39.831]  InfoWars, of course, is that web show and website led by rageaholic Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:40.791]  I want them silenced.
[00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:41.632]  I want them muted.
[00:00:41.632 --> 00:00:44.214]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:00:44.214 --> 00:00:45.415]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:51.350]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:00.056]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:13.164]  They put a press release out, they said, we have a new level of banning, and Alex Jones will be the first person ever, with AI computers, watching in live time, that if you say Alex Jones on Facebook, 2.2 billion people,
[00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:15.547]  That's bigger than China.
[00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:17.108]  That's more people than China.
[00:01:17.108 --> 00:01:21.172]  That's 700 million more people than China has.
[00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:22.834]  That's 2.2 billion people.
[00:01:22.834 --> 00:01:26.597]  You cannot say Alex Jones' name or info worse.
[00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:28.939]  Why is it that the six individuals were banned by Facebook?
[00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.441]  What makes them different from others?
[00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:39.769]  Well, these are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them from the platform the other day.
[00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:50.612]  I don't think anyone's kind of pretending anymore that this is just about Alex Jones, or Paul Joseph Watson, or people you've only sort of heard of, or Laura Loomer, or whatever.
[00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:58.533]  This is about anybody who dissents from the corporate view of what should be talked about.
[00:01:58.533 --> 00:01:59.454]  They're crushed!
[00:01:59.454 --> 00:02:04.495]  So why is no one defending the majority of Americans against this threat to our speech?
[00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.749]  That's an extremely good question.
[00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:13.353]  You know, there actually is one person, one very prominent person out there, who is calling for mass civil disobedience.
[00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:21.638]  And, brace yourself, it's Snoop Dogg, who just ordered all of his followers to start sharing Louis Farrakhan videos and footage on Facebook and Instagram.
[00:02:21.638 --> 00:02:22.519]  I stand with him.
[00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.419]  I'm with him.
[00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.321]  Ban me, mother******.
[00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:25.701]  Ban me.
[00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:28.381]  Because I'm going to keep posting this shit.
[00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:30.862]  I'm going to keep putting Minister Louis Farrakhan out there.
[00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:32.062]  That's my dear brother.
[00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:36.843]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and Infowars.com?
[00:02:36.843 --> 00:02:41.963]  You know, Infowars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[00:02:41.963 --> 00:02:49.225]  And while he's promoting and legitimizing this news organization, we should also talk about how he's trying to tear down credible sources for news.
[00:02:49.225 --> 00:02:52.025]  The Washington Post, The New York Times, CNN.
[00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.966]  He was questioning why these news organizations have the ability to be on Twitter.
[00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:56.886]  Why are they not banned?
[00:02:57.106 --> 00:03:00.747]  Right, while saying that the Infowars should be reinstated.
[00:03:00.747 --> 00:03:01.567]  It's nuts!
[00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:06.769]  CNN, they had 10 million viewers an hour back in Larry King's heyday.
[00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.309]  They got rid of him when it dropped to like 9 million.
[00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.410]  They hired Piers Morgan and went to like 2 million.
[00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.171]  Now their top rated shows have a million viewers, their average show 50,000 an hour.
[00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:18.712]  Local radio shows have more listeners.
[00:03:19.651 --> 00:03:27.493]  See, last year, he knew who all my sponsors were on YouTube, even though you'd have to watch for hours to figure out who they were, and geolocating.
[00:03:27.493 --> 00:03:32.854]  Ads only popped up in certain areas of the country, so he couldn't find out unless he was in my account, him and Stelter.
[00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:35.755]  And then they were, it was in the news, so was Media Matters.
[00:03:35.755 --> 00:03:40.056]  They knew how much I was being paid, they had a whole list of all these sponsors that would opt in to
[00:03:41.016 --> 00:03:42.076]  Buy into my show?
[00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:45.737]  Oh my gosh, the Pentagon was running Marine Corps and Army ads!
[00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:49.738]  He tattled on that, and boy, they did what General Stelter said.
[00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:51.018]  President Trump.
[00:03:51.018 --> 00:03:53.759]  InfoWars content is useful to him.
[00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:56.140]  InfoWars personalities align with him.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.781]  He even gave an interview to Alex Jones back on the campaign trail.
[00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:05.702]  On Saturday, Trump went on a Twitter spree and said it's so great to watch this while sharing a video from InfoWars.
[00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:07.183]  The hate is clearly over there.
[00:04:07.183 --> 00:04:08.423]  He's trying to get that screamer.
[00:04:08.423 --> 00:04:11.585]  You can feel the vibes of hate coming from over there.
[00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.406]  And you look over here, the people aren't screaming at this.
[00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:15.667]  Peaceful protesting.
[00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:18.268]  This is not what peaceful protesting is all about.
[00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:20.590]  This is what they think is acceptable.
[00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.450]  This is not what Trump's saying here.
[00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.411]  But they don't understand that.
[00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:26.733]  I'm gonna tell you that again.
[00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:34.899]  Big Tech has access to everything you do and they give CNN and the Southern Property Law Center and Media Matters access to your private banking information.
[00:04:34.899 --> 00:04:36.120]  It's totally criminal!
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.883]  But see, Big Tech, oh, they're a private company.
[00:04:38.883 --> 00:04:46.248]  So they can collude with other companies and lie to you and sell your data and do false advertising and tell you to come build up their platform and then pull the rug out from under you.
[00:04:46.248 --> 00:04:48.030]  Then they can call you a Nazi when they ban you.
[00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.933]  And then they can tell their users you don't say their name or we'll kick you off.
[00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:05.691]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:07.492]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:09.233]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.075]  Now, I can make them strong.
[00:05:11.075 --> 00:05:12.736]  Now, I can instruct them.
[00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:14.457]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[00:05:14.457 --> 00:05:15.438]  But not once I'm gone.
[00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:20.681]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:05:20.681 --> 00:05:26.285]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:29.908]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:34.891]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:41.796]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:45.438]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:05:45.538 --> 00:05:53.166]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:59.774]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:06:05.288 --> 00:06:09.290]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:17.174]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.066]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Thursday, May 9th, 2019 global broadcast.
[00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:44.207]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:44.207 --> 00:06:45.388]  We'll be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:49.312]  Then Owen Schroyer is loaded for Bayer to take on the Globalists.
[00:06:49.312 --> 00:06:53.856]  And that, of course, is coming up at 3 o'clock Central Standard Time today.
[00:06:53.856 --> 00:06:56.118]  Right before I went live today, obviously, David Knight, 8 a.m.
[00:06:56.118 --> 00:06:57.780]  to 11 a.m., knocking it out of the park.
[00:06:59.893 --> 00:07:04.195]  I am truly overwhelmed today with the knowledge and the information that we've got here.
[00:07:04.195 --> 00:07:09.437]  The co-founder of Facebook has come out and said the company needs to be broken up.
[00:07:09.437 --> 00:07:19.042]  Now he says this from a leftist perspective, and I've been predicting this is coming, so I want to break down the next moves that are about to unfold.
[00:07:19.042 --> 00:07:23.364]  Then, I want to get into the fact that the
[00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:48.400]  Aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln has cleared the Suez Canal and we have not been closer to war with Iran since Operation Praying Mantis in 1988 when the United States sunk a bunch of their ships there in the Persian Gulf and that could really trigger something serious because Iran conservatively has ten times the military prowess they had back then and sleeper cells all over the world.
[00:07:49.662 --> 00:08:02.128]  Also, we have the feds released, secretly, 168,000 illegal immigrant family members into communities just in the last fiscal year.
[00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:03.228]  And that's just what we know about.
[00:08:03.228 --> 00:08:08.331]  This is the collapse of the failed border and part of a larger operation to destroy the country.
[00:08:09.312 --> 00:08:12.493]  So we'll be looking at all of this today and so much more.
[00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:28.739]  But first, there are full videos that are up on newswars.com and infowars.com by Caitlin Bennett, the prophetic and prolific and just energizer bunny reporter with her crew.
[00:08:28.739 --> 00:08:35.401]  It's her fiance and her camera guy together as a dynamic trio.
[00:08:35.401 --> 00:08:36.762]  The videos she's been getting
[00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:38.887]  Are just incredible.
[00:08:38.887 --> 00:08:48.294]  And the ideas that she's had to go on these colleges and to illustrate what they're doing and what they're up to and what they're saying are just incredible.
[00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.315]  Now, both these videos are 15 minutes long.
[00:08:50.315 --> 00:08:57.520]  I'm not going to air them in full here today, but I am going to air some pieces of them.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:07.368]  But the first thing I'm going to air is a compilation where college students, for the first time ever, pay reparations for slavery.
[00:09:08.462 --> 00:09:11.683]  Now again, that's about a 50-minute report, more than two minutes of it.
[00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:17.766]  The full report is something you need to see and share with others to see the brainwashing, the cult-like control at universities.
[00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:34.673]  And there's another video that's up on InfoWars.com of what happens to pro-lifers that have permits to be out in public and what happens in compilations of liberals, leftists attacking people for their First Amendment.
[00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:35.694]  Video captures moment.
[00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:40.532]  The so-called feminist attack peaceful pro-life demonstrators.
[00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:42.012]  That's from the Daily Caller.
[00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:45.273]  So I'm going to air both of these pieces and then plunge into the news.
[00:09:45.273 --> 00:09:54.254]  But the authoritarianism we see on the colleges, is the authoritarianism we see in big tech, is the authoritarianism we see everywhere that the left is in control.
[00:09:54.254 --> 00:09:55.354]  They are not the left.
[00:09:55.354 --> 00:09:58.075]  They are a criminal cult.
[00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:03.076]  But then, I am going to air most of one of her 15-minute reports.
[00:10:03.076 --> 00:10:04.336]  Should I do it this hour or next hour?
[00:10:04.336 --> 00:10:05.496]  Because I've got to analyze it.
[00:10:08.217 --> 00:10:10.780]  She was at Penn State and she didn't edit this.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.386]  I mean, she cut out the spaces, but this is everyone she talked to.
[00:10:15.386 --> 00:10:17.528]  Everyone but one person was a drooling
[00:10:18.857 --> 00:10:23.898]  You would say, I don't mean this meanly, autistic or mentally retarded, but they're not.
[00:10:23.898 --> 00:10:26.959]  This is what the smartphones and the culture has done to millennials.
[00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:28.459]  This is what they're like.
[00:10:28.459 --> 00:10:32.660]  You go to UT, you think you're in a Dawn of the Dead movie.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.461]  People even walk with their hands hanging down and they go, drag their feet.
[00:10:37.461 --> 00:10:38.641]  They've been soul sucked.
[00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:41.362]  They have no inclination to build anything.
[00:10:41.362 --> 00:10:42.982]  They have no life spark.
[00:10:44.412 --> 00:10:47.055]  Unless they get mad at you, then they physically attack you.
[00:10:47.055 --> 00:10:50.119]  But even then, it's a very zombie-like attack.
[00:10:50.119 --> 00:10:51.260]  Very zombie-like attack.
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.645]  So, radio listeners can hear all of this, obviously.
[00:10:55.645 --> 00:10:57.767]  People can watch, though, the verboten, forbidden...
[00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.620]  Information at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.382]  And please share that live feed.
[00:11:03.382 --> 00:11:06.304]  That's how we get to new people in this culture war.
[00:11:06.304 --> 00:11:10.087]  But they want us taken out of the picture, obviously, because we're very effective, because you're effective.
[00:11:10.087 --> 00:11:11.328]  But I know they're not going to stop you.
[00:11:11.328 --> 00:11:12.429]  They haven't so far.
[00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:13.950]  And I believe in you, you believe in me.
[00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.172]  So here's these two reports.
[00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:20.735]  We're here at Youngstown State University today with Joel Patrick.
[00:11:20.735 --> 00:11:23.798]  And I'm here asking people if they will pay me some reparations.
[00:11:33.288 --> 00:11:36.429]  Do you support reparations for black people because of slavery?
[00:11:36.429 --> 00:11:40.729]  To some extent, yes.
[00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:41.249]  What about you?
[00:11:41.249 --> 00:11:42.290]  Do you support?
[00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.250]  Definitely?
[00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.670]  Perfect!
[00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:45.450]  So we have Joel over here, Joel Patrick.
[00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.390]  He has a reparation jar.
[00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:50.211]  You guys have the chance to pay him for your crimes.
[00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:52.031]  I just gave him ten bucks to pick up my exams.
[00:11:52.031 --> 00:11:53.151]  You did?
[00:11:53.151 --> 00:11:54.372]  Ten dollars?
[00:11:54.372 --> 00:11:55.192]  Alright, here we go.
[00:11:55.192 --> 00:11:57.912]  Grown men are going to get out their wallets to pay for slavery.
[00:11:57.912 --> 00:12:01.653]  Alright, that was close too.
[00:12:03.248 --> 00:12:04.969]  All right.
[00:12:04.969 --> 00:12:08.290]  You have been forgiven for the crimes against my ancestors.
[00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.251]  Are you a professor here?
[00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:09.771]  Yeah.
[00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.472]  What do you teach?
[00:12:11.472 --> 00:12:12.613]  What is this for, anyway?
[00:12:12.613 --> 00:12:13.613]  It's for YouTube.
[00:12:13.613 --> 00:12:13.973]  YouTube?
[00:12:13.973 --> 00:12:15.054]  Oh my God.
[00:12:15.054 --> 00:12:16.675]  Yeah, I would love to be paid reparations.
[00:12:16.675 --> 00:12:17.315]  Okay, here we go.
[00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:18.736]  For slavery.
[00:12:18.736 --> 00:12:19.376]  For slavery?
[00:12:19.376 --> 00:12:20.496]  That's all I get as a dollar?
[00:12:20.496 --> 00:12:21.997]  You can keep it.
[00:12:21.997 --> 00:12:23.618]  I want more money than that.
[00:12:23.618 --> 00:12:25.539]  Do you support reparations for slavery?
[00:12:26.756 --> 00:12:28.959]  Yes, but at the moment I gotta go to exams.
[00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:30.080]  Well, I'll walk with you.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.904]  So, you support reparations for slavery.
[00:12:32.904 --> 00:12:38.531]  We have Joel here, who has a reparations jar, and you can pay right now for reparations.
[00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:39.732]  Alright.
[00:12:39.732 --> 00:12:39.913]  Well...
[00:12:40.851 --> 00:12:45.413]  As I said, I apologize for being on the run, but there you go.
[00:12:45.413 --> 00:12:46.574]  You're actually paying?
[00:12:46.574 --> 00:12:46.874]  Yes.
[00:12:46.874 --> 00:12:48.094]  Did you own slaves?
[00:12:48.094 --> 00:12:53.276]  No, I did not, but I mean, I'm not a fan of the history behind it, so.
[00:12:53.276 --> 00:12:55.277]  Okay, thank you for paying for your crimes.
[00:12:55.277 --> 00:12:58.339]  We have Joel here, and he has his reparations jar.
[00:12:58.339 --> 00:13:01.780]  Are you willing to give him reparation money?
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:02.820]  Why not?
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:03.641]  Okay, perfect.
[00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:05.141]  Okay.
[00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:06.182]  How much do you want her to give you?
[00:13:07.284 --> 00:13:13.108]  Well, what is the crimes of an entire country worth?
[00:13:13.108 --> 00:13:14.829]  Um, I'm not really sure.
[00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:19.232]  I don't have a lot of money on me, and I can't put a number.
[00:13:19.232 --> 00:13:22.894]  Alright.
[00:13:22.894 --> 00:13:25.496]  You are forgiven for the crimes of your ancestors.
[00:13:25.496 --> 00:13:29.179]  And make sure that you support Caitlyn at TheInfoWarsStore.com.
[00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:32.761]  Make sure that you go there and you get the super male vitality.
[00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:33.241]  You need it.
[00:13:33.241 --> 00:13:35.203]  You gotta have it.
[00:13:37.043 --> 00:13:37.323]  Yes.
[00:13:37.323 --> 00:13:37.604]  You do?
[00:13:37.604 --> 00:13:37.784]  Yes.
[00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:38.625]  Ma'am, don't do that.
[00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:39.165]  Please.
[00:13:39.165 --> 00:13:40.266]  You're a f***ing terrible person!
[00:13:40.266 --> 00:13:40.807]  Ma'am, stop.
[00:13:40.807 --> 00:13:42.008]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:42.008 --> 00:13:42.529]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:43.389]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.870]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.611]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:44.611 --> 00:13:45.191]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.332]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:46.332 --> 00:13:46.873]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:46.873 --> 00:13:47.754]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:47.754 --> 00:13:48.214]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:48.214 --> 00:13:48.815]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:48.815 --> 00:13:49.175]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:49.816]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:49.816 --> 00:13:50.196]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:50.196 --> 00:13:50.837]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:50.837 --> 00:13:51.397]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.018]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:52.599]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:53.319]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:53.319 --> 00:13:53.780]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:54.621]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:54.621 --> 00:13:54.981]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:54.981 --> 00:13:55.682]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:55.682 --> 00:13:56.543]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:56.543 --> 00:13:57.544]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:57.544 --> 00:13:58.104]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:58.104 --> 00:13:59.045]  You're a terrible person!
[00:13:59.045 --> 00:13:59.486]  Ma'am, stop that.
[00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:00.426]  You're a terrible person!
[00:14:00.426 --> 00:14:00.647]  Ma'am
[00:14:06.613 --> 00:14:08.774]  I don't know what it is I'm listening to.
[00:14:08.774 --> 00:14:14.257]  Instead of putting her handcuffs, dragging her off, all that good stuff, we're going to cite her, which is the same thing as an arrest.
[00:14:14.257 --> 00:14:15.498]  It's an arrest by citation.
[00:14:15.498 --> 00:14:22.722]  Is she going to do something?
[00:14:22.722 --> 00:14:31.547]  Stay out.
[00:14:31.547 --> 00:14:33.749]  Just keep it.
[00:14:34.881 --> 00:14:36.481]  It's a baby.
[00:14:36.481 --> 00:14:43.002]  Someone is raped and she gave birth and she decided to kill her three-year-old child.
[00:14:43.002 --> 00:14:46.043]  Get the **** out of here with this bulls**t, man!
[00:14:46.043 --> 00:14:46.543]  No, you don't!
[00:14:46.543 --> 00:14:50.024]  This is bulls**t!
[00:14:50.024 --> 00:14:58.805]  Get the **** out of here!
[00:14:58.805 --> 00:15:03.386]  This is bulls**t!
[00:15:04.962 --> 00:15:06.163]  No, it's not, man!
[00:15:06.163 --> 00:15:07.905]  It's wrong!
[00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:08.485]  It's their selves.
[00:15:08.485 --> 00:15:10.467]  They're the size of a dime, they're selling.
[00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:12.088]  Sir, you need to turn to Jesus Christ.
[00:15:12.088 --> 00:15:13.529]  He can set you free from your sin.
[00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:14.590]  Listen here, son.
[00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:15.491]  Alright?
[00:15:15.491 --> 00:15:17.912]  I'm as gay as the day is long and twice as sunny.
[00:15:17.912 --> 00:15:23.116]  I don't give a f*** what you think Jesus tells me and what I should and should not be doing.
[00:15:23.116 --> 00:15:24.638]  These are image bearers of God.
[00:15:24.638 --> 00:15:24.978]  Alright, guys.
[00:15:27.054 --> 00:15:32.556]  Again, this is the left always trying to silence everyone and then saying we're trying to silence them while they do it.
[00:15:32.556 --> 00:15:40.858]  These are the wholly anointed ones who think they're the cool kids and who are directed by the post-humanist technocracy.
[00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:42.339]  That's what this is.
[00:15:42.339 --> 00:15:47.441]  There is a open world government program to end humanity as we know it.
[00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:50.362]  Remember, we give you next decade's news today.
[00:15:50.362 --> 00:15:54.663]  We are the globalist number one enemy because we represent the future of humanity.
[00:15:59.338 --> 00:16:01.560]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:02.842]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[00:16:02.842 --> 00:16:03.442]  Hey, whatcha doing?
[00:16:03.442 --> 00:16:04.924]  Ah, Mother's Day, remember?
[00:16:04.924 --> 00:16:05.224]  Oh, yeah.
[00:16:05.224 --> 00:16:09.608]  So I'm making lists, gotta plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts in case she wants to return.
[00:16:09.608 --> 00:16:11.290]  Uh, you know there's an easier way, right?

[00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:34.913]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.913 --> 00:17:37.955]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.955 --> 00:17:43.878]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.878 --> 00:17:47.660]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.940]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.281]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:56.484]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.484 --> 00:17:57.905]  Available at Amazon Books.

[00:20:31.215 --> 00:20:32.378]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:20:32.378 --> 00:20:38.193]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, May 9th, 2019 broadcast.
[00:20:38.193 --> 00:20:40.378]  What I'm gonna do is open the phones up.
[00:20:42.363 --> 00:20:46.425]  In this hour, into the next hour, and into the third hour as we go through a lot of this news.
[00:20:46.425 --> 00:20:49.667]  And get into any topic you want, any issue, any area.
[00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:55.051]  But first time callers, again, is who we're going to be taking phone calls from.
[00:20:55.051 --> 00:20:55.931]  The number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:20:55.931 --> 00:20:56.091]  877-789-Alex.
[00:20:56.091 --> 00:20:56.632]  Again, 877-789-2539.
[00:20:56.632 --> 00:20:58.913]  And obviously, I'd like to get your take on
[00:21:08.539 --> 00:21:10.480]  The so-called constitutional crisis.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.421]  The Democrats want to continue their fake witch hunt.
[00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:19.083]  Also, I want to get your take on one of the co-founders of Facebook coming out.
[00:21:19.083 --> 00:21:22.204]  Good personal friends with Zuckerberg saying the company needs to be broken up.
[00:21:22.204 --> 00:21:23.564]  What's really behind that?
[00:21:23.564 --> 00:21:26.065]  I'm going to give you my take on it.
[00:21:26.065 --> 00:21:30.247]  Aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln passes through Suez Canal last night en route.
[00:21:31.067 --> 00:21:32.949]  to Iran as tensions soar.
[00:21:32.949 --> 00:21:34.471]  We're going to be breaking all that down.
[00:21:34.471 --> 00:21:38.295]  Feds released 168,000 illegal immigrant family members into communities.
[00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:44.242]  A Colorado shooting suspect was transitioning from a girl to a male.
[00:21:44.242 --> 00:21:46.905]  A second suspect said he hates Christians.
[00:21:48.052 --> 00:21:55.415]  That's why you'll barely ever hear about that in the news again, but you better believe that it was two right-wingers doing it.
[00:21:55.415 --> 00:22:10.121]  You would be hearing that all gun owners are guilty, all Christians are guilty, but because this is apparently too leftist, whacked out as usual, you're going to see that brushed under the rug extremely quickly.
[00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:10.882]  That's just some
[00:22:12.307 --> 00:22:15.128]  of the news that we're going to be covering here today.
[00:22:15.128 --> 00:22:20.269]  877-789-2539 is the number to join us.
[00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:25.391]  The first thing I want to get into right now is what Sean Hannity talked about last night.
[00:22:25.391 --> 00:22:28.952]  I'm going to play a short clip of his opening monologue.
[00:22:28.952 --> 00:22:33.313]  The full show is up on Infowars.com and is worth sharing.
[00:22:33.313 --> 00:22:35.594]  And most listeners will say, hey, this is old news to us.
[00:22:35.594 --> 00:22:37.595]  We're sick of hearing about Russiagate.
[00:22:37.595 --> 00:22:39.395]  Exactly.
[00:22:39.395 --> 00:22:41.056]  If Trump doesn't go on the offense,
[00:22:42.543 --> 00:22:48.184]  And if the Justice Department doesn't, and if the Republicans don't, it doesn't matter how many crimes the Democrats have committed.
[00:22:48.184 --> 00:22:50.744]  They're going to make up stuff on Republicans.
[00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:53.465]  They're going to harass everybody in Trump's orbit.
[00:22:53.465 --> 00:22:55.865]  They're going to continue to try to sabotage the economy.
[00:22:55.865 --> 00:22:58.346]  And so, it's the right thing to do.
[00:22:58.346 --> 00:23:00.586]  It's got to be done.
[00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:03.847]  And we're dealing with out-of-control, arrogant criminals like this.
[00:23:03.847 --> 00:23:06.487]  The only thing they know is strength.
[00:23:06.487 --> 00:23:10.348]  And most of these Democrats are complicit in the cover-ups as well.
[00:23:12.366 --> 00:23:16.850]  They're not going to stop this whole Russiagate thing until we stop them.
[00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.912]  And so they've got dozens of other investigations fired up.
[00:23:19.912 --> 00:23:20.853]  They're all fraudulent.
[00:23:20.853 --> 00:23:24.375]  And the witch hunt should be over.
[00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:26.757]  Here's Sean Hannity talking about it last night.
[00:23:26.757 --> 00:23:30.880]  And of course, then we'll expand on the fact that no president ever put up with this.
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.502]  They always declared executive privilege.
[00:23:32.502 --> 00:23:34.623]  Trump didn't.
[00:23:34.623 --> 00:23:36.425]  Now he is.
[00:23:36.425 --> 00:23:39.587]  And well, now they're claiming he's involved in obstruction.
[00:23:39.587 --> 00:23:41.149]  It's just nothing but fraud.
[00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.389]  Here it is.
[00:23:42.657 --> 00:23:52.326]  We start tonight with breaking news about the President fighting back after two plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation.
[00:23:52.326 --> 00:23:55.849]  1.5 million documents handed over.
[00:23:55.849 --> 00:24:03.457]  Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress.
[00:24:03.457 --> 00:24:04.378]  Not one time.
[00:24:04.898 --> 00:24:08.721]  Did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege?
[00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:09.923]  Not once.
[00:24:09.923 --> 00:24:19.851]  Even White House counsel, which is, to me, unfathomable, Don McGahn, spent 30 hours with Mueller's Democratic pals and Hillary's attorney.
[00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:35.584]  Now the president saying enough is enough and today the president did finally say enough is enough by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report and the White House ordered former counsel Don McGahn from testifying before Congress.
[00:24:35.584 --> 00:24:37.545]  They already have 30 hours.
[00:24:37.545 --> 00:24:45.391]  The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated, not by the House Judiciary Committee, by their staff.
[00:24:46.092 --> 00:24:52.938]  For the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened.
[00:24:52.938 --> 00:24:56.401]  And the Attorney General is saying, and it's not going to happen now.
[00:24:56.401 --> 00:25:01.765]  And the endless stream of document subpoenas, they are now being rejected by the administration.
[00:25:01.765 --> 00:25:11.273]  In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost, and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge
[00:25:11.653 --> 00:25:16.676]  Which is born out of a mass psychotic rage against the president.
[00:25:16.676 --> 00:25:21.219]  And by the way, four separate independent, four!
[00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:26.463]  They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results.
[00:25:26.463 --> 00:25:30.065]  The nine-month FBI counterintelligence investigation.
[00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:32.887]  Oh, Peter Strzok didn't know they were there.
[00:25:32.887 --> 00:25:36.429]  Oh, we had nothing just before the appointment of Mueller.
[00:25:36.429 --> 00:25:37.390]  Lisa Page said.
[00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.633]  We have the House Intel Committee investigation.
[00:25:40.633 --> 00:25:44.837]  No collusion, no conspiracy, no cooperation with Russia.
[00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:47.039]  The bipartisan Senate investigation.
[00:25:47.039 --> 00:25:50.282]  And now, the 20-month Mueller witch hunt.
[00:25:50.282 --> 00:25:52.284]  All determining the same thing.
[00:25:52.284 --> 00:25:55.067]  No collusion, no obstruction.
[00:25:55.067 --> 00:26:00.613]  Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing in legal fees?
[00:26:00.613 --> 00:26:01.273]  And for what?
[00:26:01.934 --> 00:26:07.298]  What about every single person that has been called before the committees or called before Mueller?
[00:26:07.298 --> 00:26:09.280]  They all have to pay for lawyers.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.881]  Lawyers in Washington, D.C.
[00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:13.583]  can be as much as $1,000 an hour.
[00:26:13.583 --> 00:26:19.768]  Now they're going to be called in to be asked the same questions now a fourth, fifth, and sixth time?
[00:26:19.768 --> 00:26:30.756]  This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power and, frankly, a brand new taxpayer-funded witch hunt designed to smear the duly elected President of the United States.
[00:26:30.776 --> 00:26:34.860]  And then he goes on to say anybody in the orbit is being harassed and terrorized.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.823]  Yes, we have a right and a duty to stop it.
[00:26:37.823 --> 00:26:39.144]  And so you expand on that.
[00:26:39.144 --> 00:26:50.055]  There's a clip up on Infowars.com that we're going to play when we come back of Jim Jordan's boil down yesterday during the contempt hearing on Attorney General Barr.
[00:26:50.055 --> 00:26:51.436]  And he says, you know what this is?
[00:26:51.436 --> 00:26:52.317]  It's a smoke screen.
[00:26:53.584 --> 00:26:58.488]  And a cover up for your illegal warrants and your illegal witch hunt.
[00:26:58.488 --> 00:27:00.889]  And we have all of the documents.
[00:27:00.889 --> 00:27:02.130]  We have all the proof.
[00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:09.255]  And Louie Gohmert goes on from Texas and says, listen, I wish you Democrats would stop this, but you're not.
[00:27:09.255 --> 00:27:12.257]  So we're coming after you and you're going to get prosecuted.
[00:27:12.257 --> 00:27:13.398]  So get ready.
[00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:15.280]  And the Democrats look scared.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.061]  They're all in on it at the top.
[00:27:18.206 --> 00:27:20.508]  They really thought they'd keep Trump from getting elected.
[00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:22.850]  Then they thought they'd remove him.
[00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:23.931]  And now they're so desperate.
[00:27:23.931 --> 00:27:25.752]  It makes them more dangerous.
[00:27:25.752 --> 00:27:27.694]  That's what I keep getting back to.
[00:27:27.694 --> 00:27:29.535]  These people are dangerous.
[00:27:29.535 --> 00:27:41.765]  And now they've accelerated their timetable of censorship against nationalists, against Trump supporters, against people that just want our country to be free and common sense and not globalist.
[00:27:41.765 --> 00:27:42.726]  So it's gotten serious.
[00:27:42.726 --> 00:27:44.807]  We're going to come back into some of that Jim Jordan clip.
[00:27:44.807 --> 00:27:46.309]  Then I'm going to start taking your phone calls.
[00:27:47.398 --> 00:27:56.495]  We have a best-selling author coming on who first got banned on Amazon and then he's getting banned everywhere else and now he's having his bank accounts taken away all because he talked about men's
[00:27:57.927 --> 00:27:58.467]  Empowerment
[00:28:28.207 --> 00:28:41.376]  To the new digital age and merging with the silicon that is the religion of Silicon Valley you have been warned told you that Decades ago now it's all over the news people say of course humans are bad.
[00:28:41.376 --> 00:28:44.739]  Let's get rid of them immediately Yes, this is the real world.
[00:28:44.739 --> 00:28:46.020]  It's really happening.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.581]  So how do we keep our consciousness?
[00:28:47.581 --> 00:28:49.722]  How do we save our awareness our souls?
[00:28:49.722 --> 00:28:52.724]  How do we keep from being sucked in deceived by this?
[00:28:52.724 --> 00:28:54.185]  Well, that's what this broadcast is about.
[00:28:54.185 --> 00:28:56.167]  We're in this together I'm Alex Jones
[00:28:59.187 --> 00:29:03.750]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:05.831]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:07.572]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:07.572 --> 00:29:14.135]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:19.198]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:19.198 --> 00:29:23.901]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:29:24.341 --> 00:29:27.463]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:29:27.463 --> 00:29:34.467]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.

[00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:42.951]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[00:29:42.951 --> 00:29:43.892]  Get clean.
[00:29:43.892 --> 00:29:45.733]  Call now and learn more.
[00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:45.773]  800-506-6740.
[00:29:49.735 --> 00:29:50.236]  800-506-6740 That's 800-506-6740
[00:30:01.363 --> 00:30:02.784]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:30:02.784 --> 00:30:04.684]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:30:04.684 --> 00:30:05.284]  It is.
[00:30:05.284 --> 00:30:10.166]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:30:10.166 --> 00:30:11.327]  The fish oil is better than it.
[00:30:11.327 --> 00:30:13.327]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:30:13.327 --> 00:30:15.828]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:30:15.828 --> 00:30:18.909]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:20.290]  You've got the children's.
[00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.370]  You've got the adults.
[00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:22.391]  You've got the krill oil.
[00:30:22.391 --> 00:30:25.712]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[00:30:26.092 --> 00:30:29.816]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[00:30:29.816 --> 00:30:32.279]  I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:30:32.279 --> 00:30:34.581]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:30:34.581 --> 00:30:36.483]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:30:51.618 --> 00:30:57.657]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:30:57.657 --> 00:30:58.399]  I just can't do it!

[00:32:05.514 --> 00:32:14.096]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:32:14.096 --> 00:32:17.057]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:32:17.057 --> 00:32:18.797]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:32:18.797 --> 00:32:25.079]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:03.829]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:33:03.829 --> 00:33:06.452]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:21.724 --> 00:33:27.709]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.709 --> 00:33:30.711]  Humans, throughout history, have
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:34:00.324]  An issue with seeing threats until it's really, really far down the road and sometimes too late.
[00:34:00.324 --> 00:34:12.070]  But then once things get really, really bad, individuals and people tend to really, really play catch up and a lot of times things get turned around.
[00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:17.794]  And we're really at that point as a civilization and as a country and as a world right now,
[00:34:18.837 --> 00:34:28.122]  That we need to have a discussion about what's being built around us and who's making the decision to build those systems.
[00:34:28.122 --> 00:34:37.587]  And that's why at the bottom of the next hour, I'm going to get into this 20-something page article in the New York Times by the original co-founder of Facebook.
[00:34:39.392 --> 00:34:50.417]  Admitting that Zuckerberg's already controlling what messages you can privately send, already reading everything you are saying, selling it to thousands of third parties.
[00:34:50.417 --> 00:35:04.703]  The only reason he got in trouble over Cambridge Analytica is because they were doing some work for a nationalist or for patriots just getting contact info of potential Trump voters so that Trump could contact them.
[00:35:04.703 --> 00:35:06.024]  That's elementary stuff.
[00:35:07.336 --> 00:35:10.597]  That's 30-year-old technology.
[00:35:10.597 --> 00:35:23.303]  But regardless, Zuckerberg to a great extent is in control of his company and that's why the establishment wants to break it up and basically absorb it into the system because they think Zuckerberg has too much power.
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.741]  In their global government system.
[00:35:26.741 --> 00:35:28.963]  He's one of them in Q-Tel.
[00:35:28.963 --> 00:35:32.385]  The Central Intelligence Agency publicly built the first Facebook.
[00:35:32.385 --> 00:35:34.027]  They gave him the software.
[00:35:34.027 --> 00:35:37.629]  They created the Harvard template that the young whiz kid built it and developed it.
[00:35:37.629 --> 00:35:40.952]  But he has been a serious executive.
[00:35:40.952 --> 00:35:43.153]  He has been very aggressive.
[00:35:43.153 --> 00:35:46.796]  And in that whole military industrial complex technocracy, he's been very, very
[00:35:48.197 --> 00:35:49.458]  Predatory.
[00:35:49.458 --> 00:35:53.721]  And so now they're circling him, getting ready to break him up.
[00:35:53.721 --> 00:36:00.667]  But that won't be to reform Facebook, my friends, for the people.
[00:36:00.667 --> 00:36:05.510]  That will be simply to absorb it into the system and make it even worse.
[00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:07.592]  And if you read the article, it actually admits all that.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.201]  He said, well, Zuckerberg just doesn't need to get rid of hate speech.
[00:36:11.201 --> 00:36:16.223]  He needs to, you know, protect speech by stopping other types of stuff.
[00:36:16.223 --> 00:36:18.284]  So, we need to protect speech by getting rid of it.
[00:36:18.284 --> 00:36:23.766]  It's a very Orwellian, double-think article, and it's very, very serious.
[00:36:23.766 --> 00:36:25.246]  We're going to be going over it.
[00:36:25.246 --> 00:36:27.747]  And a lot of people selfishly say, well, I'm not on Facebook, so why do I care?
[00:36:27.747 --> 00:36:30.408]  Well, 2.2 billion people are.
[00:36:30.408 --> 00:36:33.009]  And so that's going to decide elections all over the world.
[00:36:33.009 --> 00:36:34.310]  That's going to decide the future of
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.546]  This country, other countries, especially if it's not a free and open debate.
[00:36:40.546 --> 00:36:53.220]  And I kept wondering why so much last year during my deplatforming they would say, Jones is calling for violence, Jones is calling for getting battle rivals and killing the media, and you notice they never showed you a clip.
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.541]  They'd say, let me read the quotes.
[00:36:55.435 --> 00:36:58.298]  And then they would take single words, two words, put them together.
[00:36:58.298 --> 00:37:12.912]  I know I've talked a lot about that, but when the whole corporate media lies to create a perception that, okay, Big Tech's banning Alex Jones because he's yelling fire in the theater, what's the real reason they're doing that?
[00:37:12.912 --> 00:37:18.958]  So Big Media and Big Tech have been practicing working together on taking my rights away.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:20.840]  I don't know.
[00:37:34.542 --> 00:37:43.687]  Zuckerberg out of his dictatorial position and then sharing it in these councils and these CFR type roundtables.
[00:37:43.687 --> 00:37:46.689]  So that's really what's going on here right now.
[00:37:46.689 --> 00:37:51.652]  Let's go ahead though and go to the Jim Jordan clip because this just broke minutes ago from The Hill.
[00:37:51.652 --> 00:37:54.233]  It's also up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:37:54.233 --> 00:38:01.477]  Judge orders DOJ to give her unredacted Mueller report portions on stone for private review.
[00:38:01.477 --> 00:38:02.558]  This is an Obama judge.
[00:38:04.247 --> 00:38:18.516]  You've got the prosecution that's Hillary's former chief lawyer, and if you don't think that that's going to get leaked to the Democrats so they can cherry-pick and leak stuff, well, then I've got a bridge I'm really happy to sell you.
[00:38:18.516 --> 00:38:26.641]  So, Stone had actually though asked for this, and it makes sense because he's in the report and blacked out, for him to get this for his defense.
[00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:30.584]  I actually support this, and Trump said declassify the whole thing.
[00:38:31.994 --> 00:38:33.735]  He said he has nothing to hide.
[00:38:33.735 --> 00:38:36.037]  In fact, this is actually going to expose the Democrats to a great extent.
[00:38:36.037 --> 00:38:40.901]  So, that's why some Democrats were like, actually, let's not release the unredacted.
[00:38:40.901 --> 00:38:42.762]  So, this is quite a mesh.
[00:38:42.762 --> 00:38:45.224]  I wonder what's going to happen here.
[00:38:45.224 --> 00:38:51.970]  But let's go ahead and go to Jim Jordan, pointing out the real reason the Democrats are up on their hind legs whenever everybody.
[00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:56.493]  That's because they are covering up for their crimes.
[00:38:56.493 --> 00:39:00.656]  The best way to do that is act like you're innocent and then start trying to accuse everybody else.
[00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:00.957]  Here it is.
[00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.531]  I would ask the chairman.
[00:39:03.531 --> 00:39:05.993]  My understanding is Mr. Mueller is going to be here next week.
[00:39:05.993 --> 00:39:06.533]  Why are we doing it?
[00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:08.795]  You're going to get to ask the guy who wrote the whole darn document.
[00:39:08.795 --> 00:39:10.136]  We're all going to get to ask him questions.
[00:39:10.136 --> 00:39:19.262]  Why don't you hold off on this contempt until at least the guy who wrote the thing spent 22 months and $35 million with a whole bunch of Democrat lawyers putting it together.
[00:39:19.262 --> 00:39:22.745]  Why don't you wait and ask him next week before we do this contempt resolution?
[00:39:22.745 --> 00:39:25.967]  Bill Barr is following the law and what's his reward?
[00:39:25.967 --> 00:39:27.408]  Democrats are going to hold him in contempt.
[00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:31.730]  I don't think today is actually about getting information.
[00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.790]  I don't think it's about getting the unredacted Mueller report.
[00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:38.611]  I don't think last week's hearing was actually about having staff question the Attorney General.
[00:39:38.611 --> 00:39:45.833]  I think it's, as my colleague said earlier, I think it's all about trying to destroy Bill Barr because Democrats are nervous he's going to get to the bottom of everything.
[00:39:45.833 --> 00:39:49.394]  He's going to find out how and why this investigation started in the first place.
[00:39:50.094 --> 00:39:55.420]  Never forget what Bill Barr said a few weeks ago, three and a half weeks ago when he testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:40:00.825]  He said a lot of important things, but he said three, excuse me, four very interesting things.
[00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:06.571]  First, he said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon, term he used, upper echelon of the FBI.
[00:40:06.571 --> 00:40:07.632]  We all know that's the case.
[00:40:08.453 --> 00:40:09.933]  Director Comey's been fired.
[00:40:09.933 --> 00:40:12.054]  Deputy Director McCabe, fired.
[00:40:12.054 --> 00:40:15.274]  Lied three times under oath, according to the Inspector General.
[00:40:15.274 --> 00:40:20.895]  FBI Counsel Jim Baker, demoted and left, currently under investigation by the Justice Department.
[00:40:20.895 --> 00:40:23.296]  Lisa Page, demoted and left.
[00:40:23.296 --> 00:40:27.177]  Peter Strzok, Deputy Head of Counterintelligence, demoted and fired.
[00:40:27.177 --> 00:40:30.917]  Peter Strzok, the guy who ran the Clinton investigation and the Russia investigation.
[00:40:30.917 --> 00:40:32.978]  There was certainly a failure of leadership.
[00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:35.660]  At the upper echelon of the FBI.
[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.763]  Second thing the Attorney General said three and a half weeks ago in front of the Senate Finance Committee.
[00:40:39.763 --> 00:40:41.705]  Spying did occur.
[00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:42.706]  Said it twice.
[00:40:42.706 --> 00:40:44.667]  Yes, spying did occur.
[00:40:44.667 --> 00:40:50.712]  Third he said, there's a basis for my concern about the spying that took place.
[00:40:50.712 --> 00:40:55.717]  And maybe the most interesting thing, two terms he used, that frankly I find frightening.
[00:40:56.357 --> 00:41:03.979]  He said there was, in his judgment, he thinks there may have been unauthorized surveillance and political surveillance.
[00:41:03.979 --> 00:41:05.659]  Scary terms.
[00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:09.940]  We gotta go back to January 3rd, 2017.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:15.082]  Senator Schumer, on the Rachel Maddow Show, talking about then-President-elect Trump, says this.
[00:41:15.082 --> 00:41:20.663]  If you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:28.649]  I don't know if the FBI went after President Trump in six ways, but I sure know they went after him in two ways.
[00:41:29.608 --> 00:41:31.750]  And the first one is the now famous dossier.
[00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:44.560]  On October 21st, 2016, the FBI used one party's opposition research document as the basis to go to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on the other party's... And the inspector general has come out and said that was all illegal.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:45.301]  They did lie.
[00:41:45.301 --> 00:41:47.042]  And where'd you first see that broken?
[00:41:47.042 --> 00:41:47.783]  Here.
[00:41:47.783 --> 00:41:49.144]  That's why we're being punished.
[00:41:49.144 --> 00:41:50.165]  That's why we're being lied about.
[00:41:50.165 --> 00:41:51.126]  That's why we're being attacked.
[00:41:51.126 --> 00:41:52.467]  That's why we're being sued.
[00:41:52.467 --> 00:41:55.950]  It's because we're willing to put things out first when others are afraid to do it.
[00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:57.071]  But you heard Jim Jordan say,
[00:41:58.237 --> 00:42:02.060]  Political spy, political surveillance.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.482]  That's how you get dictatorships.
[00:42:03.482 --> 00:42:05.403]  That's how you get oligarchies.
[00:42:05.403 --> 00:42:09.607]  That's how you get Venezuelas and Nazi Germanys and Maoist Chinas.
[00:42:09.607 --> 00:42:13.670]  And we've been fighting over this for two and a half years.
[00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:21.137]  How are we ever going to beat big tech who's openly moved to China and is helping round up political dissidence by the millions, by the millions, look it up.
[00:42:22.369 --> 00:42:25.910]  When they openly lie to Congress, they'll get in trouble, and everybody knows they're lying.
[00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:37.292]  If we can't even defeat a bunch of mentally defunct Democrats, who have to read off pieces of paper, they can't even talk, like Jim Jordan or I can, or Trump can.
[00:42:37.292 --> 00:42:43.934]  If we can't beat these little criminals, these little Democrat machine criminals, we'll never beat Big Tech.
[00:42:44.778 --> 00:42:47.379]  We have to move against big tech for humanity now.
[00:42:47.379 --> 00:42:49.799]  We have to stop the AI.
[00:42:49.799 --> 00:42:52.360]  Mark my words, or we're all dead soon.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:43:11.785]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[00:43:12.904 --> 00:43:25.273]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant leftist authoritarians like the Young Turks and others get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:43:25.273 --> 00:43:27.194]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:43:27.194 --> 00:43:29.876]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:35.561]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:43:35.561 --> 00:43:39.822]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:43:39.822 --> 00:43:42.102]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:43:42.102 --> 00:43:44.422]  This country is in a war!
[00:43:44.422 --> 00:43:55.104]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:43:55.104 --> 00:43:58.685]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!

[00:45:00.385 --> 00:45:02.686]  Stacy in the great state of Texas.
[00:45:03.817 --> 00:45:06.900]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[00:45:19.591 --> 00:45:25.577]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:26.337]  I appreciate that.
[00:45:26.337 --> 00:45:27.959]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[00:45:27.959 --> 00:45:28.519]  Tell us about it.
[00:45:28.519 --> 00:45:29.340]  Well, it's really great.
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.621]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[00:45:30.621 --> 00:45:31.142]  I take it.
[00:45:31.142 --> 00:45:31.882]  It tastes good.
[00:45:31.882 --> 00:45:33.744]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[00:45:33.744 --> 00:45:35.686]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[00:45:35.686 --> 00:45:39.149]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[00:45:39.189 --> 00:45:42.010]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:43.770]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:45.851]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[00:45:45.851 --> 00:45:46.771]  So, yeah.
[00:45:46.771 --> 00:45:49.212]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[00:45:49.212 --> 00:45:52.033]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[00:45:52.033 --> 00:45:53.193]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[00:45:53.193 --> 00:45:55.014]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:45:59.764 --> 00:46:01.425]  Defeat the globalists.
[00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.165]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:03.165 --> 00:46:04.666]  Defeat the pedophiles.
[00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:06.726]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:06.726 --> 00:46:11.608]  Defeat Alexandra Cortez and her mindless idiocy with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:11.608 --> 00:46:15.429]  Defeat the censors with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:15.429 --> 00:46:23.472]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there but we've just gotten stronger because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:24.412 --> 00:46:27.214]  I am patient zero in the massive banning.
[00:46:27.214 --> 00:46:34.480]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.443]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[00:46:38.443 --> 00:46:44.387]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[00:46:44.387 --> 00:46:47.429]  Call or talk radio, C-SPAN, shout it out loud in public.
[00:46:47.429 --> 00:46:48.911]  Hashtag Alex Jones.
[00:46:48.911 --> 00:46:51.953]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[00:46:55.517 --> 00:46:58.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:36.055 --> 00:47:36.615]  Welcome back.
[00:47:36.615 --> 00:47:37.636]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:47:37.636 --> 00:47:38.337]  Okay.
[00:47:38.337 --> 00:47:39.898]  We've got a load of phone lines.
[00:47:39.898 --> 00:47:43.020]  I'm going to have your calls throughout the rest of the show.
[00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:49.906]  We have one guest joining us who's being de-platformed everywhere because he writes self-help books for men.
[00:47:54.204 --> 00:48:00.747]  Again, that is a big no-no to the globalists, because they don't want to have any leadership, they don't want to have any alpha male types out there.
[00:48:00.747 --> 00:48:06.150]  The left's now teaching there's no such thing as masculinity, that masculinity is a made-up term.
[00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:12.233]  So a man can be a woman, a woman can be a man, you can be a dog if you want, but you can't be masculine.
[00:48:12.233 --> 00:48:15.334]  So that guest will join us for a couple of segments, and then we'll continue with your calls.
[00:48:15.334 --> 00:48:16.455]  We'll go into your calls here in a moment.
[00:48:17.796 --> 00:48:21.680]  There's some really positive video that just went live.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.924]  Kellan McBrain wrote a story about, we'll get to next hour.
[00:48:24.924 --> 00:48:33.033]  Students walk out on dim politicians pushing gun control at the latest school shooting vigil near Columbine in Colorado.
[00:48:33.033 --> 00:48:36.637]  Students said their grief was being politicized and chanted mental health.
[00:48:38.376 --> 00:48:42.482]  Colorado school shooting suspect was transitioning to male.
[00:48:42.482 --> 00:48:43.864]  No, you do not have testes.
[00:48:43.864 --> 00:48:47.108]  You do not have the bones or heart or brain of a male.
[00:48:47.108 --> 00:48:49.511]  You want to be a male and that's your issue.
[00:48:49.511 --> 00:48:53.938]  If you're an adult, you want to take hormones and try to act and look like a male, you are not a male.
[00:48:53.938 --> 00:48:54.979]  There are men and there are women.
[00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:56.780]  Period.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.620]  There are some mutations.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:59.221]  We're going to have a hermaphrodite.
[00:48:59.221 --> 00:49:09.027]  And again, I haven't even gotten into this lately, but the heavy lifting power champion is obviously a big dude and he's got big bones and big muscles for the average power lifter.
[00:49:09.027 --> 00:49:11.429]  And now all women's sports will be dominated by men.
[00:49:14.016 --> 00:49:16.019]  Again, this is 2 plus 2 equals 10.
[00:49:16.019 --> 00:49:16.920]  This is brainwashing.
[00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:24.951]  We're going to go to your calls here in a moment on the waterfront, whatever issue you want to raise, whatever topic you want to get into.
[00:49:24.951 --> 00:49:27.354]  I'm not going to belabor this, but I'm just going to tell listeners this.
[00:49:28.359 --> 00:49:30.200]  Thank you for your support.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.040]  It really means a lot to me.
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.762]  I do this so much that half the time I can't stand to hear my voice.
[00:49:35.762 --> 00:49:42.044]  But I know the show's effective, I know we're getting the truth out, and I appreciate you and all your support and all your prayers.
[00:49:42.044 --> 00:49:46.225]  We make it really easy to support us because everybody needs water filtration systems.
[00:49:46.225 --> 00:49:50.007]  We've got the best, the lowest prices, sit on your countertop and are the best.
[00:49:52.205 --> 00:49:54.047]  We have the best non-GMO heirloom seeds.
[00:49:54.047 --> 00:49:55.549]  We have the best shortwave radios.
[00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:59.573]  And we have great t-shirts and great books and great films, great selection.
[00:49:59.573 --> 00:50:01.816]  And we have really, really good supplements.
[00:50:01.816 --> 00:50:05.340]  The best supplements that are out there at the lowest prices.
[00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:09.084]  You're going to find them with really good ingredients, not with fillers, not with garbage.
[00:50:10.345 --> 00:50:24.030]  Several big sales have to end next week, early next week, and that is a bottle of X2 Deep Earth Iodine, True Atomic Iodine, with a bottle of X3 that's all three types of iodine, including Deep Earth and the other two types, Triiodine.
[00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:27.352]  Shit, that's better for some people than just pure iodine, but not most people.
[00:50:27.992 --> 00:50:29.113]  But it's still excellent.
[00:50:29.113 --> 00:50:33.436]  So, Survival Shield X3, that is at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:50:33.436 --> 00:50:35.117]  Again, no reviews yet on that.
[00:50:35.117 --> 00:50:39.980]  It's a combo, but you can read the thousands of five-star reviews on X2 and X3.
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:42.221]  It's a 99% rating.
[00:50:42.221 --> 00:50:46.864]  No one else even has that on Power Reviews for any supplement.
[00:50:46.864 --> 00:50:48.725]  Ultra 12 is brand new.
[00:50:48.725 --> 00:50:49.446]  It's the same as
[00:50:50.186 --> 00:51:03.597]  Secret 12, it's just twice as strong, the highest quality B12, the highest quality methylcobalamin, and that is now our newest product, 50% off, out of the gates, and that helps fund our operations.
[00:51:03.597 --> 00:51:09.782]  So again, without B12, you will rot away and go the way of the goonie bird.
[00:51:10.816 --> 00:51:12.197]  Without vitamin C, you'll go bye-bye.
[00:51:12.197 --> 00:51:14.438]  There's just a lot of easy-to-get forms of that.
[00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:15.039]  There's not a B12.
[00:51:15.039 --> 00:51:20.362]  There's not a lot of easy-to-get forms of iodine, which you have to have to live.
[00:51:20.362 --> 00:51:29.067]  And so I just think you should really research why the globalists are trying to keep you away from B12 and why they're trying to keep you away from clean iodine.
[00:51:29.067 --> 00:51:32.429]  And if you just look into this, it's startling.
[00:51:32.429 --> 00:51:34.030]  It's staggering.
[00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:36.592]  It is thunderclapping.
[00:51:36.592 --> 00:51:38.153]  When you look at the evidence, just type in
[00:51:39.384 --> 00:51:42.246]  Iodine and IQ.
[00:51:42.246 --> 00:51:45.068]  Iodine deficiency and IQ reduction.
[00:51:45.068 --> 00:51:49.350]  Just start there and you'll be stunned.
[00:51:49.350 --> 00:51:52.112]  You owe it to yourself and your family to investigate this.
[00:51:52.112 --> 00:51:53.653]  Thank you for your support.
[00:51:53.653 --> 00:51:55.634]  Alright, look at all these great callers.
[00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:57.555]  We've got so many of them.
[00:51:57.555 --> 00:52:04.800]  Morgan and Patrick and Mitch and Carson and JD and Darren and California and Ben and Mike and so many others.
[00:52:07.796 --> 00:52:11.637]  Who should we go to first?
[00:52:11.637 --> 00:52:13.258]  Who's been holding the longest?
[00:52:13.258 --> 00:52:17.739]  Let's talk to Darren in Canada.
[00:52:17.739 --> 00:52:19.279]  His son has autism.
[00:52:19.279 --> 00:52:20.079]  Go ahead.
[00:52:20.079 --> 00:52:21.300]  Thank you.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.740]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:23.200]  I'm good, sir.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.401]  Sorry to hear about your son.
[00:52:24.401 --> 00:52:30.102]  Yeah, he actually has autism directly from vaccination.
[00:52:30.102 --> 00:52:35.724]  Like when they vaccinated him, he flatlined on the table and they resuscitated him.
[00:52:36.918 --> 00:52:39.799]  And, um, you know, he's had autism his whole life, right?
[00:52:39.799 --> 00:52:42.961]  Like, special ed classes, psychologists.
[00:52:42.961 --> 00:52:47.563]  And about a year ago, I started giving him the Secret 12.
[00:52:47.563 --> 00:52:52.225]  And I also have a friend who's, like, one of the leading autism doctors, his doctor who works with him.
[00:52:52.225 --> 00:52:56.387]  And I brought him, like, he hasn't, I had never seen him for a few months.
[00:52:56.387 --> 00:53:00.409]  And when he met with him, he was like, oh my god, like, you know, what's going on?
[00:53:00.409 --> 00:53:02.350]  Like, you know, he's so much better.
[00:53:03.539 --> 00:53:05.680]  I showed him the bottle of the Secret 12, right?
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:11.083]  And it was the only thing that I changed with him was giving him B12.
[00:53:11.083 --> 00:53:13.745]  Now he's, you know, he's not in special ed no more.
[00:53:13.745 --> 00:53:18.488]  He's in like normal class and it just completely changed his life and my life.
[00:53:19.378 --> 00:53:21.739]  I know you don't like to be thanked, but thank you.
[00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:58.785]  And they'll come over and say they'll usually have four or five kids and they've got a son sometimes multiple that are autistic and they say no they were fine till 18 months when I took the third round that's genuine generally what happens sometimes it happens first round or second round describe how old your son was what it was like
[00:53:59.645 --> 00:54:09.607]  Because a lot of times they have the convulsion by the time they get home or in the car, sometimes in the hospital or at the clinic, and doctors will even admit, okay, they had a bad reaction.
[00:54:09.607 --> 00:54:12.208]  But the news will lie and say it's insane.
[00:54:12.208 --> 00:54:15.648]  You know, sure, used to we had 1 in 37,000 with autism, now it's 1 in 58.
[00:54:15.648 --> 00:54:17.449]  It's almost all boys.
[00:54:17.449 --> 00:54:20.269]  Describe for our listeners what happened.
[00:54:20.269 --> 00:54:22.010]  This was right when he was born.
[00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:28.771]  He was a few weeks premature and it was like right when he came out in Canada here, they vaccinate him like
[00:54:29.531 --> 00:54:36.758]  As soon as they come out in the hospital and he was fine and they had him in that little, you know, like the little incubator kind of table.
[00:54:36.758 --> 00:54:37.879]  They had him in the NICU unit.
[00:54:37.879 --> 00:54:39.962]  They had him in the little warmer.
[00:54:39.962 --> 00:54:47.930]  Yeah, and they gave him the vaccination and he just, like you said, convulsions, flatlined heart monitor, you know, was code pink, every doctor in there.
[00:54:48.894 --> 00:54:54.599]  They resuscitated him and he's never been a normal baby since, right?
[00:54:54.599 --> 00:55:00.864]  Well, there's a lot of science behind this, but let's just explain what's happening here.
[00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:11.592]  Until about, I know Canada was forever, but until about 10 years ago in the US, no hospital would give a vaccine to a preemie baby because they knew this happened.
[00:55:11.592 --> 00:55:14.915]  But it's part of a eugenics operation where they just try to get the
[00:55:16.283 --> 00:55:24.012]  Nurses and the hospitals to go along with it to see what medical tyranny can implement incrementally by successive approximation.
[00:55:24.012 --> 00:55:28.937]  So this is all ambient background that they just turn up like the frog in the pot.
[00:55:28.937 --> 00:55:31.841]  What you're telling is so important for people that don't
[00:55:32.441 --> 00:55:32.721]  I don't
[00:55:55.376 --> 00:56:04.083]  The National Institutes of Health and others, to the bioethics boards, that they give preemies, including babies that weigh two pounds, all the shots.
[00:56:04.083 --> 00:56:07.986]  Now, in almost every case, the babies die.
[00:56:07.986 --> 00:56:10.087]  But the nurses still do no harm.
[00:56:10.087 --> 00:56:10.968]  They follow the order.
[00:56:10.968 --> 00:56:11.709]  They give the shot.
[00:56:11.709 --> 00:56:15.592]  They're told, well, it's for the greater good, so they don't get sick off something else, even though they have fetal immunity.
[00:56:16.550 --> 00:56:25.244]  Then they defibrillate, they get them back, but usually causes so much brain damage because of oxygen loss, a couple of minutes, there's serious problems.
[00:56:25.244 --> 00:56:27.087]  Then the undeveloped stomachs...
[00:56:28.146 --> 00:56:37.788]  It causes autoimmune disorders, because everything your body learns an immunity to, that is the pathogen that's attenuated, it also learns an immunity to whatever else is in the shot.
[00:56:37.788 --> 00:56:38.908]  So it wrecks their gut.
[00:56:38.908 --> 00:56:42.109]  Then it creates different toxic syndromes in the gut.
[00:56:42.109 --> 00:56:46.089]  This is medical fact, which causes a toxicity in the brain.
[00:56:46.089 --> 00:56:53.251]  And so there's a lot of detox things people do, and yes, iodine, B12, exercise, things like that.
[00:56:53.251 --> 00:56:54.191]  They're overstimulated.
[00:56:55.131 --> 00:57:08.497]  Because it causes autoimmune response in the brain, causes damage in the cerebral cortex, and so the cerebral cortex is unable to filter out everything it's getting from the larger subconscious parts of the brain, the other sections of the brain.
[00:57:08.497 --> 00:57:13.740]  And of course, this is all lay stuff I'm putting out, but a basis in all the deep research.
[00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:16.901]  And so, they know full well what they're doing.
[00:57:16.901 --> 00:57:18.562]  The nurses and doctors don't.
[00:57:18.562 --> 00:57:22.064]  Now, when you say, no, I'm not taking the vaccines to them,
[00:57:23.098 --> 00:57:25.039]  They'll suddenly go, I don't give to my kids either.
[00:57:25.039 --> 00:57:27.140]  A lot of the kids die in here.
[00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.721]  But we're just told to or we lose our jobs.
[00:57:29.721 --> 00:57:31.542]  So everybody knows this.
[00:57:31.542 --> 00:57:32.862]  You're just not supposed to say it.
[00:57:32.862 --> 00:57:36.364]  So when I come back and let you finish, then I'm going to let everybody else.
[00:57:36.364 --> 00:57:40.265]  But that was a very important call.
[00:57:40.265 --> 00:57:44.167]  I want to ask him what happened when his son died in front of them.
[00:57:44.167 --> 00:57:46.748]  Did they try to deny it was the vaccine in the National Health Service?
[00:57:49.838 --> 00:57:53.039]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[00:58:20.669 --> 00:58:22.330]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:25.173]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[00:58:25.173 --> 00:58:28.236]  But they said, look, when you do plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[00:58:28.236 --> 00:58:28.997]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[00:58:28.997 --> 00:58:29.757]  Well, you know what?
[00:58:29.757 --> 00:58:31.039]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[00:58:31.039 --> 00:58:33.020]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.001]  We decided to change the name.
[00:58:34.001 --> 00:58:35.203]  So when you peel off the label...
[00:58:36.423 --> 00:58:40.126]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[00:58:40.126 --> 00:58:42.928]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.

[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.962]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.226 --> 01:00:26.416]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:26.416 --> 01:00:29.498]  I'm talking to a father up with the National Health Service.
[01:00:31.337 --> 01:00:33.758]  And there is no law in Europe, no law here, no law.
[01:00:33.758 --> 01:00:35.519]  You've got to take shots.
[01:00:35.519 --> 01:00:37.820]  They will lie to you and tell you there's a law.
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.801]  There's a regulation.
[01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:40.402]  They have to give you a waiver.
[01:00:40.402 --> 01:00:45.925]  Now they're trying to declare emergencies in Europe and the U.S., places like New York, and make you take vaccines.
[01:00:45.925 --> 01:00:48.446]  But it's the illegal aliens bringing in the strains.
[01:00:50.129 --> 01:00:54.551]  And in many cases, people that have the vaccines are getting what they're supposedly being protected from.
[01:00:54.551 --> 01:01:02.774]  The truth is, it's a covert operation of the eugenics groups, the same ones that put syphilis in vaccines for black people and others around the country and the world.
[01:01:02.774 --> 01:01:11.157]  And if you let shadow government, secret government, deep state that's involved in all this continue to put in your body whatever they want, you're crazy.
[01:01:11.157 --> 01:01:12.337]  So what did they say?
[01:01:12.337 --> 01:01:13.938]  I mean, go back and tell us.
[01:01:13.938 --> 01:01:16.379]  I know it's hard to relive, but it's important for people to hear this so they don't
[01:01:18.143 --> 01:01:19.824]  Not let their kids get hurt.
[01:01:19.824 --> 01:01:20.885]  People need to know what's happening here.
[01:01:20.885 --> 01:01:22.927]  How serious this is.
[01:01:22.927 --> 01:01:23.868]  Describe what happened.
[01:01:23.868 --> 01:01:27.071]  Describe what the so-called doctor said.
[01:01:27.071 --> 01:01:42.584]  Well, like I said, my wife had just had him and so she was over on the table and they had moved him to the little incubator table and I was actually over there consoling her and being with her and I just seemed like
[01:01:43.112 --> 01:01:53.577]  You know, I just heard, like, Code Pink, Code Pink, and then all these doctors come running in, and I seen the nurse pulling away with the vaccine needle, and he just, like, right away, he just flatlined, right?
[01:01:53.577 --> 01:02:11.905]  And then they, like you said, they resuscitated him, and, uh, you know, he's, uh, he's been autistic ever since, but, like, for me, I knew, thanks to you, that, about the dangers of vaccines, so right away, I knew what it was, and I started just, like, you know, freaking right out, and they, like, removed me, and,
[01:02:13.294 --> 01:02:20.897]  You know, I never really got an explanation, just my son was in intensive care for a few weeks and... Oh, they probably gave you more shots when you weren't there.
[01:02:20.897 --> 01:02:21.617]  Exactly.
[01:02:21.617 --> 01:02:24.378]  Like, and the thing is... They love killing babies.
[01:02:24.378 --> 01:02:26.919]  You know, they busted a lot of nurses secretly killing babies.
[01:02:26.919 --> 01:02:30.361]  There's also, some nurses are psychotics, they like to kill babies.
[01:02:30.361 --> 01:02:32.781]  And that's kind of the mad doctor that's above that.
[01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:36.463]  Most doctors in hospitals are nice people, but they follow the orders of the bioethics boards.
[01:02:38.704 --> 01:02:41.927]  If your kids aren't vaccinated, they don't go to school.
[01:02:41.927 --> 01:02:45.951]  I have another son, one year younger, who I never got vaccinated.
[01:02:45.951 --> 01:02:51.356]  I'm native, and I come from British Columbia, in the bush pretty much.
[01:02:51.356 --> 01:02:52.697]  Oh, there you go.
[01:02:52.697 --> 01:02:54.859]  I'm not saying this to be leftist and patronizing.
[01:02:54.859 --> 01:02:56.241]  The left won't tell you this.
[01:02:56.241 --> 01:02:58.323]  You know Canada has the most vicious history.
[01:02:59.003 --> 01:03:01.346]  of attacking Native Americans of anybody.
[01:03:01.346 --> 01:03:06.913]  Killing them, secret death camps, mass graves have been found where they've been killing people just since the 90s.
[01:03:06.913 --> 01:03:08.434]  And so, oh, no wonder.
[01:03:08.434 --> 01:03:10.917]  You were probably, your son was probably targeted.
[01:03:10.917 --> 01:03:15.142]  That probably, the fact that he flatlined so instantly just means he was tough.
[01:03:15.142 --> 01:03:16.424]  They were probably trying to kill him.
[01:03:17.012 --> 01:03:22.619]  Well, and I have another son who we had like, you know, probably nine and a half months later and I was smart.
[01:03:22.619 --> 01:03:26.785]  I kind of went back home, had him naturally like my wife.
[01:03:26.785 --> 01:03:34.975]  I literally had him in a river, you know, in the river where we're from and like the way that my people used to do it and never got them vaccinated.
[01:03:34.975 --> 01:03:35.556]  And then I,
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:48.518]  Started working back in the city and when I came like my kid wasn't allowed in school like I he was about eight years old when he got vaccinated finally but it was uh I was lawyers and child protective services over it and
[01:03:49.170 --> 01:03:56.358]  You know, literally, they said, you know, he's not going to school, and I literally had to vaccinate him, even though, you know... Yeah, well, they lied to you.
[01:03:56.358 --> 01:03:57.579]  They got the waiver forms up there, too.
[01:03:57.579 --> 01:04:00.342]  And let me tell you, none of the rich people are getting the shots.
[01:04:00.342 --> 01:04:01.543]  Or they're getting special shots.
[01:04:01.543 --> 01:04:03.866]  So now it all makes sense.
[01:04:03.866 --> 01:04:06.368]  So I guess you still kind of live in a quasi-tribal area?
[01:04:07.169 --> 01:04:17.873]  Um, yeah, well, uh, yeah, I live in, uh, Vancouver, but, um, I'm from, like, a little, uh... Well, I mean, you understand, since the 20s, all over the Western world, they set up eugenics offices.
[01:04:17.873 --> 01:04:29.517]  And so all those health departments, all the CPS, all of those, uh, social workers were set up in England, out of mouthish, to poison and exterminate poor people.
[01:04:29.517 --> 01:04:31.158]  But that's official history books.
[01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:33.659]  So, see, and I know, I know this sounds insane,
[01:04:34.867 --> 01:04:36.368]  A lot of the social workers are low-level.
[01:04:36.368 --> 01:04:40.991]  They don't know, but the ones above it in the bioethics boards are eugenicists.
[01:04:40.991 --> 01:04:42.292]  Period.
[01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:45.854]  And, you know, I even had Robert Barnes in here last week talking about when he was at Yale.
[01:04:45.854 --> 01:04:48.556]  He was, you know, one of the top people in the class.
[01:04:48.556 --> 01:04:51.278]  They pulled him aside in a secret meeting and said, we want to kill all the black people.
[01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:52.779]  And he said, no, I'm not for that.
[01:04:52.779 --> 01:04:53.479]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:53.479 --> 01:04:54.120]  God bless you, sir.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:58.443]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:04:58.443 --> 01:05:01.525]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, they canned food.
[01:05:01.525 --> 01:05:03.066]  During the fall, they'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:04.455 --> 01:05:07.378]  And that's what I'm talking about at MFootworkTour.com.
[01:05:07.378 --> 01:05:11.422]  With MFootwork Select, it's the full spectrum of my patron supply.
[01:05:13.004 --> 01:05:22.147]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:22.147 --> 01:05:27.489]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.

[01:05:44.498 --> 01:05:47.041]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.

[01:06:09.813 --> 01:06:12.644]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:45.365 --> 01:06:46.685]  All right.
[01:06:46.685 --> 01:06:47.786]  We've had him on before.
[01:06:47.786 --> 01:06:50.066]  Roosh V. There'll be only two segments.
[01:06:50.066 --> 01:06:52.327]  I'm going right back to your calls and news.
[01:06:52.327 --> 01:06:55.748]  I appreciate the folks holding a lot of great points from the callers already in the last hour.
[01:06:55.748 --> 01:07:13.213]  Roosh V. got banned off Amazon and he writes men's self-help books and is basically an anti-feminist because feminism is really about the left, big universities and government controlling women and breaking up the family.
[01:07:14.372 --> 01:07:19.273]  But even if he wrote bad stuff, I mean, doesn't he have a right to publish it, a right to sell it?
[01:07:19.273 --> 01:07:23.234]  And then Amazon becomes 90% of the book market, and then they say, well, he can't be there?
[01:07:23.234 --> 01:07:24.635]  Well, whose book will be banned next?
[01:07:24.635 --> 01:07:32.477]  Well, he announced a national speaking term, and so they're moving to take his bank accounts away, and so much more.
[01:07:32.477 --> 01:07:38.258]  So I thought we might get him on to talk about that, but it dovetails with this big, thick report
[01:07:39.884 --> 01:07:51.027]  Out of the New York Times today from Chris Hughes, one of the co-founders at the very beginning, in fact, the co-founder of Facebook.
[01:07:51.027 --> 01:08:06.230]  And he gets into the fact that Zuckerberg aggressively, since it began, will not let other competing softwares or systems be on the site.
[01:08:10.273 --> 01:08:12.455]  By users.
[01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:21.563]  And that he will not also let any company basically flourish out there without buying it or doing a hostile takeover.
[01:08:21.563 --> 01:08:26.848]  And that why hasn't the federal government and the antitrust office stopped this?
[01:08:26.848 --> 01:08:29.751]  When it is now a global monopoly and abusing it and censoring people.
[01:08:31.872 --> 01:08:35.156]  Now his answer, of course, is more of a leftist model breaking it up.
[01:08:35.156 --> 01:08:36.358]  It'll be just as bad.
[01:08:36.358 --> 01:08:40.964]  They're just jealous that Zuckerberg is in actual control of this company, and it's so powerful.
[01:08:40.964 --> 01:08:46.130]  So the globalists are muscling in, even though Zuckerberg's a globalist, to try to make him give into what they want.
[01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:50.055]  That's why Trump and the Republicans in action on all of this.
[01:08:51.577 --> 01:09:08.214]  In saying you can't regulate any company is allowing the Chinese government, the EU government, Hollywood and the left to come in with what they want from the company and the company's just under threat on adopting the anti-free speech surveillance model that Zuckerberg already wanted.
[01:09:09.161 --> 01:09:14.383]  So Zuckerberg's playing a please don't throw me in the briar patch type scenario.
[01:09:14.383 --> 01:09:30.889]  So coming up after we talk to our guests, take a bunch of calls, it'll be next hour, I'm going to get into it's time to break up Facebook and this big 24 page report that is partly true, part of it very, very deceptive, but it shows the political moment
[01:09:32.708 --> 01:09:36.392]  That we've gotten to as a nation and a world.
[01:09:36.392 --> 01:09:46.982]  And he also admits in here that Facebook reads all your private messages, sells them to thousands of groups, and doesn't let you send me the messages you want to send.
[01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.544]  So this is just them coming out and admitting it all.
[01:09:49.544 --> 01:09:53.508]  Oh, we banned the term Alex Jones.
[01:09:53.508 --> 01:09:54.689]  Unless you're being negative about him.
[01:09:55.652 --> 01:09:57.894]  So they're not just saying we're going to ban certain terms.
[01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:02.198]  They're telling you unless you say about those things what we want you to say.
[01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.560]  That is beyond Brave New World.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.381]  That is beyond the Soviet Union.
[01:10:06.381 --> 01:10:11.025]  That is beyond any fiction or any real world we've ever seen.
[01:10:11.025 --> 01:10:17.871]  But because we're familiar with the devil, Facebook, it's had its arm around our shoulder for a decade or longer.
[01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:23.236]  We accept, you know, Albert Spheer, the German interior minister and Hitler's architect,
[01:10:24.807 --> 01:10:39.653]  One of the only people not given a long prison sentence after World War II, and it's because he was a civilian, and he later said, I realized Hitler was evil, but he said, you don't realize it's the devil when he's got his arm around your shoulder.
[01:10:39.653 --> 01:10:40.453]  And that's it.
[01:10:40.453 --> 01:10:52.778]  When you habitualize something, whether it's a bottle of whiskey that's killing your liver, or whether it's a woman you're having sex with that's got syphilis, the point is you don't really get it because your brain doesn't interpret it as that.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:11:00.345]  But even Sean Parker of Facebook said, we designed it to manipulate dopamine, to make you depressed, and dominate your life.
[01:11:00.345 --> 01:11:01.707]  But enough of that.
[01:11:01.707 --> 01:11:11.254]  Roosh V... Roosh... Vali Zadeh has been promoting masculinity and helping men connect with women since 2001.
[01:11:11.254 --> 01:11:14.417]  Through his books, videos, and website.
[01:11:14.417 --> 01:11:21.263]  His dating advice has been labeled hate speech by the media and has been deplatformed by PayPal, Shopify, Disqus, among others.
[01:11:22.324 --> 01:11:30.789]  Amazon banned nine of his 19 books in the past, and now he's being banned from basic activity, banking, you name it.
[01:11:30.789 --> 01:11:34.691]  So, Rushfi, thank you for joining us, fellow thought criminal, and tell us the latest.
[01:11:36.109 --> 01:11:37.350]  It is great to be on Alex.
[01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.970]  I hope you don't mind.
[01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:40.891]  I may break down like Laura Loomer did the other day.
[01:11:40.891 --> 01:11:42.732]  I may start crying and yelling.
[01:11:42.732 --> 01:11:44.913]  So if I go over the edge, tell me.
[01:11:44.913 --> 01:11:45.373]  It's okay.
[01:11:45.373 --> 01:11:50.636]  But I was recently, I was banned on Tuesday from Instagram.
[01:11:50.636 --> 01:11:52.476]  I had a private account.
[01:11:52.476 --> 01:11:53.377]  They still banned me.
[01:11:54.557 --> 01:12:00.401]  I also was banned from Chase WePay to sell tour tickets.
[01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:05.825]  So the second I wanted to organize offline, the hammer is coming down.
[01:12:05.825 --> 01:12:18.353]  It's pretty clear that not only is it getting harder just to maintain a presence on the Internet, the second you want to do a lecture tour, they are going to come after you.
[01:12:18.353 --> 01:12:22.416]  So I don't start going on tour until late June, but I'm ready.
[01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:28.119]  For them to apply the heat in a similar way that they did to you.
[01:12:28.119 --> 01:12:34.063]  And for those that haven't read their history books, I mean, this is beyond Soviet Union, Nazi Germany.
[01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:39.346]  The amount of surveillance they've got and the fact that they're just doing it with all big tech working in coordination.
[01:12:39.346 --> 01:12:40.727]  This isn't just antitrust.
[01:12:40.727 --> 01:12:42.928]  This is classical mafia racketeering.
[01:12:44.537 --> 01:12:54.085]  Yeah, and they must have operatives or agents that are following everything that we do, because there hasn't even been any buzz for the tour.
[01:12:54.085 --> 01:12:56.367]  I'm going, I haven't even started it yet.
[01:12:56.367 --> 01:12:59.970]  But within 24 hours, they are already starting it.
[01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:02.212]  They're already starting to come after me.
[01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:05.135]  So they won't even allow you to move a single inch.
[01:13:06.075 --> 01:13:09.937]  What this tells me is they want complete domination over you.
[01:13:09.937 --> 01:13:15.159]  Complete domination to maintain the narrative that they believe is true, which is not.
[01:13:15.159 --> 01:13:18.060]  It's an inversion of everything that is true.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:23.982]  So I'm kind of at a loss on what to do because I know that heat is going to get hotter.
[01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:25.323]  So I look to you because you've
[01:13:25.863 --> 01:13:54.356]  You have sustained way more than me, and you are still here, and I'm glad that you are, but... Well, it's only... I'm gonna tell you, and I'm not just kissing their butt, I'm 100% in my audience's hands, and of course, God oversees that, but that is because we have a very large audience, they understand what's happening, they've gotten motivated, they promote the links by hand, but I'm unable, though, to really go out and do a speaking tour anywhere, because they'll bomb-threat the place, they'll try to attack it, they'll threaten, but as you said,
[01:13:54.756 --> 01:13:57.519]  Chase is banning you.
[01:13:57.519 --> 01:14:14.254]  They've now announced just this week that they're hiring what they call human rights boards, Southern Poverty Law Center cults, to now be inside MasterCard, and they put alarms on people's accounts to see, with named individuals in these accounts, who's spending money with them.
[01:14:14.254 --> 01:14:15.916]  So that's what the alarms are.
[01:14:15.916 --> 01:14:20.040]  They've already set them up, so see, via a company called G2 out of Boston,
[01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:26.463]  When the Southern Poverty Law Center lists you without a judge jury or whatever, they then list you as an actual terrorist.
[01:14:26.463 --> 01:14:29.044]  So you're put in there as an international terrorist in a database.
[01:14:29.044 --> 01:14:31.825]  So that's what they're doing to you, my friend.
[01:14:31.825 --> 01:14:36.748]  You know, I think at the end of the day, we have to be mentally prepared to lose everything.
[01:14:36.748 --> 01:14:38.528]  I mean, they are not going to stop.
[01:14:38.528 --> 01:14:44.031]  As long as you continue to conduct your show and I continue to fight them.
[01:14:44.031 --> 01:14:48.093]  I mean, all we have is the shirt that we are wearing and even that.
[01:14:48.613 --> 01:14:52.658]  Once things get really bad, I think they're going to try to put us into some kind of camp.
[01:14:52.658 --> 01:14:53.979]  I mean, where does this go?
[01:14:53.979 --> 01:14:59.545]  It's pretty clear they are aggressive now, because they feel that victory for them is in sight.
[01:14:59.545 --> 01:15:07.854]  So to make sure that victory for them is secured, I think that's why we're seeing such a quickening of the pace against people like us.
[01:15:08.959 --> 01:15:09.480]  That's right.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.081]  I mean, we can go to any university.
[01:15:11.081 --> 01:15:12.963]  We're not cherry picking.
[01:15:12.963 --> 01:15:15.846]  And the students look and act like zombies, almost all of them.
[01:15:15.846 --> 01:15:18.669]  And they all say, we don't want to just take your speech.
[01:15:18.669 --> 01:15:22.673]  We want to kill you.
[01:15:22.673 --> 01:15:23.994]  I mean, what?
[01:15:23.994 --> 01:15:29.200]  I mean, I'm scared, but I mean, I don't want to scare you, but I think we're not that far away from really
[01:15:30.524 --> 01:15:33.586]  Targeted physical violence.
[01:15:33.586 --> 01:15:41.170]  You know, I saw a video of you in Austin establishment where they were harassing you.
[01:15:41.170 --> 01:15:43.571]  I'm coming back to the USA.
[01:15:43.571 --> 01:15:44.632]  I'm ready for it.
[01:15:44.632 --> 01:15:45.312]  I'm ready for it.
[01:15:45.312 --> 01:15:47.833]  But what other option do we have but to keep going?
[01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:48.474]  Well, that's right.
[01:15:48.474 --> 01:15:50.895]  It's all coming to physical war and all their big tech stuff.
[01:15:50.895 --> 01:15:52.556]  Once they start, it's not going to save them.
[01:15:52.556 --> 01:15:54.097]  They better run to their bases in Kauai.
[01:15:54.097 --> 01:15:55.418]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:55.858]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.156 --> 01:16:01.158]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.

[01:16:57.597 --> 01:16:59.559]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:16:59.559 --> 01:17:04.863]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:17:04.863 --> 01:17:06.465]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.465 --> 01:17:14.812]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:18:24.208 --> 01:18:26.029]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.

[01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:54.586]  God bless you.
[01:18:58.132 --> 01:19:03.333]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[01:19:03.333 --> 01:19:11.915]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:19:11.915 --> 01:19:14.896]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:19:14.896 --> 01:19:16.616]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:19:16.616 --> 01:19:22.898]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[01:19:24.998 --> 01:19:30.320]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.282]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:19:33.282 --> 01:19:36.883]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:19:36.883 --> 01:19:41.185]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:19:41.185 --> 01:19:43.006]  I've got two in my home.
[01:19:43.006 --> 01:19:49.108]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:19:49.108 --> 01:19:49.949]  Don't live
[01:19:50.769 --> 01:19:54.834]  In a polluted major city in your home, have clean air.
[01:19:54.834 --> 01:20:01.160]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.783]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:15.345 --> 01:20:26.833]  By the year 2019, governments and major corporations were working together, whether the Communist China or the EU, actively against their populations.
[01:20:26.833 --> 01:20:32.136]  Millions of Americans were now having their bank accounts taken from them.
[01:20:32.136 --> 01:20:36.719]  NRA members were being fired from their jobs in Los Angeles.
[01:20:36.719 --> 01:20:40.402]  People wearing Make America Great Again hats were being physically attacked every day.
[01:20:42.409 --> 01:20:49.319]  Universities once bastions of free speech are now fortresses of censorship.
[01:20:49.319 --> 01:20:55.187]  Roosh V on Twitter for now at Roosh V. Roosh V dot com.
[01:21:01.181 --> 01:21:04.224]  Clearly, you're one of the main targets of this.
[01:21:04.224 --> 01:21:06.025]  I have not read your books.
[01:21:06.025 --> 01:21:08.387]  I have read some of your essays and things.
[01:21:08.387 --> 01:21:10.469]  You seem like a pretty well-spoken guy.
[01:21:10.469 --> 01:21:17.315]  It's true, on average, acting confident around women, and some of the things I've read you say is what women like.
[01:21:17.315 --> 01:21:25.662]  And, of course, most of these leftist women have their cuck husband that takes care of them, while they've got two or three alpha males, if they're good-looking, you know, gangbanging them.
[01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:29.125]  I mean, do you write stuff like that?
[01:21:29.125 --> 01:21:30.811]  Or, I mean, what is it that's got him so mad at you?
[01:21:32.446 --> 01:21:33.747]  No, no.
[01:21:33.747 --> 01:21:40.371]  I mean, I focus on helping men be as masculine and attractive as they can to women.
[01:21:40.371 --> 01:21:50.838]  OK, but I mean, but listen, I mean, the major porn sites that are like working with Google and everybody, Pornhub, admittedly have real torture porn and women being beaten up by 50 men.
[01:21:50.838 --> 01:21:56.062]  And, you know, I've read the reports and their intestines hanging out of their rear end.
[01:21:56.062 --> 01:21:57.743]  OK, and that's all liberal and loving.
[01:21:58.223 --> 01:22:06.208]  Okay, and they have satanic rituals all over the country where they, you know, smash men's testicles with hammers, and they make movies about it called Hell's Satan and worship it.
[01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:14.113]  So the left gets all their free speech to have women prolapsing out on tables on, you know, for kids to see or whatever, and that's everywhere.
[01:22:14.113 --> 01:22:15.414]  So did you do that?
[01:22:15.414 --> 01:22:16.335]  Why are you banned?
[01:22:16.335 --> 01:22:17.976]  Is it you don't have women prolapsing?
[01:22:17.976 --> 01:22:20.678]  What's wrong?
[01:22:20.678 --> 01:22:22.339]  I mean, what did you do that's so bad?
[01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:30.045]  I just try to tell men to be the best catch they can so attractive women choose them.
[01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:34.890]  So attractive women want to be with them, want to be in a relationship with them.
[01:22:34.890 --> 01:22:39.895]  Just try to teach men to harness their natural masculinity.
[01:22:39.895 --> 01:22:41.176]  So your crime is that you're...
[01:22:42.137 --> 01:22:56.131]  Your crime is, they admit, Netflix, the computer, smartphones are making men and women not have sex, it's ending the species, which it was designed to do, and so you're encouraging men to have the tools and confidence to go out and find a mate, so your crime is, is that you don't want to depopulate the earth.
[01:22:57.737 --> 01:23:02.479]  Right, and the major crime is that I teach men to abide by the natural order.
[01:23:02.479 --> 01:23:10.443]  I teach men that men should be masculine, women should be graceful and feminine, and by doing that... So you glorify the archetypes?
[01:23:10.443 --> 01:23:11.583]  I don't mean to interrupt you.
[01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:15.185]  I didn't know... I'm not trying to be gross here for radio and TV viewers.
[01:23:15.185 --> 01:23:20.107]  I was 16, I was in trouble, I was kicked out of school, I was sent to East Texas to work for a large animal vet.
[01:23:20.107 --> 01:23:25.610]  Second day on the job, we go out to take care of a cow that had a prolapse.
[01:23:25.610 --> 01:23:25.730]  Now...
[01:23:26.690 --> 01:23:34.597]  Then I go see a movie called Hell Satan, and they're praising it as something that's good for everybody to see, and they've got basically stuff like that going on.
[01:23:34.597 --> 01:23:47.327]  So what I'm saying is, is that the left is pushing the most vicious, savage, horrible things that hurt women as empowering women, and I was expecting that you were like, you know, 50 Shades of Grey, but you're not.
[01:23:47.327 --> 01:23:50.890]  50 Shades of Grey, telling girls to get tied up by men they don't know, that's okay.
[01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:53.853]  But you're just trying to bring men and women together, so that's why you're banned.
[01:23:55.017 --> 01:24:01.341]  Yeah, because what they're doing right now, they're pushing this anally-centered lifestyle, and I don't do that.
[01:24:01.341 --> 01:24:07.865]  I say a man should be with a woman in a normal way, and that they don't agree with, and they're attacking me.
[01:24:07.865 --> 01:24:15.750]  I mean, I'm just tired of all this obsession over the butt, all the gay obsession, and that's what they're trying to push.
[01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:19.993]  But a man who is straight is saying, hey, guys, here's how to meet a woman.
[01:24:20.733 --> 01:24:23.436]  And they lose, and they go bonkers!
[01:24:23.436 --> 01:24:28.181]  So you criticized anal sex?
[01:24:28.181 --> 01:24:39.372]  I believe that homosexual activity shouldn't be a virtue that is elevated above heterosexuals.
[01:24:39.372 --> 01:24:40.854]  So now we know you're a real crime.
[01:24:40.854 --> 01:24:42.135]  Okay, now I understand.
[01:24:42.135 --> 01:24:43.657]  Well, you know, whatever happened to the First Amendment?
[01:24:45.484 --> 01:24:54.444]  You know that exists in word only, but if there is not a government, if there is not a cultural elite that wants to back it, that wants to
[01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:58.632]  enable it, then it's dead.
[01:24:58.632 --> 01:24:59.192]  It's dead.
[01:24:59.192 --> 01:25:03.255]  And as you know, as I know, free speech doesn't exist.
[01:25:03.255 --> 01:25:03.875]  It doesn't.
[01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:04.736]  It's a joke.
[01:25:04.736 --> 01:25:06.457]  It's a sham.
[01:25:06.457 --> 01:25:09.679]  And all the people who said, oh, free speech is fine.
[01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:11.080]  You can say whatever you want.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:18.604]  They've never exerted their free speech because they're saying exactly what they were trained and programmed to say.
[01:25:18.604 --> 01:25:22.567]  So but if you really speak the truth, you're going to feel it and you're going to feel it quickly.
[01:25:23.445 --> 01:25:24.706]  No, I agree.
[01:25:24.706 --> 01:25:28.187]  I'm just saying, I see the left teaching kids the most vile stuff.
[01:25:28.187 --> 01:25:34.851]  They've got 9 and 10 and 11 year old kids up dancing at gay bars and talking about ketamine.
[01:25:34.851 --> 01:25:39.593]  They've got movies where you go see it where men are having their testicles, you know, lanced and crushed.
[01:25:39.593 --> 01:25:43.055]  I don't want to talk about stuff like that, but that's mainline movie theaters now.
[01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:46.416]  But you can't praise heterosexuality.
[01:25:46.416 --> 01:25:48.557]  You are being banned from having a bank account.
[01:25:48.557 --> 01:25:49.638]  This is just criminal.
[01:25:51.107 --> 01:25:54.829]  You know, and I don't want to say, Alex, that I'm the most moral man.
[01:25:54.829 --> 01:25:58.011]  I have had a lot of fun with girls and travel.
[01:25:58.011 --> 01:26:06.137]  But the way the establishment attacks me, they're pushing me up as, yeah, I guess I am some kind of moral guy.
[01:26:06.137 --> 01:26:16.023]  If these evil people, these people who are trying to sexualize young kids by sending drag queens to groom them,
[01:26:16.773 --> 01:26:22.075]  I mean, maybe I am some kind of moral person, even though I never intended that.
[01:26:22.075 --> 01:26:37.962]  But the times are getting so evil that if you just want to lead a normal life, if you're a man who just wants to lay in bed with a woman who you love and have a family without giving them toxins and vaccines, well, they are going to get you.
[01:26:37.962 --> 01:26:38.703]  They're going to get you.
[01:26:39.543 --> 01:26:48.809]  The only thing we can do is what we're doing now is to raise the consciousness of people to where enough people just say, no, this is enough.
[01:27:10.523 --> 01:27:12.084]  I've gone through all this stuff.
[01:27:12.084 --> 01:27:13.124]  More people are going through it.
[01:27:13.124 --> 01:27:15.985]  Now they want to go after the NRA and their members.
[01:27:15.985 --> 01:27:17.685]  California's trying to pass laws.
[01:27:17.685 --> 01:27:25.067]  LA has, as I'm sure you know, to out NRA members in the newspaper who work for government or have government contracts.
[01:27:25.067 --> 01:27:32.889]  So now they're saying you won't get a government contract for laying cement or cleaning windows or doing the carpet job if you're in the NRA.
[01:27:32.889 --> 01:27:37.550]  We're being terrorized as a political class and we need Congress and others to act.
[01:27:39.298 --> 01:27:42.600]  You know, I studied the Russian Revolution of 1917.
[01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:50.786]  I highly recommend people read the Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
[01:27:50.786 --> 01:27:52.347]  And that's what they're doing here.
[01:27:52.347 --> 01:27:54.368]  They are doing the same.
[01:27:54.368 --> 01:27:58.891]  The Soviets are doing what they had to endure in Russia.
[01:27:58.891 --> 01:28:00.792]  They're doing it to us now.
[01:28:00.792 --> 01:28:03.394]  The same kind of people are doing this.
[01:28:03.394 --> 01:28:07.877]  So I think mentally and spiritually we have to get ready
[01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:18.856]  For a big change coming up and I think it's going to happen soon because as we talked about, they're trying to speed up the pace so they can dominate everyone and everything.
[01:28:19.857 --> 01:28:23.360]  They want total control, and they won't stop until they get it.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:23.861]  That's right.
[01:28:23.861 --> 01:28:27.904]  Tyranny has come to America, and Trump has to do more than tweet about it.
[01:28:27.904 --> 01:28:34.210]  He will lose the 2020 election, I have no doubt, via fraud, if he doesn't take antitrust action, racketeering action.
[01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:35.651]  There's so many ways to do it.
[01:28:35.651 --> 01:28:40.735]  All right, well, Roosh V, we'll follow what you're doing as it unfolds, and we're in this together.
[01:28:40.735 --> 01:28:41.896]  Roosh V, thank you so much.
[01:28:41.896 --> 01:28:43.257]  Look forward to speaking to you again.
[01:28:43.257 --> 01:28:44.318]  Roosh V on Twitter.
[01:28:44.318 --> 01:28:44.598]  Thank you.
[01:28:46.045 --> 01:28:46.507]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:57.438 --> 01:28:58.658]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.658 --> 01:29:02.579]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.579 --> 01:29:04.100]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.061]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.061 --> 01:29:12.622]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.622 --> 01:29:13.822]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.822 --> 01:29:16.763]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.763 --> 01:29:18.984]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:18.984 --> 01:29:23.425]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.425 --> 01:29:25.766]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.347 --> 01:29:28.628]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:28.628 --> 01:29:29.909]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:29.909 --> 01:29:33.652]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:33.652 --> 01:29:34.732]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:34.732 --> 01:29:36.554]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:36.554 --> 01:29:38.275]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[01:29:38.275 --> 01:29:46.061]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:46.061 --> 01:29:47.081]  Bold statement?

[01:29:58.069 --> 01:29:59.111]  You like Secret 12?
[01:29:59.111 --> 01:30:01.694]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[01:30:01.694 --> 01:30:03.277]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[01:30:03.277 --> 01:30:04.398]  Most expensive.
[01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:05.440]  Vitamin B12.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.401]  Methylcobalamin.
[01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:08.124]  And you put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[01:30:08.124 --> 01:30:09.646]  And the longer you can do it, the better.
[01:30:09.646 --> 01:30:13.231]  B12, just like clean iodine, is essential.
[01:30:13.231 --> 01:30:13.932]  Just like oxygen.
[01:30:13.932 --> 01:30:14.533]  Just like water.
[01:30:14.693 --> 01:30:18.935]  The point is, it's amazing, you need it, it's awesome, and it's the absolute go-to.
[01:30:18.935 --> 01:30:20.295]  By the way, it tastes super sweet.

[01:30:34.860 --> 01:30:38.541]  And you take it with something like a Turbo Force or a Rain Force, it just makes it all better.
[01:30:38.541 --> 01:30:41.482]  But just experience this that's right out of Mother Nature, folks.
[01:30:41.482 --> 01:30:42.123]  That's pure B12.
[01:30:42.123 --> 01:30:42.963]  So amazing.

[01:30:49.689 --> 01:30:50.590]  Ultra 12.
[01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:52.091]  Advance vitamin B12.

[01:33:00.703 --> 01:33:03.386]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.195 --> 01:33:19.739]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:33:19.739 --> 01:33:39.870]  When you wake up in the morning and the light has hurt your head The first thing you do when you get up out of bed Is hit that street surrounding and try to meet the masses And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses Oh yeah!
[01:33:39.870 --> 01:33:41.510]  Oh yeah!
[01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:42.271]  We are back live
[01:33:43.712 --> 01:33:46.254]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:46.254 --> 01:33:48.375]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.375 --> 01:33:57.642]  We're going to be going to your phone calls here in just a second.
[01:33:57.642 --> 01:34:11.592]  And then I'm going to, after we take a bunch of calls as quickly as possible, get into this extremely lengthy but extremely revealing article, 24 pages, out of the New York Times, where the co-founder of Facebook,
[01:34:13.163 --> 01:34:15.724]  Admits everything we've been saying about Facebook.
[01:34:15.724 --> 01:34:19.744]  But of course, his solution is not good.
[01:34:19.744 --> 01:34:26.426]  You know, I could do a whole special three hours on this and read each paragraph and then analyze what's really going on.
[01:34:26.426 --> 01:34:28.626]  Because this just confirms so much what we already knew.
[01:34:28.626 --> 01:34:30.847]  But this is amazing.
[01:34:30.847 --> 01:34:32.547]  Amazing.
[01:34:32.547 --> 01:34:40.469]  And this feller, again, was just still on Facebook just a few years ago and is the co-founder with Zuckerberg.
[01:34:42.324 --> 01:34:47.128]  And in a nice way, he tells you old Zucky thinks he's God.
[01:34:47.128 --> 01:34:51.692]  And he's got the establishment now jealous of him.
[01:34:51.692 --> 01:34:56.315]  They're getting ready to carve him up like a Christmas ham and divide him up.
[01:34:56.315 --> 01:34:58.657]  Here's the problem.
[01:34:58.657 --> 01:35:02.360]  They're going to do even worse stuff with it once they've done that.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:11.548]  So we need to really have Trump and the American people decide how this surgery is going to go on.
[01:35:12.814 --> 01:35:14.615]  Surgery with no anesthesia, of course.
[01:35:14.615 --> 01:35:19.459]  I'm being sarcastic, having a little fun there.
[01:35:19.459 --> 01:35:29.666]  But that's all coming up in the next hour after I get to a lot of your phone calls and a lot more.
[01:35:29.666 --> 01:35:38.633]  I'm just going to leave it at this because I want to go to your calls.
[01:35:38.633 --> 01:35:39.814]  Our listeners have really come through.
[01:35:41.601 --> 01:35:42.441]  In a lot of big ways.
[01:35:42.441 --> 01:35:46.682]  And it's touched my heart.
[01:35:46.682 --> 01:35:54.164]  And I don't really feel like I have ways to thank you enough for standing with us and understanding just how serious the times are.
[01:35:54.164 --> 01:35:57.405]  And I salute you because you heard that first caller.
[01:35:57.405 --> 01:36:01.206]  And I appreciate you all holding because I had him on for two segments.
[01:36:01.206 --> 01:36:08.668]  We talked about his son dying until he was resuscitated after his first vaccines.
[01:36:13.277 --> 01:36:20.300]  Now, I have interviewed hundreds of people this has happened to.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:25.902]  I have interviewed hundreds of doctors.
[01:36:25.902 --> 01:36:31.144]  In fact, you could say probably 10 years ago, for a couple years, my mission was vaccines.
[01:36:31.144 --> 01:36:36.406]  Because we know the facts, we've burrowed into it.
[01:36:36.406 --> 01:36:42.788]  But just a call like we had to hear that, and how serious all this is,
[01:36:44.369 --> 01:36:51.233]  Let's all of us understand just how high the stakes are.
[01:36:51.233 --> 01:36:58.116]  And the corporate media gets up there and they lie and they say there's never been one side effect.
[01:36:58.116 --> 01:36:59.717]  Corporate media gets up there and says,
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:03.701]  Nobody's ever been hurt.
[01:37:03.701 --> 01:37:06.582]  And the vaccines say they can kill you on the insert.
[01:37:06.582 --> 01:37:15.747]  And they have a giant secret court that's paid out billions a year to the hundreds of thousands of admitted damaged people.
[01:37:15.747 --> 01:37:18.408]  And it's in the millions.
[01:37:18.408 --> 01:37:26.512]  And then almost every member of my family has gotten super sick or almost died after they took flu shots or tetanus shots.
[01:37:26.512 --> 01:37:28.033]  And my dad is a retired physician.
[01:37:29.517 --> 01:37:38.099]  And he had all these patients, some of which he'd done 10, 20 years to come in.
[01:37:38.099 --> 01:37:44.440]  Cause my dad would halfway roll his eyes at me 20 years ago and say, well, there's costs and benefits, but I know there's, I know there's side effects.
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:48.320]  Just, you know, toughen up.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.802]  Well, he saw so many patients coming over the years that would get the flu and die one week after the flu shot.
[01:37:54.802 --> 01:37:55.642]  Where's Bertha?
[01:37:55.642 --> 01:37:56.182]  She died.
[01:37:58.012 --> 01:38:01.954]  I remember it was about six years ago, he said, son, it's incredible.
[01:38:01.954 --> 01:38:05.976]  He goes, a bunch of my patients have gone and gotten shingles vaccines.
[01:38:05.976 --> 01:38:10.499]  That's basically herpes on your body, not on your genitals.
[01:38:10.499 --> 01:38:12.320]  It's a virus.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:21.385]  And he said, I've got more than 50 patients have come in the last few months who all went this big push for shingle shots through AARP.
[01:38:21.385 --> 01:38:26.868]  They all went and got shots and man, they've all got shingles and some are dying.
[01:38:28.971 --> 01:38:33.573]  And he said, so for the first time, I'm actively telling my patients, don't take vaccines.
[01:38:33.573 --> 01:38:38.896]  And you've just got to see it for yourself.
[01:38:38.896 --> 01:38:41.057]  My dad was pro-fluoride.
[01:38:41.057 --> 01:38:43.258]  He goes, son, it's calcium fluoride.
[01:38:43.258 --> 01:38:44.539]  You need it or you die.
[01:38:44.539 --> 01:38:45.319]  It's good for your teeth.
[01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:47.640]  I've seen it, which is totally true.
[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:58.246]  But as soon as he finally read articles from toxicologists about how they take toxic waste and call it fluoride, and it's electrified fluoride, hydrofluoric acid, he was like, what?
[01:38:59.073 --> 01:39:01.754]  They put grenadier and he went and looked it up and then he freaked out.
[01:39:01.754 --> 01:39:03.015]  He goes, this is insane.
[01:39:03.015 --> 01:39:04.836]  They're putting toxic waste in the water.
[01:39:04.836 --> 01:39:09.158]  And I'm like, yeah, dad, just because you're a nice guy doesn't mean the people running things are.
[01:39:09.158 --> 01:39:12.340]  And he's like, I know, I just can't believe they get away with that.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:16.002]  And my dad already knew this stuff before I was born.
[01:39:16.002 --> 01:39:18.723]  But people want to comply.
[01:39:18.723 --> 01:39:19.864]  They want to go along.
[01:39:19.864 --> 01:39:21.825]  I get it.
[01:39:21.825 --> 01:39:24.026]  But you can't do it with something that's killing you.
[01:39:25.987 --> 01:39:26.367]  Hard enough.
[01:39:26.367 --> 01:39:28.068]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:39:28.068 --> 01:39:31.389]  I was going to plug there, but I just went off talking about the caller.
[01:39:31.389 --> 01:39:33.849]  It's the last few days of X2.
[01:39:33.849 --> 01:39:36.430]  You get a free bottle of X3.
[01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:37.350]  Incredible deal.
[01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:39.591]  25% off X2, the good halogen.
[01:39:39.591 --> 01:39:41.552]  Get that free bottle of X3.
[01:39:41.552 --> 01:39:42.692]  50% off Ultra 12.
[01:39:42.692 --> 01:39:43.312]  Double strong.

[01:39:46.553 --> 01:39:47.773]  The same high quality.
[01:39:47.773 --> 01:39:48.534]  Methylcobalamin.
[01:39:48.534 --> 01:39:48.894]  Amazing.

[01:39:54.572 --> 01:39:56.653]  Okay, let's go to your phone calls right now.
[01:39:56.653 --> 01:39:58.213]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:39:58.213 --> 01:40:04.055]  Mitch in Canada, California and Indiana, J.D.
[01:40:04.055 --> 01:40:06.816]  in Texas.
[01:40:06.816 --> 01:40:07.636]  Let's go to J.D.
[01:40:07.636 --> 01:40:08.156]  in Texas.
[01:40:08.156 --> 01:40:09.016]  J.D., thanks for holding.
[01:40:09.016 --> 01:40:10.457]  I appreciate you.
[01:40:10.457 --> 01:40:11.937]  Go ahead.
[01:40:11.937 --> 01:40:13.197]  Good afternoon, sir.
[01:40:13.197 --> 01:40:13.598]  Welcome, sir.
[01:40:13.598 --> 01:40:16.258]  Hey, I wanted to talk to you real quick, man.
[01:40:16.258 --> 01:40:18.679]  You know, I've been on the X2 program.
[01:40:19.631 --> 01:40:24.632]  I take that and I give X3 to my son, you know, once every other day or so.
[01:40:24.632 --> 01:40:26.093]  Good product.
[01:40:26.093 --> 01:40:28.913]  Helps with the mental clarity.
[01:40:28.913 --> 01:40:33.215]  My main call was about these Libtards.
[01:40:33.215 --> 01:40:35.715]  What triggers them as far?
[01:40:35.715 --> 01:40:37.136]  What puts them in that mindset?
[01:40:37.136 --> 01:40:38.656]  Is it something like in the water?
[01:40:39.358 --> 01:40:45.001]  Is it the TV shows that they're watching that turns their brain to a certain level?
[01:40:45.001 --> 01:40:46.541]  Yes.
[01:40:46.541 --> 01:40:49.283]  On average at the colleges, it's arrested development.
[01:40:49.283 --> 01:40:50.623]  They're taught that they're the elite.
[01:40:50.623 --> 01:40:53.105]  They're taught there's all these horrible demons everywhere.
[01:40:53.105 --> 01:41:06.171]  And so when they finally see someone that doesn't agree with them, all of their tribal energies and warfare energies that are still pathetic and badly directed are now for the first time in their life, they're going to have that schoolyard fight they didn't have at 13.
[01:41:06.171 --> 01:41:07.712]  They're going to have it at 20.
[01:41:09.073 --> 01:41:13.016]  And they're also so entitled, they believe they can hit you.
[01:41:13.016 --> 01:41:16.718]  I mean, there's hundreds of videos where they'll hit you, you hit them back, they call the cops.
[01:41:16.718 --> 01:41:21.741]  And the cops show up and they go, well, I hit this Nazi, and then he hit me back, and the cops arrest them.
[01:41:21.741 --> 01:41:24.643]  It's like the woman that grabbed Ellen by the genitals and said, yeah, I'm gonna rape you.
[01:41:24.643 --> 01:41:26.084]  The cops arrested her.
[01:41:26.084 --> 01:41:29.086]  She's like, but I'm a royal person, you can't arrest me.
[01:41:29.086 --> 01:41:32.788]  So it's entitlement, it's laziness, it's stupidness.
[01:41:32.788 --> 01:41:33.689]  I mean, what do you think it is?
[01:41:34.918 --> 01:41:44.305]  I don't know, sir, because I've even seen old Democrats in their 70s, and you mentioned Trump, and they're just like, oh, I hate that guy, but they can't tell you why.
[01:41:44.305 --> 01:41:46.426]  It's a feeling, and I'm like, you make no sense.
[01:41:46.426 --> 01:41:47.487]  Because these are TV heads.
[01:41:47.487 --> 01:41:54.051]  These people watch TV 8, 9, 10 hours a day, and they just sit there on their ass, and they just, they're jellyfish.
[01:41:54.051 --> 01:41:58.615]  I mean, I have to say it, they're really, really scary people, and they've also been told we're all Russian agents.
[01:41:59.542 --> 01:42:02.264]  And so, these are the followers.
[01:42:02.264 --> 01:42:09.968]  And so what's happened is in this modern world, we've all been taught to acquiesce to the big corporations and the followers they have, instead of saying no.
[01:42:09.968 --> 01:42:15.331]  And so their political correctness, we've acquiesced over and over again until now, they feel very emboldened.
[01:42:15.331 --> 01:42:16.872]  They feel like it's their time to take over now.
[01:42:16.872 --> 01:42:18.893]  What do you think?
[01:42:18.893 --> 01:42:21.295]  Yeah, okay, that's true.
[01:42:21.295 --> 01:42:28.799]  The other thing I wanted to talk to you real quick is that Trump, on his book, the way that he's getting over the establishment,
[01:42:29.255 --> 01:42:42.477]  They're so arrogant that they can't even read his books and understand his mindset because he likes confusion and then he walks around in a circle and he starts to pick one by one off.
[01:42:42.477 --> 01:42:44.758]  And they don't even understand how he's doing it.
[01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:50.699]  But in his books, if you read his books, you can get a mindset of how this man thinks.
[01:42:50.699 --> 01:42:51.479]  No, I totally agree.
[01:42:51.479 --> 01:42:56.560]  I read a couple of Trump's books once he became president and you can see his tactics in motion.

[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:11.143]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:44:11.143 --> 01:44:14.104]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:44:14.104 --> 01:44:15.864]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:44:15.864 --> 01:44:22.126]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[01:44:29.550 --> 01:44:32.512]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[01:44:32.512 --> 01:44:36.134]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[01:44:36.134 --> 01:44:40.416]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[01:44:40.416 --> 01:44:42.237]  I've got two in my home.
[01:44:42.237 --> 01:44:48.340]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:49.181]  Don't live
[01:44:50.001 --> 01:44:54.062]  In a polluted major city, in your home, have clean air.
[01:44:54.062 --> 01:44:58.403]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:44:58.403 --> 01:45:07.706]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[01:45:07.706 --> 01:45:10.566]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[01:45:10.566 --> 01:45:16.608]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[01:45:17.288 --> 01:45:23.552]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:45:23.552 --> 01:45:29.817]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[01:45:29.817 --> 01:45:36.781]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:45:37.922 --> 01:45:50.946]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:45:50.946 --> 01:45:55.187]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:45:55.187 --> 01:45:57.888]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:45:59.403 --> 01:46:00.823]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:46:00.823 --> 01:46:02.724]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:46:02.724 --> 01:46:03.324]  It is.
[01:46:03.324 --> 01:46:08.205]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:46:08.205 --> 01:46:09.545]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:46:09.545 --> 01:46:11.366]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:46:11.366 --> 01:46:13.866]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:46:13.866 --> 01:46:16.947]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:46:16.947 --> 01:46:20.428]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[01:46:20.428 --> 01:46:22.688]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's,
[01:46:22.688 --> 01:46:24.189]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:46:49.659 --> 01:46:55.546]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:46:55.546 --> 01:47:01.653]  I just can't do it!
[01:47:01.653 --> 01:47:04.236]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:45.581 --> 01:47:47.463]  I'm going right back to your phone calls right now.
[01:47:47.463 --> 01:47:51.027]  I just want to make this statement.
[01:47:51.027 --> 01:47:51.688]  Thank you again.
[01:47:51.688 --> 01:47:52.789]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:08.552]  It's knowing history and knowing the admission of big tech and the admission of these governments and the fact that they're usurping our prosperity, our freedom, that they're anti-human, they want a giant dumbed-down mass of people.
[01:48:08.552 --> 01:48:18.421]  I mean, it's really mind-blowing to realize that we're at this point and there's not a greater or more serious resistance to all this.
[01:48:19.488 --> 01:48:25.490]  And that's why they want this show off the air, because we're a focal point for you, the resistance to all this corruption.
[01:48:25.490 --> 01:48:29.611]  So right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:48:29.611 --> 01:48:34.872]  Let's go ahead and go to Jason in Tennessee.
[01:48:34.872 --> 01:48:35.752]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:48:35.752 --> 01:48:36.152]  Go ahead.
[01:48:36.152 --> 01:48:39.113]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:39.113 --> 01:48:41.413]  Go ahead.
[01:48:41.413 --> 01:48:42.754]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:42.754 --> 01:48:46.975]  Are you familiar with Neil Stroud?
[01:48:46.975 --> 01:48:47.155]  Yes.
[01:48:48.954 --> 01:48:52.296]  So, Neil Strauss isn't banned then, but Roosh V is.
[01:48:52.296 --> 01:48:53.336]  Why do you think that is?
[01:48:53.336 --> 01:48:59.119]  Neil Strauss, author of The Game, the biggest pick-up artist out there.
[01:48:59.119 --> 01:49:01.861]  Roosh V is banned because he's a rape advocate.
[01:49:01.861 --> 01:49:05.002]  You're literally having a rape advocate on air.
[01:49:05.002 --> 01:49:06.603]  And there's no reason for it.
[01:49:06.603 --> 01:49:12.606]  This guy used to pull up at seminars driving a rape van, telling men he could rape women.
[01:49:12.606 --> 01:49:13.607]  I mean, this is an
[01:49:15.438 --> 01:49:18.820]  Well, your phone's breaking up, but I heard what you said.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:21.641]  We didn't censor your call, and I didn't know that.
[01:49:21.641 --> 01:49:23.362]  I don't know if that's true, but I'll look into it.
[01:49:23.362 --> 01:49:26.063]  Because when I'm reading these news articles, I didn't see that.
[01:49:26.063 --> 01:49:28.204]  I just see articles about people being banned.
[01:49:28.204 --> 01:49:32.467]  And of course, people say a lot of things about me that aren't true as well.
[01:49:32.467 --> 01:49:35.408]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:49:35.408 --> 01:49:36.909]  You know, I actually know Neil Strauss.
[01:49:36.909 --> 01:49:39.130]  When we first said his name, I was like, who's Neil Strauss?
[01:49:39.130 --> 01:49:40.251]  I've met him before.
[01:49:40.251 --> 01:49:42.172]  He's been to town to actually come interview me.
[01:49:45.162 --> 01:49:57.572]  When he wanted to write a book about me, they got the publisher and everything set up and the CNN harassed a bunch of people and they fired the agent that was making the deal, who was a big liberal.
[01:49:57.572 --> 01:50:02.656]  So it's just amazing the amount of oppression that's going on.
[01:50:02.656 --> 01:50:07.620]  But if I do have Roush V. back on, I'll look that up and I'll bring that up to him.
[01:50:07.620 --> 01:50:09.562]  So I appreciate your call.
[01:50:09.562 --> 01:50:11.763]  All right, who's up next here?
[01:50:11.763 --> 01:50:14.385]  I saw you disagreed with Roush V., so I got you on right away.
[01:50:15.421 --> 01:50:18.403]  Then it just turned into that... You're just so angry at me.
[01:50:18.403 --> 01:50:20.024]  I mean, you were able to call in and tell us what you said.
[01:50:20.024 --> 01:50:22.606]  I don't know what you're talking about, but I'll look into it.
[01:50:22.606 --> 01:50:28.851]  Let's go ahead and talk to... California and Indiana.
[01:50:28.851 --> 01:50:31.353]  California, welcome.
[01:50:31.353 --> 01:50:32.214]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:50:32.214 --> 01:50:35.236]  Shout out to all my Infowarriors in Indiana.
[01:50:35.236 --> 01:50:36.377]  I'll plug for you, man.
[01:50:36.377 --> 01:50:41.240]  I haven't eaten a land animal in almost 20 years, and your Secret 12 is awesome.
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.102]  I wanted to make a point about Facebook, but...
[01:50:43.709 --> 01:51:09.790]  Real quick, as far as social credit scores go, I haven't ever had a Facebook account or any social media account, but someone said they had Googled my name recently, and there's a company called My Life, so if you Google your name, Alex Emmerich Jones, and put My Life after it, there's a company called My Life, and you have a social reputation score on that site, and it also makes it out like you could be a sexual predator, you could have liens against your properties, and things like that.
[01:51:11.195 --> 01:51:14.600]  You know, they disaggregate and try to get any public information they can.
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:15.781]  Oh yeah, that's what G2 does.
[01:51:19.338 --> 01:51:22.739]  It's his banking system, and I had perfect banking score.
[01:51:22.739 --> 01:51:28.780]  And then what they do is, once the Southern Barbara Law Center calls you a hate figure, that puts you in the dangerous category.
[01:51:28.780 --> 01:51:36.201]  And then the category is, well I kept showing it the other day, but it was like bank robbers, murderers, child kidnappers, rapists.
[01:51:36.201 --> 01:51:37.901]  And so I guess he was saying that other guys are rapists.
[01:51:37.901 --> 01:51:39.382]  Maybe I'm a rapist now too.
[01:51:39.382 --> 01:51:40.982]  I'm a rapist, you're a rapist.
[01:51:40.982 --> 01:51:45.783]  And so tell me about this particular group and their so-called social score for me.
[01:51:45.783 --> 01:51:46.543]  Tell me about the name of it again.
[01:51:47.498 --> 01:51:54.843]  It's called My Life, so just Google your name, Alex Emmerich Jones, and put in My Life after it, and a site will come up that's going to have your picture on it.
[01:51:54.843 --> 01:52:11.493]  You have a social reputation score of, I think it was 3.4 or something like that, and then anybody can just find out any information about you, you know, whereas you try to stay private, you know, someone can Google your name, tell your age, where you live, the phone numbers and email addresses you've had.
[01:52:11.493 --> 01:52:14.695]  So I was pretty, you know, pissed off about that, but
[01:52:15.504 --> 01:52:18.925]  As far as Facebook goes, you know, we need to really break up big tech.
[01:52:18.925 --> 01:52:24.426]  I look at social media as like, you know, the more you use a calculator, the more you can't do simple math.
[01:52:24.426 --> 01:52:32.749]  The more you use social media, put your memories on some digital storage, the more you don't actually, your brain doesn't need to work anymore.
[01:52:32.749 --> 01:52:34.789]  You don't even need to remember things.
[01:52:34.789 --> 01:52:37.030]  So I think that's, you know, the cause, the downfall.
[01:52:37.665 --> 01:52:37.985]  I don't
[01:52:58.208 --> 01:53:03.336]  You know, we've got to reach into the Matrix and reach all the people that are on there, because that's the platform.
[01:53:03.336 --> 01:53:09.525]  But, I mean, ultimately we need to boycott those things and speak to people in real life when we can.
[01:53:09.525 --> 01:53:11.247]  But it is a great tool that we have to use.
[01:53:11.247 --> 01:53:13.731]  It's just a double-edged sword, you know.
[01:53:15.353 --> 01:53:16.214]  No, it certainly is.
[01:53:16.214 --> 01:53:17.996]  And you didn't just say all those things.
[01:53:17.996 --> 01:53:18.857]  It's true.
[01:53:18.857 --> 01:53:20.879]  Social media is killing us.
[01:53:20.879 --> 01:53:21.920]  The internet is killing us.
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.606]  Smartphones are mentally killing us, but also radiating us and killing us.
[01:53:26.606 --> 01:53:28.107]  5G, on record, gives you cancer.
[01:53:28.107 --> 01:53:29.089]  That's mainline news.
[01:53:31.087 --> 01:53:32.208]  They're just doing it to us.
[01:53:32.208 --> 01:53:32.848]  They're pushing.
[01:53:32.848 --> 01:53:42.156]  They knew aspartame caused strokes and heart attacks and brain damage, and now major studies are out again confirming it all, and they legalized it in 1980.
[01:53:42.156 --> 01:53:51.903]  And so we're just having all this garbage pushed on us by design, on purpose, and it's all to dumb us down and depopulate us so we can be more easily ruled.
[01:53:51.903 --> 01:53:54.906]  And after I take some more calls, I'm going to air this Millie Weaver piece.
[01:53:55.836 --> 01:54:00.607]  And I have another piece of our other reporter, Caitlin Bennett, being attacked.
[01:54:00.607 --> 01:54:03.814]  And again, these people are hateful.
[01:54:04.656 --> 01:54:05.997]  They're stupid.
[01:54:05.997 --> 01:54:07.377]  They can barely talk.
[01:54:07.377 --> 01:54:15.600]  They don't know who they are, but they know they hate people they disagree with, and that they're part of the power structure now, and that you're going to be shut up.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.762]  So there's these weak people that now think they've been given entree into power.
[01:54:19.762 --> 01:54:21.123]  They are the useful idiots.
[01:54:21.123 --> 01:54:26.765]  They are the brown shirt zombies leading the system into its full fruition.
[01:54:26.765 --> 01:54:29.846]  And can you imagine what the world will be like when they're finally done?
[01:54:29.846 --> 01:54:32.927]  It is going to be not a very nice place.
[01:54:32.927 --> 01:54:33.988]  The more leftist you are,
[01:54:35.202 --> 01:54:43.989]  The more interfaced with these systems you are, the more brain damaged you are, the stupider you are, the more alone you are, the more you get Alzheimer's, neurological diseases.
[01:54:43.989 --> 01:54:45.551]  It is insane.
[01:54:45.551 --> 01:54:47.632]  Okay, let's go to whoever's holding the longest now.
[01:54:47.632 --> 01:54:52.917]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Patrick in Colorado.
[01:54:52.917 --> 01:54:53.898]  Thank you for holding your own here.
[01:54:54.696 --> 01:54:55.656]  Sure.
[01:54:55.656 --> 01:54:56.756]  God bless you and your crew.
[01:54:56.756 --> 01:54:58.757]  Thanks, sir.
[01:54:58.757 --> 01:55:00.937]  Just three quick points.
[01:55:00.937 --> 01:55:06.058]  Number one, and all the stuff that's going on, you check the news cycles and the websites, whatever.
[01:55:06.058 --> 01:55:08.599]  Where is Ruth Bader Ginsburg?
[01:55:08.599 --> 01:55:09.899]  Nary a word from what's going on.
[01:55:09.899 --> 01:55:12.400]  It's like, oh, there's a Ruth Bader Ginsburg site.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.080]  It's a fake picture from three years ago.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:16.040]  You know, what's going on?
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.261]  That's the way a lot of this criminality has been pushed is through the courts.
[01:55:20.261 --> 01:55:23.162]  There's nary a word where she is or what's going on.
[01:55:24.062 --> 01:55:27.084]  Yeah, maybe we'll just have a hologram of her.
[01:55:27.084 --> 01:55:27.925]  Exactly.
[01:55:27.925 --> 01:55:29.106]  Well, who knows?
[01:55:29.106 --> 01:55:35.311]  All the crazy technologies that they don't release that are being kept back so they can implement them on us in an evil way.
[01:55:35.311 --> 01:55:35.831]  Who knows?
[01:55:35.831 --> 01:55:37.353]  You're probably right.
[01:55:37.353 --> 01:55:38.954]  You know?
[01:55:38.954 --> 01:55:40.375]  So that's number one.
[01:55:40.375 --> 01:55:40.735]  Who knows?
[01:55:40.735 --> 01:55:42.817]  Maybe you guys could have a little thing.
[01:55:42.817 --> 01:55:44.198]  Where's Ruth?
[01:55:44.198 --> 01:55:47.121]  Because that's straight up a lie.
[01:55:47.121 --> 01:55:52.585]  Number two, and this ties into what Darren, your first caller from Canada said, the chemtrails
[01:55:53.243 --> 01:55:57.950]  And the vaccinations and, you know, having sovereignty over your body and so forth.
[01:55:57.950 --> 01:56:00.453]  And I take X2, awesome product.
[01:56:00.453 --> 01:56:04.800]  But, dude, they are vaccinating us through the chemtrails.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:07.544]  So even if you stay and say, oh, well, I don't, I disagree.
[01:56:08.377 --> 01:56:09.398]  Sovereignty over my body.
[01:56:09.398 --> 01:56:10.878]  I'm not going to take your shot.
[01:56:10.878 --> 01:56:11.899]  I'm not going to take your pill.
[01:56:11.899 --> 01:56:12.759]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:56:12.759 --> 01:56:13.319]  Here's the deal.
[01:56:13.319 --> 01:56:16.441]  I mean, I grew up in Texas and almost nobody had allergies.
[01:56:16.441 --> 01:56:18.582]  Now, 90% of people got them.
[01:56:18.582 --> 01:56:20.743]  Most people can hardly breathe.
[01:56:20.743 --> 01:56:26.266]  And we know that the jet stream goes over China and dips in over China and basically dumps over Texas.
[01:56:26.266 --> 01:56:29.867]  That Coriolis or that part of the jet stream that coils around the earth.
[01:56:31.628 --> 01:56:42.438]  Is, is reflected from China on the other side of the planet to Texas, where it dumps in over central China, that dumps over New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, and we get a lot of the toxic waste raining down on us.
[01:56:42.438 --> 01:56:44.219]  Well, they just call that allergies.
[01:56:44.219 --> 01:56:51.045]  And then your body, when there is other pollen and other stuff, just starts rejecting everything and battling and fighting back.
[01:56:51.045 --> 01:56:52.606]  And we go, oh, everybody's got allergies.
[01:56:52.606 --> 01:56:56.390]  No, you got toxic waste raining down out of the sky on you.
[01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:58.792]  And you know, I love Texas, a lot of nice people, a lot of good folks, but
[01:57:00.205 --> 01:57:05.289]  Not a good place to live because of the toxic waste dumping in out of the sky.
[01:57:05.289 --> 01:57:13.695]  And if I had the money and if I had the funds, I'd move this to Montana or Wyoming or someplace in, you know, Utah where they don't have the jet stream dumping in over them.
[01:57:13.695 --> 01:57:20.821]  Texas is getting vaporized by the Chicom factories that have no scrubbers, no environmental controls.
[01:57:20.821 --> 01:57:27.166]  It goes up into the sky, gets picked up by the jet stream, that stays up at 35,000 feet until it comes in over Texas.
[01:57:27.526 --> 01:57:33.908]  There's lots of areas in the world where it goes up to 40, 50,000 feet and comes back down to, you know, 10,000 feet.
[01:57:33.908 --> 01:57:37.610]  Well, Texas is one of those places and it just so happens.
[01:57:37.610 --> 01:57:39.730]  That's where the stuff from China dumps.
[01:57:39.730 --> 01:57:42.131]  So we are the toilet of China.
[01:57:42.131 --> 01:57:44.032]  I live in the Chai Com Toilet.
[01:57:47.265 --> 01:57:52.827]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[01:57:52.827 --> 01:57:53.867]  Alpha Power.

[01:58:38.452 --> 01:58:40.934]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[01:58:47.992 --> 01:58:51.595]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[01:58:51.595 --> 01:58:53.356]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:58:53.356 --> 01:59:04.645]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:59:05.405 --> 01:59:14.190]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:59:14.190 --> 01:59:20.573]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[01:59:20.573 --> 01:59:25.656]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:59:25.656 --> 01:59:27.897]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[01:59:28.257 --> 01:59:29.978]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:59:29.978 --> 01:59:39.983]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:59:39.983 --> 01:59:42.624]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:59:42.624 --> 01:59:51.148]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[01:59:51.148 --> 01:59:53.850]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:06.941 --> 02:00:12.385]  Live, raw, and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[02:00:12.385 --> 02:00:14.386]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:14.386 --> 02:00:30.596]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:00:30.596 --> 02:00:34.578]  Don't care about one political ideology being banned from the internet.
[02:00:34.578 --> 02:00:35.499]  I don't really care, no.
[02:00:36.893 --> 02:00:43.517]  Okay, if you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[02:00:43.517 --> 02:00:49.059]  You!
[02:00:49.059 --> 02:00:57.444]  After Facebook banned Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, we're here at Kent State University to see if students support that type of censorship against conservatives.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:14.653]  Social media can try to ban Alex Jones all they want, but they can't ban you from putting up these signs all around your town and supporting us at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:01:14.653 --> 02:01:19.099]  What's your take on big tech companies censoring prominent conservative voices?
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:30.165]  In all honesty, when you have certain voices making certain remarks, like Alex Jones says, that sometimes people will report on that.
[02:01:30.165 --> 02:01:40.551]  And it's like, you don't want to, but in a way, if it's something that can be seen as scary or something, then they have every right to do that.
[02:01:40.551 --> 02:01:41.191]  It's just like,
[02:01:41.391 --> 02:01:43.551]  What has Alex Jones said that's scary?
[02:01:43.551 --> 02:01:49.793]  Well, he's had a lot of, like, stuff saying, like, that Obama is sulfur and demons.
[02:01:49.793 --> 02:01:52.173]  A bunch of falsified stuff.
[02:01:52.173 --> 02:01:56.554]  Do you think that's a ground for completely deplatforming him?
[02:01:56.554 --> 02:02:01.015]  I think, in a way, respectfully, I think yes, because he has had this.
[02:02:01.015 --> 02:02:02.696]  Okay, we're gonna take more of your calls.
[02:02:02.696 --> 02:02:06.897]  When we come back from break, I'm gonna try to get five in in this segment.
[02:02:06.897 --> 02:02:08.137]  Everybody's been holding at least an hour.
[02:02:09.329 --> 02:02:21.497]  And then we're going to continue on with your calls, but I need to get to this full report of Caitlin Bennett because every person she talked to, I talked to her on the phone yesterday about this report.
[02:02:21.497 --> 02:02:30.083]  She shows every person she talked to, one person believes in free speech.
[02:02:30.083 --> 02:02:31.684]  Every person.
[02:02:31.684 --> 02:02:37.407]  She probably talks to 20 something people.
[02:02:37.407 --> 02:02:37.988]  One person.
[02:02:39.847 --> 02:02:42.888]  And that's what I find at the University of Texas.
[02:02:42.888 --> 02:02:44.328]  And let me tell you something.
[02:02:44.328 --> 02:02:53.770]  I don't feel big and powerful when I'm down there and these people look like zombies.
[02:02:53.770 --> 02:03:00.791]  The only way to describe it is that they're so entitled and they repeat the same psychobabble, anti-America stuff.
[02:03:00.791 --> 02:03:02.012]  It's just very painful.
[02:03:02.012 --> 02:03:03.052]  It's actually got me depressed.
[02:03:04.807 --> 02:03:07.570]  Because I want to think more of my countrymen and women.
[02:03:07.570 --> 02:03:08.090]  But you know what?
[02:03:08.090 --> 02:03:09.632]  I get around construction workers.
[02:03:09.632 --> 02:03:11.513]  They can be black, Hispanic, white.
[02:03:11.513 --> 02:03:12.674]  They know what's going on.
[02:03:12.674 --> 02:03:13.515]  They're smart.
[02:03:13.515 --> 02:03:14.476]  They're living their lives.
[02:03:14.476 --> 02:03:15.377]  They've got to pay their bills.
[02:03:15.377 --> 02:03:16.678]  They've got kids.
[02:03:16.678 --> 02:03:19.361]  They've got talk radio on.
[02:03:19.361 --> 02:03:20.382]  And the left always says that.
[02:03:20.382 --> 02:03:22.383]  They go, oh, the undereducated.
[02:03:22.383 --> 02:03:23.725]  That's who the right-wingers have.
[02:03:25.908 --> 02:03:34.294]  Actually, statistically, the right wing has the largest group of the middle class, then a lot of blue-collar people, and then some ultra-rich.
[02:03:34.294 --> 02:03:39.678]  But yes, most ultra-rich are liberals because it's a system of controlling and dumbing people down.
[02:03:39.678 --> 02:03:42.239]  They're leftist.
[02:03:42.239 --> 02:03:48.824]  But I gotta tell ya, just to watch how sheltered these people are,
[02:03:50.322 --> 02:03:57.285]  They don't know how to do anything, but they know how to tell you to live your life.
[02:03:57.285 --> 02:04:02.227]  So wait till we play this video coming up here today.
[02:04:02.227 --> 02:04:05.849]  And I haven't talked about this yet, but it's a really important initiative.
[02:04:05.849 --> 02:04:10.891]  We've done this four or five other times I can remember in the last 15 years or so.
[02:04:10.891 --> 02:04:19.035]  And every time we did it, it was extremely successful and really spurred free speech and showed the system we can circumvent them.
[02:04:20.686 --> 02:04:24.069]  And circumnavigate their attempts to block us off.
[02:04:24.069 --> 02:04:46.307]  But if all the listeners, and I mean all, millions are listening every hour, if everyone, I don't care if it's the water cooler, I don't care if it's on a power pole by your house, I don't care if it's at the bulletin board at church, put up a InfoWars.com is forbidden information poster or something like that, it will trigger
[02:04:47.355 --> 02:04:50.816]  The anti-freeze people will go crazy, and that will expose them.
[02:04:50.816 --> 02:04:56.398]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:56.398 --> 02:05:03.520]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:15.884]  Help the good bacteria thrive and support overall digestive health with our specially formulated Prebiotic Fiber, a mixture of clinically studied and organic acacia, fruit, and flax fiber.
[02:05:16.604 --> 02:05:27.696]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.
[02:05:27.696 --> 02:05:34.443]  InfoWars Life's cutting-edge formula only brings you the highest quality, organic, and clinically studied ingredients.
[02:05:35.063 --> 02:05:49.712]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon for maximum prebiotic effect.
[02:05:49.712 --> 02:05:52.394]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:05:59.759 --> 02:06:02.422]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:02.422 --> 02:06:07.547]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:06:11.392 --> 02:06:16.697]  The crew did a great job throwing this page up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:06:16.697 --> 02:06:20.380]  And it's getting updated every hour with more designs.
[02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:23.702]  And if you send us your designs, we'll get them up on the site as well.
[02:06:23.702 --> 02:06:27.445]  If you're a radio listener, you can go to InfoWars.com and see this on the front page.
[02:06:27.445 --> 02:06:30.308]  If you're a TV viewer, obviously we're going to show you some of these now.
[02:06:30.308 --> 02:06:31.248]  And they go right to your phone calls.
[02:06:32.242 --> 02:06:43.165]  Big Tech has been abusing its authority, abusing its monopoly to censor nationalist pro-Trump folks that want to try to save our country and other nations.
[02:06:43.165 --> 02:06:44.985]  And they've been trying to bully us.
[02:06:44.985 --> 02:06:57.628]  Well, in the past, to expose vaccine dangers or fluoride dangers or Obama wanting to confiscate guns, we would put out posters on the site and encourage listeners to post them in legal and lawful areas, videotape yourself doing it,
[02:06:58.368 --> 02:07:05.659]  Post it to Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, whatever the case is, so that others get inspired to do it as well.
[02:07:05.659 --> 02:07:09.585]  And some videos get a million views, some get 10,000, it doesn't matter.
[02:07:09.585 --> 02:07:11.388]  You're taking action in the third dimension.
[02:07:12.441 --> 02:07:18.103]  And so we have this article, Humanity Won't Submit, Here's How You Can Strike Back Against Censorship.
[02:07:18.103 --> 02:07:28.267]  Take back your own rights, and I would say the third dimension, outside of cyberspace, personally strike back against censorship and those who attempt to bully you into submission with this powerful poster campaign.
[02:07:29.347 --> 02:07:31.909]  And again, the crew wrote this, it's great, I'm going to rewrite it.
[02:07:31.909 --> 02:07:36.092]  Take back your right of action, your right of speech, your right to be heard.
[02:07:36.092 --> 02:07:40.115]  It says take back your civil rights, take back your right to free speech.
[02:07:40.115 --> 02:07:50.944]  In a counter-strike against the coordinated censorship by big tech and MSM cartels, InfoWars is launching a grassroots poster campaign to circumvent their digital blacklisting of independent voices.
[02:07:50.944 --> 02:07:51.644]  Exactly.
[02:07:51.644 --> 02:07:53.306]  To get around their electronic Berlin Wall.
[02:07:53.866 --> 02:08:00.549]  We're bringing back the tried and true method of reaching people through art and information in posters, like the French Resistance.
[02:08:02.998 --> 02:08:06.019]  Here's poster designs you can print out and post in your area.
[02:08:06.019 --> 02:08:08.359]  Pick whatever ones you like or make your own.
[02:08:08.359 --> 02:08:18.142]  And again, we have links in here for you to submit your own to us and we will post them on the site as well so others can get them and use them.
[02:08:18.142 --> 02:08:19.422]  So we've got some new ones we've made.
[02:08:19.422 --> 02:08:21.403]  A bunch of new ones are getting made as we speak.
[02:08:21.403 --> 02:08:24.344]  Infowars is forbidden information.
[02:08:24.344 --> 02:08:28.445]  It's okay to love America.
[02:08:28.445 --> 02:08:29.985]  It's okay to be conservative.
[02:08:33.473 --> 02:08:36.174]  Save free speech, Infowars.com.
[02:08:36.174 --> 02:08:43.217]  Hey, we ought to make one with that graphic they had in Wired Magazine where they called me Voldemort, the one who should not be named.
[02:08:43.217 --> 02:08:48.359]  Maybe show me being grabbed and then under it says, the one who must not be named.
[02:08:48.359 --> 02:08:51.761]  Learn who the one who must not be named is at Infowars.com.
[02:08:51.761 --> 02:08:52.221]  That's a good one.
[02:08:53.066 --> 02:08:54.227]  We'll have that one.
[02:08:54.227 --> 02:08:55.708]  It's okay to be human.
[02:08:55.708 --> 02:08:57.990]  They're gonna say that's a white supremacist symbol.
[02:08:57.990 --> 02:08:59.731]  Somebody even made one of those in a hockey game.
[02:08:59.731 --> 02:09:01.953]  They're like, stop the presses, call the police.
[02:09:01.953 --> 02:09:03.814]  Someone made an okay sign.
[02:09:03.814 --> 02:09:10.960]  In the international sign language and in law enforcement and in diving, this means everything's a-okay.
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:13.462]  Index finger to thumb means okay.
[02:09:13.462 --> 02:09:20.127]  You touch your lips and go, that's French or Italian for delicioso.
[02:09:20.127 --> 02:09:20.748]  Bon appetit.
[02:09:22.085 --> 02:09:23.586]  Vaccines can kill.
[02:09:23.586 --> 02:09:25.087]  Demand to see the actual insert.
[02:09:25.087 --> 02:09:30.031]  Learn the side effects and dangers for yourselves and your family.
[02:09:30.031 --> 02:09:32.352]  So these are just some of the designs already up there.
[02:09:32.352 --> 02:09:33.733]  Resistance is Victory.
[02:09:33.733 --> 02:09:34.974]  Infowars.com.
[02:09:34.974 --> 02:09:36.395]  Please get it.
[02:09:36.395 --> 02:09:38.717]  Please get them out.
[02:09:38.717 --> 02:09:44.221]  I am going to go out today and I am going to put some of these signs up.
[02:09:44.221 --> 02:09:47.163]  And I think I'm gonna go put some vaccine signs up.
[02:09:48.891 --> 02:09:56.398]  In and around where people will see them at Walgreens or at CVS.
[02:09:56.398 --> 02:10:06.146]  Why no one gets upset when somebody puts something on somebody's car about a car wash or a potluck dinner or a garage sale.
[02:10:06.146 --> 02:10:07.507]  They'll call it terrorism in the news.
[02:10:07.507 --> 02:10:11.711]  I'm gonna stick them under people's windshield wipers, the danger of vaccines.
[02:10:11.711 --> 02:10:14.554]  And then, because they're suppressing our speech,
[02:10:15.979 --> 02:10:24.552]  It becomes legal and lawful and moral to have cognitive resistance, to their cognitive resistance, to have civil disobedience.
[02:10:26.587 --> 02:10:27.928]  Yes.
[02:10:27.928 --> 02:10:33.092]  Nobody arrests any of the people when they go to a gun shop and lay down in it and say, we're shutting this place down.
[02:10:33.092 --> 02:10:34.273]  Oh, they're good people.
[02:10:34.273 --> 02:10:37.535]  But if I go lay down in a Walgreens and expose the deadly vaccines, they'll have me arrested.
[02:10:37.535 --> 02:10:40.398]  But we're getting to that point of the sit-ins.
[02:10:40.398 --> 02:10:43.680]  We're getting to that point of going and protesting at the big tech companies.
[02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:49.144]  We're getting to the point long ago that it's time to take action legally and lawfully and peacefully.
[02:10:49.144 --> 02:10:49.785]  But whatever you do,
[02:10:51.889 --> 02:11:02.567]  Post some of these signs in your neighborhood, post them around universities, post them around leftist areas, and you will see fireworks.
[02:11:02.567 --> 02:11:04.811]  Especially if you call the media yourself in on it.
[02:11:05.788 --> 02:11:11.851]  They'll then show up like it's the devil, and then the local public will backlash against it, saying, no, this is America.
[02:11:11.851 --> 02:11:13.532]  But this is how we let them know.
[02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:20.996]  And imagine, if large parts of the audience do this, and become real activists, which many of you have already done, that's what they're fearing, is you taking action.
[02:11:20.996 --> 02:11:24.738]  They don't fear me, they fear you.
[02:11:24.738 --> 02:11:26.158]  Okay, let's go back to your calls.
[02:11:26.158 --> 02:11:28.800]  Again, thank you for holding, I really appreciate that.
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:31.041]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mitch in Canada.
[02:11:31.041 --> 02:11:32.161]  Mitch, thanks for holding.
[02:11:32.161 --> 02:11:33.042]  You're a trooper, welcome.
[02:11:34.372 --> 02:11:35.313]  Hey, Alex.
[02:11:35.313 --> 02:11:36.835]  First time caller, long time listener.
[02:11:36.835 --> 02:11:37.656]  Thanks for having me.
[02:11:37.656 --> 02:11:39.658]  Thank you.
[02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:42.982]  I just actually quickly wanted to touch on your last guest.
[02:11:42.982 --> 02:11:48.489]  He was talking about kind of embracing your masculinity.
[02:11:48.489 --> 02:11:54.035]  I just think it's funny right now, like I'm cooking up some wild game that I personally went out and stalked.
[02:11:54.035 --> 02:11:54.496]  That's awesome.
[02:11:55.293 --> 02:11:59.396]  Yeah, it just feels good to embrace masculinity, especially in this day and age.
[02:11:59.396 --> 02:12:00.196]  I think it's humanity.
[02:12:00.196 --> 02:12:02.178]  I mean, I think gardening's masculine.
[02:12:02.178 --> 02:12:03.719]  I think, you know, cleaning the house.
[02:12:03.719 --> 02:12:06.481]  I mean, I think it's just doing real things.
[02:12:06.481 --> 02:12:08.742]  Yeah, yeah, I totally agree.
[02:12:08.742 --> 02:12:10.644]  That kind of brings me to my next point here.
[02:12:10.644 --> 02:12:19.109]  I see Representative Brian Sims was out calling for children to be doxed who are out praying out front of an abortion clinic.
[02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:20.871]  I'm not sure if you guys have touched on this yet.
[02:12:20.871 --> 02:12:21.891]  We did play it yesterday.
[02:12:21.891 --> 02:12:22.692]  It's a big story now.
[02:12:23.436 --> 02:12:24.997]  Yeah.
[02:12:24.997 --> 02:12:25.617]  That's the other thing.
[02:12:25.617 --> 02:12:32.879]  I'm having a hard time finding your podcast on my usual site.
[02:12:32.879 --> 02:12:35.840]  Well, there's InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:40.601]  You can find the audio and video feeds and then there's just a box you click.
[02:12:40.601 --> 02:12:42.142]  Are you having trouble on InfoWars finding it?
[02:12:42.967 --> 02:12:48.472]  Well, no, I usually just listen to rebroadcasts because at work I can't listen to it a lot.
[02:12:48.472 --> 02:12:48.953]  I understand.
[02:12:48.953 --> 02:12:51.715]  Where are you having trouble finding the podcast?
[02:12:51.715 --> 02:12:53.257]  Podcast Addict?
[02:12:53.257 --> 02:12:56.700]  It's just like a podcast streaming.
[02:12:56.700 --> 02:12:58.582]  Yeah, we've been blacklisted almost everywhere, sir.
[02:12:58.582 --> 02:13:04.668]  You have to go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and there you can find the links to subscribe directly to us to find the podcast.
[02:13:05.387 --> 02:13:05.907]  For sure.
[02:13:05.907 --> 02:13:06.487]  Okay, I appreciate that.
[02:13:06.487 --> 02:13:09.769]  Or if you have a Droid, you can still get our free app.
[02:13:09.769 --> 02:13:14.151]  We were kicked off Apple because we went to number one in news, so they banned that app.
[02:13:14.151 --> 02:13:16.252]  But if you have an Android, it's InfoWars.com.
[02:13:16.252 --> 02:13:17.752]  Yeah, that's what I'm using today.
[02:13:17.752 --> 02:13:20.573]  InfoWars.com forward slash app.
[02:13:20.573 --> 02:13:21.294]  It's free.
[02:13:21.294 --> 02:13:26.456]  I just wanted to say that I'm sick of the stigma that men shouldn't have an opinion on abortion.
[02:13:27.349 --> 02:13:28.910]  You know, you always hear that all the time.
[02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:32.852]  It's like, you're not a woman, you don't have a say.
[02:13:32.852 --> 02:13:33.992]  Oh yeah, that's a mind game.
[02:13:33.992 --> 02:13:41.055]  As if one half of the species shouldn't have an opinion on killing babies before they're born, and now they want to kill babies after they're born, they say we shouldn't have an opinion.
[02:13:41.055 --> 02:13:43.777]  Shouldn't a man that's with a woman have an opinion?
[02:13:43.777 --> 02:13:45.337]  But now, see, they want women all alone.
[02:13:45.337 --> 02:13:50.720]  The idea that a woman shouldn't have a kid, and just a man shouldn't be involved, period, that's because they want the state involved.
[02:13:50.720 --> 02:13:51.740]  As her pimp.
[02:13:51.740 --> 02:13:52.661]  As her flesh broker.
[02:13:54.138 --> 02:13:54.819]  Exactly.
[02:13:54.819 --> 02:13:56.680]  Get that fleshy juice ball.
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:58.101]  Keep it comfortable.
[02:13:58.101 --> 02:14:00.543]  Yeah.
[02:14:00.543 --> 02:14:02.285]  It takes two people to make a baby.
[02:14:02.285 --> 02:14:12.673]  It's part of humanity and I think as men, as part of the human race, we need to start sticking up and stop falling for the tricks.
[02:14:12.673 --> 02:14:13.334]  Absolutely.
[02:14:13.334 --> 02:14:15.215]  If we won't take care of our babies,
[02:14:16.058 --> 02:14:21.460]  If we won't stand up for the unborn, then there's no value on human life, and that's what it is.
[02:14:21.460 --> 02:14:25.641]  And the left, universally, is a death cult.
[02:14:25.641 --> 02:14:34.444]  They are a group of swindlers, scammers, and a group of wannabe power lords who desperately want to bully us into submission.
[02:14:34.444 --> 02:14:38.805]  And they are deranged, and they are spreading like a cancer, my friend.
[02:14:38.805 --> 02:14:41.086]  Anything else?
[02:14:41.086 --> 02:14:45.467]  No, I just wanted to touch on that and, you know, the death of free speech.
[02:14:47.105 --> 02:14:48.006]  It's pretty crazy right now.
[02:14:48.006 --> 02:14:49.027]  I appreciate you having me on.
[02:14:49.027 --> 02:14:54.354]  I'll give a plug for... I've tried your Supermeal Vitality, Brain Force, and some Knockout.
[02:14:54.354 --> 02:14:55.976]  All great products.
[02:14:55.976 --> 02:14:56.537]  Thank you, brother.
[02:14:56.537 --> 02:14:57.358]  Couldn't do it without you.
[02:14:57.358 --> 02:14:57.999]  Thank you so much.
[02:14:58.874 --> 02:15:02.777]  They really are good products, and that's how we fund this operation.
[02:15:02.777 --> 02:15:16.967]  So whether it's fish oil people need, or whether it's turmeric people need, or whether it is high-quality coffee, or whether it's protein bars, or whether it's a great pre-workout, post-workout, all-day energy, nothing better than TurboForce.
[02:15:16.967 --> 02:15:17.928]  You need it.
[02:15:17.928 --> 02:15:18.528]  You want it.
[02:15:18.528 --> 02:15:20.970]  It's a popular thing out there that works well.
[02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:21.931]  Our bone broth's the best.
[02:15:22.836 --> 02:15:30.038]  All of it's really, really good, and we have got the specials on a bottle of X2 for 25% off with a free bottle of X3.
[02:15:30.038 --> 02:15:32.259]  That ends early next week.
[02:15:32.259 --> 02:15:38.361]  We have the new special on the double strong, highest quality medical bottle, the Vibram B12.
[02:15:38.361 --> 02:15:42.002]  Ultra 12 just came in, and people are loving it.
[02:15:42.002 --> 02:15:47.384]  It is twice as strong as Secret 12, but the same type.
[02:15:47.384 --> 02:15:48.985]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[02:15:48.985 --> 02:15:49.625]  Stay with us, please.
[02:15:55.217 --> 02:15:59.099]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[02:15:59.099 --> 02:16:04.081]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[02:16:04.081 --> 02:16:08.903]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[02:17:24.494 --> 02:17:30.856]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:30.856 --> 02:17:33.897]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.897 --> 02:17:39.819]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.819 --> 02:17:43.600]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:44.881]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:44.881 --> 02:17:46.221]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.221 --> 02:17:52.423]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.423 --> 02:17:53.844]  Available at Amazon Books.

[02:18:10.646 --> 02:18:15.450]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[02:18:56.220 --> 02:19:06.831]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[02:19:06.831 --> 02:19:11.757]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[02:19:11.757 --> 02:19:13.258]  It's made in the USA.
[02:19:13.258 --> 02:19:16.382]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[02:19:16.602 --> 02:19:20.064]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:19:20.064 --> 02:19:22.146]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:19:22.146 --> 02:19:31.852]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[02:19:31.852 --> 02:19:44.360]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:48.646]  To reignite those rush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[02:19:48.646 --> 02:19:51.950]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together we're changing the world.
[02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:59.240]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield and Infowarslife.com.
[02:19:59.240 --> 02:20:01.863]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:18.584 --> 02:20:22.965]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:20:22.965 --> 02:20:26.726]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:26.726 --> 02:20:28.726]  Why are they doing this now?
[02:20:28.726 --> 02:20:33.947]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but... Yes, exactly.
[02:20:33.947 --> 02:20:42.949]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him, they banned his, like, little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:20:42.949 --> 02:20:47.550]  Now that they kicked him off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[02:20:47.850 --> 02:20:51.772]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[02:20:51.772 --> 02:21:00.598]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say, you know, all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[02:21:00.598 --> 02:21:02.158]  I have no issue with it at all.
[02:21:02.158 --> 02:21:03.239]  I want them shut down.
[02:21:03.239 --> 02:21:04.200]  I want them silenced.
[02:21:04.200 --> 02:21:05.040]  I want them muted.
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.182]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:21:08.182 --> 02:21:09.583]  I want them shut down!
[02:21:09.583 --> 02:21:11.144]  I want them silenced!
[02:21:11.144 --> 02:21:12.384]  I want them muted!
[02:21:12.384 --> 02:21:13.645]  But don't worry.
[02:21:13.645 --> 02:21:14.806]  These people aren't terrifying.
[02:21:17.102 --> 02:21:22.144]  You know, I've never heard a clip as much as I've played that since last Friday.
[02:21:22.144 --> 02:21:24.424]  And there's so many other clips of them saying the same thing since then.
[02:21:24.424 --> 02:21:27.705]  We've put a new compilation together.
[02:21:27.705 --> 02:21:30.426]  The biggest shows in the country saying, I want them shut down.
[02:21:30.426 --> 02:21:31.687]  I want them silenced.
[02:21:31.687 --> 02:21:32.607]  I want them muted.
[02:21:32.607 --> 02:21:35.468]  I am Thanos.
[02:21:35.468 --> 02:21:37.169]  You are my slaves.
[02:21:37.169 --> 02:21:38.449]  I want you silenced.
[02:21:38.449 --> 02:21:39.349]  I want you muted.
[02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:40.970]  I want you shut down.
[02:21:42.025 --> 02:21:46.506]  Take any villain, your planet is now under our control.
[02:21:46.506 --> 02:21:50.447]  Resistance is futile and illegal.
[02:21:50.447 --> 02:21:54.388]  And coming up next segment, I'm gonna play the Caitlin Bennett, unedited.
[02:21:54.388 --> 02:21:57.349]  I talked to her yesterday, right after she put this up.
[02:21:57.349 --> 02:22:00.130]  She's so fast, she put it up the same day.
[02:22:00.130 --> 02:22:02.990]  And I said, let me guess, you basically showed it in the order of the people.
[02:22:02.990 --> 02:22:04.711]  She said, yeah.
[02:22:04.711 --> 02:22:09.572]  I mean, it's edited, they cut it down, they cut the spaces out, but every person she talked to,
[02:22:12.546 --> 02:22:13.287]  Is in it.
[02:22:13.287 --> 02:22:14.968]  We're not cherry picking.
[02:22:14.968 --> 02:22:19.011]  It's horrifying.
[02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:19.932]  And tyranny's here.
[02:22:19.932 --> 02:22:20.893]  It's out in the open now.
[02:22:20.893 --> 02:22:22.294]  Yeah, we're killing babies after they're born.
[02:22:22.294 --> 02:22:23.555]  Yeah, we're reading your email.
[02:22:23.555 --> 02:22:25.236]  Yeah, we're watching everything you do on Facebook.
[02:22:25.236 --> 02:22:27.157]  Yeah, we're listening to you inside your house.
[02:22:27.157 --> 02:22:33.282]  And Alex Jones is discredited for being the first person to tell you about it.
[02:22:33.282 --> 02:22:34.743]  And imagine these authoritarians.
[02:22:34.743 --> 02:22:36.084]  They want power.
[02:22:36.084 --> 02:22:39.827]  I remember being 18 years old.
[02:22:39.827 --> 02:22:41.529]  I had a job.
[02:22:42.864 --> 02:22:45.485]  My parents had moved into a smaller house.
[02:22:45.485 --> 02:22:48.526]  I was still living with them.
[02:22:48.526 --> 02:22:53.148]  And my mom bought some oriental rugs.
[02:22:53.148 --> 02:22:54.649]  And I was saying, I don't like this one.
[02:22:54.649 --> 02:22:56.710]  I don't like that one.
[02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:58.690]  And I had my girlfriend there and she was rude to my mom or something.
[02:22:58.690 --> 02:23:02.592]  And my mom said, you're going to be moved out of here in about a week.
[02:23:02.592 --> 02:23:05.513]  She told my dad, she goes, David, get him out of here.
[02:23:05.513 --> 02:23:08.054]  But that was because I didn't have my own life.
[02:23:08.054 --> 02:23:11.096]  Now I would never tell my mom what rugs to have, even though I don't like them.
[02:23:11.096 --> 02:23:11.776]  She has great taste.
[02:23:12.765 --> 02:23:15.346]  I didn't have good taste.
[02:23:15.346 --> 02:23:20.527]  What I'm saying is, is that people that don't run their own lives want to run other people's lives.
[02:23:20.527 --> 02:23:22.307]  I don't want to run my neighbor's lives.
[02:23:22.307 --> 02:23:25.188]  I'm not looking over their fence, because I got a life.
[02:23:25.188 --> 02:23:27.209]  These people don't have one.
[02:23:27.209 --> 02:23:28.849]  They're dangerous.
[02:23:28.849 --> 02:23:31.910]  Okay, Patrick in Mass, thanks for holding, thanks for calling.
[02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:33.830]  I really appreciate that.
[02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:40.092]  The catch-22 is we have 20 phone lines, so we load them up, takes a couple hours to get to 20 calls, but I think you're almost the 20th caller.
[02:23:40.092 --> 02:23:40.852]  So Patrick, go ahead.
[02:23:42.102 --> 02:23:46.804]  Hey, I just want to get to the point because I know airtime is valuable.
[02:23:46.804 --> 02:23:50.826]  This is a call to arms for all the artists, particularly musicians out there.
[02:23:50.826 --> 02:23:53.367]  I think I have a great idea.
[02:23:53.367 --> 02:23:55.348]  The info tours.
[02:23:55.348 --> 02:23:59.230]  OK, we all need to set up some shows across the country.
[02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:06.774]  We need to spread the word as artists, as musicians, because as soon as people like Alex Jones are going to be censored next, it's going to be artists.
[02:24:07.796 --> 02:24:16.585]  People might not have a problem with Alex Jones being censored right now, but they're going to have a problem when they go to the local record store and they can't buy a Metallica CD.
[02:24:16.585 --> 02:24:28.258]  And let's make no mistake, I've been meaning to say this and I'm glad you said this, they always pick some character that's flamboyant that they can misrepresent to demonize and then once people don't stand up for that one character, then it's everybody and it's guaranteed
[02:24:28.798 --> 02:24:32.241]  Art, literature, music, that's the power.
[02:24:32.241 --> 02:24:33.542]  I'm getting chills right now.
[02:24:33.542 --> 02:24:35.143]  It's about all of you.
[02:24:35.143 --> 02:24:37.825]  And the left is the most censoring towards themselves.
[02:24:37.825 --> 02:24:39.146]  You're absolutely right.
[02:24:39.146 --> 02:24:41.728]  People, again, instinctively used to know this.
[02:24:41.728 --> 02:24:49.834]  What happened the last 10 years where suddenly it's like a minority of people will stand up for free speech?
[02:24:49.834 --> 02:24:50.715]  I completely agree.
[02:24:50.715 --> 02:24:57.900]  And I'll tell you, you know, coming from Western Massachusetts or my blue hell, as I like to refer to it as, just being a Trump supporter,
[02:24:58.584 --> 02:25:02.445]  You know, it's impossible to get gigs out here as soon as people find that out.
[02:25:02.445 --> 02:25:09.728]  And I think that's unfair, and I'm sure there's a lot of musicians listening right now that are experiencing the same problem, and I think we all need to stick together.
[02:25:09.728 --> 02:25:11.409]  We need to organize and... No, I totally agree.
[02:25:11.409 --> 02:25:13.209]  You know, there's something that makes me proud.
[02:25:13.209 --> 02:25:20.172]  They couldn't get, in two and a half years, one Trump supporter, who are mainly just populists and libertarians, not even right-wingers, most Trump supporters.
[02:25:20.172 --> 02:25:20.792]  I'm not.
[02:25:20.792 --> 02:25:22.573]  I'm really a libertarian.
[02:25:22.573 --> 02:25:25.034]  They tried, they offered people millions of dollars, everything.
[02:25:25.794 --> 02:25:28.375]  And nobody took the so-called Russian money.
[02:25:28.375 --> 02:25:31.696]  They couldn't get one Trump supporter to be unfaithful.
[02:25:31.696 --> 02:25:34.437]  The first Democrat they talked to had taken the money.
[02:25:34.437 --> 02:25:46.522]  But beyond that, when they demonetized everybody five years ago, and then censored everybody two years ago, almost no one I know has backed down and turned to their side because they've tried to bankrupt us.
[02:25:46.522 --> 02:25:49.203]  And let me guess, them trying to shut you down?
[02:25:49.203 --> 02:25:52.804]  I mean, did that make you want to roll over to them, Patrick?
[02:25:52.804 --> 02:25:53.684]  Oh, absolutely not.
[02:25:53.684 --> 02:25:54.925]  It just made me write better music.
[02:25:56.599 --> 02:25:58.841]  Absolutely.
[02:25:58.841 --> 02:26:00.802]  But see, the left though, they're the conformists.
[02:26:00.802 --> 02:26:03.044]  And I'm not just saying this to go, oh, look how good we are.
[02:26:03.044 --> 02:26:04.786]  They're the followers.
[02:26:04.786 --> 02:26:13.252]  And they're just pissed that we're not being good little followers like them, because they're told a utopia is coming once we all think the same.
[02:26:13.252 --> 02:26:13.492]  Right.
[02:26:13.492 --> 02:26:15.014]  And it's completely absurd.
[02:26:15.014 --> 02:26:18.396]  And I don't know why more people aren't upset about it.
[02:26:18.396 --> 02:26:21.839]  You know, once they take away the freedom of expression,
[02:26:22.443 --> 02:26:24.586]  You know, what do you have?
[02:26:24.586 --> 02:26:26.028]  You don't have a society anymore.
[02:26:26.028 --> 02:26:28.451]  I mean, I don't want to look at a blank piece of paper.
[02:26:28.451 --> 02:26:30.313]  I want to see someone paint.
[02:26:30.313 --> 02:26:32.776]  I don't want to look at a blank music sheet.
[02:26:32.776 --> 02:26:34.959]  I want to hear someone play some music, you know?
[02:26:36.118 --> 02:26:36.799]  I totally agree.
[02:26:36.799 --> 02:26:38.680]  You know, I should have led the show with this today.
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:41.822]  I told everybody this about a year ago because I saw it in their announcement.
[02:26:41.822 --> 02:26:50.689]  Microsoft is going to watch all of your computers in live time and not let you type things that it thinks are politically incorrect, but this is what's better.
[02:26:50.689 --> 02:27:01.617]  In the fine print, trying to find the article today, in the fine print, it reports back to Microsoft what you're writing.
[02:27:01.617 --> 02:27:02.618]  What do you think of them apples?
[02:27:04.380 --> 02:27:14.606]  Well, you know, I recall, I wish I knew where it came from, but I read an article that actually there's robots that are scanning bands' demo submissions.
[02:27:14.606 --> 02:27:23.151]  And so if your music is not played to a metronome, if your voice is not auto-tuned, record labels won't even consider your submission.
[02:27:23.151 --> 02:27:24.371]  It doesn't even get past that.
[02:27:24.371 --> 02:27:28.794]  That's right, because it's got to be ready to be read by the digital robots.
[02:27:28.794 --> 02:27:29.074]  Right.
[02:27:29.074 --> 02:27:32.576]  So if all these artists out there, you know, bite in their tongue, they don't want to
[02:27:33.126 --> 02:27:35.668]  Cross any lines thinking they might get that deal.
[02:27:35.668 --> 02:27:38.230]  You're not going to get that deal if you're making any real music.
[02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:39.952]  I'll tell you that right now.
[02:27:39.952 --> 02:27:42.574]  Well, remember what Zuckerberg said this last week?
[02:27:42.574 --> 02:27:46.217]  Alex Jones, you can't say his name, you can't say his website, what's his negative?
[02:27:46.217 --> 02:27:49.760]  Microsoft releases version of Word that makes your grammar...
[02:27:50.868 --> 02:27:52.589]  Politically correct.
[02:27:52.589 --> 02:27:57.973]  No, it surveils what you're writing, won't let you write what you want, and then reports it back.
[02:27:57.973 --> 02:28:01.175]  It's worse than Paul Watson even says.
[02:28:01.175 --> 02:28:02.336]  How do I know?
[02:28:02.336 --> 02:28:16.246]  Because I saw this new Microsoft Word a few months ago as a footnote in a NewsGuard announcement, where NewsGuard is on all this right-wing neocon warmonger group.
[02:28:16.246 --> 02:28:17.507]  It's not just leftists now, it's censoring.
[02:28:18.948 --> 02:28:25.678]  NewsGuard is on all the new Microsoft computers and phones in live time, real people on your phone.
[02:28:25.678 --> 02:28:26.900]  They're not on the browser.
[02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:28.943]  They're not out there on the website you go to.
[02:28:28.943 --> 02:28:31.588]  They're in your damn phone.
[02:28:31.588 --> 02:28:33.711]  Can you believe this revolution of tyranny, Patrick?
[02:28:34.856 --> 02:28:36.018]  It's ridiculous.
[02:28:36.018 --> 02:28:39.662]  I mean, again, I just don't understand why people aren't upset about it.
[02:28:39.662 --> 02:28:41.705]  Although, you know, they're so desensitized at this point.
[02:28:41.705 --> 02:28:42.286]  That's it.
[02:28:42.286 --> 02:28:43.107]  They're desensitized.
[02:28:43.107 --> 02:28:43.567]  God bless you.
[02:28:43.567 --> 02:28:44.068]  We're out of time.
[02:28:44.068 --> 02:28:44.609]  Call back again.
[02:28:44.609 --> 02:28:45.670]  Great caller.
[02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:48.414]  Folks, like I said, it's ridiculous.
[02:28:48.414 --> 02:28:52.299]  This is like 1984 on steroids on steroids again.
[02:28:55.077 --> 02:28:57.759]  Everyone knows, even good people fall on hard times.
[02:28:57.759 --> 02:29:01.162]  Your credit cards get maxed out, and you get behind on your taxes.
[02:29:01.162 --> 02:29:05.825]  Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding, and they won't stop until they collect.
[02:29:05.825 --> 02:29:10.489]  They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your home or business could be at risk.
[02:29:10.689 --> 02:29:14.052]  It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.
[02:29:14.052 --> 02:29:16.634]  You need to call the experts at Optima Tax Relief.
[02:29:16.634 --> 02:29:19.356]  When you call, be sure to ask about the Fresh Start Initiative.
[02:29:19.356 --> 02:29:25.821]  It's a special IRS debt assistance program that could save you thousands, even tens of thousands if you qualify.

[02:30:18.254 --> 02:30:22.335]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.

[02:30:56.450 --> 02:31:02.493]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[02:31:02.493 --> 02:31:05.415]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:05.415 --> 02:31:09.978]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of My Patriot Supply, one of the top
[02:31:11.044 --> 02:31:20.170]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.

[02:31:55.899 --> 02:31:56.939]  You like Secret 12?
[02:31:56.939 --> 02:31:59.521]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[02:31:59.521 --> 02:32:01.121]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[02:32:01.121 --> 02:32:02.222]  Most expensive.
[02:32:02.222 --> 02:32:03.262]  Vitamin B12.
[02:32:03.262 --> 02:32:04.223]  Methylcobalamin.
[02:32:04.223 --> 02:32:05.943]  And you put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[02:32:05.943 --> 02:32:08.244]  And the longer you can do it, the better.
[02:32:08.244 --> 02:32:11.045]  B12, just like clean iodine, is essential.
[02:32:11.045 --> 02:32:11.766]  Just like oxygen.
[02:32:11.766 --> 02:32:12.346]  Just like water.
[02:32:12.526 --> 02:32:16.788]  The point is, it's amazing, you need it, it's awesome, and it's the absolute go-to.
[02:32:16.788 --> 02:32:18.129]  By the way, it tastes super sweet.

[02:32:32.575 --> 02:32:36.397]  And you take it with something like a Turbo Force or a Rain Force, it just makes it all better.
[02:32:36.397 --> 02:32:39.338]  But just experience this that's right out of Mother Nature, folks.
[02:32:39.338 --> 02:32:40.359]  That's pure B12.
[02:32:40.359 --> 02:32:40.799]  So amazing.
[02:32:40.959 --> 02:32:42.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:11.089 --> 02:33:11.851]  We're good to go.
[02:33:29.443 --> 02:33:30.464]  All right, we're back live here.
[02:33:30.464 --> 02:33:33.865]  I want to play large parts of this Caitlin Bennett piece in this segment.
[02:33:33.865 --> 02:33:35.826]  In the next segment, I'll get back to your calls.
[02:33:35.826 --> 02:33:36.887]  And Matt Brackett's coming up.
[02:33:36.887 --> 02:33:43.390]  And I'm going to take a little bit of Matt Brackett's time to hit the big Facebook expose where the co-founder says that needs to be broken up.
[02:33:43.390 --> 02:33:46.092]  That's coming up, starting the next hour, that Matt Brackett will take over at 15 after.
[02:33:47.844 --> 02:33:50.985]  But the thing I want to do here is I want to air this piece.
[02:33:50.985 --> 02:33:56.146]  Again, it's up on Infowars.com that everybody should really share.
[02:33:56.146 --> 02:34:00.908]  This is college students believe in banning conservatives.
[02:34:00.908 --> 02:34:03.308]  And again, this is not a cherry picking.
[02:34:03.308 --> 02:34:09.510]  This is the monstrous anti-free speech like North Korea or the Soviet Union.
[02:34:12.483 --> 02:34:22.525]  These are just flaming authoritarians, and they're also extremely ignorant, extremely stupid, and extremely arrogant.
[02:34:22.525 --> 02:34:27.986]  So this is what higher education is today.
[02:34:27.986 --> 02:34:33.648]  Once the bastion of free speech and open ideas, now the redoubt of tyrants.
[02:34:33.648 --> 02:34:36.068]  Here it is.
[02:34:36.068 --> 02:34:39.649]  Does it bother you that conservatives are being wiped off of big tech companies?
[02:34:40.191 --> 02:34:41.971]  Not only f*** the conservatives.
[02:34:41.971 --> 02:34:44.992]  But does it bother you that their speech is being infringed on?
[02:34:44.992 --> 02:34:45.752]  Nah.
[02:34:45.752 --> 02:34:46.452]  Why not?
[02:34:46.452 --> 02:34:48.693]  Because it doesn't.
[02:34:48.693 --> 02:34:49.413]  I just told you.
[02:34:49.413 --> 02:34:51.093]  Have you heard about it?
[02:34:51.093 --> 02:34:55.834]  You haven't heard in the news all of these conservatives being banned off big tech companies' social media.
[02:34:55.834 --> 02:34:57.175]  Again, this is a little bit of the report.
[02:34:57.175 --> 02:35:03.296]  I already played some of this earlier, I understand, but we're going to start it from the beginning.
[02:35:03.296 --> 02:35:06.957]  I want people to see it from the beginning.
[02:35:06.957 --> 02:35:07.517]  Full report.
[02:35:09.343 --> 02:35:13.124]  Do you care about one political ideology being banned from the internet?
[02:35:13.124 --> 02:35:14.044]  I don't really care, no.
[02:35:14.044 --> 02:35:15.764]  It doesn't bother me.
[02:35:15.764 --> 02:35:22.065]  Okay, if you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[02:35:22.065 --> 02:35:27.586]  You!
[02:35:27.586 --> 02:35:35.968]  After Facebook banned Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson, we're here at Kent State University to see if students support that type of censorship against conservatives.
[02:35:43.610 --> 02:35:53.203]  Social media can try to ban Alex Jones all they want, but they can't ban you from putting up these signs all around your town and supporting us at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:35:53.203 --> 02:35:57.649]  What's your take on big tech companies censoring prominent conservative voices?
[02:35:58.570 --> 02:36:19.743]  in all honesty like when you have certain voices making like certain remarks like Alex Jones says but that sometimes people will report on that and it's like you don't want to but in a way you kind of like you know if it's like something that can be seen as like scary or something then they have every right to do that it's just like
[02:36:19.943 --> 02:36:22.084]  What has Alex Jones said that's scary?
[02:36:22.084 --> 02:36:28.346]  Well, he's had a lot of, like, stuff saying, like, that Obama is sulfur and demons.
[02:36:28.346 --> 02:36:30.707]  A bunch of falsified stuff.
[02:36:30.707 --> 02:36:35.089]  Do you think that's a ground for completely deplatforming him?
[02:36:35.089 --> 02:36:38.711]  I think in a way, respectfully, I think yes.
[02:36:38.711 --> 02:36:43.152]  Because he has had this, he's been warned quite a bit.
[02:36:43.152 --> 02:36:44.693]  I think so, in a way.
[02:36:44.693 --> 02:36:45.493]  Just- Time to pause.
[02:36:45.493 --> 02:36:46.414]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:36:47.099 --> 02:36:48.520]  Back it up.
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:53.141]  So if it's scary to someone, someone can't say it.
[02:36:53.141 --> 02:36:59.724]  And people do report that Hillary really smells bad, that has bad hygiene, that sometimes Obama does too.
[02:36:59.724 --> 02:37:01.484]  But I kind of push it tongue-in-cheek.
[02:37:01.484 --> 02:37:04.585]  They're public figures!
[02:37:04.585 --> 02:37:10.327]  Just like people run over to Caitlyn and threaten her and call her names, she's a public figure.
[02:37:10.327 --> 02:37:11.288]  But this is what they do.
[02:37:11.288 --> 02:37:11.888]  Let's continue.
[02:37:15.134 --> 02:37:18.675]  You that conservatives are being wiped off of big tech companies?
[02:37:18.675 --> 02:37:20.476]  Not only f*** the conservatives.
[02:37:20.476 --> 02:37:23.477]  But does it bother you that their speech is being infringed on?
[02:37:23.477 --> 02:37:24.257]  No.
[02:37:24.257 --> 02:37:24.957]  Why not?
[02:37:24.957 --> 02:37:27.198]  Because it doesn't.
[02:37:27.198 --> 02:37:27.918]  I just told you.
[02:37:27.918 --> 02:37:29.079]  Have you heard about it?
[02:37:29.079 --> 02:37:29.599]  No.
[02:37:29.599 --> 02:37:34.400]  You haven't heard in the news all of these conservatives being banned off big tech companies' social media?
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:35.941]  I don't really watch the news.
[02:37:35.941 --> 02:37:37.962]  Where do you get most of your news?
[02:37:37.962 --> 02:37:38.862]  Instagram, Twitter.
[02:37:39.338 --> 02:37:41.699]  That must be why, because they're banning their voices.
[02:37:41.699 --> 02:37:47.342]  So everybody I just listed and every organization I just listed got banned from all of social media.
[02:37:47.342 --> 02:37:49.403]  Does that bother you?
[02:37:49.403 --> 02:37:51.925]  That seems like a personal problem.
[02:37:51.925 --> 02:37:52.605]  It's personal?
[02:37:52.605 --> 02:37:54.626]  Yeah, but I don't care.
[02:37:54.626 --> 02:37:58.448]  You don't care about one political ideology being banned from the internet?
[02:37:58.448 --> 02:37:59.569]  I don't really care, no.
[02:38:01.324 --> 02:38:02.185]  Okay.
[02:38:02.185 --> 02:38:07.648]  If you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next, who would you choose?
[02:38:07.648 --> 02:38:08.489]  You.
[02:38:08.489 --> 02:38:08.769]  Me?
[02:38:08.769 --> 02:38:14.453]  Oh, that's very feminism-like and tolerant.
[02:38:14.453 --> 02:38:16.654]  What have I done to deserve to be banned?
[02:38:16.654 --> 02:38:18.816]  You're just a nuisance.
[02:38:18.816 --> 02:38:20.177]  I'm not bothering anybody.
[02:38:20.177 --> 02:38:22.058]  No, I'm just saying you're a nuisance.
[02:38:22.058 --> 02:38:28.162]  Okay, so because you don't like me and you think I'm a nuisance, I should be completely deplatformed from everything.
[02:38:28.162 --> 02:38:28.722]  Not have a voice.
[02:38:28.722 --> 02:38:29.983]  Especially Twitter.
[02:38:29.983 --> 02:38:30.624]  Especially Twitter.
[02:38:32.105 --> 02:38:33.186]  All right, here you have it.
[02:38:33.186 --> 02:38:34.026]  Kent State.
[02:38:34.026 --> 02:38:36.348]  Back in about five seconds.
[02:38:36.348 --> 02:38:37.088]  You look at this person.
[02:38:37.088 --> 02:38:38.069]  They look very unhealthy.
[02:38:38.069 --> 02:38:39.569]  They're very soft.
[02:38:39.569 --> 02:38:42.711]  And then she's looking inward, loving herself.
[02:38:42.711 --> 02:38:44.572]  It's all about her power trip.
[02:38:44.572 --> 02:38:47.594]  And she goes into these classes and is told everything she wants to hear.
[02:38:47.594 --> 02:38:48.755]  You're the new ruling class.
[02:38:48.755 --> 02:38:50.256]  We're going to smash them.
[02:38:50.256 --> 02:38:52.397]  We're going to put them in camps.
[02:38:52.397 --> 02:38:56.719]  And now here she is, seeing someone, being polite and nice to her.
[02:38:56.719 --> 02:38:59.161]  And she says, I want you removed.
[02:38:59.161 --> 02:39:00.101]  I want you shut down.
[02:39:00.101 --> 02:39:00.782]  I want you gone.
[02:39:01.727 --> 02:39:04.289]  It's about her power.
[02:39:04.289 --> 02:39:06.490]  And look, she looks demon-possessed.
[02:39:06.490 --> 02:39:07.051]  They all do.
[02:39:07.051 --> 02:39:09.092]  Let's continue.
[02:39:09.092 --> 02:39:12.014]  I should be completely de-platformed from everything.
[02:39:12.014 --> 02:39:12.654]  Not have a voice.
[02:39:12.654 --> 02:39:13.835]  Especially Twitter.
[02:39:13.835 --> 02:39:16.016]  Especially Twitter.
[02:39:16.016 --> 02:39:17.057]  Alright, here you have it.
[02:39:17.057 --> 02:39:26.023]  Kent State, liberals, feminists, supporting... And they all have victory parties when someone gets banned.
[02:39:26.023 --> 02:39:27.424]  This is their power.
[02:39:27.424 --> 02:39:29.826]  Big giant mega-monopolies worth trillions of dollars.
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:48.050]  Working with China to silence people, and have public executions, and they sit here in the lap of a once free nation, destroying that freedom that they lay around in all lazily, just reveling in the end of it.
[02:39:48.050 --> 02:39:50.812]  I'm sick of paying for their tuitions.
[02:39:50.812 --> 02:39:51.812]  I'm sick of paying.
[02:39:53.905 --> 02:39:54.625]  For their welfare.
[02:39:54.625 --> 02:39:56.646]  You know these are all slobs on welfare.
[02:39:56.646 --> 02:39:58.206]  All going deep into debt.
[02:39:58.206 --> 02:40:00.627]  Just a bunch of lazy losers.
[02:40:00.627 --> 02:40:02.887]  All proving to each other how none of them have drive.
[02:40:02.887 --> 02:40:05.928]  How great it is to be a slacker.
[02:40:05.928 --> 02:40:07.469]  What a sack of garbage.
[02:40:07.469 --> 02:40:08.949]  Let's continue.
[02:40:08.949 --> 02:40:10.570]  Deplatform.
[02:40:10.570 --> 02:40:14.191]  From social media.
[02:40:14.191 --> 02:40:15.431]  They don't want me in Akron either.
[02:40:17.225 --> 02:40:20.066]  Were you the one at my rally, like, yelling?
[02:40:20.066 --> 02:40:20.607]  I was!
[02:40:20.607 --> 02:40:22.547]  Yeah, that was me.
[02:40:22.547 --> 02:40:23.688]  Wow, are you proud of yourself?
[02:40:23.688 --> 02:40:25.049]  I'm so proud of myself, yeah.
[02:40:25.049 --> 02:40:25.829]  That's very cool.
[02:40:25.829 --> 02:40:28.950]  So do you support the censorship of Alex Jones off Facebook?
[02:40:28.950 --> 02:40:30.891]  I don't f***ing know what that is.
[02:40:30.891 --> 02:40:31.972]  You don't know who Alex Jones is?
[02:40:31.972 --> 02:40:32.572]  No.
[02:40:32.572 --> 02:40:36.694]  He's a prominent conservative figure, has his own kind of media following.
[02:40:36.694 --> 02:40:38.154]  They banned him on all social media.
[02:40:38.154 --> 02:40:38.835]  Do you support that?
[02:40:39.996 --> 02:40:42.257]  Well, if he's an a**hole like you, then yeah.
[02:40:42.257 --> 02:40:44.479]  He's a conservative, so yeah.
[02:40:44.479 --> 02:40:45.960]  He shouldn't be censored on social media.
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:48.662]  I mean, yeah, if he's cussing and stuff, yes, he should.
[02:40:48.662 --> 02:40:50.944]  So you should be censored for cussing?
[02:40:50.944 --> 02:40:53.346]  Yes, I mean, FCC rules, you know that.
[02:40:53.346 --> 02:40:56.488]  On social media, you should be censored and de-platformed.
[02:40:56.488 --> 02:41:01.913]  Well, not if you're, if you're like typing it, I don't think so, but if you're like... NFL, they cuss.
[02:41:01.913 --> 02:41:03.114]  CNN, they cuss.
[02:41:03.114 --> 02:41:06.636]  We barely even cuss, not on our FCC shows.
[02:41:06.636 --> 02:41:07.337]  He just says that.
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:12.860]  I mean, just think about this guy.
[02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:13.921]  And again, I'm sad for him.
[02:41:13.921 --> 02:41:16.661]  He looks and acts autistic.
[02:41:16.661 --> 02:41:18.202]  These people all look deranged.
[02:41:18.202 --> 02:41:20.142]  They all look crazy in their eyes.
[02:41:20.142 --> 02:41:22.563]  Continue.
[02:41:22.563 --> 02:41:27.304]  He should be taken off all social media platforms for posting a video of him cussing.
[02:41:27.304 --> 02:41:31.725]  Well, you're just cussing, and dude, the guy's also yelling at, uh, due to just something that you're known for doing.
[02:41:32.881 --> 02:41:41.343]  So you support, what kind of like, what kind of soy do you intake every day to want to ban someone and deplatform them for cussing?
[02:41:41.343 --> 02:41:42.784]  What kind of soy do you intake?
[02:41:42.784 --> 02:41:44.404]  Is it in the like soy shakes?
[02:41:44.404 --> 02:41:45.425]  Do you take pills?
[02:41:45.425 --> 02:41:45.925]  What is it?
[02:41:45.925 --> 02:41:47.985]  I just take whey.
[02:41:47.985 --> 02:41:48.425]  And soy?
[02:41:48.425 --> 02:41:49.526]  I don't take soy.
[02:41:49.526 --> 02:41:58.588]  Do you think President Trump should do something to hold Facebook and Instagram and YouTube accountable for their censorship and kind of discrimination against conservatives?
[02:41:58.588 --> 02:42:00.449]  No, not really.
[02:42:00.449 --> 02:42:00.789]  Why would he?
[02:42:02.301 --> 02:42:06.602]  Because they're a monopoly on our free speech and how we internet with the world and everything.
[02:42:06.602 --> 02:42:07.742]  I don't know, they be tripping.
[02:42:07.742 --> 02:42:08.763]  I don't know what's up with them.
[02:42:08.763 --> 02:42:11.423]  Facebook just recently did a massive purge.
[02:42:11.423 --> 02:42:15.404]  They took Alex Jones, Laura Loomer, Milo Yiannopoulos, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:42:15.404 --> 02:42:17.465]  I'm kind of biased.
[02:42:17.465 --> 02:42:19.245]  What's biased about them?
[02:42:19.245 --> 02:42:20.225]  I really don't know.
[02:42:20.225 --> 02:42:20.945]  We're going to break.
[02:42:20.945 --> 02:42:24.966]  And when we come back, we'll get to the really dramatic conclusion of your phone calls.
[02:42:24.966 --> 02:42:27.187]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:42:27.187 --> 02:42:29.948]  These people are incredibly stupid.
[02:42:29.948 --> 02:42:31.128]  They're incredibly arrogant.
[02:42:32.378 --> 02:42:39.203]  They're shallow, and they have no sense of chivalry, but overall, they're evil.
[02:42:39.203 --> 02:42:42.506]  They inherently want to dominate and silence others.
[02:42:42.506 --> 02:42:45.008]  Because wait, it's coming up.
[02:42:45.008 --> 02:42:51.773]  She hasn't gotten to the clips where all these people say outrageous things and get crazy looks in their eyes of power.
[02:42:55.485 --> 02:43:00.071]  Stacey in the great state of Texas in FEMA Region 6.
[02:43:00.071 --> 02:43:02.113]  You're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[02:43:02.113 --> 02:43:03.195]  Good to talk to you.
[02:43:03.195 --> 02:43:07.840]  Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:09.782]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[02:43:09.782 --> 02:43:14.328]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that, that I trust.
[02:43:14.608 --> 02:43:20.594]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[02:43:20.594 --> 02:43:21.294]  I appreciate that.
[02:43:21.294 --> 02:43:22.976]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[02:43:22.976 --> 02:43:23.516]  Tell us about it.
[02:43:23.516 --> 02:43:24.337]  Well, it's really great.
[02:43:24.337 --> 02:43:26.159]  You know, it's like a multivitamin, I take it.
[02:43:26.159 --> 02:43:26.899]  It tastes good.
[02:43:26.899 --> 02:43:28.741]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[02:43:28.741 --> 02:43:30.703]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[02:43:30.703 --> 02:43:34.186]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[02:43:34.206 --> 02:43:37.029]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[02:43:37.029 --> 02:43:38.790]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[02:43:38.790 --> 02:43:40.872]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[02:43:40.872 --> 02:43:41.793]  So, yeah.
[02:43:41.793 --> 02:43:44.236]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[02:43:44.236 --> 02:43:47.058]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[02:43:47.058 --> 02:43:48.199]  So I'm glad you plugged it.

[02:43:59.960 --> 02:44:08.526]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[02:44:08.526 --> 02:44:11.509]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:44:11.509 --> 02:44:13.250]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:44:13.250 --> 02:44:19.535]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[02:44:33.823 --> 02:44:37.805]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[02:44:37.805 --> 02:44:39.626]  I've got two in my home.

[02:44:45.729 --> 02:44:46.570]  Don't live

[02:44:51.453 --> 02:44:52.714]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.

[02:45:27.233 --> 02:45:28.914]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[02:45:28.914 --> 02:45:31.755]  And we decided, I like Secret 12 Plus.
[02:45:31.755 --> 02:45:34.816]  But they said, look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[02:45:34.816 --> 02:45:35.577]  Just call it Ultra 12.
[02:45:35.577 --> 02:45:36.377]  Well, you know what?
[02:45:36.377 --> 02:45:37.617]  I don't like how the label's printed.
[02:45:37.617 --> 02:45:39.598]  And it just so happens it had already been labeled with the other one.
[02:45:39.598 --> 02:45:40.558]  We decided to change the name.
[02:45:40.558 --> 02:45:41.779]  So when you peel off the label,
[02:45:43.007 --> 02:45:46.708]  Underneath it, it's Secret 12+.
[02:45:46.708 --> 02:45:49.509]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[02:45:49.509 --> 02:45:51.409]  Better than Secret 12 ever was.

[02:46:58.647 --> 02:47:01.236]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:25.450 --> 02:47:26.891]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:47:26.891 --> 02:47:29.753]  I'm gonna take some of your phone calls here in about five minutes.
[02:47:29.753 --> 02:47:34.456]  Got some callers like Sean and Morgan we gotta get to, so stay with us.
[02:47:34.456 --> 02:47:35.497]  And Matt Brackett's taking over.
[02:47:35.497 --> 02:47:55.090]  But let's finish up with Caitlin Bennett, journalist, reporter, politely, at Kent State, her alma mater, where she graduated a year ago, being openly demonized and told that she needs to be taken off the air as well, and anybody else that disagrees with the establishment or likes Donald Trump, here is the dangerous fascism that has become America.
[02:47:55.450 --> 02:47:56.511]  Oh really?
[02:47:56.511 --> 02:48:09.182]  So Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, Paul Joseph Watson, Alex Jones, InfoWars and an organization in general has been completely censored off of Twitter, off of Instagram, off of Facebook.
[02:48:09.182 --> 02:48:11.784]  Facebook and Instagram said that they were dangerous.
[02:48:11.784 --> 02:48:13.146]  Have you ever heard of any of those people?
[02:48:13.146 --> 02:48:16.168]  I have not.
[02:48:16.168 --> 02:48:17.790]  You've never heard of Milo Yiannopoulos?
[02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:20.232]  I have not.
[02:48:20.232 --> 02:48:21.293]  Alex Jones, InfoWars.
[02:48:23.115 --> 02:48:23.836]  I have not.
[02:48:23.836 --> 02:48:26.018]  Okay, well, they're being censored because they're conservatives.
[02:48:26.018 --> 02:48:28.400]  Does that bother you?
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:28.881]  I have not.
[02:48:28.881 --> 02:48:29.642]  No, I'm kidding.
[02:48:29.642 --> 02:48:31.203]  It doesn't because I don't really know them that well.
[02:48:31.203 --> 02:48:36.448]  Well, it's pretty complicated to me because, you know, it's all predicated on hate speech.
[02:48:36.448 --> 02:48:38.711]  What is hate speech?
[02:48:38.711 --> 02:48:44.777]  Well, from my understanding, I thought it was inciting violence through, you know, speech.
[02:48:46.479 --> 02:48:47.761]  Well, that's inciting violence.
[02:48:47.761 --> 02:48:49.243]  That's something completely different.
[02:48:49.243 --> 02:48:52.509]  There is no legal definition of hate speech.
[02:48:52.509 --> 02:48:56.876]  So it's really kind of subjective to ban somebody based on hate speech.
[02:48:56.876 --> 02:48:59.159]  Could you give me an example of what hate speech would be?
[02:49:00.534 --> 02:49:01.775]  Mmm, probably not then.
[02:49:01.775 --> 02:49:03.295]  No, I don't think I could.
[02:49:03.295 --> 02:49:09.017]  So they banned Alex Jones, InfoWars, Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopoulos, and Flora Loomer.
[02:49:09.017 --> 02:49:09.237]  Four?
[02:49:09.237 --> 02:49:11.398]  Like, why did they ban them?
[02:49:11.398 --> 02:49:12.598]  They said that they're dangerous.
[02:49:12.598 --> 02:49:15.119]  They're prominent conservatives all over social media.
[02:49:15.119 --> 02:49:17.479]  What are they speaking on in their banning?
[02:49:17.479 --> 02:49:19.120]  They just said that they're dangerous individuals.
[02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:24.563]  Do you know what they're posting on social media, why they're banning them?
[02:49:24.563 --> 02:49:27.686]  They have support of President Trump.
[02:49:27.686 --> 02:49:30.408]  I'm asking if it bothers you that they are being banned.
[02:49:30.408 --> 02:49:33.791]  That's why I'm asking for a better background so I can give a better opinion on it.
[02:49:33.791 --> 02:49:38.015]  So Laura Loomer, she's a conservative Jewish woman, big supporter of President Trump.
[02:49:38.815 --> 02:49:39.916]  Uh, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:49:39.916 --> 02:49:41.377]  He lives actually in the UK.
[02:49:41.377 --> 02:49:43.038]  He's a big supporter of President Trump as well.
[02:49:43.038 --> 02:49:44.439]  He's affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:49:44.439 --> 02:49:47.400]  Um, Alex Jones is the owner of InfoWars.
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:54.525]  And then there's Milo Yiannopoulos who has been protested on campuses where they almost burned down the entire campus because they don't like his speech.
[02:49:56.013 --> 02:50:00.056]  At what point do we say we can't censor people based on their political ideologies?
[02:50:00.056 --> 02:50:01.057]  Well, you can't.
[02:50:01.057 --> 02:50:04.019]  But you can also take into consideration other people's opinions.
[02:50:04.019 --> 02:50:08.443]  And I can tell you one thing, the millennial group of people is growing, and most millennials don't f*** with Donald Trump.
[02:50:08.443 --> 02:50:10.244]  So, that's probably why.
[02:50:10.244 --> 02:50:14.287]  So, do you support Trump supporters getting banned off social media if they have a big following?
[02:50:14.287 --> 02:50:18.330]  Support, non-support, have no idea who you were talking about before, probably gonna have no idea once we leave again.
[02:50:18.330 --> 02:50:24.375]  But I'm just letting you know now, most people don't f*** with people who are on that, uh... Then why did he win?
[02:50:25.868 --> 02:50:27.489]  Do you see the news?
[02:50:27.489 --> 02:50:30.109]  If a lot of people... Russia!
[02:50:30.109 --> 02:50:31.010]  Russia!
[02:50:31.010 --> 02:50:31.670]  Like, come on.
[02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:32.470]  How would you know that?
[02:50:32.470 --> 02:50:34.051]  Yeah, so you're talking about the news.
[02:50:34.051 --> 02:50:35.991]  You get your news from Instagram, you said.
[02:50:35.991 --> 02:50:37.392]  Twitter, Instagram, most news.
[02:50:37.392 --> 02:50:38.572]  I personally don't watch news.
[02:50:38.572 --> 02:50:40.193]  I mean, I'm sure most millennials don't.
[02:50:40.193 --> 02:50:41.153]  I don't know if you guys watch news.
[02:50:41.153 --> 02:50:42.013]  If you do, that's great.
[02:50:42.013 --> 02:50:43.834]  But I just, I don't watch the news.
[02:50:43.834 --> 02:50:48.916]  And based on that information, you said you don't watch the news, but you still think that Russiagate is real.
[02:50:48.916 --> 02:50:49.636]  Russia what?
[02:50:49.636 --> 02:50:50.616]  Russiagate.
[02:50:50.616 --> 02:50:51.597]  Yeah, for sure.
[02:50:51.597 --> 02:50:54.978]  I'm all for standing up for what you believe in as long as you're not an a**hole about it.
[02:50:56.437 --> 02:50:59.239]  So what is deemed as a f***hole?
[02:50:59.239 --> 02:51:01.000]  I don't know, whatever you stand for.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.482]  So everybody like me should be censored?
[02:51:03.482 --> 02:51:04.763]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:51:04.763 --> 02:51:09.246]  That's very tolerant, very empowering to other women, so I do appreciate that.
[02:51:09.246 --> 02:51:13.709]  Do you consider yourself a feminist?
[02:51:13.709 --> 02:51:16.771]  Define feminist in your terms before I agree to that.
[02:51:16.771 --> 02:51:18.212]  What is a feminist?
[02:51:18.212 --> 02:51:22.916]  You believe in equal rights for men and women and you support women, you lift them up?
[02:51:22.916 --> 02:51:24.637]  Yeah.
[02:51:24.637 --> 02:51:25.838]  But you support me being censored?
[02:51:26.584 --> 02:51:28.289]  Yeah.
[02:51:28.289 --> 02:51:30.697]  Alright, we got some cognitive dissonance right here.
[02:51:37.990 --> 02:51:44.934]  Not only is InfoWars being banned on social media, but conservatives everywhere are being shunned in person as well.
[02:51:44.934 --> 02:51:51.097]  Please, I'm urging you, you have to go to InfoWarsStore.com, buy a t-shirt, get some supplements, make sure!
[02:51:51.097 --> 02:51:52.278]  I can keep doing this.
[02:51:52.278 --> 02:51:57.381]  You ever heard about the conservatives being just completely deplatformed, not allowed to have a voice on Facebook?
[02:51:57.381 --> 02:51:58.781]  No, I'm sorry.
[02:51:58.781 --> 02:52:00.282]  Well, now that I told you, does it scare you?
[02:52:00.282 --> 02:52:02.684]  I don't really care, to be honest.
[02:52:02.684 --> 02:52:03.224]  Amen.
[02:52:03.224 --> 02:52:04.525]  Very cool.
[02:52:04.525 --> 02:52:04.985]  Very cool.
[02:52:08.832 --> 02:52:10.472]  These are the people that are voting.
[02:52:10.472 --> 02:52:15.894]  These are the people that have to make decisions about our taxes, about our guns, about our property.
[02:52:15.894 --> 02:52:19.935]  And they don't know who's giving them their information, who's controlling it.
[02:52:19.935 --> 02:52:23.596]  Can you think of one person off the top of your head who should be censored next?
[02:52:23.596 --> 02:52:31.318]  Of course I can think of people who should be censored, but... Name one.
[02:52:31.318 --> 02:52:31.678]  I think...
[02:52:34.056 --> 02:52:36.497]  Like, anti-LGBT people?
[02:52:36.497 --> 02:52:39.958]  I can't think of any, like, big figure that should be censored right now.
[02:52:39.958 --> 02:52:42.099]  I mean, Donald Trump always, but that's just because I don't like him.
[02:52:42.099 --> 02:52:44.900]  You want the president censored off?
[02:52:44.900 --> 02:52:47.401]  Throw him away, in total.
[02:52:47.401 --> 02:52:48.481]  That's my opinion.
[02:52:48.481 --> 02:53:01.605]  But, um, again, also using your platform, social media, Twitter especially, to say mean things, hurtful things, or just shady things, as he likes to do, I don't think is A, professional, but B, not presidential at all.
[02:53:01.605 --> 02:53:03.186]  What's a shady thing that he's said?
[02:53:03.766 --> 02:53:05.566]  Oof, I just had a lot of shakes.
[02:53:05.566 --> 02:53:08.967]  I don't have a Twitter either, but I get most of my information from Instagram.
[02:53:08.967 --> 02:53:11.427]  It's the only social media I really use.
[02:53:11.427 --> 02:53:17.789]  Because Instagram's banning conservatives too, so if that's where you're getting your information from, does that concern you?
[02:53:17.789 --> 02:53:22.689]  Um, I mean... You were chanting, like, f*** Caitlin Bennett.
[02:53:22.689 --> 02:53:27.330]  Would you not think that that is hateful and you should be censored for doing that?
[02:53:27.330 --> 02:53:28.511]  Um, f*** Caitlin Bennett.
[02:53:28.511 --> 02:53:29.291]  Okay.
[02:53:29.291 --> 02:53:30.911]  So should you be censored for that hate speech?
[02:53:31.843 --> 02:53:32.804]  Does it hurt your feelings?
[02:53:32.804 --> 02:53:33.485]  No, it doesn't.
[02:53:33.485 --> 02:53:41.514]  I think this is great, because you're... Again, they've taught them that if something hurts somebody's feelings, you'll get to have free speech.
[02:53:41.514 --> 02:53:46.619]  But then she plays all these bizarre games, and again, she looks completely mentally ill.
[02:53:46.619 --> 02:53:49.222]  Like she could be in Natural Born Killers or something, as a psychotic.
[02:53:50.219 --> 02:54:03.327]  But really it's just a spoiled brat, probably never worked a day in her life, just wandering around some college where she's not learning anything but how it's her right to rule and America is now hers, as long as you silence people.
[02:54:03.327 --> 02:54:11.932]  And so little, soft, stupid authoritarians wandering around colleges.
[02:54:11.932 --> 02:54:14.613]  And then they go out, you think, well, where are they going to get a job?
[02:54:14.613 --> 02:54:18.536]  Big tech, city government, state government, county government, bureaucrats.
[02:54:20.128 --> 02:54:23.530]  And they all just sit back and laugh about their power over you.
[02:54:23.530 --> 02:54:25.792]  And they're going to take your farm.
[02:54:25.792 --> 02:54:27.633]  They're going to take your business.
[02:54:27.633 --> 02:54:28.934]  They're going to take your children.
[02:54:28.934 --> 02:54:30.656]  They're going to take your money.
[02:54:30.656 --> 02:54:32.097]  They're going to take your guns.
[02:54:32.097 --> 02:54:33.678]  They're going to take your speech.
[02:54:33.678 --> 02:54:38.601]  They're going to take your birthright because you're going to bow to them.
[02:54:38.601 --> 02:54:43.665]  You're going to be afraid of them because they're so weak and pathetic and laughing at themselves.
[02:54:43.665 --> 02:54:47.308]  They can't believe that they're nobodies, but that everyone bows to them.
[02:54:49.070 --> 02:54:51.711]  They're dishonorable scum.
[02:54:51.711 --> 02:54:55.552]  They're dangerous scum.
[02:54:55.552 --> 02:54:56.372]  They're the plague.
[02:54:56.372 --> 02:54:58.673]  They're cancer.
[02:54:58.673 --> 02:55:06.595]  But we have put up with them as soft people, just trying to make everything nice, everybody friendly.
[02:55:06.595 --> 02:55:14.077]  And now these giant, maliced armies of idiots are ready to make their move on us.
[02:55:14.077 --> 02:55:16.858]  They're the last generation of humans before the machines take over.
[02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:20.034]  This is how the AI takes over.
[02:55:20.034 --> 02:55:23.261]  Creating that creature on screen.
[02:55:23.261 --> 02:55:23.642]  Continue.
[02:55:29.876 --> 02:55:34.157]  I just don't define hateful, ugly people as strong, independent women.
[02:55:34.157 --> 02:55:38.458]  And so, therefore, I feel like I'm entitled to whatever I say to you.
[02:55:38.458 --> 02:55:40.978]  But you... This doesn't count as hate speech.
[02:55:40.978 --> 02:55:41.678]  Back it up 10 seconds.
[02:55:41.678 --> 02:55:43.638]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see this.
[02:55:43.638 --> 02:55:46.499]  She does this ecstasy thing, and she goes, I don't define it.
[02:55:46.499 --> 02:55:50.640]  She goes... See, she's a god now.
[02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:57.261]  So, Caitlyn's using her own anti-female, wedded-to-the-government, third-wave feminism argument on her.
[02:55:58.174 --> 02:56:01.597]  And then she says, I don't define ugly, hateful people.
[02:56:01.597 --> 02:56:05.560]  When she's being ugly and hateful, I don't define them as reality.
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:11.125]  Just like the governor of Virginia doesn't define a newborn baby as alive, so he cuts their organs out.
[02:56:11.125 --> 02:56:15.008]  Now the mother want the baby, we resuscitate.
[02:56:15.008 --> 02:56:17.010]  That's a legal term, the baby's alive.
[02:56:17.010 --> 02:56:18.632]  We decide it alive.
[02:56:19.329 --> 02:56:20.849]  Did we kill?
[02:56:20.849 --> 02:56:22.590]  We get the organs.
[02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:24.270]  We get the blood.
[02:56:24.270 --> 02:56:26.650]  We get the skin.
[02:56:26.650 --> 02:56:29.571]  You see how it works?
[02:56:29.571 --> 02:56:31.531]  And you look at her.
[02:56:31.531 --> 02:56:32.732]  Soft.
[02:56:32.732 --> 02:56:34.052]  Dead-eyed.
[02:56:34.052 --> 02:56:35.652]  Stupid.
[02:56:35.652 --> 02:56:40.753]  Only when she's saying, I'm taking someone's rights, is there a little light in her eyes.
[02:56:40.753 --> 02:56:44.114]  You see how it works?
[02:56:44.114 --> 02:56:45.094]  Oh, you see?
[02:56:45.094 --> 02:56:48.195]  Let's go back to the zombie production.
[02:56:49.537 --> 02:56:50.738]  Factory that is Kent State.
[02:57:13.004 --> 02:57:19.509]  Ugly people as strong, independent women, and so therefore I feel like I'm entitled to whatever I say to you.
[02:57:19.509 --> 02:57:23.392]  But you, this doesn't count as hate speech, but the things I do is hate speech.
[02:57:24.508 --> 02:57:25.429]  Yeah.
[02:57:25.429 --> 02:57:29.674]  And that is like, you know, that's pretty much that's hate speech.
[02:57:29.674 --> 02:57:30.796]  What is hate speech?
[02:57:30.796 --> 02:57:38.525]  Hate speech is defined as like stuff like, you know, making like subtle dog whistles and like, you know, remarks.
[02:57:38.525 --> 02:57:41.208]  Anything you say he says is a hate speech.
[02:57:41.208 --> 02:57:43.370]  We'll be back with your phone calls hour number four.

[02:58:52.194 --> 02:58:55.137]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:58:55.137 --> 02:58:59.201]  With InfoWars Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patreon supply.
[02:59:00.771 --> 02:59:09.916]  Most respected companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[02:59:09.916 --> 02:59:15.258]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storable food, so it's a total win-win.
[02:59:15.258 --> 02:59:17.540]  We have those incredible self-rices back.
[02:59:17.540 --> 02:59:21.041]  InfoWarsTore.com on InfoWars select storable foods.
[02:59:21.041 --> 02:59:22.542]  They've got special diet foods.
[02:59:22.542 --> 02:59:26.524]  They've got three-month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[02:59:26.524 --> 02:59:28.725]  They've got so many great products there.
[02:59:28.725 --> 02:59:29.826]  Maybe you've got a three-year supply.
[02:59:30.286 --> 02:59:32.267]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[02:59:32.267 --> 02:59:34.808]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[02:59:34.808 --> 02:59:39.811]  You're buying War Bonds, bringing you great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[02:59:39.811 --> 02:59:49.616]  InfoWareStore.com and InfoWare Select, high-quality, storable foods powered by my Patriot Supply.
[02:59:49.616 --> 02:59:52.297]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.494 --> 03:00:14.415]  All right, I'm going to do two segments.
[03:00:14.415 --> 03:00:18.777]  I'm going to go to your calls, Morgan and Roland and Liberty Dog and others that are holding.
[03:00:18.777 --> 03:00:22.399]  I'm going to try to jam everybody in this segment next, and then Matt Brackett's taking over.
[03:00:22.399 --> 03:00:24.220]  I'll have to do the whole Facebook thing tomorrow.
[03:00:24.220 --> 03:00:27.542]  It's a 24-page article, and I want to spend like an hour on it.
[03:00:27.542 --> 03:00:29.263]  So I meant to get to it, but I didn't.
[03:00:29.263 --> 03:00:33.025]  But Connor, one of our great sound guys in there, he just graduated five years ago.
[03:00:34.025 --> 03:00:35.346]  From Texas State.
[03:00:35.346 --> 03:00:36.607]  Formerly Southwest Texas.
[03:00:36.607 --> 03:00:38.568]  That's LBJ's alma mater.
[03:00:38.568 --> 03:00:39.689]  Down in San Marcos, Texas.
[03:00:39.689 --> 03:00:41.410]  South of Austin.
[03:00:41.410 --> 03:00:43.912]  And they actually have courses there about banning free speech.
[03:00:43.912 --> 03:00:46.573]  The journalism classes are now about ending free speech.
[03:00:46.573 --> 03:00:48.715]  That's one of my good friend's daughters has graduated from there.
[03:00:48.715 --> 03:00:51.577]  And they were actually in the course teaching that I'm a Nazi.
[03:00:51.577 --> 03:00:52.738]  I'm evil.
[03:00:52.738 --> 03:00:55.319]  That the job of journalists is to ban free speech.
[03:00:55.319 --> 03:00:56.400]  So you ask how this happened.
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:58.962]  The curriculum flipped the last six, seven years.
[03:00:58.962 --> 03:00:59.802]  Nationwide.
[03:00:59.802 --> 03:01:01.383]  Europe already did it ten years ago.
[03:01:01.383 --> 03:01:03.305]  To they're taught destroy free speech.
[03:01:03.925 --> 03:01:07.727]  You see Oliver Darcy and CNN and all of them, that's their job.
[03:01:07.727 --> 03:01:15.291]  But we played a clip earlier where pro-lifers are being attacked all over the country just recently at free speech zones.
[03:01:15.291 --> 03:01:26.897]  And Connor saw one part at the end of the video, we'll try to play in the background while he talks about it, where that's the free speech zone, you know, the speaker's corner of the university where these pro-lifers were attacked.
[03:01:26.897 --> 03:01:29.038]  So you're just saying it's upside down world.
[03:01:34.810 --> 03:01:36.971]  There we go, that sounds much better.
[03:01:36.971 --> 03:01:40.572]  So, kind of one thing I noticed about this clip as it was rolling here.
[03:01:40.572 --> 03:01:42.693]  Yeah, this exact part right here you're seeing.
[03:01:42.693 --> 03:01:44.614]  So, I went to school at Texas State.
[03:01:44.614 --> 03:01:52.557]  Owen goes down there, he does a bunch of stuff down at the university, and that exact spot is known as a free speech zone.
[03:01:52.557 --> 03:01:56.499]  The irony I saw in this clip, I mean, look at this!
[03:01:56.499 --> 03:01:59.880]  This is a free speech zone and this guy's just going over here and just
[03:02:00.080 --> 03:02:02.141]  Knocking down every pro-life sign.
[03:02:02.141 --> 03:02:08.945]  I've even seen that exact old-timer there who goes out and sets up these pro-life events out here.
[03:02:08.945 --> 03:02:10.746]  He comes out twice a semester.
[03:02:10.746 --> 03:02:12.307]  He's generally a pretty nice guy.
[03:02:12.307 --> 03:02:20.632]  And what I was saying to you during the break was when I was going to school there, I did not see this type of behavior from students exhibited while I was going to school there.
[03:02:20.632 --> 03:02:26.776]  And I said to you during the break, how did this happen so fast within five years since I graduated?
[03:02:26.776 --> 03:02:28.237]  This stuff is everywhere.
[03:02:28.237 --> 03:02:29.458]  Just remember like last year?
[03:02:29.878 --> 03:02:34.121]  When that one student wrote the article about how all white people were the scorn of the earth.
[03:02:34.121 --> 03:02:35.121]  You remember that?
[03:02:35.121 --> 03:02:40.124]  And that was allowed to be published in a student newspaper that made it national headlines.
[03:02:40.124 --> 03:02:40.745]  And that was Texas State.
[03:02:40.745 --> 03:02:41.445]  That was Texas State.
[03:02:41.445 --> 03:02:42.826]  That was Texas State that wrote that.
[03:02:42.826 --> 03:02:45.428]  In front of the paper saying whites are inherently evil.
[03:02:46.658 --> 03:02:47.199]  Exactly.
[03:02:47.199 --> 03:02:56.887]  And so after watching that piece from Caitlin Bennett, and then seeing, it reminded me of this footage that we watched earlier from the man destroying all the signs.
[03:02:56.887 --> 03:03:02.211]  It just started to hit, I just couldn't contain myself and think, how is this now
[03:03:02.972 --> 03:03:06.954]  Being a, becoming a universal mindset to students at all these colleges.
[03:03:06.954 --> 03:03:12.417]  Like, how did this, again, it just goes back to my initial question of how did this happen so fast?
[03:03:12.417 --> 03:03:16.258]  And that's kind of where I'm just left and at a loss for words, Alex.
[03:03:16.258 --> 03:03:18.419]  So, it's sad and disappointing.
[03:03:18.419 --> 03:03:19.760]  Well, you heard the girl say it earlier.
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:24.402]  She goes, I am entitled to shut, you know, say that you should be shut down.
[03:03:24.402 --> 03:03:25.443]  I am entitled.
[03:03:25.443 --> 03:03:27.644]  I am of the supreme group.
[03:03:27.644 --> 03:03:28.624]  I am in control.
[03:03:28.624 --> 03:03:29.485]  I am downtrodden.
[03:03:30.285 --> 03:03:36.531]  And so now, look, the Communist Chinese are openly funding Hollywood, Netflix, to demoralize the country.
[03:03:36.531 --> 03:03:37.512]  They admit that.
[03:03:37.512 --> 03:03:39.954]  And so a lot of it's the movies, the funding.
[03:03:39.954 --> 03:03:43.497]  These guys believe they're doing the holy work.
[03:03:43.497 --> 03:03:45.639]  And, you know, it's time for me to go down to Texas State.
[03:03:46.733 --> 03:03:51.597]  As well, Owen went down there after they had it on the cover of the paper that whites are inherently evil.
[03:03:51.597 --> 03:03:54.899]  I mean, this is just unbelievable garbage.
[03:03:54.899 --> 03:03:55.980]  But this is who the left are.
[03:03:55.980 --> 03:03:56.641]  Thank you, Connor.
[03:03:56.641 --> 03:03:57.021]  You're welcome.
[03:03:57.021 --> 03:03:58.402]  I just want to say one more thing, though.
[03:03:58.402 --> 03:04:00.423]  They are aware of who you are down there, Alex.
[03:04:00.423 --> 03:04:01.924]  They're very well aware of your image.
[03:04:01.924 --> 03:04:07.849]  And I do see lots of InfoWars stickers plastered around just the town, San Marcos, that Texas State resides within.
[03:04:07.849 --> 03:04:10.691]  But I recently started seeing this girl.
[03:04:10.691 --> 03:04:14.714]  And when she found out that I worked for you, I mean, she had had a
[03:04:16.095 --> 03:04:18.357]  She didn't have a lot of nice things to say at first.
[03:04:18.357 --> 03:04:22.079]  So, it should turn out to be a pretty interesting relationship.
[03:04:22.079 --> 03:04:23.800]  Anyhow, back to you.
[03:04:23.800 --> 03:04:24.561]  Back to you.
[03:04:24.561 --> 03:04:28.324]  Yeah, no, I mean, these are not pro-American people.
[03:04:28.324 --> 03:04:29.965]  These are authoritarians.
[03:04:29.965 --> 03:04:31.346]  They believe they're in the ruling class.
[03:04:33.052 --> 03:04:35.813]  They grew up on Hollywood and said they taught them to hate America.
[03:04:35.813 --> 03:04:36.813]  They weren't taught chivalry.
[03:04:36.813 --> 03:04:38.694]  They weren't taught common sense.
[03:04:38.694 --> 03:04:41.035]  And now they believe it's their time to rule.
[03:04:41.035 --> 03:04:45.076]  And those of us that don't submit to them are the enemy.
[03:04:45.076 --> 03:04:46.557]  Thanks for our audience of activists.
[03:04:46.557 --> 03:04:47.677]  We're on the march.
[03:04:47.677 --> 03:04:49.037]  The empire's on the run.
[03:04:49.037 --> 03:04:50.278]  Back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:50.278 --> 03:04:51.418]  And I'm going right to your calls.
[03:04:51.418 --> 03:04:51.738]  Bam!
[03:04:51.738 --> 03:04:52.259]  Bam!
[03:04:52.259 --> 03:04:52.539]  Bam!
[03:04:54.212 --> 03:04:57.677]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:04:57.677 --> 03:05:01.462]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:05:01.462 --> 03:05:07.730]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:07.730 --> 03:05:10.514]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:05:11.235 --> 03:05:15.059]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.059 --> 03:05:21.525]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.525 --> 03:05:26.489]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.230 --> 03:05:31.174]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:05:31.174 --> 03:05:38.360]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:43.064]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:05:43.064 --> 03:05:49.289]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.289 --> 03:05:53.253]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:05:57.575 --> 03:06:03.788]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:37.484 --> 03:06:49.496]  So, you're always growing up here, back when that was still taught, that most nations are really abusive, they're really authoritarian.
[03:07:01.021 --> 03:07:11.243]  Then mobs of dumb people get together, and they take over like thugs, there's no due process, and they ban people's speech, and society collapses.
[03:07:11.243 --> 03:07:14.664]  But the people that do it are so stupid, they don't care.
[03:07:14.664 --> 03:07:17.944]  Like Venezuela, their leadership.
[03:07:17.944 --> 03:07:21.545]  And now it's here in America in 2019, it's getting worse.
[03:07:21.545 --> 03:07:23.426]  And we have to stop letting the left bully us.
[03:07:25.998 --> 03:07:40.374]  And we have to put heat on Trump and our legislatures to stand up against these authoritarian bastards like the universities and other places that are now globalist command bases, not centers of learning and openness and real dialogue.
[03:07:40.374 --> 03:07:43.598]  Okay, Morgan in Dakota, then Roland and others.
[03:07:43.598 --> 03:07:45.360]  Morgan, thanks for holding in North Dakota.
[03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:45.801]  You're on the air.
[03:07:47.259 --> 03:07:49.240]  Hi Alex, Morgan, North Dakota.
[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:51.141]  Hello to my native truthers out there.
[03:07:51.141 --> 03:07:54.582]  I know there's not many out there, but we're out here, Alex.
[03:07:54.582 --> 03:07:55.342]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[03:07:55.342 --> 03:07:56.883]  What's on your mind?
[03:07:56.883 --> 03:08:01.485]  Well, what's on my mind is I think it's funny how I've been listening to you for years and years and years.
[03:08:01.485 --> 03:08:06.667]  And just recently, everybody's now saying, oh, you just listen to Alex Jones.
[03:08:06.667 --> 03:08:09.768]  You just listen to Alex Jones all the time.
[03:08:09.768 --> 03:08:12.269]  And I'm like, oh, Alex is one of them.
[03:08:12.884 --> 03:08:17.165]  You know, that's just one of many that we should all be listening to.
[03:08:17.165 --> 03:08:21.406]  But of course, it's creating a bigger divide, which, and I see it happening.
[03:08:21.406 --> 03:08:27.988]  I mean, little Indian reservations all over America, surrounded by, you know, by white people, of course.
[03:08:27.988 --> 03:08:30.089]  But it's creating a divide.
[03:08:30.089 --> 03:08:32.389]  And I think that needs to be addressed.
[03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:34.590]  And Trump definitely needs to
[03:08:35.603 --> 03:08:44.308]  Try to get a hold of some more native votes because I'm almost the only single person that supports them in my entire town.
[03:08:44.308 --> 03:08:50.992]  I totally agree and everybody should just come together against globalism because it's what's attacking us all.
[03:08:50.992 --> 03:09:00.417]  It doesn't matter if you're Native American, it doesn't matter if you're black, white, you're being targeted by the tainted vaccines, you're being targeted by fluoride, you're being targeted by Facebook, you're being targeted by AI.
[03:09:00.417 --> 03:09:04.720]  This whole anti-human system is here and humans must unite against it.
[03:09:06.104 --> 03:09:14.632]  Yep, even here where I work, I work for the Road Maintenance Department, and now we gotta all start using, start putting our data into an app.
[03:09:14.632 --> 03:09:26.102]  And we're gonna have to carry an app around, you know, basically give them the data that we do every day, all day, and they advise us to get a Google account, of course.
[03:09:26.102 --> 03:09:30.246]  And then all you're really doing is training a robot driverless car to take your job soon.
[03:09:32.356 --> 03:09:43.387]  And of course, everybody, I've been learning about blue beam and stuff like that, and everybody thinks it's going to be some hallucinogenic thing in the sky, but it's really just a way to feel things without humans.
[03:09:45.103 --> 03:09:47.244]  You know, and yeah, I do see driverless.
[03:09:47.244 --> 03:09:52.825]  I don't know about driverless commercial trucks like on X-Men, but definitely our jobs are... Sir, it's here.
[03:09:52.825 --> 03:09:53.385]  It's here.
[03:09:53.385 --> 03:09:55.166]  The plan is to totally replace humans.
[03:09:55.166 --> 03:09:56.366]  Go to an airport.
[03:09:56.366 --> 03:09:57.847]  Everything's robot kiosk.
[03:09:57.847 --> 03:10:00.807]  Everything's being replaced to make us obsolete.
[03:10:00.807 --> 03:10:02.768]  I noticed you called in saying your son has autism.
[03:10:02.768 --> 03:10:04.669]  You want to talk about that?
[03:10:04.669 --> 03:10:13.071]  Well, yeah, but not only does he have autism, I'm in a custody battle right now with mom, but I also watch my girlfriend's nephew who has cerebral palsy.
[03:10:13.835 --> 03:10:17.556]  And he definitely has autism, but it's not diagnosed.
[03:10:17.556 --> 03:10:21.217]  And he is almost the exact spitting image of my son.
[03:10:21.217 --> 03:10:24.278]  Everything about him is the same, and they're nonverbal.
[03:10:24.278 --> 03:10:29.060]  They're in that spectrum where nonverbal at all, got the droopy eyes.
[03:10:29.060 --> 03:10:41.384]  And I heard about a 30-year-old man that learned to type as autistic, and it's really a mental prison in their head, where they can type, they know what we're saying, and they want to say something back, but they can't.
[03:10:42.276 --> 03:10:49.058]  And that's definitely... It's demonic and it's evil and they're putting viruses and other things in the vaccines that target certain areas of the brain.
[03:10:49.058 --> 03:11:06.241]  So again, the conscious and the subconscious get cut off and exactly, it is apt from what I've heard, it's just total torture what these young boys and then become men are put into and they're just battling, frustrated, trying to communicate with you and the system knows full damn well what they're doing.
[03:11:06.241 --> 03:11:08.982]  They're taking out our men ahead of the AI takedown.
[03:11:09.702 --> 03:11:17.709]  This is all, in my research, extraterrestrial, through the AI, with collaborator humans, to take over the planet, like the Bible says.
[03:11:17.709 --> 03:11:20.891]  I don't get into UFOs and lizard people and stuff you can't prove.
[03:11:20.891 --> 03:11:31.100]  The globalists believe they're communicating with interdimensional forces that have given them a blueprint for immortality, and they are carrying it out judiciously to take us out.
[03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:31.881]  And that's it!
[03:11:31.881 --> 03:11:33.722]  So, remember that.
[03:11:33.722 --> 03:11:35.043]  Folks, thank you.
[03:11:35.043 --> 03:11:35.844]  Collar.
[03:11:35.844 --> 03:11:37.305]  Morgan.
[03:11:37.305 --> 03:11:37.726]  Roland.
[03:11:38.667 --> 03:11:40.869]  Roland of Kansas, you're on the air.
[03:11:40.869 --> 03:11:42.031]  Thanks for holding.
[03:11:42.031 --> 03:11:42.911]  Thank you.
[03:11:42.911 --> 03:11:45.694]  Thanks for everything that you do.
[03:11:45.694 --> 03:11:50.579]  This is in two parts, and it has to do with social media and the impact.
[03:11:50.579 --> 03:11:54.143]  Earlier, somebody mentioned MyLife.com.
[03:11:54.143 --> 03:12:00.309]  Now, this is something that you could really get into to expose, because this is one evil extortion outfit on the Internet.
[03:12:00.859 --> 03:12:10.625]  What they do, they have evidently the software to data mine the internet to find out information about anybody that they can find out, whatever they can get.
[03:12:10.625 --> 03:12:12.446]  And then they put it together.
[03:12:12.446 --> 03:12:13.926]  Now, it could be incorrect.
[03:12:13.926 --> 03:12:16.128]  It may be correct.
[03:12:16.128 --> 03:12:18.629]  Then they have a file for you.
[03:12:18.629 --> 03:12:26.774]  And so anybody that happens to look up and accidentally come across you might find out that 30 years ago you were arrested not knowing what the charge was.
[03:12:26.774 --> 03:12:29.015]  It could have been false and, you know, totally dropped.
[03:12:29.767 --> 03:12:32.670]  But, it makes it look like you're some kind of criminal.
[03:12:32.670 --> 03:12:36.933]  The same thing would be true of lawsuits.
[03:12:36.933 --> 03:12:42.238]  And so, a person that would be applying for a job may not even know about this being out there.
[03:12:42.238 --> 03:12:49.064]  And the person that may want to hire them would then see it, and then not even want to talk to the person, or even consider hiring them.
[03:12:49.064 --> 03:12:52.687]  Now the scam is this, is that once you see that, and you want to correct it,
[03:12:53.174 --> 03:12:56.056]  Well, then you have to buy a membership, and I think it's like $29.
[03:12:56.056 --> 03:12:58.357]  Well, of course, that's the scam.
[03:12:58.357 --> 03:13:08.264]  They take things out there, a lot of it is info, magnify it and make it look the worst it possibly can, so you call them to clean it up, and really all they do is change your account.
[03:13:08.264 --> 03:13:12.627]  Yeah, and not only that, they've got your debit or credit card number, and they don't do the $29, they do $60 or $90 or $95.
[03:13:12.627 --> 03:13:13.807]  And the state of California fined them $800,000.
[03:13:20.277 --> 03:13:32.246]  And, uh, you can look up, there's at least three websites that have a list of the complainers and the people that got scammed and the troubles they had on trying to get, uh, stopped anymore, uh, debiting of their account.
[03:13:32.246 --> 03:13:37.850]  Uh, there is a YouTube video, uh, on how to cancel yourself out, and they have to remove it.
[03:13:37.850 --> 03:13:46.577]  And, uh, the guy actually charges people, he says he's made, charges people money to, uh, get them removed, but he gives you the information on how you can do it for yourself.
[03:13:47.527 --> 03:13:53.611]  The second part is the small business impact of Facebook and Instagram.
[03:13:53.611 --> 03:14:02.316]  If it's completely chopped up, there are many, many small businesses that are trying to get started by using Facebook and Instagram.
[03:14:02.316 --> 03:14:12.422]  And Shopify.com has got a pretty slick setup for setting up a website and then being linked with Facebook and Instagram.
[03:14:13.513 --> 03:14:20.778]  And if it's all messed up the way it is right now, there'll be a lot of people impacted that are making a living.
[03:14:20.778 --> 03:14:24.740]  So it seems like cutting it up into pieces may not be the answer.
[03:14:24.740 --> 03:14:30.244]  But there needs to be some sort of accountability on the part of Facebook, and probably even Instagram.
[03:14:31.282 --> 03:14:35.423]  On how they are cutting off anybody that has a conservative attitude.
[03:14:35.423 --> 03:14:42.025]  I designed myself a t-shirt company with a lot of comedy and politically incorrect stuff.
[03:14:42.025 --> 03:14:51.128]  And I'm sitting back here wondering, once I start moving this on Instagram, am I going to get blocked or shadow banned by both Facebook and Instagram before I can hardly even get started?
[03:14:51.952 --> 03:14:58.216]  So, I think that there's got to be some congressional action that takes place.
[03:14:58.216 --> 03:15:07.561]  Oh, there absolutely has to be, because Congress's inaction, again, creates a vacuum for China, the EU, and others to come in with their regulations.
[03:15:07.561 --> 03:15:09.742]  The left and Warren have their total takeover plan.
[03:15:09.742 --> 03:15:11.663]  That's just to have them totally control it.
[03:15:11.663 --> 03:15:14.125]  We need to have the Internet Bill of Rights.
[03:15:14.125 --> 03:15:14.845]  We need to have a debate about it.
[03:15:14.845 --> 03:15:16.006]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:16.006 --> 03:15:17.086]  Great call, Roland.
[03:15:17.086 --> 03:15:19.848]  Alright, Sean, Wayne, Liberty Dog, and Tim.

[03:15:30.143 --> 03:15:30.543]  Call back.

[03:16:54.088 --> 03:16:58.009]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.

[03:19:57.143 --> 03:20:16.689]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.689 --> 03:20:19.050]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:19.050 --> 03:20:22.911]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:20:27.288 --> 03:20:31.230]  Okay, you've got me for the rest of the hour.
[03:20:31.230 --> 03:20:43.655]  And I've been watching the show and following it, especially interested in those interviews in the college with the students, basically, that are down with censorship.
[03:20:43.655 --> 03:20:55.260]  They're completely cool with banning people from social media for shutting down conservative thoughts, and it's pretty obvious that they're being brainwashed in their classrooms.
[03:20:56.394 --> 03:21:05.217]  And it's obvious that brainwashing works, at least to that extent, the ones that are willing to walk up to a camera and confront, you know, confront on this issue.
[03:21:05.217 --> 03:21:10.958]  But I have seen some glimmers of hope that maybe there's a backlash forming.
[03:21:10.958 --> 03:21:18.240]  You know, my daughter, who's just out of college, she's as conservative as they come.
[03:21:18.240 --> 03:21:21.101]  College didn't affect her to tilt her leftward.
[03:21:21.101 --> 03:21:23.042]  If anything, her friends are
[03:21:24.835 --> 03:21:27.656]  are reacting against that political correctness.
[03:21:27.656 --> 03:21:30.497]  They can't stand their PC professors.
[03:21:30.497 --> 03:21:36.299]  And they're, um, I think they're falling into the conservative side very strongly.
[03:21:36.299 --> 03:21:40.040]  The conservative libertarian side.
[03:21:40.040 --> 03:21:50.303]  I think that a news item that I saw in the last day was at this high school in Colorado, the Highlands Ranch STEM School.
[03:21:51.926 --> 03:22:00.928]  The students actually walked out when a couple of politicians tried to turn a memorial for the hero Kendrick Castillo.
[03:22:00.928 --> 03:22:05.868]  They tried to turn his memorial into a gun control political rally.
[03:22:05.868 --> 03:22:13.950]  And they not only walked out, and they were chanting about needing mental health, not gun control.
[03:22:13.950 --> 03:22:20.511]  And mental health could go a long way towards explaining that one, that two shooters were
[03:22:21.471 --> 03:22:23.232]  To my way of thinking, pretty wacko.
[03:22:23.232 --> 03:22:30.918]  The main shooter, the 18-year-old, had, uh, you know, F Society spray-painted on his car.
[03:22:30.918 --> 03:22:41.947]  Kind of a scream that he was, uh, sort of a psychotic, antisocial individual, but here he is in school, you know, with the pink hair, screaming, look at me.
[03:22:41.947 --> 03:22:50.013]  Well, he got his attention, but he didn't get the body count he was hoping for, because Kendrick Castillo tackled him.
[03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:52.921]  And died in the process.
[03:22:52.921 --> 03:23:02.467]  And by doing so, he bought time for other students to rush the guy and then for security to arrive.
[03:23:02.467 --> 03:23:05.969]  So the victim was the hero.
[03:23:05.969 --> 03:23:10.912]  And I think that we would do well to remember the names of these heroes.
[03:23:10.912 --> 03:23:16.416]  There was the old woman at the synagogue in California that jumped in the path of a bullet.
[03:23:16.416 --> 03:23:20.218]  And then there was at UNC Charlotte, Riley Howell.
[03:23:21.321 --> 03:23:26.023]  Uh, who also, you know, rushed a shooter, took him out.
[03:23:26.023 --> 03:23:29.444]  I would compare it to the, um, you know, on the day of 9-11.
[03:23:29.444 --> 03:23:37.807]  The, uh, was it flight 93 that they knew that they were going to be, you know, used in a suicide mission.
[03:23:37.807 --> 03:23:42.369]  So they decided to, to, um, rush the cockpit no matter what the cost.
[03:23:42.369 --> 03:23:48.751]  And that's an important thing for society to, to realize, you know, we can't just hide under our desks.
[03:23:49.591 --> 03:23:52.232]  Or, you know, lock doors and hide.
[03:23:52.232 --> 03:23:58.956]  Somebody, you know, when the gun comes out, somebody, the closest guys, they've got to just, they've just got to go for it.
[03:23:58.956 --> 03:24:01.837]  And it's not the first time that it's happened.
[03:24:01.837 --> 03:24:06.059]  It's happened occasionally throughout the history of these mass shootings.
[03:24:06.059 --> 03:24:11.422]  But, you know, that's the only solution is for these guys to know there won't be any big body count.
[03:24:11.422 --> 03:24:12.542]  And you won't be remembered.
[03:24:12.542 --> 03:24:15.864]  You'll just be forgotten as another psycho loser.
[03:24:16.778 --> 03:24:39.703]  But, you know, my prayers and thoughts definitely go out to the families of these heroes, particularly these young men with everything in front of them, their entire world, their entire lives, you know, laid out in front of them and snuffed out, but by doing so, saving the lives of possibly, you know, dozens of their friends.
[03:24:39.703 --> 03:24:46.404]  So, you know, God bless Riley and Kendrick, two great American heroes.
[03:24:47.694 --> 03:25:04.828]  And it does show that not everybody is an NPC, you know, robot, brainwashed zombie, like what we tend to think of the Millennials maybe too much as.
[03:25:04.828 --> 03:25:12.053]  And certainly it's disturbing when you see so many Millennials that are embracing their own tyranny.
[03:25:12.053 --> 03:25:15.116]  They're actually rejecting freedom.
[03:25:15.808 --> 03:25:19.771]  They're rejecting their own survival instinct.
[03:25:19.771 --> 03:25:23.854]  It goes to the power of brainwashing.
[03:25:23.854 --> 03:25:35.002]  Brainwashing can be so powerful that in a cult setting, people will kill themselves like in Jonestown or the Doomsday Cult that was waiting for the asteroid.
[03:25:35.002 --> 03:25:37.824]  I forget what that one was out in California.
[03:25:37.824 --> 03:25:39.906]  They all took pills and died.
[03:25:41.069 --> 03:25:43.191]  That's the power of brainwashing.
[03:25:43.191 --> 03:25:47.174]  And it can work on a huge societal scale, too.
[03:25:47.174 --> 03:25:56.461]  But the brainwashing of many may actually be an awakening for many others that are following them.
[03:25:56.461 --> 03:26:09.311]  And while we're seeing social media trying to crack down and clamp down and ban conservative ideas, ban people like Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, myself,
[03:26:10.695 --> 03:26:18.537]  What they're doing, I think, is having an unintended consequence, because it's making political correctness uncool.
[03:26:18.537 --> 03:26:30.259]  That's why the Pepe the Clown meme, I think, is so effective, because if they try to ban the clown meme, what does that say about political correctness?
[03:26:30.259 --> 03:26:31.720]  That they can't take a joke.
[03:26:31.720 --> 03:26:33.680]  They literally cannot take a joke.
[03:26:34.235 --> 03:26:39.917]  They have to look for, you know, hidden symbolism, like the OK sign.
[03:26:39.917 --> 03:26:50.820]  They have to try to control and enforce their rigid political correctness to the extent that nobody's allowed to laugh, nobody's allowed to mock.
[03:26:50.820 --> 03:26:52.660]  Sarcasm is banned.
[03:26:52.660 --> 03:27:03.523]  Well, when you do this and you tell teenagers that they can't have a good time and can't use sarcasm, that's not a way to recruit people to the politically correct left-wing cause.
[03:27:04.275 --> 03:27:10.478]  In fact, that's the way to make the left completely uncool and repellent to youth.
[03:27:10.478 --> 03:27:19.802]  So I hope that there is an actual unintended consequence in here, and I'm really looking for a millennial backlash.
[03:27:19.802 --> 03:27:24.424]  It's important to understand where political correctness comes from in the first place.
[03:27:24.424 --> 03:27:27.485]  What is the basis of political correctness?
[03:27:33.405 --> 03:27:39.827]  Political correctness is a tool that the left uses to avoid criticism.
[03:27:39.827 --> 03:27:53.650]  Any criticism of the bad consequences of leftist propaganda and ideology, any criticism of it is branded as hate speech and shut down.
[03:27:53.650 --> 03:27:58.111]  People are put off of social media, people have even lost their jobs because of
[03:27:59.901 --> 03:28:07.805]  Basically, counterattacking against left-wing ideology, and then being branded as haters.
[03:28:07.805 --> 03:28:11.427]  That's why I think that the clown meme is so effective.
[03:28:11.427 --> 03:28:14.509]  Because, how can you ban laughter?
[03:28:14.509 --> 03:28:19.912]  How can you ban, you know, a clown with a colorful, uh, you know, colorful wig?
[03:28:19.912 --> 03:28:21.613]  Even if it's Pepe the Frog.
[03:28:21.613 --> 03:28:25.115]  It just makes the left look like fatalitarian idiots.
[03:28:25.115 --> 03:28:27.336]  You know, which is exactly what they are.
[03:28:27.336 --> 03:28:29.097]  And, I have, I have, um,
[03:28:30.234 --> 03:28:35.180]  A lot of concern for the next generation that I'll get to in the next segment.
[03:28:35.180 --> 03:28:46.111]  Maybe there are a lot of brainwashed NPCs signing up for oblivion, but maybe there is a rising new generation that will be actively seeking freedom.
[03:28:46.111 --> 03:28:49.455]  And we'll be back after the break and talk more about this.
[03:28:53.109 --> 03:28:55.332]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.332 --> 03:28:56.613]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:28:56.613 --> 03:28:57.494]  Hey, whatcha doing?

[03:31:54.192 --> 03:32:07.622]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most suppressed.
[03:32:07.622 --> 03:32:18.670]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:32:19.958 --> 03:32:21.882]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:21.882 --> 03:32:24.568]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:32:25.947 --> 03:32:30.249]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:32:30.249 --> 03:32:34.512]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:32:34.512 --> 03:32:36.793]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:32:36.793 --> 03:32:39.115]  This country is in a war!
[03:32:39.115 --> 03:32:49.801]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:49.801 --> 03:32:53.403]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands, InfoWarsStore.com, thank you!
[03:32:57.106 --> 03:32:59.722]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.041 --> 03:33:20.725]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:20.725 --> 03:33:24.168]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:33:24.168 --> 03:33:27.171]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:27.171 --> 03:33:36.059]  We're going to slightly switch gears, but we'll bring it back around to social media.
[03:33:36.059 --> 03:33:39.903]  You know, I've been saying for probably a year now that
[03:33:40.515 --> 03:33:47.620]  President Trump wasn't going to declassify the deep state coup material until after the Mueller report was out.
[03:33:47.620 --> 03:33:53.044]  That it was a kind of a poker game and you want to have the last, you want to put down the last hand.
[03:33:53.044 --> 03:33:55.686]  And, and I think that that's what we're now seeing.
[03:33:55.686 --> 03:34:07.135]  So what Congress is doing, which really is clown world, when you look at people like, like, you know, Nadler and Swalwell, Pelosi,
[03:34:08.644 --> 03:34:11.006]  They think that they're being effective.
[03:34:11.006 --> 03:34:18.452]  They think that this contempt citation against Attorney General Barr is going to get them traction.
[03:34:18.452 --> 03:34:24.997]  But it shows that they're really just living in their own echo chamber, their own bubble.
[03:34:24.997 --> 03:34:29.301]  Of course, Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon are going to think it's great.
[03:34:29.301 --> 03:34:34.165]  But Americans, I think, are looking at them as total clowns now.
[03:34:34.165 --> 03:34:35.726]  Americans get it.
[03:34:35.726 --> 03:34:38.048]  This is the exact same cast of clowns
[03:34:38.752 --> 03:34:50.998]  That went against Kavanaugh, that were, you know, giving credibility to these charges that he was leading a gang rape ring, you know, as a high school kid.
[03:34:50.998 --> 03:34:52.499]  And that didn't work.
[03:34:52.499 --> 03:34:54.860]  Kavanaugh was confirmed.
[03:34:54.860 --> 03:34:57.661]  And I don't think that they're going to get any traction here.
[03:34:57.661 --> 03:35:03.924]  And what it's showing America is that they're desperate because the hammer is going to come down.
[03:35:04.935 --> 03:35:31.732]  And when it comes down, the Democrats are going to have to either defect from the Russia narrative, which is unlikely, or continue to double down on stupid, just going further and further into a diminishing, like a hall of mirrors that just gets smaller and smaller in the end, until it eventually just goes poof and is gone.
[03:35:31.732 --> 03:35:32.092]  Because
[03:35:33.007 --> 03:35:40.191]  The big guns, the real ammunition, is about to get poured out and fired at the Democrats.
[03:35:40.191 --> 03:35:48.575]  You know, the Inspector General report, even the Huber report, this guy, the Salt Lake City U.S.
[03:35:48.575 --> 03:35:55.259]  Attorney, he's been out there, way out in left field in Salt Lake City, but people have been going out and talking to them.
[03:35:55.259 --> 03:36:02.283]  And I have to think that some of the principles at the level of Nellie Orr, Bruce Orr, Strzok and Page,
[03:36:03.220 --> 03:36:21.967]  They're not going to go to prison on perjury charges, you know, that they're giving testimony now, and risk going to prison on very tough perjury charges when their truthful testimony is going to be, I was following orders.
[03:36:21.967 --> 03:36:26.509]  And the orders go right to the White House, to the Obama White House.
[03:36:26.509 --> 03:36:32.311]  Eventually, it's going to be, I think, Obama and his White House circle
[03:36:33.050 --> 03:36:35.490]  And John Brennan.
[03:36:35.490 --> 03:36:45.752]  Comey may fall on his sword, but even Comey, I think, eventually is going to say, I thought this was legitimate intelligence that came over from the CIA.
[03:36:45.752 --> 03:36:50.493]  I thought that the Russia stuff was real and that the investigation was real.
[03:36:50.493 --> 03:36:55.074]  It's pretty unbelievable, but Comey may stick with that story.
[03:36:55.074 --> 03:37:02.215]  But other than Comey and Brennan and the Obama White House, I think everybody's going to wind up flipping.
[03:37:02.899 --> 03:37:05.740]  And saying that they were just following orders.
[03:37:05.740 --> 03:37:10.863]  Because clearly the Papadopoulos timeline is falling apart.
[03:37:10.863 --> 03:37:29.611]  If Joseph Mifsud is shown to be an FBI and CIA and State Department asset going back for years, then everything that follows from the FISA application, everything will be the fruit of the poison tree.
[03:37:29.611 --> 03:37:31.632]  And the entire thing is going to blow up.
[03:37:32.401 --> 03:37:33.682]  I think Hannity had it best.
[03:37:33.682 --> 03:37:37.405]  He calls it Operation Crossfire Boomerang.
[03:37:37.405 --> 03:37:38.886]  And that's what's going to happen.
[03:37:38.886 --> 03:37:43.670]  I see Trump winning very big in 2020.
[03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:58.182]  If the economy somehow manages to hold together and there's nothing else that the Democrats have to throw at him, all of the Russia narrative is going to have a boomerang effect.
[03:37:59.016 --> 03:38:08.742]  And if, you know, hopefully, if the Republicans, not that I'm a big Republican fan, but the alternative is, is the Democratic Socialists.
[03:38:08.742 --> 03:38:19.069]  If there is a Democrat Congress in 2020, we may finally get a chance to secure the border as well as can be done in this era.
[03:38:19.069 --> 03:38:27.795]  But this, this then, if this, if the projections are that Trump is going to probably cruise to a re-election victory,
[03:38:28.732 --> 03:38:49.665]  I don't think that the danger is past because the people at the top of the deep state coup who are facing prison, men in their 60s facing prison and disgrace, I think that some of them will be willing to go for a kinetic operation to take out Trump.
[03:38:49.665 --> 03:38:52.667]  And I'm not saying that there will be anything put in orders.
[03:38:53.795 --> 03:39:02.338]  But it'll be more in the similar to the, you know, who will rid me of this meddlesome priest?
[03:39:02.338 --> 03:39:21.586]  You know, the Beckett story, where it won't be a memo, nothing in writing, no meetings of more than two people, but at the highest levels of the deep state coup and the entrenched deep state bureaucracy, people are going to be thinking, we have got to get rid of Trump.
[03:39:22.313 --> 03:39:26.256]  And by get rid of, I mean take him out.
[03:39:26.256 --> 03:39:38.566]  And that would include potentially allowing an assassin to get close to him, corrupt Secret Service people.
[03:39:38.566 --> 03:39:45.111]  I'm not saying that all Secret Service are suspect, but there have been a lot of them fired.
[03:39:45.111 --> 03:39:48.574]  Remember Obama brought in a lot of social justice worrier types.
[03:39:49.261 --> 03:39:55.205]  And put them at the very top of the bureaucracies, the federal bureaucracies, including the Secret Service.
[03:39:55.205 --> 03:39:58.667]  We remember their scandals during the Obama regime.
[03:39:58.667 --> 03:40:06.811]  There's a lot of corrupt and dirty cops at the top of federal law enforcement because that's who Obama brought in.
[03:40:06.811 --> 03:40:10.193]  Guys like Brennan, Clapper, and Comey.
[03:40:10.193 --> 03:40:14.436]  They're infesting, you know, the entire federal law enforcement bureaucracy now.
[03:40:15.342 --> 03:40:23.544]  And some of them, I think, would be willing to kind of open the gate to a kinetic solution to Donald Trump.
[03:40:23.544 --> 03:40:30.125]  So I do fear for his personal safety greatly going forward.
[03:40:30.125 --> 03:40:41.387]  I hope that the Secret Service immediately around him are way on their game because as the legal net closes around the coup plotters,
[03:40:42.338 --> 03:40:45.220]  They're not going to just quietly go off to prison.
[03:40:45.220 --> 03:40:47.762]  They're going to be more and more desperate.
[03:40:47.762 --> 03:41:04.172]  And people like John Brennan, who voted for a communist in 1976, when the Soviets were still putting people in gulags and psychiatric hospitals where they were chemically lobotomized, that's who he voted for.
[03:41:04.172 --> 03:41:09.556]  These guys don't really see a problem with communist tactics.
[03:41:09.556 --> 03:41:11.157]  The ends justify the means.
[03:41:11.909 --> 03:41:22.531]  And they see Trump as an existential threat to all of the what they consider progress towards globalism, which is their holy grail.
[03:41:22.531 --> 03:41:31.412]  That's why Comey called his book a higher loyalty, meaning a higher loyalty than to the Constitution and to the United States of America.
[03:41:31.412 --> 03:41:41.054]  Well, they see their entire plot possibly unraveling with a successful Trump second terms and a Republican Congress.
[03:41:41.983 --> 03:41:43.965]  You know, Paul Ryan is gone.
[03:41:43.965 --> 03:41:50.730]  Imagine a Republican Congress with somebody like Jim Jordan running the show.
[03:41:50.730 --> 03:41:55.374]  This, to them, is an absolute existential nightmare.
[03:41:55.374 --> 03:41:59.478]  And they will in no way just ride smoothly through it.
[03:41:59.478 --> 03:42:05.082]  They can't depend on saying that Trump stole the election in 2020.
[03:42:05.082 --> 03:42:09.186]  That plan for 2016 to discredit the election, it didn't work.
[03:42:09.773 --> 03:42:10.814]  It failed.
[03:42:10.814 --> 03:42:15.057]  They were willing to do a deep state coup plot and it failed.
[03:42:15.057 --> 03:42:19.821]  So they can't count on rigging the vote in 2020.
[03:42:19.821 --> 03:42:25.686]  They can't count on calling it a fraudulent election.
[03:42:25.686 --> 03:42:32.451]  So they are preparing themselves for a second Trump administration with a GOP Congress and Senate.
[03:42:33.206 --> 03:42:36.128]  And that is a nightmare scenario for them.
[03:42:36.128 --> 03:42:46.216]  And there are people on their side who will stop at nothing, including fomenting an economic crash, assassination plots, you name it.
[03:42:46.216 --> 03:42:48.318]  Nothing is off the table.
[03:42:48.318 --> 03:42:51.621]  When we come back, maybe we'll pick up some phone calls if...
[03:42:53.285 --> 03:42:55.607]  Fueling your body is hard work.

[03:44:54.201 --> 03:44:56.383]  Stacy in the great state of Texas.
[03:44:57.518 --> 03:45:00.601]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:45:13.311 --> 03:45:19.278]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:45:19.278 --> 03:45:19.998]  I appreciate that.
[03:45:19.998 --> 03:45:21.660]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:45:21.660 --> 03:45:22.261]  Tell us about it.
[03:45:22.261 --> 03:45:23.042]  Well, it's really great.
[03:45:23.042 --> 03:45:24.843]  You know, it's like a multivitamin, I take it.
[03:45:24.843 --> 03:45:25.584]  It tastes good.
[03:45:25.584 --> 03:45:27.446]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:45:27.446 --> 03:45:29.388]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:45:29.388 --> 03:45:32.872]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:45:32.892 --> 03:45:35.713]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:45:35.713 --> 03:45:37.474]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:45:37.474 --> 03:45:39.555]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:45:39.555 --> 03:45:40.476]  So, yeah.
[03:45:40.476 --> 03:45:42.917]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:45:42.917 --> 03:45:45.738]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[03:45:45.738 --> 03:45:46.879]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:45:46.879 --> 03:45:48.720]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:45:54.321 --> 03:46:01.085]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[03:46:01.085 --> 03:46:04.748]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[03:46:04.748 --> 03:46:09.070]  But I'll tell you like it is, you've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:10.551]  You're our only sponsors.
[03:46:10.551 --> 03:46:17.036]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.

[03:46:19.517 --> 03:46:20.518]  I'm not the leader.
[03:46:20.518 --> 03:46:21.319]  You are the leader.
[03:46:21.319 --> 03:46:23.300]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[03:46:23.300 --> 03:46:28.705]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfoWareStore.com that are unprecedented.

[03:47:13.906 --> 03:47:20.728]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:20.728 --> 03:47:26.530]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:47:26.530 --> 03:47:32.432]  Yeah, last segment, and I did want to mention I have a new book coming out in a couple of weeks.
[03:47:32.432 --> 03:47:37.494]  It's going to be in print and an e-book on Kindle.
[03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:44.965]  Called the Bracken Collection, which is my short stories and some essays from the last decade.
[03:47:44.965 --> 03:47:52.971]  And I would recommend going forward to get some books like this in the Dead Tree format.
[03:47:52.971 --> 03:47:58.295]  Something that, you know, we're all aware that people are being banned from social media.
[03:47:58.295 --> 03:48:06.802]  Tommy Robinson, one of his books was actually taken off of Amazon because, you know, the professional Muslim grievance groups
[03:48:07.634 --> 03:48:12.217]  Thought that it shouldn't be there, so Amazon cooperated and took it down.
[03:48:12.217 --> 03:48:22.664]  You can find Mein Kampf and you can find all kind of literature like that on Amazon, but you can't find Tommy Robinson's book called Muhammad's Quran.
[03:48:22.664 --> 03:48:26.066]  It's a factual, true book.
[03:48:26.066 --> 03:48:27.747]  You can't find it.
[03:48:27.747 --> 03:48:34.411]  Well, not only can they take books off of Amazon, they can make it big tech and now make it so that
[03:48:35.123 --> 03:48:39.624]  They can delete things that you think that you've saved somewhere in the ether.
[03:48:39.624 --> 03:48:49.607]  If you don't have it locked into your hard drive in a secure location or in a printed format, they can take things away.
[03:48:49.607 --> 03:48:59.771]  Kindle has had books deleted years later after being published because of copyright disputes or people making the case that
[03:49:02.125 --> 03:49:07.009]  Some literature bordered on kiddie porn, Lolita type fiction.
[03:49:07.009 --> 03:49:10.812]  And you think you have a book on your Kindle and zap, it's gone.
[03:49:10.812 --> 03:49:30.769]  So if Trump doesn't win, if something happens where we get a President Buttigieg or Kamala Harris or even a Biden, you can expect the hate crime laws just to go into orbit as a means of shutting down conservative speech.
[03:49:31.508 --> 03:49:54.198]  And that's going to be, I think, a backdoor way for them to attack conservative literature, fiction and non-fiction, which would include just zapping them right off your device, you know, as an evil, hateful, you know, violence-producing form of entertainment.
[03:49:54.198 --> 03:49:59.200]  So I would recommend that you get books by folks like me.
[03:49:59.952 --> 03:50:01.573]  Put it on Kindle, that's fine.
[03:50:01.573 --> 03:50:05.154]  But remember, what's on Kindle can be taken away from Kindle.
[03:50:05.154 --> 03:50:10.196]  And if you have the printed book, at least you're going to have it forever.
[03:50:10.196 --> 03:50:12.377]  And you can share it with your friends.
[03:50:12.377 --> 03:50:16.218]  It can't be removed by social media.
[03:50:16.218 --> 03:50:26.722]  In the New Zealand mosque shooting, people have been arrested in New Zealand just for attempting to find that video, the Facebook video.
[03:50:26.722 --> 03:50:29.183]  The guy put it, the guy streamed it on Facebook,
[03:50:29.875 --> 03:50:33.017]  Millions of people saw it, but now it's a crime.
[03:50:33.017 --> 03:50:37.280]  You can't even possess his manifesto in New Zealand.
[03:50:37.280 --> 03:50:47.448]  And we have the First Amendment, theoretically, but if the Democrats come to power, eventually, we're going to see drastic curtailments on it.
[03:50:47.448 --> 03:50:51.330]  This is just something I see in the future.
[03:50:51.330 --> 03:50:55.053]  I know I've got bookshelves just too full.
[03:50:55.053 --> 03:50:57.835]  I can't jam in any more printed books, but
[03:50:58.425 --> 03:51:00.926]  In some cases, it might be a good idea.
[03:51:00.926 --> 03:51:03.107]  You know, it might be a good idea.
[03:51:03.107 --> 03:51:12.051]  Now, this is kind of, you know, people are looking at me and saying, look at that old boomer talking about printed books.
[03:51:12.051 --> 03:51:13.051]  That's so yesterday.
[03:51:13.051 --> 03:51:15.032]  That's so 20th century.
[03:51:15.032 --> 03:51:17.193]  We live in an electronic world.
[03:51:17.193 --> 03:51:18.513]  And that's fine.
[03:51:18.513 --> 03:51:22.055]  But you guys, you know, that aren't being younger than boomers, you better remember
[03:51:22.802 --> 03:51:25.884]  The digital world doesn't really exist.
[03:51:25.884 --> 03:51:26.864]  It's virtual.
[03:51:26.864 --> 03:51:29.206]  The cloud is virtual.
[03:51:29.206 --> 03:51:40.292]  The cloud can go poof during some kind of an electronic attack, cyber attack, or a tyrannical government can just delete things.
[03:51:40.292 --> 03:51:43.734]  Not only delete things, but charge you for possessing them.
[03:51:43.734 --> 03:51:49.938]  So when you think about a printed book, think of it as an insurance policy against future deletion.
[03:51:49.938 --> 03:51:51.639]  You know, this is
[03:51:52.967 --> 03:52:05.582]  Speaking about younger people and their reliance on the screens, especially the youngest kids that have had cell phones and computers since the day they were born.
[03:52:05.582 --> 03:52:08.565]  They can't imagine another world.
[03:52:08.565 --> 03:52:11.709]  They are effectively being brainwashed from the cradle.
[03:52:13.135 --> 03:52:28.288]  You know, the messaging that's going out, not just the political messaging, but the consumer messaging and so forth, and just the belief authority messaging that's going out, you know, the conformism messaging that's going out.
[03:52:28.288 --> 03:52:33.173]  This is probably the most effective form of brainwashing that's ever existed.
[03:52:33.880 --> 03:52:39.445]  People like Hitler, Mao, and Stalin never had the tools that exist today.
[03:52:39.445 --> 03:52:52.836]  All they could do is put up billboards and posters on walls, leaflets, Pravda-type newspapers, radio, and maybe one television channel.
[03:52:52.836 --> 03:53:02.744]  That is nothing compared to what kids have now, which is a device that will entertain them from day one.
[03:53:03.331 --> 03:53:13.498]  But you have to remember that the messages that are coming out of all of the screens have been designed to keep you buying, to keep you watching.
[03:53:13.498 --> 03:53:24.405]  You know, billion dollar companies pay millionaires, geniuses, they pay geniuses millions of dollars to addict kids to that screen.
[03:53:24.405 --> 03:53:28.668]  And that's bad enough, but as a result,
[03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:32.651]  Young people are not getting outside.
[03:53:32.651 --> 03:53:34.192]  They're not going camping.
[03:53:34.192 --> 03:53:35.873]  They're not going fishing or hunting.
[03:53:35.873 --> 03:53:46.357]  They're not ever learning what it is to hike in the woods because all of their waking time is spent staring inside of a screen.
[03:53:46.357 --> 03:53:51.679]  And that brain development time can't be recaptured.
[03:53:51.679 --> 03:53:55.081]  Once the brain is developed through the teen years into young adulthood,
[03:53:55.640 --> 03:54:06.032]  You can't go back then and say, now let's do the hiking in the woods and smelling the flowers and digging the dirt with our hands.
[03:54:06.032 --> 03:54:06.733]  That's gone.
[03:54:06.733 --> 03:54:15.784]  The rising generation potentially is going to be so susceptible to programming and being brainwashed
[03:54:16.405 --> 03:54:25.228]  Because all of their neurological development was to wait for the next message and to follow the instruction on the screen.
[03:54:25.228 --> 03:54:26.408]  Click here.
[03:54:26.408 --> 03:54:29.029]  Turn right in a hundred yards.
[03:54:29.029 --> 03:54:37.811]  Don't figure out how to actually get around a city or get around the woods on your own, learning to navigate in the real world.
[03:54:37.811 --> 03:54:41.012]  It's just stare at a screen and wait for the next message.
[03:54:41.012 --> 03:54:43.873]  Click from the choices that are offered to you.
[03:54:44.756 --> 03:54:49.521]  And the people that designed those choices, they've programmed the decision tree.
[03:54:49.521 --> 03:54:50.843]  They know what you're going to pick.
[03:54:50.843 --> 03:54:53.145]  They've tilted the field.
[03:54:53.145 --> 03:55:02.095]  So, if there is a tyranny that comes in this country, I would say that the majority of people will
[03:55:02.958 --> 03:55:07.740]  Be wholly in line with it, because the tyranny won't be presented in an Orwellian fashion.
[03:55:07.740 --> 03:55:12.903]  It'll be presented in a false, free choice situation.
[03:55:12.903 --> 03:55:19.046]  Look, I've got five choices here, but all five choices were designed for you.
[03:55:19.046 --> 03:55:28.210]  So my plea is to shut off the screens, get outside, go for a run, ride a bike,
[03:55:28.980 --> 03:55:32.281]  Ask somebody if they know where, how to go camping.
[03:55:32.281 --> 03:55:39.244]  I mean, there are so many people today have never spent a night in the woods in their life and don't want to.
[03:55:39.244 --> 03:55:52.068]  They can't imagine life outside of an air-conditioned bubble, outside of, you know, being surrounded by computer screens, plugs in the ears, living in a virtual world.
[03:55:52.068 --> 03:55:56.910]  Well, the virtual world is going to steer you towards eventually
[03:55:57.920 --> 03:56:13.091]  A real cliff in terms of any kind of emerging form of tyranny, which is probably going to be where the humans are replaced with artificially intelligent robots.
[03:56:13.091 --> 03:56:16.013]  We're just going to be like the sheep on the sheep farm.
[03:56:16.013 --> 03:56:22.118]  There won't be a need for drivers, there won't be a need for people stocking shelves or doing warehouse work.
[03:56:22.955 --> 03:56:31.397]  There will be very little for humans, and what will be the place for us actual humans?
[03:56:31.397 --> 03:56:33.377]  What will be left for us?
[03:56:33.377 --> 03:56:36.078]  What happens to sheep on a sheep farm?
[03:56:36.078 --> 03:56:46.200]  They might be fed and watered regularly, but eventually somebody just makes a decision, open that door and stick them in that warehouse and you never see them again.
[03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:50.521]  So anyway, what a gloomy way to end the show.
[03:56:50.521 --> 03:56:51.981]  But my plea is,
[03:56:52.782 --> 03:57:08.873]  Get outside, live in the real world, breathe the air, ride a bike, shoot a gun, you know, get a fishing rod and catch a fish, go canoeing, do anything, but get outside.
[03:57:08.873 --> 03:57:16.998]  And I've been told that I might be on every Thursday from now on, fourth hour or so.
[03:57:16.998 --> 03:57:17.879]  We'll see how it goes.
[03:57:20.840 --> 03:57:23.861]  I've got some personal things going on.
[03:57:23.861 --> 03:57:26.002]  I might not have been totally prepared today.
[03:57:26.002 --> 03:57:29.644]  I hope you can put up with me.
[03:57:29.644 --> 03:57:33.346]  We'll see you next week in the same slot.
[03:57:33.346 --> 03:57:38.348]  Maybe we'll have better news as the hammer comes down on the Deep State 2 plotters.
[03:57:38.348 --> 03:57:40.269]  I've been waiting for that for a long time.
[03:57:42.970 --> 03:57:44.011]  You like Secret 12?
[03:57:44.011 --> 03:57:46.613]  This is Secret 12, but twice as strong.
[03:57:46.613 --> 03:57:48.194]  So I called it Ultra 12.
[03:57:48.194 --> 03:57:49.294]  Most expensive.
[03:57:49.294 --> 03:57:50.335]  Vitamin B12.
[03:57:50.335 --> 03:57:51.316]  Methylcobalamin.
[03:57:51.316 --> 03:57:53.037]  And you put it under your tongue for about a minute.
[03:57:53.037 --> 03:57:55.318]  And the longer you can do it, the better.
[03:57:55.318 --> 03:57:58.140]  B12, just like clean iodine, is essential.
[03:57:58.140 --> 03:57:58.861]  Just like oxygen.
[03:57:58.861 --> 03:57:59.621]  Just like water.
[03:57:59.621 --> 03:58:00.982]  The point is, it's amazing.
[03:58:00.982 --> 03:58:01.563]  You need it.
[03:58:01.563 --> 03:58:02.283]  It's awesome.
[03:58:02.283 --> 03:58:04.084]  And it's the absolute go-to.
[03:58:04.084 --> 03:58:05.225]  By the way, it tastes super sweet.
[03:58:05.225 --> 03:58:07.527]  So get your X2 in a free bottle of X3 right now.
[03:58:07.847 --> 03:58:08.888]  We're good to go.
[03:58:28.038 --> 03:58:29.419]  Secret 12 now!
[03:58:29.419 --> 03:58:31.339]  Ultra 12 double strong.
[03:58:31.339 --> 03:58:32.560]  The highest quality.
[03:58:32.560 --> 03:58:33.060]  That's right.
[03:58:33.060 --> 03:58:34.581]  Fearless and double tough.
[03:58:34.581 --> 03:58:35.481]  Ultra 12.
[03:58:35.481 --> 03:58:36.982]  Advance vitamin B12.
[03:58:36.982 --> 03:58:42.204]  The ultimate formula at InfoWarsLife.com and fund the second American revolution.
