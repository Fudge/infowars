[00:00.000 --> 00:09.600]  We're live May 9th, 2019.
[00:09.600 --> 00:14.520]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:14.520 --> 00:17.680]  Alex Jones is a new category.
[00:17.680 --> 00:23.520]  His name and his website will not be spoken or texted.
[00:23.520 --> 00:28.040]  They even got live systems now on their apps where they're going to listen to what you're
[00:28.040 --> 00:29.040]  saying in live time.
[00:29.040 --> 00:35.360]  And if you speak the word, Alex Jones, you will be banned.
[00:35.360 --> 00:39.440]  The war, of course, is that web show and website led by Raja Hollick, Alex Jones.
[00:39.440 --> 00:40.680]  Down I want them silenced.
[00:40.680 --> 00:41.680]  I want them muted.
[00:41.680 --> 00:44.240]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:44.240 --> 00:45.240]  Why are they doing this now?
[00:45.240 --> 00:49.360]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but they...
[00:49.360 --> 00:50.360]  Yes.
[00:50.360 --> 00:51.360]  Exactly.
[00:51.360 --> 00:52.360]  Yeah.
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.400]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now
[00:56.400 --> 00:57.400]  they banned him.
[00:57.400 --> 01:00.080]  They banned his little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:00.080 --> 01:01.080]  They put a press release out.
[01:01.080 --> 01:07.560]  They said, we have a new level of banning, and Alex Jones will be the first person ever
[01:07.560 --> 01:12.840]  with AI computers watching in live time that if you say Alex Jones on Facebook, 2.2 billion
[01:12.840 --> 01:18.440]  people, that's bigger than China, that's more people than China, that's 700 million more
[01:18.440 --> 01:25.560]  people than China has, that's 2.2 billion people, you cannot say Alex Jones' name or
[01:25.560 --> 01:26.680]  info warship.
[01:26.680 --> 01:30.440]  Why is it that the six individuals were banned by Facebook, what makes them different from
[01:30.440 --> 01:31.440]  others?
[01:31.440 --> 01:34.840]  Well, these are very extreme individuals, and no matter what anyone tells you, they
[01:34.840 --> 01:39.400]  are extremists, and that's why Facebook decided to get rid of them from the platform the
[01:39.400 --> 01:40.400]  other day.
[01:40.400 --> 01:44.480]  I don't think anyone's kind of pretending anymore that this is just about Alex Jones
[01:44.480 --> 01:50.760]  or Paul Joseph Watson or people you've only sort of heard of, or Laurel Lumer or whatever.
[01:50.760 --> 01:58.680]  This is about anybody who descents from the corporate view of what should be talked about.
[01:58.680 --> 02:03.920]  They're crushed, so why is no one defending the majority of Americans against this threat
[02:03.920 --> 02:05.400]  to our speech?
[02:05.400 --> 02:07.040]  That's an extremely good question.
[02:07.040 --> 02:12.080]  There actually is one person, one very prominent person out there who is calling for mass civil
[02:12.080 --> 02:17.520]  disobedience, and brace yourself, it's Snoop Dogg, who just ordered all of his followers
[02:17.520 --> 02:32.160]  to start sharing Lewis Farrakhan videos and footage on Facebook and Instagram.
[02:32.160 --> 02:37.160]  What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and Infowars.com?
[02:37.160 --> 02:40.600]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over
[02:40.600 --> 02:45.320]  at Trump's Twitter feed, and while he's promoting and legitimizing this news organization, we
[02:45.320 --> 02:49.880]  should also talk about how he's trying to tear down credible sources for news, The Washington
[02:49.880 --> 02:52.080]  Post, The New York Times, CNN.
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.120]  He was questioning why these news organizations have the ability to be on Twitter and Facebook.
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.120]  Why are they not banned?
[02:57.120 --> 02:58.120]  Right.
[02:58.120 --> 03:01.080]  While saying that the Infowars should be reinstated.
[03:01.080 --> 03:02.080]  It's not.
[03:02.080 --> 03:07.400]  CNN that had 10 million viewers an hour back in Larry King's heyday, they got rid of him
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.360]  when it dropped like 9 million.
[03:09.360 --> 03:12.480]  They hired Piers Morgan and went to like 2 million.
[03:12.480 --> 03:17.360]  Now their top rated shows have a million viewers, their average show, 50,000 an hour.
[03:17.360 --> 03:19.160]  Local radio shows have more listeners.
[03:19.160 --> 03:23.360]  See, last year, he knew who all my sponsors were on YouTube, even though you'd have to
[03:23.360 --> 03:28.440]  watch for hours to figure out who they were and geo locating ads only popped up certain
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.440]  areas of the country.
[03:29.440 --> 03:33.760]  So he couldn't find out unless he was in my account, him and Stolter, and then they were,
[03:33.760 --> 03:34.760]  it was in the news.
[03:34.760 --> 03:35.760]  So was media matters.
[03:35.760 --> 03:37.240]  They knew how much I was being paid.
[03:37.240 --> 03:42.000]  They had a whole list of all these sponsors that would opt in to buy into my show.
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.800]  Oh my gosh, the Pentagon was running Marine Corps and Army ads.
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.080]  He titled on that and boy, they did what, what General Stelter said.
[03:50.080 --> 03:51.080]  President Trump.
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.240]  Infowars content is useful to him.
[03:54.240 --> 03:56.200]  Infowars personalities align with him.
[03:56.200 --> 03:59.820]  He even gave an interview to Alex Jones back on the campaign trail.
[03:59.820 --> 04:03.280]  On Saturday, Trump went on a Twitter spree and said it's so great to watch this while
[04:03.280 --> 04:05.880]  sharing a video from Infowars.
[04:05.880 --> 04:30.600]  Big tech has access to everything you do and they give CNN and the Southern Private Law
[04:30.600 --> 04:34.960]  Center and media matters access to your private banking information.
[04:34.960 --> 04:36.200]  It's totally criminal.
[04:36.200 --> 04:38.320]  But see big tech, oh, they're a private company.
[04:38.320 --> 04:42.680]  They can collude with other companies and lie to you and sell your data and do false
[04:42.680 --> 04:46.160]  advertising until you come build up their platform and then pull the rug out from under
[04:46.160 --> 04:47.160]  you.
[04:47.160 --> 04:50.040]  Then they can call you a Nazi when they ban you and then they can tell their users,
[04:50.040 --> 05:00.320]  you don't say their name or we'll kick you off.
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.400]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't
[05:04.400 --> 05:05.720]  be there for my children someday.
[05:05.720 --> 05:07.560]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[05:07.560 --> 05:09.280]  Now I can be there for my children.
[05:09.280 --> 05:11.120]  Now I can make them strong.
[05:11.120 --> 05:12.760]  Now I can instruct them.
[05:12.760 --> 05:14.400]  Now I can teach them what I've learned.
[05:14.400 --> 05:15.400]  But not once I'm gone.
[05:15.400 --> 05:18.520]  You think of this digital age, your words gone forever, but now they're using better
[05:18.520 --> 05:20.720]  getting rid of what you said they were before.
[05:20.720 --> 05:25.440]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high tech book
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.440]  burning, isn't it?
[05:26.440 --> 05:29.800]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[05:29.800 --> 05:30.960]  I can't be destroyed now.
[05:30.960 --> 05:35.080]  As long as I realize I've done right and the longer the people know the truth and you
[05:35.080 --> 05:40.160]  can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it
[05:40.160 --> 05:44.640]  and go through the fire for it, there is a magic that then takes place, the transcend
[05:44.640 --> 05:45.640]  space and time.
[05:45.640 --> 05:50.160]  When you commit, be a word of mouth or to pray for us or to spread our articles and videos.
[05:50.160 --> 05:53.200]  That overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[05:53.200 --> 05:57.800]  So please now commit to support Info Wars however you can and realize your provision
[05:57.800 --> 06:05.280]  to Info Wars is your own provision.
[06:05.280 --> 06:15.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[06:15.840 --> 06:37.200]  This is Alex Jones.
[06:37.200 --> 06:43.000]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this Thursday, May 9th, 2019 Global Broadcast.
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.120]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, we'll be here for the next four hours and my own shroyer
[06:46.120 --> 06:51.520]  is loaded for bear to take on the globalists and that of course is coming up at 3 o'clock
[06:51.520 --> 06:55.720]  central standard time today, right before I went live today, obviously, David Knight
[06:55.720 --> 06:59.800]  8 a.m. to 11 a.m., knocking it out of the park.
[06:59.800 --> 07:04.240]  I am truly overwhelmed today with the knowledge and the information that we've got here.
[07:04.240 --> 07:08.280]  The co-founder of Facebook has come out and said the company needs to be broken up.
[07:08.280 --> 07:14.080]  Now, he says this from a leftist perspective and I've been predicting this is coming.
[07:14.080 --> 07:19.320]  I just want to break down the next moves that are about to unfold.
[07:19.320 --> 07:26.720]  Then I want to get into the fact that the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln has cleared
[07:26.720 --> 07:31.560]  the Suez Canal and we have not been closer to war with Iran since Operation Praying
[07:31.560 --> 07:38.720]  Manus in 1988 when the United States sunk a bunch of their ships there in the Persian
[07:38.720 --> 07:44.680]  Gulf and that could really trigger something serious because Iran conservatively has ten
[07:44.680 --> 07:49.880]  times the military prowess they had back then and sleeper sells all over the world.
[07:49.880 --> 07:57.960]  Also we have the feds released secretly, 168,000 illegal immigrant family members into communities
[07:57.960 --> 08:03.320]  just in the last fiscal year and that's just what we know about.
[08:03.320 --> 08:07.840]  This is the collapse of the failed border and part of the larger operation to destroy
[08:07.840 --> 08:08.840]  the country.
[08:08.840 --> 08:15.600]  So we'll be looking at all of this today and so much more but first there are full videos
[08:15.600 --> 08:23.520]  that are up on newswars.com and infowars.com by Caitlyn Bennett, the prophetic and prolific
[08:23.520 --> 08:32.360]  and just Energizer Bunny reporter with her crew, it's her fiance and her camera got together
[08:32.360 --> 08:35.440]  as a dynamic trio.
[08:35.440 --> 08:41.360]  The videos she's been getting are just incredible and the ideas that she's had to go on these
[08:41.360 --> 08:45.640]  colleges and to illustrate what they're doing and what they're up to and what they're saying
[08:45.640 --> 08:48.360]  are just incredible.
[08:48.360 --> 08:52.800]  Now both these videos are 15 minutes long, I'm not going to air them in full here today
[08:52.800 --> 08:57.600]  but I am going to air some pieces of them.
[08:57.600 --> 09:03.480]  But the first thing I'm going to air is a compilation where college students for the
[09:03.480 --> 09:08.520]  first time ever pay reparations for slavery.
[09:08.520 --> 09:11.720]  Now again that's about a 15 minute report, I'm only going to air two minutes of it, the
[09:11.720 --> 09:15.880]  full report is something you need to see and share with others to see the brainwashing,
[09:15.880 --> 09:22.640]  the coli control, the universities and there's another video that's up on infowars.com.
[09:22.640 --> 09:30.040]  What happens to pro-lifers that have permits to be out in public and what happens in compilations
[09:30.040 --> 09:37.400]  of liberals leftist attacking people for their first amendment, video captures moment, so-called
[09:37.400 --> 09:42.280]  feminist attack peaceful pro-life demonstrators, that's from the Daily Caller so I'm going
[09:42.280 --> 09:46.560]  to air both of these pieces and then plunge into the news but the authoritarianism we
[09:46.560 --> 09:51.160]  see on the colleges is the authoritarianism we see in big tech, is the authoritarianism
[09:51.160 --> 09:57.360]  we see everywhere that the left is in control, they are not the left, they are a criminal
[09:57.360 --> 10:03.760]  cult but then I am going to air most of one of her 15 minute reports so that this hour
[10:03.760 --> 10:08.300]  or next hour because I've got to analyze it.
[10:08.300 --> 10:12.440]  She was at Penn State and she didn't edit this, I mean she cut out the spaces but this
[10:12.440 --> 10:15.720]  is everyone she talked to.
[10:15.720 --> 10:21.560]  Everyone at one person was a drooling, you would say, I don't mean this meanly autistic
[10:21.560 --> 10:26.120]  or mentally retarded but they're not, this is what the smart phones and the culture has
[10:26.120 --> 10:28.560]  done to millennials, this is what they're like.
[10:28.560 --> 10:33.480]  You go to UT, you think you're in a Dawn of the Dead movie, people even walk with their
[10:33.480 --> 10:38.920]  hands hanging down and they go, uh, drag their feet, they've been soul-sucked, they have
[10:38.920 --> 10:45.600]  no inclination to build anything, they have no life-spark, unless they get mad at you
[10:45.600 --> 10:50.360]  and then they physically attack you but even then it's a very zombie-like attack, very
[10:50.360 --> 10:56.280]  zombie-like attack so radio listeners can hear all of this, obviously, people can watch
[10:56.280 --> 11:02.000]  though the verboten forbidden information at infowars.com, forward slash show and please
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.960]  share that live feed, that's how we get to new people in this culture war but they want
[11:06.960 --> 11:09.680]  us to take it out of the picture, obviously we're very effective because you're effective
[11:09.680 --> 11:13.080]  but I know they're not going to stop you, they haven't so far and I believe in you,
[11:13.080 --> 11:16.240]  you believe in me, so here's these two reports.
[11:16.240 --> 11:20.800]  We're here at Youngstown State University today with Joel Patrick.
[11:20.800 --> 11:33.360]  And I'm here asking people if they will pay me some reparations.
[11:33.360 --> 11:37.480]  Do you support reparations for black people because of slavery?
[11:37.480 --> 11:40.840]  Um, to some extent, yes.
[11:40.840 --> 11:41.840]  What about you?
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.840]  Do you support?
[11:42.840 --> 11:43.840]  Yeah.
[11:43.840 --> 11:47.440]  Perfect, so we have Joel over here, Joel Patrick, he has a reparation jar.
[11:47.440 --> 11:49.720]  You guys have the chance to pay him for your crimes.
[11:49.720 --> 11:52.840]  I just gave him ten bucks and I got five stamps.
[11:52.840 --> 11:53.840]  He did ten dollars?
[11:53.840 --> 11:57.840]  All right, here we go, grown men are going to get out their wallets to pay for slavery.
[11:57.840 --> 11:59.840]  Not much in here.
[11:59.840 --> 12:01.840]  All right, I'll still.
[12:01.840 --> 12:02.840]  All right.
[12:02.840 --> 12:07.840]  You have been forgiven for the crimes against my ancestors?
[12:07.840 --> 12:09.360]  Are you a professor here?
[12:09.360 --> 12:10.360]  Yeah.
[12:10.360 --> 12:11.360]  What do you teach?
[12:11.360 --> 12:12.360]  What is this for anyway?
[12:12.360 --> 12:13.360]  It's for YouTube.
[12:13.360 --> 12:14.360]  YouTube?
[12:14.360 --> 12:15.360]  Oh my God.
[12:15.360 --> 12:16.360]  Yeah, I would love to be paid reparations.
[12:16.360 --> 12:17.360]  Okay, here we go.
[12:17.360 --> 12:18.360]  All right.
[12:18.360 --> 12:19.360]  For slavery?
[12:19.360 --> 12:20.360]  That's all I give is a dollar?
[12:20.360 --> 12:21.360]  You can keep it.
[12:21.360 --> 12:23.360]  I want more money than that.
[12:23.360 --> 12:25.360]  Do you support reparations for slavery?
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.360]  Uh, yes, but at the moment I got to go to exams here.
[12:29.360 --> 12:30.360]  Well, I'll walk with you.
[12:30.360 --> 12:32.960]  So, you support reparations for slavery.
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.360]  We have Joel here who has a reparations jar and you can pay right now for reparations.
[12:38.360 --> 12:39.360]  All right.
[12:39.360 --> 12:45.360]  Well, as I said, I apologize for being on the run, but there you go.
[12:45.360 --> 12:46.360]  You're actually paying?
[12:46.360 --> 12:47.360]  Yes.
[12:47.360 --> 12:48.360]  Did you own slaves?
[12:48.360 --> 12:53.360]  No, I did not, but I mean, I was, I'm not a fan of the history behind it, so.
[12:53.360 --> 12:55.360]  Okay, thank you for paying for your crimes.
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.360]  We have Joel here and he has his reparations jar.
[12:58.360 --> 13:01.360]  Are you willing to give him reparation money?
[13:01.360 --> 13:02.360]  Why not?
[13:02.360 --> 13:03.360]  Okay, perfect.
[13:03.360 --> 13:04.360]  Okay.
[13:04.360 --> 13:07.360]  How much do you want her to give you?
[13:07.360 --> 13:12.360]  Well, what is the crimes of an entire country worth?
[13:12.360 --> 13:14.360]  Um, I'm not really sure.
[13:14.360 --> 13:19.360]  I don't have a lot of money on me and I can't put a number.
[13:19.360 --> 13:20.360]  All right.
[13:20.360 --> 13:25.360]  You are forgiven for the crimes of your ancestors.
[13:25.360 --> 13:29.360]  Then make sure that you support Caitlin at the InfowarsStore.com.
[13:29.360 --> 13:32.360]  Make sure that you go there and you get the super mail vitality.
[13:32.360 --> 13:33.360]  You need it.
[13:33.360 --> 13:34.360]  You got it.
[13:34.360 --> 13:37.360]  Yes.
[13:37.360 --> 13:38.360]  Yes.
[13:38.360 --> 13:41.360]  Ma'am, don't do that.
[13:41.360 --> 13:42.360]  Please.
[13:42.360 --> 13:43.360]  Please.
[13:43.360 --> 13:44.360]  You're a terrible person.
[13:44.360 --> 13:45.360]  You're a terrible person.
[13:45.360 --> 13:47.360]  Ma'am, ma'am, stop that.
[13:47.360 --> 13:48.360]  You're a terrible person.
[13:48.360 --> 13:49.360]  Stop.
[13:49.360 --> 13:50.360]  You didn't call a cop.
[13:50.360 --> 13:51.360]  You said you were not okay.
[13:51.360 --> 13:52.360]  You called a cop.
[13:52.360 --> 13:53.360]  This is not okay.
[13:53.360 --> 13:54.360]  Ma'am, calm down.
[13:54.360 --> 13:55.360]  This is not okay.
[13:55.360 --> 13:57.360]  Shut the f*** up right now.
[13:57.360 --> 13:58.360]  Hi, I'm at the pit.
[13:58.360 --> 14:05.360]  There's a woman that just punched my friend.
[14:05.360 --> 14:06.360]  What are we going to do?
[14:06.360 --> 14:07.360]  It's a video.
[14:07.360 --> 14:08.360]  I'm missing you.
[14:08.360 --> 14:11.360]  Instead of putting your hand up, dragging her out,
[14:11.360 --> 14:14.360]  we're going to fight her, which is the same thing as an arrest.
[14:14.360 --> 14:15.360]  It's an arrest by citation.
[14:15.360 --> 14:16.360]  No, I'm not.
[14:16.360 --> 14:17.360]  I'm not touching you.
[14:17.360 --> 14:18.360]  This is my rights.
[14:18.360 --> 14:19.360]  My ear is bone.
[14:19.360 --> 14:20.360]  So I'm sorry.
[14:20.360 --> 14:21.360]  Let me take your picture.
[14:21.360 --> 14:22.360]  Hi, Pap.
[14:22.360 --> 14:23.360]  You want to do something?
[14:23.360 --> 14:24.360]  Is she going to do something?
[14:24.360 --> 14:31.360]  Is she going to do something?
[14:31.360 --> 14:34.360]  It's a baby.
[14:34.360 --> 14:35.360]  It's a baby.
[14:35.360 --> 14:40.360]  If someone is raped and she gave birth and she decided to kill her three-year-old child.
[14:40.360 --> 14:46.360]  I'm going to get your phone.
[14:46.360 --> 14:51.360]  Get the f*** out of here with this fool's f***ing hand.
[14:51.360 --> 14:52.360]  No, you don't.
[14:52.360 --> 14:55.360]  This is f***ing bull s***.
[14:55.360 --> 14:58.360]  Get the f*** out of here.
[14:58.360 --> 15:03.360]  This is bull s***.
[15:03.360 --> 15:06.360]  No, it's not, man.
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.360]  It's wrong.
[15:07.360 --> 15:08.360]  It's their selves.
[15:08.360 --> 15:10.360]  They're the size of a dime they're selling.
[15:10.360 --> 15:12.360]  So you need to turn to Jesus Christ.
[15:12.360 --> 15:13.360]  He can set you free from your sin.
[15:13.360 --> 15:14.360]  Listen here, son.
[15:14.360 --> 15:15.360]  All right.
[15:15.360 --> 15:17.360]  I'm as gay as the day is long and twice as tiny.
[15:17.360 --> 15:22.360]  I don't give a f*** what you think Jesus tells me and what I shouldn't should not be doing.
[15:22.360 --> 15:24.360]  These are image barriers of God.
[15:24.360 --> 15:25.360]  You can go to hell.
[15:25.360 --> 15:26.360]  All right, guys.
[15:26.360 --> 15:31.360]  Again, this is the left always trying to silence everyone and then saying we're trying to silence
[15:31.360 --> 15:32.360]  them while they do it.
[15:32.360 --> 15:37.360]  These are the wholly anointed ones who think they're the cool kids and who are directed
[15:37.360 --> 15:40.360]  by the post-humanist technocracy.
[15:40.360 --> 15:42.360]  That's what this is.
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.360]  There is a open world government program to end humanity as we know it.
[15:47.360 --> 15:50.360]  Remember, we give you next decade's news today.
[15:50.360 --> 15:59.360]  We are the globalist number one enemy because we represent the future of humanity.
[15:59.360 --> 16:01.360]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[16:01.360 --> 16:02.360]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[16:02.360 --> 16:03.360]  Hey, what you doing?
[16:03.360 --> 16:04.360]  Mother's Day, remember?
[16:04.360 --> 16:05.360]  Oh, yeah.
[16:05.360 --> 16:08.360]  So I'm making lists, got to plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts
[16:08.360 --> 16:09.360]  in case she wants to return.
[16:09.360 --> 16:11.360]  You know there's an easier way, right?
[16:11.360 --> 16:12.360]  I'm guessing you do?
[16:12.360 --> 16:13.360]  Yes.
[16:13.360 --> 16:18.360]  I'm going to show you the easy, quick way to shop for mom and save 30% at sunshine-pillows.com.
[16:18.360 --> 16:19.360]  Ah, pillows.

[18:21.360 --> 18:47.360]  We'll see you next time.
[18:51.360 --> 18:58.360]  We'll see you next time.
[19:21.360 --> 19:31.360]  Thanks for watching.
[19:51.360 --> 20:05.360]  Thanks for watching.
[20:21.360 --> 20:32.360]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[20:32.360 --> 20:37.360]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, May night, 2019 broadcast.
[20:37.360 --> 20:43.360]  What I'm going to do is open the phones up in this hour, into the next hour, into the
[20:43.360 --> 20:48.360]  third hour as we go through a lot of this news and get into any topic you want, any issue,
[20:48.360 --> 20:54.360]  any area, but first-time callers, again, is who we're going to be taking phone calls
[20:54.360 --> 20:55.360]  from.
[20:55.360 --> 20:59.360]  The number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[20:59.360 --> 21:00.360]  877-789-Alex.
[21:00.360 --> 21:01.360]  Again, 877-789-2539.
[21:01.360 --> 21:10.360]  And obviously, I'd like to get your take on the so-called constitutional crisis, the
[21:10.360 --> 21:12.360]  Democrats wanting to continue their fake witch hunt.
[21:12.360 --> 21:19.360]  Also, I want to get your take on one of the co-founders of Facebook coming out, good personal
[21:19.360 --> 21:22.360]  friends with Zuckerberg saying the company needs to be broken up.
[21:22.360 --> 21:23.360]  What's really behind that?
[21:23.360 --> 21:26.360]  I'm going to give you my take on it.
[21:26.360 --> 21:32.360]  Aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln passes through Suez Canal last night on route to Iran as
[21:32.360 --> 21:33.360]  tensions soar.
[21:33.360 --> 21:34.360]  We're going to be breaking all that down.
[21:34.360 --> 21:39.360]  Feds release 168,000 illegal immigrant family members into communities.
[21:39.360 --> 21:44.360]  Colorado shooting suspect was transitioning from a girl to a male.
[21:44.360 --> 21:47.360]  Second suspect said he hates Christians.
[21:47.360 --> 21:51.360]  That's why you'll barely ever hear about that in the news again.
[21:51.360 --> 21:55.360]  But you better believe that it was two right-wingers doing it.
[21:55.360 --> 21:58.360]  You would be hearing that all gun owners are guilty.
[21:58.360 --> 22:00.360]  All Christians are guilty.
[22:00.360 --> 22:07.360]  But because this is apparently too leftist, whacked out as usual, you're going to see
[22:07.360 --> 22:10.360]  that brushed under the rug extremely quickly.
[22:10.360 --> 22:15.360]  That's just some of the news that we're going to be covering here today.
[22:15.360 --> 22:20.360]  877-789-2539 is the number to join us.
[22:20.360 --> 22:25.360]  The first thing I want to get into right now is what Sean Hannity talked about last night.
[22:25.360 --> 22:28.360]  I'm going to play a short clip of his opening monologue.
[22:28.360 --> 22:30.360]  The full show is up on infowars.com.
[22:30.360 --> 22:33.360]  It's worth sharing.
[22:33.360 --> 22:37.360]  And most listeners will say, hey, this is old news to us, we're sick of hearing about Russiagate.
[22:37.360 --> 22:39.360]  Exactly.
[22:39.360 --> 22:45.360]  If Trump doesn't go on the offense, and if the Justice Department doesn't, and if the Republicans don't,
[22:45.360 --> 22:48.360]  it doesn't matter how many crimes the Democrats have committed.
[22:48.360 --> 22:50.360]  They're going to make up stuff on Republicans.
[22:50.360 --> 22:53.360]  They're going to harass everybody in Trump's orbit.
[22:53.360 --> 22:55.360]  They're going to continue to try to sabotage the economy.
[22:55.360 --> 22:58.360]  And so it's the right thing to do.
[22:58.360 --> 23:00.360]  It's got to be done.
[23:00.360 --> 23:03.360]  And we're dealing without a control, arrogant criminals like this.
[23:03.360 --> 23:06.360]  The only thing they know is strength.
[23:06.360 --> 23:10.360]  And most of these Democrats are complicit in the cover-ups as well.
[23:10.360 --> 23:16.360]  So they're not going to stop this whole Russiagating until we stop them.
[23:16.360 --> 23:19.360]  And so they've got dozens of other investigations fired up.
[23:19.360 --> 23:23.360]  They're all fraudulent, and the witch hunt should be over.
[23:23.360 --> 23:26.360]  Here's Sean Hannity talking about it last night.
[23:26.360 --> 23:30.360]  And of course, then we'll expand on the fact that no president ever put up with this.
[23:30.360 --> 23:32.360]  They always declared executive privilege.
[23:32.360 --> 23:34.360]  Trump didn't.
[23:34.360 --> 23:36.360]  Now he is.
[23:36.360 --> 23:39.360]  And well, now they're claiming he's involved in obstruction.
[23:39.360 --> 23:42.360]  It's just nothing but fraud. Here it is.
[23:42.360 --> 23:52.360]  We start tonight with breaking news about the president fighting back after two plus years of nothing but complete and utter cooperation.
[23:52.360 --> 23:55.360]  1.5 million documents handed over.
[23:55.360 --> 24:02.360]  Every single person in the White House encouraged to cooperate and speak with Mueller and Congress.
[24:02.360 --> 24:08.360]  Not one time did the Trump White House invoke executive privilege.
[24:08.360 --> 24:09.360]  Not once.
[24:09.360 --> 24:14.360]  Even White House counsel, which is to me unfathomable, Don McGahn,
[24:14.360 --> 24:20.360]  spent 30 hours with Mueller's Democratic pals and Hillary's attorney.
[24:20.360 --> 24:26.360]  Now the president's saying enough is enough, and today the president did finally say enough is enough
[24:26.360 --> 24:30.360]  by exerting executive privilege over all aspects of the Mueller report.
[24:30.360 --> 24:35.360]  And the White House ordered former counsel, Don McGahn, from testifying before Congress.
[24:35.360 --> 24:37.360]  They already have 30 hours.
[24:37.360 --> 24:44.360]  The Attorney General Barr is refusing to be interrogated, not by the House Judiciary Committee,
[24:44.360 --> 24:52.360]  by their staff, for the 206 years of that committee, not one time has that ever happened.
[24:52.360 --> 24:56.360]  And the Attorney General is saying, and it's not going to happen now.
[24:56.360 --> 25:01.360]  And the endless stream of documents of penance, they are now being rejected by the administration.
[25:01.360 --> 25:05.360]  In other words, the witch hunt is over, the Democrats lost,
[25:05.360 --> 25:16.360]  and what the Democrats are now doing is nothing more than radical revenge, which is borne out of a mass psychotic rage against the president.
[25:16.360 --> 25:21.360]  And by the way, four separate independent, four.
[25:21.360 --> 25:26.360]  They have an irrational inability to accept four separate independent results.
[25:26.360 --> 25:29.360]  The nine month FBI counterintelligence investigation.
[25:29.360 --> 25:32.360]  Oh, Peter struck the no there there.
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.360]  Oh, we had nothing in just before the appointment of Mueller.
[25:36.360 --> 25:40.360]  Lisa Paid said, we have the House Intel Committee investigation.
[25:40.360 --> 25:44.360]  No collusion, no conspiracy, no cooperation with Russia.
[25:44.360 --> 25:46.360]  The bipartisan Senate investigation.
[25:46.360 --> 25:51.360]  And now the 20 month Mueller witch hunt, all determining the same thing.
[25:51.360 --> 25:54.360]  No collusion, no obstruction.
[25:54.360 --> 25:59.360]  Does Congress care one iota how much this is costing and legal fees?
[25:59.360 --> 26:07.360]  And for what? What about every single person that has been called before the committees or called before Mueller?
[26:07.360 --> 26:09.360]  They all have to pay for lawyers.
[26:09.360 --> 26:13.360]  Lawyers in Washington DC can be as much as $1,000 an hour.
[26:13.360 --> 26:19.360]  Now they're going to be called in to be asked the same questions now a fourth, fifth and sixth time.
[26:19.360 --> 26:23.360]  This is nothing but harassment and abuse of power.
[26:23.360 --> 26:30.360]  And frankly, a brand new taxpayer funded witch hunt designed to spear the duly elected president of the United States.
[26:30.360 --> 26:34.360]  And then he goes on to say anybody in the orbit is being harassed and terrorized.
[26:34.360 --> 26:37.360]  Yes, so we have a right in the duty to stop it.
[26:37.360 --> 26:39.360]  And so you expand on that.
[26:39.360 --> 26:49.360]  There's a clip up on info wars dot com that we're going to play when we come back of Jim Jordan's boiled down yesterday during the contempt airing on Attorney General Barr.
[26:49.360 --> 26:58.360]  And he says, you know what this is? It's a smoke screen and a cover up for your illegal warrants and your illegal witch hunt.
[26:58.360 --> 27:00.360]  And we have all of the documents.
[27:00.360 --> 27:09.360]  We have all the proof and Louis Gohmert goes on from Texas and says, listen, I wish you Democrats would stop this, but you're not.
[27:09.360 --> 27:12.360]  So we're coming after you and you're going to get prosecuted.
[27:12.360 --> 27:13.360]  So get ready.
[27:13.360 --> 27:15.360]  And the Democrats look scared.
[27:15.360 --> 27:17.360]  They are all in on it at the top.
[27:17.360 --> 27:20.360]  They really thought they'd keep Trump from getting elected.
[27:20.360 --> 27:22.360]  Then they thought they'd removing.
[27:22.360 --> 27:24.360]  And now they're so desperate.
[27:24.360 --> 27:26.360]  It makes them more dangerous.
[27:26.360 --> 27:29.360]  That's what I keep getting back to these people are dangerous.
[27:29.360 --> 27:41.360]  And now they've accelerated their timetable of censorship against nationalists against Trump supporters against people that just want our country to be free and common sense and not globalist.
[27:41.360 --> 27:43.360]  So it's gotten serious.
[27:43.360 --> 27:45.360]  We're going to come back and some of that Jim Jordan clip.
[27:45.360 --> 27:47.360]  We're going to start taking your phone calls.
[27:47.360 --> 27:52.360]  Then we have a bestselling author coming on who first got banned on Amazon and then he's getting banned everywhere else.
[27:52.360 --> 27:58.360]  And now he's having his bank accounts taken away all because he talked about men's empowerment.
[27:58.360 --> 28:00.360]  That is the big no, no.
[28:00.360 --> 28:03.360]  If you want to teach an eight year old boy to cut his testicles off.
[28:03.360 --> 28:05.360]  That's fine with big tech.
[28:05.360 --> 28:07.360]  You want to teach little girls how to commit suicide.
[28:07.360 --> 28:09.360]  That's wonderful and increase your suicide rates.
[28:09.360 --> 28:12.360]  The system is here to kill you.
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.360]  It's here to demoralize you ahead of a post human era.
[28:16.360 --> 28:21.360]  So the underpinnings of a civilization are being destroyed by design.
[28:21.360 --> 28:23.360]  That's not hyperbole.
[28:23.360 --> 28:25.360]  That's not something that sounds shocking.
[28:25.360 --> 28:31.360]  That is the entrance fee to the new digital age and merging with the silicon.
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.360]  That is the religion of Silicon Valley.
[28:34.360 --> 28:36.360]  You have been warned.
[28:36.360 --> 28:39.360]  Told you that decades ago now it's all over the news.
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.360]  People say, of course, humans are bad. Let's get rid of them immediately.
[28:43.360 --> 28:45.360]  Yes, this is the real world. It's really happening.
[28:45.360 --> 28:47.360]  So how do we keep our consciousness?
[28:47.360 --> 28:49.360]  How do we save our awareness, our souls?
[28:49.360 --> 28:52.360]  How do we keep from being sucked and deceived by this?
[28:52.360 --> 29:10.360]  Well, that's what this broadcast is about. We're in this together. I'm Alex Jones.
[29:22.360 --> 29:27.360]  I know you can't do it alone. You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[29:27.360 --> 29:32.360]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[29:32.360 --> 29:34.360]  and totally change your life.

[29:43.360 --> 30:01.360]  Call now and learn more.
[30:01.360 --> 30:05.360]  I want to say brain force is great. I want to say turbo force is amazing. It is.
[30:05.360 --> 30:10.360]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[30:10.360 --> 30:13.360]  Fish oil is better than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[30:13.360 --> 30:18.360]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[30:18.360 --> 30:22.360]  You've got the children's, you've got the adults, you've got the krill oil.
[30:22.360 --> 30:25.360]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[30:25.360 --> 30:29.360]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[30:29.360 --> 30:32.360]  And I'm sorry. You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[30:32.360 --> 30:35.360]  The krill is hallucinogenic. It's so good. In my view.
[30:35.360 --> 30:37.360]  I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[30:37.360 --> 30:40.360]  I eat five Catholics of krill oil before I go to bed.
[30:40.360 --> 30:43.360]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[30:43.360 --> 30:49.360]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[30:49.360 --> 30:53.360]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[30:53.360 --> 30:57.360]  But you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[30:57.360 --> 31:00.360]  I just can't do it.
[31:00.360 --> 31:04.360]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative,
[31:04.360 --> 31:07.360]  in full words, life has the formula for you.

[31:13.360 --> 31:16.360]  is found in our high quality, ultra pure krill oil concentrate.

[31:26.360 --> 31:31.360]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health,
[31:31.360 --> 31:35.360]  joint health and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism,
[31:35.360 --> 31:38.360]  helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[31:38.360 --> 31:42.360]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[31:42.360 --> 31:47.360]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate

[32:57.360 --> 33:03.360]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[33:03.360 --> 33:21.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:21.360 --> 33:46.360]  Live from the infowarst.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:46.360 --> 33:59.360]  Humans chose throughout history have an issue with seeing threats until it's really, really far down the road and sometimes too late.
[33:59.360 --> 34:08.360]  But then once things get really, really bad, individuals and people tend to really, really play catch up.
[34:08.360 --> 34:11.360]  And a lot of times things get turned around.
[34:11.360 --> 34:27.360]  And we're really at that point as a civilization and as a country and as a world right now that we need to have a discussion about what's being built around us and who's making the decision to build those systems.
[34:27.360 --> 34:38.360]  And that's why at the bottom of the next hour, I'm going to get into this 20 something page article in the New York Times by the original co-founder of Facebook.
[34:38.360 --> 34:49.360]  Admitting that Zuckerberg is already controlling what messages you can privately send, already reading everything you are saying, selling it to thousands of third parties.
[34:49.360 --> 35:04.360]  The only reason you got in trouble over Cambridge Analytica is because they were doing some work for a nationalist or for patriots just getting contact info of potential Trump voters so that Trump could contact them.
[35:04.360 --> 35:10.360]  That's elementary stuff. That's 30 year old technology.
[35:10.360 --> 35:26.360]  But regardless, Zuckerberg to a great extent is in control of his company and that's why the establishment wants to break it up and basically absorb it into the system because they think Zuckerberg has too much power in their global government system.
[35:26.360 --> 35:37.360]  He's one of them in QTEL, the Central Intelligence Agency, publicly built the first Facebook. They gave him the software. They created the Harvard template that the young whiz kid built it and developed it.
[35:37.360 --> 35:48.360]  But he has been a serious executive. He has been very aggressive and in that whole military industrial complex, technocracy, he's been very, very predatory.
[35:48.360 --> 36:00.360]  And so now they're circling him, getting ready to break him up. But that won't be to reform Facebook, my friends, for the people.
[36:00.360 --> 36:08.360]  That will be simply to absorb it into the system and make it even worse. And if you read the article, it actually admits all that.
[36:08.360 --> 36:18.360]  He said, well, Zuckerberg just doesn't need to get rid of hate speech. He needs to protect speech by stopping other types of stuff. So we need to protect speech by getting rid of it.
[36:18.360 --> 36:24.360]  It's a very Orwellian double think article and it's very, very serious. We're going to be going over it.
[36:24.360 --> 36:29.360]  And a lot of people selfishly say, well, I'm on Facebook, so why do I care? Well, 2.2 billion people are.
[36:29.360 --> 36:39.360]  And so that's going to decide elections all over the world. That's going to decide the future of this country, other countries, especially if it's not a free and open debate.
[36:39.360 --> 36:50.360]  And I kept wondering why so much last year during my deplatforming, they would say, Jones is calling for violence. Jones is calling for getting battle rivals and killing the media.
[36:50.360 --> 36:58.360]  And you notice they never showed you a clip. They'd say, let me read the quotes and then they would take single words, two words, put them together.
[36:58.360 --> 37:08.360]  I know I've talked a lot about that, but when the whole corporate media lies to create a perception that, OK, Big Tech's banning Alan Jones because he's yelling fire in the theater.
[37:08.360 --> 37:23.360]  What's the real reason they're doing that? So Big Media and Big Tech have been practicing working together on taking my rights away and then see, now they've been trained, now suddenly it's everybody else.
[37:23.360 --> 37:30.360]  And that's in the New York Times article that's incredibly dangerous. But they're not talking about dialing all that back or stopping it.
[37:30.360 --> 37:43.360]  They're talking about shutting Zuckerberg out of his dictatorial position and then sharing it in these councils in these CFR type roundtables.
[37:43.360 --> 37:51.360]  So that's really what's going on here right now. Let's go ahead and go to the Jim Jordan clip because this just broke minutes ago from the Hill.
[37:51.360 --> 37:54.360]  It's also up on infowords.com and newswords.com.
[37:54.360 --> 38:01.360]  Judge orders DOJ to give her unredacted Mueller report portions on Stone for private review.
[38:01.360 --> 38:08.360]  This is an Obama judge. You've got the prosecution that's Hillary's former chief lawyer.
[38:08.360 --> 38:16.360]  And if you don't think that that's going to get leaked to the Democrats so they can cherry pick and leak stuff, well, then I got a bridge.
[38:16.360 --> 38:26.360]  I'm really happy to sell you. So Stone had actually though asked for this and it makes sense because he's in the report and blacked out for him to get this for his defense.
[38:26.360 --> 38:33.360]  I actually support this and Trump said declassified the whole thing. He said he has nothing to hide.
[38:33.360 --> 38:36.360]  In fact, this is actually going to expose the Democrats to a great extent.
[38:36.360 --> 38:46.360]  So some Democrats were like actually let's not release the unredacted. So this is quite a mesh. I wonder what's going to happen here.
[38:46.360 --> 38:51.360]  But let's go ahead and go to Jim Jordan pointing out the real reason the Democrats are up on their hind legs whenever everybody.
[38:51.360 --> 39:01.360]  That's because they are covering up for their crimes. The best way to do that is act like you're innocent and then start trying to accuse everybody else.
[39:01.360 --> 39:06.360]  I would ask the chairman. My understanding is Mr. Muller is going to be here next week. Why are we doing it?
[39:06.360 --> 39:10.360]  You're going to get to ask the guy who wrote the whole darn document. We're all going to get asked him questions.
[39:10.360 --> 39:19.360]  Why don't you hold off on this contempt until at least the guy who wrote the thing spent 22 months and $35 million with a whole bunch of Democrat lawyers putting it together.
[39:19.360 --> 39:22.360]  Why don't you wait and ask him next week before we do this contempt resolution?
[39:22.360 --> 39:23.360]  Gentlemen's recognized.
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.360]  Bill Barr is following the law and what's his reward? Democrats are going to hold him in contempt.
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.360]  I don't think today's actually about getting information. I don't think it's about getting the unredacted Muller report.
[39:33.360 --> 39:39.360]  I don't think last week's hearing was actually about having staff question the attorney general. I think it's as my colleague said earlier,
[39:39.360 --> 39:45.360]  I think it's all about trying to destroy Bill Barr because Democrats are nervous. He's going to get to the bottom of everything.
[39:45.360 --> 39:49.360]  He's going to find out how and why this investigation started in the first place.
[39:49.360 --> 39:55.360]  Never forget what Bill Barr said a few weeks ago, three and a half weeks ago when he testified in front of the Senate Finance Committee.
[39:55.360 --> 40:00.360]  He said a lot of important things, but he said three, excuse me, four very interesting things.
[40:00.360 --> 40:05.360]  First, he said there was a failure of leadership at the upper echelon term. He used upper echelon, the FBI.
[40:05.360 --> 40:07.360]  We all know that's the case.
[40:07.360 --> 40:14.360]  Director Comey has been fired. Deputy Director McCabe fired, lied three times under oath according to the Inspector General.
[40:14.360 --> 40:20.360]  FBI counsel Jim Baker demoted and left currently under investigation by the Justice Department.
[40:20.360 --> 40:26.360]  Lisa Page demoted and left. Peter Struck, deputy head of counterintelligence, demoted and fired.
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.360]  Peter Struck, the guy who ran the Clinton investigation and the Russian investigation.
[40:30.360 --> 40:35.360]  There was certainly a failure of leadership at the upper echelon of the FBI.
[40:35.360 --> 40:39.360]  Second thing the attorney general said three and a half weeks ago in front of the Senate Finance Committee.
[40:39.360 --> 40:44.360]  Spying did occur. He said it twice. Yes, spying did occur.
[40:44.360 --> 40:50.360]  Third, he said there's a basis for my concern about the spying that took place.
[40:50.360 --> 40:56.360]  And maybe the most interesting thing, two terms he used that frankly I find frightening.
[40:56.360 --> 41:03.360]  He said there was, in his judgment, he thinks there may have been unauthorized surveillance and political surveillance.
[41:03.360 --> 41:05.360]  Scary terms.
[41:05.360 --> 41:09.360]  We got to go back to January 3rd, 2017.
[41:09.360 --> 41:14.360]  Senator Schumer on the Rachel Maddow show talking about then-President-elect Trump says this.
[41:14.360 --> 41:21.360]  If you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.
[41:21.360 --> 41:29.360]  Now, I don't know if the FBI went after President Trump in six ways, but I sure know they went after him in two ways.
[41:29.360 --> 41:34.360]  And the first one is the now-famous dossier. On October 21st, 2016,
[41:34.360 --> 41:41.360]  the FBI used one party's opposition research document as the basis to go to a secret court to get a warrant to spy on the other parties.
[41:41.360 --> 41:45.360]  And the inspector general has come out and said that was all illegal. They did lie.
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.360]  And where did you first see that broken? Here.
[41:47.360 --> 41:51.360]  And that's why we're being punished. That's why we're being lied about. That's why we're being attacked.
[41:51.360 --> 41:55.360]  That's why we're being sued is because we're willing to put things out first when others are afraid to do it.
[41:55.360 --> 42:01.360]  But you heard Jim Jordan say, political spying, political surveillance.
[42:01.360 --> 42:05.360]  That's how you get dictatorships. That's how you get oligarchies.
[42:05.360 --> 42:09.360]  That's how you get Venezuelans and Nazi Germanies and Maoist Chinas.
[42:09.360 --> 42:13.360]  And we've been fighting over this for two and a half years.
[42:13.360 --> 42:17.360]  How are we ever going to beat big tech who's openly moved to China?
[42:17.360 --> 42:22.360]  And it's helping round up political dissidents by the millions, by the millions. Look it up.
[42:22.360 --> 42:25.360]  When they openly lie to Congress, they'll get in trouble and everybody knows their line.
[42:25.360 --> 42:32.360]  If we can't even defeat a bunch of mentally defunct Democrats who have to read off pieces of paper,
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.360]  they can't even talk like Jim Jordan or I can, or Trump can,
[42:36.360 --> 42:42.360]  if we can't beat these little criminals, these little Democrat machine criminals,
[42:42.360 --> 42:47.360]  we'll never beat big tech. We have to move against big tech for humanity now.
[42:47.360 --> 42:56.360]  We have to stop the AI, mark my words, or we're all dead soon.
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.360]  All the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the young turds and others,
[43:21.360 --> 43:24.360]  get so butt hurt when Trump won.
[43:24.360 --> 43:30.360]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[43:30.360 --> 43:35.360]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now.
[43:35.360 --> 43:39.360]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech,
[43:39.360 --> 43:43.360]  about taking your very sovereignty away. This country is in a war.
[43:43.360 --> 43:47.360]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you,
[43:47.360 --> 43:49.360]  if you don't spread the articles and videos,

[43:52.360 --> 43:54.360]  and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.

[47:19.240 --> 47:19.360]  Hi, I be …
[47:19.360 --> 47:10.160]  Tall picture comes with an important
[47:10.160 --> 47:21.120]  icon.
[47:21.120 --> 47:25.040]  ====

[47:32.440 --> 47:35.120]  3
[47:35.120 --> 47:39.260]  Welcome back. Thank you so much for joining us. Okay. We've got a loaded
[47:39.260 --> 47:43.240]  phone lines. I'm gonna have your calls throughout the rest of the show. We have
[47:43.240 --> 47:48.320]  one guest joining us who's being platformed everywhere because he writes
[47:48.320 --> 47:56.320]  self-help books for men. And again, that is a big no-no to the globalists because
[47:56.320 --> 47:59.040]  they don't want to have any leadership. They don't want to have any alpha metal
[47:59.040 --> 48:02.480]  types out there. To the left is now teaching. There's no such thing as
[48:02.480 --> 48:07.480]  masculinity. The masculinity is a made-up term. So a man can be a woman. A woman
[48:07.480 --> 48:12.480]  can be a man. You can be a dog if you want, but you can't be masculine. So that
[48:12.480 --> 48:15.080]  guest will join us for a couple segments and then we'll continue with your
[48:15.080 --> 48:19.200]  calls. I'll go into your calls here in a moment. There's a really positive video
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.840]  that's just went live. Kelly McBrain wrote a story about. We'll get to next
[48:23.840 --> 48:28.840]  hour. Students walk out on dim politicians pushing gun control at the
[48:28.840 --> 48:33.920]  latest school shooting vigil near Columbine in Colorado. Students said
[48:33.920 --> 48:38.960]  their grief was being politicized and chanted mental health. Colorado School
[48:38.960 --> 48:43.960]  shooting suspect was transitioning to male. No, you do not have testes. You
[48:43.960 --> 48:48.080]  do not have the bones or heart or brain of a male. You want to be a male and
[48:48.080 --> 48:51.840]  that's your issue. If you're an adult, you want to take hormones and try to act
[48:51.840 --> 48:55.120]  and look like a male, you are not a male. There are men and there are women.
[48:55.120 --> 48:59.680]  Period. There are some mutations we can have hermaphrodite. Again, I haven't
[48:59.680 --> 49:03.160]  even gotten into this lately, but the heavy lifting power champion is
[49:03.160 --> 49:06.840]  obviously a big dude and he's got big bones and big muscles for the average
[49:06.840 --> 49:14.480]  power lifter and now all women's sports will be dominated by men. Again, this is
[49:14.480 --> 49:17.320]  two plus two equals 10. This is brainwashing. We're going to go to your
[49:17.320 --> 49:22.040]  calls here in a moment on the waterfront, whatever issue you want to raise,
[49:22.040 --> 49:26.320]  whatever topic you want to get into. I'm not going to belabor this, but I'm
[49:26.320 --> 49:30.720]  just going to tell listeners this. Thank you for your support. It really means a
[49:30.720 --> 49:35.200]  lot to me. I do this so much that half the time I can't stand to hear my voice,
[49:35.200 --> 49:38.240]  but I know the show is effective. I know we're getting the truth out and I
[49:38.240 --> 49:42.800]  appreciate you and all your support and all your prayers. We make it really easy
[49:42.800 --> 49:46.640]  to support us because everybody needs water filtration systems. We've got the
[49:46.640 --> 49:52.800]  best, the lowest prices, sit on your countertop and are the best. We have the
[49:52.800 --> 49:56.360]  best non-GMO heirloom seats. We have the best shortwave radios and we have great
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.160]  t-shirts and great books and great films, great selection and we have really,
[50:00.160 --> 50:04.600]  really good supplements. The best supplements that are out there at the
[50:04.600 --> 50:08.000]  lowest prices, you're going to find them with really good ingredients, not with
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.480]  fillers, not with garbage and several big sales have to end next week, early next
[50:13.480 --> 50:19.280]  week, and that is a bottle of X2 deep earth iodine, true atomic iodine with a
[50:19.280 --> 50:22.480]  bottle of X3. That's all three types of iodine, including deep earth and the other
[50:22.480 --> 50:26.720]  two types, tri-iodine. That's better for some people than just pure iodine, but
[50:26.720 --> 50:31.920]  not most people, but it's still excellent. So survival shield X3, that is at
[50:31.920 --> 50:36.320]  infowarstore.com. Again, no reviews yet on that. It's a combo, but you can read the
[50:36.320 --> 50:42.880]  thousands of five star reviews on X2 and X3. It's a 99% rating. No one else even
[50:42.880 --> 50:48.760]  has that on power reviews for any supplement. Ultra 12 is brand new. It's
[50:48.760 --> 50:54.520]  the same as Secret 12. It's just twice as strong. The highest quality B12, the
[50:54.520 --> 51:00.600]  highest quality methyl cobalamin and that is now our newest product, 50% off out
[51:00.600 --> 51:07.440]  of the gates and that helps fund our operations. So again, without B12, you
[51:07.440 --> 51:11.820]  will rot away and go the way of the Goody Bird. Without vitamin C, you'll go
[51:11.820 --> 51:16.000]  bye-bye. It's just a lot of easy to get forms of that. There's not a B12. There's
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.600]  a lot of easy to get forms of iodine, which you have to have to live. And so I
[51:20.600 --> 51:24.160]  just think you should really research why the globalists are trying to keep you
[51:24.160 --> 51:29.280]  away from B12 and why they're trying to keep you away from clean iodine. And if
[51:29.280 --> 51:34.760]  you just look into this, it's startling. It's staggering. It is
[51:34.760 --> 51:42.560]  thunderclapping. When you look at the evidence, just type in iodine and IQ, iodine
[51:42.560 --> 51:49.440]  deficiency and IQ reduction. And just start there and you'll be stunned. You
[51:49.440 --> 51:52.600]  owe it to yourself and your family to investigate this. Thank you for your
[51:52.600 --> 51:56.920]  support. All right, look at all these great callers. We've got so many of them.
[51:56.920 --> 52:03.520]  Morgan and Patrick and Mitch and Carson and JD and Darren and California and Ben
[52:03.520 --> 52:12.200]  and Mike and so many others. Who should we go to first? Who's been holding it
[52:12.200 --> 52:19.560]  longest? Let's talk to him. Darren in Canada says son has autism. Go ahead.
[52:19.560 --> 52:24.880]  Thank you. How's it going, Alex? I'm good sir. Sorry to hear about your son. Yeah, he
[52:24.880 --> 52:31.720]  he actually has autism directly from vaccination. Like when they vaccinated him,
[52:31.720 --> 52:37.720]  he flatlined on the table and they resuscitated him. And you know, he's
[52:37.720 --> 52:42.360]  had autism his whole life, right? Like special ed classes, psychologists. And
[52:42.360 --> 52:48.720]  about a year ago, I started giving him the secret 12. And I also have a friend
[52:48.720 --> 52:52.160]  who's like one of the leading autism doctors, his doctor who works with him.
[52:52.160 --> 52:56.640]  And I brought him like yes, and he hadn't never seen him for a few months. And when
[52:56.640 --> 53:00.840]  he met with him, he was like, oh my god, like, you know, what's going on? Like, you
[53:00.840 --> 53:05.760]  know, he's so much better. And I showed him the bottle of the secret 12, right?
[53:05.760 --> 53:11.160]  And it was the only thing that I've changed with him was giving him B12. Now
[53:11.160 --> 53:15.800]  he's, you know, he's not in special ed no more. He's in like normal class. And it
[53:15.800 --> 53:20.160]  just completely changed his life and my life. And I know you don't like to be
[53:20.160 --> 53:24.360]  thanked, but thank you. Well, thank you, brother. I want to be clear. When we wanted
[53:24.360 --> 53:27.840]  to put out B12, we know that synthetic just doesn't get absorbed. We went out and
[53:27.840 --> 53:31.680]  found the best organic, truly absorbable, mythical bolliman. But I want to go back
[53:31.680 --> 53:35.720]  to the flat lining because I've had thousands of calls like this over the
[53:35.720 --> 53:39.160]  years. I'm on there 20 plus years. I probably had thousands over 1000. I've
[53:39.160 --> 53:42.920]  run into over 1000 people on the street and they'll come over and say they'll
[53:42.920 --> 53:45.880]  usually have four or five kids and they've got a son, sometimes multiple that
[53:45.880 --> 53:50.240]  are autistic. And they say no, they were fine till 18 months when I took the
[53:50.240 --> 53:54.960]  third round. That's genuinely generally what happens. Sometimes it happens first
[53:54.960 --> 54:00.480]  round or second round. Describe how your son was, what it was like. Because a lot
[54:00.480 --> 54:04.160]  of times they have the convulsion by the time they get home or in the car,
[54:04.160 --> 54:08.320]  sometimes in the hospital or at the clinic and doctors will even admit, okay,
[54:08.320 --> 54:12.600]  they had a bad reaction. But the news will lie and say it's insane. You know,
[54:12.640 --> 54:16.800]  sure, used to we had one in 37,000 with autism. Now it's one in 58. Almost all
[54:16.800 --> 54:22.200]  boys describe for listeners what happened. This was right when he was born. He
[54:22.200 --> 54:27.160]  was a few weeks premature and it was like right when he came out in Canada
[54:27.160 --> 54:32.160]  here, they vaccinate him like as soon as they come out in the hospital and he
[54:32.160 --> 54:35.920]  was fine. And they had him in that little, you know, like the little incubator
[54:35.920 --> 54:39.080]  kind of table. They had him in the next unit. They had him in the little,
[54:39.080 --> 54:42.640]  little warmer. Yeah. And they gave him the vaccination and he just, like you
[54:42.640 --> 54:47.080]  said, convulsions, flat line heart monitor, you know, was code pink. Every
[54:47.080 --> 54:51.240]  doctor in there and they resuscitated him. And he's, you know, he's never
[54:51.240 --> 54:56.120]  been, never been a normal baby since, right? Well, I know there's a lot of
[54:56.120 --> 55:01.360]  science behind this, but let's just explain what's happening here. Until
[55:01.400 --> 55:06.240]  about, I know Canada was forever, but until about 10 years ago in the US, no
[55:06.240 --> 55:10.000]  hospital would give a vaccine to a preemie baby because they knew this
[55:10.040 --> 55:14.680]  happened. But it's part of a eugenics operation where they just try to get
[55:14.680 --> 55:19.920]  the nurses in the hospitals to go along with it to see what medical
[55:19.920 --> 55:24.400]  tyranny can implement incrementally by successive approximation. So this is,
[55:24.400 --> 55:28.400]  this is all ambient background that they just turn up like the frog in the
[55:28.400 --> 55:31.600]  pot. And then this is what you're telling is so important for people that
[55:31.600 --> 55:35.440]  don't understand or know how serious this is until they experience the death
[55:35.440 --> 55:38.440]  of their own child or their child getting brain damage or their child having
[55:38.440 --> 55:42.360]  a convulsion. We've had multiple shows years ago and I want to get those
[55:42.360 --> 55:45.520]  nurses back on or have those nurses contact us again. And we got their
[55:45.520 --> 55:50.160]  IDs. We proved they were RNs. Some of them were head nurses where in the US
[55:50.160 --> 55:53.880]  now, since Obama got in, they have the policies and Trump needs to reverse
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.000]  these. The National Institutes of Health and others to the bioethics
[55:58.000 --> 56:02.120]  boards, that they give preemies, including babies that weigh two
[56:02.120 --> 56:08.240]  pounds, all the shots. Now, in almost every case, the babies die. But the
[56:08.240 --> 56:11.840]  nurses still do no harm. They follow the order. They give the shot. They're
[56:11.840 --> 56:14.440]  told, well, it's for the greater good. So they don't get sick off something
[56:14.440 --> 56:18.600]  else, even though they have fetal immunity. Then they defibrillate, they get
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.120]  them back, but usually causes so much brain damage because of oxygen loss.
[56:23.120 --> 56:26.560]  A couple of minutes, there's serious problems. Then the undeveloped
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.240]  stomachs, it causes autoimmune disorders because everything your body
[56:31.240 --> 56:34.640]  learns an immunity to that is the pathogen that's attenuated. It also
[56:34.640 --> 56:38.840]  learns an immunity to whatever else is in the shot. So it wrecks their gut.
[56:38.840 --> 56:42.760]  Then that creates different toxic syndromes in the gut. This is medical
[56:42.760 --> 56:47.120]  fact, which causes a toxicity in the brain. So there's a lot of detox
[56:47.120 --> 56:53.400]  things people do, and yes, iodine, B12, exercise, things like that. They're
[56:53.400 --> 56:58.200]  overstimulated because it causes autoimmune response in the brain, causes
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.640]  damage in the cerebral cortex. So the cerebral cortex is unable to filter
[57:02.640 --> 57:06.440]  out everything it's getting from the larger subconscious parts of the
[57:06.440 --> 57:10.160]  brain, the other sections of the brain. Of course, this is all lay stuff I'm
[57:10.160 --> 57:15.880]  putting out, but a basis in all the deep research. And so they know full well
[57:15.880 --> 57:19.440]  what they're doing. The nurses and doctors don't. Now, when you say no, I'm
[57:19.440 --> 57:24.800]  not taking the vaccines to them, they'll suddenly go, I don't give to my kids
[57:24.800 --> 57:28.240]  either. You know, a lot of the kids die in here, but you know, we're just
[57:28.240 --> 57:32.120]  told there we lose our jobs. So everybody knows this, you're just not
[57:32.120 --> 57:35.800]  supposed to say it. So when I come back and let you finish, then I'm going to
[57:35.800 --> 57:40.960]  everybody else. But that was a very important call. I want to ask him what
[57:40.960 --> 57:45.160]  happened when when his son died in front of them. Did they try to deny it was the
[57:45.160 --> 57:46.840]  vaccine and the National Health Service?
[57:49.720 --> 57:53.320]  Since the beginning, secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas. Now

[59:49.960 --> 59:57.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:28.520]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones. We're talking to a father up with the
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:33.880]  National Health Service. And there is no law in Europe, no law here, no law. You've
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:38.040]  got to take shots. They will lie to you and tell you there's a law. There's a
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.240]  regulation they have to give you a waiver. Now they're trying to declare
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.480]  emergencies in Europe and the US, places like New York, and make you take
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.440]  vaccines. But it's the illegal aliens bringing in the strains and in many
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.400]  cases people that have the vaccines are getting what they're supposedly being
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.200]  protected from. The truth is it's a covert operation of the eugenics groups,
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.240]  the same ones that put cephalos and vaccines for black people and others
[01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.880]  around the country in the world. And if you let shadow government, secret
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.200]  government, deep state that's involved in all this continue to put in your body
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:13.760]  wherever they want, you're crazy. So what did they say? I mean go back and tell
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.240]  us. I know it's hard to relive but it's important for people to hear this so they
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:20.440]  don't not let their kids get you know hurt that people need to know what's
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.360]  happening here how serious this is. Describe what happened is describe what
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:30.520]  the so-called doctor said. Well like I said I like my my wife had just had them
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.760]  and so she was over on the table and they had moved them to the little
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.480]  incubator table and I was actually over there you know consoling her and you
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:44.800]  know being with her and I just seem like you know I just heard like code pink
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.120]  code pink and then all these doctors come running in and I've seen the nurse
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:52.680]  pulling away with the vaccine needle and he just like right away he just flat
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.720]  lined right and then they like you said they resuscitated them and you know
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:04.680]  he's been autistic ever since but like for me I knew thanks to you that about
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.760]  the dangers of vaccines so right away I knew what it was and I started just like
[01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:13.720]  you know freaking right out and they like removed me and you know I never
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:18.520]  really got an explanation just my son was in intensive care for a few weeks and
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:22.640]  they probably gave him more shots when you aren't there. Exactly like and the
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.800]  thing is they love killing babies you know they busted a lot of nurses
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.560]  secretly killing babies there's also some nurses or psychotics they like to
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:33.240]  kill babies and that's kind of the mad doctor that's above that most doctors
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:38.640]  hospitals are nice people but they follow the orders of the bioethics boards. Go
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.000]  ahead sir. If your kids aren't vaccinated you they don't go to school like
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.800]  with I have another son one year younger who I never got vaccinated like I'm
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:51.120]  native so and I come from British Columbia like in the bush pretty much.
[01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:55.080]  Oh well there you go and I'm not saying this to be leftist and patronized left
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:59.600]  won't tell you this you know Canada has the most vicious history of attacking
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:04.000]  Native Americans of anybody killing them secret death camps mass graves have been
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.240]  found but they've been killing people just since the 90s and so oh no wonder
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:11.840]  you were probably your son was probably targeted that probably the fact that he
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.120]  flatlined so instantly just means he was tough they were probably trying to
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.120]  kill him. Well and I have another son who we had like you know probably nine
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:25.840]  and a half months later and I was smart I kind of went back home had him naturally
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.160]  like my wife I literally had him in a river you know in the river where we're
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:34.120]  from and like the way that my people used to do it and never got him
[01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:39.120]  vaccinated and then I started working back in the city and when I came like my
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.520]  kid wasn't allowed in school like I he was about eight years old when he got
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:47.560]  vaccinated finally but it was I was lawyers and child protective services
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.960]  over it and you know literally they said you know he's not going to school and I
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.200]  literally had to vaccinate him even though you know. Yeah well they lied to
[01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:58.720]  you they got the waiver forms up there too let me tell you none of the rich
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.840]  people are getting the shots or they're getting special shots so now it all makes
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.720]  sense so I guess you still kind of live in a quasi-tribal area? Yeah well yeah I
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:13.160]  live in Vancouver but I'm from like a little well you mean you understand
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:18.280]  since the 20s all over the Western world they set up eugenics offices and so all
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:24.440]  those health departments all the CPS all of those social workers were set up in
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:29.760]  England out of Malthus to poison and exterminate poor people but that's
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.160]  official history books so see and I know I know you this sounds insane a lot of
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.040]  the social workers are low-level they don't know but the ones above it in the
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:43.920]  bioethics boards are eugenicists period and you know I even had Robert Barnes
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:47.320]  in there last week talking about when he was at Yale he was you know one of the
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.480]  top people in the class they pulled him aside the secret meeting and said we want
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.320]  to kill all the black people and he said no I'm not for that we'll be right back
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:56.840]  God bless you sir I really appreciate your cool
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:01.760]  our grandparents and great grandparents knew that they can't food during the
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:05.960]  falls they'd have it during the winter and that's what I'm talking about at

[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:16.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:49.180]  all right we've had him on before Roosh V the
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.640]  building's two segments I'm going to wrap back to your calls and news I
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.240]  appreciate those folks holding a lot of great points from the callers already in
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:07:05.040]  last hour Roosh V got banned off Amazon and he writes men's self-help books and
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:09.840]  is basically an anti-feminist because feminism is really about the left big
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:14.440]  universities and government controlling women and breaking up the family but
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:17.840]  even if he wrote bad stuff I mean doesn't he have a right to publish it a
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:21.760]  right to sell it and then Amazon becomes 90% of the book market and then
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.420]  they say well he can't be there well whose book will be banned next well he
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:29.800]  announced a national speaking term and so they're moving to take his bank
[01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:34.680]  accounts away and so much more so I thought we might get him on to talk
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:40.480]  about that but it dovetails with this big thick report out of the New York
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:47.320]  Times today from Chris Hughes one of the co-founders at the very beginning
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:56.920]  the fact the co-founder of Facebook and he gets into the fact that Zuckerberg
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:04.600]  aggressively since it began will not let other competing softwares or systems
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:17.920]  be on the site by users and that he will not also let any company basically
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.920]  flourish out there without buying it or doing a hostile takeover and that why
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:27.160]  hasn't the federal government and the antitrust office stopped this when it is
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.800]  now a global monopoly and abusing it and censoring people now his answer of
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.920]  course is the more of a leftist model breaking it up it'll be just as bad
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.480]  they're just jealous that Zuckerberg is in actual control of this company and
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:43.000]  it's so powerful so the globalists are muscling in even though Zuckerberg is a
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.920]  globalist to try to make him given to what they want that's why Trump and the
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:53.480]  Republicans in action on all of this in in saying you can't regulate any company
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:58.840]  is allowing the Chinese government the EU government Hollywood and the left to
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:02.680]  come in with what they want from the company and the companies just under
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:07.640]  threat are adopting the anti-free speech surveillance model that Zuckerberg
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.280]  already wanted so Zuckerberg's playing a please don't throw me in the briar
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:17.320]  patch type scenario so coming up after we talked our gas take a bunch of calls
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:21.120]  it'll be next hour I'm gonna get into it's time to break up Facebook and this
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:28.800]  big 24-page report that is partly true part of it very very deceptive but it's
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:36.520]  shows the political moment that we've gotten to as a nation and a world and he
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:40.240]  also admits in here that Facebook reads all your private messages sells them to
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:47.080]  thousands of groups and doesn't let you send me the messages you want to send so
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.480]  this is just them coming out and admitting it all oh we banned the term
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.600]  Alex Jones unless you're being negative about him so they're not just saying
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:00.520]  we're gonna ban certain terms they're telling you unless you say about those
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.320]  things what we want you to say that is beyond a new world that is beyond the
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:11.120]  Soviet Union that is beyond any fiction or any real world we've ever seen but
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:15.480]  because we're familiar with the devil Facebook it's had its arm around her
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.800]  shoulder for a decade or longer we accept you know Albert sphere the German
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:27.400]  Interior Minister and Hitler's architect only only people not given a long
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.320]  prison sentence after World War two and it's because he was a civilian and he
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:36.120]  said he later said I realized Hitler was evil but he said you don't realize it's
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:40.640]  the devil when he's got his arm around your shoulder and that's it when you
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.800]  habitualize something whether it's a bottle of whiskey that's killing your
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.760]  liver or whether it's a woman you're having sex with this guy syphilis the
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.840]  point is you don't really get it because your brain doesn't interpret it as that
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:58.280]  but even Sean Parker of Facebook said we designed it to manipulate dopamine to
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.240]  make you depressed and dominate your life but enough of that
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:09.840]  Roush V. Roush Valizadeh has been promoting masculinity and helping men
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:14.720]  connect with women since 2001 there was books videos and website his dating
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.120]  advice has been labeled hate speech by the media and has been de-platformed by
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:24.120]  PayPal Shopify discuss among others Amazon band nine of his 19 books of the
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:30.880]  past and now he's being banned from basic activity banking you name it so
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:34.400]  Roush V. thank you for joining us fellow thought criminal and tell us the
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:39.360]  latest it is great to be on Alex I hope you don't mind I may break down like
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:43.720]  Laura Loomer did the other day I may start crying and yelling so if I go over
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.040]  the edge tell me it's okay but I was recently I was banned on Tuesday from
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:55.960]  Instagram I had a private account they still banned me I also was banned from
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:03.840]  Chase we pay to sell tour tickets so the second I wanted to organize offline the
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:09.040]  hammer is coming down it's pretty clear that not only is it getting harder just
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.840]  to maintain a presence on the internet the second you want to do a lecture tour
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:21.160]  they are going to come come after you so I don't start going on tour until late
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:26.880]  June but I'm ready for them to apply the heat in a similar way that they did to
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:31.920]  you and for those that haven't read their history books I mean this is beyond
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.640]  Soviet Union Nazi Germany the amount of surveillance they've got and the fact
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:39.680]  that they're just doing it with all big tech working in coordination this isn't
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.720]  just antitrust this is classical mafia racketeering yeah and they must have
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:51.200]  operatives or agents that are following everything that we do because there
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.920]  hasn't even been any buzz for the tour I'm going I haven't even started it yet
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:13:01.200]  but within 24 hours they are already starting it they're already starting to
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.360]  come after me so they won't even allow you to move a single inch what what this
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:11.200]  tells me is they want complete domination over you complete domination to
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.440]  maintain the narrative that they believe is true which is not it's an
[01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:21.120]  inversion of everything that is true so I'm kind of at a loss on what to do
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.240]  because I know that heat is going to get hotter so I look to you because you've
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:31.000]  you have sustained way more than me and you're and you are still here and I'm
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:34.840]  glad that you are but well it's only I'm gonna tell you and I'm not just kissing
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.640]  their butt I'm 100% my audience's hands and of course God oversees that but
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:43.080]  that is because we have a very large audience they understand what's
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:47.160]  happening they've gotten motivated they promote the links by hand but but I'm
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.240]  unable though to really go out into a speaking tour anywhere because they'll
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:54.040]  bomb threat the place they'll try to attack it they'll threaten but as you
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:14:00.480]  said Chase is banning you they've now announced just this week that they're
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:04.680]  they're hiring what they call human rights boards Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.080]  cults to now be inside Mastercard and they put alarms on people's accounts to
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.000]  see with named individuals in these accounts who's spending money with them
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:18.360]  so that's what the alarms are they've already set them up so see via a company
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:22.200]  called G2 out of Boston when the Southern Poverty Law Center lists you
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.600]  without a judge jury or whatever they then list you as a actual terrorist so
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.520]  you're put in there as international terrorist in a database so that's what
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.320]  they're doing to you my friend you know I think at the end of the day we have to
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.040]  be mentally prepared to lose everything I mean they are going there they're not
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:43.080]  gonna stop as long as you continue to conduct your your show and I continue to
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:48.080]  fight them I mean all we have is the shirt that we are wearing and even that
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:51.880]  once things get really bad I think they're gonna try to put us into some
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:55.640]  kind of camp I mean where does this go it's pretty clear they are aggressive
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:15:00.400]  now because they feel that victory for them is in sight so to make sure that
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.640]  victory for them is secured I think that's why we're seeing such a
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:10.240]  quickening of the pace against people like us that's right I mean we can go to
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.680]  any university we're not cherry picking and the students looking act like
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:18.320]  zombies almost all of them and they all say we don't want to just take your
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:25.320]  speech we want to kill you I mean what I mean I'm scared but I mean I don't want
[01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:32.040]  to scare you but I think we're not that far away from really targeted physical

[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:18.200]  listening to the Alex Jones show by the year 2019 governments and major
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:23.240]  corporations were working together whether the communist China or the EU
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:28.440]  actively against their populations. Millions of Americans are now having
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:33.920]  their bank accounts taken from NRA members were being fired from their
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.560]  jobs in Los Angeles. People learning make America great again hats for being
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:44.080]  physically attacked every day. Universities once bastions of free speech
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:53.600]  are now fortresses of censorship. Roosh V on Twitter for now at Roosh V.
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:04.640]  Roosh V.com. Roosh clearly you're one of the main targets of this I have not
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.920]  read your books I have read some of your essays and things you seem like a pretty
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:14.280]  well-spoken guy it's true on average acting confident around women and some
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.000]  of the things I've read you say is what women like and of course most these
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.520]  leftist women have their cuck husband that takes care of them while they've
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:27.760]  got two or three alpha males if they're good-looking you know gangbam I mean I
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:32.520]  mean you write stuff like that or I mean what is it's got them so mad at you. No
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:38.880]  no I mean I focus on helping men be as masculine and attractive as they can
[01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:43.320]  to women. Okay but I mean but I mean if you but listen I mean the major porn
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:47.640]  sites that are like working with Google and everybody porn hub admittedly have
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:52.480]  real torture porn and women being beaten up by 50 men and you know I've
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.680]  read the reports and being their intestines hanging out of their rare
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:59.080]  ends okay and that's all liberal and loving okay and they have satanic
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.800]  rituals all over the country where they you know smash men's testicles with
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:06.320]  hammers and they make movies about it and called hell Satan and worship it so
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.040]  the left gets all their free speech to have women prolapsing out on tables on
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:14.240]  you know you know for kids to see or whatever and this that's everywhere so
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.760]  so did you do that why are you banned is that you don't have women prolapsing
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:25.760]  what's wrong. I mean what did you do that's so bad. I just try to tell men to be
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:30.960]  the best catch they can so attractive women choose them so attractive women
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.520]  want to be with them want to be in a relationship with them just try to teach
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.200]  men to harness their natural mass masculinity so your crime is that you're
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:45.720]  your crime is they admit Netflix the computer smartphones are making men and
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:49.720]  women not have sex it's ending the species which it was designed to do and
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.000]  so you're encouraging men to have the tools and confidence to go out and find
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.880]  a mate so your crime is is that you don't want to depopulate the earth right
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:02.720]  and the major crime is that I teach men to abide by the natural order I teach
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:08.600]  men that men should be masculine women should be graceful and feminine and by
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.920]  doing that you glorify the archetypes that'll mean interrupt you I didn't know
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:16.360]  I'm trying to be grosser for radio and TV viewers I was 16 I was in
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.240]  trouble I was kicked out of school I was sent to East Texas for a large animal
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:24.720]  vet second day on the job we go out to take care of a cow that had a prolapse
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:30.560]  now then I go see a movie called hell Satan and and they're praising it as
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.640]  something that's good for everybody to see and they've got basically stuff like
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:38.680]  that going on so what I'm saying is is that is that they the left is pushing
[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.240]  the most vicious savage horrible things that hurt women as empowering women and
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.000]  I was expecting that you were like you know 50 shades of gray but you're not
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.160]  50 shades of gray telling girls to get tied up by men they don't know that's
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.480]  okay but you're just trying to bring men men and women together so that's why
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:57.240]  you're banned yeah because what they're doing right now they're pushing this
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:24:02.960]  anally centered lifestyle and I don't do that I say a man should be with a woman
[01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:08.880]  in a normal way and that they don't agree with and they're attacking me I mean
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.400]  I'm just tired of all this obsession over the butt all the gay obsession and
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.400]  that's what they're trying to push but a man who is straight is saying hey guys
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.720]  here's how to meet a woman and they lose and they go bonkers oh wait a man so you
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:33.200]  criticized you criticized anal sex I believe that's that had that homosexual
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.840]  activity shouldn't be a virtue that is elevated above heterosexuals so now we
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.920]  know your real crime okay now I understand well you know whatever happened
[01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:49.160]  the first amendment you know that exists in word only but if there is not a
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:53.960]  government if there is not a cultural elite that wants to back it that wants
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:25:01.560]  to enable it then it it's it's dead it's dead and as you know as I know free
[01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:07.320]  speech doesn't exist it doesn't it's a joke it's a sham and all the people who
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:12.880]  said oh free speech is fine you can say whatever you want they've never exerted
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.600]  their free speech because they're saying exactly what they were trained in
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:21.560]  program to say so but if you really speak the truth you're gonna feel it and
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:26.440]  you're gonna feel it quickly no I agree I'm just saying I see the left teaching
[01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:30.920]  kids the most vile stuff they've got nine and ten and eleven year old kids up
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:35.920]  dancing at gay bars and talking about ketamine they've got movies where you
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:39.600]  go see it where men are having their testicles you know lanced and crushed I
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.600]  don't want to talk about stuff like that but that's mainline movie theaters now
[01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:47.920]  but you can't praise heterosexuality you are being banned from having a bank
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:52.720]  account this is just criminal you know and I don't want to say Alex that I'm
[01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:58.400]  the most moral man I have had a lot of fun with girls and travel but the way
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.720]  the establishment attacks me they're pushing me up as yeah I guess I am some
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:10.920]  kind of moral guy if these evil people these people who are trying to sexualize
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:17.760]  young kids by sending drag queens drag queens to groom them I mean got maybe I
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:22.960]  am some kind of moral person even though I never intended that but the times are
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.360]  getting so evil that if you just want to lead a normal life if your man who just
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:33.160]  wants to lay in bed with a woman who you love and have a family without giving
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:38.520]  them toxins and vet and vaccines well they are gonna get you they're gonna get
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:43.640]  you so the only thing we can do is to is what we're doing now is to raise the
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:49.400]  consciousness of people to where enough people just say no this is enough well
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.080]  let's not say this I haven't read all your books but I know people always take
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.280]  out of context what I say or I say something tongue-in-cheek and then they
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.160]  twist that and all I know is it doesn't matter you should be able to sell
[01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:04.000]  whatever books you want you should be able to have public events wherever you
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:10.480]  want if it's not illegal what you're doing it should be allowed instead I've
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.760]  gone through all this stuff more people are going through it now they want to go
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:18.040]  after the NRA and their members California is trying to pass laws LA has
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.680]  as I'm sure you know to out NRA members in the newspaper who work for government
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:26.320]  or have government contracts so now they're saying you won't get a government
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.800]  contract for lay in cement or cleaning windows or doing the carpet job if
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:36.280]  you're in the NRA we're being terrorized as a political class and we need
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:44.120]  Congress and others to act you know I studied the Russian Revolution of 1917 I
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:50.080]  highly recommend people read the Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhenitsyn
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.480]  and that's what they're doing here they are doing the same this the Soviets are
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:01.560]  doing what they had to endure in Russia they're doing it to us now the same kind
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.960]  of people are doing this so I think mentally and spiritually we have to get
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:12.400]  ready for a big change coming up and I think it's gonna happen soon because as
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:17.160]  as we talked about they're trying to speed in up the pace so they can dominate
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:22.840]  everyone and everything they want total control and they won't stop until they
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.680]  get it that's right tyranny has come to America and Trump has to do more than
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:30.960]  tweet about it he will lose the 2020 election I have no doubt via fraud if he
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.640]  doesn't take antitrust action a racketeering action there's so many

[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:59.240]  phone calls here in just a second and then I'm going to after we take a bunch
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:03.960]  of calls as quickly as possible get into this extremely lengthy but extremely
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:11.080]  revealing article 24 pages out of the New York Times where the co-founder of
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:16.280]  Facebook admits everything we've been saying about Facebook but of course his
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:22.240]  solution is not good you know I could do a whole special three hours on this and
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:27.000]  read each paragraph and then analyze what's really going on because this just
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.760]  confirms so much what we already know but this is amazing amazing and this
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:38.960]  feller again was just still in Facebook just a few years ago and is the co-founder
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:48.640]  of Zuckerberg and in a nice way he tells you old zucky thinks he's God and he's
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:52.760]  got the establishment now jealous of him they're getting ready to carve him up
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:59.160]  like a Christmas ham and divide him up here's the problem they're gonna do even
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:06.960]  worse stuff with it once they've done that so we need to really have Trump and
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:13.360]  the American people decide how this surgery is gonna go on surgery with
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:19.600]  no anesthesia of course a big sarcastic them a little fun there but
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.840]  that's all coming up in the next hour after I get to a lot of your phone
[01:35:26.840 --> 01:35:38.640]  calls a lot more I'm just gonna leave it at this I want to go to your calls our
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:44.640]  listeners have really come through in a lot of big ways and it's touched my
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:51.120]  heart and I don't really feel like I have ways to thank you enough for standing
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:54.800]  with us and understanding just how serious the times are and I salute you
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:58.560]  because you heard that first caller and I appreciate you all holding because I
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:06.520]  had him over two segments we talked about a son dying until he was
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:18.400]  resuscitated after his first vaccines now I have interviewed hundreds of
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:26.120]  people this has happened to I have interviewed hundreds of doctors in fact
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:28.640]  you could say probably ten years ago for a couple years my mission was
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:37.960]  vaccines because we know the facts we've borrowed into it but just a call like we
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:45.600]  had to hear that and how serious all this is lets all of us understand just
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:52.880]  how high the stakes are and the corporate media gets up there and they lie
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:59.280]  and they say there's never been one side effect corporate media gets up there
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:05.760]  and says nobody's ever been hurt and the vaccines say they can kill you on the
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.360]  insert and they have a giant secret court that's paid out billions in a year
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.040]  to the hundreds of thousands of admitted damaged people and it's in the
[01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:22.880]  millions and then almost every member of my family has gotten super sick or
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.480]  almost died after they took flu shots or tetanus shots and my dad is a retired
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:32.240]  physician and he had all these patients some of what she'd done 10 20 years and
[01:37:32.240 --> 01:37:40.600]  come in because my dad would halfway roll his eyes at me 20 years ago and say
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:44.360]  well there's cost of benefits but I know there's I know there's side effects
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:50.040]  just you know tough enough well he saw so many patients coming over the years
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:55.760]  that would get the flu and die one week after a flu shot where's Bertha she
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:38:02.440]  did I remember was about six years ago he said son it's incredible he goes a
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.400]  bunch of my patients have gone and gotten shingles vaccines that's basically
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:14.560]  herpes on your body none of your generals the virus and he said I've got more
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.520]  than 50 patients have come in the last few months you all went this big push
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:24.560]  for shingle shots to AARP they all went and got shots and man they've all got
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:31.040]  shingles and some are dying and he said so for the first time I'm actively
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:35.680]  telling my patients don't take vaccines and you just got to see it before
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:43.680]  yourself my dad was pro-fluoride he goes son it's calcium fluoride you need it
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:47.960]  you die it's good for your teeth I've seen it which is totally true but as soon
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:52.960]  as he finally read articles from toxicologist about how they take toxic
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:57.240]  waste and call it fluoride and it's electrified fluoride hydrofluoresic
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:01.160]  acid he's like what they put grin right be a and he went and looked it up and
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.200]  then he freaked out he goes oh this is insane they're putting toxic waste in the
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:08.160]  water and I'm like yeah dad just cuz you're a nice guy doesn't mean the
[01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.640]  people running things are and he's like I know I just can't believe they get away
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.560]  with that and my dad and already knew this stuff before I was born but people
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:23.280]  want to comply they want to go along I get it but you can't do it with something

[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:28.080]  know once every other day or so good product helps with the mental clarity
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:35.880]  my main call was about these lip tards what what triggers them as far what
[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.640]  puts them in that mindset is it something like in the water is it the
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:45.960]  TV shows that they're watching that turns their brain to a certain yes level
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:49.840]  on average of the colleges it's arrested development they're taught that
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.320]  they're the elite they're taught there's always horrible demons everywhere and so
[01:40:53.320 --> 01:40:57.560]  they finally see some that doesn't agree with them all of their tribal energies
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:01.320]  and warfare energies that are still pathetic and it badly directed are now
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.680]  for the first time in their life they're gonna have that schoolyard fight they
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:10.720]  didn't have at 13 they're gonna have it at 20 and they're also so entitled they
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:14.760]  believe they can hit you I mean there's hundreds of videos well they'll hit you
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:18.280]  you hit them back they call the cops the cops show up they go well I hit this
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:22.360]  Nazi and then he hit me back and the cops arrest them it's like the woman that
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.360]  grabbed down by the genitals and said yeah I'm gonna rape you the cops arrested
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:30.040]  her she's like but I'm a royal person you can't arrest me so it's entitlement
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:35.320]  it's laziness it's stupidness I mean what do you think it is I don't know
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:40.600]  because I've even seen old Democrats in their 70s and you mentioned Trump and
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:45.120]  they're just like oh I hate that guy but they can't tell you why it's a feeling
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:50.640]  because these are TV heads these people watch TV 8 9 10 hours a day and they
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:54.480]  just sit there on their ass and they just they're jellyfish I mean I have to
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:57.840]  say it they're really really scary people and they also been told we're all
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:42:03.080]  Russian agents and so these are the followers and so what's happened is in
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:06.880]  this modern world we've all been taught to acquiesce the big corporations and
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.080]  the followers they have instead of saying no and so their political correctness
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:15.400]  we've acquiesced over and over again until now they feel very emboldened they
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.600]  feel like it's their time to take over now what do you think yeah okay that's
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:24.600]  that's true the other thing I wanted to talk real quick is that Trump on his
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:30.880]  book the way that he's getting over the over the establishment they're so
[01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.360]  arrogant that they can even read his books and understand that with his
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:40.000]  mindset because he likes confusion and then he walks around the circle and he
[01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:43.960]  starts to pick one by one off and they don't even understand how he how he's
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:49.080]  doing it but in his books if you read his books you can get a mindset of how
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:52.800]  this man thinks and I totally agree I read a couple of Trump's books once he
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:58.920]  became president and you can see his tactics in motion getting your protein

[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:25.480]  Alexa pure breeze which is right now $50 off the Alexa pure breeze
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:30.680]  groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology and we've got a limited
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:34.600]  quantity of these left right now we're basically selling these at cost because
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:39.080]  there was a big overhaul go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:44.720]  for yourself I've got two in my home you will notice the difference ladies and
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:50.960]  gentlemen with the Alexa pure breeze in your house don't live in a polluted
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:59.080]  major city in your home have clean air go to info wars store com the globalist
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.680]  know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment for
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:07.760]  the bad halogens fluoride chlorine bromide you name it that it lowers IQ it
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:12.560]  literally dumps the population down and on our quest to bring our listeners and
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:17.480]  viewers the best I don't in the world we've gone through two permutations first
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:21.680]  seaweed based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalist
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:25.560]  tried to block us getting a supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals of
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:30.520]  pure nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible now due to the
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:35.000]  establishment trying to block that we did more research and secured more of the
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.560]  deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine but chemists scientists and others showed
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:43.680]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds two forms of
[01:45:43.680 --> 01:45:50.440]  iodine and vitamin C it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:53.800]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it it's an
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:46:00.320]  incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com I want to say brain force
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.280]  is great I want to say turbo force is amazing it is but if you took it with
[01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:09.760]  fish oil it's like the fish oil is it the fish oil is better than it and that's
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:14.760]  an example of what I'm talking about fish oil is liquid energy brain body
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:18.800]  heart the cleanest the best out there you've got the children's you've got the
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.880]  adults you've got the krill oil if you're gonna get the full effect the fish
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.840]  oil and the children's are really strong they don't give you the burpees but
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:28.920]  krill oils is the best and it'll give you the damn burps and I'm sorry you want
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:32.600]  something like this you don't get stuff for free the krill is hallucinogenic it's
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:35.680]  so good it might be I'm not a medical statement here but let me tell you something
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.080]  I eat five capillates of krill oil before I go to bed I'm seeing Santa Claus that
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:50.560]  night so your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is so we don't make a
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:53.760]  big profit off of it but you know as I just obsessed cuz whatever the best is
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:58.440]  we've got I just can't lie to you I just can't do it
[01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:20.400]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:52.000]  right now I just want to make this statement thank you again I'm your
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.320]  host Alex Jones it's knowing history and knowing the admission of big
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:00.960]  tech and the admission of these governments and the fact that they're
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.680]  usurping our prosperity our freedom that they're anti-human they want a giant
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:11.960]  dumb-down massive people I mean it's really mind-blowing to realize that we're
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:18.400]  at this point and there's not a greater or more serious resistance to all this
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:22.320]  and that's why they want to show off the air because we're a focal point for you
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:26.800]  the resistance to all this corruption so right now let's go back to your phone
[01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:35.800]  calls let's go ahead and go to Jason in Tennessee Jason you're on the air go
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:43.920]  ahead hey Alex glad hey Alex mm-hmm are you familiar with that and you'll
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:52.400]  stress um yes so you'll stress isn't banned and but we should be is white
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:57.600]  white think that is you self-author of the game the biggest pick-up bars out
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.480]  there the rush fee is banned because he's a rape advocate you're literally
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:07.720]  having a rape advocate on air and he's no research this guy used to pull up at
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:12.920]  two seminars driving a rape band telling me he could rape women I mean it's
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:19.280]  it's not well your phone's breaking up but I heard what you said we didn't
[01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.920]  censor your call and I didn't know that I don't know that's true but I'll look
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:26.360]  into it because when I'm reading these news articles I didn't see that I just
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:29.360]  see articles about people being banned and of course people say a lot of things
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:35.840]  about me that aren't true as well so I I appreciate your call you know I actually
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:39.080]  know Neil Strauss when we first said his name was like who's Neil Strauss I've
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:45.360]  met him before he's been a town to actually come interview me and when he
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:50.360]  wanted to write a book about me they got the publisher and everything set up and
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:55.240]  the CNN harassed a bunch of people and they fired the agent that was making the
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:50:00.920]  deal it was a big liberal so it's just amazing the amount of oppression that's
[01:50:00.920 --> 01:50:06.200]  going on but if I do have rush V back on I'll look that up and I'll bring that up
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:12.080]  to him so I appreciate your call all right who is up next here I saw you
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:16.560]  disagreed with Roche V so I got you on runaway but then it just turned into that
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:19.760]  you're just so angry at me I mean you were able to call in and tell us what
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:22.880]  you said I don't know what you're talking about but I'll look into it let's go
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:32.360]  ahead and talk to California and Indiana California welcome hey Mr. Jones shout
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.160]  out to all my info or is an Indiana I'll plug for you man I haven't eaten a land
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:41.800]  animal in almost 20 years and your secret 12 is awesome I wanted to make a
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:46.080]  point about Facebook but real quick as far as social credit scores go I haven't
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:49.840]  ever had a Facebook account or any social media account but someone said that
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.560]  Google my name recently and there's a company called my life so if you Google
[01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:58.120]  your name Alex Emmerich Jones and put my life after it there's a company called
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:03.760]  my life and you have a social reputation score on that site and it also makes it
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:07.480]  out like you could be a sexual predator you could be you could have lands
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:12.440]  against your properties and things like that so you know they disaggregate and
[01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:16.200]  try to get any public information they can and then oh yeah that's what G2 does
[01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:22.920]  is is is that it's this banking system and I had perfect banking score and then
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:26.400]  what they do is once this other proper law center calls you a hate figure that
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:30.800]  puts you in the dangerous category and then the category is I kept showing it
[01:51:30.800 --> 01:51:34.800]  the other day but it was like bank robbers murderers child kidnappers
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:38.280]  rapist and so I guess he was saying that other guys are rapist maybe I'm a
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:42.440]  rapist now too I'm a rapist you're a rapist and and so tell me about this
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:46.120]  particular group and their so-called social score for me tell me about the
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:50.040]  name of it again it's called my life so just Google your name Alex Emmerich
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:54.120]  Jones and put in my life after it and a site will come up it's gonna have your
[01:51:54.120 --> 01:51:59.160]  picture on it you have a social reputation score of I think it was 3.4
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:03.840]  or something like that and then anybody can just find out any information so
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:07.920]  about you you know whereas you try to stay private you know someone can Google
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.040]  your name tell your age where you live the phone numbers and email addresses
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:16.280]  you've had so it's pretty you know pissed off about that but as far as Facebook
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:20.720]  goes you know we need to really break up big tech I look at social media is like
[01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:24.520]  you know the more you use the calculator the more you can't do simple math the
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:30.080]  more you use social media but your memories on some digital storage the
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.000]  more you don't actually your brain doesn't need to work anymore you don't
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.960]  even need to remember things I think that's you know the cause the downfall
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:41.720]  and dummy down of you know society and one of the big reasons why I didn't ever
[01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:45.120]  get a social media account is because I don't want to I got more things to do
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:49.440]  than waste my time sitting there monitoring other people's lives and I
[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:53.040]  surely don't want anybody wasting their time of their life sitting there
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:58.720]  monitoring my life so you know people just either need to you know we got to
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:02.440]  reach into the matrix and and reach all the people that are on there because
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:07.360]  the platform but I mean ultimately we need to boycott those things and speak
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:11.080]  to people in real life when we can but it is a great tool that we have to use
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:16.560]  it's just a it's a double-edged sword you know now it certainly is and you
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.960]  didn't just say all those things it's true social media is killing us the
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.160]  internet is killing us smartphones are mentally killing us but also radiating
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:31.200]  us and killing us 5g on record gives you cancer that's mainline news and they're
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:35.880]  just doing it to us they're pushing they knew aspartame caused strokes and heart
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:39.200]  attacks and brain damage and now major studies are out again confirming and all
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:44.200]  and they legalized it in 1980 and so we're just having all this garbage pushed
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:49.760]  on us by design on purpose and it's all the dumbest out of the populace so we
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:54.040]  can be more easily ruled and after I take some more calls I'm gonna air this
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:58.480]  milly weaver piece and have another piece of our other reporter Caitlin Bennett
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:06.280]  being attacked and again these people are hateful they're stupid they can
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:10.600]  barely talk they don't know who they are but they know they hate people they
[01:54:10.600 --> 01:54:14.200]  disagree with and that they're part of the power structure now and that you're
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:17.920]  gonna be shut up so there's these weak people that now think they've been given
[01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:22.800]  entree into power they are the useful idiots they are the brown shirt zombies
[01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:27.920]  leading the system into its full fruition and can you imagine what the
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.000]  world will be like when they're finally done it is going to be not a very nice
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.560]  place the more leftist you are the more interface with these systems you are the
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:42.040]  more brain damaged you are the stupider you are the more alone you are the more
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:46.280]  you get Alzheimer's neurological diseases it is insane okay let's go
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:52.240]  who's holding longest now let's go ahead and take a call from Patrick in
[01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:56.680]  Colorado thank you for holding it on here sure God bless you and your crew
[01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:02.520]  thanks you're doing just three quick points number one and all the stuff
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.400]  that's going on you check the news cycles on the websites whatever where is
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:11.240]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg nary a word from what's going on like oh there's a Ruth
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.320]  Bader Ginsburg site it's a fake picture from three years ago you know what's
[01:55:15.320 --> 01:55:18.920]  going on that's the way a lot of this criminality has been pushed is through
[01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:24.200]  the courts there's nary a word where where she is or what's going on yeah
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:29.600]  maybe we'll just have a hologram of her exactly well who knows all the crazy
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.320]  technologies that they don't release that are being kept back so they can
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:39.040]  implement them on us in an evil way who knows you're probably right you know so
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.320]  that's number one maybe who knows maybe you guys could have a little say da da
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.120]  da da where's Ruth because that's that's straight up just straight up a lie
[01:55:46.120 --> 01:55:50.840]  number two and this ties into what Darren your first call from Canada said
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:56.960]  the chemtrails and the vaccinations and you know having sovereignty over your
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:01.840]  body and so forth that I take x2 awesome product but dude they are
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.560]  vaccine us through the chemtrails so even if you stay and say oh well I don't
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:11.120]  I disagree sovereignty over my body I'm not going to take your shot I'm not
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.160]  going to take your pill here's the deal here's the deal I mean I grew up in
[01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:18.960]  Texas and almost nobody had allergies now 90% of people got them most people
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:24.080]  didn't hardly breathe and we know that the jet stream goes over China and dips
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.840]  in over China and basically dumps over Texas that Coriolis or that part of the
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:33.360]  jet screen that coils around the earth is reflected from China on the other
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:37.160]  side of the planet to Texas where it dumps in over central China that dumps
[01:56:37.160 --> 01:56:41.800]  over New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana and we get a lot of the toxic waste raining
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.120]  down on us well they just call that allergies and then your body when there
[01:56:45.120 --> 01:56:49.920]  is other pollen other stuff just starts rejecting everything and battling and
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.760]  fighting back we go oh everybody's got allergies no you got toxic waste raining
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.120]  down out of the sky on you and you know I love Texas a lot of nice people a lot
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:04.280]  of good folks but not a good place to live because of the toxic waste dumping
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:07.520]  out of the sky and if I had the money and if I had the funds I'd move this to
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.360]  Montana or Wyoming or someplace in you know Utah where they don't have the jet
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:17.840]  stream dumping in over Texas is getting vaporized by the chai-com factories
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:22.320]  that have no scrubbers no environmental controls it goes up into the sky it's
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:26.800]  picked up by the jet stream that stays up at 35,000 feet until it comes in over
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.120]  Texas there's lots of areas in the world where it goes up to 40 50,000 feet
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:35.440]  comes back down to you know 10,000 feet well Texas is one of those places and
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:40.680]  it just so happens that's where the stuff from China dumps so we are the
[01:57:40.680 --> 01:57:45.840]  toilet of shark I live in the chai-com toilet
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.800]  it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most

[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:41.400]  don't really care no okay if you had to choose one prominent person to be banned
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:51.000]  next who would you choose? You. After Facebook banned alex jones and
[02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.560]  Paul Joseph Watson we're here at Kent State University to see if students
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:01:06.240]  support that type of censorship against conservatives. Social media can try to
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:10.120]  ban alex jones all they want but they can't ban you from putting up these
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:15.240]  signs all around your town and supporting us at infowarsstore.com. What's your take
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:20.240]  on big tech companies centering prominent conservative voices? I think in all
[02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:25.640]  honesty like when you have certain voices making like certain remarks like
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:30.640]  alex jones says but that sometimes people will report on that and it's like
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:35.680]  you don't want to but in a way you kind of like you know if it's like something
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:39.280]  that could be seen as like scary or something then they have every right to
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:44.400]  do that it's just like what has alex jones said that's scary well he's had a
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:50.160]  lot of like stuff saying like that obama's sulfur and demons a bunch of
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:55.840]  falsified stuff do you think that's the grounds for completely deep platforming
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:01.640]  him I think in a way respectfully I think yes because okay we're gonna take
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:05.480]  your calls we come back from break I'm gonna try to get five in in this
[02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:09.680]  segment everybody's been holding at least an hour and then we're gonna
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:14.520]  continue on with your calls but I need to get to this full report of Caitlyn
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:18.920]  Bennett because every person she talked to I talked to her on the phone yesterday
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:27.000]  about this report she shows every person she talked to one person believes in
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:39.120]  free speech every person she probably talks to 20-something people one person
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.760]  and that's what I find the University of Texas and let me tell you something I
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:50.960]  don't feel big and powerful when I'm down there and these people look like
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:57.280]  zombies the only way to describe it is but they're so entitled and they repeat
[02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:02.080]  the same psycho babble anti-america stuff it's it's just very painful it's
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:06.320]  actually got me depressed because I want to think more of my countrymen and

[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:16.320]  so and every time we did it it was extremely successful and really
[02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:21.480]  spurred free speech and show the system we can circumvent them and circumnavigate

[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:50.040]  and I think I'm gonna go put some vaccine signs up in and around where
[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:57.400]  people will see them at Walgreens or at CVS well I no one gets upset when
[02:09:57.400 --> 02:10:03.400]  somebody puts something on somebody's car about a car wash or a potluck dinner
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:07.920]  or a garage sale they'll call it terrorism in the news I'm gonna stick
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:13.160]  them under people's windshield wipers the danger of vaccines and then because
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:19.080]  they're suppressing our speech it becomes legal and lawful and moral to have
[02:10:19.080 --> 02:10:23.880]  cognitive resistance to their cognitive resistance to have civil
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:30.640]  disobedience yes nobody arrests any of the people and they go to a gun shop and
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:33.960]  lay down in it and say we're shutting this place down oh they're good people
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:37.080]  but if I go lay down on a Walgreens and expose the deadly vaccines they'll have
[02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:40.800]  me arrested but we're getting to that point of the sit-ins we're getting that
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:44.400]  point of going and protesting at the big tech companies we're getting the point
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:49.240]  long ago that it's time to take action legally and lawfully and peacefully but
[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:54.080]  whatever you do post some of these signs in your neighborhood post around
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:11:01.920]  universities post them around leftist areas and you will see fireworks
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:06.600]  especially if you call the media yourself in on it they'll then show up
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:10.240]  like it's the devil and then the local public will backlash against it saying
[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:15.040]  no this is America but this is how we let them know and imagine if large parts
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:18.440]  the audience do this and become real activists which many of you already done
[02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:21.720]  that's what they're fearing is you taking action they don't fear me they
[02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:27.000]  fear you okay let's go back to your calls again thank you for holding I

[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:58.680]  out and talked yeah just feels good to embrace masculinity especially in this
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.840]  day and age I guess humanity I mean I think gardening is masculine I think you
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:06.600]  know clean in the house I mean I think just just just doing real things yeah

[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:34.640]  woman or a woman you don't have a say oh yeah that's a mind game as if one half
[02:13:34.640 --> 02:13:37.840]  the species shouldn't have an opinion on killing babies before they're born and
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:40.400]  now they want to kill babies after they're born they say we shouldn't have an
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:44.360]  opinion shouldn't a man that's with a woman have an opinion but now so they
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:47.560]  want women all alone the idea that a woman should have a kid and just a man
[02:13:47.560 --> 02:13:50.520]  shouldn't be involved period that's because they want the state involved as
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:58.560]  her pimp as her flesh-broker exactly and it's a juicy ball keep it comfortable
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:03.840]  yeah it takes two people to make a baby it's it's part of humanity and I think
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:10.080]  as men as you know part of the human race we need to start sticking up and
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:14.680]  stop falling for the the tricks absolutely if we won't take care of our
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:20.040]  babies if we won't stand up for the unborn then there's no value on human
[02:14:20.040 --> 02:14:25.840]  life and that's what it is and the left universally is a death cult they are a
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:32.640]  group of swindlers scammers and a group of wannabe power lords who desperately
[02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:37.200]  want to bully us in the submission and they are deranged and they are they are
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:42.600]  spreading like a cancer my friend anything else no I just wanted to touch
[02:14:42.600 --> 02:14:47.640]  on that and you know the the death of free speech and it's it's pretty crazy

[02:20:03.880 --> 02:20:30.360]  why are they doing this now well it's a good question as to why they waited this
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:36.280]  long but yeah exactly yeah I mean they so Alice's Alps Jones has been banned
[02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:40.400]  from Facebook for a long period of time but now they banned him they banned his
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:43.920]  like a little underling Paul Joseph Watson now that they keep them off the
[02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:48.240]  platform that's great for now but it doesn't roll back the clock but you have
[02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:51.960]  also excesses in the first amendment and the second amendment right now you know
[02:20:51.960 --> 02:20:55.320]  I don't think that the four of the forefathers said well you can say you
[02:20:55.320 --> 02:20:58.640]  know all sorts of hateful things and spread it around the world literally
[02:20:58.640 --> 02:21:02.880]  spread it through the internet I have no issue with it at all I want them shut

[02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:58.280]  talked to her yesterday right after she put this up she's so fast she put up
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:02.560]  the same day and I said let me guess the use basically showed it in the order of
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:06.560]  the people she said yeah I mean it's edited they cut it down they cut the
[02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:13.880]  spaces out but that every person she talked to is in it we're not cherry
[02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:21.160]  picking it's horrifying and tyranny's here it's out in the open now yeah we're
[02:22:21.160 --> 02:22:23.840]  killing babies after they're born yeah we're reading your email yeah we're
[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:26.440]  watching everything you do on Facebook yeah we're listening to you inside your
[02:22:26.440 --> 02:22:29.480]  house and Alex Jones is just credited for being the first person to tell you
[02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:39.560]  about it and imagine these authoritarians they want power I remember being 18 years
[02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:46.200]  old had a job my parents moved into a smaller house I was still living with
[02:22:46.200 --> 02:22:54.280]  them and my mom bought some oriental rugs and I was saying I don't like this
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:58.240]  one I don't like that one and I had my girlfriend there she was rude to my mom
[02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:02.640]  or something my mom said you're gonna be moved out of here in about a week she
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:07.280]  told my dad she was David game out of here but that was because I didn't have
[02:23:07.280 --> 02:23:10.320]  my own life now I would never tell my mom what rugs to have even I don't like
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:16.280]  them unless he has great taste I didn't have good taste what I'm saying is is
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:19.960]  that people that don't run their own lives want to run other people's lives I
[02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:23.640]  don't want to run my neighbor's lives I'm not looking over their fence because I
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:30.360]  got a life these people don't have one they're dangerous okay Patrick and mass
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:34.080]  thanks for holding thanks for calling I really appreciate that you know the
[02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:37.520]  catch 22 is we have 20 phone lines so we load them up takes a couple hours get
[02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:42.200]  to 20 calls but I think you're almost the 20th caller so Patrick go ahead hey
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:47.160]  I just want to get to the point because I know airtime is valuable this is a
[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:51.080]  call to arms for all the artists particularly musicians out there I
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:57.440]  think I have a great idea the info towards okay we all need to set up some
[02:23:57.440 --> 02:24:02.040]  shows across the country when you just spread the word as artists as musicians
[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:06.160]  because as soon as people like Alex Jones are going to be censored next it's
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:10.540]  going to be artists people might have a problem or not have a problem with Alex
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:13.560]  Jones being censored right now but they're going to have a problem when
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:16.680]  they go to the local record store and they can't buy him a call to CD and
[02:24:16.680 --> 02:24:18.920]  let's make no mistake I've been meaning to say this and I'm glad you said this
[02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:23.200]  they always pick some character that's flamboyant that they can misrepresent to
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:26.680]  demonize and then once people don't stand up for that one character that it's
[02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:32.320]  everybody and it's guaranteed art literature music that's the power I'm
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:36.240]  getting chills right now it's about all of you and the left is the most
[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:40.640]  censoring towards themselves you're absolutely right people again instinctively
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:44.840]  used to know this what happened the last 10 years where suddenly it's like a
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:50.880]  minority of people will stand up for free speech I completely agree and I'll
[02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:55.160]  tell you you know coming from Western Massachusetts or my blue hell as I like
[02:24:55.160 --> 02:24:59.800]  to refer to it as just being a Trump supporter you know it's impossible to
[02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:03.520]  get gigs out here as soon as people find that out and I think that's unfair and
[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:05.840]  I'm sure there's a lot of musicians listening right now that are
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.840]  experiencing the same problem and I think we all need to stick together we
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:12.360]  need to organize it not totally great you know there's something that makes me
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:16.840]  proud they couldn't get in two and a half years one Trump supporter who are
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:20.120]  mainly just populist libertarians not even right wingers most Trump supporters
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:24.160]  I'm not I'm really libertarian they tried they offer people millions of
[02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:28.760]  dollars everything and nobody took the so-called Russian money they couldn't
[02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:33.160]  get one Trump supporter to be unfaithful the first Democrat they talked to to
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:37.320]  taking the money but beyond that when they demonetized everybody five years
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:42.320]  ago and then since everybody two years ago almost no one I know has backed down
[02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:47.240]  and turned to their side because they've tried to bankrupt us and let me guess
[02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:51.400]  them trying to shut you down I mean did that make you want to roll over to them
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:59.120]  Patrick oh absolutely not just made me write better music absolutely but see
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:02.120]  the left though they're the conformists and I'm not just saying this to go look
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:05.840]  how good we are they're the followers and they're just pissed that we're not
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:09.160]  being a little followers like them because they're told a utopia is coming
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:16.000]  once we all think the same right and it's completely absurd and I don't know
[02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.680]  why more people aren't upset about it it you know once they take away the
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:25.000]  freedom of expression you know it's what do you have you know you don't have a
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.920]  society anymore I mean I don't want to look at a blank piece of paper I want
[02:26:28.920 --> 02:26:33.000]  to see someone paint I don't want to look at a blank music sheet I want to
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:37.440]  hear someone play some music you know I totally agree you know I should have led
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:40.360]  the show with us today I told everybody this about a year ago because I saw it
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:44.460]  in their announcement Microsoft is gonna watch all of your computers in
[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:48.800]  live time and not let you type things that it thinks are politically
[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:52.360]  incorrect but this is what's better in the fine print trying to find the
[02:26:52.360 --> 02:27:00.480]  article today in the fine print it reports back to Microsoft what you're
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:06.400]  writing what do you think of them apples well you know I recall I wish I
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:10.600]  knew where it came from but I read an article while it's actually there's
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:15.800]  robots that are scanning fans demo submissions and so if your music is not
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:21.440]  played to a metronome if your voice is not auto-tuned record labels won't even
[02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:24.920]  consider your submission it doesn't even get past that's right because it's
[02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:29.560]  gotta be ready to be read by by the digital robots right so if all these
[02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:33.520]  artists out there you know biting their tongue they don't want to cross any
[02:27:33.520 --> 02:27:37.080]  lines thinking they might get that deal you're not gonna get that deal if you're
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:41.240]  making any real music I'll tell you that right now well remember what Zuckerberg
[02:27:41.240 --> 02:27:45.080]  said this last week Alex Jones you can't say his name you can't say his website
[02:27:45.080 --> 02:27:50.280]  once it's negative Microsoft releases version of word that makes your grammar
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:56.120]  politically correct no it surveils what you're writing won't let you write what
[02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:01.280]  you want and then reports it back it's worse than Paul Watson even says how
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:05.720]  do I know because I saw this new Microsoft word a few months ago as a
[02:28:05.720 --> 02:28:12.320]  footnote in a news guard announcement where news guard excuse me is on all this
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:19.080]  this right-wing neocon warmonger group it's not just left us now censoring news

[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:32.480]  all right we're back live here I want to play large parts of this Caitlyn Bennett
[02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:36.000]  piece in this segment the next segment I'll get back to your calls and Matt
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:39.440]  Braggen's coming up and I'm gonna take a little bit of Matt Braggen's time to hit
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:42.200]  the big Facebook expose where the co-founder says that needs to be
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:45.280]  broken up that's coming up start of the next hour that Matt Braggen will take
[02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:49.440]  over at 15 after but but the thing I want to do here is I want to air this
[02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:56.240]  piece again that's up on infowars.com that everybody should really share this
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:01.960]  is college students believe in banning conservatives and again this is not a
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:08.760]  cherry-picking this is the monstrous and typhoid speech like North Korea or the
[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:16.640]  Soviet Union these are just flaming authoritarians and they're also
[02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:25.680]  extremely ignorant extremely stupid and extremely arrogant so this is what
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:32.080]  higher education is today once the bastion of free speech about is now the
[02:34:32.080 --> 02:34:37.760]  redoubt of tyrants here it is does it bother you that conservatives are being
[02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:42.720]  wiped off of big tech companies not only conservative but does it bother you
[02:34:42.720 --> 02:34:48.880]  that their speech is being infringed on no why not because it doesn't I just
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:53.000]  told you have you heard about it you haven't heard in the news all of these
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.280]  conservatives being banned off big tech companies social media again this is a
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:00.400]  little bit of the report I already played some of this earlier I understand
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:05.240]  but we're gonna start it from the beginning I want people to see it from
[02:35:05.240 --> 02:35:11.840]  the beginning full report here it is care about one political ideology being
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:18.400]  banned from the internet I don't really care no okay if you had to choose one
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:24.120]  prominent person to be banned next who would you choose you
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:31.400]  after Facebook banned Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson we're here at Kent
[02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:35.320]  State University to see if students support that type of censorship against
[02:35:35.320 --> 02:35:37.880]  conservatives
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:48.000]  social media can try to ban Alex Jones all they want but they can't ban you from
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:52.560]  putting up these signs all around your town is supporting us at infowarestore.com
[02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:57.600]  what's your take on big tech companies censoring prominent conservative voices
[02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:02.960]  I think in all honesty like when you have certain voices making like certain
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:08.760]  remarks like Alex Jones says but that sometimes people will report on that and
[02:36:08.760 --> 02:36:13.600]  it's like you don't want to but in a way you kind of like you know if it's like
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:17.480]  something that could be seen as like scary or something then they have every
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:22.600]  right to do that it's just like what has Alex Jones said that's scary well he's
[02:36:22.600 --> 02:36:28.680]  had a lot of like stuff saying like that Obama's sulfur and demons a bunch of
[02:36:28.680 --> 02:36:34.360]  falsified stuff do you think that's the grounds for completely deep platforming
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:41.360]  him I think in a way respectfully I think yes because he has had this he's been
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:47.360]  warned quite a bit I think so in a way just I did pause yeah I think so back it
[02:36:47.360 --> 02:36:55.400]  up so if it's scary to someone someone can't say it and people do report that
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:59.240]  Hillary really smells bad that's bad hygiene that sometimes Obama does too
[02:36:59.240 --> 02:37:05.240]  but I kind of push it a tongue-in-cheek they're public figures just like people
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:09.440]  run over to Caitlyn and threaten her and call her names she's a public figure
[02:37:09.440 --> 02:37:16.560]  but this is what they do let's continue you that conservatives are being wiped
[02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:21.200]  off of big tech companies not only conservative but does it bother you
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:27.400]  that their speech is being infringed on no why not because it doesn't I just
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:31.520]  told you have you heard about it you haven't heard in the news all of these
[02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:35.080]  conservatives being banned off big tech company social media I don't really
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:39.840]  watch the news where do you get most of your news Instagram that must be why
[02:37:39.840 --> 02:37:43.160]  because they're banning their voices so everybody I just listed in every
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:48.320]  organization I just listed got banned from all of social media is that bother
[02:37:48.320 --> 02:37:55.080]  you that seems like a personal problem it's personal yeah that you don't care
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:59.360]  about one political ideology being banned from the internet I don't really care
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:06.440]  no okay if you had to choose one prominent person to be banned next who
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:14.840]  would you choose you me oh that's very feminism like and tolerant what have I
[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:19.720]  done to deserve to be banned you're just a nuisance I'm not bothering
[02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:23.720]  anybody no I'm just angering you since I'm okay so because you don't like me and
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:27.360]  you think I'm a nuisance I should be completely deep thought-formed from
[02:38:27.360 --> 02:38:32.680]  everything not have a voice Twitter especially Twitter all right here you
[02:38:32.680 --> 02:38:37.520]  have it Kent State I got a five seconds you look at this person they look very
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:42.840]  unhealthy they're very soft and then she's looking inward loving herself it's
[02:38:42.840 --> 02:38:46.740]  all about her power trip and she goes into these classes until everything she
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:50.440]  wants to hear you're the new ruling class we're gonna smash them we're gonna
[02:38:50.440 --> 02:38:56.520]  put them in camps and now here she is seeing someone being polite and nice to
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:39:01.800]  her and she says I want you removed I want you shut down I want you gone it's
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:07.200]  about her power and look she looks demon-possessed they all did let's
[02:39:07.200 --> 02:39:12.320]  continue I should be completely deep thought-formed from everything not have
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:17.840]  a voice Twitter especially Twitter all right here you have it Kent State
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:24.240]  liberals feminists supporting and they all have victory parties when someone
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:29.440]  gets banned this is their power big giant mega monopolies worth trillions of
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:36.200]  dollars working with China to silence people and have public executions and
[02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:39.960]  they sit here in the lap of a once-free nation destroying that freedom that they
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:49.440]  lay around in all lazily just reveling in the end of it I'm sick of paying for
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:55.200]  their duetions I'm sick of paying for their welfare you know these are all
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:40:00.480]  slobs on welfare all going deep into that just a bunch of lazy losers all
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:03.600]  proving to each other how none of them have drive how great it is to be a
[02:40:03.600 --> 02:40:11.080]  slacker what a sack of garbage let's continue deep platform from social
[02:40:11.080 --> 02:40:19.480]  media they don't want me in Akron either were you the one at my rally like yelling
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:25.920]  yeah that was me wow are you proud of yourself I'm so proud of myself yeah so
[02:40:25.920 --> 02:40:30.120]  do you support the censorship of Alex Jones off Facebook I don't know what
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:34.600]  that is you don't know Alex Jones is no he's a prominent conservative figure has
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:38.360]  his own kind of media following they banned him on all social media do you
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:44.560]  support that well if he's like you then yeah he's a conservative so yeah he
[02:40:44.560 --> 02:40:48.240]  shouldn't be censored on social media I mean yeah if he's cussing and stuff yes
[02:40:48.240 --> 02:40:53.080]  he should so you should be censored for cussing yes I mean FCC rules you know
[02:40:53.080 --> 02:40:57.280]  that on social media you should be censored in the platform not if you're
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:02.720]  if you're like typing it I still but if you're like NFL they cuss CNN they cuss
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:11.560]  we barely even cuss and not on our FCC shows he just says that I mean just
[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:16.600]  think about this guy and again I'm sad for me he looks and acts autistic but
[02:41:16.600 --> 02:41:22.600]  these people all look deranged they all look crazy in their eyes continue he
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.760]  should be taken off all social media platforms for posting a video of him
[02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:30.640]  cussing well you're just cussing and do the guys also yelling at due to just
[02:41:30.640 --> 02:41:35.480]  something that you're known for doing so you support what kind of like what kind
[02:41:35.480 --> 02:41:40.360]  of soy do you intake every day to want to ban someone and de-platform them for
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:44.720]  cussing what kind of soy do you intake is it in the like soy shakes you take
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:50.520]  pills what is it I just take away and so I don't take so I do think President
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:54.080]  Trump should do something to hold Facebook and Instagram and YouTube
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:57.400]  accountable for their censorship and kind of discrimination against
[02:41:57.400 --> 02:42:03.720]  conservatives no not really why would he because they're a monopoly on our free
[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:07.320]  speech and how we interact with the world and everything I don't know they
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:10.080]  be tripping I don't know what's up with them Facebook just recently did a
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:14.840]  massive purge and they took Alex Jones Laura Loomer Milo Unopolis Paul Joseph
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:20.320]  Watson kind of biased what's bias about them I I really don't know I just we're
[02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:24.320]  going to break and we come back we'll get to the really dramatic conclusion of
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:28.200]  your phone calls but here's the bottom line these people are incredibly
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:35.000]  stupid they're incredibly arrogant they're shallow and they have no sense of
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:42.040]  chivalry but overall they're evil they inherently want to dominate and silence
[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:46.280]  others because wait it's coming up she hasn't gotten to the clips where all
[02:42:46.280 --> 02:42:54.800]  these people say outrageous things and get crazy looks in their eyes of power

[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:41.720]  Bennett journalist reporter politely at Kent State her alma mater where she
[02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:45.960]  graduated a year ago being openly demonized and told that she needs to be
[02:47:45.960 --> 02:47:49.680]  taken off the air as well and anybody else that disagrees with the
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:54.280]  establishment or like Donald Trump here is the dangerous fascism that has
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:58.240]  become America of course oh really so Milo you not the list Laura Loomer
[02:47:58.240 --> 02:48:03.160]  apologize of Watson Alex Jones info wars and an organization in general has
[02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:08.480]  been completely censored off the Twitter off of Instagram off of Facebook they
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:12.400]  Facebook and Instagram said that they were dangerous have you ever heard of
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:19.600]  any other people I have not you've never heard of Milo you not less I have not
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:25.080]  Alex Jones info wars I have not okay well they're being censored because
[02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:30.000]  they're conservatives does that bother you I have not not getting it doesn't
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.480]  because I don't really know them that well well it's pretty complicated to me
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:38.800]  because you know it's all predicated on hate speech what is hate speech well
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:44.040]  from my understanding I thought it was inciting violence through you know
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:49.240]  speech well that's inciting violence that's something completely different
[02:48:49.240 --> 02:48:53.520]  there is no legal definition of hate speech okay so it's really kind of
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:57.640]  subjective to ban somebody based on hate speech could you give me like an
[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:02.720]  example of what hate speech would be mmm probably not then no I don't think I
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:07.520]  could so they banned Alex Jones info wars Paul Joseph Watson Milo you
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:12.440]  not Melissa Laura Loomer for why did they they said that they're dangerous
[02:49:12.440 --> 02:49:15.760]  they're prominent conservatives all over social media what are they speaking
[02:49:15.760 --> 02:49:20.960]  on in their banning they just said that they're dangerous individuals like do
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:24.560]  you know what they're posting on social media why they're banning them like you
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:28.920]  have supportive president Trump like position I'm asking if it bothers you
[02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:32.480]  that they are being about that's why I'm asking for a better background so I can
[02:49:32.480 --> 02:49:35.520]  give a better opinion on it yes the Laura Loomer she's a conservative Jewish
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:40.280]  woman big supporter of president Trump okay Paul Joseph Watson he lives
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:43.120]  actually in the UK he's a big supporter of president Trump as well he's
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:47.960]  affiliated with info wars Alex Jones is the owner of info wars and then there's
[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:52.400]  Milo Unopolis who has been protested on campuses where they almost burned down
[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:56.960]  the entire campus because they don't like his speech okay at what point do we
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:50:00.720]  say we can't censor people based on their political ideologies well you can't
[02:50:00.720 --> 02:50:04.360]  but you can also take in consideration other people's opinions and I can tell
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.880]  you one thing the millennial group of people is growing and most millennials
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:11.920]  don't fuck with Donald Trump so that's probably why do you support Trump
[02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:14.560]  supporters getting banned on social media if they have a big following on
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:17.520]  support had no idea who you were talking about before probably gonna have no idea
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:21.000]  once we leave again but I'm saying you know now most people don't fuck with
[02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:29.200]  people who are on that why did he win do you see the news when I did if a lot of
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:34.360]  stuff like come on yeah you so you're talking about the news you get your
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:37.840]  news from Instagram you said Twitter Instagram most news I post you don't
[02:50:37.840 --> 02:50:40.880]  watch news I mean I'm sure most money don't I don't know if you guys watch
[02:50:40.880 --> 02:50:44.520]  news if you do that's great but I just I don't watch the news and based on that
[02:50:44.520 --> 02:50:47.400]  information you said you don't watch the news but you still think that Russia
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:53.000]  gate is real Russia what Russia gate yeah for sure I'm all for standing up for
[02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:59.400]  what you believe in as long as you're not okay so what is deemed as a I don't
[02:50:59.400 --> 02:51:03.720]  know whatever you stand for everybody like me should be censored yeah that's
[02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:08.360]  fine no it's very tolerant very empowering to other women so I do
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:14.720]  appreciate that you consider yourself a feminist um define feminist in your
[02:51:14.720 --> 02:51:19.600]  terms before I agreed to that what is the feminist you believe in equal rights
[02:51:19.600 --> 02:51:25.240]  for men and women and you support women you lift them up yep but you support me
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:32.600]  being censored yeah all right we got some cognitive dissonance right here
[02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:42.440]  not only is info wars being banned on social media but conservatives everywhere
[02:51:42.440 --> 02:51:47.160]  are being shunned in person as well please I'm urging you you have to go to
[02:51:47.160 --> 02:51:51.480]  info wars stored calm by a t-shirt get some supplements make sure I can keep
[02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:55.120]  doing this you ever heard about the conservatives being just completely be
[02:51:55.120 --> 02:51:59.720]  platformed not allowed to have a voice on Facebook no now that I told you does
[02:51:59.720 --> 02:52:09.080]  it scare you very cool very cool these are the leaders of our country these are
[02:52:09.080 --> 02:52:12.920]  the people that are voting these are the people that have to make decisions about
[02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:17.400]  our taxes about our guns about our property and they don't know who's
[02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:20.680]  giving them their information who's controlling it when you think of one
[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:24.160]  person off the top of your head who should be censored next of course I can
[02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:36.120]  think of people who should be censored but name one I think like anti LGBT
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:41.280]  people and think of any like big figure that should be censored always but
[02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:45.200]  that's just because I don't like you want the president censored off throw him
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:51.200]  away in total that's my opinion but again also using your platform social
[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:56.400]  media Twitter especially to say mean things hurtful things or just shady
[02:52:56.400 --> 02:53:00.600]  things as he likes to do I don't think is a professional but be not
[02:53:00.600 --> 02:53:06.600]  presidential what's a shady thing that he said I don't have a Twitter either but
[02:53:06.600 --> 02:53:09.920]  I get most of my information from Instagram social media I really use
[02:53:09.920 --> 02:53:14.040]  but I know they're banning conservative Instagram's banning conservatives too so
[02:53:14.040 --> 02:53:17.760]  that's where you're getting your information from does that concern you
[02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:24.200]  I mean you were chanting like Caitlyn Bennett would you not think that that is
[02:53:24.200 --> 02:53:29.600]  hateful and you should be censored for doing that Caitlyn Bennett so should
[02:53:29.600 --> 02:53:33.560]  you be censored for that hate speech does it hurt your feelings no it doesn't
[02:53:33.560 --> 02:53:37.360]  I think that's great because you're again they've talked to them that if
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:42.120]  something hurts somebody's feelings you look at every speech but then she plays
[02:53:42.120 --> 02:53:46.880]  all these bizarre games and again she looks completely mentally ill like she
[02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:50.680]  could be a natural born killers or something as a psychotic but really it's
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:54.040]  just a spoiled brat probably never worked today in her life just wandering
[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:57.560]  around some college where she's not learning anything but how she it's her
[02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:03.960]  right to rule and America is now hers as long as you silence people and so little
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:12.880]  soft stupid authoritarians wandering around colleges and then they go out you
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:16.800]  think well where they gonna get a job big tech city government state government
[02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:22.000]  county government bureaucrats and they all just sit back and laugh about their
[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:26.760]  power over you and they're gonna take your farm they're gonna take your business
[02:54:26.760 --> 02:54:31.120]  they're gonna take your children they're gonna take your money they're gonna take
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:34.640]  your guns they're gonna take your speech they're gonna take your birthright
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:40.480]  because you're gonna bow to them you're gonna be afraid of them because they're
[02:54:40.480 --> 02:54:44.320]  so weak and pathetic and laughing at themselves they can't believe that
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:49.160]  that they're nobodies, but that everyone bows to them.
[02:54:49.160 --> 02:54:58.760]  They're dishonorable scum, they're dangerous scum, they're the plague, they're cancer,
[02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:05.200]  but we have put up with them as soft people, just trying to make everything nice, everybody
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:13.000]  friendly, and now these giant, malice armies of idiots are ready to make their move on
[02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  us.
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:17.960]  They're the last generation of humans before the machines take over.
[02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:23.240]  This is how the AI takes over, creating that creature on screen.
[02:55:23.240 --> 02:55:24.240]  Continue.
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:34.960]  I just don't define hateful, ugly people as strong, independent women, and so therefore
[02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:40.240]  I feel like I'm entitled to whatever I say to you, but you, this doesn't count as hate
[02:55:40.240 --> 02:55:41.240]  speech.
[02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:42.240]  10 seconds.
[02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:43.720]  If you're a radio listener, you can't see this.
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:48.480]  She does this ecstasy thing, and she goes, I don't define it, and she goes, see, she's
[02:55:48.480 --> 02:55:56.600]  a god now, so Caitlin's using her own anti-female, wedded to the government, third wave feminism
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:56:02.120]  argument on her, and then she says, I don't define ugly, hateful people when she's being
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:07.160]  ugly and hateful, I don't define them as reality, just like the governor of Virginia
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:10.520]  doesn't define a newborn baby as alive, so he cuts their organs out.
[02:56:10.520 --> 02:56:15.120]  Now, the mother want the baby, we resuscitate.
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:16.120]  That's a legal term.
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:17.120]  The baby's alive.
[02:56:17.120 --> 02:56:20.920]  We decided alive, did we kill?
[02:56:20.920 --> 02:56:28.960]  We get the organs, we get the blood, we get the skin, you see how it works?
[02:56:28.960 --> 02:56:37.440]  And you look at her, soft, dead-eyed, stupid, only when she's saying I'm taking someone's
[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:46.200]  rights is there a little light in her eyes, you see how it works, you see, let's go back
[02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:52.360]  to the zombie production factory that is Kent State.
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:57.200]  People as strong independent women, and so therefore I feel like I'm entitled to whatever
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:58.200]  I say to you.
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:56:59.200]  I'm entitled.
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:00.680]  This doesn't count as hate.
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:01.680]  I am entitled.
[02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:08.200]  Oh, we know you're entitled, cupcake, back it up five seconds.
[02:57:08.200 --> 02:57:13.200]  You see how it works, you see now, here it is.
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:17.960]  Ugly people as strong independent women, and so therefore I feel like I'm entitled to
[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:19.600]  whatever I say to you.
[02:57:19.600 --> 02:57:24.520]  But you, this doesn't count as hate speech, but the things I do is hate speech.
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:25.520]  Yeah.
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:29.800]  And that is like, you know, that's pretty much, that's hate speech.
[02:57:29.800 --> 02:57:30.960]  What is hate speech?
[02:57:30.960 --> 02:57:36.240]  Hate speech is defined as like, stuff like, you know, making like subtle dog whistles
[02:57:36.240 --> 02:57:41.240]  and like, you know, remarks that you say, he says it's a hate speech.

[02:59:49.840 --> 02:59:56.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:56.840 --> 03:00:17.040]  All right, I'm going to do two segments, so I'm going to your calls, Morgan and Roland
[03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:20.120]  and Liberty Dog and others that are holding them, I'm going to try to jam everybody in
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:23.760]  this segment next, and then Matt Brackett's taking over, I'll have to do the whole Facebook
[03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:27.640]  thing tomorrow, it's a 24 page article and I want to spend like an hour on it, so I
[03:00:27.640 --> 03:00:29.400]  meant to get to it but I didn't.
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:34.120]  But Connor, one of our great sound guys in there, he just graduated five years ago from
[03:00:34.120 --> 03:00:39.600]  Texas State, formerly Southwest Texas, that's LBJ's alma mater down in San Marcos, Texas
[03:00:39.600 --> 03:00:44.320]  South of Boston, and they actually have courses there about banning free speech, the journalism
[03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:47.920]  classes are now about ending free speech, it's one of my good friend's daughters has
[03:00:47.920 --> 03:00:51.680]  graduated from there, and they were actually in the course teaching that I'm a Nazi, I'm
[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:56.400]  evil, that the job of journalism is to ban free speech, so you ask how this happened,
[03:00:56.400 --> 03:01:01.400]  the curriculum flipped the last six, seven years nationwide, Europe, or 10 years ago,
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:06.600]  to their taught destroy free speech, you see Oliver Darcy and CNN and all of them, that's
[03:01:06.600 --> 03:01:12.400]  their job, but we played a clip earlier where pro-libers are being attacked all over the
[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:17.240]  country just recently at free speech zones, and Connor saw one part at the end of the
[03:01:17.240 --> 03:01:20.720]  video, we'll try to play in the background while he talks about it, where that's the
[03:01:20.720 --> 03:01:26.200]  free speech zone, you know, the speaker's corner of the university where these pro-libers
[03:01:26.200 --> 03:01:34.960]  were attacked, so he was just saying it's upside down world.
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:37.000]  There we go, that sounds much better.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:41.280]  So kind of one thing I noticed about this clip as it was rolling here, yeah, this exact
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:45.480]  part right here you're seeing, so I went to school at Texas State, Owen goes down there,
[03:01:45.480 --> 03:01:51.440]  he does a bunch of stuff down at the university, and that exact spot is known as a free speech
[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:58.120]  zone, the irony I saw in this clip, I mean, look at this, this is a free speech zone and
[03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:02.840]  this guy's just going over here and just knocking down every pro-life sign, I've even seen that
[03:02:02.840 --> 03:02:09.160]  exact old timer there who goes out and sets up these pro-life events out here, he comes
[03:02:09.160 --> 03:02:13.240]  out twice a semester, he's generally a pretty nice guy, and what I was saying to you during
[03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:18.640]  the break was when I was going to school there, I did not see this type of behavior from students
[03:02:18.640 --> 03:02:22.280]  exhibited while I was going to school there, and I said to you during the break, how did
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:28.320]  this happen so fast, within five years since I graduated, this stuff is everywhere, just
[03:02:28.320 --> 03:02:32.640]  remember like last year when that one student wrote the article about how all white people
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:37.520]  were the scorn of the earth, you remember that, and that was allowed to be published
[03:02:37.520 --> 03:02:42.400]  in a newspaper that made it national headlines, that was Texas State, that was Texas State,
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:49.120]  throw the paper saying whites are inherently evil, exactly, and so after watching that
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:53.600]  piece from Caitlin Bennett, and then seeing, it reminded me of this footage that we watched
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:59.640]  earlier from the man destroying all the signs, it just started to, I just couldn't contain
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:06.440]  myself and think, how is this now becoming a universal mindset to students at all these
[03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:10.120]  colleges, like how did this, again, it just goes back to my initial question of how did
[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:16.320]  this happen so fast, and that's kind of where I'm just left and at a loss for words, Alex,
[03:03:16.320 --> 03:03:18.280]  so it's sad and disappointing.
[03:03:18.280 --> 03:03:23.400]  Well, you heard the girl say it earlier, she goes, I am entitled to say that you should
[03:03:23.400 --> 03:03:30.360]  be shut down, I am entitled, I am of the supreme group, I am in control, I am downtrodden,
[03:03:30.360 --> 03:03:36.120]  and so now, look, the Communist Chinese are openly funding Hollywood, Netflix to demoralize
[03:03:36.120 --> 03:03:40.400]  the country, they admit that, and so a lot of it's the movies, the funding, these guys
[03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:45.320]  believe they're doing the holy work, and you know, it's time for me to go down to Texas
[03:03:45.320 --> 03:03:50.000]  State as well, Owen went down there after they had it on the cover of the paper that
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.440]  whites are inherently evil, I mean, this is just unbelievable garbage, but this is through
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:03:56.440]  the left arm, thank you, Connor.
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:03:59.640]  You're welcome, I just want to say one more thing though, they are aware of who you are
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:03.360]  down there, Alex, they're very well aware of your image, and I do see lots of info
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:07.440]  of the war stickers plastered around just the town, San Marcos, that Texas State resides
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:13.000]  within, but I recently started seeing this girl, and when she found out that I worked
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:18.440]  for you, I mean, she had a dad, she didn't have a lot of nice things to say at first,
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:22.720]  so then it should turn out to be a pretty interesting relationship, anyhow, back to
[03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:23.720]  you.
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:30.040]  Back to you, yeah, no, I mean, these are not pro-American people, these are authoritarians,
[03:04:30.040 --> 03:04:34.760]  they believe they're in the ruling class, they grew up on Hollywood and set the totem
[03:04:34.760 --> 03:04:38.880]  to hate America, they weren't taught chivalry, they weren't taught common sense, and now
[03:04:38.880 --> 03:04:43.600]  they believe it's their time to rule, and those of us that don't submit to them are
[03:04:43.600 --> 03:04:49.160]  the enemy, but thanks to our audience of activists, we're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:04:49.160 --> 03:04:54.400]  Back in 60 seconds, and I'm going right to your calls, bam, bam, bam.
[03:04:54.400 --> 03:04:59.120]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is, the real drama can be
[03:04:59.120 --> 03:05:04.400]  found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater, and
[03:05:04.400 --> 03:05:08.200]  we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:05:08.200 --> 03:05:13.600]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[03:05:13.600 --> 03:05:15.120]  to unhealthy levels.
[03:05:15.120 --> 03:05:21.640]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:25.640]  What we learned was that there was, in fact, unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[03:05:25.640 --> 03:05:27.040]  in the rainwater.
[03:05:27.040 --> 03:05:32.320]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter, and not only were the heavy
[03:05:32.320 --> 03:05:38.400]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:44.040]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[03:05:44.040 --> 03:05:49.360]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:05:49.360 --> 03:06:04.360]  And more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:45.360]  Now, let's take a look at what we've learned here in Leilani Estates.
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:56.920]  So, you're always growing up here, back when that was still taught, that most nations are
[03:06:56.920 --> 03:07:03.600]  really abusive, they're really authoritarian, and mobs of dumb people get together, and
[03:07:03.600 --> 03:07:09.040]  they take over like thugs, there's no due process, and they ban people's speech and
[03:07:09.040 --> 03:07:11.320]  society collapses.
[03:07:11.320 --> 03:07:18.000]  But the people that do it are so stupid they don't care, like Venezuela, their leadership.
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:24.120]  And now it's here in America in 2019, it's getting worse, and we have to stop letting
[03:07:24.120 --> 03:07:29.160]  the left bully us, and we have to put heat on Trump and our legislatures to stand up
[03:07:29.160 --> 03:07:32.760]  against these authoritarian bashes like the universities, other places that are now on
[03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:40.040]  globalist command bases, not centers of learning and openness and real dialogue.
[03:07:40.040 --> 03:07:45.320]  Okay, Morgan and Dakota, then Roland and others, Morgan, thanks for holding in North Dakota
[03:07:45.320 --> 03:07:46.320]  here on the air.
[03:07:46.320 --> 03:07:51.920]  Hi, Alex, Morgan and Dakota, hello to my native truthers out there, I know there's not many
[03:07:51.920 --> 03:07:54.320]  out there, but we're out here, Alex.
[03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:56.320]  Well, God bless you sir, what's on your mind?
[03:07:56.320 --> 03:08:00.800]  Well, what's on my mind is I think it's funny how I've been listening to you for years
[03:08:00.800 --> 03:08:06.520]  and years and years, and just recently everybody's now saying, oh, you just listen to Alex Jones,
[03:08:06.520 --> 03:08:13.000]  you just listen to Alex Jones all the time, and I'm like, no, Alex is one of them, you
[03:08:13.000 --> 03:08:18.480]  know, this is one of many that we should all be listening to, but of course it's creating
[03:08:18.480 --> 03:08:23.520]  a bigger divide, which, and I see it happening, I mean, little Indian reservations all over
[03:08:23.520 --> 03:08:30.240]  America, surrounded by white people, of course, but it's creating a divide.
[03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:36.400]  And I think that needs to be addressed, and Trump definitely needs to try to get a hold
[03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:41.840]  of some more native votes, because I don't, I'm almost the only single person that supports
[03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:43.800]  them in my entire town.
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:46.200]  And I totally agree.
[03:08:46.200 --> 03:08:50.560]  And everybody should just come together against globalism, because it's what's attacking
[03:08:50.560 --> 03:08:51.560]  us all.
[03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:53.640]  It doesn't matter if you're Native American, it doesn't matter if you're black, white,
[03:08:53.640 --> 03:08:57.040]  you're being targeted by the tainted vaccines, you're being targeted by Florida, you're being
[03:08:57.040 --> 03:09:00.480]  targeted by Facebook, you're being targeted by AI.
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:05.280]  This whole anti-human system is here, and humans must unite against it.
[03:09:05.280 --> 03:09:09.960]  Yep, even here, where I work, I work for the road maintenance department, and now we got
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:14.800]  to all start using, start putting our data into an app.
[03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:19.600]  And we're going to have to carry an app around, you know, basically give them the data that
[03:09:19.600 --> 03:09:24.800]  we do every day, all day, and they advise us to get a Google account, of course.
[03:09:24.800 --> 03:09:32.480]  And then all you're really doing is training a robot driverless car to take your job soon.
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:37.000]  And of course, everybody, I've been learning about Bluebeam and stuff like that, and everybody
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:41.240]  thinks it's going to be some hallucination, some thing in the sky, but it's really just
[03:09:41.240 --> 03:09:45.160]  a way to build things without humans.
[03:09:45.160 --> 03:09:49.000]  You know, and yeah, I do see driverless, I don't know about driverless commercial trucks
[03:09:49.000 --> 03:09:51.760]  like on X-Men, but definitely our jobs are...
[03:09:51.760 --> 03:09:55.240]  Sir, it's here, it's here that the plan is to totally replace humans.
[03:09:55.240 --> 03:10:00.000]  Go to an airport, everything's robot kiosk, everything's being replaced to make us obsolete.
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:04.000]  I noticed you called in saying your son has autism, you want to talk about that?
[03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:09.000]  Well, yeah, but not only does he have autism, I'm in a custody battle right now with mom,
[03:10:09.000 --> 03:10:15.000]  but I also watch my girlfriend's nephew who has cerebral palsy, and he definitely has
[03:10:15.000 --> 03:10:17.720]  autism, but it's not diagnosed.
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:23.320]  And he is almost the exact same image of my son, everything about him is the same, and
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:29.160]  they're non-verbal, they're in that spectrum where non-verbal at all, got the droopy eyes.
[03:10:29.160 --> 03:10:34.320]  And I heard about a 30-year-old man that learned to type that is autistic, and it's really
[03:10:34.320 --> 03:10:39.520]  a mental prison in their head, where they can type, they know what we're saying, and
[03:10:39.520 --> 03:10:42.440]  they want to say something back, but they can't.
[03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:43.440]  And that's definitely...
[03:10:43.440 --> 03:10:47.120]  It's demonic, and it's evil, and they're putting viruses and other things in the vaccines
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:49.120]  that target certain areas of the brain.
[03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:54.200]  So again, the conscious and the subconscious get cut off, and exactly, it is, when I've
[03:10:54.200 --> 03:10:59.000]  heard it's just total torture, put these young boys and then become men are put into
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:04.200]  and they're just battling, frustrated, trying to communicate with you, and the system knows
[03:11:04.200 --> 03:11:06.320]  full damn well what they're doing.
[03:11:06.320 --> 03:11:09.760]  They're taking out our men ahead of the AI takedown.
[03:11:09.760 --> 03:11:14.720]  This is all, in my research, extraterrestrial through the AI with collaborator humans,
[03:11:14.720 --> 03:11:17.200]  the takeover of the planet, like the Bible says.
[03:11:17.200 --> 03:11:20.920]  I don't get to know UFOs and lizard people and stuff you can't prove.
[03:11:20.920 --> 03:11:25.280]  The globalists believe they're communicating with interdimensional forces that have given
[03:11:25.280 --> 03:11:30.360]  them a blueprint for immortality, and they are carrying it out judiciously to take us
[03:11:30.360 --> 03:11:31.360]  out.
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:32.360]  And that's it.
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:33.360]  So remember that.
[03:11:33.360 --> 03:11:40.960]  Folks, thank you, Collin, Morgan, Roland, Roland of Kansas, you're on the air.
[03:11:40.960 --> 03:11:41.960]  Thanks for holding.
[03:11:41.960 --> 03:11:42.960]  Thank you.
[03:11:42.960 --> 03:11:44.520]  Thanks for everything that you do.
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:45.520]  I have...
[03:11:45.520 --> 03:11:50.800]  This has been two parts that it has to do with social media and the impact.
[03:11:50.800 --> 03:11:53.000]  Earlier, somebody mentioned MyLife.com.
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:58.240]  Now, this is something that you could really get into to expose, because this is the one
[03:11:58.240 --> 03:12:00.960]  evil extortion outfit on the Internet.
[03:12:00.960 --> 03:12:07.880]  What they do, they have evidently the software to data mine the Internet to find out information
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:10.920]  about anybody that they can find out, whatever they can get.
[03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:16.240]  And then they put it together, and it could be incorrect, it may be correct.
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:21.840]  Then they have a file for you, and so anybody that happens to look up and actually come
[03:12:21.840 --> 03:12:26.400]  across you might find out that 30 years ago, you were arrested not knowing what the charge
[03:12:26.400 --> 03:12:27.400]  was.
[03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:31.880]  It could have been false and totally dropped, but it makes it look like there's some kind
[03:12:31.880 --> 03:12:32.880]  of criminal.
[03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:36.960]  The same thing would be true of lawsuits.
[03:12:36.960 --> 03:12:41.360]  And so a person that would be applying for a job may not even know about this being out
[03:12:41.360 --> 03:12:46.080]  there, and the person that may want to hire them would then see it and then not even want
[03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:48.800]  to talk to the person or even consider hiring him.
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:53.480]  Now the scam is this, is that once you see that and you want to correct it, well then
[03:12:53.480 --> 03:12:56.560]  you have to buy a membership, and I think it's like $29.
[03:12:56.560 --> 03:12:58.400]  Of course, that's the scam.
[03:12:58.400 --> 03:13:02.480]  They take things out there, a lot of this info, magnify to make it look the worst it
[03:13:02.480 --> 03:13:06.920]  possibly can, so you call them to clean it up, and really all they do is change your
[03:13:06.920 --> 03:13:07.920]  account.
[03:13:07.920 --> 03:13:11.760]  Yeah, and not only that, they've got your debit or credit card number, and they don't
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:15.680]  do the $29, they do $60 or $90 or $95.
[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:20.440]  And the state of California found it, fined them $800,000.
[03:13:20.440 --> 03:13:24.200]  And you can look up, there's at least three websites that have a list of the complainers
[03:13:24.200 --> 03:13:30.160]  and the people that got scammed and the troubles they had on trying to get stopped any more
[03:13:30.160 --> 03:13:32.400]  debiting of their account.
[03:13:32.400 --> 03:13:38.000]  There is a YouTube video on how to cancel yourself out, and they have to remove it.
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:43.680]  And the guy actually charges people, he says he's made charges people money to get them
[03:13:43.680 --> 03:13:47.560]  removed, but he gives you the information on how you can do it for yourself.
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:53.680]  The second part is the small business impact of Facebook and Instagram.
[03:13:53.680 --> 03:13:59.160]  If it's completely chopped up, there are many, many small businesses that are trying to get
[03:13:59.160 --> 03:14:02.480]  started by using Facebook and Instagram.
[03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:10.000]  And the Shopify.com has got a pretty slick setup for setting up a website, and then being
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:17.280]  linked with Facebook and Instagram, and if it's all messed up the way it is right now,
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:20.840]  there'll be a lot of people impacted that are making a living.
[03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:25.520]  So it seems like cutting it up into pieces may not be the answer, but there needs to
[03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:31.320]  be some sort of accountability on the part of Facebook and probably even Instagram on
[03:14:31.320 --> 03:14:35.320]  how they are cutting off anybody that has conservative attitude.
[03:14:35.320 --> 03:14:42.080]  I designed myself a t-shirt company with a lot of comedy and politically incorrect stuff,
[03:14:42.080 --> 03:14:45.400]  and I'm sitting back here wondering, and once I start moving this on Instagram, am I going
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:51.040]  to get blocked or shadow banned by both Facebook and Instagram before I can hardly even get
[03:14:51.040 --> 03:14:52.040]  started?
[03:14:52.040 --> 03:14:58.160]  So I think that there's got to be some congressional action that takes place.
[03:14:58.160 --> 03:15:03.920]  Oh, there absolutely has to be because Congress is in action, getting creates a vacuum for
[03:15:03.920 --> 03:15:07.600]  the EU and others to come in with their regulations.
[03:15:07.600 --> 03:15:09.880]  The left and Warren have their total takeover plan.
[03:15:09.880 --> 03:15:11.680]  That's just to have them totally control it.
[03:15:11.680 --> 03:15:14.000]  We need to have the Internet Bill of Rights.
[03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:15.000]  We need to have a debate about it.
[03:15:15.000 --> 03:15:16.120]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:16.120 --> 03:15:17.120]  Great call, Roland.
[03:15:17.120 --> 03:15:18.120]  All right.

[03:15:27.320 --> 03:15:28.320]  lot of news.

[03:20:35.680 --> 03:20:41.440]  it, especially interested in those interviews in the college with the students basically
[03:20:41.440 --> 03:20:43.760]  that are down with censorship.
[03:20:43.760 --> 03:20:50.760]  They're completely cool with banning people from social media for shutting down conservative
[03:20:50.760 --> 03:20:56.520]  thoughts and it's pretty obvious that they're being brainwashed in their classrooms.
[03:20:56.520 --> 03:21:00.600]  And it's obvious that brainwashing works, at least to that extent, the ones that are
[03:21:00.600 --> 03:21:05.360]  willing to walk up to a camera and confront on this issue.
[03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:12.360]  But I have seen some glimmers of hope that maybe there's a backlash forming.
[03:21:12.360 --> 03:21:18.480]  My daughter who's just out of college, she's as conservative as they come.
[03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:21.160]  Teachers didn't affect her to tilt her leftward.
[03:21:21.160 --> 03:21:27.720]  If anything, her friends are reacting against that political correctness.
[03:21:27.720 --> 03:21:34.920]  They can't stand their PC professors and I think they're falling into the conservative
[03:21:34.920 --> 03:21:40.000]  side very strongly, the conservative libertarian side.
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:48.240]  I think that a news item that I saw in the last day was at this high school in Colorado,
[03:21:48.240 --> 03:21:51.960]  the Highlands Ranch STEM School.
[03:21:51.960 --> 03:21:57.680]  The students actually walked out when a couple of politicians tried to turn the memorial
[03:21:57.680 --> 03:22:00.960]  for the hero Kendrick Castillo.
[03:22:00.960 --> 03:22:05.960]  They tried to turn his memorial into a gun control political rally.
[03:22:05.960 --> 03:22:13.160]  And they not only walked out and they were chanting about needing mental health, not
[03:22:13.160 --> 03:22:19.560]  gun control, and mental health could go a long way towards explaining that one.
[03:22:19.560 --> 03:22:24.040]  The two shooters were, to my way of thinking, pretty wacko.
[03:22:24.040 --> 03:22:32.240]  The main shooter, the 18-year-old, had F-society spray painted on his car, kind of a scream
[03:22:32.240 --> 03:22:36.680]  that he was sort of a psychotic, antisocial individual.
[03:22:36.680 --> 03:22:41.560]  But here he is in school with the pink hair screaming, look at me.
[03:22:41.560 --> 03:22:47.680]  Well, he got his attention, but he didn't get the body count he was hoping for because
[03:22:47.680 --> 03:22:53.000]  Kendrick Castillo tackled him and died in the process.
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:23:00.880]  And by doing so, he bought time for other students to rush the guy and then for security
[03:23:00.880 --> 03:23:02.520]  to arrive.
[03:23:02.520 --> 03:23:06.120]  So the victim was the hero.
[03:23:06.120 --> 03:23:11.000]  And I think that we would do well to remember the names of these heroes.
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:16.480]  There was the old woman at the synagogue in California that jumped in the path of a bullet.
[03:23:16.480 --> 03:23:24.240]  And then there was at UNC Charlotte, Riley Howell, who also rushed a shooter, took him
[03:23:24.240 --> 03:23:25.720]  out.
[03:23:25.720 --> 03:23:34.920]  I would compare it to the day of 9-11, was it Flight 93, that they knew that they were
[03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:37.920]  going to be used in a suicide mission.
[03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:42.520]  They decided to rush the cockpit no matter what the cost.
[03:23:42.520 --> 03:23:49.480]  And that's an important thing for society to realize, we can't just hide under our desks
[03:23:49.480 --> 03:23:52.640]  or lock doors and hide.
[03:23:52.640 --> 03:23:57.760]  Somebody when the gun comes out, somebody, the closest guys, they've got to just go
[03:23:57.760 --> 03:23:58.760]  for it.
[03:23:58.760 --> 03:24:01.880]  And it's not the first time that it's happened.
[03:24:01.880 --> 03:24:06.200]  It's happened occasionally throughout the history of these mass shootings.
[03:24:06.200 --> 03:24:10.440]  But that's the only solution is for these guys to know there won't be any big body
[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:11.440]  count.
[03:24:11.440 --> 03:24:16.920]  And you won't be remembered, you'll just be forgotten as another psycho-loser.
[03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:23.720]  But my prayers and thoughts definitely go out to the families of these heroes, particularly
[03:24:23.720 --> 03:24:27.880]  these young men, with everything in front of them, their entire world, their entire
[03:24:27.880 --> 03:24:33.080]  lives laid out in front of them and snuffed out.
[03:24:33.080 --> 03:24:39.760]  But by doing so, saving the lives of possibly dozens of their friends.
[03:24:39.760 --> 03:24:47.880]  So God bless Riley and Kendrick, two great American heroes.
[03:24:47.880 --> 03:24:59.880]  And it does show that not everybody is an NPC, a robot, brainwashed zombie, like what
[03:24:59.880 --> 03:25:04.920]  we tend to think of the millennials maybe too much as.
[03:25:04.920 --> 03:25:10.040]  And certainly it's disturbing when you see so many millennials that are embracing their
[03:25:10.040 --> 03:25:19.800]  own tyranny, they're actually rejecting freedom, they're rejecting their own survival instinct.
[03:25:19.800 --> 03:25:24.520]  It goes to the power of brainwashing.
[03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:31.600]  One can be so powerful that in a cult setting, people will kill themselves like in Jonestown
[03:25:31.600 --> 03:25:36.280]  or the doomsday cult that was waiting for the asteroid, or I forget what that one was
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:41.240]  out in California, they all took pills and died.
[03:25:41.240 --> 03:25:43.280]  That's the power of brainwashing.
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:47.320]  And it can work on a huge societal scale too.
[03:25:47.320 --> 03:25:55.280]  But the brainwashing of many may actually be an awakening for many others that are following
[03:25:55.280 --> 03:25:56.720]  them.
[03:25:56.720 --> 03:26:03.960]  And while we're seeing social media trying to crack down and clamp down and ban conservative
[03:26:03.960 --> 03:26:10.840]  ideas, ban people like Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, myself.
[03:26:10.840 --> 03:26:15.440]  What they're doing, I think, is having an unintended consequence because it's making
[03:26:15.440 --> 03:26:18.720]  non-political correctness uncool.
[03:26:18.720 --> 03:26:24.120]  That's why the Pepe the Clown meme, I think, is so effective.
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:30.360]  Because if they try to ban the clown meme, what does that say about political correctness?
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:31.760]  That they can't take a joke.
[03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:34.280]  They literally cannot take a joke.
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:39.960]  They have to look for hidden symbolism, like a okay sign.
[03:26:39.960 --> 03:26:46.400]  They have to try to control and enforce their rigid political correctness to the extent
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:51.480]  that nobody's allowed to laugh, nobody's allowed to mock.
[03:26:51.480 --> 03:26:52.480]  Sarcasm is banned.
[03:26:52.480 --> 03:26:57.440]  Well, when you do this and you tell teenagers that they can't have a good time and can't
[03:26:57.440 --> 03:27:02.680]  use sarcasm, that's not a way to recruit people to the politically correct left-wing
[03:27:02.680 --> 03:27:03.680]  cause.
[03:27:03.680 --> 03:27:10.560]  In fact, that's a way to make the left completely uncool and repellent to youth.
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:16.080]  So I hope that there is an actual unintended consequence in here, and I'm really looking
[03:27:16.080 --> 03:27:19.880]  for a millennial backlash.
[03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:25.400]  It's important to understand where political correctness comes from in the first place.
[03:27:25.400 --> 03:27:32.400]  What is the basis of political correctness?
[03:27:32.400 --> 03:27:39.920]  In this space, political correctness is a tool that the left uses to avoid criticism.
[03:27:39.920 --> 03:27:47.880]  Any criticism of the bad consequences of leftist propaganda and ideology, any criticism of
[03:27:47.880 --> 03:27:53.880]  it is branded as hate speech and shut down.
[03:27:53.880 --> 03:27:55.600]  People are put off of social media.
[03:27:55.600 --> 03:28:03.520]  People have even lost their jobs because of basically counterattacking against left-wing
[03:28:03.520 --> 03:28:07.960]  ideology and then being branded as haters.
[03:28:07.960 --> 03:28:14.560]  That's why I think that the clown meme is so effective because how can you ban laughter?
[03:28:14.560 --> 03:28:21.640]  How can you ban a clown with a colorful wig even if it's Pepe the Frog?
[03:28:21.640 --> 03:28:28.000]  It just makes the left look like totalitarian idiots, which is exactly what they are.
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:35.400]  I have a lot of concern for the next generation that I'll get to in the next segment.
[03:28:35.400 --> 03:28:42.120]  Maybe there are a lot of brainwashed NPCs signing up for oblivion, but maybe there is a rising
[03:28:42.120 --> 03:28:46.240]  new generation that will be actively seeking freedom.
[03:28:46.240 --> 03:28:53.240]  We'll be back after the break and talk more about this.
[03:28:53.240 --> 03:28:55.400]  OK, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.400 --> 03:28:56.400]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:28:56.400 --> 03:28:57.400]  Hey, what you doing?
[03:28:57.400 --> 03:28:58.400]  Mother's Day, remember?

[03:29:03.480 --> 03:29:05.000]  You know there's an easier way, right?

[03:32:20.080 --> 03:32:21.960]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:21.960 --> 03:32:27.560]  They don't want us to remember what political action did, and that's why the globalist,
[03:32:27.560 --> 03:32:30.400]  Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:32:30.400 --> 03:32:35.480]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech, about taking your very
[03:32:35.480 --> 03:32:36.920]  sovereignty away.
[03:32:36.920 --> 03:32:39.200]  This country is in a war.

[03:32:51.680 --> 03:32:52.680]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:52.680 --> 03:33:21.680]  Thank you.
[03:33:22.680 --> 03:33:36.280]  We're going to slightly switch gears, but we'll bring it back around to social media.
[03:33:36.280 --> 03:33:41.880]  You know, I've been saying for probably a year now that President Trump wasn't going
[03:33:41.880 --> 03:33:47.800]  to declassify the deep state coup material until after the Mueller report was out, that
[03:33:47.800 --> 03:33:53.560]  it was kind of a poker game, and you want to put down the last hand.
[03:33:53.560 --> 03:33:56.560]  And I think that that's what we're now seeing.
[03:33:56.560 --> 03:34:02.160]  So what Congress is doing, which really is clown world, when you look at people like
[03:34:02.160 --> 03:34:11.040]  Nadler and Swalwell, Pelosi, they think that they're being effective.
[03:34:11.040 --> 03:34:17.240]  They think that this contempt citation against Attorney General Barr is going to get them
[03:34:17.240 --> 03:34:23.480]  traction, but it shows that they're really just living in their own echo chamber, their
[03:34:23.480 --> 03:34:24.480]  own bubble.
[03:34:24.480 --> 03:34:29.400]  Of course, Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon are going to think it's great.
[03:34:29.400 --> 03:34:34.600]  But Americans, I think, are looking at them as total clowns now.
[03:34:34.600 --> 03:34:35.600]  Americans get it.
[03:34:35.600 --> 03:34:42.240]  And this is the exact same cast of clowns that went against Kavanaugh, that were giving
[03:34:42.240 --> 03:34:51.160]  credibility to these charges that he was leading a gang rape ring as a high school kid.
[03:34:51.160 --> 03:34:52.600]  And that didn't work.
[03:34:52.600 --> 03:34:55.000]  Kavanaugh was confirmed.
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:34:57.760]  And I don't think that they're going to get any traction here.
[03:34:57.760 --> 03:35:03.280]  And what it's showing America is that they're desperate, because the hammer is going to
[03:35:03.280 --> 03:35:05.120]  come down.
[03:35:05.120 --> 03:35:13.040]  And when it comes down, the Democrats are going to have to either defect from the Russian
[03:35:13.040 --> 03:35:19.440]  narrative, which is unlikely, or continue to double down on stupid, just going further
[03:35:19.440 --> 03:35:28.320]  and further into a hall of mirrors that just gets smaller and smaller in the end until
[03:35:28.320 --> 03:35:32.040]  it eventually just goes poof and is gone.
[03:35:32.040 --> 03:35:38.680]  Because the big guns, the real ammunition, is about to get poured out and fired at the
[03:35:38.680 --> 03:35:40.680]  Democrats.
[03:35:40.680 --> 03:35:49.760]  The Inspector General report, even the Huber report, the Salt Lake City US Attorney, he's
[03:35:49.760 --> 03:35:53.640]  been out there way out in left field in Salt Lake City, but people have been going out
[03:35:53.640 --> 03:35:55.320]  and talking to them.
[03:35:55.320 --> 03:36:01.720]  And I have to think that some of the principles at the level of Nellior, Broussour, Strzok
[03:36:01.720 --> 03:36:10.480]  and Page, they're not going to go to prison on perjury charges, that they're giving testimony
[03:36:10.480 --> 03:36:16.640]  now and risk going to prison on very tough perjury charges.
[03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:22.680]  When their truthful testimony is going to be, I was following orders, and the orders
[03:36:22.680 --> 03:36:27.080]  go right to the White House, to the Obama White House.
[03:36:27.080 --> 03:36:35.800]  Eventually it's going to be, I think, Obama and his White House circle and John Brennan.
[03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:41.760]  Comey may fall on his sword, but even Comey, I think, eventually is going to say, I thought
[03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:45.720]  this was legitimate intelligence that came over from the CIA.
[03:36:45.720 --> 03:36:50.600]  I thought that the Russia stuff was real and that the investigation was real.
[03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:55.240]  It's pretty unbelievable, but Comey may stick with that story.
[03:36:55.240 --> 03:37:01.280]  But other than Comey and Brennan and the Obama White House, I think everybody's going to
[03:37:01.280 --> 03:37:06.000]  wind up flipping and saying that they were just following orders.
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:10.920]  Because clearly the Papadopoulos timeline is falling apart.
[03:37:10.920 --> 03:37:18.360]  If Joseph Mifsud is shown to be an FBI and CIA and State Department asset going back
[03:37:18.360 --> 03:37:27.400]  for years, then everything that follows from the FISA application, everything will be the
[03:37:27.400 --> 03:37:32.320]  fruit of the poison tree, and the entire thing is going to blow up.
[03:37:32.320 --> 03:37:38.120]  I think Hannity had it best he calls it Operation Crossfire Boomerang, and that's what's going
[03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:39.120]  to happen.
[03:37:39.120 --> 03:37:43.680]  I see Trump winning very big in 2020.
[03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:53.440]  If the economy somehow manages to hold together, and there's nothing else that the Democrats
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:37:59.080]  have to throw at him, all of the Russian narrative is going to have a boomerang effect.
[03:37:59.080 --> 03:38:05.200]  And hopefully, if the Republicans, not that I'm a big Republican fan, but the alternative
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:12.800]  is the Democratic socialists, if there is a Democrat Congress in 2020, we may finally
[03:38:12.800 --> 03:38:19.160]  get a chance to secure the border as well as can be done in this era.
[03:38:19.160 --> 03:38:28.640]  But if the projections are that Trump is going to probably cruise to a reelection victory,
[03:38:28.640 --> 03:38:35.240]  I don't think that the danger is past because the people at the top of the deep state coup
[03:38:35.240 --> 03:38:41.400]  who are facing prison, men in their 60s, facing prison and disgrace.
[03:38:41.400 --> 03:38:48.280]  I think that some of them will be willing to go for a kinetic operation to take out
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:49.680]  Trump.
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:56.680]  And I'm not saying that there'll be anything put in orders, but it'll be more in the similar
[03:38:56.680 --> 03:39:05.720]  to the who will rid me of this meddlesome priest, the Beckett story, where it won't
[03:39:05.720 --> 03:39:13.800]  be a memo, nothing in writing, no meetings of more than two people, but at the highest
[03:39:13.800 --> 03:39:18.680]  levels of the deep state coup and the entrenched deep state bureaucracy, people are going to
[03:39:18.680 --> 03:39:22.400]  be thinking, we have got to get rid of Trump.
[03:39:22.400 --> 03:39:26.400]  And by get rid of, I mean, take him out.
[03:39:26.400 --> 03:39:36.680]  And that would include potentially allowing an assassin to get close to him, corrupt Secret
[03:39:36.680 --> 03:39:38.480]  Service people.
[03:39:38.480 --> 03:39:45.400]  I'm not saying it all Secret Service are suspect, but there have been a lot of them fired.
[03:39:45.400 --> 03:39:50.360]  Remember Obama brought in a lot of social justice warrior types and put them at the
[03:39:50.360 --> 03:39:55.280]  very top of the bureaucracies, the federal bureaucracies, including the Secret Service.
[03:39:55.280 --> 03:39:58.320]  We remember their scandals during the Obama regime.
[03:39:58.320 --> 03:40:04.480]  So there's a lot of corrupt and dirty cops at the top of federal law enforcement, because
[03:40:04.480 --> 03:40:10.320]  that's who Obama brought in, guys like Brennan, Clapper and Comey.
[03:40:10.320 --> 03:40:15.520]  They're infesting the entire federal law enforcement bureaucracy now.
[03:40:15.520 --> 03:40:22.040]  And some of them, I think, would be willing to kind of open the gate to a kinetic solution
[03:40:22.040 --> 03:40:23.620]  to Donald Trump.
[03:40:23.620 --> 03:40:30.120]  So I do fear for his personal safety greatly going forward.
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:38.240]  I hope that the Secret Service immediately around him are way on their game, because
[03:40:38.240 --> 03:40:44.360]  as the legal net closes around the coup plotters, they're not going to just quietly go off to
[03:40:44.360 --> 03:40:45.360]  prison.
[03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:48.120]  They're going to be more and more desperate.
[03:40:48.120 --> 03:40:55.400]  People like John Brennan, who voted for a communist in 1976, when the Soviets were still putting
[03:40:55.400 --> 03:41:01.800]  people in gulags and psychiatric hospitals where they were chemically lobotomized, that's
[03:41:01.800 --> 03:41:04.360]  who he voted for.
[03:41:04.360 --> 03:41:09.600]  These guys don't really see a problem with communist tactics.
[03:41:09.600 --> 03:41:16.720]  The ends justify the means, and they see Trump as an existential threat to all of what they
[03:41:16.720 --> 03:41:22.720]  consider progress towards globalism, which is their holy grail.
[03:41:22.720 --> 03:41:27.480]  That's why Comey called his book a higher loyalty, meaning a higher loyalty than to the
[03:41:27.480 --> 03:41:31.120]  Constitution and to the United States of America.
[03:41:31.120 --> 03:41:38.160]  Well, they see their entire plot possibly unraveling with a successful Trump second
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:42.360]  terms and a Republican Congress.
[03:41:42.360 --> 03:41:49.640]  Paul Ryan is gone, imagine a Republican Congress with somebody like Jim Jordan running the
[03:41:49.640 --> 03:41:50.840]  show.
[03:41:50.840 --> 03:41:58.320]  This to them is an absolute existential nightmare, and they will in no way just ride smoothly
[03:41:58.320 --> 03:41:59.320]  through it.
[03:41:59.320 --> 03:42:05.240]  And they can't depend on saying that Trump stole the election in 2020.
[03:42:05.240 --> 03:42:09.800]  That plan for 2016 to discredit the election, it didn't work.
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:10.880]  It failed.
[03:42:10.880 --> 03:42:15.120]  They were willing to do a deep state coup plot, and it failed.
[03:42:15.120 --> 03:42:19.880]  So they can't count one rigging the vote in 2020.
[03:42:19.880 --> 03:42:25.760]  They can't count one calling it a fraudulent election.
[03:42:25.760 --> 03:42:32.040]  So they are preparing themselves for a second Trump administration with a GOP Congress and
[03:42:32.040 --> 03:42:33.320]  Senate.
[03:42:33.320 --> 03:42:36.240]  And that is a nightmare scenario for them.
[03:42:36.240 --> 03:42:42.320]  And there are people on their side who will stop at nothing, including fomenting an economic
[03:42:42.320 --> 03:42:46.480]  crash, assassination plots, you name it.
[03:42:46.480 --> 03:42:48.440]  Nothing is off the table.
[03:42:48.440 --> 03:42:53.600]  When we come back, maybe we'll pick up some phone calls if.
[03:42:53.600 --> 03:42:55.840]  Feeling your body is hard work.

[03:43:53.240 --> 03:43:55.640]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:43:55.640 --> 03:43:59.440]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your
[03:43:59.440 --> 03:44:02.200]  kids get their EPA and DHA too.
[03:44:02.200 --> 03:44:06.200]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.

[03:44:29.960 --> 03:44:31.720]  brain growth spurts.

[03:47:20.840 --> 03:47:24.720]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:31.880]  Yeah, last segment, and I did want to mention I have a new book coming out in a couple of
[03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:33.880]  weeks.
[03:47:33.880 --> 03:47:40.400]  It's going to be in print and an e-book on Kindle called The Bracken Collection, which
[03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:45.040]  is my short stories and some essays from the last decade.
[03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:53.240]  And I would recommend going forward to get some books like this in the dead tree format.
[03:47:53.240 --> 03:47:58.280]  Something that, you know, we're all aware that people are being banned from social media.
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:04.560]  Tommy Robinson, one of his books, was actually taken off of Amazon because, you know, the
[03:48:04.560 --> 03:48:10.760]  professional Muslim grievance groups thought that it shouldn't be there, so Amazon cooperated
[03:48:10.760 --> 03:48:12.280]  and took it down.
[03:48:12.280 --> 03:48:18.040]  You can find Mein Kampf, and you can find all kind of literature like that on Amazon, but
[03:48:18.040 --> 03:48:23.600]  you can't find Tommy Robinson's book called Muhammad's Quran.
[03:48:23.600 --> 03:48:27.280]  It's factual, true book, you can't find it.
[03:48:27.280 --> 03:48:33.840]  Well, not only can they take books off of Amazon, they can make a big tech and now make
[03:48:33.840 --> 03:48:39.680]  it so that they can delete things that you think that you've saved somewhere in the ether.
[03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:46.520]  If you don't have it locked into your hard drive in a secure location or on a printed
[03:48:46.520 --> 03:48:49.880]  format, they can take things away.
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:57.240]  Kindle has had books deleted years later after being published because of copyright disputes
[03:48:57.240 --> 03:49:07.200]  or people making the case that some literature ordered one kiddie porn, a Lolita-type fiction,
[03:49:07.200 --> 03:49:10.880]  and you think you have a book on your Kindle and zap, it's gone.
[03:49:10.880 --> 03:49:18.640]  So if Trump doesn't win, if something happens where we get a president of Buttigieg or Kamala
[03:49:18.640 --> 03:49:26.560]  Harris or, you know, even a Biden, you can expect the hate crime laws just to go into
[03:49:26.560 --> 03:49:31.640]  orbit as a means of shutting down conservative speech.
[03:49:31.640 --> 03:49:40.280]  And that's going to be, I think, a backdoor way for them to attack conservative literature,
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:46.200]  fiction and nonfiction, which would include just zapping them right off your device, you
[03:49:46.200 --> 03:49:54.280]  know, as an evil, hateful, you know, violence-producing form of entertainment.
[03:49:54.280 --> 03:50:01.720]  So I would recommend that you get books by folks like me, put it on Kindle, that's fine.
[03:50:01.720 --> 03:50:05.280]  But remember, what's on Kindle can be taken away from Kindle.
[03:50:05.280 --> 03:50:10.280]  And if you have the printed book, at least you're going to have it forever.
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:16.280]  And you can share it with your friends, it can't be removed by social media.
[03:50:16.280 --> 03:50:22.680]  In the New Zealand mosque shooting, people have been arrested in New Zealand just for
[03:50:22.680 --> 03:50:25.920]  attempting to find that video, the Facebook video.
[03:50:25.920 --> 03:50:31.320]  You know, the guy put it, the guy streamed it on Facebook, millions of people saw it,
[03:50:31.320 --> 03:50:33.040]  but now it's a crime.
[03:50:33.040 --> 03:50:37.400]  You can't even possess his manifesto in New Zealand.
[03:50:37.400 --> 03:50:41.960]  And you know, we have the First Amendment, theoretically, but if the Democrats come to
[03:50:41.960 --> 03:50:46.960]  power eventually, we're going to see drastic curtailments on it.
[03:50:46.960 --> 03:50:53.320]  And this is, you know, just something I see in the future, I know I've got bookshelves
[03:50:53.320 --> 03:51:00.440]  just too full, I can't jam in any more printed books, but in some cases, it might be a good
[03:51:00.440 --> 03:51:03.960]  idea, you know, it might be a good idea.
[03:51:03.960 --> 03:51:09.520]  Now, this is kind of, you know, people are looking at me and saying, look at that old
[03:51:09.520 --> 03:51:15.080]  boomer talking about printed books, that's so yesterday, that's so 20th century.
[03:51:15.080 --> 03:51:17.280]  We live in an electronic world.
[03:51:17.280 --> 03:51:18.640]  And that's fine.
[03:51:18.640 --> 03:51:23.360]  But you guys, you know, that aren't younger than boomers, you better remember, the digital
[03:51:23.360 --> 03:51:25.960]  world doesn't really exist.
[03:51:25.960 --> 03:51:26.960]  It's virtual.
[03:51:26.960 --> 03:51:29.240]  The cloud is virtual.
[03:51:29.240 --> 03:51:36.760]  The cloud can go poof during some kind of an electronic attack, cyber attack, or a tyrannical
[03:51:36.760 --> 03:51:42.960]  government can just delete things, not only delete things, but charge you for possessing
[03:51:42.960 --> 03:51:43.960]  them.
[03:51:43.960 --> 03:51:49.280]  So, when you think about a printed book, think of it as an insurance policy against future
[03:51:49.280 --> 03:51:50.280]  deletion.
[03:51:50.280 --> 03:51:57.800]  You know, this is speaking about, you know, younger people and their reliance on the screens,
[03:51:57.800 --> 03:52:03.320]  especially the younger, the youngest kids that have had cell phones and computers since
[03:52:03.320 --> 03:52:08.600]  the day, really the day they were born, they can't imagine another world.
[03:52:08.600 --> 03:52:12.000]  They are effectively being brainwashed from the cradle.
[03:52:12.000 --> 03:52:17.800]  You know, the messaging that's going out, not just the political messaging, but the consumer
[03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:23.960]  messaging and so forth, and just the believe authority messaging that's going out, you
[03:52:23.960 --> 03:52:28.360]  know, the conformism messaging that's going out.
[03:52:28.360 --> 03:52:34.120]  This is probably the most effective form of brainwashing that's ever existed.
[03:52:34.120 --> 03:52:39.520]  People like Hitler, Mao and Stalin never had the tools that exist today.
[03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:48.160]  All they could do is put up billboards and posters on walls, leaflets, probed type newspapers,
[03:52:48.160 --> 03:52:53.000]  you know, radio and maybe one television channel.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:53:00.280]  That is nothing compared to what kids have now, which is a device that will entertain
[03:53:00.280 --> 03:53:03.440]  them from day one.
[03:53:03.440 --> 03:53:08.480]  But you have to remember that the messages that are coming out of all of the screens
[03:53:08.480 --> 03:53:14.040]  have been designed to keep you buying, to keep you watching.
[03:53:14.040 --> 03:53:20.880]  You know, billion dollar companies pay millionaires, geniuses, they pay geniuses, millions of
[03:53:20.880 --> 03:53:25.480]  dollars to addict kids to that screen.
[03:53:25.480 --> 03:53:33.040]  And that's bad enough, but as a result, young people are not getting outside, they're not
[03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:38.160]  going camping, they're not going fishing or hunting, they're not ever learning what
[03:53:38.160 --> 03:53:45.200]  it is to hike in the woods because all of their waking time is spent staring inside
[03:53:45.200 --> 03:53:46.440]  of a screen.
[03:53:46.440 --> 03:53:51.720]  And that brain development time can't be recaptured.
[03:53:51.720 --> 03:53:56.440]  Once the brain is developed through the teen years into young adulthood, you can't go back
[03:53:56.440 --> 03:54:04.520]  then and say, now let's do the hiking in the woods and smelling the flowers and digging
[03:54:04.520 --> 03:54:06.240]  the dirt with our hands.
[03:54:06.240 --> 03:54:07.240]  That's gone.
[03:54:07.240 --> 03:54:14.920]  So the rising generation potentially is going to be so susceptible to programming and being
[03:54:14.920 --> 03:54:22.880]  brainwashed because all of their neurological development was to wait for the next message
[03:54:22.880 --> 03:54:25.400]  then to follow the instruction on the screen.
[03:54:25.400 --> 03:54:31.920]  Click here, turn right in 100 yards, don't figure out how to actually get around a city
[03:54:31.920 --> 03:54:37.920]  or get around the woods on your own, learning to navigate in the real world.
[03:54:37.920 --> 03:54:41.200]  It's just stare at a screen and wait for the next message.
[03:54:41.200 --> 03:54:44.880]  Click from the choices that are offered to you.
[03:54:44.880 --> 03:54:49.560]  And the people that designed those choices, they've programmed the decision tree.
[03:54:49.560 --> 03:54:51.000]  They know what you're going to pick.
[03:54:51.000 --> 03:54:53.200]  They've tilted the field.
[03:54:53.200 --> 03:55:01.440]  So if there is a tyranny that comes in this country, I would say that the majority of
[03:55:01.440 --> 03:55:06.640]  people will be wholly in line with it because the tyranny won't be presented in an Orwellian
[03:55:06.640 --> 03:55:07.640]  fashion.
[03:55:07.640 --> 03:55:12.440]  It'll be presented in a false free choice situation.
[03:55:12.440 --> 03:55:19.120]  Look, I've got five choices here, but all five choices were designed for you.
[03:55:19.120 --> 03:55:29.880]  So my plea is to shut off the screens, get outside, go for a run, ride a bike, ask somebody
[03:55:29.880 --> 03:55:32.160]  if they know where, how to go camping.
[03:55:32.160 --> 03:55:37.440]  I mean, there are so many people today have never spent a night in the woods in their
[03:55:37.440 --> 03:55:39.320]  life and don't want to.
[03:55:39.320 --> 03:55:46.960]  They can't imagine life outside of an air conditioned bubble, outside of being surrounded
[03:55:46.960 --> 03:55:52.200]  by computer screens, plugs in the ears, living in a virtual world.
[03:55:52.200 --> 03:55:59.480]  Well, the virtual world is going to steer you towards eventually a real cliff in terms
[03:55:59.480 --> 03:56:08.560]  of any kind of emerging form of tyranny, which is probably going to be where the humans are
[03:56:08.560 --> 03:56:13.200]  replaced with artificially intelligent robots.
[03:56:13.200 --> 03:56:16.120]  We're just going to be like the sheep on the sheep farm.
[03:56:16.120 --> 03:56:17.680]  There won't be a need for drivers.
[03:56:17.680 --> 03:56:23.080]  There won't be a need for people stocking shelves or doing warehouse work.
[03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:31.520]  There will be very little for humans and what will be the place for us actual humans.
[03:56:31.520 --> 03:56:33.480]  What will be left for us?
[03:56:33.480 --> 03:56:36.120]  What happens to sheep on a sheep farm?
[03:56:36.120 --> 03:56:41.680]  They might be fed and watered regularly, but eventually somebody just makes a decision,
[03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:46.280]  open that door and stick them in that warehouse and you never see them again.
[03:56:46.280 --> 03:56:50.640]  So anyway, what a gloomy way to end the show.
[03:56:50.640 --> 03:56:59.360]  But my plea is get outside, live in the real world, breathe the air, ride a bike, shoot
[03:56:59.360 --> 03:57:09.040]  a gun, get a fishing rod and catch a fish, go canoeing, do anything, but get outside.
[03:57:09.040 --> 03:57:16.560]  And I've been told that I might be on every Thursday from now on, fourth hour.
[03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:24.960]  So we'll see how it goes, I kind of got some personal things going on, might not have been
[03:57:24.960 --> 03:57:25.960]  totally prepared today.
[03:57:25.960 --> 03:57:33.760]  I hope you can put up with me and we'll see you next week in the same slot and maybe we'll
[03:57:33.760 --> 03:57:37.760]  have better news as the hammer comes down on the deep state two plotters.
[03:57:37.760 --> 03:57:40.560]  So I've been waiting for that for a long time.
[03:57:40.560 --> 03:57:46.680]  You like secret 12, this is secret 12, but twice as strong.
[03:57:46.680 --> 03:57:51.840]  So I called it ultra 12, most expensive vitamin B12, methylcobalamin and you put it under
[03:57:51.840 --> 03:57:56.840]  your tongue for about a minute and the longer you can do it, the better B12, just like clean
[03:57:56.840 --> 03:57:59.640]  iodine is essential, just like oxygen, just like water.
[03:57:59.640 --> 03:58:01.640]  The point is, it's amazing, you need it.
[03:58:01.640 --> 03:58:05.240]  It's awesome and it's the absolute go to, by the way, it tastes super sweet.
[03:58:05.240 --> 03:58:07.960]  So get your X2 and a free bottle of X3 right now.
[03:58:07.960 --> 03:58:12.960]  The new secret 12 plasaurus is known, ultra 12 for 50% off at enforce.com and for your
[03:58:12.960 --> 03:58:15.960]  wife, your husband, your family, for people that are out working in the fields, truck
[03:58:15.960 --> 03:58:19.040]  drivers, police officers, especially high stress folks, this is way better than an energy
[03:58:19.040 --> 03:58:20.040]  drink for me.
[03:58:20.040 --> 03:58:23.160]  And you take it with something like a turbo force or a rain force, it just makes it all
[03:58:23.160 --> 03:58:24.160]  better.
[03:58:24.160 --> 03:58:25.160]  But just experience this.
[03:58:25.160 --> 03:58:26.480]  That's right out of Mother Nature folks.
[03:58:26.480 --> 03:58:27.480]  That's pure B12.
[03:58:27.480 --> 03:58:28.480]  Show a mission.
