[00:00.000 --> 00:14.580]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.580 --> 00:32.060]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones okay I spent much
[00:32.060 --> 00:42.940]  of Friday and almost all of the Sunday broadcast talking about Rand Paul endorsing Mr. Mitt Romney
[00:42.940 --> 00:48.260]  for president and the libertarians have come out against the polls for this and Ron Paul's
[00:48.260 --> 00:53.100]  involved in it you better know that the whole thing's been concerted effort together there's
[00:53.100 --> 00:57.140]  a big firestorm over it but I'm not going to spend the entire broadcast dealing with this
[00:57.140 --> 01:04.500]  today we have an article up at info wars.com that deals with all of this I want to be clear I
[01:04.500 --> 01:09.700]  understand their political decision but I don't agree with it I think Ron Paul or Rand Paul are
[01:09.700 --> 01:15.300]  bad no it's just this is not the type of thing that we see from Ron Paul people say well Rand
[01:15.300 --> 01:22.220]  is not Ron well he sure campaigned like he was and we've seen a lot of changes taking place
[01:22.220 --> 01:32.380]  here's the headline Rand's Romney endorsement focused around 2016 presidential run by Paul
[01:32.380 --> 01:40.060]  Joseph Watson we're going to be going over that report coming up later in the hour and Webster
[01:40.060 --> 01:45.740]  Tarpley who just a week and a half ago at Bilderberg was laying out his concerns and I think
[01:45.740 --> 01:51.740]  he's been validated in many respects he's going to be joining us coming up in the third hour today
[01:51.740 --> 02:00.580]  Rand's Romney endorsement focused around 2016 presidential run Ron Paul campaign responds to
[02:00.580 --> 02:06.580]  controversy so they have responded not Ron Paul but Jack Hunter has come out and said well we
[02:06.580 --> 02:11.260]  want to get Rand you know in good with the Republicans so he can run in four years for
[02:11.260 --> 02:21.140]  president you were popular and had a Maverick constitutional base because you were different
[02:21.140 --> 02:26.780]  why not just endorse total war now why not endorse Patriot Act why not endorse everything
[02:26.780 --> 02:34.420]  that Romney supports carbon taxes you name it Obamacare and then we'll just elect you but
[02:34.420 --> 02:42.020]  it'll be Mitt Romney or Barack Obama in everything but name obviously you can sell out and get elected
[02:42.020 --> 02:48.220]  they're like hey don't you want us to get elected president or be VP don't you want that don't you
[02:48.220 --> 02:52.660]  want to win well that's not winning and they're like don't you see the logic while we're getting
[02:52.660 --> 03:00.020]  mainline Republicans to like it you mean the people that help bring us where we are today just
[03:00.020 --> 03:04.820]  like Obama hey Alex you don't like Bush you better support Obama it's just it's like talking to
[03:04.820 --> 03:12.260]  two-year-olds the same people that run Mitt Romney run Obama there's no difference that's why
[03:12.260 --> 03:17.700]  Ron Paul was special because he never compromised the whole system hated him he was a constitutionalist
[03:17.700 --> 03:22.220]  and that said I agree with a lot of Tarpleys analysis on the direction the polls are going
[03:22.220 --> 03:27.380]  I don't agree with his economic solutions and that Bilderberg likes the polls and you know
[03:27.380 --> 03:32.620]  saying that they want you know to get rid of the UN and all this stuff yes it does the
[03:32.620 --> 03:37.340]  Bilderberg group want to co-op libertarianism you bet they do so we'll have a discussion not
[03:37.340 --> 03:42.740]  a debate because Italy will go south very quickly with Tarpley yeah if we start arguing because
[03:42.740 --> 03:46.540]  I got an argument with him because I'm there to interview Jim Tucker Tarpleys there at a restaurant
[03:46.540 --> 03:52.140]  you know a few miles away from Bilderberg it's like 10 o'clock at night I'm I go to meet with Tucker
[03:52.140 --> 03:59.660]  there's Tarpley my friend I like him funny guy very interesting a real character and he's interrupting
[03:59.660 --> 04:04.220]  during the interview on the live feed and I go knock it off he goes you need to shut up and I said
[04:04.220 --> 04:08.780]  hey I'll go to you after I'm done with him I did an hour-plus interview Tarpleys like oh your
[04:08.780 --> 04:13.180]  battery's gonna run down I'm like hey it's a live stream ended up I mean it was just you know he
[04:13.180 --> 04:19.180]  Tarpleys so beside himself that he got aggressive with me so me and Tarpley are not fighting with
[04:19.180 --> 04:24.460]  each other he was tired I was tired I've been out bullhorning probably six seven hours that day I had
[04:24.460 --> 04:31.420]  no voice I sounded like humongous from the road warrior just bring out the gas we spare your lives
[04:32.220 --> 04:39.500]  so Tarpleys coming up now I got big breaking news from Jesse Ventura governor Jesse Ventura

[08:40.620 --> 08:46.620]  clearly have been caught lying on oath about shipping guns into mexico and hand grenades to try to
[08:46.620 --> 08:54.860]  then ban all semi-automatic firearms in this country their false flag has been caught wide open in
[08:54.860 --> 09:01.420]  the face of everyone if you're watching us at prison planet dot tv if you're an xm listener on
[09:01.420 --> 09:08.700]  166 or on an fm dial if you go up to info wars dot com you will see all of these articles almost
[09:08.700 --> 09:13.740]  all of these articles that i am looking at in front of me are linked or posted up on the site
[09:13.740 --> 09:19.740]  and as you can see if you're watching on television and and can see with the document cam i have an
[09:19.740 --> 09:27.980]  unusually large group of stacks there's more than well let's count them one two three four five six
[09:27.980 --> 09:32.940]  seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
[09:32.940 --> 09:36.780]  nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty
[09:36.780 --> 09:44.060]  seven twenty eight stacks i will do my best uh to go over all of these it's enough to actually
[09:44.060 --> 09:49.100]  scan over them and read them at at at home over the weekend and last night i am this morning
[09:49.100 --> 09:56.540]  and more is breaking as we go now obviously i'm going to get into the firestorm that is
[09:56.540 --> 10:02.620]  rand paul endorsing romney and some are saying the minority are saying hey who else is he supposed
[10:02.620 --> 10:10.860]  to endorse what do you like obama no the point is is that is this what you'd expect from ron paul
[10:10.860 --> 10:16.380]  or rand paul i mean this is mit romney we're talking about this guy might as well be obama
[10:16.380 --> 10:23.180]  that's how crazy this is and it's not just this radio show libertarian constitutional shows across
[10:23.180 --> 10:29.260]  the board the libertarian party you name it are in horror and lou rockwell and others who are good
[10:29.260 --> 10:35.020]  people say things like well you know what rand is not ron look that was a concerted thing last
[10:35.020 --> 10:39.580]  thursday where ron paul puts out the press release okay we can't win the delegates when they played
[10:39.580 --> 10:43.340]  folks telling them they could to keep momentum going knowing they couldn't three four months ago
[10:44.140 --> 10:49.740]  right as rand goes out on hanady and says that he is endorsing him because they have a lot in
[10:49.740 --> 10:58.940]  common i mean what did people expect this certainly diminishes the aura of being an outsider who
[10:58.940 --> 11:04.140]  never compromises that's all i'm saying are rand paul and ron paul bad no they're not they've got
[11:04.140 --> 11:09.020]  great voting records they're constitutionalists who fought the patriot act the police state the iraq
[11:09.020 --> 11:15.340]  war and so much more so i like them they've been on this show many many times but but but being friends
[11:15.340 --> 11:21.100]  of this show and coming on the show for 17 years as ron paul has done is not enough to get me to
[11:21.100 --> 11:26.220]  continue to turn away and act like i don't see what's happening in fact the libertarians in their
[11:26.220 --> 11:31.340]  press release say you know we looked the other way when you went for sanctions on iran we looked
[11:31.340 --> 11:36.700]  the other way with your rhetoric changing hoping we were wrong but now enough is enough and that's
[11:36.700 --> 11:43.020]  what happened benefit of the doubt benefit of the doubt but at a certain point it becomes chump land
[11:43.020 --> 11:52.460]  schmuck land sucker land dupe land useful idiot land and so i'm saying hey get back on the straight
[11:52.460 --> 11:58.940]  and narrow constitutional movement you're not going to make the republican establishment love you
[11:58.940 --> 12:05.100]  they're the same ones ran that tried to destroy you in kentucky i'm going to talk about that later
[12:05.100 --> 12:09.980]  with lev sir tarpoli in the third hour now i got a bunch of news i want to cover huge news with fast
[12:09.980 --> 12:17.420]  and furious the commerce secretary running into cars repeatedly three times and and leaving the scene
[12:18.140 --> 12:23.100]  we're going to be getting to all of that today the un announcing yes we are going to tax the
[12:23.100 --> 12:29.020]  internet and control sites and restrict free speech i mean it's all out in the open now
[12:30.140 --> 12:34.380]  everything's moving into high gear the the labor department wants to have journalists
[12:34.380 --> 12:39.580]  who are basically licensed by the government and and you're issued government computers
[12:40.540 --> 12:45.500]  that's what an internet id is is basically turns all the computers into government computers
[12:45.500 --> 12:50.860]  where they can tax you track you and shut you down and they're saying that's the plan they're
[12:50.860 --> 12:55.500]  trying to bring in a new dark age of control speaking of new dark age of control big article
[12:55.500 --> 13:01.660]  that went up last night at info wars dot com united nations envisions transhumanist future
[13:01.660 --> 13:08.540]  where man is obsolete this was put on by ray Kurzweil the un and the russian government
[13:08.540 --> 13:14.060]  was involved super creepy and at the bottom of the next hour i'm going to play the seven
[13:14.060 --> 13:18.860]  minute clip and then stop it and start it and analyze it they admit world government the end
[13:18.860 --> 13:25.580]  of humanity as we know it uh as if this is progress now this is directed to make technology
[13:25.580 --> 13:35.980]  oppressive and controlling and we're going to be going over all of that today we also have google
[13:38.220 --> 13:48.300]  and apple both launching drones all over europe the u.s and england it's not enough to have google
[13:48.300 --> 13:51.980]  cars driving around stealing your passwords and downloading everything off your computer
[13:51.980 --> 13:56.540]  you see they know it's less scary for whatever reason to have a company like google they have a
[13:56.540 --> 14:02.380]  sweet name do no evil don't be evil it's kind of like warren buffett hey i got an ice cream

[14:51.900 --> 14:55.900]  they were given the dragon x rocket and the technology and the infrastructure and it's
[14:55.900 --> 15:01.260]  hailed though most of its government funding and infrastructure as a libertarian adventure
[15:01.260 --> 15:07.180]  into space the space programs over the space shuttles over but your tax money now goes
[15:07.180 --> 15:12.860]  to a bunch of billionaire executives they don't want you thinking about space anymore

[16:48.300 --> 16:57.260]  after him and i called him and i said yeah a gentleman named chris kyle a navy seal sniper
[16:57.260 --> 17:03.500]  says he beat you up uh at this particular navy seal bar that happens to be owned by one of jesse's
[17:03.500 --> 17:09.580]  old-time friends and instructors and he's like you're joking alex you know you've never called
[17:09.580 --> 17:14.060]  him that's pretty funny and he started talking about hey what's going on and i said no seriously
[17:16.220 --> 17:21.020]  and he was like really and and then he went into town he has to drive into town like 50 miles to
[17:21.020 --> 17:26.300]  even get on the internet they've sometimes they can get on the web when wireless is working just
[17:26.300 --> 17:30.700]  right but the point is he went into town got on it i got him back on he came on and said this is
[17:30.700 --> 17:36.220]  totally untrue i was not punched out and he goes but that's not even the issue it's that i was saying

[18:15.900 --> 18:22.940]  media does it too they published chris kyle's book and it was all their shows that announced this
[18:22.940 --> 18:31.020]  when they knew he was out of the country so he couldn't really respond so the thing had a you
[18:31.020 --> 18:36.300]  know the total setup of a scyop and and and and jesse was blown away and he said well i'm gonna

[25:22.620 --> 25:28.220]  to sue when he got back i had talked to some other folks uh just as an aside knew he was planning
[25:28.220 --> 25:32.860]  something because the seals had challenged him to but i finally this morning driving to work i
[25:32.860 --> 25:39.420]  thought well why not call ventura i call him boom he answers hey alex how you doing uh in our
[25:39.420 --> 25:44.380]  interview uh tomorrow and i said yeah i noticed you're starting print today what's going on he
[25:44.380 --> 25:50.860]  goes well let me tell you he told me about the tv show you notice that was supposed to air like
[25:50.860 --> 25:55.420]  three four months ago and hasn't they're getting no word it's been done for months it's just sitting
[25:55.420 --> 26:03.420]  there got some of the top ratings on true tv third season i meant it of course and it's not come out
[26:03.420 --> 26:09.100]  yet and they're not getting answers doesn't look too good you know homeland security made threats
[26:09.100 --> 26:12.780]  i'm not allowed to give all the details out because i was told this in confidence but i can say they
[26:12.780 --> 26:18.060]  were threatened and some things happened there were some visits and i think i've said too much
[26:18.060 --> 26:23.020]  we're gonna i'm gonna see ventura may go all the way tomorrow it'll blow you away if you know the full
[26:23.020 --> 26:27.900]  story of what happened let me tell you we're not in kansas anymore and they had that fema homeland
[26:27.900 --> 26:34.460]  security concentration camp episode disappeared supposed to air about 50 times aired one time
[26:35.500 --> 26:42.540]  erased off the dvr's well now the whole series may go into the black hole in fact pressure
[26:42.540 --> 26:48.140]  and talking about it may force it out there that's why true tv is approached me about my own show
[26:49.260 --> 26:52.300]  and they're like you don't want to fly out here and talk about doing a show and i'm like no
[26:53.020 --> 26:58.700]  i really don't because you wouldn't let my information on air unless it was tainted i don't
[26:58.700 --> 27:05.260]  know how they got two seasons out the best most avant garde research i've ever seen it's not perfect
[27:05.260 --> 27:13.580]  but it's pretty darn close and it was done from a heart of of liberty from a perspective of truth
[27:13.580 --> 27:18.380]  and it got too popular and uh well that's a side issue here's the breaking news
[27:20.140 --> 27:24.140]  ventura had said he was going to probably sue him but then he thought you know what the guy just
[27:24.140 --> 27:30.860]  wants publicity i'm staying in uh mexico half the year i'm not going to do it but he got contacted
[27:30.860 --> 27:39.580]  by terry moi known as terry mother moi one of the most famous navy seals ever navy seal trainer
[27:40.780 --> 27:46.140]  and he got contacted by other navy seals you know a famous navy seal owns the bar that this
[27:46.140 --> 27:50.940]  supposedly happened in and the navy seals had their own investigation and they said this is
[27:50.940 --> 27:57.100]  totally made up they found out that ventura had been there to be at an event he was invited at
[27:57.100 --> 28:02.460]  had not spoken like the god said turns out had not even been at the bar that day and that none of this
[28:02.460 --> 28:11.180]  happened and ventura contacted through his lawyers uh chris kyle and said are you sure you didn't get
[28:11.180 --> 28:21.900]  in a fight with somebody else and uh chris kyle uh this went to court last week on june 4th uh in
[28:21.900 --> 28:30.380]  minneapolis st paul to federal court there and at the preliminary settlement hearing uh they
[28:30.380 --> 28:35.740]  ventura offered the details of their settlement admit you're lying and pay for the attorney's
[28:35.740 --> 28:39.980]  fees basically and i'm not supposed to even get into the whole story we'll just i know paul watchens
[28:39.980 --> 28:46.140]  write the article right now they gave him the settlement offered to admit he was lying and uh
[28:46.140 --> 28:51.500]  you know to shut this down and chris kyle who knows he'll be destroyed if he gets found out
[28:51.500 --> 28:58.220]  said i'm going ahead with this show it's going to court lawsuits deposition lawsuits been filed
[28:58.220 --> 29:04.380]  obviously but it's it's going to go into the full lawsuit now and ventura was just going to drop it
[29:04.380 --> 29:11.100]  until terry mother moe mother moe is his nickname called him and and others and said we know this
[29:11.100 --> 29:16.860]  isn't true we're sick of all these navy seal movies with real navy seals in them army special
[29:16.860 --> 29:22.700]  forces doesn't do this doesn't get involved in hollywood uh other special services delta force
[29:22.700 --> 29:29.820]  doesn't this is an embarrassment and we believe that chris kyle did this purely to sell books
[29:30.540 --> 29:36.700]  and and and stabs the seals in the back and so they said you have got an order in fact he said he
[29:36.700 --> 29:41.740]  was told he was ordered by the other navy seals including his former commanding officers that
[29:41.740 --> 29:47.020]  that's the quote you are ordered to sue him and you were ordered to bring him to justice so there

[33:25.340 --> 33:47.820]  okay here's the deal
[33:47.820 --> 33:54.460]  we're going to open the phones up right now any issue you wish you'd discuss
[33:55.340 --> 33:59.660]  obviously i would imagine a lot of you want to talk about rand paul endorsing mitt romney
[34:01.180 --> 34:12.940]  the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 i've had time now first i got upset
[34:12.940 --> 34:21.740]  friday hearing the news of rand endorsing mitt romney i got angry by yesterday and and and now
[34:21.740 --> 34:27.500]  look it is just the politically expedient establishment thing to do to endorse mitt romney
[34:29.180 --> 34:33.420]  who's for abortion open borders carbon taxes restrictions on the second amendment
[34:33.420 --> 34:39.980]  and helped write obama care but if rand paul thinks it makes him mainline in the republican party
[34:39.980 --> 34:47.420]  i had a being vp or running in four years it hurts you with the base who are for no compromise
[34:47.420 --> 34:54.060]  all we do is compromise but the real reason i'm so disgusted is just with a political process itself
[34:54.860 --> 35:00.620]  liberty is in such trouble corruption is so out of control we put up with pretty much anything
[35:00.620 --> 35:06.700]  today and if you had told me six months ago that rand paul would endorsement romney i mean i remember
[35:06.700 --> 35:11.580]  people saying look at how paul isn't attacking mitt in the debates look at how they keep saying
[35:11.580 --> 35:17.100]  get the delegates that's a plan to bring the delegates in for political power within the party
[35:17.100 --> 35:22.060]  but you know they're basically lying to their constituents implying they could still win you
[35:22.060 --> 35:29.180]  all of that is what concerns me and that's what concerns the supporters
[35:29.180 --> 35:37.740]  of rand paul and ram paul they're saying the exact same things i'm saying at the libertarian party
[35:37.740 --> 35:45.580]  in their press release they're saying the same thing basically across the board and they're
[35:45.580 --> 35:50.940]  saying you know now he's voting for sanctions which is an act of war which his dad has said
[35:50.940 --> 35:58.700]  is an act of war against iran i mean is there nothing he won't compromise on this is this
[35:58.700 --> 36:07.500]  is basically the boulder that broke the camel's back it's not a straw and now that aura of of
[36:08.540 --> 36:16.780]  uprightness is gone and ron paul coordinated this through campaign for liberty and through his
[36:16.780 --> 36:23.900]  congressional system everything's coordinated ran ran and ron lived together in dc now that's on record
[36:23.900 --> 36:28.620]  and the whole thing was coordinated last thursday and people are like oh no ron paul's been betrayed
[36:28.620 --> 36:33.340]  no he hasn't you know we can blame jessie benton for things ron paul's done we can blame
[36:33.340 --> 36:40.380]  rand paul all day in the final equation whatever's going on here ron paul is behind
[36:41.820 --> 36:48.060]  unless he comes out and criticizes all of this and i said friday ron paul you need to come out
[36:48.060 --> 36:52.140]  with a press conference or a new statement and he didn't they had the head of campaign for liberty
[36:52.140 --> 36:58.540]  come out jack hunter and say hey we're just positioning him with the republicans we're
[36:58.540 --> 37:04.460]  playing politics to get them on our side well come out for an iran attack then come out for
[37:04.460 --> 37:09.580]  torture come out for the patriot act come out for naked body scanners come out for nato commanding
[37:09.580 --> 37:16.220]  the u.s military just just do what the main line republicans do then we had to prod ron paul to get
[37:16.220 --> 37:22.940]  behind congressman jones's legislation to start the impeachment over the un and nato commanding our
[37:22.940 --> 37:29.660]  military and he didn't really speak about it much i mean i saw ron paul about four five months ago
[37:29.660 --> 37:34.940]  start getting very milk toast and i saw people out there notice it and get concerned and i said
[37:34.940 --> 37:40.220]  look they got a strategy to get to the youth they're educating people you know hey let's
[37:40.220 --> 37:45.740]  leave ron paul alone think about the real enemies the new world order and i think that's why i kind
[37:45.740 --> 37:50.380]  of backlash a little harder than i probably normally would have because people say well
[37:50.380 --> 37:55.660]  which is it you knew this was coming or you got chumped i my gut knew it was coming and i was
[37:55.660 --> 38:01.180]  concerned and i lied to myself that's the answer because in one breath i'm like i thought something
[38:01.180 --> 38:06.140]  like this was coming down the road but then i'm like but i got chumped it's kind of like you get
[38:06.140 --> 38:11.660]  that feeling that your that your girlfriend's cheating on you and you go you know what i've
[38:11.660 --> 38:17.420]  never really been a paranoid type guy but i think i'll drive over to her house sure this happened
[38:17.420 --> 38:23.900]  everybody in college or high school and uh you drive over and there she is getting in the car with
[38:23.900 --> 38:36.940]  the other guy so there you go so did you get chumped by her if you knew something was going on
[38:36.940 --> 38:43.820]  i mean it's kind of both now again i'm not saying this is an outright betrayal but it begins to go
[38:43.820 --> 38:49.820]  into that territory so i want to get your take on all of this again here's the headline at info
[38:49.820 --> 38:56.220]  wars dot com rand's romney endorsement focused around 2016 presidential run ron paul campaign
[38:56.220 --> 39:03.180]  responds to controversy and their thing is hey we're just playing politics oh well that i i didn't
[39:03.180 --> 39:09.820]  think that was the paul brand that i bought into they're like hey rand's not ron really the fundraiser
[39:10.380 --> 39:16.300]  letters i get sure implied that when i supported him he sure acted like that and i don't like the
[39:16.300 --> 39:20.700]  drifting i've seen we've seen a lot of drifting let's say he was right on target
[39:25.900 --> 39:32.940]  two years ago with ron paul and then he drifted 30 40 degrees or so there's a big drift here and it's
[39:32.940 --> 39:37.500]  it's going so so we're hey we don't like that and some people are like hey we're winning
[39:37.500 --> 39:43.100]  you know what do you want obama no i don't want obama and i don't want mint romney either again
[39:43.100 --> 39:48.220]  it's that false choice hey do you want grape flavored cyanide kool-aid or cherry flavor or how
[39:48.220 --> 39:54.300]  about coconut or or how about uh raspberry or we have strawberry i'm like but it's the same thing
[39:54.300 --> 39:59.020]  it's some food coloring some sugar and some cyanide i don't want any of these
[39:59.020 --> 40:05.660]  it's kind of like which amusement park do you want to go to for vacation you can go to
[40:05.660 --> 40:11.740]  anyone you want this is a sales tactic you can go to disney world or you can go to you can go to
[40:11.740 --> 40:18.300]  six flags or you can go to sea world water parks and i'm like you know what i don't i don't like
[40:18.300 --> 40:23.740]  big crowds i how about i don't want to go to any of those i think i'm going to take my kids to the
[40:23.740 --> 40:31.100]  coast oh you just don't want to go on vacation see it's these mind games they play with us
[40:31.660 --> 40:37.660]  if mint romney wasn't such a total betrayer in his entire career
[40:39.820 --> 40:46.540]  a fake goody two shoes behavior i could say well i think we're going to get betrayed but obama's
[40:46.540 --> 40:52.060]  so bad moving so quick let's repudiate all the crimes of obama by getting mint romney in there
[40:52.060 --> 40:57.980]  how about we impeach obama how about we start arresting the criminals like holder boy let me
[40:57.980 --> 41:02.220]  tell you republicans started doing that try to get but see they can't because they're all involved
[41:02.220 --> 41:06.300]  too what does holders say and i predicted the six months before it happened what did holders say
[41:09.420 --> 41:13.100]  when it was brought up hey you lied in fast furious he said uh bush was running similar
[41:13.100 --> 41:20.620]  programs and iso went uh meeting adjourned let's not go there because they're all involved in
[41:20.620 --> 41:25.980]  iran contra type stuff before iran contra even happened guns into the country to control the
[41:25.980 --> 41:33.660]  drugs the drugs back in i mean do you think the 500 billion dollars plus in drug money a year just
[41:33.660 --> 41:38.700]  in the united states do you really think that crack house with no windows with some crack
[41:38.700 --> 41:42.380]  whores walking around out front of it do you really think they're managing that 500 billion
[41:42.380 --> 41:51.420]  no we know who's managing it wells fargo and wakovia 376 billion from 2008 to 2010 alone
[41:51.420 --> 41:59.020]  source ap bloomberg fox roiders you name it the troops start complaining about growing the opium
[41:59.900 --> 42:08.300]  they just have the troops standing formation in front of bbc abc fox cnn on every channel
[42:08.300 --> 42:12.860]  yeah we help grow it we don't like it but if we don't the al-qaeda will get the money
[42:12.860 --> 42:18.460]  the al-qaeda will get the money that you know the the the the the garden gnomes that we're
[42:18.460 --> 42:22.780]  all supposed to be so afraid of will get us the same ones they're publicly using to give libya
[42:22.780 --> 42:29.260]  over to and now syria publicly they have al-qaeda blowing up police stations and military bases
[42:29.260 --> 42:34.140]  engaging in massacres they got caught planning a chemical attack this weekend that was going
[42:34.140 --> 42:40.300]  to be blamed on on Assad with hillary running around saying we've got to invade she starts crying on
[42:40.300 --> 42:46.780]  stage the massacres are so horrible look here's a picture of a dead woman i mean these are people
[42:46.780 --> 42:54.940]  who will kill millions to take over areas ethnic cleansing of 40 plus thousand black people lined
[42:54.940 --> 42:59.980]  up and shot or machete much of it on video and hillary's laughing we came we saw he died
[42:59.980 --> 43:04.940]  haha yeah he came in did what we said invested his country's money with us we invited him and
[43:04.940 --> 43:09.100]  stole it and killed people and turned loose al-qaeda to kill the blacks and by the way we're
[43:09.100 --> 43:13.660]  gonna al-qaeda says they're gonna kill all the jews in syria and force the christians out
[43:13.660 --> 43:17.980]  i mean that's official al-qaeda and they're gonna go into syria they're gonna force the christians
[43:17.980 --> 43:22.780]  out they're gonna kill the jews it'll be in the back of the newspaper oh it'll even be in the news
[43:22.780 --> 43:32.140]  like you don't know what you're reading like you're an idiot like i'm an idiot oh we gotta
[43:32.140 --> 43:37.580]  give our rights up al-qaeda al-qaeda meanwhile al-qaeda publicly works for the big mega banks
[43:39.740 --> 43:43.900]  after a weekend of rage amongst ron paul supporters of aran paul's endorsement of
[43:43.900 --> 43:49.020]  mint romney the ron paul campaign has issued its first quasi official response to the controversy
[43:49.020 --> 43:53.820]  in the form of a video blog by jack hunter who argues that the endorsement is a political move
[43:55.100 --> 44:02.140]  and we get political moves politics over principle designed to position the kentucky
[44:02.140 --> 44:07.660]  senator to be a presidential run in 16 yeah designed to position all the political hacks
[44:07.660 --> 44:13.020]  a lot of a mainline republican strategist that they brought into rand and ron's offices
[44:13.020 --> 44:20.380]  and by the way folks if i wanted to go after ron paul and ran i could do it what families told me
[44:20.380 --> 44:25.340]  what high-level staff have told me stuff going back a while and i'm like man i'm really worried
[44:25.340 --> 44:29.660]  about all these mainline republicans i mean erin dykes for heaven sakes took went with his mother
[44:29.660 --> 44:35.500]  a few years ago to dc and went into ron paul's office and said oh yeah uh hi we're here uh you
[44:35.500 --> 44:40.300]  know i work with alex jones and the staffers began to jump up and down hissing basically saying we
[44:40.300 --> 44:46.060]  hate alex jones until other staffers came and said oh no no no we like alex jones there's been an
[44:46.060 --> 44:51.900]  internal war with a bunch of little rich kids that want to be politicians infesting the paul
[44:51.900 --> 44:58.220]  operation and the fact that they were there beforehand they weren't influencing things though
[44:58.220 --> 45:03.900]  now it appears they're starting to take over so we're saying great take over play politics
[45:03.900 --> 45:11.260]  we're not going to be part of it very simple free country enjoy yourselves jesse benton but
[45:11.260 --> 45:16.780]  next time i get republican mail that i never got until i gave money to ron paul and ran paul
[45:17.420 --> 45:22.540]  from every republican candidate you can imagine neocons you name it i mean what did somebody steal
[45:22.540 --> 45:29.820]  the list of ron paul donors no campaign for liberty is pimping the list out and getting
[45:29.820 --> 45:37.740]  upwards of 10 percent of the money raised for other candidates and and look that's fine so
[45:39.020 --> 45:42.300]  so jesse benton can make more than carl roe the half million dollars a year
[45:43.020 --> 45:48.300]  whatever okay i'm gonna stop right there like i said some of you neocon libertarians are like
[45:48.300 --> 45:53.660]  alex you better not badmouth paul you better shut up if you think i'm trying to bring down ron paul
[45:53.660 --> 46:00.860]  shut up shut up you little neocon scum shut up or i'll sink your entire ship right now shut up
[46:00.860 --> 46:07.660]  shut up do you read me shut up shut up stop trying to steal this country and take over
[46:07.660 --> 46:13.340]  and ruin ron paul's legacy and ruin ran paul you're screwing up a chance to take this country back
[46:13.340 --> 46:19.580]  you morons all of you with your little speech impediments and the rest of it you know what i'm
[46:19.580 --> 46:26.140]  talking about all right that's enough i'm gonna stop right there okay again i understand why they
[46:26.140 --> 46:32.220]  did this i don't agree with it and i'm done talking about it for now i got all this other news i'm
[46:32.220 --> 46:38.940]  gonna cover and take your calls it just that i start thinking about my hot button issues here
[46:40.140 --> 46:45.100]  campaign for liberty is endorsing all these neocons now i mean i just if it keeps going this way
[46:45.100 --> 46:50.540]  i'm going to have to assemble all the evidence and just so it's clear that i have nothing to
[46:50.540 --> 46:54.780]  do with it i'm gonna have to come after you politically and you're a bunch of arrogant
[46:54.780 --> 47:00.940]  fools you think i want to hurt you bad politically you guys are so arrogant up there now so starstruck
[47:01.820 --> 47:05.820]  i've talked to when i go yeah ron paul's really becoming popular with the most yeah he's a rock
[47:05.820 --> 47:09.820]  star you're sitting there talking to the press secretary the person's all getting off on it
[47:09.820 --> 47:15.020]  someone who's never had media power and you're listening to him and you find out that people
[47:15.020 --> 47:21.020]  are on power trips now ron paul isn't i don't think rand is but let me tell you something get a hold
[47:21.020 --> 47:25.020]  of all those snot-nosed people you got working for you or we'll get a hold of them for you
[47:28.620 --> 47:33.180]  i'm gonna stop right there i meant to be nice
[47:38.700 --> 47:42.140]  if rand has not endorsed ronnie 2012 every single republican in the race
[47:42.140 --> 47:46.220]  would use his non endorsement to bash senator paul relentlessly like they did your father
[47:46.220 --> 47:51.820]  that's what people want to see it's popular to be contrarian that's why ron paul was really
[47:51.820 --> 47:56.380]  winning and got cheated argues hunter adding that paul would be blamed for obama achieving a second
[47:56.380 --> 48:03.180]  term in office no you just point out that you're not endorsing either one of them or you make a
[48:03.180 --> 48:09.340]  joke and say i support ronnie obama 2012 you have a co-presidency because their policies are exactly
[48:09.340 --> 48:15.420]  the same should rand paul be victorious in securing the 16 republican nomination and going to become
[48:15.420 --> 48:20.140]  president will anyone care if rand paul endorsed mint romney for president 2012 ask hunter see
[48:20.140 --> 48:25.100]  there's the disconnect hey why not have ron paul endorse some wars if it gets him elected you know
[48:25.100 --> 48:30.780]  why not compromise similarly hunter argues that if mint romney won ran would have more leverage to
[48:30.780 --> 48:35.100]  become a strong critic and a rallying point for other tea party lawmakers should romney become
[48:35.100 --> 48:40.460]  the george w bush 2.0 oh i think it'll be worse there is no shame in compromising politically
[48:40.460 --> 48:45.420]  to achieve principles compromised to achieve principles boy you talk about doublespeak
[48:45.420 --> 48:49.900]  but we can never compromise our principles to simply advance politically states hunter that's
[48:49.900 --> 48:54.140]  what you just did noting that senator paul's voting record is consistently pro-liberty uh
[48:54.140 --> 49:00.300]  sanctions on iran should i go on and here's my quote in here that i sent to paul i'm gonna add
[49:00.300 --> 49:04.460]  a line here although i was initially very hurt and angry i understand politically why the
[49:04.460 --> 49:09.340]  decision was taken the source of my real anger in disgust is the corrupt political process itself
[49:09.340 --> 49:15.340]  said jones people love ron paul because he never compromises principles it's about principles
[49:15.340 --> 49:21.580]  not politics america needs principles because compromise politics has gotten us where we are
[49:21.580 --> 49:27.180]  today pointing out that it was delusional to think that ron paul was not involved in rand's
[49:27.180 --> 49:34.700]  decision jones believes the move is a miscalculation the paul's are an ally for liberty in government
[49:34.700 --> 49:38.540]  but their decision to integrate themselves with republican establishment will backfire in the
[49:38.540 --> 49:47.260]  long run warned the radio host and it just goes on yeah i understand why they did it
[49:47.260 --> 49:55.020]  but i don't agree with them and i don't like the sharp-eyed politicos that they're surrounding
[49:55.020 --> 50:02.780]  them with okay okay it's just that simple and i'm not going to just play along so i can get
[50:02.780 --> 50:07.580]  people on my radio show and you know get invited to the inauguration or something i could care less
[50:07.580 --> 50:13.340]  i've been around national politics i've been around big listening media complexes it's a
[50:13.340 --> 50:20.300]  bunch of fake plastic empty people but for folks out there that aren't confident and don't feel
[50:20.300 --> 50:26.380]  fulfilled the power of having staffers kissing your rump and the suits and the helicopters
[50:26.380 --> 50:34.300]  and the media appearances and all of it people buy into the delusion and i'm not buying into it and
[50:34.300 --> 50:39.660]  i know that if obama gets in it's going to be a disaster and if mit romney does it's going to
[50:39.660 --> 50:45.100]  be a disaster because the globalists own them this is the globalist agenda the new world order
[50:45.100 --> 50:50.940]  something we don't hear about very often from the paul's now so get back to your roots call

[54:28.620 --> 54:34.540]  in virginia dean you're on the air broadcasted worldwide thank you for joining us what's on
[54:34.540 --> 54:42.860]  your mind today i'm confused i've i've seen and i've watched your uh support of the paul's for
[54:42.860 --> 54:49.020]  many many years and what confuses me that the total support that you and his the listeners and the
[54:49.020 --> 54:54.780]  viewers give that he didn't before and this is by the way the paul's decision that seems
[54:54.780 --> 54:58.620]  happened right after the bill berg meeting and all of a sudden they come out with the support
[54:58.620 --> 55:03.580]  of romney what surprises me is that with all your support that he didn't have the decency
[55:04.220 --> 55:09.980]  to contact you back channels or even private privately well here's the deal paul said four
[55:09.980 --> 55:15.820]  years ago without me asking on air that half his support in the in the first campaign came from
[55:15.820 --> 55:21.180]  this show and that's why ron paul's always come back here i mean i was interviewing ron paul 16
[55:21.180 --> 55:27.260]  and a half years ago before almost anybody knew who he was and you know their view is now they've
[55:27.260 --> 55:33.340]  hired a bunch of high-powered republican people and they don't need alex shone's anymore they don't
[55:33.340 --> 55:38.700]  need their this this move they knew there was going to be a backlash they say we want the main
[55:38.700 --> 55:44.300]  line republicans now dad's retiring he'll go off and speak to student groups and i guess raise money
[55:44.860 --> 55:51.980]  for rand and rand is being brought down the aisle in a big white bride dress to to get married to
[55:51.980 --> 55:56.940]  the republican establishment and i'm just saying i'm not going to the wedding i mean i hope that you
[55:56.940 --> 56:01.340]  know rand takes off the dress and runs out and decides not to do it i mean i think this is a
[56:01.340 --> 56:07.660]  bad move what do you think i think they should have still contacted you to discuss it with you
[56:07.660 --> 56:13.500]  since you almost basically put them uh notoriety where they are well our listeners our listeners
[56:13.500 --> 56:18.540]  were a key part of the launch pad maybe 30 40 of it but let's not listen it's not about contacting
[56:18.540 --> 56:23.580]  me it's the way it was announced on hanity the way the dad put out the thing yes now we can't
[56:23.580 --> 56:27.740]  win with the delegates when it was clear they couldn't win months before and and and and like
[56:27.740 --> 56:33.100]  you know really just using that as a base to raise money while they knew that they were going to do
[56:33.100 --> 56:38.300]  this down the road and undoubtedly there were meetings back months ago now that all of this it
[56:38.300 --> 56:43.740]  just i you know what i keep intending to come on air and just say let's move forward let's because
[56:43.740 --> 56:49.420]  it just becomes demoralizing the good news is liberty so popular that ron paul won the first
[56:49.420 --> 56:55.820]  few states and the system had to steal it and they should have realized that and stayed with it for
[56:55.820 --> 57:00.220]  principle that's the only way they're going to have an effect we got a hundred other or you know
[57:00.220 --> 57:06.220]  creepy old men who were senators who sell out nobody knows who they are i think they've made
[57:06.220 --> 57:11.580]  a big mistake because all their advisors are politicos and they want to make money off the
[57:11.580 --> 57:17.180]  election system campaign for liberty now pimps all these neocon campaigns and runs them for them
[57:18.300 --> 57:23.180]  and so i don't see them taking over the republican party i see the opposite now i see some good
[57:23.180 --> 57:29.580]  candidates coming out of it and that's fine and we're here to say hey get back on the liberty
[57:29.580 --> 57:38.060]  track right now i appreciate your call sir noel in chicago you're on the air uh hey alex on uh i'm
[57:38.060 --> 57:45.260]  still first off i'm still shocked that ran would do this but i'm not surprised back on may 15th
[57:45.260 --> 57:50.780]  jessie betton they had that that was the day after oh ron paul dropped out but didn't dropped out he
[57:50.780 --> 57:56.620]  had a teleconference where he admitted that ran paul was going to endorse the nominee
[57:56.620 --> 58:01.340]  it was quite obvious the nominee was going to be romney so that was the first indication that
[58:01.340 --> 58:05.340]  something was wrong exactly and notice they keep trying to let it out like you know what in church
[58:05.900 --> 58:10.940]  yeah okay our campaign's over but it's not supporters keep giving us money oh we're still
[58:10.940 --> 58:15.580]  going to tampa but be respectful we're not going to win by the way meant romney exactly i don't
[58:15.580 --> 58:22.460]  they're playing politics with us and i don't like that anything else yeah on friday i interviewed
[58:22.460 --> 58:31.660]  ran paul in chicago at the c-pack chicago convention and it was it was just so odd seeing ran paul i asked
[58:31.660 --> 58:35.340]  him about bill de burg i asked him about wait a minute are you the guy that asked him about

[01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:03.340]  of just a few months ago we are changed lucrodowski talked to senator paul about bill neberg and he
[01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:10.220]  said it's a bad group and should be investigated he was asked by reporters in chicago uh friday and
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.980]  i believe it's the same guy that just got in will play the club and then asked him well this is him
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:18.860]  and ran said uh look i mean he never really answers the earlier questions and then he says well i've
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:23.340]  already talked to you and then he walks away no comment i thought it was barbara boxer or something
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:29.500]  again they're now making political decisions i mean listen to this hunter guy you know in the
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.620]  campaign for liberty going well we've got to do this to make republicans like us no you take them
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:40.540]  over you educate them you don't again if he would have come out at the thing and said well he's our
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:45.980]  nominee i'll be encouraging you meant to do the right thing then it'd be well okay but instead
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:52.220]  we've got a lot in common and clearly he wants the vp slot i mean you know that's what's going on
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:57.500]  it's about their political dynasty having power not about doing the right thing let's go ahead and
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.620]  play this clip here's rand paul friday being questioned about bill deberg
[01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:06.860]  senator can you just one quick question as we get we can walk and talk i gotta keep going just
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.740]  walk and talk uh it was reported senator john carrey was at the bill deberg meeting in virginia
[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:15.180]  would you support looking into whether or not he violated the law that's right
[01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:26.620]  there you go no comment and he's got the little cute c you know aides everybody walking directing
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:33.900]  him like he's the queen b or something and i mean i remember calling up rand paul get him on the show
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:39.180]  pushed him to run going i don't know you know talking to him off air my supporters going up
[01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.260]  there forming the core of his people they've all gone off to run other campaigns and try to get
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:50.540]  constitutionalist in uh was that uh you there asking the question noel uh in that video but
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:55.020]  yeah that was me up it's truly in the well rough say oh alex i just felt bad calling in the last
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:03:01.580]  couple of weeks i used my middle name today but that was me i was alex it's crazy to see the
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:09.020]  so the total 360 degree shift from rand paul and the whole paul campaign uh you mean a hundred
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:14.140]  day degree a 360 would be right back where he started back to yeah yeah that's right man 180
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:20.700]  degrees uh it looked like rand paul he had guilt on his face alex it looked like you know he he knows
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:26.700]  the backlash that's coming earlier in that video he went up to a paul supporter paul delegate nasta
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:32.620]  do you think everyone's going to be mad at me and uh i kind of thought that was funny he knows uh
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:38.940]  what he did he knows the backlash that's coming and um you know it was weird alex he was trying to
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:44.780]  be nice to corporate media at cpaq chicago and all friendly to them but an independent journalist
[01:03:44.780 --> 01:03:51.260]  who voted for his dad in the primary in in illinois total totally ignored total uh like well he's
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:57.660]  a senator now and he's important to me you know he met with mit romney and he's going places he's
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:02.780]  going to live in the big town in the big house because he's big time in fact can we come in with

[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:30.140]  this system's coming down okay and to see the pauls jump on to the sinking republicanoid ship

[01:12:12.940 --> 01:12:18.380]  ran paul situation around paul but i've been meaning to tell you in the last few times i called i
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:23.980]  wanted to really commend you guys and your crew uh the pit stop you took a few months ago and how
[01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:30.380]  you revamped the whole system your prison planet tv in the nightly news it looks as professional or
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:34.620]  better than any well we're about to upgrade it again we may have to take another pit stop because
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:40.620]  i've got 600 videos to choose who the winners are i'm trying to hire other reporters right now and i'm
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:45.020]  some nights don't leave here till 10 o'clock at night and and there's just not physically enough
[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:50.380]  people and then folks get their vacation now they got to go to weddings and stuff so right now
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:55.500]  two or three people are on vacation it's crippling us but uh yes we're we're going to keep upgrading
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:13:01.020]  everything sir we're trying our hardest here uh okay now here's what i wanted to say you know
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:07.420]  first of all you know there's too much of this and you know go along to get a long mentality
[01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:13.820]  in american politics that's our problem and you know like adams wrote that article that you had
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:20.460]  posted on uh the website there about uh you know possible motive you know could be trying to be a
[01:13:20.460 --> 01:13:26.060]  double agent real rand paul well no that's what politics is as you start diluting yourself
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:31.820]  that flip-flopping is the way to you know do a greater good and and at first his body language
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:36.140]  is he hated endorsing romney but then he gets into it and starts talking about how great he is i'm
[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:41.660]  sorry go ahead right well you know he made the statement you don't do deals with the devil and
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:45.740]  i don't know if you remember well you remember this you got a great memory back remember several
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:52.060]  months ago where uh the media was coming out and of course we just thought it was them uh trying to
[01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:58.540]  you know hijack ron paul's campaign and stop him because the you know he can't win etc that stuff
[01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:03.180]  wasn't yeah the media's hey they're meeting behind closed doors hey he's gonna he's meeting with rand
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:08.460]  they're playing softball santorum was saying that we're like oh that's not true and looks like it was
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:14.620]  true i think that was the last time if i remember it that you actually uh yeah interviewed ron paul
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:19.740]  you asked him about that and he of course said i'm not aware of anything like that you know denied
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:25.900]  and repudiated it but you know what struck me is really odd just recently was you know in texas
[01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:30.700]  when they had the primaries that's when they said okay romney's quenched it he's the nominee
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:36.540]  but not one before that if you remember you know ron paul and you've hit on this a lot he just all
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.540]  of a sudden said we're not going to focus on campaigning in these states we're just going
[01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:46.700]  to focus on the delegate process yeah that was the behind the scenes operation that the deals
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:52.220]  had already been made exactly yeah that just struck me is so odd it's like you sound like
[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:58.220]  you're just giving up and quitting because here's the thing it doesn't matter what kind of opposition
[01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:03.740]  you're getting or who's saying what or whatever if you really believe in what you're professing to
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:10.380]  stand for and you're a person of integrity you're going to stand to the end and endure if you remember
[01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:16.060]  and uh romney python they put out that in church of the holy grail and i don't advocate this way
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:20.300]  but there was a scene with the black knight you know the guy in church of it he cut off his arm
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:28.140]  it's a mere flesh wound i am the nice to say neat neat neat you know that's the thing maybe they did
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:33.980]  cut right you know the shrubbery so to speak you know with you know the attacks and everything but
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:40.860]  even if you can't win so-called you still stick by the stuff and stand by your principles and you
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:46.780]  know how it's i'll just finish with this they say every man has his price not the man who sold out
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:51.660]  he has nothing to sell no matter how high the price i hear you i hear you and i appreciate all the
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:59.820]  points you've made look i understand the mindset that they believe that they can take over the
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:07.020]  republican party but that's not what's happening and this is not compromise we always give in
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:11.420]  and the system always says be reasonable give us a little of what we want and then we give them
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:16.940]  what they want be reasonable give us a little bit of what we want and there's more and more people
[01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:23.660]  are realizing that's why we've gotten this position but it it's almost a diversion to even talk about
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:31.020]  this this just illustrates how bankrupt the political process is every time we stand up and
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:37.020]  don't back off we win for decades they said there was no such thing as a gina 21 now they've had to
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:43.820]  admit it's real and are having to have a debate with us americans haven't backed off on the second
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:48.060]  amendment and have said no we're not putting up with it and so now we're starting to reverse
[01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:55.180]  some of the stuff same thing on abortion who is strong is who knows they're right and doesn't
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:17:03.500]  compromise we have the moral high ground but we don't use it we don't use it ron paul is not even
[01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:10.380]  that good of a speaker he's a historian economist smart guy not a very eloquent speaker but he was
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:16.620]  very popular because he didn't compromise that's all he had that's all they had that was the magic
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:22.540]  that in a world of universal deceit telling the truth was a revolutionary act and the minute you
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:27.340]  start playing politics i mean if you do it a little bit because i've seen ron paul confronted on
[01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:33.020]  9 11 and he and i mean he knows about false flag he's very informed he's like i'm sorry i just
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:40.060]  haven't had a lot of time to look into it i can i know ron paul's a good guy at heart but obviously
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:45.180]  they're scared of 9 11 truth and i understood that politics wise so said leave him alone on that issue
[01:17:45.180 --> 01:17:50.620]  you so you know i'm being a hypocrite because i'm saying hey you've got to be a purist none of
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:56.380]  this are totally pure we do little things but when you say hey mit romney's a great guy
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:03.180]  and then defend it and then a bunch of other things their people have done that's why you
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:10.140]  put it all together we're letting them know this is a big deal hey buddy if you want to compromise
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:15.740]  we can vote for other people too that are compromising you've just made yourself like everybody else
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:22.220]  let's go ahead and talk to john in brooklyn new york you're on the air welcome
[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:28.620]  hi good afternoon do you hear me yes sir yeah i would like to ask you two things please um
[01:18:29.180 --> 01:18:35.820]  did you see this fascinating article in the london sunday times from june 12 2011 about how
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:41.980]  the coast of a liberation army would murder serbians for the organs for the kidneys uh before
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:47.260]  killing them then there is another related case of this medicus is that the sunday times magazine
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:53.900]  because it's not the 12th yet uh ended up last year june 12 2011 london sunday times now what was
[01:18:53.900 --> 01:19:00.220]  the headline i mean i do know that al qaeda does murder people in serbia for their organs but you
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:05.340]  don't see the neocons talking about that because you know that's part of a real pentagon op just
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:10.780]  like just like they're killing libyans for their organs mainly black ones and that's a sacrament to
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:16.940]  hillary clinton uh but i mean i was aware of it i don't remember the exact article but tell me about
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:21.980]  it yeah the headline is coastal was bitter harvest to the coastal liberation army murder
[01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:27.100]  star prisoners for their organs at this remote farmhouse in 1999 and in this article they talk
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:34.460]  about how uh these this case with thick marty that's 593 serbians civilians were kidnapped right
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:38.860]  underneath the american peacekeeping forces for their organs and that is another related case
[01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:43.580]  how hash and patchy would import tell us stay there yes i do remember the article now that you
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:46.860]  mentioned it we'll have it when we come back from break up on screen for prison planet
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:52.380]  dot tv viewers for radio listeners i'll give out the full headline but uh yes uh that is admitted
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:59.740]  and that's all part of the goodies again al qaeda is the sword of the new world order it's a skeleton
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:05.340]  key that opens every door i had tried everything i'd cut back the amount of food i was eating i

[01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:16.060]  yeah i found the article from june 12 2011 ed Caesar so just about a year ago
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:21.820]  and i had seen similar reports uh both people agreeing to have their organs sold but others
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:28.780]  being kidnapped and having them taken and it was a lengthy uh report in the sunday
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:33.900]  times and we're finishing up with john and brooklyn then going to scott and others then
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:37.820]  i'm going to come back and do a bunch of news in the next segment get into a video the UN
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:42.860]  is promoting for transhumanism that's pretty unbelievable but it's actually standard operating
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:50.700]  procedure for these people that is all coming up also more on the commerce secretary reportedly
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:56.780]  hitting one car twice and another car later probably on prozac or something they're all
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:25:03.980]  out of their minds or drunk we'll also get into what's happening with fast and furious with that
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:12.380]  criminal mafia and the republicans actually flirting with bringing them to justice but
[01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:21.500]  going back to uh john john that's why i point out that this is all just theater we don't
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:27.020]  even have a government anymore we're we're run by special interests who are lawless and yes they
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:35.740]  allow al qaeda to operate all over kosovo and albania and to engage in horrors uh you know out
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:42.460]  of a science fiction movie and then none of it jives with reality when we're told that we've
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:47.580]  got to give up our way of life because of the threat of al qaeda finish your comments yeah yeah
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:53.340]  and also another thing i wanted to ask you is the follow-up question on what i when i called them
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:59.500]  last time on january 2nd now that unfortunately paschic Buchanan has been fired from msnbc and
[01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:05.020]  he's not running for president our congress uh what's what is stopping him exactly from the
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:12.860]  speaking at uh inexpensive nine of i've intrude i'm i don't know pat Buchanan very well i'll
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:16.460]  probably interview him 10 times over the years we could try to get him back on but he's kind of
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:22.940]  semi-retired um so i don't know that the answer to that question i appreciate the the points
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:30.620]  let's go ahead and talk to scott and my eyesight must be going out i can't read where it says he's
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:37.180]  from scott where are you where are you calling in from i'm calling from florida alec hey buddy
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:44.220]  what's on your mind oh well you know i can't what's on my mind is i feel pretty betrayed by the uh
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:49.820]  by the whole paul situation here i'm sure as many other people do hey it's just politics you got a
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:55.820]  fool people i mean i mean they put a press release out i mean come on you got to get the republicans
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:27:02.460]  to like them so why didn't he do endorse torture then i mean you know well you know the i think
[01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:08.380]  that the uh both the democratic and the republican party they they can't be co they can't be co-opted
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:14.460]  or taken over you know what we got to take the positive out of what what came out of all this
[01:27:14.460 --> 01:27:22.140]  here alec and so many americans came together and supported ron paul here and they they uh took over
[01:27:22.140 --> 01:27:27.100]  look at all the conventions that they took over in all the states and that is such that is such a
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:32.860]  good and powerful thing and absolutely people know about the federal reserve they know about
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:40.540]  crony capitalism they know about monopoly systems that's why it's so sad at the end of it it's like
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:46.700]  ron paul and ron paul and the liberty movement shed out this huge buffet of fine food and now
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:51.740]  ron paul has come in and basically pooped in the punch bowl in front of everybody i'm sorry
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:58.540]  use that analogy i i i agree i agree with you i agree with you however all these people that got
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:03.980]  together and all these organizations you know and you know maybe we should start instead of uh
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:09.580]  instead of trying to put somebody in as president or democrat or republican maybe we should start
[01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:15.020]  another party uh of some type but that's what campaign for liberty was supposed to do was
[01:28:15.020 --> 01:28:21.100]  take over the republican party and they've done some good but mainly it's endorsing neocons
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:27.260]  or the lesser of two evils where dohurst is pure you know garbage and you've got the cruise guy who's
[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:35.980]  cfr and wants property taxes and i'm like what what what you know you again they're trying to win
[01:28:35.980 --> 01:28:42.620]  up front but win with establishment people which is no win at all you've got to be clearly different
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:48.220]  from the system so there's a clear alternative as the system goes belly up do you see what i'm saying
[01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:54.460]  i absolutely i absolutely see what you're saying absolutely what i'm what the point i'm trying to
[01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:59.100]  make is that we should just we should try our government was never meant or designed to be
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:05.580]  run by professional politicians and that is how tyranny begins and what what this this organization
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:11.740]  i mean they took over all these all these conventions of louisiana and here and there and
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:17.340]  maybe these people should keep their organizations together get a good candidate to run and start
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:22.940]  running against these people in congress and start eating congress with people that believe in liberty
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:29.180]  and perhaps you and other radio talk show hosts can help these people out and get the word out for

[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:43.020]  corrupt to the bone and if we try and put another republican in there the bankers and everybody will

[01:33:36.220 --> 01:33:42.780]  got to get to this transhumanist video that erin dykes wrote about last night at info wars dot com
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:48.300]  united nations envisions transhumanist future for where man is obsolete i'm gonna do a special
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:54.860]  report later in the week just on this topic but i want to cover some of it here in just a moment
[01:33:54.860 --> 01:34:00.620]  first off here's some of the headlines this breaking at info wars dot com the media didn't cover it
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:07.500]  uh back it was like one article in the minneapolis uh saint paul newspaper when ventura filed suit in
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:14.700]  february it's now gone to court in the preliminary hearing and so the suit is going forward jesse
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:21.740]  ventura gets backing of former seals in lawsuit over punch hoax did not happen that shows how
[01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:28.700]  dirty news corps is who published the hoax book well that section we know is a hoax so that article
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:35.500]  is up there maroc says hezbollah will get syrian chemical weapons now this is a day after we broke
[01:34:35.500 --> 01:34:40.460]  the fact that it's being reported al qaeda is to be given chemical weapons to be blamed on syria
[01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:45.980]  and now sure enough that's being reported uh is ron paul finished on the national stage
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:52.700]  john rapaport article at info wars dot com also ranz romney endorsement focused around 2016
[01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:59.420]  presidential run ron paul campaign responds to controversy gattaca becomes reality as scientists
[01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:08.300]  screen abort human babies based on 3500 genetic faults i'm tempted because of all the callers
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:13.420]  and news i need to cover to cover that and integrated in with the transhumanist news
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:18.460]  because this is the big enchilada this is what the global leader into this is why i'm almost embarrassed
[01:35:18.460 --> 01:35:23.660]  i'm even covering rand paul okay our hopes and dreams are to get america back politically from
[01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:30.300]  the globalist but it's going to have to be an individual by individual awakening
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:40.060]  we face such a tapestry of lies such a full spectrum of false garbage that we've got to
[01:35:40.060 --> 01:35:45.340]  resuscitate the general public out of their mind numb trance i mean this is the zombification of
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:52.540]  society and and things are so much crazier in reality than what the television projects and what
[01:35:54.940 --> 01:35:57.900]  you know the average person believes is really happening
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:04.620]  and i try to wrap my mind around that all the time how do i articulate that the government
[01:36:04.620 --> 01:36:10.140]  openly grows the opium and cocaine and chips and on record uh that they're openly putting
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:15.260]  poisons in the food and water and our whole systems manipulated we're living in like a science fiction
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:22.300]  movie um they're already moving with bioethicists to force genetic testing of parents and then ban
[01:36:22.300 --> 01:36:27.900]  people having children under socialist health care uh the white house admits they want to ban
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:32.540]  all semi-autos if obama gets reelected and you're like well then vote for mitt romney that he'll
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:37.980]  probably try it too he's been for a total assault weapons ban i mean it's just so crazy that the
[01:36:37.980 --> 01:36:46.060]  tyranny's gotten this nuts i mean look at this cnet news story cnet news is cbs un could tax
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:51.580]  us base websites leak document show and the un admits yes the treaties and agreements that
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:57.260]  congress is trying to sign us on to gives the un control that they're trying to get law the c
[01:36:57.260 --> 01:37:02.780]  treaty through executive order to let the un run the oceans and tax them and the rivers uh
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:09.020]  they're they're giving $2,500 fines for the wrong trash and the wrong garbage can uh with inspectors
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:15.500]  diggings or people's trash i mean it's like a nightmare tyranny and it's just getting started
[01:37:17.660 --> 01:37:22.300]  here's another one labor department backs off plan to force reporters to use government-issued
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:29.740]  computers bloomberg i mean i saw that headline yesterday and couldn't believe it
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:37.340]  attorney general names prosecutors to probe leaks and they're investigating leaks the
[01:37:37.340 --> 01:37:43.660]  white house put out bragging about stuxnet and trying to arrest anybody that leaks stuff including
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:51.340]  criminal activity in fact i meant to get to that clip yesterday from um cbs news from 10 years ago
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:58.780]  about the 2.3 trillion missing we may get to that today again we're deep into tyranny the congress
[01:37:58.780 --> 01:38:04.540]  insider trades which is illegal for them to do illegal but when they get caught they say well
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:17.100]  we say we're allowed to let's continue here um uh with this news
[01:38:19.100 --> 01:38:24.380]  all gov has done a report on more americans killed by bees and wasp you've heard that before we've
[01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:33.980]  given you those numbers or falling televisions than terrorist we've got all this news coming out
[01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:41.500]  about the implosion of europe by design and we told you first it would be greece and ireland and
[01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:48.460]  then spain and always hundreds and billions more loaned to the very banks that are imploding the
[01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:55.820]  country who then are the creditors they're the creditors because we back them too big to fail
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:03.020]  then they loan us our own money back to us and then give us sanctions that we've got to follow
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:08.940]  an austerity again it's just total false reality that the average person
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.460]  is living in listen to this report house moving
[01:39:14.460 --> 01:39:23.100]  to hold holder and contempt that is some good news but again they're trying to get
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:30.140]  him in trouble for contempt or for perjury not even so much for the admitted crimes they gave
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:35.580]  press conferences admitting fast and furious an operation gun runner just not the details that
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:39.980]  they were shipping them out of the country themselves not just letting gun shops sell them
[01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:46.780]  them so congress has press conferences we've played with eric holder with
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:55.260]  napolitano with all of them they know it's they've got them dead to rights but they
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:40:00.460]  can't go after them for the gun issue itself because bush was involved in it as well
[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:08.060]  and darryl is uh bainer all of them have said the just department is out of excuses bainer
[01:40:08.060 --> 01:40:13.420]  said the statement today either the just department turns over the information requested our congress
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:16.860]  will have no choice but to move forward with holding the attorney general and contempt for
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:21.420]  obstruction of an ongoing investigation yeah let's start impeaching all of them
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:26.940]  you know if the republican party came out and said we're abolishing the federal reserve we're
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:31.580]  going back to government issued currency we'll have a debate about gold back we're getting out of
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:36.140]  the un we're shutting down these bases we're doing all of this i'll get right behind them but don't
[01:40:36.140 --> 01:40:41.020]  hold your breath they're doing this now because the political season and because this happened to
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:47.420]  come out now they've got to at least act like they're covering it so hold their feet to the fire
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:56.700]  you know how rand paul could make up for trying to get us to go and get in bed with
[01:40:56.700 --> 01:41:06.220]  mitt romney politically he could come out and say impeach eric holder he could come out and
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:11.180]  he could say get us out of the un he could come out and say impeach obama over india i mean let's
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:16.860]  see some dramatic action with your bully pulpit not oh let's make the establishment republicans
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:25.980]  like us by joining with them again you have this bizarre story commerce secretary john bryson accused
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:31.420]  in hit-and-run crashes notice they say he was cited he wasn't arrested if you were i hit and run we
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:37.260]  go to jail he hits a car hits it again drives off hits another car later miles away and it's found
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:43.420]  passed out and there's no discussion of being on drugs no discussion of any of it it's just well
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:53.660]  he got a ticket and you know commerce secretaries are are classically some of the most corrupt
[01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:57.020]  i wonder if he'll go up an airplane like ron brown of he gets too embarrassing
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:05.420]  peter king says drones carry out policy of righteousness and goodness yes everyone knows
[01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:12.780]  that's what our political system stands for now righteousness and goodness the most obese the most
[01:42:12.780 --> 01:42:18.620]  sickly the most degenerate the decadent society nearing collapse the world has ever seen since
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:24.780]  the romans and its righteousness and goodness to have extrajudicial illegal killings done by robot
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:29.980]  cowardly attack fleets in our name worldwide while the criminal government kills whoever they want
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:35.900]  to the name of fighting al-qaeda while funding and running al-qaeda the military's killer drones
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:40.380]  have made america safer by decimating al-caida's chain of command the chairman of the house
[01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:47.820]  homeland security committee said sunday i mean what a joke what a joke when you're informed it's a
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:55.420]  total joke we told you this was coming army times three thousand soldiers to serve in africa next
[01:42:55.420 --> 01:43:02.700]  year that's just as advisors the invasion of africa has begun and you're gonna pay for it all but
[01:43:02.700 --> 01:43:09.980]  you're not going to get the booty from it that's just some of the news i mean it's just stack after
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:21.260]  stack after stack of news with what's happening here you know let's do this i i said i'd get to
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:26.300]  this transhumanist thing but i in the time i've gotten the cellar i can't do it justice i'm either
[01:43:26.300 --> 01:43:33.180]  going to play this tonight and you have commentary throughout it or i'm going to do a special report
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:38.620]  for the radio show and we'll be out in a few days because there's this incredible united nations
[01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:48.620]  meeting global future 2045 international congress held in russia and they say the end of humanity
[01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:54.220]  the merger with machines how it's going to empower us it's the new spiritual revolution see the they
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:58.860]  attack and integrate the old religion but then bring out their new transhuman religion and they
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:05.980]  sell it as if total empowerment yes technology could greatly empower humanity but instead it's
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:10.940]  lowering the vocabulary people aren't communicating it's dumbing people down basic mathematics is
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:16.220]  disappearing language is falling apart and people are already addicted it's changing brain waves
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:22.940]  lowering cognitive ability in every study can connected to Alzheimer's and now the virtual
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:31.740]  realities are our television wrecked our society now the new computer virtual reality is is fully
[01:44:31.740 --> 01:44:36.780]  absorbing it and they sell it all as if it's going to be the most beautiful thing and this
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:41.580]  volholic heavenly experience and meanwhile the people at the conference i looked them up or all
[01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:46.700]  the globalists who are back during all the technology to fully enslave populations
[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:54.700]  and that report with the video is united nations envisions transhumanist future where man is obsolete
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:45:00.300]  and it's this utopian statement that that well don't complain about it because the evolution
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:04.380]  is here and that's the way it is we shouldn't even have a debate and it means the government will
[01:45:04.380 --> 01:45:08.860]  say how many kids you can have but it's it's wonderful because it's technology the soviets
[01:45:08.860 --> 01:45:13.900]  had all this talk about spaceships in super cities you know we we see that with the zeitgeist movement
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:21.180]  we see that with you know all of these different pushes that they're going to deliver you some
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:27.020]  type of heaven if you'll just acquiesce to their vision of the future and what it is is a bunch of
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:33.180]  people in pods with their brains hooked in to the pleasure centers who are happy to be turned off
[01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:39.740]  i mean this is just total technological takeover drones checkpoints nanotech and the food and
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:43.820]  water brain damaging us rewiring our brains that's just the beginning and they've already
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:48.620]  launched all this most people in autopsies just came out a month ago already have nanotech that's
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:54.700]  gone through the blood brain barrier the gmo hidden only top scientists can even find what
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:46:00.300]  they've designed into it their fertility plunging i mean we we are in them we are so deep into this
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:05.260]  already that that that it's a joke that i've even been talking about ram Paul i mean it doesn't even
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:13.020]  matter and ron paul's gotten more and more milk toast to me you hardly hear about the new world
[01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:17.900]  order anymore none of it it's just it's just a shame and that's fine i i wish we could reverse
[01:46:17.900 --> 01:46:22.140]  this because the globalists themselves are a bunch of nihilistic power tripping people
[01:46:22.140 --> 01:46:24.940]  in a power race to get these technologies for themselves
[01:46:27.420 --> 01:46:33.740]  and look at this report former pentagon analyst says china can shut down all the telecom gear
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:40.620]  it sold to the us and it goes into how all the new electronics have back doors built in it but if
[01:46:40.620 --> 01:46:45.820]  you knew the rest of the story you know as i mentioned earlier that under the different
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:53.900]  telecommunications acts 96 2000 2006 under all these agreements all of the tech agrees on standard
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:47:00.380]  that's why if you get a samsung droid or an apple iphone or a sony laptop or a
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:09.260]  digital television they all have tech to watch you to listen to you to remote erase your dvr
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:13.820]  to watch you to track you the government now admits this remember how crazy i was a decade
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:19.180]  ago telling you this it was in mit just like i told you they're taking your baby's blood at
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:24.300]  birth secretly for 40 years now it's all admitted they do what they want there's a whole scientific
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:29.660]  agenda by the technocrats they don't watch lady gaga they don't care about going to the big parties
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:35.740]  they don't care about being senators they don't they are engineers global technocratic engineers
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:41.900]  when you see a film like prometheus when i told you we had the script you notice my analysis
[01:47:41.900 --> 01:47:45.900]  was dead on it and have you now seen the movie that it's all about how the humanoids are really
[01:47:45.900 --> 01:47:53.420]  humans from the future that's going to be in the next uh uh installment this whole movie was just
[01:47:53.420 --> 01:48:00.620]  a build up to the next one oh yeah i know more than just just just just this this installment
[01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:06.620]  of prometheus and it's humanoid here i'll just spoil the whole thing for you uh those are spaces
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:12.460]  that look like the elephant man uh who've come from the future but we're also in our past
[01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:18.380]  an engineered humanity and are now engaged in a genetic rewrite the engineers are the new world
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:23.340]  order they believe they're going to attain the super science tech they believe they're going to
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:29.180]  have the life extension never die and and at this big un conference they say everything i laid out
[01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:39.420]  an end game and the media ran these strawmen things saying alex jones says the elite are
[01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:43.740]  going to merge with computers and fly around the galaxy you know i was quoting rake urswell i was
[01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:51.980]  quoting the un you know alex jones says the elite eat roasted babies in foil no i was pointing out
[01:48:51.980 --> 01:48:57.900]  the powdered pills of babies the roasted babies being shipped the the the the the baby collagen
[01:48:57.900 --> 01:49:03.980]  melted down into expensive cosmetics i was saying this is the type of trash at bilderberg
[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:09.420]  that engages in that and the media goes with i'm making up roasted babies in probably 15
[01:49:09.420 --> 01:49:14.380]  publications that's how they do it by the way i saw an associated press article about
[01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:23.340]  pritch charles vacationing in transylvania after diamond jubilee in fact that's somewhere in my
[01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:28.620]  stack and i couldn't find it guys you put that on screen i remember 15 years ago breaking down
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:33.740]  that they're not even german royalty that rules anyone they're really transylvanian i mean how
[01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:41.660]  weird is that the transylvanian royalty runs the known world and and and pushes this side that they
[01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:47.420]  have no power and that prince charles is obsessed with his transylvanian lineage and and hops around
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:53.980]  it old Dracula style castles well actually there are Dracula's castle is there hopping around in
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:59.260]  the transylvanian woods there it is prince charles on private visit the transylvania after the diamond
[01:49:59.260 --> 01:50:03.900]  jubilee they say he spends like half his time there creeping around the woods like now it's for
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:11.580]  rato i mean this is the level of weirdness we deal with truth is so much stranger than fiction

[01:54:09.980 --> 01:54:15.900]  all right let's go to your phone calls let's talk to adrian in michigan you're on the air
[01:54:15.900 --> 01:54:23.180]  thanks for holding welcome hello alex and you're right it's a shame that we are wasting our time
[01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:30.780]  speaking about ran paul uh if he continues it down this path at most it's just going to be
[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:43.660]  a failed uh establishment victory in two or at 2016 and what we need right now is a victory for
[01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:50.700]  liberty uh through honesty what we need is to identify that the country's been taken over by
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:56.460]  six private mega banks out of europe and is imploding the world to destroy the free market and
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:55:02.700]  on it build a monopoly insider system and if we don't identify these guys there's no way to turn
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:08.700]  it around because in every country they own the top two or three parties the system is fixed
[01:55:08.700 --> 01:55:17.980]  like a don king fight how do we get around that the only way is if we all go out there and
[01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:26.300]  individually inform everyone we know friends family uh through the cable access television
[01:55:26.300 --> 01:55:31.820]  and everything else and to try to work through the local levels absolutely the system wouldn't be
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:36.380]  trying to censor the web and bring in control they know as things get worse people are going to
[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:44.860]  listen more and more yes they will uh i suppose uh that'll be all except i'd also like to say
[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:51.340]  for uh jesse ventura thank you for continuing your fight and i salute you all right he's gonna
[01:55:51.340 --> 01:55:55.820]  be on tomorrow thank you for the call yeah i mean i disagree with ventura on a lot of issues
[01:55:55.820 --> 01:56:00.220]  unlike ron paul i agree with him on almost everything but with ventura he doesn't compromise
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:07.660]  i know him personally he is real he is real and if if he every once in a while starts to change
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:13.820]  his view he'll tell you why he certainly doesn't do it for political expediency and that's why the
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:21.100]  system came after him and ventura is not running for anything folks i mean maybe in 2016 but i doubt
[01:56:21.100 --> 01:56:27.500]  it he is sick of it all he wasn't going to sue this guy until his navy seal you know former bosses
[01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:31.740]  said we know it's a lie yeah you know people that own the bar everything they checked they found it's
[01:56:31.740 --> 01:56:35.660]  made up they said well you gotta sue this guy we can't have the seals doing this kind of stuff for
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:41.820]  money stabbing each other in the back uh let's talk to brian in michigan you're on the air go ahead
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:49.340]  well i have no doubt that rand paul was threatened but despite that i will never forgive him for
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:56.220]  endorsing met romney and i also disagree with jack hunter's analysis saying that he had to do it to
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:57:01.660]  become president in 2016 because there's two problems with that the first of all who's going
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:09.020]  to vote for him now in 2016 because he's lost any chance of me voting for him uh as well as rand paul
[01:57:09.020 --> 01:57:14.220]  and the second problem is who's to say that the republicans wouldn't play dirty tricks on him like
[01:57:14.220 --> 01:57:21.820]  they did to rand paul in 2012 um and i hate to see a wasted effort go by because i know people
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:28.460]  worked hard in the liberty campaign uh in the presidential run i would just think uh the
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:34.540]  rounds the round paul supporters and i know he's not perfect but he is similar at least and just
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:40.940]  to go uh with gary johnson uh this year anything else
[01:57:40.940 --> 01:57:51.020]  uh well that's all i have to say on rand paul um uh if there's uh i like to plug a book um
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:57.820]  if there's time just uh if uh a good fictional murder mystery that'll wake people up to the
[01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:04.220]  new ruled order is called swearing oath by kevin morse all right thank you so much uh for the
[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:09.980]  call kevin i'm joking i know your name is brian well you have been her joining us tomorrow it's

[02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:13.180]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:22.140]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:26.780 --> 02:00:32.300]  okay folks webster tarply coming up not only has he recently traveled to syria and can break down
[02:00:32.300 --> 02:00:37.500]  the admissions that al-qaeda is working for nato so i'm now in patriotic because i don't hail al-qaeda
[02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:44.860]  we are also going to be speaking with him first about rand paul ron paul i saw him about a week
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:49.420]  and a half ago and gotten a big argument with him about ron rand paul being sellouts to the new
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:55.820]  world order he didn't show any evidence of that but he did say you watch they're going to go more
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:01:01.340]  and more with the establishment and and that indeed did happen so we're going to get his take on all
[02:01:01.340 --> 02:01:09.420]  of that uh coming up in a moment also we got the bill berg documents from 66 where they were freaking
[02:01:09.420 --> 02:01:16.700]  out about degaul and centralized government economic nationalism that's the model that
[02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:22.140]  tarply believes in and he says degaul is the model of that and was telling me that and then i get
[02:01:22.140 --> 02:01:26.780]  these bill berg documents and that's all about how much they hate degaul in 66 and how they've
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:32.380]  got to get rid of him which they did do and i'm not endorsing degaul i don't know enough about
[02:01:32.380 --> 02:01:36.140]  him and i know a little bit i've read about him and read some of it but i can't like endorsing
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:42.140]  because i'm not a historian like tarply who's particularly looked into that area so we'll start
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:47.980]  out from that perspective and not just have a uh you know an heated angry debate because because
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:53.500]  i like tarply and i don't find it enjoyable uh to just sit there and you know hiss at each other
[02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:58.700]  because he believes in a state system he says he's a statist and all i see is nightmares from the
[02:01:58.700 --> 02:02:03.900]  state i get if you have a corporate fascist world government that's above the law that's bad too
[02:02:04.460 --> 02:02:09.900]  but it's not like either tarply's view or ron paul's view is the way to go you know i i'm just
[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:16.380]  trying to have the public engage in a debate about these issues uh so that's coming up uh marliss in
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:25.020]  washington is that washington state or washington dc washington state welcome hi thank you hey um
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:29.660]  just a few points here if i could make real quick i i didn't get involved in paul's campaign this year
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:35.180]  because i was involved in it very quite heavily in oh seven oh wait but it didn't take me very
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:40.620]  long to realize that his campaign was heavily infiltrated by the opposition and it was very
[02:02:40.620 --> 02:02:46.940]  very um disheartening to be did when you put so much energy into something to have um the
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:52.380]  rug basically pulled out from under you by people who who don't do really what they need to do to
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:57.340]  make things work um so it was really frustrating even though i went to the caucus this year and
[02:02:57.340 --> 02:03:03.180]  and supported him and actually went to the county as a delegate but um i wanted to put a little
[02:03:03.180 --> 02:03:10.380]  angle on this um him and what's going on lately if if a hit was ordered on paul and paul thought
[02:03:10.380 --> 02:03:15.340]  that if he was bumped out there would have been blood in the streets because of the fervor of his
[02:03:15.340 --> 02:03:22.460]  flock um perhaps it's possible that to prevent the bloodshed he he um went this route um big
[02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:27.340]  amount of peace i'm not i'm like making excuses for him but it just put another yeah but i mean
[02:03:27.340 --> 02:03:33.820]  even the response by campaign for liberty is hey we got to play politics get the republicans to
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:39.340]  like us well just endorse the wars the torture the banker bailouts then i mean just become
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:44.540]  mit romney then i mean why didn't ron paul do that if this is such a great thing and then i don't
[02:03:44.540 --> 02:03:52.540]  want to hear oh ron paul is ron paul ran paul is ran paul listen ron paul is involved in all the
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:59.420]  strategy of this they coordinated his announcement thursday ron paul's that oh we can't win now as
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:06.620]  if that wasn't already known with ran coming out and endorsing him and and and my whole point is
[02:04:06.620 --> 02:04:12.300]  going in that direction ron paul was good because he was fighting the wars fighting the banksters
[02:04:12.300 --> 02:04:17.900]  exposing corporate welfare that's something republicans don't understand and now they're
[02:04:17.900 --> 02:04:22.780]  starting to they're like well all corporations are good and all government's bad and i'm like wait a
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:28.700]  minute corporations that hire people are good and that are constitutional but if you're a
[02:04:28.700 --> 02:04:34.140]  multinational corporation that writes the laws to be exempt from the laws you put on your competition
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:39.020]  and your main business model is banker bailouts and government contracts you're the enemy
[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:45.500]  yeah all these defense contractor people are like oh you know we need a bigger defense budget
[02:04:45.500 --> 02:04:52.700]  it's not even our military it's there to enforce these banksters operations and ron paul talked
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:58.060]  about that and that's the antithesis of bill dirberg group but endorsing mit romney that is
[02:04:58.060 --> 02:05:03.180]  the bill dirberg group we'll be back with webster tarbley hi this is alex jones did you know that

[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:51.340]  economist will be joining us he is the author of george h w bush the unauthorized biography
[02:08:52.220 --> 02:09:00.780]  he also wrote the unauthorized biography of barack obama and he is a 911 truth scholar
[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:09.020]  an activist a ab princeton 1966 summa cum laude by beta kappa fulbright scholar university of
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:14.780]  turin idly ma in humanities from skidmore college and phd in history from the catholic
[02:09:14.780 --> 02:09:19.260]  university of america he is fluent in italian german french latin and russian which is always
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:22.460]  interesting when you're at events with him because he's conversing in different languages people
[02:09:22.460 --> 02:09:27.500]  tarpley is a true character and i like him in fact he's one of the our favorite people here
[02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:33.260]  around the office he's also very funny in private and we'll try to get him to do uh some uh
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:40.380]  some some some fun things at the end i i said will you do the ron paul imitation later and he
[02:09:40.380 --> 02:09:47.420]  said if you behave yourself and so like a train seal i am here waiting for my treat at the end uh
[02:09:49.100 --> 02:09:55.420]  so tarpley is here with us now listen this is what happened just to preface this it's like
[02:09:55.420 --> 02:10:00.860]  10 30 at night or later i get there to interview jim tucker friday night in the middle of bilderberg
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:07.900]  i've been screaming all day i have no voice i'm totally exhausted and there's jim tucker and
[02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:12.140]  they're interviewed jim tucker and tarpley's mad at what's being said is interjecting so we start
[02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:19.020]  arguing with each other by the time i get to him you know we dispense with the plays pleasantries and
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:24.060]  like two game cocks start slicing each other up because he's saying your buddy ron paul is going
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:29.180]  to sell you out yes the bilderberg likes him and i'm like come on tarpley i can understand that
[02:10:29.180 --> 02:10:33.820]  you believe the state can organize things and empower people ron paul believes the opposite
[02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:40.940]  but your analysis about the corrupt oligarchs we've got is spot on and his instincts about
[02:10:40.940 --> 02:10:45.500]  what obama would do he's a key part of the obama deception his his instincts are are very very
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:50.780]  accurate when it comes to politics i i i just don't i'm not as big a romanicist as he is
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:55.660]  you know we debate monetary policy should it be a government fiat currency uh like lincoln had or
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:59.660]  should it be a gold currency just because i entertain both doesn't mean i'm flip-flopping
[02:10:59.660 --> 02:11:06.060]  we're having a debate we're but but but overall monetary education cultural education being
[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:13.340]  involved knowing how systems work that's the answer now he starts going off into a rant about uh
[02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:20.300]  degal and how you know you know uh that's the type of system he likes and as i'm trying to get him to
[02:11:20.300 --> 02:11:25.100]  quantify it and later if he does that i get secret bilderberg group documents leaked to us and part
[02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:30.460]  of the 300 pages that erin's uh now now published info wars dot com is all about them obsessed with
[02:11:30.460 --> 02:11:37.580]  degal in 66 meeting in vise boden germany and how if his nationalism spreads it'll kill their
[02:11:37.580 --> 02:11:43.740]  command and control i get the philosopher king if you're going to have a quasi socialism if you
[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:48.460]  have somebody like degal who does it to actually empower people and build infrastructure those
[02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:55.100]  infrastructures like coral reefs can can supply an ecosystem my issue is it always goes downhill
[02:11:55.100 --> 02:12:00.300]  and gets taken over and becomes horribly corrupt and out of control so tarply wants to address first
[02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:04.060]  because i asked him the other day on the phone i said are you a communist it was like the unamerican
[02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:09.420]  affairs committee meeting i said listen i get what you're saying i don't disagree with your
[02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:13.660]  analysis of the problems but are you a communist because you know my experience look liberals
[02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:17.420]  that say governments get empower people they want my guns they want my private property
[02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:22.060]  he says no that's not the system and he says i i want to explain to your audience this degal
[02:12:22.060 --> 02:12:28.700]  model so he'll tell us about that briefly uh tell us describe who he is and then tell us why
[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:32.620]  because you notice i haven't had tarply on the last four or five months because it was just like
[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:37.100]  endless ron paul ranting when i knew ron paul was out of the race by then anyways
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:42.300]  and the ron paul supporters are like hey just say get involved with the delegates and i said okay i
[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:47.020]  guess to try to influence the platform but this is going nowhere and people got mad at me from that
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:52.380]  side tarply got mad that i wasn't saying you know that paul was il diablo and i'm just like look
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:59.580]  they're most the the manufactured food the the uh something the right word for it the
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:05.180]  processed food has nano tech in it now it's being found in our brains you know gmo is killing us
[02:13:05.180 --> 02:13:09.180]  vaccines are deadly by the way tarply thinks all that's great too so that's why i think
[02:13:09.180 --> 02:13:15.260]  in his world view there's a few blocks missing uh of course with me too anybody who's smart you know
[02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:23.500]  got their uh their things about them that are uh you know quirky or whatever and i'm not trying to
[02:13:23.500 --> 02:13:27.900]  be mean to tarply and i will ask you those questions later i also want to get into Syria
[02:13:27.900 --> 02:13:33.420]  where you've traveled to but there's my preface to this tarply who are you have you or have you
[02:13:33.420 --> 02:13:39.020]  ever been a member of the communist party no and let me let me point out right at the beginning
[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:45.740]  this this thing about marxism leninism this is a complete red herring i represent the american
[02:13:45.740 --> 02:13:52.620]  system of political economy notice it's called the american system not the austrian system and it's
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:58.220]  not even the digaul system it is the characteristic economic school of the united states it starts
[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:04.940]  with governor winthrop in massachusetts bay it goes to benjamin franklin who founded the post office
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:11.660]  that we have to fight to save today it continues with alexander hamilton who created the federal
[02:14:11.660 --> 02:14:17.500]  government and allowed this country to live when it was on a british death watch in the beginning of
[02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:24.220]  the uh of the of the 19th century goes on to henry clay henry clay coined the term the american
[02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:31.740]  system and this was a protective tariff a national bank and infrastructure paid for by the federal
[02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:37.980]  government even if it's only in one state yes yes now now now i agree with that there's more
[02:14:37.980 --> 02:14:42.380]  lincoln right this is lincoln and the people around lincoln we shouldn't forget freedrich list
[02:14:42.380 --> 02:14:48.700]  the greatest critic of british free trade the guy who said free trade and free market is the way
[02:14:48.700 --> 02:14:53.900]  the british dominate the world so if you're going to build an economy you've got to have a full set
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:59.660]  economy and whether you're germany or the united states or whoever you are you've got to use protectionism
[02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:06.140]  to keep the british out and that was the republican party doctrine henry carrey another important guy
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:11.420]  you go to the warton school at the university of pennsylvania that was founded it's in a charter
[02:15:11.420 --> 02:15:18.780]  to teach the american system of henry carrey and instead you go there and these uh lobotomized
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:23.980]  professors today don't even know who he was then it goes underground and this is the part where we
[02:15:23.980 --> 02:15:31.900]  can see for ourselves when the gold standard was restored the crime of 1873 the deed done in the
[02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:37.420]  dead of night the specie resumption act that is where the populace come in because these were farmers
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:42.540]  right these are western farmers and miners too and what they find is that the their debts because
[02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:48.220]  of the gold standard the debt they have gets to be crushing because they they borrowed paper dollars
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:52.940]  and they're going to pay back gold dollars that's one side and the other side is the prices they're
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:58.860]  getting for their goods go down down down so that is the populist movement i urge people take a look
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:16:05.580]  at the populist platform of omaha in 1890 those are the roots of the new deal many of the concepts
[02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:12.460]  such as parity price for farmers come from the populist and are then taken up in the new deal
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:16.700]  and then by the time we get to this century it's quite obvious it's franklin d roosevelt
[02:16:16.700 --> 02:16:23.340]  the new deal the first time in human history that the middle class has become the numerical majority
[02:16:23.340 --> 02:16:29.580]  of the entire society and this is the society the new deal state the new deal society that fought
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:37.020]  off communism fascism and nazism put a person on the moon and and unlock the secrets of the
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:43.100]  atom it is the most most effective form of human organization yet devised kennedy tried to revive
[02:16:43.100 --> 02:16:48.300]  it with the new frontier he was assassinated by wall street finance oligarchs working through the
[02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:54.700]  cia operations director we also should mention lbj right johnson in his domestic program especially
[02:16:54.700 --> 02:17:01.660]  medicare and civil rights this is also a continuation unfortunately he fell for the vietnam warline and
[02:17:01.660 --> 02:17:07.260]  that is what destroyed him since the coming of nixon right and we just had we just had the 40th
[02:17:07.260 --> 02:17:14.300]  anniversary of watergate this past weekend since the coming of nixon the american system as we had it
[02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:19.660]  has been dismantled and this is what people have to understand this austrian litany of deregulation
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:24.620]  privatization union busting the race to the bottom the destruction of the social safety net
[02:17:24.620 --> 02:17:31.260]  that is what has lowered the american standard of living by two-thirds over the past 40 years or so
[02:17:31.260 --> 02:17:39.340]  so this is what i stand for it is the american system it's not foreign austrianism but by contrast
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:45.820]  right this this uh libertarian austrian doctrine of funmesis and funhagic you'd have to say what
[02:17:45.820 --> 02:17:50.540]  is that where does that come from well doesn't really even come from austria i guess that would be
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:56.860]  bad enough but it comes from the london school of economics that is where funmesis and funhagic got
[02:17:56.860 --> 02:18:02.780]  their their leap into international prominence and above all what people need to know is that
[02:18:02.780 --> 02:18:08.940]  austrianism and libertarianism that is a synthetic doctrine designed to brainwash people to get them
[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:12.860]  to the point where they cannot see their own interests and they're eager to cut their own
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:17.020]  throats all right let's stop right there because i'm gonna hold on a web sir i have to announce to
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:21.340]  the network we're going to skip this break coming up here in about a minute and a half so you can
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:26.140]  finish you can get into your indictment i want to get your perspective on this but i want to go back
[02:18:26.140 --> 02:18:32.380]  why do i see out of the new deal types wanting to restrict my second amendment wanting to raise
[02:18:32.380 --> 02:18:38.620]  taxes on the middle class and that money always getting siphoned off to the crony capitalist
[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:45.580]  monopoly man why do i see the big tax-free foundations ford carnegie lobbying i understand
[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:50.060]  for both sides that they are trying to control the libertarian movement so they can grow a big
[02:18:50.060 --> 02:18:54.860]  government and then absolve themselves from taxes and take control of the wreckage but i think it's
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:59.980]  more sophisticated than just saying oh my gosh we need to go with this new deal system all i see
[02:18:59.980 --> 02:19:06.540]  that the the inheritance of the new deal doing is coming after my second amendment and my family
[02:19:06.540 --> 02:19:12.140]  and trying to make me dependent i think that's that's too much of a low-level view and i i don't
[02:19:12.140 --> 02:19:17.500]  see how you can blame the new deal for things that have happened since about no no but i'm saying
[02:19:17.500 --> 02:19:22.940]  what came out of it i mean well you know the the the great society all of this yeah what came out of
[02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:29.180]  it was first of all that the united states did not succumb to nazism and fascism remember that
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:35.740]  roosevelt was the leading anti-fascist of the world it was the only person who consistently
[02:19:35.740 --> 02:19:40.140]  opposed fascism okay well i want you to get into that but but let's go back to your point about
[02:19:40.140 --> 02:19:45.420]  the libertarians being synthetic yeah look if you look you we look at peter thiel right peter
[02:19:45.420 --> 02:19:52.140]  thiel of the bilderberg steering committee gives 2.7 million dollars to the ron paul campaign
[02:19:52.140 --> 02:19:58.220]  what does this mean it means precisely that libertarianism and austrianism is a third synthetic
[02:19:58.220 --> 02:20:03.420]  ideology designed to get people to cut their own throats we can also go back david rockefeller
[02:20:03.420 --> 02:20:08.620]  this was the funny thing about that scene at the at the bilderberg david rockefeller was was of course
[02:20:08.620 --> 02:20:14.140]  not there he guess he's too sick but the the patron historically of the bilderberg group is
[02:20:14.140 --> 02:20:17.900]  david rockefeller some good news that he's getting ready to die that's what he pays a lot of the
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:23.020]  bills yeah but now you're gonna get feel and feel is actually worse so david rockefeller is
[02:20:23.020 --> 02:20:28.700]  is paying for what's going on inside but outside there are people who say i'm i'm a libertarian
[02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:36.220]  i'm an austrian i'm for ron paul that doctrine is also subsidized paid for by david rockefeller
[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:43.020]  he paid von hayek von hayek had to spoon feed him economics when david rockefeller was studying
[02:20:43.020 --> 02:20:49.420]  at the london school of economics and he paid von mesis that the the most dangerous secret
[02:20:49.420 --> 02:20:57.100]  organization for your listeners is not bilderberg not trilateral not skull and bones it's the mount
[02:20:57.100 --> 02:21:05.020]  pellerin society the mount pellerin society founded in switzerland in 1947 with milton freedman
[02:21:05.020 --> 02:21:11.820]  von hayek i think was there right wing cia with william buckley european feudal nobility in other
[02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:18.620]  words the ideological basis the theoretical basis of bilderberg and and the things that come later
[02:21:18.620 --> 02:21:25.420]  is already laid in 1947 the volcker fund gets involved there are books about this right how
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:31.740]  reactionary and fascist businessmen supported this stuff they funded it and well sure let's go back
[02:21:31.740 --> 02:21:36.380]  i mean you've got the rockefeller's funding hitler from the beginning all that's on record
[02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:40.860]  and declassified but let's go back because we have that private discussion because you could
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:47.420]  see it's on record the very same robber barons funded marx engels the whole deal explain how
[02:21:47.420 --> 02:21:53.420]  marxism is synthetic as well and what's the synthesis between the the libertarianism they
[02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:59.420]  want to control and you could argue began uh and and the communism what is because that's what the
[02:21:59.420 --> 02:22:04.380]  carnage document show is they do say there's a synthesis what is it well we want to break out of
[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:09.420]  it but let's get to go back i think i'm the foremost critic of marx right my thesis is that marx
[02:22:09.420 --> 02:22:17.420]  was a british agent and you can see this and stuff that i published uh in 1994 1995 marx operated out
[02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:22.540]  of uh great britain right everybody knows that he studied at the reading room of the british museum
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:29.740]  right today the british library his patron was a guy called david urquhart david urquhart had
[02:22:29.740 --> 02:22:36.380]  been the british ambassador to uh the ottoman empire right to turkey to to constantan opal
[02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:42.860]  and this guy urquhart had a newspaper and marx earned his money not so much from the new york
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:49.820]  era old tribune but from this newspaper of david urquhart urquhart is the guy who told marx the
[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:57.180]  plan for das kapital right capital the the the main work of uh of marx urquhart was interested
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:23:02.780]  in dialectics urquhart had classes for working people and this the funny thing about it is that
[02:23:02.780 --> 02:23:09.020]  urquhart was a tremendous hater of russia and people may not remember this but even in the 50s
[02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:16.620]  and 60s it was an embarrassment to the soviets to have marx as their guru but at the same time
[02:23:16.620 --> 02:23:22.620]  when you look at what marx actually writes it's always attacking russia well well exactly and
[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:29.020]  they sent that that that biological political weapon in 1917 it's not your thesis anthony
[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:33.180]  sutton got the documents there were congressional hearings on it mccarthy discovered it and then
[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:40.300]  was destroyed that that the entire time the department of war everything sent hundreds of
[02:23:40.300 --> 02:23:46.940]  millions of dollars you know the one train of gold with 50 million with linen on board and to overthrow
[02:23:46.940 --> 02:23:52.380]  the czars uh because they knew there was already a revolution going on in russia i mean communism
[02:23:52.380 --> 02:23:58.300]  was sent from england and the united states by the robber barons yes uh although let me just say
[02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:06.140]  marx was acting as a typical british agent in the 19th century when the main enemies of great britain
[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:11.500]  were russia and the united states and indeed during the american civil war there's a convergence
[02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:18.380]  between lincoln and the czar as the good guys in my view when the russian fleet arrived in new york
[02:24:18.380 --> 02:24:24.460]  the russian fleet arrived in san francisco and the british new in 1863 if you attack the united
[02:24:24.460 --> 02:24:31.020]  states you get a world war with the united states russia probably prussia against britain france
[02:24:31.020 --> 02:24:34.700]  and spain by the way people forget this and then they say alex you're from the south what do you
[02:24:34.700 --> 02:24:41.100]  mean you say the north's good no no no on record they this is they sent british intelligence in
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:45.740]  to foment the south who had real grievances to try to break the country up i mean this is what they
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:53.180]  do right freemasonic agitators very relevant point but now when we look at lennon lennon is
[02:24:53.180 --> 02:24:59.020]  someone who was sent in by the british and by the us to create chaos the the trick was now
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:04.540]  uh lennon turns into the frankenstein principle in other words they say let's promote the breakup
[02:25:04.540 --> 02:25:11.180]  of this forest empire and and feast on the on the remains and then lennon being this fanatic
[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:17.660]  that he was was able to to pull a coup and and carry out a uh well to create this dictatorship
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:23.100]  which then turned into something different but no matter how much it evolved under stalin it was
[02:25:23.100 --> 02:25:29.820]  always crippled by marxist doctrine and the crippling was that they didn't have small and medium
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:35.420]  industry they didn't have individual initiative right they didn't have entrepreneurship and then
[02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:41.900]  the cia and 49 now declassified i'd always read this and seen this thing now admit the last five
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:48.220]  years put malice tongue into power who destroyed all small and medium collectivized and killed
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:53.100]  60 plus mill well this that of course is the british policy right the british had always hated
[02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:57.980]  chan kai shek and the chinese nationalists but what what was going on there this was actually
[02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:03.500]  done by general marshall and this it gets back to my thesis about pearl harbour you have this group
[02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:12.700]  of stimson bundy love it and mcloy these are the top uh leaders of the u.s banking establishment
[02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:18.140]  that enter they enter the roosevelt administration as part of a national unity government to wage
[02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:24.460]  world war two they sabotage roosevelt they make pearl harbour a reality and then they send general
[02:26:24.460 --> 02:26:30.620]  marshall who's a willing tool to china and what does he do he cuts off all military aid to chan
[02:26:30.620 --> 02:26:37.660]  kai shek for a year and a half so that mal will win yes indeed mal was put there because mal was
[02:26:37.660 --> 02:26:46.700]  programmed with british ideology bentham and darwin and things like this and he uh then he kept china
[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:52.460]  in the state of backwardness once mal was dumped in the in the 70s you get the immediate economic
[02:26:52.460 --> 02:26:59.020]  development of china the economic development of china is also a monument to the american system
[02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:05.340]  again no no exactly but but uh expanding on that just backing up what you're saying uh
[02:27:06.060 --> 02:27:13.020]  that's why leading up to this the british had gone in using opium on record hundreds of years
[02:27:13.020 --> 02:27:19.820]  previous to take over china i mean this really is a global system of sabotage but it's not a
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:25.180]  thesis this is all this is all on record uh tarpley so sure and just on the opium what you just
[02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:30.300]  mentioned the opium was run by the british east india company and they had a school of
[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:35.180]  economists associated with them david ricardo the founder of so-called british classical
[02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:39.500]  economics was the boss of the british east india company in other words he was the british
[02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:45.820]  the biggest dope pusher in the world james mill john stuart mill and other british economists of
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:52.060]  the time generally funded by the british east india company malphos malphos is of course the
[02:27:52.060 --> 02:27:57.980]  the ancestor of canes british east india company cadres school and let's expand british east india
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:28:04.060]  company 1832 after they've been kicked out of the us and the nationalists have defeated them
[02:28:04.060 --> 02:28:10.700]  they sent a giant scout ship or mother ship that was skull and bones funded off of opium money on
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:15.900]  record right and these are the these are the families that go into the the the boston and new
[02:28:15.900 --> 02:28:22.300]  york uh banking establishment but here ricardo originated the quantity theory of money the modern
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:27.420]  representatives of the quantity theory of money are from hayek from mesas and libertarianism and
[02:28:27.420 --> 02:28:33.340]  this obsession i heard yesterday you were you were having to fight off people wanting to talk about
[02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:39.340]  narcotics right and how great narcotics work this is you can see this as a kind of original sin
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:44.780]  of this school of economics right the austrians and the libertarians which is that they just
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:49.740]  like george soros are obsessed with making narcotics available everywhere as if the
[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:57.260]  american people weren't and what do they say what do they say what do they say me gold and me gold
[02:28:57.260 --> 02:29:04.220]  me that's the the leprechaun and uh the the leprechaun especially the leprechaun i think leprechaun
[02:29:04.220 --> 02:29:12.220]  five lep in the hood out to do no good that's ron paul narcotics and gold take a look it's an
[02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:17.020]  interesting power yeah but give it with a full power time all right i'll you let me talk a little
[02:29:17.020 --> 02:29:22.940]  bit now let me just make my my action point we now have a situation where lots of people in this
[02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:28.540]  country were betrayed last week by the two-party system the republicans and the democrats how did
[02:29:28.540 --> 02:29:33.420]  they both betray you one side is wisconsin the other side is one stay there break it down the

[02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:16.460]  well that was some fascinating history that webster tar play was just giving you and i've
[02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:21.900]  researched it all myself and everything he's saying is exactly as it transpired from every
[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:27.900]  perspective he's just able to encyclopedically go into all the names all the history i mean so
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:31.580]  much of it that i've read and studied over the years and then forgotten and then he's bringing
[02:33:31.580 --> 02:33:38.700]  it up here this is the truth the mega ultra rich created communism as a counter revolution so that
[02:33:38.700 --> 02:33:47.900]  when people ran from their robber baronism uh which was not free market as they call it you know
[02:33:47.900 --> 02:33:53.340]  totally centralized monopolism uh john d rockefeller said competition is a sin they would run into
[02:33:53.340 --> 02:33:58.780]  communism which was again controlled by them and i wanted to get into de gall and why they hated him
[02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:04.380]  so much but also you know talk about ron ran paul what he said to me a week and a half ago that i
[02:34:04.380 --> 02:34:08.860]  that i disagreed with and it doesn't mean i totally all this has been proven invented out but his
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:13.740]  instinct was proven accurate and then where he sees this country going with some of his ideas for
[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:18.060]  solutions and again doesn't mean i endorse it all we're just having a discussion about it we're
[02:34:18.060 --> 02:34:23.340]  going back to tar play here in just one moment i want to just remind listeners that we are listeners

[02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:27.980]  nato admits they've got foreign troops training to take on american citizens i mean this treason
[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:33.660]  is out in the open as we're prepared for foreign occupation uh obama the headlines up at dredger
[02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:40.300]  port dot com it's also info wars dot com more drones than obama knows what to do with i mean it's
[02:36:40.300 --> 02:36:46.700]  you know 10 000 of the air force 5000 of the army 5000 for homeland security predators watching the
[02:36:46.700 --> 02:36:53.740]  amish watching people with their cows google working for the nsa got bought cars driving around
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:37:00.380]  stealing your passcodes downloading everything there is just a lawless rush of tyranny so fast now i
[02:37:00.380 --> 02:37:05.980]  can't even interpret it uh fast enough and and and and tarply i want to get your take on why
[02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:11.420]  we're seeing the mad rush right now world being imploded by design you're saying it's out of control
[02:37:11.420 --> 02:37:15.660]  but i read documents where they admitted they were doing this a decade ago a lot of points i'm making
[02:37:15.660 --> 02:37:21.100]  here but finish your point about uh what you said to me we can have to go about the polls
[02:37:21.100 --> 02:37:26.620]  the democrats the republicans as you say betraying people the synthesis of that and then i want to
[02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:32.060]  get briefly into the call and then talk about where the world is right now politically what we're on
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:42.700]  the precipice of all right um first uh i would say rather than dwell on on the polls um i think
[02:37:42.700 --> 02:37:47.820]  what people have to do is search their own consciousness the consciences in in a way of
[02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:53.900]  saying uh you have to ask yourself how was it possible for me to be duped uh how how could i
[02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:59.740]  be fooled for so long right from because many were and i would say if the only thing you've learned
[02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:05.500]  from this is that ron paul and rand paul are people that you can't trust that is better than
[02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:11.340]  nothing but that is not going to be enough you've got to see that their betrayal is rooted in austrianism
[02:38:11.340 --> 02:38:16.540]  and libertarianism that the doctrine itself is designed to promote false consciousness in other
[02:38:16.540 --> 02:38:23.340]  words a fantastic distortion of reality and a kind of political action that cuts the throats of the
[02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:29.100]  people who promoted right it's a way to say come and flame me alive that's what i'm demanding
[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:34.620]  and if you look at at europe right you look at cereza in greece they're fighting against austerity
[02:38:34.620 --> 02:38:41.100]  whereas the polls were coming saying we're going to impose one trillion dollars of a really uh
[02:38:41.100 --> 02:38:48.380]  brutal savage austerity but now take a step back from that the betrayal last week was bipartisan
[02:38:48.380 --> 02:38:57.580]  this is what has to be grasped we had an epiphany of treachery obama last week betrayed the magnificent
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:02.940]  movement of working people in wisconsin right you've got a fascist governor walker he wants to
[02:39:02.940 --> 02:39:07.820]  bust the unions he wants to destroy the state health system he wants to destroy the state
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:13.100]  educational system the guy is an enemy of civilization so working people mobilized they
[02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:19.020]  gathered a million signatures it is the biggest signature gathering effort in any state of the
[02:39:19.020 --> 02:39:26.940]  united states ever in proportion to population uh obama in 2007 had said if workers are being
[02:39:26.940 --> 02:39:31.900]  deprived of their rights anywhere i will get some comfortable shoes and i will go out and walk the
[02:39:31.900 --> 02:39:38.140]  picket line with you as president of the united states he never lifted a finger he never went there
[02:39:38.140 --> 02:39:44.380]  he didn't send biden he didn't send solace the secretary of labor he didn't send uh the attorney
[02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:50.780]  general to look into obvious violations of law including voting law and now the thanks to the
[02:39:50.780 --> 02:39:56.540]  hack democrat uh barrett the wisconsin movement has gone down to defeat so the people who are
[02:39:56.540 --> 02:40:01.980]  betrayed by ron paul and rand paul on the one side are in good company because they're joined by this
[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:06.620]  tremendous movement of working people in the midwest they were trying to fight off these uh
[02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:11.340]  these governors the governors of course controlled by alec right american legislative exchange
[02:40:11.340 --> 02:40:17.180]  council meaning the kutch brothers meaning big money from new york city right as populist as they
[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:22.940]  as they try to be so i would say to people you have now got to ask yourself where that leaves
[02:40:22.940 --> 02:40:30.540]  you obama is being taken down the builder burgers are absolutely for romney and probably mitch daniels
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:36.220]  i regard that as part of a general fascist offensive in this country the goal will be
[02:40:36.220 --> 02:40:42.460]  to lower the american standard of living by approximately 25 percent in the next 12 months
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:48.700]  much as has been done in greece and if you think that will balance the budget look again in greece
[02:40:48.700 --> 02:40:55.980]  25 percent cut in the in the national budget and generally in the economy leads to the total
[02:40:55.980 --> 02:41:03.420]  death burden of the country going from 130 percent of gross domestic product to 170 percent that
[02:41:03.420 --> 02:41:08.620]  would the more you cut the bigger the deficit gets and it never ends i want to you continue to
[02:41:08.620 --> 02:41:14.220]  moment i want to inject something here you talk about synthesis the very same tax-free foundations
[02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:20.620]  try to control every movement and they push dependency they pushed welfareism they wanted
[02:41:20.620 --> 02:41:26.860]  to get a big mass of people dumbed down on welfare living off the dull big giant government
[02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:32.140]  operations unions cops outriding tickets to feather their nest all day on bankrupt families
[02:41:32.140 --> 02:41:37.020]  you know a mom with four kids in the back was snot coming out of their nose and so they know
[02:41:37.020 --> 02:41:40.940]  people they're mad at the big government mad at the unions making more money than they are
[02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:47.660]  uh bilgerberg and 66 had the head of the uh you know big unions there uh you know the big
[02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:51.980]  auto workers union selling them out my point is the unions have been taken over forever
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:41:57.660]  where they go to 100 years ago saying no to fascism and the rock of fellers with pinkerton
[02:41:57.660 --> 02:42:02.540]  security out shooting people taking people's private property you know the railroads just
[02:42:02.540 --> 02:42:07.740]  taking whatever they want uh i understand they rebranded themselves as free marketeers but
[02:42:07.740 --> 02:42:15.820]  that says the answer to their command and control socialist model they as carol quickly says in
[02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:21.020]  tragedy and hope they create both movements and then try to integrate them i mean certainly they
[02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:25.180]  didn't want ron paul talking about the federal reserve and the new world order and and you
[02:42:25.180 --> 02:42:29.500]  know the un and all this in the past i mean i don't agree with you that you know paul and
[02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:35.020]  rand are like operatives i mean i've met them i know them they believe in what they're saying
[02:42:35.020 --> 02:42:40.140]  so again i reject the big government and i understand the system after they've already
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:46.220]  bankrupted things wants to use libertarianism as a cover for austerity which means raise my taxes
[02:42:46.220 --> 02:42:51.500]  pay more of my money to bank or bailouts while pointing their finger all day at little old ladies
[02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:56.540]  having their welfare checks cut off i understand that if you're going to give now it's 34 trillion
[02:42:56.540 --> 02:43:02.700]  dollars the last five years to megabanks just in the us alone that they give to nobody and and the
[02:43:02.700 --> 02:43:07.500]  republicans never complain about that and then they want to cut off an old lady social security
[02:43:07.500 --> 02:43:13.260]  who's going to starve to death i get it okay i understand there's unlimited money and resources
[02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:18.780]  and ingenuity robotics all of it i know the globalists admit they want to post industrial world
[02:43:18.780 --> 02:43:23.420]  they're fighting to keep the economy stalled they want to stall the economy with carbon taxes in
[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:28.300]  california so they can consolidate i understand the basics of economics i understand we're in a
[02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:34.380]  rigged game but i mean how do we navigate out of this well what we've just had is an object lesson
[02:43:34.380 --> 02:43:40.140]  the republican party and the democratic party are both hopelessly rotten and must be jettison
[02:43:40.140 --> 02:43:47.420]  turn away from them do not ever in your life ever again go for a an establishment politician a 10 or
[02:43:47.420 --> 02:43:53.900]  12 term congressman from the republican party or a young state senator uh this i think is is the
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:59.580]  overwhelming lesson obama was a bait and switch obama said hope change i'll end the war in iraq
[02:43:59.580 --> 02:44:06.300]  and instead you got uh you know the the things that obama has a sherry um yeah and also uh you
[02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:11.260]  know he he has the right to kill you he has the right to put you in montanamo bay but with the
[02:44:11.260 --> 02:44:21.100]  paul's what we get is this um superficial pattern uh anti-war ron paul voted for the motion to apply
[02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:27.820]  military force he voted for the 9 11 resolution he voted for the afghan war and when he voted for that
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:34.060]  that is the entire totalitarian transformation of the united states is in that bill the the motion
[02:44:34.060 --> 02:44:42.380]  for military force of uh of september october 2001 ron paul hasn't got a leg to stand on he voted for
[02:44:42.380 --> 02:44:47.740]  all of these things for the war the dictatorship and all the rest and he and and as you should
[02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:55.420]  remember he he repudiated 9 11 truth not once but twice reputed at 9 11 truth in the 2008 campaign
[02:44:55.420 --> 02:45:01.100]  and then again on january 1st of this year with jake tapper but here's the thing what are we going
[02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:07.020]  to do about this i would say right now a void has opened up the builder burgers are dismantling obama
[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:13.820]  the ron paul ran paul illusion is collapsing the ad busters this is also funny ad busters and occupy
[02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:20.540]  wall street there's a beautiful tape by this foulmouth comedian bill mar who mocks occupy wall
[02:45:20.540 --> 02:45:25.740]  street he says you are a bunch of anarchists you want to camp in the park you like to go out there
[02:45:25.740 --> 02:45:31.340]  and and sleep among the hedges and all this stuff this is impotent he compared to me said the tea
[02:45:31.340 --> 02:45:38.300]  party gets 60 70 members of the house of representatives and a few senators so far you guys have nothing
[02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:44.460]  so they're collapsing paul's collapsing occupy collapsing wisconsin movement betrayed by obama
[02:45:44.460 --> 02:45:51.660]  obama being taken down i see a political void let's fill that void let's have a national emergency
[02:45:51.660 --> 02:46:01.340]  anti austerity conference against both parties it would be anti wall street anti war anti tyranny
[02:46:01.340 --> 02:46:06.540]  it would be uh in favor of seizing the federal reserve and using it for the benefit of the
[02:46:06.540 --> 02:46:12.140]  american people and for maintaining the social safety net well paul should be calling paul should
[02:46:12.140 --> 02:46:19.100]  be calling for seizing the federal reserve instead his son has endorsed romney who says it is outside
[02:46:19.100 --> 02:46:24.220]  of congress and congress has no power over it it is time to say goodbye to all that goodbye to the
[02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:29.660]  republican party sorry boys you know after some of us concluded this after bush right that we
[02:46:29.660 --> 02:46:35.500]  wouldn't be seen with a republican for five thousand years obama the case is open and shut
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:41.900]  both of these parties it's like grace right you have the uh the new democracy and the pasach and
[02:46:41.900 --> 02:46:47.820]  they both support imf austerity the republicans come at you with a chainsaw obama comes at you
[02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:54.220]  with the death of a thousand cuts and slow poisoning dump them both dump them both practically
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:46:59.100]  and theoretically in other words look into your own mind and see all of the assumptions
[02:46:59.100 --> 02:47:03.820]  that ron paul was going to save you he is not going to save you ron paul is looking out for ron
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:08.780]  and above all for little rand so we need an organizing alternative if you don't have some
[02:47:08.780 --> 02:47:15.020]  organization you are lost these unions you are right in a depression and with the ruling class
[02:47:15.020 --> 02:47:21.900]  mobilized in a fascist offensive as we're going to see now this year the the unions can't they cannot
[02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:27.500]  by themselves resist they're going to be swept away as they were in wisconsin we need some kind
[02:47:27.500 --> 02:47:34.780]  of we're not swept away they've been under control since the 50s 100 percent by the globalist this
[02:47:34.780 --> 02:47:39.660]  is governor walker governor walker who is a relative of bush right george herbert walker
[02:47:39.660 --> 02:47:45.660]  bush and george walker bush that's their relative governor walker of wisconsin he is smashing those
[02:47:45.660 --> 02:47:51.500]  unions mitch daniels is going to be on the ticket because he was the most successful union smasher
[02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:58.300]  governor snider in michigan is sending in dictators to run betton harbour and flint and and paniak
[02:47:58.300 --> 02:48:03.580]  all listen listen we don't understand tarp you know you're an economist because of china and because
[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:07.980]  the globalist won't let us have any tariffs and so it's not free or fair trade because
[02:48:07.980 --> 02:48:12.540]  you know they got slave labor they've got hidden tariffs it's a joke it's the industrialized this
[02:48:12.540 --> 02:48:17.980]  there really can't be any unions anymore because there's no industry left to speak for so that's
[02:48:17.980 --> 02:48:25.020]  why it's all totally and then and then obama takes 20 plus billion in taxpayer money to pay
[02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:32.620]  to ship catalac and vault factories to china i mean a foreign army couldn't do that so join
[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:38.860]  me in campaigning for a protective tariff that's what i'm for i'm for mercantilism protectionism
[02:48:38.860 --> 02:48:42.860]  and derogism that's what degaul stood for explain why they didn't like degaul that's important
[02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:49.580]  because degaul said i am going to use the powers of government to modernize the french economy
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:54.620]  raise the standard of living go towards full employment this is why france has the best
[02:48:55.660 --> 02:49:03.420]  railway system in europe or at the tgv it has the best nuclear energy industry it has the best
[02:49:03.420 --> 02:49:08.860]  aeronautics right with the concord and the airbus and all the rest of it france you go back to you
[02:49:08.860 --> 02:49:13.180]  know right after world war two france had no aeronautics industry worth mentioning now they are
[02:49:13.180 --> 02:49:19.180]  a world leader thanks to airbus they can launch uh satellites uh no no but i mean degaul actually
[02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:24.300]  had to kick nato out he had to grab their nukes there was actually some military i mean there
[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:28.460]  were actually some military standoffs people don't know about that sarcozy brought france
[02:49:28.460 --> 02:49:34.620]  back in the nato give people some of the backstory on that there were 35 attempts by nato intelligence
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:41.580]  to murder degaul to assassinate him and it was used using vc fascists people left over from the
[02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:48.300]  from the nazi occupation government so degaul came on the scene with a coup d'etat in 57 58
[02:49:48.300 --> 02:49:53.900]  and this was a strong state i think people make a tremendous mistake if you think the the american
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:50:00.300]  state today is strong you're wrong we have a weak state we have a state that's pushed around by by
[02:50:00.300 --> 02:50:07.180]  jp morgan chase by exon mobile by uh hallibur look at the credit agencies run by the foreign banks
[02:50:07.180 --> 02:50:12.540]  who have governments begging at their knees to them and imagine the united states government

[02:54:13.340 --> 02:54:19.180]  calls we're gonna go a little bit into overdrive into the next hour with webster all i know is
[02:54:19.180 --> 02:54:26.220]  is that i try to study politics and history constantly and it is complex and the system
[02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:31.580]  knows that you talk about the general public they have no idea what's going on so we have
[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:37.100]  a very big government but he's right it's it's not strong in fact they're getting it where foreign
[02:54:37.100 --> 02:54:43.660]  corporations banks come in and boss the government blackwater during catrinum came into the mayor's
[02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:49.900]  office and said we're in command now they sent federal troops in to confiscate guns and that's
[02:54:49.900 --> 02:54:57.820]  what these neo feudalistic globalists set up and that's what they want they want a post industrial
[02:54:57.820 --> 02:55:04.540]  world this is their statement but they're using a gen 21 total government regulation on a little guy
[02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:11.020]  to shut us down while they the globalists give themselves a libertarian offshore system to be
[02:55:11.020 --> 02:55:17.260]  above it so it's not webster that they're really libertarians it's that they want a selective
[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:24.460]  libertarian system for themselves while total post industrial neo feudalistic hunger games
[02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:32.460]  serfdom under an environmental dictatorship for us i mean certainly there's the big government
[02:55:32.460 --> 02:55:40.060]  model they're using selectively i mean what do you say to that dichotomy that they are synthesizing
[02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:46.140]  that i just mentioned well it reminds me of what people used to say about the soviets i'd say well
[02:55:46.140 --> 02:55:51.980]  uh you know this is not real marxism right the real real existing communism in these places is
[02:55:51.980 --> 02:55:58.940]  somehow not the not the pure doctrine it never was it never will be uh these these neo feudalists
[02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:04.620]  are actually acting out they're they're implementing the essence of libertarianism which is precisely
[02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:10.860]  that that you go into living hell and they go into some paradise right whether it's an aspen or
[02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:16.300]  offshore or in switzerland whatever it is in other words it is the war of the one percent against
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:23.180]  the 99 percent but it's that the that war being conducted with the 99 percent drug stupefied
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:29.500]  incapable of understanding their own interests i would say we have to be uh first of all students
[02:56:29.500 --> 02:56:35.100]  of what's going on in the world right look at greece the syriza block with alexis sepras they
[02:56:35.100 --> 02:56:40.620]  are going to be fighting this coming sunday june 17th they have already passed the equivalent
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:45.820]  of the republican and the democratic party the two major parties in greece are collapsing
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:52.460]  thanks to thanks to this syriza block let's learn from them what's their program right no austerity
[02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:59.100]  no no attacks on unions social justice put the bankers in jail and a debt moratorium right if
[02:56:59.100 --> 02:57:03.900]  if you have uh too much debt in a country like this then you're going to have to postpone the
[02:57:03.900 --> 02:57:09.100]  payments right freeze it for a while they've gone from four percent to thirty percent and they may
[02:57:09.100 --> 02:57:14.060]  become the next government that's the most inspiring thing i can see we need to learn from those
[02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:20.620]  examples look at what succeeds what fails paulism has failed syriza is succeeding the wisconsin
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:26.460]  method has also failed don't let the democratic party come in and take your mass struggle and turn
[02:57:26.460 --> 02:57:32.940]  it into a political campaign with consultants and tv ads for one of their hacks that's why i say
[02:57:32.940 --> 02:57:39.580]  national emergency anti austerity conference sometime in august when the supreme court
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:45.180]  comes down with their opinion on obama care this will be from the rats cabal roberts
[02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:51.500]  alito thomas scalia and they were probably going to say obama care is unconstitutional
[02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:57.260]  and by the way the american people have no economic rights we're stripping you of social security
[02:57:57.260 --> 02:58:02.380]  medicare medicaid and everything else we're going to leave you nothing but your eyes to cry with we
[02:58:02.380 --> 02:58:08.300]  are going to play you alive who can fight back against that the unions as you're correctly saying
[02:58:08.300 --> 02:58:14.300]  can't because they are slaves to obama the paul's will be joining in they'll be cheerleading they'll
[02:58:14.300 --> 02:58:21.740]  say yeah flame alive flame alive this is our predicament we've got to have some form of national
[02:58:21.740 --> 02:58:28.460]  self defense to assert the interests of the vast majority of the population and 75 percent of
[02:58:28.460 --> 02:58:33.660]  americans want their medicare their social security and their medicare they don't want to be but
[02:58:33.660 --> 02:58:38.860]  that's the trap they get you addicted to the government then like a crack dealer they start
[02:58:38.860 --> 02:58:43.500]  taking it away i think that's that's hold on oh god breaks her there we have to do those thank you

[03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:31.100]  coming up we're gonna have a ton of news breakdown of information on what's happening in our world
[03:00:31.100 --> 03:00:36.940]  as all these bureaucracies and private corporate interests come in and basically take over government
[03:00:36.940 --> 03:00:44.380]  and weaponize government against the people webster i get that you can have government that
[03:00:44.380 --> 03:00:48.780]  directs development the problem is this is a global eugenics corporate government that
[03:00:48.780 --> 03:00:53.900]  exempts itself from its own rules they they're weaponizing government at every level against
[03:00:53.900 --> 03:01:00.860]  this to spy and surveil and electro shock us to death and it's all going to hell in a handbasket
[03:01:01.500 --> 03:01:06.700]  and they're launching all these new proxy wars using al-qaeda to attack syria and take over libya
[03:01:06.700 --> 03:01:11.740]  and then i'm not patriotic if i don't support al-qaeda you've been to syria we're out of time
[03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:16.700]  i'll have you back soon but briefly give us your take on the admissions that they're using al-qaeda
[03:01:16.700 --> 03:01:22.220]  against syria right now but nothing new right there al-qaeda is the cia arab legion and they're
[03:01:22.220 --> 03:01:28.300]  the ground troops but just the to return to your last point the answer is not to not to take people's
[03:01:28.300 --> 03:01:32.780]  food stamps away you want to recover here it is in a nutshell seize the federal reserve you can do
[03:01:32.780 --> 03:01:37.340]  it with a phone call a real president could call up and say bernanke here's what you're gonna do
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:43.420]  you're gonna issue one trillion dollars of credit stimulus zero percent hundred years and you are
[03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:48.940]  gonna give the states you're gonna buy bonds from the states and the bankers get that we the people
[03:01:48.940 --> 03:01:54.140]  don't know and and they're gonna give it to private contractors we're gonna rebuild the interstates
[03:01:54.140 --> 03:01:59.980]  the railways the energy systems the canals the waterways schools hospitals public buildings
[03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:05.660]  we're gonna have a space program again that could all be financed through federal lending not federal
[03:02:05.660 --> 03:02:10.780]  spending federal lending the fed can manufacture money out of the air right now they do it at
[03:02:10.780 --> 03:02:16.940]  zero percent for zombie bankers and hedge fund hyenas only we say stop that we want zero percent
[03:02:16.940 --> 03:02:22.780]  for productive activities and that goes down to the restaurant the dry cleaner the auto repair shop
[03:02:22.780 --> 03:02:28.220]  those are productive they shouldn't have to pay sky high interest rates they should be close to zero
[03:02:28.220 --> 03:02:33.900]  and then you get a recovery so having a recovery is easy seize the fed don't destroy it we want
[03:02:33.900 --> 03:02:39.260]  that credit creating power job creation national infrastructure we could we could show the world
[03:02:39.260 --> 03:02:45.340]  how you defeat a depression in a single day we could do it so there's no reason to be pessimistic
[03:02:45.340 --> 03:02:50.220]  there's every reason to be optimistic no i saw listen i think system is optimistic sure i i mean
[03:02:50.220 --> 03:02:54.940]  i agree with what you're saying the issue is that's not the direction we're going in need a mass
[03:02:54.940 --> 03:03:00.860]  movement we need to change the direction in sir in greece greece was being destroyed people were
[03:03:00.860 --> 03:03:06.460]  committing suicide syriza came forward and said we're here to fight let's fight let's not be so
[03:03:06.460 --> 03:03:11.020]  damn worried about what the enemy is doing let's worry about what we're going to do and we need
[03:03:11.020 --> 03:03:15.980]  independent organization we've seen the tragedy if you go into an organization that's controlled by
[03:03:15.980 --> 03:03:21.980]  finance capital through the polls or through through the you know the uh this guy barrett in
[03:03:21.980 --> 03:03:28.300]  wisconsin or whatever it is you lose independent organization not controlled by wall street or
[03:03:28.300 --> 03:03:35.260]  the couch brothers or soros or any of their stooges well we're living in incredible times because
[03:03:35.260 --> 03:03:39.820]  the corporate welfare people are imploding things about design they're taking over europe
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:45.420]  they're militarizing against us and uh they undoubtedly they have a plan to take over we
[03:03:45.420 --> 03:03:49.820]  have to develop a plan we need a plan and an organization to back it up and that's what it is
[03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:54.380]  without organization you're nowhere you can't have enough guns i'm sorry you can't have enough
[03:03:54.380 --> 03:04:00.620]  survival stocks it's it's it's pathetic you've got to have organization that's where power resides
[03:04:00.620 --> 03:04:06.060]  a political organization again syriza from four percent to thirty percent why can't we do that
[03:04:06.060 --> 03:04:12.300]  here we could work rather easily but people have got to get on board forget the polls forget around
[03:04:12.300 --> 03:04:19.580]  the time uh to give us your leprechaun imitation uh and remember that uh ron paul was talking fetishism
[03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:26.700]  alienation magical thinking right me me that was his program right he thinks that gold has
[03:04:26.700 --> 03:04:33.420]  magical powers no gold represents really the productive power of humanity projected onto a
[03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:38.700]  metal the value of a currency is what can you buy with it what about lep in the hood what about
[03:04:38.700 --> 03:04:44.220]  lep in the hood and lep in the hood out to do no good that's ron paul lep in the hood out to do no
[03:04:44.220 --> 03:04:50.780]  good so that's the leprechaun series i trust i'll be getting a check from them here's something else
[03:04:50.780 --> 03:04:56.940]  tarply thank you for spending time with us okay another perspective another perspective from tarply
[03:04:56.940 --> 03:05:21.740]  okay uh god bless you folks transmission will continue
