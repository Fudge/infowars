[00:00.000 --> 00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.680 --> 00:21.440]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.440 --> 00:31.160]  coming up at the bottom of the next hour info wars nightly news news director rob do and
[00:31.160 --> 00:39.680]  info wars nightly news anchor david night will be joining me in studio there is an attempt
[00:39.680 --> 00:48.200]  to shut down a large venue that we reach let's be conservative I say we reach 20 million people
[00:48.200 --> 00:53.800]  a week it's it's it's way more than that on amnfm youtube and hundreds of other platforms
[00:53.800 --> 01:03.080]  boxy rocu global shortwave the list goes on and on but youtube is 10% of that and we
[01:03.080 --> 01:10.720]  get five six seven eight million views a week just on our one channel all together more
[01:10.720 --> 01:16.480]  than 10 million views a week so see I'm being very conservative when I say 20 million listeners
[01:16.480 --> 01:23.040]  are viewers a week because just on youtube just on our channels it's 10 million our
[01:23.040 --> 01:30.200]  big channel has 474 million views you had our other channels together it's over 600
[01:30.200 --> 01:34.840]  million you had other channels that aren't ours together it's over a billion a billion
[01:34.840 --> 01:48.800]  views just since 2008 and when I got the pennsylvania newspaper to do a retraction on a hit piece
[01:48.800 --> 01:53.120]  claiming that one of my listeners killed three cops when the guy was actually after me saying
[01:53.120 --> 01:58.840]  he wanted to get me that's what was actually on his computer he'd actually made threats
[01:58.840 --> 02:09.920]  towards us via his handle when I forced a retraction in that major newspaper Pittsburgh
[02:09.920 --> 02:14.200]  we showed the article on screen and they did a copyright claim well folks I know copyright
[02:14.200 --> 02:19.200]  law but any idiot knows you can show newspapers on television you can show short clips of
[02:19.200 --> 02:24.320]  films to analyze them you can show commercials and analyze them total fair use it's it's
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.560]  completely frivolous and I had to go fight that and had to threaten lawsuits you name
[02:29.560 --> 02:38.960]  it well now the so-called sandy hook defender crusaders have gone in and done a copyright
[02:38.960 --> 02:47.120]  claim off of showing BBC news articles where in Pakistan they clearly hold up the image
[02:47.120 --> 02:52.560]  of supposedly dead terror victim victims and in there is the photo of one of the sandy
[02:52.560 --> 02:58.760]  hook dead and so people were reporting on it we reported on the report so our report
[02:58.760 --> 03:03.880]  is a derivative report of somebody else's report totally protected up one side and down
[03:03.880 --> 03:14.480]  the other and they went in here the honor network Larry posner who reportedly lost
[03:14.480 --> 03:21.760]  his son at sandy hook and then he says a fox news claim so it appears to be a completely
[03:21.760 --> 03:28.560]  fraudulent claim maybe someone posing as Lenny Posner did this as well we could have posers
[03:28.560 --> 03:39.320]  of posers but they go on to say Fox News they claim is the video that's a violation there
[03:39.320 --> 03:44.600]  is no Fox News video it is a news article with David Knight talking about it we're putting
[03:44.600 --> 03:51.720]  it on screen right now imagine and this group's reportedly trying to also copyright people
[03:51.720 --> 03:54.880]  names well you can do that but you can only copyright if someone's trying to use a name
[03:54.880 --> 04:00.680]  for sale of something like we wanted to use an image of his son to sell milk or something
[04:00.680 --> 04:05.240]  we couldn't do that but we're showing it in news first amendment protected and we could
[04:05.240 --> 04:10.040]  say his son's name we can say his name and we're not the people calling these families
[04:10.040 --> 04:14.360]  up I was criticized early on for saying no I think sandy hook probably happened but I
[04:14.360 --> 04:22.160]  think that they had a lot of PR people there we didn't get the full story and then now
[04:22.160 --> 04:25.800]  all these experts have come out and really shown that it's even worse than we thought
[04:25.800 --> 04:30.280]  certainly there's a cover up and we've had different investigators who get visited by
[04:30.280 --> 04:38.360]  the feds and others and threaten to stop investigating so this is how they plan to take down the
[04:38.360 --> 04:44.400]  internet with all these fake applications of copyright law and we're not going to take
[04:44.400 --> 04:50.240]  it I mean I'll go to court I'll follow lawsuits whatever anybody tries to shut down my free
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.040]  speech you better get ready for a fight like I always say I'm not looking for a fight but
[04:55.040 --> 05:00.800]  you come up and legally punch me in the nose you're going to get it back for all of recorded

[08:44.000 --> 08:51.600]  attack and the attack we're seeing is the profile of censorship in the 21st century
[08:52.640 --> 09:00.320]  so we're going to be breaking down an attempt to ban info wars and this news program from the
[09:00.320 --> 09:09.600]  internet and if these type of novel legal claims are successful no one has free speech
[09:09.600 --> 09:17.040]  including the right to speak period you've all heard about corporations like mcdonald's and
[09:17.040 --> 09:23.920]  others that have sued the mcdonald's family that has owned a tavern and castle for over 800 years
[09:23.920 --> 09:31.200]  in scotland they don't care if they lost the lawsuit it's meant as a form of harassment and
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.400]  you've all heard about corporations trying to copyright names where people can't speak them
[09:36.960 --> 09:40.400]  well the courts have held that you can't do that disney and others have tried it
[09:41.040 --> 09:47.040]  but they continue these activities and this is under sopa and syspa and all these other systems
[09:47.040 --> 09:54.240]  what they're trying to bring into place so i'm going to get into all of this important news
[09:56.960 --> 10:03.680]  we're going to get into brian williams and the another key signpost on the death of the dinosaur
[10:04.400 --> 10:12.400]  media we're going to be getting to that as well here today we're going to get into an article
[10:12.400 --> 10:17.680]  out of the new american magazine that i tend to agree with net neutrality is a trojan horse virus
[10:17.680 --> 10:24.000]  infecting the internet in this case the antidote is worse than the poison and and and see things
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.480]  are subtle things are complex i'm for net neutrality as it's been known but now the fcc and others
[10:30.480 --> 10:34.640]  as i've been warning because i actually read what they've been putting out want to take control of
[10:34.640 --> 10:43.920]  the internet and start regulating it in the name of protecting it so we're going to be breaking that
[10:43.920 --> 10:50.560]  down it's where they play these games with definitions here's another issue when it comes
[10:50.560 --> 10:56.400]  to free speech this out of tech dirt police officers can sue newspaper for publishing
[10:56.400 --> 11:02.560]  descriptive info raising serious first amendment issues it seems likely this particular ruling is
[11:02.560 --> 11:10.240]  uh now likely to be cited against the reporters quite a lot out of the ninth circuit court very
[11:10.800 --> 11:16.960]  very scary stuff and we're not anti police but we have a right to film the police as long as we
[11:16.960 --> 11:22.080]  don't interfere with their activities and we have a right to publish names of police you're not secret
[11:22.080 --> 11:27.680]  agents and you see obama persecuting whistleblowers and reporters at every level this is part of a
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.120]  reign of terror on free speech and police want access to their first amendment just like the
[11:33.120 --> 11:39.280]  general public does we're all in this together so it's a very dangerous trend and at info wars
[11:39.280 --> 11:47.600]  we try to post articles about positive things police are doing those articles really don't get
[11:47.600 --> 11:52.240]  read very much and that's because the public has turned against the police in many areas of the
[11:52.240 --> 11:58.240]  country and again that's a complex globalist operation as well a dialectic i mean we got
[11:58.240 --> 12:03.920]  two articles today we've got a report on this stuff when it's so brazen uh so out of control uh
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.880]  indiana man visits family in alabama cops paralyze him for walking around neighborhood
[12:08.880 --> 12:13.520]  here's another article i guess steve watson's on the cop beat right now he's writing some positive
[12:13.520 --> 12:18.320]  articles as well but cop shoots child for standing next to another child holding a toy gun
[12:18.320 --> 12:24.400]  and yesterday there was a video of a unarmed little kid up on a balcony and the cop just
[12:24.400 --> 12:28.880]  pulls a gun on him and shoots him so i mean you you don't need to hire police officers
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.400]  up with these psychological profiles that they're scared of their own shadow or trained to be basically
[12:34.400 --> 12:40.320]  gunfighters who instinctively shoot that might be great in a firefight with other quote professionals
[12:40.320 --> 12:46.000]  but against the general public it's just going to cause carnage and and and it's going to stimulate
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.320]  a lot of hatred towards the police and the social engineers knew when they brought all this training
[12:50.320 --> 12:56.080]  in that it was going to cause a civil war basically a slow burn civil war in this country but i'm
[12:56.080 --> 13:02.240]  already digressing into one of the things that really upsets me and really really worries me
[13:02.240 --> 13:10.080]  uh but that's coming up uh there is a bunch of news obama uh and congress exploit uh a death to
[13:10.080 --> 13:17.440]  push for war in syria and iraq uh we also have obama trying to get a blank check war
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.320]  authorization obviously the last few days and ron paul has come out and said that obama's
[13:22.320 --> 13:31.200]  fourth authorization is a blank check for worldwide war it's beyond the war powers act it just gets
[13:31.200 --> 13:36.080]  crazier and crazier and crazier the amount of dictatorial power this president's getting on
[13:36.080 --> 13:42.800]  open borders on energy on on the second amendment on defense but the republicans are going along
[13:42.800 --> 13:48.160]  with it because the same special interest that fund the republican rhino leadership the same
[13:48.160 --> 13:54.960]  people that wrote obama care this is what they want so obama just puts a liberal candy coating
[13:54.960 --> 14:00.080]  front on it he's also part african so they can make it all about race everything he's doing
[14:00.080 --> 14:06.800]  everything when he's really bringing in global policies that massively increased taxes on africans
[14:06.800 --> 14:13.040]  cut off uh real aid and it's just absolutely destroying africa right now and as a lot of our
[14:13.040 --> 14:18.720]  experts said before obama got in and as we break down an obama deception that obama would basically
[14:18.720 --> 14:26.800]  invade africa by employing and exporting radical islamicists importing them into the country
[14:26.800 --> 14:33.120]  into the different nations and you watch obama deception with you know 40 something million
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.240]  views on youtube for almost 15 million just on one video alone there's a bunch of versions
[14:39.600 --> 14:43.760]  before google video took it down they just got rid of google video and we could get into the
[14:43.760 --> 14:48.800]  account and see it it had another 20 million views on a google video i mean that's a film that's been
[14:48.800 --> 14:57.360]  seen 60 million times on google platforms alone that just shows the power of the people and that shows
[14:58.320 --> 15:03.520]  why they're trying to censor us and that brings me into this topic that we will then basically
[15:04.800 --> 15:11.680]  recess on until the bottom of the next hour when rob do infill wars manly news director and
[15:12.640 --> 15:17.920]  david knight in force manly news co anchor with jacari and leon and others he's going to be in
[15:17.920 --> 15:23.360]  here they're going to be in here breaking down this but but let me just cover this right now
[15:25.040 --> 15:28.720]  and just yesterday i was talking about how we had almost 500 million views
[15:28.720 --> 15:36.320]  on one channel the alex jones channel since it was set up in february 11 2008 i was mentioning
[15:36.320 --> 15:40.400]  it was my birthday yesterday and then a fan had set it up for my birthday and without me knowing
[15:41.040 --> 15:45.280]  years ago dav thomas so i mentioned they really want to shut this down they're really trying
[15:45.280 --> 15:51.920]  and i want to show tv viewers i'll describe it for radio listeners this copyright
[15:53.600 --> 16:01.280]  notification that is successful will take down the channel and already we're not able
[16:01.280 --> 16:08.080]  to upload over 15 minute videos and are in what they call probation guilty until proven innocent
[16:08.080 --> 16:14.880]  right now and again if they can do this to us they can do it to anybody and we're going to
[16:14.880 --> 16:24.720]  give you the name of the video as well that they are trying to censor mystery sandy hook victim dies
[16:24.720 --> 16:31.200]  again in pakistan and i'm going to show you some of these photos from the bbc of people in pakistan
[16:31.200 --> 16:35.840]  holding up photos of children they say were killed by terrorists and it is one of the sandy hook
[16:35.840 --> 16:46.640]  victims so we just said man what's going on in pakistan um what are they faking well the answer
[16:46.640 --> 16:55.440]  to that was the h o n r or honor network lenny posner who reportedly lost his son there um
[16:56.480 --> 17:02.320]  came in and followed a copyright claim on us showing a bbc news article you can't do that for
[17:02.320 --> 17:07.840]  those that don't know how copyright works i could show a clip off the news if i was analyzing it
[17:07.840 --> 17:12.080]  in commentary but i could certainly show newspapers all day long i've been doing this for 20 years i
[17:12.080 --> 17:16.640]  took rtf that was the first thing they taught us i've had to sit in on lawyer meetings i've been
[17:16.640 --> 17:22.640]  involved in lawsuits that we've won dealing with this and i've countersued people it's all on record
[17:22.640 --> 17:27.520]  i know what i'm talking about i know what i'm talking about on defamation knock on wood we've
[17:27.520 --> 17:32.000]  never had that problem other people haven't have settled with us out of court twice so
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.840]  i know of what i speak and you can't go to somebody's youtube channel and say they showed
[17:37.840 --> 17:47.040]  a news article from the bbc and then say that you can't show that because someone in pakistan
[17:47.040 --> 17:52.880]  was holding up a photo of your son who reportedly died at sandy hook and they're saying that the
[17:52.880 --> 17:58.000]  same person died in a terror attack in pakistan obviously we've got to investigate this just
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.840]  like we investigated brian williams and his claims so we're you know we're sorry for everybody's
[18:03.840 --> 18:08.720]  losses whatever we're investigating this though because we live in a system where the media
[18:08.720 --> 18:14.480]  exploits things and twists things paul watson thinks the official story of sandy hook is true
[18:14.480 --> 18:20.560]  he's my chief reporter and we get major heat from the folks that thinks that sandy hook was totally
[18:20.560 --> 18:26.400]  staged saying why aren't you on the same page because we're investigating i think there's some
[18:26.400 --> 18:31.200]  cover-ups there i know they're using blue screens i've seen the footage of people going in and out
[18:31.200 --> 18:36.400]  in circles in the building it doesn't look right it doesn't pass the smell test down
[18:38.160 --> 18:45.120]  there there are literally hundreds of of smoking guns here that this thing doesn't add up
[18:46.880 --> 18:50.400]  now this group and we're going to skip this network break this is so important because there
[18:50.400 --> 18:57.040]  won't be a show if stuff like this is successful i mean this is an attack on everybody's free speech
[18:57.040 --> 19:02.400]  this group and i'm going to again show tv viewers radio listeners can go to info wars.com type in
[19:02.400 --> 19:08.480]  the search engine mystery sandy hook victim dies again and see our screenshots of the bbc articles
[19:08.480 --> 19:16.080]  and others that show mr posner's son that they're saying is a child killed in a terror attack a few
[19:16.080 --> 19:26.880]  months ago in pakistan this is january 2nd 2015 article and it goes on to say among the alleged
[19:26.880 --> 19:32.080]  victims of the terror attack in pakistan is the face of noah posner one of the children supposedly
[19:32.080 --> 19:38.480]  killed in the december 2012 sandy hook school shooting in newtown connecticut and then it goes
[19:38.480 --> 19:47.680]  through to indeed show his picture and again this is from the bbc and we have the screenshot
[19:47.680 --> 19:52.960]  of them showing this and we show two other news sources two other here's bbc news world
[19:53.840 --> 20:01.600]  and it shows again his photo there i mean who wouldn't point this out i mean is the pakistan
[20:01.600 --> 20:11.920]  bombing fake i mean one of these two is fake so the answer here is when top school safety experts
[20:11.920 --> 20:17.760]  that teach at a national level go and investigate these people have been on the show the feds and
[20:17.760 --> 20:21.600]  police show up at their house and threaten them to shut up and to stop investigating
[20:23.920 --> 20:26.240]  they've sealed all the cases they've torn down the school
[20:26.240 --> 20:34.000]  so we're not i mean i just want to tell this network of people something i'll have to go to
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.240]  sandy hook i'll have to get involved if i mean you're just stirring up a hornet's nest here because
[20:40.240 --> 20:46.240]  my reporters just just reported on this because it's a bizarre anomaly and needs to be looked into
[20:46.240 --> 20:53.040]  and now you're claiming that i violated copyright by showing screenshots of bbc news reports
[20:53.040 --> 20:59.680]  showing your son's photo being promoted as a victim of a terror attack in pakistan
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.120]  we have a long history of government staging things that don't even happen there are hundreds
[21:07.120 --> 21:13.120]  of false flags that are declassified so it's normal to question hillary when she says that she was
[21:13.120 --> 21:18.880]  shot at in bosnia and then there's footage of it not happening it's normal to question brian williams
[21:18.880 --> 21:24.000]  it's normal to question obama and to say hey there's death panels in this and hey you know they got
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.480]  caught shipping guns into mexico that killed thousands and killed dozens here to blame the
[21:28.480 --> 21:33.440]  second amendment and it came out in memos that it was to blame the second amendment on cbs news
[21:34.400 --> 21:40.080]  so in this type of environment where cy hersh has the headline two-time bullet surprise winner
[21:40.080 --> 21:49.920]  the entire bin laden story of his death is a not true he said 100 percent not true
[21:52.160 --> 21:56.160]  people say well then what you know what really happened well we don't know but the official
[21:56.160 --> 22:02.480]  story is not true they didn't bury him at sea the sailors are on record that there was no
[22:02.480 --> 22:06.720]  ceremony they admitted that didn't happen there was no situation room video feed they blew up the
[22:06.720 --> 22:10.560]  navy seals on the ground got rid of the ones they couldn't get rid of a month later blew them up
[22:10.560 --> 22:15.440]  i've had the navy seal families on i've talked the navy seals i was the first to break it i mean
[22:17.120 --> 22:22.560]  we are just investigating a system that lies almost all the time how do you know they're lying
[22:22.560 --> 22:27.920]  their lips are moving and so i early on said i can't believe that they would stage this i'm
[22:27.920 --> 22:32.080]  sure they killed real children uh you know there are crazy people out there and you know another
[22:32.080 --> 22:37.200]  prozac head and then i got attacked by people that don't believe anything the system says
[22:37.760 --> 22:44.240]  quite frankly i can't blame them but that's not the issue whether you think sandy hook smells or
[22:44.240 --> 22:53.040]  you don't whether your rob do that thinks it's totally fake or whether you're paul watson that
[22:53.040 --> 22:58.640]  thinks the story is true these are both legitimate men who are smart who disagree in my operation
[22:58.640 --> 23:06.560]  i still don't know exactly what happened i mean i knew 14 years ago that saudi arabia quarterback
[23:06.560 --> 23:12.240]  9 11 because i interviewed the head of the visa section at the u.s. embassy in saudi arabia
[23:12.800 --> 23:19.840]  in riyadh i talked to scores of experts i i read colonel schaefer uh in the san francisco
[23:19.840 --> 23:25.520]  chronicle saying they were ordered to stand down i i talked to cfr people uh that said it was all
[23:25.520 --> 23:31.440]  staged and he was already dead and and then here we are 14 years later and they say there's 28 pages
[23:31.440 --> 23:35.840]  that says exactly that and that they're going to declassify i mean i was proving right again
[23:37.040 --> 23:42.880]  i don't know the whole story i just know what we're being lied to it's like a police investigation
[23:42.880 --> 23:48.480]  when you show up and uh you say is there anything going on you know anything in that back bedroom
[23:48.480 --> 23:52.560]  we just heard some noises no you go on there and there's a woman tied up now i don't know exactly
[23:52.560 --> 23:57.520]  how she got tied up or why she's got cuts all over but i think the guy that came to the front door
[23:57.520 --> 24:01.840]  who said nothing was going on when the neighbors reported hearing somebody screaming i think he's
[24:01.840 --> 24:07.200]  lying do i know the whole story no i don't know the whole story but am i being lied to absolutely
[24:07.200 --> 24:14.160]  i'm being lied to absolutely and then my reporters simply say look here's the bvc and the london
[24:14.160 --> 24:21.200]  telegraph and the pakistani tv all showing this guy's reportedly dead son may he rest in peace we're
[24:21.200 --> 24:28.080]  sorry for that and then this group comes and says that we violated their copyright and then claim
[24:28.080 --> 24:38.240]  fox news so they're using a fox news id to trigger the suspension of the alec shone channel that if
[24:38.240 --> 24:44.160]  they're successful they will shut down videos thousands of videos and reports and millions
[24:44.160 --> 24:48.960]  of dollars of work in fact let's go to the about page on the alec shone channel one of many channels
[24:48.960 --> 24:53.200]  we have and by the way they're all linked together so they take one down they take them all down
[24:53.200 --> 24:57.280]  paul watson's with 30 something million you know another with 40 something million another with 100
[24:57.280 --> 25:07.200]  million another with 475 million and these videos continue to grow so there's about a million subscribers
[25:07.200 --> 25:14.080]  950 000 plus subscribers on this one channel 474 million and let's see how many videos let's back
[25:14.080 --> 25:19.120]  out on that it should say the number of videos that we have on the channel that used to i guess
[25:19.120 --> 25:26.320]  they're removing that stuff there are thousands of videos on that channel incredible work films
[25:27.360 --> 25:34.080]  you name it things we've risked our lives to bring you i mean the the incredible bundy ranch feds
[25:34.080 --> 25:42.560]  stand down interviews with world leaders exclusive after exclusive after exclusive and they want to
[25:42.560 --> 25:51.200]  come by and say that i'm a thief that i've stolen their copyright when it's us reporting on the news
[25:51.200 --> 25:58.640]  showing the image of people holding up his son's picture in pakistan saying he was killed by al-qaeda
[25:58.640 --> 26:05.120]  terrorist now if that isn't something that i mean this would be like brian williams saying i'm going
[26:05.120 --> 26:11.600]  to sue nbc because they're showing my picture or if we showed brian williams picture and said here
[26:11.600 --> 26:18.720]  is a known liar and then oh our website shut down we showed brian williams you understand folks
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.920]  this is this is how they're applying it now the only time you could do this is if i had a photo of
[26:23.920 --> 26:30.880]  his son and was using it for fundraising or if i had a photo of his poor son and i was selling
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.600]  tennis shoes with him as a spokesman you can't do that for commercial purposes
[26:37.600 --> 26:46.000]  but we're not in entertainment this is not a entertainment venue this is a hard core news
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.400]  venue completely protected under the first amendment and they know that they know that
[26:53.200 --> 26:58.320]  and this is the whole way under sopa and syspa globally where you get three claims just like
[26:58.320 --> 27:05.920]  the google model on by any company or individual that your website your profile your information
[27:05.920 --> 27:11.440]  and violates their copyright or is hurtful to them under political correctness and so
[27:11.440 --> 27:17.280]  called hate laws no judge no jury you are banned from the internet with a new global
[27:17.280 --> 27:22.080]  internet id number the keyboards are coming out with this the thumb printing you get into your
[27:22.080 --> 27:27.280]  iphone the internet kill switches cell phone kill switches it's all being announced i told you
[27:27.280 --> 27:32.240]  about it 15 years ago they're now telling you because they're getting ready to go operational
[27:32.240 --> 27:37.520]  and use it england announced they're going to take control of the cars by remote control
[27:38.720 --> 27:43.120]  if quote your car is in danger oh the robot's already in there it's going to drive to keep
[27:43.120 --> 27:48.560]  you safe the government literally activating the hacking boxes in the cars and rolling it out like
[27:48.560 --> 27:57.280]  it's a public service and this is how they plan to kill free speech take drugs report drugs report
[27:57.280 --> 28:05.840]  before has linked to a newspaper article sending them massive traffic at the los vegas review journal
[28:07.760 --> 28:13.520]  this happened five years ago sending millions of visitors the los vegas review journal
[28:14.480 --> 28:20.640]  and the los vegas review journal used a cutout company to sue drudge and over 400 other groups
[28:20.640 --> 28:29.120]  including us claiming that even linking to someone is copyright infringement when you're
[28:29.120 --> 28:34.880]  sending them a million plus visitors of course that ended up getting defeated and the group involved
[28:34.880 --> 28:40.320]  with that basically uh got plucked you can look into the whole right haven case you want to see
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.360]  what happened with that but i've been down these roads folks i know what i'm talking about and they
[28:45.360 --> 28:50.480]  think because they can hold out some little kids and say we're shutting people's websites down
[28:50.480 --> 28:56.080]  because they're belittling the memory of these children nowhere not but even if we were you
[28:56.080 --> 29:00.160]  couldn't violate our first amendment because that's what it's there for and if you take our rights you

[29:05.840 --> 29:10.720]  new black panther party has to say but you know what they got a right to say well guess what we
[29:10.720 --> 29:16.880]  didn't say that your son didn't die there we said boy why is this photo being shown by and all these
[29:16.880 --> 29:22.400]  different rallies and all over the news as one of the dead this is bizarre in pakistan and the
[29:22.400 --> 29:29.200]  response is to go in here and try to shut down our youtube channels that continue to rack up over
[29:29.200 --> 29:40.240]  10 million viewers a week that's incredible so look i have no other choice but to get the lawyers

[33:50.800 --> 33:52.240]  they'd like to lock us up
[33:52.240 --> 34:05.360]  i'm gonna stop butchering this misfit song ladies and gentlemen
[34:06.640 --> 34:13.760]  the first amendment is there for everybody it's there across the board
[34:15.520 --> 34:20.080]  and there are similar laws in supposedly other free societies in europe and other areas
[34:20.080 --> 34:22.880]  but this reign of terror
[34:25.440 --> 34:27.680]  that's going on across the internet
[34:28.720 --> 34:35.600]  misapplying copyright laws and saying that people can't videotape the police in public or
[34:36.640 --> 34:44.240]  that you can't stand in front of a mcdonald's or in front of another franchise and and talk
[34:44.240 --> 34:50.800]  about them in run back when they were going down in houston with our reporters but also with others
[34:50.800 --> 34:55.200]  would say you can't stand on the other side of the street and show our logo it's copyright
[34:55.200 --> 34:58.880]  they would have security guards come over to us we've got video this kevin booth has it
[34:58.880 --> 35:02.880]  we've played it many years ago we probably find it and they just say you can't videotape here
[35:03.680 --> 35:09.600]  this is our this is our logo and we're like excuse us um
[35:09.600 --> 35:13.280]  um the fellow reserve
[35:16.640 --> 35:23.040]  erin dykes and um rob jacobson wanted to get a far away shot at about a half mile away at the
[35:23.040 --> 35:30.800]  world war one memorial in kansas city of the fellow reserve bank there and here come armed
[35:31.360 --> 35:36.320]  security guards saying turn your camera off and get out of here you're basically violating our
[35:36.320 --> 35:41.840]  uh our rights by by videotaping our building we own that building you can't videotape it
[35:42.640 --> 35:46.080]  in fact there have been federal cases where the nsa would tell people they couldn't sit
[35:46.720 --> 35:50.000]  a half mile away and and get a shot of fort mead
[35:52.560 --> 35:59.200]  we've had our reporters in san antonio told in a walmart parking lot as it was jacari jackson uh
[35:59.200 --> 36:06.000]  that he couldn't videotape the new nsa facility as if it was a security risk as if anybody couldn't
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.480]  go show that this is an attempt to tell us that there's no free speech
[36:12.880 --> 36:18.720]  and it's a big deal and if we stop making it a big deal when this type of stuff happens
[36:19.680 --> 36:23.680]  then we're going to lose all of our basic freedoms as your tv viewer we're actually showing
[36:24.320 --> 36:28.320]  our footage of where they were shooting the world war one memorial the fellow reserve is down the
[36:28.320 --> 36:38.880]  street and the armed security guards look at that half mile away show up and say give us your id
[36:38.880 --> 36:42.800]  and i've told the guys not be confrontational so they go ahead and give them their id and they
[36:42.800 --> 36:46.240]  say well where's the day to go we're gonna arrest you and they start putting their hands on their
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.360]  guns so our guys just left and let them violate the first amendment then when the kansas city star
[36:52.960 --> 36:56.960]  called up the fellow reserve they said it wasn't real and never happened and then of course there's
[36:56.960 --> 37:03.840]  the first amendment so this is the type of stuff that goes on this is the type of stuff that happens
[37:03.840 --> 37:07.600]  and if you don't get really upset about it and you don't take action there's another article out
[37:07.600 --> 37:12.560]  today where they're in the news saying the FCC and congress are going to have hearings on censoring
[37:12.560 --> 37:18.560]  the drudge report and saying that his view on obama care or guns that by linking the news
[37:18.560 --> 37:24.480]  articles both pro and con that it's political speech and that that can be regulated as if
[37:24.480 --> 37:30.080]  it's campaign finance so they can lock matt drudge up or alex jones up like they did to nesta susa
[37:31.520 --> 37:38.960]  the nesta susa got nine months in a group home minimum security facility for getting five friends
[37:38.960 --> 37:45.520]  to give donations to his friend running for senate talk about having dirt under your fingernails
[37:45.520 --> 37:50.080]  going to prison while the government burns down the country while the criminals running it looted
[37:50.080 --> 37:59.200]  seven ways to niagara falls i mean this is crazy crazy and so there is a sustained attack going on
[37:59.200 --> 38:07.040]  and why don't they want us to talk about there it is FCC commission this is a massive power grab
[38:07.040 --> 38:15.520]  government at its worst yeah that's what's crazy is even the FCC admits that what obama's bringing
[38:15.520 --> 38:22.080]  forward as new FCC regulations is a massive power grab so even the FCC head is against it but the
[38:22.080 --> 38:27.600]  rest of the board part of the board is not and then FCC will have to do it congress says
[38:30.160 --> 38:34.560]  which is the way it's supposed to work but congress is is just so traitorous it's crazy
[38:35.840 --> 38:39.520]  now let me just finish up with this and i'm gonna give the number out and take your calls on this
[38:39.520 --> 38:48.080]  issue and a bunch of others are you worried about the state of the first amendment all over the country
[38:48.080 --> 38:52.000]  they were arresting people for filming police now they're passing laws saying you can't put
[38:52.000 --> 38:57.760]  security cameras on your own property that it's wiretapping while the government and google and
[38:57.760 --> 39:04.400]  everybody else surveil everything we're doing illegally in many cases they're saying we can't
[39:04.400 --> 39:09.520]  use these technologies to protect ourselves the system is scared to death of their own big brother
[39:09.520 --> 39:17.600]  system and it's not a monolith most people in the government are aware of what's happening and
[39:17.600 --> 39:23.120]  don't like it but it doesn't matter because the people running it at the top are bad news but
[39:23.120 --> 39:27.680]  we need to separate the bad guys at the top from the rank and file in government because
[39:27.680 --> 39:33.120]  they want us all fighting with each other there's another headline dims on FCC move to regular
[39:33.120 --> 39:40.800]  internet campaigns blogs drudge see more articles on that that's for 2014 there's a new one out today
[39:40.800 --> 39:47.840]  because now they're having the hearings and they're mentioning drudge report by name people go i
[39:47.840 --> 39:52.720]  don't care you know that guy's got a big website i don't care they take him down i love this grassroots
[39:52.720 --> 39:58.160]  idea that if somebody else gets in trouble it it makes the world better for you if they can shut
[39:58.160 --> 40:03.600]  down talk radio and if they can shut down the drudge report they can shut everything down
[40:04.400 --> 40:08.240]  they always go after the biggest dogs i got a lot of problems with rush limbaugh
[40:10.320 --> 40:14.240]  but and i'm in direct competition with rush limbaugh but when they were getting ready his
[40:14.240 --> 40:19.600]  sponsors i saw an opportunity to support the first amendment and get advertising for about
[40:19.600 --> 40:28.480]  half off and we made money running obama deception ads on drudge we spent what was it 180 200
[40:28.480 --> 40:37.040]  thousand dollars running obama deception ads on the rush limbaugh show
[40:39.680 --> 40:43.760]  and the weird thing was clear channel called a supper premiere that syndicates it
[40:43.760 --> 40:48.720]  and said well let's you run these ads but we're afraid of campaign finance stuff because it's
[40:48.720 --> 40:54.400]  against obama as if it's campaign finance uh to to to put a movie out showing how obama is a big
[40:54.400 --> 41:01.840]  liar and a globalist and so we had to announce that it was funded by alex jones at info wars.com
[41:01.840 --> 41:06.320]  which i didn't even try to put my name in the ad because i think that's kind of creepy
[41:06.320 --> 41:10.160]  to go on somebody else's show and advertise yourself so i was like oh throw me in that
[41:10.160 --> 41:15.520]  briar passion say it's alex jones and info wars.com thank you so much absolutely
[41:15.520 --> 41:23.120]  but see my instinct is a winner instinct when they're trying and they came close to to get
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.560]  in rush limbaugh cancelled like they did dr laura slashinger they came very close folks and a lot of
[41:28.560 --> 41:33.440]  people piled on it was my idea of people piled on i said hey you can buy advertising for less right
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.640]  now i think it's overpriced most of the time i'll be quite frank on limbaugh and i said right now
[41:38.640 --> 41:43.120]  you get it for half off that's not currently now it's expensive as it ever was and i said
[41:43.120 --> 41:46.320]  everybody needs to pile on and buy up as advertising that happened his show sold out
[41:46.880 --> 41:52.080]  they couldn't sell about 60 of the inventory i was told at the time uh when they were boycotting
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.160]  him so i just came out in the audience everybody should just spend my rush limbaugh now i wonder
[41:56.160 --> 42:01.280]  if they're ever trying to bring us down and i put out an sos anybody come to my aid because here's
[42:01.280 --> 42:07.280]  the thing if they can bring us down ladies and gentlemen they can bring you down that's common
[42:07.280 --> 42:14.400]  sense we hang together we hang separate if they were trying to shut down some liberal publication
[42:14.960 --> 42:22.400]  for garbage reasons i would if they had arrested michael more forgiving $50,000 in bundling just
[42:22.400 --> 42:26.640]  like they charged kin lay with it and he finally got off because it wasn't illegal the susan didn't
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.800]  want to fight it for a decade and spend four million dollars like or plus like kin laid it
[42:30.800 --> 42:37.040]  not kin lay that's not kin lay was horrible and it's ran off with enron who's the guy that was
[42:37.040 --> 42:43.040]  the republican leader out of texas i'm having one of those moments today uh who is a congressman
[42:43.040 --> 42:50.160]  and they persecuted the living daylights out of him and then he was found not guilty is it tom delay
[42:51.520 --> 42:57.680]  tom delay yeah okay that's why i said kin lay i don't have teleprompters here ladies and gentlemen
[42:57.680 --> 43:03.040]  it's just my memory and sometimes the easiest names will remember are the hardest as everybody knows
[43:04.560 --> 43:11.200]  now i've spent a lot of time on this i want to take your calls on first amendment attacks
[43:11.200 --> 43:14.960]  where do you think the first amendment free speech is going what are you doing to defend it
[43:15.760 --> 43:26.160]  800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 uh the observer drudge reports linked to this today out of england
[43:26.160 --> 43:31.360]  has done a report and and i'm in there about how mega viral info wars is and how we reach
[43:31.360 --> 43:37.440]  millions every day i mean every day there's news articles about how viral we are consistently and
[43:37.440 --> 43:43.040]  how we can now more and more set news agenda and force things out there to be debated the system
[43:43.040 --> 43:48.080]  does not like that that's why they want to shut down talk radio that's why they want to shut down
[43:48.080 --> 43:51.200]  the drudge report that's why they want to shut down info wars that's why they want to shut down
[43:51.200 --> 43:55.680]  world net daily they've been behind the scenes and joseph ferret doesn't really want me to talk about
[43:55.680 --> 44:02.720]  it but harassing the living daylights out of them you need to understand we're under attack
[44:03.520 --> 44:08.240]  and that means you're under attack and how you fight back against that is you realize we're
[44:08.240 --> 44:13.520]  winning that's why we're under attack ladies and gentlemen because we're cleaning the globalist
[44:13.520 --> 44:19.520]  clocks right now we don't work for special interest our special interest the american people our
[44:19.520 --> 44:25.120]  special interest is what's honorable our special interest is when men were men and women were women
[44:25.120 --> 44:31.440]  and cars were fast god guts and guns john wane john wane and ronald reagan it doesn't mean ronald
[44:31.440 --> 44:39.920]  reagan was perfect it means what ronald reagan said i absolutely agree with the symbol the idea
[44:39.920 --> 44:44.560]  is good just like the founders had some great ideas doesn't mean they ever realized one tenth
[44:44.560 --> 44:48.720]  of it everybody wants to criticize ran paul because he's been political a little bit and
[44:48.720 --> 44:52.320]  moves a little more towards the center so he has any chance of winning the presidency
[44:52.320 --> 44:59.200]  he's out right now saying hillary's involved with al qaeda and isis and that should be investigated
[45:00.400 --> 45:05.840]  they better be checking his airplanes for bombs folks you know how ballsy that is
[45:09.280 --> 45:12.400]  i can't imagine what ran paul goes through now at his level
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.960]  i know some of the inside baseball and let me tell you it ain't fun but we're here doing this because
[45:18.960 --> 45:23.200]  we care about freedom we want you to get a fair shake we want a fair shake
[45:24.560 --> 45:29.280]  and i take these attacks as an opportunity and this is just one that i'm mentioning i mean look at
[45:29.280 --> 45:35.840]  this fraudulently filed copyright claim and it may not even be this group it may be someone else
[45:35.840 --> 45:40.800]  fraudulently doing it in their name because i don't want to just sit here and say things about people
[45:40.800 --> 45:45.280]  i want to be careful about it but imagine our website would be shut down it says photo of
[45:45.280 --> 45:52.960]  child killed at sandy hook shows of a pakistan school shooting i mean we're not even saying on
[45:52.960 --> 45:58.240]  that headline that children weren't killed we get criticized for trying to be open about this
[45:58.240 --> 46:02.560]  because we can't prove it one way or the other so they take down our video photo of child killed
[46:02.560 --> 46:06.400]  at sandy hook shows of pakistan school shooting david night shows we're going to show the video
[46:06.400 --> 46:13.280]  next hour play it bbc articles and bbc news stills and different rallies showing this guy's son
[46:13.280 --> 46:18.560]  lenny posner you'd think lenny if this is really him filing this from the honor network
[46:21.040 --> 46:25.760]  would want to know why they're showing a son in pakistan why don't you call them
[46:25.760 --> 46:31.120]  why don't you call the bbc let me see did you put a copyright claim out on the bbc because they
[46:31.120 --> 46:36.400]  showed rallies showing your son's picture in pakistan that was reportedly killed at sandy hook
[46:36.400 --> 46:43.920]  i mean that's what the sandy hookers uh you know that are out there that are upset about people
[46:43.920 --> 46:50.000]  that see blue screens with cia operative anderson cooper's nose disappearing and circles of people
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.160]  going in and out of the building it looks like a hollywood production and then guys in the woods
[46:54.160 --> 46:58.080]  that are grabbed and camo and the media says they weren't there it turns out they were and
[46:58.080 --> 47:03.600]  they're an anti-terror force i mean and school experts say this is impossible i mean i don't know
[47:03.600 --> 47:12.240]  no for heaven's sakes i'm sad for your son regardless whatever's going on here but you
[47:12.240 --> 47:19.040]  want to get rid of our free speech that's outrageous and this is what they always push turn your guns
[47:19.040 --> 47:24.720]  in it's for the children turn your first amendment in it's for the children don't ask why you have
[47:24.720 --> 47:30.320]  multiple videos of cn reporters noses disappearing and you can see that it's a video in the background
[47:30.320 --> 47:35.200]  with the flowers blowing where they then blow again from the same position i mean we got green screen
[47:35.200 --> 47:42.000]  here folks we know what it looks like i run a tv studio 20 years on air folks we know what we're
[47:42.000 --> 47:49.360]  talking about we don't know what's going on we just know it doesn't look right so frustrating
[47:49.360 --> 48:03.360]  this is amazing the claimant is the ho in our network linnie posner
[48:05.360 --> 48:11.360]  ho in our network at gmail.com and they say the claimant is fox
[48:11.360 --> 48:22.320]  w e b e n enforcement web enforcement at fox.com so uh television episode has no title they don't
[48:22.320 --> 48:30.240]  claim what it is they showed that was theirs so are they partnered with fox in this fraud against
[48:30.240 --> 48:35.680]  the first amendment or is or is someone else filing this and posner's not involved and fox isn't
[48:35.680 --> 48:44.080]  involved so there you go ladies and gentlemen and if we try to upload this video today for you to see
[48:44.080 --> 48:49.360]  it they'll hit us with more of these and take the channel down for sure so until i filed and stated
[48:49.360 --> 48:57.040]  that this is fraudulent we won't even put this up on youtube that's the way these people operate
[48:57.040 --> 49:01.600]  this is newsworthy that the sandy hook organization one of the dominant organizations
[49:01.600 --> 49:07.600]  and these families have been used to push gun control you name it is now not just going
[49:07.600 --> 49:13.760]  after the second amendment they're now going after the first amendment what do you make of that i mean
[49:13.760 --> 49:18.400]  i guess should i just shut up forever and never and just just quit my show i mean i mean is that
[49:18.400 --> 49:23.920]  what you're saying or if i want to do a report on wells fargo bank laundering drug money that was in
[49:23.920 --> 49:29.200]  bloomberg if i go stand across from wells fargo will they claim it's oh i had the fellow reserve
[49:29.200 --> 49:34.880]  of san antonio three years ago when we had an in the fed rally out in front of it i forgot i had
[49:34.880 --> 49:39.680]  them claim a copyright claiming that their building was their copyrighted material and i could just
[49:39.680 --> 49:47.120]  show it of course that was overturned you people are out of your minds we're gonna go to mercedes
[49:47.120 --> 49:52.400]  brenton terry brian nathan and others i'll tell you this the system wants us shut down they're
[49:52.400 --> 49:58.080]  attacking us at every level because we are having a huge effect spread the word about the broadcast

[50:03.040 --> 50:08.800]  it may not be there tomorrow if we don't win this level of the fight because the system is coming in
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.880]  down with both feet against the first amendment and every other basic right as well but it's the
[50:14.880 --> 50:19.920]  first amendment for a reason and the way you vote for the first amendment is supporting it
[50:19.920 --> 50:25.280]  defending it spreading a word about those that are under attack that tell the truth and buying the

[54:24.640 --> 54:31.200]  ryan williams leading the pack down the toilet but if you go to this honor network that reportedly
[54:31.200 --> 54:36.000]  has filed this claim trying to take down our youtube channel and they have taken down the video
[54:36.000 --> 54:42.240]  and suspended some of our rights while we're quote under investigation they say on their website they
[54:42.240 --> 54:48.800]  will use every means necessary to shut down to bring awareness to hoaxers activity and to criminally
[54:48.800 --> 54:54.480]  and or civilly prosecute those who willingly and publicly defame harass and emotionally abuse the
[54:54.480 --> 54:59.600]  victims of high profile tragedies that means questioning any tragedy is abuse and that's
[54:59.600 --> 55:04.160]  what they're pushing in the EU where you can't criticize anything no more free speech of high
[55:04.160 --> 55:09.200]  profile tragedies and or family members we intend to hold such abusers personally accountable for
[55:09.200 --> 55:14.240]  their actions in whatever capacity the law allows well you better look into what happened to right
[55:14.240 --> 55:23.120]  haven and other groups that have gone down this road i mean i'm you know i'm sorry that you don't
[55:23.120 --> 55:29.360]  want us to show bbc showing your son at rallies of dead children in pakistan we just are saying
[55:29.360 --> 55:37.360]  something's going on here and we're sorry that you know the first amendment is so upsetting but
[55:40.960 --> 55:44.400]  we're going to be investigating this we're going to be looking into this we're going to be countering
[55:44.400 --> 55:51.360]  this and we're going to be dealing with this and i tell you it has been just an ongoing
[55:51.360 --> 55:56.240]  issue that even amongst my own reporters there's different views on this and they're all well
[55:56.240 --> 56:03.040]  balanced researched serious questions because we have a government and a corporate system that engages
[56:03.040 --> 56:08.320]  in hoax after hoax after hoax so we have to look at everything as if it could be a hoax and i'm sorry
[56:09.120 --> 56:14.400]  but that's what happens when the system loses all credibility i mean look at these headlines right
[56:14.400 --> 56:18.240]  here out of the new york times today we're going to start the next hour and go right to your calls
[56:18.240 --> 56:27.200]  brian williams scandal prompts frantic efforts at nbc to curb rising damage well just sue or
[56:27.200 --> 56:31.040]  shut down anybody that says brian williams name copyright his name and no one's allowed to say it
[56:31.040 --> 56:36.640]  brian williams ten dollars brian williams twenty dollars brian williams thirty dollars you can't
[56:36.640 --> 56:41.600]  do that but now this group the honor group says they're copywriting names and we can't say them
[56:42.800 --> 56:46.640]  i guess they'll go to our web providers and claim it but yeah you're just going to get sued
[56:46.640 --> 56:53.360]  you're going to lose i mean there's no debating it i've got course of action right now if this
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.480]  group stands up and says indeed they did this i don't want to do that just like jesse vinter
[56:58.480 --> 57:08.560]  didn't want to go after chris kyle and win in court but we got you and you want to attack us for
[57:08.560 --> 57:12.960]  saying it's a hoax when our reporters are investigating it and are on two different ends of the spectrum
[57:12.960 --> 57:18.720]  we are allowed to investigate and we will investigate and the question is why don't you want this
[57:18.720 --> 57:25.600]  investigated within mbc an intense debate over whether to fire brian williams washington post
[57:26.560 --> 57:29.760]  why some in bc view brian williams suspension as an exit strategy

[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:40.000]  wants to do to quote defend net neutrality that actually takes over the internet to other hoax
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.240]  where they're claiming we're now anti-net neutrality because we oppose obama's plans to quote protect
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:50.640]  net neutrality by regulating it and controlling it another bait and switch we're going to get into
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:59.040]  a bunch of first amendment issues in this hour now it ties into the media wars that are going on
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:06.880]  we've got more measles news we've got a bunch of politics news science news economy news world news
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:13.040]  it's all coming up but right now i'll just i'll recap in the next segment we just have a copyright
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:21.600]  claim by one of the largest sandy hook groups claiming that we can't show a clip just a screenshot
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:29.040]  of a bbc report and and other newspapers showing one of the reported dead of sandy hook as one of
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.720]  the dead at a terrorist attack and it is the same photo it is the child and we didn't say his kid
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:39.360]  wasn't killed and they came in and they're trying to take our youtube channel down this is a big
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:46.240]  deal folks again that'd be like saying i couldn't stand in front of a mcdonald's on the city street
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.160]  shoot a video report mcdonald's would claim a copyright claim because i showed the golden arches
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.920]  i can't put a golden arches up over my business as a trademark and sell goods under the golden
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.480]  arches so yes they could get me for copyright if i was selling stuff based off his son's image
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:09.600]  we're not we're we're reporting on another news report that's crazy i mean it's just absolutely
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:15.840]  cut and dry indefensible and uh they've sat on their site they do it to shut down people's speech
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.080]  so then in a court that would show malice of forethought to shut down the first amendment
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.320]  that's civil rights violation
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:32.320]  so you better talk to your lawyers over there at your honor network and or maybe
[01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.920]  they're but maybe they don't care maybe they think everybody's ignorant dumb out there and you can

[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:44.160]  issues that's out of tech dirt that ties into net neutrality is a trojan horse virus infecting the
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:50.160]  internet by the new american because they call it net neutrality having the obama administration
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:57.920]  come in to start using the FCC to regulate the web and it's very confusing but it's like they
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:05.360]  call obama care reform well the word reform isn't necessarily good and i've said this hundreds of
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.800]  times if you stick your hand in a blender and turn it on high it's going to reform your fingers
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:16.800]  they're going to be reformed if a deer jumps out in front of an 18-wheeler on 75 miles an hour

[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.200]  it's not a good reform so they're playing these games and they had all the democratic party websites
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:35.600]  i mean when i say all of them scores of them come out a few months ago and i said this so
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:40.720]  called net neutrality that's being brought forward by obama is the opposite and i got attacked for it
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:48.080]  saying jones doesn't like net neutrality he wants to get rid of internet freedom bull i'm against sopa
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.520]  i'm against syspa i'm against all these different forms of censorship misapplying copyright

[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:07.200]  neutrality we've had not have government quote be the guardian of net neutrality we need consumers
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.960]  to leave any company that tries to stop the flow of information over their networks
[01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:17.680]  and and and the claim that companies are losing money on video downloads they charge you for
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.760]  internet connection to make huge profits this has been the only growth sector in the u.s economy
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.960]  pretty much except for banking scams the last 20 years has been the tech economy has been the
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:34.160]  bandwidth internet telecommunications boom so we're going to be breaking that report down as well
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:41.440]  but i want to go to terry brian nathan britain ben and others right now i'm not going to belabor
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:46.160]  this anymore but some new listeners know what we're talking about there is an organization that
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:54.640]  says they represent some of the sandy hook victims family members called the honor new town group
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:02.160]  and they say their reason to exist is to bring awareness to hoaxer activity and to criminally
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:07.520]  and or civilly prosecute those who willingly and publicly defame harass and emotionally abuse the
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:12.080]  victims of high-profile tragedies and or the family members so you're not supposed to question any
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.720]  big high-profile event that's that's that's the new thought crime we intend to hold such abusers
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:22.000]  personally accountable for their actions whatever capacity the law allows coming up i'm going to
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.200]  play the report that they have filed a false copyright claim on and shut down because we
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:33.760]  showed the bbc news article and several others showing the man that founded this group son
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:40.880]  noah posner in pakistani rallies for dead children killed by al-qaeda bombs
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:49.440]  all we said was what's going on why are they showing this guy's kid over here and when the
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:55.600]  pakistanis are questioning whether those attacks even happen and there's no response except we're
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:04.320]  going to shut your website down you're not supposed to do that and this is how sopa and syspo you get
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.520]  three strikes on the internet not just on youtube or a google platform and you're off the web with
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:15.600]  a web id you're banned they give you three false claims that's it and this group's also saying
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:21.280]  you can't say the name of any of these children because they've copyrighted them you could say
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:27.040]  the name of anything you want as long as it's free speech it's copyrighted for the use in

[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:22.480]  me in the court of law and i live in a country where it seems like my service and sacrifice
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:29.920]  is being thrown out the window so there are several days where my my outlook can be negative
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:36.720]  but i wanted you to know that that i appreciate what you're doing and i myself am combating
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:45.760]  the negativity by posting videos working with my father's ministry golden harvest ministries and
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:52.000]  just trying to put out the good news the good gospel out there we're using youtube and i just

[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.520]  tide against the evil we need light in the darkness absolutely what do you make of these pushes
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:17.280]  why do you think they don't want us investigating sandy hook why do you think they've gone to the
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:22.480]  investigators homes criminal investigators law enforcement investigators and threaten them
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.960]  law enforcement retired people uh that are investigating this are being threatened at
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:34.000]  their homes by the feds the darkness anyone who walks in the darkness always shuns the light
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.440]  because they know that their deeds will be made manifest well i know this i hear you brother
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.240]  thank you for the call they do not want sandy hook investigated and i just can't believe how bold
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:52.320]  it is if if what some people are saying is true and i've been massively criticized uh for you know
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:56.320]  not going with the whole thing being staged you know in the first year or so but let's go back
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:02.880]  to that article by adan salazar i mean you've got undoubtedly the biggest wolf king how big
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:06.480]  former state police officer former customs officer he then over the next 20 years became
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.680]  the biggest school safety trainer in the country to major colleges you name it i mean he's the guy
[01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:15.520]  and he just said where are the helicopters being launched for the kids where's the
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.000]  the ambulance is where the the whole thing was disregarded and then they wouldn't let him into
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.040]  anything and acted very suspicious then they came to his house and threatened him i mean to get him
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:29.520]  back on you know the answer to this censorship is we're just going to redouble our efforts
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:35.760]  investigating sandy hook i got a rule man you try to shut me down i can be totally exhausted
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:40.400]  and some stalker does something to me or somebody does a dirty trick to my family
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.480]  and i just suddenly have incredible energy and i'm more creative and more hard fighting i've
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:49.120]  ever been that's just the human spirit everybody's got that instead of giving in when somebody
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:55.520]  attacks you use that to get angry i mean i'm as nice as pumpkin pie till somebody
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.560]  you know comes over and punches me upside the head and then you know katie bar the door
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:06.800]  because you just released a monster and i'm telling you right now the globalist are monsters and it
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:12.000]  takes monsters to defeat monsters so when i say a monster i mean just the strength of humanity
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:17.520]  we need to stop cowing down to these people and let them know we're not putting up with
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:24.320]  their bullying anymore terry in tennessee you're on the air welcome yeah how you doing alex i'm

[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:57.920]  together it's what we're based on yes it's the rock that formed this country and people need to
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:03.040]  remember that and when it comes to attacking our freedoms with the internet or anything else
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:09.760]  we hold the upper hand on that because we hold the money and if people just get angry cut your
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:16.400]  internet off for a month take the money away from them the businesses will straighten this out the

[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:29.440]  it out absolutely i mean look at where we're having victories it's where we vote with our dollars and
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:34.160]  our choices is where we really have the biggest effect that's our real power that's the vote we
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:42.480]  still got other than the cartridge box yes and you know it's time if any time was a time now is
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:48.960]  the time to take our country back we have to take it back for our children or there won't be a country
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.560]  for them i'm 58 years old i've seen too much stuff happening in my life well i agree with you brother
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:58.480]  but but you know i remember hearing my grandfathers talk like that and saying you know when you're a
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:02.800]  man and you got kids it's going to come well i'm a man i got children it's here i don't think we
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.560]  have to even wait for the lives of our children for this to hit them it's going to hit us it's
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:11.520]  hitting us now i mean they're getting more tyranny in place in a year than they would get in place
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:19.120]  in a previous 10 i mean they are moving fast and it's because they know people are waking up well
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:24.480]  yes people are waking up but we have to we have to strike back we have to start calling our congressman
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:31.360]  and telling them that they need to do their jobs and if they don't they won't have a job
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:38.080]  because there's people that can fill their shoes and we need to quit electing people because of the
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:44.160]  way they look and how rich they are because they're not in contact with us and that needs to stop that's
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:48.320]  right we need to find the people that have been elected locally that are honorable and have done
[01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.120]  a good job we need to support them and we need to run for office ourselves you're absolutely right

[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:55.520]  this is how totalitarianism comes always packaged for the children brian in alabama
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:02.800]  you're on the air go ahead hey alec really pleasure to be on um i'm what i do want to
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:08.240]  uh say that we are i was a part of one of those groups who did give you a lot of criticism
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.040]  on sandy hook because of what we saw blatantly saw that we just couldn't
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:21.920]  couldn't understand how you couldn't see them either uh we're a vacuum cleaner going in the
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:27.280]  background i'm sorry that is actually my fm transmitter rebroadcasting your broadcast oh
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:32.960]  that's awesome so you got a micro pirate or something i don't call uh i know i don't i don't
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:37.760]  i know it's a micro or a citizen broadcasting rig but then the general public doesn't know what
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:44.160]  that means so i say a micro pirate so that they understand the new term micro is what a pirate
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.560]  is and then we can elaborate on the fact that it's uh uh you're not interfering with commercial
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.520]  broadcasts and the airways along with the people uh but listen so you are a first amendment crusader
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:59.760]  i love the fact that every caller today is engaged in some type of media operation brian yes we're
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:05.440]  we're i'm also involved with independent media solidarity the group that put out the documentary
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:12.000]  we need to talk about sandy hook which was brought about by from another group known as the max
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.960]  resistance round table also over at max resistance well absolutely before we could even investigate
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.880]  it there were videos with tens of millions of views bringing up the anomalies there's been a real
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:25.200]  move to shut those folks down what do you think of us being censored what's been happening to you
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:33.760]  uh you if you i can tell you lots about lenny that this man is something that you've never
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:39.040]  seen before uh he's got a group of trolls and if you don't mind i'll just go ahead and call him out
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.960]  these people would be keep well listen hold on i don't want to give these people any attention
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:48.720]  i'm gonna have to get with lawyers on this and deal with this uh but but i understand that i mean
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:52.960]  if they're trying to shut us down when we're just investigating it and looking at all sides
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:58.720]  it must be horrible for folks out there uh that vehemently think this is staged uh so so just
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:06.000]  specifically what have you gone through it i can't even put up a video showing that he has
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:13.760]  put up a copyright strike against me without him copywriting striking that they have taken my
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:20.480]  information and they had they gave it to one of his trolls in his network and they went and they
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:28.320]  looked up all my information and put up a whole blog post about me and my daughter is what these
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:34.960]  troll network has done these people are vile and lenny if you're listening your day is coming my
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:40.720]  friend it is coming wow i mean this sounds like a war is going on i think they made a major mistake
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:46.960]  involving us because uh we were basically showing both sides and getting criticized by both groups
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:54.400]  for it oh i totally agree they don't know what they bit off go after them alex crush them well i mean
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:59.840]  i just wanted to leave the first amendment alone uh but i mean it does show that how would they claim
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:05.520]  it's a fox news copyright violation there's no fox news on there it's a news article i mean i mean
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:11.360]  how do you do that it's just it's it's amazing they have two different email addresses they use
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:16.960]  i noticed you said that uh for this claim they use the honor at gmail the other one that they use
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:22.240]  i won't say it but i'll tell you off air if you want to know what that one is off air well i just
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:27.040]  i'm not somebody to mess with and uh i understand that they can you know use children or whatever
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.040]  and then you know say the first amendment's bad but i mean i've got to defend the first amendment
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:35.280]  and it's just wild to get into this subject we got all this stuff happening worldwide all

[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:58.560]  did file it we're just giving them the benefit of the doubt this honor network this is the global
[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:05.920]  program to shut down free speech though okay it's not just the second amendment and i have had down
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:11.360]  in san antonio at our open carry event people come over and physically start pushing into me
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:16.240]  saying your free speech is hurting you know the death of my daughter uh who got killed by someone
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:20.960]  as if i shot their daughter when statistically the areas that don't have guns have the highest

[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:46.320]  it doesn't mean ford did it i mean this is just basic common sense but let's get away from info
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:52.080]  wars when we go to the calls i mean you're welcome to bring up this case it's that you've got so called
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:58.000]  net neutrality coming in the way obama packages it it sounds good but it's the takeover of the web
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.480]  just like he's gonna give you free healthcare by taking it over and it didn't free so they're lying
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:07.440]  on with labels and you've got congress having hearings we've got links to it on info wars.com
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:13.280]  where they're having hearings feds hold hearings on whether they should
[01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:21.760]  quote regulate sites like drudge info wars and others so after the fake sony hack that turned
[01:35:21.760 --> 01:35:28.160]  out to be an inside job we've now seen legislation reintroduced there uh to past cyber security that's
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:34.800]  basically sopa and syspa so it's all coming down right now so it's bigger than info wars i want to
[01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:41.280]  explain to you that this is about your freedom when you're getting your pension funds taken this is
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:47.760]  about your freedom to say no to obama care which is on the verge of being overturned we are really
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:51.920]  pushing back against the globalist right now all the metrics all the numbers show it so they're scared
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:58.400]  and the anti gunners are losing on every front so bloomberg and bill gates and warren buffett
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:04.240]  have given collectively hundreds of millions of dollars in the last election cycle to anti gunners
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:10.160]  try to unseat good sheriffs to try to politically put pressure on police chiefs that that are not
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:16.480]  criminals uh democratic police chiefs they're going after democratic sheriffs that these groups went
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:21.920]  after the travis county sheriff who's a black man and does a pretty darn good job i'm just mentioning
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:27.920]  he's black because they say he's racist because he will hand over to the feds this is all over the
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:32.960]  news here and they say it with baited breath oh i can't believe it he he deports up to 15
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:39.040]  illegals a week uh i mean he gives them to the feds they're aggravated felons
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:46.320]  he releases illegals that aren't aggravated felons which he shouldn't be doing he's a hero
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:52.480]  because usually they just release the felons and he's racist though though he's a black man
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:36:59.200]  i mean no no no no no the law says that he has to give them to the feds of their aggravated felon
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:04.880]  and that's where i live this coalition democratic party is trying to get rid of their own democratic
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:12.080]  sheriff i mean these people are authoritarian it's like the governor qualmo of new york last year
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:16.000]  said if your pro life or pro gun get out of the state people said are you serious you said yeah
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.760]  get out you're not welcome here you realize how authoritarian that is your pro life or your pro
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:29.200]  gun get out of the state i mean these people are out of control and now they file this copyright
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:34.560]  claim i mean we have their fox news footage when it's david night talking showing a bbc news
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:40.800]  article where one of the sandy hook kids is up there supposedly dead in a bombing
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:47.840]  so i'm going to go back to your calls but just analyzing this there's so many angles
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.080]  news director of informers nightly news rob dude you've hosted debates on this subject
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.720]  we've shown both sides we've been attacked for saying you know it might have happened as said
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:02.720]  but there's some anomalies we've been attacked for other reporters saying no i think you know this
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:08.240]  is staged uh clearly something staged uh so first off let me just ask you both point blank
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.840]  doing deep research on this last few years david night and then rob dude just briefly what is your
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:21.920]  view on sandy hook well that's a can of worms um i i think we're not getting the truth from day one
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:27.760]  we weren't getting the truth um and i suppose you don't believe ryan williams either oh yeah of course
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:33.360]  uh you know after interviewing how big a couple times having a debate with him watching that film
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:38.160]  that came out that was censored heavily uh that the that this coalition of people put together
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.160]  interviewed them right before that debate people should go watch that whole infowars nightly news
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.560]  i mean that's a lot of information on sandy hook a couple years after it happened we were coming
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:50.960]  up on the two years i wonder if they're going to censor that and take that down they might i mean
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:54.800]  we were we were talking about it we're not allowed to have two different guys on the debate exactly
[01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:59.840]  and one of them was a american free press writer who was friends with uh lennie posner and he's like
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:04.640]  i know him personally we're friends you know you guys are making a big mistake having wolfgang
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.040]  halbig on i said well why don't you debate him oh i love that i'm you're making a big mistake yeah
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:12.960]  and so so see we're not even supposed to have a debate right you're not in america and if you
[01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:18.800]  look at that debate the guy who was opposing halbig never offered any reason never responded
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:23.840]  to anything that he just attacked halbig had some very specific questions and the guy always just
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:28.000]  attacked how why didn't they call rescue helicopters exactly on and on and on yeah why were the
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.880]  ambulances not even at the school they were stuck at the firehouse why did they destroy
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:36.640]  why did they classify the investigation they've never done that with any previous shootings
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:40.640]  why did they knock down the school and just why did mary blendberg alert his people to get ready
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:45.920]  the day before for a big push yeah they made it a felony to release uh birth certificates or
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:51.360]  death certificate information what kind of country is that where you can't release birth certificate
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.080]  getting death certificate information i mean if there's you know what have you got to hide is
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.240]  they like to say to us you know what have you what are you so concerned about privacy what have
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:04.880]  you got to hide but it's only if you're going after one of their what looks i think it looks
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.440]  like an operation it looks like something went on there and a drill to high heaven stinks to high
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.240]  heaven you got the the actor father who comes out gets into character i was a theater major i
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:19.040]  worked with actors i used to watch them get ready before they would go out and cry like that
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.560]  i remember you have a degree in theater i was in the play our town and i'm sitting there watching
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.320]  these other people about to go out and do the funeral scene and they're they're pumping themselves
[01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:32.560]  up doing exactly what he did he first he's laughing and smiling and then and then he walks out and
[01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:36.960]  then he's and then he's totally sad crying he was cracking jokes right before that's an actor
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:42.320]  as an actor i'm sorry i thought you're not allowed to say that i mean ryan williams was
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:45.840]  shot down in that helicopter there it is right there he's smiling i mean he's he's he's just
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:51.840]  many hops and pops and gets and and that's what that that is a telltale sign of somebody acting
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:58.080]  right there now i don't know for a fact that this guy's an actor that looks like acting all the way
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:06.320]  it's just it's just amazing that they continue to really go after people i've got an article here
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:12.400]  from a guy i think was our last caller uh michael he's been he's been getting all kinds of grief
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:19.120]  from mr posner anything that comes out so social media shutdown due to sandy hook false copyrights
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:24.480]  what's interesting is they list the address for the honor network and bokeh rattan florida
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.240]  you look up the address on that which says 908 north dixie highway it is the address for a
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:38.320]  women's clothing store and a ups uhaul rental place uhaul neighborhood dealer so here here's the
[01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:44.000]  908 north dixie highway there is no suite but it's got two different buildings listed that address
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:50.480]  one is a j and jj shop women's clothing store and you go to the other one same address uhaul
[01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:56.960]  neighborhood dealer now you go to their uh about honor network go to this one right here guys you
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:01.440]  can leave the camera right there honor network right there uh it lists they're in connecticut
[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:07.360]  says they're in newtown connecticut but you go to that address it's a uhaul ups store i'm sorry it's
[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:14.000]  a ups store same address main street newtown connecticut it's a ups store so and then you look
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.120]  on their their website what are they pushing donate donate donate what do they push right after this
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.000]  donate donate they're millions of dollars people have given to sandy hook and the families they've
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.280]  gotten government money um the police department got like several million dollars just from the
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:34.160]  federal government alone just to deal with the grief so there's millions of dollars of money
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:37.840]  pouring into there you think you know if they had this organization they would have some sort of
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.840]  headquarters where they would be setting up a memorial we'll just start investigating that
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:45.280]  i guess i'm gonna have to probably go on up to new newtown i'm gonna have to probably go
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:49.680]  investigate florida as well and going back to that pakistani article where it shows uh
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:56.640]  the child's photograph from uh so it was on the bbc right even snopes the cat lady even agrees with
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:02.560]  us all right they say he's the ultimate authority ultimate authority even they say we're mostly
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:06.640]  mostly right on this even though they call us infobores but they are saying this is weird
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:12.000]  why is this kid's photo in with all these other kids photos and let's make the and it's not just
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.960]  one spot either it's it's it's the kids holding it there's a new listener in every minute pakistan
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:22.800]  terror bombings it's on bbc and a bunch of other places they're showing posters kid noa who reportedly
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.920]  died at the sandy hook event right in several locations and we're not supposed to ask that
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:32.240]  and then we get a guy on to debate it we're nice and he's like you guys are making a big mistake
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:38.640]  yeah the article that don put up he documented very clearly a lot of different pictures we had
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:44.640]  two pictures from uh the french press agency the big one as well as on their facebook there were
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:50.000]  at least two from the bbc there is a facebook page and the pakistan school there was a memorial
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:58.000]  wall in pakistan multiple sources so why is this and here's a question alec did they complain
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.160]  to the bbc did they complain to the french news agency saying your photo shopping are our kids
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:09.680]  photos into other stuff which is the basis of what this this honor organization is supposedly
[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.760]  uh talking about that they won't shut down anybody that misuses the images of their kids
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:18.480]  did they talk to the pakistanis about this did they talk to the french news agency to the bbc
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:26.000]  i'd like to know i doubt it and you made a point that that this is the same group going after bush
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:34.720]  master the um m4 manufacturer break that down yeah really if you look at this they're suing the the
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:39.200]  gun manufacturer saying that this is a gun that should never have been out there because it's a
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:43.680]  military weapon so it should never have been sold to civilians and they have their way all semi
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:48.560]  automatics will be shut shut down go ahead sorry but here's the bottom line this is a group that is
[01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:54.000]  going after the second amendment full and first i mean that's the first group that they sued there's
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.040]  10 families in this lawsuit against the gun manufacturer the two families finally sued the
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:05.440]  school system for uh negligence but 10 of them are going after the gun owners and they've set up a
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:10.800]  a uh they're on another website besides this one to just go after gun control so their focus has
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:15.840]  been gun control but when somebody has no respect for individual liberties on the second amendment
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:20.560]  they're going to have no respect for the first amendment either these people are authoritarians
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.960]  and they have no respect for the rule of law when you have a situation like this i'm sorry
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.680]  for sarah brady's loss when her her husband uh jim brady got shot that's not our fault that's not
[01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:33.120]  our fault the guy that was having dinner with the bushes the night before shot her husband in the head
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.640]  but if the way you deal with your grief is to go out and try to punish innocent people by taking
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:43.200]  their liberties if the way you try to deal with your grief is to go out and try to destroy the
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:48.000]  fundamental legal structure of our country for which people died to establish the fact that we
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.720]  have a had a country that was based on individual liberty you want to try to destroy the foundations
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:58.960]  of our country to try to go after innocent people's rights to try to make it worthwhile to try to make
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.680]  you feel better about your personal loss i'm sorry i have no respect for people like that well i mean
[01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:08.000]  i've got stacks of news here today i mean there's so much news i'll cover in the third hour and take
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:13.040]  calls it's just that this is a big deal because everywhere there's a tax on the first amendment
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:18.080]  right now let's i mean david speak to that i mean they're moving full force globally not just here
[01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.640]  zuckerberg met a month ago with the top communist chinese internet czar and said i'm learning how
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:29.840]  to censor and then and then he doesn't support building a house and near his backyard zuckerberg
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.160]  he's like all up in arms of this guy is going to build a house at well he also doesn't let people
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:41.280]  post post images of mohammed now on facebook though he says you know i am charlie i am spartagus
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:48.480]  i am charlie ebdo but no he's not they have bumped up the uh the cyber law that they were using to
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:52.640]  go after hackers they bumped that up they were had a lot of things that were misdemeanors they've
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.360]  now made felonies they've tried they want to invoke the rico statute against that they're coming back
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:03.360]  with syspa again they've got the trade treaties the transatlantic trans specific partnerships
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:08.240]  that are going to be used for copyright to shut down free speech that's one of the things that
[01:47:08.240 --> 01:47:13.280]  they're going to do with it so it's multiple ways that they're coming after us if you look at the
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.400]  you've got the f cc that is now saying that they want to control the internet of course they're
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.960]  going to come at it from the standpoint of net neutrality because they've taken a poll they found
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.600]  out the majority of people want net neutrality so they'll just call it net neutrality yeah they'll
[01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:32.160]  use that to get them they've been on both sides of this issue they want control of the internet
[01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:35.600]  that's what this is all about they could care less about net neutrality and they'll change it in a
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:39.680]  heartbeat if they want to but at the same time alex we've got a report coming out tomorrow on the
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:46.080]  nightly news about drones and we had a whistleblower send us a freedom of information request that he
[01:47:46.080 --> 01:47:51.600]  got they are coming the f a a is trying to shut down all private ownership of drones in the same
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.520]  way they want to keep you from taking pictures of buildings well i always said this would happen
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.720]  they're just saying remote control airplanes toys you name it and then i was out with buckley flying
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:05.920]  a drone with my son we got him for christmas it was like a 300 dollar one and i said i bet because
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:12.720]  this thing's gps controlled you have to program and get you know connected before it flies and
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:18.240]  stabilizers and i said i bet in the future buckley um in fact i want to do a whole report on this
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.200]  that it's pre-programmed that it can't fly by they already have it they already have it yeah and he
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:28.080]  goes oh no they just did an update with this company last week was in the news so it can't fly
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.080]  to the white house yeah it has thousands of other sites it's a so this is the pre-programming into
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:37.520]  our phones yes into our cars into all this quote smart tech to control and suppress us so they can
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:42.560]  have big giant drones surveilling us in little drones but then we can't have little drones
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:47.120]  for what we want to do they put a one and a half mile radius no fly zone into their firmware for
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.680]  the little drone and they said there's already a lot of other sensitive areas that are in there
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:57.120]  that you can't uh fly it near but see there i am saying i bet they do this yeah and it's already
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:01.760]  been done but the government is that to spy on farmers and that's okay because it's the government
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.240]  doesn't matter yeah you know does oh yeah the the bureau of land management only matters about what
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:10.560]  they're supposed to write so the m-wraps that they're handing out to all the the police department
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:17.040]  now they're using them as ambulances right right supposedly yeah the tank we come in peace just as
[01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:23.040]  they did that with the m-wraps they're now doing that with the predator drones giving them to not just
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:28.000]  homeland security but they're giving them to the bureau of land management which they admit they're
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:33.440]  using to surveil the farmers oh you built a barn you weren't supposed to oh you've got a wetland
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:38.640]  that's a puddle that's right see if they can find a mineral resource that you can get the senator
[01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:43.520]  like harry reid defense to a multinational corporation and then they can go onto your property
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:47.280]  and look for more detail to see if they can get you on some kind of an environmental regulation
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.600]  or something else where they can raise that gas can sitting out yeah give you excessive fines
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.160]  and basically take your property look at that pond in montana the guy built and the epa came in
[01:49:56.160 --> 01:50:02.480]  and started finding $75,000 per day and he didn't have any water that was crossing anything on his
[01:50:02.480 --> 01:50:06.800]  property it certainly didn't cross state lines so the epa shouldn't have been involved in the first
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:11.520]  place in my opinion as i read the constitution but it didn't even cross his property lines he dug
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:16.000]  out a hole put rainwater in it had a pond and they tried to find him 75,000 everybody does that
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  it's on the cattle pond yeah yeah yeah this guy had cleared it with these state and local people
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.680]  well you know that's why he got in trouble is that that's how with the database right you just
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:29.040]  got to do it but now they're going to have the database where they go out using these things
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:34.080]  that are truly drones because a true jone drone is totally autonomous it's not it will make the
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:37.600]  decisions that that's a new pond and this is what they're going to do with these vaccine things too
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.840]  where they they want you to opt out of the vaccine get your you know written permission your philosophical
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:46.000]  objection to it they're gonna use that as a roadmap of the persecution we're going right we know exactly

[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.480]  about the first amendment i do want to segue out of just what's happened to info wars because it's
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:43.520]  an ongoing thing where i showed that pennsylvania pittsburgh uh i guess gazette article where they
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:47.840]  had to retract that i told the guy to go kill three cops and i told him i'm gonna sue you
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:52.160]  we've got the computer now from the police you know the records he was on our website saying
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:56.640]  you wanted to come after me and get me he had nothing to do with me how dare you say that and
[01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.040]  so they had to retract so then when i put the article up that they retracted they did a copyright
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:05.200]  claim saying i can't show their article yeah i mean this is insane we're gonna write a bunch
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.720]  about you but then you can't show it uh this is an interesting article this guy was creating fake
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:16.400]  news and he wanted to get on your show actually uh that was his big uh goal with this thing called
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:19.360]  the jet setting terrace i don't even know if you looked at that but he wasn't successful he wasn't
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.560]  successful i think we somebody probably looked at it said oh this looks like bs and we passed on it
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:29.440]  and uh but it's just interesting how you know these guys are allowed to say whatever they want
[01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:34.800]  msnbc comes and says you're you're not making bombs you're making bombers which is even worse
[01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:38.400]  well what this guy wanted to do is like cast sunstein and drudges link to this article yeah
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:44.240]  how the left-wing activists manipulated the news to spread his message uh that's how they infiltrate
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:48.240]  alternative media to try to discredit it with this information right and paul watson is trying to
[01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:54.160]  police this as a one-man crew uh and he's doing a great job overall but i think sometimes he goes
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:57:00.560]  too extreme towards not questioning uh like the charlie ebdo i don't think that was staged but there
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:04.640]  was some evidence that was being manipulated uh paul doesn't think any of it was staged
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:09.120]  and i'm not attacking paul i'm saying i disagree with some of what he's doing he disagrees with
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:12.800]  some of what i'm doing people always ask me though why'd your reporters say this why they say that
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:18.240]  i try to hire smart people that are free thinkers that are researching things and then we're not
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:24.080]  all going to agree and why can't we ask a question out loud and go what about this and let other people
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:29.120]  debate it and and put their two scents in and then we just have an open society where we get to
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:33.440]  question things and go well maybe the sky isn't blue maybe it's actually green you know you know
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:39.120]  i want to invite this uh posner guy on before this this deteriorates because if he gets his back up
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:47.280]  and stuff yeah i mean i guess that's you know uh i'll be his huckleberry there you go night i've
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:50.880]  been ranting anything else you want to have before we go to break well i think it's interesting
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:55.040]  back in september you had wolf gang how big on and he was talking about the fact that the fbi
[01:57:55.040 --> 01:57:59.760]  reported that there were no murders in newtown and he said he called the fbi office and they said well
[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:04.640]  we were asked not to put that on our statistics and then they spun it like we made it up because the
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:09.440]  fbi responded later i mean we just you know there's a lot of stuff that is very very very
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:14.800]  suspicious about this and i gotta say that when it comes to 9 11 some of the most ardent people
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:19.040]  investigating the government's official stories are people who lost family members there because
[01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:23.200]  they want to get to the bottom of it and if they don't want to question some of these anomalies here
[01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.400]  if they just want to come after people who do investigation if they come after the company
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:32.960]  to sue them that makes me question the motives of the families because from the very beginning
[01:58:32.960 --> 01:58:37.200]  this looks fishy we also do they have no right to blame bushmaster for what happened i mean brain
[01:58:37.200 --> 01:58:41.280]  the fact that the guy was on drugs yeah i mean psychotropic's are directly linked the insert
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:46.800]  says it can make you mass murder third hour coming up if it was even a real guy maybe it was in easter
[01:58:46.800 --> 01:58:54.720]  bunny yeah when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula

[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want answers well so does he

[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:41.680]  ones funding it they're trying to shut us down we need your support we're just trying to be honest
[02:00:41.680 --> 02:00:45.440]  we're just trying to find the truth and the same folks that want to shut down the gun industry
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:48.800]  but that's really what this is they're coming after us david i think you crystallize it best
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:54.720]  oh yeah absolutely and who are these people exactly when you bloomberg sock profits exactly
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.120]  all of the families pretty much i don't know how many families but 10 families went after the gun
[02:00:59.120 --> 02:01:04.720]  company to sue them only two came after the school saying that uh there was no ambulances no
[02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:09.120]  helicopters much unheard of yeah that's unheard of exactly there's so many things and wolfgang
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:13.840]  how big to me has a lot of credibility because this is somebody who has a background in law
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:18.320]  enforcement he was a principal his company was advising major universities making a lot of money
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:22.560]  exactly the all over national tv why would he do this he was an investigator for school security
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:26.880]  he was a consultant he gave money to his handy hook he gave money to the victims because he felt
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:32.160]  bad about this and then he started asking a few questions and they started attacking him and when
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:36.400]  you start asking questions and you get attacked then you then you know you're you're near something
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:41.040]  you're near a source of fire somewhere yeah he was asking questions trying to get information
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:46.480]  about it and there were stonewalling him then he got uh the highway patrol in florida came to his
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.960]  front door and and threatening him saying that they'd been sent by uh people in in uh connecticut
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.320]  so to me he better watch it exactly and just we just put up the article said bad things will happen
[02:01:58.320 --> 02:02:03.120]  if you continue looking at and he's got some very good questions that deserve to be answered
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:06.880]  they're not answering those questions so like i said from the very beginning we knew that the
[02:02:06.880 --> 02:02:10.880]  government was going to use this as a springboard to attack the second amendment from the very
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:14.480]  beginning it looked like there were some fishy things about it so perhaps this was something
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.000]  that the government had had staged as a false flag perhaps there were people that were being
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:22.560]  controlled and that's aspect the question in my mind from the beginning was were the parents
[02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:26.880]  complicit i i didn't even ask that question because in the past we've seen situations like
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.800]  nine eleven there's never any question whether the people that were victims in the buildings
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:35.520]  were complicit in what had happened but in this one people started bringing that up and i pooped
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:40.320]  that initially but i tell you as things go on as we see these people try to shut down the second
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:44.560]  amendment try to shut down the first amendment i have to start asking what what's going on with
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:50.640]  these families i agree let's go to uh brenton i mean they've been threatened who knows uh brenton
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:56.880]  in minnesota you're on the air thanks for holding yeah hi alex um i discovered you five years ago
[02:02:56.880 --> 02:03:01.440]  and i've never looked back thank you for doing what you do thank you brother um you asked the
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:06.240]  uh you asked the question what why don't they want you looking into sandy hook i looked into this
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:10.880]  deeply a couple months ago i just really wanted to understand it i'm so glad that you're back on the
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:22.960]  case um this is a what i call a media manufactured event um the evidence is overwhelming it's almost
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:30.160]  it's so obvious that in my opinion i'm practicing my first amendment here uh it did not happen
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:37.840]  and i just challenge anyone to and are you going to say that that bill clinton uh never lied or
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:42.880]  are you going to say that brian williams didn't command a helicopter that took out 17 000 al-qaeda
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.200]  forces or that private lynch wasn't a hoax or pat tilman's murder wasn't a cover-up
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:53.360]  uh well you know i mean i i probably don't have time to go into all those but but i'll tell you
[02:03:53.360 --> 02:03:57.760]  it's so uh i mean sir it's a conspiracy theory you don't question brian williams he did it he
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:03.440]  commanded the helicopter he caught the rpg with his hand and threw it back at al-qaeda
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:10.480]  right and he took he had a can of spinach and he went i'm strong to the finish because i
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:17.280]  eat my spinach i'm pop by the sailor man sorry go ahead i'm gonna hold you over brother i'm i'm
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:24.640]  being silly here go ahead okay yeah uh sandy hook to me is uh it represents something it's uh it
[02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:31.920]  represents a watershed a potential watershed moment for to wake up a lot of people and that's
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.880]  what they're worried about oh i agree and this brian williams is is is that as well stay there i'm
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:40.960]  gonna come back and i have you finish your your point and we're gonna respond to that watershed
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:47.120]  event look they may have killed kids there but they got blue screens green screens they got kids
[02:04:47.120 --> 02:04:50.400]  going in circles they caught a guy in the woods they covered that up they didn't call in the
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:54.560]  helicopters they had the ambulance to sit there you know there's this whole schizophrenic group
[02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:58.000]  of things everything's actors but sometimes there are actors and it looks like that i mean
[02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:04.160]  the government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time the

[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:51.120]  key areas of resistance and they don't want to crush us too obviously because then that would
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:56.000]  make us martyrs they just want to kill us politically and sapis and death by a thousand cuts well
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:00.240]  we're still growing moving forward exponentially that's what we've entered the maximum danger zone

[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:23.680]  brenton uh and ferro and all these other folks and then i want to get into all the stories we
[02:10:23.680 --> 02:10:30.720]  haven't hit uh ground troops are necessary to defeat isis ron paul says it gives him basically
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:36.320]  worldwide war powers we're also going to get into just a whole bunch of news i'm going to race through
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.560]  with i got a big comment on that and to get your takes on that but right now we're talking about
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:44.960]  the full out assault the first amendment uh restricting the web in the name of net neutrality
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:50.800]  we support net neutrality but this isn't that with obama all this garbage uh but brenton
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:58.960]  finish up your point about sandy hook sure yeah it's my opinion they can't stand the slaves talking
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:04.160]  to each other and we talk to each other over the internet they can't control the narrative
[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:11.120]  and sandy hook is a blatant example of how they are manufacturing reality and all people have
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.560]  to do is just go look at the evidence it's overwhelming and once people come to that
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.560]  same conclusion that i did it's all over it is ridiculous i mean it looks like a school play
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:28.720]  it's so badly done and but maybe that's what reality looks like maybe reality looks totally
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:33.200]  fake of course in my experience it looks real yeah reality is crisp and real you know it when
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:38.800]  you see it and this comes off like a bad school play or obama's versa took it with multiple layers
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:43.680]  yeah and why did they publish that multiple layers and then say they hadn't and then use the
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:47.760]  typewriter function where where where all the letters are identical but they're just meant to
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:52.400]  look like typewriter we pointed that out and a year later top forensic experts said what we said
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:57.040]  we pointed out the day it came out too i remember i remember specifically bringing this up to you i
[02:11:57.040 --> 02:12:01.760]  said look one of our it was one of our ad guys took it apart and i said look it comes apart in all
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.960]  these layers boom we're in we actually broke that shooting that video million views over a million
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:13.440]  views now um same thing with uh our other video why people think sandy hook is a hoax i mean came
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:17.200]  out about a month later but looking at all the evidence and when the blue screen came out the
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:21.920]  green screen video and we added it up with all the other stuff where the mainstream media just says
[02:12:21.920 --> 02:12:24.320]  what we're not going to show you this right now because we don't know what you're going to see
[02:12:25.040 --> 02:12:28.720]  and we remember that off with that yeah that was we're not going to show you a sandy hook that they
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:33.040]  never done that before since we're not going to cut the cameras to this right because i guess they
[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:36.960]  hadn't got everybody lined up yet for the for the opening well no that was a different school
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:40.880]  shooting that and then that came out that was in houston yeah yeah and you're like look they're
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:43.360]  they just said we're not going to show you any of this live footage because we don't know what you
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.600]  might see and then we cover oklahoma city well they covered up a bunch of sandy hook too they come
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:53.520]  alive helicopter feed oh sure but i mean this video here it's uh it's a long it's a long video
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:59.680]  it's it's almost 20 minutes but it covers just the waterfront of things where it just looks
[02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:03.680]  all these different news events that and if they can shut down the alex jones channel and all
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.840]  the other channels that are connected yeah they'll shut down hundreds of these videos looking at this
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:10.960]  well and i think that's why they went after the little people first and they went and knocked
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:15.200]  them off because this was months ago back when the anniversary was happening we started talking
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:19.600]  about it again and we had that that uh the filmmakers on that made a couple of the filmmakers
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:24.720]  and we had the big debate and after that it kind of died down for a while but now it's picked up
[02:13:24.720 --> 02:13:28.400]  again i guess one of the trolls saw and all you were doing was talking about a news article yeah
[02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:33.520]  we weren't even showing video yeah that's what's so wild about this we're not supposed to even talk
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:37.920]  yeah we just have to sit here we're showing pictures from the bbc not our rich the main
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:43.360]  french news agency it's this is not showing pictures of what people have photoshopped
[02:13:43.360 --> 02:13:48.560]  on their facebook page uh these and no one's saying it's photoshopped no they just say we're
[02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:53.520]  showing fox news footage when we're showing a bbc news website right i mean it's just it's just
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:59.040]  it's a untrue filing oh by the way they they brought fox into it there was absolutely nothing
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:02.160]  in the article or what i had to say i gotta get my earpiece fixed i keep forgetting to tell the
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:07.120]  guys it just keeps popping out i think it's too tight whatever it's an ongoing issue uh i want
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:12.880]  to go back to the calls thank you so much uh brenton uh let's talk to ad in delaware ad you're on
[02:14:12.880 --> 02:14:19.120]  the air welcome hey alex uh you know i think people need to understand something we're involved in a
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:29.040]  heavy onslaught of dmf dlf mind control uh paul uh helier and dr h dr john h hall talk about this
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:35.040]  but you know these these crisis actors the same woman that is the lawyer for uh the guy homes there
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:40.720]  in aurora she's also involved in the uh boston bombing there i mean you look at the guy he's
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:45.760]  got his legs all sticking out he's the same guy that you know they i mean i could swear that i saw
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:52.240]  steven spielberg there but he had his legs shot off months earlier in iraq or afghanistan and there
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.440]  he is with his legs all sticking out and he's not even crying with perfect hair but you know what
[02:14:57.440 --> 02:15:02.080]  really bothers me is they're going to crush dissent and they're going to bring in the darkest days
[02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:08.640]  we've ever seen my big thing right now is following these dod contractors brown and boot
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:15.920]  and the banel group running heroin for the last god knows how long bush and shaney directly involved
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:21.680]  this is what they're afraid of because the truth is out there and believe me like you've always said
[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:26.320]  when you're over the target you're going to get the most flack and they're going to attack
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:32.400]  and i'm telling you we got to bring the info wars to the beltway my man well expanding on that uh
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:37.760]  they stage fast and furious to blame the second amendment that's just admitted came out cbs news
[02:15:37.760 --> 02:15:42.240]  got the documents not alex jones uh not drudge report not world and daily i mean that's just
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:47.360]  admitted it was to blame the second amendment so they do false flags and we know they had a drill
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:54.480]  in boston that day major uh issues with that and we know that they've used other drills before
[02:15:54.480 --> 02:16:01.520]  uh to basically simulate false flags that's an operation uh north woods uh but but you look
[02:16:02.160 --> 02:16:07.360]  at just the whole way this was rolled out the media was ready to pounce it was their big push
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:14.800]  but if you look at aurora that's what was really staged i mean this guy was in a secret government
[02:16:14.800 --> 02:16:22.400]  program in brain interface with darpa a literal mind control program his whole house was paid for
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:30.400]  uh they they they covered up what was in his house he the former head of the air force
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:35.440]  psychiatry department was transferred a year before and basically had notebooks with him and
[02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:41.200]  spent multiple days a week with him uh and then he was in the jail cell saying i'm been drugged
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:46.320]  i'm under mind control and then they lied and said no the inmates are wrong he wasn't in general
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:50.640]  area with him the first day but turned out he was and you just you look at that i mean well they
[02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:55.680]  found him in the apartment in the parking lot kind of babbling and warning people that his
[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:59.200]  apartment or his house was rigged up with explosives it's like where did he get the
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:02.240]  explosives where did he get all the training to do all this stuff this is a guy i don't know my
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:08.160]  college the the but alex you're talking about this fast and furious was set up to make a case
[02:17:08.160 --> 02:17:13.920]  that we needed to have a treaty a unarms trade treaty that would prohibit the crossing of arms
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:18.160]  over the border they were coming after the second amendment but that was specifically the point
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:23.840]  and i was i was in new york to cover this uh un thing uh where they're going to have the vote on
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:29.360]  the unarms trade treaty and it was a week before that was just not even a week it was the 20th and
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:34.320]  i think the uh the vote was scheduled on the 25th or something they they had this to try to get the
[02:17:34.320 --> 02:17:38.320]  narrative back because fast and furious had blown up in their face and so a matter of days before
[02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:43.440]  they're going to have this vote to do the unarms trade treaty they have this shooting in aurora
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:49.280]  colorado it was absolutely set up to to uh turn the narrative back to a gun control mentality
[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:54.080]  after it had blown up in their face no well that's it and and and then you look at at aurora
[02:17:54.880 --> 02:17:58.320]  and the things that came out of it they had a bunch of laws they were trying to pass and they did
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.280]  right at that time we've responded with recalls there but you can just see the timing see the
[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:08.560]  rollouts see how they've done this over and over again uh and then you've got the question you've
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.800]  got to look at this because these are known liars it's like brian williams you can't believe anything
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:17.200]  comes out of his mouth yeah well this system has been caught lying more times and brian williams is
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:23.680]  even twinkled in his eye i mean it's it's amazing uh ady thank you so much uh ferro in montana you're
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:32.400]  on the air Alex hey brother we really need to really brainwash people and to think guns in a
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:39.840]  totally different way a positive way yeah that's what the attorney general said yeah so sandy hook
[02:18:39.840 --> 02:18:45.840]  aurora shooting all these things are really affecting the consciousness the psyche of the
[02:18:45.840 --> 02:18:51.600]  general public in that way that they're meaning to the only way to fight against this is to spread
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:57.520]  awareness of this type of brainwashing it's meant to create perceived guilt that can then be placed
[02:18:57.520 --> 02:19:02.880]  on all of us like votes for obama carrier racist turn your guns in or you want to murder children
[02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:06.880]  i think it's backfiring though because you see all the pro gun people all the pro freedom people
[02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:10.400]  are closing ranks and going look we got to stick together we got to keep putting out this narrative
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:15.680]  that guns save people all the time and statistics show we're winning the fight for the hearts and
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:19.760]  minds so the globalists are still just going ahead with the anti-gun movement regardless
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:25.280]  call her what else do you want to get to well i've started a radio show in montana the intel
[02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:33.280]  scanner on mtradio.net anyone can tune into that we promote liberty freedom good this must be the day
[02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:36.720]  of plugs i don't i don't mind listeners plug in their media outlets i think that's great everybody
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.720]  should be an activist but i think like 80 percent of the callers today like plug their radio show
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:46.720]  that's awesome uh but what i really want to do is get your take on not just sandy hook sopa syspa
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:52.400]  so-called net neutrality the move why do you the internet kill switch is being announced

[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:53.440]  let's get a couple of well-spoken lovely ladies in here like lian and round off the whole broadcast
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:59.440]  that way let's go ahead and go to louis in massachusetts you're on the air thanks for calling
[02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:06.080]  hey how's it going alex good brother uh so first of all i just want to say thank you for
[02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:12.880]  saying the message earlier in the show i like that that's some interesting music huh yeah but
[02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:17.600]  anyways uh what i wanted to talk about is uh i went back and i watched your debate with pierce
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:24.320]  morgan and it's it's been like two years since that happened and um but i think i think now
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:28.960]  we're really beginning to see the model of controlling the debate uh being put into full
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:34.240]  effect you know um especially with uh political correctness you know i i think i think political
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:38.480]  correctness has gotten out of control alex i think you know we we got we really got to do
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:42.880]  something about that and notice they say you're hurtful questioning the official story so you
[02:25:42.880 --> 02:25:47.920]  need to be arrested and they say on their website you need to be shut down when you're not allowed
[02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:54.960]  to do that these are totalitarians in my view exactly and i i think uh they're using political
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:00.080]  correctness as a tool to uh to limit our free speech i mean i i think our i think that's how
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:04.800]  they're clamping down on a first amendment and then chopping it up is by is with political
[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:09.600]  correctness you know and you know because because by using political correctness they can dictate
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:16.400]  what we can and what we cannot talk about so yeah that's that's uh that's the point i wanted to make
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:20.080]  well they're moving right now los and that and if that's a question for the panel we'll go back
[02:26:20.080 --> 02:26:25.360]  to calls thank you los why do you think they're moving so quick right now i think you see this
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:32.000]  anytime you get a group that you know i like the democrats are these people that want to say or the
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.120]  left they want to create big government to control everything and the right seems to be like they
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:43.520]  just want to let let businesses be um more or less uh squeeze the little guy and let giant
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:49.200]  corporations run everything so you got these two factions going off and so anytime you get these
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:53.520]  left sides in they want to go after what you're saying because this happened in clinton and i
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.840]  remember it towards college at the end of college that's when i was in when clinton was in well you
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:01.440]  i couldn't write certain things in the paper they would squash stories so you can't say that that's
[02:27:01.440 --> 02:27:07.440]  that's not pc like what are you talking about not pc you know and it's their excuse to censor
[02:27:07.440 --> 02:27:12.320]  and control from a fake moral high ground david it's outrageous we need to call them on it we
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:18.320]  need to say that look there is real racism and it's too important to allow you to cry wolf so many
[02:27:18.320 --> 02:27:22.240]  times that that no longer becomes anything that we take and use it as a political weapon absolutely
[02:27:22.240 --> 02:27:27.200]  they use that and they also use the safety issue always telling us we have to be safe now the meme
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.920]  is that the internet is not safe free speech is not safe therefore they must be controlled
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:35.680]  therefore you must give up your liberty that's what we're seeing here with these bogus claims
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.120]  are being put out that's what we see with the legal structure that's coming through but you
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:43.760]  ask why are they accelerating everything i go back to the fourth turning by strauss and how
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:49.760]  there is a cycle in history i they think that they've discovered a certain kind of rhythm that you
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:54.080]  can see repeating over a certain period of time we know that the elites have been talking for a
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:59.120]  long time about how 2020 to 2025 was going to be when everything was going to change and we see
[02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:05.120]  of course with technological advances everything is accelerating and the technology
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:10.640]  is increasingly being used only for bad purposes just because you can build it doesn't mean you
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:14.400]  should in most cases but the people who are controlling the technology as eisenhower has
[02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:17.760]  warned us he warned us that the military was going to get it but he also warned us about
[02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:21.920]  the universities and when they only play the military quote he says a technological elite
[02:28:21.920 --> 02:28:26.160]  will rule us through the military industrial complex they will take over all research they
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:31.440]  will take over the university they will control the whole trajectory of humanity absolutely when
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:36.880]  we look at this foyer request that shows all the licenses that the faa gave out for unmanned aerial
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:42.800]  vehicles used domestically you can see a huge number of these are universities of course because
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:48.000]  they are rolling out the technology that's going to be used by the government i have a real problem
[02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.240]  everybody's got problems with these m reps that are being given to police departments i've got a
[02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:58.400]  problem with the fact that homeland security is using predator b drones which are called mq9 reaper
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:03.920]  hunter killer drones why do we have law enforcement buying those and using them here domestically
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:08.960]  find them domestically are we going to have some kind of a disposition matrix that's their euphemism

[02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:16.800]  that what they're putting this in place for i have a real problem with that as i have a problem with
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:21.920]  the the beer of land management getting the other kinds of drones that they can continuously fly
[02:29:21.920 --> 02:29:26.240]  and do very high resolution monitoring of what's on the ground so that as we talked about in the
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:32.720]  last segment so that they can go in and look for violations or look for resources that's right and
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:37.680]  notice when nimo and others wrote articles four or five years ago and this was just rolling out

[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:46.560]  just so many good ones get introduced i don't know what we did go through a dry spell though
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:51.120]  where we stopped doing contests for a while and i i wasn't complaining because those contests
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:54.800]  people don't realize how much work they take we got to do our regular job and then we have all this
[02:35:54.800 --> 02:35:59.200]  other information coming in that we got to sift through so but i do appreciate all the work people
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:03.840]  put out there and and the love that people have for freedom and information well if folks want to
[02:36:03.840 --> 02:36:09.040]  make little intro promos for the show uh and then just put them on your youtube put a message at the
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:12.880]  end that we're free to use it we'll air some of them here i mean we just yeah we don't have time
[02:36:12.880 --> 02:36:19.040]  to give folks all the ideas or tell you what to do it just hits a war uh i mean you know we see
[02:36:19.040 --> 02:36:23.760]  propaganda around here i've heard little birds go up themselves and spray paint the billboards
[02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:28.400]  yeah or used i'm not saying that's a good thing to do i mean they're putting cancer viruses in
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:32.720]  our vaccines we shouldn't go up on the vaccine signs saying vaccinate your baby and warn people
[02:36:32.720 --> 02:36:37.840]  right you should never do that and and like like you said the way everything's going into this
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:43.120]  government regulated technocracy that's the same way why all you see is doctors they're pro vaccine
[02:36:43.120 --> 02:36:47.840]  pro vaccine that's because they bully them into submission even though some polls show the majority
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:52.880]  are really concerned yeah they're concerned they they don't get the chance there's no venue for them
[02:36:52.880 --> 02:36:57.360]  to even question this stuff it's a very small network it's called like david tonight on the
[02:36:57.360 --> 02:37:01.920]  info wars nightly news we're going to be talking to a doctor who's part of an organization of doctors
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:07.440]  that as the american association for physicians and surgeons uh they are very much concerned
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:13.360]  about informed consent they want to see the patient uh doctor relationship to be
[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:19.920]  sacrosanct and free of any third party influences which is what obama care exactly turns doctors
[02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:24.880]  into robots exactly and so we we got away from the idea that we should have informed consent
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:28.960]  with obama care and now they're taking it to the next step saying you're not going to have any
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:34.080]  informed consent about what we do with inject with injections of vaccines that's the way this
[02:37:34.080 --> 02:37:37.840]  happens they roll it out they said well we're going to provide we don't want your informed consent
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:40.960]  and and we want you to get with us to take away the informed consent of other people so we can
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:47.680]  give you some free health care benefits and then they come after the people in terms of vaccines
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:51.920]  if they're going to define what health care is if they're going to quote unquote fund it
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:56.320]  they are going to define it and they are going to ram it down this is total social control this
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:00.560]  is the government running our lives i want to go to calls but i said i'd do a news blitz here so
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:05.120]  let's just let's just go through these big topics and get your take on them that there's
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:11.840]  probably 30 of them uh power that's the headline ground troops are necessary to defeat isis
[02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:16.320]  you can't do this by air everybody acknowledges that that's the u.s. ambassador united nation
[02:38:16.320 --> 02:38:23.760]  samantha power uh the warmonger here's another one obama's force authorization is a blank check
[02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:28.960]  for war worldwide the presidents were requesting congress to pass an authorization for the use
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:36.320]  of military force the aumf uh resolution against isis ron paul wrote this article it's on info
[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:41.040]  wars dot com he goes over and it's just unlimited war he's a dictator i mean they're just giving him
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:47.040]  dictatorial powers right now this morning when i was driving in uh mpr i monitor enemy transmissions
[02:38:47.040 --> 02:38:51.920]  every once in a while they're all for ground troops they always are but these people were
[02:38:51.920 --> 02:38:56.800]  against it when bush was doing it what's the difference yeah and now it's now it's humanitarian
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:02.720]  to go fight al qaeda right we're going to do with 500 000 instead of 200 000 i'm like what how how
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:06.720]  could you people sit there and say you were for you were against it when bush was doing it but
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:11.600]  now you're for it because obama wants to do it i mean it's just and it's it's Saudi arabian armies
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:18.240]  that are infesting iraq again and so we go attack iraq claiming we're saving iraq from the very
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:22.960]  free syrian army and that's what everybody was al qaeda we can't go into syria so we have to go back
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.760]  into iraq set up another base and then we'll launch operations into syria it will create a good rebel
[02:39:27.760 --> 02:39:31.600]  force to go attack syria exactly it's about creating the new islamic state you watch when
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:36.080]  they're done they're going to carve out a new third country between those two areas in syria
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:41.600]  eastern syria western iraq i mean that's the plan you called that about a year ago i think it's not
[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:45.520]  hard the enemy is very transparent and that's why i wish people would pay attention david your
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:49.760]  take on this well it's pretty transparent when we were fighting them wanting to go to war in syria
[02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:55.040]  we were talking about the sarin gas attacks and it's like look even the u.s military eventually
[02:39:55.040 --> 02:39:59.440]  came out and said you know first of all we can't say that that came from the syrian government and
[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:03.520]  we know that the rebels had that capability they were selling these false narratives about how
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:08.800]  our own military does not want to be that immoral and fight for al qaeda that's right that's got to
[02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:12.960]  freak out the system you'd already had you and observers you'd already had russian observers
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:17.520]  come in and say no that's not the case finally some people who are good people in the u.s military
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:21.760]  came out said that's not true and their whole narrative their whole case for going to war
[02:40:21.760 --> 02:40:27.120]  yet again in syria collapsed so then what did they do they they pull it together and they run into
[02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:32.560]  iraq and and now they've got a different war and now they're all in favor of that and the truth is
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:37.200]  we're doing all of this for saudi arabia oh yeah the worst people in the middle east well and the
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:41.760]  purge is going on continuously it's been going on for years in the military where the top generals
[02:40:41.760 --> 02:40:46.480]  are being replaced by guys who will follow orders these guys won't follow orders that we're showing
[02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:51.360]  up on screen right now i will not fight for al qaeda in syria but well now they'll fight quote
[02:40:51.920 --> 02:40:56.880]  ices but then they airdrop them weapons yeah i mean this is all fake ladies and gentlemen we
[02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:01.600]  didn't know we accidentally bombed the Kurds again talked about saudi arabia when they decided
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:06.240]  that they were going to maintain production in the face of falling demand globally and caused this
[02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.800]  drop that we've seen in oil prices they knew they were going to do that how much do you think they
[02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:15.920]  made selling the oil futures short how much do you think their buddies and the cia made
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.240]  selling oil futures short when they're their friends in the saudi kingdom told them hey you
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:26.960]  know what we're going to do so so good it's good to be king and i am effa announcers 17.5 billion
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:32.720]  bailout exactly what george soros asked for the southern london independent this is from legrin
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:37.600]  that wants people to work seven days a week when she's got swiss bank accounts on record and now
[02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:45.120]  17.5 billion to be given through fences right into people like the vice president's son who's there as
[02:41:45.120 --> 02:41:50.560]  a commissar looting the daylights out of these people how obvious is that here's another one congress
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:57.600]  ramps up another billion on top of 17 billion in lethal aid to ukraine to quote end the conflict
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:01.680]  now that will escalate the conflict with the russians i mean this is crazy yeah i don't think
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:06.240]  we've seen anything yet this has been going on it started off as this color revolution
[02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:12.000]  that we were documenting about a year and a half ago maybe even longer uh with the people starting
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:16.480]  to dissent against the government now the government's changed and now it's a pro west
[02:42:16.480 --> 02:42:22.960]  government and russia it's only going to get worse people are getting out a dog anybody that
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:27.360]  remembers the cuban missile crisis and i was a child and that happened only people how old i
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:33.040]  but they you know this is essentially the cuban missile crisis in reverse we're taking the weapons
[02:42:33.040 --> 02:42:37.200]  to their front door how do you think the russians are going to respond to this i mean they brought
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:42.160]  us to you know the cuban missile crisis brought us to the the verge of nuclear war once so now
[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:46.400]  these guys are basically doing it in reverse where we're the ones going right to their doorstep
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:49.280]  and of course the truth was in the cuban missile crisis the russians were horribly
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:55.360]  corrupted out of control commies but we had moved medium range missiles into turkey secretly
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:42:59.280]  and that's why the russians responded with moving nukes into cuba right and then
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:08.080]  kennedy secretly agreed to pull the missiles out of turkey and you make these provocative moves but
[02:43:08.080 --> 02:43:11.680]  i don't i don't see any secret agreements coming where they're going to pull anything back they've
[02:43:11.680 --> 02:43:16.960]  made these provocative moves and they're continuing to make provocative moves and basically the europeans
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:20.640]  are are pushing back and saying you're trying to start they're calling them on trying to start
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:25.360]  world war three nato is is ramping up all the armaments on in in uh eastern europe i mean
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:30.240]  they're getting ready for a bigger war they're not playing any games and this is a well let's
[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:37.280]  face it our our troops and others are fighting sheet dips spit snats who are in uh russian
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:41.680]  separatist uniforms and it's on record so i mean they're we're in a war with russia right now
[02:43:41.680 --> 02:43:46.720]  yeah yeah it's amazing is it going to get bigger and is it going to get uh nuclear
[02:43:49.440 --> 02:43:52.960]  well i tell you these people are out of their minds and you know all these feminists said if
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:57.440]  we just had women running things it's three women in the state department quarterbacking this whole
[02:43:57.440 --> 02:44:03.040]  deal i think they're hedging their bets because if you look at what happened by clinton right after
[02:44:03.040 --> 02:44:08.240]  the elections what did they do they came back republicans and democrats signed up the taxpayers
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:12.960]  to cover derivatives they're concerned about an economic collapse and that just happened a
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:17.520]  month ago yeah the derivatives insurance that they put us on the hook for yet again uh that they had
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:21.360]  removed and the debacle of 2008 they said never again we're not going to do that well they've
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:26.400]  done it again for an even larger amount that is hedging their bets and i think all the stuff
[02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:30.240]  that's going on with all these wars is hedging their bets if we have an economic collapse
[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:34.080]  they pull the trigger they've got everything in place they can start a war that means that
[02:44:34.080 --> 02:44:38.080]  everybody no longer is concerned with lynching the people who caused the economic collapse
[02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:43.280]  domestically but now we got the outslender we can you're going to be watching uh bombs hit buildings
[02:44:43.280 --> 02:44:47.920]  on tv and going look at the u.s a u.s a and then and then the younger kids which is i think why
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:52.960]  this american sniper movie came out too you're going to see a rise in people signing up for the
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:58.320]  fresh meat yeah absolutely let's shift gears net neutrality is a trojan horse virus infecting the
[02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:03.840]  internet and this is an article out of new american magazine and basically last week
[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:08.720]  tom wheeler chairman of the fcc published an op-ed piece and wired which laid out his strategy to
[02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:14.400]  ensure net neutrality by treating the internet as a public utility that's obama's plan and applying
[02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:18.400]  the same types of regulations that are used for phone electric companies so that you know he's
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:24.480]  flip-flopping constantly and and then the article breaks down the problems with that is this really
[02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:29.280]  net neutrality day tonight what's your view on this well i think we can see what's already happened
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:34.400]  with the f a a they went back to some ancient legislation and said hey we have authority
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:39.520]  over anything that's designed to fly through the air any kind of uh anything that's this and it's
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:43.360]  like oh so you're going to assert authority over model planes and when they first did it back in
[02:45:43.360 --> 02:45:49.920]  november they had four rules now one of those was a deal breaker but now they just came back this week
[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:55.760]  with 33 so initially they came out with just a few of these things and people okay that's the way
[02:45:55.760 --> 02:46:00.640]  the bureaucracy grows like a cancer and that's what you're going to see with the fcc once they
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:05.120]  establish their authority which is what the f a a was trying to do with those four rules
[02:46:05.120 --> 02:46:10.640]  saying you can't fly above 400 feet you can't do this the key one was that you had to be a licensed
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:16.080]  pilot licensed to fly a real plane in order to fly one of these model planes now once you let that
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:21.280]  stand they come back later on with 33 rules one of those is that okay you not only have to be
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:25.840]  a licensed pilot but you've got to have an observer watching the licensed pilot i mean it just gets
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:29.840]  and then they they regulate the speed at which the thing goes so there's no end to it we see that
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:33.760]  with every one of it's a robotic takeover of everything and then they create the hype of the
[02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:40.240]  drones well but pours out there civilian use the hype up problems you know when a intelligence
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:46.720]  operative who's drunk crashes at the white house all staged uh let's shift gears now into some of
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:53.760]  these subjects you can't make this type of stuff up irs to pay back refunds to illegal
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:59.040]  immigrants who didn't pay taxes washington times irs commissioner told congress on wednesday that
[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:04.000]  even illegal immigrants who didn't pay taxes will be able to claim back refunds once they get social
[02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:09.360]  security numbers under president obama's temporary deportation amnesty and then the irs also comes
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:14.000]  out this is an associated press and apologizes for seizing bank accounts of small businesses
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:20.240]  like hotdog stands and small diners that make you know under thousand dollar deposits every week
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:24.560]  even though they pay taxes on it they said that they said that was illegal and seized tens of
[02:47:24.560 --> 02:47:28.960]  thousands of bank accounts oh but now they're apologizing right did they give the money back
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:33.280]  yeah probably not you know you know we're going to keep this for administrative fees they're all
[02:47:33.280 --> 02:47:37.440]  give it to illegal aliens yeah we gotta give it to them they're doing this earned income tax
[02:47:37.440 --> 02:47:41.600]  credit and they're saying okay you're here we're going to give you amnesty so file some tax returns
[02:47:41.600 --> 02:47:47.040]  for some previous years and we'll give you an earned income tax credit too the irs is in the
[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:52.640]  communist manifesto the irs was set up in 1913 when we got the federal reserve it is an alien
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:58.080]  organization it doesn't have due process it's criminal and now the irs will not give you tax
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:03.920]  advice when you call them because it's written to screw whoever they want and then the tax agencies
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:07.520]  that are set up like turbo tax and asian are black don't even know what to do with any of these new
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:12.000]  rules they're confused as well and they say call the irs the irs says we won't tell you i mean that
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:18.320]  is cofa s where you're like what but how do i even comply years ago i covered a rally where
[02:48:18.320 --> 02:48:22.560]  a candidate was feeding going to feed the income tax code through a shredder to make the pointy
[02:48:22.560 --> 02:48:28.000]  one to get rid of the income tax they contacted then the irs multiple times and nobody could tell
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:32.800]  them even how many pages it was they don't even know how many pages they said of tax code they've
[02:48:32.800 --> 02:48:37.840]  got you've got they've established the precedent that we now see happening in all of these agencies
[02:48:37.840 --> 02:48:42.480]  where they go out and they write the law as unelected representatives they write the laws i
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:47.360]  call them regulations then they send their own people out as police then you go to their court
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:51.040]  not to a real court so they write the law they police the law and then they judge whether or
[02:48:51.040 --> 02:48:55.040]  not you're guilty of their law without really due process and that's happened now with all of the
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:59.520]  agencies it's not just the irs they're going criminal by design and announcing they're going
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:04.160]  to start grabbing ed people's education funds and taxing them and regulating them after tax
[02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:09.600]  i mean this we know how tyranny looks we got a really bad case of it people better get mobilized
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:15.040]  fast because it's only going to make it worse if we don't resist uh san francisco commuter is
[02:49:15.040 --> 02:49:19.840]  possibly exposed to measles no one's died they're hyping like the other world most these people
[02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:24.480]  are vaccinated no one says why are they getting it then if they're vaccinated and the hype is
[02:49:24.480 --> 02:49:28.800]  just accelerating what do you make of that you have to know two words safe and effective because
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:33.680]  that's all they say over and over again if the vaccines are safe and effective this is a total
[02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:40.560]  hoax i'm i'm doing a report today if i'm right after this i'm going to jump on it um between it
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:46.080]  was elizabeth warren talking to one of these cdc heads throwing softball question after softball
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:51.600]  question but it was just to put it on record that effect that you have to get your vaccines
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:55.760]  they're safe they say they don't cause any problems whatsoever no one's ever been damaged no one's
[02:49:55.760 --> 02:49:59.680]  ever been you could see the talking point how suddenly all over tv all over radio all over

[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:31.680]  you may get measles like symptoms i don't want to say that you can get measles but we know that you
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:36.000]  can get measles and you can transmit it as a vaccinated patient because that happened in 2011
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:41.200]  in new york that twice vaccinated person was patient zero and gave it to four others but i
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:45.520]  don't have to intellectually argue with you i could just call you racist yeah aren't i intellectual

[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:10.720]  broadcast as well here's a story uh out today of a san jose mercury news business section robot
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:19.280]  with empathy will add ability to learn from ibm's watson japanese mobile carrier south bank said
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:24.720]  tuesday it will incorporate artificial intelligence technology from ibm into its empathetic robot
[02:55:24.720 --> 02:55:34.640]  pepper well i wish uh so so oh oh oh its bioethics is from watson and watson is based on the previous
[02:55:34.640 --> 02:55:42.000]  watson hollerith computer named after the nazi watson thomas watson who ran the machines that
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.760]  would decide how long you were fed or lived in the death camps that's what the number was on your
[02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:51.840]  arm this is the machine now deciding the secret do not treat death list it's gonna say oh as it
[02:55:51.840 --> 02:55:58.800]  twists your head but it's loving it it's teaching the japanese uh robots that they're pioneering
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:05.440]  rolling out uh the the biomechanical uh systems are next but these are the mechanical systems
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:11.200]  here's the problem alex in engineering you don't take ethics classes i got a degree in
[02:56:11.200 --> 02:56:16.560]  engineering it was never a part of the curriculum so watson is a bio mechanic i mean i mean watson
[02:56:16.560 --> 02:56:23.440]  is a eugenical system it decides who to kill but they they don't even talk to the famous line from
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:29.840]  um uh Jurassic park you know where jeff goldblum or burg says uh bloom whatever says just because
[02:56:29.840 --> 02:56:35.120]  you can't build it doesn't mean you should okay they never addressed that in engineering
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:39.120]  as always just to know that's why they tried to quote blow holes in the atmosphere or detonate
[02:56:39.120 --> 02:56:43.360]  the atmosphere and they said we just want to see if we can burn the earth up so the pentagon
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:47.280]  detonated them in the upper atmosphere i mean why well because we're just gonna do it yeah the
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:53.760]  hatred collider can create a strange little black hole we're just gonna do it yeah well probability yeah next week hopefully
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:58.240]  we're going to have hugo de garis who wrote a book called the art elect war talking about how
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:05.520]  we very we're on the path he's kind of a different uh side of the ai community is very well known
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:10.720]  like ray Kurzweil but an unlike ray Kurzweil who sees this rosy scenario where he thinks he's going
[02:57:10.720 --> 02:57:16.960]  to become a machine he's taking i think a much more grounded uh look at this and says you know hey
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:22.480]  we may be very well creating the gods that are going to kill us well obviously because the elite
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:26.480]  believes they're going to become those gods you read deeper into Kurzweil he's a globalist yes
[02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:31.760]  eugenicists get rid of people model that's what bill joy warned us about at meetings he was with
[02:57:31.760 --> 02:57:39.520]  him you know 15 years ago in wired magazine and with the architecture of computers and the ai
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:44.960]  system is being designed to make us obsolete for the elite right so it's being designed to get rid
[02:57:44.960 --> 02:57:50.080]  of us on record and it's being tested on the uh the veterans right now it's going to be they're
[02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:56.080]  already brain shipping veterans to quote cure their p a ptsd and giving them vaccines where they
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.680]  quote aren't upset anymore and then they go commit suicide and you ask why is all this stuff coming
[02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:04.400]  together well they can see that they're going to be doing a lot of replacement of a lot of people
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:09.360]  in a lot of jobs if you've got 45 50 unemployment you don't need to have your derivative bubble
[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:13.360]  pop that's going to create an economic crisis right there and then you're going to need to have a war

[03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:28.240]  should be built around empowering humans while also having a good environment because that helps
[03:00:28.240 --> 03:00:33.040]  humans instead we're told just stand down hate yourself that's only because the elites want

[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:48.320]  the end of the year when you were talking about subjects that you thought would be good in 2015
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:57.840]  and it was in regards to you know the sandy hook um debacle and i talked about the movie
[03:02:57.840 --> 03:03:06.560]  run a rate jury in where they were suing the gun manufacturer and in that movie they actually did
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:13.680]  win the case against the gun manufacturer but it had nothing to do with confiscation of guns it was
[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:20.160]  all about money and getting the money out of the gun manufacturer but i still think there is something
[03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:30.320]  so off and strange about this whole sandy hook thing that you know it fades away it comes back
[03:03:30.320 --> 03:03:37.360]  it fades away it comes back that there's something and i can't put my finger on it i don't know what
[03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:44.000]  it is but there is something way off about everything about it well i mean just like look they had
[03:03:44.000 --> 03:03:50.720]  jerry brokheimer produced the saving private lynch deal i mean he was there on sat video it was all
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:56.400]  staged so they do produce this stuff they do and then five members of her team said it was fakes
[03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:01.280]  they killed them i mean they're not playing games and so of course we've got to look at this stuff
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:06.560]  and it could be staged uh very very good point thank you so much i'm sorry to cindy and mike and

[03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:35.120]  to be under the board or under the table nothing could just be brought out in the light we'd have
