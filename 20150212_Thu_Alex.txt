[00:00:05.492 --> 00:00:10.336]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.336 --> 00:00:11.917]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:13.479]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:17.662]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.725]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.898 --> 00:00:38.815]  Coming up at the bottom of the next hour, InfoWars Nightly News News Director Rob Doo and InfoWars Nightly News Anchor David Knight will be joining me in studio.
[00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:44.001]  There is an attempt to shut down a large venue that we reach.
[00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:47.063]  Let's be conservative.
[00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:48.604]  I say we reach 20 million people a week.
[00:00:48.604 --> 00:00:58.845]  It's way more than that on AM and FM, YouTube, and hundreds of other platforms, Boxee, Roku, Global Shortwave, the list goes on and on.
[00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:02.866]  But YouTube is 10% of that.
[00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:10.147]  And we get 5, 6, 7, 8 million views a week just on our one channel.
[00:01:10.147 --> 00:01:11.928]  Altogether, more than 10 million views a week.
[00:01:11.928 --> 00:01:13.308]  So see, I'm being very conservative.
[00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:23.018]  When I say 20 million listeners or viewers a week, because just on YouTube, just on our channels, it's 10 million.
[00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:28.381]  Our big channel has 474 million views.
[00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.503]  You add our other channels together, it's over 600 million.
[00:01:30.503 --> 00:01:34.305]  You add other channels that aren't ours together, it's over a billion.
[00:01:34.305 --> 00:01:36.446]  A billion views.
[00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:38.767]  Just since 2008.
[00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:43.110]  And when I got the Pennsylvania newspaper
[00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:55.733]  To do a retraction on a hit piece claiming that one of my listeners killed three cops when the guy was actually after me saying he wanted to get me.
[00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.993]  That's what was actually on his computer.
[00:01:57.993 --> 00:02:03.515]  He'd actually made threats towards us via his handle.
[00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:08.417]  When I forced a retraction in that major newspaper, Pittsburgh,
[00:02:09.875 --> 00:02:12.977]  We showed the article on screen and they did a copyright claim.
[00:02:12.977 --> 00:02:22.043]  Well, folks, I know copyright law, but any idiot knows you can show newspapers on television, you can show short clips of films to analyze them, you can show commercials and analyze them.
[00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:23.944]  It's total fair use.
[00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:26.906]  It's completely frivolous.
[00:02:26.906 --> 00:02:30.408]  And I had to go fight that and had to threaten lawsuits, you name it.
[00:02:30.408 --> 00:02:35.812]  Well, now the so-called Sandy Hook Defender Crusaders
[00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:50.515]  Have gone in and done a copyright claim off of showing BBC news articles, where in Pakistan, they clearly hold up the image of supposedly dead terror victim victims.
[00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:54.958]  And in there is the photo of one of the Sandy Hook dead.
[00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.240]  And so people reporting on it, we reported on the report.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.205]  So our report is a derivative report of somebody else's report, totally protected up one side and down the other.
[00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:07.086]  And they went in here.
[00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:20.101]  The Honor Network, Larry Posner, who reportedly lost his son at Sandy Hook, and then he says a Fox News claim.
[00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:23.462]  So it appears to be a completely fraudulent claim.
[00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:27.644]  Maybe someone posing as Lenny Posner did this as well.
[00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:30.524]  We could have posers of Posners.
[00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:31.665]  But they go on to say,
[00:03:34.904 --> 00:03:39.228]  Fox News, they claim, is the video that's a violation.
[00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:41.490]  There is no Fox News video.
[00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.232]  It is a news article with David Knight talking about it.
[00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:46.915]  We're putting it on screen right now.
[00:03:46.915 --> 00:03:48.336]  Imagine!
[00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:52.299]  And this group's reportedly trying to also copyright people's names.
[00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.043]  Well, you can do that, but you can only copyright it if someone's trying to use the name for sale of something.
[00:03:57.148 --> 00:03:57.308]  I don't
[00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:20.146]  PR people there.
[00:04:20.146 --> 00:04:21.887]  We didn't get the full story.
[00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:25.968]  And then now all these experts have come out and really shown that it's even worse than we thought.
[00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:27.868]  Certainly there's a cover-up.
[00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:35.150]  And we've had different investigators who get visited by the Feds and others and threaten to stop investigating.
[00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:43.473]  So, this is how they plan to take down the Internet with all these fake applications of copyright law.
[00:04:43.473 --> 00:04:44.533]  And we're not going to take it.
[00:04:45.854 --> 00:04:48.859]  I mean, I'll go to court, I'll file lawsuits, whatever.
[00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:52.484]  Anybody tries to shut down my free speech, you better get ready for a fight.
[00:04:52.484 --> 00:04:58.053]  Like I always say, I'm not looking for a fight, but you come up and legally punch me in the nose, you're gonna get it back.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:06.622]  For all of recorded history, civilizations around the world praised the health benefits of silver.

[00:06:29.687 --> 00:06:33.349]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.611]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:39.391]  Can you put two and two together?
[00:06:39.391 --> 00:06:44.734]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds.
[00:06:44.734 --> 00:06:47.255]  It's reasonably priced and fully legal.
[00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:48.396]  But for how long?
[00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:55.039]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.860]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[00:06:59.468 --> 00:07:02.853]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:07:02.853 --> 00:07:06.357]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:07:06.357 --> 00:07:12.445]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:07:12.445 --> 00:07:13.827]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:14.328]  I'm all about...
[00:07:14.468 --> 00:07:15.969]  The individual being empowered.
[00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:17.610]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.393]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:07:22.393 --> 00:07:26.997]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[00:07:26.997 --> 00:07:29.638]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[00:07:29.638 --> 00:07:31.840]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.681]  We're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:44.463]  The sale is only running for the month, 20% off and there's a lot of other powerful specials at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:49.264]  InfoWarsLife.com, celebrating human potential in the month of February.
[00:07:49.264 --> 00:07:53.765]  Visit InfoWarsLife.com to find this special and many others in the month of February.
[00:07:53.765 --> 00:07:56.345]  Again, InfoWarsLife.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:08:11.058 --> 00:08:15.430]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:16.854]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.406 --> 00:08:26.586]  My first amendment is under massive attack.
[00:08:26.586 --> 00:08:31.987]  And the attack we're seeing is the profile of censorship in the 21st century.
[00:08:52.861 --> 00:09:02.050]  So we're going to be breaking down an attempt to ban InfoWars and this news program from the Internet.
[00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:12.260]  And if these type of novel legal claims are successful, no one has free speech, including the right to speak, period.
[00:09:14.841 --> 00:09:26.050]  You've all heard about corporations like McDonald's and others that have sued the McDonald's family that has owned a tavern and castle for over 800 years in Scotland.
[00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.152]  They don't care that they lost the lawsuit.
[00:09:28.152 --> 00:09:31.254]  It's meant as a form of harassment.
[00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:37.179]  And you've all heard about corporations trying to copyright names where people can't speak them.
[00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:39.181]  Well, the courts have held that you can't do that.
[00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:40.422]  Disney and others have tried it.
[00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:50.730]  But they continue these activities, and this is under SOPA and CISPA and all these other systems, what they're trying to bring into place.
[00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:57.112]  So I'm going to get into all of this important news.
[00:09:57.112 --> 00:10:05.816]  We're going to get into Brian Williams and another key signpost on the death of the dinosaur media.
[00:10:05.816 --> 00:10:09.017]  We're going to be getting to that as well here today.
[00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:15.100]  We're going to get into an article out of the New American Magazine that I tend to agree with.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.201]  Net neutrality is a Trojan horse virus infecting the Internet.
[00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:22.861]  In this case, the antidote is worse than the poison.
[00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:25.162]  And see, things are subtle.
[00:10:25.162 --> 00:10:26.342]  Things are complex.
[00:10:26.342 --> 00:10:40.205]  I'm for net neutrality as it's been known, but now the FCC and others, as I've been warning, because I actually read what they've been putting out, want to take control of the Internet and start regulating it in the name of protecting it.
[00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.271]  So we're going to be breaking that down.
[00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:49.053]  It's where they play these games with definitions.
[00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:52.014]  Here's another issue when it comes to free speech.
[00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:53.374]  It's out of tech dirt.
[00:10:53.374 --> 00:11:00.397]  Police officers can sue newspaper for publishing descriptive info raising serious First Amendment issues.
[00:11:00.397 --> 00:11:07.220]  It seems likely this particular ruling is now likely to be cited against reporters quite a lot.
[00:11:08.502 --> 00:11:09.963]  Out of the Ninth Circuit Court.
[00:11:09.963 --> 00:11:12.605]  Very, very scary stuff.
[00:11:12.605 --> 00:11:18.770]  And we're not anti-police, but we have a right to film the police as long as we don't interfere with their activities.
[00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.412]  And we have a right to publish names of police.
[00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:23.434]  You're not secret agents.
[00:11:23.434 --> 00:11:27.137]  And you see Obama persecuting whistleblowers and reporters at every level.
[00:11:27.137 --> 00:11:29.779]  This is part of a reign of terror on free speech.
[00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:34.102]  And police want access to their First Amendment just like the general public does.
[00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:35.904]  We're all in this together.
[00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:37.305]  So it's a very dangerous trend.
[00:11:38.328 --> 00:11:44.710]  And at InfoWars, we try to post articles about positive things police are doing.
[00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:49.452]  Those articles really don't get read very much.
[00:11:49.452 --> 00:11:53.293]  And that's because the public has turned against the police in many areas of the country.
[00:11:53.293 --> 00:11:55.714]  And again, that's a complex globalist operation as well.
[00:11:56.761 --> 00:11:57.421]  A dialectic.
[00:11:57.421 --> 00:11:59.122]  I mean, we got two articles a day.
[00:11:59.122 --> 00:12:04.104]  We've got to report on this stuff when it's so brazen, so out of control.
[00:12:04.104 --> 00:12:06.225]  Indiana man visits family in Alabama.
[00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:09.087]  Cops paralyze him for walking around neighborhood.
[00:12:09.087 --> 00:12:10.627]  Here's another article.
[00:12:10.627 --> 00:12:12.688]  I guess Steve Watson's on the cop beat right now.
[00:12:12.688 --> 00:12:14.949]  He's been writing some positive articles as well.
[00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:18.371]  Cop shoots child for standing next to another child holding a toy gun.
[00:12:19.793 --> 00:12:26.356]  Yesterday there was a video of an unarmed little kid up on a balcony and the cop just pulls a gun on him and shoots him.
[00:12:26.356 --> 00:12:36.521]  So, I mean, you don't need to hire police officers with these psychological profiles that they're scared of their own shadow and are trained to be basically gunfighters who instinctively shoot.
[00:12:37.438 --> 00:12:47.961]  That might be great in a firefight with other, quote, professionals, but against the general public, it's just going to cause carnage and it's going to stimulate a lot of hatred towards the police.
[00:12:47.961 --> 00:12:55.983]  And the social engineers knew when they brought all this training in that it was going to cause a civil war, basically, a slow burn civil war in this country.
[00:12:55.983 --> 00:13:02.585]  But I'm already digressing into one of the things that really upsets me and really, really worries me.
[00:13:02.585 --> 00:13:03.965]  But that's coming up.
[00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:05.306]  There is a bunch of news.
[00:13:07.109 --> 00:13:14.032]  And Congress exploit a death to push for war in Syria and Iraq.
[00:13:14.032 --> 00:13:20.134]  We also have Obama trying to get a blank check war authorization obviously the last few days.
[00:13:20.134 --> 00:13:25.937]  And Ron Paul has come out and said that Obama's fourth authorization is a blank check for worldwide war.
[00:13:27.461 --> 00:13:30.264]  It's beyond the War Powers Act.
[00:13:30.264 --> 00:13:41.454]  It just gets crazier and crazier and crazier, the amount of dictatorial power this president's getting on open borders, on energy, on the Second Amendment, on defense.
[00:13:41.454 --> 00:13:50.382]  But the Republicans are going along with it because the same special interests that fund the Republican rhino leadership, the same people that wrote Obamacare, this is what they want.
[00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:55.753]  So Obama just puts a liberal, candy-coating front on it.
[00:13:55.753 --> 00:14:00.103]  He's also part African, so they can make it all about race, everything he's doing.
[00:14:01.636 --> 00:14:11.802]  When he's really bringing in global policies that massively increase taxes on Africans, cut off real aid, and it's just absolutely destroying Africa right now.
[00:14:11.802 --> 00:14:28.073]  And as a lot of our experts said before Obama got in, and as we break down an Obama deception, that Obama would basically invade Africa by employing and exporting radical Islamicists, importing them into the country, into the different nations.
[00:14:28.073 --> 00:14:29.774]  And you watch Obama deception,
[00:14:31.598 --> 00:14:37.319]  With, you know, 40-something million views on YouTube, almost 15 million just on one video alone.
[00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:39.820]  There's a bunch of versions.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.601]  Before Google Video took it down, they just got rid of Google Video, and we could get into the account and see it.
[00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:47.822]  It had another 20 million views on Google Video.
[00:14:47.822 --> 00:14:53.963]  I mean, that's a film that's been seen 60 million times on Google platforms alone.
[00:14:55.302 --> 00:15:21.348]  That just shows the power of the people and that shows why they're trying to censor us and that brings me into this topic that we will then basically recess on until the bottom of the next hour when Rob Dew, InfoWars Nightly News director and David Knight, InfoWars Nightly News co-anchor with Jakari and Leanne and others, he's going to be in here, they're going to be in here breaking down this.
[00:15:21.348 --> 00:15:23.389]  But let me just cover this right now.
[00:15:25.239 --> 00:15:34.542]  And just yesterday I was talking about how we had almost 500 million views on one channel, the Alex Jones Channel, since it was set up in February 11th, 2008.
[00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:45.325]  I was mentioning it was my birthday yesterday and then a fan had set it up for my birthday without me knowing years ago, Dave Thomas, so I mentioned they really want to shut this down, they're really trying.
[00:15:46.537 --> 00:16:00.366]  And I want to show TV viewers, I'll describe it for radio listeners, this copyright notification that, if successful, will take down the channel.
[00:16:00.366 --> 00:16:09.032]  And already we're not able to upload over 15 minute videos and are in what they call probation, guilty until proven innocent right now.
[00:16:09.032 --> 00:16:11.454]  And again, if they can do this to us, they can do it to anybody.
[00:16:13.644 --> 00:16:23.030]  And we're going to give you the name of the video as well that they are trying to censor.
[00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:26.653]  Mystery, Sandy Hook victim dies again in Pakistan.
[00:16:26.653 --> 00:16:34.357]  And I'm going to show you some of these photos from the BBC of people in Pakistan holding up photos of children they say were killed by terrorists.
[00:16:34.357 --> 00:16:36.359]  And it is one of the Sandy Hook victims.
[00:16:36.359 --> 00:16:40.261]  So we just said, man, what's going on in Pakistan?
[00:16:43.928 --> 00:16:45.809]  What are they faking?
[00:16:45.809 --> 00:17:01.113]  Well, the answer to that was the HONR, or Honor Network, Lenny Posner, who reportedly lost his son there, came in and filed a copyright claim on us showing a BBC News article.
[00:17:01.113 --> 00:17:02.293]  You can't do that.
[00:17:02.293 --> 00:17:04.114]  For those that don't know how copyright works,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.826]  I could show a clip off the news if I was analyzing it in commentary, but I could certainly show newspapers all day long.
[00:17:10.826 --> 00:17:12.167]  I've been doing this for 20 years.
[00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:13.369]  I took RTF.
[00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:14.970]  That was the first thing they taught us.
[00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.472]  I've had to sit in on lawyer meetings.
[00:17:16.472 --> 00:17:21.778]  I've been involved in lawsuits that we've won dealing with this, and I've countersued people.
[00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:22.859]  It's all on record.
[00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.381]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:25.842]  I know what I'm talking about on defamation.
[00:17:26.857 --> 00:17:31.740]  Knock on wood, we've never had that problem and other people have and have settled with us out of court twice.
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:40.106]  So I know of what I speak and you can't go to somebody's YouTube channel and say they showed a news article from the BBC.
[00:17:42.324 --> 00:17:56.326]  And then say that you can't show that because someone in Pakistan was holding up a photo of your son, who reportedly died at Sandy Hook, and they're saying that the same person died in a terror attack in Pakistan.
[00:17:56.326 --> 00:18:02.248]  Obviously, we've got to investigate this, just like we investigated Brian Williams and his claims.
[00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:05.148]  So, we're sorry for everybody's losses, whatever.
[00:18:05.148 --> 00:18:10.069]  We're investigating this, though, because we live in a system where the media exploits things and twists things.
[00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:14.576]  Paul Watson thinks the official story of Sandy Hook is true.
[00:18:14.576 --> 00:18:17.457]  He's my chief reporter.
[00:18:17.457 --> 00:18:21.699]  And we get major heat from the folks that think Sandy Hook was totally staged.
[00:18:21.699 --> 00:18:23.400]  Saying, why aren't you on the same page?
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.581]  Because we're investigating.
[00:18:25.581 --> 00:18:27.322]  I think there's some cover-ups there.
[00:18:27.322 --> 00:18:29.603]  I know they're using blue screens.
[00:18:29.603 --> 00:18:32.604]  I've seen the footage of people going in and out in circles in the building.
[00:18:32.604 --> 00:18:35.045]  It doesn't look right.
[00:18:35.045 --> 00:18:36.246]  It doesn't pass the smell test.
[00:18:38.699 --> 00:18:47.068]  There are literally hundreds of smoking guns here that this thing doesn't add up.
[00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:52.893]  Now, this group, and we're going to skip this network break because this is so important, because there won't be a show if stuff like this is successful.
[00:18:52.893 --> 00:18:54.475]  I mean, this is an attack on everybody's free speech.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:17.586]  This group, and I'm going to again show TV viewers, radio listeners can go to Infowars.com, type in the search engine mystery, Sandy Hook victim dies again, and see our screenshots of the BBC articles and others that show Mr. Posner's son that they're saying was a child killed in a terror attack a few months ago in Pakistan.
[00:19:17.586 --> 00:19:18.506]  This is January 2nd, 2015 article.
[00:19:25.134 --> 00:19:38.018]  And it goes on to say, among the alleged victims of the terror attack in Pakistan is the face of Noah Posner, one of the children supposedly killed in the December 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.
[00:19:38.018 --> 00:19:42.960]  And then it goes through to indeed show his picture.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:51.602]  And again, this is from the BBC, and we have a screenshot of them showing this, and we show two other news sources, two other.
[00:19:51.602 --> 00:19:53.003]  Here's BBC News World.
[00:19:54.042 --> 00:19:56.804]  And it shows again his photo there.
[00:19:56.804 --> 00:20:00.527]  I mean, who wouldn't point this out?
[00:20:00.527 --> 00:20:03.309]  I mean, is the Pakistan bombing fake?
[00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:06.451]  I mean, one of these two is fake.
[00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:21.623]  So the answer here is when top school safety experts that teach at a national level go and investigate, these people have been on the show, the feds and police show up at their house and threaten them to shut up and to stop investigating.
[00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:25.241]  They've sealed all the cases.
[00:20:25.241 --> 00:20:28.587]  They've torn down the school.
[00:20:28.587 --> 00:20:33.195]  So, we're not... I just want to tell this network of people something.
[00:20:33.195 --> 00:20:35.199]  I'll have to go to Sandy Hook.
[00:20:35.199 --> 00:20:36.481]  I'll have to get involved.
[00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:59.629]  I mean, you're just stirring up a hornet's nest here because my reporters just reported on this because it's a bizarre anomaly and needs to be looked into and now you're claiming that I violated copyright by showing screenshots of BBC News reports showing your son's photo being promoted as a victim of a terror attack in Pakistan.
[00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:06.693]  We have a long history of governments staging things that don't even happen.
[00:21:06.693 --> 00:21:09.315]  There are hundreds of false flags that are declassified.
[00:21:09.315 --> 00:21:16.221]  So it's normal to question Hillary when she says that she was shot at in Bosnia and then there's footage of it not happening.
[00:21:17.057 --> 00:21:18.999]  It's normal to question Brian Williams.
[00:21:18.999 --> 00:21:34.615]  It's normal to question Obama and to say, hey, there's death panels in this, and hey, you know, they got caught shipping guns into Mexico that killed thousands and killed dozens here to blame the Second Amendment, and it came out in memos that it was to blame the Second Amendment on CBS News.
[00:21:34.615 --> 00:21:40.141]  So in this type of environment, where Cy Hirsch has the headline, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner,
[00:21:41.345 --> 00:21:47.207]  The entire Bin Laden story of his death is not true.
[00:21:47.207 --> 00:21:52.369]  He said 100% not true.
[00:21:52.369 --> 00:21:54.529]  People say, well then what really happened?
[00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:58.571]  Well, we don't know, but the official story is not true.
[00:21:58.571 --> 00:21:59.671]  They didn't bury him at sea.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:03.000]  The sailors are on record that there was no ceremony.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.800]  They admitted that didn't happen.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.262]  There was no Situation Room video feed.
[00:22:06.262 --> 00:22:10.745]  They blew up the Navy SEALs on the ground, got rid of the ones they couldn't get rid of a month later, blew them up.
[00:22:10.745 --> 00:22:12.026]  I've had the Navy SEAL families on.
[00:22:12.026 --> 00:22:13.868]  I've talked to the Navy SEALs.
[00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:15.349]  I was the first to break it.
[00:22:15.349 --> 00:22:21.373]  I mean, we are just investigating a system that lies almost all the time.
[00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:22.714]  How do you know they're lying?
[00:22:22.714 --> 00:22:23.355]  Their lips are moving.
[00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:27.934]  And so I early on said, I can't believe that they would stage this.
[00:22:27.934 --> 00:22:29.194]  I'm sure they killed real children.
[00:22:29.194 --> 00:22:34.215]  You know, there are crazy people out there and another Prozac head.
[00:22:34.215 --> 00:22:37.396]  And then I got attacked by people that don't believe anything the system says.
[00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:40.957]  And quite frankly, I can't blame them.
[00:22:40.957 --> 00:22:42.137]  But that's not the issue.
[00:22:42.137 --> 00:22:47.058]  Whether you think Sandy Hook smells or you don't, whether you're
[00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:54.939]  Robb Due that thinks it's totally fake, or whether you're Paul Watson that thinks the story's true.
[00:22:54.939 --> 00:22:59.782]  These are both legitimate men who are smart who disagree in my operation.
[00:22:59.782 --> 00:23:02.064]  I still don't know exactly what happened.
[00:23:03.387 --> 00:23:10.709]  I mean, I knew 14 years ago that Saudi Arabia quarterbacked 9-11 because I interviewed the head of the visa section at the U.S.
[00:23:10.709 --> 00:23:14.051]  Embassy in Saudi Arabia in Riyadh.
[00:23:14.051 --> 00:23:16.051]  I talked to scores of experts.
[00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:22.673]  I read Colonel Schaeffer in the San Francisco Chronicle saying they were ordered to stand down.
[00:23:22.673 --> 00:23:26.935]  I talked to CFR people that said it was all staged and he was already dead.
[00:23:28.317 --> 00:23:34.761]  And then here we are 14 years later and they say there's 28 pages that says exactly that and that they're going to declassify it.
[00:23:34.761 --> 00:23:35.862]  I mean, I was proven right again.
[00:23:35.862 --> 00:23:39.024]  I don't know the whole story.
[00:23:39.024 --> 00:23:41.205]  I just know we're being lied to.
[00:23:41.205 --> 00:23:43.066]  It's like a police investigation.
[00:23:43.066 --> 00:23:44.087]  When you show up and...
[00:23:45.609 --> 00:23:47.590]  You say, is there anything going on?
[00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.392]  Anything in that back bedroom where you just heard some noises?
[00:23:49.392 --> 00:23:49.772]  No.
[00:23:49.772 --> 00:23:51.733]  You go in there and there's a woman tied up.
[00:23:51.733 --> 00:24:02.761]  Now, I don't know exactly how she got tied up or why she's got cuts all over, but I think the guy that came to the front door, who said nothing was going on, when the neighbors reported hearing somebody screaming, I think he's lying.
[00:24:02.761 --> 00:24:03.922]  Do I know the whole story?
[00:24:03.922 --> 00:24:05.283]  No, I don't know the whole story.
[00:24:05.283 --> 00:24:06.704]  But am I being lied to?
[00:24:06.704 --> 00:24:08.645]  Absolutely, I'm being lied to.
[00:24:08.645 --> 00:24:09.206]  Absolutely.
[00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:20.090]  And then my reporters simply say, look, here's the BBC and the London Telegraph and the Pakistani TV all showing this guy's reportedly dead son.
[00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:21.130]  May he rest in peace.
[00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.931]  We're sorry for that.
[00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:30.134]  And then this group comes and says that we violated their copyright and then claim Fox News.
[00:24:30.134 --> 00:24:35.776]  So they're using a Fox News ID to trigger the suspension of
[00:24:36.806 --> 00:24:45.087]  The Alex Jones Channel, that if they're successful, they will shut down videos, thousands of videos and reports, and millions of dollars of work.
[00:24:45.087 --> 00:24:50.388]  In fact, let's go to the About page on the Alex Jones Channel, one of many channels we have.
[00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:53.309]  And by the way, they're all linked together, so they take one down, they take them all down.
[00:24:53.309 --> 00:25:01.190]  Paul Watson's with 30-something million, another with 40-something million, another with 100 million, another with 475 million.
[00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.911]  And these videos continue to grow.
[00:25:05.387 --> 00:25:07.267]  There's about a million subscribers.
[00:25:07.267 --> 00:25:10.648]  950,000 plus subscribers on this one channel.
[00:25:10.648 --> 00:25:12.069]  474 million.
[00:25:12.069 --> 00:25:13.669]  And let's see how many videos.
[00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:14.689]  Let's back out on that.
[00:25:14.689 --> 00:25:18.450]  It should show the number of videos that we have on the channel.
[00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.451]  It used to, I guess they're removing that stuff.
[00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:24.211]  There are thousands of videos on that channel.
[00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:25.932]  Incredible work.
[00:25:25.932 --> 00:25:27.472]  Films.
[00:25:27.472 --> 00:25:29.073]  You name it.
[00:25:29.073 --> 00:25:31.473]  Things we've risked our lives to bring you.
[00:25:31.473 --> 00:25:34.714]  I mean, the incredible Bundy Ranch feds stand down.
[00:25:36.204 --> 00:25:59.188]  Interviews with world leaders, exclusive after exclusive after exclusive, and they want to come by and say that I'm a thief, that I've stolen their copyright, when it's us reporting on the news, showing the image of people holding up his son's picture in Pakistan, saying he was killed by Al Qaeda terrorists.
[00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:09.458]  Now if that isn't something, I mean, this would be like Brian Williams saying, I'm going to sue NBC because they're showing my picture.
[00:26:09.458 --> 00:26:18.026]  Or if we showed Brian Williams' picture and said, here is a known liar, and then, oh, our website shut down, we showed Brian Williams.
[00:26:18.026 --> 00:26:18.747]  You understand, folks?
[00:26:19.864 --> 00:26:21.445]  This is how they're applying it.
[00:26:21.445 --> 00:26:26.907]  Now, the only time you could do this is if I had a photo of his son and was using it for fundraising.
[00:26:26.907 --> 00:26:35.770]  Or if I had a photo of his poor son and I was selling tennis shoes with him as a spokesman.
[00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:37.591]  You can't do that for commercial purposes.
[00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:40.603]  But we're not in entertainment.
[00:26:40.603 --> 00:26:44.304]  This is not a entertainment venue.
[00:26:44.304 --> 00:26:51.725]  This is a hardcore news venue, completely protected under the First Amendment, and they know that.
[00:26:51.725 --> 00:26:53.406]  They know that.
[00:26:53.406 --> 00:27:05.968]  And this is the whole way, under SOPA and SISPA globally, where you get three claims, just like the Google model, by any company or individual that your website, your profile, your information
[00:27:07.307 --> 00:27:12.852]  violates their copyright or is hurtful to them under political correctness and so-called hate laws.
[00:27:12.852 --> 00:27:14.213]  No judge, no jury.
[00:27:14.213 --> 00:27:19.178]  You are banned from the internet with a new global internet ID number.
[00:27:19.178 --> 00:27:25.823]  The keyboards are coming out with this, the thumb printing to get into your iPhone, the internet kill switches, cell phone kill switches.
[00:27:25.823 --> 00:27:27.024]  It's all being announced.
[00:27:27.024 --> 00:27:28.786]  I told you about it 15 years ago.
[00:27:28.786 --> 00:27:33.070]  They're now telling you because they're getting ready to go operational and use it.
[00:27:34.631 --> 00:27:37.673]  England announced they're going to take control of the cars by remote control.
[00:27:37.673 --> 00:27:40.535]  You quote, your car is in danger.
[00:27:40.535 --> 00:27:42.236]  Oh, the robot's already in there.
[00:27:42.236 --> 00:27:44.077]  It's going to drive to keep you safe.
[00:27:44.077 --> 00:27:50.041]  The government literally activating the hacking boxes in the cars and rolling it out like it's a public service.
[00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:52.903]  And this is how they plan to kill free speech.
[00:27:55.848 --> 00:27:56.809]  Take Drudge Report.
[00:27:56.809 --> 00:28:07.975]  Drudge Report before has linked to a newspaper article sending them massive traffic at the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
[00:28:07.975 --> 00:28:10.737]  This happened five years ago.
[00:28:10.737 --> 00:28:14.699]  Sending millions of visitors to Las Vegas Review-Journal.
[00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:21.443]  And the Las Vegas Review-Journal used a cut-out company to sue Drudge and over 400 other groups, including us,
[00:28:24.465 --> 00:28:31.429]  Claiming that even linking to someone is copyright infringement when you're sending them a million plus visitors.
[00:28:31.429 --> 00:28:38.134]  Of course, that ended up getting defeated and the group involved with that basically got plucked.
[00:28:38.134 --> 00:28:41.156]  You can look into the whole Righthaven case if you want to see what happened with that.
[00:28:41.156 --> 00:28:43.257]  But I've been down these roads, folks.
[00:28:43.257 --> 00:28:45.058]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:53.103]  And they think because they can hold out some little kids and say, we're shutting people's websites down because they're belittling the memory of these children.
[00:28:53.103 --> 00:28:53.804]  No, we're not!
[00:28:54.994 --> 00:28:57.740]  But even if we were, you couldn't violate our First Amendment.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.203]  Because that's what it's there for.
[00:28:59.203 --> 00:29:01.227]  And if you take our rights, you take everybody's rights.
[00:29:01.227 --> 00:29:03.172]  I don't like what the Ku Klux Klan has to say.
[00:29:03.172 --> 00:29:04.114]  I don't like what the...
[00:29:06.027 --> 00:29:08.409]  New Black Panther Party has to say, but you know what?
[00:29:08.409 --> 00:29:09.730]  They got a right to say it.
[00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:10.631]  Well, guess what?
[00:29:10.631 --> 00:29:13.733]  We didn't say that your son didn't die there.
[00:29:13.733 --> 00:29:19.918]  We said, boy, why is this photo being shown at all these different rallies and all over the news as one of the dead?
[00:29:19.918 --> 00:29:22.260]  This is bizarre in Pakistan.
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:32.829]  And the response is to go in here and try to shut down our YouTube channels that continue to rack up over 10 million viewers a week.
[00:29:32.829 --> 00:29:33.570]  That's incredible.
[00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:34.831]  So, look,
[00:29:35.672 --> 00:29:43.155]  I have no other choice but to get the lawyers going here and go toe-to-toe.
[00:29:43.155 --> 00:29:45.155]  Because you're not going to run over our First Amendment.
[00:29:45.155 --> 00:29:45.816]  You understand that?
[00:29:45.816 --> 00:29:48.837]  You're not going to sacrifice our freedom.
[00:29:48.837 --> 00:29:50.217]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:52.758]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.758 --> 00:29:55.439]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:02.905]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[00:30:02.905 --> 00:30:06.410]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:12.499]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[00:30:12.499 --> 00:30:13.881]  I'm all about human potential.
[00:30:13.881 --> 00:30:16.024]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[00:30:16.104 --> 00:30:17.666]  The establishment is the opposite.
[00:30:17.666 --> 00:30:22.451]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[00:30:22.451 --> 00:30:27.055]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[00:33:15.777 --> 00:33:21.001]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:33:21.001 --> 00:33:26.966]  I don't want to be in your London afternoon.
[00:33:26.966 --> 00:33:32.150]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:38.716]  I don't want to be in your British hell.
[00:33:38.716 --> 00:33:41.218]  Ain't no misery in Britain.
[00:33:42.726 --> 00:33:44.928]  Hard to shut that voice down, huh?
[00:33:44.928 --> 00:33:46.749]  They'd like to lock us up?
[00:33:46.749 --> 00:33:48.590]  Kinda improvising there.
[00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:54.113]  Alright, I'm gonna stop butchering this misfit song, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:54.113 --> 00:33:57.095]  The First Amendment is there for everybody.
[00:34:12.307 --> 00:34:15.768]  It's there across the board.
[00:34:15.768 --> 00:34:21.050]  And there are similar laws in supposedly other free societies in Europe and other areas.
[00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:37.897]  But this reign of terror that's going on across the internet, misapplying copyright laws and saying that people can't videotape the police in public or that you can't
[00:34:39.927 --> 00:34:46.729]  Stand in front of a McDonald's, or in front of another franchise, and talk about them in run.
[00:34:46.729 --> 00:34:54.170]  Back when they were going down in Houston, with our reporters, but also with others, would say, you can't stand on the other side of the street and show our logo.
[00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:55.390]  It's copyright.
[00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:57.011]  They would have security guards come over to us.
[00:34:57.011 --> 00:34:57.751]  We've got video of this.
[00:34:57.751 --> 00:34:59.031]  Kevin Booth has it.
[00:34:59.031 --> 00:35:00.292]  We've played it many years ago.
[00:35:00.292 --> 00:35:01.352]  We probably find it.
[00:35:01.352 --> 00:35:03.872]  And they just say, you can't videotape here.
[00:35:03.872 --> 00:35:06.333]  This is our, this is our logo.
[00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:12.542]  And we're like, excuse us?
[00:35:12.542 --> 00:35:16.823]  The Federal Reserve!
[00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:29.546]  Aaron Dykes and Rob Jacobson wanted to get a faraway shot at about a half mile away at the World War I Memorial in Kansas City of the Federal Reserve Bank there.
[00:35:29.546 --> 00:35:34.988]  And here come armed security guards saying, turn your camera off and get out of here.
[00:35:34.988 --> 00:35:36.468]  You're basically violating our
[00:35:38.126 --> 00:35:40.068]  Our rights, by videotaping our building.
[00:35:40.068 --> 00:35:42.710]  We own that building, you can't videotape it.
[00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:52.778]  In fact, there have been federal cases where the NSA would tell people they couldn't sit a half mile away and get a shot of Fort Meade.
[00:35:52.778 --> 00:35:59.564]  We've had our reporters in San Antonio told, in a Walmart parking lot, because it was Jakari Jackson, that
[00:36:01.058 --> 00:36:07.083]  He couldn't videotape the new NSA facility as if it was a security risk, as if anybody couldn't go show that.
[00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:13.088]  This is an attempt to tell us that there's no free speech.
[00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:14.929]  And it's a big deal.
[00:36:14.929 --> 00:36:22.035]  And if we stop making it a big deal when this type of stuff happens, then we're going to lose all of our basic freedoms.
[00:36:22.035 --> 00:36:27.259]  If you're a TV viewer, we're actually showing our footage of where they were shooting the World War I memorial.
[00:36:27.259 --> 00:36:28.681]  The Federal Reserve is down the street.
[00:36:29.895 --> 00:36:39.077]  And the armed security guards, look at that, half a mile away, show up and say, give us your ID.
[00:36:39.077 --> 00:36:41.997]  And I've told the guys not to be confrontational, so they go ahead and give them their ID.
[00:36:41.997 --> 00:36:45.198]  And they say, well, we're just going to tell you to go or we're going to arrest you.
[00:36:45.198 --> 00:36:46.978]  And they start putting their hands on their guns.
[00:36:46.978 --> 00:36:49.378]  So our guys just left and let them violate the First Amendment.
[00:36:49.378 --> 00:36:56.420]  Then when the Kansas City Star called up the Federal Reserve, they said it wasn't real and it never happened.
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:57.700]  And that, of course, there's a First Amendment.
[00:36:58.763 --> 00:37:13.420]  So, this is the type of stuff that goes on, this is the type of stuff that happens, and if you don't get really upset about it and you don't take action, there's another article out today where they're in the news saying the FCC and Congress are going to have hearings on censoring the Drudge Report.
[00:37:14.355 --> 00:37:26.525]  And saying that his view on Obamacare or guns, that by linking the news articles, both pro and con, that it's political speech and that that can be regulated as if it's campaign finance.
[00:37:26.525 --> 00:37:31.769]  So they can lock Matt Grudge up or Alex Jones up like they did to Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:37:31.769 --> 00:37:42.178]  Dinesh D'Souza got nine months in a group home minimum security facility for getting five friends to give donations to his friend running for Senate.
[00:37:43.919 --> 00:37:48.722]  Talk about having dirt under your fingernails and going to prison while the government burns down the country.
[00:37:48.722 --> 00:37:52.465]  While the criminals running it loot us seven ways to Niagara Falls.
[00:37:52.465 --> 00:37:54.626]  I mean, this is crazy!
[00:37:54.626 --> 00:37:56.887]  Crazy!
[00:37:56.887 --> 00:38:05.633]  And so there is a sustained attack going on, and why don't they want us to talk about... There it is, FCC Commish.
[00:38:05.633 --> 00:38:08.275]  This is a massive power grab, government at its worst.
[00:38:12.042 --> 00:38:19.306]  Yeah, that's what's crazy is even the FCC admits that what Obama's bringing forward as new FCC regulations is a massive power grab.
[00:38:19.306 --> 00:38:25.589]  So even the FCC head is against it, but the rest of the board, part of the board is not.
[00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:30.352]  And then FCC will have to do what Congress says.
[00:38:30.352 --> 00:38:36.055]  Which is the way it's supposed to work, but Congress is just so traitorous, it's crazy.
[00:38:36.055 --> 00:38:40.738]  Now let me just finish up with this, and I'm going to give the number out and take your calls on this issue and a bunch of others.
[00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:46.800]  Are you worried about the state of the First Amendment?
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.581]  All over the country, they were arresting people for filming police.
[00:38:50.581 --> 00:38:55.002]  Now they're passing laws saying you can't put security cameras on your own property.
[00:38:55.002 --> 00:39:02.003]  That it's wiretapping while the government and Google and everybody else surveil everything we're doing illegally in many cases.
[00:39:02.003 --> 00:39:07.364]  They're saying we can't use these technologies to protect ourselves.
[00:39:07.364 --> 00:39:10.525]  The system is scared to death of their own big brother system.
[00:39:14.997 --> 00:39:16.138]  And it's not a monolith.
[00:39:16.138 --> 00:39:19.419]  Most people in the government are aware of what's happening and don't like it.
[00:39:19.419 --> 00:39:23.622]  But it doesn't matter because the people running it at the top are bad news.
[00:39:23.622 --> 00:39:31.226]  But we need to separate the bad guys at the top from the rank and file in government because they want us all fighting with each other.
[00:39:31.226 --> 00:39:32.286]  There's another headline.
[00:39:32.286 --> 00:39:36.248]  Dems on FCC move to regular internet campaigns, blogs, drudge.
[00:39:36.248 --> 00:39:38.509]  See more articles on that.
[00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:39.910]  That's for 2014.
[00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:43.292]  There's a new one out today because now they're having the hearings.
[00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.093]  And they're mentioning Drudge Report by name.
[00:39:48.093 --> 00:39:49.074]  People go, well, I don't care.
[00:39:49.074 --> 00:39:51.156]  You know, that guy's got a big website.
[00:39:51.156 --> 00:39:51.596]  I don't care.
[00:39:51.596 --> 00:39:52.617]  They take him down.
[00:39:52.617 --> 00:39:58.102]  I love this grassroots idea that if somebody else gets in trouble, it makes the world better for you.
[00:39:58.102 --> 00:40:04.728]  If they can shut down talk radio and if they can shut down the Drudge Report, they can shut everything down.
[00:40:04.728 --> 00:40:06.750]  They always go after the biggest dogs.
[00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.412]  I got a lot of problems with Rush Limbaugh.
[00:40:10.558 --> 00:40:26.103]  But, and I'm in direct competition with Rush Limbaugh, but when they were getting rid of his sponsors, I saw an opportunity to support the First Amendment and get advertising for about half off, and we made money running Obama deception ads on Drudge.
[00:40:26.103 --> 00:40:29.084]  We spent, what was it, $180,000, $200,000 running Obama deception ads on the Rush Limbaugh Show.
[00:40:39.875 --> 00:40:55.752]  And the weird thing was, Clear Channel called a separate premiere that syndicates it, and said, we'll let you run these ads, but we're afraid of campaign finance stuff, because it's against Obama, as if it's campaign finance to put a movie out showing how Obama's a big liar and a globalist.
[00:40:57.288 --> 00:41:09.215]  And so we had to announce that it was funded by Alex Jones at InfoWars.com, which I didn't even try to put my name in the ad because I think that's kind of creepy to go on somebody else's show and advertise yourself.
[00:41:09.215 --> 00:41:10.976]  So I was like, oh, throw me in that briar patch.
[00:41:10.976 --> 00:41:13.757]  Say it's Alex Jones and InfoWars.com.
[00:41:13.757 --> 00:41:14.918]  Thank you so much.
[00:41:14.918 --> 00:41:17.219]  Absolutely.
[00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:20.061]  But see, my instinct is a winner instinct.
[00:41:21.107 --> 00:41:27.070]  When they're trying, and they came close to getting Rush Limbaugh cancelled, like they did Dr. Laura Schlesinger.
[00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:29.411]  They came very close, folks, and a lot of people piled on.
[00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:31.852]  It was my idea, a lot of people piled on.
[00:41:31.852 --> 00:41:33.773]  I said, hey, you can buy advertising for less right now.
[00:41:33.773 --> 00:41:37.455]  I think it's overpriced most of the time, I'll be quite frank, on Limbaugh.
[00:41:38.123 --> 00:41:42.526]  And I said, right now you can get it for half off, that's not currently, now it's expensive as it ever was.
[00:41:42.526 --> 00:41:45.168]  And I said, everybody needs to pile on and buy up his advertising.
[00:41:45.168 --> 00:41:47.069]  That happened, his show sold out.
[00:41:47.069 --> 00:41:55.575]  They couldn't sell about 60% of the inventory, I was told at the time, when they were boycotting him, so I just came out and said, everybody should just spend money on Rush Limbaugh.
[00:41:55.575 --> 00:42:00.919]  Now, I wonder if they're ever trying to bring us down, and I put out an SOS, anybody come to my aid?
[00:42:00.919 --> 00:42:05.602]  Because here's the thing, if they can bring us down, ladies and gentlemen, they can bring you down!
[00:42:06.817 --> 00:42:07.958]  That's common sense!
[00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:11.301]  We hang together, we hang separate.
[00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:30.838]  If they were trying to shut down some liberal publication for garbage reasons, I would... If they had arrested Michael Moore for giving $50,000 in bundling, just like they charged Ken Lay with it and he finally got off because it wasn't illegal, DeSouza doesn't want to fight it for a decade and spend $4 million like, or plus, like Ken Lay did.
[00:42:32.452 --> 00:42:33.632]  Not Ken Lay.
[00:42:33.632 --> 00:42:36.333]  Ken Lay was horrible and ran off with Enron.
[00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:39.214]  Who's the guy that was the Republican leader out of Texas?
[00:42:39.214 --> 00:42:40.695]  I'm having one of those moments today.
[00:42:40.695 --> 00:42:45.496]  He was a congressman and they persecuted the living daylights out of him.
[00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:49.078]  And then he was found not guilty.
[00:42:49.078 --> 00:42:51.578]  Is it Tom DeLay?
[00:42:51.578 --> 00:42:53.639]  Tom DeLay.
[00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:56.100]  Yeah, okay, that's why I said Ken Lay.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.821]  I don't have teleprompters here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:57.821 --> 00:42:58.501]  It's just my memory.
[00:42:59.324 --> 00:43:04.709]  And sometimes the easiest names to remember are the hardest, as everybody knows.
[00:43:04.709 --> 00:43:08.832]  Now, I've spent a lot of time on this.
[00:43:08.832 --> 00:43:11.374]  I want to take your calls on First Amendment attacks.
[00:43:11.374 --> 00:43:13.696]  Where do you think the First Amendment free speech is going?
[00:43:13.696 --> 00:43:15.037]  What are you doing to defend it?
[00:43:15.037 --> 00:43:15.978]  800-259-9231.
[00:43:15.978 --> 00:43:16.078]  800-259-9231.
[00:43:16.078 --> 00:43:18.861]  The Observer, Drudge Report, is linked to this today.
[00:43:18.861 --> 00:43:19.181]  Out of England.
[00:43:27.352 --> 00:43:32.717]  has done a report and I'm in there about how mega viral InfoWars is and how we reach millions every day.
[00:43:32.717 --> 00:43:42.567]  I mean every day there's news articles about how viral we are consistently and how we can now more and more set news agenda and force things out there to be debated.
[00:43:42.567 --> 00:43:43.969]  The system does not like that.
[00:43:45.347 --> 00:43:47.228]  That's why they want to shut down talk radio.
[00:43:47.228 --> 00:43:48.828]  That's why they want to shut down the Drudge Report.
[00:43:48.828 --> 00:43:50.289]  That's why they want to shut down InfoWars.
[00:43:50.289 --> 00:43:52.550]  That's why they want to shut down WorldNetDaily.
[00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:56.552]  They've been behind the scenes and Joseph Ferrer doesn't really want me to talk about it.
[00:43:56.552 --> 00:44:03.655]  But harassing the living daylights out of them... You need to understand we're under attack.
[00:44:03.655 --> 00:44:05.935]  And that means you're under attack.
[00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:09.597]  And how you fight back against that is you realize we're winning.
[00:44:09.597 --> 00:44:14.299]  That's why we're under attack, ladies and gentlemen, because we're cleaning the globalist clocks right now.
[00:44:16.408 --> 00:44:17.830]  We don't work for special interests.
[00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.491]  Our special interest is the American people.
[00:44:19.491 --> 00:44:21.313]  Our special interest is what's honorable.
[00:44:21.313 --> 00:44:26.679]  Our special interest is when men were men and women were women and cars were fast.
[00:44:26.679 --> 00:44:27.901]  God, guts and guns.
[00:44:27.901 --> 00:44:29.242]  John Wayne.
[00:44:29.242 --> 00:44:30.664]  John Wayne and Ronald Reagan.
[00:44:30.664 --> 00:44:32.746]  It doesn't mean Ronald Reagan was perfect.
[00:44:32.746 --> 00:44:36.350]  It means what Ronald Reagan said, I absolutely agree with.
[00:44:38.203 --> 00:44:41.266]  The symbol, the idea is good.
[00:44:41.266 --> 00:44:43.127]  Just like the founders had some great ideas.
[00:44:43.127 --> 00:44:45.069]  Doesn't mean they ever realized one-tenth of it.
[00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:54.616]  Everybody wants to criticize Rand Paul because he's been political a little bit and moved a little more towards the center, so he has any chance of winning the presidency.
[00:44:54.616 --> 00:45:00.621]  He's out right now saying Hillary's involved with Al-Qaeda and ISIS and that it should be investigated.
[00:45:00.621 --> 00:45:03.184]  They better be checking his airplanes for bombs, folks.
[00:45:03.184 --> 00:45:05.886]  You know how ballsy that is?
[00:45:09.485 --> 00:45:14.248]  I can't imagine what Rand Paul goes through now at his level.
[00:45:14.248 --> 00:45:17.410]  I know some of the inside baseball, and let me tell you, it ain't fun.
[00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:20.892]  But we're here doing this because we care about freedom.
[00:45:20.892 --> 00:45:22.353]  We want you to get a fair shake.
[00:45:22.353 --> 00:45:24.775]  We want a fair shake.
[00:45:24.775 --> 00:45:27.056]  And I take these attacks as an opportunity.
[00:45:27.056 --> 00:45:28.857]  And this is just one that I'm mentioning.
[00:45:28.857 --> 00:45:33.761]  I mean, look at this fraudulently filed copyright claim.
[00:45:33.761 --> 00:45:35.101]  And it may not even be this group.
[00:45:35.101 --> 00:45:37.223]  It may be someone else fraudulently doing it in their name.
[00:45:38.522 --> 00:45:41.048]  Because I don't want to just sit here and say things about people.
[00:45:41.048 --> 00:45:42.973]  I want to be careful about it.
[00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:44.777]  But imagine, our website would be shut down.
[00:45:44.777 --> 00:45:48.486]  It says, photo of child killed at Sandy Hook shows of a Pakistan school shooting.
[00:45:51.994 --> 00:45:55.437]  I mean, we're not even saying in that headline that children weren't killed.
[00:45:55.437 --> 00:45:59.881]  We get criticized for trying to be open about this because we can't prove it one way or the other.
[00:45:59.881 --> 00:46:15.254]  So, they take down our video, photo of a child killed at Sandy Hook, shows a Pakistan school shooting, David Knight shows, we're going to show the video next hour, play it, BBC articles and BBC news stills and different rallies showing this guy's son, Lenny Posner.
[00:46:15.254 --> 00:46:18.577]  You'd think Lenny, if this is really him filing this from the Honor Network,
[00:46:21.144 --> 00:46:24.568]  Would want to know why they're showing his son in Pakistan.
[00:46:24.568 --> 00:46:25.969]  Why don't you call them?
[00:46:25.969 --> 00:46:27.311]  Why don't you call the BBC?
[00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:27.972]  Let me see.
[00:46:27.972 --> 00:46:36.381]  Did you put a copyright claim out on the BBC because they showed rallies showing your son's picture in Pakistan that was reportedly killed at Sandy Hook?
[00:46:39.502 --> 00:46:51.870]  I mean, that's what the Sandy Hookers, uh, you know, that are out there that are upset about people that see blue screens with CIA operative Anderson Cooper's nose disappearing and circles of people going in and out of the building.
[00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:53.351]  It looks like a Hollywood production.
[00:46:53.351 --> 00:46:57.033]  And then guys in the woods that are grabbed in camo and the media says they weren't there.
[00:46:57.033 --> 00:46:59.915]  It turns out they were, and they're an anti-terror force.
[00:46:59.915 --> 00:47:02.777]  I mean, and school experts say this is impossible.
[00:47:02.777 --> 00:47:06.239]  I mean, I don't know, for heaven's sakes.
[00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:08.200]  I'm sad for you, son.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:08.861]  Regardless.
[00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:14.367]  Whatever's going on here, but you want to get rid of our free speech.
[00:47:14.367 --> 00:47:17.588]  That's outrageous.
[00:47:17.588 --> 00:47:18.548]  And this is what they always push.
[00:47:18.548 --> 00:47:19.289]  Turn your guns in.
[00:47:19.289 --> 00:47:20.249]  It's for the children.
[00:47:20.249 --> 00:47:21.590]  Turn your First Amendment in.
[00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.831]  It's for the children.
[00:47:23.831 --> 00:47:34.075]  Don't ask why you have multiple videos of CNN reporters' noses disappearing, and you can see that it's a video in the background with the flowers blowing, where they then blow again from the same position.
[00:47:34.075 --> 00:47:35.956]  I mean, we got green screen here, folks.
[00:47:35.956 --> 00:47:37.196]  We know what it looks like.
[00:47:37.196 --> 00:47:38.297]  I run a TV studio.
[00:47:39.315 --> 00:47:41.356]  Twenty years on air, folks.
[00:47:41.356 --> 00:47:42.937]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:47:42.937 --> 00:47:44.638]  We don't know what's going on.
[00:47:44.638 --> 00:47:48.200]  We just know it doesn't look right.
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:57.465]  So frustrating.
[00:47:57.465 --> 00:47:59.346]  This is amazing.
[00:47:59.346 --> 00:48:03.349]  The claimant is the HONR Network, Lenny Posner.
[00:48:05.661 --> 00:48:09.643]  H-O-N-R network at gmail.com.
[00:48:09.643 --> 00:48:13.924]  Then they say the claimant is Fox.
[00:48:13.924 --> 00:48:15.945]  W-E-B-E-N enforcement.
[00:48:15.945 --> 00:48:18.946]  Web enforcement at fox.com.
[00:48:18.946 --> 00:48:22.027]  So television episode has no title.
[00:48:22.027 --> 00:48:27.710]  They don't claim what it is they showed that was theirs.
[00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.951]  So are they partnered with Fox in this fraud against the First Amendment?
[00:48:31.883 --> 00:48:40.028]  Or is someone else filing this and Posner's not involved and Fox isn't involved?
[00:48:40.028 --> 00:48:47.272]  So, there you go ladies and gentlemen, and if we try to upload this video today for you to see it, they'll hit us with more of these and take the channel down for sure.
[00:48:47.272 --> 00:48:53.836]  So until I've filed and stated that this is fraudulent, we won't even put this up on YouTube.
[00:48:55.782 --> 00:48:57.183]  That's the way these people operate.
[00:48:57.183 --> 00:49:12.374]  This is newsworthy that the Sandy Hook organization, one of the dominant organizations, and these families have been used to push gun control, you name it, is now not just going after the Second Amendment, they're now going after the First Amendment.
[00:49:12.374 --> 00:49:13.635]  What do you make of that?
[00:49:13.635 --> 00:49:17.718]  I mean, I guess, should I just shut up forever and just quit my show?
[00:49:17.718 --> 00:49:19.339]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:49:19.339 --> 00:49:20.640]  Or if I want to do a report on
[00:49:21.601 --> 00:49:23.662]  Wells Fargo Bank laundering drug money.
[00:49:23.662 --> 00:49:24.863]  That was in Bloomberg.
[00:49:24.863 --> 00:49:27.984]  If I go stand across the street from Wells Fargo, will they claim it?
[00:49:27.984 --> 00:49:34.367]  Oh, I had the Federal Reserve of San Antonio three years ago when we had an in-the-Fed rally out in front of it.
[00:49:34.367 --> 00:49:40.330]  I forgot, I had them claim a copyright, claiming that their building was their copyrighted material and I couldn't show it.
[00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:41.751]  Of course that was overturned.
[00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:43.792]  You people are out of your minds!
[00:49:46.084 --> 00:49:49.386]  We're gonna go to Mercedes, Brenton, Terry, Brian, Nathan, and others.
[00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:50.968]  I'll tell you this.
[00:49:50.968 --> 00:49:52.349]  The system wants us shut down.
[00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:56.392]  They're attacking us at every level because we are having a huge effect.
[00:49:56.392 --> 00:49:58.253]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[00:49:58.253 --> 00:50:00.735]  Send out links to the free podcast and videos.
[00:50:00.735 --> 00:50:02.936]  And appreciate everything that's out there.
[00:50:02.936 --> 00:50:07.179]  Because it may not be there tomorrow if we don't win this level of the fight.
[00:50:07.179 --> 00:50:11.803]  Because the system is coming in down with both feet against the First Amendment.
[00:50:11.803 --> 00:50:13.124]  And every other basic right as well.
[00:50:14.718 --> 00:50:16.446]  But it's the First Amendment for a reason.
[00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:18.294]  And the way you vote for the First Amendment...
[00:50:19.355 --> 00:50:26.081]  It's supporting it, defending it, spreading the word about those that are under attack, that tell the truth, and buying the products.

[00:50:41.674 --> 00:50:43.876]  All of us have to be walking billboards for liberty.

[00:51:58.928 --> 00:52:03.510]  When an emergency happens, you could be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:06.811]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[00:52:06.811 --> 00:52:12.214]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.

[00:53:51.785 --> 00:53:53.826]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:53:53.826 --> 00:53:55.727]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:20.345 --> 00:54:24.767]  The dinosaur media is in deep trouble.
[00:54:24.767 --> 00:54:29.029]  Ryan Williams leading the pack down the toilet.
[00:54:29.029 --> 00:54:39.674]  But if you go to this Honor Network that reportedly has filed this claim trying to take down our YouTube channel, they have taken down the video and suspended some of our rights while we're quote under investigation.
[00:54:41.038 --> 00:54:56.409]  They say on their website they will use every means necessary to shut down, to bring awareness to hoaxers' activity, and to criminally and or civilly prosecute those who wittingly and publicly defame, harass, and emotionally abuse the victims of high-profile tragedies.
[00:54:56.409 --> 00:54:58.811]  That means questioning any tragedy is abuse.
[00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:02.732]  And that's what they're pushing in the EU, where you can't criticize anything.
[00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:06.714]  No more free speech of high-profile tragedies and or family members.
[00:55:06.714 --> 00:55:12.557]  We intend to hold such abusers personally accountable for their actions in whatever capacity the law allows.
[00:55:12.557 --> 00:55:18.139]  Well, you better look into what happened to Righthaven and other groups that have gone down this road.
[00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:28.433]  I mean, I'm sorry that you don't want us to show BBC showing your son at rallies of dead children in Pakistan.
[00:55:28.433 --> 00:55:31.894]  We just are saying something's going on here.
[00:55:31.894 --> 00:55:46.639]  And we're sorry that the First Amendment is so upsetting, but we're going to be investigating this, we're going to be looking into this, we're going to be countering this, and we're going to be dealing with this.
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:56:00.606]  And I tell you, it has been just an ongoing issue that even amongst my own reporters, there's different views on this, and they're all well-balanced, researched, serious questions.
[00:56:00.606 --> 00:56:08.350]  Because we have a government and a corporate system that engages in hoax after hoax after hoax, so we have to look at everything as if it could be a hoax, and I'm sorry.
[00:56:09.264 --> 00:56:13.126]  But that's what happens when the system loses all credibility.
[00:56:13.126 --> 00:56:16.207]  I mean, look at these headlines right here out of the New York Times today.
[00:56:16.207 --> 00:56:17.928]  We're going to start the next hour and go right to your calls.
[00:56:25.945 --> 00:56:29.608]  Well, just sue or shut down anybody that says Ryan Williams' name.
[00:56:29.608 --> 00:56:31.210]  Copyright his name and no one's allowed to say it.
[00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:33.071]  Ryan Williams, $10.
[00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:33.992]  Ryan Williams, $20.
[00:56:33.992 --> 00:56:36.334]  Ryan Williams, $30.
[00:56:36.334 --> 00:56:37.735]  You can't do that.
[00:56:37.735 --> 00:56:41.718]  But now this group, the honor group, says they're copywriting names and we can't say them.
[00:56:41.718 --> 00:56:45.321]  I guess they'll go to our web providers and claim it.
[00:56:45.321 --> 00:56:46.783]  You're just going to get sued.
[00:56:46.783 --> 00:56:48.444]  You're going to lose.
[00:56:48.444 --> 00:56:49.285]  There's no debating it.
[00:56:51.423 --> 00:56:55.746]  I've got course of action right now if this group stands up and says indeed they did this.
[00:56:55.746 --> 00:56:57.827]  I don't want to do that.
[00:56:57.827 --> 00:57:01.669]  Just like Jesse Ventura didn't want to go after Chris Kyle and win in court.
[00:57:01.669 --> 00:57:05.351]  But we got you.
[00:57:05.351 --> 00:57:13.796]  And you want to attack us for saying it's a hoax when our reporters are investigating it and are on two different ends of the spectrum?
[00:57:13.796 --> 00:57:17.058]  We are allowed to investigate and we will investigate.
[00:57:17.058 --> 00:57:19.319]  The question is why don't you want this investigated?
[00:57:21.428 --> 00:57:26.671]  Within NBC, an intense debate over whether to fire Brian Williams, Washington Post.
[00:57:26.671 --> 00:57:34.635]  Why some in NBC view Brian Williams' suspension as an exit strategy.
[00:57:34.635 --> 00:57:40.218]  Global cooling makes the East some of the best snowing on record, North Jersey reports.
[00:57:40.218 --> 00:57:43.640]  Matt Al Gore said they'd be snow free by last year.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.422]  The New York Times said that as well in the East.
[00:57:46.422 --> 00:57:46.902]  Snow free!
[00:57:48.303 --> 00:57:49.564]  Mm-hmm.
[00:57:49.564 --> 00:57:54.087]  I guess I'm hurting Al Gore talking bad about him.
[00:57:54.087 --> 00:57:55.929]  I shouldn't do that.
[00:57:55.929 --> 00:57:57.950]  Better shut this video down, too.
[00:57:57.950 --> 00:58:00.792]  Shouldn't call Al Gore a big fat liar.
[00:58:00.792 --> 00:58:08.038]  See, if Al Gore wants to go sue me and prove that he's not a big fat liar in defamation, go ahead and do it, buddy.
[00:58:08.038 --> 00:58:09.359]  I've done it twice before and won.
[00:58:15.256 --> 00:58:18.539]  Not because I like to sue people, but because sometimes it has to be done.
[00:58:18.539 --> 00:58:23.943]  I never got around to suing MSNBC for saying that I influenced the Boston Bombers.
[00:58:23.943 --> 00:58:24.483]  But you know what?
[00:58:24.483 --> 00:58:27.926]  They're so discredited, that's just a badge of honor that they did that.
[00:58:27.926 --> 00:58:36.533]  Alright, we'll also get to this war authorization for Obama, that Ron Paul says is a blank check for war worldwide, and a lot more.
[00:58:36.533 --> 00:58:41.617]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.617 --> 00:58:42.838]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:44.403 --> 00:58:49.445]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:49.445 --> 00:58:58.328]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[00:58:58.328 --> 00:59:04.910]  NASA has already set the countdown timer, and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:08.932]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[00:59:08.932 --> 00:59:10.573]  population could perish.
[00:59:10.573 --> 00:59:14.036]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[00:59:14.036 --> 00:59:16.297]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[00:59:16.297 --> 00:59:17.938]  Mass riots will follow.
[00:59:17.938 --> 00:59:20.100]  Ancient diseases will reemerge.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:24.202]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[00:59:24.202 --> 00:59:29.866]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[00:59:30.126 --> 00:59:31.247]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:05.475 --> 01:00:10.320]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.902]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.902 --> 01:00:13.444]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.444 --> 01:00:17.648]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:21.692]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.313 --> 01:00:25.595]  Some stations don't care the first hour, so I'm going to briefly recap this.
[01:00:25.595 --> 01:00:30.678]  Start taking your phone calls on the larger issue of free speech and how they're attacking it.
[01:00:30.678 --> 01:00:39.463]  I'm going to be getting into the FCC hearings, what Obama wants to do to, quote, defend net neutrality that actually takes over the internet.
[01:00:39.463 --> 01:00:47.247]  Some other hoax where they're claiming we're now anti-net neutrality because we oppose Obama's plans to, quote, protect net neutrality by regulating it and controlling it.
[01:00:47.247 --> 01:00:49.968]  Another bait and switch.
[01:00:49.968 --> 01:00:50.809]  We're going to get into
[01:00:52.526 --> 01:00:54.667]  A bunch of First Amendment issues in this hour.
[01:00:54.667 --> 01:01:01.568]  Now it ties into the media wars that are going on.
[01:01:01.568 --> 01:01:07.110]  We've got more measles news, we've got a bunch of politics news, science news, economy news, world news.
[01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:07.890]  It's all coming up.
[01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:11.991]  But right now, I'll just, I'll recap in the next segment.
[01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:15.812]  We just have a copyright claim by one of the largest Sandy Hook groups.
[01:01:18.013 --> 01:01:30.322]  Um, claiming that we can't show a clip, just a screenshot of a BBC report and other newspapers showing one of the reported dead of Sandy Hook as one of the dead in a terrorist attack.
[01:01:30.322 --> 01:01:33.664]  And it is the same photo, it is the child.
[01:01:33.664 --> 01:01:36.467]  And we didn't say his kid wasn't killed.
[01:01:36.467 --> 01:01:38.928]  And they came in and they're trying to take our YouTube channel down.
[01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.070]  This is a big deal, folks.
[01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:42.171]  Again, that'd be like saying
[01:01:43.593 --> 01:01:47.436]  I couldn't stand in front of a McDonald's on the city street and shoot a video report.
[01:01:47.436 --> 01:01:51.279]  McDonald's would claim a copyright claim because I showed the golden arches.
[01:01:51.279 --> 01:01:57.665]  I can't put a golden arches up over my business as a trademark and sell goods under the golden arches.
[01:01:57.665 --> 01:02:02.569]  So yes, they could get me for copyright if I was selling stuff based off his son's image.
[01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:03.549]  We're not.
[01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:07.052]  We're reporting on another news report.
[01:02:07.052 --> 01:02:08.453]  That's crazy!
[01:02:08.453 --> 01:02:11.056]  I mean, it's just absolutely cut and dry, indefensible,
[01:02:11.983 --> 01:02:15.965]  And they've said on their site they do it to shut down people's speech.
[01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:21.167]  So then in a court, that would show malice of forethought to shut down the First Amendment.
[01:02:21.167 --> 01:02:27.531]  That's a civil rights violation.
[01:02:27.531 --> 01:02:31.733]  So you better talk to your lawyers over there at your honor network.
[01:02:31.733 --> 01:02:33.613]  Or maybe they don't care.
[01:02:33.613 --> 01:02:37.855]  Maybe they think everybody's ignorant and dumb out there and you can just run around doing stuff like this.
[01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:38.736]  We're not going to put up with it.
[01:02:39.753 --> 01:02:41.814]  I know I'm making a big deal out of it because it is a big deal.
[01:02:41.814 --> 01:02:45.695]  Mercedes in Oregon, you're on the air, thanks for calling.
[01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:49.317]  Yes, happy birthday.
[01:02:49.317 --> 01:02:52.598]  It was my birthday as well, a few days before yours.
[01:02:52.598 --> 01:02:56.100]  Well thank you, that's very sweet of you.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:59.001]  Yes, we're doing awesomely.
[01:02:59.001 --> 01:03:02.823]  I also host a news program that I started this year.
[01:03:02.823 --> 01:03:02.903]  Good.
[01:03:04.125 --> 01:03:06.106]  Uh, you know, because you inspired me.
[01:03:06.106 --> 01:03:07.467]  Awesome.
[01:03:07.467 --> 01:03:20.596]  And I interview, uh, local authorities and I make connections to my community and I do a lot to, you know, talk about your products because they work.
[01:03:21.786 --> 01:03:28.755]  Well, sweetheart, people like you doing that, just everybody getting involved, no matter if you're not professional or professional.
[01:03:28.755 --> 01:03:31.218]  I wasn't professional when I started out, still aren't in many ways.
[01:03:31.218 --> 01:03:32.220]  People like that.
[01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.244]  They like the genuineness and the hokeyness and all the rest of it.
[01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:38.588]  Just get out there, expose the globalists, promote people that are doing good.
[01:03:39.429 --> 01:03:39.869]  That's right.
[01:03:39.869 --> 01:03:40.330]  It's becoming...
[01:03:59.485 --> 01:04:09.248]  It's so large that I'm just, you know, joining the wave of, you know, all of this becoming a reality.
[01:04:09.248 --> 01:04:10.469]  Well, I'm glad you're involved.
[01:04:10.469 --> 01:04:14.710]  I mean, is that your free speech statement, is just that you're involved now?
[01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:20.432]  And the lawsuit that you're facing is... I'm not facing a lawsuit.
[01:04:20.432 --> 01:04:25.914]  I'm facing a fraudulent claim of copyright violation, and then I may have to sue them.
[01:04:27.611 --> 01:04:28.511]  Right!
[01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:30.972]  Exactly, and you get it all on record.
[01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:32.433]  You defeat them.
[01:04:32.433 --> 01:04:33.773]  Happy birthday to you!
[01:04:33.773 --> 01:04:34.934]  Well, God bless you.
[01:04:34.934 --> 01:04:37.675]  But listen, this has happened over and over again.
[01:04:37.675 --> 01:04:40.015]  People say, oh, it's so tiring, they keep attacking.
[01:04:40.015 --> 01:04:44.097]  That's because we are savaging the globalists at point-blank range.
[01:04:44.935 --> 01:04:46.857]  I mean, I expect to be attacked.
[01:04:46.857 --> 01:04:49.379]  The point is, you gotta just keep coming back over and over again.
[01:04:49.379 --> 01:04:51.281]  That's who wins the ball game.
[01:04:51.281 --> 01:04:56.585]  Four quarters, ladies and gentlemen, and we're entering the fourth quarter, and we right now are ahead by three points.
[01:04:56.585 --> 01:04:59.568]  We can win this thing, but we gotta pull in the same direction.
[01:04:59.568 --> 01:05:03.231]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:05:03.231 --> 01:05:07.175]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:05:07.495 --> 01:05:09.277]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:05:09.277 --> 01:05:17.145]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:05:17.145 --> 01:05:18.287]  But for how long?
[01:05:18.287 --> 01:05:24.914]  Go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L bodyarmor.com.
[01:05:24.914 --> 01:05:27.737]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:05:29.045 --> 01:05:32.567]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:05:32.567 --> 01:05:40.812]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.

[01:06:30.283 --> 01:06:33.085]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[01:06:33.085 --> 01:06:35.026]  They are never going to stop.
[01:06:35.026 --> 01:06:39.089]  They're never going to deviate from their program until we stop them.

[01:07:56.361 --> 01:08:01.902]  Silver Bullet.
[01:08:01.902 --> 01:08:04.683]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.683 --> 01:08:07.424]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.737 --> 01:08:16.520]  The headlines on Infowars.com right now.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:26.845]  Feds are holding hearings on whether they should regulate, that's close quote, sites like Drudge, Infowars, an economic collapse blog, and others.
[01:08:26.845 --> 01:08:36.250]  That dovetails with police officers can sue newspapers for publishing descriptive info, like they're secret agents, raising serious First Amendment issues, that's out of tech dirt.
[01:08:38.107 --> 01:08:46.270]  That ties into net neutrality as a Trojan horse virus infecting the internet by the New American.
[01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:54.993]  Because they call it net neutrality having the Obama administration come in to start using the FCC to regulate the web.
[01:08:54.993 --> 01:08:57.554]  And it gets very confusing.
[01:08:57.554 --> 01:09:01.295]  But it's like they call Obamacare reform.
[01:09:01.295 --> 01:09:04.536]  Well, the word reform isn't necessarily good.
[01:09:04.536 --> 01:09:05.697]  And I've said this hundreds of times.
[01:09:06.531 --> 01:09:10.894]  If you stick your hand in a blender and turn it on high, it's going to reform your fingers.
[01:09:10.894 --> 01:09:13.376]  They're going to be reformed.
[01:09:13.376 --> 01:09:26.145]  If a deer jumps out in front of an 18-wheeler going 75 miles an hour, it's going to reform that deer into what looks like blueberry and cherry jelly all over the highway.
[01:09:26.145 --> 01:09:28.006]  It's not a good reform.
[01:09:28.006 --> 01:09:31.269]  So they're playing these games, and they have all the Democratic Party websites
[01:09:32.227 --> 01:09:44.553]  I mean, when I say all of them, scores of them come out a few months ago, and I said this so-called net neutrality that's being brought forward by Obama is the opposite, and I got attacked for it, saying, Jones doesn't like net neutrality, he wants to get rid of internet freedom.
[01:09:44.553 --> 01:09:47.174]  Bull!
[01:09:47.174 --> 01:09:54.878]  I'm against SOPA, I'm against CISPA, I'm against all these different forms of censorship, misapplying copyright.
[01:09:54.878 --> 01:09:56.759]  I'm against all this garbage that's going on.
[01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:00.308]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:10:00.308 --> 01:10:05.972]  And we need the net neutrality we've had, not have government, quote, be the guardian of net neutrality.
[01:10:05.972 --> 01:10:10.996]  We need consumers to leave any company that tries to stop the flow of information over their networks.
[01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:16.910]  And the claim that companies are losing money on video downloads.
[01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:19.691]  They charge you for your internet connection to make huge profits.
[01:10:19.691 --> 01:10:21.411]  This has been the only growth sector in the U.S.
[01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:29.474]  economy, pretty much, except for banking scams in the last 20 years, has been the tech economy, has been the bandwidth, internet, telecommunications, boom!
[01:10:29.474 --> 01:10:37.617]  So we're going to be breaking that report down as well, but I want to go to Terry, Brian, Nathan, Britton.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.802]  Ben and others right now.
[01:10:40.802 --> 01:10:44.846]  I'm not going to belabor this anymore, but some new listeners know what we're talking about.
[01:10:44.846 --> 01:10:54.715]  There is an organization that says they represent some of the Sandy Hook victims' family members called the Honor Newtown Group.
[01:10:56.618 --> 01:11:10.927]  And they say their reason to exist is to bring awareness to hoaxer activity and to criminally and or civilly prosecute those who wittingly and publicly defame, harass, and emotionally abuse the victims of high-profile tragedies and or the family members.
[01:11:10.927 --> 01:11:13.609]  So you're not supposed to question any big high-profile event.
[01:11:13.609 --> 01:11:15.450]  That's the new thought crime.
[01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:20.013]  We intend to hold such abusers personally accountable for their actions in whatever capacity the law allows.
[01:11:21.325 --> 01:11:42.873]  Coming up, I'm going to play the report that they have filed a false copyright claim on and shut down because we showed the BBC News article and several others showing the man that founded this group's son, Noah Posner, in Pakistani rallies for dead children killed by al-Qaeda bombs.
[01:11:42.873 --> 01:11:45.674]  All we said was, what's going on?
[01:11:45.674 --> 01:11:47.315]  Why are they showing this guy's kid
[01:11:48.562 --> 01:11:54.363]  Over here, and when the Pakistanis are questioning whether those attacks even happened.
[01:11:54.363 --> 01:12:01.445]  And there's no response except, we're going to shut your website down, you're not supposed to do that.
[01:12:01.445 --> 01:12:11.347]  And this is how SOPA and CISPO, you get three strikes on the internet, not just on YouTube or a Google platform, and you're off the web with a web ID, you're banned.
[01:12:11.347 --> 01:12:13.167]  They give you three false claims, that's it.
[01:12:14.554 --> 01:12:20.856]  And this group's also saying you can't say the name of any of these children because they've copyrighted them.
[01:12:20.856 --> 01:12:25.378]  You can say the name of anything you want as long as it's free speech.
[01:12:25.378 --> 01:12:41.944]  It's copyrighted for the use in trademark sales, not McDonald's, Wendy's, Ford, Chevy, NFL, NHL, Procter & Gamble, I mean, Disney, Universal Studios,
[01:12:44.915 --> 01:12:47.597]  Major League Baseball.
[01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:48.917]  John Wayne.
[01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:50.478]  John Wayne's name's copyrighted.
[01:12:50.478 --> 01:12:54.721]  The family controls the name for coffee cups and his movies.
[01:12:54.721 --> 01:12:56.662]  And they have a right to do that and get money from it.
[01:12:56.662 --> 01:13:02.285]  But I can say John Wayne, John Wayne, John Wayne, John Wayne, John Wayne, John Wayne, baby!
[01:13:02.285 --> 01:13:04.066]  John Wayne!
[01:13:04.066 --> 01:13:07.408]  You guys get Billy Idol's John Wayne off YouTube.
[01:13:07.408 --> 01:13:08.309]  I want to play that going out.
[01:13:10.026 --> 01:13:12.048]  Like 45 seconds of it or something.
[01:13:12.048 --> 01:13:15.612]  John Wayne, John Wayne, John Wayne, John Wayne.
[01:13:15.612 --> 01:13:18.355]  I am not selling John Wayne coffee mugs.
[01:13:18.355 --> 01:13:21.018]  I'm not selling John Wayne movies on DVD.
[01:13:21.018 --> 01:13:23.781]  I'm not starting a John Wayne theme park.
[01:13:23.781 --> 01:13:28.446]  I can talk about John Wayne all I want or Ronald Reagan.
[01:13:28.446 --> 01:13:29.567]  Look, there's John Wayne!
[01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:36.656]  I mean, that's what these people are claiming.
[01:13:36.656 --> 01:13:38.898]  But that's what they do under SOPA and CISPA.
[01:13:38.898 --> 01:13:48.344]  That's what these corporations are trying to change copyright law to do that.
[01:13:48.344 --> 01:13:48.885]  Enough of that.
[01:13:48.885 --> 01:13:50.306]  Let's now go to your calls.
[01:13:50.306 --> 01:13:51.687]  Nathan says he's an Army vet.
[01:13:51.687 --> 01:13:55.990]  He's listening on 94.3 FM WNFZ.
[01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:57.171]  They're in Tennessee.
[01:13:57.171 --> 01:13:58.792]  Nathan, what's your take on all this?
[01:14:00.529 --> 01:14:04.050]  Well sir, first let me say thank you for the work that you're doing.
[01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:10.671]  I certainly appreciate it because I work in a field where all of my phone calls are recorded.
[01:14:10.671 --> 01:14:18.273]  I live in a society where everything I say can and will be used against me in the court of law.
[01:14:18.273 --> 01:14:23.934]  And I live in a country where it seems like my service and sacrifice is being thrown out the window.
[01:14:24.614 --> 01:14:39.673]  So there are several days where my outlook can be negative, but I wanted you to know that I appreciate what you're doing and I myself am combating the negativity by posting
[01:14:40.274 --> 01:14:41.115]  Brother, we're in this together.
[01:14:41.115 --> 01:14:42.157]  I want to thank you!
[01:14:57.515 --> 01:14:58.856]  for engaging in the First Amendment.
[01:14:58.856 --> 01:15:09.746]  That's how we defeat the globalists, is we make art, we promote freedom, we promote God, we promote values, we promote basic justice, and that will turn the tide against the evil.
[01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:11.867]  We need light in the darkness, absolutely.
[01:15:11.867 --> 01:15:13.629]  What do you make of these pushes?
[01:15:13.629 --> 01:15:16.411]  Why do you think they don't want us investigating Sandy Hook?
[01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:22.517]  Why do you think they've gone to the investigators' homes, criminal investigators, law enforcement investigators, and threatened them?
[01:15:23.217 --> 01:15:30.342]  Law enforcement retired people that are investigating this are being threatened at their homes by the feds.
[01:15:30.342 --> 01:15:38.107]  The darkness, anyone who walks in the darkness always shuns the light because they know that their deeds will be made manifest.
[01:15:38.107 --> 01:15:41.050]  Well I know this, I hear you brother, thank you for the call.
[01:15:41.050 --> 01:15:47.914]  They do not want Sandy Hook investigated and I just can't believe how bold it is if what some people are saying is true.
[01:15:47.914 --> 01:15:49.716]  And I've been massively criticized
[01:15:50.732 --> 01:15:56.021]  Uh, for, you know, not going with the whole thing being staged in the first year or so.
[01:15:56.021 --> 01:15:57.944]  But let's go back to that article by Don Salazar.
[01:15:57.944 --> 01:16:00.929]  I mean, you've got undoubtedly the biggest
[01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:10.938]  Wolfgang Halbig, former state police officer, former customs officer, he then over the next 20 years became the biggest school safety trainer in the country to major colleges, you name it.
[01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:12.559]  I mean, he's the guy.
[01:16:12.559 --> 01:16:15.140]  And he just said, where are the helicopters being launched for the kids?
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.481]  Where's the ambulances?
[01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:18.942]  The whole thing was disregarded.
[01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:21.763]  And then they wouldn't let him into anything and acted very suspicious.
[01:16:21.763 --> 01:16:24.724]  Then they came to his house and threatened him.
[01:16:24.724 --> 01:16:30.687]  When you get him back on, you know, the answer to this censorship is we're just going to redouble our efforts investigating Sandy Hook.
[01:16:31.633 --> 01:16:32.573]  I got a rule, man.
[01:16:32.573 --> 01:16:45.480]  You try to shut me down, I can be totally exhausted and some stalker does something to me or somebody does a dirty trick to my family and I just suddenly have incredible energy and I'm more creative and more hard-fighting I've ever been.
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:46.461]  That's just the human spirit.
[01:16:46.461 --> 01:16:47.541]  Everybody's got that.
[01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:51.083]  Instead of giving in when somebody attacks you, use that to get angry.
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:58.703]  I mean, I'm as nice as pumpkin pie till somebody, you know, comes over and punches me upside the head.
[01:16:58.703 --> 01:17:02.705]  And then, you know, Katie, bar the door, because you just released a monster.
[01:17:02.705 --> 01:17:08.528]  And I'm telling you right now, the globalists are monsters, and it takes monsters to defeat monsters.
[01:17:08.528 --> 01:17:12.150]  And when I say a monster, I mean just the strength of humanity.
[01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:15.671]  We need to stop cowing down to these people.
[01:17:15.671 --> 01:17:19.093]  And let them know we're not putting up with their bullying anymore.
[01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:21.054]  Terry in Tennessee, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:17:22.577 --> 01:17:24.279]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[01:17:24.279 --> 01:17:27.884]  I'm calling you from the formerly free state of Tennessee.
[01:17:27.884 --> 01:17:29.025]  Used to be free, anyway.
[01:17:29.025 --> 01:17:35.213]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:17:35.213 --> 01:17:35.553]  No, no, no.
[01:17:35.553 --> 01:17:36.614]  I'm saying the Volunteer State.
[01:17:36.614 --> 01:17:37.756]  Go ahead.
[01:17:37.756 --> 01:17:38.537]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:39.349 --> 01:17:45.575]  Okay, now it's volunteered by, uh, I guess domestic terrorists is what I call them anyway.
[01:17:45.575 --> 01:17:47.997]  Uh, people want to take your rights away.
[01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:51.820]  Uh, our Bill of Rights is what this country is.
[01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:53.822]  It's the rock that keeps this country together.
[01:17:53.822 --> 01:17:55.563]  It's what we're based on.
[01:17:55.563 --> 01:17:59.187]  Yes, it's the rock that formed this country and people need to remember that.
[01:17:59.187 --> 01:18:06.333]  And when it comes to attacking our freedoms with the internet or anything else, we hold the upper hand on that because we hold the money.
[01:18:07.592 --> 01:18:12.655]  And if people just get angry, cut your internet off for a month.
[01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:14.056]  Take the money away from them.
[01:18:14.056 --> 01:18:16.398]  The businesses will straighten this out.
[01:18:16.398 --> 01:18:22.001]  The Congress, the politicians, they're not going to straighten it out.
[01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:25.983]  Corporate America will straighten it out.
[01:18:25.983 --> 01:18:26.624]  Absolutely.
[01:18:26.624 --> 01:18:28.165]  I mean, look at where we're having victories.
[01:18:28.165 --> 01:18:32.247]  It's where we vote with our dollars and our choices is where we really have the biggest effect.
[01:18:32.247 --> 01:18:33.528]  That's our real power.
[01:18:33.528 --> 01:18:36.210]  That's the vote we've still got, other than the cartridge box.
[01:18:37.748 --> 01:18:45.230]  Yes, and you know, it's time, if any time was a time, now is the time to take our country back.
[01:18:45.230 --> 01:18:49.791]  We have to take it back for our children, or there won't be a country for them.
[01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:51.212]  I'm 58 years old.
[01:18:51.212 --> 01:18:53.693]  I've seen too much stuff happen in my life.
[01:18:53.693 --> 01:19:00.094]  Well, I agree with you, brother, but I remember hearing my grandfather's talk like that and saying, you know, when you're a man and you've got kids, it's going to come.
[01:19:00.094 --> 01:19:01.835]  Well, I'm a man, I've got children, it's here.
[01:19:02.415 --> 01:19:05.776]  I don't think we have to even wait for the lives of our children for this to hit them.
[01:19:05.776 --> 01:19:06.476]  It's going to hit us.
[01:19:06.476 --> 01:19:07.357]  It's hitting us now.
[01:19:07.357 --> 01:19:13.058]  I mean, they're getting more tyranny in place in a year than they would get in place in a previous ten.
[01:19:13.058 --> 01:19:19.080]  I mean, they are moving fast, and it's because they know people are waking up.
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:22.221]  Well, yes, people are waking up, but we have to strike back.
[01:19:22.221 --> 01:19:31.444]  We have to start calling our congressmen and telling them that they need to do their jobs, and if they don't, they won't have a job.
[01:19:32.632 --> 01:19:35.353]  Because there's people that can fill their shoes.
[01:19:35.353 --> 01:19:43.037]  And we need to quit electing people because of the way they look and how rich they are because they're not in contact with us.
[01:19:43.037 --> 01:19:44.118]  And that needs to stop.
[01:19:44.118 --> 01:19:44.498]  That's right.
[01:19:44.498 --> 01:19:49.060]  We need to find the people that have been elected locally that are honorable and have done a good job.
[01:19:49.060 --> 01:19:50.461]  We need to support them.
[01:19:50.461 --> 01:19:51.982]  We need to run for office ourselves.
[01:19:51.982 --> 01:19:53.242]  You're absolutely right.
[01:19:53.242 --> 01:19:53.822]  God bless you.
[01:19:53.822 --> 01:19:58.265]  We're going to come back with Brian and Ben, Brendan, A.D.
[01:19:58.265 --> 01:19:58.645]  and others.
[01:20:02.106 --> 01:20:03.166]  Get back to nature.

[01:20:29.082 --> 01:20:32.444]  I am a 47-year-old female and had a heart attack in 2005.
[01:20:32.444 --> 01:20:35.766]  This is Alice from New Jersey.
[01:20:35.766 --> 01:20:38.968]  I still get angina, even with forced stents.
[01:20:38.968 --> 01:20:41.869]  I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[01:20:41.869 --> 01:20:46.892]  The very first day after taking Heart and Body Extract, the chest pain was gone.
[01:20:46.892 --> 01:20:48.873]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[01:20:58.624 --> 01:21:01.466]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:21:01.466 --> 01:21:06.570]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:14.697]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:21:14.697 --> 01:21:19.220]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:23.003]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:21:23.143 --> 01:21:29.087]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:21:29.087 --> 01:21:32.269]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:21:32.269 --> 01:21:37.633]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storable foods from My Patriot Supply.

[01:21:53.543 --> 01:22:00.930]  What good is a Big Berkey water filter?
[01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:04.494]  We get that question a lot here at BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:22:04.494 --> 01:22:06.656]  And in a word, the answer is protection.
[01:22:06.656 --> 01:22:08.057]  Protection from water main breaks.
[01:22:08.337 --> 01:22:15.940]  E. coli contamination, environmental chemical spills, pesticide runoff, chlorine taste and smell, and all forms of fluoride.
[01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:21.943]  Plus, Big Berkey water filters are the original gravity water filter system and most trusted on the market for a reason.

[01:22:48.471 --> 01:22:49.331]  Big Berkey Water Filters.
[01:22:49.331 --> 01:22:50.191]  For the love of clean water.
[01:22:57.808 --> 01:23:02.393]  When an emergency happens, you could be left to fend for yourself and your family.
[01:23:02.393 --> 01:23:05.696]  An outbreak of contagious disease can happen anywhere.
[01:23:05.696 --> 01:23:11.102]  Because we're faced with more diseases than ever before, we need a better solution than ever before.

[01:24:00.150 --> 01:24:00.418]  Yeah.
[01:24:38.135 --> 01:24:43.339]  That's John Wayne by Billy Idol, bringing us in live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:43.339 --> 01:24:44.399]  And I look that up.
[01:24:44.399 --> 01:24:54.947]  Billy Idol didn't have to pay any copyright to John Wayne's family to sing a song about John Wayne, because it's a tribute, and because he's an icon, and because it's free speech in art.
[01:24:54.947 --> 01:24:59.751]  Just like there have been six or seven movies called Titanic, you can't copyright a title.
[01:25:00.751 --> 01:25:02.953]  But they're trying to do it.
[01:25:02.953 --> 01:25:07.378]  And this is part of the attack on free speech worldwide, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:09.200]  We're taking your phone calls on this subject.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:23.875]  I'll shift gears into some others coming up after we talk to more of the callers and have some of the folks in here, David Knight and, of course, Rob Due of InfoWarsFoundlyNews, who have hosted Sandy Hook debates.
[01:25:25.336 --> 01:25:31.760]  With so-called debunkers of the official story and debunkers of the debunkers.
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:42.046]  So for holding a debate in America and showing both sides, we now need to be taken off the air.
[01:25:42.046 --> 01:25:44.067]  For the children.
[01:25:44.067 --> 01:25:45.468]  Isn't that just precious?
[01:25:48.356 --> 01:25:51.301]  This is how totalitarianism comes.
[01:25:51.301 --> 01:25:53.644]  Always packaged for the children.
[01:25:53.644 --> 01:25:55.708]  Brian in Alabama.
[01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:56.469]  You're on the air.
[01:25:56.469 --> 01:25:56.850]  Go ahead.
[01:25:58.251 --> 01:26:02.413]  Hey Alex, really a pleasure to be on.
[01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:18.483]  I do want to say that I was a part of one of those groups who did give you a lot of criticism on Sandy Hook because of what we saw, blatantly saw, that we just couldn't understand how you couldn't see them either.
[01:26:18.483 --> 01:26:22.465]  Is there a vacuum cleaner going in the background?
[01:26:23.482 --> 01:26:27.246]  I'm sorry, that is actually my FM transmitter rebroadcasting your broadcast.
[01:26:27.246 --> 01:26:28.167]  Ooh, that's awesome!
[01:26:28.167 --> 01:26:29.689]  She got a micro pirate or something?
[01:26:30.971 --> 01:26:33.792]  I don't call... I know, I know, I know.
[01:26:33.792 --> 01:26:51.335]  It's a micro or a citizen broadcasting rig, but then the general public doesn't know what that means, so I say a micro pirate so that they understand the new term micro is what a pirate is, and then we can elaborate on the fact that it's not interfering with commercial broadcasts and the airways belong to the people.
[01:26:51.335 --> 01:26:53.676]  But listen, so you are a First Amendment crusader.
[01:26:53.676 --> 01:26:57.877]  I love the fact that every caller today is engaged in some type of media operation, Brian.
[01:26:59.073 --> 01:27:14.746]  Yes, we're, I'm also involved with Independent Media Solidarity, the group that put out the documentary, We Need to Talk About Sandy Hook, which was brought about by, from another group known as the Max Resistance Roundtable, also over at Max Resistance.
[01:27:14.746 --> 01:27:20.431]  Well, absolutely, before we could even investigate it, there were videos with tens of millions of views bringing up the anomalies.
[01:27:20.431 --> 01:27:22.933]  There's been a real move to shut those folks down.
[01:27:22.933 --> 01:27:24.414]  What do you think of us being censored?
[01:27:24.414 --> 01:27:25.235]  What's been happening to you?
[01:27:28.781 --> 01:27:30.663]  I can tell you lots about Lenny.
[01:27:30.663 --> 01:27:35.105]  This man is something that you've never seen before.
[01:27:35.105 --> 01:27:39.168]  He's got a group of trolls, and if you don't mind, I'll just go ahead and call them out.
[01:27:39.168 --> 01:27:41.349]  These people would be key... Well, listen, hold on, hold on.
[01:27:41.349 --> 01:27:43.010]  I don't want to give these people any attention.
[01:27:43.010 --> 01:27:47.893]  I'm going to have to get with lawyers on this and deal with this, but I understand that
[01:27:48.613 --> 01:27:57.701]  I mean, if they're trying to shut us down when we're just investigating it and looking at all sides, it must be horrible for folks out there that vehemently think this is staged.
[01:27:57.701 --> 01:28:01.365]  So just specifically, what have you gone through?
[01:28:01.365 --> 01:28:11.494]  I can't even put up a video showing that he has put up a copyright strike against me without him copyrighting striking that.
[01:28:12.691 --> 01:28:26.385]  They have taken my information and they gave it to one of his trolls in his network, and they went and they looked up all my information and put up a whole blog post about me and my daughter.
[01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:30.469]  It's what this troll network has done.
[01:28:30.469 --> 01:28:32.611]  These people are vile.
[01:28:32.611 --> 01:28:35.674]  And Lanny, if you're listening, your day is coming, my friend.
[01:28:35.674 --> 01:28:36.315]  It is coming.
[01:28:36.966 --> 01:28:39.270]  Wow, I mean this sounds like a war is going on.
[01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:47.382]  I think they made a major mistake involving us because we were basically showing both sides and getting criticized by both groups for it.
[01:28:48.542 --> 01:28:49.422]  Oh, I totally agree.
[01:28:49.422 --> 01:28:51.743]  They don't know what they bid off.
[01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:53.083]  Go after them, Alex.
[01:28:53.083 --> 01:28:53.564]  Crush them.
[01:29:09.127 --> 01:29:11.608]  They have two different email addresses they used.
[01:29:11.608 --> 01:29:15.789]  I noticed you said that for this claim they used the honor at gmail.
[01:29:15.789 --> 01:29:21.351]  The other one that they used, I won't say it, but I'll tell you off air if you want to know what that one is off air.
[01:29:21.351 --> 01:29:33.255]  Well, I just, I'm not somebody to mess with and I understand that they can, you know, use children or whatever and then, you know, say the First Amendment's bad, but I mean, I've got to defend the First Amendment and it's just wild to get into this subject.
[01:29:33.675 --> 01:29:38.879]  We got all this stuff happening worldwide, all these moves against the First Amendment going on.
[01:29:38.879 --> 01:29:40.740]  It's pretty hardcore.
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:48.866]  So we're going to have our news director in here with our news anchor to talk about this because they're trying to shut us down.
[01:29:48.866 --> 01:29:50.247]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.247 --> 01:29:52.769]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:52.769 --> 01:29:55.451]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:59.468 --> 01:30:02.852]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[01:30:02.852 --> 01:30:06.377]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[01:30:06.377 --> 01:30:12.444]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[01:30:12.444 --> 01:30:13.846]  I'm all about human potential.
[01:30:13.846 --> 01:30:15.969]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:30:16.049 --> 01:30:17.630]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:22.412]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:30:22.412 --> 01:30:26.994]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.

[01:31:29.346 --> 01:31:33.008]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[01:31:33.008 --> 01:31:37.289]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[01:31:37.289 --> 01:31:39.070]  Can you put two and two together?
[01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:46.933]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[01:31:46.933 --> 01:31:48.074]  But for how long?
[01:31:48.074 --> 01:31:54.697]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[01:31:54.697 --> 01:31:57.518]  Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:31:59.211 --> 01:32:05.337]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:32:05.337 --> 01:32:09.922]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation.
[01:32:09.922 --> 01:32:17.630]  A highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:23.395]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[01:32:29.341 --> 01:32:34.285]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[01:32:34.285 --> 01:32:37.889]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:32:38.209 --> 01:32:44.832]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:32:44.832 --> 01:32:49.974]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[01:32:49.974 --> 01:32:53.695]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[01:32:53.695 --> 01:32:55.616]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:33:20.174 --> 01:33:23.784]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:33:23.784 --> 01:33:25.108]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.148 --> 01:33:34.868]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:34.868 --> 01:33:36.729]  We're now halfway into the worldwide transmission.
[01:33:36.729 --> 01:33:39.189]  I'll continue with calls on the First Amendment.
[01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:46.971]  Not so much specifically Sandy Hook connected groups that are suing Bushmaster, that are involved in going after the Second Amendment.
[01:33:46.971 --> 01:33:49.112]  It's confirmed this group is involved with that.
[01:33:49.112 --> 01:33:53.813]  It appears to be the group that's done this are the ones that did file it.
[01:33:53.813 --> 01:33:56.093]  We're just giving them the benefit of the doubt.
[01:33:56.093 --> 01:34:00.514]  This Honor Network, this is the global program to shut down free speech though.
[01:34:01.693 --> 01:34:04.835]  Okay, it's not just the Second Amendment.
[01:34:04.835 --> 01:34:18.504]  And I have had, down in San Antonio, at our Open Carry event, people come over and physically start pushing into me, saying, your free speech is hurting, you know, the death of my daughter, who got killed by someone, as if I shot their daughter.
[01:34:18.504 --> 01:34:22.447]  When statistically, the areas that don't have guns have the highest crime rates.
[01:34:22.447 --> 01:34:23.328]  Don't have legal guns.
[01:34:23.328 --> 01:34:26.670]  I mean, you're not for Obamacare, you're racist.
[01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:29.412]  You're for the Second Amendment, and my grandson got shot.
[01:34:30.523 --> 01:34:35.405]  Well, I'm sorry, it was crackheads robbing a liquor store that shot your grandson, not me.
[01:34:35.405 --> 01:34:38.866]  Just like if somebody runs over a crowd with a Ford F-150.
[01:34:38.866 --> 01:34:40.386]  It doesn't mean Ford did it.
[01:34:40.386 --> 01:34:44.608]  I mean, this is just basic common sense.
[01:34:44.608 --> 01:34:48.049]  But let's get away from info wars when we go to the calls.
[01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:49.910]  I mean, you're welcome to bring up this case.
[01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:53.371]  It's that you've got so-called net neutrality coming in.
[01:34:54.482 --> 01:34:58.244]  The way Obama packages it, it sounds good, but it's the takeover of the web.
[01:34:58.244 --> 01:35:01.406]  Just like he's going to give you free health care by taking it over and it isn't free.
[01:35:01.406 --> 01:35:03.408]  So, they're lying with labels.
[01:35:03.408 --> 01:35:11.493]  And you've got Congress having hearings, we've got links to it on Infowars.com, where they're having hearings.
[01:35:11.493 --> 01:35:16.156]  Feds hold hearings on whether they should, quote, regulate sites like Drudge, Infowars, and others.
[01:35:19.415 --> 01:35:31.744]  After the fake Sony hack that turned out to be an inside job, we've now seen legislation reintroduced there to pass cyber security that's basically SOPA and CISPA.
[01:35:31.744 --> 01:35:33.326]  So it's all coming down right now.
[01:35:33.326 --> 01:35:34.687]  So it's bigger than InfoWars.
[01:35:34.687 --> 01:35:41.231]  I want to explain to you that this is about your freedom when you're getting your pension funds taken.
[01:35:41.231 --> 01:35:45.595]  This is about your freedom to say no to Obamacare, which is on the verge of being overturned.
[01:35:46.542 --> 01:35:49.964]  We are really pushing back against the globalists right now.
[01:35:49.964 --> 01:35:52.846]  All the metrics, all the numbers show it, so they're scared.
[01:35:52.846 --> 01:35:55.647]  And the anti-gunners are losing on every front.
[01:35:55.647 --> 01:36:14.178]  So Bloomberg and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have given collectively hundreds of millions of dollars in the last election cycle to anti-gunners to try to unseat good sheriffs, to try to politically put pressure on police chiefs that are not criminals, Democratic police chiefs they're going after, Democratic sheriffs.
[01:36:15.659 --> 01:36:21.521]  These groups went after the Travis County Sheriff, who's a black man and does a pretty darn good job.
[01:36:21.521 --> 01:36:30.883]  I'm just mentioning he's black because they say he's racist because he will hand over to the feds, this is all over the news here, and they say it with bated breath.
[01:36:30.883 --> 01:36:31.943]  I can't believe it.
[01:36:31.943 --> 01:36:35.504]  He deports up to 15 illegals a week.
[01:36:35.504 --> 01:36:37.424]  He gives them to the feds.
[01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:39.125]  They're aggravated felons!
[01:36:40.765 --> 01:36:45.448]  He releases illegals that aren't aggravated felons, which he shouldn't be doing.
[01:36:45.448 --> 01:36:50.911]  He's a hero because usually they just release the felons.
[01:36:50.911 --> 01:36:53.413]  And he's racist though, though he's a black man.
[01:36:53.413 --> 01:36:54.854]  I mean, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:36:54.854 --> 01:37:00.157]  The law says that he has to give them to the feds if they're an aggravated felon.
[01:37:00.157 --> 01:37:02.178]  And that's where I live.
[01:37:02.178 --> 01:37:05.160]  This coalition Democratic Party is trying to get rid of their own Democratic sheriff.
[01:37:06.175 --> 01:37:08.277]  I mean, these people are authoritarian.
[01:37:08.277 --> 01:37:14.662]  It's like the Governor Cuomo of New York last year said, if you're pro-life or pro-gun, get out of the state.
[01:37:14.662 --> 01:37:15.442]  People said, are you serious?
[01:37:15.442 --> 01:37:17.524]  He said, yeah, get out, you're not welcome here.
[01:37:17.524 --> 01:37:20.266]  Do you realize how authoritarian that is?
[01:37:20.266 --> 01:37:23.108]  You're pro-life or you're pro-gun, get out of the state.
[01:37:23.108 --> 01:37:26.651]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[01:37:26.651 --> 01:37:35.038]  And now, they file this copyright claim, claiming we have their Fox News footage when it's David Knight talking, showing a BBC News article
[01:37:36.462 --> 01:37:43.270]  Where one of the Sandy Hook kids is up there supposedly dead in a bombing.
[01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:47.855]  So, I'm gonna go back to your calls, but just analyzing this, there's so many angles.
[01:37:49.309 --> 01:37:54.292]  News Director of Infowars Nightly News, Rob Doob, you've hosted debates on this subject.
[01:37:54.292 --> 01:37:56.072]  We've shown both sides.
[01:37:56.072 --> 01:38:00.255]  We've been attacked for saying, you know, it might have happened as said, but there's some anomalies.
[01:38:00.255 --> 01:38:04.437]  We've been attacked for other reporters saying, no, I think, you know, this is staged.
[01:38:04.437 --> 01:38:06.418]  Clearly something's staged.
[01:38:06.418 --> 01:38:10.340]  So first off, let me just ask you both point blank, doing deep research on this the last few years.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:14.742]  David Knight and then Rob Doob, just briefly, what is your view on Sandy Hook?
[01:38:15.834 --> 01:38:18.220]  Well, that's a can of worms.
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:22.131]  I think we're not getting the truth from day one.
[01:38:22.131 --> 01:38:23.033]  We weren't getting the truth.
[01:38:24.867 --> 01:38:27.129]  And I suppose you don't believe Brian Williams either.
[01:38:27.129 --> 01:38:28.810]  Oh yeah, of course.
[01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:40.220]  You know, after interviewing Halbig a couple times, having a debate with him, watching that film that came out that was censored heavily, that this coalition of people put together, I interviewed them right before that debate.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.322]  People should go watch that whole InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:38:42.322 --> 01:38:45.104]  I mean, that's a lot of information on Sandy Hook.
[01:38:45.104 --> 01:38:49.308]  A couple years after it happened, we were coming up on the two-year... I wonder if they're going to censor that and take that down.
[01:38:50.270 --> 01:38:50.830]  They might.
[01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:52.331]  I mean, we were talking about it.
[01:38:52.331 --> 01:38:54.492]  And we're not allowed to have two different guys on to debate it?
[01:38:54.492 --> 01:38:54.952]  Exactly.
[01:38:54.952 --> 01:38:59.455]  And one of them was an American Free Press writer who was friends with Lenny Posner.
[01:38:59.455 --> 01:39:00.875]  And he's like, I know him personally.
[01:39:00.875 --> 01:39:02.076]  We're friends.
[01:39:02.076 --> 01:39:05.178]  You know, you guys are making a big mistake having Wolfgang Halbig on.
[01:39:05.178 --> 01:39:06.258]  I said, well, why don't you debate him?
[01:39:06.258 --> 01:39:07.259]  Oh, I love that.
[01:39:07.259 --> 01:39:08.539]  You're making a big mistake.
[01:39:08.539 --> 01:39:09.920]  A big mistake, yeah.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.561]  So see, we're not even supposed to have a debate.
[01:39:11.741 --> 01:39:12.822]  Right, you're not even allowed to talk about it.
[01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:20.392]  And if you look at that debate, the guy who was opposing Halbig never offered any reason, never responded to anything that... He just attacked Halbig.
[01:39:20.392 --> 01:39:24.477]  Halbig had some very specific questions and the guy always just attacked Halbig.
[01:39:24.477 --> 01:39:26.479]  Why didn't they call rescue helicopters?
[01:39:26.479 --> 01:39:26.759]  Exactly.
[01:39:26.759 --> 01:39:27.380]  On and on and on.
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:27.761]  Yeah.
[01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:29.723]  Why were the ambulances not even at the school?
[01:39:29.723 --> 01:39:30.945]  They were stuck at the firehouse.
[01:39:31.425 --> 01:39:33.006]  Why did they destroy?
[01:39:33.006 --> 01:39:34.846]  Why did they classify the investigation?
[01:39:34.846 --> 01:39:36.787]  They've never done that with any previous shootings.
[01:39:36.787 --> 01:39:38.868]  Why did they knock down the school and destroy it?
[01:39:38.868 --> 01:39:42.149]  Why did Mayor Bloomberg alert his people to get ready the day before for a big push?
[01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.449]  Yeah.
[01:39:42.449 --> 01:39:48.812]  They made it a felony to release birth certificates or death certificate information.
[01:39:48.812 --> 01:39:49.932]  What kind of country is that?
[01:39:49.932 --> 01:39:52.773]  Where you can't release birth certificate and death certificate information.
[01:39:53.891 --> 01:39:57.733]  I mean, if there's, you know, what have you got to hide, as they like to say to us?
[01:39:57.733 --> 01:40:00.134]  You know, what have you, why are you so concerned about privacy?
[01:40:00.134 --> 01:40:01.595]  What have you got to hide?
[01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:05.817]  But it's only if you're going after one of their, what looks, I think it looks like an operation.
[01:40:05.817 --> 01:40:07.098]  It looks like something went on there.
[01:40:07.098 --> 01:40:07.778]  A drill.
[01:40:07.778 --> 01:40:08.939]  Stinks to high heaven.
[01:40:08.939 --> 01:40:10.199]  Stinks to high heaven.
[01:40:10.199 --> 01:40:13.381]  You got the actor father who comes out, gets into character.
[01:40:13.381 --> 01:40:14.241]  I was a theater major.
[01:40:14.241 --> 01:40:15.122]  I worked with actors.
[01:40:15.122 --> 01:40:18.584]  I used to watch them get ready before they would go out and cry like that.
[01:40:19.204 --> 01:40:20.305]  You have a degree in theater.
[01:40:20.305 --> 01:40:29.876]  I was in the play Our Town and I'm sitting there watching these other people about to go out and do the funeral scene and they're pumping themselves up doing exactly what he did.
[01:40:29.876 --> 01:40:36.363]  First he's laughing and smiling and then he walks out and then he's totally sad, crying, he was cracking jokes right before.
[01:40:36.363 --> 01:40:36.964]  That's an actor.
[01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:40.070]  As an actor, I'm sorry.
[01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:41.030]  You're not allowed to say that.
[01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:43.311]  I mean, Brian Williams was shot down in that helicopter.
[01:40:43.311 --> 01:40:43.952]  There it is right there.
[01:40:43.952 --> 01:40:44.732]  He's smiling.
[01:40:44.732 --> 01:40:49.254]  I mean, he's just... Then he huffs and puffs and gets him out.
[01:40:49.254 --> 01:40:49.755]  Yeah.
[01:40:49.755 --> 01:40:53.757]  And that is a telltale sign of somebody acting right there.
[01:40:53.757 --> 01:40:56.198]  Now, I don't know for a fact that this guy's an actor.
[01:40:56.198 --> 01:40:58.119]  That looks like acting all the way.
[01:41:00.143 --> 01:41:05.632]  It's just amazing that they continue to really go after people.
[01:41:05.632 --> 01:41:09.839]  I've got an article here from a guy, I think was our last caller, Michael.
[01:41:09.839 --> 01:41:10.240]  He's been
[01:41:11.246 --> 01:41:14.228]  He's been getting all kinds of grief from Mr. Posner.
[01:41:14.228 --> 01:41:19.271]  Anything that comes out, social media shutdown due to Sandy Hook false copyrights.
[01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:25.154]  What's interesting is they list the address for the Honor Network in Boca Raton, Florida.
[01:41:25.154 --> 01:41:28.816]  You look up the address on that, which says 908 North Dixie Highway.
[01:41:28.816 --> 01:41:31.478]  It is the address for a women's clothing store.
[01:41:32.558 --> 01:41:36.060]  And a UPS, a U-Haul rental place.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:37.420]  U-Haul Neighborhood Dealer.
[01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:40.802]  So here's the 908 North Dixie Highway.
[01:41:40.802 --> 01:41:44.224]  There is no suite, but it's got two different buildings listed at that address.
[01:41:44.224 --> 01:41:51.867]  One is a J&JJ Shop Women's Clothing Store, and you go to the other one, same address, U-Haul Neighborhood Dealer.
[01:41:51.867 --> 01:41:54.969]  Now you go to their About Honor Network.
[01:41:56.031 --> 01:41:56.992]  Go to this one right here, guys.
[01:41:56.992 --> 01:41:58.233]  You can leave the camera right there.
[01:41:58.233 --> 01:42:00.534]  Honor Network, right there.
[01:42:00.534 --> 01:42:01.595]  They say they're in Connecticut.
[01:42:01.595 --> 01:42:02.916]  Says they're in Newtown, Connecticut.
[01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:06.598]  But you go to that address, it's a U-Haul.
[01:42:06.598 --> 01:42:07.098]  UPS store.
[01:42:07.098 --> 01:42:08.439]  I'm sorry, it's a UPS store.
[01:42:08.439 --> 01:42:11.421]  Same address, Main Street, Newtown, Connecticut.
[01:42:11.421 --> 01:42:12.222]  It's a UPS store.
[01:42:12.882 --> 01:42:16.684]  So, and then you look on their website, what are they pushing?
[01:42:16.684 --> 01:42:17.324]  Donate.
[01:42:17.324 --> 01:42:17.725]  Donate.
[01:42:17.725 --> 01:42:18.025]  Donate.
[01:42:18.025 --> 01:42:19.245]  What do they push right after this?
[01:42:19.245 --> 01:42:19.586]  Donate.
[01:42:19.586 --> 01:42:20.166]  Donate.
[01:42:20.166 --> 01:42:23.928]  There are millions of dollars people have given to Sandy Hook and the families.
[01:42:23.928 --> 01:42:26.149]  They've gotten government money.
[01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:31.172]  The police department got like several million dollars just from the federal government alone just to deal with the grief.
[01:42:32.031 --> 01:42:34.933]  So there's millions of dollars of money pouring into there.
[01:42:34.933 --> 01:42:40.376]  You'd think, you know, if they had this organization, they would have some sort of headquarters where they would be setting up a memorial.
[01:42:40.376 --> 01:42:41.897]  Well, we'll just start investigating that.
[01:42:41.897 --> 01:42:44.098]  I guess I'm going to have to probably go on up to Newtown.
[01:42:44.098 --> 01:42:46.760]  I'm going to have to probably go investigate Florida as well.
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:53.284]  And going back to that Pakistani article where it shows the child's photograph from... That was on the BBC.
[01:42:53.284 --> 01:42:54.024]  Right.
[01:42:54.024 --> 01:42:56.846]  Even Snopes, the cat lady, even agrees with us.
[01:42:58.327 --> 01:42:59.767]  She's the ultimate authority.
[01:42:59.767 --> 01:43:01.428]  Ultimate authority.
[01:43:01.428 --> 01:43:05.370]  They say we're mostly right on this, even though they call us Infobores.
[01:43:05.370 --> 01:43:07.331]  But they are saying, this is weird.
[01:43:07.331 --> 01:43:11.353]  Why is this kid's photo in with all these other kids' photos?
[01:43:11.353 --> 01:43:13.274]  And it's not just one spot, either.
[01:43:13.274 --> 01:43:14.735]  The kid's holding it.
[01:43:14.735 --> 01:43:16.456]  There's a new poster every minute.
[01:43:16.456 --> 01:43:18.257]  Pakistan terror bombings.
[01:43:18.257 --> 01:43:19.918]  It's on BBC and a bunch of other places.
[01:43:19.918 --> 01:43:24.760]  They're showing Posner's kid, Noah, who reportedly died at the Sandy Hook event.
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.060]  Right.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.021]  In several locations.
[01:43:26.221 --> 01:43:28.148]  And we're not supposed to ask that?
[01:43:28.148 --> 01:43:30.496]  And then we get a guy on to debate it and we're nice?
[01:43:30.496 --> 01:43:32.042]  And he's like, you guys are making a big mistake?
[01:43:32.944 --> 01:43:38.047]  The article that Adan put up, he documented very clearly a lot of different pictures.
[01:43:38.047 --> 01:43:44.511]  We had two pictures from the French press agency, the big one, as well as on their Facebook.
[01:43:44.511 --> 01:43:46.672]  There were at least two from the BBC.
[01:43:46.672 --> 01:43:49.354]  There was a Facebook page and the Pakistan School.
[01:43:49.354 --> 01:43:51.655]  There was a memorial wall in Pakistan.
[01:43:51.655 --> 01:43:53.236]  Multiple, multiple sources.
[01:43:53.236 --> 01:43:54.437]  So why is this?
[01:43:54.437 --> 01:43:55.658]  And here's a question, Alex.
[01:43:56.397 --> 01:43:59.278]  Did they complain to the BBC?
[01:43:59.278 --> 01:44:02.039]  Did they complain to the French News Agency?
[01:44:02.039 --> 01:44:05.980]  Saying, you're photoshopping our kids' photos into other stuff.
[01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:10.602]  Which is the basis of what this honor organization is supposedly talking about.
[01:44:10.602 --> 01:44:13.963]  That they want to shut down anybody that misuses the images of their kids.
[01:44:13.963 --> 01:44:15.723]  Did they talk to the Pakistanis about this?
[01:44:15.723 --> 01:44:17.884]  Did they talk to the French News Agency?
[01:44:17.884 --> 01:44:19.525]  To the BBC?
[01:44:19.525 --> 01:44:20.145]  I'd like to know.
[01:44:20.145 --> 01:44:20.585]  I doubt it.
[01:44:22.352 --> 01:44:29.315]  And you made a point that this is the same group going after Bushmaster, the M4 manufacturer.
[01:44:29.315 --> 01:44:30.796]  Break that down.
[01:44:30.796 --> 01:44:42.382]  Yeah, really, if you look at this, they're suing the gun manufacturer, saying that this is a gun that should never have been out there because it's a military weapon, so it should never have been sold to civilians.
[01:44:42.382 --> 01:44:45.223]  And if they have their way, all semi-automatics will be shut down.
[01:44:45.223 --> 01:44:45.664]  Go ahead, sorry.
[01:44:45.664 --> 01:44:47.164]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:44:47.164 --> 01:44:50.186]  This is a group that is going after the Second Amendment.
[01:44:50.967 --> 01:44:52.188]  Full and first.
[01:44:52.188 --> 01:44:53.868]  I mean, that's the first group that they sued.
[01:44:53.868 --> 01:44:57.030]  There's 10 families in this lawsuit against the gun manufacturer.
[01:44:57.030 --> 01:45:02.212]  The two families finally sued the school system for negligence.
[01:45:02.212 --> 01:45:04.573]  But 10 of them are going after the gun owners.
[01:45:04.573 --> 01:45:10.075]  And they've set up another website besides this one to just go after gun control.
[01:45:10.075 --> 01:45:11.656]  So their focus has been gun control.
[01:45:11.656 --> 01:45:13.337]  But when somebody has no respect
[01:45:13.777 --> 01:45:14.457]  That's not our fault!
[01:45:14.457 --> 01:45:15.278]  That's not our fault!
[01:45:33.305 --> 01:46:00.598]  But if the way you deal with your grief is to go out and try to punish innocent people by taking their liberties, if the way you try to deal with your grief is to go out and try to destroy the fundamental legal structure of our country, for which people died to establish the fact that we had a country that was based on individual liberty, you want to try to destroy the foundations of our country, to try to go after innocent people's rights, to try to make it worthwhile, to try to make you feel better about your personal loss,
[01:46:01.078 --> 01:46:03.239]  I'm sorry, I have no respect for people like that.
[01:46:03.239 --> 01:46:05.839]  Well, I mean, I've got stacks of news here today.
[01:46:05.839 --> 01:46:08.560]  I mean, there's so much news I'll cover in the third hour and take calls.
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:13.442]  It's just that this is a big deal because everywhere there's attacks on the First Amendment right now.
[01:46:13.442 --> 01:46:15.022]  Let's, I mean, David, speak to that.
[01:46:15.022 --> 01:46:18.243]  I mean, they're moving full force globally, not just here.
[01:46:18.243 --> 01:46:23.205]  Zuckerberg met a month ago with the top communist Chinese internet czar and said, I'm learning how to censor.
[01:46:24.265 --> 01:46:29.988]  And then he doesn't support... He doesn't want a guy building a house near his backyard, Zuckerberg.
[01:46:29.988 --> 01:46:32.729]  He's like all up in arms that this guy is going to build a house near his backyard.
[01:46:32.729 --> 01:46:37.332]  Well, he also doesn't let people post images of Mohammed now on Facebook.
[01:46:37.332 --> 01:46:40.553]  Though he says, you know, I am Charlie.
[01:46:40.553 --> 01:46:41.454]  I am Spartacus.
[01:46:41.454 --> 01:46:42.894]  I am Charlie Hebdo.
[01:46:42.894 --> 01:46:43.675]  But no, he's not.
[01:46:44.395 --> 01:46:49.518]  They have bumped up the cyber law that they were using to go after hackers.
[01:46:49.518 --> 01:46:50.319]  They've bumped that up.
[01:46:50.319 --> 01:46:52.560]  They had a lot of things that were misdemeanors.
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:53.941]  They've now made felonies.
[01:46:53.941 --> 01:46:56.903]  They want to invoke the RICO statute against that.
[01:46:56.903 --> 01:46:58.724]  They're coming back with CISPA again.
[01:46:58.724 --> 01:47:05.268]  They've got the trade treaties, the transatlantic, trans-pacific partnerships that are going to be used for copyright.
[01:47:05.768 --> 01:47:07.469]  To shut down free speech.
[01:47:07.469 --> 01:47:09.509]  That's one of the things that they're going to do with it.
[01:47:09.509 --> 01:47:12.450]  So, there's multiple ways that they're coming after us.
[01:47:12.450 --> 01:47:18.132]  If you look at the, you've got the FCC that is now saying that they want to control the internet.
[01:47:18.132 --> 01:47:25.254]  Of course, they're going to come at it from the standpoint of net neutrality because they've taken a poll, they found out the majority of people want net neutrality.
[01:47:25.254 --> 01:47:26.114]  So they'll use that to get control.
[01:47:26.114 --> 01:47:27.215]  So they'll just call it net neutrality?
[01:47:27.215 --> 01:47:28.555]  Yeah, they'll use that to get control.
[01:47:28.555 --> 01:47:30.416]  They've been on both sides of this issue.
[01:47:30.416 --> 01:47:32.356]  They want control of the internet.
[01:47:32.356 --> 01:47:33.277]  That's what this is all about.
[01:47:33.277 --> 01:47:34.377]  They could care less about net neutrality.
[01:47:34.457 --> 01:47:34.857]  We're good.
[01:48:04.877 --> 01:48:13.925]  And I said, I bet, because this thing's GPS controlled, it has to program and get, you know, connected before it flies and has stabilizers.
[01:48:13.925 --> 01:48:21.712]  And I said, I bet in the future, Buckley, I think I want to do a whole report on this, that it's pre-programmed that it can't fly by... They already have that.
[01:48:21.712 --> 01:48:22.292]  They already have that.
[01:48:22.292 --> 01:48:23.053]  I was about to say.
[01:48:23.053 --> 01:48:23.813]  And he goes, oh no.
[01:48:24.834 --> 01:48:29.138]  They just did an update with this company, last week was in the news, so it can't fly to the White House.
[01:48:29.138 --> 01:48:30.479]  It has thousands of other sites.
[01:48:30.479 --> 01:48:43.509]  So this is the pre-programming into our phones, into our cars, into all this quote smart tech to control and suppress us so they can have big giant drones surveilling us and little drones, but then we can't have little drones for what we want to do.
[01:48:43.789 --> 01:48:48.535]  They put a one-and-a-half mile radius no-fly zone into their firmware for the little drone.
[01:48:48.535 --> 01:48:53.782]  And they said there's already a lot of other sensitive areas that are in there that you can't fly it nearby.
[01:48:53.782 --> 01:48:57.727]  But see, there I am saying, I bet they do this, and it's already been done.
[01:48:57.727 --> 01:49:00.490]  But the government uses it to spy on farmers, and that's okay.
[01:49:00.490 --> 01:49:01.331]  Because it's the government.
[01:49:01.932 --> 01:49:03.433]  Doesn't matter, you know.
[01:49:03.433 --> 01:49:05.454]  Oh yeah, the Bureau of Land Management.
[01:49:05.454 --> 01:49:07.675]  It only matters about what their supposed rights are.
[01:49:07.675 --> 01:49:10.697]  The MRAPs that they're handing out to all the police departments.
[01:49:10.697 --> 01:49:12.297]  Now they're using them as ambulances.
[01:49:12.297 --> 01:49:13.158]  Right, right.
[01:49:13.158 --> 01:49:16.820]  Supposedly, yeah.
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:21.582]  Just as they did that with the MRAPs, they're now doing that with the Predator drones.
[01:49:21.582 --> 01:49:26.845]  Giving them to not just Homeland Security, but they're giving them to the Bureau of Land Management.
[01:49:27.085 --> 01:49:30.366]  Which they admit they're using to surveil the farmers.
[01:49:30.366 --> 01:49:32.586]  Oh, you built a barn you weren't supposed to.
[01:49:32.586 --> 01:49:34.327]  Oh, you've got a wetland that's a puddle.
[01:49:34.327 --> 01:49:34.987]  That's right.
[01:49:34.987 --> 01:49:50.250]  See if they can find a mineral resource that you can get a senator like Harry Reid to fence to a multinational corporation, and then they can go onto your property and look for more detail to see if they can get you on some kind of an environmental regulation or something else where they can... Right, he's got a gas can sitting out.
[01:49:50.410 --> 01:49:52.752]  Yeah, give you excessive fines and basically take your property.
[01:49:52.752 --> 01:50:02.999]  Look at that pond in Montana, the guy built, and the EPA came in and started fining him $75,000 per day, and he didn't have any water that was crossing anything on his property.
[01:50:02.999 --> 01:50:11.024]  It certainly didn't cross state lines, so the EPA shouldn't have been involved in the first place, in my opinion, as I read the Constitution, but it didn't even cross his property lines.
[01:50:11.024 --> 01:50:14.967]  He dug out a hole, put rainwater in it, had a pond, and they tried to fine him $75,000.
[01:50:14.967 --> 01:50:16.208]  And everybody does that.
[01:50:16.208 --> 01:50:17.309]  It's called a cattle pond.
[01:50:17.469 --> 01:50:18.609]  Yeah.
[01:50:18.609 --> 01:50:22.130]  And this guy had cleared it with the state and local people.
[01:50:22.130 --> 01:50:25.031]  Well, you know that's why he got in trouble, is that's how it went in the database.
[01:50:25.031 --> 01:50:25.471]  Right.
[01:50:25.471 --> 01:50:26.391]  You just gotta do it.
[01:50:26.391 --> 01:50:33.293]  But now they're gonna have the database where they go out using these things that are truly drones because a true drone is totally autonomous.
[01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:35.514]  It will make the decisions if that's a new pun.
[01:50:35.694 --> 01:50:42.778]  And this is what they're going to do with these vaccine things, too, where they want you to opt out of the vaccine, get your written permission, your philosophical objection to it.
[01:50:42.778 --> 01:50:45.119]  They're going to use that as a roadmap of the persecution.
[01:50:45.119 --> 01:50:45.580]  We're going right.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.141]  We know exactly where to go now to inject your kids.
[01:50:48.141 --> 01:50:49.802]  So it's all getting lined up.
[01:50:49.802 --> 01:50:53.404]  It's like gun registration always leads to confiscation.
[01:50:53.404 --> 01:50:55.225]  And these waiver forms turn into the blueprint.
[01:50:55.225 --> 01:50:57.066]  We're going to come back with more on the First Amendment.
[01:50:57.066 --> 01:50:57.647]  Your phone calls.
[01:50:57.647 --> 01:50:58.127]  Stay with us.

[01:51:14.633 --> 01:51:16.813]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources.
[01:51:16.813 --> 01:51:21.514]  Is it time to convert paper 401ks and IRAs to solid gold and silver yet?

[01:51:29.395 --> 01:51:32.098]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[01:51:32.098 --> 01:51:36.421]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[01:51:36.421 --> 01:51:37.822]  SilverLungs.com.
[01:51:37.822 --> 01:51:40.485]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[01:51:40.485 --> 01:51:43.487]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[01:51:43.487 --> 01:51:45.849]  The Silver Lungs Generator allows you to make your own.
[01:51:45.849 --> 01:51:47.751]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[01:51:47.751 --> 01:51:53.316]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[01:51:53.316 --> 01:51:56.939]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and lung delivery system at SilverLungs.com.
[01:51:57.099 --> 01:51:58.560]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:52:13.268 --> 01:52:15.469]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[01:52:15.469 --> 01:52:17.050]  The establishment is the opposite.
[01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:21.752]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[01:52:21.752 --> 01:52:26.355]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[01:52:26.355 --> 01:52:29.016]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[01:52:29.016 --> 01:52:37.040]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month, we're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:40.602]  The sale is only running for the month, 20% off, and there's a lot of other
[01:52:40.822 --> 01:52:43.806]  Powerful specials at Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:43.806 --> 01:52:45.708]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:52:45.708 --> 01:52:48.651]  Celebrating human potential in the month of February.
[01:52:48.651 --> 01:52:53.157]  Visit Infowarslife.com to find this special and many others in the month of February.
[01:52:53.157 --> 01:52:55.740]  Again, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:52:59.043 --> 01:53:05.824]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[01:53:05.824 --> 01:53:10.225]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink, and you'll become wrinkled.
[01:53:10.225 --> 01:53:13.726]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[01:53:13.726 --> 01:53:14.846]  Not fun!
[01:53:14.846 --> 01:53:23.247]  However, if you can consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle, and speed of recovery.
[01:53:23.247 --> 01:53:28.008]  One World Whey is a highly digestible whey protein powder that may be the perfect answer for you.
[01:53:28.348 --> 01:53:29.509]  My name is Errol.
[01:53:29.509 --> 01:53:31.050]  I'm 74 years old.
[01:53:31.050 --> 01:53:33.611]  You know, the taste of One World Whey is amazing.
[01:53:33.611 --> 01:53:41.475]  I play pickleball, and since taking One World Whey and your Trace Mineral Supplement, I have more energy and recover faster from my working out.
[01:53:41.475 --> 01:53:47.779]  I used to take another grass-fed whey protein powder, but now I'm getting much better results using One World Whey.
[01:53:47.779 --> 01:53:48.259]  Call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.259 --> 01:53:48.459]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:48.459 --> 01:53:49.540]  Or visit OneWorldWhey.com.
[01:53:59.653 --> 01:54:14.040]  Before you slip into a Prozac taste, I'd like to add some fluoride juice.
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:19.863]  Some GMO poison.
[01:54:19.863 --> 01:54:25.525]  Oh, Brian Williams is a hero.
[01:54:25.525 --> 01:54:28.427]  Oh, we love Brian Williams.
[01:54:29.227 --> 01:54:31.771]  The key is acting stupid.
[01:54:31.771 --> 01:54:33.113]  The whole album.
[01:54:33.113 --> 01:54:36.319]  I do that totally impromptu, that's why it's so horrible.
[01:54:36.319 --> 01:54:37.681]  That's why it's absolutely horrible.
[01:54:45.786 --> 01:54:54.634]  I think Morrison and the Misfits singer, Glenn Danzig, are your two favorite ones that you like to parody.
[01:54:54.634 --> 01:54:56.095]  Well, yeah, they all sound like Elvis.
[01:54:56.095 --> 01:54:57.717]  Yeah, and Johnny Cash, I guess.
[01:54:57.717 --> 01:55:03.542]  Yeah, I like Johnny Cash, I like Elvis, and even though I don't like the lyrics of some of these guys, it's hard to not listen to.
[01:55:03.542 --> 01:55:05.624]  You're an Elvis guy, not a Beatles guy.
[01:55:05.624 --> 01:55:07.486]  I have, well no, I love the Beatles too.
[01:55:07.486 --> 01:55:08.207]  I love the Beach Boys.
[01:55:09.571 --> 01:55:16.034]  You know, John Lennon's... People can debate it, but I've been told directly, John Lennon's favorite, favorite band was the Beach Boys.
[01:55:16.034 --> 01:55:16.494]  Wow.
[01:55:16.494 --> 01:55:18.415]  Well, they have the best harmonies.
[01:55:18.415 --> 01:55:18.895]  Yeah.
[01:55:18.895 --> 01:55:20.476]  You can really hear the influence on John Lennon.
[01:55:23.012 --> 01:55:24.593]  Okay, I want to go to calls.
[01:55:24.593 --> 01:55:26.613]  I want to just keep you guys with us into the next hour.
[01:55:26.613 --> 01:55:27.474]  We're going to go to Brenton.
[01:55:27.474 --> 01:55:28.654]  We've been holding for an hour.
[01:55:28.654 --> 01:55:33.816]  We're going to go to Ben and Pharoah and Lewis and A.D.
[01:55:33.816 --> 01:55:35.057]  and others about the First Amendment.
[01:55:35.057 --> 01:55:46.501]  I do want to segue out of just what's happened to InfoWars because it's an ongoing thing where I showed that Pennsylvania-Pittsburgh, I guess, Gazette article where they had to retract that I told the guy to go kill three cops.
[01:55:46.561 --> 01:55:48.022]  And I told him, I'm going to sue you.
[01:55:48.022 --> 01:55:51.203]  We've got the computer now from the police, you know, the records.
[01:55:51.203 --> 01:55:54.145]  He was on our website saying he wanted to come after me and get me.
[01:55:54.145 --> 01:55:55.566]  He had nothing to do with me.
[01:55:55.566 --> 01:55:56.726]  How dare you say that?
[01:55:56.726 --> 01:55:57.867]  And so they had to retract.
[01:55:57.867 --> 01:56:00.308]  So then when I put the article up, they retracted.
[01:56:00.308 --> 01:56:02.809]  They did a copyright claim saying I can't show their article.
[01:56:02.809 --> 01:56:03.650]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:56:04.551 --> 01:56:08.415]  We're going to write a bunch about you, but then you can't show it.
[01:56:08.415 --> 01:56:09.757]  This is an interesting article.
[01:56:09.757 --> 01:56:13.541]  This guy was creating fake news and he wanted to get on your show, actually.
[01:56:13.541 --> 01:56:17.286]  That was his big goal with this thing called the jet-setting terrorist.
[01:56:17.286 --> 01:56:18.167]  I don't even know if you looked at this.
[01:56:18.167 --> 01:56:19.148]  But he wasn't successful.
[01:56:19.148 --> 01:56:19.949]  He wasn't successful.
[01:56:19.949 --> 01:56:24.114]  I think we... Somebody probably looked at it and said, oh, this looks like BS, and we passed on it.
[01:56:24.834 --> 01:56:29.721]  And, uh, but it's just interesting how, you know, these guys are allowed to say whatever they want.
[01:56:29.721 --> 01:56:34.929]  MSNBC comes and says, you're, you're not making bombs, you're making bombers, which is even worse.
[01:56:34.929 --> 01:56:41.037]  Well, what this guy wanted to do is like Cass Sunstein, and Drudge is linked to this article, how the left-wing activist manipulated the news to spread his message.
[01:56:43.347 --> 01:56:46.908]  That's how they infiltrate alternative media to try to discredit it with disinformation.
[01:56:46.908 --> 01:56:47.308]  Right.
[01:56:47.308 --> 01:56:51.470]  And Paul Watson is trying to police this as a one-man crew.
[01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:58.593]  He's doing a great job overall, but I think sometimes he goes too extreme towards not questioning.
[01:56:58.593 --> 01:57:02.934]  Like Charlie Hebdo, I don't think that was staged, but there was some evidence that was being manipulated.
[01:57:02.934 --> 01:57:04.455]  Paul doesn't think any of it was staged.
[01:57:04.835 --> 01:57:10.177]  And I'm not attacking Paul, I'm saying I disagree with some of what he's doing, he disagrees with some of what I'm doing.
[01:57:10.177 --> 01:57:12.998]  People always ask me, though, why do reporters say this, why do they say that?
[01:57:12.998 --> 01:57:19.400]  I try to hire smart people that are free thinkers, that are researching things, and then we're not all going to agree.
[01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:24.602]  And why can't we ask a question out loud and go, what about this, and let other people debate it?
[01:57:25.582 --> 01:57:32.945]  And put their two cents in, and then we just have an open society where we get to question things and go, well, maybe the sky isn't blue, maybe it's actually green.
[01:57:32.945 --> 01:57:33.206]  You know?
[01:57:33.206 --> 01:57:45.491]  You know, I want to invite this Posner guy on before this deteriorates, because if he gets his back up and stuff, I mean, I guess that's, you know, I'll be his Huckleberry.
[01:57:45.491 --> 01:57:46.992]  There you go.
[01:57:46.992 --> 01:57:47.952]  Knight, I've been ranting.
[01:57:47.952 --> 01:57:49.133]  Anything else you want to add before we go to break?
[01:57:49.844 --> 01:57:57.733]  Well, I think it's interesting, back in September you had Wolfgang Helbig on and he was talking about the fact that the FBI reported that there were no murders in Newtown.
[01:57:57.733 --> 01:58:02.097]  And he said he called the FBI office and they said, well, we were asked not to put that on our statistics.
[01:58:02.097 --> 01:58:05.821]  And then they spun it like we made it up, because the FBI responded later.
[01:58:06.502 --> 01:58:10.624]  You know, there's a lot of stuff that is very, very, very suspicious about this.
[01:58:10.624 --> 01:58:20.850]  And I gotta say that when it comes to 9-11, some of the most ardent people investigating the government's official story are people who lost family members there, because they want to get to the bottom of it.
[01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:29.015]  And if they don't want to question some of these anomalies here, if they just want to come after people who do investigation, if they come after the company to sue them,
[01:58:29.575 --> 01:58:32.077]  That makes me question the motives of the families.
[01:58:32.077 --> 01:58:33.817]  Because from the very beginning this looked fishy.
[01:58:33.817 --> 01:58:34.278]  We all said it.
[01:58:34.278 --> 01:58:36.799]  They have no right to blame Bushmaster for what happened.
[01:58:36.799 --> 01:58:39.220]  I mean, blame the fact that the guy was on drugs.
[01:58:39.220 --> 01:58:40.921]  I mean, psychotropics are directly linked.
[01:58:40.921 --> 01:58:43.223]  The insert says it can make you mass murder.
[01:58:43.223 --> 01:58:44.003]  Third hour coming up.
[01:58:44.003 --> 01:58:46.064]  What if it was even a real guy?
[01:58:46.064 --> 01:58:47.245]  Maybe it was an Easter Bunny.
[01:58:47.245 --> 01:58:47.345]  Yeah.
[01:58:49.338 --> 01:58:52.840]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:58:52.840 --> 01:59:01.085]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:59:01.085 --> 01:59:06.508]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:00:05.461 --> 02:00:06.782]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.782 --> 02:00:08.544]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.544 --> 02:00:10.306]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.306 --> 02:00:11.888]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.888 --> 02:00:13.429]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.429 --> 02:00:17.634]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.634 --> 02:00:21.678]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:28.062]  So busy defending the First Amendment in the last hour.
[02:00:28.062 --> 02:00:30.544]  I didn't plug any products or anything.
[02:00:30.544 --> 02:00:37.990]  If you believe in what we're doing, buy the products at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsHealth.com for the longevity products.
[02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.851]  You're the ones funding it.
[02:00:38.851 --> 02:00:39.752]  They're trying to shut us down.
[02:00:39.752 --> 02:00:40.512]  We need your support.
[02:00:40.512 --> 02:00:41.933]  We're just trying to be honest.
[02:00:41.933 --> 02:00:43.234]  We're just trying to find the truth.
[02:00:43.234 --> 02:00:46.617]  And the same folks that want to shut down the gun industry, that's really what this is.
[02:00:46.617 --> 02:00:47.498]  They're coming after us, David.
[02:00:47.498 --> 02:00:49.019]  I think you crystallized it best.
[02:00:49.019 --> 02:00:50.020]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.041]  I mean, who are these people?
[02:00:51.934 --> 02:00:53.956]  Exactly, when you- Bloomberg sock puppets.
[02:00:53.956 --> 02:00:54.896]  Exactly.
[02:00:54.896 --> 02:01:00.580]  All of the families, pretty much, I don't know how many families, but ten families went after the gun company to sue them.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:05.023]  Only two came after the school saying that there was- No ambulances, no helicopters.
[02:01:05.023 --> 02:01:06.144]  That's pretty much unheard of.
[02:01:06.144 --> 02:01:07.185]  Yeah, that's unheard of.
[02:01:07.185 --> 02:01:07.585]  Exactly.
[02:01:07.585 --> 02:01:08.706]  There's so many things.
[02:01:08.706 --> 02:01:14.450]  And Wolfgang Halbig, to me, has a lot of credibility because this is somebody who has a background in law enforcement.
[02:01:14.450 --> 02:01:18.233]  He was a principal- His company was advising major universities, making a lot of money.
[02:01:18.453 --> 02:01:19.073]  Exactly.
[02:01:19.073 --> 02:01:20.134]  All over national TV?
[02:01:20.134 --> 02:01:20.894]  Why would he do this?
[02:01:20.894 --> 02:01:22.755]  He was an investigator for school security.
[02:01:22.755 --> 02:01:23.655]  He was a consultant for that.
[02:01:23.655 --> 02:01:25.035]  He gave money to Sandy Hook.
[02:01:25.035 --> 02:01:28.216]  He gave money to the victims because he felt bad about this.
[02:01:28.216 --> 02:01:32.058]  And then he started asking a few questions and they started attacking him.
[02:01:32.058 --> 02:01:36.539]  And when you start asking questions and you get attacked, then you know you're near something.
[02:01:36.539 --> 02:01:38.540]  You're near a source of fire somewhere.
[02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:42.865]  Yeah, he was asking questions, trying to get information about it, and they were stonewalling him.
[02:01:42.865 --> 02:01:48.171]  Then he got, uh, the highway patrol in Florida came to his front door and local law enforcement.
[02:01:48.171 --> 02:01:48.711]  And threatened him.
[02:01:48.711 --> 02:01:53.056]  And threatened him, saying that they'd been sent by people in Connecticut.
[02:01:53.056 --> 02:01:53.196]  So...
[02:01:53.837 --> 02:01:55.338]  Tell him he better watch it.
[02:01:55.338 --> 02:01:56.378]  Exactly.
[02:01:56.378 --> 02:01:57.218]  We just put up the article.
[02:01:57.218 --> 02:02:00.000]  It said bad things will happen if you continue looking at it.
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:03.221]  And he's got some very good questions that deserve to be answered.
[02:02:03.221 --> 02:02:04.381]  They're not answering those questions.
[02:02:04.381 --> 02:02:10.164]  So like I said, from the very beginning, we knew that the government was going to use this as a springboard to attack the Second Amendment.
[02:02:10.564 --> 02:02:19.631]  From the very beginning, it looked like there were some fishy things about it, so perhaps this was something that the government had staged as a false flag, perhaps there were people that were being controlled in that aspect.
[02:02:19.631 --> 02:02:23.535]  The question in my mind from the beginning was, were the parents complicit?
[02:02:23.535 --> 02:02:32.542]  I didn't even ask that question, because in the past we've seen situations like 9-11, there's never any question whether the people that were victims in the buildings were complicit in what had happened.
[02:02:32.922 --> 02:02:36.344]  But in this one, people started bringing that up, and I poo-pooed that initially.
[02:02:36.344 --> 02:02:45.528]  But I tell you, as things go on, as we see these people try to shut down the Second Amendment, try to shut down the First Amendment, I have to start asking, what's going on with these families?
[02:02:45.528 --> 02:02:45.848]  I agree.
[02:02:45.848 --> 02:02:48.130]  Let's go to Brenton.
[02:02:48.130 --> 02:02:48.890]  Have they been threatened?
[02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:50.231]  Who knows?
[02:02:50.231 --> 02:02:52.172]  Brenton in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[02:02:52.172 --> 02:02:52.712]  Thanks for holding.
[02:02:54.042 --> 02:02:55.783]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:02:55.783 --> 02:02:57.844]  I discovered you five years ago and I've never looked back.
[02:02:57.844 --> 02:02:59.065]  Thank you for doing what you do.
[02:02:59.065 --> 02:03:01.766]  Thank you, brother.
[02:03:01.766 --> 02:03:05.428]  You asked the question, why don't they want you looking into Sandy Hook?
[02:03:05.428 --> 02:03:07.729]  I looked into this deeply a couple months ago.
[02:03:07.729 --> 02:03:09.750]  I just really wanted to understand it.
[02:03:09.750 --> 02:03:13.232]  I'm so glad that you're back on the case.
[02:03:13.232 --> 02:03:17.614]  This is what I call a media manufactured event.
[02:03:19.854 --> 02:03:22.256]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:03:22.256 --> 02:03:30.363]  It's almost, it's so obvious that, in my opinion, I'm practicing my First Amendment here, it did not happen.
[02:03:30.363 --> 02:03:37.449]  And I just challenge anyone to... And are you going to say that Bill Clinton never lied?
[02:03:37.449 --> 02:03:43.714]  Or are you going to say that Brian Williams didn't command a helicopter that took out 17,000 Al Qaeda forces?
[02:03:43.714 --> 02:03:45.495]  Or that Private Lynch wasn't a hoax?
[02:03:45.495 --> 02:03:47.217]  Or that Pat Tillman's murder wasn't a cover-up?
[02:03:49.478 --> 02:03:54.402]  Uh, well, you know, I probably don't have enough time to go into all those, but I'll tell you, it's so, uh, interesting.
[02:03:54.402 --> 02:03:55.883]  I mean, sir, it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:03:55.883 --> 02:03:57.264]  You don't question Brian Williams.
[02:03:57.264 --> 02:03:57.745]  He did it.
[02:03:57.745 --> 02:03:59.907]  He commanded the helicopter.
[02:03:59.907 --> 02:04:04.831]  He caught the RPG with his hand and threw it back at Al-Qaeda.
[02:04:04.831 --> 02:04:05.591]  Right.
[02:04:05.591 --> 02:04:11.796]  And he took, he had a can of spinach, and he went, I'm strong to the finish, cause I eats my spinach.
[02:04:11.796 --> 02:04:15.399]  I'm Popeye the Sailor Man.
[02:04:15.399 --> 02:04:15.980]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:16.980]  I'm going to hold you over, brother.
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:18.101]  I'm being silly here.
[02:04:18.101 --> 02:04:18.482]  Go ahead.
[02:04:19.397 --> 02:04:24.285]  Yeah, Sandy Hook to me is, it represents something.
[02:04:24.285 --> 02:04:28.852]  It represents a watershed, a potential watershed moment for
[02:04:30.041 --> 02:04:31.662]  To wake up a lot of people.
[02:04:31.662 --> 02:04:33.163]  And that's what they're worried about.
[02:04:33.163 --> 02:04:33.824]  Oh, I agree.
[02:04:33.824 --> 02:04:36.445]  And this Brian Williams is that as well.
[02:04:36.445 --> 02:04:36.825]  Stay there.
[02:04:36.825 --> 02:04:38.967]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to have you finish your point.
[02:04:38.967 --> 02:04:42.029]  And we're going to respond to that watershed event.
[02:04:42.029 --> 02:04:46.612]  Look, they may have killed kids there, but they got blue screens, green screens.
[02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:47.952]  They got kids going in circles.
[02:04:47.952 --> 02:04:48.893]  They caught a guy in the woods.
[02:04:48.893 --> 02:04:49.934]  They covered that up.
[02:04:49.934 --> 02:04:51.014]  They didn't call in the helicopters.
[02:04:51.014 --> 02:04:52.295]  They had the ambulance to sit there.
[02:04:52.295 --> 02:04:57.859]  You know, there's this whole schizophrenic group that thinks everything's actors, but sometimes there are actors and it looks like that.
[02:04:59.642 --> 02:05:03.303]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[02:05:03.303 --> 02:05:07.584]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[02:05:07.584 --> 02:05:09.364]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:05:09.364 --> 02:05:17.206]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and .308 sniper rounds, is reasonably priced, and fully legal.
[02:05:17.206 --> 02:05:18.346]  But for how long?
[02:05:18.346 --> 02:05:20.566]  Go to InfidelBodyArmor.com.
[02:05:20.566 --> 02:05:24.987]  Spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L BodyArmor.com.
[02:05:24.987 --> 02:05:26.848]  Infidel Body Armor.
[02:05:26.848 --> 02:05:27.808]  Just won't quit.
[02:05:29.161 --> 02:05:32.663]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:32.663 --> 02:05:40.908]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:05:40.908 --> 02:05:46.332]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[02:05:46.332 --> 02:05:48.853]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[02:05:48.853 --> 02:05:50.975]  We now have the synergistic solution.

[02:06:15.872 --> 02:06:23.896]  You don't have to be a doctor to know the fall and winter months are the most dangerous time of year in North America when it comes to you and your family's health.
[02:06:24.136 --> 02:06:33.783]  Infowarslife.com is very excited to announce our biggest run yet of silver bullet colloidal silver exclusively available at Infowarslife.com.

[02:06:58.806 --> 02:07:02.191]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:07:02.191 --> 02:07:05.696]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:07:05.696 --> 02:07:11.785]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:07:11.785 --> 02:07:13.187]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:07:13.187 --> 02:07:15.310]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:07:15.390 --> 02:07:16.951]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:07:16.951 --> 02:07:21.736]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:07:21.736 --> 02:07:26.340]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:28.982]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[02:07:28.982 --> 02:07:37.049]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month, we're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:38.731]  The sale is only running for the month?
[02:07:39.051 --> 02:07:43.793]  20% off and there's a lot of other powerful specials at Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:43.793 --> 02:07:45.694]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:07:45.694 --> 02:07:48.595]  Celebrating human potential in the month of February.
[02:07:48.595 --> 02:07:53.097]  Visit Infowarslife.com to find this special and many others in the month of February.
[02:07:53.097 --> 02:07:55.678]  Again, Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:08:13.917 --> 02:08:15.078]  Big Brother.
[02:08:15.078 --> 02:08:16.958]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:16.958 --> 02:08:18.599]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:18.599 --> 02:08:20.120]  You want answers?
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:21.760]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:25.442]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:40.032]  We are back, well into the third hour now.
[02:08:40.032 --> 02:08:44.293]  We're going to News Blitz, which I hardly ever actually institute.
[02:08:44.293 --> 02:08:46.234]  But when I do, it's interesting.
[02:08:46.234 --> 02:08:55.677]  Where I try to go over a whole bunch of topics, get quick responses from our guest panel of Rob Dew and of course, David Knight, who are in the studio with us here today.
[02:08:56.737 --> 02:09:04.360]  Anybody out there listening on AM or FM radio can simply go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and find the free video feed.
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:10.402]  It is essential to counter all the censors out there and in your email byline or at the bottom.
[02:09:12.159 --> 02:09:29.737]  Instead of, you know, signing off Molon Labe, you can sign off Molon Labe, Infowars.com forward slash show or join the resistance, Infowars.com forward slash show or find the truth, Infowars.com forward slash show or forbidden information, Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:09:31.353 --> 02:09:37.380]  I'm tempted to actually put up billboards if I had the money that said, ForbiddenInformationInfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:41.705]  Or share your PrisonPlanet.tv membership with 19 other friends.
[02:09:41.705 --> 02:09:42.886]  And you can all be on at the same time.
[02:09:42.886 --> 02:09:44.148]  I mean, they want to shut us down.
[02:09:44.148 --> 02:09:45.649]  We're in a real war.
[02:09:45.649 --> 02:09:48.412]  And we're one of the key areas of resistance.
[02:09:48.412 --> 02:09:51.996]  And they don't want to crush us too obviously, because then that would make us martyrs.
[02:09:52.577 --> 02:09:55.759]  They just want to kill us politically and sap us in death by a thousand cuts.
[02:09:55.759 --> 02:09:58.081]  Well, we're still growing, moving forward exponentially.
[02:09:58.081 --> 02:10:00.322]  That's why we've entered the maximum danger zone.
[02:10:00.322 --> 02:10:01.283]  I can feel it.
[02:10:01.283 --> 02:10:02.644]  I can intellectually see it.
[02:10:02.644 --> 02:10:05.105]  We need people to go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:10:05.105 --> 02:10:06.787]  I didn't even plug this last hour.
[02:10:06.787 --> 02:10:11.710]  Buy the books, buy the t-shirts, buy the nutraceuticals, buy the high quality products, the water filters.
[02:10:11.710 --> 02:10:14.512]  Shopping with the good guys is what makes all this possible.
[02:10:14.512 --> 02:10:15.552]  I want to thank you for that.
[02:10:15.552 --> 02:10:18.094]  I want to run through these callers that have been holding for a while.
[02:10:18.094 --> 02:10:21.596]  Brenton and Farrow and all these other folks.
[02:10:21.596 --> 02:10:22.157]  And then I want to
[02:10:23.037 --> 02:10:25.078]  Get into all the stories we haven't hit.
[02:10:25.078 --> 02:10:28.418]  Ground troops are necessary to defeat ISIS.
[02:10:28.418 --> 02:10:33.100]  Ron Paul says it gives him basically worldwide war powers.
[02:10:33.100 --> 02:10:36.781]  We're also going to get into just a whole bunch of news I'm going to race through with.
[02:10:36.781 --> 02:10:38.161]  I got a big comment on that by the way.
[02:10:38.161 --> 02:10:39.801]  And to get your takes on that.
[02:10:39.801 --> 02:10:42.102]  But right now we're talking about the full-out assault on the First Amendment.
[02:10:43.187 --> 02:10:45.088]  Restricting the web in the name of net neutrality.
[02:10:45.088 --> 02:10:48.090]  We support net neutrality, but this isn't that with Obama.
[02:10:48.090 --> 02:10:49.571]  All this garbage.
[02:10:49.571 --> 02:10:53.653]  But Brenton, finish up your point about Sandy Hook.
[02:10:53.653 --> 02:10:54.634]  Sure.
[02:10:54.634 --> 02:10:59.796]  Yeah, it's my opinion, they can't stand the slaves talking to each other.
[02:10:59.796 --> 02:11:02.598]  And we talk to each other over the internet.
[02:11:02.598 --> 02:11:04.319]  They can't control the narrative.
[02:11:04.319 --> 02:11:07.741]  And Sandy Hook is a blatant example of how
[02:11:08.533 --> 02:11:13.536]  They are manufacturing reality, and all people have to do is just go, look at the evidence.
[02:11:13.536 --> 02:11:15.597]  It's overwhelming.
[02:11:15.597 --> 02:11:19.920]  And once people come to that same conclusion that I did, it's all over.
[02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:20.800]  It is ridiculous.
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:23.422]  I mean, it looks like a school play.
[02:11:23.422 --> 02:11:26.384]  It's so badly done.
[02:11:26.384 --> 02:11:27.845]  But maybe that's what reality looks like.
[02:11:27.845 --> 02:11:29.065]  Maybe reality looks totally fake.
[02:11:29.065 --> 02:11:30.927]  Of course, in my experience, it looks real.
[02:11:30.927 --> 02:11:32.788]  Reality is crisp and real.
[02:11:32.788 --> 02:11:34.149]  You know it when you see it.
[02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:35.890]  And this comes off like a bad school play.
[02:11:36.812 --> 02:11:38.833]  Or Obama's brochure took it with multiple layers.
[02:11:38.833 --> 02:11:42.154]  Yeah, and why did they publish that in multiple layers?
[02:11:42.154 --> 02:11:49.318]  And then say they hadn't, and then use the typewriter function where all the letters are identical, but they're just meant to look like typewriter.
[02:11:49.318 --> 02:11:52.559]  We pointed that out, and a year later, top forensic experts said what we said.
[02:11:52.559 --> 02:11:54.360]  We pointed it out the day it came out, too.
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:57.141]  I remember specifically bringing this up to you.
[02:11:57.141 --> 02:12:02.364]  I said, look, it was one of our ad guys took it apart, and I said, look, it comes apart in all these layers.
[02:12:03.144 --> 02:12:04.424]  We actually broke that.
[02:12:04.424 --> 02:12:06.605]  Shooting that video, a million views.
[02:12:06.605 --> 02:12:08.525]  Over a million views now.
[02:12:08.525 --> 02:12:12.726]  Same thing with our other video, why people think Sandy Hook is a hoax.
[02:12:12.726 --> 02:12:24.369]  I mean, it came out about a month later, looking at all the evidence, and when the blue screen came out, the green screen video, and we added it up with all the other stuff, where the mainstream media just says, we're not going to show you this right now because we don't know what you're going to see.
[02:12:25.369 --> 02:12:26.750]  Remember that?
[02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:28.732]  We're not going to show you Sandy Hook.
[02:12:28.732 --> 02:12:30.533]  They've never done that before or since.
[02:12:30.533 --> 02:12:32.354]  We're not going to cut the cameras to this.
[02:12:32.354 --> 02:12:32.654]  Right.
[02:12:32.654 --> 02:12:36.017]  Because I guess they hadn't got everybody lined up yet for the opening.
[02:12:36.017 --> 02:12:37.358]  Well, no, that was a different school shooting.
[02:12:37.358 --> 02:12:38.318]  That came out that day.
[02:12:38.318 --> 02:12:39.179]  That was in Houston.
[02:12:39.179 --> 02:12:39.599]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:39.599 --> 02:12:44.102]  And you're like, look, they just said we're not going to show you any of this live footage because we don't know what you might see.
[02:12:44.102 --> 02:12:45.944]  And then we cover Oklahoma City.
[02:12:45.944 --> 02:12:47.405]  Well, they covered up a bunch of Sandy Hook, too.
[02:12:47.405 --> 02:12:49.006]  They covered up a live helicopter feed.
[02:12:49.006 --> 02:12:49.706]  Oh, sure.
[02:12:49.706 --> 02:12:51.067]  But, I mean, this video here, it's...
[02:12:52.168 --> 02:12:54.150]  It's a long video.
[02:12:54.150 --> 02:13:01.135]  It's almost 20 minutes, but it covers just the waterfront of things where it just looks all these different news events.
[02:13:01.135 --> 02:13:08.040]  And if they can shut down the Alex Jones Channel and all the other channels that are connected, they'll shut down hundreds of these videos looking at this.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:14.544]  Well, and I think that's why they went after the little people first, and they went and knocked them off, because this was months ago, back when the anniversary was happening.
[02:13:14.544 --> 02:13:20.549]  We started talking about it again, and we had the filmmakers on that made a couple of the filmmakers, and we had the big debate.
[02:13:21.397 --> 02:13:25.039]  And after that, it kind of died down for a while, but now it's picked up again.
[02:13:25.039 --> 02:13:26.639]  I guess one of the trolls saw it.
[02:13:26.639 --> 02:13:28.240]  All you were doing was talking about a news article.
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:28.540]  Yeah.
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:29.961]  We weren't even showing video.
[02:13:29.961 --> 02:13:30.341]  Yeah.
[02:13:30.341 --> 02:13:32.242]  That's what's so wild about this.
[02:13:32.242 --> 02:13:33.662]  We're not supposed to even talk.
[02:13:33.662 --> 02:13:34.403]  Yeah.
[02:13:34.403 --> 02:13:35.283]  We just have to sit here.
[02:13:35.283 --> 02:13:36.984]  We're showing pictures from the BBC.
[02:13:36.984 --> 02:13:37.724]  Not our head.
[02:13:37.724 --> 02:13:39.905]  The main French news agency.
[02:13:39.905 --> 02:13:45.727]  This is not showing pictures of what people have photoshopped on their Facebook page.
[02:13:45.727 --> 02:13:47.448]  And no one's saying it's photoshopped.
[02:13:47.748 --> 02:13:47.928]  No.
[02:13:47.928 --> 02:13:52.229]  They just say we're showing Fox News footage when we're showing a BBC News website.
[02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.610]  Right.
[02:13:52.610 --> 02:13:55.710]  I mean, it's just, it's a untrue filing.
[02:13:55.710 --> 02:13:58.251]  Oh, by the way, they brought Fox into it.
[02:13:58.251 --> 02:14:00.392]  There was absolutely nothing in the article or what I had to say.
[02:14:00.392 --> 02:14:01.532]  I'm going to get my earpiece fixed.
[02:14:01.532 --> 02:14:02.553]  I keep forgetting to tell the guys.
[02:14:02.553 --> 02:14:03.373]  It just keeps popping out.
[02:14:03.373 --> 02:14:04.413]  I think it's too tight.
[02:14:04.413 --> 02:14:04.713]  Whatever.
[02:14:04.713 --> 02:14:07.074]  It's an ongoing issue.
[02:14:07.074 --> 02:14:08.134]  I want to go back to the calls.
[02:14:08.134 --> 02:14:10.215]  Thank you so much, Brenton.
[02:14:10.215 --> 02:14:11.395]  Let's talk to A.D.
[02:14:11.395 --> 02:14:12.335]  in Delaware.
[02:14:12.335 --> 02:14:13.336]  A.D., you're on the air.
[02:14:13.336 --> 02:14:13.636]  Welcome.
[02:14:15.370 --> 02:14:18.051]  Hey Alex, you know, I think people need to understand something.
[02:14:18.051 --> 02:14:22.972]  We're involved in a heavy onslaught of EMF, ELF, mind control.
[02:14:22.972 --> 02:14:29.213]  Paul Hellyer and Dr. John H. Hall talk about this.
[02:14:29.213 --> 02:14:39.715]  But you know, these crisis actors, the same woman that is the lawyer for the guy Holmes there in Aurora, she's also involved in the Boston bombing there.
[02:14:39.715 --> 02:14:42.236]  I mean, you look at the guy, he's got his legs all sticking out.
[02:14:42.236 --> 02:14:43.096]  He's the same guy that
[02:14:43.516 --> 02:14:56.984]  You know, I mean, I could swear that I saw Steven Spielberg there, but he had his leg shot off months earlier in Iraq or Afghanistan, and there he is with his legs all sticking out, and he's not even crying with perfect hair.
[02:14:56.984 --> 02:15:03.427]  But you know what really bothers me is they're going to crush dissent, and they're going to bring in the darkest days we've ever seen.
[02:15:03.427 --> 02:15:09.751]  My big thing right now is following these DOD contractors, Brown and Boot, and the Bunnell Group,
[02:15:10.371 --> 02:15:13.734]  Running heroin for the last God knows how long.
[02:15:13.734 --> 02:15:16.117]  Bush and Cheney directly involved.
[02:15:16.117 --> 02:15:19.600]  This is what they're afraid of because the truth is out there.
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:26.566]  And believe me, like you've always said, when you're over the target, you're going to get the most flack and they're going to attack.
[02:15:26.566 --> 02:15:29.769]  And I'm telling you, we got to bring the Infowars to the Beltway, my man.
[02:15:30.450 --> 02:15:35.751]  Well, expanding on that, they staged Fast and Furious to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:15:35.751 --> 02:15:36.692]  That's just admitted.
[02:15:36.692 --> 02:15:40.093]  Came out, CBS News got the documents, not Alex Jones.
[02:15:40.093 --> 02:15:41.813]  Not Drudge Report, not World Net Daily.
[02:15:41.813 --> 02:15:43.133]  I mean, that's just admitted.
[02:15:43.133 --> 02:15:44.234]  It was to blame the Second Amendment.
[02:15:44.234 --> 02:15:46.514]  So they do false flags.
[02:15:46.514 --> 02:15:48.315]  We know they had a drill in Boston that day.
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:52.321]  Major issues with that.
[02:15:52.321 --> 02:15:57.122]  And we know that they've used other drills before to basically simulate false flags.
[02:15:57.122 --> 02:16:00.743]  That's an Operation Northwoods.
[02:16:00.743 --> 02:16:06.445]  But you look at just the whole way this was rolled out, the media was ready to pounce.
[02:16:06.445 --> 02:16:08.105]  It was their big push.
[02:16:08.105 --> 02:16:09.666]  But if you look at Aurora,
[02:16:11.365 --> 02:16:13.006]  That's what was really staged.
[02:16:13.006 --> 02:16:21.311]  I mean, this guy was in a secret government program in Brain Interface with DARPA, a literal mind control program.
[02:16:21.311 --> 02:16:22.532]  His whole house was paid for.
[02:16:22.532 --> 02:16:27.976]  They covered up what was in his house.
[02:16:27.976 --> 02:16:37.282]  The former head of the Air Force Psychiatry Department was transferred a year before and basically had notebooks with him and spent multiple days a week with him.
[02:16:38.799 --> 02:16:43.162]  Uh, and then he was in the jail cell saying, I've been drugged, I'm under mind control.
[02:16:43.162 --> 02:16:45.323]  And then they lied and said, no, the inmates are wrong.
[02:16:45.323 --> 02:16:48.204]  He wasn't in general area with him the first day, but it turned out he was.
[02:16:48.204 --> 02:16:50.546]  And you just, you look at that, I mean.
[02:16:50.546 --> 02:16:58.250]  Well, they found him in the apartment, in the parking lot, kind of babbling and warning people that his apartment or his house was rigged up with explosives.
[02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:59.751]  It's like, where did he get the explosives?
[02:16:59.751 --> 02:17:01.352]  Where'd he get all the training to do all this stuff?
[02:17:01.352 --> 02:17:02.692]  This is a guy who's a psychologist.
[02:17:04.133 --> 02:17:05.654]  But Alex, you're talking about this.
[02:17:05.654 --> 02:17:10.858]  Fast and Furious was set up to make a case that we needed to have a treaty, a U.N.
[02:17:10.858 --> 02:17:14.920]  Arms Trade Treaty, that would prohibit the crossing of arms over the border.
[02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:18.343]  They were coming after the Second Amendment, but that was specifically the point.
[02:17:18.343 --> 02:17:21.525]  And I was in New York to cover this U.N.
[02:17:21.525 --> 02:17:24.327]  thing, where they were going to have the vote on the U.N.
[02:17:24.327 --> 02:17:31.972]  Arms Trade Treaty, and it was a week before that, not even a week, it was the 20th, and I think the vote was scheduled on the 25th or something.
[02:17:32.722 --> 02:17:37.227]  They had this to try to get the narrative back because Fast and Furious had blown up in their face.
[02:17:37.227 --> 02:17:40.911]  And so a matter of days before they're going to have this vote to do the U.N.
[02:17:40.911 --> 02:17:44.354]  Arms Trade Treaty, they have this shooting in Aurora, Colorado.
[02:17:44.354 --> 02:17:50.801]  It was absolutely set up to turn the narrative back to a gun control mentality after it had blown up in their face.
[02:17:50.801 --> 02:17:51.662]  Well, that's it.
[02:17:51.662 --> 02:17:54.145]  And then you look at Aurora.
[02:17:55.080 --> 02:17:59.824]  And the things that came out of it, they had a bunch of laws they were trying to pass, and they did right at that time.
[02:17:59.824 --> 02:18:08.470]  We've responded with recalls there, but you can just see the timing, see the rollouts, see how they've done this over and over again, and then you've got to question.
[02:18:08.470 --> 02:18:10.852]  You've got to look at this because these are known liars.
[02:18:10.852 --> 02:18:12.293]  It's like Brian Williams.
[02:18:12.293 --> 02:18:14.274]  You can't believe anything comes out of his mouth.
[02:18:14.274 --> 02:18:18.798]  Well, this system's been caught lying more times than Brian Williams has even twinkled in his eye.
[02:18:18.798 --> 02:18:20.579]  I mean, it's amazing.
[02:18:20.579 --> 02:18:22.380]  A.D., thank you so much.
[02:18:22.380 --> 02:18:24.162]  Pharoah in Montana, you're on the air.
[02:18:26.252 --> 02:18:26.952]  Alex.
[02:18:26.952 --> 02:18:28.493]  Hey, brother.
[02:18:28.493 --> 02:18:33.315]  We really need to really brainwash people into thinking guns in a totally different way.
[02:18:33.315 --> 02:18:35.857]  A positive way.
[02:18:35.857 --> 02:18:39.038]  Yeah, that's what the Attorney General said, yeah.
[02:18:39.038 --> 02:18:49.823]  So, Sandy Hook, Aurora shooting, all of these things are really affecting the consciousness, the psyche of the general public in that way that they're meaning to.
[02:18:49.823 --> 02:18:53.745]  The only way to fight against this is to spread awareness of this type of brainwashing.
[02:18:54.150 --> 02:19:03.057]  It's meant to create perceived guilt that can then be placed on all of us, like, vote for Obama, carry your racist, turn your guns in or you want to murder children.
[02:19:03.057 --> 02:19:12.704]  I think it's backfiring though, because you see all the pro-gun people, all the pro-freedom people are closing ranks and going, look, we've got to stick together, we've got to keep putting out this narrative that guns save people.
[02:19:12.704 --> 02:19:13.465]  All the time.
[02:19:13.465 --> 02:19:19.950]  And statistics show we're winning the fight for the hearts and minds, so the globalists are still just going ahead with the anti-gun movement regardless.
[02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:20.991]  Caller, what else do you want to get to?
[02:19:22.745 --> 02:19:24.949]  Well, I've started a radio show in Montana.
[02:19:24.949 --> 02:19:27.715]  The Intel Scanner on MTRadio.net.
[02:19:27.715 --> 02:19:28.817]  Anyone can tune into that.
[02:19:28.817 --> 02:19:30.580]  We promote liberty, freedom.
[02:19:32.573 --> 02:19:33.994]  This must be the day of plugs.
[02:19:33.994 --> 02:19:36.055]  I don't mind listeners plugging their media outlets.
[02:19:36.055 --> 02:19:36.595]  I think that's great.
[02:19:36.595 --> 02:19:40.777]  Everybody should be an activist, but I think like 80% of the callers today like plug their radio show.
[02:19:40.777 --> 02:19:42.198]  That's awesome.
[02:19:42.198 --> 02:19:49.881]  But what I really want to do is get your take on not just Sandy Hook, SOPA, CISPA, so-called net neutrality, the move.
[02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.622]  Why do you, the internet kill switch is being announced.
[02:19:52.622 --> 02:19:54.383]  EAS Obama alerts.
[02:19:54.383 --> 02:19:55.663]  What are they getting ready for?
[02:19:55.663 --> 02:19:56.184]  Stay with us.
[02:19:56.184 --> 02:19:57.824]  More calls than the big news blitz.
[02:19:57.824 --> 02:19:58.445]  Bottom of the hour.
[02:19:59.905 --> 02:20:01.086]  It's happening again.
[02:20:01.086 --> 02:20:04.688]  The Feds are trying to ban your freedom to own body armor.
[02:20:04.688 --> 02:20:08.110]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:12.172]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.

[02:20:29.164 --> 02:20:38.472]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:38.472 --> 02:20:39.252]  This capitalism?
[02:20:39.252 --> 02:20:45.437]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[02:22:07.434 --> 02:22:09.818]  But what happens when Mother Nature throws a curveball?
[02:22:12.632 --> 02:22:16.916]  Are you prepared to live without electricity or passable roads for weeks at a time?
[02:22:16.916 --> 02:22:19.017]  Do you even have a plan B?
[02:22:19.017 --> 02:22:22.320]  If you do, are you willing to bet your life on it?
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:23.540]  Children left with no home.
[02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:25.382]  And no one's coming to help them.
[02:22:25.382 --> 02:22:28.244]  The first step towards self-reliance in the face of disaster.

[02:24:40.659 --> 02:24:43.121]  I drug them in here, and I actually like having you guys in here.
[02:24:43.121 --> 02:24:45.602]  That would just change the format of the show, where you're in here every day.
[02:24:45.602 --> 02:24:47.664]  We just do that.
[02:24:47.664 --> 02:24:54.809]  Let's get a couple of well-spoken, lovely ladies in here, like Leanne, and round off the whole broadcast that way.
[02:24:54.809 --> 02:24:58.271]  Let's go ahead and go to Lewis in Massachusetts.
[02:24:58.271 --> 02:24:58.931]  You're on the air.
[02:24:58.931 --> 02:24:59.532]  Thanks for calling.
[02:25:00.859 --> 02:25:01.760]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:25:01.760 --> 02:25:03.881]  Good, brother.
[02:25:03.881 --> 02:25:07.665]  So first of all, I just want to say thank you for playing the Misfits earlier in the show.
[02:25:07.665 --> 02:25:09.746]  You like that?
[02:25:09.746 --> 02:25:12.308]  That's some interesting music, huh?
[02:25:12.308 --> 02:25:21.215]  Yeah, but anyways, what I wanted to talk about is, I went back and I watched your debate with Piers Morgan, and it's been like two years since that happened.
[02:25:23.397 --> 02:25:30.883]  But I think now we're really beginning to see the model of controlling the debate being put into full effect.
[02:25:30.883 --> 02:25:33.285]  Especially with political correctness.
[02:25:33.285 --> 02:25:37.989]  I think political correctness has gotten out of control, Alex.
[02:25:37.989 --> 02:25:39.190]  We really gotta do something about this.
[02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:45.455]  And notice they say, you're hurtful questioning the official story, so you need to be arrested, they say on their website.
[02:25:45.455 --> 02:25:46.676]  You need to be shut down.
[02:25:46.676 --> 02:25:49.218]  And you're not allowed to do that.
[02:25:49.218 --> 02:25:50.920]  These are totalitarians, in my view.
[02:25:52.045 --> 02:25:58.507]  Exactly, and I think they're using political correctness as a tool to limit our free speech.
[02:25:58.507 --> 02:26:07.050]  I think that's how they're clamping down on the First Amendment and chopping it up is with political correctness.
[02:26:07.050 --> 02:26:11.371]  Because by using political correctness, they can dictate what we can and what we cannot talk about.
[02:26:13.447 --> 02:26:16.608]  Yeah, that's the point I wanted to make.
[02:26:16.608 --> 02:26:19.830]  Well, they're moving right now, Lewis, and that's a question for the panel.
[02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:20.650]  We'll go back to calls.
[02:26:20.650 --> 02:26:20.990]  Thank you.
[02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:24.672]  Lewis, why do you think they're moving so quick right now?
[02:26:24.672 --> 02:26:35.716]  I think you see this any time you get a group that, you know, I like the Democrats or these people that want to say or the left, they want to create big government to control everything.
[02:26:35.716 --> 02:26:40.859]  And the right seems to be like they just want to let businesses be more or less
[02:26:42.279 --> 02:26:44.780]  Squeeze the little guy and let giant corporations run everything.
[02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:47.740]  So you got these two factions going off.
[02:26:47.740 --> 02:26:52.081]  And so anytime you get these left sides in, they want to go after what you're saying.
[02:26:52.081 --> 02:26:53.202]  Because this happened in Clinton.
[02:26:53.202 --> 02:26:57.583]  And I remember towards college, at the end of college, that's when I was in, when Clinton was in.
[02:26:57.583 --> 02:26:59.483]  Well, I couldn't write certain things in the paper.
[02:26:59.483 --> 02:27:00.443]  They would squash stories.
[02:27:00.443 --> 02:27:01.563]  Like, you can't say that.
[02:27:01.563 --> 02:27:02.744]  That's not PC.
[02:27:02.744 --> 02:27:03.604]  Like, what are you talking about?
[02:27:03.604 --> 02:27:03.944]  Not PC.
[02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:10.174]  You know, and it's their excuse to censor and control from a fake moral high ground.
[02:27:10.174 --> 02:27:11.395]  David, it's outrageous.
[02:27:11.395 --> 02:27:12.296]  We need to call them on it.
[02:27:12.296 --> 02:27:21.903]  We need to say that, look, there is real racism and it's too important to allow you to cry wolf so many times that that no longer becomes anything that we can use as a political weapon.
[02:27:21.903 --> 02:27:22.404]  Absolutely.
[02:27:22.404 --> 02:27:25.146]  They use that and they also use the safety issue.
[02:27:25.146 --> 02:27:26.487]  Always telling us we have to be safe.
[02:27:26.487 --> 02:27:28.929]  Now the meme is that the Internet is not safe.
[02:27:29.409 --> 02:27:30.790]  Free speech is not safe.
[02:27:30.790 --> 02:27:32.010]  Therefore, they must be controlled.
[02:27:32.010 --> 02:27:33.711]  Therefore, you must give up your liberty.
[02:27:33.711 --> 02:27:36.572]  That's what we're seeing here with these bogus claims that are being put out.
[02:27:36.572 --> 02:27:38.993]  That's what we see with the legal structure that's coming through.
[02:27:38.993 --> 02:27:41.535]  But you ask, why are they accelerating everything?
[02:27:41.535 --> 02:27:43.916]  I go back to the fourth turning by Strauss and Howe.
[02:27:43.916 --> 02:27:46.877]  There is a cycle in history.
[02:27:46.877 --> 02:27:52.499]  They think that they've discovered a certain kind of rhythm that you can see repeating over a certain period of time.
[02:27:52.499 --> 02:27:58.162]  We know that the elites have been talking for a long time about how 2020 to 2025 was going to be when everything was going to change.
[02:27:58.777 --> 02:28:03.940]  And we see, of course, with technological advances, everything is accelerating.
[02:28:03.940 --> 02:28:08.363]  And the technology is increasingly being used only for bad purposes.
[02:28:09.002 --> 02:28:11.704]  Just because you can build it doesn't mean you should in most cases.
[02:28:11.704 --> 02:28:18.628]  But the people who are controlling the technology, as Eisenhower has warned us, he warned us that the military was going to get it, but he also warned us about the universities.
[02:28:18.628 --> 02:28:20.270]  Yeah, they only play the military quote.
[02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:24.312]  He says a technological elite will rule us through the military-industrial complex.
[02:28:24.312 --> 02:28:26.174]  They will take over all research.
[02:28:26.174 --> 02:28:27.394]  They will take over the university.
[02:28:27.394 --> 02:28:30.997]  They will control the whole trajectory of humanity.
[02:28:30.997 --> 02:28:31.397]  Absolutely.
[02:28:31.397 --> 02:28:38.662]  When we look at this FOIA request that shows all the licenses that the FAA gave out for unmanned aerial vehicles used domestically,
[02:28:39.202 --> 02:28:47.187]  You can see a huge number of these are universities, of course, because they are rolling out the technology that's going to be used by the government.
[02:28:47.187 --> 02:28:48.087]  I have a real problem.
[02:28:48.087 --> 02:28:51.949]  Everybody's got problems with these MRAPs that are being given to police departments.
[02:28:51.949 --> 02:28:59.774]  I've got a problem with the fact that Homeland Security is using Predator B drones, which are called MQ-9 Reaper, hunter-killer drones.
[02:28:59.774 --> 02:29:04.917]  Why do we have law enforcement buying those and using them here domestically, flying them domestically?
[02:29:05.157 --> 02:29:07.699]  Are we going to have some kind of a disposition matrix?
[02:29:07.699 --> 02:29:10.480]  That's their euphemism for assassination kill list.
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:12.882]  Are we going to have a disposition matrix here in the United States?
[02:29:12.882 --> 02:29:14.483]  Is that what they're putting this in place for?
[02:29:14.483 --> 02:29:23.529]  I have a real problem with that, as I have a problem with the Bureau of Land Management getting the other kinds of drones that they can continuously fly and do very high resolution
[02:29:23.889 --> 02:29:31.572]  Monitoring of what's on the ground, so as we talked about in the last segment, so that they can go in and look for violations or look for resources.
[02:29:31.572 --> 02:29:43.436]  That's right, and notice when Nemo and others wrote articles four or five years ago when this was just rolling out, they wrote national articles saying it was a hoax, we were liars, because if we'd have caused a debate then, the program would have gotten killed.
[02:29:43.436 --> 02:29:43.857]  Yes.
[02:29:43.857 --> 02:29:50.459]  Now that it's ubiquitous and rolled out, they're like, of course the killer drones are here to keep you safe, we may have to murder you!
[02:29:50.459 --> 02:29:52.940]  More calls coming up, News Blitz, stay with us.
[02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:59.743]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.743 --> 02:30:05.867]  Used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[02:30:05.867 --> 02:30:18.173]  Introducing the new Infowarslife.com oil of oregano formulation, a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.
[02:30:18.413 --> 02:30:23.915]  We have now procured the most high quality and potent forms of oregano oil on the market.

[02:30:29.878 --> 02:30:34.820]  Extracted directly from the wild herb and sealed in easy to use capsules.
[02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:38.762]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[02:30:38.762 --> 02:30:44.985]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[02:30:45.365 --> 02:30:50.506]  This winter season, it's more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano.
[02:30:50.506 --> 02:30:54.227]  Now available in our limited first run at Infowarslife.com.
[02:30:54.227 --> 02:30:58.467]  That's Infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:30:58.467 --> 02:31:02.668]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:31:02.668 --> 02:31:06.189]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:31:06.189 --> 02:31:12.150]  What if we, the patriots, hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:31:12.270 --> 02:31:13.651]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:31:13.651 --> 02:31:15.873]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:31:15.873 --> 02:31:17.454]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:31:17.454 --> 02:31:22.238]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride and GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:31:22.238 --> 02:31:26.821]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:31:26.821 --> 02:31:29.463]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[02:31:59.168 --> 02:32:08.101]  What disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of mass pandemics, economic meltdowns, and violent food riots all at the same time?
[02:32:08.101 --> 02:32:14.691]  NASA has already set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century apocalypse is less than 13 months away.
[02:32:15.191 --> 02:32:18.673]  Former CIA Director James Woolsey says two-thirds of U.S.
[02:32:18.673 --> 02:32:20.314]  population could perish.
[02:32:20.314 --> 02:32:23.796]  In a matter of seconds, the world as we know it will cease to exist.
[02:32:23.796 --> 02:32:26.037]  The world's economy will be wiped out.
[02:32:26.037 --> 02:32:27.678]  Mass riots will follow.
[02:32:27.678 --> 02:32:29.859]  Ancient diseases will re-emerge.
[02:32:29.859 --> 02:32:33.941]  How will you shield yourself and your loved ones from this upcoming apocalypse?
[02:32:33.941 --> 02:32:39.604]  Go to darkestdays.info to find out proven methods of protecting yourself, your loved ones,
[02:32:39.904 --> 02:32:44.345]  And even your entire community when this worst case scenario unravels.
[02:32:44.345 --> 02:32:49.246]  That's D-A-R-K-E-S-T-D-A-Y-S dot I-N-F-O.
[02:32:49.246 --> 02:32:51.247]  DarkestDays.info.
[02:32:51.247 --> 02:32:56.148]  Go there before this life-saving information becomes unavailable to the large public.
[02:32:56.148 --> 02:32:59.369]  Go to DarkestDays.info now.
[02:32:59.369 --> 02:33:04.210]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[02:33:07.128 --> 02:33:16.312]  That's veteran Denver Police Officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the face six times.
[02:33:16.312 --> 02:33:20.694]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence.
[02:33:20.694 --> 02:33:22.875]  I'm observing what they're doing in the room.
[02:33:22.875 --> 02:33:23.195]  Save me!
[02:33:23.195 --> 02:33:25.616]  I don't understand what's going on!
[02:33:25.616 --> 02:33:34.880]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio, and other channels of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[02:33:35.874 --> 02:33:43.637]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government?
[02:33:43.637 --> 02:33:45.598]  How can you ask such a question?
[02:33:45.598 --> 02:33:48.119]  What difference at this point does it make?
[02:33:48.119 --> 02:33:55.223]  When a confident observer looks for signs of despotism in a community, he looks beyond fine words and noble phrases.
[02:33:55.223 --> 02:34:02.846]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just.
[02:34:03.996 --> 02:34:06.199]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[02:34:06.199 --> 02:34:07.581]  What I say, go.
[02:34:07.581 --> 02:34:07.781]  See?
[02:34:07.781 --> 02:34:12.667]  I'm the law around here.
[02:34:12.667 --> 02:34:14.890]  He came, you saw, he died.
[02:34:17.862 --> 02:34:24.547]  Yes, in modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly effective weapons.
[02:34:24.547 --> 02:34:26.348]  We just have to be repetitive about this.
[02:34:26.348 --> 02:34:33.813]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[02:34:33.813 --> 02:34:36.054]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[02:34:36.054 --> 02:34:37.736]  You really don't have to trust me.
[02:34:37.736 --> 02:34:38.536]  You shouldn't trust me.
[02:34:38.536 --> 02:34:42.619]  In fact, if I'm actually participating in that, I will taint the news.
[02:34:42.619 --> 02:34:45.841]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[02:34:47.783 --> 02:34:53.788]  Nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.
[02:34:53.788 --> 02:34:54.870]  I don't care if it's you.
[02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:58.933]  Well, we're going to do everything we can to help you.
[02:34:58.933 --> 02:35:03.017]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[02:35:03.017 --> 02:35:05.720]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:08.503]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:35:09.683 --> 02:35:23.213]  We probably got 25 just in the last year or so of these great promos that Jakari Jackson, Rob Jacobson, Darren McBreen, Rob Dew, David Knight, so many other people have made here.
[02:35:23.213 --> 02:35:25.855]  We ought to have a contest online on YouTube.
[02:35:25.855 --> 02:35:30.239]  I guess we're going to get shut down if the Sandy Hook people have their way.
[02:35:30.239 --> 02:35:31.039]  Which one's the best?
[02:35:31.039 --> 02:35:34.842]  Because I cannot tell myself which one is the best intro.
[02:35:34.842 --> 02:35:38.405]  Or just have a contest and let people make their own intro for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:39.269 --> 02:35:42.552]  There you go, but I've already got to do this contest on the billboards.
[02:35:42.552 --> 02:35:52.901]  I'm not complaining, it's just so many good ones get introduced, I don't know what... We did go through a dry spell, though, where we stopped doing contests for a while, and I wasn't complaining, because those contests, people don't realize how much work they take.
[02:35:52.901 --> 02:36:03.210]  We got to do our regular job, and then we have all this other information coming in that we got to sift through, so... But I do appreciate all the work people put out there, and the love that people have for freedom and information.
[02:36:03.210 --> 02:36:05.953]  Well, if folks want to make little intro promos for the show,
[02:36:07.094 --> 02:36:10.578]  Uh, and then just put them on your YouTube and put a message at the end that we're free to use it.
[02:36:10.578 --> 02:36:11.419]  We'll air some of them here.
[02:36:11.419 --> 02:36:15.865]  I mean, we just, we don't have time to give folks all the ideas or tell you what to do.
[02:36:15.865 --> 02:36:17.527]  It's a war.
[02:36:17.527 --> 02:36:20.270]  I mean, you know, we see propaganda around here.
[02:36:20.270 --> 02:36:23.834]  I've heard little birds go up themselves and spray paint the billboards.
[02:36:24.502 --> 02:36:25.303]  Yeah.
[02:36:25.303 --> 02:36:27.124]  Or used... I'm not saying that's a good thing to do.
[02:36:27.124 --> 02:36:29.366]  I mean, they're putting cancer viruses in our vaccines.
[02:36:29.366 --> 02:36:32.929]  We shouldn't go up on the vaccine signs saying, vaccinate your baby and warn people.
[02:36:32.929 --> 02:36:33.549]  Right.
[02:36:33.549 --> 02:36:34.830]  You should never do that.
[02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:44.358]  And like you said, the way everything's going into this government-regulated technocracy, that's the same way why all you see is doctors, they're pro-vaccine, pro-vaccine, pro-vaccine.
[02:36:44.358 --> 02:36:48.822]  That's because they bully them into submission, even though some polls show the majority are really concerned.
[02:36:49.082 --> 02:36:51.964]  Yeah, and if they are concerned, they don't get the chance.
[02:36:51.964 --> 02:36:54.445]  There's no venue for them to even question this stuff.
[02:36:54.445 --> 02:36:56.087]  It's a very small network.
[02:36:56.087 --> 02:36:57.147]  It's cult-like, David.
[02:36:57.147 --> 02:37:06.153]  Tonight on the Infowars Nightly News, we're going to be talking to a doctor who's part of an organization of doctors that is the American Association for Physicians and Surgeons.
[02:37:06.153 --> 02:37:08.755]  They are very much concerned about informed consent.
[02:37:09.571 --> 02:37:17.533]  They want to see the patient-doctor relationship to be sacrosanct and free of any third-party influences.
[02:37:17.533 --> 02:37:20.934]  Which is what Obamacare actually turns doctors into robots.
[02:37:20.934 --> 02:37:21.714]  Exactly.
[02:37:21.714 --> 02:37:25.935]  And so we got away from the idea that we should have informed consent with Obamacare.
[02:37:25.935 --> 02:37:32.837]  And now they're taking it to the next step, saying, you're not going to have any informed consent about what we do with injections of vaccines.
[02:37:33.477 --> 02:37:34.538]  That's the way this happens.
[02:37:34.538 --> 02:37:44.505]  They roll it out, they say, well, we're going to provide, we don't want your informed consent and we want you to get with us to take away the informed consent of other people so we can give you some free health care benefits.
[02:37:44.505 --> 02:37:47.827]  And then they come after the people in terms of vaccines.
[02:37:47.827 --> 02:37:53.171]  If they're going to define what health care is, if they're going to quote-unquote fund it, they are going to define it.
[02:37:53.311 --> 02:37:54.892]  And they are going to ram it down your throat.
[02:37:54.892 --> 02:37:56.292]  This is total social control.
[02:37:56.292 --> 02:37:57.793]  This is the government running our lives.
[02:37:57.793 --> 02:38:04.476]  I want to go to calls, but I said I'd do a News Blitz here, so let's just go through these big topics and get your take on them.
[02:38:04.476 --> 02:38:06.056]  There's probably 30 of them.
[02:38:08.407 --> 02:38:09.387]  That's the headline.
[02:38:09.387 --> 02:38:11.988]  Ground troops are necessary to defeat ISIS.
[02:38:11.988 --> 02:38:12.869]  You can't do this by air.
[02:38:12.869 --> 02:38:14.610]  Everybody acknowledges that.
[02:38:14.610 --> 02:38:15.210]  That's the U.S.
[02:38:15.210 --> 02:38:19.231]  Ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, the warmonger.
[02:38:19.231 --> 02:38:20.632]  Here's another one.
[02:38:20.632 --> 02:38:25.674]  Obama's force authorization is a blank check for war worldwide.
[02:38:25.674 --> 02:38:30.996]  The President is requesting Congress to pass an authorization for the use of military force, the AUMF.
[02:38:32.934 --> 02:38:34.355]  Resolution against ISIS.
[02:38:34.355 --> 02:38:35.936]  Ron Paul wrote this article.
[02:38:35.936 --> 02:38:37.096]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:38:37.096 --> 02:38:39.538]  He goes over it and it's just unlimited war.
[02:38:39.538 --> 02:38:40.298]  He's a dictator.
[02:38:40.298 --> 02:38:42.559]  I mean, they're just giving him dictatorial powers right now.
[02:38:42.559 --> 02:38:45.681]  This morning when I was driving in, NPR.
[02:38:45.681 --> 02:38:48.282]  I monitor enemy transmissions every once in a while.
[02:38:48.282 --> 02:38:50.123]  They're all foreground troops.
[02:38:50.123 --> 02:38:51.344]  They always are.
[02:38:51.344 --> 02:38:53.545]  But these people were against it when Bush was doing it.
[02:38:53.545 --> 02:38:54.885]  What's the difference?
[02:38:54.885 --> 02:38:58.027]  Well, now it's humanitarian to go fight al Qaeda.
[02:38:58.027 --> 02:38:58.267]  Right.
[02:38:58.267 --> 02:38:59.588]  We're going to do it with 500,000 instead of 200,000.
[02:38:59.588 --> 02:38:59.868]  I'm like, what?
[02:39:02.714 --> 02:39:08.636]  How can you people sit there and say you were for it, you were against it when Bush was doing it, but now you're for it because Obama wants to do it?
[02:39:08.636 --> 02:39:15.999]  I mean, it's just... And it's Saudi Arabian armies that are infesting Iraq again, and so we go attack Iraq.
[02:39:15.999 --> 02:39:20.821]  Claiming we're saving Iraq from the very Free Syrian Army that we told everybody was Al Qaeda.
[02:39:21.021 --> 02:39:26.785]  We can't go into Syria, so we have to go back into Iraq, set up another base, and then we'll launch operations into Syria.
[02:39:26.785 --> 02:39:29.186]  It will create a good rebel force to go attack Syria.
[02:39:29.186 --> 02:39:29.486]  Exactly.
[02:39:29.486 --> 02:39:31.228]  It's about creating a new Islamic State.
[02:39:31.228 --> 02:39:38.832]  You watch, when they're done, they're going to carve out a new third country between those two areas in Syria, eastern Syria, western Iraq.
[02:39:38.832 --> 02:39:39.653]  I mean, that's the plan.
[02:39:39.653 --> 02:39:41.154]  You called that about a year ago, I think.
[02:39:41.354 --> 02:39:41.914]  It's not hard.
[02:39:41.914 --> 02:39:43.755]  The enemy is very transparent.
[02:39:43.755 --> 02:39:45.215]  And that's why I wish people would pay attention.
[02:39:45.215 --> 02:39:46.155]  David, your take on this?
[02:39:46.155 --> 02:39:49.897]  Well, it was pretty transparent when we were fighting them wanting to go to war in Syria.
[02:39:49.897 --> 02:39:51.797]  We were talking about the sarin gas attacks.
[02:39:51.797 --> 02:39:54.078]  And it's like, look, even the U.S.
[02:39:54.078 --> 02:39:59.479]  military eventually came out and said, you know, first of all, we can't say that that came from the Syrian government.
[02:39:59.479 --> 02:40:01.500]  And we know that the rebels had that capability.
[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:07.942]  They were selling these false narratives about how we... Our own military does not want to be that immoral and fight for Al Qaeda.
[02:40:07.942 --> 02:40:08.282]  That's right.
[02:40:08.482 --> 02:40:09.762]  That's got to freak out the system.
[02:40:31.548 --> 02:40:35.370]  And the truth is we're doing all of this for Saudi Arabia.
[02:40:35.370 --> 02:40:35.670]  Oh yeah.
[02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:36.851]  The worst people in the Middle East.
[02:40:36.851 --> 02:40:39.433]  Well and the purge is going on continuously.
[02:40:39.433 --> 02:40:44.535]  It's been going on for years in the military where the top generals are being replaced by guys who will follow orders.
[02:40:44.535 --> 02:40:46.216]  These guys won't follow orders.
[02:40:46.216 --> 02:40:47.517]  We're showing up on screen right now.
[02:40:47.517 --> 02:40:50.119]  I will not fight for Al Qaeda in Syria.
[02:40:50.119 --> 02:40:54.301]  Well now they'll fight, quote, ISIS, but then they airdrop them weapons.
[02:40:54.301 --> 02:40:54.861]  Yeah.
[02:40:54.861 --> 02:40:56.822]  I mean this is all fake, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:56.822 --> 02:40:57.483]  We didn't know.
[02:40:58.203 --> 02:41:00.065]  We accidentally bombed the Kurds again.
[02:41:00.065 --> 02:41:01.006]  Talk about Saudi Arabia.
[02:41:01.006 --> 02:41:09.994]  When they decided that they were going to maintain production in the face of falling demand globally and cause this drop that we've seen in oil prices, they knew they were going to do that.
[02:41:09.994 --> 02:41:13.657]  How much do you think they made selling the oil futures short?
[02:41:13.657 --> 02:41:20.943]  How much do you think their buddies in the CIA made selling oil futures short when their friends in the Saudi kingdom told them, hey, you know what we're going to do?
[02:41:21.884 --> 02:41:25.609]  It's good to be king, isn't it?
[02:41:25.609 --> 02:41:28.013]  IMF announces $17.5 billion bailout.
[02:41:28.013 --> 02:41:29.995]  Exactly what George Soros asked for.
[02:41:29.995 --> 02:41:31.958]  This is from a London independent.
[02:41:31.958 --> 02:41:36.744]  This is from LeGrand that wants people to work seven days a week when she's got Swiss bank accounts on record.
[02:41:37.285 --> 02:41:47.810]  And now $17.5 billion to be given through fences right into people like the Vice President's son, who's there as a commissar looting the daylights out of these people.
[02:41:47.810 --> 02:41:49.391]  How obvious is that?
[02:41:49.391 --> 02:41:50.051]  Here's another one.
[02:41:50.051 --> 02:41:57.795]  Congress ramps up another billion on top of $17 billion in lethal aid to Ukraine to, quote, end the conflict.
[02:41:57.795 --> 02:42:00.237]  Now that will escalate the conflict with the Russians.
[02:42:00.237 --> 02:42:01.157]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:42:01.257 --> 02:42:02.778]  Yeah, I don't think we've seen anything yet.
[02:42:02.778 --> 02:42:03.818]  This has been going on.
[02:42:03.818 --> 02:42:13.762]  It started off as this color revolution that we were documenting about a year and a half ago, maybe even longer, with the people starting to dissent against the government.
[02:42:13.762 --> 02:42:20.265]  Now the government's changed, and now it's a pro-West government, and Russia, it's only going to get worse.
[02:42:20.985 --> 02:42:22.586]  People are getting out.
[02:42:22.586 --> 02:42:31.952]  Anybody that remembers the Cuban Missile Crisis, and I was a child when that happened, telling people how old I am, but the, you know, this is essentially the Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse.
[02:42:31.952 --> 02:42:34.454]  We're taking the weapons to their front door.
[02:42:34.454 --> 02:42:36.615]  How do you think the Russians are going to respond to this?
[02:42:36.615 --> 02:42:46.122]  I mean, they brought us to, you know, the Cuban Missile Crisis brought us to the verge of nuclear war once, so now these guys are basically doing it in reverse, where we're the ones going right to their doorstep.
[02:42:46.562 --> 02:42:58.869]  And of course the truth was, in the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Russians were horribly corrupt and out of control commies, but we had moved medium range missiles into Turkey secretly, and that's why the Russians responded with moving nukes into Cuba.
[02:42:58.869 --> 02:43:05.493]  And then Kennedy secretly agreed to pull the missiles out of Turkey.
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:11.664]  And you make these provocative moves, but I don't see any secret agreements coming where they're going to pull anything back.
[02:43:11.664 --> 02:43:15.286]  They've made these provocative moves, and they're continuing to make provocative moves.
[02:43:15.286 --> 02:43:21.231]  And basically, the Europeans are pushing back and saying you're trying to start, they're calling them on trying to start World War III.
[02:43:21.231 --> 02:43:25.334]  Well, and NATO is ramping up all the armaments in Eastern Europe.
[02:43:25.334 --> 02:43:27.675]  I mean, they're getting ready for a bigger war.
[02:43:27.675 --> 02:43:28.776]  They're not playing any games.
[02:43:30.057 --> 02:43:38.962]  Well, let's face it, our troops and others are fighting sheet-dip spitsnats who are in Russian separatist uniforms.
[02:43:38.962 --> 02:43:40.543]  It's on record.
[02:43:40.543 --> 02:43:43.484]  We're in a war with Russia right now.
[02:43:43.484 --> 02:43:44.184]  It's amazing.
[02:43:44.184 --> 02:43:45.405]  Is it going to get bigger?
[02:43:45.405 --> 02:43:49.627]  And is it going to get nuclear?
[02:43:49.627 --> 02:43:52.149]  Well, I tell you, these people are out of their minds.
[02:43:52.149 --> 02:43:54.410]  All these feminists said, we just had women running things.
[02:43:54.410 --> 02:43:57.752]  It's three women in the State Department quarterbacking this whole deal.
[02:43:59.372 --> 02:44:04.374]  I think they're hedging their bets because if you look at what happened right after the elections, what did they do?
[02:44:04.374 --> 02:44:09.296]  They came back, Republicans and Democrats signed up the taxpayers to cover derivatives.
[02:44:09.296 --> 02:44:12.217]  They're concerned about an economic collapse.
[02:44:12.217 --> 02:44:13.578]  That just happened a month ago.
[02:44:13.578 --> 02:44:21.161]  Yeah, the derivatives insurance that they put us on the hook for yet again, that they had removed in the debacle of 2008, they said never again, we're not going to do that.
[02:44:21.161 --> 02:44:23.202]  Well, they've done it again for an even larger amount.
[02:44:23.762 --> 02:44:28.765]  That is hedging their bets, and I think all the stuff that's going on with all these wars is hedging their bets.
[02:44:28.765 --> 02:44:31.107]  If we have an economic collapse, they pull the trigger.
[02:44:31.107 --> 02:44:33.568]  They've got everything in place, they can start a war.
[02:44:33.568 --> 02:44:40.452]  That means that everybody no longer is concerned with lynching the people who caused the economic collapse domestically, but now we've got the outslander we can carry.
[02:44:40.452 --> 02:44:45.836]  You're gonna be watching bombs hit buildings on TV and going, look at that, USA, USA.
[02:44:46.576 --> 02:44:52.799]  And then the younger kids, which is I think why this American Sniper movie came out too, you're going to see a rise in people signing up.
[02:44:52.799 --> 02:44:53.740]  Fresh meat.
[02:44:53.740 --> 02:44:55.101]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:44:55.101 --> 02:44:55.901]  Let's shift gears.
[02:44:55.901 --> 02:44:59.363]  Net neutrality is a Trojan horse virus infecting the internet.
[02:44:59.363 --> 02:45:02.404]  And this is an article out of New American Magazine.
[02:45:02.404 --> 02:45:12.070]  And basically last week, Tom Wheeler, chairman of the FCC, published an op-ed piece in Wired which laid out his strategy to ensure net neutrality by treating the internet as a public utility that's
[02:45:12.910 --> 02:45:24.119]  Obama's plan and applying the same type of regulations that are used for phone electric companies so that he's flip-flopping constantly and then the article breaks down the problems with that.
[02:45:24.119 --> 02:45:25.620]  Is this really net neutrality?
[02:45:25.620 --> 02:45:26.821]  David Knight, what's your view on this?
[02:45:27.639 --> 02:45:31.103]  Well, I think we can see what's already happened with the FAA.
[02:45:31.103 --> 02:45:36.828]  They went back to some ancient legislation and said, hey, we have authority over anything that's designed to fly through the air.
[02:45:36.828 --> 02:45:39.451]  Any kind of, uh, anything that's designed.
[02:45:39.451 --> 02:45:42.354]  And it's like, oh, so you're going to assert authority over model planes?
[02:45:42.354 --> 02:45:46.778]  And when they first did it back in November, they had four rules.
[02:45:46.778 --> 02:45:50.182]  Now, one of those was a deal breaker, but now they just came back this week with 33.
[02:45:51.744 --> 02:46:00.412]  So, initially they came out with just a few of these things, and people thought, okay, that's the way the bureaucracy grows like a cancer, and that's what you're going to see with the FCC.
[02:46:00.412 --> 02:46:14.866]  Once they established their authority, which is what the FAA was trying to do with those four rules, saying you can't fly above 400 feet, you can't do this, the key one was that you had to be a licensed pilot, licensed to fly a real plane, in order to fly one of these model planes.
[02:46:15.326 --> 02:46:18.927]  Now, once you let that stand, they come back later on with 33 rules.
[02:46:18.927 --> 02:46:25.049]  One of those is that, okay, you not only have to be a licensed pilot, but you've got to have an observer watching the licensed pilot.
[02:46:25.049 --> 02:46:29.610]  I mean, it just gets, and then they regulate the speed at which the thing goes, so there's no end to it.
[02:46:29.610 --> 02:46:30.731]  We see that with every one of these.
[02:46:30.731 --> 02:46:38.413]  It's a robotic takeover of everything, and then they create the hype of the drones, the pores out there, civilian use, the hype-up problems.
[02:46:39.013 --> 02:46:44.041]  You know, when an intelligence operative who's drunk crashes at the White House, all staged.
[02:46:44.041 --> 02:46:48.008]  Let's shift gears now into some of these subjects.
[02:46:48.008 --> 02:46:50.672]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:46:50.672 --> 02:46:51.834]  IRS to pay back
[02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:55.571]  Refunds to illegal immigrants who didn't pay taxes.
[02:46:55.571 --> 02:47:08.037]  Washington Times IRS Commissioner told Congress on Wednesday that even illegal immigrants who didn't pay taxes will be able to claim back refunds once they get social security numbers under President Obama's temporary deportation amnesty.
[02:47:08.037 --> 02:47:14.020]  And then the IRS also comes out, this is in Associated Press, and apologizes for seizing bank accounts of small businesses
[02:47:14.840 --> 02:47:20.982]  Like hot dog stands and small diners that make, you know, under $1,000 deposits every week.
[02:47:20.982 --> 02:47:26.024]  Even though they pay taxes on it, they said that was illegal and seized tens of thousands of bank accounts.
[02:47:26.024 --> 02:47:27.425]  Oh, but now they're apologizing.
[02:47:27.425 --> 02:47:27.765]  Right.
[02:47:27.765 --> 02:47:29.105]  Did they give the money back?
[02:47:29.105 --> 02:47:29.566]  Yeah.
[02:47:29.566 --> 02:47:30.186]  Probably not.
[02:47:30.186 --> 02:47:30.366]  Yeah.
[02:47:30.906 --> 02:47:33.148]  We're going to keep this for administrative fees.
[02:47:33.148 --> 02:47:34.449]  They'll give it to illegal aliens.
[02:47:34.449 --> 02:47:36.111]  That's what they're doing.
[02:47:36.111 --> 02:47:44.518]  They're doing this earned income tax credit and they're saying, okay, you're here, we're going to give you amnesty, so file some tax returns for some previous years and we'll give you an earned income tax credit too.
[02:47:45.595 --> 02:47:48.338]  The IRS is in the Communist Manifesto.
[02:47:48.338 --> 02:47:51.761]  The IRS was set up in 1913 when we got the Federal Reserve.
[02:47:51.761 --> 02:47:53.603]  It is an alien organization.
[02:47:53.603 --> 02:47:55.224]  It doesn't have due process.
[02:47:55.224 --> 02:47:56.065]  It's criminal.
[02:47:56.065 --> 02:48:01.970]  And now the IRS will not give you tax advice when you call them because it's written to screw whoever they want.
[02:48:02.731 --> 02:48:08.174]  And then the tax agencies that are set up, like TurboTax and Agent R Black, don't even know what to do with any of these new rules.
[02:48:08.174 --> 02:48:09.615]  They're confused as well.
[02:48:09.615 --> 02:48:11.836]  And they say, call the IRS, and the IRS says, we won't tell you.
[02:48:11.836 --> 02:48:14.498]  I mean, that is CAFA-esque, where you're like, what?
[02:48:14.498 --> 02:48:15.838]  How do I even comply?
[02:48:15.838 --> 02:48:24.303]  Years ago, I covered a rally where a candidate was going to feed the income tax code through a shredder to make the point he wanted to get rid of the income tax.
[02:48:24.303 --> 02:48:29.766]  They contacted the IRS multiple times, and nobody could tell them even how many pages it was.
[02:48:30.313 --> 02:48:33.415]  They don't even know how many pages they said of tax code they've got.
[02:48:33.415 --> 02:48:48.605]  You've got, they've established the precedent that we now see happening in all of these agencies where they go out and they write the law as unelected representatives, they write the laws, I call them regulations, then they send their own people out as police, then you go to their court, not to a real court.
[02:48:48.605 --> 02:48:53.468]  So they write the law, they police the law, and then they judge whether or not you're guilty of their law without really due process.
[02:48:53.468 --> 02:48:55.669]  And that's happened now with all of the agencies.
[02:48:55.669 --> 02:48:56.390]  It's not just the IRS.
[02:48:56.590 --> 02:49:04.352]  They're going criminal by design and announcing they're going to start grabbing people's education funds and taxing them and regulating them after tax.
[02:49:04.352 --> 02:49:06.613]  I mean, we know how tyranny looks.
[02:49:06.613 --> 02:49:08.414]  We've got a really bad case of it.
[02:49:08.414 --> 02:49:13.695]  People better get mobilized fast because it's only going to make it worse if we don't resist.
[02:49:13.695 --> 02:49:16.916]  San Francisco, commuters possibly exposed to measles.
[02:49:16.916 --> 02:49:17.716]  No one's died.
[02:49:17.716 --> 02:49:19.357]  They're hyping like the end of the world.
[02:49:19.357 --> 02:49:20.657]  Most of these people are vaccinated.
[02:49:20.657 --> 02:49:23.958]  No one says, why are they getting it then if they're vaccinated?
[02:49:23.958 --> 02:49:25.679]  And the hype is just accelerating.
[02:49:25.679 --> 02:49:26.399]  What do you make of that?
[02:49:26.459 --> 02:49:31.064]  You have to know two words, safe and effective, because that's all they say over and over again.
[02:49:31.064 --> 02:49:32.986]  The vaccines are safe and effective.
[02:49:32.986 --> 02:49:34.587]  This is a total hoax.
[02:49:34.587 --> 02:49:36.009]  I'm doing a report today.
[02:49:36.009 --> 02:49:39.612]  Right after this, I'm going to jump on it.
[02:49:39.612 --> 02:49:42.895]  It was Elizabeth Warren talking to one of these CDC heads.
[02:49:43.536 --> 02:49:47.259]  Throwing softball question after softball question.
[02:49:47.259 --> 02:49:51.661]  But it was just to put it on record, that effect that you have to get your vaccines.
[02:49:51.661 --> 02:49:52.102]  They're safe.
[02:49:52.102 --> 02:49:54.403]  They say they don't cause any problems whatsoever.
[02:49:54.403 --> 02:49:55.464]  No one's ever been damaged.
[02:49:55.464 --> 02:49:56.204]  No one's ever been.
[02:49:56.204 --> 02:49:57.505]  You can see the talking point.
[02:49:57.505 --> 02:50:02.889]  How suddenly all over TV, all over radio, all over print, all over Congress, Republican, Democrat, take your vaccines.
[02:50:02.889 --> 02:50:04.010]  They've never hurt you.
[02:50:04.010 --> 02:50:05.751]  It'll make you not ever get sick.
[02:50:05.751 --> 02:50:07.072]  All your lies.
[02:50:07.072 --> 02:50:08.953]  And then Brian Williams look truthful.
[02:50:08.953 --> 02:50:09.353]  Exactly.
[02:50:09.353 --> 02:50:10.694]  And then there's people there.
[02:50:10.694 --> 02:50:11.575]  You just look at the Internet.
[02:50:11.575 --> 02:50:13.316]  There's people just getting on going.
[02:50:13.936 --> 02:50:14.877]  I took the flu shot.
[02:50:14.877 --> 02:50:16.738]  Now I can't even move my arm.
[02:50:16.738 --> 02:50:18.760]  The one girl has to run backwards after getting the flu shot.
[02:50:18.760 --> 02:50:21.461]  And they'll even tell you, yeah, you got Guillain-Barre.
[02:50:21.461 --> 02:50:22.982]  Go to the secret vaccine court.
[02:50:22.982 --> 02:50:24.924]  Oh, you got a dead kid?
[02:50:24.924 --> 02:50:25.264]  We'll pay you $300,000.
[02:50:43.776 --> 02:50:44.937]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:44.937 --> 02:50:45.337]  That's right.
[02:50:58.266 --> 02:51:00.148]  Seriously, Ryan Williams can fly.
[02:51:00.148 --> 02:51:00.708]  Hear that?
[02:51:00.708 --> 02:51:06.673]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[02:51:06.673 --> 02:51:09.435]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[02:51:09.435 --> 02:51:13.018]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[02:51:13.018 --> 02:51:20.584]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[02:51:20.584 --> 02:51:21.885]  Security is a mindset.
[02:51:22.145 --> 02:51:25.167]  And fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[02:51:25.167 --> 02:51:27.609]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[02:51:27.609 --> 02:51:30.450]  Faketv.com This is an alert.
[02:51:30.450 --> 02:51:34.553]  If your business or church is building this year, you're about to pay more than you should.
[02:51:34.553 --> 02:51:38.736]  This could mean thousands of dollars more for your office, retail space, church, or warehouse.
[02:51:38.736 --> 02:51:44.019]  A general steel building can save you as much as half the cost and time of similar conventional construction.
[02:51:44.119 --> 02:51:47.641]  And we're offering rebates of up to $20,000 to help you build today.

[02:51:57.867 --> 02:52:02.129]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:52:02.129 --> 02:52:05.631]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:52:05.631 --> 02:52:11.694]  What if we the patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:52:11.694 --> 02:52:12.835]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:52:13.095 --> 02:52:15.296]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:52:15.296 --> 02:52:16.877]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:52:16.877 --> 02:52:21.600]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:26.183]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:52:26.183 --> 02:52:28.825]  How we can come together and win the human race.

[02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:06.842]  In January, a newly introduced bill, H.R.
[02:53:06.842 --> 02:53:10.905]  378, will take away your right to buy level 3 and higher body armor.

[02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:02.712]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:54:02.712 --> 02:54:05.496]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:09.335 --> 02:54:10.355]  We're in a little bit of overdrive.
[02:54:10.355 --> 02:54:16.897]  I want to go to Mary and Chris, Denise, Cindy, Ollie, as many as I can.

[02:55:05.087 --> 02:55:10.350]  Here's a story out today of a San Jose Mercury News business section.
[02:55:10.350 --> 02:55:16.214]  Robot with empathy will add ability to learn from IBM's Watson.
[02:55:16.214 --> 02:55:25.660]  Japanese mobile carrier South Bank said Tuesday it will incorporate artificial intelligence technology from IBM into its empathetic robot Pepper.
[02:55:25.660 --> 02:55:30.624]  Well, I wish... Oh, it's bioethics is from Watson.
[02:55:32.026 --> 02:55:38.752]  And Watson is based on the previous Watson-Hollerith computer, named after the Nazi Watson, Thomas Watson.
[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:44.743]  Who ran the machines that would decide how long you were fed or lived in the death camps.
[02:55:44.743 --> 02:55:46.865]  That's what the number was on your arm.
[02:55:46.865 --> 02:55:50.647]  This is the machine now deciding the secret do not treat death list.
[02:55:50.647 --> 02:55:52.929]  It's going to say awe as it twists your head.
[02:55:52.929 --> 02:55:54.470]  But it's loving.
[02:55:54.470 --> 02:56:00.794]  It's teaching the Japanese robots that they're pioneering, rolling out.
[02:56:00.794 --> 02:56:05.577]  The biomechanical systems are next, but these are the mechanical systems.
[02:56:05.577 --> 02:56:07.258]  Here's the problem, Alex.
[02:56:07.258 --> 02:56:09.660]  In engineering, you don't take ethics classes.
[02:56:10.661 --> 02:56:13.363]  I got a degree in engineering, it was never a part of the curriculum.
[02:56:13.363 --> 02:56:18.567]  But Watson is a bio-mechanical, I mean Watson is a eugenical system.
[02:56:18.567 --> 02:56:19.828]  It decides who to kill.
[02:56:19.828 --> 02:56:32.279]  But they don't even talk to, the famous line from Jurassic Park, you know, where Jeff Goldblum says, just because you can build it doesn't mean you should, okay?
[02:56:32.859 --> 02:56:35.281]  They never addressed that in engineering.
[02:56:35.281 --> 02:56:36.322]  It's always just an electrical problem.
[02:56:36.322 --> 02:56:40.166]  That's why they tried to, quote, blow holes in the atmosphere or detonate the atmosphere.
[02:56:40.166 --> 02:56:42.828]  And they said, we just want to see if we can burn the earth up.
[02:56:42.828 --> 02:56:44.950]  So the Pentagon detonated them in the upper atmosphere.
[02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:45.791]  I mean, why?
[02:56:45.791 --> 02:56:47.132]  Well, because we're just going to do it.
[02:56:47.132 --> 02:56:49.234]  Yeah, the Hadrian Collider can create a strange little black hole.
[02:56:49.234 --> 02:56:50.215]  We're just going to do it.
[02:56:50.215 --> 02:56:50.536]  Yeah.
[02:56:50.536 --> 02:56:51.857]  Low probability.
[02:56:51.857 --> 02:56:53.218]  Yeah.
[02:56:53.218 --> 02:56:58.323]  Next week, hopefully, we're going to have Hugo de Guerras, who wrote a book called The Artelect War, talking about how
[02:56:59.053 --> 02:57:01.196]  We're on the path.
[02:57:01.196 --> 02:57:04.742]  He's kind of a different side of the AI community.
[02:57:04.742 --> 02:57:11.692]  He's very well known, like Ray Kurzweil, but unlike Ray Kurzweil, who sees this rosy scenario where he thinks he's going to become a machine.
[02:57:12.611 --> 02:57:21.217]  He's taking, I think, a much more grounded look at this and says, you know, hey, we may be very well creating the gods that are going to kill us.
[02:57:21.217 --> 02:57:24.059]  Well, obviously, because the elite believe they're going to become those gods.
[02:57:24.059 --> 02:57:25.581]  You read deeper into Kurzweil.
[02:57:25.581 --> 02:57:29.363]  He's a globalist, eugenicist, get rid of people model.
[02:57:29.363 --> 02:57:34.927]  That's what Bill Joy warned us about at meetings he was with with him, you know, 15 years ago in Wired Magazine.
[02:57:34.927 --> 02:57:37.770]  And with the architecture of computers,
[02:57:38.590 --> 02:57:43.235]  And the AI system is being designed to make us obsolete for the elite.
[02:57:43.235 --> 02:57:45.998]  So it's being designed to get rid of us on record.
[02:57:45.998 --> 02:57:49.602]  And it's being tested on the veterans right now.
[02:57:49.602 --> 02:57:54.927]  They're already brain-shipping veterans to cure their PTSD and giving them vaccines.
[02:57:55.848 --> 02:57:58.491]  Where they, quote, aren't upset anymore and then they go commit suicide.
[02:57:58.491 --> 02:58:00.072]  And you ask, why is all this stuff coming together?
[02:58:00.072 --> 02:58:05.297]  Well, they can see that they're going to be doing a lot of replacement of a lot of people and a lot of jobs.
[02:58:05.297 --> 02:58:10.081]  If you've got 45-50% unemployment, you don't need to have your derivative bubble pop.
[02:58:10.081 --> 02:58:11.883]  That's going to create an economic crisis right there.
[02:58:11.883 --> 02:58:14.766]  And then you're going to need to have a war to get rid of those excess people.
[02:58:15.652 --> 02:58:16.313]  That's what they're doing to you.
[02:58:16.313 --> 02:58:17.754]  And those are in all the actuaries.
[02:58:17.754 --> 02:58:18.454]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:58:18.454 --> 02:58:20.095]  Jamming a few calls in overdrive.
[02:58:20.095 --> 02:58:21.556]  Some stations leave us now.
[02:58:21.556 --> 02:58:23.738]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:23.738 --> 02:58:26.780]  Have you sent that out in email or Facebook or Twitter to your friends and family?
[02:58:26.780 --> 02:58:28.141]  We're in a war.
[02:58:28.141 --> 02:58:30.702]  And every person we reach is key in this battle.
[02:58:30.702 --> 02:58:33.785]  It's gonna get a lot more serious in the days, weeks and years to come.
[02:58:33.785 --> 02:58:35.806]  I may not even be here when all this goes down.
[02:58:35.806 --> 02:58:37.547]  But the information will live on.
[02:58:37.547 --> 02:58:39.428]  Humanity will prevail with God's help.
[02:58:39.428 --> 02:58:40.109]  Stay with us.
[02:58:40.109 --> 02:58:42.671]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:58:43.847 --> 02:58:52.711]  The month of February is all about Valentine's Day.
[02:58:52.711 --> 02:58:56.212]  Big heart-shaped boxes filled with delicious candy.
[02:58:56.212 --> 02:59:02.295]  What if we the Patriots hijacked Valentine's Day and instead made it about human liberty and individual empowerment?
[02:59:02.295 --> 02:59:03.675]  I'm all about human potential.
[02:59:03.675 --> 02:59:05.816]  I'm all about the individual being empowered.
[02:59:05.896 --> 02:59:07.478]  The establishment is the opposite.
[02:59:07.478 --> 02:59:12.263]  That's why they spike our water with fluoride, GMO, estrogen mimickers, and the rest of the garbage.
[02:59:12.263 --> 02:59:16.847]  InfoWars is striking back in the month of February with Human Empowerment Month.
[02:59:16.847 --> 02:59:19.490]  How we can come together and win the human race.
[02:59:19.490 --> 02:59:27.558]  And to celebrate the kickoff of Human Empowerment Month, we're slashing prices on InfoWarsLife.com products like Super Male and Super Female Vitality.
[02:59:27.558 --> 02:59:29.260]  The sale is only running for the month?
[02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:30.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:30.660 --> 02:59:31.680]  You have done well, Lord Vader.
[03:00:02.190 --> 03:00:08.812]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:00:08.812 --> 03:00:12.273]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:12.273 --> 03:00:17.154]  You know, these people claim they're pro-human, these so-called leftists when they're a bunch of eugenicists.
[03:00:17.154 --> 03:00:28.618]  And it's just time to say, we're pro-human, we believe humans should move forward and the world should be built around empowering humans while also having a good environment because that helps humans.
[03:00:29.398 --> 03:00:31.699]  Instead, we're told, just stand down, hate yourself.
[03:00:31.699 --> 03:00:35.601]  That's only because the elites want us to quit caring about ourselves so they can take over.
[03:00:35.601 --> 03:00:36.742]  It's not about helping New Yorkers.
[03:00:36.742 --> 03:00:37.963]  What's wrong with that paradigm?
[03:00:37.963 --> 03:00:40.584]  Why can't we have that paradigm for 200 years?
[03:00:40.584 --> 03:00:40.984]  I hear you.
[03:00:40.984 --> 03:00:42.145]  Let's take some calls.
[03:00:42.145 --> 03:00:44.846]  Marion, New Jersey, thank you for holding.
[03:00:44.846 --> 03:00:46.147]  Hi, Alex.
[03:00:46.147 --> 03:00:53.651]  I just wanted to make a few quick points about Newton and also something important about New Jersey.
[03:00:53.651 --> 03:00:54.291]  In Newtown,
[03:00:56.463 --> 03:01:15.491]  I saw on one of these films, at first I didn't believe it was set up, but I watched a lot of the films and there was an anonymous person that sent in something from City Hall showing that the school was closed for four or five years prior to this and that they were having meetings in that room, okay?
[03:01:15.491 --> 03:01:18.312]  And also, some of the people, the post parents,
[03:01:18.852 --> 03:01:23.055]  There are a bunch of Democratic Party operatives.
[03:01:23.055 --> 03:01:23.395]  What's that?
[03:01:32.520 --> 03:01:33.481]  That's right.
[03:01:33.481 --> 03:01:35.884]  And also, they couldn't find that child.
[03:01:35.884 --> 03:01:42.612]  But I did want to mention something about New Jersey that I saw in a local paper and I haven't had a chance to call in.
[03:01:42.612 --> 03:01:51.623]  It was in a Union County paper, a local paper, that our local Newark State, it's a Newark State
[03:01:52.239 --> 03:01:57.704]  It used to be Newark State Teacher's College, now it's Kean University.
[03:01:57.704 --> 03:02:00.206]  Governor Kean's family left the land.
[03:02:00.206 --> 03:02:01.647]  Sure, what did you say in there?
[03:02:01.647 --> 03:02:10.354]  Anyhow, they want to build a big, it's a teacher's college, and they want to build a big architectural school.
[03:02:10.354 --> 03:02:15.399]  And when they said, how can they justify this, the red Chinese government wants it built.
[03:02:16.261 --> 03:02:20.846]  A professor in Princeton promised them.
[03:02:20.846 --> 03:02:23.148]  And they were saying, how could we justify this?
[03:02:23.148 --> 03:02:23.548]  I know.
[03:02:23.548 --> 03:02:25.670]  We're being sold out to foreign interests.
[03:02:25.670 --> 03:02:26.531]  It's simply amazing.
[03:02:26.531 --> 03:02:29.954]  Send me the clip or the headline name and we can find that article.
[03:02:29.954 --> 03:02:31.135]  That's amazing.
[03:02:31.135 --> 03:02:32.176]  Thank you so much, Mary.
[03:02:32.176 --> 03:02:33.578]  Really interesting point.
[03:02:33.578 --> 03:02:36.200]  Let's talk to Denise in FEMA Region 5.
[03:02:36.200 --> 03:02:38.782]  What former state are you in, Denise?
[03:02:38.782 --> 03:02:39.543]  Minnesota.
[03:02:39.543 --> 03:02:40.184]  Okay, welcome.
[03:02:41.394 --> 03:02:42.795]  Thank you.
[03:02:42.795 --> 03:02:49.279]  I called at the end of the year when you were talking about subjects that you thought would be good in 2015.
[03:02:49.279 --> 03:02:56.343]  And it was in regards to, you know, the Sandy Hook debacle.
[03:02:56.343 --> 03:03:03.848]  And I talked about the movie Runaway Jury, where they were suing the gun manufacturer.
[03:03:03.848 --> 03:03:07.590]  And in that movie, they actually did win the case.
[03:03:08.496 --> 03:03:08.736]  I think?
[03:03:27.986 --> 03:03:41.614]  You know, and it fades away, it comes back, it fades away, it comes back, that there's something, and I can't put my finger on it, I don't know what it is, but there is something way off about everything about it.
[03:03:42.196 --> 03:03:48.419]  Well, I mean, just like, look, they had Jerry Bruckheimer produce the Saving Private Lynch deal.
[03:03:48.419 --> 03:03:51.900]  I mean, he was there on set, video, it was all staged.
[03:03:51.900 --> 03:03:57.003]  So they do produce this stuff, they do, and then five members of her team said it was fake, so they killed him.
[03:03:57.657 --> 03:03:59.678]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[03:03:59.678 --> 03:04:02.979]  And so of course we've got to look at this stuff and it could be staged.
[03:04:02.979 --> 03:04:04.040]  Very, very good point.
[03:04:04.040 --> 03:04:04.680]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:04.680 --> 03:04:06.981]  I'm sorry to Cindy and Mike and Ollie.
[03:04:06.981 --> 03:04:11.483]  If you call back tomorrow and tell John and they're answering the phone, we'll put you ahead of the line.
[03:04:11.483 --> 03:04:13.704]  Just remember to do that and I'll go to you first.
[03:04:14.144 --> 03:04:15.204]  We're out of time, guys.
[03:04:15.204 --> 03:04:16.205]  30 seconds or 15 seconds.
[03:04:16.205 --> 03:04:17.945]  You know what else they're doing in New Jersey?
[03:04:17.945 --> 03:04:23.167]  The caller reminded me that they're having a bullet detention center now in Monmouth, New Jersey that they kind of did secretly.
[03:04:23.167 --> 03:04:24.508]  Didn't really tell the locals about it.
[03:04:24.508 --> 03:04:25.628]  Just kind of implemented it.
[03:04:25.628 --> 03:04:28.529]  So they're... And the locals are complaining, saying, why is this all secret?
[03:04:28.529 --> 03:04:29.329]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:04:29.329 --> 03:04:32.731]  You know, it's like, why does all this stuff have to be under the board?
[03:04:32.731 --> 03:04:33.371]  Under the table?
[03:04:33.371 --> 03:04:34.992]  Nothing could just be brought out in the light.
[03:04:34.992 --> 03:04:37.432]  We'd have a better society if we made it open.
[03:04:37.432 --> 03:04:37.853]  That's racist.
[03:04:37.853 --> 03:04:38.293]  David?
[03:04:38.293 --> 03:04:38.893]  Everything is hidden.
[03:04:39.133 --> 03:04:42.676]  That, you put your finger on it, that's where they're going with this measles scare.
[03:04:42.676 --> 03:04:47.501]  They want to be able to inject you with unproven drugs when it's something that really scares the public like Ebola.
[03:04:47.501 --> 03:04:50.343]  And you're going to open your medicine cabinet, what's wrong?
[03:04:50.343 --> 03:04:51.404]  Here, take this.
[03:04:51.404 --> 03:04:52.605]  You know, it's THX 1130.
[03:04:52.605 --> 03:04:53.826]  They're already talking about it.
[03:04:53.826 --> 03:04:55.168]  We don't have time to test these drugs.
[03:04:55.168 --> 03:04:56.529]  We're going to have to do that.
[03:04:56.529 --> 03:04:57.129]  That's right.
[03:04:57.129 --> 03:04:57.870]  Great job guys.
[03:04:57.870 --> 03:04:58.471]  Not only News Tonight 7.
