[00:00.000 --> 00:08.680]  This agenda, Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[00:08.680 --> 00:10.520]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[00:10.520 --> 00:12.280]  Jesus is coming soon.
[00:12.280 --> 00:22.440]  For free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says, Box 99, Lenore City, TN 37771.
[00:22.440 --> 00:30.240]  Because their kettles still need some fillings.
[00:30.240 --> 00:31.960]  Austin, Texas, check your watch for-
[00:31.960 --> 00:38.920]  I-R-N-U-S-A Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:38.920 --> 00:41.840]  It's not a good day for travel in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:41.840 --> 00:45.800]  Snow, sleet and freezing rain are making driving treacherous.
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.400]  And sections of two major interstates are closed in Washington and Oregon.
[00:50.400 --> 00:52.520]  Passengers are advising people to stay home.
[00:52.520 --> 00:55.680]  Mike McFarland is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
[00:55.680 --> 00:58.920]  They got quite a bit of snow and now they're getting some freezing rain and they have strong
[00:58.920 --> 00:59.920]  east winds.
[00:59.920 --> 01:02.560]  So Portland's a real wintry mess as well.
[01:02.560 --> 01:04.680]  Probably worse in Portland than it is in Seattle right now.
[01:04.680 --> 01:09.120]  And passengers are describing a chaotic scramble to get off a burning jetliner that veered
[01:09.120 --> 01:13.480]  off a runway and crashed as it was taking off from Denver last night.
[01:13.480 --> 01:16.400]  Thirty-eight people were hurt, too critically.
[01:16.400 --> 01:17.400]  Here's Peter Banda.
[01:17.400 --> 01:21.600]  Fire fighters arriving at the scene describe the smoke, the entire right side of the plane
[01:21.600 --> 01:22.600]  was on fire.
[01:22.600 --> 01:27.200]  The 107 passengers and the five crew headed back during the airplane out of the inflatable
[01:27.200 --> 01:28.200]  emergency chute.
[01:28.200 --> 01:35.280]  This is I-R-N-U-S-A Radio News, the following from News Broadcast Network.
[01:35.280 --> 01:39.440]  This year, four out of the ten most wanted gifts for the holidays will be electronics.
[01:39.440 --> 01:43.080]  Jack Weyman, spokesperson for the Consumer Electronics Association.
[01:43.080 --> 01:49.160]  The ideal family gift would be a flat-screen digital high-definition TV with surround sound.
[01:49.160 --> 01:52.120]  All broadcasting goes digital next February.
[01:52.120 --> 01:57.840]  An ultra-light notebook computer, a short-pocket MP3 music player that connects to home and
[01:57.840 --> 02:04.040]  car audio systems to enjoy your favorite tunes, a pocket-sized digital camera and camcorder
[02:04.040 --> 02:09.720]  to preserve family memories, a cell phone that's also a camera, global positioner, plays
[02:09.720 --> 02:16.480]  audio and video, and even accesses the internet, video games for kids of all ages, a GPS for
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.640]  cars or for the great outdoors, a high-definition DVD player.
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.760]  Jack says noise reduction headsets, hands-free cell phone accessories, digital photo frames,
[02:26.760 --> 02:30.240]  memory cards and digital watches make great stocking stuffers.
[02:30.240 --> 02:32.680]  I'm John Dridden.
[02:32.680 --> 02:38.120]  A Republican media consultant who helped operate campaign websites for President Bush and candidate
[02:38.120 --> 02:41.160]  John McCain has died in a plane crash.
[02:41.160 --> 02:46.120]  Michael Conner was killed Friday when a small plane he was flying crashed near his home
[02:46.120 --> 02:47.960]  of Akron, Ohio.
[02:47.960 --> 02:52.760]  An Iraqi lawmaker says major parliamentary parties have reached a compromise and a resolution
[02:52.760 --> 02:58.560]  allowing foreign troops other than Americans to remain in Iraq until July 2009.
[02:58.560 --> 03:03.440]  The agreement allows lawmakers to circumvent strong opposition to the bill by a small number
[03:03.440 --> 03:05.800]  of radical Shiite deputies.
[03:05.800 --> 03:10.600]  And Vice President-elect Joe Biden will oversee a task force that will make recommendations
[03:10.600 --> 03:15.800]  on how to make sure the middle class is no longer being left behind.
[03:15.800 --> 03:21.200]  Biden tells ABCs this week the task force will include other cabinet members and will look
[03:21.200 --> 03:26.640]  at everything from college affordability to after-school programs.
[03:26.640 --> 03:32.360]  For more news and analysis, log on to IRNNews.com.
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.120]  I'm Errol Squires, inventor of Relieve One-Day Cold Soar Symptom Treatment.
[03:36.120 --> 03:40.200]  I invented Relieve because I wanted a very effective natural treatment for cold soars
[03:40.200 --> 03:41.960]  that work really fast.
[03:41.960 --> 03:45.480]  Relieve works so well and so fast for me, my family and friends.
[03:45.480 --> 03:48.160]  I wanted to help other people who suffer from cold soars.
[03:48.160 --> 03:51.200]  I think people are smart enough to know if something works.
[03:51.200 --> 03:55.640]  If you suffer from cold soars, try Relieve and find out if it works for you.
[03:55.640 --> 04:00.480]  Relieve is comprised of botanical extracts and is guaranteed by Relieve Now at all major
[04:00.480 --> 04:02.800]  stores.
[04:02.800 --> 04:08.520]  The Taliban in Pakistan has killed two Afghan nationals for allegedly acting as spies for
[04:08.520 --> 04:09.520]  the U.S.
[04:09.520 --> 04:31.200]  Here's Paul Alexander.
[04:31.200 --> 04:37.120]  A variety of religious viewpoints and religious leaders led a simple ceremony today to reopen
[04:37.120 --> 04:43.080]  the Trident Hotel, which shares a complex with two luxury hotels targeted at the Mumbai
[04:43.080 --> 04:44.640]  attacks.
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.040]  Security was much tighter, with guards checking bags and IDs.
[04:49.040 --> 04:51.080]  David Skuggs is a British tourist.
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.120]  I think if we were to change our plans and all the big holidays we've been waiting for,
[04:55.120 --> 05:00.840]  it would be conceding to the reasons behind terrorism in the first place.
[05:00.840 --> 05:04.560]  And violence is on and upsurge between Israel and Gaza.
[05:04.560 --> 05:05.560]  Here's Mark Levy.
[05:05.560 --> 05:09.160]  The Palestinian militants in Gaza have been firing dozens of rockets and mortar shells
[05:09.160 --> 05:10.160]  at Israel.
[05:10.160 --> 05:14.280]  One of them hit a house in a nearby town, another exploded in a city, Ashkelon, north
[05:14.280 --> 05:15.280]  of Gaza.
[05:15.280 --> 05:16.840]  Israel has been hitting back with airstrikes.
[05:16.840 --> 05:21.240]  The truce between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers expired on Friday.
[05:21.240 --> 05:26.320]  The truce it frayed since early November, and rocket fire at Israeli towns has been increasing
[05:26.320 --> 05:28.000]  in recent days.
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.040]  I'm Jody Jordan for IRN-USA Radio News.
[05:32.040 --> 05:36.720]  Many doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[05:36.720 --> 05:38.080]  alkaline environment.
[05:38.080 --> 05:43.400]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[05:43.400 --> 05:47.840]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[05:47.840 --> 05:49.000]  of disease.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.640]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[05:53.640 --> 05:54.720]  loss of weight.
[05:54.720 --> 05:57.720]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[05:57.720 --> 06:00.920]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[06:00.920 --> 06:04.840]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[06:04.840 --> 06:09.160]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[06:09.160 --> 06:10.160]  it.
[06:10.160 --> 06:11.160]  Do your part.
[06:11.160 --> 06:13.680]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[06:13.680 --> 06:17.920]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the
[06:17.920 --> 06:22.480]  pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[06:27.920 --> 06:34.920]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[06:34.920 --> 06:41.920]  Prepare yourself for a topical experience like no other.
[06:41.920 --> 06:51.920]  He stands for truth, he stands for justice, he stands for what's right, this is the Alex
[06:51.920 --> 06:52.920]  Jones show.
[06:52.920 --> 07:02.000]  Call Alex now toll-free at 877-590-5525.
[07:02.000 --> 07:06.920]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[07:06.920 --> 07:13.560]  When the Federal Reserve system collapses the economy, when they go into hyperinflation,
[07:13.560 --> 07:18.280]  they will either succeed in setting up their world government out of that crisis or we
[07:18.280 --> 07:22.560]  will succeed in laying the groundwork to educate the public about the fact that these
[07:22.560 --> 07:28.640]  supposed saviors are really the author of our financial doom, of the doom of our prosperity.
[07:28.640 --> 07:33.840]  We are now at that crossroads, this is the critical time for all those that love liberty
[07:33.840 --> 07:38.080]  to educate their friends, family, neighbors, the media about what we truly face.
[07:38.080 --> 07:43.000]  That's why the Federal Reserve has dispatched their bank governors and thousands of their
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.040]  employees to public schools, to corporate conferences, to universities to brainwash
[07:50.040 --> 07:52.760]  the public, that they're actually our savior.
[07:52.760 --> 07:56.480]  And so we are joined now to the bottom of the hour by Congressman Ron Paul.
[07:56.480 --> 08:00.880]  Sir, you've said this is a key time for us and on the House Banking Committee, you're
[08:00.880 --> 08:05.280]  one of the lone voices really exposing what's happening.
[08:05.280 --> 08:08.560]  What is this opportunity and how do we do away with the Federal Reserve?
[08:08.560 --> 08:16.240]  I think everybody knows we're in a crisis right now and they have now gotten to the
[08:16.240 --> 08:20.320]  point where they don't trust the government, which is healthy.
[08:20.320 --> 08:23.600]  A lot of people are begging and pleading and they're lining up.
[08:23.600 --> 08:29.080]  The average guy outside of Washington, especially so many of the young people, are realizing
[08:29.080 --> 08:33.440]  that it's all been a hoax and this is the time to really expose the hoax.
[08:33.440 --> 08:38.120]  So although I've been trying to do that for 30 years to prevent the problems, I think
[08:38.120 --> 08:42.560]  we have a real opportunity now to direct our attention to the real culprit and that is
[08:42.560 --> 08:48.120]  those who control the monetary system, those who counterfeit our money and cause the financial
[08:48.120 --> 08:53.120]  bubbles and then the recession and now they're working real hard on a depression.
[08:53.120 --> 08:58.880]  So it's easy to become despondent and I know a lot of people say, why waste your time?
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.920]  You can't do this and we should just escape and buy guns and all this kind of thing.
[09:03.920 --> 09:09.080]  But I think we should see this as an opportunity because we have made inroads.
[09:09.080 --> 09:15.840]  I think computers and websites and talk radio and the Internet has given us a real opportunity
[09:15.840 --> 09:16.840]  to spread our message.
[09:16.840 --> 09:21.120]  So hopefully I'm not being overly optimistic, but I see it as a chance for us to get our
[09:21.120 --> 09:22.120]  message out.
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.560]  Congressman specifically, eight weeks ago, Congressman Sherman, Senator Inhofe is now
[09:27.560 --> 09:34.160]  on record that enclosed joint committee meeting that Secretary of the Treasury Paulson and
[09:34.160 --> 09:40.960]  Bernanke threatened them with physical martial law, not house rules martial law, but physical
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.840]  martial law and said there will be a depression next Monday, a total stock market collapse
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.440]  if you don't do this and they promised the public total transparency in the banker bill,
[09:50.440 --> 09:51.440]  but I read it.
[09:51.440 --> 09:53.600]  It was clearly a takeover.
[09:53.600 --> 09:59.000]  Now Bloomberg reports as of a week and a half ago, 8.5 trillion stolen.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.080]  The Bloomberg original lawsuit going back six weeks ago and 2 trillion had gone up missing.
[10:05.080 --> 10:11.120]  The Federal Reserve is telling Congress, telling the people, refusing for your request, saying
[10:11.120 --> 10:14.240]  it's secret where the trillions went.
[10:14.240 --> 10:20.640]  Can you speak to, A, the fact that they literally terrorized the public and the Congress to
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.440]  go along with the banker takeover bill?
[10:23.440 --> 10:29.280]  And then now in the aftermath, we see a financial dictatorship forming with the Financial Times
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.720]  of London last week calling for world government and saying the bankers shall be the rulers
[10:34.720 --> 10:35.720]  of the world government.
[10:35.720 --> 10:42.680]  And this is the whole point and that is governments that want to take over and undermine our liberties
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.960]  and have more power always use the fear factor.
[10:46.960 --> 10:51.800]  They did this leading up to the war in Iraq, remember how they said, if we don't go in
[10:51.800 --> 10:54.320]  there, such and such is going to happen.
[10:54.320 --> 10:57.360]  So they build up the fear and they do that on foreign policy.
[10:57.360 --> 11:03.600]  Now they're doing it on economic, monetary and financial problems.
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.920]  And yet the dilemma that we have is that we're scared too.
[11:07.920 --> 11:10.240]  There should be a lot of fear.
[11:10.240 --> 11:12.360]  It's knowing the truth that counts.
[11:12.360 --> 11:20.280]  They use the weapon of fear dishonestly, but in many ways we have to talk about the dangers
[11:20.280 --> 11:21.440]  too.
[11:21.440 --> 11:25.760]  And we should think, I guess, of telling people the truth and being more realistic rather
[11:25.760 --> 11:29.760]  than just beating the drums of fear so that people could capitulate and do anything the
[11:29.760 --> 11:31.280]  government wants.
[11:31.280 --> 11:33.240]  But it is very dangerous.
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.520]  The big question is, do they have any possible answers to this?
[11:36.520 --> 11:37.520]  They scare everybody.
[11:37.520 --> 11:41.000]  Here they've committed eight and a half trillion dollars.
[11:41.000 --> 11:42.200]  They're stealing from the people.
[11:42.200 --> 11:43.200]  They're destroying the dollar.
[11:43.200 --> 11:46.320]  The dollar went down seven percent last week.
[11:46.320 --> 11:52.600]  And they're just making problems so much worse and the ultimate threat to us is not
[11:52.600 --> 11:56.040]  only the loss of wealth and destruction of the dollar, the ultimate threat is the loss
[11:56.040 --> 11:57.040]  of our liberty.
[11:57.040 --> 12:01.360]  How about we said that if we lost everything tomorrow, if we had our liberty and got rid
[12:01.360 --> 12:06.320]  of the IRS and had found money, I think we could all go back to work in realizing that
[12:06.320 --> 12:07.840]  everything we earn, we can keep.
[12:07.840 --> 12:12.040]  I mean, we've become so wealthy so quick we could overcome this mess.
[12:12.040 --> 12:17.200]  But unfortunately, it's an uphill struggle, but we have to fight it.
[12:17.200 --> 12:25.080]  Congressman, specifically, I mean, you are the worldwide leader or the standard bearer
[12:25.080 --> 12:29.080]  for exposing the international banking cartel specifically.
[12:29.080 --> 12:33.040]  Is this economic terrorism to say we're going to have a depression if you don't give us
[12:33.040 --> 12:41.120]  tens of trillions of dollars and then basically take on these omnipotent powers as Congressman
[12:41.120 --> 12:44.640]  Kucinich and committee a few weeks ago called it.
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.280]  I mean, is this not a hardcore criminality?
[12:48.280 --> 12:53.800]  Don't we need to point out that these are criminals, just like Madoff, the former head
[12:53.800 --> 12:58.240]  of the NASDAQ, running his own Ponzi scheme with the brokerage firms.
[12:58.240 --> 13:00.240]  It's now coming out that it's system-wide.
[13:00.240 --> 13:06.440]  I mean, don't we need to call for grand juries to do investigations and indict some of these
[13:06.440 --> 13:10.880]  people because if we don't do that, they're still going to continue to pose as our saviors?
[13:10.880 --> 13:17.960]  Yeah, and we should, but some are more culpable than others because some know exactly what
[13:17.960 --> 13:18.960]  they're doing.
[13:18.960 --> 13:24.920]  But there are so many people that still exist that do get talked in just like very, very
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.520]  good people were talked in to voting to give the president the power to go to war, and
[13:30.520 --> 13:32.360]  they were just too naive and went along with it.
[13:32.360 --> 13:35.240]  A lot of people are doing that now.
[13:35.240 --> 13:38.200]  They didn't want to vote for the bailout, and they heard those threats, and I said,
[13:38.200 --> 13:40.960]  oh, my God, I don't want to be on record of doing this.
[13:40.960 --> 13:43.360]  So they are terrorized by this.
[13:43.360 --> 13:52.160]  But if we go after Madoff, which we should, we don't need more regulatory agencies, what
[13:52.160 --> 13:57.360]  we need is just the enforcement of fraud laws at the point that I can go after these guys.
[13:57.360 --> 13:59.240]  In a way, this is small potatoes.
[13:59.240 --> 14:02.640]  He's small potatoes compared to the fraud of the Federal Reserve.
[14:02.640 --> 14:07.160]  What about the Ponzi scheme called social security?
[14:07.160 --> 14:09.680]  Well, let me ask you this question.
[14:09.680 --> 14:16.000]  Now Congress is talking about taking over even private IRAs and hearings, and then sending
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.400]  the money back to the people as a government check, but taxing it.
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.840]  I mean, they're clearly getting ready to raid the pension funds and social security.
[14:23.840 --> 14:25.440]  How do we stop that?
[14:25.440 --> 14:32.240]  Well, we have to be aware of it, and as it approached, we have to get the people organized.
[14:32.240 --> 14:36.560]  The question will be, are there more people that want the money or more people holding
[14:36.560 --> 14:39.560]  the IRA in a 401K?
[14:39.560 --> 14:44.320]  And unfortunately, there's probably more people on the doll, and they might just not
[14:44.320 --> 14:45.320]  want to fight it.
[14:45.320 --> 14:49.640]  And with the crowd moving in, as bad as the last administration was, when it comes to
[14:49.640 --> 14:57.000]  economic matters and tax matters, I mean, we have even a tougher row to hoe from here
[14:57.000 --> 14:58.000]  on out.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.280]  So, yeah, that one will be hard to fight.
[15:00.280 --> 15:05.280]  But I think what will happen is that before they do that, I think the crisis will build
[15:05.280 --> 15:09.040]  to such a point, and the dollar class will come, because I think that would take them
[15:09.040 --> 15:13.520]  a year or so to do that, and it would just add more fuel to it.
[15:13.520 --> 15:20.440]  But right now, things are moving rather rapidly, and who knows what will come even in the next
[15:20.440 --> 15:21.440]  three?
[15:21.440 --> 15:24.720]  Congressman, we lost you there on your cell phone, and good to have you back.
[15:24.720 --> 15:29.400]  Specifically, sir, on record from you on the banking committee, was it not economic terrorism
[15:29.400 --> 15:34.360]  to have the president and the president elect at the time Barack Obama and others sang before
[15:34.360 --> 15:35.360]  he was even elected?
[15:35.360 --> 15:38.160]  If you don't pass this, we're going to have a depression.
[15:38.160 --> 15:43.160]  That then introduced this idea to people and accelerated the markets dropping a thousand
[15:43.160 --> 15:44.880]  points the day they said that.
[15:44.880 --> 15:46.920]  Was that not economic terrorism?
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.200]  Obviously, it was, and they should be held responsible for this.
[15:52.200 --> 15:55.400]  But like I mentioned, they do that all the time.
[15:55.400 --> 15:59.960]  That's their technique, is always to build the tremendous fear up in the hearts of the
[15:59.960 --> 16:00.960]  people.
[16:00.960 --> 16:04.080]  What it has to do with foreign policy and the reason we have to go to war now on economic
[16:04.080 --> 16:08.160]  matters, terrorize the people and say that we are your saviors and we're the only ones
[16:08.160 --> 16:09.480]  that can take care of you.
[16:09.480 --> 16:15.720]  The only thing that can counteract this is a different philosophy, a convincing argument
[16:15.720 --> 16:20.240]  at free markets and sound money and no Federal Reserve and limited taxes, the things that
[16:20.240 --> 16:21.360]  made America great.
[16:21.360 --> 16:25.960]  We have to get more people and endorse our views, and I think the opportunity is coming
[16:25.960 --> 16:32.280]  because the system that they're trying to patch together right now will not work.
[16:32.280 --> 16:37.240]  With food prices soaring to all-time highs, as the dollar continues to fall in value,
[16:37.240 --> 16:41.200]  what can you and your family do to guarantee that fresh nutritious vegetables will make

[18:35.480 --> 18:37.360]  Goal opened this morning at 8.3930.
[18:37.360 --> 18:44.120]  A one ounce cold coin can be purchased for $8.6425, $4.3212 for the half ounce and $2.1606

[18:59.240 --> 19:00.840]  Bad news for US currency.
[19:00.840 --> 19:03.120]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[19:03.120 --> 19:04.720]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[19:04.720 --> 19:08.000]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro, erosion accelerates.
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.200]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US, loss of confidence causing more selling.
[19:12.200 --> 19:14.840]  GAO is warning about the debt spilling out of control.

[20:22.840 --> 20:30.920]  So don't delay, call today, 908-691-2608 and see what our powder, seeds and oil can do
[20:30.920 --> 20:31.920]  for you.
[20:31.920 --> 20:57.440]  We have one of the, well the chief of the IMF saying we're probably going to have riots
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.720]  worldwide if they quote don't get things going.
[21:00.720 --> 21:05.120]  If you look at the IMF World Bank documents that got leaked to the BBC in late 2001, they
[21:05.120 --> 21:10.280]  state that they cut off liquidity by design to implode markets so that they can then come
[21:10.280 --> 21:14.120]  in and buy things up for pennies on the dollar.
[21:14.120 --> 21:15.120]  Can you speak to that?
[21:15.120 --> 21:22.360]  Well, not clearly because I don't know if that's true, I suspect that it might be, but
[21:22.360 --> 21:27.360]  I also think that this is such a big bubble that even those with a lot of money get a
[21:27.360 --> 21:29.480]  little bit nervous about what's happening.
[21:29.480 --> 21:37.600]  But one thing for sure is they're pretty capable of shifting, so if it goes sour, worse than
[21:37.600 --> 21:41.800]  they expect, because I don't think they have perfect control, but they're always available
[21:41.800 --> 21:43.000]  and they do have cash.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.280]  They're not arguing there's a little bit of cash and just think of all this new credit.
[21:46.280 --> 21:49.960]  So there's a lot of money sitting there ready to be bought up and it won't be the average
[21:49.960 --> 21:53.280]  guy on the street that lost everything in the stock market.
[21:53.280 --> 21:57.280]  It's going to be these people who got out a little sooner or got new credit from the
[21:57.280 --> 22:02.360]  Fed, Goldman Sachs will be around for a while, and the money market accounts have trillions
[22:02.360 --> 22:07.000]  of dollars, so somebody is going to buy this up, but it's not going to be a return to the
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.240]  market economy at the rate we're going.
[22:09.240 --> 22:14.000]  Well, I mean, the basic fundamental, and I'd like to get your take on this, Congressman,
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.480]  we're again talking to Congressman Ron Paul from Texas, dealing with this.
[22:18.480 --> 22:23.240]  I mean, clearly the authors of the economic collapse we're witnessing in the worldwide
[22:23.240 --> 22:29.160]  depression that this whole crisis is spiraling into are now posing and positioning themselves
[22:29.160 --> 22:30.840]  as the saviors.
[22:30.840 --> 22:37.360]  And the mainstream media, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, every time I'm watching a banking committee,
[22:37.360 --> 22:41.080]  the house banking, Senate banking, every time I'm watching one of the subcommittees,
[22:41.080 --> 22:47.000]  they will show Kashkari, they will show Paulson, they will show other operatives of the system,
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.240]  they will show their propaganda, but as soon as it cuts to the chairman or to yourself
[22:51.240 --> 22:54.720]  or to any other member of the committees, they cut away.
[22:54.720 --> 23:00.240]  So clearly the big banking cartels are controlling and owning much of the media, so how do we
[23:00.240 --> 23:04.240]  get around that when they won't let the public understand what's really happening?
[23:04.240 --> 23:08.680]  Well, you have to recognize it, and you have to do your best to get around it, although
[23:08.680 --> 23:11.360]  I complain just as you are complaining.
[23:11.360 --> 23:16.960]  I'm still getting a lot more interviews now than I did a year ago on this issue, so it's
[23:16.960 --> 23:22.440]  not completely blocked out, but there's a lot of what you say that goes on.
[23:22.440 --> 23:25.480]  But then we have to go around them if nothing else.
[23:25.480 --> 23:28.320]  What I fear is them closing down the internet.
[23:28.320 --> 23:32.120]  That to me would be the big problem if they take that away from us.
[23:32.120 --> 23:35.280]  So we've been able to reach millions of people through the internet, and you reach a lot
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.000]  of people on the radio, so they start cracking down on radios and internet and shortwave
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.280]  and all these things, then that's when we're really in big trouble.
[23:44.280 --> 23:47.880]  Well, as you know, they've openly in Congress talked about bringing back the fairness doctrine,
[23:47.880 --> 23:55.360]  this Internet 2 doctor, I'm sure you know, but for the audience, they are shifting basically
[23:55.360 --> 24:00.240]  all the new upgrades to Internet 2, where private corporations own it and control it,
[24:00.240 --> 24:03.400]  and then they admit they're not going to allow free speech, they're only going to give people
[24:03.400 --> 24:07.560]  a few thousand websites and not the hundreds of millions that are currently available.
[24:07.560 --> 24:09.560]  So what they're doing is hijacking the web.
[24:09.560 --> 24:14.240]  Okay, Congressman Ron Paul, and we've only got about five minutes left with you right
[24:14.240 --> 24:15.240]  now, sir.
[24:15.240 --> 24:19.760]  Specifically, there is an Army War College report out, and you know about North Common
[24:19.760 --> 24:23.200]  Outs in 20,000 combat trips for the streets of America.
[24:23.200 --> 24:27.240]  They're openly stating it is for civil unrest and rioting.
[24:27.240 --> 24:31.240]  The new report's called The Knows and Unknowns, Unconventional Strategic Shock and Defense
[24:31.240 --> 24:32.480]  Strategy Development.
[24:32.480 --> 24:37.000]  The Army openly says in here on the Army War College that they are preparing to engage
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.760]  the American people, Posse Commentaris has not been fully removed.
[24:41.760 --> 24:48.840]  I mean, we're now seeing open martial law being discussed and being debated as if it
[24:48.840 --> 24:50.440]  is the solution.
[24:50.440 --> 24:55.120]  They're saying that governors will be under the control of the president and will serve
[24:55.120 --> 24:56.280]  it his pleasure.
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.280]  Can you speak to that?
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.440]  Well, I think what you are doing is just pointing out the danger of using the fear factor
[25:02.440 --> 25:07.680]  for our foreign policy and our financial problems, and now they do it for your physical safety,
[25:07.680 --> 25:12.800]  which to me is just a continuation of the 9-11, post-9-11 attitude, because that was
[25:12.800 --> 25:16.600]  when they started passing, getting passed all the legislation that they had proposed
[25:16.600 --> 25:17.600]  for so many years.
[25:17.600 --> 25:21.200]  Now, they're saying, well, we're going to have chaos in the streets.
[25:21.200 --> 25:24.360]  The terrorists aren't going to be people from outside.
[25:24.360 --> 25:25.960]  The terrorists are going to be our own people.
[25:25.960 --> 25:30.680]  There's going to be chaos here in the streets, and it's a consequence of the financial crisis.
[25:30.680 --> 25:34.280]  So therefore, we have to militarize our community.
[25:34.280 --> 25:40.680]  And once again, that attitude, that government is our savior, and they can't save us.
[25:40.680 --> 25:48.360]  I mean, all the SEC and all the regulations can't protect us against fraud, and all the
[25:48.360 --> 25:51.600]  policemen in the world can't protect us in our homes.
[25:51.600 --> 25:57.080]  Congressman Continuing, and the time we have left, specifically, they are saying they're
[25:57.080 --> 25:59.680]  preparing to engage the American people.
[25:59.680 --> 26:01.200]  Is this unconstitutional?
[26:01.200 --> 26:02.200]  Is this treason?
[26:02.200 --> 26:09.360]  Well, it's obviously not constitutional, and depending on how it comes about, it could
[26:09.360 --> 26:14.240]  very well be treasonous, but on how the confrontation comes.
[26:14.240 --> 26:17.120]  Of course, they would never say that they're confronting.
[26:17.120 --> 26:21.280]  They might use those terms, but they might say we're confronting violence, and we're
[26:21.280 --> 26:22.720]  going there to save you.
[26:22.720 --> 26:26.200]  We don't want your cities burnt out, so therefore, we're going to put our troops in there to
[26:26.200 --> 26:27.360]  prevent these problems.
[26:27.360 --> 26:32.200]  So, just think of all the harm that they've done over these last, especially the last
[26:32.200 --> 26:33.200]  hundred years.
[26:33.200 --> 26:35.760]  How often do they really get hauled into the court?
[26:35.760 --> 26:38.800]  And what about the illegality of the whole monetary system?
[26:38.800 --> 26:40.200]  Nothing really happens.
[26:40.200 --> 26:46.320]  So it depends on what the people understand and believe in that really counts, so we cannot
[26:46.320 --> 26:48.800]  depend on the Congress or our courts to save us.
[26:48.800 --> 26:52.720]  Well, sir, going back over the last 20 years, as you know, they've been covertly getting
[26:52.720 --> 26:56.440]  rid of Posse Comintatus, merging the military and police, and now they're acting like they
[26:56.440 --> 26:58.200]  just set this up last week.
[26:58.200 --> 27:01.200]  This is part of a larger strategic plan.
[27:01.200 --> 27:03.800]  Yeah, and matter of fact, they did pass a couple years ago.
[27:03.800 --> 27:08.480]  I think it was in 1996 in the supplemental serious erosion of Posse Comintatus, and it
[27:08.480 --> 27:13.560]  was finally exposed, and then it was, in a way, reversed.
[27:13.560 --> 27:14.560]  But that's just tokenism.
[27:14.560 --> 27:19.000]  I mean, if they feel like doing something wrong, they just go ahead and do it.
[27:19.000 --> 27:24.520]  So the fact that they reversed that in a token wage and reassured us, because when push comes
[27:24.520 --> 27:27.400]  to shove, they're going to ignore it, but they would change the law when they get the
[27:27.400 --> 27:28.400]  opportunity.
[27:28.400 --> 27:32.120]  And this new administration, I'm sure, would be quite capable of doing it, even without
[27:32.120 --> 27:33.120]  the Congress.
[27:33.120 --> 27:34.680]  You know about executive orders.
[27:34.680 --> 27:38.240]  Sir, in closing, two final questions in the two minutes we have left with you.
[27:38.240 --> 27:41.760]  Did you see the article in Financial Times of London admitting that they've covertly
[27:41.760 --> 27:46.280]  set up world government, the headline, and now for world government admitting, I mean,
[27:46.280 --> 27:49.800]  do they need to apologize all the people that called us coops because we were reading the
[27:49.800 --> 27:51.360]  internal white papers?
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.680]  Well, no, they're not going to apologize.
[27:54.680 --> 27:59.680]  I didn't happen to see that article, but, you know, when Bernanke was before the committee
[27:59.680 --> 28:04.080]  the last time, I wanted to know what kind of international plans he had for the currency
[28:04.080 --> 28:05.680]  and a World Central Bank.
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.360]  Of course, he has no obligation to answer any of those questions.
[28:09.360 --> 28:14.720]  He has a moral obligation, but under the law, he doesn't under the Constitution, he should.
[28:14.720 --> 28:17.920]  So yeah, I think those plans are being laid.
[28:17.920 --> 28:19.480]  People say, well, it's not going to happen.
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.360]  But, you know, they used to say that the European Union wouldn't ever happen.
[28:23.360 --> 28:26.320]  So I think we should take this stuff seriously.
[28:26.320 --> 28:30.480]  And this morning, there was a pretty strong announcement by the IMF that their vehicle
[28:30.480 --> 28:36.760]  is going to be these SDRs, these special drawing rights, what they used to call paper gold,
[28:36.760 --> 28:39.320]  will be the Worldwide Reserve Currency.
[28:39.320 --> 28:42.760]  They tried to do it, it didn't work, but now they see another opening.
[28:42.760 --> 28:46.200]  So it's world government oven by the bankers, sir.
[28:46.200 --> 28:49.440]  As a rallying cry, we can defeat this world government, can't we?
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.440]  What are the people that you do?
[28:50.440 --> 28:56.280]  Well, the truth is on our side, and also the economic policy is on our side.
[28:56.280 --> 29:00.160]  What was the most important thing is information to the people so they know what we're doing,
[29:00.160 --> 29:04.560]  know what's in their best interest, not to have people in Congress keep voting for hell
[29:04.560 --> 29:05.560]  out.
[29:05.560 --> 29:08.320]  And this pretends that we're going to take care of everybody.
[29:08.320 --> 29:11.440]  So knowledge is the only answer to the problems that we have today.
[29:11.440 --> 29:14.960]  And as you said earlier, they are coming after the Internet.
[29:14.960 --> 29:20.640]  Yep, that's what, that is my greatest fear, because we'll never be able to control the
[29:20.640 --> 29:24.440]  three majors, but right now we can get around them.
[29:24.440 --> 29:27.880]  The more knowledge is out there, the more we can make inroads to the average person that
[29:27.880 --> 29:28.880]  does appear.
[29:28.880 --> 29:29.880]  Congressman?
[29:29.880 --> 29:30.880]  They can't control everybody's mind.
[29:30.880 --> 29:31.880]  I want you to have a great Christmas.
[29:31.880 --> 29:32.880]  Let me see.
[29:32.880 --> 29:33.880]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[29:33.880 --> 29:35.600]  What does humidity mean to you?
[29:35.600 --> 29:40.000]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.360]  that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[29:43.360 --> 29:46.360]  It's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.

[30:32.280 --> 30:37.120]  Led from solder and copper pipes, mercury from fish, dental fillings, vaccines, arsenic
[30:37.120 --> 30:41.960]  in the water, these heavy metal toxins are difficult or even impossible to avoid.
[30:41.960 --> 30:45.920]  Even trace amounts of these heavy metals over time can impact your health.
[30:45.920 --> 30:49.880]  Many health problems have been suggested as being related to this heavy metal exposure,
[30:49.880 --> 30:54.080]  including memory loss, high blood pressure, depression, mood swings, speech disorders,
[30:54.080 --> 30:57.440]  neuropathy, autoimmune diseases, chronic fatigue, and more.
[30:57.440 --> 31:01.680]  Unfortunately, traditional detoxifying isn't able to clear the body of these harmful and
[31:01.680 --> 31:03.720]  potentially deadly toxins.
[31:03.720 --> 31:06.160]  That's why there's PuraClear from Ripple Creek.
[31:06.160 --> 31:10.680]  PuraClear contains a proprietary blend of ingredients including a cilantro extract and
[31:10.680 --> 31:15.640]  alphalipoic acid, among other ingredients formulated specifically to promote body cleansing.

[31:32.520 --> 31:35.960]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[31:35.960 --> 31:37.920]  Only to find the one that you have is broken.
[31:37.920 --> 31:40.600]  The batteries are dead or it's just not bright enough.

[31:47.240 --> 31:50.440]  battery and uses two high-powered LED lights.

[31:53.960 --> 31:58.760]  The pack light can survive severe impact, be frozen solid, and still work flawlessly.
[31:58.760 --> 32:02.760]  The pack light is so durable, soldiers overseas rely on them, and has been featured in The

[32:31.680 --> 32:35.600]  When you're out driving this holiday season, keep in mind you're being watched.
[32:35.600 --> 32:39.920]  Whether you know it or not, red light and speed cameras are everywhere ready to snap
[32:39.920 --> 32:42.040]  a photo of your license plate.
[32:42.040 --> 32:47.640]  One simple, harmless error could end up costing you over $500 quickly putting an end to your

[32:49.000 --> 32:50.960]  Fight back with Photo Blocker.
[32:50.960 --> 32:53.560]  Simply spray your plate once and you're done.
[32:53.560 --> 32:58.400]  Any photos of your license plate will appear overexposed, making them virtually unreadable.
[32:58.400 --> 33:02.800]  See the newscast showing just how Photo Blocker works against traffic cameras.
[33:02.800 --> 33:06.880]  Christmas is here and the economy is in bad enough shape without spending hundreds of
[33:06.880 --> 33:12.120]  dollars in fees that can be avoided with one simple application of Photo Blocker.
[33:12.120 --> 33:14.000]  Go to sprayyourplate.com.
[33:14.000 --> 33:21.000]  That's sprayyourplate.com or call 1-800-276-9601.
[33:21.000 --> 33:25.360]  That's 1-800-276-9601.
[33:25.360 --> 33:27.280]  Don't give your money to the state.
[33:27.280 --> 33:34.280]  Spray your plate and when the cameras flash, you'll save some cash.
[33:57.680 --> 34:04.680]  If we can project the future through a historical lens with a wide range of data integrated in
[34:07.600 --> 34:14.600]  to the great gift God gave us our mind, we can accurately forecast the future.
[34:16.960 --> 34:23.960]  I have accurately forecasted the future on hundreds of occasions, but somebody's been
[34:23.960 --> 34:30.960]  doing it a lot longer than I have, and with amazing, I'd say 95-plus percent accuracy
[34:31.400 --> 34:33.760]  is Gerald Salente.
[34:33.760 --> 34:38.800]  Now, over a year ago, the British Ministry of Defense basically forecasted everything
[34:38.800 --> 34:41.960]  they're doing right now, and they admitted that they basically worked for foreign offshore
[34:41.960 --> 34:46.640]  banks, that it's a world government, and that this is being done by design.
[34:46.640 --> 34:51.320]  This year, the military, the Pentagon, and the U.S. put out a similar report, but they
[34:51.320 --> 34:55.120]  know the general public is not reading these reports, so a lot of this isn't even forecasting
[34:55.120 --> 34:56.760]  for myself.
[34:56.760 --> 35:02.960]  It is going out and reading what the internal government documents are stating, and if we
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.800]  do not face up to what's happening, if we do not face up to what's unfolding, it is
[35:07.800 --> 35:08.920]  only going to get worse.
[35:08.920 --> 35:14.000]  Now, the military is broad, paints with a broad brush when they talk about this.
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.760]  Gerald Salente has been very specific that there would be worldwide riots starting, and
[35:20.760 --> 35:26.920]  he said that about a year ago, and now, voila, we see it happening, and now we see the IMF,
[35:26.920 --> 35:31.600]  World Bank, and others echoing this in the military, saying that they are prepared to
[35:31.600 --> 35:34.240]  suppress the American people.
[35:34.240 --> 35:37.640]  They also spin this in the media and say the Greeks are rioting because the police shot
[35:37.640 --> 35:40.760]  a 15-year-old in the back.
[35:40.760 --> 35:45.880]  But if you read the Greek websites, the Greek news, they're saying, no, everything's being
[35:45.880 --> 35:48.160]  privatized, and that's not free market.
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.720]  The roads, the power plants, the universities, it's all being handed over to the IMF and
[35:52.720 --> 35:53.720]  World Bank.
[35:53.720 --> 35:54.720]  They're being looted.
[35:54.720 --> 35:55.720]  They're being robbed.
[35:55.720 --> 35:58.400]  They're losing all their jobs.
[35:58.400 --> 36:00.800]  Their currency's being devalued.
[36:00.800 --> 36:04.600]  The European Union is absorbing them and destroying them.
[36:04.600 --> 36:09.240]  Just last week, the Financial Times of London admitted that the New World Order is anti-democratic
[36:09.240 --> 36:13.680]  and is tyrannical, but that's a good thing.
[36:13.680 --> 36:19.240]  Gavin Zandrow's Pritchard came out on a telegraph last Thursday and said that we're going to
[36:19.240 --> 36:24.880]  see riots worldwide because of globalism and because it is tyrannical, so here we have
[36:24.880 --> 36:25.880]  it.
[36:25.880 --> 36:30.320]  It's unfolding, but we're going to get specific forecasts in the next hour and a half from
[36:30.320 --> 36:36.040]  Gerald Salente on what he specifically sees happening in the next month, the next year,
[36:36.040 --> 36:40.080]  the next two years, the next three years, and then some solutions, how we prepare for
[36:40.080 --> 36:42.440]  it in his educated opinion.
[36:42.440 --> 36:47.960]  You can go to his website, TrendsResearch.com and watch all the videos of him going back
[36:47.960 --> 36:54.880]  decades ago, making accurate predictions years beforehand, and of course CNN, ABC, Fox, of
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.640]  all called him the best predictor of future trends out there, and so we're very, very
[37:00.640 --> 37:04.520]  honored to have him on the show with us today.
[37:04.520 --> 37:06.480]  Mr. Salente, it's good to have you back with us.
[37:06.480 --> 37:09.840]  Oh, thanks so much for having me, Alex.
[37:09.840 --> 37:13.680]  You know what, instead of Alex Jones throwing out a bunch of questions out of the gate,
[37:13.680 --> 37:17.240]  what is most important to Gerald Salente right now?
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.880]  What do the listeners need to know is coming up in the future according to your crystal
[37:21.880 --> 37:22.880]  bulb?
[37:22.880 --> 37:24.960]  Well, you really hit upon it.
[37:24.960 --> 37:28.480]  We're going to see revolutions.
[37:28.480 --> 37:30.840]  This whole system is falling apart.
[37:30.840 --> 37:33.320]  There is no salvaging it.
[37:33.320 --> 37:40.440]  When you look at the steps that are being taken, we call it the Bernanke two-step, the Federal
[37:40.440 --> 37:46.440]  Reserve Chairman, and that of course is either adjust interest rates, which they've now adjusted
[37:46.440 --> 37:55.120]  to a point where they can't be adjusted anymore, or print more money, and they've done both,
[37:55.120 --> 38:03.000]  and neither of those two actions have stemmed the unraveling of the U.S. economy, or the
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.880]  world economy, for that matter.
[38:05.880 --> 38:11.360]  The governments, the local state governments, including of course the federal government
[38:11.360 --> 38:16.800]  as well, the only other solution that they're doing is they're squeezing the little people
[38:16.800 --> 38:18.160]  for more money.
[38:18.160 --> 38:22.360]  Back here in New York, I'm sure it's making the national news as well.
[38:22.360 --> 38:29.320]  They put taxes as much as 18% on soda pop, 8% for a taxi ride.
[38:29.320 --> 38:35.920]  They just increase the transit fares, and in doing so, they've decreased the amount
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.360]  of available subways, cutting back on the buses.
[38:40.360 --> 38:44.920]  They're even bringing in new subway cars now to really squeeze the little people, just
[38:44.920 --> 38:46.760]  like they do in China.
[38:46.760 --> 38:52.200]  They're taking out the seats so that they can push people in like cattle.
[38:52.200 --> 38:59.280]  We're going to see the little people squeezed, by the way, is one of our top trends for 2009.
[38:59.280 --> 39:03.040]  While you were saying that a year ago, now they've announced, as you said, 88 new taxes
[39:03.040 --> 39:07.440]  in New York state alone, hundreds of other taxes all over the place.
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.120]  The people just don't have the money to pay for all of this, and so as the IMF and World
[39:12.120 --> 39:18.200]  Bank documents stated in late 2001, they want the people to riot so they can then bring
[39:18.200 --> 39:19.600]  in the army against them.
[39:19.600 --> 39:23.760]  We've had decades of secret training by the military to take over the West.
[39:23.760 --> 39:27.880]  Now they're announcing from France to Germany to England to the United States to Canada
[39:27.880 --> 39:34.360]  that indeed, it's in major papers, martial law is good, the troops will suppress you.
[39:34.360 --> 39:36.360]  This really is a financial coup.
[39:36.360 --> 39:37.360]  We're witnessing.
[39:37.360 --> 39:38.360]  Can you speak to that?
[39:38.360 --> 39:41.600]  Well, it's definitely a financial coup.
[39:41.600 --> 39:46.840]  Wall Street is hijacked Washington in broad daylight.
[39:46.840 --> 39:53.920]  We now, as we know, of course, the US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, is a Goldman Sachs
[39:53.920 --> 39:56.040]  man, former CEO.
[39:56.040 --> 40:01.520]  They're bringing in now Obama, backtrack Obama, we call him, the man of change.
[40:01.520 --> 40:03.400]  Of course, there's no change.
[40:03.400 --> 40:08.880]  They're bringing in Timothy Geithner, the Federal Reserve Chairman, the Federal Reserve
[40:08.880 --> 40:14.920]  President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, President of the New York Federal Reserve,
[40:14.920 --> 40:20.000]  and they're just bringing the whole crew of Wall Street people running Washington.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.080]  So it's being done in broad daylight as well as these bailouts.
[40:24.080 --> 40:32.600]  They may have all the plans in place, and they may be very, the Illuminati, so to speak,
[40:32.600 --> 40:35.960]  may have their agenda laid out.
[40:35.960 --> 40:42.120]  But when you see what's going on, it has to be the Illuminati that's executing their
[40:42.120 --> 40:48.400]  plans because no matter what they do, they're not going to be able to stop the amount of
[40:48.400 --> 40:50.920]  uprising that's going to pour forth.
[40:50.920 --> 40:59.440]  I'm a Bronx boy originally, and I know what the city looks like.
[40:59.440 --> 41:03.920]  We have a saying here at the Trends Research Institute.
[41:03.920 --> 41:10.280]  When people lose everything, and they have nothing to lose, they lose it, and this is
[41:10.280 --> 41:13.240]  what these white shoe boys don't understand.
[41:13.240 --> 41:18.480]  You know, the Princeton Hall of it, Yale crowd that had the Silver Spoon, because they're
[41:18.480 --> 41:22.960]  arrogant yuppies who think they're God and have disdain for everybody, and they think
[41:22.960 --> 41:23.960]  it's cute.
[41:23.960 --> 41:28.240]  They've stolen 8.5 trillion, and those numbers are two weeks old now, folks.
[41:28.240 --> 41:31.800]  It's over a trillion, 300 billion, they steal a week, so it's over 10 trillion.
[41:31.800 --> 41:36.040]  You watch the next week or two, that number will come out, but 8.5 trillion admittedly
[41:36.040 --> 41:42.120]  stolen, and these arrogant yuppies, these arrogant frat boys, are telling Congress,
[41:42.120 --> 41:46.000]  you don't get to know where the money went, and we have the Army standing by.
[41:46.000 --> 41:49.160]  That's what Paulson told them.
[41:49.160 --> 41:54.200]  This is insane, megalomaniacal hubris, so where is this going?
[41:54.200 --> 41:59.300]  I mean, is they just openly hijack everything, steal everything, and say, we're going to
[41:59.300 --> 42:01.360]  squeeze you down to nothing?
[42:01.360 --> 42:06.720]  Exactly, and what we're saying is, it's going to be beyond their control.
[42:06.720 --> 42:14.000]  This is the beginning of the Second Revolution, and it's going to be worldwide.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.480]  There's no stopping it.
[42:15.480 --> 42:22.080]  So as the trends that we're looking at for 2009, the revolution is the third among them.
[42:22.080 --> 42:30.200]  The first one is, that's going to begin to precipitate this, is the great collapse.
[42:30.200 --> 42:36.800]  As you well know, exactly this time last year, we came out with the panic of our late.
[42:36.800 --> 42:41.720]  We said Americans would wake up in 2008, and the financial markets would unravel, there
[42:41.720 --> 42:43.360]  would be no stopping it.
[42:43.360 --> 42:48.680]  Now we're saying it's going to be the collapse of 2009, and let me explain why.
[42:48.680 --> 42:53.640]  In 2008, most of the focus in the media has been on the financial markets and the real
[42:53.640 --> 42:54.640]  estate markets.
[42:54.640 --> 42:57.080]  Of course, they're intertwined.
[42:57.080 --> 43:02.040]  Now what we're going to see is the great retail crash come from a very, very dismal
[43:02.040 --> 43:03.160]  Christmas.
[43:03.160 --> 43:09.160]  As a result of that, you're going to start seeing major chains going bankrupt after the
[43:09.160 --> 43:13.680]  Christmas holiday, probably around January, middle of January.
[43:13.680 --> 43:19.320]  There's going to be some kind of a bit of euphoria, because people are still hoping
[43:19.320 --> 43:24.480]  that their man of change will somehow miraculously bring about change, and of course, he said
[43:24.480 --> 43:30.600]  he was going to heal the nation and repair the world, so Obama has great plans ahead,
[43:30.600 --> 43:38.160]  and there are people that actually...
[43:38.160 --> 43:44.120]  The time clock is ticking, laws could change, the new world order is advancing rapidly,
[43:44.120 --> 43:50.840]  health consciousness is fading away, junk food, fast food, fat food is the new world
[43:50.840 --> 43:57.440]  orders game, don't play the game, slim down, detox and cleanse yourself from the chemical
[43:57.440 --> 44:00.640]  foods and processed food that we intake daily.
[44:00.640 --> 44:04.760]  And now for the holiday special, buy one month of super tea and we'll throw in an extra
[44:04.760 --> 44:05.760]  two weeks.
[44:05.760 --> 44:10.240]  That's right, one month of super tea and we'll throw in an extra two weeks, it won't last
[44:10.240 --> 44:21.720]  long, so order now, getthetea.com, that's getthetea.com, or call us at 928-308-0408,

[44:27.920 --> 44:35.000]  So you've finally decided you're going to stock up and store food.

[45:39.400 --> 45:41.920]  numbers and personal information from thieves?
[45:41.920 --> 45:45.840]  There are now millions of credit cards, debit cards and passports in circulation that contain
[45:45.840 --> 45:47.480]  an RFID chip.
[45:47.480 --> 45:51.880]  These new cards and passports make transactions a breeze, but introduce a new threat to your
[45:51.880 --> 45:53.240]  personal information.
[45:53.240 --> 45:56.440]  These cards can be read while still in your wallet or purse.

[46:35.160 --> 46:36.160]  bad to me?
[46:36.160 --> 46:39.360]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government
[46:39.360 --> 46:41.360]  will jump right in to feed you and yours?
[46:41.360 --> 46:44.280]  Do you have at least a year's supply of food for your family?

[47:14.600 --> 47:15.600]  flock.
[47:15.600 --> 47:34.480]  Those who don't learn from history are bound to repeat it.

[47:36.800 --> 47:42.240]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[47:42.240 --> 47:50.120]  We're aging for the truth, exposing corruption, dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.120]  He's Alex Jones.
[47:52.120 --> 47:58.160]  So we're going to wait till after the inauguration, June, January 20th, before the real pressure
[47:58.160 --> 48:00.160]  starts to hit.
[48:00.160 --> 48:05.200]  And when they find out that he is actually a bigger cheerleader than Bush for the banker
[48:05.200 --> 48:10.960]  takeover and that he is their man, how long until the people become disillusioned with
[48:10.960 --> 48:12.560]  their new corporate savior?
[48:12.560 --> 48:14.000]  Well this is where we're going.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.880]  So now February comes along, things get really very cold and dismal and bleak.
[48:19.880 --> 48:24.280]  We're going to start seeing, as I said, major retailers folding.
[48:24.280 --> 48:26.520]  Now let's think of what happens.
[48:26.520 --> 48:34.920]  We've already seen KB Toys, Shopper Image, Circuit City, Linnons and things, Steve and
[48:34.920 --> 48:37.240]  Barry's go under it, plus many more.
[48:37.240 --> 48:38.240]  Are you kidding?
[48:38.240 --> 48:40.200]  Half my favorite restaurants in Austin aren't there anymore?
[48:40.200 --> 48:41.200]  They're not there anymore.
[48:41.200 --> 48:46.080]  So now we're going to see major chains start to fold.
[48:46.080 --> 48:49.800]  Who is going to rent these vacant spaces?
[48:49.800 --> 48:50.800]  Who?
[48:50.800 --> 48:51.800]  Nobody.
[48:51.800 --> 49:00.480]  You're going to start seeing empty stores throughout malls, throughout strip malls.
[49:00.480 --> 49:02.200]  Now let's bring it to another level.
[49:02.200 --> 49:07.440]  And won't that further destroy confidence when people see the physical manifestation
[49:07.440 --> 49:10.040]  of a economy and cardiac arrest?
[49:10.040 --> 49:11.040]  Very precisely.
[49:11.040 --> 49:15.640]  So the psychological impact is as great.
[49:15.640 --> 49:18.960]  Now let's move over to another sector of commercial.
[49:18.960 --> 49:23.040]  We're already seeing the financial markets, they've collapsed.
[49:23.040 --> 49:26.480]  Empty buildings on and on and on.
[49:26.480 --> 49:30.040]  People are being fired every day and we see the numbers.
[49:30.040 --> 49:36.760]  What was Bank of America last week, 52,000, couple of weeks early, a city group.
[49:36.760 --> 49:37.760]  And I love it.
[49:37.760 --> 49:38.880]  Bank of America, they came out.
[49:38.880 --> 49:43.160]  They said that these 52,000 would be fired over a three-year period.
[49:43.160 --> 49:45.720]  Yeah, like they could look three years ahead of time.
[49:45.720 --> 49:49.680]  They can't plan lunch, so we get this straight.
[49:49.680 --> 49:51.720]  These people are being fired right away.
[49:51.720 --> 49:56.720]  The point being, now you're going to have the next shoot of fall is going to be the
[49:56.720 --> 50:05.120]  commercial real estate sector, which was leveraged far greater than the home real estate sector.
[50:05.120 --> 50:11.200]  So now you're going to see the collapse, the retail sector collapses, commercial real estate
[50:11.200 --> 50:12.200]  collapses.
[50:12.200 --> 50:15.600]  There is no body left to save anymore.
[50:15.600 --> 50:20.640]  The crash keeps coming harder and harder and louder and louder.
[50:20.640 --> 50:22.720]  So that's the second phase.
[50:22.720 --> 50:28.480]  The third phase after the crash, so first we had the panic, then we had the collapse,
[50:28.480 --> 50:31.600]  and now we're going to go into the greatest depression.
[50:31.600 --> 50:35.960]  And it's going to be worse than the last depression, although of course Bernanke, and
[50:35.960 --> 50:41.880]  I was doing an interview and the host said to me, well, Fed Chairman Bernanke is a student
[50:41.880 --> 50:47.600]  of the Great Depression, and he says there won't be one this time around.
[50:47.600 --> 50:52.840]  And I say, why would anybody believe anyone who hasn't predicted what was happening, going
[50:52.840 --> 50:57.240]  to happen, and has everything that they've said has come out false?
[50:57.240 --> 51:00.240]  So why would anybody give any credence to this person?
[51:00.240 --> 51:05.720]  That's right, I happened to be watching Kavuto last night just briefly, and he said the 15
[51:05.720 --> 51:10.480]  grand Puba financial experts he had on a year and a half ago said it was over.
[51:10.480 --> 51:13.040]  We were going into green pastures.
[51:13.040 --> 51:14.040]  Everything was wonderful.
[51:14.040 --> 51:17.280]  Well, what Kavuto won't tell you is those guys aren't stupid.
[51:17.280 --> 51:18.280]  They're liars.
[51:18.280 --> 51:22.240]  They've been busy positioning their money, you know, buying their private retreats in
[51:22.240 --> 51:24.080]  Dubai and Paraguay.
[51:24.080 --> 51:28.200]  They've been busy getting their money offshore while they told the suckers to keep pumping
[51:28.200 --> 51:30.080]  their money in.
[51:30.080 --> 51:32.560]  That's right, and that's what they do.
[51:32.560 --> 51:34.480]  You know, it's a suckers' game.
[51:34.480 --> 51:38.640]  These are Wall Street cons, like Coney Island blockers.
[51:38.640 --> 51:43.720]  So now what happens, here's why it's going to be worse than the Great Depression and
[51:43.720 --> 51:46.680]  why we're calling it the greatest depression.
[51:46.680 --> 51:52.200]  Back in the 1930s, most people didn't own homes, so they weren't paying these mortgages.
[51:52.200 --> 51:53.720]  They weren't paying insurance.
[51:53.720 --> 51:58.680]  They weren't paying upkeep and all the other expenses it keeps them from running home.
[51:58.680 --> 52:02.240]  But two, there was no such thing as home equity loans.
[52:02.240 --> 52:06.440]  Matter of fact, back then, if somebody had what they called a second mortgage, that meant
[52:06.440 --> 52:09.160]  that they were a loser and they needed money.
[52:09.160 --> 52:11.640]  Back then, Americans didn't have credit cards.
[52:11.640 --> 52:12.920]  They didn't exist.
[52:12.920 --> 52:16.560]  So the people weren't $14 trillion in debt.
[52:16.560 --> 52:19.640]  And back then, we had a trade surplus.
[52:19.640 --> 52:26.080]  We were not $700 billion in the hole each year, and we had budget surpluses.
[52:26.080 --> 52:27.080]  What are we at this year?
[52:27.080 --> 52:29.560]  $2 trillion, $1 trillion, and the number keeps changing.
[52:29.560 --> 52:34.600]  Oh, now the defense budget's over a trillion, not even counting the supplementals.
[52:34.600 --> 52:38.640]  The Bush triple, the size of government, and all these other governments are just growing,
[52:38.640 --> 52:39.640]  growing, growing.
[52:39.640 --> 52:45.000]  Again, don't they understand that they can only put so much weight on the donkey's back?
[52:45.000 --> 52:50.280]  No, they don't, because they've never had difficult financial times in their lives.
[52:50.280 --> 52:53.280]  And unless you've experienced it, you don't know how to deal with it.
[52:53.280 --> 52:55.920]  So they live in these armored, pampered palaces.
[52:55.920 --> 52:58.280]  They've been pampered all their lives.
[52:58.280 --> 52:59.280]  They've been pampered.
[52:59.280 --> 53:02.360]  Look, we all went to all of those of us that went to college.
[53:02.360 --> 53:04.480]  We know who these guys are.
[53:04.480 --> 53:09.360]  George Bush was the kind of guy that ran around with the cooler guys.
[53:09.360 --> 53:14.520]  And then when trouble broke out and they got caught, George Bush would rat him out.
[53:14.520 --> 53:16.000]  And then he'd say, no, he didn't.
[53:16.000 --> 53:17.680]  That's who George Bush was.
[53:17.680 --> 53:19.680]  And Al Gore was that kind of guy.
[53:19.680 --> 53:21.880]  Well, it's worse than that.
[53:21.880 --> 53:25.160]  Remember back in 1991?
[53:25.160 --> 53:29.560]  George Bush Sr. was on national TV at a grocery store, and he stepped back and he said, what
[53:29.560 --> 53:30.560]  is that?
[53:30.560 --> 53:31.560]  And they said, well, it's a scanner.
[53:31.560 --> 53:32.760]  You know, it had been in for a decade.
[53:32.760 --> 53:34.520]  He goes, what is that?
[53:34.520 --> 53:35.920]  What is that laser?
[53:35.920 --> 53:38.000]  And they said, sir, this is how they scan the food.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.480]  I mean, the guy never went and bought his own food.
[53:40.480 --> 53:42.280]  He hadn't been in a grocery store.
[53:42.280 --> 53:43.280]  Exactly.
[53:43.280 --> 53:47.920]  And all these guys, you know, we know who they are, and they're the only reason they're
[53:47.920 --> 53:48.920]  there.
[53:48.920 --> 53:50.680]  Eddie Haskell's with an army.
[53:50.680 --> 54:02.560]  And Al Gore was that, you know, the kid that used to brown nose the teacher all the time,
[54:02.560 --> 54:03.560]  you know.
[54:03.560 --> 54:04.560]  I mean, this is who these people are.
[54:04.560 --> 54:05.560]  He's a sack of crap.
[54:05.560 --> 54:06.560]  He's a fake.
[54:06.560 --> 54:07.560]  Yeah.
[54:07.560 --> 54:08.560]  And then that's who it was.
[54:08.560 --> 54:10.560]  So we all know who these people are in life.
[54:10.560 --> 54:14.600]  So it's like, it's still high school, but now it's serious.
[54:14.600 --> 54:20.000]  So in going back to this greatest depression, so we already have the consumer in debt,
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.680]  14 trillion, the government in debt, and why it's going to be worse than the greatest
[54:23.680 --> 54:24.680]  depression.
[54:24.680 --> 54:26.880]  Now let's head on to some other things.
[54:26.880 --> 54:36.840]  People are watching their whole lives unfolding in front of them as their IRAs and 401Ks dissolve.
[54:36.840 --> 54:40.400]  They didn't have that back then, and now they have another thing.
[54:40.400 --> 54:45.280]  Back then, we were a very different country.
[54:45.280 --> 54:49.280]  When we did get out of the depression, it was the beginning of World War II, and we
[54:49.280 --> 54:52.560]  were the world manufacturers, bar none.
[54:52.560 --> 54:54.960]  We don't have that anymore.
[54:54.960 --> 54:59.480]  So now we're going into this mess, in a worse mess than we've ever been.
[54:59.480 --> 55:01.360]  And here's another big one.
[55:01.360 --> 55:04.480]  Back then, we were an ascending society.
[55:04.480 --> 55:07.580]  We were not a declining society.
[55:07.580 --> 55:14.360]  We had a growing class of people that came in, you know, people had dignity back then.
[55:14.360 --> 55:15.800]  They weren't like they are today.
[55:15.800 --> 55:21.720]  And we weren't a not just economically declining, we were not a physically age wise.
[55:21.720 --> 55:23.760]  We're one of the oldest civilizations on earth.
[55:23.760 --> 55:26.000]  It's a very bad shape.
[55:26.000 --> 55:27.000]  Yes.
[55:27.000 --> 55:30.840]  So we have an aging population, a bunch of cops in black ski masks strutting around
[55:30.840 --> 55:32.840]  working for Eddie Haskell.
[55:32.840 --> 55:34.840]  You can't put perfume on a pig, folks.
[55:34.840 --> 55:37.960]  This whole thing is a rotten, worm-eaten husk.
[55:37.960 --> 55:38.960]  Trendsresearch.com.
[55:38.960 --> 55:44.520]  You can go there and subscribe to his Trends Report.
[55:44.520 --> 55:48.880]  And if you're in business, if you care about your family, if you really want to be informed
[55:48.880 --> 55:54.240]  with somebody who's got a track record of being frighteningly accurate, this is the
[55:54.240 --> 55:55.240]  place to go.
[55:55.240 --> 55:56.240]  Trendsresearch.com.
[55:56.240 --> 56:01.120]  Of course, you can also check out InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, where we fight against
[56:01.120 --> 56:05.680]  the construction of this prison planet, and that's what the globalists are setting up,
[56:05.680 --> 56:09.320]  and we fight them via the InfoWars, hence InfoWars.com.
[56:09.320 --> 56:13.680]  So Gerald, I was throwing in my two cents throughout that, recap the first three or
[56:13.680 --> 56:18.240]  four phases, and then get into the latter phase, and they think they're going to use
[56:18.240 --> 56:22.160]  all these militarized police steroid head cops.
[56:22.160 --> 56:23.360]  A lot of the cops are good.
[56:23.360 --> 56:25.360]  They're openly saying they're not going to go along with this.
[56:25.360 --> 56:28.960]  The military is saying they don't want to shoot at Americans, but they're now acclimating
[56:28.960 --> 56:34.080]  the public and telling us to get ready for it, which means they intend to use them.
[56:34.080 --> 56:39.000]  Well, yeah, you know, we put nothing past them, of course, and then we're fighting
[56:39.000 --> 56:48.320]  a war now in Iraq for reasons that have been proven false, whether or not they were known
[56:48.320 --> 56:50.440]  they were false as academic.
[56:50.440 --> 56:52.920]  At this point, the fact is they're false.
[56:52.920 --> 56:57.800]  So killing innocent people for false reasons, I mean, where does it stop?
[56:57.800 --> 57:01.920]  So you know, there's nothing I would put past them, you know, read my lips, know new taxes.
[57:01.920 --> 57:04.480]  I didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[57:04.480 --> 57:06.600]  I smoked, but I didn't inhale.
[57:06.600 --> 57:11.840]  You know, I mean, it was Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda.
[57:11.840 --> 57:15.600]  It's beyond me why anyone would believe anything that they say.
[57:15.600 --> 57:22.720]  So of course, you know, we expect the government to respond in the worst possible way.
[57:22.720 --> 57:28.920]  And so the three phases are before revolution is that first we're going to see the collapse
[57:28.920 --> 57:34.200]  of 09, and that's going to be when the retail sector and the commercial real estate sector,
[57:34.200 --> 57:37.280]  oh, and of course, the credit card sector collapses too.
[57:37.280 --> 57:45.840]  You know, we're researchers, and we're finding people, for example, cab rides now.
[57:45.840 --> 57:52.520]  Cab drivers are telling us that more and more people are putting cab rides on their credit
[57:52.520 --> 57:55.120]  cards because they don't have the cash.
[57:55.120 --> 57:59.720]  So the next shoot of fall after that is going to be the credit card crunch when people have
[57:59.720 --> 58:05.800]  been postponing their future by putting their charges on their credit cards.
[58:05.800 --> 58:10.640]  So after the collapse, then we have the greatest depression.
[58:10.640 --> 58:12.320]  People are going to be in the streets.
[58:12.320 --> 58:40.560]  As we say, when people lose everything and they have nothing to lose, they lose it.

[58:55.760 --> 58:58.320]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[58:58.320 --> 59:01.600]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[59:01.600 --> 59:07.520]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its
[59:07.520 --> 59:09.480]  purchasing power.

[59:22.200 --> 59:24.760]  What will you do when the economy collapses?
[59:24.760 --> 59:27.600]  Store shelves are empty and your stored food is gone.
[59:27.600 --> 59:29.520]  How will you feed your family?
[59:29.520 --> 59:34.520]  True self-sufficiency and peace of mind is being able to grow a wide range of crops, ensuring
[59:34.520 --> 59:36.880]  a well-balanced diet for your family.

[1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:25.120]  Those stores.
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:28.720]  You're listening to GCN.
[1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:35.120]  Austin, Texas, check your watch, 5 o'clock.
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:36.840]  I am in USA Radio News.
[1:00:36.840 --> 1:00:38.280]  I'm Jody Jordan.
[1:00:38.280 --> 1:00:42.600]  Winter is officially only hours old, but much of the country is dealing with a third major
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:44.680]  winter storm in two days.
[1:00:44.680 --> 1:00:49.800]  When blown snow, sleet, and freezing rain are causing problems in Oregon and Washington.
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:53.040]  Mike Bodisak is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
[1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:56.840]  Northern New England, Central New England, including the Green and White Mountains ski
[1:00:56.840 --> 1:00:59.720]  areas of New Hampshire.
[1:00:59.720 --> 1:01:02.080]  And for Mike, I can expect up to a foot of snow.
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:06.640]  And federal safety inspectors are at Denver's airport, trying to figure out why a continental
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:11.480]  airline's Boeing 737 called fire as it was taking off last night.
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:13.160]  Alex Samra was a passenger.
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:18.400]  We went off into what felt like a little bit of a rough patch, took a little bump up, took
[1:01:18.400 --> 1:01:25.280]  life for a few moments, hit the ground again, bumped again, and then the engine on what
[1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:28.440]  was the right side of the plane seems to just blow up.
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:31.280]  This is IRN, USA Radio News.
[1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:33.920]  Hi, how in the world are you anyway?
[1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:37.880]  This is Andy Willoughby with the Three Step Plan Home-Based Business System.
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:42.360]  After just two short years, thousands of Americans are successfully working from home with the
[1:01:42.360 --> 1:01:43.360]  Three Step Plan.
[1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:44.360]  Hi, my name is Jeannie.
[1:01:44.360 --> 1:01:48.640]  Because of the Three Step Plan, I'm able to work from home and be a full-time mom.
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:49.840]  And that means everything to me.
[1:01:49.840 --> 1:01:50.840]  Hello, my name is Bill.
[1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.840]  I've been working the Three Step Plan for 18 months.
[1:01:52.840 --> 1:01:57.200]  And in that amount of time, I've been able to quit my job, pay off all of my bills, and
[1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:58.720]  even began to save money.
[1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:06.400]  For information, go to threestepplan.com or call toll-free 800-637-6122.
[1:02:06.400 --> 1:02:09.800]  My name is Emma, and I'm a senior citizen, and I've worked with the Three Step Plan for
[1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:10.800]  several years.
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:12.120]  Today, my house and cars are paid for.
[1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:14.160]  I have the time and the money to travel.
[1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:17.000]  The Three Step Plan has given me hope and financial freedom.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.280]  You'll need a telephone, internet access, and a positive attitude.

[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:37.720]  Vice President elect Joe Biden says the economy will be the new administration's top priority,
[1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:40.520]  and it will take some major spending to fix it.
[1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:45.680]  Biden tells ABC this week that the price tag will be a number no one would have thought
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:47.440]  about a year ago.
[1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:51.640]  Vice President Dick Cheney says President Bush has done his best to manage the crisis
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:56.600]  in the U.S. auto industry, but ultimately it will be up to the new Obama administration
[1:02:56.600 --> 1:02:58.040]  to resolve.
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:04.600]  On Fox News Sunday, Cheney calls the $17.4 billion in loans a short-term plan that only
[1:03:04.600 --> 1:03:06.320]  goes so far.
[1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:11.920]  And a study finds that banks getting taxpayer bailouts awarded their top executives nearly
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:17.080]  $1.6 billion in salaries, bonuses, and other benefits last year.
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:22.060]  The total given to nearly 600 executives would be enough to pay for the bailout costs for
[1:03:22.060 --> 1:03:26.000]  many of the banks that have accepted tax dollars.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:30.000]  For more news and analysis, log on to IRNNews.com.
[1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:38.360]  The holidays are a time to celebrate with family and friends, but don't forget, it's
[1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:42.360]  also a time when cops will be cracking down on drunk drivers.
[1:03:42.360 --> 1:03:46.920]  It doesn't matter who you are or where you drive, if you drive drunk, you will get
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:51.280]  caught and you will get arrested, so go to parties and have fun this holiday.
[1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:53.680]  But don't forget that cops will be out in force.
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:58.400]  If you get drunk, do not get behind the wheel, over the limit, under arrest, paid for by
[1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:02.280]  the U.S. Department of Transportation.
[1:04:02.280 --> 1:04:07.520]  The Taliban in Pakistan has killed two Afghan nationals for allegedly acting as spies for
[1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:08.680]  the U.S.
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:13.000]  The series of attacks occurred in Pakistan's volatile tribal areas.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  Here's Paul Alexander.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:21.160]  Both the Taliban and al-Qaeda forces tried to discourage people from cooperating with
[1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:23.880]  the Pakistani government and with the U.S.
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:24.880]  NATO forces.
[1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:29.360]  Israeli rescue services say Gaza militants have launched barrages of rockets and mortar
[1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:31.240]  shells in southern Israel.
[1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:36.240]  A truce between Israel and the Islamic Hamas and Gaza has ended, and violence is increasing
[1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.240]  again.
[1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:38.240]  Here's Mark Levy.
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:41.800]  There are some signs that both sides would like to renew the truce, but that's not easy.
[1:04:41.800 --> 1:04:44.520]  Israel and the Hamas rulers of Gaza are bitter enemies.
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:45.840]  They don't talk to each other.
[1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:50.760]  Hamas doesn't accept the presence of Israel, and Israel calls Hamas a terrorist organization.
[1:04:50.760 --> 1:04:54.200]  And today is the winter solstice, the first day of winter.
[1:04:54.200 --> 1:04:55.800]  And here's Sophia Manos.
[1:04:55.800 --> 1:04:58.120]  Some say to ring bells on the solstice.
[1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:01.080]  The shortest day, the longest night of the year.
[1:05:01.080 --> 1:05:06.800]  Across parts of the nation, though, Americans are more concerned about more soup, you know,
[1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:09.600]  snow cutters, ice cutters, chili, you dare go.
[1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:10.600]  Yeah.
[1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:11.600]  I think I'm going over her house.
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:17.840]  Because these ladies from Sioux City, Iowa, told KTI TV, this Iowa, however, is not exactly
[1:05:17.840 --> 1:05:18.840]  pleased.
[1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:19.840]  It's just too cold to go out.
[1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:21.640]  But look on the bright side.
[1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:25.440]  From here on in, the nights grow shorter, the days longer.
[1:05:25.440 --> 1:05:26.840]  I'm Sophia Manos.
[1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:30.640]  And I'm Jody Jordan for IRNUSA Radio News.
[1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:49.960]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries throughout the entire world.
[1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:54.320]  And because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better
[1:05:54.320 --> 1:05:59.080]  utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can
[1:05:59.080 --> 1:06:01.440]  to modern-day antibiotics.
[1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:05.320]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold
[1:06:05.320 --> 1:06:09.280]  and copper, with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[1:06:09.280 --> 1:06:13.560]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that
[1:06:13.560 --> 1:06:17.400]  would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:13.440]  So he went through the first three phases towards revolution and worldwide rioting and
[1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:16.000]  revolution that will be sustained.
[1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:20.880]  The military is now saying that they are prepared to engage the American people.
[1:07:20.880 --> 1:07:25.240]  The Army War College is saying this, now there is no longer any doubt about that.
[1:07:25.240 --> 1:07:28.200]  Gerald Salente, how do you see the revolution kicking off?
[1:07:28.200 --> 1:07:31.720]  How do you see it starting?
[1:07:31.720 --> 1:07:32.880]  When do you see it starting?
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:33.880]  How do you see it starting?
[1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:39.720]  Yeah, I will read from you from our Trends Journal that just went out when we say come
[1:07:39.720 --> 1:07:40.720]  the revolution.
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:46.400]  We do not forecast a 1776 style revolution to spontaneously erupt.
[1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:53.160]  It will happen in stages, it will spread among the classes, and be waged in many forms over
[1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:59.600]  the Internet, in town halls, on the ballots, as well as at the barricades.
[1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:06.720]  What will be the spark that ignites it, the final straw bailout, another tax height, disparaging
[1:08:06.720 --> 1:08:14.760]  entitlements, or will it be the ultimate quote, let them eat, take policy that pushes people
[1:08:14.760 --> 1:08:16.680]  past the breaking point?
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:24.600]  Now, who will break first to form a middle class that lost their jobs, 401Ks, pensions,
[1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:30.520]  and even their homes, jobless blue collar, and paycheck to paycheck workers, their credit
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:37.520]  maxed out, and heading toward homeless, the young and restless with dead-end jobs or
[1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:45.160]  no jobs who believe their future had been stolen and want revenge, the artist and intellectuals
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:51.880]  on one hand, the hardcore conservatives and passion patriots on the other, united in outrage
[1:08:51.880 --> 1:09:00.000]  at Big Brother's control of the entire socioeconomic and political system, one of the above, some
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:07.520]  of the above, all of the above, who will fire the shot heard around the world?
[1:09:07.520 --> 1:09:10.000]  So that's how we pose it.
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:15.680]  And I tell the story in here of my meeting with John Connolly, of course, you know,
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:22.240]  this is the governor of Texas sitting in front of JFK and took the bullet in the back.
[1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:28.040]  And it was in 1992, and Connolly had asked to meet me, because in one of my early books,
[1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:34.560]  the trend tracking in 1989, I had forecast a new third party and mentioned someone like
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:36.320]  Ross Perot.
[1:09:36.320 --> 1:09:43.240]  So the Connolly, John Connolly's wife, Nellie, threw this fellow who put the meeting together,
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:49.880]  John Jay Hooker from Tennessee, we went to the book depository and the Texas school book
[1:09:49.880 --> 1:09:54.320]  depository, and I have a photo, it's in the trans journal of me, Connolly and his wife,
[1:09:54.320 --> 1:09:57.880]  Nellie, standing in front of the book depository.
[1:09:57.880 --> 1:10:01.880]  And John Connolly was a dying man, and I could see it.
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:07.160]  And by the way, this was their first time back, 1992, since the assassination.
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:12.040]  And he's telling us the story of what happened that day, we were parked out in front of limousine,
[1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:16.520]  so that's the side, by the way, the shot that everyone sees of the book depository.
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:18.760]  That's the side of the building.
[1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:27.000]  And I knew he was a dying man because he had these terrible purplish splotches on his hands.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:36.080]  He was on massive doses of prednisone, cortisone, lung inflection.
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:39.280]  And it occurred to me that he was a dying man.
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:44.680]  He ended up dying actually in June, and this was in late October when we met.
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:52.640]  And as we're going back into the Anatole Hotel, he said to me, I read your book, Tread Tracking,
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:54.600]  and I know your heart is in the right place.
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:11:00.120]  He said, but you don't have a clue what's going on, and neither do the American people,
[1:11:00.120 --> 1:11:04.280]  because if they did, there'd be a revolution in this country.
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:07.160]  This was in 1992.
[1:11:07.160 --> 1:11:14.000]  And you know, I knew what he meant because I had been around long enough to, I began
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  my career.
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:21.240]  I ran as the number two guy running the mayoral campaign in Yonkers, New York in 1971, and
[1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:25.760]  then they sent me up to Albany, and I was an assistant to the secretary of the New York
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:27.120]  State Senate.
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:35.200]  And I spent from 73 to 79 in between D.C. and Chicago as a government affairs specialist.
[1:11:35.200 --> 1:11:40.240]  And I had been, you know, for a trade association, chemicals being one of the fields.
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:45.240]  So I had been around long enough, spent time with Ronald Reagan, and I knew what the story
[1:11:45.240 --> 1:11:46.240]  looked like.
[1:11:46.240 --> 1:11:50.520]  So when Connolly said that to me, it didn't come as a shock.
[1:11:50.520 --> 1:11:55.320]  And I wondered, you know, when would it happen, and now the when is now.
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:56.320]  Absolutely.
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:02.080]  And Neft and Gatt, everything designed to destroy the middle class, to put all power.
[1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:06.280]  Not a free market economy, not a vibrant economy, because that's not good for monopolies.
[1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:11.000]  At the expense of the economy, at the expense of the public worldwide, these internationalists
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.200]  have done everything they can to destroy the real economy and transfer everything into
[1:12:15.200 --> 1:12:19.280]  the fiat Las Vegas economy.
[1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:26.360]  Now expanding on that, when we first came into the segment, I made the point that they
[1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:30.960]  stated, the financial elite stated that they were going to engineer a worldwide collapse
[1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:32.600]  to consolidate things.
[1:12:32.600 --> 1:12:37.880]  They would then pose as the saviors and bring in open world government as the solution.
[1:12:37.880 --> 1:12:44.600]  But now it appears that they are mismanaging things and that this is spiraling out of control.
[1:12:44.600 --> 1:12:49.920]  Can you speak directly to that, A, and then B, we've seen a flotilla of hundreds and
[1:12:49.920 --> 1:12:51.040]  hundreds.
[1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:56.800]  The media is festooned with the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times of London, the
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.440]  French news agency, Canadian papers saying, yes, we're in a world government, yes, it's
[1:13:01.440 --> 1:13:06.200]  tyrannical for your own good, yes, we're going to use troops on you, yes, we want to take
[1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:09.240]  your guns, but it's for your own good.
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:15.000]  So A, is it out of their control now, and B, why are they trumpeting world government
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  now?
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.520]  It's totally out of their control.
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:24.080]  As I said, if there's an Illuminati, the Illuminati are the people that are in control right
[1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:25.080]  now.
[1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:30.480]  Look at the players, for example, we'll look in the United States, I mean, who are the
[1:13:30.480 --> 1:13:31.480]  congressional leaders?
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:37.960]  Well, on the Democrats, you have what, you have Pelosi, Reed, you have Barney, Frank,
[1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:45.680]  Christopher Dodd, Biden, and on the Republicans, we have Bond, Bonner, who else, who's a big
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:48.080]  name Republican at this time.
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:52.040]  I mean, how about Lola and Hardy and Abbott and Costello, when they did it?
[1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:53.160]  I mean, look at these people.
[1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:56.920]  Does anybody out there think that these politicians are smarter than them?
[1:13:56.920 --> 1:13:57.920]  Look at Bernanke.
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:00.840]  I mean, it looks like a said beagle, this guy.
[1:14:00.840 --> 1:14:02.520]  What brains are out there?
[1:14:02.520 --> 1:14:03.520]  Look at Paulson.
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:09.800]  Think of the things that he said last year, May 7th, he said that the worst of the economic
[1:14:09.800 --> 1:14:11.880]  crisis was behind us.
[1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:13.800]  I mean, one after another.
[1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:18.440]  So who are the people in charge, look at it, go over to France, what do you have, Sarkozy,
[1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:22.240]  you know, the little American, you have Berlusconi over in Italy.
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:27.080]  He's like a Rocky Six movie, you know, he's been back so many times.
[1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:34.200]  You have Grandma Merkel over in Germany, Gordon Brown over in England, Gordon Brown, another
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:36.200]  shade of beige.
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:39.000]  You go around the world, look at the leaders.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:40.280]  Who are these people?
[1:14:40.280 --> 1:14:43.720]  No, it's going to be a let them eat cake time.
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:45.720]  It's out of control.
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:47.200]  There's nothing that they can do.
[1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:52.800]  And as I said, and I'll say it again, when people lose everything and they have nothing
[1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:55.200]  to lose, they lose it.
[1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:01.600]  Who's going to, how are people going to afford to pay their mortgages, to pay their insurance?
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:03.000]  They're not going to.
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:07.240]  And this is beyond, this is beyond the pale of any belief.
[1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:12.280]  They're raising taxes across the board, property taxes, school taxes.
[1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:14.880]  Now I'm not a stupid person.
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:20.720]  So when they come to me and say, Mr. Salenti, we're raising the taxes on your building or
[1:15:20.720 --> 1:15:27.680]  your property, whatever, because the valuations have gone up, well, how about lowering them
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:30.480]  because the valuations have gone down?
[1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:32.600]  Well, in cases where they're going to raise them.
[1:15:32.600 --> 1:15:36.560]  Well, in cases where they're are lowering them, they're just doing one time assessments
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:41.320]  in Texas, Wyoming, and all over the place, cities just say, well, we got to build some
[1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:42.720]  new roads and curves.
[1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:47.280]  So every house gets a $15,000 to $20,000 one time assessment, and the people are like,
[1:15:47.280 --> 1:15:48.280]  I don't have a job.
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:50.200]  I'm already about to lose my house.
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:52.400]  Where do you think the money is going to come from?
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:55.680]  And the locals say, look, give us the money or a SWAT team's coming.
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:01.280]  Well, and again, this is where we're going to have the breakdown because people, when
[1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:05.400]  you don't have it, you can't squeeze more out of it.
[1:16:05.400 --> 1:16:08.200]  People are going to become very ugly and very violent.
[1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:15.640]  The ads that you are running on your show for lasers and other kinds of things are going
[1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:21.520]  to be, survival is going to be a big business.
[1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:33.880]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:38.320]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:40.040]  for your IRA?
[1:16:40.040 --> 1:16:41.040]  That's right.
[1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:46.400]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial industry
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:51.040]  refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:16:51.040 --> 1:16:56.160]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperform paper investments like stocks, bonds, and
[1:16:56.160 --> 1:16:59.400]  CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:03.280]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:04.640]  you in paper.

[1:17:34.880 --> 1:17:35.880]  No!

[1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:36.360]  Are you tired of searching for Crick Talk Radio?
[1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:37.600]  Well search no more.
[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:44.320]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:49.120]  Harold Solenche, I want to run through a whole line of questioning with quick answers from
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:52.720]  you if I can because there's so much I want to pick your brain on.
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:56.800]  Going back to my second question, why are they trumpeting that yes we're setting up
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:01.160]  world government, yes we've been setting it up in secret, yes it's anti-democratic
[1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:02.600]  but it's for your own good?
[1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:09.960]  Well because it's a takeover, as I said Washington's been taken over by Wall Street and they're
[1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:14.120]  going to keep saying it's for our own good but it's not going to do any good.
[1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:17.360]  And the people that are in control, it's out of their hands.
[1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:22.240]  Why are they killing the Golden Goose, I mean they have this system, they have this system.
[1:21:22.240 --> 1:21:27.600]  Why do people get into politics, Eisenhower had a great quote, he said anybody that would
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:35.280]  want to run for president had to be crazy or psychologically deranged.
[1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:37.720]  Their control freaks, that's the big issue.
[1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:44.000]  You're crazy, so he said if you're called on to serve that's different but these people
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:47.560]  spend their whole lives trying to tell other people how to live.
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:53.240]  So you know the system is breaking down the big story behind everything that's going
[1:21:53.240 --> 1:22:00.800]  on here and this is what we wrote back in 2002, the summer edition of the Trends Journal.
[1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:08.880]  Another America fading fast, this isn't an economic crisis, the empire is in decline.
[1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:15.520]  We can see in the future these secessionist movements that are taking root, gaining more
[1:22:15.520 --> 1:22:16.520]  and more strength.
[1:22:16.520 --> 1:22:23.600]  As a matter of fact I spoke at one in Vermont this past November and it's one of the more
[1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:25.520]  active ones in the country.
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:30.720]  Well Gerald, Gerald we have this huge trillion plus dollar a year military industrial complex,
[1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:35.760]  it's imploding worldwide and it appears that this whole apparatus, this predatory system
[1:22:35.760 --> 1:22:40.800]  is going to implode back to the U.S. only and then they're then going to preditate and
[1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:44.680]  feed on us here domestically, I mean is that the plan?
[1:22:44.680 --> 1:22:49.680]  I don't know what the plan is but I do know that they will do anything to keep the people
[1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:55.320]  in line and that our, you know the freedoms, I mean look what happens every time there's
[1:22:55.320 --> 1:23:00.400]  a political convention, you know they bring in the stormtroopers.
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:05.160]  You can't step out of line, look what happened here in New York from the Republican and Democratic
[1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:07.600]  convention, I think it was the Republican convention.
[1:23:07.600 --> 1:23:08.600]  2004 I was there.
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:13.560]  Yeah, I mean look at the videotape of the police assaulting innocent people and rounding
[1:23:13.560 --> 1:23:18.680]  them up and pushing false charges on them and throwing them in jail.
[1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:21.840]  This is America, this isn't the America that I grew up to love.
[1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:25.800]  And by the way they lost over a thousand lawsuits over that but they don't care, they
[1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:27.840]  just pay them off with tax money.
[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:31.600]  Carol Salente is our guest, when we get back I want to quickly get into their attack on
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:35.400]  the Internet, they're moving to shut down the old web, force us onto a highly regulated
[1:23:35.400 --> 1:23:40.280]  Internet too, that's part of Obama's big upgrade made off, I mean this is the former
[1:23:40.280 --> 1:23:45.840]  head of the NASDAQ showing a window into the criminal class that's literally ruling us,
[1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:47.640]  the Eddie Haskells with an army.
[1:23:47.640 --> 1:23:52.680]  I want to get into the fact that the elites are all leaving the United States and leaving
[1:23:52.680 --> 1:23:54.960]  Israel and leaving other key areas.
[1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:58.440]  Why are the billionaires fleeing Israel and the United States?
[1:23:58.440 --> 1:23:59.440]  Where do you see this going?
[1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:03.160]  What do you see militarily happening as the empire collapses?
[1:24:03.160 --> 1:24:10.560]  And then solutions to all of this and again, how do you see us coming out of all of this?
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:15.160]  Gerald Salente is our guest, trendsresearch.com, go there and sign up for his report.
[1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:20.240]  All right, Gerald Salente, I want to go to calls in the next segment so let me go to
[1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:22.360]  these calls quickly.
[1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:27.240]  If anybody was doubting how criminal Wall Street is made off, they're now saying it
[1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:34.120]  could be over 100 billion, not 50 billion, stolen from charities, pension funds, government
[1:24:34.120 --> 1:24:40.720]  pension funds, Jewish groups, ripping off his own sons, I mean this is the type of kleptocracy
[1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:46.000]  that we have and it turns out the brokerage firms and banks were knowingly involved in
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:50.440]  all of this winning, that's what this derivative system is, is a Ponzi scheme.
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:57.320]  Oh yeah, I don't think they should call it a Ponzi scheme anymore, Ponzi was small change
[1:24:57.320 --> 1:25:07.400]  compared to these criminals, let's call it a Matlock, this thing is endemic, it's throughout
[1:25:07.400 --> 1:25:15.440]  all of, this is what Wall Street has become, what's bad for Wall Street, Alex, is great
[1:25:15.440 --> 1:25:17.200]  for Main Street.
[1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:22.400]  And I'll tell you why, it's Wall Street that killed Main Street, it's Wall Street with
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:30.160]  all this snagling that allows these huge developers to borrow all of this money on leverage,
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:38.560]  build these huge malls and then the criminals in hand, the politicians who get all these
[1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:45.320]  payoffs, they call them campaign contributions, then they give these huge developers all of
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:53.880]  these breaks, these loan guarantees, they give them access road building and tax breaks
[1:25:53.880 --> 1:26:00.920]  and what they've done is they've put Main Street out of business, this belief that we
[1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:07.360]  need a Wall Street so that we can keep creating the ugliness that they've created, I mean
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:14.800]  my God, does anyone like driving down a street and seeing nothing but strip malls and malls
[1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:21.760]  compared to the old beautiful cities and by the way, we're now in Kingston, New York,
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:27.960]  we're right off the most historic corner in the United States, we're right on it, the
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:33.120]  only corner in the U.S. where there's a stone building on each corner dating back to the
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:40.640]  1600s, we're here because it's a walking community, we have all these beautiful old buildings
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:51.320]  and we support all the local people around, as this dies, as these giants fall, we're
[1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:58.960]  going to start seeing a return to local because what we also do with the Trends Research Institute
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:04.520]  when we write the Trends Journal is we give people trend posts to follow, to profit and
[1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:11.120]  to avoid dangers, as this thing unfolds more and more, the real estate buys, and there
[1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:17.160]  will be but not yet, are going to be in these kind of communities where people could live
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:20.760]  and where they work, where they shop, where they have a community.
[1:27:20.760 --> 1:27:26.000]  The only thing that's going to save people during this greatest depression is to build
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:33.200]  the strongest communities that they can, not a federal or a state but a local.
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:35.240]  That's where the survival is going to go.
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:41.200]  Instead of vertical integration, going back to local control and true diversity and sovereignty,
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:45.560]  shifting gears back to something you said a few minutes ago, they've weaponized the
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:46.720]  market.
[1:27:46.720 --> 1:27:51.080]  These private brokerage firms and central banks can issue endless liquidity to themselves,
[1:27:51.080 --> 1:27:55.320]  they create the monsters like Walmart and others, they consolidate the economy like a
[1:27:55.320 --> 1:27:59.920]  giant risk game until the final phase when there's nothing left and they're sitting
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:03.560]  there with all the currency, all the power, all the money, but they've destroyed their
[1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:07.520]  own markets and that's why Wall Street was aware of the criminal activity with their
[1:28:07.520 --> 1:28:11.680]  Ponzi schemes and that's why they moved in with the police state, but again, what is
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.160]  going to support the police state when there's no taxing base?
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:16.160]  Exactly.
[1:28:16.160 --> 1:28:21.320]  As we said, there's going to be high levels of anarchy and revolution.
[1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:29.880]  The other reason why we're located here, it's a very rich area in terms of agriculture
[1:28:29.880 --> 1:28:37.080]  and academics, manufacturing, great transportation, the Hudson River, beauty, the Hudson River
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:42.440]  Valley, so it's going to be these kind of places and these kind of things.
[1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:48.840]  Something old is dying, but something new will be born and you know, I'm a world traveler
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:54.040]  and the one thing I can say and I mean this with all my heart is every way you go, people
[1:28:54.040 --> 1:28:59.280]  are always envious of the United States because they still think that we have the freedoms
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:05.000]  of course that we don't have, but what we do have that no one else does have is really
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:11.440]  an innovative spirit and an ability to think that isn't restricted by cultural norms.
[1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:15.000]  So there are great opportunities and I'm going to have you back on again in the near future
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  next year if you'll do it to do a whole show on opportunities in this crisis and not just
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.200]  to protect yourself but to thrive.
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:29.840]  When we come back, let's talk about how you see the revolution unfolding itself and then
[1:29:29.840 --> 1:29:30.840]  how you see it.
[1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:36.520]  The holidays are right around the corner, the crowds, the countless hours in traffic,
[1:29:36.520 --> 1:29:41.040]  finding a parking spot just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.

[1:30:30.640 --> 1:30:36.360]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[1:30:36.360 --> 1:30:39.920]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?

[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:52.520]  In fact, clinically detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[1:30:52.520 --> 1:30:55.360]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.

[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:34.840]  bad to me?
[1:31:34.840 --> 1:31:38.160]  Do you believe that when your cupboards are bare, our corporate controlled government will
[1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:40.080]  jump right into feet you and yours?

[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:29.920]  to repeat it.
[1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:34.960]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[1:32:34.960 --> 1:32:38.680]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:43.680]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:47.280]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[1:33:40.600 --> 1:33:47.640]  All we've got is the cards that life deals us, but there's the question of how we play
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:53.920]  those cards.
[1:33:53.920 --> 1:33:58.320]  The good news is we've been here for decades warning people about what was going to happen
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:04.080]  and explaining just how it would unfold and exactly what we said is now happening so people
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:09.600]  are paying attention.
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:15.080]  You know it's not tooting our horn, it's just a fact to give the listeners an idea of how
[1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:17.880]  many people were reaching.
[1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:22.840]  I have in the last few days been contacted by some of the biggest names in Hollywood
[1:34:22.840 --> 1:34:29.000]  that I didn't know, some of the biggest names in television that I didn't know.
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:32.520]  I've talked to other people I've known for a long time in Hollywood and they say that
[1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:39.000]  if we thought the Patriot Liberty 9-11 Truth Movement, Anti-New World Movement was big before
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:45.120]  the producers and directors and writers and actors and actresses, it is many times bigger
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:46.120]  now.
[1:34:46.120 --> 1:34:49.920]  So fighting the New World Order being aware of this is the hottest thing and it's not
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:54.640]  some trend, it's not some new trendiness, the establishment is trying to suppress it.
[1:34:54.640 --> 1:35:00.120]  It is an underground movement that is bigger than the above ground false mainstream media
[1:35:00.120 --> 1:35:04.600]  projection telling us that the establishment loves us and the establishment isn't corrupt
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:07.600]  and the establishment is going to take good care of us.
[1:35:07.600 --> 1:35:12.960]  And so as their false reality begins to fall to the real reality, we have a great opportunity
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:14.960]  to actually turn this thing around.
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:18.280]  I have a few final questions for you Gerald Salienti and then I want to get to some phone
[1:35:18.280 --> 1:35:19.360]  calls.
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:23.320]  But to finishing up, how do you see this, I mean when does physical revolution, I know
[1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:27.400]  you can't mark a date or a month, but what a year out, two years out, a lot of experts
[1:35:27.400 --> 1:35:31.640]  we talked to say about two years out, some are now saying a year out, some say three
[1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:36.160]  years out, governments are saying two or three years out, Pentagon reports are saying two
[1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:38.200]  years out, a year out.
[1:35:38.200 --> 1:35:43.600]  When does the breakdown really occur and then how do you see it playing out?
[1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:51.120]  Well we have forecast 2012, that's the year that we're pinpointing the revolution.
[1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:56.240]  Just as for example, we're in a recession, we're actually we're in the early stages
[1:35:56.240 --> 1:35:57.920]  of depression now.
[1:35:57.920 --> 1:36:02.720]  But when you look at the real unemployment numbers as you well know, they're ranging
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:08.040]  between what, 12 to 14 percent, that's even according to the government statistics when
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:12.640]  they put in the people that are no longer actively seeking jobs.
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:17.680]  So just as they said for example, that we were in a recession a year ago, even though
[1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:22.520]  they weren't admitting it, will be in revolution for a while and they won't admit it.
[1:36:22.520 --> 1:36:27.240]  We believe the official date will come around 2012, if not sooner.
[1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:31.960]  We're going to start seeing the first signs of it, we believe this winter, there's going
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:36.840]  to be food riots, there's going to be housing riots, there's going to be riots at many different
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:40.520]  levels and the form they take is very difficult.
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:49.940]  For example, we had in December 14, 2000, USA Today ran our top trends and the first
[1:36:49.940 --> 1:36:56.120]  trend was they read 2001 won't be our year, trend seer says, and we warned that a wave
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:00.760]  of anti-Americanism would sweep the globe and that Americans wouldn't be safe at home
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:01.760]  or abroad.
[1:37:01.760 --> 1:37:08.120]  We didn't know, for example, that it would be 9-11, but we knew the flashpoint was there.
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:13.840]  The flashpoint we believe is going to start happening, become visible on the streets this
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:20.680]  winter, there's going to be uprisings, they're going to be violent and they will be suppressed
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:22.600]  or try to be suppressed.
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:28.040]  In my book Trends 2000, which I wrote in 1996, came out in January, finished it in 96, came
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:37.120]  out in January of 1997, we had this come the revolution, but in that we wrote, maybe naively,
[1:37:37.120 --> 1:37:43.280]  that we were in a third world country where the military and the police would fire on
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:49.560]  their own people and we're hoping that hope is probably the most bankrupt word in the
[1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:56.000]  metaphysical language or dictionary, but we would believe that we're greater than the
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.600]  troops firing on their own people.
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:38:01.040]  So we saw the revolution coming a long time ago.
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:03.720]  How do you see it playing out?
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:04.720]  It's difficult.
[1:38:04.720 --> 1:38:09.200]  Again, I would say the first thing that the reality kind of things are going to be people
[1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:15.680]  being cold, hungry and nowhere to sleep and we can see rioting, maybe street riots, food
[1:38:15.680 --> 1:38:19.520]  riots, crime, by the way, that's going to be the false flag.
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:24.480]  They're going to use crime as the example and anarchists in the crowd.
[1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:28.720]  And the public will beg for troops on the streets to save them.
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:29.720]  Exactly.
[1:38:29.720 --> 1:38:33.000]  So they could do a false flag kind of operation like that.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  And for example...
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  Oh, I mean, we caught them in Denver.
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:38.440]  The police was in the Denver Post attacking other police for the news cameras.
[1:38:38.440 --> 1:38:39.440]  Right.
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:41.040]  It would happen here in New York too.
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:46.960]  So it can be that kind of a false flag, but those are the most likely scenarios.
[1:38:46.960 --> 1:38:48.800]  Okay, well, I see it.
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:52.160]  And by the way, one of the groups that people are not going to expect that they're going
[1:38:52.160 --> 1:38:53.960]  to be very violent and very upset.
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:39:00.480]  Well, maybe they too are going to be all these college students that have $40,000, $50,000
[1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:05.960]  worth of debt on their shoulders to being hounded to pay it and then they can't even
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:08.320]  get a job at Starbucks.
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:15.240]  So that's going to be the revolutionary crowd because the young people, I mean, I'm speaking
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:20.200]  for myself, a person over 60, you don't have the energy that you had before.
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:25.720]  Well, Mr. Salente, in the time we've got, I see the flash point at factories, as we
[1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:32.520]  saw in the 20s and 30s and 40s, or the bonus marchers, I see vets revolting.
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:36.880]  I see college students, I see government workers when they find out that they've had their
[1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:37.880]  pension funds stolen.
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:43.640]  And that leads me to the big flash point, 401ks down over 50%, clearly going to continue.
[1:39:43.640 --> 1:39:47.160]  What are the firemen and teachers and police and government people going to do when they
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:50.960]  find out that they've had their pension funds stolen by the bankers?
[1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:57.080]  Well, again, this is why we're looking at it as we're saying that these are only symptoms
[1:39:57.080 --> 1:40:02.600]  of a much greater trend and it's the decline and fall of Empire America.
[1:40:02.600 --> 1:40:07.000]  And I think we're going to see many police and military actually join the people.
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:11.840]  We, well, you know, there's that one group and then there's the other group.
[1:40:11.840 --> 1:40:16.680]  You know, that you, when you look at undeveloped countries and we're an undeveloping nation
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:22.720]  at this point, you know, the police and the federal allies are the most corrupt among
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:23.720]  anyone.
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:26.040]  So, you know, we could have that core in there too.
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:27.040]  We don't know.
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:28.040]  Absolutely.
[1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:29.040]  Okay.
[1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:33.160]  A few final questions and I want to get to the phone calls.
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:34.680]  Staged terror.
[1:40:34.680 --> 1:40:36.680]  You just mentioned false flag.
[1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:41.280]  We see government's staged terror attacks when they're imploding economies to subconsciously
[1:40:41.280 --> 1:40:46.400]  at a primitive tribal level, get the people to rally around the government who opposes
[1:40:46.400 --> 1:40:48.240]  their saviors.
[1:40:48.240 --> 1:40:50.520]  So we see these government make work jobs.
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:55.640]  This isn't like Roosevelt with building dams or building highway rest stops.
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:41:02.400]  They're saying green core, million man, tattletale force, million man domestic spy force.
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:04.720]  I mean, this is openly being announced.
[1:41:04.720 --> 1:41:09.320]  So can you, can you speak to false flags and then of course the type of make work that
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:10.320]  Obama's promising?
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:15.680]  Well, well, the false flags, remember the main, I mean, the Lusitania, I mean, this
[1:41:15.680 --> 1:41:17.720]  is a report out now.
[1:41:17.720 --> 1:41:22.800]  Of course that the Lusitania indeed was filled with armaments that they were bringing over
[1:41:22.800 --> 1:41:27.760]  using people as human shields to bring those over.
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:32.960]  And of course the Lusitania was one of the sparks that brought it US into World War I,
[1:41:32.960 --> 1:41:40.320]  which was by the way the most avoidable major war in modern history, brought about by fools
[1:41:40.320 --> 1:41:44.520]  and failing monarchies.
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:49.960]  And so we have, of course, we have the Gulf of Tonkin incident that never happened the
[1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:51.560]  way they said it did.
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:53.160]  So there's one after another.
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:59.400]  We don't know what they will be, but we believe given the track record of what they've done
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:04.360]  in the past is no reason to rule out that they won't do it in the future.
[1:42:04.360 --> 1:42:09.560]  And again, we're fighting a war right now for reasons that are patently false.
[1:42:09.560 --> 1:42:13.360]  Gerald Salente, how do you see the attack on the web unfolding?
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:18.400]  You know, they've announced in documents put out by Internet too that private corporations
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:23.520]  and the government are going to take over the Internet, kill the old web basically,
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:27.920]  and then force you onto a new Internet where you have subdomains under their site.
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:31.760]  Now Obama has announced he's going with that in the name of innovation.
[1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:35.760]  He's created a new private council of the IT heads and owners of the companies to work
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:36.760]  together.
[1:42:36.760 --> 1:42:41.240]  And they have the Violent Radicalization Act in Congress where they say 9-11 Truth works
[1:42:41.240 --> 1:42:45.120]  with Al Qaeda and that they are going to ban these grips on the web, and we're now seeing
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:50.680]  massive censorship of our work all over the Internet, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com,
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:54.160]  banning libraries, government Wi-Fi systems.
[1:42:54.160 --> 1:42:55.640]  How do you see that unfolding?
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:43:02.680]  Net neutrality, it's going to be a very difficult one to control because there's a whole cadre
[1:43:02.680 --> 1:43:10.000]  of people out there that are Internet patriots that are going to do anything that they can
[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.440]  not to make this happen.
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:18.880]  And of course, it's the one card, the freedom of the Internet, it's the major card I would
[1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:24.640]  say that could help free us from a global dictatorship.
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:31.160]  It's going to be a fight to the finish for the government to regulate the web, we believe.
[1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:35.360]  Now that the election is over and the shock is beginning to wear off, ready reserve foods
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:39.720]  in an effort to get as many Americans prepared for the promised changes of the new administration

[1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:33.760]  How many times have you been in the dark looking for a flashlight?
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:37.520]  Only to find the one that you have is broken, the batteries are dead or it's just not bright

[1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:38.920]  Whether you know it or not, red light and speed cameras are everywhere ready to snap
[1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:41.040]  a photo of your license plate.

[1:46:30.960 --> 1:46:32.520]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[1:46:32.520 --> 1:46:37.160]  For the past several months, folks have constantly asked me to give them the date as to when
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:39.840]  they should be finished stocking up on food.
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:44.040]  We've been so beaten up by stock market banking, housing and unemployment crashes that were
[1:46:44.040 --> 1:46:48.600]  desensitized and frozen and active like the frog being unknowingly cooked in gradually
[1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:50.080]  increasingly hot water.
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:52.880]  We'll snap out of it, we now have a deadline.
[1:46:52.880 --> 1:46:55.080]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen.
[1:46:55.080 --> 1:46:59.720]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell went on CBS Meet the Press and pointed to about
[1:46:59.720 --> 1:47:04.480]  January 22nd as the time a major international incident would force the new president to
[1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:06.880]  make unpopular decisions.
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:11.120]  While I take the general at his word, my best advice is to have your food in your possession
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:13.320]  prior to the inauguration.
[1:47:13.320 --> 1:47:18.480]  Contact eFoodsDirect.com for your supplies prior to this deadline for disaster.
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:22.760]  Ask yourself, is it better to have too much too soon or too little too late?
[1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:27.200]  Call 800-409-5633 or on the web eFoodsDirect.com
[1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:49.160]  I'll tell you, time really flies when you're fighting the New World Order.
[1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:52.960]  Gerald Salente is our guest for another 10 minutes.
[1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:59.360]  Then we have a very special guest in studio coming up, Tex Mars.
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:07.760]  Gerald, I want to go back to as many of the calls as we can, but I had one other question
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:10.160]  for you dealing with all of this.
[1:48:10.160 --> 1:48:15.120]  Again, a lot of people are looking forward to having shooting wars with the police and
[1:48:15.120 --> 1:48:17.360]  military.
[1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:21.720]  I believe the globalists actually are looking forward to that because then that will destroy
[1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:26.200]  confidence further and then they can consolidate the economy even more.
[1:48:26.200 --> 1:48:29.800]  But when the police are out confiscating guns and arresting people and shooting the public
[1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:33.680]  and the military is doing that, what do they expect?
[1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:38.080]  I know I'm not relishing this, I know you're not relishing this, and I wonder what the
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:43.080]  rules of engagement for the American people should be through all of this.
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:49.920]  Well, I think you hit upon one before when we were talking about who will be the first
[1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:55.560]  likely groups who will fire the first shots, who will protest, and what we saw in Chicago
[1:48:55.560 --> 1:48:59.880]  with those workers refusing to leave.
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:03.760]  I think we're going to see more of that kind of thing where people are just going to say,
[1:49:03.760 --> 1:49:06.280]  no, I have nowhere else to go, I'm staying here.
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:10.240]  And hothead cops are going to come in and crack their skulls and it's going to start.
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:11.240]  Exactly.
[1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:17.000]  As I said, if it becomes something that's overtly brutal, look what happened with Katrina.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.360]  Look how it was covered up for so long.
[1:49:19.360 --> 1:49:26.200]  Don't forget how they kept saying that things were under control.
[1:49:26.200 --> 1:49:33.840]  And then when it came to seeing how inefficient and uncaring the government was, the outrage
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  set it.
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:37.240]  I think we're going to see the same kind of thing happen.
[1:49:37.240 --> 1:49:41.160]  Well, that was actually a cold-blooded laboratory where they shot off the power in the water,
[1:49:41.160 --> 1:49:45.400]  jammed the police radios, cut their lines, and the local parish in New Orleans had to
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:50.600]  come with guns and literally, at gunpoint, take FEMA off of the command centers that
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:55.640]  they were hijacking and cutting the lines because FEMA wanted it to be a disaster to
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:49:56.640]  get more funds.
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:49:58.480]  I mean, that's how cold-blooded these people are.
[1:49:58.480 --> 1:49:59.480]  And I agree with you.
[1:49:59.480 --> 1:50:01.320]  Now, that's what's going to happen here.
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:02.320]  Let's take some calls.
[1:50:02.320 --> 1:50:03.320]  Ben in Virginia.
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:05.480]  You're on the air with legendary trans forecaster, Gerald Solente.
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:06.880]  Ben, go ahead in Virginia.
[1:50:06.880 --> 1:50:08.240]  Hey, how are you doing?
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:09.240]  I love the show, Alex.
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:14.920]  I just wanted to ask where he thought banks like the Freelacoda Bank is going to play
[1:50:14.920 --> 1:50:19.000]  out in this new conflict because the Lakota have actually started their own gold-based
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  currency bank.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:27.200]  I think gold banks that come out and say that their assets, your deposits, are backed by
[1:50:27.200 --> 1:50:32.920]  gold are going to be one of the biggest businesses that anybody could ever imagine.
[1:50:32.920 --> 1:50:38.960]  And because, oh, by the way, here's a scenario that we're also relative to banks.
[1:50:38.960 --> 1:50:45.880]  We believe that being that they're putting the mantle of FDR on Obama, it is very highly
[1:50:45.880 --> 1:50:53.360]  probable that they're going to call a bank holiday, as FDR did also after he was inaugurated.
[1:50:53.360 --> 1:50:59.160]  Is that the surprise Biden's saying that on the 21st or 22nd Obama's going to do something
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:01.680]  next month that people aren't going to like?
[1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:08.920]  It could very well be because we believe that the banking system cannot sustain itself
[1:51:08.920 --> 1:51:12.000]  in its current form the way things are going now.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:15.040]  And a bank holiday, for those that don't know, means you can't get your money out and they
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:16.280]  devalue your money.
[1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:17.280]  Yeah.
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:22.120]  And I love the words they use, holiday, you know, like, let's have a holiday.
[1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:28.880]  The Patriot Act, the New Freedom Initiative, Homeland Security USA, the Fatherland, anything
[1:51:28.880 --> 1:51:29.880]  else, Ben?
[1:51:29.880 --> 1:51:31.520]  No, that's just about it.
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:35.440]  I just really think that this Freelacoda Bank is going to be huge.
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:36.800]  Let's talk to Mike in Wyoming.
[1:51:36.800 --> 1:51:39.040]  You're on the air with Gerald Salente.
[1:51:39.040 --> 1:51:40.040]  Hello?
[1:51:40.040 --> 1:51:41.040]  Yes, Mike.
[1:51:41.040 --> 1:51:42.040]  Go ahead.
[1:51:42.040 --> 1:51:43.040]  Yeah.
[1:51:43.040 --> 1:51:44.040]  Hi.
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:45.040]  How are you guys doing?
[1:51:45.040 --> 1:51:46.040]  Good.
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.040]  Yeah.
[1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:54.720]  Mr. Salente, it sounds like to me that you believe that we will avoid the sort of technocratic
[1:51:54.720 --> 1:52:01.600]  or Wellian nightmare that a lot of people think may come down the pipe here pretty soon.
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:09.520]  It also sounds like you also believe that we will avoid a Mad Max post-apocalyptic type
[1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:10.520]  of scenario.
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:14.640]  And we're going to go back to more of this sort of regionalism you were talking about
[1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:21.240]  and, you know, locally community-based, you know, lifestyle.
[1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:26.360]  And I guess I'm wondering, do you see the United States maintaining its territorial
[1:52:26.360 --> 1:52:27.360]  integrity?
[1:52:27.360 --> 1:52:32.920]  Are we going to just, you know, go into sort of like a factionalism?
[1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:35.520]  I think we're going to go into a factionalism.
[1:52:35.520 --> 1:52:40.480]  And again, you know, the Mad Max scenario and the techno takeover, they may happen.
[1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:42.880]  You know, we're not ruling that out completely.
[1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:48.000]  But what we're saying, for instance, on the techno level is that, you know, there's too
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:54.400]  many independent people out there that are more skilled technologically than the government
[1:52:54.400 --> 1:52:56.560]  people are in a lot of ways.
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:53:00.360]  And there are more of them that could break down the systems of control.
[1:53:00.360 --> 1:53:02.520]  And that's a possibility.
[1:53:02.520 --> 1:53:08.160]  The Mad Max, hey, may turn into that in different parts of the country.
[1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:09.160]  It may look like that.
[1:53:09.160 --> 1:53:12.440]  And by the way, the globalists have said they would like to use the crisis to break the
[1:53:12.440 --> 1:53:13.440]  country up.
[1:53:13.440 --> 1:53:17.960]  So we have to watch out for false revolutions and false revolutionary leaders that actually
[1:53:17.960 --> 1:53:18.960]  call for that.
[1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:20.400]  I do not want to break the United States up.
[1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:24.320]  They've got top Russian people projecting that that's going to happen.
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:26.640]  The Pentagon's protecting that could happen.
[1:53:26.640 --> 1:53:31.400]  We don't want to let the U.S. be broken up like China was 150 years ago by the European
[1:53:31.400 --> 1:53:32.400]  powers.
[1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:33.400]  Gerald, do you agree?
[1:53:33.400 --> 1:53:39.120]  I think we're going to look more like when Russia broke up after communism.
[1:53:39.120 --> 1:53:43.160]  More where the states start ruling themselves again, there's still a central government,
[1:53:43.160 --> 1:53:44.160]  but it implodes.
[1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:45.160]  Exactly.
[1:53:45.160 --> 1:53:46.160]  All right.
[1:53:46.160 --> 1:53:47.160]  Stay there.
[1:53:47.160 --> 1:53:48.160]  Final segment with Gerald Salente.
[1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:52.960]  Back in 70 seconds, stay with us.
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:58.160]  We'll be live at PrisonPlanet.tv in T-minus eight minutes for all the viewers watching
[1:53:58.160 --> 1:54:03.400]  live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:54:03.400 --> 1:54:05.000]  Final five minutes with Gerald Salente.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Want to thank him for coming on?
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.840]  Go to his website, TrendsResearch.com.
[1:54:07.840 --> 1:54:12.400]  You should subscribe to his Trends Report that comes out.
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:14.960]  How often does that Trends Report come out, Gerald?
[1:54:14.960 --> 1:54:19.920]  The Trends Journal was accordingly, and this issue, by the way, it's bigger than we've
[1:54:19.920 --> 1:54:24.880]  ever written before, it's 20 pages of trends that are in the making.
[1:54:24.880 --> 1:54:30.360]  But what we also do, and I want to make this very clear, is that we provide profit opportunities
[1:54:30.360 --> 1:54:34.920]  because we look at the trend and say, here's the dangers, here are the opportunities, because
[1:54:34.920 --> 1:54:42.680]  during this time of destruction, there's going to be, and may well there not should be, these
[1:54:42.680 --> 1:54:48.320]  huge mega-millionaires and billionaires, but people are going to be able to make very healthy
[1:54:48.320 --> 1:54:50.840]  livings during these times.
[1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:56.160]  And again, it's going to be, we think, with the breakup of the too big to fails at many
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:01.840]  levels, particularly retail, there's going to be a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities.
[1:55:01.840 --> 1:55:06.000]  And then what we do is we come out with trend alerts on a need-to-know basis.
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.880]  All right, folks, you should check that out.
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:12.200]  We also have links up on infowars.com to your find site.
[1:55:12.200 --> 1:55:16.480]  Let's go a little bit closer to home for you, Gerald, a Matt in New York.
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:17.480]  You're on the air, Matt.
[1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:18.480]  Hi, Alex.
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:19.480]  Hi, Gerald.
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:20.480]  This is Matt from mobilizethepeople.com.
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:24.640]  First of all, I want to commend both of you doing an outstanding job, Gerald, of very
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:25.640]  important work.
[1:55:25.640 --> 1:55:29.200]  Alex, very important, you getting it across to the people, as well as helping Gerald get
[1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:30.200]  it out.
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:33.880]  When the elected officials of the people fail to do the bidding on behalf of the people,
[1:55:33.880 --> 1:55:34.880]  the people must mobilize.
[1:55:34.880 --> 1:55:37.080]  Gerald, I have a question for you.
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:42.120]  Have you done any trending on the mass acceleration and growth of the Patriot movement groups
[1:55:42.120 --> 1:55:45.080]  and the role they will play out in the future?
[1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:50.280]  Not on that particularly, as I said, what we have been looking at closely are the secessionist
[1:55:50.280 --> 1:55:53.680]  movements, and we see those growing, as well.
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:55:58.200]  The people won't be mobilized until it hurts them in their pocketbook, their heart, their
[1:55:58.200 --> 1:55:59.200]  cold, and their hungry.
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:00.720]  Yeah, well, their stomachs are empty.
[1:56:00.720 --> 1:56:01.720]  Look out.
[1:56:01.720 --> 1:56:02.720]  Appreciate the call.
[1:56:02.720 --> 1:56:03.720]  Moving fast.
[1:56:03.720 --> 1:56:04.720]  Ron in Arizona.
[1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:05.720]  You're on the air with Gerald Salenta.
[1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:06.720]  Go ahead.
[1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:12.360]  Gerald, good afternoon, Gerald, and Alex and your two million listeners.
[1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:18.640]  I believe that the New World Order gang is putting clues into movies about future false
[1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:19.640]  flags.
[1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:21.360]  I'll give you two examples.
[1:56:21.360 --> 1:56:25.160]  1996, the movie Enemy of the State.
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:32.160]  The character played by Gene Hackman hacks into the NSA database to find the info on
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:34.160]  the John Boyd character.
[1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:38.040]  And his birthday is 9-11, and Fox ran the lone government, where the government hijacked
[1:56:38.040 --> 1:56:41.320]  planes, applied to the World Trade Center for Martial Law, and to attack Afghanistan
[1:56:41.320 --> 1:56:42.320]  six months before.
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:46.800]  And the long kiss, good night, with the government bombs the World Trade Center in 93, and then
[1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:48.680]  wants to bomb it again for martial law.
[1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:49.680]  Yeah, hundreds of...
[1:56:49.680 --> 1:56:51.160]  Gerald, why do they put this in movies?
[1:56:51.160 --> 1:56:54.960]  We know there's propaganda placement by the government in media.
[1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:58.680]  Why do we see them loving to flaunt what they're going to do beforehand?
[1:56:58.680 --> 1:57:05.560]  Well, you know, I would assume, and I don't know, but I would say to get the people prepared
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:07.320]  for it, to get prepared for the worst.
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:13.560]  So, when somebody relates to a Mad Max, they know what it looks like, and see how ugly
[1:57:13.560 --> 1:57:14.560]  it is.
[1:57:14.560 --> 1:57:19.280]  So, you know, again, look what the movies did during the World War II.
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:24.320]  I mean, you know, the propaganda, you know, not negative propaganda, maybe some, yes,
[1:57:24.320 --> 1:57:25.320]  maybe no.
[1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:29.800]  Notice there was all this war propaganda right before 9-11, all these big movies.
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:30.800]  Go ahead.
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:31.800]  Yeah, no.
[1:57:31.800 --> 1:57:35.360]  As I said, 9-11 came as no surprise to us.
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:38.680]  We've been predicting a major terror strike against the United States.
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:48.520]  So, again, though, I don't think that that's the major flag, and people forget things as
[1:57:48.520 --> 1:57:49.520]  well.
[1:57:49.520 --> 1:57:55.160]  When there's chaos, anything that they did before to control people, it really all breaks
[1:57:55.160 --> 1:57:56.160]  down immediately.
[1:57:56.160 --> 1:57:57.160]  Absolutely.
[1:57:57.160 --> 1:57:58.760]  Well, we're going into very interesting times.
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:57:59.760]  Thank you, Ron.
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:02.600]  Sorry, the other callers you can hold and talk to our next guest if you'd like.
[1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:06.680]  Gerald Solente, thank you for spending so much time with us, and I look forward to talking
[1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:09.720]  to you next year as all this unfolds.
[1:58:09.720 --> 1:58:11.240]  Thank you so much for having me on.
[1:58:11.240 --> 1:58:16.560]  An amazing individual having back on for a full show about solutions next time he joins
[1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:17.560]  us.
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:20.560]  All right, there goes Gerald Solente.
