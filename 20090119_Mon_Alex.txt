[00:00.000 --> 00:11.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well

[00:19.240 --> 00:23.240]  Texas Alex Jones

[00:31.560 --> 00:39.040]  here in the info or going to be live for the next four hours and we have the
[00:39.040 --> 00:44.240]  Bishop of Jerusalem joining us a prominent Christian leader over there to
[00:44.240 --> 00:48.880]  break down what's happening and now three four weeks into the ongoing Gaza
[00:48.880 --> 00:56.440]  bomb bombardment by Israeli forces so we'll be talking with him coming up for
[00:56.440 --> 00:59.680]  most of the show today I do want to open the phones up and take a lot of your
[00:59.680 --> 01:06.160]  phone calls dealing with the Barack Obama deception the false hope the
[01:06.160 --> 01:10.400]  propaganda being put out that he is going to fix everything he is going to
[01:10.400 --> 01:14.680]  save everybody if you thought that the Barack Obama worshiped by the corporate
[01:14.680 --> 01:19.720]  control mind control press was bad previous to him winning the election it
[01:19.720 --> 01:25.000]  is now many many times worse and we're going to be going over some of that as
[01:25.000 --> 01:32.560]  well today less than 24 hours out now from the inauguration George Bush eight
[01:32.560 --> 01:39.080]  years the eight-year nightmare is about to end but it's kind of like maybe when
[01:39.080 --> 01:43.600]  you have the flu or a cold and a lot of times when you have a flu or the cold
[01:43.600 --> 01:47.280]  you'll have nightmares when you're asleep and you'll you'll wake up from one
[01:47.280 --> 01:51.640]  nightmare go to the sink get a glass of water go back to sleep and have another
[01:51.640 --> 01:55.800]  nightmare and the next nightmare is even worse than the previous one and that's
[01:55.800 --> 01:59.840]  basically what we're going into right now if you think the eight years of
[01:59.840 --> 02:06.400]  George W. Bush have been bad get ready because Barack Obama is going to bring
[02:06.400 --> 02:11.080]  hell on earth to this nation and the rest of the planet this is the man this is
[02:11.080 --> 02:16.360]  I have never in modern history seen any example in the world of a government of
[02:16.360 --> 02:20.920]  the media of the elites getting behind someone like they're getting behind him
[02:20.920 --> 02:29.000]  and even the Washington Post last week I had seen it posted on prisonplanet.com
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.760]  but then I was watching some YouTube videos of the Webster Tarpley interview
[02:34.760 --> 02:37.840]  that Jason Burmist had last week doing a great job sitting in we appreciate him
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.880]  doing that and Tarpley was reading from the Washington Post where they said the
[02:41.880 --> 02:49.840]  posters the terms the flavor of it all is hitlerian slash Stalin and they gave
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.320]  examples and said that the Barack Obama campaign and the administration fully
[02:54.320 --> 02:58.600]  knows what they're doing but that went on to say it's a little unsettling but
[02:58.600 --> 03:06.400]  he's a good demigod and he's going to save us so they even admit this is
[03:06.400 --> 03:15.680]  classical demigod demigod preparation because they need to get the public
[03:15.680 --> 03:21.440]  hyped up into a frenzy and after decades of the media tearing down their
[03:21.440 --> 03:25.200]  puppet leaders you normally they just tear down the puppet presidents and
[03:25.200 --> 03:28.560]  imply that they actually run something and then blame the whole new order
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.600]  agenda that's very unpopular on them and then give the illusion that the buck
[03:32.600 --> 03:36.600]  actually stops there and that there's no elite handling and managing things from
[03:36.600 --> 03:40.760]  behind the scenes no roundtable grips no power behind the throne now they're
[03:40.760 --> 03:46.520]  shifting gears into something we've never seen in modern history in the
[03:46.520 --> 03:51.840]  United States and even going back to George Washington and others and of
[03:51.840 --> 03:56.360]  course when he was offered the kinship he said no and went home that's different
[03:56.360 --> 04:00.240]  with Barack Obama nothing has ever come close to this not with Kennedy not with
[04:00.240 --> 04:06.320]  Roosevelt not with Lincoln this type of just out and out worship unified
[04:06.320 --> 04:11.280]  worship by the media to try to sucker the public into this bandwagon so that
[04:11.280 --> 04:15.600]  they can in the first hundred days move in the gun control agenda like never
[04:15.600 --> 04:21.920]  before seen the carbon tax taxing the carbon cycle putting troops on the
[04:21.920 --> 04:28.680]  streets domestic stasi groups force national compulsory service new wars
[04:28.680 --> 04:34.320]  bloated record defense budgets corporate looting corporate handouts to
[04:34.320 --> 04:41.360]  themselves a new super private fellow reserve owning and running the nation

[10:05.040 --> 10:12.440]  some of the headlines today obama can save us obama can save us as america as
[10:12.440 --> 10:20.760]  polls show wave of optimism sweeping the nation venezuelan chavez says obama
[10:20.760 --> 10:27.160]  has the stench of bush and is no different he's right about that week
[10:27.160 --> 10:35.720]  ahead obama rally or earnings distress this from cnbc are we gonna see a big
[10:35.720 --> 10:40.600]  rally as the suckers all enter the stock market again because he's going to fix

[10:45.160 --> 10:51.080]  us right on the exact same course but throttle forward and put the ship of the
[10:51.080 --> 10:58.640]  new world order's engines on turbo obama team weighs government bank to ease
[10:58.640 --> 11:04.440]  crisis this is so huge i thought we already had a government bank the
[11:04.440 --> 11:09.400]  private run-for-profit federal reserve this is out of Reuters and of course a
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.880]  few months ago it came out the new york times that secretly they won't tell
[11:14.880 --> 11:19.160]  congress of the public the details of the private federal reserve is selling
[11:19.160 --> 11:27.520]  its own bonds to governments and major institutions and we haven't gotten new
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.480]  numbers in five weeks but a few months into the banker takeover 8.5 trillion
[11:32.480 --> 11:36.840]  on average 1 trillion 300 billion a week being taken and they won't tell anyone
[11:36.840 --> 11:41.920]  where it went including congress where did all the great transparency go to and
[11:41.920 --> 11:44.880]  remember it was obama who was the main architect of ramming that through with
[11:44.880 --> 11:49.480]  his handler ram a manuel the same handler who engineered the big democratic
[11:49.480 --> 11:54.360]  victory in 2006 in the house and senate to quote in the war and he laughed and
[11:54.360 --> 11:58.680]  giggled publicly after the fact that they lied to the liberals lied to the
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.200]  american people lied to the anti-war majority close to 80% major polls
[12:03.200 --> 12:07.680]  against the war in iraq wanting to end it and that they had fooled everyone and
[12:07.680 --> 12:12.320]  that it was so funny and that he actually worked to defeat true anti-war
[12:12.320 --> 12:17.360]  candidates in the democratic and republican party but back to the major
[12:17.360 --> 12:22.720]  bank a new ponzi scheme a new front group with with new powers for the bankers
[12:22.720 --> 12:26.120]  the incoming obama administration is considering setting up a government run
[12:26.120 --> 12:29.840]  bank to acquire bad assets now when you actually look at the plan they've
[12:29.840 --> 12:33.120]  announced it's a private bank but don't tell the public it's a government bank
[12:33.120 --> 12:39.320]  like they always do total deception just a level of a lie is what is overwhelming
[12:39.320 --> 12:43.960]  to people this is out of reuters obama team weighs government bank
[12:43.960 --> 12:47.320]  he's crisis i thought the federal reserve was that the incoming obama
[12:47.320 --> 12:50.960]  administration is considering setting up a government run bank run bank is the
[12:50.960 --> 12:54.000]  key word oh it's private but but we run it but we're not allowed to see what it's
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.320]  doing to acquire bad assets clogging the financial system a person familiar with
[13:01.320 --> 13:07.600]  the obama team's thinking set on sunday the u.s. federal reserve treasury and
[13:07.600 --> 13:12.360]  federal deposit insurance corporation have been in talks about ways to ease a
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.840]  banking crisis how do they ease it give themselves unlimited power in all of the
[13:17.840 --> 13:23.840]  money they'll save us from themselves who engineered it the u.s. federal reserve
[13:23.840 --> 13:27.680]  treasury and federal deposit insurance core have been in talks about ways to
[13:27.680 --> 13:32.160]  ease a banking crisis that is once again deepening oh they said if we didn't
[13:32.160 --> 13:35.840]  give them unlimited power in the 8.5 trillion everything would fall apart and
[13:35.840 --> 13:39.120]  would just all be over we have a depression oh and that wasn't enough now
[13:39.120 --> 13:42.640]  they need even more power than that will be enough oh no we need even more power
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.240]  oh that wasn't enough now we need even more power oh that wasn't enough now
[13:46.240 --> 13:49.400]  we've got to put you in work brigades now you've got to be forced to work for
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.880]  the government for slave wages or it'll all fall apart and if you speak out
[13:53.880 --> 13:57.080]  against it you're with the terrorists that are holding back obama's great plan
[13:57.080 --> 14:03.040]  of reorganization a government run aggregator bank is among the options
[14:03.040 --> 14:10.120]  outgoing treasury secretary henry paul said an fdic chairman shalia bear both
[14:10.120 --> 14:14.200]  set on friday a government bank was one of the number of ideas u.s. regulators
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.920]  had been discussing when they you hear regulators i.e. top private central bank
[14:18.920 --> 14:24.680]  leaders the source said advisors to president elect barack obama who takes
[14:24.680 --> 14:29.080]  office on tuesday were also considering the idea of an aggregator bank among a
[14:29.080 --> 14:33.640]  range of options that could be pursued david axelrod a top advisor to obama
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.320]  told Reuters at the new administration would have something to say about a
[14:37.320 --> 14:44.320]  fresh approach yes a fresh approach it's also fresh work brigades tattletale
[14:44.320 --> 14:50.200]  squads trips on the streets oh it's also fresh flotillas of new taxes it's so
[14:50.200 --> 14:58.800]  fresh open borders it's so fresh worship of him as a god it's so fresh carbon
[14:58.800 --> 15:03.880]  taxes it's so fresh david axelrod a top advisor to obama told Reuters the
[15:03.880 --> 15:06.520]  administration would have something to say about a fresh approach
[15:06.520 --> 15:11.640]  international crisis in the next few days all the unpopular and they're
[15:11.640 --> 15:16.080]  saying it's unpopular but you've got to give the bankers trillions more and
[15:16.080 --> 15:20.880]  even more power and the power to take over government infrastructure and state
[15:20.880 --> 15:24.520]  infrastructure into seas national parks and lands they're all saying this
[15:24.520 --> 15:28.560]  that's you've got to do it it's the only thing that'll save it the country is to
[15:28.560 --> 15:31.920]  hand all the infrastructure over to the foreign banks that engineered the crisis
[15:31.920 --> 15:36.560]  i'm not going to get into the structure of how we're going to approach the
[15:36.560 --> 15:40.920]  revamp financial rescue package see it's been revamped axelrod set up for
[15:40.920 --> 15:44.440]  speaking to a conference of mayors in washington what we have to do is approach
[15:44.440 --> 15:46.680]  this with a lot more transparency on the front end
[15:46.680 --> 15:52.360]  haha oh yes they're a total transparency will happen in addition to the steps to
[15:52.360 --> 15:55.920]  bolster banks obama officials want to aggressively attack the underlying
[15:55.920 --> 15:59.880]  causes of the credit crisis the short downturn in the u.s. housing market and
[15:59.880 --> 16:03.840]  related deterioration in mortgage related crises and they're going to keep the
[16:03.840 --> 16:06.720]  clamps on the real economy they're going to continue to kill it imploded so they
[16:06.720 --> 16:10.600]  can consolidate it while telling you they're funding the grassroots and
[16:10.600 --> 16:14.640]  funding main street mill trot out a few select groups and people that they do
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.400]  give some funds to to create the illusion to the herd that something's been done
[16:18.400 --> 16:22.760]  continuing the article there are a range of things we're going to have to do to
[16:22.760 --> 16:27.360]  stabilize the financial community and part of it is going to involve housing
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.920]  and part of it is going to involve how we approach the issue generally axelrod
[16:31.920 --> 16:38.120]  said it goes on back to the future in an outlining of the idea of the
[16:38.120 --> 16:42.240]  aggregator bank on friday that they just got paulson said the government could
[16:42.240 --> 16:45.800]  use money from the treasury administered a seven hundred billion which is really
[16:45.800 --> 16:48.280]  eight point five trillion their own record in congress saying that's just a
[16:48.280 --> 16:51.520]  number they made up to really eight point five trillion and now we don't know
[16:51.520 --> 16:54.280]  for five weeks what else they've stolen I'm sure when it comes out it's probably
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.080]  gonna be fourteen fifteen bill trill excuse me I can't even get that in my
[16:58.080 --> 17:02.320]  mind around the trillion number but again more deceptions every line is a
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.480]  deception every line is a twisting propaganda putsch just a tapestry of
[17:06.480 --> 17:10.840]  lies a tissue of lies a iron curtain of lies and outlining the idea of an
[17:10.840 --> 17:14.000]  aggregator bank on friday paulson said the government to use money from the
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.280]  treasury administered seven hundred billion financial rescue fund to
[17:16.280 --> 17:21.120]  capitalize a new institution that would be able to absorb toxic assets now
[17:21.120 --> 17:27.240]  weighing down bank balance sheets the hope would be that taking these bad
[17:27.240 --> 17:30.000]  assets off the hands of banks would allow the banks to attract badly needed
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.240]  private capital and renew lending but wait a minute they said that they had
[17:33.240 --> 17:36.640]  to have the seven hundred billion that in the bill so it was unlimited it could
[17:36.640 --> 17:40.800]  be it could be a google plexi could be infinity you know they could just make
[17:40.800 --> 17:46.160]  up and say infinity money for ourselves that we have to pay back in taxes and
[17:46.160 --> 17:50.120]  then the key to all of this you don't just pay to remember this and I know I
[17:50.120 --> 17:54.640]  keep repeating this because nobody else really talking about it not only do the
[17:54.640 --> 17:58.400]  american people have to pay all this money that's given off shore banks the
[17:58.400 --> 18:04.960]  trillions a week that they now they totally secret but you have to pay the
[18:04.960 --> 18:11.240]  banks interest to to to give them your money that you're paying for in taxes
[18:11.240 --> 18:14.440]  so you pay for all the money in taxes and then you pay the banks to take the
[18:14.440 --> 18:18.360]  money interest oh here here's all our money will pay it back will be slaves
[18:18.360 --> 18:22.960]  we'll have hundreds of new taxes and we'll pay you interest on it
[18:24.760 --> 18:30.640]  yes ladies and gentlemen it is unspeakable here's another analogy go to
[18:30.640 --> 18:34.680]  the shoe store there's a hundred dollar pair of dress shoes and the guy says
[18:34.680 --> 18:38.240]  behind the counter he says I've got a deal for you on all the shoes in here I
[18:38.240 --> 18:45.080]  will give you any shoes you want and I will pay you interest many times
[18:45.080 --> 18:50.080]  compounded over the value of the hundred dollar shoes I'm giving it so I
[18:50.080 --> 18:57.560]  will give you the shoes and then I will pay you to take the shoes I've been
[18:57.560 --> 19:00.640]  using the analogy of you know going on their car dealership and buying a
[19:00.640 --> 19:04.800]  sixty thousand dollar Mercedes and then they pay you sixty thousand dollars to
[19:04.800 --> 19:09.560]  take the free Mercedes but it's worse than that because if you look at all the
[19:09.560 --> 19:13.120]  central banks work they'll give a billion dollar loan to some country or
[19:13.120 --> 19:16.400]  group and then it ends up being fifty billion on average they pay back at the
[19:16.400 --> 19:21.440]  thirty forty percent compounded interest so it'd be kind of like here I'll give
[19:21.440 --> 19:25.960]  you these hundred dollar pair shoes and I'll pay you five thousand dollars to
[19:25.960 --> 19:30.200]  take the hundred dollar pair for free aren't I your friend so remember
[19:30.200 --> 19:35.280]  Paulson said we absolutely must have this seven hundred billion or everything
[19:35.280 --> 19:39.800]  will collapse we have to buy the toxic mortgages and other securities and then
[19:39.800 --> 19:44.120]  the next day on Saturday after it passed October 4th he says we don't need it for
[19:44.120 --> 19:47.240]  that now and then now they're back three and a half months later saying we've
[19:47.240 --> 19:56.480]  gotta have even more money and even more power to to to buy the toxic assets it's
[19:56.480 --> 20:01.400]  just unbelievable a lot more news coming up your call stay with us I am so
[20:01.400 --> 20:05.800]  frustrated I can't seem to remember anything anymore what seriously my
[20:05.800 --> 20:09.640]  memory and attention span is terrible I read something and forget I forget

[20:13.000 --> 20:17.920]  tell people but I forget I okay slow down poor attention and memory loss is not
[20:17.920 --> 20:21.720]  your fault factors like fluoride in the water aluminum and deodorants
[20:21.720 --> 20:26.080]  genetically modified foods the way the education system taught you it's all

[21:09.560 --> 21:14.280]  rising cost of food energy housing and medical many retirees are forced to live
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.560]  below the poverty line is this a flaw free enterprise or is our monetary unit

[24:10.520 --> 24:15.920]  diversion that is Barack Obama the puppet the front man the handled
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.840]  corporate shield the pitchman for the military industrial complex owned by
[24:21.840 --> 24:25.520]  the foreign offshore banks that are looting this nation to the tune of
[24:25.520 --> 24:32.400]  trillions of dollars a week already irrevocable devastating damage while they
[24:32.400 --> 24:36.280]  build up the police in the military and now acclimate the public for the use of
[24:36.280 --> 24:40.840]  those police military against the American people they build up the
[24:40.840 --> 24:44.720]  anti-terror system in the name of fighting on kind of the imaginary
[24:44.720 --> 24:51.920]  brotherhood the Immanuel Goldstein living in the Orwellian caves and then
[24:51.920 --> 24:56.880]  they overnight flip it and say oh no we're gonna fight domestic terrorists
[24:56.880 --> 25:00.840]  and protesters and we're preparing the military to fight the American people
[25:00.840 --> 25:07.640]  for nationwide insurrection here we are and we're covering and tracking the
[25:07.640 --> 25:18.560]  giant diversion there's this newsweek headline this was actually the January
[25:18.560 --> 25:27.680]  5th newsweek cover the new global elite special double-issue newsweek there's a
[25:27.680 --> 25:31.360]  global elite I thought that didn't exist but the North American Union didn't
[25:31.360 --> 25:36.520]  exist I thought none of this existed and it's Barack Obama with the globe and
[25:36.520 --> 25:43.760]  all these Orwellian big brother symbols around him and it's got all these world
[25:43.760 --> 25:48.680]  leaders names like Rahm Emanuel General David Petraeus Bill Gates John Claude
[25:48.680 --> 25:59.200]  Trishant Nicholas Sarkozy Eric Schmidt Jim Rogers Rex Tillerson
[25:59.200 --> 26:08.040]  Rupert Murdoch Angela Merkel Oprah Winfrey
[26:08.040 --> 26:15.200]  Bill Clinton and the the names are all surrounding him and energizing him and
[26:15.200 --> 26:20.560]  it's got all this occultic numbering and all of these different mind control
[26:20.560 --> 26:30.680]  patterns and squiggles the symbols are all associated with magic very occultic
[26:30.680 --> 26:34.520]  bizarre cover and it says they're the global elite and they're gonna save you
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.080]  and they know what to do and don't worry just do whatever Barack Obama says
[26:38.080 --> 26:46.760]  and this group of elitist insiders surrounding him they are going to save you
[26:46.760 --> 26:53.640]  they are going to take care of you and this is basically a regurgitation of
[26:53.640 --> 26:57.440]  the Rothkopf former head of the Kissinger group that we had on last year he
[26:57.440 --> 27:00.960]  wrote superclass and in there he admits the others 5,000 people that work for an
[27:00.960 --> 27:06.440]  elite banking group who own and run the entire planet and if you look at those
[27:06.440 --> 27:15.600]  5,000 4,900 and something of the 5,000 are just elite level legates managers
[27:15.600 --> 27:22.000]  frontmen again the legate was under the Roman imperial system the emperor
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.040]  couldn't be everywhere at all times and before that the Senate when it was
[27:27.040 --> 27:31.200]  running things it would have legates and it was a normally old wise men who had
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.880]  shown that they weren't looking to usurp or overthrow or be on their own
[27:35.880 --> 27:42.240]  personal power trips learned scholars and the normally an emperor would only
[27:42.240 --> 27:45.400]  have two or three legates and they could be sent to different areas the
[27:45.400 --> 27:48.680]  empire to speak as the emperor and they would hold their arms up at their sides
[27:48.680 --> 27:58.080]  and make a pronouncement I in the name of the emperor speak as the emperor and
[27:58.080 --> 28:05.720]  then they would speak as the emperor and that's what these well there's less
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.440]  than 20 families that own this whole thing and in any one time each nation
[28:10.440 --> 28:15.880]  will have a legate who can speak at these world council meetings most of them
[28:15.880 --> 28:19.600]  secret or private they're not so much secret anymore because we expose them
[28:19.600 --> 28:25.160]  great danger to ourselves I would add and there's only a couple hundred
[28:25.160 --> 28:30.920]  legates and then there's a few maybe a dozen or so super legates and a super
[28:30.920 --> 28:38.520]  legate is as a big news in ski a super legate is a Henry Kissinger and that's
[28:38.520 --> 28:43.480]  why you'll see presidents and prime ministers groveling to him on television
[28:43.480 --> 28:51.680]  because he speaks for the world governing council and so when he tells you
[28:51.680 --> 29:00.720]  something he is speaking for the world council that operates as an oligarchy
[29:00.720 --> 29:08.600]  which in their inner circles is an imperium and governs the imperium they
[29:08.600 --> 29:12.640]  have all their experts all their technicians over every subsector this
[29:12.640 --> 29:15.640]  thing looks incredibly complex and it is but they've developed it over hundreds
[29:15.640 --> 29:19.000]  of years of statecraft and different divisions and subsectors that all
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.680]  operate in unison and tandem and they have think tanks and specialists and
[29:24.680 --> 29:29.520]  groups that study and fine-tune their propaganda their operations and their
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.160]  systems management and their behavioral psychology about how systems
[29:34.160 --> 29:40.320]  interlock and interlace and meanwhile you have a public completely unaware of
[29:40.320 --> 29:44.160]  even what's going on that has no idea that these people are eugenicists and
[29:44.160 --> 29:47.960]  are killing all of us with soft-kill weapons and then once the world
[29:47.960 --> 29:52.640]  governments in place they're gonna use hard kill hot kill we're on the March the
[29:52.640 --> 30:01.720]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network doctors around the
[30:01.720 --> 30:05.520]  world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced
[30:05.520 --> 30:09.720]  alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly acidic due to stress
[30:09.720 --> 30:14.240]  acidic diet and lack of exercise pH balance is the foundation of energy

[30:22.640 --> 30:26.840]  of weight it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water but due to
[30:26.840 --> 30:30.880]  modern way of life most people are overly acidic the fact is that disease
[30:30.880 --> 30:34.840]  simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment fat accumulates if a person
[30:34.840 --> 30:39.040]  consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it do your part

[33:19.000 --> 33:25.760]  they deliver the agenda of the elite they're delusional ABC News admits that a
[33:25.760 --> 33:29.800]  secret list of US military bases to replace Guantanamo Bay as I told you
[33:29.800 --> 33:34.160]  months ago he's not getting rid of any of them they simply have built and set
[33:34.160 --> 33:39.880]  up in the last seven years a network from Poland to Georgia to Egypt
[33:39.880 --> 33:55.600]  Joe places like Cairo Jordan they have CIA run true torture camps Guantanamo Bay
[33:55.600 --> 33:59.800]  was used admittedly the Pentagon's admitted as a laboratory of how to
[33:59.800 --> 34:02.600]  torture people how to control people they have two camps they have the public
[34:02.600 --> 34:07.920]  camp that they let some media into and where they show look we even feed them
[34:07.920 --> 34:13.280]  we give them apples and it's we give them prayer rugs and and then inside that
[34:13.280 --> 34:17.040]  there's an internal CIA base where all the horrible torture went on and that
[34:17.040 --> 34:20.640]  was innocent people they brought in there predominantly and now after seven
[34:20.640 --> 34:26.680]  years in many cases of torture they are going to have show trials that Bush is
[34:26.680 --> 34:32.240]  starting in the United States where they tell them we won't execute you if you
[34:32.240 --> 34:36.000]  plead guilty and then their lawyers have gone into trial even in the kangaroo
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.120]  courts and have said my client was tortured and so then they have to
[34:41.120 --> 34:44.400]  suspend the trials to get the media attention off of it and they start them
[34:44.400 --> 34:49.200]  back up so Obama is continuing exactly the policy shut down Guantanamo Bay in
[34:49.200 --> 34:55.200]  the next year which they're going to do and then simply take people to the
[34:55.200 --> 35:00.000]  secret facilities they have built all over the world Guantanamo is only there
[35:00.000 --> 35:03.720]  to develop torture and to sell the American people on look we caught the
[35:03.720 --> 35:06.880]  terrorists we put them in a cage but they couldn't catch any of the real
[35:06.880 --> 35:14.720]  terrorists because they're all CIA or MI six or Pakistani intelligence ISI
[35:14.720 --> 35:20.560]  operatives and that's all come out the CIA commander in Afghanistan even
[35:20.560 --> 35:23.680]  admitted in his book job record we had him on that they were not allowed to
[35:23.680 --> 35:27.280]  capture any real Taliban or Al Qaeda they would grab 12 and 14 year old kids
[35:27.280 --> 35:31.600]  off the mountaintops out there with their goat herds who couldn't even find
[35:31.600 --> 35:37.680]  the United States on a map and fly them to Gitmo for hardcore torture but now
[35:37.680 --> 35:44.160]  that they've gotten the people they need oh we've got a top Al Qaeda guy for a
[35:44.160 --> 35:52.600]  month he drove bin Laden in a limo you know he's he's he's the top guy but the
[35:52.600 --> 35:56.480]  shallow public that's only halfway paying attention some of them buy into it
[35:56.480 --> 36:04.600]  so Obama will do a few things that are symbolic he will probably shut down
[36:04.600 --> 36:10.280]  Guantanamo Bay and make a big deal out of it Pelosi's saying we may consider
[36:10.280 --> 36:14.640]  prosecuting a few Bush administration officials on some little side issues but
[36:14.640 --> 36:17.240]  they can't go after my anything substantive because the Democrats are all
[36:17.240 --> 36:22.080]  tied in as well Joe Biden is up to his eyeballs in much of what the Bush
[36:22.080 --> 36:25.760]  administration has done most of the Bush administration in key positions like
[36:25.760 --> 36:33.080]  Defense Secretary are staying on the rest are Clinton retreads and minions of
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.440]  the IMF World Bank and United Nations that are coming in so it's meet the new
[36:38.440 --> 36:44.120]  boss same as the old boss secret list of US military bases to replace Gitmo
[36:44.120 --> 36:48.280]  US military has prepared a list of US military bases that can be used to
[36:48.280 --> 36:51.080]  house as many as 250 detainees currently being held in US Naval Base
[36:51.080 --> 36:55.320]  Guantanamo Bay military officials tell ABC News the list which includes Camp
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.840]  Pendleton in California Fort Leavenworth in Kansas the Marine Air Station in
[36:59.840 --> 37:06.480]  Miramar, California and the US Naval Consolidated Brig in South Carolina has
[37:06.480 --> 37:10.240]  been circulated in a classified break to members of the Congress and was
[37:10.240 --> 37:16.040]  prepared by the Air Force Joint Staff that's not even mentioning it says the
[37:16.040 --> 37:22.680]  headline secret list those aren't secret they held the supposed dirty bomber in
[37:22.680 --> 37:25.960]  South Carolina at that break
[37:27.960 --> 37:32.320]  then we have all these former articles that we posted ex-Gitmo guard who saw
[37:32.320 --> 37:38.400]  torture calls co-worker psychotic it goes on and on then of course got Abu
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.840]  Ghaib and hundreds of other torture camps and death camps all over Iraq mass
[37:42.840 --> 37:46.600]  graves everywhere the people just machine gunned whole families thrown into
[37:46.600 --> 37:50.880]  pits and those military people are coming back here to be your cops to be
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.680]  your local CIA commissariat I mean they're bringing hard-core classical
[37:55.680 --> 38:00.640]  tyranny with a high-tech integrated overlay a technological enslavement
[38:00.640 --> 38:04.960]  grid to the United States and worldwide I'm gonna go to your calls in a moment
[38:04.960 --> 38:11.040]  coming up new A&E FBI show portrays 9-11 truthers as dope smoking terrorist
[38:11.040 --> 38:16.840]  and this is a complex piece of propaganda I'm sure you've seen all the ad
[38:16.840 --> 38:23.760]  counsel federally paid for billboards TV ads newsprint ads radio ads where it
[38:23.760 --> 38:29.920]  says if you smoke pot you're funding al-Qaeda and that marijuana is terrorism
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.120]  because they know that 80 plus percent of drug users illegal drug users only use
[38:34.120 --> 38:37.760]  marijuana they don't use anything else so they need to keep that illegal to keep
[38:37.760 --> 38:42.400]  their phony drug war going and they're now converting the drug war over to the
[38:42.400 --> 38:47.880]  police state war against the American people of the anti-terror war the anti
[38:47.880 --> 38:51.320]  insurrection war so that's a key part of the infrastructure that's how they got
[38:51.320 --> 38:54.080]  troops on the streets that's how they militarized police that's how they got
[38:54.080 --> 38:59.400]  this program into place so they need to continue in this program in this any
[38:59.400 --> 39:06.840]  program or play the clip later you've got terrorists who want to fund terror
[39:06.840 --> 39:16.000]  groups in iraq killing u.s. troops and 9-11 truth is funding al-Qaeda terrorists
[39:16.000 --> 39:21.000]  now now understand that 9-11 truth the movement is exposing false flag terror
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.920]  that has been declassified over 200 times by the u.s. government alone staging
[39:26.920 --> 39:30.920]  terror attacks attacking our own bases attacking our own ships killing people
[39:30.920 --> 39:37.280]  and blaming it on enemies that they want to demonize in the press and or attack so
[39:37.280 --> 39:42.120]  our whole movement is about exposing the fact that this foreign anti-american
[39:42.120 --> 39:49.200]  globalist military our military is now totally foreign control is staging terror
[39:49.200 --> 39:55.840]  attacks and it's admitted to hundreds and hundreds of newspapers Israel admits
[39:55.840 --> 39:58.680]  they've staged terror attacks they created a mosque they every time they
[39:58.680 --> 40:03.800]  don't want to be still they blow something up and claim the terrorist it's on
[40:03.800 --> 40:09.600]  record her it's Jerusalem post it's all there it's in my films
[40:10.760 --> 40:14.040]  well I'm already getting into this the point is I'm gonna cover it more in
[40:14.040 --> 40:20.160]  detail later we go live an hour and a half at prison planet dot tv some will
[40:20.160 --> 40:32.720]  cast last after the show that in this piece 9-11 truth is is is staging
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.880]  terror attacks funding terrorist giving terrorist grenade launchers and they
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.200]  smoke pot they're just constantly smoking pot I want to kill american
[40:43.200 --> 40:48.080]  ribs all smoke the weed which which which then it sends the message people
[40:48.080 --> 40:53.880]  that smoke pot want to kill troops so the week-minded troops watch that and
[40:53.880 --> 40:56.960]  then think of the american people as terrorist so that they'll go out more
[40:56.960 --> 41:00.400]  happily and gun down the public as the police state goes into place and the
[41:00.400 --> 41:08.080]  public's forced to rebel and also glorifies the little spy on the show
[41:08.080 --> 41:12.000]  little FBI spy who's you know who's there to stop it and there's there's this
[41:12.000 --> 41:15.960]  huge domestic threat of domestic terrorists that don't exist and they're
[41:15.960 --> 41:21.000]  9-11 truth and they smoke weed I mean does it that insult all of your
[41:21.000 --> 41:29.960]  intelligence out there I'm gonna break it down more later speaking of 9-11
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.200]  truth 9-11 truth rant featured in hit tv show rescue me with Daniel Sinjata I
[41:34.200 --> 41:40.480]  want to get him back on the show this week and then later council official
[41:40.480 --> 41:44.960]  evicted elderly tenants from bungalows then moved herself in now we see this
[41:44.960 --> 41:48.640]  in san francisco in some famous cases we see this all over the United States
[41:48.640 --> 41:52.480]  this is england and see they don't just have cps here in the u.s. and england
[41:52.480 --> 41:59.680]  now under the eugenics program that's all founded all started they and you know
[41:59.680 --> 42:04.440]  my father is a dentist and also a real surgeon so he has a lot of patients and
[42:04.440 --> 42:08.920]  he says he has well-to-do patients coming in now and they'll seem really
[42:08.920 --> 42:11.680]  upset people he's known for years and he'll say well you know what's wrong
[42:11.680 --> 42:16.000]  well they're getting the filling done or something a root canal and they'll say
[42:16.000 --> 42:22.720]  oh it's it's it's it's my mother you know she's 88 years old and we took her
[42:22.720 --> 42:28.800]  into the hospital and you know she had a tiny little sore on her back and who
[42:28.800 --> 42:32.640]  doesn't get those so they they they seized her from us and put her in
[42:32.640 --> 42:37.040]  hospice and are now giving her more morphine you know killing her and what
[42:37.040 --> 42:41.360]  do I do somebody had calls me up and says what's your advice on this and I sit
[42:41.360 --> 42:48.160]  there and give them quick advice on go ahead and call the police don't sign
[42:48.160 --> 42:52.960]  anything threaten to sue them go ahead and have a lawyer start filing suit go
[42:52.960 --> 42:57.240]  in and file injunctions that civil rights are being violated see there's no
[42:57.240 --> 43:00.080]  due process they just say oh there's a sore on your mother's back we're gonna
[43:00.080 --> 43:05.120]  go ahead and euthanizer but then they started trying and in that case of
[43:05.120 --> 43:08.440]  some others I've seen and I've seen this all over the country personal cases I've
[43:08.440 --> 43:15.080]  seen they try to then seize the money of the old people and boy with their
[43:15.080 --> 43:19.080]  favorite thing is you see they have databases and I didn't know why this was
[43:19.080 --> 43:26.640]  happening back in 1996 9798 when some of the first investigative reports we did
[43:26.640 --> 43:33.080]  before I even made documentaries or about the fact that say Rowling
[43:33.080 --> 43:42.160]  Ellingston would go in to have surgery done for colon cancer old guy seventy
[43:42.160 --> 43:44.440]  something years old veteran no criminal record
[43:44.440 --> 43:54.640]  arborist and Roland goes in he has the surgery and they're there at that time
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.560]  filling it out by hand this is how discovered all this and now it's just
[43:58.560 --> 44:03.440]  rampant everywhere in the schools and in corporations everywhere they had him
[44:03.440 --> 44:07.880]  you know they said do you live alone oh well you know and and where do you live
[44:07.880 --> 44:13.560]  your property do you eat a lot of meals is somebody taking care of you and he
[44:13.560 --> 44:17.280]  thought it was all strange and then suddenly when he got out of the hospital
[44:17.280 --> 44:22.160]  he found on his door all these notices he was first given seven days when he
[44:22.160 --> 44:25.640]  didn't respond in seven days in the hospital for two weeks every day was a
[44:25.640 --> 44:32.400]  $2,000 fine and I first learned of this in 96 so I go over there to his house we
[44:32.400 --> 44:37.720]  interviewing he lived on what West 37th Street he owned two houses side by side
[44:37.720 --> 44:41.000]  at the time they were worth about a half million dollars a piece now they're
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.040]  worth even more the real estate was going up and they knew that and so the
[44:46.040 --> 44:50.120]  health department goes out and they have the database because that's a health
[44:50.120 --> 44:53.000]  department database now it's done by computer you go to have a baby you go to
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.280]  have surgery you take your child to the pediatrician that's what Obama is doing
[44:59.280 --> 45:03.640]  under law now everybody's gonna have every dentist every doctor every nurse
[45:03.640 --> 45:08.720]  is gonna have to ask these questions do you own guns whatever and then that's
[45:08.720 --> 45:12.960]  owning guns is at risk so that gets a CPS visit son gets a lot on guns but still
[45:12.960 --> 45:16.600]  you get a visit secret police everywhere that's what this is all
[45:16.600 --> 45:20.840]  institutionalized into the hospital or to the public school where you trust them
[45:20.840 --> 45:24.600]  where you're the helpers I mean that's it's like going to confession now but
[45:24.600 --> 45:27.680]  but but using that to spy on people when you go to the school counselor and
[45:27.680 --> 45:33.080]  that's all used against you I'm going to your calls and that this is just so
[45:33.080 --> 45:44.120]  important and so then I found out well well once I did that TV program the
[45:44.120 --> 45:48.880]  police a week later came out knocked on Roland's door Roland came to the door
[45:48.880 --> 45:56.280]  and they said you're drunk and Roland was a really quiet gentlemanly well
[45:56.280 --> 45:59.600]  spoken fellow and he said you know the funny thing is I might drink a beer every
[45:59.600 --> 46:02.400]  few weeks I wasn't even drinking and the cops got me to come out on the front
[46:02.400 --> 46:05.680]  porch and they slammed him on the ground put him in the car and took him to
[46:05.680 --> 46:11.360]  jail for being drunk in his yard now we put all this on TV and we showed he was
[46:11.360 --> 46:19.040]  getting $2,000 a day fines while in the hospital and then after for uncut lawn and
[46:19.040 --> 46:22.920]  other questionable objectionable material which could be anything so we
[46:22.920 --> 46:26.840]  went and showed his yard that it was three-inch grass English Ivy very nice
[46:26.840 --> 46:32.240]  we kept you know his business at 70 something was mowing yards and they
[46:32.240 --> 46:35.960]  claimed a flower pot in the back sitting on the ground without a plant growing out
[46:35.960 --> 46:44.840]  of it was trash and when we did that report suddenly hundreds of calls for
[46:44.840 --> 46:48.600]  to coming into the comment line and I was going to all these old people's
[46:48.600 --> 46:52.400]  houses and they'd say I don't know what happened you know Bob when he had a
[46:52.400 --> 46:56.320]  heart attack he went in and then suddenly elder care was here trying to
[46:56.320 --> 47:03.960]  force us into a nursing home and then they took our house and then I found
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.560]  out about cases where where they would steal the old person's house put them
[47:08.560 --> 47:12.360]  in a nursing home or send them to hospice to euthanize them and then the
[47:12.360 --> 47:20.040]  bastards would actually then claim it was seized by the city or claim it had
[47:20.040 --> 47:25.680]  back taxes and then they would take the house and then sell it on the courthouse
[47:25.680 --> 47:31.000]  steps in enclosed unannounced sales and then they would buy it themselves and
[47:31.000 --> 47:38.920]  move in and then my grandmother calls in 97 lives here in Austin and she says
[47:38.920 --> 47:47.160]  yeah Bill is in the backyard my grandfather and there's a city drainage
[47:47.160 --> 47:51.320]  about 10 yards over their back fence not on their property line and they said
[47:51.320 --> 47:55.560]  $2,000 a day fines he doesn't clean out all the brush that's back there in it
[47:55.560 --> 47:59.080]  they're saying it's from our property which it wasn't they didn't have trees
[47:59.080 --> 48:04.800]  on their back fence line and I said no I'll come over there this weekend and
[48:04.800 --> 48:08.600]  clean it out or we'll hire somebody to do it you know I don't want him at 70
[48:08.600 --> 48:11.200]  something years old he'd have to you know be back there doing it what are the
[48:11.200 --> 48:16.840]  best of shape and then he had a heart attack cleaning that out and then they
[48:16.840 --> 48:20.920]  tried the similar stuff with them so then I was experiencing they're doing
[48:20.920 --> 48:28.360]  this well here's an article dealing with it out of the mail online today and it
[48:28.360 --> 48:32.080]  says as a council official responsibility for helping the homeless
[48:32.080 --> 48:35.560]  Christine Reeves knows how much people value their homes which makes it
[48:35.560 --> 48:38.560]  difficult to explain how she came to play a key role in evicting frail and
[48:38.560 --> 48:43.200]  elderly tenants from their bungalows then moved into one with her partner the
[48:43.200 --> 48:48.280]  52,000 pound that's about a hundred and ten thousand dollar a year head of
[48:48.280 --> 48:51.880]  neighborhood strategic housing was just one of 18 council employees who took up
[48:51.880 --> 48:57.560]  residents in former sheltered accommodation at the greyhound opening
[48:57.560 --> 49:05.320]  site in norwich so what they do is they invite to the socialist system oh old
[49:05.320 --> 49:08.560]  people moving these little bungalows they have to pay but it's subsidized by
[49:08.560 --> 49:13.160]  the government and then they come in and they grab them and stick them in the
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.640]  euthanasia centers I mean these people are sick and they do it all day long and
[49:18.640 --> 49:21.600]  nobody's gonna stop them except us the American people and the people of
[49:21.600 --> 49:25.920]  England the world these are parasite degenerates and they have to be exposed
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.440]  and dealt with okay I have seen this myself okay that's why I hate the
[49:30.440 --> 49:34.280]  government and hate the city hall and know they're a bunch of scum because
[49:34.280 --> 49:40.840]  they do it everywhere she also benefited from the rent at one house
[49:40.840 --> 49:48.560]  bungalow she took over two months ago so that's also what they do they take
[49:48.560 --> 49:51.560]  houses and rent them out similar properties in the area cost between
[49:51.560 --> 49:55.840]  350 and 750 a month so on her own house she set the rate for her
[49:55.840 --> 50:02.160]  self from 750 pounds a month to 47 pounds a month so so so the bureaucrats
[50:02.160 --> 50:05.840]  don't just take the houses and move into them and stick the old people in the
[50:05.840 --> 50:11.200]  hospice they also it is even for them they don't care their parasites they've
[50:11.200 --> 50:14.920]  run rampant and they're about to create millions more of these bureaucrats in
[50:14.920 --> 50:19.160]  England and tens of millions here as the declaration of independence says to go
[50:19.160 --> 50:23.440]  out and eat out our substance miss reeves 38 has now been suspended on full pay by
[50:23.440 --> 50:27.360]  labor run Norwich City Council yeah folks were to riot in that city she
[50:27.360 --> 50:30.520]  ended up being arrested just like they finally arrested the cop last week who
[50:30.520 --> 50:33.760]  cold-bloodedly murdered the guy and then started slapping him around after he
[50:33.760 --> 50:40.520]  shot him for no reason council leader Steve Morphin has promised to make good
[50:40.520 --> 50:46.880]  the damage miss reeves 38 has now been suspended with full pay which admits
[50:46.880 --> 50:51.520]  conflict of interest rules were flouted conflict of interest throwing old people

[55:31.480 --> 55:37.000]  the year greetings from the chicago prison grid there alex how you today pretty
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.840]  good my friend hey i got a just one thing i are a couple things actually but
[55:41.840 --> 55:45.880]  first about the with the senior citizens and stuff believe me my mother works for
[55:45.880 --> 55:51.320]  the state of missouri in the department of aging and her you know it's a
[55:51.320 --> 55:57.160]  constant frustration with her trying to get funding or care for people in genuine
[55:57.160 --> 56:02.560]  need because the money and care are going to basically what she describes as
[56:02.560 --> 56:10.240]  lazy lazy people in there they're people my age your age alex that are would be
[56:10.240 --> 56:14.200]  fine if they had made a diet of big macs for ten fifteen years just let's be
[56:14.200 --> 56:19.000]  clear i mean let's be clear there are good police officers there are good
[56:19.000 --> 56:25.680]  social workers but the system itself is corrupt so you know that's why 50 plus
[56:25.680 --> 56:31.520]  percent of cps workers quit in the first year as the highest turnover of any
[56:31.520 --> 56:36.720]  government job because they go into it for the right reasons they want to stop
[56:36.720 --> 56:40.120]  people beating their kids with tire irons are you know things that are going
[56:40.120 --> 56:43.480]  on but the evil the government commits in the name of stopping that is much
[56:43.480 --> 56:47.520]  greater in the overarching program is meant to break up families and extinct
[56:47.520 --> 56:53.040]  the family unit that's the stated reason it was all founded so so you know there
[56:53.040 --> 56:55.920]  are people within the system that try to do a good job because good school
[56:55.920 --> 57:00.560]  teachers but the point is the system itself is designed for bad
[57:00.560 --> 57:04.920]  all absolutely and you know it and you're right i mean as far as that goes
[57:04.920 --> 57:10.920]  but i i just out well while we're also on the old bomb uh... coronation this
[57:10.920 --> 57:14.640]  week uh... is a coronation it's a coronation
[57:14.640 --> 57:19.800]  absolutely i mean you know here we are we are broke i work in it of course a
[57:19.800 --> 57:24.880]  customer service job what else is there but in my job is contingent upon
[57:24.880 --> 57:31.280]  of the american people's ability to buy purchase things from a major corporation
[57:31.280 --> 57:35.600]  uh... my phone to silent for an hour at a time easily
[57:35.600 --> 57:39.960]  we're in huge but they're going to waste a hundred and fifty million dollars on
[57:39.960 --> 57:42.080]  this bread and circus show
[57:42.080 --> 57:45.560]  that i find i mean for me it's more defying
[57:45.560 --> 57:49.480]  you know i don't know it's a historic it's historic well you know what it was
[57:49.480 --> 57:54.240]  it's more looking dream real life now if i just watch that speech an hour ago
[57:54.240 --> 57:56.880]  martin luther king speech and if you look at it
[57:56.880 --> 58:01.320]  it's a beautiful thing you have a crowd that truly diverse everyone stand in
[58:01.320 --> 58:02.280]  together
[58:02.280 --> 58:05.680]  but then you go back tonight obama won that election it looked like proverbial
[58:05.680 --> 58:07.160]  sign filled cookie
[58:07.160 --> 58:11.280]  and anybody watch the show knows what i'm talking about the black and white
[58:11.280 --> 58:12.880]  divided cookie

[58:26.880 --> 58:30.400]  putting regular army troops on the streets along with national guard
[58:30.400 --> 58:34.000]  again all of this is a conditioning acclimating exercise

[1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:36.680]  though the military announces
[1:01:36.680 --> 1:01:40.000]  on record that it is for the american people not to fight terror but to
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:44.120]  suppress the american people that is bill
[1:01:44.120 --> 1:01:47.160]  you know that is what the bills state that is what the john warren defense
[1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:48.920]  authorization act states

[1:01:53.800 --> 1:01:59.800]  uh... i'm not saying anything will be staged tomorrow
[1:01:59.800 --> 1:02:03.080]  it's also a major magnet for crazies
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:07.240]  there's a good chance they'll be some crazies on their own there
[1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:08.680]  out of their mind
[1:02:08.680 --> 1:02:10.760]  violence schizophrenics who think that
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:15.440]  they're really obama and how dare him they've got a stop the imposter
[1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:19.200]  from taking over you know that's the classic type of m o
[1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:22.200]  obama's the antichrist and they've got a
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:24.040]  you know they've got to
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:26.000]  and killing
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.160]  or they've got to
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:33.280]  get within a hundred yards of him to do a magic spell to reverse the antichrist
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:34.920]  you know i mean
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:37.440]  i've studied crazies i've dealt with crazies
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:39.160]  that's the type of m o you see
[1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:42.400]  if it's a real organic night
[1:02:42.400 --> 1:02:48.480]  but more often than not you've got federal handlers of teenagers in groups
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:51.960]  two-and-a-half years ago the case in miami where they went and found the black
[1:02:51.960 --> 1:02:53.040]  street
[1:02:53.040 --> 1:02:54.220]  group
[1:02:54.220 --> 1:02:57.760]  of rostafarians and then on the news they were muslims planning to blow up the
[1:02:57.760 --> 1:03:01.080]  federal building in miami and it turned out it was all staged and made up and
[1:03:01.080 --> 1:03:03.560]  the feds gave him hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:08.960]  uh... to just dress in military fatigues and bought a warehouse to live in and
[1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:11.600]  would only give them money when they would you know they say we'll give you
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:14.320]  another hundred thousand which you gotta go videotape the federal building
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:18.680]  they couldn't even get him to talk about attacking it
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:21.960]  or you know they deliver ammonium nitrate to some young muslims up in
[1:03:21.960 --> 1:03:23.440]  toronto
[1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:25.520]  we see these type of cases
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:28.200]  or they've had white supremacist at the denver
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:30.880]  dnc and then when
[1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:33.760]  in several other cases around the country will bomb was going to be speaking
[1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:34.800]  they catch some
[1:03:34.800 --> 1:03:38.520]  nineteen-year-old skinheads whacked out of their mind with swastikas all over
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:39.000]  them
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.640]  who were on their myspace or facebook with pictures of machine guns
[1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:45.920]  and who would just go you know get drunk in a trailer and shoot their mouths
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:46.640]  off about
[1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:51.880]  yeah we'll wear white top hats and drive in standing up at the top of monster
[1:03:51.880 --> 1:03:54.840]  trucks and will kill five thousand people and will
[1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:57.480]  will shoot missiles
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:01.640]  they go out and they find lunatics and then the fb i handles them and manages
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:04.760]  them and i'm sure right now they are planning this i'm not saying it's gonna
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:06.760]  happen but they've done it before so it could
[1:04:06.760 --> 1:04:08.880]  that the the the fb is probably
[1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:12.440]  we in every case it turns out the leader of the group is an fb i agent or
[1:04:12.440 --> 1:04:13.320]  informant
[1:04:13.320 --> 1:04:16.240]  they don't just infiltrate them they go out and set them up they got to find the
[1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:19.400]  mental patients they got to find the unstable people
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:22.200]  and then they bring them to the location
[1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:24.920]  and then they'll sting them and bust them in the nick of time and
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:27.560]  oh my god look they wanted to kill the new emperor
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.600]  no see it's good to have
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:33.560]  the twenty thousand troops in the regular army and the surveillance and
[1:04:33.560 --> 1:04:35.040]  all of it because
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:37.520]  they tried to stop the dream he
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:41.000]  you know they would have killed obama that he couldn't save the economy and
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:44.160]  we all be doomed if it wasn't for big government our new savior
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:47.040]  obama so all the police state is now legitimized and
[1:04:47.040 --> 1:04:48.880]  a good thing
[1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:52.400]  so if we do see something like that it'll come out a few weeks later
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:55.640]  that a fed founded the group led the group ran the group and they were all
[1:04:55.640 --> 1:04:57.120]  mental patients
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:59.800]  so i think there's a pretty good chance that something like that will probably
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:01.280]  be happen tomorrow and be foiled

[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:23.640]  sane insurance is knowledge of wild edible plants

[1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:16.800]  i will probably not doing an extended uh... broadcast tomorrow not just four
[1:08:16.800 --> 1:08:19.960]  hours might be five six hours long covering the coronation of our new
[1:08:19.960 --> 1:08:21.880]  supreme emperor
[1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:24.560]  brocco bomb of the first may he live
[1:08:24.560 --> 1:08:29.640]  forever all glorious leaders save us
[1:08:29.640 --> 1:08:32.320]  this will be hilarious if it wasn't so dangerous
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:35.880]  uh... but let's uh... go ahead and go back to your calls randy matt mark joe
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:39.200]  rachel and others randy in canada you're on the air
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:42.640]  on the eve of the coronation of the god emperor
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:47.640]  well i would like to uh... ask you to question separate questions but kinda
[1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:50.880]  kind of big question so i'll try to be quick
[1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.240]  the first being uh...
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:56.360]  since were part of a north american union the things that brocco bomb i will
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:58.040]  instill as in
[1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:02.720]  youth brigades and and military service and even marshal off
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:06.440]  without affect people as well as in canada with our government
[1:09:06.440 --> 1:09:08.320]  follow suit with him
[1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:12.400]  that's my first question is the same programs are being implemented
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:16.440]  uh... in canada and in england in many cases under the exact same names
[1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:19.720]  are similar names because obama isn't running anything
[1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:21.880]  the social engineers decades
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:27.320]  do go develop the very programs that were now being phased into right now
[1:09:27.320 --> 1:09:29.600]  okay now my second question is
[1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:30.800]  is uh... last
[1:09:30.800 --> 1:09:34.640]  are two weeks ago i heard you talking about uh... some of the ufo's and you
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:35.720]  said uh...
[1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:37.400]  there was um...
[1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:39.200]  uh... they were uh...
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:43.200]  balloons or whatever in the in the air i i forget exactly what what you said but
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:44.960]  but what i want to ask is
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:48.840]  could you give me a little history on operation that is a blue beam
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:53.560]  and would brocco bomb would be the person to instill that
[1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:57.680]  all right i appreciate your call me try to answer that question
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:02.160]  for the last two years the mainstream media has legitimized extraterrestrial
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:03.080]  life
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:07.520]  and is basically saying we are being visited something is going on
[1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:10.520]  and so that would hit to the public
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:14.840]  that the establishment is strongly considering
[1:10:14.840 --> 1:10:17.880]  implementing something along the lines of project blue beam
[1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:23.840]  which is a partially declassified uh... u.s. government plan
[1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:28.480]  to have uh... the staged alien extraterrestrial landings
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:31.200]  uh... as a pretext to unify the planet
[1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:36.000]  uh... around uh... the contact that would be a societal revolution it would
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:36.960]  destroy
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:40.120]  a lot of the people's basic faiths it would uh...
[1:10:40.120 --> 1:10:43.520]  it would be great to cause a major upheaval
[1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:46.160]  and then they've uh... talk to a lot of government documents about
[1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:48.600]  having it be a hostile threat
[1:10:48.600 --> 1:10:51.920]  uh... as a way to unify humanity and ronald reagan and many others in the
[1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:52.920]  gorbachev
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:55.120]  uh... have talked about that
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:10:57.760]  i don't get into a debate about whether in the hundreds of billions of
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:58.840]  galaxies
[1:10:58.840 --> 1:10:59.560]  that holds
[1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:01.440]  telescope itself is photographed
[1:11:01.440 --> 1:11:05.560]  with billions of planets uh... in in the solar systems that are in those
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:09.600]  galaxies that there isn't life in the universe i'm sure there is
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:14.760]  this just isn't a radio show we get into little green men in cuba coppers and
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:19.040]  yet he's an abominable snowman because you know that whole genre then
[1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:21.120]  basically mixes in
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:23.800]  and i'm not knocking those people that's interesting stuff people are into it
[1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:25.440]  you know
[1:11:25.440 --> 1:11:26.920]  that's their prerogative
[1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:30.360]  i just don't mix in speculative things
[1:11:30.360 --> 1:11:34.080]  uh... and
[1:11:34.080 --> 1:11:36.720]  you know the things that are sensational
[1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.600]  that aren't provable
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:44.600]  and so i never really weigh in on the subject the reason a few weeks ago i
[1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:46.120]  talked about
[1:11:46.120 --> 1:11:50.240]  high altitude homeland security blimps was because it has been in the news that
[1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:53.000]  they've put them over every major u.s. city
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:54.840]  they can watch
[1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:58.360]  thousands of square miles from ninety to a hundred and twenty thousand feet
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:02.000]  where they place them their unmanned they have face scanning technology they
[1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  have biometric scanning technology
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.720]  uh... heat resonance signature technology that can
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:11.000]  create a fingerprint on any individual car or any individual human
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:12.640]  just from the heat signature
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:16.600]  of your head from above or the shadow you cast on the way you walk they
[1:12:16.600 --> 1:12:20.080]  create a biometric algorithm key number
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:21.040]  with that
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:25.840]  that's the quote secret weapon that uh...
[1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:28.000]  bob woodward wrote about this latest book
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.200]  it's it's not so secret it's admitted that they have it
[1:12:31.200 --> 1:12:35.320]  and and darpa developed decades ago
[1:12:35.320 --> 1:12:37.720]  it's just now been implemented
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:42.080]  and so i don't watch a lot of tv but but but just in the last six months i've
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:45.960]  caught larry king live myself i think three times
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:49.880]  saying what are these giants to garshap craft over dallas
[1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:55.480]  uh... over to son arizona over los angeles uh... over
[1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:57.200]  salt lake city
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:13:00.600]  uh... over cities in canada and they'll show the video
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:02.640]  on a bc on cnn
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:04.640]  and it's a blimp
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:08.320]  it's at a hundred thousand feet it's got the four fins on the back it's got the
[1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:09.800]  camera pods
[1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:12.840]  uh... it's got the solar panels on the side the top
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:18.000]  uh... the uh... i mean it's it's like the good year blimp i mean it's a blimp
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  it's like saying what's that all that's a by plane will watch that that's a seven
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:22.160]  seven seven
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:27.880]  you know what's that uh... uh... that's a fire hydrant uh...
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:30.040]  it means a blimp there's no debating
[1:13:30.040 --> 1:13:33.320]  and then they get on the news and say the f a a won't say what it is and says
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:35.040]  they're not picking it up on radar
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:37.320]  and that it's not of human origin
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:41.420]  and because the f a a says so it must be aliens and uh...
[1:13:41.420 --> 1:13:45.200]  some say it's a blimp but their conspiracy theorist
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:47.160]  i mean they launched these blimps
[1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:50.720]  they announced six seven years ago just google homeland security blimp you'll
[1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:54.320]  see videos of them launching you'll see photos you'll read
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:55.760]  mainstream articles
[1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:59.080]  about how they launch them how they're above us so it's weird how they do these
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:02.680]  programs they announced their launching and they launch them they're there
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:06.800]  and then when the public season they say doesn't exist you're not seeing it or we
[1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:10.720]  don't know what it is we're launching f sixteen to check it out
[1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:13.360]  and it's a big silver blimp with four
[1:14:13.360 --> 1:14:17.560]  friends on the end of it and surveillance pods hanging off the belly of it
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:20.320]  and a five-year-old
[1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:23.240]  you know i was at home watching the video on youtube of an abc newscast

[1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:28.840]  he goes that's a blimp that's a blimp
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:34.920]  the blimpster need i saw a big blimp daddy ron paul had a blimp
[1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:39.360]  and i say thank you i even did the test my six-year-old
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:44.720]  knows what it is but adults go it's aliens it's it's just the public is so
[1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:49.440]  mindless so dumb down so incredibly just
[1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:51.920]  on their forget the white house press corps
[1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:53.800]  with the white house press secretary
[1:14:53.800 --> 1:14:57.160]  they were asking her a few months ago is it true the dollars been devalued is it
[1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:00.280]  true that's why things cost more is it true she said the white house will not
[1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:03.360]  tell you that i'd be fired if i told you
[1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:07.360]  and then they all went and she we don't know that's been devalued then as if
[1:15:07.360 --> 1:15:13.440]  they couldn't go look at the money index for that day the currency index
[1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:17.760]  i'll go back to your calls for runtime here we got a guest coming up

[1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:34.600]  in his true agenda
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:36.560]  but uh...
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:41.480]  i mean i'm not that smart folks my six-year-old knows it's a blimp

[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:46.080]  no it's a car shaped craft from planet
[1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:47.800]  snibble bob

[1:15:51.120 --> 1:15:55.280]  and then i'm the conspiracy theorist because i'm saying that's not aliens
[1:15:55.280 --> 1:16:00.040]  that's not an unidentified flying object that is a homeland security blimp
[1:16:00.040 --> 1:16:04.080]  here's the a bc news here's the cnn footage of it
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:07.840]  and we posted articles right next to five years ago six years ago on home
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:10.840]  and security announced it it's the same blimp
[1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:13.720]  the very same model
[1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:16.160]  a gigantic surveillance blimp
[1:16:16.160 --> 1:16:19.280]  i remember when alexander haig had a tv show
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:23.440]  before i even got on the air locally austin it was uh... on
[1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:27.440]  the county channel on cable for some reasons nationwide syndicated he did
[1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:34.040]  it for a few years and i remember alexander haig in nineteen ninety two
[1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:37.280]  in nineteen ninety two i was a senior in high school
[1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:40.880]  and i remember watching his hour-long daily news show that he was very
[1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:45.000]  interesting or he admitted that he is the majority owner in a company that
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.240]  was going to sell
[1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:50.440]  uh... to the federal government giant blimp's that were unmanned to surveil
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:54.040]  the american people much cheaper than satellites and that would be for our
[1:16:54.040 --> 1:16:56.080]  security against terrorist
[1:16:56.080 --> 1:16:58.360]  nineteen ninety two
[1:16:58.360 --> 1:16:59.960]  doesn't matter doesn't exist
[1:16:59.960 --> 1:17:03.360]  i went on man cal muller show last week i'm on there again tomorrow
[1:17:03.360 --> 1:17:05.920]  and i brought up the blimp's and he just heard laughing saying there's no
[1:17:05.920 --> 1:17:12.920]  such thing and i said just google homo security blimp said no
[1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:18.880]  let's just go to your phone calls
[1:17:18.880 --> 1:17:21.520]  matt no higher on the air

[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:36.440]  so apart where i believe it was uh... flight ninety three that supposedly
[1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:38.640]  crashed
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:39.240]  it was
[1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:42.120]  spotted leaning at the hopkins airport in cleveland
[1:17:42.120 --> 1:17:44.720]  yes in this in the passengers were
[1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.960]  uh... escorted to an abandoned nasa building
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:50.640]  never to be seen again
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:51.840]  astounding
[1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:54.400]  which is exactly that was on the local news
[1:17:54.400 --> 1:17:57.840]  and that is multiple news outlets tv and radio reported it
[1:17:57.840 --> 1:18:01.480]  and that's exactly what's in the operation northwood's
[1:18:01.480 --> 1:18:06.120]  headline a bc news u s government plan to attack u s cities is pretext for war
[1:18:06.120 --> 1:18:08.720]  and that was of course with cuba but they didn't do the plan
[1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:10.920]  and they said will have drones takeoff
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:14.080]  have other people highly publicized get on planes
[1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:17.360]  uh... who are who are ready to be sheep dip go deep cover for the stage their
[1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:18.320]  deaths
[1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:22.000]  and will have them get on the plane stage their deaths in the drones will go
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.960]  in and hit the targets
[1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:28.480]  it's just absolutely astounding to me now
[1:18:28.480 --> 1:18:30.240]  and people just
[1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:32.480]  how do people not believe this stuff i mean
[1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:35.600]  you know i've talked to hundreds of people family friends co-workers
[1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:37.600]  neighbors you name it you know in
[1:18:37.600 --> 1:18:40.720]  ninety nine percent of which are not receptive to what's going on here you
[1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:41.800]  know
[1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:45.160]  how do i enlighten them about what is really going on without convincing
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:48.240]  them that i'm an absolute lunatic i mean i have found it's not
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:51.680]  as effective just to talk to somebody it's better to give them an end game
[1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:53.520]  or lose change final cut
[1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:56.640]  a copy of the copies of my films get them out to folks
[1:18:56.640 --> 1:18:57.880]  uh... and just
[1:18:57.880 --> 1:19:00.680]  say hey this is some really interesting stuff watch this
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:02.920]  tell me what you think of it
[1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:06.360]  but you know it may be the group the area you're in the demographic
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:09.280]  or people that know you statistically salesman will tell you it's harder to
[1:19:09.280 --> 1:19:11.440]  sell somebody you know that somebody you don't know
[1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:13.040]  they have preconceived notions
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:16.200]  but i think you're trying to active of the average person in the west thinks
[1:19:16.200 --> 1:19:19.280]  someone warning them about something is showing off
[1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:22.720]  uh... i mean i mean if you know state capitals and basic political facts are
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:26.040]  a bill number people look at you like you know bill numbers well
[1:19:26.040 --> 1:19:28.360]  there's a kind of crazy person you
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:29.840]  uh... you know
[1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:34.920]  uh... he thinks there's blips but they're aliens i believe they're aliens but blips
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:36.200]  you're crazy
[1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:39.440]  i believe little green man before i believe blippers
[1:19:39.440 --> 1:19:40.400]  so
[1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:44.320]  the most effective thing to do is to give them a video
[1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:45.600]  or a book
[1:19:45.600 --> 1:19:49.480]  most people don't read so video is the mode or send them a link
[1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:53.680]  to a video does that answer your question

[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:24.520]  air hello yes welcome thank you for taking my call I was a bit of a
[1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:29.400]  skeptic years ago I'm trying to piece it together over the web because you know
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:33.560]  it's almost perfect information out there I just want to ask you a question a
[1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:38.800]  couple of questions really Mike digress here in Tel Aviv there's a these really
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:43.440]  supreme court are you aware of that with giant all-seeing eyes the Horace
[1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:48.520]  satanic ruins all over it that's right and a huge plaque saying that Lord
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:53.680]  Rothschild paid for it all that's right on the internet there's a commission by
[1:25:53.680 --> 1:25:58.400]  Lord Rothschild obviously a part of the Illumina what's not on the internet I
[1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:02.000]  mean it's not just photographs and news articles alternative mainstream news
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:08.800]  says that right right I just try a piece together obviously this world the world
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:13.760]  order in my there's also an eventual focus a goal it's so likely yeah let me
[1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:16.120]  tell you the goal let me tell you the goal then you can ask your question but
[1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:21.320]  I know what it's going to be what is the ultimate expression of a vicious
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:25.280]  control freak why does a serial killer love to grab a three-year-old child off
[1:26:25.280 --> 1:26:27.680]  the street and rip him and torture him for three months and then kill him
[1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:31.920]  because they love the power of the poor helpless child screaming and begging and
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:36.880]  pain that's the ultimate expression of a control freak now wicked control freaks
[1:26:36.880 --> 1:26:41.640]  are in control they are very capable professional psychopaths not your low
[1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:47.480]  level street type and they are setting up world government to kill 90% of us
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:51.880]  their official documents say 80 now they're moving into 90% and now the
[1:26:51.880 --> 1:26:56.040]  latest info coming out of every major biology department every major eugenics
[1:26:56.040 --> 1:27:01.760]  department of every major college is that they want to kill 99% now again
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:05.360]  they didn't want to say everybody at first because that would scare their
[1:27:05.360 --> 1:27:09.360]  minions who were because who believed they're going to go into the future now
[1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:14.160]  a minority but an elite minority say the goal is total human extermination
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:22.160]  including themselves the greatest control freak action is to it is is to
[1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:26.640]  just is to kill everyone go ahead but I would just look at it in terms of
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:30.480]  respect on the web it says basically you're still a Christian background is
[1:27:30.480 --> 1:27:35.600]  that right all the Christian background is that correct yes but don't associate
[1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:39.960]  that with Pat Robertson no no no I'm just saying traditional Christian values
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:44.600]  kind of thing yeah well traditional Christianity is not real Christianity
[1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:48.520]  that's that's a tradition of the last 200 years manufactured lay down to
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:51.920]  corruption it's the end of the world don't fight evil it's not your job to
[1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:59.440]  fight evil so so so I am not that type of Christian I am somebody who burns like
[1:27:59.440 --> 1:28:04.280]  Ezekiel said it's burning in my bones that's why I can hardly even focus when
[1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:08.360]  I'm on here I'm just burning look I know all over Austin where I live they're
[1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:11.680]  grabbing old people stealing their houses and euthanizing them it's in the
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.880]  news they're doing it and no one stopping them I know where I live that

[1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:26.640]  sports betting where they fight with weapons and no one's going to stop them
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:29.960]  they're going to continue doing it and it's admitted I mean I know they're
[1:28:29.960 --> 1:28:34.120]  putting cancer viruses in the vaccines I know Bayer on purpose shipped out over

[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:00.760]  what I'm saying is going back to this building Tel Aviv right basically this
[1:29:00.760 --> 1:29:05.720]  is what I started to believe in this whole concept of it etc about a folk
[1:29:05.720 --> 1:29:11.000]  there has to be an ultimate focus goal and with this it's a satanic nature of
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:16.800]  of the United States basically I'm from Muslim background right and what the
[1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:22.080]  Quran says right is Qiyamat which is end of days yeah same revelation same in
[1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:26.960]  most religions but what it says the Antichrist will appear between Syria and
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:33.880]  Iraq somewhere in Palestine so my idea has to be my idea has to be based on the

[1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:54.880]  only for eight years is considered to have and it just goes on to talk about
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:34:01.120]  the work that he does he is the Bishop of Jerusalem very very prominent a
[1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:04.440]  religious leader there and he can give us a perspective from there on the
[1:34:04.440 --> 1:34:09.280]  ground with what's really happening in Gaza and so it's good to have you here

[1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:04.000]  about this over the weekend UK Jewish lawmaker Israel forces acting like Nazis
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:07.840]  Israeli military action in Gaza is comparable to that of German soldiers
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.240]  during the Holocaust a German UK lawmaker whose family suffered at the hands of
[1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:17.000]  the Nazis is saying and that's a Gerald Kaufman remember the UK's ruling
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:21.960]  Labor Party very prominent also called for an arms embargo on Israel so with
[1:35:21.960 --> 1:35:25.240]  this unique perspective let's go ahead and play that and then we'll go back to
[1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:34.280]  your phone calls here we go madam Deputy Speaker I was brought up as an
[1:35:34.280 --> 1:35:40.800]  Orthodox Jew and a Zionist on a shelf in our kitchen was a tin box of the Jewish
[1:35:40.800 --> 1:35:47.000]  National Fund into which we put coins to help the pioneers building the Jewish
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:52.880]  presence in Palestine I first went to Israel in 1961 and I've been there
[1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:58.720]  since more times than I can count I had family in Israel and I have friends in
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:36:07.560]  Israel one of them fought in the wars of 1956 1967 and 1973 and was wounded in
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:12.480]  two of them the tight clip which I'm wearing is made from a campaign
[1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:18.320]  decoration awarded to him which he presented to me I've known most of the
[1:36:18.320 --> 1:36:22.960]  Prime Ministers of Israel starting with the founding Prime Minister David
[1:36:22.960 --> 1:36:29.320]  Ben-Gurion Golda Meir was my friend so was he go along the Deputy Prime
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:35.080]  Minister who was a general won the Negev for Israel in the 1948 War of
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:41.680]  Independence my parents came to Britain as refugees from Poland most of their
[1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:47.440]  families were subsequently murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust my
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:53.800]  grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her hometown of Stashof a
[1:36:53.800 --> 1:37:01.040]  German soldier shot her dead in her bed madam Deputy Speaker my grandmother
[1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:06.560]  did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian
[1:37:06.560 --> 1:37:13.000]  grandmothers in Gaza the present Israeli government ruthlessly and cynically
[1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:18.440]  exploit the continuing guilt among Gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in
[1:37:18.440 --> 1:37:24.880]  the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palatine Palestinians the
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:29.080]  implication is that Jewish lives are precious but the lives of Palestinians
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:35.840]  do not count on Sky News a few days ago the spokeswoman for the Israeli Army
[1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:41.120]  Major Lieberwitz was asked about the Israeli killing of at that time 800
[1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:47.960]  Palestinians the total is now a thousand she replied instantly five of them were
[1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:53.960]  militant 500 of them were militants that was the reply of the Nazi I suppose
[1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:57.880]  that Jews fighting for their lives in the Warsaw ghetto could have been
[1:37:57.880 --> 1:38:03.600]  dismissed as militants the Israeli Foreign Minister Cipri Livni asserts
[1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:06.840]  that her government will have no dealings with Hamas because they're
[1:38:06.840 --> 1:38:13.560]  terrorists Cipri Livni's father was Eitan Livni chief operations officer of the
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:18.920]  terrorist Egon spy Leumi who organized the blowing up of the King David Hotel
[1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:25.800]  in Jerusalem in which 91 victims were killed including four Jews Israel was
[1:38:25.800 --> 1:38:31.520]  born out of Jewish terrorism Jewish terrorists hanged two British
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:36.720]  sergeants and booby-trapped their corpses Egon together with the terrorist
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:45.760]  Stern gang massacred 254 Palestinians in 1948 in the village of De Yassin today
[1:38:45.760 --> 1:38:49.160]  the present Israeli government indicate that they will be willing in
[1:38:49.160 --> 1:38:53.960]  sterk at circumstances acceptable to them to negotiate with a Palestinian
[1:38:53.960 --> 1:39:00.240]  president Abbas of Fatah it's too late for that madam Deputy Speaker they
[1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:04.600]  could have negotiated with Fatah's previous leader Yasser Arafat who was a
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:10.920]  friend of mine instead they besieged him in a bunker in Ramallah where I visited
[1:39:10.920 --> 1:39:17.160]  him it's because of the failings of Fatah since Arafat's death that Hamas won
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:24.120]  the election the Palestinian election in 2006 Hamas is a deeply nasty
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:31.520]  organization but it was democratically elected and it is the only game in town
[1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:37.160]  the boycotting of Hamas including by our own government has been a culpable
[1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:43.520]  error from which dreadful consequences have followed the great Israeli foreign
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:49.000]  minister Abba ebbon with whom I campaign for peace on many platforms said you
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:54.160]  make peace by talking to your enemies however many many Palestinians the
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:59.320]  Israelis murder in Gaza they cannot solve this existential problem by
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:05.440]  military means whenever and however the fighting ends there will still be one
[1:40:05.440 --> 1:40:10.280]  and a half million Palestinians in Gaza and two and a half million more
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:15.560]  Palestinians in the West Bank who are treated like dirt by the Israelis with
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:20.040]  hundreds of roadblocks and with the ghastly denizens of the illegal Jewish
[1:40:20.040 --> 1:40:25.080]  settlements harassing them as well the time will come not so long from now
[1:40:25.080 --> 1:40:30.680]  when they will outnumber the Jewish population in Israel it's time for our
[1:40:30.680 --> 1:40:35.920]  government to make clear to the Israeli government that its conduct and policies
[1:40:35.920 --> 1:40:43.040]  are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on Israel it is time for peace
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:49.120]  but real peace not the solution by conquest which is the Israelis real
[1:40:49.120 --> 1:40:54.360]  gold but which is impossible for them to achieve they're not simply war criminals
[1:40:54.360 --> 1:40:59.640]  that fools all right later we'll open the phones up and get your take on that
[1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:06.200]  perspective from a Holocaust victim but I apologize to the bishop for our phone
[1:41:06.200 --> 1:41:12.600]  issues connecting into Jerusalem in Israel but we do now have him and his
[1:41:12.600 --> 1:41:17.840]  name is a Ria Hanna Abu al-Assal and we appreciate you coming on the show
[1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:23.840]  Bishop of the Anglican church there thank you thank you okay you've got the floor
[1:41:23.840 --> 1:41:28.120]  in a limited time we have tell us what's really happening in Gaza right now
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:34.520]  sir well the shooting seemed to have stopped this kind of stuff but in my
[1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:40.720]  opinion the war is still on and as long as the root cause of all this conflict
[1:41:40.720 --> 1:41:49.720]  is not dealt with properly justly objectively compassionately I fear that
[1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:57.840]  the next round or the next round will be far more bloody and far more deadly the
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:05.440]  situation in Gaza is very very tragic hundreds of homes have been bulldozed
[1:42:05.440 --> 1:42:12.400]  completely level to the ground often on top of the residents in them the number
[1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:20.680]  of people killed exceeded 1,300 most of those are children women and of the
[1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:30.240]  Egypt and of the injured body and soul certainly the number is 5,400 many of
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:36.560]  them they say about 400 are very in very serious injuries and some of them will
[1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:41.320]  continue to be handicapped for the rest of their lives if they if they survive
[1:42:41.320 --> 1:42:49.560]  the situation demands the attention of the whole world to put an end to this
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:57.360]  pain to this death to this killing to this fear less less the whole Middle
[1:42:57.360 --> 1:43:02.760]  East perhaps even beyond the Middle East will be drawn into a war which nobody
[1:43:02.760 --> 1:43:08.880]  would benefit from the Israelis in my opinion and the opinion of many among
[1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:14.960]  them are also Israelis on on the left have said that the war accomplished
[1:43:14.960 --> 1:43:23.400]  very little if any if any the goals have not been achieved except for the
[1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:30.080]  fact that they managed not only to kill so many and through in so many homes but
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:40.040]  also them they have become expert the Israeli establishment in in in a kind
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:46.640]  of destroying their reputation in many parts of the world among those
[1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:51.080]  communities in the world the Americans the British the French the Spanish the
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:57.880]  Germans the demonstration they did draw hundreds of thousands in fact millions
[1:43:57.880 --> 1:44:03.400]  around the world in support of the people of Gaza in support of Gaza being
[1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:11.240]  free in support of gathering free separately from from the siege that was
[1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:18.520]  and that the Palestinians are equal human beings entitled to human rights
[1:44:18.520 --> 1:44:24.880]  entitled to national rights entitled to self-determination entitled to an
[1:44:24.880 --> 1:44:29.600]  independent Palestinian state on Palestinian soil side-by-side with
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:34.600]  Israel in accordance with the United Nations resolution so specifically
[1:44:34.600 --> 1:44:41.800]  coming the different summit that happened I mean I for when and I believe I
[1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:47.880]  speak on behalf of many I mean why would the European leader whether they came
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:54.320]  from France England from Spain Italy from Czechoslovakia or from from it
[1:44:54.320 --> 1:45:02.200]  from wherever they came from why would the wait until 1,300 people are killed
[1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:07.440]  why would they allow themselves to continue to witness the killing of
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:13.440]  children and women rather than come the second time of the of the of the of the
[1:45:13.440 --> 1:45:21.600]  day when when the war began on the 27th of of December 2000 and it's it's it's
[1:45:21.600 --> 1:45:27.000]  heartbreaking I as a human being not only as a Christian but as a human being
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:34.240]  having seen the the the the the number of children killed and I have four
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:43.400]  grandchildren I honestly I tried to cry but I could not I was I was so angry
[1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:49.440]  as it were so angry that the world continued to be completely indifferent
[1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:54.200]  and it reminded me and I have written to friends here and there it reminded me
[1:45:54.200 --> 1:45:59.600]  of the day even when Jesus Christ was crucified that some people came from
[1:45:59.600 --> 1:46:05.120]  Galilee and they stood afar watching how long how long will the
[1:46:05.120 --> 1:46:10.600]  international community continue to stand afar and continue to watch people
[1:46:10.600 --> 1:46:15.880]  being oppressed people being humiliated people being killed people being
[1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:24.480]  occupied we need to find the way out of this mess before before I for I fear
[1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:29.880]  that sir sir which of the listeners we're talking to the main Anglican
[1:46:29.880 --> 1:46:36.480]  bishop in Jerusalem of the Anglican church there and Bishop Rhea Abu El
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:42.000]  Assal in the time we have in this segment the next specifically for those
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:47.080]  that don't know Jews Arabs you know Palestinians and Christians did live
[1:46:47.080 --> 1:46:51.560]  in peace together you know for the for hundreds and hundreds of years if not
[1:46:51.560 --> 1:46:58.480]  thousands what changed in the 1940s what changed in 1947 because I don't think
[1:46:58.480 --> 1:47:02.080]  people understand that that now the Palestinians have been driven millions
[1:47:02.080 --> 1:47:07.480]  of them what almost four million into two tiny areas and are under siege and
[1:47:07.480 --> 1:47:11.400]  that Israel broke the ceasefire by bombing and killing people and by
[1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:16.480]  cutting off the entrances into Israel and other areas that were part of the
[1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:19.640]  agreement I'm certainly not that you know defending things that Hamas is
[1:47:19.640 --> 1:47:23.280]  doing with these rockets but the point is what are what are they supposed to do
[1:47:23.280 --> 1:47:28.400]  in the face of being under under total siege so can you briefly speak to the
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:32.600]  history of what's been happening there in Israel and why things changed
[1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:38.000]  Arabs and Jews have lived for centuries side by side and they have lived in
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:43.760]  peace and in harmony Christians Muslims and Jews have lived in the land people
[1:47:43.760 --> 1:47:50.600]  called the holy land to which I refer as the land of the holy one side by side
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:58.720]  for 1400 years some people in fact people of that church of the Anglican
[1:47:58.720 --> 1:48:05.560]  church in the UK in the 19th century started speaking of the end of time and
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:12.880]  of its catalogi and that we are drawing my to the end of time and that the Jews
[1:48:12.880 --> 1:48:18.640]  will come back to the so-called promised land and they started speaking of
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:23.960]  Palestine as a land without people why not give it to a people without the land
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:32.360]  then came the first world war and the bell for declaration in 1923 which
[1:48:32.360 --> 1:48:39.200]  promised the Jewish community a state or a home in in Palestine and after which
[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:44.760]  the first world war during the second world war the Jewish community suffered
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:49.600]  at the hands of the Nadvis not at the hands of the Arabs not at the hands of
[1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:54.720]  the Arab Christian not at the hands of the Muslim the Palestinians or the
[1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:59.400]  Muslim Arab in the Middle East they suffered at the hands of the Europeans
[1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:04.920]  especially the Nadvis and the number of them have been killed but some of them
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:10.960]  managed to survive and escape and they found refuge in what was
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:17.280]  Mandir Palestine they were welcomed by our people until the day when they
[1:49:17.280 --> 1:49:22.840]  started talking about wanting a state of their own rather than continue to live
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:29.800]  side by side they raised the issue of a Jewish state in Palestine the United
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:35.960]  Nation sent a commission and that commission partitioned the land on the
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:44.320]  29th of November 1947 in my opinion that was the first separation war that the
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:49.880]  international community built between the Arabs and the Jews between the
[1:49:49.880 --> 1:49:54.400]  Palestinians and the Israelis between the Jews and the Muslim between the Jews
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:49:59.440]  and the Christian the partition plan gave the Jewish community which was a
[1:49:59.440 --> 1:50:05.360]  minority of some 600,000 people who arrived from Europe especially from
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:13.920]  East Europe they gave them 52% of the territory of Palestine and 48% to 1.2
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:20.600]  million Palestinians the Palestinians of all the those engaged in the
[1:50:20.600 --> 1:50:26.960]  negotiation resorted to the wisdom of Solomon the two women who claim the
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:32.440]  same baby the real mom said I will not allow you to cut the baby into two
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:39.160]  whereas the other woman did never mind cut him and Solomon who happened to be
[1:50:39.160 --> 1:50:45.280]  a Jew woke up to the reality that that was the real mama and mama and he gave
[1:50:45.280 --> 1:50:50.560]  the child to the real mom without partitioning God forbid the baby
[1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:54.000]  Bishop stay there we've got to break we're gonna come right back to you after

[1:52:11.680 --> 1:52:16.440]  a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:24.480]  tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:29.640]  was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as

[1:53:03.640 --> 1:53:08.160]  decision on what to cut back on and what's essential as we prepare for an
[1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:12.200]  uncertain future in these troubled times one of the most important things your

[1:54:13.680 --> 1:54:20.480]  then we immediately start going live at PrisonPlanet.tv simulcasting the
[1:54:20.480 --> 1:54:25.680]  radio show via PrisonPlanet.tv for all the members over there. We will go
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:28.880]  directly to all of your phone calls that are patiently holding Mark and Oregon,

[1:54:36.200 --> 1:54:43.440]  patiently holding. Okay you know the issue here and we're talking to the
[1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:50.160]  Anglican bishop of Jerusalem a very important position for Christians over
[1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:56.320]  there especially Christian Palestinians Rihanna Abu El-Assal the bishop. We're
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:55:00.280]  going over what really happened over there and of course the people in Israel
[1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:05.200]  they staged terror attacks they killed people in mass they started the the
[1:55:05.200 --> 1:55:10.480]  bombings of hotels and marketplaces the machine gunning of the Palestinians
[1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:17.080]  Christians and others to drive them out it's just amazing that all this went on
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:20.320]  and this is just the facts and then I watch the news and they say there's no
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:23.880]  such thing as a Palestinian the Arabs were there trying to steal the land and
[1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:27.720]  Israel's fighting them off and then Israel admits in their papers that they
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:33.240]  staged terror attacks sometimes as a pretext to kill peace processes and that
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:38.320]  Israel has admitted in their newspapers that they want to drive the Palestinians
[1:55:38.320 --> 1:55:42.280]  out of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the close to four million people that
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:47.720]  are there. It will be technical three and a half million and this is what is
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:51.480]  ongoing and happening and then the public just isn't aware of this sir please
[1:55:51.480 --> 1:55:57.520]  continue you've gotten up to the analogy of Solomon. Yeah the partition plan was
[1:55:57.520 --> 1:56:03.480]  rejected by the Palestinian community and the first round of hostilities began
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:08.160]  the result of which the either the expelling of the majority of the
[1:56:08.160 --> 1:56:14.720]  Palestinians or those who chose to leave believing that they will leave for a few
[1:56:14.720 --> 1:56:20.080]  days a week or two they didn't carry with them anything and they form now the
[1:56:20.080 --> 1:56:26.400]  bulk of the largest bulk of refugees in the Middle East the number is close to
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:31.920]  five million Palestinians who continue to look to the day when they will be
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:37.880]  allowed to come back home very much the same like any other refugee here or
[1:56:37.880 --> 1:56:46.000]  there in the world. There were a number of wars 48, 56, 67, 670
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:53.840]  Israelis managed to occupy the rest of Palestine and then 73 and again we had
[1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:58.520]  of the peace treaty with Egypt we had the peace treaty of Israel with Jordan
[1:56:58.520 --> 1:57:04.360]  and certainly with the Palestinian Authority to also accord but the
[1:57:04.360 --> 1:57:11.960]  conflict continues on because the root cause has not been dealt with properly
[1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:17.880]  neither the peace treaty with Egypt nor the peace treaty with Jordan will bring
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:24.560]  peace and security for Israel. The only way forward is for Israel to sit down
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:32.640]  and settle have a fair settlement which is in accordance with the United
[1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:36.680]  Nations resolution whereby the Palestinians will have their share of
[1:57:36.680 --> 1:57:42.200]  the land live free in an independent Palestinian state as I said side by
[1:57:42.200 --> 1:57:50.120]  side I have proposed in 84 in 84 I was still a priest in Nazareth I proposed
[1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:55.320]  that if the Palestinians are given the opportunity to have their independent
[1:57:55.320 --> 1:58:02.800]  state side by side with Israel in my opinion they will come soon when there
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:09.040]  will be either a federation or confederation between the two states which
[1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:16.360]  will serve as a blessing unto the nation of the Middle East if lost unto the
[1:58:16.360 --> 1:58:20.320]  whole world and that's what I said to Tony Blair when I met with him before the
[1:58:20.320 --> 1:58:26.240]  war on Iraq on the 18th of February when he tried to tell us that going to war
[1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:31.720]  against Iraq will pave the way for peace in the Middle East I said there's the
[1:58:31.720 --> 1:58:37.040]  shortest way to make that goes through Jerusalem stay there we're gonna come
[1:58:37.040 --> 1:58:46.600]  back in one minute sir of the final segment you are listening to GCN visit

[2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:31.160]  phone calls directly when we enter in to that segment but about five minutes left
[2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:39.760]  with the bishop of Jerusalem the england can bishop and sir I just have one
[2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:42.480]  question for you but it's a complex issue but I know you deal with it every
[2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:48.240]  day you know I am a Christian and I love everybody and I hate seeing everybody
[2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:52.040]  be played against each other just so arms dealers can continue their war over
[2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:57.840]  there I know that the state over there is completely secular the Zionist state
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:02.040]  does not allow Christians to proselytize over there there's a lot of
[2:01:02.040 --> 2:01:07.200]  restrictions it is an apartheid state in so many ways but then American
[2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:11.440]  Christians evangelicals have been taught but they have to support Israel no
[2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:17.680]  matter what Israel does and that anybody that isn't for the state of Israel as it
[2:01:17.680 --> 2:01:24.600]  is now is for the antichrist but my Bible revelations Daniel's Ezekiel it
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:28.640]  states that the antichrist will show up and set up a state there and claim that
[2:01:28.640 --> 2:01:32.720]  he's Jesus but then I see the Christian church is saying we've got to have
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:36.360]  Israel be one group and we're gonna have our leader appear there that sounds like
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:39.080]  they're gonna be rooting for the antichrist I mean when we know when God
[2:01:39.080 --> 2:01:42.960]  just said you're not gonna when Jesus said no stone will be unturned and Titus
[2:01:42.960 --> 2:01:48.840]  came and sacked Jerusalem 70 years later and not one stone was you know
[2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:54.280]  left standing on top of the other and then in Israel went into bondage for
[2:01:54.280 --> 2:01:57.280]  for not accepting the Messiah and I mean that's the Christian view whether
[2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:01.920]  you're secular or not that's the view so then if it's an abomination then for
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:07.680]  anything before God returns to be set up in Israel so and this wasn't set up
[2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:11.840]  until 200 years ago when this was financed in the United States in England
[2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:15.360]  to put out this false message and of course the Rothschilds financed it in
[2:02:15.360 --> 2:02:20.360]  the three minutes we've got left can you speak to that yeah in my opinion me and
[2:02:20.360 --> 2:02:28.040]  those who continue to support Israel in its policy we the Arab Palestinians in
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:34.640]  particular and the Arab nation applaud are causing greater harm to Jews and to
[2:02:34.640 --> 2:02:41.120]  the Jewish faith than what the others have done any harm to Israel or to Jews
[2:02:41.120 --> 2:02:47.000]  or to the Jewish faith for people to continue to justify the killing because
[2:02:47.000 --> 2:02:55.000]  God ordered or God favored or God promised in my opinion is anything but
[2:02:55.000 --> 2:03:00.400]  Christian I don't want to be very naughty and say that some Christians are
[2:03:00.400 --> 2:03:07.640]  Christ's Christian they care more about about a rather than about b whereas
[2:03:07.640 --> 2:03:12.280]  Jesus Christ said go on to the whole world on to the whole world the whole
[2:03:12.280 --> 2:03:15.960]  world is not only of the Jewish community the whole world is made up of
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:21.200]  all sorts of people and we are called to bring those people to faith in Christ
[2:03:21.200 --> 2:03:28.040]  who is the Prince of Peace and who taught us and ordered us and challenged us to
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:33.480]  reconcile those who are in conflict that's my point is that you are aware
[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:39.040]  though that that a bastardization of Christianity is being used to make the
[2:03:39.040 --> 2:03:44.080]  new religion the worship of Israel and that makes way for the antichrist but
[2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:48.720]  much much harm has been done in the name of religion much harm much killing has
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:52.720]  been done in the name of religion people have got sick of this kind of religion
[2:03:52.720 --> 2:04:01.720]  and before I close I want to take this opportunity I hope that the future
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:07.080]  president of the United States Barack Obama will will see to it that peace
[2:04:07.080 --> 2:04:12.360]  who comes to Jerusalem on the basis of truth and justice and I hope that
[2:04:12.360 --> 2:04:18.000]  tomorrow whoever is gonna lead the prayer will bring also in the prayer the
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  pain and the suffering of the Palestinian people especially in Gaza

[2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:36.560]  calls for the entirety of the shower because if I get into any news I will
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:39.320]  get sidetracked and won't take a lot of your phone calls I'm going directly to
[2:08:39.320 --> 2:08:45.800]  your calls right now at 1-800-259-9231 then after I do that I'm going to
[2:08:45.800 --> 2:08:50.800]  break down the psychology of Barack Obama and the media literally saying he is
[2:08:50.800 --> 2:08:54.400]  the one he is the savior he will fix everything so they can sell the public
[2:08:54.400 --> 2:08:59.360]  on signing on to that bandwagon to fully abolish the bill of rights and
[2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:04.880]  constitution and bring in carbon taxes youth brigades all of it and the new
[2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:07.800]  bank of the united states are talking about setting up there will be another
[2:09:07.800 --> 2:09:13.440]  private central bank just incredible things all coming down at once right
[2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:17.680]  now normally we wouldn't see the amount of changes for the worse towards the
[2:09:17.680 --> 2:09:21.840]  world government in 10 years that we're seeing in a week or two everything is
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:29.280]  is accelerated right now everything is is is hyper it's a quickening at every
[2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:34.560]  level so I'm going over that a lot of other financial news also a and e has a
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:39.240]  new drama TV show where 9-11 truthers are terrorist who want to kill us troops
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:42.600]  and they're also marijuana heads of the messages if you smoke marijuana you're a
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:45.520]  terrorist or not a little bit truth you're a terrorist I want to go over
[2:09:45.520 --> 2:09:49.320]  that and play a video clip from that as well and that ties into the violent
[2:09:49.320 --> 2:09:53.320]  radicalization act that we see being implemented where they're saying that
[2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:57.080]  they're going to go after you if you stand up and speak out and expose what
[2:09:57.080 --> 2:10:00.840]  they're doing so asinine to claim that 9-11 truth that exposes government
[2:10:00.840 --> 2:10:04.960]  sponsored terror would be staging terror there's no evidence of that but we saw
[2:10:04.960 --> 2:10:11.360]  this talking point start about two years ago then we saw a small flash bang type
[2:10:11.360 --> 2:10:15.320]  bombing that busted a window at the joint armed forces recruiting station in
[2:10:15.320 --> 2:10:19.200]  Times Square then mainstream news simultaneously with no evidence said
[2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:25.080]  it's probably a 9-11 truth or we then saw Bill O'Reilly we saw Glenn Beck we
[2:10:25.080 --> 2:10:29.840]  saw all the major channels in unison say 9-11 truthers need to be arrested and
[2:10:29.840 --> 2:10:35.360]  quote tortured and taken to Guantanamo Bay and tasered now that is in my film
[2:10:35.360 --> 2:10:39.040]  by the way truth rising we show that that's why that's and then the New York
[2:10:39.040 --> 2:10:44.240]  police come up and say your cameras are guns and your backpack is a bomb and they
[2:10:44.240 --> 2:10:47.840]  say we know it's not a gun we know it's not a bomb we're gonna frame you on
[2:10:47.840 --> 2:10:54.320]  camera I mean that is corruption when on camera they do this so they wouldn't be
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:57.880]  doing that if 9-11 truth wasn't such a threat and such a danger to them so all
[2:10:57.880 --> 2:11:01.760]  of you out there the millions of you spreading the word I commend you so
[2:11:01.760 --> 2:11:05.600]  that is coming up later in the show also I want to get more into all over the
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:09.400]  United States England and Europe the government is kicking old people out
[2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:13.160]  of their houses and the very bureaucrats that that kick them out of their houses
[2:11:13.160 --> 2:11:18.120]  and make them go to nursing homes or send them to the euthanasia centers the
[2:11:18.120 --> 2:11:22.000]  government hospice facilities missing all hospice but the main ones are eugenics
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:26.480]  and are euthanizing people with morphine basically and not feeding them in the
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:29.160]  Wall Street journals even covered that this is out of the globe and male
[2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:33.280]  counsel official evicted elderly tenants from bungalows then moved herself in
[2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:37.280]  then it goes on to say a bunch of them are doing this this is the type of stuff
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:43.280]  that we're dealing with here this disgusting the piece of human detritus
[2:11:43.280 --> 2:11:47.640]  right here on prison planet on TV we're showing a photo of her on the front
[2:11:47.640 --> 2:11:52.200]  page of the newspaper there also gender-bending chemicals in our rivers
[2:11:52.200 --> 2:11:56.000]  grow more potent this is a real environmental crises but
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.920]  Barack Obama is anything about that they're gonna think about that in England
[2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:05.280]  either this is again about taxing the carbon cycle of life itself to regulate
[2:12:05.280 --> 2:12:12.720]  all human activity to micromanage our lives so I'm gonna go ahead now and I am
[2:12:12.720 --> 2:12:21.480]  going to go to your phone calls oh I just got hot news in from Curt Nimo this
[2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:25.120]  is absolutely incredible Barack Obama has told you to do a lot of things that
[2:12:25.120 --> 2:12:28.760]  are unpopular as soon as he gets in the first hundred days probably was right
[2:12:28.760 --> 2:12:32.960]  six months ago that was going to be even before he got elected a blitzkrieg when
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:35.720]  he first came in that's why the media is hyping him up building him up as the
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:41.680]  savior now so everybody'll sign on and go along with it oh my gosh Curt Nimo's
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:45.720]  got a story here House considers repealing 22nd amendment at Obama's
[2:12:45.720 --> 2:12:54.560]  request and that would allow of course a foreigner to be president and so many
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.600]  other things so we're gonna be going over all of that today and there's a
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:02.680]  bunch of new anti-second amendment bills being introduced in the House I mean
[2:13:02.680 --> 2:13:08.440]  they're coming folks the it's on it's on Barack Obama when he was a state
[2:13:08.440 --> 2:13:13.680]  senator and a federal senator called for total gun bans and even wrote the
[2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:17.880]  bills with hand notes on them and has said he believes it's reasonable what
[2:13:17.880 --> 2:13:23.320]  Chicago and DC have which is a total gun man of the people a monopoly of force
[2:13:23.320 --> 2:13:26.360]  by the state so I mean I've been hit from all sides there's so much is
[2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:33.640]  happening let's go to your phone calls as promised here we pull up my caller
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:39.480]  screen here let's go ahead and go back because he was waiting last hour and he
[2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:42.360]  had a question I had to cut him off because the guests came up Joe in the
[2:13:42.360 --> 2:13:50.040]  UK than Mordecai Mark Mr. X Stan and others okay Joe in the UK go ahead and
[2:13:50.040 --> 2:13:57.600]  ask your question again yeah please basically as I was saying in view of
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:02.360]  the human arts in a new world order I believe they go ultimately because the
[2:14:02.360 --> 2:14:08.040]  minority as I understand it based on satanic and occult rituals and part of
[2:14:08.040 --> 2:14:13.680]  that whole whole affair is I believe they're making preparations as is most
[2:14:13.680 --> 2:14:20.880]  of the most Christian Muslim religions to basically await the Antichrist and
[2:14:20.880 --> 2:14:26.160]  the seats are being built now as I read on the web I mean basically Muslim
[2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:30.320]  religion which are very similar in revelation is called Yamata in the
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:35.720]  Koran the the Antichrist called the job and ironically in the Koran it tells
[2:14:35.720 --> 2:14:41.480]  he has one eye that's why we see all these buildings with one eye with the
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:45.840]  eye and that's why that's why he was a you know had a degree in occult
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:52.640]  mythology was a top scholar JR Tolkien you know the the the evil god they
[2:14:52.640 --> 2:14:56.160]  worship has the one single burning eye and lives at the top of a pyramid shape
[2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:01.480]  mountain it exactly they throw these archetypal images in our face
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:06.480]  I want to just go into this because the occult get that strength through symbolism
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:11.200]  when it seems to be everywhere when you really look at it and yes they I mean they
[2:15:11.200 --> 2:15:15.200]  have a cover of news week sacrifice they have a cover of never covered of news
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:21.600]  week just covered with with like subgenius type Illuminati symbolism
[2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:25.960]  about how Obama is the supreme leader being energized worldwide and there's
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:30.880]  all this Kabbalic symbolism if you know about the Kabbalah and I'm for
[2:15:30.880 --> 2:15:34.840]  present planet dot TV viewers I'm holding up the new global elite cover from
[2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:38.320]  news week a few weeks ago we're gonna zoom in even more on all these occult
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:44.320]  symbols go ahead sir yeah so basically look again Islam and Krishna very much
[2:15:44.320 --> 2:15:47.800]  similar in terms of the Kiyama and revelations while current says it's like
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:52.120]  we reveal the prophet Jesus because it's symbolic of the day and did he actually
[2:15:52.120 --> 2:15:57.320]  comes back we call him Esa in the Koran and he destroys the antichrist now what
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:03.040]  I believe I is that basically the whole purpose is Illuminati world order for
[2:16:03.040 --> 2:16:07.600]  centuries has been planning to basically facilitate the return of the
[2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:13.320]  antichrist and the Koran so the United Nations admits that they are bringing in
[2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:17.400]  a world religious leader and that if you don't you can have whatever religion you
[2:16:17.400 --> 2:16:21.280]  want but you've got to worship this one leader and his image which is broadcast
[2:16:21.280 --> 2:16:26.800]  for the whole world to see television and if you don't you are killed yeah I
[2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:32.320]  mean I'm saying this method in their madness you know it's not just for the
[2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:36.600]  power for its own sake and I believe all this is systematic from the first
[2:16:36.600 --> 2:16:41.000]  World War second World War it's to create the state of Israel so they have
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:46.920]  the power over that the Koran and the Bible says the antichrist will
[2:16:46.920 --> 2:16:51.760]  be between Syria and Iraq effectively Palestine yeah so I believe this agenda
[2:16:51.760 --> 2:16:57.640]  this occult satanic agenda is you know it's coincident the current is you know
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:04.040]  basically Istanbul will form it can be consummated in 2015 so if you join
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:10.040]  this yeah so listen I appreciate your call great points I'm going to move on
[2:17:10.040 --> 2:17:14.200]  to other callers everybody has time but I want to say this from a secular
[2:17:14.200 --> 2:17:18.520]  position every time I bring up Bohemian Grove skull and bones are supposed to
[2:17:18.520 --> 2:17:22.520]  Christian conservative leaders involved in all these rituals people say oh you're
[2:17:22.520 --> 2:17:26.200]  just a Christian I don't believe in all that well when the hillside strangler goes
[2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:29.600]  out and strangles women and carves a pentagram in his hand and says you know
[2:17:29.600 --> 2:17:36.560]  hail Satan and you know makes the Diablo sign in court that you know they
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:40.440]  don't say to the judge let's let him go we don't believe in Satanism we say this

[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:52.800]  disconnect with the yuppies and the and the humanist and the atheist they say
[2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:56.760]  well I don't believe in all of that well I mean the world leaders do believe it
[2:17:56.760 --> 2:18:00.120]  even if you don't believe it even if you think it's all made up they believe
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:03.640]  they're creating this world Christ they believe they're bringing in this world
[2:18:03.640 --> 2:18:06.960]  government with the computers tracking everything you do and thumb scanning and
[2:18:06.960 --> 2:18:12.360]  face scanning and national ID cards to buy and sell fact in fact go to YouTube
[2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:21.160]  and Google Joe Biden talks about microchip in the in the body and there
[2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:26.120]  he is a few years ago in testimony when they're interviewing justice to leto
[2:18:26.120 --> 2:18:32.120]  and they say mark my words you will rule on the implantable chip and in
[2:18:32.120 --> 2:18:34.360]  Mexico if you want to be part of the attorney general's office you have to
[2:18:34.360 --> 2:18:38.800]  take one all over the world special forces troops including the US many of
[2:18:38.800 --> 2:18:43.000]  them are being made to take the chip if you want to have a job in the next ten

[2:18:53.280 --> 2:18:58.600]  if you say well it's a self-fulfilling prophecy the elites the esoteric
[2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:04.600]  people they saw the Bible and they saw what John on the alipatmos said and what
[2:19:04.600 --> 2:19:08.920]  Daniel said and so they're creating it they're making it regardless regardless
[2:19:08.920 --> 2:19:14.160]  it's being done John actually found the audio of it will you I am that to the

[2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.720]  for having me Alex actually I wanted to talk about something altogether
[2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:47.920]  different but I've been on the phone listening to the clips that you've been
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:55.480]  playing and your talk with Jerusalem I want to tell you something about myself
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:59.360]  and where I'm coming from so understand what it is that I want to say I consider
[2:25:59.360 --> 2:26:07.960]  myself a brother truth activist I wrote a report several years ago on the
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:12.400]  acquiescence of the Israeli government in Palestinian Authority first strike
[2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:19.640]  attacks on Jews and I'm able to send you evidence of how that report actually
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:24.360]  prevented such an attack many of the things that were said in the clips that
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:27.600]  were played before I don't agree with and I don't want to go into specifics
[2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:32.400]  unless you request it because it would just take too much time I know you have
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:36.880]  many other callers maybe if there's another opportunity the clip you played
[2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:42.600]  from the English Jew I agree with almost nothing that he said except for one
[2:26:42.600 --> 2:26:46.680]  thing that I feel very strongly about and that's where he mentioned the
[2:26:46.680 --> 2:26:53.680]  manipulation of by the Zionists over the fact of the Holocaust in order to to
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:27:00.000]  manipulate Gentiles into guilt into doing things for Israel I'll go further
[2:27:00.000 --> 2:27:05.200]  than what he said and mentioned the very fact of the Zionist complicity and
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:10.200]  helping in helping the Holocaust to happen well that's on record I mean
[2:27:10.200 --> 2:27:15.880]  that's scholarly publications from universities in the United States in
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:19.480]  fact they funded Hitler from the beginning and made deals to where Jews
[2:27:19.480 --> 2:27:23.480]  weren't allowed to go to England or New York and the United States they were
[2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:27.160]  blocked by Roosevelt and others and then he was praised by the Zionists and then
[2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:31.360]  they had to pay bribes to the Zionists to even be able to go to Israel and so
[2:27:31.360 --> 2:27:35.280]  that's just government again that's just elites again feeding on their own
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:40.520]  people in the name of saving them absolutely it's a story of the elite
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:45.120]  it's a story of you're over in Israel wanted to why did Israel get those
[2:27:45.120 --> 2:27:50.680]  billions of dollars from the US to radiate 110,000 Sephardic Jews that's
[2:27:50.680 --> 2:27:54.600]  absolutely true and that's that was the next point that I wanted to make is I
[2:27:54.600 --> 2:27:59.600]  wanted to praise you and thank you for bringing up the fact of the of the
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:04.440]  easy I don't know if it can be called a genocide why did you know we know why the
[2:28:04.440 --> 2:28:09.440]  United States gave the money we know why Israel perform these experiments the
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:13.880]  only thing is that people need to know that it's not just the Israelis against
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:17.360]  the Sephardic Jews it's also the Israelis against the Ashkenazi Jews
[2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:22.200]  the Israelis against all Jews there are many many people and thinking has been
[2:28:22.200 --> 2:28:29.200]  so befuddled and clouded on all the issues like I say yes you have this
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:33.600]  Illuminati elite that sits above every group playing us all off against each
[2:28:33.600 --> 2:28:40.760]  other it's absolutely true it's absolutely true I wanted to say Alex
[2:28:40.760 --> 2:28:45.520]  you you should know that my wife and I on all of the issues we agree I never
[2:28:45.520 --> 2:28:52.880]  call talk radio in in in I don't know how many years 25 years of 30 years of
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:57.920]  political activism your show is the only car show that I will that I will call

[2:29:08.480 --> 2:29:15.000]  Israeli newspapers like highlights and for you to read that newspaper highlights
[2:29:15.000 --> 2:29:19.360]  and think that you know something about me a Jew living in Israel would be
[2:29:19.360 --> 2:29:23.600]  akin to me reading something in the New York Times and thinking that I
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:27.520]  understand something about Alex Jones why would her it's come out and admit
[2:29:27.520 --> 2:29:33.840]  that Israel stages terror attacks well I have to see the specific article that
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:38.400]  you're referring to I think that anything that I was those is for the

[2:33:09.280 --> 2:33:15.840]  ridiculous coordination of the new puppet and chief Iraq Hussain Obama for
[2:33:15.840 --> 2:33:21.680]  the establishment is casting as the role of savior if you just turn off your
[2:33:21.680 --> 2:33:27.240]  thinking cap do everything he says the youth brigades the troops the government
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:33.320]  jobs the foreign banks openly subdividing all of our infrastructure the
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:41.000]  Napa superhighways they will save you I want to comment briefly on one thing
[2:33:41.000 --> 2:33:44.480]  Malachi was saying and we're gonna go back to Mark Mr. X Stan Charles and
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:47.920]  others quickly here these callers all bring up such key issues though how do
[2:33:47.920 --> 2:33:58.080]  you not respond to them and some detail and that issue is that everything is so
[2:33:58.080 --> 2:34:01.640]  nuanced and complex you have the historical background and you have to
[2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:09.080]  have the modern context and then try to explain any of it is very hard to do
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:15.960]  because it oversimplifies but when I get on air and I say when you get to the
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:20.120]  highest levels of the New World Order you find three things you find Nazi
[2:34:20.120 --> 2:34:29.600]  occultist you find Zionist occultist and then you find a group even above that
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:34.440]  kind of this Luciferian occult group people make jokes out of that oh the
[2:34:34.440 --> 2:34:38.640]  German death cult well I mean what is sculling bones what is bohemian grow
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:42.400]  what is the Israeli Supreme Court building what are all these obelisks and
[2:34:42.400 --> 2:34:46.320]  all this occultism and we've gone over that we know what it is it is the
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:49.600]  Babylon Mystery School I mean I remember 10 years ago getting on air with
[2:34:49.600 --> 2:34:53.320]  guests and saying Madonna was doing cabalic rituals in front of every one
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:35:00.720]  of her concerts and for five years she's been admitting it three years or so why
[2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:04.680]  are they obsessed with symbols and numerology and all of this and then I
[2:35:04.680 --> 2:35:08.120]  criticize Israel for sneak attacking the USS Liberty to try to sink it to blame
[2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:16.040]  on Egypt as a pretext to widen the war in 67 the six-day war right out of
[2:35:16.040 --> 2:35:21.080]  Operation Northwoods and then they're a hundred percent culpable but then I
[2:35:21.080 --> 2:35:24.040]  mentioned that the White House was involved parked the ship there wouldn't
[2:35:24.040 --> 2:35:27.000]  let the ship have aid was clearly involved with Israel doing and people
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:30.320]  say oh you're defending Israel saying the US did it that's a psych warfare
[2:35:30.320 --> 2:35:35.680]  operation folks that's a mental illness that's that's intellectual dishonesty
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:40.120]  that'd be like if two guys rob a bank and I say these two guys robbed a bank
[2:35:40.120 --> 2:35:44.240]  one guy's black one guy's white you say oh look at you being a racist against
[2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:48.080]  blacks or look at you being racist it's white you know or you're saying the
[2:35:48.080 --> 2:35:50.600]  white guy's guilty and the black guy isn't guilty no I'm not I just said two
[2:35:50.600 --> 2:35:56.680]  guys robbed a bank but see how intellectually dishonest that is or
[2:35:56.680 --> 2:36:01.600]  then I make a film like in-game and I show 20 or 30 I don't 25 or so examples
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:05.600]  in the film and in just one little 20 minute segment of eugenics killing US
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:11.080]  troops our own government nerve-gassing them and test Israel being paid by the
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:16.240]  US government to radiate and kill many of the 110,000 Sephardic Jewish children
[2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:20.320]  people say oh look at you trying to make people feel sorry for Israel that's not
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:27.040]  what I'm doing I mean I'm showing how evil the people are that run Israel that
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:31.080]  they would do that to their own children but I show how every government is doing
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:34.800]  that because this is the religion of the New World Order is killing and hurting
[2:36:34.800 --> 2:36:40.680]  innocence these are sacrifices they're carrying out look at NASA how they only
[2:36:40.680 --> 2:36:45.120]  launch on certain meridian lines and certain dates and they admit it's all
[2:36:45.120 --> 2:36:51.720]  the cultic with the trappings and the mission names and it's all Masonic look
[2:36:51.720 --> 2:36:54.600]  at how the military symbols and the Congressional Medal of Honor is a
[2:36:54.600 --> 2:36:59.520]  pentagram I mean all of this this is this this we are our society is
[2:36:59.520 --> 2:37:08.720]  inculcated with all of this and so the caller calls in and he brings up the
[2:37:08.720 --> 2:37:14.880]  fact that the Zionists literally funded Hitler well that's declassified the
[2:37:14.880 --> 2:37:18.440]  millner group Lord millner with Rothschild funding before Hitler was even on the
[2:37:18.440 --> 2:37:21.640]  scene so we're gonna build up Germany put a demagogue in have him wreck Europe
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:26.240]  they will go in and save the day and set up the world government out of that they
[2:37:26.240 --> 2:37:34.640]  got the United Nations they create the crises offer the solution so it's not
[2:37:34.640 --> 2:37:42.120]  defending Israel to point out that Israel worked with Hitler and that's on
[2:37:42.120 --> 2:37:50.080]  record it's stating the facts and saying well what do we make of this what do we
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:54.400]  what do we do with this information you know who is the real group and control
[2:37:54.400 --> 2:38:07.520]  what is going on here and at the end of the day the issue is I don't hate Jews
[2:38:07.520 --> 2:38:12.960]  and I don't hate Palestinians and I don't hate black people and I don't hate
[2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:17.680]  Arabs and I don't hate Chinese and I don't hate Russians I don't like the
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:22.480]  evil Russian leadership over the last hundred years 90-something years funded
[2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:26.720]  by the globalist the bankers I don't like the Hitlerian system I don't like
[2:38:26.720 --> 2:38:29.800]  what our government's doing it's an illegitimate government I you know I'm
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:33.400]  saying there's evil people team up together to take over governments and
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:38.840]  they always use tribalism and religion to manipulate their own subgroup who
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:43.840]  will fight and die for them whether it's Arabs or Jews or Israelis or anybody
[2:38:43.840 --> 2:38:48.240]  when in the end the greatest abuses are meted out I mean Hitler at the end of
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:50.920]  the war said I hate the German people and they deserve to die they're not good
[2:38:50.920 --> 2:38:54.760]  and I'm glad they're dying and go ahead and when he's in the bunker flood the
[2:38:54.760 --> 2:38:57.880]  underground subway system you know from the underground tunnels that everybody's
[2:38:57.880 --> 2:39:02.520]  in kill them all they deserve to die that's what I'm saying this is
[2:39:02.520 --> 2:39:07.160]  sophisticated this is nuanced it is an indictment of the Zionist regime in
[2:39:07.160 --> 2:39:11.560]  Israel to come out and show how they kill their own people and to come out show
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:14.200]  how they work with Hitler and wouldn't let Jews flee other parts of the world
[2:39:14.200 --> 2:39:20.820]  or how on record how how the Zionist would would bomb Jews in Spain and in
[2:39:20.820 --> 2:39:24.280]  Iraq and in Iran and drive them out of places they've been for thousands of
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:29.920]  years to make them come to Israel why is that why do they want them all there
[2:39:29.920 --> 2:39:36.280]  it's so they can be killed it's so they can be played off as genocidal ponds
[2:39:36.280 --> 2:39:43.760]  against their neighbors and it's what Albert Pike wrote about in 1879 the
[2:39:43.760 --> 2:39:47.280]  three world wars they would engineer everything they would do and it's it's
[2:39:47.280 --> 2:39:54.360]  happening and so see if we as a people Muslims Christians Jews Hindus Buddhist
[2:39:54.360 --> 2:40:00.120]  whatever liberals conservatives old young black white doesn't matter say we
[2:40:00.120 --> 2:40:03.440]  don't want foreign banks seizing our roads and jacking up the prices and
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:06.480]  raping us when they engineered the financial crisis to begin with they
[2:40:06.480 --> 2:40:09.200]  engineer it they get the bailouts and we got to pay interest on the money we
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:14.480]  give them somebody goes oh you just like the Jews I'm like what does it have to
[2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:18.800]  do with the issue of no to the North American super highways no to foreigners
[2:40:18.800 --> 2:40:22.840]  seizing up all our infrastructure in national parks no to the animal ID the
[2:40:22.840 --> 2:40:26.760]  premises ID no to all this regulation and control and CPS grabbing over a
[2:40:26.760 --> 2:40:29.800]  million children a year and the phony drug war
[2:40:29.800 --> 2:40:34.440]  ah shut up your government this info no government this info gets us to all
[2:40:34.440 --> 2:40:38.760]  fight with each other and argue over this or that or this instead of let's say
[2:40:38.760 --> 2:40:42.840]  no to world government let's say no to centralization let's say no to
[2:40:42.840 --> 2:40:46.680]  everything the global engineers are for their for collectivism their for open
[2:40:46.680 --> 2:40:51.120]  borders their for surveillance their for regulation their for centralization
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:55.040]  their for regionalization their for the FEMA 10 regions their for the CPS
[2:40:55.040 --> 2:40:58.680]  their for getting everybody institutionalized their for drugging the
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:01.920]  population with Ritalin and Prozac now over a hundred million prescriptions a
[2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:05.720]  year for prozac alone in the US they are for drugging us to control us they
[2:41:05.720 --> 2:41:09.000]  want to break up our families they state in their own policy reports we've shown
[2:41:09.000 --> 2:41:13.400]  you and covered here that's the issue it we're against the policies we're against
[2:41:13.400 --> 2:41:17.320]  the ideas we're against these wars we're against gun control the victim
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:21.920]  disarmament I am against everything the new world orders for which is all against
[2:41:21.920 --> 2:41:25.120]  the bill of rights and constitution I'm for the bill of rights and constitution
[2:41:25.120 --> 2:41:29.200]  they're against it therefore I'm against them on all issues and they want to
[2:41:29.200 --> 2:41:32.840]  sidetrack you from waking people up about government sponsored terror and
[2:41:32.840 --> 2:41:36.400]  waking people up about GMO foods and how deadly they are and waking people up
[2:41:36.400 --> 2:41:39.440]  about the fact there's no law you got to take vaccines or the media saying
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:42.440]  homeschooling is illegal when there's millions of homeschoolers and it's not
[2:41:42.440 --> 2:41:47.000]  illegal all these hoaxes they run instead of us coming together on real
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:53.360]  concrete things that we in every poll 90 95 99% of people don't want the North
[2:41:53.360 --> 2:41:58.240]  American Union so we should come together and say no 98% of Texans don't
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:02.400]  want the trans Texas NAFTA highway so they claim they're getting rid of it but
[2:42:02.400 --> 2:42:06.160]  then they say oh we're actually breaking it up into multi parts so we come back
[2:42:06.160 --> 2:42:10.440]  and we fight them on that deception we sue them we remove them we expose them
[2:42:10.440 --> 2:42:15.640]  remove them from office we know the electronic voting machines are fraud
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:20.400]  ridden and stealing elections so we expose those we have petition signed for a
[2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:24.840]  paper ballot vote to remove them we get aggressive we go out we say no to the
[2:42:24.840 --> 2:42:28.640]  Patriot Act no to the police state no to secret arrest we point out how the
[2:42:28.640 --> 2:42:33.480]  public's been conditioned to accept troops on the streets of America another
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:38.720]  example of this group ism and how they use tribalism balkanization to divide
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:43.480]  and conquerors is Obama all over in full wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:47.480]  on the comments under the stories people come in and most of them probably
[2:42:47.480 --> 2:42:51.560]  shills and they'll say you just don't like Obama because you don't like black
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:58.320]  people no I'm against forced conscription in a new national draft for the
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:02.720]  military eighteen to twenty four on record on the Obama website and from a
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:09.800]  chief of staff no I am against open borders is the globalist for it and
[2:43:09.800 --> 2:43:12.640]  then we go through the reasons deindustrialization bankrupting the
[2:43:12.640 --> 2:43:16.280]  states welfare systems and medical systems so the feds have to come in
[2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:20.840]  again they wreck everything so they can then come in as the saviors that's the
[2:43:20.840 --> 2:43:30.040]  system they use over and over again it's just so utterly mindless what's going
[2:43:30.040 --> 2:43:33.000]  on you know all the liberals want to prove that they like black people and
[2:43:33.000 --> 2:43:38.320]  aren't racist because they have all this guilt the media's taught them and so
[2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:42.760]  then they all pile on go I don't care what Obama says or does I love him
[2:43:42.760 --> 2:43:47.520]  because I've proven I voted for him and I'm proving that I'm not racist and then
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:51.440]  black folks are like man I you know he's a you know he's a brother from another
[2:43:51.440 --> 2:43:54.880]  mother and and and you know this is such a great thing and it gives us this
[2:43:54.880 --> 2:43:58.600]  pride and there's that real pride there and you wish it could be something good
[2:43:58.600 --> 2:44:03.240]  but it's a lie and a fraud the first thing he says he's gonna do is double
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:08.600]  the funding for forced abortions in China and that's not Alex Jones the
[2:44:08.600 --> 2:44:12.400]  Huffington Post of all places came out with an article two weeks ago and
[2:44:12.400 --> 2:44:16.640]  admitted eugenics and admitted the UN's doing and I and meanwhile Pat Roberts and
[2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:20.200]  saying China's forced abortions and infanticide is what they've got to do
[2:44:20.200 --> 2:44:25.680]  and then you got the liberals over here saying it's bad I mean I mean I'm now
[2:44:25.680 --> 2:44:30.960]  anti-black because I don't want people being sterilized or forced abortions in
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:36.320]  Africa or I'm anti-Chinese cuz I don't want dead Chinese babies how does that
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:40.280]  work see it but it's all like hey I'm black he says look I'm black the media
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:47.440]  says look he's black it's change there's no change you know a black cop can beat
[2:44:47.440 --> 2:44:50.600]  you down whether you're black or white and take you to a prison cell and and
[2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:54.720]  claim you attacked them and set you up if it wasn't on camera this as much as a
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:59.360]  white cop can shoot a black guy right in the back and then hope nobody got video
[2:44:59.360 --> 2:45:02.360]  of it confiscate the video and try to lie about it and he got caught
[2:45:02.360 --> 2:45:07.240]  tyranny can come on under any skin color and let me tell you something folks
[2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:10.520]  it's coming under Barack Obama all right let's accelerate through your calls
[2:45:10.520 --> 2:45:18.760]  mark in Oregon you're on the air Alex and Alex and welcome back and that's
[2:45:18.760 --> 2:45:24.680]  great to have you back thank you sir Alex I hope you had a great vacation you
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:27.840]  sound like you have as much energy or more than you've ever had if that's
[2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:34.240]  possible he rested it rested my voice and that well it I think it rejuvenated
[2:45:34.240 --> 2:45:37.840]  you maybe a little bit you know from all this hard work you've been doing for
[2:45:37.840 --> 2:45:42.600]  the last 13 years or so actually Alex I wanted to make a quick comment just on
[2:45:42.600 --> 2:45:47.360]  what the British gentleman had mentioned in his call and then I had two
[2:45:47.360 --> 2:45:51.960]  quick pieces of him factual information to pass on to you the the British
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:56.160]  gentleman was talking about the whole goal if I understood him correctly of
[2:45:56.160 --> 2:46:03.440]  the Illuminati agenda and its current stage last stage of its known agenda as
[2:46:03.440 --> 2:46:07.760]  with as most all of us even lower-level Illuminati are aware of to bring the
[2:46:07.760 --> 2:46:11.920]  world into this consolidated one-world government is actually the same as
[2:46:11.920 --> 2:46:16.440]  saying they're bringing in the rule of the antichrist as far as their view of
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:21.600]  it goes what do you say as low-level Illuminati well I think they're they're
[2:46:21.600 --> 2:46:26.520]  lower-level workers aren't aren't privy to actually what did you say you said as
[2:46:26.520 --> 2:46:30.920]  if we were their workers oh no no I didn't mean that well no actually they
[2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:36.560]  consider when you talk to a luminous they consider those of us that are awake
[2:46:36.560 --> 2:46:39.960]  as on the light side of the Illuminati see that's how they claim they control
[2:46:39.960 --> 2:46:43.320]  all and that's this balance between light and dark it was funny you said that
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:48.480]  you know I I say no to that title but you know they say don't you know you're
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:53.160]  part of the Illuminati to you're just on a different path you know and they
[2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:56.400]  believe all this weird balance you know they kill a million kids it's beautiful
[2:46:56.400 --> 2:47:01.600]  yeah well save a million kids it's beautiful they claim that anybody that's
[2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:05.120]  actually aware and it knows what's going on in the universe and who wants to know
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:08.520]  and it was into knowledge which they say is the real wealth they claim that
[2:47:08.520 --> 2:47:12.480]  you're an Illuminati well I wouldn't consider myself to be an Illuminati
[2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:17.480]  unless I believed on Lucifer as Almighty God of creation exactly like they do
[2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:23.360]  pull up that Mason I want to play that video on screen Mason says he loves
[2:47:23.360 --> 2:47:26.800]  Lucifer pull that up on YouTube we're gonna play that go ahead but it
[2:47:26.800 --> 2:47:31.960]  certainly does give I think a very accurate picture of what the end or the
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:36.520]  goal of the endgame stage here is and that is to bring in the Antichrist to
[2:47:36.520 --> 2:47:41.200]  put it in the most succinct word formation pop and any way you cut it
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:44.600]  even if you're an atheist it doesn't matter the world leaders believe in the
[2:47:44.600 --> 2:47:48.680]  Kabbalah the Babylonian religions the occult Luciferianism that's their main
[2:47:48.680 --> 2:47:53.440]  religion it's on record they're on record and and then they are they they are
[2:47:53.440 --> 2:47:57.160]  manifesting it so even if you don't believe it's really real they are
[2:47:57.160 --> 2:48:00.240]  manifesting it and making it real through their actions I appreciate your

[2:57:21.120 --> 2:57:25.520]  down the automobiles but taxes on beef not just a tax on having a cow and then
[2:57:25.520 --> 2:57:29.400]  selling it taxes when you eat beef because that's a high carbon footprint
[2:57:29.400 --> 2:57:33.320]  item a lot of carbon went into feeding that cow and then its flatulence the
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:37.240]  methane and the carbon dioxide it exhales as a toxic waste this is a
[2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:44.040]  literal tax on the carbon cycle if that guys Google carbon cycle for me and
[2:57:44.040 --> 2:57:48.160]  pull up an encyclopedia I want to show people the carbon cycle of life what
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:52.600]  carbon-based life forms it's a tax on breathing a tax on life and yes all of
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:57.920]  this is happening just just banks taking over everything grabbing everything no

[3:00:13.840 --> 3:00:19.480]  our new leader will have been sworn in for hours the new coronation of the
[3:00:19.480 --> 3:00:26.520]  savior all our problems will be solved unless people in the public don't get
[3:00:26.520 --> 3:00:31.320]  behind the president we are all one earlier you showed a photo from out
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:36.480]  there where it says we are all one with Obama and all the pundits are saying
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:41.920]  Obama can save the economy I was on vacation last week I watched more Fox
[3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:46.880]  and CNN MSNBC than I did at night and I couldn't believe what I was seeing it
[3:00:46.880 --> 3:00:55.200]  was such classical overblown cartoon level propaganda and it was just both
[3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:58.600]  parties you know all these pundits going well Obama's got a plan he's got
[3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:01.680]  experts that can fix it but you know he'll give us a greater calm everything
[3:01:01.680 --> 3:01:07.120]  will be fine if the people will join him and work with him and do what he says
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:11.880]  and then I turn to the next channel and be the same thing Obama he can do it
[3:01:11.880 --> 3:01:15.920]  he can I mean normally the media acts like the two parties are fighting and
[3:01:15.920 --> 3:01:19.680]  one party's got the answers and the other doesn't and you know the government's
[3:01:19.680 --> 3:01:23.520]  not good but the media will help you know what to do and the government just
[3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:31.080]  just stupid and makes a lot of mistakes now it's just he will he is perfect so
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:34.560]  one of his new Treasury Secretary doesn't pay taxes so what of most of
[3:01:34.560 --> 3:01:39.000]  Congress doesn't that's only for us we must do whatever they say we must follow
[3:01:39.000 --> 3:01:43.560]  everything they say we've got to get behind him and the approval rating just
[3:01:43.560 --> 3:01:49.080]  goes up and up as you saw I was from a cave but now I like it I am under your
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:57.040]  control Obama Obama it's like body snatchers or something and as the
[3:01:57.040 --> 3:02:01.000]  economy gets worse and worse they'll say gotta do what he says oh they need
[3:02:01.000 --> 3:02:04.120]  another banker bailout for the subprime mortgages oh we didn't spend the money
[3:02:04.120 --> 3:02:07.800]  on the last one we need another one we need unlimited power we've got to do

[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:16.600]  say I don't care if it's a law because this guy used to be involved with the
[3:04:16.600 --> 3:04:20.920]  IMF and World Bank of course he doesn't pay taxes to himself that's where you

[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:29.480]  Settlements you pay your taxes to him and then he takes it and buys the
[3:04:29.480 --> 3:04:33.160]  military and the media and then charges you interest on the money you've got to
[3:04:33.160 --> 3:04:36.960]  pay taxes on look at him it's funny look how he's predatory look how he's

[3:05:22.800 --> 3:05:27.000]  networks inside the United States some US investigators believe that there are
[3:05:27.000 --> 3:05:32.760]  Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US I'm aware that
[3:05:32.760 --> 3:05:37.760]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in London's connections to the CIA the

[3:08:07.560 --> 3:08:11.520]  there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:22.360]  on screen at prison planet on TV I have the carbon cycle there it is the carbon
[3:08:22.360 --> 3:08:31.200]  cycle and they've even this is one of the new propaganda ones where they even
[3:08:31.200 --> 3:08:40.160]  have the fossil fuel production from factories and cars which according to
[3:08:40.160 --> 3:08:45.760]  the United Nations is a tiny fraction less than one half of 1% and I mean
[3:08:45.760 --> 3:08:50.240]  that's their own numbers has nothing to do with anything the ocean is billions
[3:08:50.240 --> 3:08:53.600]  of times every year they've done the calculations on this of all human
[3:08:53.600 --> 3:08:59.400]  activity one big volcano is more one gaseous explosion from volcano puts out
[3:08:59.400 --> 3:09:03.680]  more co2 take the case of Mount St. Helens than all of human activity in the
[3:09:03.680 --> 3:09:08.800]  previous hundred years to that conservatively and what makes the
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:15.480]  grass grow co2 literally what makes the plankton have a great day in the ocean
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:18.680]  so the little fishies so the krill can eat it and the little fishies can eat
[3:09:18.680 --> 3:09:24.120]  the krill little shrimps but now the shrimps are with alcada the global
[3:09:24.120 --> 3:09:27.080]  government is doing nothing about all the true environmental crises I'm gonna
[3:09:27.080 --> 3:09:30.760]  cover this later but they are doing something about the carbon cycle they
[3:09:30.760 --> 3:09:36.760]  are taxing the entire carbon cycle if it bring me back up to a close up of
[3:09:36.760 --> 3:09:39.280]  that so I can show the viewers here and then talk about it for the radio
[3:09:39.280 --> 3:09:46.040]  audience you see you have water vapor in the atmosphere which is composed of
[3:09:46.040 --> 3:09:52.040]  predominantly co2 and it's one of the dominant majority gasses in the
[3:09:52.040 --> 3:09:57.040]  atmosphere and then it condenses into water vapor and rains back down in
[3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:05.000]  to the ocean right here oh my god it's gonna kill the earth but a bond will
[3:10:05.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  save us and then it goes back up in condensation and forms clouds again and
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:19.840]  continues but the trees look the trees evil trees that's why a lot of the
[3:10:19.840 --> 3:10:22.920]  cultists that had bought into this and really believe that carbons deadly
[3:10:22.920 --> 3:10:25.600]  they're saying cut down all the trees don't believe me just Google main cream
[3:10:25.600 --> 3:10:32.240]  news climate change crowd wants to cut down trees but let's continue the other
[3:10:32.240 --> 3:10:37.040]  evil things they've got cows as if there haven't always been bovine and other
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:41.200]  forms of mammals and other creatures on the land that are they're eating and
[3:10:41.200 --> 3:10:46.080]  an iguanas and every other creature puts off methane who they list those evil
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:54.240]  cows the very life cycle of the earth being listed as toxic deadly waste
[3:10:54.240 --> 3:11:01.020]  meanwhile genetic engineering gender bending chemicals being dumped into the
[3:11:01.020 --> 3:11:04.840]  rivers and lakes and oceans causing all sorts of deformities humans having all
[3:11:04.840 --> 3:11:08.880]  sorts of problems from this none of that's being stopped in fact that's
[3:11:08.880 --> 3:11:11.440]  being turned loose completely see because the corporations can't just have a
[3:11:11.440 --> 3:11:14.760]  phony environmental movement to tax and regulate and run your life they've got
[3:11:14.760 --> 3:11:18.880]  to do more they need to use this as a distraction to all the real
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:22.480]  environmental crises and issues we have to deal with they have to pick an issue
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:25.800]  that can be selectively enforced against the population and selectively
[3:11:25.800 --> 3:11:29.080]  enforced against companies smaller companies that the establishment wants
[3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:33.360]  to run out of business this is a total straight jacket on the planet the carbon
[3:11:33.360 --> 3:11:41.160]  cycle taxing the carbon cycle the earth 76 percent water 75 percent salt 1
[3:11:41.160 --> 3:11:45.760]  percent fresh that's really an old bad number it's because there's so much
[3:11:45.760 --> 3:11:48.920]  fresh water in the aquifers it's really poor like 4 percent so we're talking
[3:11:48.920 --> 3:11:55.160]  getting up close to 80 percent water but technically it's under the surface but
[3:11:55.160 --> 3:12:01.560]  here and all this and so they can ban and regulate and tax and control and
[3:12:01.560 --> 3:12:05.640]  have bureaucrats overseeing everything you do because everything on this planet
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:12.000]  that's natural is carbon-based and co2 is not a toxic waste because let me show
[3:12:12.000 --> 3:12:17.280]  you these little evil things called trees right here so green things there
[3:12:17.280 --> 3:12:24.520]  on your screen those put off more carbon than all our cars and all our buses and
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:31.600]  all our factories could ever do now the United Nations itself claims that the
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:36.280]  increase in temperature that we saw in the last decade that six percent of that
[3:12:36.280 --> 3:12:40.400]  was attributed to less than one half of one percent and some that's going to
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:52.280]  even lower from human co2 and other greenhouse gases so there you have it
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:55.280]  they're basically terraforming the earth in the opposite direction meanwhile
[3:12:55.280 --> 3:12:58.000]  there's thousands of aircraft spraying chemtrails manipulating the weather
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:02.280]  everywhere and devastating the atmosphere and the military detonated
[3:13:02.280 --> 3:13:05.600]  hundreds of nuclear weapons in the high atmosphere blowing holes in the ozone
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:10.440]  layer but then they're using DU all over the planet but that's not an issue
[3:13:10.440 --> 3:13:14.040]  detectors in England the United States every time they use DU picking up the
[3:13:14.040 --> 3:13:17.240]  DU and the atmosphere because let me show you the planet punch up the planet
[3:13:17.240 --> 3:13:22.040]  for me planet Earth and we're going to your calls punch up the planet for me
[3:13:22.040 --> 3:13:27.000]  well hell it's right here on the screen here just got to this let me show
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:30.680]  people something right here there I'll just pick the microphone up come over
[3:13:30.680 --> 3:13:34.400]  here you see this this is the globe okay I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna show
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:40.640]  you the jet stream goes this way jet stream goes that way and the debt and
[3:13:40.640 --> 3:13:44.960]  the jet stream actually dips in at one of the lowest points from you know 30
[3:13:44.960 --> 3:13:51.800]  40 50 60,000 feet where it varies it dips down right over New Mexico, Texas and
[3:13:51.800 --> 3:13:55.400]  Louisiana that's its main dip point you can go online watch the satellites with
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:14:01.960]  the infrared of the jet stream and it comes in right across southern North
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:07.240]  America and it comes right into New Mexico, Texas and it dumps in now you
[3:14:07.240 --> 3:14:13.280]  know why that's a problem you know why it's a problem because most of the
[3:14:13.280 --> 3:14:16.800]  detritus and the really dirty factories and the chemicals and then the
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:23.040]  trash burning in China and in India where there's almost two and a half
[3:14:23.040 --> 3:14:27.760]  billion people no it's more than two and a half billion to be two billion seven
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:35.080]  hundred million excuse me and China and India that all blows across the jet
[3:14:35.080 --> 3:14:38.120]  stream if I can you guys back that video up on screen I can I can show
[3:14:38.120 --> 3:14:44.120]  people form right behind me so so there you have the earth yes that's that's
[3:14:44.120 --> 3:14:51.080]  good this is a view of North America no no it's a view of Africa so I need a
[3:14:51.080 --> 3:14:56.440]  shot of the planet from the other side of course people will probably say it's a
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:15:01.400]  conspiracy theory in the planet doesn't exist next but the point is that yeah
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:11.040]  here's the globe now look you've got the jet stream going this way it's going
[3:15:11.040 --> 3:15:18.320]  around the planet and they seem to be focusing on the jet stream a lot with
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:24.960]  the chemtrail spring but regardless of that you've got China and India and then
[3:15:24.960 --> 3:15:29.960]  you've also got the Middle East Iraq Serbia and Central Asia Afghanistan
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:34.080]  where tens of thousands of tons of DU have been dropped and are dispersed to
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:37.840]  the atmosphere that's why a lot of you you'll see orange dust on your car and
[3:15:37.840 --> 3:15:42.560]  we'll be on the news that that blew in from Mongolia China so back it up again
[3:15:42.560 --> 3:15:46.520]  I'm gonna show people viewing oh yeah here's a good shot of the United States
[3:15:46.520 --> 3:15:52.160]  cut to this one so the jet stream is blowing this way okay and it goes
[3:15:52.160 --> 3:15:57.280]  around the world to China and comes back around the Middle East China and it
[3:15:57.280 --> 3:16:04.080]  comes back and it dumps right here so it's going around all on the other side
[3:16:04.080 --> 3:16:08.840]  of Asia and Europe and the rest of it and it comes around and it dumps most of
[3:16:08.840 --> 3:16:18.480]  its detritus on New Mexico Texas and Louisiana in fact in fact Google live
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:24.720]  satellite imaging live satellite of jet stream and we will show them a 24-hour
[3:16:24.720 --> 3:16:29.160]  rendering of the satellite the last 24 hours now I checked this last week about
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:32.160]  a week and a half ago and it was death it was all of it was dumping into Texas
[3:16:32.160 --> 3:16:39.320]  at the time but but it varies it varies in its in its in its its its dumping
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:43.060]  then it dumps a little other places too but but we get the full helping of the
[3:16:43.060 --> 3:16:51.600]  DU right here now that's a satellite shot of the North America okay that is a
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:57.560]  jet stream shot of a limited air that's the Canadian jet stream there's a
[3:16:57.560 --> 3:17:01.240]  several jet streams with the main one of the main jet streams show me another
[3:17:01.240 --> 3:17:06.400]  jet stream here I'll probably get emails saying those things a jet stream but the
[3:17:06.400 --> 3:17:10.000]  point is I'm not kidding so they say there's no North American Union they
[3:17:10.000 --> 3:17:16.880]  say there's no transaction corridor now it doesn't matter I'll find it during a
[3:17:16.880 --> 3:17:28.600]  break you know what just Google jet stream I didn't matter and I could show
[3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:31.840]  you how it's all dumping on you but none of that is a real issue we just need to
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:36.600]  tax the carbon footprint let's go back to the calls who's up next here
[3:17:36.600 --> 3:17:42.400]  Charles in Florida than Matt Ron Ronnie and others go ahead Charles
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:47.040]  Alex yes Charles hey how you doing man what's up man
[3:17:47.040 --> 3:17:50.920]  far say anything else I just want to tell you I'm an African-American listener so

[3:17:54.440 --> 3:18:00.200]  great folks listen yeah I just want to say about my people in this and this
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:06.640]  this whole Obama crap and most black people the majority of us they can't
[3:18:06.640 --> 3:18:11.560]  and they just don't want to believe that you know Obama's not a messiah and like
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:16.040]  they don't want to excuse me they don't want to do anything like they wouldn't
[3:18:16.040 --> 3:18:21.400]  do anything the news wouldn't say and uh for that they're not it's just like
[3:18:21.400 --> 3:18:25.280]  Bush supporters once they signed on the bush didn't matter if he tortured
[3:18:25.280 --> 3:18:29.600]  secret arrest destroyed the bill of rights triple the size of the BATF it
[3:18:29.600 --> 3:18:34.320]  was you know what I'm sticking behind the commander in chief and it's gonna be
[3:18:34.320 --> 3:18:37.960]  the same thing with Obama but with the media just cult like saying he's the
[3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:42.560]  answer he's the answer I mean ten times worse so people go I just can't say I've
[3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:48.240]  been conned I just love you yeah for example like my own mother my own mom
[3:18:48.240 --> 3:18:52.520]  like she doesn't believe me about anything I tell you I mean tell her from
[3:18:52.520 --> 3:18:55.960]  like what you say or like I give her articles after article after article and
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:19:01.080]  like she doesn't want to read it or I told her like in early August because
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:04.440]  you had an article I believe like they said it really caught me he had lifted
[3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:07.520]  all the stores that were closing you don't want to look at it and I said
[3:19:07.520 --> 3:19:10.840]  mom we need to start you know buying food and start saving our money and you
[3:19:10.840 --> 3:19:14.720]  know we need to get gold and silver and I was I was adamant about getting gold
[3:19:14.720 --> 3:19:19.560]  and silver but see your mother is gonna say Obama's good because they're gonna
[3:19:19.560 --> 3:19:24.200]  wreck the economy to force us onto the government dole and then there'll still
[3:19:24.200 --> 3:19:27.560]  be the savers see how they wreck things on purpose yeah and I was telling my
[3:19:27.560 --> 3:19:31.720]  mother like we need to get golden so she was like well my financial advisor didn't
[3:19:31.720 --> 3:19:35.680]  say that Oprah didn't say that the view didn't say that and you know I'm my
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:39.640]  pastor we are pastors and say that so I just can't believe you you know you don't
[3:19:39.640 --> 3:19:43.680]  you're not a professional the view and and and all these other shows they
[3:19:43.680 --> 3:19:47.960]  didn't tell you to buy gold five years ago when it was 300 bucks an ounce it's
[3:19:47.960 --> 3:19:53.160]  now 850 yeah I know I was like I just it's so frustrating like I don't know

[3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:44.760]  moved a bit east there a couple hundred miles but you can read the different
[3:24:44.760 --> 3:24:48.400]  graphs of the height of the jet stream where it tends to come in and dump its
[3:24:48.400 --> 3:24:55.360]  particular and there you have it the jet stream coming in from the west to east
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:25:00.800]  and right there on the screen dumping over New Mexico dumping over Texas and
[3:25:00.800 --> 3:25:04.400]  then rising back up in the atmosphere over the east so you see it dumping

[3:26:52.000 --> 3:26:55.640]  go ahead and go to another call here let's talk to Matt in Connecticut Matt
[3:26:55.640 --> 3:26:59.600]  you're on the air hi Alex thanks for taking my call thanks for calling
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:04.000]  appreciate what you do um I said two quick questions I'll make as quick as I
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:08.560]  can first one I was wondering I have trouble sharing this with people so I
[3:27:08.560 --> 3:27:13.080]  was wondering what is sort of the most fundamental easy to articulate yet
[3:27:13.080 --> 3:27:20.600]  impossible to dispute 9-11 you know truth fact we have two different embassy
[3:27:20.600 --> 3:27:26.320]  heads in Canada and Saudi Arabia US citizens saying that they learned they
[3:27:26.320 --> 3:27:30.640]  were ordered to give the supposed hijackers visas into the US in the
[3:27:30.640 --> 3:27:33.800]  months before 9-11 when they were listed as supposed Al Qaeda in the
[3:27:33.800 --> 3:27:38.880]  computers and they were told look it's okay let them in these passports are you
[3:27:38.880 --> 3:27:44.200]  know these visas are their cover they're really CIA operatives and then the
[3:27:44.200 --> 3:27:47.600]  Lieutenant Colonel the head of the Defense Language School in Monterey
[3:27:47.600 --> 3:27:51.400]  Butler went on record and said we would think we train these guys at our base
[3:27:51.400 --> 3:27:55.640]  and then right there you say why is there not an investigation why is there
[3:27:55.640 --> 3:28:01.960]  not an issue why is this not being raised and then from there you have the
[3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:06.880]  NORAD drills of hijacked jets attacking the exact same buildings at the exact
[3:28:06.880 --> 3:28:12.480]  same time on record and all the NORAD and FAA tapes saying why are there all
[3:28:12.480 --> 3:28:16.480]  these drills going on at the same time as this really happening why am I having
[3:28:16.480 --> 3:28:21.880]  fake blips put all over my screens why is somebody hijacked the computer
[3:28:21.880 --> 3:28:31.000]  systems I mean right there okay it's on record sir it's just on and they just
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:36.280]  go well never mind that and then they go give attention to the operatives and
[3:28:36.280 --> 3:28:38.880]  then their camp followers you know the fools that don't know they're being
[3:28:38.880 --> 3:28:42.760]  kind of the force multiplied mob the establishment force multiplies through
[3:28:42.760 --> 3:28:46.520]  them saying it was holograms or nothing really hit the building that's now what
[3:28:46.520 --> 3:28:49.840]  the media and O'Reilly always talk about is the kooks you know who say it was
[3:28:49.840 --> 3:28:53.840]  space aliens did it and they go look at 9-11 truth they think space aliens did
[3:28:53.840 --> 3:28:57.240]  the attacks or they think it was space beams or they think it was this or that
[3:28:57.240 --> 3:29:01.040]  and then you notice all those groups will savagely attack all the legitimate
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:05.040]  thermate research all the legitimate bombs in the buildings research Marvin
[3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:08.400]  Bush running security you know Larry Silverstein saying everybody you know
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:12.440]  we're gonna blow the building up then those that are pushing all the other
[3:29:12.440 --> 3:29:16.120]  space beam theories they will savagely attack us to try to take over the
[3:29:16.120 --> 3:29:20.880]  movement and then we're nice and don't respond they then call us agents but they
[3:29:20.880 --> 3:29:24.360]  won't talk about those hijackers trained at US military bases they'll just shut
[3:29:24.360 --> 3:29:29.840]  up its holograms and then you and it's it's pretty sick
[3:29:29.840 --> 3:29:35.920]  I just wanted to make one more question by a time I was just wondering if you know
[3:29:35.920 --> 3:29:40.560]  anything about any efforts to like repeal the Patriot actor overturned on
[3:29:40.560 --> 3:29:44.760]  either the state or the federal level yes I do and I'll answer that question when

[3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:54.160]  they're coming straight on for us no matter what we do so we might as well
[3:34:54.160 --> 3:35:02.320]  fight back best defense is a good offense okay I want to answer that last
[3:35:02.320 --> 3:35:10.760]  caller's question and hit two big news items and I'm gonna watch tonight quite a
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:14.920]  bit of the propaganda and write some notes into a big probably 30 40 minute
[3:35:14.920 --> 3:35:20.800]  audio blog it'll be up in the morning before the show so that'll be up on
[3:35:20.800 --> 3:35:24.400]  infowars.com my reportage on that and tomorrow I might do four five six seven
[3:35:24.400 --> 3:35:28.520]  hours I got some interviews going on out here after the show and I'm on Russia
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:31.480]  today and some other foreign news tomorrow so Mike Rivera when I'm on those
[3:35:31.480 --> 3:35:35.960]  channels internationally to be popping in doing news coverage here with us as
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:39.080]  well I just love it because he looks so good on the video we're trying to get
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:46.240]  more and more of our guests you know in studio with us via the video system you
[3:35:46.240 --> 3:35:50.200]  know I kind of shrink from even covering Obama thing off covered bits and
[3:35:50.200 --> 3:35:54.840]  pieces of it because it's so huge or so many facets I probably wrote 20 pages of
[3:35:54.840 --> 3:36:00.720]  notes when I was on a trip last week and I intend to try to again go over those
[3:36:00.720 --> 3:36:05.920]  tonight in the audio blog but I'll get into that here in just a moment and then
[3:36:05.920 --> 3:36:12.360]  of course get into some final calls from Ron Ronnie Paul and Rob and that'll be
[3:36:12.360 --> 3:36:17.600]  it for calls. To answer the earlier caller's question is there any action to
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:23.920]  repeal the Patriot Act or restrict it overturn it at the state city or federal
[3:36:23.920 --> 3:36:30.400]  level and let me answer that question. Don't like to do my horn but it's just a
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:40.600]  fact I put out a news article back in December of 2001 a month or so after the
[3:36:40.600 --> 3:36:47.240]  passage of the Patriot Act on October 27th 2001 and I analyzed the bill it's
[3:36:47.240 --> 3:36:50.800]  attack on the First Amendment, Second Amendment, Third, Fourth, Fifth, 10th
[3:36:50.800 --> 3:36:54.880]  everything and I said what we need is people at the county and city level to
[3:36:54.880 --> 3:36:58.280]  reaffirm the 10th Amendment states rights and to go in and say even though
[3:36:58.280 --> 3:37:03.200]  the feds will claim it's only symbolic that counties and cities and states are
[3:37:03.200 --> 3:37:05.880]  going to follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution it's just a declaration that
[3:37:05.880 --> 3:37:07.920]  they follow the Bill of Rights Constitution and that they will not
[3:37:07.920 --> 3:37:11.680]  assist. I got the idea from librarian groups saying we're not going to go you
[3:37:11.680 --> 3:37:15.400]  know be part of this as a guild and bookstores and others saying you're not
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:17.680]  going to have computerized list of what everybody reads we're not going to give
[3:37:17.680 --> 3:37:21.840]  that to you without warrants then you got to have author affirmation and
[3:37:21.840 --> 3:37:25.200]  probable cause so that's where the original idea came from I said people
[3:37:25.200 --> 3:37:29.440]  need to go with this some groups picked up the idea and last time I checked
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:36.320]  Google cities or states repeal Patriot Act it'll be like three years old but
[3:37:36.320 --> 3:37:41.320]  last time I checked seven states repealed the Patriot Act and they said
[3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:44.240]  we're gonna follow the Constitution Bill of Rights we're not gonna we're gonna
[3:37:44.240 --> 3:37:48.120]  order our our people in government to follow the law and and not be part of
[3:37:48.120 --> 3:37:54.680]  this unconstitutional monstrosity and then last time I checked 800 plus cities
[3:37:54.680 --> 3:37:59.480]  had including Austin Texas and many other areas and that's covered in my
[3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:04.760]  film The Matrix of Evil where we go down there and defeat it and the city of
[3:38:04.760 --> 3:38:08.560]  Austin said yes the Bill of Rights Constitution is in force and of course we
[3:38:08.560 --> 3:38:11.800]  told everybody this Patriot Act isn't about terrorists or al-Qaeda this is for
[3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:16.120]  US citizens and this will be used against everybody and it has been used in
[3:38:16.120 --> 3:38:19.600]  tens of thousands of drug cases and you name it where they go we're just gonna
[3:38:19.600 --> 3:38:23.360]  use the Patriot Act we don't need no stinking warrants where they can sneak
[3:38:23.360 --> 3:38:27.640]  in your house break in plant things if they want without warrants I mean this
[3:38:27.640 --> 3:38:32.560]  is the this is asinine especially when you know that they're shipping them a
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:35.680]  majority of the narcotics in like they ship a terrorist in again they create
[3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:40.040]  the crisis they offer the solution but I've already spent a lot of time on that
[3:38:40.040 --> 3:38:43.160]  as you guys find one of those articles
[3:38:43.640 --> 3:38:48.920]  just types cities repeal Patriot Act states fight Patriot Act something like
[3:38:48.920 --> 3:38:53.760]  that I can show the prison planet TV viewers this because obviously people
[3:38:53.760 --> 3:38:59.320]  forgotten about this happening and regardless that shows you can do at the
[3:38:59.320 --> 3:39:03.360]  state level now that's how I tell you about a couple sponsors that made the
[3:39:03.360 --> 3:39:06.840]  show possible that I'm gonna get into Obama and encapsulated analysis and then
[3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:13.600]  the 911 truth and some calls first off I do want folks to know that our biggest
[3:39:13.600 --> 3:39:18.840]  sponsor is eFoods direct website is eFoods direct dot com we'll put their

[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:16.720]  changing male fish into females it just goes on from there so here's the article
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:21.760]  I want to show folks this article on screen anyways a color blue a color blue

[3:41:35.200 --> 3:41:38.840]  but for everybody else who even has wells that are because the rivers are
[3:41:38.840 --> 3:41:43.760]  going down in the toxic waste from all the cities and then the sewage just
[3:41:43.760 --> 3:41:48.680]  builds up and folks are nuts if they don't have a color blue or filter their

[3:41:55.720 --> 3:42:02.280]  color blue dot com kind of mixed to add in with the news article but having to
[3:42:02.280 --> 3:42:06.600]  have that laying right there I see those similar stories every day like this
[3:42:06.600 --> 3:42:09.960]  one I meant to spend more time they're kidnapping the old people and throwing
[3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:12.600]  them out of their houses in England and the bureaucrats moving to their houses
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:16.240]  themselves I covered that earlier but this goes on in Austin all the time
[3:42:16.240 --> 3:42:20.400]  this is one of the first things I did when I got on the air back in late 95
[3:42:20.400 --> 3:42:24.640]  early 96 let's fight these bastards and let me tell you you know you tell people
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:28.720]  this is going on and they just can't believe it man I've seen cases in
[3:42:28.720 --> 3:42:32.320]  Houston where if you don't pay a parking ticket they throw old people so they
[3:42:32.320 --> 3:42:36.840]  can't fight back out of their house and move into the 200 grand house the
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:44.680]  bureaucrats do this is out in England oh my gosh I've got all this news here I
[3:42:44.680 --> 3:42:49.840]  want to get to and cover I can't do it overdrive today because we have folks
[3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:53.760]  coming into the office what am I going to do
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:43:01.560]  all right let me just be brief on the Obama and I promise a audio blog on
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:06.440]  this this afternoon we posted tomorrow morning probably hell I can probably just
[3:43:06.440 --> 3:43:10.720]  keep keep airing up here poor guy and have him uploaded later I can just send
[3:43:10.720 --> 3:43:15.440]  it over to him for my house and then tomorrow I'm gonna do an in-depth
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:23.320]  breakdown of Obama but here's the bottom line here's how they work they create
[3:43:23.320 --> 3:43:27.000]  the stage terror offer you the solution which you think same at foreigners and
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  truly aimed at you they stage the economic collapse by design with the big
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:35.040]  central banks that have designed and engineered this then they offer the
[3:43:35.040 --> 3:43:38.920]  solution of unlimited tens of trillions to themselves we've got to pay back in
[3:43:38.920 --> 3:43:42.200]  tax money they say you better pass unlimited power for us in the banker
[3:43:42.200 --> 3:43:48.280]  bailout or that we will be in a depression that then destroys the
[3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:51.720]  economy even further which is what they want then they don't spend any of that
[3:43:51.720 --> 3:43:54.880]  money which wasn't 700 billion they keep using that number say point five
[3:43:54.880 --> 3:44:02.080]  trillion at least to buy up everything with our money that we have to pay for
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:06.760]  it in taxes and now Obama comes out and says I need even more power with a new
[3:44:06.760 --> 3:44:11.440]  private central bank in the United States that can just give unlimited
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:15.840]  amounts of US currency to insurance companies general electric whoever we
[3:44:15.840 --> 3:44:22.000]  want buying controlling stock buying off corporate CEOs to allow this vertical
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:25.560]  integration the Rockefellers went in and took control of their oil companies
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:30.240]  again from Rex Tillerson and now Exxon Mobil has announced that global
[3:44:30.240 --> 3:44:33.760]  warming is real called for a global tax meanwhile there's still people you can
[3:44:33.760 --> 3:44:38.080]  go watch trailers for in-game online or or or or go watch the interview I did
[3:44:38.080 --> 3:44:41.160]  with the Rothschild where I say it's a global tax and he goes no it's not a
[3:44:41.160 --> 3:44:44.680]  tax it's a conspiracy theory meanwhile they're announcing all the news it's a
[3:44:44.680 --> 3:44:48.000]  global tax and they go no it's not it's a global tax it's not a global tax it's
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:52.120]  a global tax and using psych warfare techniques against people for folks kind
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:58.200]  of go what in the world's going on just an endless tapestry of fraud and
[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:04.040]  corruption so again they get everybody scared they say give up the bankers
[3:45:04.040 --> 3:45:11.760]  unlimited power or horrible things are going to happen they then bring in
[3:45:11.760 --> 3:45:20.040]  Barack Obama as the savior but this is a new wrinkle in everything because
[3:45:20.040 --> 3:45:23.480]  normally they kind of play the left-right paradigm and and and and you
[3:45:23.480 --> 3:45:26.320]  know demonized while at the same time building up a politician and create the
[3:45:26.320 --> 3:45:28.840]  illusion that they're running things in there in charge and that's happening
[3:45:28.840 --> 3:45:32.640]  with Obama but on steroids but there's nothing negative it's just all praise
[3:45:32.640 --> 3:45:36.160]  and worship and he can do no wrong and the key here is they say over and over
[3:45:36.160 --> 3:45:42.080]  again with the pundits do whatever Barack Obama says and he will fix it but
[3:45:42.080 --> 3:45:46.480]  the challenge the media says over and over again the American people is will
[3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:52.080]  you do what Obama says will you help him will you come in there and and by
[3:45:52.080 --> 3:45:55.800]  helping him will you accept national compulsory service you'll get a free
[3:45:55.800 --> 3:45:59.760]  Starbucks coffee and then notice how they introduce it it isn't that it's going
[3:45:59.760 --> 3:46:05.000]  to be work brigades or spy forces or domestic military or 18 to 24 a new
[3:46:05.000 --> 3:46:08.040]  domestic military that's all announced in the fine print that's what they're
[3:46:08.040 --> 3:46:12.320]  going to do but at first it's oh we're gonna I need all of you to help at soup
[3:46:12.320 --> 3:46:17.360]  kitchens well who's against soup kitchens I go and do that sometimes when I
[3:46:17.360 --> 3:46:21.720]  have time give money to mills on wheels when I can't but see well you're for
[3:46:21.720 --> 3:46:25.440]  soup kitchens aren't you yeah but I'm not for it's like calling the Patriot Act
[3:46:25.440 --> 3:46:29.360]  when it's not patriotic it's the opposite well it's the same thing this is
[3:46:29.360 --> 3:46:33.400]  mislabeling and well you're you're for national compulsory soup kitchens aren't
[3:46:33.400 --> 3:46:37.920]  you I mean you got to roll your sleeves up and help Obama that's how he's gonna
[3:46:37.920 --> 3:46:42.600]  fix things but so see on the news it'll be soup kitchens and then oh and youth
[3:46:42.600 --> 3:46:48.560]  uniforms and kids marching around screaming hail Obama and and the mass
[3:46:48.560 --> 3:46:53.320]  media the comic books the culture they've got Obama the comic books you know
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:58.000]  where he's Superman and in spider-man and he's the savior put out by Marvel
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:01.280]  comics going 200 bucks a piece their first printing now into the third
[3:47:01.280 --> 3:47:05.760]  printing just oh my god Obama it's so incredible he'll save us he's Superman
[3:47:05.760 --> 3:47:14.440]  mixing false reality the fiction reality with reality so again Obama's coming in
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:19.000]  as a savior he'll fix it all you just got to go along with the uncomfortable bad
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:22.520]  things he's gonna do like keeping FEMA camps open keeping just closing one
[3:47:22.520 --> 3:47:26.360]  tunnel of the people other camps you've got to support all these new taxes and
[3:47:26.360 --> 3:47:30.920]  regulations you've got to support the new carbon taxes you've got to support new
[3:47:30.920 --> 3:47:37.560]  wars you've got to support more and more bailouts of the bankers and they
[3:47:37.560 --> 3:47:41.360]  sell the news you know the public doesn't like the 700 million being kept in it
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:44.000]  being they don't mention that it's secret that they won't tell anybody where
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:48.440]  it's being held or that's 8.5 trillion but you know they we have to do this and
[3:47:48.440 --> 3:47:53.000]  so you know we better go along with Obama because you know he's got the group
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:58.000]  of experts know how to fix this crisis when it's the same group of experts like
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:02.960]  Timothy Gethner who engineered the whole thing and it was about the law doesn't
[3:48:02.960 --> 3:48:08.400]  pay taxes and was told he didn't pay taxes and said I screw you just like 65
[3:48:08.400 --> 3:48:11.840]  percent or more of Congress every year doesn't pay income tax they just go why
[3:48:11.840 --> 3:48:19.040]  we rule so they're gonna build him up I believe the stock market's gonna go up
[3:48:19.040 --> 3:48:22.960]  for a while people are gonna say oh my god he's really fixing things we've got
[3:48:22.960 --> 3:48:27.400]  to get behind everything he says and everything he does we've got to support
[3:48:27.400 --> 3:48:31.520]  the carbon tax on all CO2 methane every other carbon put off by life forms in
[3:48:31.520 --> 3:48:35.240]  every industry we've got to put taxes on it we've got to regulate it we've got to
[3:48:35.240 --> 3:48:39.680]  have a guess worker program we've got to have increases in foreign aid to help the
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:45.440]  starving but really it's to euthanize them sterilize them forced abortions you
[3:48:45.440 --> 3:48:49.800]  know we've got to get behind just like Pat Robertson they're all lining up the
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:55.040]  comic books the culture the media Fox News Pat Robertson saying socialism will
[3:48:55.040 --> 3:49:00.320]  save us Obama is the answer we've got nothing will stop him it is up the Lord
[3:49:00.320 --> 3:49:05.640]  God told me and then the media with the images are just smiling happy crowds
[3:49:05.640 --> 3:49:11.640]  every day just going Obama Obama just creating this hysteria bandwagon stuff's
[3:49:11.640 --> 3:49:16.120]  real bad stuff's real bad but the news says that Obama's got a plan to fix it
[3:49:16.120 --> 3:49:21.160]  and if I just do whatever he says if I follow whatever he says it's all gonna
[3:49:21.160 --> 3:49:26.960]  be fixed if I just do whatever Barack Obama says oh and it folks making this
[3:49:26.960 --> 3:49:30.840]  film about Obama working on here every day I mean just the depths of how evil he
[3:49:30.840 --> 3:49:34.560]  is how evil his handlers are the horrible things they're planning how they lie how
[3:49:34.560 --> 3:49:37.560]  they spin how they break all their promises this is going to be a great
[3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:42.960]  betrayal a false hope this this huge Obama deception but again within that is
[3:49:42.960 --> 3:49:47.080]  another deception because it's all about him as if he actually runs something
[3:49:47.080 --> 3:49:50.720]  instead of the shadow government that now is its shadow with North con the 10
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:54.600]  FEMA regions openly announcing they're putting troops on the streets and spies
[3:49:54.600 --> 3:49:58.680]  and tattletale squads and they're gonna have lots of attempts on Obama's life and
[3:49:58.680 --> 3:50:01.960]  the dear leaders trying to fix the economy and trying to help the children
[3:50:01.960 --> 3:50:05.680]  but terrorists tried to strike again and my god they use guns and you know what
[3:50:05.680 --> 3:50:10.360]  Obama's got to restrict the guns and then Obama's openly announcing and his new
[3:50:10.360 --> 3:50:13.120]  attorney general is openly announcing that they're trying to pass a law in
[3:50:13.120 --> 3:50:16.560]  Congress where they can ban by executive fiat through the attorney general any
[3:50:16.560 --> 3:50:23.160]  guns he wants all semi-autos I read the bill yesterday on air it's happening

[3:54:00.440 --> 3:54:05.760]  and help us win this bad okay i want to move fast because we're almost out of
[3:54:05.760 --> 3:54:09.360]  time but i was just looking at the screen earlier another article about you
[3:54:09.360 --> 3:54:13.640]  school superintendents all across the country said they're implementing the
[3:54:13.640 --> 3:54:18.320]  Obama system in their schools but see they couldn't say the federal government
[3:54:18.320 --> 3:54:21.880]  system really under federal control the schools public schools government
[3:54:21.880 --> 3:54:27.920]  doctor nation centers and so they say oh it's Obama they make him the super
[3:54:27.920 --> 3:54:32.560]  star the rock star the super Michael Jordan the Arnold Schwarzenegger on
[3:54:32.560 --> 3:54:37.400]  steroids pun intended culturally and then they attached the whole new order
[3:54:37.400 --> 3:54:41.560]  trained to him and then he is the front man drags it through with the public
[3:54:41.560 --> 3:54:44.600]  going like this because the economy's falling apart and they're scared and
[3:54:44.600 --> 3:54:50.720]  they're going Obama Obama Obama just bowing down like that it's just some
[3:54:50.720 --> 3:54:56.520]  idle and then they implement the total federal takeover the youth brigades all
[3:54:56.520 --> 3:55:01.160]  of it we're in deep trouble folks we may still have time to turn this around
[3:55:01.160 --> 3:55:07.120]  because they admit within a few months 150 days max the public is going to turn
[3:55:07.120 --> 3:55:11.440]  against him and see that it's a fraud just like they did with bush and that's
[3:55:11.440 --> 3:55:15.640]  our job to do that to put out the issues to put out the facts now I want to play
[3:55:15.640 --> 3:55:22.240]  this clip it's from a new any show FBI show portrays 9-11 truthers as dope
[3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:26.880]  smoking terrorist this guy is buying grenade launchers to kill us troops he's
[3:55:26.880 --> 3:55:31.680]  a 9-11 truth they also play subtle race card they do it both ways you know he's
[3:55:31.680 --> 3:55:36.320]  a you know kind of a gangster is black guy who wants to kill the troops and he's
[3:55:36.320 --> 3:55:41.000]  also smoking pots the image is terrorist smoke pot terrorist or 9-11 truthers
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:45.560]  and this is an A&E program put out by Hertz publishing that owns it the fathers
[3:55:45.560 --> 3:55:49.160]  of yellow journalism and this ties into the violent radicalization act all
[3:55:49.160 --> 3:55:53.060]  these national TV hosting 9-11 truthers are terrorist with no incidents no
[3:55:53.060 --> 3:55:57.680]  evidence we're exposing that it's the establishment of the terrorist and this
[3:55:57.680 --> 3:56:00.920]  is why the Senate and the House have said we're dangerous we've got to be dealt
[3:56:00.920 --> 3:56:04.640]  with our free speech has got to be restricted because if we expose that
[3:56:04.640 --> 3:56:07.800]  they're the they carried out the terror they have to stop staging terror attacks
[3:56:07.800 --> 3:56:10.920]  and that takes their tool of hitting us with a terror attack and then posing as
[3:56:10.920 --> 3:56:14.360]  the savior and saying that guy did it so they can direct us into some new
[3:56:14.360 --> 3:56:17.920]  country to attack so that's what they're doing let's go ahead and play this
[3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:22.640]  club you hear from my launch cards look man if I could just get what it came
[3:56:22.640 --> 3:56:33.960]  for and now you know I'll be on my way you a truth or a sheet what not a limb was a
[3:56:33.960 --> 3:56:38.560]  false flag operation man wake up a self-inflicted wound to control the
[3:56:38.560 --> 3:56:44.480]  masses you know there was no planes all done with holograms and CGI yeah man
[3:56:44.480 --> 3:56:59.280]  look if I can just what's your rush bro so and you've seen the national drug
[3:56:59.280 --> 3:57:01.960]  policy ads where if you smoke marijuana you're aiding al-Qaeda so it's
[3:57:01.960 --> 3:57:06.600]  multi-propaganda rolled in here and then notice the the government angle I
[3:57:06.600 --> 3:57:11.640]  told you years ago they were in attack us with is the CGI no planers that's an
[3:57:11.640 --> 3:57:14.920]  operation now you got idiots that are first multiply that don't know they're
[3:57:14.920 --> 3:57:20.120]  being controlled that are pushing that and so all over TV all over media they're
[3:57:20.120 --> 3:57:23.760]  inserting just like they insert that homeschoolers abuse their children and
[3:57:23.760 --> 3:57:26.720]  homeschoolers done their children down when it's actually statistically the
[3:57:26.720 --> 3:57:31.000]  opposite just like they tell you you know the guns are illegal when they're not
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:33.440]  illegal but somebody's at your house cleaning your carpet and they see a
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:37.800]  gun case and freak out and call the police on you in Texas or people see
[3:57:37.800 --> 3:57:40.960]  that somebody's homeschooling and they call the CPS on saying homeschooling is
[3:57:40.960 --> 3:57:44.920]  illegal because they have sitcoms and dramas where they just suddenly go you
[3:57:44.920 --> 3:57:47.640]  know it's a new world order we got to get rid of this homeschooling and they
[3:57:47.640 --> 3:57:52.320]  just they just inject this you're being attacked by propaganda I mean even if you
[3:57:52.320 --> 3:57:57.960]  don't believe the show don't like me what is the point in wanting to be con and
