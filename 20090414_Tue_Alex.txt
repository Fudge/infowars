[08:01.960 --> 08:27.280]  the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.760]  just during the break I was watching CNN with Obama giving a speech and in three
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.480]  minutes it was just all lies all disinformation when everything they're
[08:42.480 --> 08:47.120]  saying is deception and lies how do you even debunk it when it's a tissue of
[08:47.120 --> 08:51.800]  lies he was saying we're fighting the bubble economy we're not going to allow
[08:51.800 --> 08:57.200]  bubble economies when they've just pumped 12.8 trillion into the private
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.940]  banks who were using that to snatch up the roads the ports our companies our
[09:01.940 --> 09:05.400]  infrastructure he said we're gonna get credit flowing the banks have been
[09:05.400 --> 09:09.680]  hoarding the money to further implode the economy so they can buy things up
[09:09.680 --> 09:14.320]  even cheaper I mean they have IMF a World Bank public handbooks on how they
[09:14.320 --> 09:19.720]  do this and then he went on to I guess tell something that was halfway true but
[09:19.720 --> 09:22.520]  it was a lie you're claiming that it's good for us that we're gonna have a
[09:22.520 --> 09:27.440]  sustainable economy now that means a big socialist economy where the general
[09:27.440 --> 09:34.320]  public is totally and completely enslaved and basically work for
[09:34.320 --> 09:37.760]  corporations that have government contracts or work for the government and
[09:37.760 --> 09:43.040]  where they just raise the taxes in fact Obama's in the news this morning going
[09:43.040 --> 09:47.520]  oh I know there's record amounts of people that can't pay their taxes we're
[09:47.520 --> 09:54.720]  gonna show compassion and there's these disgusting articles everywhere with
[09:54.720 --> 10:00.840]  people calling up groveling worshiping me IRS saying oh my gosh here's Reuters
[10:00.840 --> 10:04.880]  more Americans wary of tax man this year because they just don't have the
[10:04.880 --> 10:08.560]  money they get their paychecks so they have their small businesses or
[10:08.560 --> 10:13.240]  companies there's no money left at the end after they you know pay for their
[10:13.240 --> 10:17.320]  house and their cars and their employees or they're even if they're the
[10:17.320 --> 10:21.200]  sole proprietor and only have you know themselves an employee and the IRS is
[10:21.200 --> 10:27.200]  saying don't worry with interest we have a payment plan for you what are the
[10:27.200 --> 10:32.240]  stimulus package do it gave hundreds of billions of dollars to credit card
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.280]  companies so they can loan the money out to you at 30 percent interest loan
[10:36.280 --> 10:41.320]  sharking oh we're taking taxpayers money and giving it to the loan sharks so they
[10:41.320 --> 10:48.320]  can give you credit cards at 25 30 percent interest I mean this is how
[10:48.320 --> 10:52.760]  these people operate it's just fraud within fraud within fraud let's see
[10:52.760 --> 10:57.320]  what he's saying right now go ahead and fade the liar in chief up for us just as
[10:57.320 --> 11:02.760]  after the Great Depression new rules were designed for banks to avoid the
[11:02.760 --> 11:07.040]  kind of reckless speculation that helped to create the depression so we've got to
[11:07.040 --> 11:12.240]  make adaptations to our current set of rules create rules that punish shortcuts
[11:12.240 --> 11:19.600]  and abuse rules that tie someone's pay to their actual job performance a novel
[11:19.600 --> 11:26.400]  concept rules that protect typical American families when they buy a home
[11:26.400 --> 11:33.000]  get credit card or invest in a 401k so we've already begun to work with
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.760]  Congress to shape this comprehensive new regulatory framework and I expect a
[11:38.760 --> 11:45.240]  bill to arrive on my desk for my signature before the year is up the
[11:45.240 --> 11:49.480]  second pillar of this new foundation is an education system that finally prepares
[11:49.480 --> 11:55.920]  our workers for a 21st century economy you know in the 20th century the GI bill
[11:55.920 --> 12:02.280]  helped send a generation to college for decades we led the world in educational
[12:02.280 --> 12:09.400]  attainment and as a consequence we led the world in economic growth but in this
[12:09.400 --> 12:14.640]  new economy we've come to trail the world's leaders in graduation rates in
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.320]  educational achievement production scientists and engineers that's why we
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.800]  have set a goal that will greatly enhance our ability to compete for the high-
[12:23.800 --> 12:32.240]  wage high-tech jobs of the 21st century by 2020 America will once again have the
[12:32.240 --> 12:36.040]  highest proportion of college graduates in the world that is the goal that we
[12:36.040 --> 12:44.240]  have set and we intend to make it more the government is just going to do
[12:44.240 --> 12:49.480]  everything for you but of course college degrees will come in happy meals yes
[12:49.480 --> 12:54.600]  I'm sure that they will have the highest level of people to greed and you'll pay
[12:54.600 --> 12:58.760]  I guess a half million dollars for a degree that you get out of a happy meal
[12:58.760 --> 13:02.840]  that I guess teaches you how to spy on your neighbors and the 2nd Amendment is
[13:02.840 --> 13:05.960]  bad and that global government is good I mean that's about all you learn in
[13:05.960 --> 13:11.200]  college now these days anyways but I'm sitting here watching the president I
[13:11.200 --> 13:16.240]  mean it's just all disinformation all lies they are busy looting this country
[13:16.240 --> 13:20.880]  I mean this is the president that says he's gonna cut the deficit in half
[13:20.880 --> 13:26.800]  within two years when he just took Bush's tripling of the government over eight
[13:26.800 --> 13:38.720]  years and is openly doubling that in one year he's doubling the tripling in fact
[13:38.720 --> 13:43.080]  they even admit that in the mainstream they say oh yes he's he's he's doubling
[13:43.080 --> 13:47.680]  the size of government this first year yes doubling a government that was
[13:47.680 --> 13:51.200]  tripled in size over eight I mean we thought Bush was bad I thought Bush was
[13:51.200 --> 13:57.920]  bad my goodness but now you know why Wall Street gave four times more money to
[13:57.920 --> 14:02.240]  Obama they didn't became now you know is why the now you know is now you know why
[14:02.240 --> 14:09.320]  the media loves Barack Obama so much because this is the guy that's gonna
[14:09.320 --> 14:14.000]  gut the fat hog that's America once and for good for the globalist and when
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.200]  this guy's done when this front man is complete there won't be anything left in
[14:19.200 --> 14:24.360]  this country I mean we will be one giant Third World armpit we're basically
[14:24.360 --> 14:28.860]  almost there already but the little pockets of free market and wealth and
[14:28.860 --> 14:35.680]  happiness are gone because these guys are gonna steal it the globalists don't
[14:35.680 --> 14:38.840]  want any independent wealthy nations they don't want a middle class that they
[14:38.840 --> 14:45.840]  want you under their institutionalized control and they set it on record more
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.640]  Americans worry of tax man this year as a deep recession strips Americans of
[14:50.640 --> 14:55.980]  their jobs homeless and investments 2009 US tax season promises to see large
[14:55.980 --> 15:00.800]  uptick in first time to link with income taxpayers our calls are up to her
[15:00.800 --> 15:04.600]  80% said Richard Boggs founder and chief executive of Los Angeles based
[15:04.600 --> 15:08.200]  nationwide tax relief affirm that helps to link with taxpayers resolve tax
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.360]  issues we've seen a huge rise in what we call rookie to link with taxpayer he
[15:12.360 --> 15:17.480]  said they are incredibly scared will be like an illegal alien you can rape
[15:17.480 --> 15:21.720]  kill steal not have insurance not pay taxes you'll be paid welfare by the
[15:21.720 --> 15:24.600]  government you know just be like them oh but I'm sorry you're a fat hog
[15:24.600 --> 15:30.120]  American you're known to be the coward to be squeezed and controlled they are
[15:30.120 --> 15:33.920]  incredibly scared and they have no idea what's going to happen to them because
[15:33.920 --> 15:40.680]  God bless them they've never owed before as the weak economy puts job security
[15:40.680 --> 15:44.720]  and steady flow of income on a slippery slope many a wary of the US tax man
[15:44.720 --> 15:49.360]  tax consultants say with thousands of household balance sheets under pressure
[15:49.360 --> 15:56.280]  more US households are paying for having trouble keeping up with their day-to-day
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.640]  bills and struggling to pay their taxes their taxes to the private Federal
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.400]  Reserve that was set up in 1913 that runs the banking system that is
[16:05.400 --> 16:09.280]  imploding our country folding it on itself so they can cram it down their
[16:09.280 --> 16:15.480]  big fat mouth and they're using our money they're running out the credit card
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.720]  12.8 trillion in six months that'll be double the GDP in one year it's already
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.960]  the GDP and it's all going to offshore banks and corporations to fund their
[16:26.960 --> 16:31.760]  world government and then they're gonna squeeze you every state's passing new
[16:31.760 --> 16:36.560]  taxes New York 80-something new taxes and they're gonna take your property take
[16:36.560 --> 16:41.720]  your home squeeze you swat team you they're gonna send the police and anybody
[16:41.720 --> 16:43.880]  that fights back with the Second Amendment is going to be called a
[16:43.880 --> 16:52.440]  terrorist and that's what America is and you're gonna have more headhunting more
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.040]  federal bounties on kidnapping your kids I saw a bunch of mainstream newscast on
[16:57.040 --> 17:01.920]  YouTube last night even admitting that they just go out and grab people done
[17:01.920 --> 17:04.960]  nothing to their children because they got a bounty on the job is to break up
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.000]  the family to the globalist want to undermine society to consolidate it
[17:09.000 --> 17:13.840]  they it's like a mosquito injects an enzyme into you that liquefies your
[17:13.840 --> 17:20.040]  cells into a into a thin gruel they can slap up their proboscis or the
[17:20.040 --> 17:25.280]  proboscis and that's what the globalist are their big fat mosquitoes big fat
[17:25.280 --> 17:34.240]  ticks that inject anti-coagulants into us they wreck society they gobble so more
[17:34.240 --> 17:38.160]  Americans worry of the tax man you're not meant to be able to pay you're meant
[17:38.160 --> 17:42.640]  to implode you're meant to collapse so the big social welfare grid can come in

[18:10.000 --> 18:15.040]  free podcast and everything and usually during the daytime I can listen to you
[18:15.040 --> 18:21.840]  and um I'm sorry I'm kind of nervous that's alright go ahead sir um what it
[18:21.840 --> 18:26.440]  is I usually listen to a local radio as I'm coming back and forth to work and I
[18:26.440 --> 18:31.000]  listen to Neil Borts and he was talking about Homeland Security and the
[18:31.000 --> 18:38.080]  document and stuff like that and he was saying that um I'm sorry I'm nervous
[18:38.080 --> 18:44.720]  well we'll go ahead sir um anyway he turned everything to a liberal issue
[18:44.720 --> 18:48.960]  why they're no left wing on the document why is it just right wing and
[18:48.960 --> 18:53.440]  everything like that now that you know and everything here locally and that
[18:53.440 --> 18:57.160]  unnatural and everything they're talking about all the big tea parties and
[18:57.160 --> 19:01.280]  like that and one is a left having thing like that why aren't they coming up
[19:01.280 --> 19:06.440]  against this stuff about the IRS and stuff like that well because the so
[19:06.440 --> 19:10.640]  called left are all big banker foundation owned and run all these big
[19:10.640 --> 19:16.040]  websites literally attacking me or Ford Foundation Rockefeller Foundation funded
[19:16.040 --> 19:22.160]  in fact I'm gonna cover that some later in the hour and so they're there wanting
[19:22.160 --> 19:26.840]  more taxes see the average liberal on the street thinks that oh it's lovey dovey
[19:26.840 --> 19:31.360]  and social welfare net and that it's helping the poor to have big government
[19:31.360 --> 19:34.840]  they don't understand big government is for the big corporations through their
[19:34.840 --> 19:39.880]  tax refoundations to steal the working people's money and so the left loves the
[19:39.880 --> 19:44.920]  taxes that's why they list the tea parties is basically terrorist in a lot
[19:44.920 --> 19:51.640]  of these documents is because the her the hereditary enemy of the globalist is

[21:14.840 --> 21:19.440]  Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best
[21:19.440 --> 21:24.120]  interest of the American people while Obama's already fudging yeah but since
[21:24.120 --> 21:28.560]  day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement
[21:28.560 --> 21:33.280]  of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[21:33.280 --> 21:38.520]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism it's not about left or right
[21:38.520 --> 21:44.080]  it's about a one-world government this film documents who Obama works for the

[21:54.880 --> 22:02.120]  TV the Obama deception the people strike back hello Ted Anderson listeners of
[22:02.120 --> 22:05.080]  the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the
[22:05.080 --> 22:09.160]  risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no
[22:09.160 --> 22:12.520]  surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash
[22:12.520 --> 22:16.040]  depositors can remove from their accounts a fractional reserve system means
[22:16.040 --> 22:19.960]  only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[22:19.960 --> 22:23.760]  deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to
[22:23.760 --> 22:27.880]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current
[22:27.880 --> 22:31.440]  effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase
[22:31.440 --> 22:35.400]  liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply without equal
[22:35.400 --> 22:39.360]  expansion and productivity can cause inflation in order to achieve strength
[22:39.360 --> 22:43.400]  and stability I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be
[22:43.400 --> 22:47.840]  calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have
[22:47.840 --> 22:52.800]  been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years for

[24:19.560 --> 24:29.880]  anything Barack Obama says everything is alive he's 6.5% African 6.5% so it's a
[24:29.880 --> 24:34.400]  lie that he's black he didn't get a rescue dog like he said he was and that's
[24:34.400 --> 24:39.960]  now in the news that's alive and not that that matters it's just everything he
[24:39.960 --> 24:45.440]  says is alive he said he wasn't gonna try to go after our guns and that's all
[24:45.440 --> 24:49.440]  they've done is introduce bills to do that that's another live so he wouldn't
[24:49.440 --> 24:52.680]  hire any lobbyists that's always hired that's another lie he said he was gonna
[24:52.680 --> 24:57.160]  bring us out of Iraq immediately that's another lie and he said that he was
[24:57.160 --> 25:01.080]  gonna end the Patriot Act and in warrantless wiretapping and spying he's
[25:01.080 --> 25:06.400]  done nothing but expand it even above and beyond what Bush did more lies just a
[25:06.400 --> 25:11.240]  complete and absolute total liar he said he was against the bonuses and was
[25:11.240 --> 25:14.480]  fighting against it turned out he signed the executive order and had Senator
[25:14.480 --> 25:17.880]  Dodd write the bill so they would get the bonuses from the from the bailout
[25:17.880 --> 25:23.720]  money he is he outdoes Bill Clinton but I'll tell you also out does Bill
[25:23.720 --> 25:28.880]  Clinton the media they don't call him on his lies except for Keith Oberman is
[25:28.880 --> 25:34.360]  now calling him on his lies but apologizes and says well I you know
[25:34.360 --> 25:39.000]  still like Obama but he is worse than Bush on secret arrest and torture and
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.440]  no rights and spying on the American people and I don't know what's happening
[25:42.440 --> 25:47.000]  and what do you think law professor Jonathan Turley well yes I have to say
[25:47.000 --> 25:50.120]  that you just because he's a messianic savior he can't know he has to know
[25:50.120 --> 25:54.560]  that just because he has all this support doesn't mean he can do this and I
[25:54.560 --> 25:58.680]  look at him up there with his nose up in the air with that Mussolini look and he
[25:58.680 --> 26:02.480]  just makes me sick in fact let's hear what the liar saying right now let's go
[26:02.480 --> 26:06.480]  ahead and fade him back up that insists on instant gratification in the form of
[26:06.480 --> 26:12.520]  immediate results or higher poll numbers when a crisis hits there's all too often
[26:12.520 --> 26:18.800]  a lurch from shock to trance with everyone responding to the tempest of
[26:18.800 --> 26:23.080]  the moment till the furors died down the media coverage has moved on to
[26:23.080 --> 26:27.640]  something else instead of confronting the major challenges that will shape our
[26:27.640 --> 26:34.440]  future in a sustained and focused way hit pause this kid or this is live I can't
[26:34.440 --> 26:39.880]  hit pause I'm about to throw up here I mean this is by the way for those that
[26:39.880 --> 26:45.600]  don't know they teach news reporters and people in LP the cadence the chanting
[26:45.600 --> 26:52.040]  the words and he does it glen back does it I just started looking to this a few
[26:52.040 --> 26:57.200]  years ago and it's real and that's what he just did right there he even uses the
[26:57.200 --> 27:02.720]  word trance and he just does all this programming and he keeps saying
[27:02.720 --> 27:06.320]  sustainable this is gonna hurt you the economy is gonna get worse but it's
[27:06.320 --> 27:10.560]  gonna be sustainable look this is the way out of it here turn up the liar again
[27:10.560 --> 27:16.360]  let's hear the new lie lives will be affected for good or for ill because of
[27:16.360 --> 27:22.800]  what we do here there's no doubt that times are still tough by no means are
[27:22.800 --> 27:27.760]  we out of the woods just yet but from where we stand for the very first time
[27:27.760 --> 27:32.640]  we're beginning to see glimmers of hope and beyond that way off in the distance
[27:32.640 --> 27:38.200]  we can see a vision of an America's future that is far different than our
[27:38.200 --> 27:43.920]  troubled economic past it's an America teaming with new industry in commerce
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.640]  humming with new energy discoveries that light the world once more oh my gosh a
[27:48.640 --> 27:53.880]  place where anyone from anywhere with a good idea or the will to work can live
[27:53.880 --> 27:58.400]  the dream they've heard so much about all right stop it that shout him up for a
[27:58.400 --> 28:05.680]  minute look the feds are taking over industries the feds are basically
[28:05.680 --> 28:09.200]  federalizing everything saying we have the trillions of dollars we have the
[28:09.200 --> 28:12.360]  only credit you've got a sign an agreement to do whatever we say or do
[28:12.360 --> 28:16.520]  what these bureaucrats say or do what this NGO non-governmental organization
[28:16.520 --> 28:20.960]  says and they are literally pumping what couple billion dollars into acorn
[28:20.960 --> 28:24.920]  couple billion dollars into other organizations through the faith-based
[28:24.920 --> 28:33.360]  initiatives and the rest of it they have their rena mob and that's what
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.080]  they're doing so let's hear they're seeing an
[28:40.080 --> 28:45.360]  reporter groveling to him let's fade this up to encouraging signs economy is
[28:45.360 --> 28:51.520]  improving but he also sounded a note of caution or a lot of people to talk to on
[28:51.520 --> 28:55.960]  this the president again trying to strike that balance between highlighting
[28:55.960 --> 29:00.120]  progress on the economy and pointing out the challenges ahead for more on the
[29:00.120 --> 29:04.480]  president's speech let's bring in our White House correspondent Suzan Malvo
[29:04.480 --> 29:08.440]  and Suzan maybe this is the line we are not out of the woods just yet but we are
[29:08.440 --> 29:13.840]  seeing glimmers of hope that statement seemingly representing the balance the
[29:13.840 --> 29:17.920]  president was trying to strike with this speech absolutely Tony and one of the
[29:17.920 --> 29:21.080]  things that he's trying to do as well as check in with the American people and
[29:21.080 --> 29:24.760]  tell him he's paying attention to this issue to this problem despite the fact
[29:24.760 --> 29:28.840]  that we saw last week overseas and turn that operative off I've had enough we're
[29:28.840 --> 29:32.440]  gonna come back take your calls he's checking in with you he really cares

[34:59.360 --> 35:02.800]  what type of cars to make have you seen these cars I was watching crash tests
[35:02.800 --> 35:05.880]  with these this morning and the rating services say these are the most dangerous
[35:05.880 --> 35:10.200]  cars ever even when you crash them into other tinker toy cars he just kills you
[35:10.200 --> 35:13.560]  dead in the hammer you might as well ride a motorcycle and they're not they're
[35:13.560 --> 35:16.680]  gonna basically make all the car manufacturers make little tinker toy
[35:16.680 --> 35:21.360]  cars that are basically motorcycles and so I was will go out just buy a
[35:21.360 --> 35:25.420]  motorcycle which will kill you dead in a hammer is so dangerous because the new
[35:25.420 --> 35:35.200]  cars are basically motorcycles with a tin can around them and so they are
[35:35.200 --> 35:38.200]  talking about now
[35:40.800 --> 35:45.200]  making us a turn this up Ron Paul their deal but I think this is gonna be a bad
[35:45.200 --> 35:50.200]  deal and not help at all but I don't blame him for the problems I blame him
[35:50.200 --> 35:55.040]  for the prolongation of this because he was a very explicit by saying that
[35:55.040 --> 35:58.880]  government shouldn't back cut back on spending he wants to massively increase
[35:58.880 --> 36:04.280]  the spending and therefore he's gonna prolong it but this was a long time in
[36:04.280 --> 36:08.680]  building this took 25 30 years to build the bubble and he everything he talks
[36:08.680 --> 36:13.640]  about is re-inflating the bubble and buying up bad assets and then later on
[36:13.640 --> 36:17.320]  we'll deal with discipline but he had mentioned that individuals don't want
[36:17.320 --> 36:20.520]  to spend money because they're doing the correct thing there they're going back
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.960]  they're saving and that's what an individual supposed to a country shouldn't
[36:23.960 --> 36:27.520]  be any different when you spend beyond your means and have too much debt and
[36:27.520 --> 36:31.760]  too much borrowing that's what you have to do and he his statement that if
[36:31.760 --> 36:36.320]  government didn't do this would prolong the depression he's absolutely wrong on
[36:36.320 --> 36:39.960]  that because that is the understanding of the depression it was prolonged
[36:39.960 --> 36:43.960]  because of the intervention of Hoover and Roosevelt okay Congress let me jump
[36:43.960 --> 36:49.440]  in and ask you this do you believe the markets would have cleared away the
[36:49.440 --> 36:56.000]  wreckage to use the president's words here in our economy without the 787
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.360]  billion dollar stimulus package well it wouldn't be completely done but this way
[37:01.360 --> 37:05.200]  is going to go on for years after in years and they're going to destroy the
[37:05.200 --> 37:10.080]  dollar I've used the analogy about a sound foundation but the foundation
[37:10.080 --> 37:13.080]  should be on a sound dollar and we don't he never even mentioned the
[37:13.080 --> 37:16.840]  Federal Reserve the only time he talked about money was you know if we create one
[37:16.840 --> 37:20.960]  dollar and put it in the bank right it's seven or eight dollars he's preaching
[37:20.960 --> 37:25.120]  inflation and that's how you destroy the value dollar that's actually the way you
[37:25.120 --> 37:29.680]  liquidate debt to unfortunately that is a tragic way of liquidating debt because
[37:29.680 --> 37:33.960]  you punish those foolish people who are out saving money and planning for their
[37:33.960 --> 37:37.600]  future they want to take care of themselves so we preach a deliberate
[37:37.600 --> 37:42.880]  the policy of ruining the people who ask to act that's really responsible
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.480]  gotcha so let you clearly are suggesting that a different set of policies would
[37:48.480 --> 37:52.800]  have shortened the duration of this downturn give me a couple of areas just
[37:52.800 --> 37:57.200]  to that's all I have time for I'm sorry but the two policies that you would have
[37:57.200 --> 38:02.120]  pursued differently from the president that might have curtailed the length and
[38:02.120 --> 38:07.400]  depth of this recession okay maybe turn motors went bankrupt in one year ago and
[38:07.400 --> 38:11.200]  somebody bought up the bad asset so they could get their house in order or
[38:11.200 --> 38:14.600]  something that we've been over and done with and we'd be back buying their cars
[38:14.600 --> 38:17.760]  by now because right now we're not gonna buy our cars because we don't know what
[38:17.760 --> 38:23.040]  the garments going to do to GM so the same way with which did you say yeah did
[38:23.040 --> 38:28.680]  you suggest that to to president Bush hey GM's in trouble let him go under no
[38:28.680 --> 38:32.560]  but that's why I said that Obama isn't the blame for all this has been a long
[38:32.560 --> 38:38.080]  time a long time coming and that's what we have to understand it's Keynesian
[38:38.080 --> 38:42.400]  interventions economics that we're pursuing they went awry and now all
[38:42.400 --> 38:48.440]  we're doing is accelerating it it leads to a business government partnership
[38:48.440 --> 38:54.640]  which trends toward fascism it is socialism that when you get in bed
[38:54.640 --> 39:01.480]  together and business are owned and regulated controlled you know what the
[39:01.480 --> 39:05.960]  very few people will will will remember the context in which you use that word
[39:05.960 --> 39:14.000]  fascism is that responsible to to toss that word around well that is if you
[39:14.000 --> 39:18.360]  don't understand an economic fascist versus military fascism and I'm not
[39:18.360 --> 39:21.840]  referring to military fascism I'm returning I'm strictly talking
[39:21.840 --> 39:26.840]  economic terms and there is there is an economic fascism where government and
[39:26.840 --> 39:30.560]  business are partners and when businesses get in the trouble they love it
[39:30.560 --> 39:36.800]  is it the little guy that's gonna have the tax values tomorrow no it's not the
[39:36.800 --> 39:40.400]  big guys the big guys are getting all the benefits the little guys are having
[39:40.400 --> 39:43.520]  having the rebellion because they haven't received anything because they're
[39:43.520 --> 39:49.520]  sick of this this type of partnership where the big guys get bailed out when
[39:49.520 --> 39:53.840]  times are good they get low taxes and they make billions but no I think you
[39:53.840 --> 39:57.600]  have to understand there's a difference got you between economic fascism and
[39:57.600 --> 40:02.240]  military I wanted to at least give you an opportunity to expand on that statement
[40:02.240 --> 40:05.600]  I congressman Paul thanks for your time we appreciate it thank you all right
[40:05.600 --> 40:09.560]  folks that's us popping in on the mainstream media to analyze their
[40:09.560 --> 40:14.880]  propaganda now what's the big angle here what should we take away from what we
[40:14.880 --> 40:21.440]  just heard why is CNN MSNBC Fox and culture says she loves Ron Paul's
[40:21.440 --> 40:28.200]  support seem that he should be president in 2012 why are they doing that
[40:28.200 --> 40:33.200]  because they do internal polling not just the public propaganda polls they
[40:33.200 --> 40:37.600]  put out they monitor all the digital cable boxes in the country they know
[40:37.600 --> 40:41.800]  what you're watching how long you're watching they can build detailed
[40:41.800 --> 40:46.920]  psychological algorithms and maps off of that and they know that we are now
[40:46.920 --> 40:52.520]  approaching the majority in fact I'm being conservative I will tell you if you
[40:52.520 --> 40:55.400]  put the ideas of Ron Paul liberty freedom the ideas we put out on this
[40:55.400 --> 41:00.280]  radio show next to what the globalist are doing eighty ninety percent of people
[41:00.280 --> 41:06.160]  in polls that have been done support us so we are winning the field people are
[41:06.160 --> 41:15.120]  now waking up and agreeing with us in droves everywhere and so the
[41:15.120 --> 41:20.560]  establishment is at least trying to pay lip service to the public so they don't
[41:20.560 --> 41:24.840]  become completely obsolete and so the public at least feels like our voice
[41:24.840 --> 41:30.960]  is being heard to some extent this is called a steam valve folks a year and
[41:30.960 --> 41:36.240]  a half ago Ron Paul got more political contributions from both parties from
[41:36.240 --> 41:42.040]  people calling themselves republicans and democrats he got more political
[41:42.040 --> 41:47.240]  contributions than candidates in either party republican or democrat across
[41:47.240 --> 41:52.000]  political lines he got the most political contributions from across the
[41:52.000 --> 41:57.400]  political lines from the military and then on several days he broke all time
[41:57.400 --> 42:01.520]  records you know six plus million dollars in one day and they were small
[42:01.520 --> 42:10.880]  donations so we were already a huge powerful growing minority a year and a
[42:10.880 --> 42:14.960]  half ago and so many people said oh Ron Paul didn't win they cheated us it's all
[42:14.960 --> 42:20.480]  over you know where's the money Ron Paul will they spend it all on TV ads and
[42:20.480 --> 42:23.680]  radio ads and print ads and the government operatives tried to come in
[42:23.680 --> 42:27.360]  and say look at Ron Paul you know he we shouldn't have given him the money it
[42:27.360 --> 42:33.720]  was all a failure baloney this happens incrementally just like the globalist
[42:33.720 --> 42:36.800]  built their system of control incrementally we're gonna counter them
[42:36.800 --> 42:42.120]  incrementally and the idea of liberty is now the dominant force on college
[42:42.120 --> 42:46.560]  campuses it's not communism socialism fascism there are more people that
[42:46.560 --> 42:50.960]  identify with this radio show and info wars.com and Ron Paul and everybody
[42:50.960 --> 42:57.680]  else then even do with Barack Obama Barack Obama is a Madison Avenue
[42:57.680 --> 43:01.960]  corporately produced fraud I mean let's face it he gets the really shallow dumb
[43:01.960 --> 43:06.800]  kind of football baseball fans you know people that actually get into whether
[43:06.800 --> 43:11.800]  they like Coke or Pepsi just shallow not even dumb but focused on petty issues
[43:11.800 --> 43:15.640]  kind of the shallow population that never really been involved in politics
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.360]  wasn't really informed didn't like Bush doesn't like where the government's
[43:19.360 --> 43:25.440]  going they took the Ron Paul liberty revolution that again Ron Paul is just
[43:25.440 --> 43:32.520]  the one figurehead of and they took that revolution that was brewing and said
[43:32.520 --> 43:36.360]  okay here's Barack Obama he'll end the war he'll do this he'll do that he'll
[43:36.360 --> 43:40.720]  go after corporate crime he'll kick out the lobbyist when he was funded by the
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.800]  corporate criminals by the lobbyist by the elites by the powers that be when
[43:44.800 --> 43:51.200]  his votes were all for that we knew he was bad and so now they've got him up
[43:51.200 --> 43:57.800]  there every day given speeches every day having press conferences he's already
[43:57.800 --> 44:00.680]  given more speeches in two months than Bush gave in his first two years in
[44:00.680 --> 44:09.120]  office he's out there selling and pushing their agenda 24-7 because the
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.080]  establishment knows they are losing the people they are losing the credibility
[44:13.080 --> 44:19.640]  they are losing their their hold on the people's minds and so they're going to
[44:19.640 --> 44:24.280]  trot Ron Paul out and Ron Paul's gonna tell the truth Ron Paul's gonna do a
[44:24.280 --> 44:27.600]  great job but they also like Ron Paul because he's safe to a certain extent
[44:27.600 --> 44:31.880]  because he's a gentleman because he says it all in a friendly way and they
[44:31.880 --> 44:37.000]  think it's frankly not that effective and then they're gonna trot out on our
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.880]  flank Glenn Beck look I don't get into bashing Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh
[44:41.880 --> 44:46.720]  all these guys in a way it even helps them so I don't like doing it and I don't
[44:46.720 --> 44:50.080]  like even turning off their fans I'd rather I'm tuned in here and find out
[44:50.080 --> 44:55.640]  you know that the true depth of what's going on but Beck has to be countered
[44:55.640 --> 45:00.080]  because we know he's an operative and we know he's a Judas Goat we know he's a
[45:00.080 --> 45:05.320]  Judas Iscariot we know he's sent in to co-op the movement and lead us down a
[45:05.320 --> 45:09.880]  rabbit trail but they're doing that because they realize we are the majority
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.680]  now they realize that we're winning the hearts and minds in the info war with the
[45:14.680 --> 45:21.720]  truth they realize they're losing the military and the police and so they want
[45:21.720 --> 45:27.600]  to keep people on Fox keep them on CNN keep them on all these channels
[45:30.360 --> 45:35.960]  they want to keep them tuned in there so that people think there's a little bit
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.920]  of credibility there so they can sandwich in all the rest of their propaganda
[45:39.920 --> 45:45.840]  but as people lose their jobs as the CPS kidnaps more children as more people
[45:45.840 --> 45:50.000]  die after they take vaccines this is happening everywhere as more and more
[45:50.000 --> 45:54.320]  illegal aliens take jobs and murder and kill and steal and don't get in trouble
[45:54.320 --> 45:58.920]  as more and more people get put in prison for smoking marijuana as more and
[45:58.920 --> 46:04.880]  more people get angry at the system it is going to come to an end now the
[46:04.880 --> 46:08.560]  globalists want to start new war stage terror attacks they got a lot of curve
[46:08.560 --> 46:14.240]  balls they can throw to try to keep people on the reservation to try to keep
[46:14.240 --> 46:20.280]  people going along with the system
[46:22.960 --> 46:26.880]  to keep people rallying around their controllers but I don't see it working
[46:26.880 --> 46:32.080]  okay I was about to go to Rebecca she just hung up let's go to Tom and Louisiana
[46:32.080 --> 46:40.480]  go ahead Tom greetings Alex hi how are you doing good calling from the great
[46:40.480 --> 46:46.080]  state of Louisiana I just got an email about an hour and 15 minutes ago from
[46:46.080 --> 46:53.920]  our district senator at the first seat senator crow SRC 2 and SRC 5 are on the
[46:53.920 --> 46:59.360]  docket for the state legislature which will be convening on April 27th both of
[46:59.360 --> 47:03.120]  them are separate state sovereignty bills one the broad 10th amendment one the
[47:03.120 --> 47:09.080]  second one is in regards directly to abortion rights here in Louisiana so I
[47:09.080 --> 47:12.240]  just wanted to call in and get the word out you want to get the word out and
[47:12.240 --> 47:15.120]  spread the word I might even if you'd like to talk to him or do an interview
[47:15.120 --> 47:20.560]  with him I could probably get him for you yeah that's interesting I just send
[47:20.560 --> 47:24.920]  that to rob d and info wars dot com I'm glad you called because I said I was
[47:24.920 --> 47:28.800]  going to cover this is our top story and then I got distracted off into the
[47:28.800 --> 47:34.320]  tax man squeezing people into the edge of oblivion or sometimes over the edge of
[47:34.320 --> 47:39.200]  oblivion financially but for those that don't know wake up call Texas governor
[47:39.200 --> 47:44.800]  back's resolution affirming sovereignty HCR 50 that by the way we got
[47:44.800 --> 47:50.280]  introduced our listeners called we've had a state senator on that pushed the
[47:50.280 --> 47:55.720]  idea just a few states were calling for this our listeners got the ball rolling
[47:55.720 --> 48:00.880]  and the story broke nationally and now Texas is on the verge of passing it you
[48:00.880 --> 48:07.880]  just mentioned Louisiana I know is very very close and then at the same time we
[48:07.880 --> 48:14.440]  have South Carolina and state sovereignty on the verge of passing that
[48:14.440 --> 48:21.800]  and South Dakota just passed it South Dakota has passed their state
[48:21.800 --> 48:29.120]  sovereignty resolution so again a lot of good things are happening did you
[48:29.120 --> 48:33.240]  notice on governor Perry's website the top story on there is his press release
[48:33.240 --> 48:38.920]  from I think it was a Thursday or Friday governor Perry backing the Texas
[48:38.920 --> 48:44.200]  sovereignty bill yes that's being reported on and and notice when the
[48:44.200 --> 48:52.000]  state sovereignty situation has been going on for 15 years since 1994 but you
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.400]  know again it's this audience was able to break it out the last three months to
[48:55.400 --> 49:00.240]  be a major story to then get other states to start moving now 30 plus states
[49:00.240 --> 49:03.960]  moving to declare sovereignty and people told us oh you don't have a prayer you
[49:03.960 --> 49:08.600]  don't have a hope shut up you know there's you can't do anything we don't
[49:08.600 --> 49:12.320]  have any power now one of those people aren't operatives and I appreciate your
[49:12.320 --> 49:15.760]  call Tom they're not operatives they just don't believe in themselves they're
[49:15.760 --> 49:20.080]  broke back they're cowed they're buffaloed they've been put in the corner
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.240]  they've been made to lie down they've been taught to give up they've lost their
[49:25.240 --> 49:29.360]  fight in spirit if we get our fight in spirit back folks nothing can stop us
[49:29.360 --> 49:33.200]  it's real simple we're in the right the globalist or criminals in the wrong and
[49:33.200 --> 49:39.000]  if we get past all their glitz and propaganda we can bring them to justice
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.040]  so the state sovereignty bills are moving ahead nicely you know go back to a
[49:44.040 --> 49:51.680]  month ago we get the secret my ac report we publish it for a week people say I'm
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.400]  a liar doesn't exist in real that matter we call the state police that matter we
[49:56.400 --> 50:00.840]  air interviews with the state police admitting it the globalists have to try
[50:00.840 --> 50:07.720]  to discredit me and so I hit the barbed wire I take all the blame I take all
[50:07.720 --> 50:12.880]  the hits of people saying it's not real that kind of sticks in people's minds but
[50:12.880 --> 50:18.200]  now today it's on all over TV all over radio all over drudge report all over
[50:18.200 --> 50:23.920]  CNN and now more and more police and military are leaking these reports we're
[50:23.920 --> 50:29.920]  getting reports how the army is spying on me spying on Ron Paul the army finds
[50:29.920 --> 50:33.840]  out about that the rest the army wouldn't part of it they get upset I mean
[50:33.840 --> 50:37.960]  look the globalists are out of control the globalists are committing crimes and
[50:37.960 --> 50:42.240]  so all we've got to do is point out the crimes they're committing and then this
[50:42.240 --> 50:46.640]  stuff can't stand I mean offshore banks run the government and have stolen 12.8
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.440]  trillion that they think we're gonna pay for in tax money if we just tell the
[50:50.440 --> 50:55.040]  truth about this it's over for the globalist Matt Chris Don Brian your
[50:55.040 --> 51:02.120]  call straight ahead and a lot of other news stay with us spring is here

[56:27.240 --> 56:32.480]  soon as Republicans get back in power then it'll be okay again no we have to
[56:32.480 --> 56:36.160]  get around the left right pair and I'm and say no matter who's in office and I
[56:36.160 --> 56:39.960]  get hundreds of emails and comments a day and phone calls you're a Republican
[56:39.960 --> 56:44.400]  you just don't like Barack Obama and that's because it's the discredited
[56:44.400 --> 56:51.360]  Republicans who are a party to all of this who then run around criticizing
[56:51.360 --> 56:55.360]  what they've authored today you know they've been it's like a quarterback who's
[56:55.360 --> 56:59.520]  in there for the first few downs moving the ball down the field they pull him
[56:59.520 --> 57:04.640]  out put another quarterback in and then that quarterback makes a touchdown and
[57:04.640 --> 57:08.040]  the quarterback who was in there acts like he's with the other team and says
[57:08.040 --> 57:11.760]  that's just terrible I hate it that he made a touchdown you helped make the
[57:11.760 --> 57:16.120]  touchdown for the New World Order all you Republicans out there who sappily
[57:16.120 --> 57:20.200]  said Saddam had WMD's and mission accomplished and love Bush up there in a
[57:20.200 --> 57:26.400]  aviator outfit with a codpiece and made y'all feel manly and everything you're
[57:26.400 --> 57:30.320]  now going to reap the high taxes the regulations the end of the country Bush

[57:39.760 --> 57:44.120]  a facetious innovation called the cross-joint scores of people thought
[57:44.120 --> 57:49.400]  nothing of posting copycat videos on YouTube but many do not see the humor
[57:49.400 --> 57:54.840]  in marijuana they say it's sale is underwriting and promoting cartel violence

[58:09.120 --> 58:12.680]  phony drug war would end if people are able to legalize marijuana that George
[58:12.680 --> 58:17.160]  Washington smoked the drug violence is happening because it's illegal so it
[58:17.160 --> 58:21.720]  gives it giant profits just like alcohol prohibition and you know it so now you

[1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:39.880]  all right look I gotta have you guys turn the monitor off in here because I'm
[1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:47.040]  busy watching CNN with just the subtitles and it's all lies I mean just
[1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:50.880]  watching a few minutes of CNN just now let me break down what what they were
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:53.720]  covering and what they were doing in the lies within lies just to give you an
[1:00:53.720 --> 1:01:00.400]  example of decoding this they're saying we've got to keep marijuana illegal we
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:04.000]  got to tie it to al Qaeda they've already done ads that now tied to Mexican
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:08.360]  violence and terrorism if you smoke marijuana your funding al Qaeda and the
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:11.960]  Mexican drug gangs and that's why police have got to still take you to jail and
[1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:19.760]  juries have still got to convict you and we got to put you in prison because you
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:24.280]  know if we don't do this terrorist are gonna kill us all it's the fact that
[1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:30.360]  drugs are illegal 80 years ago heroin cocaine opium everything was for sale
[1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:35.480]  in drug stores and the first thing they banned was marijuana and they use the
[1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:39.400]  term marijuana not hemp because Americans you know didn't know what that
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:44.920]  was and and they and they advertise it is as from Mexico and they did news reels
[1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:48.640]  about how it made you go psychopathic and kill everybody I'm not kidding
[1:01:48.640 --> 1:01:52.280]  there's a whole bunch of documentaries out showing these newsreels not just
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:56.920]  reefer or reefer madness but it would show you take a hit off a joint and
[1:01:56.920 --> 1:02:00.440]  suddenly go murder your family it was this weird when they made all these
[1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:03.880]  midget cowboys start murdering everybody in the town because they smoked
[1:02:03.880 --> 1:02:07.560]  marijuana I mean it's just ridiculous the opposite of what marijuana does it
[1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:10.680]  makes you want to sit down and eat enchiladas or something and watch TV or
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:15.240]  an entire half gallon of bluebell Dutch chocolate ice cream at least a few
[1:02:15.240 --> 1:02:19.720]  times I've smoked marijuana that's what I felt like doing so that's what's
[1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:23.480]  happening don't make you want to go out and kill people maybe alcohol sometimes
[1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:29.640]  cocaine stuff like that certainly sometimes but the issue here is that
[1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:33.640]  this is asinine you've got a whole generation of people the average
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:39.400]  person's even 65 a smoked pot they know it's a fraud they know it's a lie so now
[1:02:39.400 --> 1:02:44.400]  and oh not just that it's an evil drug it's terrorism and then they show the
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:48.240]  police and black scheme ask in the dead bodies in Mexico and say we've got a
[1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:52.640]  have even tougher laws on marijuana because it's causing all the violence
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:58.720]  no drug prohibition is causing all the violence and most marijuana is grown
[1:02:58.720 --> 1:03:01.480]  now in the United States because they have made it harder to get it over the
[1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:05.680]  border in past decades and that's good because they don't spray it with
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:11.200]  periquad and the rest of the chemicals now stuff grown here in the US so 86% of
[1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:17.120]  drug users only of illegal drug users only use marijuana and they know that
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:21.400]  the establishment knows it's a fraud in the business the government controls the
[1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:25.560]  cartels that ship in the heroin and cocaine the few cartels they bust the
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:30.240]  cartels not paying their cut you got a big war against methamphetamine because
[1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:32.840]  that's a drug the government uncontroll and by the government making
[1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:37.040]  amphetamines illegal it's all the backyard made stuff where even the
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:39.640]  chemicals you make it where they're controlled so they've got to mix it with
[1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:44.200]  a bunch of other chemicals and it's it's full of poison anybody using crank or
[1:03:44.200 --> 1:03:49.480]  methamphetamine is insane I mean the pharmaceutical stuff will fry your brain
[1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:54.880]  from not get enough sleep and aging but you can go for 20 30 years on that look
[1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:59.520]  at Kennedy look at the Beatles look at you know pharmaceutical methamphetamine
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:04.720]  with Elvis but the stuff the stuff you're buying out of trailers that stuff
[1:04:04.720 --> 1:04:09.280]  you kill your dad in a hammer it'll give you an autoimmune disease it'll it'll
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:14.800]  kill your your your your white blood cells I mean it's just deadly so but
[1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:18.920]  again that's the government making it illegal thanks a lot scumbags you're
[1:04:18.920 --> 1:04:23.800]  causing all the carnage of course these crank crank cookers are out of their
[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:27.560]  minds I mean they're snorting heavy metals and
[1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:30.640]  greniard reagents and every other poison you can imagine but but that's another
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:37.520]  side issue then they cut to addiction in America and then they cut to the ad and
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:43.480]  it's a Prozac ad something even more deadly and it's molecular structure so
[1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:48.920]  it's just all fraud it's all scams it's all lies and they're gonna let all a
[1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:53.800]  society collapse before they stop dealing their drugs the government and they
[1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:57.400]  love their private prisons they put you in after they sell you the drugs it's a
[1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:02.120]  complete stinking fraud and we're gonna collapse just like Mexico are you

[1:08:56.120 --> 1:09:02.520]  you've got a remark is who marcus williams you had him oh yeah yeah let me
[1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:07.200]  yeah sure marcus williams from the newbie and bookstore yeah sure yeah yeah
[1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:13.400]  well um i was talking to him and he got the 200 DVDs and i've been clarkston
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:17.880]  georgia and i've been working on part of the one mile diameter city i've been
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:22.280]  working on clarkston for several years now and my idea is to make a present
[1:09:22.280 --> 1:09:28.600]  presentation of obama deception dvd to the police chief the mayor six city
[1:09:28.600 --> 1:09:36.000]  council people um city attorney and city clerk and i'm just kind of conducting
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:40.200]  an experiment in my own city with awareness raising i was wondering if
[1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:46.200]  maybe well maybe you could pay attention to that one a little bit pay attention
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:51.160]  to one a little bit well this little experiment of ours here with the small
[1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:56.680]  city in georgia and maybe a little focus i know you've got a full plate
[1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:03.400]  um so i'm gonna get these dvds from marcus and presented to the whole city
[1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:08.360]  council and and see what the effects are and i'll report back to you but one of
[1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:14.080]  questions i want to ask about taxes was uh did she say anything about sherry
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:19.680]  jackson uh she's in prison now she was the irs whistleblower
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:24.880]  uh agent irs agent whistleblower and she's in prison now i was at her trial
[1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:28.800]  and i didn't know if a missed part of joe vanister's discussion
[1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:32.000]  now we've had her on the show before and of course they set her up in senator
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.440]  prison for her free speech that's how they operate listen i appreciate your
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.880]  call sir uh you know i sent 200 free dvds to that bookstore
[1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:45.600]  and i have given a bunch of other people free dvds
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:49.280]  we don't really toot our horn about it here i mean if somebody gave me 50
[1:10:49.280 --> 1:10:53.840]  million dollars i would give 50 million free dvds up
[1:10:53.840 --> 1:10:58.640]  i mean that's how we operate the goal is unlocking hearts and minds
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:03.280]  everything is about hearts and minds everything is about reversing the
[1:11:03.280 --> 1:11:05.920]  globalist i mean
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:09.520]  just last night i was surfing around youtube
[1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:13.440]  and it was worse than i even thought i found all these clips where they had
[1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:17.360]  cps workers admitting that they get paid bounties to kidnap
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:20.240]  people's kids i mean i knew they were doing that but
[1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:23.440]  to have them brag about it
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:27.840]  perhaps we'll play some of those clips later if i have time
[1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:31.760]  i mean just on that issue alone and how it's not real courts
[1:11:31.760 --> 1:11:36.320]  and how they're above the law and they're arrogant
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:39.360]  and people are like what does the obama deception has to do with that
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:42.800]  that's what i mean it's just the government is bad folks
[1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:47.040]  i'm done trying to explain it to people i mean i say i'm done
[1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:52.480]  mentally i just live this constantly i study it constantly i know about their
[1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:56.480]  crimes and people email me and go oh you're exaggerating government isn't
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:00.800]  as bad as you say folks i can't tell you how bad they are i can't even
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:06.000]  articulate or explain how out of control this system is
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  and all i think about is the children i mean i think about how the globalist
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:13.040]  in government textbooks that we've posted and documented and linked to and
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:17.520]  done articles on all these textbooks
[1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:21.040]  where they say we want to break up the family we want to end the family
[1:12:21.040 --> 1:12:24.320]  the government's job is to break up the family and break up the middle class and
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:27.760]  break up businesses and bankrupt the economy so that everybody
[1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:32.480]  works for the new world order i mean this is cold-blooded conquering humanity
[1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.680]  conquering the species the scientific dictatorship
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:39.360]  just doesn't roll in with tanks and take over your government and occupy your
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:43.600]  nation and then put in some puppet puppet frontmen
[1:12:43.600 --> 1:12:47.920]  the scientific dictatorship brainwashes you with tv poisons you in the food and
[1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:52.240]  water breaks up your families gets you domesticated
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:57.440]  gets you on the plantation and then gives you soft kill weapons through the
[1:12:57.440 --> 1:13:00.160]  food and water and vaccines i mean they are
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:04.000]  killing us ladies and gentlemen
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:10.960]  and sure you know i would expose 10 years ago in 1999 government
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:15.040]  documents saying gun owners constitutionalists were terrorist
[1:13:15.040 --> 1:13:18.480]  and i'd have people call me and say that document's fake
[1:13:18.480 --> 1:13:21.760]  but you know what 10 years later people aren't saying they're fake now
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:25.920]  people know and people could laugh at me about saying
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:31.120]  9-11 was an inside job seven and a half years ago
[1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:34.320]  but they're not laughing now
[1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:39.600]  9-11 commission council government agreed to lie about 9-11
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:43.520]  and i want this guy on red alert new book from man
[1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:47.440]  tasked by government to help investigate attacks unveils how official story is
[1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:51.440]  almost entirely untrue and he says they made a deal with the pentagon to lie to
[1:13:51.440 --> 1:13:54.560]  the public that's coming up later
[1:13:54.560 --> 1:14:00.640]  yeah even if you really think 19 guys from caves did this
[1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:06.160]  commanded from caves but from Saudi Arabia but then Iraq had to be attacked
[1:14:06.160 --> 1:14:11.920]  i mean if you really believe that still the official story is a lie
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:16.640]  that's the point we've always made even if you believe the official story
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:20.400]  you know that that it was 19 guys and the government didn't know and didn't
[1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:23.280]  stand down and you know even let it happen on purpose
[1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:27.360]  well the lie hop it said a made it happen on purpose or did it
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:32.160]  lie hops let it happen on purpose my hop made it happen on purpose
[1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:36.960]  i mean even if you i mean you respect yourselves enough to admit there's army
[1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:40.800]  manuals on how to stage terror attacks that our military's taught this
[1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:45.360]  as a tool like their canteen or rifle
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:50.560]  i mean do you understand there's over 200 examples of our government staging
[1:14:50.560 --> 1:14:53.920]  terror where they admit they did it
[1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:58.880]  these people don't play games life means nothing to them
[1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:05.120]  you think the globalists didn't care about a half million
[1:15:05.120 --> 1:15:08.400]  Japanese they killed in one day dropping a bombs on them
[1:15:08.400 --> 1:15:12.000]  after they'd already tried to surrender unconditionally but you think they care
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:15.680]  about you because you wear a john deere cap and drive
[1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:18.400]  a truck and strut around listening to george straight
[1:15:18.400 --> 1:15:22.000]  even though you're all hat and no cattle
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:26.880]  you think because you're a black person who likes bronco obama the new world
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:29.920]  order cares about you and wants to take care of you
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:33.200]  i mean look stop being suckers folks these people
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:40.560]  once you dead you got that and we have trailblazed everything
[1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:48.160]  we trailblazed here putting ron paul on the map and ron paul without me asking
[1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:52.400]  him has said that on air i get respect from ron paul but not from
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:55.440]  his would-be handlers
[1:15:55.680 --> 1:16:02.560]  and i don't expect the respect i don't care i know that to be the first to say
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:05.680]  something or the first to do something or the first to stick your head up you
[1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:10.240]  get your head whacked but i don't care but i do expect all of you to
[1:16:10.240 --> 1:16:13.360]  realize the amount of power you have and the amount of
[1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:17.280]  change you can affect and the amount of good you can do and the amount of light
[1:16:17.280 --> 1:16:20.160]  you can bring into the world
[1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:25.600]  because i'm just a regular guy from texas
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:28.800]  who didn't like gun control and open borders and police state
[1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:32.480]  who learned that the federal reserve was an oligarchy ruling our country
[1:16:32.480 --> 1:16:38.080]  15 years ago and i got on air 14 years ago
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:45.840]  and i went out and found others and we developed and built the alternative
[1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:49.360]  media system we were the first doing alternative radio
[1:16:49.360 --> 1:16:54.800]  i was doing alternative radio in 1995 on the internet
[1:16:55.520 --> 1:16:59.360]  we were the first to trailblaze viral videos we were the first to go out
[1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:02.320]  and take over press conferences and confront politicians and their little
[1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:07.200]  hoaxes we wrote the book on the paradigm shift
[1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:10.400]  and we did it not even knowing we were rewriting
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:14.640]  the paradigm expanding the paradigm unlocking the paradigm
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:17.680]  shifting the paradigm we just took action
[1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:21.520]  and i took every little angle and every little
[1:17:21.520 --> 1:17:26.320]  way i could break into the media and affect change
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:29.440]  and we've had a great effect so don't for a minute think
[1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:32.880]  that you can't be a great leader that you can't start a radio show
[1:17:32.880 --> 1:17:37.200]  or website or make films but whatever you do don't overanalyze it
[1:17:37.200 --> 1:17:41.520]  and try to make your first work perfect nothing's perfect just take action
[1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:45.360]  get in the fight who's up next year
[1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:53.360]  donna alabama you're on the air yes alec yes sir oh the obama deception great
[1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:56.880]  film out of a hundred people i have a bunch more than a hundred but out of
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:18:01.440]  a hundred people i'll say 90 percent of the people is watching it's waking up
[1:18:01.440 --> 1:18:06.080]  oh or were these formerly kool-aid drinkers oh absolutely those two words
[1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:10.560]  you mentioned while ago paradigm shift i remember when it happened to me i i
[1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:13.920]  heard this ranting raven guy back in 2000 name alex
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:17.600]  jones on a shortwave radio he mentioned a paradigm
[1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:21.200]  i never even thought about what paradigm meant
[1:18:21.200 --> 1:18:25.440]  woke me up absolutely well i shifted my paradigm for it
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:29.760]  well praise god for you what's going on oh well we started radio show down here
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:33.680]  in ozark right outside of fort rooker two years ago they shut the radio
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:37.440]  station down they bought somebody bought it off on
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:41.280]  my website it says hostile takeover i don't know exactly who bought it but
[1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:43.440]  you can't get anything anymore on there we
[1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:47.360]  started american constitutional radio broadcast down here
[1:18:47.360 --> 1:18:50.800]  i called you a couple years ago and told you was going to do it we did it but
[1:18:50.800 --> 1:18:55.280]  bunch of folks are waking up alex that's okay find another local radio station
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:59.280]  do whatever you have to get on access tv because again
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:03.120]  we're little media but people never heard anything like this
[1:19:03.120 --> 1:19:07.840]  and so it packs a lot of punch we're like cyan we're like cyanide the new
[1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:11.280]  world war you know there's no doubt about that whatsoever
[1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:15.280]  i do most of my time trying to slap these christians awake down here
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.800]  and it's starting to work a little bit try and get them to get them past
[1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:23.840]  roman 13 and if you can get them past that they will wake up
[1:19:23.840 --> 1:19:27.600]  absolutely my friend well but it has been a blessing
[1:19:27.600 --> 1:19:30.560]  it's been a blessing getting out there doing something
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:35.120]  not just sitting not just sitting back letting the world pass you by
[1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:39.520]  absolutely that there is it is how stay there i want to hear from you about
[1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:42.880]  how fulfilling it was when you started taking action because
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:45.920]  folks there's nothing like it on earth
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:49.760]  once you start fighting evil once you just get past the fear
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:53.680]  and commit to doing this job you really start living
[1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:57.200]  and you really start understanding what life's all about stay there don will

[1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:34.480]  here let's talk to brian in canada brian you're on the air
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:40.000]  hi alec how's it going good sir um i was calling you today just to uh let you
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.400]  know that i heard a funny report about them
[1:25:42.400 --> 1:25:45.520]  two weeks ago when they had the incident in new york
[1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:48.160]  i was driving to pick up my wife in the afternoon
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:52.800]  and they were reporting it on cbc radio the insular talking to a man
[1:25:52.800 --> 1:25:56.800]  in the area that was freaking out so i'm listening very intently he
[1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:00.880]  the man's freaking out he says i don't get it there's something going on here
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:04.880]  he says there's military here and they're not supposed to have any military here
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:08.560]  and he says then they're telling us that it's one man with a gun and he's killed
[1:26:08.560 --> 1:26:11.760]  himself but i just saw them bring two men out
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:14.880]  in handcuffs and they're not telling us nothing
[1:26:14.880 --> 1:26:19.040]  so i took note of that not much more of that let me stop you
[1:26:19.040 --> 1:26:21.520]  a lot of people probably didn't put two and two together because it took me a
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:24.720]  minute to click you're talking about the shooting
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:31.840]  in new york a week and a half ago um that uh we've had eyewitnesses on the
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:34.400]  show that talked about how the news helicopter was there
[1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:38.560]  before the shooting started and then it's now been confirmed that supposedly
[1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:43.600]  this guy couldn't write his sister was on uh good morning america
[1:26:43.600 --> 1:26:47.520]  and did say that it was fake and that he couldn't write english
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:51.520]  so you've got this fake letter and just like with columbine and other things
[1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:55.200]  there are reports of other shooters but you're saying you heard this
[1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:01.280]  on cbc brian yeah i heard it live the man was he was very upset about it and
[1:27:01.280 --> 1:27:04.000]  he was saying that they're they're hiding something from us
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:07.360]  and i didn't think much more of it until two days later
[1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:11.440]  when i heard that al qaeda had actually taken responsibility for it
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:15.360]  and they had claimed that they used two guys to do it
[1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:19.680]  just kind of fit one plus one was kind of strange so i i've been wanting to
[1:27:19.680 --> 1:27:23.360]  mention that to you for a while now because i already know from 9 11
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:26.560]  you listen to the very first reports and then about after an hour
[1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:30.320]  you give up because it's one story that comes out that's when the bull starts
[1:27:30.320 --> 1:27:34.560]  you know well i mean the very first listen listen really you get a sense
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:38.080]  listen building seven for those that don't know
[1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:42.320]  bbc went on two separate bbc channels and simultaneously at the exact same
[1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:46.320]  minute said the exact same thing so we said that's a script
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:49.360]  probably Reuters because that's who's their main feed
[1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:54.000]  and it turned out it was a internal news feed sent to them
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:59.280]  25 minutes before building seven fell reporting exactly how it fell in its own
[1:27:59.280 --> 1:28:03.680]  footprint uh and with the fake cover story and then we
[1:28:03.680 --> 1:28:07.120]  said bbc why'd you do that and he said we lost the tapes we won't say
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:10.560]  and i own i own records said i believe it was a news feed
[1:28:10.560 --> 1:28:14.160]  then they admitted last year in their own documentary that indeed it was a Reuters
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:21.120]  news feed so again red-handed red-handed staging
[1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:24.720]  and scripting that just like they were reporting hours before they caught
[1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:29.280]  leaharby oswald because of time zone uh mistake they made in new zealand and
[1:28:29.280 --> 1:28:33.360]  other places that leaharby oswald had been caught
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.200]  in dallas so they did it period they killed kennedy
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:40.320]  they carried out 9-11 that's just one little piece of thousands of pieces of
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:45.120]  evidence and uh yes uh with the evidence we have
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:50.160]  uh it is very very suspicious uh and of course that's a lot of them alive
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:55.520]  saying al qaeda did it uh and let me explain what they do here
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:59.040]  we've had a bunch of fake terror attacks that have been staged that were not
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:03.280]  announced to the public blowing up refinery shooting people
[1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:08.320]  and then they tell police listen this is classified
[1:29:08.320 --> 1:29:11.840]  but al qaeda is hitting us and hitting us hard that's why we've got to have
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:15.520]  army checkpoints that's why we've got to get ready for martial law the public
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:18.160]  will panic if they think al qaeda is really attacking
[1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:21.920]  we have to keep this secret from the public and now the police are
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:25.840]  compromised into intelligence operations believing
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:30.160]  that the government's actually good so you understand there's staged fake terror
[1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:33.840]  attacks and then there's the big staged attacks
[1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:36.480]  that are fake that they give attention to do you hear what i'm saying
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:40.080]  absolutely well listen you got to get me that cbc report
[1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:43.280]  folks have got to get that out of the archives if you can confirm that
[1:29:43.280 --> 1:29:46.800]  we can get the ball rolling exposing these murderers thank you so much yeah
[1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:50.560]  i have no doubt that was staged in new york the one in uh Pittsburgh probably
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:55.280]  too we're on the march the empires on the run

[1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:56.960]  to the letter in the spirit of the u.s constitution and its essential 10th
[1:33:56.960 --> 1:34:00.240]  amendment will free our states from the undue regulations and ultimately
[1:34:00.240 --> 1:34:02.960]  strengthen our union
[1:34:04.080 --> 1:34:07.280]  Perry continued millions of Texans are tired of Washington DC trying to come
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:10.400]  down here and tell us how to run Texas but meanwhile
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:14.080]  he's handing our roads over to the bankers he's forcing merc shots on the
[1:34:14.080 --> 1:34:18.000]  girls of a vaccine killing people he went to
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:22.160]  Bilderberg group illegally he's in my film in-game blueprint for
[1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:27.920]  global enslavement but this is still incredibly positive
[1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:33.440]  seeing in Ron Paul every day Fox constantly acting like us Ann Coulter
[1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:37.200]  saying she's anti-New World Order after saying it didn't exist
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.000]  Rick Perry coming out and saying we got to deal with Washington
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:43.760]  that's because he doesn't have a choice the whole legislature of Texas is
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:48.320]  moving South Dakota just passed a strong
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:53.200]  stage rights resolution
[1:34:53.200 --> 1:34:59.040]  it's a cease and desist order to the federal government HR
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:07.120]  1013 it's happening and again who gets the credit
[1:35:07.120 --> 1:35:09.680]  Glenn Beck
[1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:13.840]  gets up and talks about how the states are dangerous moving
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:17.440]  for declaring sovereignty I get attacked the
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:20.720]  my report demonizes the state sovereignty movement
[1:35:20.720 --> 1:35:23.920]  the 2009 Virginia terrorism threat assessment
[1:35:23.920 --> 1:35:29.760]  demonizes it what is all this anti-terrorism for
[1:35:29.760 --> 1:35:35.120]  it's for the american people they're now saying our military our veterans of the
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:37.520]  number one threat gun owners the number one threat
[1:35:37.520 --> 1:35:41.120]  homeland security all of it was built for us
[1:35:41.120 --> 1:35:44.400]  to have the offshore banks steal everything we own
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:48.000]  and make sure we don't ever get back control of the government to bring the
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  bankers of justice the police and the military are just a
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.280]  rearguard action now for the bankers to rob us
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:57.680]  and I want the police to know why they're going to lose their standard of
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:01.440]  living I want the military to know that your enemies the bankers they run the
[1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:04.080]  country I'm going to cover more of that we're
[1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:07.760]  going to get Jim Tucker written for some of the largest syndicated
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:12.240]  columns and newspapers been a newspaper work for almost 50 years
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:16.000]  rights for american free press he is the original guy
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.840]  who 30 plus years ago began writing about the bilberberg group
[1:36:19.840 --> 1:36:24.560]  up until about seven years ago the media said he was insane and it didn't exist
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:27.840]  now bilberberg has written articles and published reports bragging that they
[1:36:27.840 --> 1:36:30.880]  set up the european union the north american union
[1:36:30.880 --> 1:36:34.400]  at an end dabbing on gave new interviews at the g20
[1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:37.200]  the head of the bilberberg group
[1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:41.200]  politico now writes about how it's real and how it runs things and
[1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:44.720]  sources info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:47.760]  again they've gone from saying it doesn't exist to existing
[1:36:47.760 --> 1:36:51.440]  and jim sometimes two three four years before something happens is able to
[1:36:51.440 --> 1:36:54.320]  predict what's going to happen he said you know four years ago gas is going to
[1:36:54.320 --> 1:36:55.920]  go to a hundred fifty dollars a barrel
[1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:59.040]  bilberberg says so within the next three years it happened
[1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:02.640]  he said three years ago they're going to pop the subprime mortgage
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:08.000]  and implode the derivatives crisis to bring in their world government
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:12.960]  it happened two years later he said george bush is going to come out and
[1:37:12.960 --> 1:37:15.680]  endorse the kieto protocol and global warming
[1:37:15.680 --> 1:37:21.120]  everybody laughed at him a month later bush did it
[1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:25.600]  why because the bilberberg group is the 125
[1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:28.480]  most powerful people in the world they've got other steering meetings and
[1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:30.480]  things they engage in that's all they do is fly around
[1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:33.920]  micromanaging everything people say well why do they fly around well the
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:37.840]  mafia doesn't talk over the telephone they do it in person
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:40.880]  they've already got their system and operation running they just fine tune
[1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:43.280]  things like a mafia commission meeting
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:47.040]  and as a joining us is jim talker
[1:37:47.040 --> 1:37:50.320]  and we carry his book at info wars dot com by the way on

[1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:17.040]  steer park resort they met there in 1993 they're going
[1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:23.120]  back this year may fourteen seventeen
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:26.160]  okay if you talk to any of your sources do you know what's on the agenda this
[1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:30.000]  time uh... yes uh... two people involved in
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:33.760]  international finance uh... believe that the
[1:38:33.760 --> 1:38:36.320]  bilberbergs are going to celebrate that is
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:39.440]  celebrate the economic crisis which they made
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:43.760]  very well it helped generate by the purpose of
[1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:48.960]  creating uh board global uh power to international organizations like the
[1:38:48.960 --> 1:38:52.240]  IMF world bank sort of makes them a net
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:58.320]  of global treasure department uh...
[1:38:58.320 --> 1:39:01.920]  and of course their regular agenda is always
[1:39:01.920 --> 1:39:07.280]  the same as far as uh evolving the united nations into
[1:39:07.280 --> 1:39:13.040]  a world government which in to some extent it is now
[1:39:13.040 --> 1:39:16.480]  well jim talker i want to stop you right there
[1:39:16.480 --> 1:39:22.480]  uh... now now now please be be very very specific
[1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:28.880]  for the listeners okay for the folks out there listening
[1:39:28.880 --> 1:39:32.720]  be very very specific
[1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:36.400]  okay specifically i think the listeners are aware that we're in an
[1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:41.600]  economic crisis worldwide the bilberberg people
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:46.800]  may very well have created this crisis themselves for their own selfish purposes
[1:39:46.800 --> 1:39:50.400]  they're going to explode it for their own selfish purposes
[1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:55.280]  it will give them more muscle to generate a type of
[1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:02.640]  uh the world uh treasury department another wing of the united nations
[1:40:02.640 --> 1:40:07.520]  to uh so not still another significant step closer
[1:40:07.520 --> 1:40:12.000]  to a world government which the un is effectively become
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:16.480]  anyway with the uh now that nato years ago but
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:20.720]  in fact on the occasion their 50th anniversary 10 years ago
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:24.720]  nato celebrate its role as the un standing army
[1:40:24.720 --> 1:40:27.040]  you could even read that in the washington post is two different
[1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:31.840]  paragraphs one on page one and one deep inside on their
[1:40:31.840 --> 1:40:35.120]  nato story because the celebration of 50th was in
[1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:39.120]  martian dc it was a big story locally and worldwide
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:43.440]  and a one paragraph they uh celebrate the fact that
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:47.120]  first time nato forces fired a shot in anger
[1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:52.960]  it was in coast above uh not according as their charter dictates in defense
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:57.120]  of western europe against the potential service attack
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:00.960]  then uh laid down deep in the story on the
[1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:06.400]  side where the story had jumped uh they quoted the uh one of the heads of state
[1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:10.560]  is saying that of course nato would only uh
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:14.800]  sentence military to uh areas as directed by
[1:41:14.800 --> 1:41:18.240]  the un you put the two paragraphs together
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:22.560]  and nato's for 10 years has been the standing army of the united nations
[1:41:22.560 --> 1:41:29.120]  it will go anywhere in the world on the orders of the un security council
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:33.520]  and of course they're also working on eliminating
[1:41:33.520 --> 1:41:40.160]  local currency the uh the uh dollar is to come in the mario is
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:44.480]  nastic span throughout the western hemisphere and it involves them to a
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:47.600]  in american union similar to the european union
[1:41:47.600 --> 1:41:51.680]  jim will stop right there for a moment let's walk through this for the second
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:55.280]  i want to go back uh going back to
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:59.760]  almost three years ago bill berg 2006 we're in the bar i'm interviewing you
[1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:02.720]  in daniel estolin with your bill berg sources inside
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:07.040]  danie and you talk about how they're planning an engineered collapse
[1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:11.360]  uh of the subprime mortgage to bring the world to its knees so they can
[1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:14.880]  consolidate now we fast forward to the eve
[1:42:14.880 --> 1:42:21.440]  of uh a bill berg group meeting uh in 2009 three years later
[1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:27.360]  specifically your sources the intel it's confirmed by george soros
[1:42:27.360 --> 1:42:31.520]  and others bragging that the oil crisis is contrived lower the price to bankrupt
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:35.440]  their enemies he also told uh a bunch of newspapers
[1:42:35.440 --> 1:42:39.120]  that hey i'm having a great crisis this is the culmination of my life
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:42.080]  we're getting all this power and control out of imploding the economy
[1:42:42.080 --> 1:42:45.920]  so they're openly bragging that they love what's happening and that they
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:49.280]  helped engineer it specifically though jim tucker
[1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:53.280]  uh you're saying bill berg is going to celebrate
[1:42:53.280 --> 1:42:58.320]  the fact that uh the crisis is bringing in their new world order
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:01.440]  uh yes that's according as i said to two people
[1:43:01.440 --> 1:43:04.320]  heavily involved in international finance and
[1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:08.000]  you are uh intimately aware of bill berg
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.080]  i wish i could name the sources out loud for obvious reasons i cannot
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:15.200]  no no we understand you you're proving your sources are impeccable
[1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:18.400]  uh jim i mean we've gone from them saying bill berg didn't exist to them
[1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:21.120]  now having a minute what is it like to go
[1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:25.600]  from the point of this was denied you were insane you were schizophrenic
[1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:29.280]  uh there was no such thing as a global elite much less a bill berg group
[1:43:29.280 --> 1:43:33.760]  with the media covering it up to now it's getting more and more attention
[1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:38.080]  well it's been a process over the years it was that i believe in health thinking
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:42.960]  maybe 13 years ago that we found out where bill berg is going to be
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:46.240]  situated uh the way they're going to meet and
[1:43:46.240 --> 1:43:49.440]  win quite early that year i think november or something
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:53.280]  so we had an advanced story in spotlight the uh grand
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:57.520]  pappy of american free press and our european readers of which
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:01.280]  circulation is limited of course in europe because the high cost of postage
[1:44:01.280 --> 1:44:06.000]  and so forth so one uh subscriptions like to be shared by 20 people
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.480]  so our readers in uh health thinking but back this is all about snail mail
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:16.080]  saying should we alert the local media and we said yes and i should
[1:44:16.080 --> 1:44:20.240]  have thought about years earlier and when bill berg the kids got off
[1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:24.640]  airplanes at the airport in hell sticky
[1:44:24.640 --> 1:44:27.680]  heading for their helicopters and limousines it would take them to sort
[1:44:27.680 --> 1:44:32.240]  about 30 miles out they were stunned to see cameras flashing
[1:44:32.240 --> 1:44:35.680]  reporters with padded hot little fist screening questions
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:42.960]  and since then the european uh media broadcast tv video and newspapers and
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:46.240]  news magazines have been all over bill berg
[1:44:46.240 --> 1:44:49.120]  i'm talking about major daily newspapers from london
[1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  and uh paris and elsewhere i'll give page one heavy
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:45:00.880]  treatment and uh they work very hard out there widely
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:04.480]  known in europe but the blackout is still 100 percent
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:08.560]  in the united states with the exception of course of american free press
[1:45:08.560 --> 1:45:12.320]  and as you observed at the meeting in chantilly a few years ago
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:15.840]  the uh independent press like the independent small
[1:45:15.840 --> 1:45:19.200]  newspaper is independently owned in small town
[1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:23.280]  our independently owned radio station or tv station
[1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:26.880]  we had quite a number of those people turned out from bill berg in chantilly
[1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:30.560]  but you never see the new york times washington post valley times
[1:45:30.560 --> 1:45:34.560]  or in the wire services because they have attended these meetings
[1:45:34.560 --> 1:45:38.240]  and made to bear oath of secrecy
[1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:43.680]  uh jim you like you said there's still almost a complete media blackout
[1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:46.640]  here in the united states but we are starting to actually see a few articles
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:49.680]  about bill berg but now they're saying oh we don't really
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:55.280]  run anything and then wikipedia deletes the uh bill berg account and then they
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:45:58.640]  say it doesn't exist just like they say new order doesn't exist because it's cia
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:03.840]  iran and they also um deleted the bill berg list
[1:46:03.840 --> 1:46:08.800]  from uh 2008 in chantilly saying that even though bill berg released that they
[1:46:08.800 --> 1:46:11.920]  couldn't prove that was theirs so it didn't exist either
[1:46:11.920 --> 1:46:16.880]  so so we have this crazy paradox where world governments being admitted now
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:20.720]  by the globalist themselves time magazine newsweek announcing new world
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:24.240]  order bank of the world to control the planet regulate every facet of our
[1:46:24.240 --> 1:46:27.040]  lives but then we still have some pockets of
[1:46:27.040 --> 1:46:31.520]  media saying no it does not exist and we have all these federal
[1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:34.960]  myack reports and others saying we're insane
[1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:38.960]  and dangerous terrorist if we believe in a global elite
[1:46:38.960 --> 1:46:43.040]  well uh shock that people republican you might be considered terrorist
[1:46:43.040 --> 1:46:46.480]  well we'll have more of this next edition of the newspaper where
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:50.080]  of the of the government's report saying that uh
[1:46:50.080 --> 1:46:55.920]  conservatives and right wingers are uh terrorist threats along with the
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:00.160]  child molesters oh and veterans veterans too it just says all the veterans are
[1:47:00.160 --> 1:47:04.160]  terrorists yeah yeah we'll have a be reporting on this next
[1:47:04.160 --> 1:47:09.600]  on that in this next issue uh not directly related to bill berg of course
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:13.120]  but you're talking about how involved in this country it was the
[1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:18.560]  late great westbrook peckler who first reported in two columns in 1957 bill
[1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:24.160]  berg's first meeting under the name bill berg was in 1954
[1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:27.760]  before they got their name at the bill berg hotel no no i mean i know and we put
[1:47:27.760 --> 1:47:31.280]  that in in game we give him coming i know i understand that he did two reports on
[1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:34.480]  it but it's jim it's you that follow him around for 30 plus years
[1:47:34.480 --> 1:47:39.280]  and broke it out of the popular culture well uh yes peckler did not use term
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:43.040]  bill berg he did not did not know that's why they call himself he just
[1:47:43.040 --> 1:47:47.200]  addressed a great length the matter of the world
[1:47:47.200 --> 1:47:51.360]  famous distinguished men from around all over europe the united states meeting
[1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:54.640]  in secret and raised the questions why would they meet in secret what he
[1:47:54.640 --> 1:47:58.880]  was up to now jim can you speak to us
[1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:02.880]  we had people going before congress in the early 50s
[1:48:02.880 --> 1:48:05.520]  when people going before congress and saying there's a thing called lakosa
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:09.200]  nostra the mafia they meet in secret commission meetings
[1:48:09.200 --> 1:48:14.480]  in farmhouses and and remote areas they control the united states they make
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:17.040]  billions of dollars a year they've paid off the police
[1:48:17.040 --> 1:48:20.240]  and the judges and then the guy on their payroll
[1:48:20.240 --> 1:48:23.920]  comes out at the fbi director and says it's a conspiracy theory
[1:48:23.920 --> 1:48:28.240]  there is no such thing as organized crime and then then that's the same thing
[1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:31.840]  you were saying hey here's the real organized crime
[1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:36.000]  here's the real uh wasp and israeli mafia and others meeting
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:39.760]  it's called the bill berg group and they just said no just like
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:43.120]  uh you know the fbi director said no it doesn't exist
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:46.720]  because once you exist there's once you admit there's a mafia
[1:48:46.720 --> 1:48:50.000]  then you've got to talk about it can you can make the parallel between denying
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:53.440]  there was a mafia which people would laugh at now today
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:58.080]  towards all uh denying that there was a global lead
[1:48:58.080 --> 1:49:02.720]  well uh certainly i remember uh pointing out to fbi agents who were helping
[1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:06.400]  the guard building from european place i think germany some years ago
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:09.360]  along with their own but you've been there you know how they have
[1:49:09.360 --> 1:49:13.680]  sometimes the military deployed in european countries but uh a host of arms
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:17.360]  in uniform guards backed up by plain clothes guards
[1:49:17.360 --> 1:49:21.680]  this case backed up by the fbi and i explained to the fbi man
[1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.920]  that the uh americans meeting at this meeting
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:31.200]  uh were criminals they were uh there is violation of the uh logon act
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:36.720]  and uh they said uh yes they could not arrest them on foreign soil
[1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:40.560]  so i said well next time they north america you can come out and grab them
[1:49:40.560 --> 1:49:44.080]  but uh oh sure they know they exist because they're
[1:49:44.080 --> 1:49:47.440]  they're the fbi was there to guard them along with
[1:49:47.440 --> 1:49:51.920]  uh secret servicemen from the uh uh uniform secret servicemen and plain
[1:49:51.920 --> 1:49:55.440]  clothes secret servicemen uh they're not they're not there
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:49:59.280]  they're you know people often talk about fb
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:05.440]  why i believe in a conspiracy theory and i say i don't uh report on conspiracy
[1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:09.440]  theories i report on conspiracy facts and anyway
[1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:15.360]  you can define the wedstreet defines conspiracy bill berg meets the definition
[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:19.120]  oh they absolutely do even if you want to say they do good work and we should all
[1:50:19.120 --> 1:50:22.480]  be grateful uh we have done marshal volunteers should be grateful if you
[1:50:22.480 --> 1:50:26.960]  want to take that absurd view you still have to acknowledge conspiracy
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:30.800]  but see if they can play the game uh like
[1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:38.240]  the fbi did and say mafia doesn't exist organized crime doesn't exist
[1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:43.440]  uh then you can just neutralize the whole debate
[1:50:43.440 --> 1:50:49.360]  and the childlike public says okay bad men don't exist there's no organized crime
[1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:53.600]  just like they deny the government brings in most the drugs oh no no no no no
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:57.120]  when it's documented fact jim talk or stay there i want to come back and talk

[2:00:46.960 --> 2:00:49.200]  the globalist and the feds are oppressive and
[2:00:49.200 --> 2:00:52.240]  we're going to declare 10th amendment sovereignty
[2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:56.080]  fox news is talking about the new world order cnn is talking about the new world
[2:00:56.080 --> 2:01:00.000]  order and populism i mean what is it like for you to be a
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.320]  patriot anti-new world order for 40-something years and now see
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:08.080]  as the new world order is openly announced uh more and more people are
[2:01:08.080 --> 2:01:11.760]  having to uh you know having to admit it's real
[2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:15.200]  yes non-dare call it bill berg but i'm glad to see
[2:01:15.200 --> 2:01:21.280]  uh the public become more aware of these international intrigues
[2:01:21.280 --> 2:01:25.600]  in fact bill berg's been on the loose again for some time now we have
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:30.480]  calls to celebrate i mean they years ago they bill berg assured themselves i
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:36.080]  think it's about uh 1980 something that would have the american union
[2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:39.760]  in place fully in place by the year 2000 is that approach they had to set the
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:44.000]  goal back a little bit and now back still further
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:47.760]  the uh public becomes outraged when they become
[2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:50.800]  aware of it you just mentioned some of the indications that they are aware of
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:54.400]  it uh your governor who attended bill berg made
[2:01:54.400 --> 2:01:58.240]  all of his promises uh he's buckling under public pressure
[2:01:58.240 --> 2:02:06.400]  so uh and you've also seen uh increasing just disturbs bill berg very
[2:02:06.400 --> 2:02:09.680]  much uh increasing popularity of so-called
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:16.720]  protectionism where uh we equalize uh traded the water's edge
[2:02:16.720 --> 2:02:23.120]  where you cannot where uh americans are saying do not dump on us
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:28.560]  uh but the summary talk about bringing back the smooth holly
[2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:33.280]  uh act which will see jim jim that's the intel we're getting is
[2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:38.000]  the bankers said okay we're not able to ban their guns yet we're not able to
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:43.040]  legalize all the illegals yet let's fully destroy the economies of the west
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:46.880]  then the people will be so bankrupt they'll just be glad they're not starving
[2:02:46.880 --> 2:02:50.960]  in the street like argentina and then they'll go along with our orders
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:55.440]  and so basically they're just destroying the entire economy
[2:02:55.440 --> 2:02:59.520]  out of spite to try to get their world government through this crisis
[2:02:59.520 --> 2:03:06.720]  uh yes that's certainly true but uh i'm sorry go ahead uh but again
[2:03:06.720 --> 2:03:11.120]  there these are uh acts of uh desperation when they
[2:03:11.120 --> 2:03:13.920]  set these goals and they're unable to meet these goals
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:20.240]  and they see uh arises these and nationalism which is a dirty word
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:24.640]  to billberg their citizens of the world as as your president calls himself a
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:28.640]  citizen of the world uh obama of course as you know is a
[2:03:28.640 --> 2:03:32.320]  uh billberg recruit and all presidents
[2:03:32.320 --> 2:03:36.240]  have had uh since i've been there i've had had somebody attend billberg
[2:03:36.240 --> 2:03:40.080]  meetings for the white house report back of what the president's uh new orders
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:46.480]  are for this uh for the coming year so uh
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:51.360]  obama calls himself a citizen of the world he uh
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:55.520]  talks to the users and redistributing the wealth as much as carl marx ever did
[2:03:55.520 --> 2:04:00.960]  he thought about redistributing your wealth uh to people who do not work
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:04.320]  people are too lazy to work to illegal aliens who
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:09.200]  uh a family of four on average needs uh more than four thousand dollars a year

[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:18.400]  busy jim i wanted to finish up we've got builderberg 2009
[2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:22.320]  coming up now just keep going back to this it's such a big deal you have sources
[2:12:22.320 --> 2:12:24.400]  inside builderberg we'll just leave it at that
[2:12:24.400 --> 2:12:28.080]  excellent match he has builderberg group members
[2:12:28.080 --> 2:12:32.480]  but i don't want to say much more than that uh this is just off the charts
[2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:35.520]  amazing that that that these bastards are going to be
[2:12:35.520 --> 2:12:38.560]  celebrating the the economic collapse which is
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:41.680]  they're then hoarding all the bailout money they get through our governments
[2:12:41.680 --> 2:12:45.440]  they control and you think this hoax is going to be able to continue on i mean
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:49.040]  this is a very arrogant and bold move by them
[2:12:49.040 --> 2:12:52.800]  uh no because as we mentioned earlier public
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:56.240]  awareness is increasing even if politicians they're not used the word
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:12:59.680]  builderberg their force as your governor was to acknowledge
[2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:06.960]  that there is a problem and we must face it we have uh
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:14.160]  we've seen so many uh examples of it being reported not with term builder not
[2:13:14.160 --> 2:13:17.440]  used in the national media news sites and broadcast
[2:13:17.440 --> 2:13:21.920]  uh statements the awareness is growing and politicians are scared
[2:13:21.920 --> 2:13:25.120]  they're even talking about uh what builderberg denounces
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:29.600]  is protectionism nationalism is builderberg acknowledges is on the
[2:13:29.600 --> 2:13:32.640]  increase and a nationalist is a horrible thing
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:36.480]  the builderberg view so and as i mentioned earlier
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:40.720]  uh they're far behind their own timetable for a world government
[2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:45.280]  so i think they're uh they're ultimately going to fail
[2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:50.000]  but the trouble is uh the united americans are not fighting back hard enough
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:53.440]  like the europeans are fighting back and uh
[2:13:53.440 --> 2:14:00.160]  european men still refuses to join the european unions uh
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:04.960]  common currency they still keep the pound uh they refuse to surrender sovereignty
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:08.240]  further sovereignty to the european union and
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:14.960]  there's uh demands throughout the european union member states
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:20.720]  are uh less power by the european union and more sovereignty
[2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:24.000]  all the time the united states we're not fighting back is
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:29.200]  hard and that's why certain bad things could still happen even if builderberg
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:34.400]  is on the ropes for example if we join the uh
[2:14:34.400 --> 2:14:40.080]  world court if obama wants to we've surrendered a great deal of sovereignty
[2:14:40.080 --> 2:14:43.680]  we'll never get back because of the uh
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:47.120]  international criminal court and the world court are both
[2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:50.640]  uh would both be similar the superior superior
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:54.400]  to our own united states supreme court and tragically
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:58.960]  uh recently the party justice saturday o'connor
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:03.280]  is among those who advocate our uh surrounding sovereignty to the
[2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:06.800]  international criminal court they are uh
[2:15:06.800 --> 2:15:12.800]  sadly uh uh the son of uh the district director
[2:15:12.800 --> 2:15:17.600]  senate of uh of the supreme court justice and
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:20.080]  president of the united states william howard tapped
[2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:24.320]  and uh his son robert the late robert tasked a great
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:28.160]  uh american first senator from a how
[2:15:28.160 --> 2:15:33.440]  of the the latest robert tapped the fourth is all far
[2:15:33.440 --> 2:15:36.960]  surrounding our sovereignty to the international criminal court
[2:15:36.960 --> 2:15:40.080]  they just had a press conference in washington demanding
[2:15:40.080 --> 2:15:43.920]  that we uh join the criminal court international criminal court
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:47.920]  just a few days ago and that means for those that don't know
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:52.320]  fully adopting the european system of guilty until proven innocent
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:55.920]  getting rid of juries having tribunals and we've had supreme court
[2:15:55.920 --> 2:16:00.000]  justices in time magazine uh in u.s.a. today
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:03.120]  come right out and say oh we take our orders now
[2:16:03.120 --> 2:16:07.040]  uh from the higher court from the international criminal court so this
[2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:11.120]  process is happening uh yes i'll sit around there those uh
[2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:15.040]  pools will sit around the supreme court chambers and talk about talk openly
[2:16:15.040 --> 2:16:19.200]  about how uh we certainly should look to uh
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:24.480]  uh the decisions made by far and court and applying
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:28.640]  constitutional law to united states that's absurd on its face
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:31.520]  and one of the strongest patriots of the supreme court
[2:16:31.520 --> 2:16:37.200]  is uh clarence thomas who although he is himself enigmas hated by
[2:16:37.200 --> 2:16:43.120]  liberals for opposing uh affirmative action there even
[2:16:43.120 --> 2:16:50.720]  is them for uh uh racial preferences all right well

[2:18:00.160 --> 2:18:03.840]  from noon because we normally have our as you rule a call from your experience
[2:18:03.840 --> 2:18:08.640]  we have our pool meeting uh in the evenings no i know but see we're live
[2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:13.920]  11 we're live 11 to 3 p.m so i guess it was a seven-hour difference in the
[2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:20.320]  Mediterranean in that zone in Greece that uh i could have you on it like 11
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:23.440]  and then that would be uh at six o'clock
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:27.280]  uh i mean that's how we've had to do it in the past i guess i could record the
[2:18:27.280 --> 2:18:30.720]  interviews to our how about 2 p.m uh brief time with
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:34.400]  uh those still be within your nighttime frame wasn't it

[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:41.840]  we'll figure it out jim regardless regardless regardless uh
[2:18:41.840 --> 2:18:45.280]  yeah i know you have your pool reports going on there but it's always
[2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.560]  breaking news on what's coming up in the next year because these people really
[2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:52.320]  do run the planet jim talker thank you so much you're welcome
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:57.120]  all right we'll talk to you soon you know one of my pet peeves
[2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:00.400]  is people not knowing what words mean in semantics because i know i'm going to
[2:19:00.400 --> 2:19:05.360]  get emails from ignorant people remember robin page who we had on bbc
[2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:09.680]  reporter was in the bbc news he did a report on rural affairs and he gave a
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:13.600]  speech saying rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and
[2:19:13.600 --> 2:19:17.040]  muslims he was arrested when the british police
[2:19:17.040 --> 2:19:20.800]  five years ago said the word homosexual is a hate word
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:24.720]  now heterosexual homosexual that's just a scientific name
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:29.920]  for your sexual preference that's the same thing with anglo negro and i was
[2:19:29.920 --> 2:19:33.760]  watching a documentary about the fifties and sixties civil rights movement
[2:19:33.760 --> 2:19:36.560]  and it showed the black folks saying we demand to be called
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:40.720]  that and then nowadays the public's so ignorant somebody uses the old-fashioned
[2:19:40.720 --> 2:19:43.120]  term and then they all freak out that but
[2:19:43.120 --> 2:19:46.480]  see that shows how screwed up the public is they don't care if the government
[2:19:46.480 --> 2:19:51.520]  funds hiv and black folks vaccines it's just don't use a scientific term i just
[2:19:51.520 --> 2:19:54.400]  wanted to add that before i get emails you need to learn not to be so ignorant
[2:19:54.400 --> 2:20:02.480]  out there well they're right back folks stay with us
[2:20:02.480 --> 2:20:06.240]  with our economy spiraling out of control living in the soup kitchens
[2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:09.840]  maybe right around the corner no one saw the financial collapse of
[2:20:09.840 --> 2:20:13.600]  1929 many didn't make it and millions ended up in
[2:20:13.600 --> 2:20:17.200]  soup lines becoming vagrants begging for food
[2:20:17.200 --> 2:20:20.960]  unlike 1929 we can see this collapse coming
[2:20:20.960 --> 2:20:25.200]  we have been warned and right now we have a very small window of opportunity to
[2:20:25.200 --> 2:20:29.840]  get food storage into our homes before it's too late too late why is the
[2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:33.520]  canadian government telling their citizens to stock up why and why are
[2:20:33.520 --> 2:20:36.880]  soldiers calling home telling their families to get food storage
[2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:40.960]  supplies are running low having food storage today may be just as important

[2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:05.120]  today in the new world order is war against humanity
[2:21:05.120 --> 2:21:09.680]  barack obama is the tip of the spear we've got to have a civilian national
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:12.400]  security force that's just as powerful
[2:21:12.400 --> 2:21:16.960]  just as strong just as well funded the obama deception
[2:21:16.960 --> 2:21:20.800]  completely destroys the myth that obama is working for the best interest of the
[2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:24.560]  american people while obama's already fudging yeah fudged
[2:21:24.560 --> 2:21:28.880]  since day one in this election if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass
[2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:32.640]  movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program
[2:21:32.640 --> 2:21:36.640]  of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs
[2:21:36.640 --> 2:21:41.520]  that's fascism it's not about left or right it's about a one world government
[2:21:41.520 --> 2:21:46.480]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told
[2:21:46.480 --> 2:21:51.120]  and his real agenda get your copy of the obama deception today

[2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:04.400]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal
[2:22:04.400 --> 2:22:07.440]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[2:22:07.440 --> 2:22:11.280]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[2:22:11.280 --> 2:22:14.480]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[2:22:14.480 --> 2:22:17.120]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means
[2:22:17.120 --> 2:22:21.040]  only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[2:22:21.040 --> 2:22:24.960]  deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to ensure
[2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:28.240]  deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[2:22:28.240 --> 2:22:31.920]  a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:35.600]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:38.960]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:42.560]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative
[2:22:42.560 --> 2:22:46.880]  portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[2:22:46.880 --> 2:22:50.080]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt
[2:22:50.080 --> 2:22:53.440]  gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years

[2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:27.200]  is on the verge of passing a tenth amendment slash ninth amendment
[2:24:27.200 --> 2:24:31.040]  reaffirmation of the bill of rights constitution
[2:24:31.040 --> 2:24:34.640]  south the cut has passed it a bunch of other states are in the process of
[2:24:34.640 --> 2:24:38.160]  passing it and see all of you out there said oh it won't do any good oh it won't
[2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:43.440]  help you won't get this past jones and then oh
[2:24:43.440 --> 2:24:47.200]  well even if it passes they won't enforce it it's all part of a process a
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:50.400]  reawakening to our liberties and freedoms
[2:24:50.400 --> 2:24:55.120]  it's just one more solution and also when the feds put out these reports saying
[2:24:55.120 --> 2:24:58.480]  gun owners or terrorists veterans or terrorists people that love freedom or
[2:24:58.480 --> 2:25:02.400]  bad well we just rebuke how bad this is and expose
[2:25:02.400 --> 2:25:06.560]  what a fraud it is i mean we got to be in the fight
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:09.680]  not just sit here and say it's too big we don't have any power the truth is we
[2:25:09.680 --> 2:25:13.040]  do have a lot of power to the point of bill deberg group new world order
[2:25:13.040 --> 2:25:16.800]  crony busy handing over the roads and power plants to the bill deberg group
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:21.520]  that's on record uh rick perry has to come out and camouflage himself
[2:25:21.520 --> 2:25:26.000]  like he's one of us and you know if he's forced by political weight because the
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:28.960]  he's checked the vote remember a month and a half ago when i had state
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:33.680]  senators on people saying they hope rick perry would get on board
[2:25:33.680 --> 2:25:36.320]  well they're about to pass it the texas legislature so then
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:40.720]  he shows up and says it's his and now he'll control it i know he operates and
[2:25:40.720 --> 2:25:44.480]  try to make sure it doesn't really happen uh or that it's not enforced but
[2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:47.840]  regardless he's having to act like he's one of us
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:50.560]  just like glenn beckon others are and that shows
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:54.800]  we are taking the country back let's go ahead and show it here's the video
[2:25:54.800 --> 2:26:01.040]  and more importantly millions of texas just like yourself that are tired of
[2:26:01.040 --> 2:26:04.800]  washington dc trying to come down here and tell us
[2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:16.960]  how to run texas
[2:26:16.960 --> 2:26:19.600]  i happen to think this is a pretty bold step
[2:26:19.600 --> 2:26:25.840]  hcr is uh as introduced by representative creighton co-authored by
[2:26:25.840 --> 2:26:30.400]  representative ginn is a bipartisan piece of legislation
[2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:35.520]  uh it concerns all texas it concerns all americans
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:42.800]  tenth amendment was enacted by folks who remembered what it was like to have
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:45.840]  a very oppressive government to be under the thumb
[2:26:45.840 --> 2:26:50.160]  of tyrants and an all powerful government
[2:26:50.160 --> 2:26:54.800]  unfortunately the protection hit pause i mean that is too incredible
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:58.240]  and we know what it's like to be under the thumb of tyrants
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:01.680]  man i i've met rick perry i know rick perry he does not normally talk with
[2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:04.480]  that big of a texas accent i mean this is deep
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:08.320]  the i would call that a far west texas accent
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:11.280]  almost and he from south texas point is
[2:27:11.280 --> 2:27:17.520]  our thumb tyrants tyrants back it up he can get him
[2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:22.960]  hardly understand tyrants none of the oppressive thumb
[2:27:22.960 --> 2:27:27.360]  tyrants i like that though at least they're talking about the oppressive
[2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:30.960]  thumb of tyrants now because again we are becoming the
[2:27:30.960 --> 2:27:35.200]  mainstream the government is tyrannical here it is
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:40.720]  tenth amendment was enacted by folks who remembered what it was like
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:44.800]  to have a very oppressive government to be under the
[2:27:44.800 --> 2:27:49.760]  thumb of tyrants and an all powerful government
[2:27:49.760 --> 2:27:54.160]  unfortunately the protections it guarantees
[2:27:54.160 --> 2:27:58.080]  have melted away over the course of the years
[2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:01.360]  you're probably familiar with that old
[2:28:01.360 --> 2:28:06.320]  adage about how to boil a frog you know you just get him to sit there in that
[2:28:06.320 --> 2:28:10.480]  pot you turn up the heat a little bit by a little bit before you know it
[2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:14.960]  the frog doesn't realize it but he's done
[2:28:14.960 --> 2:28:19.040]  and uh... since the united states constitution
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.360]  stop again i gotta imitate this how many times have i done the frog in the pot

[2:28:51.200 --> 2:28:54.400]  getting the feedback they're learning they know about the new world order now
[2:28:54.400 --> 2:28:56.880]  they know about everything they know about everything we stole
[2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:01.040]  they know i took money from merc knowing that vaccine killed people so we get
[2:29:01.040 --> 2:29:04.800]  vaccine damage federal funding because if i make it mandatory

[2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:18.400]  missus newt we took a little bacon and we took
[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:21.600]  a little beans and we caught the bloody british in a town in the world and we had
[2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:24.800]  a rigged ferry with us and the british kept becoming
[2:33:24.800 --> 2:33:29.200]  there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and they
[2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:31.680]  began to run it on down to mississippi to the
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:35.360]  and then what happened is rick perry was with the redcoats
[2:33:35.360 --> 2:33:39.440]  we looked and he ran behind a bush took his red coat off and put one of our
[2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:42.480]  uniforms on he ran out hey i'm with you guys
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:46.240]  we need to fight the tyrants we don't be like that frog
[2:33:46.240 --> 2:33:51.840]  pretty soon cooking in that hot boy there wasn't as many as there was a while ago
[2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:55.760]  it's all a big aqua perry the whole texas thing just like the bush
[2:33:55.760 --> 2:34:02.080]  and it really gets old we looked down the river
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:06.720]  i gotta watch it if i go into hickland i'm actually somewhat of a hick i'll
[2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:10.640]  actually revert
[2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:16.160]  start talking like uh granny clamp it you get you in there and get me some
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:22.560]  possums get the fried pan out there jeff roe
[2:34:22.560 --> 2:34:28.240]  gee granny i guess so i guess rick perry's on our side then
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:38.800]  oh man hi i'm really out of control today
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:42.000]  well everything is going to hell in a hand basket so i might as well have some
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:45.600]  fun with it let's be serious and i'm going to your calls
[2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:49.440]  back it up and let's just hear what rick perry had to say
[2:34:49.440 --> 2:34:53.440]  unedited without me stopping and laughing okay but i mean here he is
[2:34:53.440 --> 2:34:55.680]  playing his good old boy i mean i'm surprised
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:34:58.560]  he wouldn't want to kill a boy hat a big belt buckle going
[2:34:58.560 --> 2:35:05.360]  uh but the point is is that that's fake and all the rest of its fake but the
[2:35:05.360 --> 2:35:09.440]  reason this is important is this globalist involved in everything hard
[2:35:09.440 --> 2:35:11.760]  for the new world order i mean he's been the builder bird
[2:35:11.760 --> 2:35:14.080]  normally if a governor's invited to that means they're planning to make him
[2:35:14.080 --> 2:35:17.440]  president later he's doing this now because he knows
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:21.280]  which way the wind is blowing this will be a betrayal make no mistake but it
[2:35:21.280 --> 2:35:25.680]  means still that we're forcing them to at least talk the talk
[2:35:25.680 --> 2:35:29.920]  that means we can make a lot of them walk the walk so let's go ahead and go to
[2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:34.480]  rick perry the incredible good old boy here he is
[2:35:34.480 --> 2:35:38.960]  representative ginn is a bipartisan piece of legislation
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:44.160]  uh it concerns all texans it concerns all americans
[2:35:44.160 --> 2:35:49.680]  tenth amendment was enacted by folks who remembered what it was like
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:54.480]  to have a very oppressive government to be under the thumb
[2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:58.800]  of tyrants and an all powerful government
[2:35:58.800 --> 2:36:03.120]  unfortunately the protections it guarantees
[2:36:03.120 --> 2:36:07.040]  have melted away over the course of the years
[2:36:07.040 --> 2:36:10.320]  you're probably familiar with that old
[2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:15.280]  adage about how to boil a frog you know you just get him to sit there in that
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:19.520]  pot and you turn up the heat a little bit by a little bit before you know it
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:24.000]  the frog doesn't realize it but he's done
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:30.720]  and since the united states constitution was ratified
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:34.960]  the federal government's been slowly kind of turning up the heat
[2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:39.200]  on the states if you will and they've eroded
[2:36:39.200 --> 2:36:45.600]  the notion of states rights the founding fathers understood that
[2:36:45.600 --> 2:36:54.560]  a one size approach doesn't work with the states when it comes to
[2:36:54.560 --> 2:37:00.560]  governing especially a country the size of of the united states
[2:37:00.560 --> 2:37:06.720]  and i promise you it doesn't work for texas our economic strength compared to
[2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:11.600]  the federal budget mess uh and and other problems
[2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:15.040]  that they've got up there is is a is a great example
[2:37:15.040 --> 2:37:19.040]  that texans know best how to govern texas
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:22.320]  we're proof that good things happen when
[2:37:22.320 --> 2:37:26.720]  government lowers taxes and lowers regulations that
[2:37:26.720 --> 2:37:30.880]  reduces spending encourages private sector growth
[2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:34.160]  and watch it all in info wars dot com and prison planner dot com
[2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:37.520]  steve wasans on a story for info wars dot net on it
[2:37:37.520 --> 2:37:42.560]  um meanwhile they've passed a state franchise tax that is a state income
[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:46.480]  tax they've passed all these other little taxes
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:49.920]  it's got to be every month some new tax bureaucrat shows up and forming me of a
[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:54.800]  new tax here at art of the office
[2:37:54.800 --> 2:37:58.400]  and the state of texas is under federal control
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:02.000]  the state police are brainwashed by the feds they're doing all sorts of urban
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:05.280]  warfare drills uh texas is going to hell in a hand
[2:38:05.280 --> 2:38:08.160]  basket rick perry's handing over the state
[2:38:08.160 --> 2:38:12.000]  paid for power plants roads infrastructure the bill de berg group
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:15.600]  he's tied in with people from bill de berg that have been indicted
[2:38:15.600 --> 2:38:19.680]  in foreign banks running scams in texas
[2:38:19.680 --> 2:38:29.200]  and he's going to prance around telling us about tyrants
[2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:32.720]  on record one time we had a reporter down at the capital and rick perry walks
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:35.680]  down they go hey governor perry it's alex jones here on the phone
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:39.040]  and he goes what are you doing you big old fat hog

[2:41:33.200 --> 2:41:37.120]  i don't know how i've got it but i'm just wondering if i should be taken though
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:40.960]  yeah antibiotics for that the interfere on because i'm where we said that
[2:41:40.960 --> 2:41:44.400]  they're you know sticking something else on me
[2:41:44.400 --> 2:41:47.200]  let me try to answer your question i appreciate your call matt look i'm not
[2:41:47.200 --> 2:41:51.840]  i can't practice medicine here and medicine is very complex and it also
[2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:56.160]  depends on the individual but i know what medical doctors have said
[2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:03.120]  we've gone from one case in 2004 of leprosy and no cases before
[2:42:03.120 --> 2:42:08.160]  that for decades to 7000 in 2005 2006 the next year
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:13.200]  you can pull these numbers up and then we haven't seen numbers since then
[2:42:13.200 --> 2:42:17.680]  we've gone i mean hepatitis everything's off the charts
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:21.040]  and you can get hepatitis from somebody making your you know your hamburger at a
[2:42:21.040 --> 2:42:25.360]  fast food place and in mexico they spray the
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:29.760]  farms with human feces and then people got hepatitis from that
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:35.760]  it's the third world food and then when they create the crisis of the
[2:42:35.760 --> 2:42:39.440]  salmonella and the and the and the hepatitis then they say oh
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:43.200]  we need to pass a law shutting down organic farming in the u.s
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:46.800]  but then having no regulations and all the stuff coming in from latin america
[2:42:46.800 --> 2:42:51.840]  so that's the biggest issue you can't get it from sexual partners things like
[2:42:51.840 --> 2:42:54.080]  that that's why they want to give everybody
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:57.520]  everybody at birth hepatitis shot and a lot of people shown evidence that it's
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:00.880]  actually giving people the hepatitis but there's a lot of stuff they've added
[2:43:00.880 --> 2:43:03.520]  to vaccines there's the factor eight blood
[2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:07.520]  drugs that people are given that have hiv and hepatitis in it
[2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:11.600]  so it's very very serious uh chip in michigan oh oh
[2:43:11.600 --> 2:43:14.560]  just to finish other question the interferon and all that there's a lot of
[2:43:14.560 --> 2:43:17.280]  studies a lot of experts a lot of doctors that say
[2:43:17.280 --> 2:43:19.920]  it's the
[2:43:20.720 --> 2:43:24.320]  drugs that supposedly treat you for hiv and other similar things
[2:43:24.320 --> 2:43:28.320]  that actually kill you quicker but whatever uh let's talk to chip in
[2:43:28.320 --> 2:43:32.160]  michigan chip you're on the air hey what's going on now
[2:43:32.160 --> 2:43:36.480]  doing a worldwide transmission welcome i know you don't have all the answers
[2:43:36.480 --> 2:43:39.520]  and i'm not looking for an answer i'm just looking for suggestion
[2:43:39.520 --> 2:43:43.760]  um my father and i we've watched certain videos yours
[2:43:43.760 --> 2:43:48.240]  a couple of yours and we read similar uh books
[2:43:48.240 --> 2:43:52.800]  um for the past jeez 15 years or so we're on kind of the same wavelength
[2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:56.480]  the other day i brought over the obama deception hot off the
[2:43:56.480 --> 2:44:00.320]  presses um as far as he's concerned and um
[2:44:00.320 --> 2:44:05.520]  normally we watch a video and he'll press pause we'll talk about it
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:08.960]  we'll continue watching he'll press pause periodically throughout the video and
[2:44:08.960 --> 2:44:12.160]  we'll discuss it during the obama deception he and
[2:44:12.160 --> 2:44:15.760]  press pause once he sat there with his mouth open and once in a while he'd say
[2:44:15.760 --> 2:44:21.440]  wow wow holy bleep afterwards his first comment to me
[2:44:21.440 --> 2:44:26.240]  was and and i want you to know that he's 68 he's retired
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:29.520]  so when he made this comment to me he was referring to
[2:44:29.520 --> 2:44:33.920]  himself and people in his quote unquote category
[2:44:33.920 --> 2:44:40.000]  being older and retired and heavily invested in this system
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:43.920]  his first comment to me was the only thing alex failed to mention was what
[2:44:43.920 --> 2:44:47.760]  we can do about it and i was wondering if you could uh just
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:52.000]  suggest something that i could tell him and people in his uh
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:56.000]  well the quote unquote category of retirement
[2:44:56.000 --> 2:44:59.440]  well that's a very important question uh but overall
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:03.280]  uh it's not hype when i say this film is particularly powerful
[2:45:03.280 --> 2:45:07.440]  because it's so timely it covers the master plan of the globalist the bankers
[2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:12.080]  the police state the grid and i think therein lies the solution
[2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:15.200]  we talk about states rights we talk about saying no to the feds
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:18.000]  we talk about criminally going after the bankers
[2:45:18.000 --> 2:45:22.400]  we talk about everyone getting involved uh in their own issues
[2:45:22.400 --> 2:45:25.760]  and saying no to the system i mean that it's full of solutions
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:28.800]  at the end i'm going to have more solutions in another film i'm making
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:33.120]  to come out in about two three months uh but
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:39.760]  i mean specifically the solution is not letting them carry out the next phase
[2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:43.760]  they took control of the government they bankrupted us they deindustrialized us
[2:45:43.760 --> 2:45:47.120]  they militarized the police they kidnapped over a million four hundred
[2:45:47.120 --> 2:45:50.880]  thousand children a year you know they engage in all these hard crimes
[2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:55.040]  we have to recognize that evil and take abortion
[2:45:55.040 --> 2:45:59.280]  no go out with a placard a dead baby sounds horrible looks terrible
[2:45:59.280 --> 2:46:02.640]  people get offended but just folks doing that
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:05.760]  has gone from around 50 of people being for abortion
[2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:09.680]  to not only about 25 percent in all the major polls so we're winning that fight
[2:46:09.680 --> 2:46:12.800]  the truth is if we just take and then you save babies right there
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:15.120]  uh men and women don't need to fight with each other
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:18.000]  we've been trained to do it in society if you get married and have kids
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:20.640]  you got to stick together because statistically it's going to hurt your
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:23.680]  children if you break up uh living well uh the best
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:26.880]  revenge is living well as the french say get along with your neighbors being
[2:46:26.880 --> 2:46:30.160]  informed enjoying life caring about other people
[2:46:30.160 --> 2:46:33.840]  i mean i love seeing healthy happy people i love seeing people do well
[2:46:33.840 --> 2:46:37.280]  i love seeing people uh you know who are creative
[2:46:37.280 --> 2:46:40.160]  and i thought everybody else was like me i didn't know that a lot of folks are
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:43.920]  like diseased mentally from madison avenue and they hate seeing other people
[2:46:43.920 --> 2:46:46.880]  do well you know i mean again we gotta get our
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:49.840]  head screwed on right and think tribally as a human
[2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:53.680]  society against the elites instead they all try to divide us off against each
[2:46:53.680 --> 2:46:58.000]  other uh and uh you know they they
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:01.360]  they're going to say do whatever we want with the bank of the world with
[2:47:01.360 --> 2:47:05.040]  regulation with federalization and we'll turn the economy back on
[2:47:05.040 --> 2:47:08.160]  then they're going to give you some of the money but then hyperinflate
[2:47:08.160 --> 2:47:11.760]  uh so and then as things get worse they're going to say oh you didn't do it
[2:47:11.760 --> 2:47:15.120]  we said that's why they got worse it's designed to get worse because things
[2:47:15.120 --> 2:47:19.760]  getting worse are better for them um your dad says what do you do
[2:47:19.760 --> 2:47:23.680]  about it call the state legislature go for
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:28.320]  tenth amendment resolutions uh educate local police and military
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:30.960]  just because your father and you know all about the stuff doesn't mean your
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:35.520]  neighbors your friends or family number one is education so people know the
[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:39.840]  ballgame they're in they know what they're facing they know their enemy
[2:47:39.840 --> 2:47:43.280]  okay so there's some solutions
[2:47:44.400 --> 2:47:49.280]  okay i get that i was just i'm looking for a practical thing he's looking at me
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:53.200]  and he's he's well sir sir there's no silver bullet there's no one thing i
[2:47:53.200 --> 2:47:56.560]  mean i can't say you go meet a leprechaun behind the barn and he's
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:01.040]  gonna you know he's gonna fix everything for you it's a process
[2:48:01.040 --> 2:48:04.400]  looking at my dad and i'm thinking well what can i what can i tell this guy he's
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:08.720]  got a good point he's retired he's heavily invested in the system and this
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:13.040]  kind of information obviously will and rightfully so
[2:48:13.040 --> 2:48:18.960]  totally shatter his reality i mean that's that would be everything to him
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:22.240]  the system is shattered the new world order built this current grid to get
[2:48:22.240 --> 2:48:26.400]  us decadent get us in debt get us under their control so that when they finally
[2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:29.440]  try to pull us down we don't swim for the surface
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:33.040]  we go ahead and go down with the hydro okay i'll go to the bottom with you
[2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:37.360]  it's the best system we've got you know they're destroying what they built
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:41.040]  before and bringing in their new world order
[2:48:41.040 --> 2:48:45.280]  right i mean they've got police it announcing you'll be arrested if you
[2:48:45.280 --> 2:48:48.960]  don't take vaccines and then having police dogs with thousands of kids crying
[2:48:48.960 --> 2:48:52.000]  being injected outside sports stadiums i mean
[2:48:52.000 --> 2:48:56.720]  you know people say well hitler you know the hitlerian system
[2:48:56.720 --> 2:49:00.240]  of 1938 i mean you know it looks like it's gonna get bad but it's the system
[2:49:00.240 --> 2:49:04.240]  i'm invested in i don't even claim to have all the answers but
[2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:09.520]  um people say well what do i do i mean i you know well you're smart what are
[2:49:09.520 --> 2:49:12.080]  you going to do
[2:49:12.080 --> 2:49:16.640]  well like i told you when i first called uh i'm not asking for an answer all
[2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:21.520]  i'm looking at this old man in the face and he wants to know what he can do
[2:49:21.520 --> 2:49:25.120]  obviously he's not going around the rallies he's not putting dvds on people's
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:29.760]  windshields and and why not you know listen i appreciate her call i got
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:33.280]  to say this
[2:49:33.280 --> 2:49:36.880]  there were people who were ship captains by the time they were 20
[2:49:36.880 --> 2:49:39.920]  because people you know needed to get their lives going
[2:49:39.920 --> 2:49:45.280]  uh you know people were considered men by the time they were 12 13 14 years old
[2:49:45.280 --> 2:49:48.400]  now they teach you so you're a kid have fun till college and oh don't worry
[2:49:48.400 --> 2:49:51.360]  about things party and have fun while you're in college you know you're a
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:55.120]  young person now trying to pay off your college debt get out there and make it
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:49:59.040]  first and then oh i'm too busy with my job and oh now i'm retired i'm not
[2:49:59.040 --> 2:50:02.720]  involved in politics it's a cop out
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:07.200]  number one you're not going to be fulfilled till you stand up to tyranny
[2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:10.560]  you were born to fight tyranny tyranny is always going to be there trying to eat
[2:50:10.560 --> 2:50:15.200]  your lunch trying to take over so we're meant to build better communities
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:18.320]  we're meant to be involved that's why the establishment creates
[2:50:18.320 --> 2:50:21.600]  counterfeits of that try to control things
[2:50:21.600 --> 2:50:25.680]  and you said well i i you said i wasn't asking for an answer
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:29.120]  you know kind of implying i didn't give you one
[2:50:29.120 --> 2:50:33.680]  you want a solution look in the mirror uh you know what is it when i get up here
[2:50:33.680 --> 2:50:37.440]  and expose federal documents saying the american people are terrorist
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:40.880]  that is a big solution exposing how out of control they are
[2:50:40.880 --> 2:50:45.280]  how tyrannical they are how the government is arraying itself to wage
[2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:51.120]  war with the people and announcing regular army will be used against us
[2:50:51.120 --> 2:50:57.120]  what is that that is tyranny so there's another solution
[2:50:57.120 --> 2:51:01.120]  expose their crimes what do the founders do committees of correspondence they
[2:51:01.120 --> 2:51:05.200]  exposed it the new world order beast is genetically
[2:51:05.200 --> 2:51:11.120]  modifying your food genetically modifying mixing vegetables with animals

[2:51:25.520 --> 2:51:31.200]  will eventually run out what then then

[2:54:52.000 --> 2:54:56.560]  indian but i also found a lot of the public
[2:54:56.560 --> 2:54:59.040]  and people that want to write books people that want to make films and people
[2:54:59.040 --> 2:55:05.120]  that want to do radio shows they'll talk and plan and have endless meetings and
[2:55:05.120 --> 2:55:11.440]  announce all these big wild ideas and then never put it into action
[2:55:11.440 --> 2:55:18.080]  i've made 22 films produced a couple others written a book published a book
[2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:23.840]  created a bunch of websites done tens of thousands of hours of radio
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:27.120]  traveled all over the country in the world confronting corruption and i'm
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:32.160]  not tuning my horn here i'm saying i've taken action

[2:55:42.320 --> 2:55:46.160]  and so i would just challenge people out there
[2:55:46.160 --> 2:55:51.280]  to stop spending your whole life saying what can i do what can i do and then
[2:55:51.280 --> 2:55:55.520]  well might add 69 he ain't gonna put dvds on windshields
[2:55:55.520 --> 2:56:00.800]  really at lexington and concord a large percentage in fact close to a third
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:03.840]  of the people were above 70 that fought the british
[2:56:03.840 --> 2:56:08.480]  there were 75 85 89 year old people out there blasting british now i'm not
[2:56:08.480 --> 2:56:11.120]  saying go out and blast people you know because i understand the founding
[2:56:11.120 --> 2:56:13.920]  fathers were terrorists and bad americas bad according to these federal
[2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:18.640]  reports my whole issue is is that they tell you
[2:56:18.640 --> 2:56:21.360]  you're old so it's your time to just enjoy yourself
[2:56:21.360 --> 2:56:25.120]  but watch tv and get all simmers direct link to it just sitting around all day
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:27.520]  watching tv or maybe you go play golf or you go
[2:56:27.520 --> 2:56:31.440]  fart around and play dominoes i mean that isn't living who told you your life
[2:56:31.440 --> 2:56:35.360]  doesn't matter now or you don't have value or nobody should hear from you
[2:56:35.360 --> 2:56:38.960]  plus young people are like ah shut up old man and then old folks are like
[2:56:38.960 --> 2:56:43.760]  ah shut up you dumb kids we're all together
[2:56:43.760 --> 2:56:46.960]  young folks are meant to hang out with old folks and old folks like to hang out
[2:56:46.960 --> 2:56:50.400]  with young folks see they've taken all the natural order of things
[2:56:50.400 --> 2:56:55.280]  and screwed them all up to all these young 18 year olds you know how boring
[2:56:55.280 --> 2:56:59.120]  it is to hang out with a bunch of 18 year old guys
[2:56:59.120 --> 2:57:02.320]  but it's interesting to hang around with some old korean war vet
[2:57:02.320 --> 2:57:06.080]  get them to talk about stories of people in foxholes or
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:12.240]  or or or women or you know i mean i mean that's who you want to hang out with
[2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:16.720]  who's just in there oh no i'm here hung out with old man the barrel
[2:57:16.720 --> 2:57:20.240]  i mean literally been around the world it's interesting
[2:57:20.240 --> 2:57:23.040]  that's where you get the knowledge you get it all boiled down instead you got
[2:57:23.040 --> 2:57:25.760]  all these old men who think they're lodged over they don't have anything to
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:29.680]  give now that they don't matter look i don't care if you're 10 years old or
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:34.160]  if you're 95 years old you got a job to do fighting corruption
[2:57:34.160 --> 2:57:38.160]  and you have value and you you have a job to do
[2:57:38.160 --> 2:57:42.080]  now i've already been ranting and i said i'd take phone calls and
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:45.920]  we got an economist coming up where's my bio sheet on what's happening and well

[3:03:08.240 --> 3:03:12.640]  country of huge dvd copiers which aren't even that expensive just copying
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:15.760]  copying copying and giving it to everybody and it's
[3:03:15.760 --> 3:03:18.240]  we're um this this film's been out for a month
[3:03:18.240 --> 3:03:22.400]  tens of millions of views online for free the thousands of dvds we've shipped
[3:03:22.400 --> 3:03:24.880]  out in the highest quality being copied everywhere
[3:03:24.880 --> 3:03:31.200]  it is explosive and then we've got these giant cdn servers
[3:03:31.200 --> 3:03:34.720]  and we've told listeners present planet dot tv members you can share it with
[3:03:34.720 --> 3:03:38.400]  six friends and family just tell them don't share it because then it'll
[3:03:38.400 --> 3:03:40.800]  bankrupt us or the servers will shut down
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:44.640]  i got a 40 000 bill or something for the overage
[3:03:44.640 --> 3:03:48.560]  yeah that's where that's where the video video
[3:03:48.560 --> 3:03:52.720]  you know the film sales go right back into the servers to pay to give it out
[3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:57.040]  and that's because the members we we let members give it out to like 10 people
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:02.800]  you know 10 uh people could enter the passcode and use it at any one time
[3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:07.440]  uh and they just shared it with everybody and
[3:04:07.440 --> 3:04:12.080]  it would just it really financial hardship on that end
[3:04:12.080 --> 3:04:15.840]  uh to have done that but that's when you know you get success when you're
[3:04:15.840 --> 3:04:19.840]  you know using what was it like 90 terabytes or something for the
[3:04:19.840 --> 3:04:23.680]  obama deception hey matt what wasn't 90 terabytes last
[3:04:23.680 --> 3:04:28.240]  month they don't even hear me out there 90 terabytes
[3:04:28.240 --> 3:04:35.120]  over 90 terabytes over 90 terabytes for folks in it you know what that means
[3:04:35.120 --> 3:04:40.800]  90 terabytes now that's serving a video out baby
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:45.440]  that is serving a video out and now you know it took me years just to get the
[3:04:45.440 --> 3:04:48.560]  money to have servers and people that could run them that
[3:04:48.560 --> 3:04:51.360]  can handle that because we're talking about 90
[3:04:51.360 --> 3:04:54.400]  terabytes in a month
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:59.040]  and $40,000 so go buy the dvds and info horse

[3:07:08.720 --> 3:07:12.400]  hot showers than when drinking the water that's because many chemicals are
[3:07:12.400 --> 3:07:15.760]  inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin

[3:08:35.920 --> 3:08:39.120]  have a trouble getting connected to him in argentina

[3:08:45.840 --> 3:08:49.920]  matter i've got just tons of important news i haven't even gotten to yet
[3:08:49.920 --> 3:08:56.000]  like 911 commission council government agreed to lie about 9-11
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:09:00.640]  the big prestigious talkers magazine
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:04.800]  has listed me in the top 50 talkers of 2009
[3:09:04.800 --> 3:09:09.920]  all these years they've ignored me and uh they stuck me in here with russian
[3:09:09.920 --> 3:09:13.680]  limbaugh shawna hannity mike gallagher
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:20.560]  and uh all these other people like michael savage and
[3:09:20.560 --> 3:09:26.640]  mark levine and this is ridiculous
[3:09:26.640 --> 3:09:29.440]  i almost don't even like being on the map with these people
[3:09:29.440 --> 3:09:32.960]  but talkers sent me a daughter loris lessinger
[3:09:32.960 --> 3:09:36.800]  but i guess i should feel nice that uh
[3:09:41.760 --> 3:09:45.200]  that they included me in this
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:50.400]  very bizarre though where do they get these 50 people
[3:09:50.400 --> 3:09:54.320]  oh it doesn't matter
[3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:02.320]  this was just sent to me okay anyways uh let's continue with your phone calls
[3:10:02.320 --> 3:10:06.720]  here um let's talk to dan in pennsylvania dan
[3:10:06.720 --> 3:10:10.720]  you're on the air hi alex yes sir yes hello
[3:10:10.720 --> 3:10:14.080]  good afternoon um i have a lot of issues that i could bring up
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:17.520]  but um i have two major ones that i'd like to
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:22.720]  bring up one is the um thing about obama wanting to have national service
[3:10:22.720 --> 3:10:28.160]  on 9 11 and um what is it i just wondered if
[3:10:28.160 --> 3:10:31.760]  anybody has thought about two days beforehand
[3:10:31.760 --> 3:10:35.200]  of this year because i'm thinking that might be like a false
[3:10:35.200 --> 3:10:38.720]  false flag terror thing that's going to happen
[3:10:38.720 --> 3:10:43.040]  on september 9 2009
[3:10:43.040 --> 3:10:49.920]  oh that would be uh 9 9 9 wouldn't it yeah turn it upside down
[3:10:49.920 --> 3:10:54.240]  6 6 6 exactly well look at how they bombed
[3:10:54.240 --> 3:11:00.320]  madrid on 3 3 3 look at 7 7 look at all the other bombings they always do it
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:03.680]  on weird cryptic numbers because not that we believe in that it's them
[3:11:03.680 --> 3:11:08.080]  that believe in this weird babel on mystery school a numerology
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:13.840]  uh system uh but uh folks thought it'd be really bad on 6 6 6
[3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:18.400]  you know 2006 six months six day and nothing really happened
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:22.480]  so sometimes they do sometimes they don't uh but uh
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:25.360]  there's no doubt they want national compulsory service the bills are
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:28.400]  introduced uh they pulled it out of one version put it back in a
[3:11:28.400 --> 3:11:32.960]  new one 1444 or 1444 and so that's certainly all
[3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:36.240]  going on yeah yeah and that's just one of my
[3:11:36.240 --> 3:11:40.400]  thoughts when they when the next um false flag terror will happen
[3:11:40.400 --> 3:11:47.840]  um also i'm 41 years old and i haven't had any uh vaccinations blue shots or
[3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:51.440]  anything at all my mother didn't believe in them at
[3:11:51.440 --> 3:11:54.880]  all since you know i was a kid and everything like that the last time i
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:11:59.040]  know i mean was she with al-qaeda
[3:11:59.120 --> 3:12:02.160]  because you know the government says folks uh that's in these reports if you
[3:12:02.160 --> 3:12:05.680]  don't want to believe in the vaccines you're also a dangerous terrorist but
[3:12:05.680 --> 3:12:09.760]  go ahead yeah yeah and i only had a uh tetanus
[3:12:09.760 --> 3:12:13.120]  shot when i was like 17 that's the last shot i had
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:17.760]  like that and i'm just wondering if there's anybody else out there that
[3:12:17.760 --> 3:12:22.400]  has been like that i mean that's yeah i haven't had a
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:28.560]  vaccine since i had surgery for a broken leg when i was 16 and they gave me a
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:32.320]  tetanus shot so i haven't had any vaccine since 16 either
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:36.640]  yeah i mean i could go on and on and on especially about family court and
[3:12:36.640 --> 3:12:40.800]  uh you name it you know because i haven't seen my kids in almost
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:45.200]  three years because of that and well what happens is they don't they don't
[3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:48.560]  even give them to grandparents now in fact john i sent you a bunch of clips of
[3:12:48.560 --> 3:12:51.920]  those you got those news clips

[3:13:08.880 --> 3:13:12.400]  uh well uh i'm just i wanted to comment on what you were talking about
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:16.240]  earlier uh uh getting active and doing different things i'm
[3:13:16.240 --> 3:13:20.800]  student up here at kutztown university i've been doing all i can now it's
[3:13:20.800 --> 3:13:24.720]  putting flyers out giving people links giving people copies of the dvd
[3:13:24.720 --> 3:13:27.600]  whatever i can do
[3:13:27.600 --> 3:13:34.400]  well thank you sir yes sorry i i just connected but yeah i'm
[3:13:34.400 --> 3:13:37.760]  you know i'm getting i'm beginning everybody from left wing right left
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:40.400]  wing all that tried to open their eyes started
[3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:46.000]  looking into what's going on what do you think about all these governors and
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:49.440]  talk show host and culture say they want to fight the new world order
[3:13:49.440 --> 3:13:53.280]  didn't exist all these years but now they want to fight it i think it's
[3:13:53.280 --> 3:13:56.080]  hilarious i think i think it's just so
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:13:59.520]  way everybody's getting to think one way that they're trying to jump on our
[3:13:59.520 --> 3:14:03.360]  side and try to get a consensus with the
[3:14:03.360 --> 3:14:08.480]  population that's opening their eyes exactly exactly but but they want to
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:11.440]  make us think that they're on our side
[3:14:11.440 --> 3:14:14.240]  and just like benedict arnold in the revolutionary war
[3:14:14.240 --> 3:14:17.200]  they're you know they tried to deny this because they were part of it
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:20.640]  and then now that they know we're becoming the majority they're trying to
[3:14:20.640 --> 3:14:24.400]  act like they're with us but you look at their actions
[3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:27.600]  it's the opposite it's going to be betrayal
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:31.920]  yeah i got another thing to say um i'm up here on a college campus and i've
[3:14:31.920 --> 3:14:35.600]  been noticing a little by little you know the last couple months or so
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:38.800]  you know every once in a while i'd walk out and i'd see a
[3:14:38.800 --> 3:14:43.280]  military person walking by every people in uniform just a group of them walking
[3:14:43.280 --> 3:14:46.000]  down the street no it's kind of a little hard
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:49.840]  and i was looking at your interview with jim tucker um about an hour ago and
[3:14:49.840 --> 3:14:54.000]  you guys were talking about cigarettes and he got me one in one so i went outside
[3:14:54.000 --> 3:14:58.560]  and i'm having a cigarette and the van pulls up and it's got a military
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:01.840]  and it's got a guy in full uniform and a big green van
[3:15:01.840 --> 3:15:05.200]  he rolls down his window and he says to me you know you can't smoke that here
[3:15:05.200 --> 3:15:07.600]  you got to get off campus if you want to smoke
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:11.200]  and he pulls away and i see it it's got a federal bump
[3:15:11.200 --> 3:15:14.880]  he's got a federal license plate on the back of this thing and i was wondering
[3:15:14.880 --> 3:15:19.440]  you know what why are they here and what what can we do to get them out of here
[3:15:19.440 --> 3:15:23.200]  no no they're being quietly encouraged to boss people around so you'll have a
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:26.800]  mass shooting they show up you'll have a dwi checkpoint the army or marines are
[3:15:26.800 --> 3:15:29.360]  there you'll have the governor of tennessee say
[3:15:29.360 --> 3:15:31.920]  we heard you're gonna run illegal checkpoints on highways you're not
[3:15:31.920 --> 3:15:34.480]  allowed to and then it was in the tennessee papers
[3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:37.120]  the army said we don't care what the governor says
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:40.160]  we're gonna do it because they intend to fully
[3:15:40.160 --> 3:15:44.640]  slowly implode the economy and then as the riots and things break out they'll
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:48.000]  pose as the saviors put troops on the streets
[3:15:48.000 --> 3:15:52.880]  the public will say yay they restored order that will then set the precedent
[3:15:52.880 --> 3:15:56.880]  for the full military occupation and then
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:16:00.960]  gun confiscation will come after like senator diane feinstein said she said
[3:16:00.960 --> 3:16:04.400]  we're gonna ban your guns in 60 minutes she said we're gonna ban them
[3:16:04.400 --> 3:16:07.760]  but she said we're gonna do it in our own time and so they got a first
[3:16:07.760 --> 3:16:11.600]  economically hurt us you know they hate our guts they're happy to steal
[3:16:11.600 --> 3:16:15.440]  destroy the dollar crush our future get us enslaved
[3:16:15.440 --> 3:16:19.360]  once they've got that then as the imf engaged in in argentina and other
[3:16:19.360 --> 3:16:23.920]  countries once things fully implode then the riots then the troops
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:30.320]  and uh we do have uh our next guest on with us

[3:17:23.200 --> 3:17:26.320]  i'll never forget the washington post right after the collapse of argentina
[3:17:26.320 --> 3:17:28.640]  reported that within two weeks of it happening
[3:17:28.640 --> 3:17:32.240]  middle-class people were homeless in a truck dumped over with cattle
[3:17:32.240 --> 3:17:35.840]  and the people are running up slicing wet globs of
[3:17:35.840 --> 3:17:40.320]  raw meat off gobbling at starving to death and argentina is still in desperate
[3:17:40.320 --> 3:17:42.640]  straits the most wealthy country in latin america
[3:17:42.640 --> 3:17:46.480]  on par with the u.s they let the bankers come in same thing was done there
[3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:49.440]  uh so uh sir thank you for coming on with us
[3:17:49.440 --> 3:17:52.880]  my pleasure alex how are you great to say hello to you and your audience
[3:17:52.880 --> 3:17:55.520]  that's great to have your sorry we got the numbers mixed up but we at least
[3:17:55.520 --> 3:17:57.040]  had to think of the hour about the break
[3:17:57.040 --> 3:18:00.240]  okay parallels tell folks what happened in argentina
[3:18:00.240 --> 3:18:04.560]  versus what's now being done to the u.s island europe australia
[3:18:04.560 --> 3:18:08.400]  well we had a series of collapses of different with different characteristics
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:13.120]  so now we had one in 1975 that's why i say i always say i'm 56 and i went through
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:19.440]  three of them one in 1975 a much worse one in 1989 that ended in hyperinflation
[3:18:19.440 --> 3:18:24.560]  and the very worst was in 2001 2002 which is the one you're referring to alex
[3:18:24.560 --> 3:18:28.560]  and uh what happened then is the whole banking system collapsed the chain of
[3:18:28.560 --> 3:18:31.200]  payments collapsed people had their money completely
[3:18:31.200 --> 3:18:34.480]  blocked in the bank they just couldn't get it out to even buy the most
[3:18:34.480 --> 3:18:38.560]  elemental necessities of life or pay their petrol and and and their gas in the
[3:18:38.560 --> 3:18:43.040]  in the in the car tanks and so forth and as you say we did have some extreme
[3:18:43.040 --> 3:18:46.000]  cases that the one you said you know people very poor people impoverished
[3:18:46.000 --> 3:18:50.800]  people doing anything to have something to eat and the net result is that once
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:54.560]  the whole thing more or less uh came back under control
[3:18:54.560 --> 3:18:59.440]  about 50 percent of our population uh went below the poverty line and they
[3:18:59.440 --> 3:19:02.480]  never came back they're still down there below the poverty line because
[3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:07.120]  these new world order people work with a lot of psychology and they know that
[3:19:07.120 --> 3:19:10.080]  people in the long run get used to anything
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:14.400]  so they've arranged to have us all get used to just uh the blood we have the
[3:19:14.400 --> 3:19:16.800]  population to living below the power poverty line
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:19.920]  and it's now it's just a more of a question for the police than a question
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:22.960]  of actually getting things done i call it alex
[3:19:22.960 --> 3:19:26.880]  uh when you're when you're in grief over somebody's death
[3:19:26.880 --> 3:19:30.880]  we've all lost a dear a dear person in our family or a friend
[3:19:30.880 --> 3:19:34.640]  and at first we feel shocked and after that terrible grief
[3:19:34.640 --> 3:19:37.520]  and then it's terrible sitting down at the dining table and seeing that the
[3:19:37.520 --> 3:19:41.840]  chair where your dad or your mom used to sit is empty but after a month after
[3:19:41.840 --> 3:19:45.600]  six months after a year you get used to it you you cope with it
[3:19:45.600 --> 3:19:48.560]  and they did that part of the experiment they did with us was that
[3:19:48.560 --> 3:19:52.000]  they took our money away everybody was banging pots and pans down the street
[3:19:52.000 --> 3:19:55.440]  everybody was screaming yelling i had friends that literally and i myself
[3:19:55.440 --> 3:19:58.640]  wanted to set fire stay there stay there sir gotta break amazing from
[3:19:58.640 --> 3:20:02.400]  argentina stay with us
[3:20:02.400 --> 3:20:06.000]  millions of americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic

[3:24:21.680 --> 3:24:28.640]  and a glance i look at you adrian salbuci is our guest economist researcher
[3:24:28.640 --> 3:24:36.080]  he wrote back in 1995 world government the book
[3:24:36.080 --> 3:24:39.120]  and how they were controlling his nation it's the same thing i'm having world
[3:24:39.120 --> 3:24:43.200]  bank brag you heard jim tucker earlier with sources inside
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:47.760]  belterburg they are celebrating well george soros is in the news
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:50.720]  saying this is the greatest time of his life the culmination that he's behind
[3:24:50.720 --> 3:24:55.760]  us all and they can't wait till your bankrupt under their control
[3:24:55.760 --> 3:24:59.840]  this is a tool of their control they can't wait to turn the police loose on you
[3:24:59.840 --> 3:25:02.640]  that that's why cps kid that people's kids that are poor
[3:25:02.640 --> 3:25:05.920]  they want all your kids this is them taking over
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:10.080]  this is a military operation okay mr salbuci continuing you've lived through
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:12.640]  this and all the analogy you do you're showing a
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:16.720]  peso and the devaluation of it continue with what the globalists are doing and
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:21.040]  what's going to happen here yeah uh... that part of what you were saying alex
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:24.320]  about the pace so that i show in the youtube film is just to show
[3:25:24.320 --> 3:25:28.240]  a one peso coin one argentine peso coin will hardly buy you
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:31.600]  a bus drive in downtown bonas iris and yet through
[3:25:31.600 --> 3:25:35.840]  four monetary reforms that same peso in nineteen
[3:25:35.840 --> 3:25:40.000]  seventy would have purchased would have been in been equal to ten
[3:25:40.000 --> 3:25:44.080]  trillion uh... pesos which would have bought you argentina four times over so
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:47.680]  thick so that is we know what inflation hyperinflation are all about
[3:25:47.680 --> 3:25:50.640]  and what i was saying just before the break and this is something that we
[3:25:50.640 --> 3:25:52.720]  should i think you we should all keep in mind
[3:25:52.720 --> 3:25:56.400]  i think that argentina in two thousand one in two thousand and two and we had
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:26:00.640]  our financial banking and monetary uh... collapse and meltdown
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:04.080]  uh... in a way we were sort of a of a of a trial case we were sort of an
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:08.400]  experiment to see how people would react and in the how people would react
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:11.680]  let me just tell your audience that on thirtieth november
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:14.800]  nine uh... two thousand one three of them with two thousand one
[3:26:14.800 --> 3:26:18.800]  we all learn from the radio on the tv that there was an extended bank holiday
[3:26:18.800 --> 3:26:20.720]  and we couldn't get our money out of the bank
[3:26:20.720 --> 3:26:23.360]  if you had anything in your current account you could take up to i don't
[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:23.680]  know
[3:26:23.680 --> 3:26:27.920]  say a hundred dollars a week and if you had a bit large savings fixed the process
[3:26:27.920 --> 3:26:30.960]  and so forth you couldn't take it out period until you get further advice
[3:26:30.960 --> 3:26:33.680]  the first reaction of people was to go crazy
[3:26:33.680 --> 3:26:36.800]  people started banging pots and pans down the street
[3:26:36.800 --> 3:26:41.120]  they attacked uh... and broke the windows and banks and so forth
[3:26:41.120 --> 3:26:44.320]  that happened for a while after a month it continued to happen
[3:26:44.320 --> 3:26:46.720]  after three months it happened but a little bit less
[3:26:46.720 --> 3:26:49.520]  and by the sixth month people had gotten used to it
[3:26:49.520 --> 3:26:53.280]  they had sought other alternative ways of surviving more or less
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:26:56.400]  and they got used to it then i was making the analogy of when you when you
[3:26:56.400 --> 3:27:00.640]  when you lose a dear person who has died first you're your grief stricken
[3:27:00.640 --> 3:27:04.560]  then you can't believe it then you're really terrible but as time goes on
[3:27:04.560 --> 3:27:07.440]  life goes on and you have no choice but to get used to it
[3:27:07.440 --> 3:27:11.280]  and they realized that with argentina in spite of the fact that fifty percent of
[3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:13.680]  the population ended up below the poverty line
[3:27:13.680 --> 3:27:18.080]  in spite of the fact that absolutely everybody to a greater or lesser extent
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:22.480]  lost part of their assets and a lot of people lost a lot of their assets
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:26.240]  in the long run people get used to it so they probably have taken quite a
[3:27:26.240 --> 3:27:28.720]  number of clues from from the argentine experiment
[3:27:28.720 --> 3:27:33.120]  let's just let them scream let's let's let them cake let's let them have their
[3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:35.920]  temper tantrum but in the long run our answer is
[3:27:35.920 --> 3:27:39.840]  tough luck and and people end up getting used to it so in a way exactly and
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:42.160]  then what we thought what they're going to be doing with you guys
[3:27:42.160 --> 3:27:46.400]  exactly i want you to talk about that but in 2002 the the imf world bank
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:50.560]  documents got leaked bbc reported how they bragged how they engineered that
[3:27:50.560 --> 3:27:54.480]  in argentina and how they shut the bank money off even though they had it
[3:27:54.480 --> 3:28:00.560]  to create a loss of confidence so people would panic but but i want you to
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:03.520]  speak to that but i want folks understand latin america has more
[3:28:03.520 --> 3:28:07.040]  resources in south america than the us does many times over
[3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:10.800]  the people are hardworking too the elites brag
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:14.400]  that they hyperinflate things every few decades
[3:28:14.400 --> 3:28:18.960]  to keep the people poor and the elites buy up real assets while they're
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:21.920]  inflating it then they announce it's worthless to destroy
[3:28:21.920 --> 3:28:26.000]  confidence and consolidate even more now they're going to try this here they've
[3:28:26.000 --> 3:28:28.800]  never really done this here because they're afraid of the guns
[3:28:28.800 --> 3:28:32.800]  they decided to go ahead and do it here and march the military and police
[3:28:32.800 --> 3:28:36.480]  against the public so that's why this is going to be so much worse than even
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:39.760]  argentina uh... and so this is what's going to happen the
[3:28:39.760 --> 3:28:42.640]  government's going to take everything most of you've got
[3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:47.200]  go ahead sir i i hate to say this but uh... unfortunately you are you are
[3:28:47.200 --> 3:28:49.760]  right to a great extent i think we have to keep in mind
[3:28:49.760 --> 3:28:54.080]  that economics in a way is a branch of psychology and the greater the crisis
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:58.080]  the more psychological it is because whatever you do to to to uh...
[3:28:58.080 --> 3:29:01.280]  uh... keep your assets whether it be money shares
[3:29:01.280 --> 3:29:05.040]  other currencies and so forth it's all based on that your psychological
[3:29:05.040 --> 3:29:08.880]  perception of how good or how bad a particular currency is for example
[3:29:08.880 --> 3:29:12.080]  we didn't stick on to argentinian pesos because we knew that they were the
[3:29:12.080 --> 3:29:14.560]  they were inflating they were they were becoming
[3:29:14.560 --> 3:29:18.960]  uh... grossly devalued and we would stick on to dollars which in 2001 and 2002
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:21.280]  was a sort of our version of flight to safety
[3:29:21.280 --> 3:29:25.440]  now i think we have to keep very much in mind that there is a very large
[3:29:25.440 --> 3:29:29.760]  psychological factor behind all of this they are in a way trying to take all the
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:34.000]  options and the alternatives away from us i think stay there stay there sir that
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.880]  was a short segment long segment coming up with the economist and
[3:29:36.880 --> 3:29:40.400]  author from argentina it was right about the new world order back in the mid
[3:29:40.400 --> 3:29:43.920]  1990s fully aware of what's happening we'll come right back to him on the

[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:55.200]  uh... and uh... sir uh... again uh... international consultant economist
[3:35:55.200 --> 3:35:58.800]  author you've been predicting what would happen in argentina years before it
[3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:01.520]  happened you've been predicting what was going to happen here
[3:36:01.520 --> 3:36:06.160]  uh... break down how they engineer this what we're facing and
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:09.280]  anyways to bring these criminals to justice or is it just
[3:36:09.280 --> 3:36:14.000]  a wonderland of ponzi scheme criminals in control of our government's military
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:17.600]  and they're just going to continue to oppress until nothing's left
[3:36:17.600 --> 3:36:21.280]  well let me say this you do you think i fully agree with everything you've
[3:36:21.280 --> 3:36:25.600]  you've just said it is a ponzi it's a global ponzi scheme of criminals
[3:36:25.600 --> 3:36:29.280]  they have huge amounts of power but let's not forget
[3:36:29.280 --> 3:36:33.040]  that their power is based on our alleged weakness
[3:36:33.040 --> 3:36:36.800]  and it's not so much that we are weak as individuals citizens yourself in
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:40.080]  in the united states ourselves in argentina you're the audience that's
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:42.960]  listening to us now but we are all very separated
[3:36:42.960 --> 3:36:46.640]  and we then they keep they ensure that we are all kept completely atomized in
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:48.800]  other words everybody doing their own thing because
[3:36:48.800 --> 3:36:53.920]  if you add the power of just one part of the critical mass of peoples in the
[3:36:53.920 --> 3:36:57.280]  in the various countries we are far more powerful than they are
[3:36:57.280 --> 3:37:01.520]  and they know it that's why they permanently wield psychological warfare
[3:37:01.520 --> 3:37:04.320]  and psychological action against us to make us believe
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:07.600]  a that they are more powerful than what they really are and be
[3:37:07.600 --> 3:37:10.400]  that we are far weaker than what we really are because that is the secret
[3:37:10.400 --> 3:37:12.720]  of it that's the capital one coming out of the bag
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:15.600]  now as far as predicting that i don't think it's so much a question of
[3:37:15.600 --> 3:37:19.440]  predicting alex it's a question of understanding how the model works
[3:37:19.440 --> 3:37:23.200]  once you know something about aerodynamics and and turbines and a
[3:37:23.200 --> 3:37:26.560]  couple of other things then the mystery of a flying airplane is no
[3:37:26.560 --> 3:37:29.200]  longer a mystery because you understand the model and if you understand the
[3:37:29.200 --> 3:37:33.040]  model you can understand the internal trappings and how the whole thing works
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:36.000]  so for example as far as argentina is concerned
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:41.600]  the whole our collapse in 2001 2002 was brought about by a huge enormous
[3:37:41.600 --> 3:37:46.320]  unpayable uh public debt in us dollars by the government they couldn't pay it
[3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:48.720]  and the whole and the whole country collapsed however
[3:37:48.720 --> 3:37:53.120]  you might ask well why did they do that the reason they do that is exactly the
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:56.960]  same reason as to why shylock lent 3 000
[3:37:56.960 --> 3:38:00.080]  ducats to uh antonio the merchant of venice
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:03.120]  he told them look if you don't give me back the money i want a pound of your
[3:38:03.120 --> 3:38:06.400]  flesh and he couldn't get back the money and he wanted a pound of flesh
[3:38:06.400 --> 3:38:10.560]  and antonio's friend said i'll give you three times the debt but the uh the
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:14.240]  shylock the miser would say no i want my pound of flesh
[3:38:14.240 --> 3:38:18.320]  in argentina the pound of flesh is called our national territory
[3:38:18.320 --> 3:38:21.760]  they don't want us to pay the 300 billion we allegedly owe them
[3:38:21.760 --> 3:38:25.840]  they want to have control over the country and control over the territory so
[3:38:25.840 --> 3:38:31.040]  a debt usually isn't a good excuse for other things just as for antonio's
[3:38:31.040 --> 3:38:34.240]  pound of flesh so what they did with that government was a very stupid
[3:38:34.240 --> 3:38:38.400]  government they got the bankers to end dead argentina completely
[3:38:38.400 --> 3:38:41.840]  they did this through well paid and well financed
[3:38:41.840 --> 3:38:45.440]  president and and ministries of ministers of economy and so forth and
[3:38:45.440 --> 3:38:48.400]  once the whole legal structure was set up
[3:38:48.400 --> 3:38:51.920]  they made sure that we couldn't pay back and because we couldn't pay back
[3:38:51.920 --> 3:38:55.360]  they collapsed us the was about to say the government from reading the
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:38:58.320]  documents wasn't stupid they were bought and paid for
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:01.520]  to sell out your sovereignty just like they've done
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:04.800]  to us and you know you talk about how we have the power
[3:39:04.800 --> 3:39:08.160]  there is an awakening to them to the globalist
[3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:13.680]  worldwide so it's all coming to a head what these scammers what these shylocks
[3:39:13.680 --> 3:39:19.120]  are doing so absolutely please continue i mean i mean they set up deals where
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:23.520]  they they give fiat imf and world bank money backed up by other taxpayers in
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:27.280]  other countries and then they make the countries like argentina
[3:39:27.280 --> 3:39:32.720]  then only invest that money with the private corporations owned by the
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:36.800]  private banks so they it's just insane go ahead
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:41.360]  exactly so you see the point is and and and you made a very valid point there is
[3:39:41.360 --> 3:39:44.720]  when you start understanding what these guys want to do and perhaps one of the
[3:39:44.720 --> 3:39:47.920]  best ways to do it i'll tell you i use this example in argentina and people
[3:39:47.920 --> 3:39:52.400]  will understand that is look think of the kirchner's who are the president that
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:55.200]  they're christina kirchner who's the president of argentina or think of
[3:39:55.200 --> 3:39:59.360]  obama or even george w bush any president don't think of them as the
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:02.560]  president think of them as your national ceo
[3:40:02.560 --> 3:40:06.400]  so if obama is your national ceo that automatically
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:10.240]  triggers two key questions if obama is our ceo
[3:40:10.240 --> 3:40:13.600]  who sits on the board of directors of the united states of america and much more
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:17.680]  important who are the shareholders who own the united states of america or
[3:40:17.680 --> 3:40:20.400]  argentina or brazil or any country you like
[3:40:20.400 --> 3:40:24.560]  when you start understanding that then you realize that what these guys do is
[3:40:24.560 --> 3:40:28.080]  they go into any country yours or mine they identify
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:31.520]  the sobs and believe me there are millions of them who are willing to sell
[3:40:31.520 --> 3:40:35.040]  out their country for money for prestige for fame for power for personal
[3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:38.960]  power they pay them all they want they pay all their campaigns and then they
[3:40:38.960 --> 3:40:42.160]  have them as CEOs to do their own dirty work they don't need
[3:40:42.160 --> 3:40:46.640]  invading forces they don't need an invasion as you had to do in iraq or
[3:40:46.640 --> 3:40:50.320]  or in afghanistan or you didn't vietnam which is looks very bad in the six o'clock
[3:40:50.320 --> 3:40:54.240]  news they know if they can argentina is a prime example of it that they can do this
[3:40:54.240 --> 3:40:59.600]  through the control of well-paid local managers to do them their dirty work
[3:40:59.600 --> 3:41:02.800]  you know absolutely and and and that's what globalism is is these
[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:06.320]  international bureaus of internationalists training
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:11.360]  the bureaucracy to go out and uh... take over the nations of the planet
[3:41:11.360 --> 3:41:15.360]  through economic espionage you know that there's a washington post
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:19.920]  uh... journalist who laid who wrote an article saying argentina did not fall
[3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:23.120]  alone wall street pushed to the very end
[3:41:23.120 --> 3:41:26.720]  it was an article that appeared in the washington post in august 2003
[3:41:26.720 --> 3:41:30.080]  which mr bluestine later turned into a full-length book
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:35.680]  and he gives full names addresses details of how wall street
[3:41:35.680 --> 3:41:38.960]  literally produced a scam they even incurred in gross
[3:41:38.960 --> 3:41:42.960]  uh... professional uh... misrepresentation professional liability for
[3:41:42.960 --> 3:41:47.600]  for bad badly performing as a bank and they literally drove argentina and those
[3:41:47.600 --> 3:41:50.640]  who invested in the tango bonds to bankruptcy
[3:41:50.640 --> 3:41:54.800]  and at the same time right after our crisis in uh... also in august by the
[3:41:54.800 --> 3:41:58.320]  two thousand two the new york times ran a very
[3:41:58.320 --> 3:42:02.320]  interesting and true article with which which i think they did all they said
[3:42:02.320 --> 3:42:07.120]  will succession be the key to argentina's problems and they wrote an article as
[3:42:07.120 --> 3:42:11.440]  to why the whole patagonia which are the five southern provinces of argentina
[3:42:11.440 --> 3:42:15.520]  should succeed from the rest of the country and on their own try and see if
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:17.840]  they could sort out their global problems because
[3:42:17.840 --> 3:42:21.600]  if they could split argentina into two parts it would be that much easier to
[3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:23.200]  control and take over
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:27.280]  so as you can see everything they do is part of a grand chess board and i'm
[3:42:27.280 --> 3:42:30.000]  not quoting big new berginski but it definitely is
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.720]  part of a grand chess board and all that we need to do
[3:42:32.720 --> 3:42:35.840]  is understand the trapping understand the mechanism
[3:42:35.840 --> 3:42:39.760]  alert our countrymen i'll learn our folk in it and as you said a little while
[3:42:39.760 --> 3:42:43.040]  back alec uh... an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of pure
[3:42:43.040 --> 3:42:46.400]  okay we haven't we haven't really taken too many ounces of prevention we're gonna
[3:42:46.400 --> 3:42:49.280]  have to take a lot of pounds of cure but we're still on time
[3:42:49.280 --> 3:42:52.640]  we can still do something about it we can still fight back in the best way to
[3:42:52.640 --> 3:42:53.280]  do it
[3:42:53.280 --> 3:42:56.400]  is to do it and with your wonderful program where you're really explaining
[3:42:56.400 --> 3:42:59.440]  this to a lot of people and we should even use the technology that they made
[3:42:59.440 --> 3:43:02.320]  available to us as you do it with the zeitgeist uh...
[3:43:02.320 --> 3:43:05.040]  of the obama deception movie and a whole host of other things that you're doing
[3:43:05.040 --> 3:43:10.080]  all the time alec well uh... yeah they put so much stuff inside guys now now
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:13.120]  expanding on this
[3:43:13.120 --> 3:43:16.240]  studying this or as you've been doing for decades
[3:43:16.240 --> 3:43:21.360]  what point is the united states that how do you see them trying to bring us down
[3:43:21.360 --> 3:43:24.000]  and consolidate things they're openly announcing they're going to implode the
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:27.120]  whole world set up a new bank of the world
[3:43:27.120 --> 3:43:31.200]  that will set the carbon taxes regulate every facet of our lives
[3:43:31.200 --> 3:43:34.720]  have its own military to rule us i mean we're going from the bankers being
[3:43:34.720 --> 3:43:37.760]  behind the nation's running things to openly
[3:43:37.760 --> 3:43:40.880]  putting crowns on their heads and saying we own you
[3:43:40.880 --> 3:43:43.600]  uh... so so so so speak to that
[3:43:43.600 --> 3:43:46.800]  uh... this is this uh... this new imperialism this new
[3:43:46.800 --> 3:43:50.240]  colonialism but openly by the
[3:43:50.240 --> 3:43:54.800]  uh... polycentric uh... bankers
[3:43:54.800 --> 3:43:58.880]  look when we got the i think the key to this is to understand what they mean
[3:43:58.880 --> 3:44:00.880]  when they say new world order you know
[3:44:00.880 --> 3:44:03.840]  new world order doesn't mean that it's it's it's what they're going to do
[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:07.200]  tomorrow new world order is a generic term
[3:44:07.200 --> 3:44:11.440]  they used it in 1919 just when they found that the council on foreign relations
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:13.520]  and the royal institute of international affairs
[3:44:13.520 --> 3:44:17.200]  in paris after the treaty of our sales was imposed upon germany and wester
[3:44:17.200 --> 3:44:20.320]  hungary and and the turks they talked about a new world order
[3:44:20.320 --> 3:44:24.320]  after world war one when world war two was about to end and they got together
[3:44:24.320 --> 3:44:28.000]  in britain woods and so forth it was to form a new world order which was
[3:44:28.000 --> 3:44:31.600]  the yaw death schizophrenic world of the post war second world war with
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:34.640]  the ussr on one side and the usa on the other side
[3:44:34.640 --> 3:44:38.320]  when they were getting ready for globalization they knew that the ussr had
[3:44:38.320 --> 3:44:41.280]  to go george bush announced we're gonna have george bush senior
[3:44:41.280 --> 3:44:44.640]  we're gonna have a new world order called globalization fine
[3:44:44.640 --> 3:44:48.880]  now they're talking about another new world order and that new world order
[3:44:48.880 --> 3:44:52.960]  talking about now is world government it was announced on 8th
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:44:56.560]  december 2008 in the pages of the financial times
[3:44:56.560 --> 3:45:00.480]  london by one of their key journalist gideon rachman
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:03.760]  and the title of the article states at all they just they just wrote now we
[3:45:03.760 --> 3:45:06.560]  got now it's for world government we're going for world government and the
[3:45:06.560 --> 3:45:08.880]  guy says i'm not talking about governance
[3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:11.840]  i'm not talking about international cooperation i'm talking about world
[3:45:11.840 --> 3:45:15.280]  government and that is the next day so that they want to drag us into that's
[3:45:15.280 --> 3:45:17.680]  why it's so bloody dangerous what's happening right now
[3:45:17.680 --> 3:45:21.600]  and then you find out that they are literal eugenicist who gave hitler his
[3:45:21.600 --> 3:45:25.680]  own ideas you find out their total control freaks on a power trip
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:29.760]  and that they've been working for a world government so they can literally
[3:45:29.760 --> 3:45:34.080]  carry out one-child policies calling you name it i mean
[3:45:34.640 --> 3:45:38.800]  folks are upset about world government they should really be upset if they
[3:45:38.800 --> 3:45:41.760]  know what the end game is from your research sir
[3:45:41.760 --> 3:45:45.040]  how are they planning to bring the u.s. down how do you see these phases
[3:45:45.040 --> 3:45:48.800]  unfolding and what is their end game from your research
[3:45:48.800 --> 3:45:52.800]  well the terrible thing i think unfortunately is now and i fully agree
[3:45:52.800 --> 3:45:57.760]  with you how it has a full name it's abarak who's saying obama
[3:45:57.760 --> 3:46:00.720]  i mean people should realize how how is it possible
[3:46:00.720 --> 3:46:04.640]  that somebody who was completely unknown four years ago was listed from
[3:46:04.640 --> 3:46:08.720]  obscurity in illinois to full washington dc pump in just
[3:46:08.720 --> 3:46:12.560]  three years and is the president of the united states with an unlikely name of
[3:46:12.560 --> 3:46:16.880]  but barack who's saying obama but barack who's saying obama is the ceo and i
[3:46:16.880 --> 3:46:21.280]  think what we have to see is the people that they've placed around mr obama
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:26.080]  you have three types of people basically you have the cfr think tank people
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:30.320]  you have the clean tonight's who are the people like larry summer's
[3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:35.120]  timothy geithner robert rovin even poll poker who came a little bit from from
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:40.000]  from beforehand you have them at the architects of both of the legal uh
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:43.040]  changes of the nineties that brought about this financial
[3:46:43.040 --> 3:46:45.680]  uh... month monstrosity i mean they actually are the architects of what
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:49.120]  happened then they're back in power so you have the clean tonight's back in
[3:46:49.120 --> 3:46:52.480]  power you have the cfr and bill bergen for a lateral condition people back in
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:56.400]  power and unfortunately you also have the zionist back in power
[3:46:56.400 --> 3:47:01.360]  i mean you have our chief of staff who has double israeli u.s. nationality
[3:47:01.360 --> 3:47:04.720]  probably belongs to the to the intelligence service of the israeli
[3:47:04.720 --> 3:47:08.240]  defense forces and his father fought as a guerrilla
[3:47:08.240 --> 3:47:12.560]  terrorist in the urgun filo me i mean you you have very very tough people there
[3:47:12.560 --> 3:47:16.080]  you have david axelrod you have hillary clinton was an absolute
[3:47:16.080 --> 3:47:22.160]  zionist you have joe biden who in our in a tv interview in israel in shalom
[3:47:22.160 --> 3:47:24.880]  tv on seventh april two thousand seven
[3:47:24.880 --> 3:47:28.080]  he said literally and you can watch this on youtube you don't have to be joe
[3:47:28.080 --> 3:47:31.280]  should be a zionist i'm a zionist so i figure
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:35.280]  who's in power in our in in in the united states that steven waldin and john
[3:47:35.280 --> 3:47:37.840]  nearsheimer in their splendid book on the israeli
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:42.880]  uh lobbyist showed the way they exert so much power they wield so much influence
[3:47:42.880 --> 3:47:46.720]  that they end up forcing the united states to give priority to the israeli
[3:47:46.720 --> 3:47:50.960]  national interest above the united states of america national interest
[3:47:50.960 --> 3:47:54.960]  so you see we have to be very careful with the minorities that use their power
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:47:58.400]  we have to be very careful with who the people are around obama and
[3:47:58.400 --> 3:48:01.600]  and my feeling and i see this from very far away in argentina
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:06.800]  is that obama looks to me like the last president of the united states
[3:48:06.800 --> 3:48:09.680]  you know i agree with you they want your downfall
[3:48:09.680 --> 3:48:13.920]  no no no listen i totally agree with you uh... this is the death of the republic
[3:48:13.920 --> 3:48:16.400]  he is the closer that's what all the experts we keep talking to you
[3:48:16.400 --> 3:48:19.600]  he he is the curtain they'll still call us the u s
[3:48:19.600 --> 3:48:25.360]  but his job is to destroy everything the united states is and it stood for
[3:48:25.360 --> 3:48:29.120]  we've been used as an engine to dominate and finance enslaving you and many
[3:48:29.120 --> 3:48:32.560]  others but now we're the we're the christmas pig
[3:48:32.560 --> 3:48:36.160]  they are openly saying they're slaughtering us they're going to bring us
[3:48:36.160 --> 3:48:40.240]  down below latin america you take argentina you have the old saying as
[3:48:40.240 --> 3:48:43.040]  rich as an argentine you go back a hundred years ago people in
[3:48:43.040 --> 3:48:46.320]  argentina folks were more wealthy than americans on average
[3:48:46.320 --> 3:48:49.520]  they were the richest country in latin america and the very same
[3:48:49.520 --> 3:48:52.720]  but yeah yeah look now look at look at uh... iceland
[3:48:52.720 --> 3:48:56.240]  one of the most wealthy countries in the world totally bankrupt overnight
[3:48:56.240 --> 3:48:59.280]  this is what the bankers do go ahead
[3:48:59.280 --> 3:49:02.560]  yep but so i think that basically when we start having those ideas more or
[3:49:02.560 --> 3:49:06.880]  less clear on our minds and we realize what the purpose of mr obama is
[3:49:06.880 --> 3:49:10.320]  um... a key a key amount to keep in mind
[3:49:10.320 --> 3:49:15.440]  just as it was necessary to to to go from the bipolar world of uh...
[3:49:15.440 --> 3:49:18.160]  mutually assured destruction of the yalta agreement
[3:49:18.160 --> 3:49:22.160]  it was necessary to go to globalization and one of the two big ones had to go
[3:49:22.160 --> 3:49:24.800]  and they decided that the one that had to go with the united union of soviet
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:28.480]  socialist republics and the ussr went almost without a
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:32.720]  firing a shot now to go from globalization to world government they
[3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:35.760]  need for the united states to go and to become as you were just saying a few
[3:49:35.760 --> 3:49:38.400]  minutes ago okay you can still exist but you are no
[3:49:38.400 --> 3:49:42.000]  longer a superpower you are no longer the indispensable nation at madeline
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:45.280]  lorbrecht like to say you are no longer the primus
[3:49:45.280 --> 3:49:48.640]  interpartis you're just another country and you're going to be polarized so that
[3:49:48.640 --> 3:49:52.000]  you look like argentina like brazil and like indonesia
[3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:54.880]  in all these other countries that have been hit hard because it's their way of
[3:49:54.880 --> 3:49:58.800]  saying we are in charge now mind you i personally
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:02.320]  this is the perhaps is more for for from a philosophical point of view i think
[3:50:02.320 --> 3:50:05.600]  they're going to fail because what they want is absolute madness
[3:50:05.600 --> 3:50:08.480]  what i do fear alex and i feel this very much is
[3:50:08.480 --> 3:50:12.240]  these people will not take defeat for an answer in other words it's not a
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:14.560]  question of saying oh we're going to defeat them
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:18.160]  and they're going to go running away with the tail between their their little
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:22.080]  poor so they're just going to run away i think these guys if they are faced with
[3:50:22.080 --> 3:50:25.920]  total defeat might just trigger a full-fledged war and say well what the
[3:50:25.920 --> 3:50:28.560]  hell if we can't have the world nobody can have the world
[3:50:28.560 --> 3:50:32.400]  well no that's what ran corporation says they want to start world war three

[3:56:16.400 --> 3:56:20.560]  at least pointing ever stronger fingers at them you were just saying that they
[3:56:20.560 --> 3:56:22.800]  will have the avian flu and all these other
[3:56:22.800 --> 3:56:25.360]  scams that they prepare i just like to enclosing
[3:56:25.360 --> 3:56:29.600]  read your very brief uh news article that i'm sure you will you already know
[3:56:29.600 --> 3:56:33.840]  but i think it's worth keeping in mind on according to abc news on 20th
[3:56:33.840 --> 3:56:37.360]  october 2008 during a seattle fundraiser
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:41.520]  joe biden who's the real power behind uh obama i mean
[3:56:41.520 --> 3:56:45.520]  your president is much more joe biden than dembarack obama said
[3:56:45.520 --> 3:56:49.360]  mark my words i'm quoting it will not be six months before the world test
[3:56:49.360 --> 3:56:53.200]  barack obama like they did john kennedy the world is looking
[3:56:53.200 --> 3:56:55.920]  we're about to elect a brilliant 47 year old senator
[3:56:55.920 --> 3:56:59.440]  a president of the united states remember i said it's standing here
[3:56:59.440 --> 3:57:02.720]  if you don't remember anything else i said remember this
[3:57:02.720 --> 3:57:07.440]  watch we're going to have an international crisis a generated crisis
[3:57:07.440 --> 3:57:10.640]  to test the metal of this guy now he didn't know that he was being
[3:57:10.640 --> 3:57:14.000]  uh tape and then when he realized that he was being tabby said oh i shouldn't
[3:57:14.000 --> 3:57:18.560]  said that but it's more than obvious that joe biden is really in the know
[3:57:18.560 --> 3:57:22.640]  he must know that something is being prepared he must know that a false flag
[3:57:22.640 --> 3:57:27.120]  uh event is going to arise somewhere maybe in the states maybe abroad maybe
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:30.240]  american interests elsewhere but something that will bring the people
[3:57:30.240 --> 3:57:33.200]  together fanatically they hope that like like
