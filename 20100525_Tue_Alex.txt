[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.400]  all right I barely made it in to the broadcast studio just now I have been so
[00:36.400 --> 00:43.800]  busy on the telephone working on a whole bunch of bizarre bizarre stories that
[00:43.800 --> 00:49.000]  just get crazier and crazier by the minute
[00:52.480 --> 01:00.760]  I'm like somebody in a batting cage that is trying to hit 20 balls a second
[01:00.760 --> 01:08.300]  being thrown at me I'm not complaining it's just all so important and I can't
[01:08.300 --> 01:21.320]  triage any of this information it's all that important there's just so much of
[01:21.320 --> 01:31.800]  it my brain this morning has been going a million miles an hour so many points
[01:31.800 --> 01:38.080]  so many facets so many angles I want to go over then I get here on on air I'm
[01:38.080 --> 01:42.000]  trying to track down all this information trying to call all the phone
[01:42.000 --> 01:46.840]  numbers and addresses and you know I didn't believe it I didn't want to
[01:46.840 --> 01:52.480]  believe it four years ago when we got the clergy response team secret FEMA
[01:52.480 --> 01:56.440]  documents where they're training tens of thousands of prominent preachers around
[01:56.440 --> 02:03.160]  the country to indoctrinate their flocks for martial law to indoctrinate their
[02:03.160 --> 02:08.360]  flocks to go to FEMA camps to take force inoculations and then we call the phone
[02:08.360 --> 02:12.720]  numbers and FEMA confirmed it was real documents and years later they even put
[02:12.720 --> 02:17.520]  on the news like it was a good thing oh the pastors are being secretly prepared
[02:17.520 --> 02:25.440]  for martial law and to tell their flocks to submit oh it's so good or going back
[02:25.440 --> 02:28.200]  15 years ago when I learned about government narcotics trafficking
[02:28.200 --> 02:30.960]  something that was already public knowledge but I started investigating it
[02:30.960 --> 02:34.840]  and then 15 years later to see the news go yeah well our government grows the
[02:34.840 --> 02:40.080]  opium and and we ship the cocaine in it's for your own good we put you in
[02:40.080 --> 02:46.280]  prison when you get caught using it it's just so in your face to have a
[02:46.280 --> 02:56.440]  supreme court nominee openly saying that she wants to get rid of free speech in
[02:56.440 --> 03:02.760]  the second amendment and it's not even an issue and what's happening with North
[03:02.760 --> 03:09.440]  Korea is off the chart and what's going on with Iran is incredible and what's
[03:09.440 --> 03:17.240]  happening with the euro is just amazing I mean the turbulence the tumult that
[03:17.240 --> 03:31.080]  we're in right now is just amazing now I will say this yesterday we began
[03:31.080 --> 03:40.120]  confirming this isn't even the big story that there are private police forces in
[03:40.120 --> 03:50.280]  Houston tied in with Serbians running around engaged in police work and it
[03:50.280 --> 03:58.320]  looks like it's connected to the usual parties and there's an Israeli
[03:58.320 --> 04:03.280]  connection and I've got I've got a big stack of research on that and it just
[04:03.280 --> 04:10.800]  gets more insane by the minute but that's not even the big news the big
[04:10.800 --> 04:20.400]  news is that I was already aware so this just confirms that the feds is part of
[04:20.400 --> 04:27.320]  the model state's health emergency powers act and the clergy response teams
[04:27.320 --> 04:36.720]  and infregard are publicly training and drilling to use post offices as sorting
[04:36.720 --> 04:43.520]  centers who goes to a FEMA camp who goes to a prison who gets released who gets
[04:43.520 --> 04:50.160]  inoculated who gets interrogated and now we've gotten post office documents from

[08:05.800 --> 08:16.600]  radio network
[08:16.600 --> 08:23.680]  okay ladies and gentlemen we have the Korea situation open talk of nuclear
[08:23.680 --> 08:28.840]  war world war three notice this is all happening as the global financial
[08:28.840 --> 08:34.040]  banking system collapses the world economy by design you have Israel the
[08:34.040 --> 08:38.920]  United States and others openly talking about a first strike on Iran that
[08:38.920 --> 08:49.640]  could trigger just all sorts of very draconian scenarios you openly have the
[08:49.640 --> 08:55.960]  federal government butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution spying on the
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.840]  American people with no warrants publicly setting up FEMA camps openly
[09:00.840 --> 09:06.320]  turning loose cyber command on the internet propaganda intensifying all
[09:06.320 --> 09:10.920]  over television where they demonize anyone that questions the government in
[09:10.920 --> 09:16.560]  shows like CSI our terrorist anybody who questions vaccines are murdering
[09:16.560 --> 09:20.600]  terrorist anybody who questions fluoride in the water is an unamerican
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.920]  terrorist they're just going for broke this is a hot revolution against our
[09:25.920 --> 09:35.760]  freedom there there's no doubt this is super bad news now I received
[09:35.760 --> 09:43.680]  information this morning and was asked what I thought about it and it comes
[09:43.680 --> 09:51.680]  from a good source and I know the source that comes from them and then I know
[09:51.680 --> 10:03.720]  the source that received it and I only got this in about the last hour and a
[10:03.720 --> 10:08.640]  half and I'm gonna be quite honest with you I'm gonna play a couple of video and
[10:08.640 --> 10:13.920]  audio clips right now so I have time to go work on this some more before I start
[10:13.920 --> 10:24.000]  talking about it I know that the post offices have come out in the model
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.040]  state's health emergency powers act in mainstream newspapers where it's leaked
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.240]  here and there where firemen and police have talked not knowing you know they
[10:33.240 --> 10:36.400]  were compartmentalized not knowing they were supposed to keep it secret that
[10:36.400 --> 10:41.560]  they are to be used in forced inoculation centers and as distribution
[10:41.560 --> 10:45.040]  centers where they take in on you know the whole town and then people are put
[10:45.040 --> 10:50.480]  through databases and certain people are sent off to FEMA camps others are
[10:50.480 --> 10:58.360]  released others are tagged this has come out in government documents namely and
[10:58.360 --> 11:02.920]  I've got Watson working on it right now I remember this it came out in Utah and
[11:02.920 --> 11:09.840]  Colorado and New Jersey of all places in 2002-2003 during the model state's
[11:09.840 --> 11:13.200]  health emergency powers act remember the feds were trying to pass that they
[11:13.200 --> 11:16.360]  went ahead and implemented it through executive fiat but it was forced in
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.000]  oculation for everyone in America with live smallpox then they started the
[11:21.000 --> 11:25.800]  shots with police military firemen and a whole bunch of people died had heart
[11:25.800 --> 11:30.640]  attacks it caused an autoimmune response in the ventricles of the heart so they
[11:30.640 --> 11:35.080]  had to suspend it you remember that seven years ago seven and a half years
[11:35.080 --> 11:41.240]  ago and then it also came out in the clergy response team documents that
[11:41.240 --> 11:45.080]  have been confirmed to be real now it's on mainstream news four years later how
[11:45.080 --> 11:47.960]  great it is that the pastors are preparing their flocks for the FEMA
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.280]  camps for the false force inoculations and we know they've got brigade
[11:52.280 --> 11:55.920]  homeland and martial law training and the entire military is being given
[11:55.920 --> 11:59.320]  martial law and gun confiscation training see we've gone from all of that
[11:59.320 --> 12:06.120]  being rumored to it being confirmed now and in le09 trips from 14 nations
[12:06.120 --> 12:09.480]  training to take on the American people and Obama saying we've got a strength
[12:09.480 --> 12:14.080]  in international institutions for a new international order and all this global
[12:14.080 --> 12:19.920]  government talk now the world economy is being collapsed right now it may
[12:19.920 --> 12:23.720]  completely implode the next month or it may take two years I don't know but
[12:23.720 --> 12:27.880]  every expert we talk to that I trust and my own research shows there is no
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.480]  putting this back together again they have purposefully destroyed the world
[12:32.480 --> 12:37.000]  economy as dr. Paul Craig Roberts said here a month ago before he wrote off
[12:37.000 --> 12:45.720]  into the sunset and this offensive against liberty and freedom is going on
[12:45.720 --> 12:50.400]  worldwide in plain view right now all the stops have been pulled out all the
[12:50.400 --> 13:01.680]  chips are on the table and I do have documents and I have called some of the
[13:01.680 --> 13:12.480]  numbers and their real numbers this morning and I am ferreting through some
[13:12.480 --> 13:19.080]  more of this and we have a clip of this in police state for the rise of FEMA but
[13:19.080 --> 13:23.040]  I've got Jason Douglas right now pulling the actual raw video out we're going to
[13:23.040 --> 13:26.960]  post that on my YouTube channel to dovetail because at the time I went up
[13:26.960 --> 13:33.360]  there and when they were down the hall talking to some other media I ducked
[13:33.360 --> 13:38.680]  into some offices and began shooting video of everything and they had
[13:38.680 --> 13:44.560]  genetic engineering blood testing facility I got some video of that and I
[13:44.560 --> 13:50.600]  ran over and it said alien detention center combatant detention center and
[13:50.600 --> 13:54.360]  of course it had been on the news they were looking at that to be a FEMA holding
[13:54.360 --> 13:58.480]  facility I mean that that had been confirmed the year before but people
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.280]  you know said oh Alex you're making that up when I called in on talk radio when I
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.240]  called into my own show and I was out of town when Jason was sitting in when I
[14:07.240 --> 14:16.760]  covered it and then since then of course we went through all the video found it
[14:16.760 --> 14:22.720]  from 20 something hours we shot and put it in police state for but I didn't kick
[14:22.720 --> 14:26.000]  my heels or blow my horn and say look you know here's the footage inside the
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.640]  facility but but people are in denial about that so I'm gonna I'm gonna post
[14:30.640 --> 14:34.640]  that like I'm gonna have Douglas just post where I duck into the room and
[14:34.640 --> 14:38.480]  everything we'll just post that for you I mean again it's in police state for
[14:38.480 --> 14:41.400]  but we just show the documents there I'm gonna I'm gonna put the raw
[14:41.400 --> 14:48.680]  footage up of me sneaking around in the facility but yeah people never expect
[14:48.680 --> 14:51.560]  you to do bold stuff like that I mean she literally ducked into a room for about
[14:51.560 --> 14:56.680]  one minute I just ran into the office and you can see me flipping with
[14:56.680 --> 15:01.880]  documents the blueprints I got out of the room one second before she came back
[15:01.880 --> 15:15.760]  out but the point is this clicks to be accurate and real when I have and I've
[15:15.760 --> 15:18.440]  got to go get back on the phone with one of the sources right now so I'm gonna
[15:18.440 --> 15:21.920]  go out to break with myself on Russia today yesterday that we're gonna come
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.160]  back with Ron Paul straight talk in the next segment and then I'll continue after
[15:26.160 --> 15:33.640]  that we'll see if I'm gonna go ahead and break this on air but go ahead and go
[15:33.640 --> 15:39.600]  to the video and audio here it is blame Canada remember that fun song from South
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.400]  Park well now some people are blaming Canada or at least it's government for
[15:44.400 --> 15:48.880]  promoting itself using public money on the internet apparently the Harper
[15:48.880 --> 15:53.240]  government has been monitoring political messages online and also correcting
[15:53.240 --> 15:58.600]  what it considers misinformation radio host Alex Jones is in taxes and he
[15:58.600 --> 16:02.680]  joins me now for more in the story so Alex the headlines here read Harper
[16:02.680 --> 16:07.520]  government monitoring online chats about politics what is this all about is it
[16:07.520 --> 16:12.280]  legal is it infringing on privacy rights and if so how are they able to get away
[16:12.280 --> 16:17.640]  with it well it is true that this is going on and there's so many facets to
[16:17.640 --> 16:22.120]  it and as they say this is only the tip of the iceberg really the echelon group
[16:22.120 --> 16:26.920]  of countries so the England American establishment Canada the US England
[16:26.920 --> 16:32.680]  Australia New Zealand but also much of Western Europe for over 15 years I have
[16:32.680 --> 16:37.920]  scores of different programs sent come the US military out of Florida has a
[16:37.920 --> 16:47.320]  program to go out and covertly post pro-war views and you know all sorts of
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.960]  other un-American information pro-torture pro-secret arrest pro-patriot act
[16:52.960 --> 16:57.320]  information all over message boards all over websites they have dirty tricks
[16:57.320 --> 17:02.760]  campaigns and so of course Canada is involved in this as well I mean they
[17:02.760 --> 17:07.200]  have just billions and billions of dollars that is spent every year on
[17:07.200 --> 17:11.520]  things like this but then we also have what they call behavior placement goes
[17:11.520 --> 17:15.160]  further than product placement where government pays to have certain
[17:15.160 --> 17:20.400]  messages and sitcoms and dramas and in movies so what's happening is the
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.240]  people are beginning to realize that this is going on but this has been
[17:24.240 --> 17:29.760]  happening for a long long time and the bigger issue just isn't privacy it's
[17:29.760 --> 17:35.360]  the creepiness of the government secretly doing this and that the scale of
[17:35.360 --> 17:40.320]  it is only increasing but if it's so creepy and if people are finally or as
[17:40.320 --> 17:44.120]  you say finally realizing it so why isn't everyone up in arms about I mean we
[17:44.120 --> 17:46.960]  don't really hear this a covered anywhere be that you know there's no
[17:46.960 --> 17:53.400]  protests outside of DC you know about this at all well it's hidden in plain
[17:53.400 --> 17:58.200]  view I mean it's kind of like Reuters the Associated Press even Fox News in the
[17:58.200 --> 18:04.280]  last month came out and said yeah our troops help grow the opium in Afghanistan
[18:04.280 --> 18:08.960]  and they help ship it out our but if we don't grow it the Taliban will get it
[18:08.960 --> 18:13.800]  and then they'll make the money off of it I mean that's the type of garbage that
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.480]  goes on so yeah they're in plain view with the new Supreme Court nominee saying
[18:18.480 --> 18:22.640]  she's for banning free speech she's for banning the First Amendment she's for
[18:22.640 --> 18:26.920]  but Alex let's get back on topic here you know about this kind of thing I'm
[18:26.920 --> 18:30.240]  just trying to face is what I'm saying right I'm trying to understand you know
[18:30.240 --> 18:35.120]  is this something within Canada I mean if I if you or I write something bad are
[18:35.120 --> 18:38.280]  they gonna monitor this as well or is this something internal with the Harper
[18:38.280 --> 18:43.280]  government no this has been going on long before Harper you know I ship books
[18:43.280 --> 18:47.360]  and videos that we have on our online video bookstore at info wars.com all
[18:47.360 --> 18:51.640]  over the world they they can get into communist China easy they can get into
[18:51.640 --> 18:57.800]  Russia they can get into Germany it is hard to get a videotape you know legal
[18:57.800 --> 19:02.920]  film into Canada the only place I've ever been stopped for 15 hours and sworn
[19:02.920 --> 19:09.120]  at and cussed at and screamed at and threatened was Canadian customs Canada
[19:09.120 --> 19:14.480]  is basically a jack-booted thug government with a bunch of well-meaning
[19:14.480 --> 19:20.960]  Canadians who were ignorant to just how draconian their government is Canada is
[19:20.960 --> 19:24.240]  one of the biggest police states on earth they have some of the most draconian
[19:24.240 --> 19:30.360]  laws against free speech up there but it has the touchy-feely neoliberal surface
[19:30.360 --> 19:34.840]  of a supposed democracy and so it's systemic the government monitors
[19:34.840 --> 19:38.800]  everything the government's been caught with their royal mounted police dressed
[19:38.800 --> 19:43.520]  up like anarchist attacking their own police as a pretext to shut down
[19:43.520 --> 19:51.160]  demonstrations Canada is one of the most oppressive regimes in the western
[19:51.160 --> 19:55.480]  world they're just very good at hiding it and they've got their spies all over
[19:55.480 --> 19:58.400]  the streets you name it.
[20:00.200 --> 20:05.400]  Fact four million people in the US have hepatitis C due to liver damage. Fact
[20:05.400 --> 20:09.600]  cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans. Fact
[20:09.600 --> 20:13.920]  alcohol, mini prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides and environmental
[20:13.920 --> 20:18.480]  toxins damage the liver. Fact one in 10 Americans is or has been affected by
[20:18.480 --> 20:22.600]  liver or gallbladder disease. Fact anything that keeps the liver from doing
[20:22.600 --> 20:26.360]  its job can put your life in danger. Protect your liver by visiting

[21:08.760 --> 21:12.920]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights. Not
[21:12.920 --> 21:17.320]  democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they
[21:17.320 --> 21:20.680]  think they own our land, they think they're on our water, children, our
[21:20.680 --> 21:26.240]  education, our money. We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[21:26.240 --> 21:32.040]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the
[21:32.040 --> 21:35.480]  facts, we have the Constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.

[22:00.240 --> 22:03.720]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal
[22:03.720 --> 22:07.440]  Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with
[22:07.440 --> 22:11.160]  catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently
[22:11.160 --> 22:14.120]  placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[22:14.120 --> 22:17.840]  accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your
[22:17.840 --> 22:21.880]  deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket
[22:21.880 --> 22:25.840]  through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run
[22:25.840 --> 22:29.680]  followed by a depressed economy. A current effort is underway by the Fed,
[22:29.680 --> 22:33.240]  along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[22:33.240 --> 22:36.960]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity
[22:36.960 --> 22:41.240]  can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a
[22:41.240 --> 22:45.600]  conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and
[22:45.600 --> 22:50.200]  silver. While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its
[22:50.200 --> 22:56.520]  own has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[22:56.520 --> 22:59.840]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[22:59.840 --> 23:06.920]  Fatigue, headaches, allergies and asthma, chronic disease. Is your home making you sick?
[23:06.920 --> 23:11.080]  Here's a fact. Our indoor air quality is getting worse, and the causes include
[23:11.080 --> 23:16.120]  chemicals, toxic gases, dust, pollen, dander, and even chemtrail particulates. To

[24:08.240 --> 24:12.360]  Hello, this is Rick Pall with your weekly update for May 24th.
[24:12.360 --> 24:18.080]  Congress, with its insatiable appetite for spending, is set to pass yet another
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.720]  supplemental appropriations bill in the next two weeks. So-called supplemental
[24:23.720 --> 24:28.440]  bills allow Congress to spend beyond even the 13 annual appropriations bills
[24:28.440 --> 24:34.480]  that fund the federal government. These are akin to a family that consistently
[24:34.480 --> 24:38.600]  outspends its budget, and therefore needs to use a credit card to make it
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.480]  through the end of the month. If the American people want Congress to spend
[24:43.480 --> 24:49.040]  less, putting an end to supplemental appropriations bills would be a start.
[24:49.040 --> 24:55.280]  The 13 regular appropriations bills fund every branch, department, agency, and
[24:55.280 --> 24:59.400]  program of the federal government. Congress should place every dollar in
[24:59.400 --> 25:05.640]  plain view among those 13 bills. Instead, supplemental spending bills serve as a
[25:05.640 --> 25:10.240]  sneaky way for Congress to spend extra money that was not projected in budget
[25:10.240 --> 25:15.640]  forecast. Once rare, they have become commonplace vehicles for deficit spending.
[25:15.640 --> 25:21.240]  The latest supplemental bill is touted as an emergency war spending bill needed
[25:21.240 --> 25:26.840]  to fund our ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. The emergency's never seen
[25:26.840 --> 25:31.000]  to end, however, and Congress passes one military supplemental bill after another
[25:31.000 --> 25:38.600]  as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drag on. Many of my colleagues argue that
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.960]  Congress cannot put a price on our sacred national security, and I agree that the
[25:43.960 --> 25:48.920]  strong unequivocal defense of our country is a top priority. There comes a time,
[25:48.920 --> 25:53.920]  however, when we must take stock of what our blank checks to the military
[25:53.920 --> 25:59.000]  industrial complex accomplishes for us and where the truth leads to American
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.520]  citizens' lie. The smoke screen debate over earmarks demonstrates how we have
[26:04.520 --> 26:08.600]  lost perspective when it comes to military spending. Earmarks constitute
[26:08.600 --> 26:13.040]  about $11 billion of the latest budget. This sounds like a lot of money, and it
[26:13.040 --> 26:17.640]  is, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the $708 billion spent by the
[26:17.640 --> 26:25.080]  Pentagon this year to expand our worldwide military presence. The total
[26:25.080 --> 26:31.480]  expenditures to maintain our world empire is approximately $1 trillion
[26:31.480 --> 26:37.680]  annually, which is roughly what the entire federal budget was, 1990. We spend
[26:37.680 --> 26:41.600]  more on defense than the rest of the world combined and far more than we
[26:41.600 --> 26:45.440]  spent during the Cold War. These expenditures, in many cases,
[26:45.440 --> 26:51.000]  permit resentment that does not make us safer, but instead makes us a target. We
[26:51.000 --> 26:56.000]  referee and arm conflicts the world over and occupy some 140 countries with
[26:56.000 --> 27:01.160]  nearly 1,000 bases. With this enormous amount of money and energy spent on
[27:01.160 --> 27:05.520]  efforts that have nothing to do with the security of the United States, when the
[27:05.520 --> 27:11.480]  time comes to defend the American soil, we'll be too involved in other adventures
[27:11.480 --> 27:16.360]  to do so. There is nothing conservative about spending money we don't have
[27:16.360 --> 27:21.280]  simply because that spending is for defense. No enemy can harm us in the way
[27:21.280 --> 27:24.920]  we are harming ourselves, namely bankrupting the nation and destroying
[27:24.920 --> 27:29.520]  our own currency. The former Soviet Union did not implode because it was
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.280]  attacked, it imploded because it was broke. We cannot improve our economy if we
[27:34.280 --> 27:40.600]  refuse to examine all major outlays, including so-called defense spending.
[27:40.600 --> 27:48.320]  Thanks for calling this update. The update is placed on this number, 888-322-1414,
[27:48.320 --> 27:54.640]  every Monday morning. The written text can be found on my website, www.house.gov
[27:54.640 --> 28:00.160]  slash paul under the heading Texas Straight Talk. All right and Ron Paul is
[28:00.160 --> 28:03.600]  scheduled tomorrow, but they usually give us a confirmation, phone, call, or
[28:03.600 --> 28:06.240]  email a day or two before we haven't gotten that, so he's not on tomorrow, I
[28:06.240 --> 28:09.640]  should be on next week. Got a lot of important questions for him on the
[28:09.640 --> 28:14.640]  economy, on the in-the-fed bill compromise that he called to sell out in the
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.880]  Senate, a lot of other issues. We look forward talking to him about North Korea
[28:19.880 --> 28:26.720]  and a lot more, Congressman Ron Paul. I'm still working on this post office story.
[28:26.720 --> 28:33.640]  Now we've confirmed that they do have criminal interrogation facilities at
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.320]  bigger post offices for mail fraud, both of their employees and the general
[28:38.320 --> 28:42.520]  public with postal inspector power. This issue deals with them being radically
[28:42.520 --> 28:46.240]  expanded around the country and everything they do has dual use and
[28:46.240 --> 28:51.120]  what we've confirmed is they do plan on using post offices as relocation
[28:51.120 --> 28:55.920]  centers as forced inoculation centers and that came out in 2002 under the
[28:55.920 --> 29:01.920]  Model States of the Emergency Powers Act. So I have confirmed that these new
[29:01.920 --> 29:08.880]  documents we've gotten are real, but this came from a contractor involved
[29:08.880 --> 29:15.960]  building it and some of the things that they've added cannot be confirmed. So I'm
[29:15.960 --> 29:20.000]  what is the point? It's like if you caught your neighbor stealing a billion
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.240]  dollars, so what have you caught him stealing another billion? I mean all the
[29:23.240 --> 29:29.200]  government does is lie, steal, and cheat. They're totally illegitimate. I mean
[29:29.200 --> 29:32.440]  what's the point? It's like if they catch a serial killer who's killed 10 people,
[29:32.440 --> 29:36.160]  you know, he's gonna fry on the electric chair. So what if he killed 10 extra? I
[29:36.160 --> 29:40.480]  mean at a certain point they're caught red-handed. I mean look at this USA Today
[29:40.480 --> 29:43.800]  article as they promote the progress of their destruction of our economy.
[29:43.800 --> 29:50.040]  Private pay shrinks to historic lows. We'll be back.
[29:50.040 --> 29:59.400]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.400 --> 30:05.160]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order. A new
[30:05.160 --> 30:10.560]  world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning indictment
[30:10.560 --> 30:14.080]  of the globalists through their own words and documents. The new world order
[30:14.080 --> 30:18.560]  really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the
[30:18.560 --> 30:23.120]  world under their control. The United Nations would take over America. The
[30:23.120 --> 30:27.880]  Trilateral Commission would control the world. Invisible Empire chronicles how
[30:27.880 --> 30:32.240]  men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an
[30:32.240 --> 30:36.200]  oppressive world government. I believe first of all that we now need nothing
[30:36.200 --> 30:39.680]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global
[30:39.680 --> 30:43.800]  governance with the establishment of the G20. So it's gonna be an inner ruling
[30:43.800 --> 30:48.760]  elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone. Invisible
[30:48.760 --> 30:54.480]  Empire. Secure your competence today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or

[31:00.160 --> 31:04.320]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going
[31:04.320 --> 31:08.400]  into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do
[31:08.400 --> 31:12.800]  you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the
[31:12.800 --> 31:17.120]  lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want?
[31:17.120 --> 31:21.680]  When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can
[31:21.680 --> 31:25.640]  you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your
[31:25.640 --> 31:29.520]  children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go
[31:29.520 --> 31:33.800]  to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you
[31:33.800 --> 31:38.360]  have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and
[31:38.360 --> 31:42.920]  your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can
[31:42.920 --> 31:47.120]  get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[31:47.120 --> 31:55.400]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again that
[31:55.400 --> 32:03.320]  number 1-800-409-5633. The question is where should the American people draw
[32:03.320 --> 32:09.320]  their line in the sand? What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is
[32:09.320 --> 32:13.400]  based on a constitution which protects minority rights. Not democracy, not mob
[32:13.400 --> 32:17.000]  rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner. So they think they own
[32:17.000 --> 32:22.240]  our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money. We have
[32:22.240 --> 32:27.400]  to define who we are and what we will tolerate. Somebody's gonna ask you what
[32:27.400 --> 32:32.240]  you did during the Patriot uprising. We have the facts, we have the
[32:32.240 --> 32:36.080]  Constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law. Knowledge is power
[32:36.080 --> 32:40.040]  ladies and gentlemen and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me,
[32:40.040 --> 32:44.240]  Rise of the Republic. Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that
[32:44.240 --> 32:48.480]  is the American people is rising. A new tool in the info war. Don't Tread on Me.
[32:48.480 --> 32:56.080]  Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139
[32:56.080 --> 33:13.080]  and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[33:13.080 --> 33:21.760]  Okay, we're probably going to have a surprise guest on in the last hour
[33:21.760 --> 33:26.640]  today. I'll just leave it with that. It's about a 90% chance right now we're
[33:26.640 --> 33:35.160]  gonna have them on. That's some important COG, black state, black site, New
[33:35.160 --> 33:42.040]  World Order, martial law, FEMA camp information. And then we have Dr. Andrew
[33:42.040 --> 33:50.280]  Wakefield on. Rand Paul has been chosen as the person to have a media hoax run
[33:50.280 --> 33:55.720]  on him to demonize all anti-establishment candidates, both Republican and
[33:55.720 --> 34:01.720]  Democrat, winning every primary in every state and every special election in the
[34:01.720 --> 34:09.840]  last year. Every incumbent is being thrown out. 100%. This has never happened
[34:09.840 --> 34:14.040]  and it's happening in both parties. That's never happened. The people are
[34:14.040 --> 34:19.560]  really waking up. And so you notice North Korea that our government gave nukes is
[34:19.560 --> 34:22.600]  now threatening to nuke everybody. And you notice Israel's about to go into Iran.
[34:22.600 --> 34:34.360]  A nice political smokescreen. So you have this hoax going against Rand Paul that
[34:34.360 --> 34:39.320]  he wants to keep black people out of McDonald's completely made up. He never
[34:39.320 --> 34:43.040]  talked about the Civil Rights Act. He never talked about repealing it. They
[34:43.040 --> 34:49.320]  know that standard libertarian procedure for any mainline libertarian is of
[34:49.320 --> 34:53.640]  you say should the Ku Klux Klan be allowed to keep black people out? Yes.
[34:53.640 --> 34:57.720]  Should the black Panthers be allowed to keep white people out if they want? Yes.
[34:57.720 --> 35:03.720]  Should a black Masonic Lodge be able to keep blacks or whites out or any other
[35:03.720 --> 35:14.200]  group? Yes. Can albino Indians keep everybody else out but albinos? Yes. Can
[35:14.200 --> 35:25.320]  the Bohemian Grove keep women out as a private male club? Yes. That's all. But
[35:25.320 --> 35:31.880]  they run this hoax, this national hoax, thousands of articles a day saying
[35:31.880 --> 35:40.120]  basically that he wants to put a halter around a black man and have him drag a
[35:40.120 --> 35:45.960]  plowshear through the cotton fields or something. That's the same kind of hoax
[35:45.960 --> 35:52.920]  they're running against Andrew J. Webfield. I haven't counted up all the
[35:52.920 --> 35:58.040]  studies but it's in the hundreds. It's actually in the thousands. They've
[35:58.040 --> 36:04.040]  known for hundreds of years that mercury causes brain damage and is especially
[36:04.040 --> 36:08.760]  toxic to young children in their neurological development. And major
[36:08.760 --> 36:13.240]  universities have done tests with human brain tissue, living tissue, pig brain
[36:13.240 --> 36:18.520]  tissue, chicken brain tissue, the list goes on and on, that the most deadly heavy
[36:18.520 --> 36:23.400]  metal to brain tissue or to nerve endings period is mercury. It has an
[36:23.400 --> 36:29.240]  electrochemical response and doesn't just kill the brain cells it comes in
[36:29.240 --> 36:34.200]  contact with like other heavy metals. It causes an electrochemical explosion, a
[36:34.200 --> 36:41.560]  chain reaction. So he did all these studies in his own office. He paid people
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.560]  to take part in studies and the media knowing the public's ignorant about how
[36:45.560 --> 36:51.720]  studies are done runs around going my guys he paid people to take part in the
[36:51.720 --> 36:58.120]  study. That means he bought them off. Well every study out there unless it's the
[36:58.120 --> 37:11.000]  government grabbing people using the CPS I mean they always pay you for studies
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.440]  and so they've now had the British government ban the doctor who linked
[37:14.440 --> 37:21.320]  autism to vaccine. No he's not the only doctor that did this. Any parent who's
[37:21.320 --> 37:29.320]  experienced their 18 month old running around laughing talking being intelligent
[37:29.320 --> 37:33.720]  and suddenly they go get their third round of shots they have a convulsion in
[37:33.720 --> 37:39.160]  the way home they sleep for two days and when they wake up two days later they
[37:39.160 --> 37:44.360]  can't talk and they're going to wear diapers for the rest of their life.
[37:44.360 --> 37:48.040]  Cause and effect folks you walk out in front of a truck going 50 miles an hour
[37:48.040 --> 37:51.000]  you're going to get some broken bones if you're lucky you're going to die if
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.840]  you're not. But then we know what mercury does we
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.720]  know what the vaccine inserts say can cause neurological disorders.
[37:59.720 --> 38:03.400]  I know a bunch of people in Austin took the H1N1 shot
[38:03.400 --> 38:06.600]  and then their feet and hands became numb and they went to the doctor and they
[38:06.600 --> 38:21.160]  said you had a vaccine reaction
[38:21.160 --> 38:27.880]  and so this is the type of stuff that we deal with
[38:27.880 --> 38:39.800]  they're just mass hoaxes hoaxes
[38:39.800 --> 38:44.840]  and so everything they do they target the public
[38:44.840 --> 38:52.440]  with hype with just dumbed down propaganda oh that was discredited
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.480]  that mercury can cause autism. Remember the propaganda five years ago
[38:57.480 --> 39:00.520]  they would lie on the media and say we've taken the mercury out
[39:00.520 --> 39:03.720]  there is no mercury and then parents would go to the clinic or to the
[39:03.720 --> 39:06.840]  hospital or to their doctor's office and say hey I want to
[39:06.840 --> 39:10.200]  I want to see the insert and then the nurse would say honey cake
[39:10.200 --> 39:18.840]  come on there's no mercury in my ear over and over again
[39:18.840 --> 39:22.200]  and then they'd say I want to see it and the parents would say look it says the
[39:22.200 --> 39:28.440]  marisol and the nurse would say it's what your child needs we lied to you
[39:28.440 --> 39:36.120]  for your own good all over the country
[39:36.120 --> 39:40.120]  honey I'm calling the cps on you for your own good
[39:40.120 --> 39:45.960]  your child needs the vaccines the government wouldn't hurt you
[39:45.960 --> 39:49.160]  sure we've been taking your blood at birth for
[39:49.160 --> 39:53.400]  38 years and putting it in a pentagon database
[39:53.400 --> 39:58.200]  it's for your own good we're gonna take good care of you
[39:58.200 --> 40:03.000]  I take all the vaccines I'm 41 years old and I've
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.600]  battled cancer twice and I take all the shots
[40:08.600 --> 40:16.040]  I trust my government join the cult become a body snatcher like us
[40:16.040 --> 40:20.360]  oh they're not body snatchers you know turned into some alien creature from
[40:20.360 --> 40:27.560]  spores that rode the solar wind they're spiritual body snatchers they just
[40:27.560 --> 40:31.160]  oh Elena Kagan wants to ban the first amendment and the second amendment oh
[40:31.160 --> 40:35.160]  that's good yeah I like her
[40:35.160 --> 40:38.760]  oh the government admits they're growing the opium now just like it's oh yeah
[40:38.760 --> 40:42.920]  we're growing it what's the big deal
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.840]  oh the trillions we've taken over 28 trillion haven't gotten new numbers in
[40:46.840 --> 40:49.480]  five months I'm sure it's 35 trillion now but
[40:49.480 --> 40:52.680]  we've taken 28 trillion we're not gonna tell you where it went and we've taken a
[40:52.680 --> 40:56.200]  trillion plus the last two weeks in Europe and we won't tell you where that
[40:56.200 --> 40:59.560]  went and then just yeah we are training the clergy to tell
[40:59.560 --> 41:03.720]  their flocks it's of the lord to go to the camp
[41:03.720 --> 41:07.240]  oh we are training the preachers to tell their flocks to take the inoculations
[41:07.240 --> 41:11.560]  and go to the camps but uh still it's a conspiracy theory
[41:11.560 --> 41:14.840]  that camps are being built
[41:16.440 --> 41:19.720]  it's just in the houston chronicle in the new york times in the washington
[41:19.720 --> 41:24.600]  post in the wall street journal that how aberton just in one
[41:24.600 --> 41:30.280]  contract got three one million man camp contracts
[41:30.280 --> 41:34.920]  doesn't matter if they're publicly training and riot
[41:34.920 --> 41:38.120]  suppression and door-to-door gun confiscation and door-to-door
[41:38.120 --> 41:42.280]  coordinating of neighborhoods to arrest people in the new watch list and they're
[41:42.280 --> 41:45.160]  openly announcing it
[41:46.120 --> 41:49.320]  no they announce it all this is a military psi op
[41:49.320 --> 41:55.400]  they announced they're doing it and then say i've got this csi clip
[41:55.400 --> 41:58.760]  steve watson wrote an article about it i'm going to play it later in the next
[41:58.760 --> 42:02.520]  hour when we go live at prison planet dot tv
[42:02.520 --> 42:07.560]  and remember we're not even monitoring television
[42:09.400 --> 42:16.680]  here's an example i turn on any television program on big
[42:16.680 --> 42:24.200]  abc cbs nbc or fox any fiction program and it is 100
[42:24.200 --> 42:29.480]  percent brainwashing and conditioning
[42:29.480 --> 42:33.880]  anti-family pro inoculation pro martial law
[42:33.880 --> 42:39.000]  pro warrantless wiretapping pro warrantless swat teams everyone is
[42:39.000 --> 42:42.680]  guilty everyone deserves to be tortured torturing children
[42:42.680 --> 42:47.320]  is good all the big movies coming out unthinkable
[42:47.320 --> 42:51.960]  you know the torturing people's children cutting off their fingers
[42:51.960 --> 42:56.040]  and in the real world that's going on at black sites all over the planet
[42:56.040 --> 43:01.240]  but then i just see an article that's that steve watson wrote
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.720]  and you watch the television clips and it's a professor who believes get this
[43:07.720 --> 43:10.760]  in kim trails
[43:11.320 --> 43:16.920]  and that water fluoridation is bad for you and so the police go look at this
[43:16.920 --> 43:21.320]  unamerican piece of filth he believes fluoride's bad and they just go
[43:21.320 --> 43:27.400]  can you believe it now imagine how creepy that is
[43:27.400 --> 43:31.000]  to have national government funded that's now admitted
[43:31.000 --> 43:36.360]  behavior placements what they call it i call it propaganda placement
[43:36.360 --> 43:39.960]  government paid for messages
[43:40.840 --> 43:48.200]  where the police look at the what the professor is teaching in class
[43:48.200 --> 43:52.760]  and they say oh he's gotten in trouble as a professor for teaching his students
[43:52.760 --> 43:57.000]  things like this and he goes water fluoridation
[43:57.000 --> 44:02.120]  and the cop goes this guy is so unamerican
[44:02.120 --> 44:08.200]  so the message is if you don't like being forcibly medicated with
[44:08.200 --> 44:11.880]  a chemical that's that has a skull and crossbones on the bag
[44:11.880 --> 44:17.240]  and says causes organ failure and cancer and is a cumulative toxin that's why
[44:17.240 --> 44:20.840]  they do it none of it leaves your body almost all
[44:20.840 --> 44:23.640]  of it stays in you
[44:23.880 --> 44:28.680]  and these people are so evil
[44:29.720 --> 44:34.200]  that now all these weak-minded jellyfish who don't talk to their neighbors don't
[44:34.200 --> 44:37.160]  talk to their kids they get home at six o'clock
[44:37.160 --> 44:40.360]  they put an msg
[44:40.360 --> 44:45.400]  aspartame oh yeah it's in most the food now
[44:45.400 --> 44:51.560]  chemical weapon laced microwavable
[44:51.560 --> 44:55.400]  franken food that's got sterile in senate on record
[44:55.400 --> 44:59.000]  the gmo in every case is designed to sterilize you
[44:59.000 --> 45:06.200]  they pop it in the microwave go over turn on the television set and then you
[45:06.200 --> 45:10.440]  have every program every fiction program jam packed with
[45:10.440 --> 45:15.480]  brainwashing and in this particular piece
[45:17.080 --> 45:19.880]  of course the professor turns out trying to
[45:19.880 --> 45:23.240]  a chemical weapon attack an entire building he is a terrorist of course it
[45:23.240 --> 45:25.640]  turns out that anyone who's against water
[45:25.640 --> 45:29.000]  fluoridation is a terrorist that wants to murder you and your family
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.720]  now think about the psychology there all these scientists the head toxicologist
[45:33.720 --> 45:37.480]  for the epa we've had them on testified before congress
[45:37.480 --> 45:43.560]  over 90 of the epa scientists and letters to their own agency saying
[45:43.560 --> 45:47.320]  this is deadly poison killing the people it's a cumulative toxin
[45:47.320 --> 45:51.000]  it's a toxic waste we need to take sodium fluoride out of the water
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.920]  and all these other chemicals that they put in on design by design it's not by
[45:54.920 --> 45:59.720]  accident now the people that watch shows like
[45:59.720 --> 46:05.880]  csi
[46:05.880 --> 46:11.400]  the message is you're anti-american
[46:11.400 --> 46:15.160]  water fluoridation he's criticizing that how unamerican
[46:15.160 --> 46:18.520]  and of course the bigger issue here is how dumb
[46:18.520 --> 46:22.760]  does the establishment think you are i mean how obvious where the villain
[46:22.760 --> 46:26.600]  believes water fluoridation is bad
[46:26.600 --> 46:34.040]  i mean these actors know full well what they're doing they're mercenaries
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.880]  i think the actor's name is gary senes
[46:39.640 --> 46:45.880]  the one who plays the part i don't know i don't watch csi
[46:45.880 --> 46:50.760]  but it's every you are bathed in pure brainwashing
[46:50.760 --> 46:55.000]  i mean that's an evil government that's an evil media
[46:55.000 --> 46:59.560]  it's all covert it's all illegal they've got sitcom all over the web attacking
[46:59.560 --> 47:02.360]  myself and others they've got the fcc saying they're
[47:02.360 --> 47:05.000]  going to take over the internet shut down free speech you've got
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.400]  every major white house son are saying it you've got the republicans going along
[47:09.400 --> 47:14.360]  with it i mean we're in trouble folks
[47:16.280 --> 47:21.320]  and they've got all these women shows and my wife goes and shows me clips of
[47:21.320 --> 47:24.760]  them where the mother that doesn't want to inoculate is a murderer and abuses
[47:24.760 --> 47:30.360]  her child or the woman who wants to keep her
[47:30.360 --> 47:34.680]  information private as a terrorist or the woman that doesn't want to abort her
[47:34.680 --> 47:39.000]  baby is a piece of trash it's just you're bathed in it
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.840]  but the good news is the public's waking up to this and so the system goes
[47:42.840 --> 47:46.840]  all right activate kim jong il we gave him nukes
[47:46.840 --> 47:51.240]  tell him to go completely ape and we'll give him some more money
[47:51.240 --> 47:58.680]  all right get israel ready to bomb iran we'll start world war three
[47:58.680 --> 48:02.360]  and remember in all of this those of you that psychologically think you can make
[48:02.360 --> 48:06.040]  a choice to serve the system oh i i think the new world order is big and
[48:06.040 --> 48:09.400]  scary i think i'll just join it psychologically
[48:09.400 --> 48:13.960]  you know psychological level i'll just rationalize and go ahead and go along
[48:13.960 --> 48:16.040]  with it you're going to get smashed flattered in a
[48:16.040 --> 48:20.200]  pancake okay do you understand that you are not part of the power structure
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.680]  you're not part of the winning team cops bureaucrats
[48:24.680 --> 48:32.840]  firemen preachers lawyers politicians mid-level corporate people
[48:32.840 --> 48:37.880]  mercenaries now a lot of you mercenaries know that you're just scared you've
[48:37.880 --> 48:40.120]  been inside the system you know how evil it is
[48:40.120 --> 48:44.200]  you've shipped in the narcotics you've laundered the money
[48:44.200 --> 48:48.040]  you've run the dine court child kidnapping operations with 500 plus
[48:48.040 --> 48:51.960]  children to be loaded onto those jets on those eastern european tarmacs many of
[48:51.960 --> 48:54.920]  them for snuff films you understand the black-hearted
[48:54.920 --> 49:01.000]  hell pit that's been opened but just remember ladies and gentlemen
[49:01.000 --> 49:04.120]  that we've got to get the message out to people
[49:04.120 --> 49:08.040]  that that that they're so scared of us that they have villains
[49:08.040 --> 49:13.240]  in show after show who want to poison the water supply
[49:13.240 --> 49:19.080]  but they're teaching their kids in college their students that sodium
[49:19.080 --> 49:21.880]  fluorides bad in the water see the double thing
[49:21.880 --> 49:25.240]  it's just like when they accuse 911 truthers of working for al-qaeda
[49:25.240 --> 49:28.360]  and claim that we're going to stage terror attacks in all these talking
[49:28.360 --> 49:30.680]  points
[49:33.080 --> 49:36.040]  you understand it's like saying santa claus is the grinch
[49:36.040 --> 49:42.280]  or batman uh is the joker it's upside down it's like saying
[49:42.280 --> 49:46.520]  jesus is satan we're the groups openly exposing the
[49:46.520 --> 49:50.520]  terrorists so they come out and say no you're the ones planning to blow stuff up
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.200]  or they say oh yeah anybody warning you about fluoride
[49:54.200 --> 49:57.720]  they're a terrorist well remember jack t ripper
[49:57.720 --> 50:02.440]  and dr strangelove the stanley cubrick film he's gonna nuke
[50:03.640 --> 50:06.280]  the world he's gonna start world war three because
[50:06.280 --> 50:11.720]  he doesn't like sodium fluoride the water it's the same talking point
[50:11.720 --> 50:15.080]  if you don't want poison in the water you want a nuke
[50:15.080 --> 50:18.760]  cities you want to poison
[50:19.640 --> 50:25.720]  you're un-american and then that same reporter that was down here a

[52:07.400 --> 52:11.880]  collective action invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalist
[52:11.880 --> 52:16.120]  through their own words and documents the new world order really is a tool for
[52:16.120 --> 52:20.280]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their

[52:28.280 --> 52:31.880]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[52:31.880 --> 52:35.720]  to establish an oppressive world government i believe first of all

[55:10.280 --> 55:14.360]  gate ever happened uh they say that oh two different groups have
[55:14.360 --> 55:18.520]  exonerated the climate gate people uh yeah the british government hired
[55:18.520 --> 55:23.080]  two top global warming fraudsters who are openly on the big payroll of these
[55:23.080 --> 55:25.640]  groups to come out and say global warming is
[55:25.640 --> 55:31.720]  still real and the emails mean nothing systemic organized lying fraud
[55:31.720 --> 55:36.680]  everywhere and they go on abc news and say you're basically a white
[55:36.680 --> 55:39.400]  supremacist
[55:39.400 --> 55:46.120]  and it's the same stinking thing with rand paul they just make it up
[55:46.120 --> 55:49.400]  it's the same thing with doctors that do studies that show that
[55:49.400 --> 55:52.840]  there's an autism increase from vaccination no kidding
[55:52.840 --> 55:56.120]  we've gone from what an average of six vaccines 40 years ago
[55:56.120 --> 56:01.000]  to over 55 vaccines by 18 months and we wonder why we've gone from one in
[56:01.000 --> 56:06.440]  25 000 to one in 68 i mean when i was in high school the
[56:06.440 --> 56:10.520]  special ed was one room and i was in a big foray high school
[56:10.520 --> 56:14.200]  now it's entire wings i go to the park and there's
[56:14.200 --> 56:17.480]  autistic kids running around moaning and bumping into
[56:17.480 --> 56:22.360]  things poured poor things everywhere i take my kids to a movie two three rows
[56:22.360 --> 56:27.960]  will be filled with autistic children their brains savaged
[56:29.400 --> 56:34.760]  and what does mercury do what is mercury poisoning do they knew 150 years ago
[56:34.760 --> 56:37.880]  because they had child laborers that worked in the tanning factories
[56:37.880 --> 56:42.680]  where they used mercury to tan leather
[56:42.680 --> 56:46.520]  and they stood by 150 years ago the british had already done studies and
[56:46.520 --> 56:49.240]  pulled the kids out of the tanneries because it made them
[56:49.240 --> 56:54.280]  basically start drooling in the corner oh shut up dan harris and all the rest of
[56:54.280 --> 56:58.200]  you you don't want to throw up we know mercury's rotting our
[56:58.200 --> 57:03.000]  children's brains oh you make me sick and by the way

[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.280]  i'm beside myself she's the only way to describe it
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:32.360]  i don't even hate these anchors these propagandas the people that make shows
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.960]  like csi where if you don't want to drink
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.320]  sodium fluoride you're a murdering terrorist or you don't believe in man
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:43.000]  make a little warming or racist that needs to be arrested
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.680]  i just realized they are part of the dark side they enjoy
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:50.760]  manipulating and lying to people and keeping people in darkness and ignorance
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.840]  and i like unleashing the human mind i like freedom
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:02.840]  and maybe it's me that's screwed up you know there's the old parable of
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.360]  in the kingdom of the blind the one eyed man is king
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.720]  or the land of the blind the one eyed man is king
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.960]  there's another parable of the wise king an evil witch comes into the kingdom
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:19.400]  and poisons the well that turns the people evil
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:23.320]  and the king hadn't yet drunk of the water
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:27.800]  and the wise king went and drank of the water and became evil and so
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.720]  he was then seen as sane and the people no longer wanted to kill him
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:36.120]  i think that's a twisted parable if i was teleported back a thousand years to
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.920]  the aztec kingdom and they were telling me i was crazy
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:42.040]  because i didn't want to chop up children every day when the sun came up and
[01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:47.880]  when the sun went down sacrifices in every city every day
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:53.080]  i would say that was insane but see i'm not in kansas anymore folks we're not
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.720]  in a free christian society anymore we're in the land of the new world
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:01.160]  order we're in the new dark kingdom
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:05.000]  where torture is good and torture of children is good and secret arrest is
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.080]  good and female camps are good and brain damage and disease and
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.840]  people all over your street dying of cancer at young ages it's it's
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.880]  it's it's beautiful
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:22.360]  to them by the way matt ryan showed me a clip he said oh look at this it's a
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.240]  secret blackwell and briggs video what do you think and i said
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.000]  that looks like it's fake but i mentioned it on air and when i got off
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.480]  there i went and had a chance to look it up
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.640]  was fake in 10 seconds it's all a you in front about oh be part of the good
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.280]  conspiracy and you know it's got the old
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.040]  communist line about secret high technology they always mix that in
[01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:46.280]  oh sustainability and and you know not wasting and
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.400]  the conspiracy is greed there's no world government
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.520]  there's no secret group the conspiracy is all of us it's greed
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.240]  it's just like zeitgeist another you in front i'm sure
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:02.120]  it's got tren resner uh part of the video you know saying i'm not part of
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.800]  the good conspiracy no i'm not part of it to create some type of hype
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:09.800]  so i'm going to do a youtube video about that today
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.680]  we discovered because they can't beat us they're going to join us they're going
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:16.360]  to pose as and maybe tren resner's not a bad guy i i don't know i can't pass
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:20.840]  judgment but but this this this this new video that's
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.840]  out there is as fake as a three dollar bill
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.040]  and i guess that's really my frustration is that i do all this research and i
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.560]  understand all of this now like within 30 minutes of getting off this
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:39.800]  radio yesterday i had already confirmed that
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:48.680]  michael hilton 99 percent is tied into a new
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.680]  private security firm basically posing in houston as regular police
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.360]  that's the people from hard montana again that's the
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:02.840]  16 felony count that's just
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.560]  and i know what'll happen when we break this news for a week people say it's
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.800]  not real there aren't fake police in houston and then when it comes out
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:17.320]  that it's real it's just
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.200]  oh do you realize how creepy it is i just keep going back to this that you turn
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:27.880]  on any television program and it's pure brainwashing demonizing good people
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:32.680]  you realize how creepy it is that they've got well over 50 000 preachers now
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.400]  trained to go in and brainwash their flocks in a secret
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.320]  fema operation i mean you know how evil it is when they
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:43.240]  get up on television and tell you our troops grow the opium in afghanistan
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:48.280]  but it's a good thing i mean my god
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.480]  of course they're going to take your pension funds of course we're all slaves
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.120]  of course they're building fema camps i mean we gotta wake up now folks
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.640]  there's no time to screw around here
[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:05.320]  with the implementation of codex alimentarius it is clear that we must
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:08.520]  act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:12.760]  preferences are concerned as of january 1st 2010 codex
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:15.800]  alimentarius was implemented within the european union
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:19.240]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements
[01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:23.480]  including colloidal silver we must take immediate steps to assure a continuing
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:26.920]  supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.120]  action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.440]  in the privacy of your own home colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:38.520]  used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.120]  their dangerous unpredictable side effects go to

[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:22.120]  coming up in about 30 minutes paul watson is going to post an article
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.160]  with some documents
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:34.280]  several of our sources both known to me were contacted separately about
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.120]  jail facilities being secretly and that's the big issue
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:42.280]  installed inside post offices around the country
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.760]  well paul watson and myself just did some searching this morning and found out
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:49.560]  that there are actually purchase orders for this
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:55.880]  and that they have a public cover for it you know claiming that the post
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.760]  offices and uh that the mail inspectors
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:04.520]  the postal inspectors
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:09.800]  are you know setting up these facilities for criminal investigations of mail
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:14.520]  fraud and to interrogate their employees so it always has a dual use
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:19.080]  but this is being radically expanded and watson was able to confirm because i
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.960]  was going off memory this morning when i was contacted with this info
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.880]  that during the model states health emergency powers act when they tried to
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.960]  force all the first responders in the country ahead of the general public
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.560]  you have to make the first responders take injections first
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:41.320]  that they did try to pass legislation to make citizens
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.840]  show up at postal facilities to take forced inoculations for smallpox and
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.480]  other vaccines you saw another beta test last
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.840]  year with the h1n1 hype
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.600]  where the federal government
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.560]  lobbied all 50 states and was successful in massachusetts in new york
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.320]  to have the government come out and say it's the law you must take
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:09.160]  uh the h1n1 shot but the people refused in mass
[01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.280]  so they had to back off so we know they're they're really trying to set this
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.800]  precedent to take our blood at checkpoints without warrants to naked
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.560]  body scan our bodies and to now they admit that that they lied about it
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:22.680]  earlier they are recording your body they are saving it
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.360]  they do make fun of people they do print off the naked printouts of
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.240]  movie stars they do make fun of their other employees
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.920]  genitalia size when tsa has to go through it
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:36.600]  and they now admit okay they're going in everywhere your children must do it
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:42.520]  we are recording their naked bodies again it's all about being over the top
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.600]  breaking our will
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:55.800]  and so that's just some of the news and information that we're going to be
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:59.160]  covering today what's in the next 30 minutes we'll post our
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:06.040]  story uh that that ties in to the rest of the confirmed
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.040]  fema camps clergy response teams federalization of police
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:13.640]  the mayak homeland security reports we're almost all the training is to take
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:18.840]  on gun owners conservatives libertarians returning veterans
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.360]  there can be no longer any doubt fema camps are real
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:25.720]  our country is one giant prison camp the public schools
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:29.400]  our acclimation centers for the prison society
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:34.440]  our bill of rights is gone there is warrantless wiretapping there is spying
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.600]  on the american people uh going on that's all illegal
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.600]  we have a criminal out of control government there can no longer
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:46.440]  be any doubt about that
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:53.480]  now first i want to go through some of the top stories today
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.960]  and then i'm going to get into just a small snapshot
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:02.840]  example of propaganda on television
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:13.800]  i can't watch abc cbs nbc fox it is physically painful because i am awake
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:17.400]  i am aware i understand their propaganda tactics
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:22.360]  and it is demoralizing to watch it because i feel so sorry for the people
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.440]  involved in the evil and i watched them enjoying it so
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.480]  much and and and being such willing participants
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.600]  in their own destruction
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.120]  that's why a lot of times i say no to mainstream media coming down here and
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.040]  interviewing me because just the spirit of the reporters
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:50.360]  the arrogance the uh hootspa the bravada the satisfied
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:54.440]  satisfaction that they're part of the system and
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:59.720]  they're they're so self-assured and and many of them know the systems corrupt
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:05.080]  and brutal and evil and they just enjoy being part of it
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:11.640]  dan harris
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.640]  is a diminutive um Napoleonic individual
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.520]  nothing against that i'm i'm only you know five
[01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.200]  ten and a half eleven uh but i always i'm kind of like a chihuahua i think of
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:27.480]  myself as huge so i've never really had an issue with not
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.400]  being really tall but this guy i think he's like five three or something
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:38.440]  and uh very calculating very manipulative
[01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:41.000]  and i said i know you're going to come down here and not air and i know you're
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.200]  getting foul footage and lying to me and saying it's going to air
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:48.280]  and i know that you're not going to return my phone calls once you leave
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:53.160]  but i said come on down here it's nightline and abc nightly news both
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.680]  come on down here same thing with chris mathews people
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:14:00.920]  same thing with hbo same thing with all of them i mean i
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.040]  they're just they've all been told get footage of jones
[01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:07.640]  so that after we bust a cap in his butt or set him up or do whatever we're
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.360]  going to do we can have something out there to
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.080]  knit together
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.880]  but see i go willingly to the slaughter i'm not like you i didn't sell out
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.320]  i know you think you're beyond good and evil and this is the way the world's
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.400]  always been and there's always been an elite so you might as well just join it
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.560]  and be part of it and buy into it
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:43.560]  you are so foolish
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.160]  but more and more i've gotten to the point
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:59.080]  where i don't even want to analyze their evil i don't even want to sit here and
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.960]  put it all on display and point out all the facets of it
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.800]  i mean if the public can't see
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:12.840]  the unbelievable corruption and looting and tyranny
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:17.400]  that is spreading like a metastasizing cancer
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.680]  what's the point i mean
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:24.760]  for anyone that studied history and propaganda
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:29.160]  when you can flip from channel to channel on the news and on dramas
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:34.520]  and on every other program and all it is
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:40.440]  is brainwashing and demonization and attacking gun owners and family rights
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:43.640]  groups and homeschoolers and people that are against gmo
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.600]  food and people that don't want to drink sodium fluoride
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:52.040]  i mean that's all it is because if you wake up and stop eating the gmo
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.760]  if you wake up and stop drinking the sodium fluoride that's giving you
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:58.360]  cancer and sterilizing you if you wake up to the vaccines killing you
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.000]  it's over for these murdering pieces of trash they get off on it they write
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.280]  textbooks about how they're poisoning you they think it's funny
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.560]  and they say as evidence that you deserve to die
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:16.600]  is the fact that they're out in the open and you're so stupid you don't care
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.520]  in fact let me just get to this first here before i get into world stocks and
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.360]  our economy being destroyed by design of what's happening in north korea
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:28.040]  because this just this just illustrates everything
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:32.840]  let's go ahead and play this clip abc news attempts to align climate change
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:38.440]  skeptics with white supremacist and then
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:45.000]  dan harris of abc nightly news he says who was in my office three weeks ago
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  he says oh and there have already been two uh groups that have cleared
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.600]  climate gait of any wrongdoing yeah they've cleared themselves
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.640]  we've covered those whitewashers you notice he doesn't tell you who's cleared
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:02.280]  them he just tells you they've been cleared
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:06.360]  man made global warming is real pay al gore attacks everything's fine
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:09.880]  but they imply that you're white supremacist i mean
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.960]  you can go out there and find white supremacist on giant message boards
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.920]  covering any subject you want oh you don't like salted butter
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:22.200]  i bet they can find a white supremacist or they can go pose as one on the
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.600]  message board who's against salted butter
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.720]  and say if you're against salted butter you're a white supremacist
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.720]  oh look we got white supremacist that are against man made global warming
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:37.720]  uh oh they're threatening people meanwhile they don't mention here that
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.920]  it's the eu and the british government that have called
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:45.480]  for arresting people like lord montan myself and others
[01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:50.360]  who criticize man made global warming they want to make it illegal
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:53.480]  they're they're the ones it's cast sunstein in the white house
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:57.160]  that wants to make it illegal they're the ones that want to shut people up
[01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:03.080]  but they imply that the poor innocent abc news reporters
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.760]  the poor innocent you know uh they're all under attack the poor innocent
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:13.560]  you know reporters talking to to man with the made up hockey stick graph and
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.160]  my gosh the white supremacist are after him you're not with white supremacist

[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:34.920]  children they're on american here it is the ongoing oil spill crisis in the
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.200]  gulf is keeping the debate over climate and energy very much in the
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:42.120]  headlines and that debate is becoming increasingly venomous
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.960]  with many prominent climate scientists now saying that they
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.600]  are being severely harassed i hope someone gets you in a dark
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:55.080]  alley the fb i tells abc news it's looking into a spike in threatening
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:59.000]  emails to climate scientists like penn states michael man
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.840]  six feet under with the roots is where you should be i was hoping i would see
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:07.320]  the news that you committed suicide do it it's an attempt to chill
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:10.200]  the discourse and i think that's what's most disconcerting
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:13.960]  a white supremacist website recently posted man's picture
[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.200]  alongside several other climate scientists with the word jew next to
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:22.840]  each image to many scientists however the most disturbing recent development
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.440]  was a report released by republican senator james inhofe
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:31.000]  naming 17 climate scientists some of whom inhofe says have engaged in
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.920]  potentially illegal behavior all right scientists have said that it's
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.680]  we're gonna come back so you notice white supremacist jew next inhofe
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.520]  it is criminal that they knowingly lied to get research funds
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.120]  that they knowingly we have the un memos where they got them to lie
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.800]  so they could get this new global tax
[01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:55.800]  but hey what's abc news today you don't want to pay al gore money

[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.800]  the ongoing oil spill crisis in the Gulf is keeping the debate over climate
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:11.160]  and energy very much in the headlines and that debate
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.720]  is becoming increasingly venomous with many prominent climate scientists now
[01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:18.200]  saying that they are being severely
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.040]  harassed I hope someone gets you in a dark alley
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:26.840]  the FBI tells ABC news it's looking into a spike in threatening emails to
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.960]  climate scientists like Penn State's Michael Mann
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:32.680]  six feet under with the roots is where you should be
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.040]  I was hoping I would see the news that you committed suicide
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.720]  do it it's an attempt to chill the discourse and I think that's what's
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:43.800]  most disconcerting a white supremacist website recently posted
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:47.320]  man's picture alongside several other climate scientists
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:52.200]  with the word Jew next to each image to many scientists however the most
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.800]  disturbing recent development was a report released by Republican
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:59.640]  senator James Inhofe naming 17 climate scientists
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:04.120]  some of whom Inhofe says have engaged in potentially illegal behavior
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.480]  some scientists have said that it's McCarthyite
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:10.280]  that is a word that that might be quite appropriate
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.680]  senator Inhofe's report was referring to an incident late last year known as
[01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:18.920]  climate gate where stolen emails gave the impression that climate
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:22.840]  scientists may have been trying to hide flaws in their research
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:26.280]  although several subsequent investigations have exonerated the
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.760]  scientists senator Spokesman Mark Moreno who now
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.920]  runs one of the most aggressive climate skeptic websites in the country
[01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:38.840]  did agree to an interview arguing that skeptics have been getting threats
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.120]  for years the public is appropriately angry
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:45.080]  at these scientists and again no one's advocating violence
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.680]  but it is it is refreshing to see these scientists here
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:53.080]  from the public it has been alleged that global warming
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:56.920]  climate change is a quote-unquote hoax that there's a conspiracy among
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.280]  scientists to sell us a bill of goods how do you respond to that
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:06.600]  it's nonsense um scientists are hyper competitive
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:11.480]  absolute baloney we have the emails between the top three institutions in
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.800]  europe england the u.s with nasa
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.320]  and we have all the heads of these groups making eugenics statements
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:26.760]  about destroying industrial society about wrecking the west
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:30.520]  and we have the un document we've we've written articles about it we've linked
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:35.640]  to the un documents on info wars dot com on prison planet dot com
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:39.800]  where a decade ago they got together with all the major universities and said
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.920]  we want socialism we want world government this is how we're going to
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:47.160]  take over society i mean they're on record saying it
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:51.400]  uh but dan harris laughs and he's like there are some that say his body
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.080]  language is how ridiculous there are some that say
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.440]  you know that scientists are working together to lie on this and
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:03.160]  the guy's like that's ridiculous uh scientists is so competitive oh really
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.520]  competitive for all the tens of billions of dollars of government
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.560]  research funds to fund the fact that the that there's no
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:15.320]  climate change and the and if there is climate change it's unnatural
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.080]  that the earth never has changes
[01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:25.960]  i mean it's just they couldn't get away with this
[01:27:25.960 --> 01:27:29.960]  if the public wasn't so dumbed down i mean do
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.680]  do abc news listeners realize how insulting that is how dumb they think
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:39.080]  you are how stupid they think you are
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:43.960]  and look at the body language of that professor
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:47.480]  when when harris says you know there's some that say you guys are all colluding
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:51.720]  and he just looks as guilty as a cat that's been caught with a canary in its
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:57.560]  mouth going oh ridiculous proposed or something
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:04.040]  i mean they've been caught red-handed everywhere this is a eugenics religion
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.680]  and then they've got the nerve to talk about Nazis
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.640]  when hitler was the big vegetarian environmentalist
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:12.840]  that wanted a world government to exterminate the majority of the world
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:16.920]  population and was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation on record
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.000]  along with Margaret Sanger then they talk about McCarthyites
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.120]  i've got to get watson or somebody do an article about this video
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:27.000]  just a few weeks ago they had big environmental groups saying we've tried
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.840]  to pass climate legislation the nice way now we
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:34.840]  need to get violent we need to shut these people down we need to arrest them
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:40.360]  meanwhile the poor little scientist the mccarthyites are after them
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:46.200]  mean mr inhofe who we just showed you nazis he might be connected to them
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:51.880]  we just showed you what nazi said on a message board now here's inhofe
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:56.440]  it's like oh the nazis are bad but inhofe is even what cuts to him
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.080]  he's calling for criminal investigations
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:04.760]  despite the fact that two commissions have exonerated
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:09.400]  the people involved in climate gate and found they did nothing
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.360]  now i could spend the entire broadcast every day
[01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:18.920]  doing nothing but covering news propaganda literally

[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:20.520]  at prisonplanet.tv if you just joined us and want to watch the show
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:24.760]  not just listen to it go over to prisonplanet.tv
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.640]  you know instead of just analyzing propaganda that's in the news
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:34.840]  the newspapers uh non-fiction fiction is where it's really
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:37.480]  yet because they know you're not paying attention
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.360]  you go to see a movie you watch a television show
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.960]  to forget about the real world but then you're being bombarded let me just
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:48.760]  explain to new listeners soviet russia communist china
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:52.600]  hitlers germany oppressive societies have
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:57.880]  state-run media but here we have something even worse something out of
[01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.920]  east germany where you have private media
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:04.600]  but it's basically all bought and paid for with what i call
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:09.240]  propaganda placement not just product placement now the media is given in its
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:13.160]  own term and admitting oh nbc's biggest advertising
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:20.440]  is the government and it is behavior placement
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:24.520]  and they admit bp comes to them and says we'll run bp commercials
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.360]  and spend all this money if you add behavior placement in this show
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:32.040]  pushing for a carbon tax this is all admitted
[01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:37.080]  the denial is over uh steve watson has a great article where he breaks down the
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.920]  white house bragging that they've now taken complete control
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:47.320]  of abc nbc and cbs the government is now in open control
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:52.280]  remember gore vidal eight years ago roger 911 went on cnn and said
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.720]  well i just want to say they just had an army colonel telling me what i couldn't
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:59.240]  couldn't say cy hersha said the same thing
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.600]  these are pentagon run when you're at fox news
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:09.720]  are cnn or cbs it is pentagon run this these are government
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:16.120]  organs now i don't know how conspiracy theory got on true tv i
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.080]  i guess they just think it's in the corner of television somewhere and
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:23.000]  it's mixed in with other programming and
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.880]  i'll talk to ventura about the next time he's on because he's marveling he
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.640]  he didn't think it would air but i think because of the sensational angle the
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.000]  establishment thinks it's all right i'm i'm i'm not sure
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.600]  the point is cbs propaganda placement conspiracy theories
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:44.200]  are anti-american domestic terrorist and i ended up uh last night watching
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:48.440]  almost the entire 44 minutes show 15 minutes or ads
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.680]  online
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.760]  and you can randomly watch in 24 csi
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:36:01.160]  any show it's the same thing every episode people that homeschool or
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:04.120]  terrorist or people that don't take vaccines or terrorist
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.240]  or people that aren't for abortion or terrorist or people that don't want
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.840]  fluoride in their water or terrorist people who are against gmo or terrorist
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:15.160]  or the mother doesn't vaccinate your kid dies
[01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:22.600]  or their homeschoolers and they torture their kids but the cps comes and saves
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:25.800]  them i mean it it's just wall to wall
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:29.560]  folks sometimes i'll randomly turn the tv on at night and just randomly surfed
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:35.320]  to a to a to a drama or sitcom and it's just all brainwashing
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:39.000]  that is a hundred percent proof of the evil of our government the evil of our
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:42.920]  media and that's why you have cast sunstein
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:46.680]  and alayna kagan and all these other white house zars
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:49.720]  and solicitor generals and the rest of them openly saying
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:52.280]  we're going to shut down freedom on the internet
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:56.280]  we're going to shut down alex jones there's open calls for it adl
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:00.440]  southern property law center uh new york times time to ban freedom of speech
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:04.520]  time to shut down these conspiracy theorists time to ban people that say
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.960]  global warming isn't real because we're kicking their butts
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.480]  we are smashing these people we are exposing
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:17.400]  them at every level and they know it and they
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:21.320]  can't stand it they are scared of what we're able to do together
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.280]  they know that the people are rising up and getting informed and getting
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.160]  involved and waking up to what's happening
[01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:30.680]  it is so vital for each and every one of you individually
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:34.120]  to reach out like an intervention like they're a heroin addict
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:38.120]  to go knock on that old lady's door next door and sit there and watch tv
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:42.600]  weather and drink tea or whatever and point out propaganda on television
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:46.600]  to talk to your boss your neighbor to show people
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:51.000]  you can watch any show and there's an anti-american agenda
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:56.200]  this isn't a free society we're just marinating and brainwashing
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:59.880]  now now let's go ahead and go to this piece you've got the one woman
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:04.920]  and who thinks the professor's okay but gary sinise you know the cool male
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:08.200]  leader type he says look this guy's anti-american
[01:38:08.200 --> 01:38:10.840]  he believes in chemtrails which they now declassified
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.880]  the white house science are admits there's a secret program to alter the
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:18.120]  atmosphere you know he gives associated press press conferences
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:21.880]  let's see they know you're not watching ap press conferences folks
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:26.280]  they know and and then he'll he's even more unamerican he thinks fluoride's
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:32.520]  bad in the water they imagine if anybody had common sense
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:37.240]  it'd be like if you traveled to the old soviet union say in the 70s
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.960]  and you could speak russian and you were in a hotel watching their news
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.280]  and they had some ridiculous propaganda it's how ridiculous the propaganda is
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:49.320]  it's like money python it's like brazil
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:54.280]  you know the movie brazil with a futuristic 1984
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:39:00.440]  with robert inero in it i mean it's like absurdist
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.280]  oh look he thinks fluoride's bad in the water he's anti-american
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.600]  oh look he wants to nerve get you know
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:13.240]  i mean folks they think you are idiots
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:16.760]  and i know i keep marveling hour after hour on this i i just can't handle it
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.080]  anymore
[01:39:20.360 --> 01:39:26.760]  it's every show it's pure brainwashing every stinkin show in fact others
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:30.040]  should do it i've talked for a decade about making a film about propaganda
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:34.040]  just showing the overt demonization of anyone for liberty or freedom
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.920]  but imagine turning on russian tv 30 years ago in them saying
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:42.520]  anyone who talks about a right to private property is evil terrorist that
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.640]  wants to kill you anyone that says us putting
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:50.840]  chemicals in the water uh is a terrorist the russians weren't even
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:55.480]  that ridiculous only in america do you turn it
[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:58.200]  on and it goes this guy's some kind of terrorist unamerican
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.360]  he thinks fluoride's bad the lady's like come on he's just a little eccentric
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.400]  then the other person says he got in trouble in college for teaching it
[01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:11.400]  the message is you better not criticize fluoride or you'll lose your job
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.520]  so there's a message to scare you because they know people all over
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.720]  folks i've i've read mainstream news articles on air
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:24.840]  texas monthly writer was making fun of me about fluoride in the water
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.680]  but he was for real he wasn't an evil demon because he'd exposed police
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.760]  framing people in texas i assessed him i did the interview the
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.680]  multiple interviews i hadn't checked into his family
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:41.400]  i later found out his wife works for the city of austin in the water system
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:44.440]  that's why he got really upset when i said sodium fluoride's causing bone
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:49.640]  cancer attacking every organ uh i emailed him the congressional
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.160]  hearings i emailed him the report were 90 plus percent
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:58.760]  of epa scientist uh as well as a bunch of fda scientists sent letters
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:01.800]  saying we hundreds of chemicals are put in the water
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.440]  under the name fluoride but fluoride itself doubles cancer risk
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:10.440]  and he kind of called up and apologized he said okay you know no i i'm shocked by
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:14.520]  this i'm shocked by this i'm and then later i did
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:18.040]  research on him and found out his wife you know works there so that's probably
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:21.880]  why he's shocked by it because i bet she doesn't even know
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:24.600]  even though she has a degree in wastewater management
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.600]  from the same procedures university he went to
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.200]  i forget the name of it what's the one up north of uh round rock
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:36.520]  what's that big university it's not big but it's southwestern yeah
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.680]  but but the issue was is that he you know he's got a southwestern degree his
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.600]  wife does she's in wastewater management works in the city of austin
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.520]  and he doesn't even know this so he was kind of shocked the next time we met and
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:52.360]  he pulled that out of the story you know that i'm this gook who thinks look it
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:56.200]  eats your freaking bones it attacks your damn brother i'm sorry i apologize i
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:59.720]  just can't do this show anymore okay i can't do it anymore
[01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:05.480]  they know the fluoride's killing us all right and i gotta watch shows on cbs on
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:08.440]  television where we're terrorists because we're
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.280]  warning people people they're giving it to their kids
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:16.120]  people they're giving it to the children
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:20.840]  you go to a babies or us or hgb food store and they've got big aisles of
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:25.560]  fluoridated water for babies at five parts per million
[01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:29.640]  one part per million causes a 20 point iq reduction on average
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:35.480]  major studies massively increases cancer attacks every organ
[01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:38.600]  and i'm the cook because i'm not supposed to get upset see they've trained
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:43.080]  everybody to be real calm in that mpr voice or like the rumpel still skin
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.720]  character in the new shrek hi that'll give rumpel still skin from that show
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:51.320]  an mpr show the person that did the voice
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.760]  i'm your friend oh the fluoride's good terrorists don't want you to drink it
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:02.200]  how does the public watch a show where the terrorists don't want you to drink
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.640]  fluoride i mean guys are you getting why i'm freaking
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:09.880]  out on this how obvious it is how ridiculous i mean if i was writing
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:17.320]  a fictional satire book about a off-the-charts bonkers tyranny
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:20.120]  this would be it
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.520]  i took my kids to see rumpel still skin uh saturday
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:34.120]  the new shrek movie and and it was very it was upsetting actually when i was
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:37.640]  watching rumpel still skin because that's exactly how these bureaucrats talk
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:41.160]  they're trained to have that cadence with their voice
[01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:45.160]  they're trained to be soothing and nice whereas i'm a regular person
[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.920]  i'm like a cornered dog i mean i'm growling and snapping and freaked out
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:52.520]  you know trying to reach out to people this is a normal response to turning
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:57.880]  television on and terrorist are people that don't
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:05.160]  want to drink their fluoride when on record it savages your body
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.960]  oh and you're not going to get away easily they now
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:10.680]  what was it four years ago in fact people won't believe it google it
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:15.960]  for fluoride approved as pesticide on crops and it goes through the membrane
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:20.680]  of the plants and precipitates nothing precipitates like fluoride
[01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:26.840]  especially sodium see almost all of it i've seen the studies 99 percent

[01:44:57.080 --> 01:45:00.440]  they love it like a psychopath loves grabbing a woman off the street who's
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:03.080]  hitchhiking and torturing her for three weeks
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:06.600]  before they finally use her up and kill her they're using us up

[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.280]  is paying that's admitted that's bad enough for messages
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:57.480]  in shows where people that talk about kim trails and sodium fluoride are
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.480]  terrorist the terrorist are the people that made
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:07.560]  that show come on come on wake up wake up out there
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.720]  come on wake up this isn't hard folks this isn't hard come on
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:17.560]  go check the epa scientist for yourself thousands of them signed petitions
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.720]  and i've had a bunch of them on including the uh leader of their
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:25.960]  of the union he talked about how it was like a spell
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:29.400]  he goes yeah all these years i hadn't looked at what sodium fluoride does and
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:33.320]  how deadly it is and how it precipitates out in his cumulative poison
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:36.840]  and i didn't know that under the name sodium fluoride it can be up to 350
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:42.680]  chemicals they put in the average water system is around 150
[01:46:42.680 --> 01:46:47.240]  and he said i just can't believe it i it's like the head dentist in canada he
[01:46:47.240 --> 01:46:50.840]  i we had him on years ago he's the guy that got the water fluoridated
[01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.640]  20 something years ago and then people sending the research that it was
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:57.240]  hundreds of chemicals under the name and that it wasn't calcium fluoride which
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.000]  is good in small amounts that it was deadly poison and he flipped out and
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.480]  warned people but it doesn't matter doctor
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.720]  it doesn't matter how many doctors how many chemists how many toxicologists
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.960]  how many epidemiologists how many brain surgeons go public
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.560]  they're going to make cbs movie shows where you're a terrorist
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:18.840]  let's go ahead and play the clip now let's go ahead and go to it here it is
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:23.800]  payton what are you two doing here
[01:47:23.800 --> 01:47:29.080]  hey i think i may know a little something about your poison victim
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:34.760]  and i'm here to prove a man innocent i got a little intel on professor scott
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.120]  he has a history of espousing various conspiracy theories
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:41.000]  sharing them with the students scarred him into a little trouble every
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.280]  university has at least one unconventional professor
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.640]  now come on payton this guy's idea is here totally anti-american look at this
[01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:54.280]  water fluoridation tsunami bombs chemtrails what are chemtrails now
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.920]  some people believe that vapor exhausts from aircraft are actually dangerous
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:02.520]  biochemicals dispersed into the air which only proves that kevin's a little
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:06.440]  odd prints from the table of show that both kevin scott and or jondo touched
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:10.280]  the case and analysis of the paper on the bottom of the bird cage
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.480]  does not confirm evidence of poison thank you many poisons are highly volatile
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.840]  they can evaporate within minutes just because it wasn't detected doesn't
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.040]  mean it wasn't there scott's background says he was
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:27.560]  recently forced into retirement by the university
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.000]  eight months ago he stopped teaching i never mentioned it there were also two
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.920]  recent arrests for public disturbance none of what you're saying sounds like
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:40.520]  the man that i know well we don't have anything that connects kevin scott
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:45.480]  to the poison or to our john does that okay sits on top see report and it goes
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.680]  on and on so so he's a guy who taught the kids that chemtrails are real
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:54.840]  no we're not saying all jet trails ice crystals
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:49:01.320]  are chemtrail spray we said in 95 all over the western world
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.640]  some planes began spraying even at low level condensation trails that do not
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:09.800]  dissipate then meteorologist and others who we've interviewed
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:17.320]  at major tv stations got samples found it was barium salts aluminum dioxide
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:23.800]  then in the last two years so about 13 14 years later
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.080]  the government comes out and says we've had a huge secret
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:34.040]  weather modification program going on that we're now going full scale with i
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:38.200]  mean if if the previous stuff was just a test i hate to see full scale
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:44.040]  and it's barium salts and aluminum dioxide to repair the ozone holes
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.680]  then if you know the ozone holes those are over only over antarctica
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:53.320]  the arctic in certain seasons and new zealand and by the way you don't hear
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.360]  about it anymore because it got smaller it's natural it's part of the
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:50:00.440]  electromagnetic field the point is
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:05.240]  that they don't even deny this but see they know the average person isn't
[01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:08.840]  just google john p holdren white house
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.720]  science are
[01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:19.080]  geoengineering and he'll admit and they've got all these government sites
[01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:23.160]  how they're chemtrailing us but see they know the jellyfish brain dead
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:28.040]  prozac head watching csi sitting there sucking down
[01:50:28.040 --> 01:50:32.200]  fluoride water has it isn't going to read a book
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:35.560]  isn't going to go to youtube and watch the head of the white house science
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:39.160]  program admit they're spraying us they're not going to do any of it by the
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.200]  way the weather modification is only a small part of the program
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:46.680]  and then there's the whole fluoride thing and of course it turns out he's a
[01:50:46.680 --> 01:50:50.280]  terrorist he's a terrorist he doesn't like chemtrails
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.040]  so the message is you talk about chemtrails you talk about
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:59.000]  poison in the water you are a terrorist okay so drink your water
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.640]  breathe your chemtrails and shut up nine years thousands of clients worldwide

[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.080]  in steve watson's article
[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:11.880]  he linked all the mainstream news reports where they say
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:15.240]  oh it's wonderful the government's funding most tv now
[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:21.880]  with messages messages for global government messages for carbon tax
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.800]  anti-second amendment messages
[01:54:25.800 --> 01:54:33.320]  totally illegal totally creepy courts ruled bush
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:36.760]  wasn't allowed to spend billions of dollars a year on fake news packages
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:41.320]  this is all criminal this is un-american but what is the message the
[01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:47.000]  government wants csi detective i have a little intel on
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:51.240]  professor scott he has a history of espousing various conspiracy theories
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:54.680]  sharing them with his students got him in a little trouble
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:58.600]  so see one cop walks up to the csi investigators hey
[01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:02.360]  he got a little trouble for his conspiracy theories the message is
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:05.480]  you lose your job because next they talk about he lost his job
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:11.400]  well good that's what you do you question things in america
[01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:16.680]  you read government documents this is so un-american
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:21.000]  oh i mean this guy's almost as bad as george washington
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.640]  professor's friends every university has at least one unconventional professor
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:29.480]  so she's she's defending it
[01:55:29.480 --> 01:55:33.080]  of course she's proven wrong second csi detective
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:39.320]  oh come on patent this guy's ideas are totally anti-american
[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:44.600]  his ideas are anti-american see ideas are bad
[01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.440]  meanwhile the globalists are destroying america robbing our treasury
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:52.600]  destroying our name oh but they're the good globalist
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:55.640]  they're the good guys
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:03.000]  oh come on patent this guy's ideas are totally anti-american look at this
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:10.440]  water fluoridation tsunami bombs kim trails
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:14.520]  well i remember the age newspaper i remember ap
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:19.320]  uh a decade ago
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:22.840]  we never said the tsunami was a tsunami bomb but
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:27.480]  it was declassified in the fifties the u.s the australians and the british
[01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:33.160]  looked at nuclear weapons to cause tsunamis so if anybody ever talked
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:35.480]  about a tsunami bomb and read it out of the newspaper
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:38.840]  the message is look you don't read stuff out of the newspaper
[01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:41.720]  the message is if you know anything about kim trails
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:45.480]  anything about water fluoridation anything about tsunami bombs
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:49.160]  notice they use three real things there
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:53.560]  they didn't say you're a terrorist who deserves to be fired from your job
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:56.520]  and he's later found to be a terrorist of course he's guilty
[01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:59.960]  if you believe in little green men oh no they promote that they want you talking
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.520]  about that all day on the news you know larry king live
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:08.680]  or if you're talking about a bombable snowman or bigfoot or any of that that's
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:12.040]  fine they don't want you talking about kim trails
[01:57:12.040 --> 01:57:16.600]  and they don't want you talking about water fluoridation uh uh uh
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:20.040]  and they don't want you talking about man made global warming not being real
[01:57:20.040 --> 01:57:23.880]  white house regulations are says you need to be

[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:34.200]  all right we've separately confirmed the intel that steve quail gave us
[02:00:34.200 --> 02:00:38.920]  uh dealing with detention centers inside
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:45.880]  for during civil unrest or financial collapse uh inside of the
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:48.920]  post offices so that's coming up the next hour
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:52.200]  and i did dig up some news articles from 2002 under the model states held the
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:56.360]  emergency powers act dealing with forced inoculations for smallpox
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:02.760]  to be carried out uh at the post offices so that's coming up next hour
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:08.520]  we have had it's got to be more than a hundred medical doctors and scientists
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:11.800]  and epidemiologists and virologists on over the years covering
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:15.400]  all the different studies about mercury in children's brains
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:19.800]  uh brain surgeons neurologists you name it and we know that autism has gone
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:23.320]  from what one in 25 000 two decades ago to one in
[02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:27.560]  68 some numbers are one in 55 and that's now admitted the government doesn't
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:30.920]  deny that and we they've linked crone's disease
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:34.120]  to the antibodies for the measles shot in the intestines
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:38.920]  we know that's way off the charts but the doctor who was chosen to be demonized
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:43.400]  as part of a media hoax is doctor andrew wakefield
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:48.120]  and it's just like ran paul he never said get rid of the civil rights act
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:52.040]  he said that private clubs should be able to have who they want
[02:01:52.040 --> 02:01:56.680]  in the case of bohemian grove wants to be all men or there's all women clubs
[02:01:56.680 --> 02:02:00.280]  sonia soto maior is part of one that's their issue
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:05.640]  but the media ran the national hoax that uh he is a racist with no evidence
[02:02:05.640 --> 02:02:09.320]  as the same thing with dr andrew j wakefield uh you've got the government
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:13.240]  the media caught putting out thousands of fake reports
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:18.280]  fake studies by the big pharma companies
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:21.480]  lying and saying there were no ill effects of the h1n1
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:25.320]  putting out fake data sheets at hospitals and clinics
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:28.360]  meanwhile the the actual insert with the h1n1 said
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:33.080]  can cause geoma rays can cause infertility can be linked to cancer
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.000]  can kill you you know that was on the insert but the hoax was
[02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.600]  no none of this is true so we're going to go to break
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.920]  come back here in one minute and and go straight to dr andrew j wakefield
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:50.280]  and his new book callous disregard autism vaccines the truth behind a
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.760]  tragedy and because he's one of the most prominent
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:57.400]  well-spoken doctors and works with uh jenny mccarthy and others and she wrote
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:01.400]  the forward to his book they have chosen him as kind of a general
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:06.440]  to try to assassinate politically and they run this hoax knowing the public
[02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:10.600]  doesn't know how research is done
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:15.160]  um you know he paid
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:18.520]  people to let him do research on them well that's how almost all studies are
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:22.120]  done and so they claim that that's unethical
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:27.640]  and it's just it's just all this made up baloney
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.960]  dealing with callous uh disregard and and so now
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:38.440]  they've got the headline uk bands doctor who linked autism to vaccine
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:42.680]  and they just imply that he's a big liar and now vaccines are good
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:46.520]  and it isn't six vaccines we want you to take by 18 months it's 50 plus
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.040]  and we want to give you a cancer vaccine an hiv vaccine
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:53.000]  an hpv vaccine that they admit killed a bunch of people
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.120]  and doesn't even protect you and basically we're going to set the
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:00.360]  precedent to forcibly inoculate you because it's all lies
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:06.680]  wakefields a liar uh with no evidence so you'll hear directly from the man
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.400]  on the other side of this break we're honored
[02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:14.760]  uh to have him here on the broadcast with us but
[02:04:14.760 --> 02:04:17.640]  you know who can deny ladies and gentlemen i mean i saw four or five

[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:29.880]  food and drug administration says it's okay and in the
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:34.360]  article it admits well it it it is linked to giving humans these diseases
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:40.280]  but so what or or sv 40

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:16.360]  all right i want to be clear here
[02:08:17.560 --> 02:08:23.480]  without even looking every day i see headlines like this one
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:29.240]  mutant polio virus spreads in nigeria and i see it happen in latin america
[02:08:29.240 --> 02:08:33.400]  in the middle east always the same u n program
[02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:37.320]  polio the dreaded paralyzing disease stamped out industrialized world
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:41.160]  is spreading in nigeria as health officials say in some cases it's caused
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:46.760]  by the vaccine used to fight it that's cbs news
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:51.000]  weaponized here's another one fda glax
[02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.240]  murk vaccines okay despite pig virus roiders
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:59.560]  and it says of viruses made by glaxosmith kline and murk
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:02.520]  are safe to use despite being contaminated with pig virus
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:06.280]  us health regulators said friday and then it goes on to admit
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:09.640]  that it can actually be linked to cancer and other health problems
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:16.280]  folks this is every day we read about uh well i mean i had wolf gain
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:19.960]  woodrog on a few months ago the head of the e u commission a medical
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:22.520]  doctor they got all the documents how the big
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:27.960]  five drug companies paid off the u.s british and e u government heads
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:31.560]  their doctors to come out and say you're all dead it's the most deadly thing in
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:34.040]  history hundreds of millions are going to die
[02:09:34.040 --> 02:09:39.400]  take the h1n1 shot and then his commission found it is a dangerous shot
[02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:44.040]  so what's happening is they're getting decimated they're losing their propaganda
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:47.400]  war and so what they'll do is they'll pick out a
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:53.480]  sacrificial goat uh someone to basically punish publicly
[02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.800]  uh to create a hoax so that people won't look at the masses of evidence and
[02:09:57.800 --> 02:10:01.320]  here it is uk bands doctor who linked autism to vaccine
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:04.440]  for three years they have savagely lied about him
[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:10.440]  misrepresented what he's done uh and and and now they've uh you know
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:14.680]  taken his medical license in england he's a british surgeon who lives in austin
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:19.240]  by the way researcher best known for his work regarding m mr vaccine and
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:24.200]  its connection with autism and inflammatory bowel disease
[02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:28.120]  and uh just a few days ago he lost his medical license in the uk but he's
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:31.560]  already moved here his new book is callous disregard autism
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:35.160]  and vaccines the truth behind the tragedy and you can get the book in
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:38.440]  bookstores everywhere it's forwarded by jenny mccarthy
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:41.960]  so we go to a dr andrew wakefield now

[02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.800]  supportive words you bet now just give us the
[02:10:51.800 --> 02:10:55.480]  backstory your awakening the studies you did which are backed up by a bunch of
[02:10:55.480 --> 02:10:59.240]  other studies i would add now and uh and then how
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:03.720]  they've tried to crucify you as a case point example
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:09.320]  i will and i'll try and be brief alex i am a mainstream academic gastroenterologist
[02:11:09.320 --> 02:11:14.840]  working in london may 1996 parents sorry 95 parents
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:17.640]  started calling me and saying my kid was normal
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.960]  they had this vaccine m mr and they lost their skills they lost eye contact i
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:24.440]  didn't want to play they couldn't speak anymore
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:27.240]  and they became autistic and i said i'm sorry you must have got the wrong
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:29.800]  number because i'm a gastroenterologist they said my kid has got
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:32.760]  terrible bowel problems diarrhea 12 times a day they're
[02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:36.760]  terrible pain they're banging their head against the wall i know they're in pain
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:39.800]  they're bloated and the doctor says your kids autistic
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:43.000]  they're bound to have these problems that doesn't make any sense at all
[02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.440]  so we investigated these children and they had the bowel disease
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:50.920]  so we did our duty our clinical duty to put the children before anything else
[02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:53.800]  to investigate them and we found they had a treatable bowel
[02:11:53.800 --> 02:11:57.720]  disease which the medical profession had ignored previously
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:02.440]  now the problem came is when the parents said and my child regressed after a
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:07.160]  vaccine if the child had regressed after natural chicken pox people would have
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:09.800]  found that fascinating and you and i wouldn't be having this conversation
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:13.000]  now but because it was a vaccine it could not happen
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.960]  and the parents are right about the bowel problem in their kids the doctors
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:20.760]  were wrong and therefore we had a moral and professional obligation to look
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:24.200]  at whether the vaccine was causing the problem that's when
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:28.760]  the trouble started so i said right i'm going to go back and i'm going to read
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:31.560]  every safety study that's ever been done
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:37.160]  on measles vaccines MMR vaccines i wrote a 250 page report i offered it to my
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:40.360]  colleagues i said i can no longer support the use
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:44.040]  of this vaccine because the safety studies are not there
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:47.800]  they're just not there uh doctor let me stop you right now i'm gonna need you
[02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:50.520]  to start over you you've backed away from your phone so we're having
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:54.200]  trouble hearing you okay yeah get close to your phone go
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:58.920]  ahead okay so we i i took the vaccine safety
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:02.760]  issue very very seriously and in many ways i wish i'd taken it more seriously
[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:07.240]  before i had vaccinated my own children alexa am i coming across now yes you
[02:13:07.240 --> 02:13:11.160]  are sir okay good and um and i made the recommendation
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:14.120]  that children should continue to be vaccinated but might get the single
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:17.480]  vaccines because uh i felt that the safety studies of the
[02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:23.080]  single vaccine measles mumps and rubella were better than those for mmr
[02:13:23.080 --> 02:13:28.040]  anyway this caused a meltdown because uh they didn't want that to happen the
[02:13:28.040 --> 02:13:31.800]  government didn't want that to happen and so i made that recommendation in
[02:13:31.800 --> 02:13:35.720]  february of 1998 and when demand for the single
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:39.480]  vaccine was at its highest uh six months later the government
[02:13:39.480 --> 02:13:43.320]  withdrew the license for that vaccine in the uk and so
[02:13:43.320 --> 02:13:48.200]  parents could no longer get the choice now why would you do that why would you
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:52.680]  take away a choice from parents for how they would protect their children
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:56.040]  by removing the single vaccine so measles came back
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:14:00.920]  they blame me and in fact the reason it came back is because they took away the
[02:14:00.920 --> 02:14:03.640]  choice it wasn't an anti-vaccine argument
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:08.120]  but it was saying give parents the choice of how they protect their children
[02:14:08.120 --> 02:14:11.720]  the government took that choice away
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:16.840]  dr wakefield going back to the beginning i've also seen research papers
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:21.480]  separate from yours that crones that didn't exist until the 50s and 60s
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:28.520]  has been linked to antibodies associated with measles vaccines uh and others and
[02:14:28.520 --> 02:14:32.520]  again i'm not a doctor but for any layperson if a child supposedly has a
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:36.280]  neurological disorder why would that cause them
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:40.600]  to have horrible diarrhea which anyone with an autistic child knows
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:45.160]  is associated with it i mean they know exactly what's going on here so let's
[02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:49.080]  let's break that down well okay the first question
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:53.960]  is why would why why would there be a link between a gastrointestinal problem
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:57.400]  and a brain disorder well this has been known for a long long time
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:01.480]  and we are what we eat in effect you'll know i mean i know because i like beer
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:05.720]  if i drink a beer then five minutes later i'm going to feel the effect in my brain
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:10.440]  so toxins neurotoxins from the from the intestine will get through
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:13.560]  and affect the brain and the drugs that we give to treat
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:16.520]  psychological and psychiatric psychiatric conditions
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:20.680]  are absorbed through the intestine we also know that there are diseases like
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:23.400]  liver failure where the more you become jaundiced
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.400]  then your brain stops to work and then you ultimately go into coma
[02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:32.120]  and die and that is because bacterial products from the gut are getting
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:35.240]  through and injuring the brain because the damaged liver
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:39.400]  isn't filtering them out so this concept that there is a link between the
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.160]  bowel and the brain is as old as the hill
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:46.760]  is it relevant to what's happening in children with autism i think so
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:50.200]  but the most important thing is it generates testable ideas
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:54.520]  testable scientific ideas that can be looked at and what we find is when we
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:59.480]  treat the children it tested then in many cases the brain improves that's very
[02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:02.200]  exciting because before this we were dealing with a
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:05.560]  disease that is untreatable the kids got autism put them in a
[02:16:05.560 --> 02:16:11.240]  home forget about them now we can start to do something about it
[02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:15.480]  and the system is mad because you're a prestigious doctor you're well spoken
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:18.440]  your research has now been backed up by other studies
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:21.720]  and so they have now crucified you or they're attempting
[02:16:21.720 --> 02:16:25.000]  to destroy you but i think this is going to backfire on them
[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:29.000]  well i you know to be honest it could become their worst nightmare because
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:32.440]  i have been constrained from saying anything so far
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:36.280]  because of the legal process now that's over and i can speak
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:40.680]  during the course of the hearing in the uk that you were talking about being
[02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:43.800]  regulatory hearing i obtained a lot of documents
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.160]  which are going to be very very embarrassing for the government because
[02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:51.320]  what they exposed is why they went to these lengths to discredit me in the
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:56.520]  first place and um what is interesting is that uh
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:00.120]  when we got involved in litigation on behalf of the children as a medical
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:03.960]  expert i thought that we were litigating against the pharmaceutical
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:06.520]  company in fact we weren't in the uk we were
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:11.640]  litigating against the government why because when we introduced the uk the
[02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:16.280]  mmr vaccine in the uk it was a very it was a dangerous
[02:17:16.280 --> 02:17:19.480]  vaccine that was introduced it had already been withdrawn in
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:23.720]  canada for safety reasons but it was introduced in the uk
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:27.000]  knowing that there was a problem but because
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:33.160]  it was made by the home team it was made by a uk company and so
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:37.160]  they appear to have given a preferential market share
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:43.000]  to the uk company despite the fact that they knew the vaccine had problems
[02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:47.000]  and the uk company reluctant to get involved in that
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.360]  seems to have got an indemnity from the government so the government
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:54.280]  assumed their liability for vaccine damage they didn't want that news to
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:56.600]  come out
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:00.440]  doc we've got here for the rest of the hour and i want to go through
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:03.720]  their disinformation because when i watch the news they say
[02:18:03.720 --> 02:18:08.440]  he paid people to be in his study oh my gosh well every study i've ever seen
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:12.440]  they paid people and and they imply you're this liar and you've been caught
[02:18:12.440 --> 02:18:17.400]  in this fraud but we know as vaccination has gone up
[02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:21.000]  autism has gone up we've seen all these other studies now
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.080]  connecting not just autism but crones to vaccines i want to discuss that
[02:18:25.080 --> 02:18:29.240]  and from your research your studies what the mechanism is
[02:18:29.240 --> 02:18:33.720]  what's happening to the intestines via this vaccine
[02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:37.400]  that is then attacking the brain and the treatments you found
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:41.800]  for parents out there that have children uh so they can hopefully reverse
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:44.440]  uh some of the things that have happened because because of you and jenny
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:48.840]  mccarthy and many others the system again is really scared
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:52.120]  they've got dr dina dell and others who says by the way vitamins are bad for
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:18:57.080]  you he says i mean it's incredible uh out there basically lying about you
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:01.880]  guys building strong men they are really desperate but the good news is
[02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:05.640]  all the studies all the research shows the people are really waking up to how
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:08.840]  dangerous these vaccines are but the system doesn't care it's like
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:12.520]  the uh human papillomavirus or the garter cell
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:16.040]  in their trials it killed a bunch of people it's killed a bunch of people
[02:19:16.040 --> 02:19:19.480]  sense but they don't care they're out there saying take it take it take it
[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:22.760]  and in the insert it says doesn't even protect you
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:26.920]  from cervical cancer so we'll talk about that with dr andrew wakefield
[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:31.080]  uh when we come back uh from this quick break
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:35.240]  on the other side uh and we'll give you his website we'll tell you more about
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:40.600]  the book callous disregard autism vaccines the truth behind a
[02:19:40.600 --> 02:19:46.760]  tragedy ordered by jenny mccarthy uh all i want to do is save children
[02:19:46.760 --> 02:19:50.040]  i can't tell you how many parents i've run into on the street who don't even
[02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:52.600]  know who i am and i and their child's autistic
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:56.360]  and i say when did that happen 18 months took a third round of shots

[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:19.160]  strange days have found us okay we've got Dr Wakefield on with us
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:23.560]  where should we start here because yeah what your study showed
[02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:28.520]  what's causing the autism what is it in the vaccines that's triggering this
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:32.200]  we're now entire wings of public schools are for children
[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:37.080]  drooling in the corner as the shots increase the retardation
[02:24:37.080 --> 02:24:41.080]  accelerates the government says everything's fine take more injections
[02:24:41.080 --> 02:24:45.720]  we love you mercury's good for you all these new diseases that are associated
[02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:49.000]  with it and and then let's get into your
[02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:53.960]  persecution and and the false claims they've made about you
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:58.440]  okay so so so what did your studies show
[02:24:58.440 --> 02:25:01.560]  we do the first study showed that there is a
[02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:04.920]  an unsuspected bowel disease in children with autism that there is
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:08.200]  inflammatory bowel disease in children who
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:12.200]  historically thought to have a psychological or psychiatric problem
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:18.520]  and that was really the main crux of the finding in the original study
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:23.640]  in eight of the ten children the parents made a clear
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:28.520]  association between the onset of symptoms and exposure to the
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:35.800]  mmr vaccine but looking at your study and other
[02:25:35.800 --> 02:25:39.560]  studies what is happening in the intestine
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:43.000]  well i mean that just to sort of back that up now
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:46.120]  they're in five countries of the world the same bowel disease has been
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:49.320]  confirmed in the u.s in venezuela and italy
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:54.120]  in canada and the uk so is there a bowel disease in children with autism i think
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:57.800]  absolutely the answer is yes so we confirmed it has been confirmed that
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:02.120]  what was reported in the last it is right and then the question is well why
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:06.360]  and our speculation was that medial virus or
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:10.040]  some part of that vaccine but most likely the medial virus
[02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:13.880]  was producing injury to the intestine and uh
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:17.640]  there are reasons to suspect that that's the case is it happening we don't know
[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:21.640]  but we need to look at it and we certainly can't brush it under the carpet
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:25.400]  because it's an uncomfortable question now at the moment the jury is out
[02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:27.960]  some studies say yes there is evidence of measles
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:31.720]  and other studies say no there is but that's why they're angry is because
[02:26:31.720 --> 02:26:35.240]  other studies are confirming what you've said but regardless
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:39.080]  we suddenly have these children in 18 months with a third round of shots
[02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:43.560]  in multiple countries they get the mmr and they're not saying hi mommy hi daddy
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:46.600]  puppy kitty i want to go play at the park
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:51.240]  you know junior is bye bye yeah absolutely i can the most important
[02:26:51.240 --> 02:26:55.960]  question of all is why are there so many sick children why there's so many parents
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:59.880]  reporting the same story i just got back from china and china they had no
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:04.200]  autism apparently now they've got um between four and five million children
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:07.480]  with autism they're estimated one one home i was told about
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:11.240]  three thousand children alone but it's no idea what to do with the
[02:27:11.240 --> 02:27:14.840]  story there is exactly the same so these are not parents who are on the
[02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.280]  internet or communicating with parents in the u.s making it up
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:22.760]  they tell the same well it's like if you it's like if horses drink out of a
[02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:26.040]  poisoned pond and all the horses fall over dead
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:29.320]  you know there's poison in the pond i mean this is this is two plus two equals
[02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:33.640]  four something's going on yeah no doubt at all and i think the
[02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:38.840]  wrong questions have been asked um by the government they're trying to avoid
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:43.080]  even questioning the safety of vaccines and they've been mandated by the
[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:46.600]  government to look at vaccine safety in the context of autism
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:51.560]  and they're doing everything they can to avoid that now you have to ask why
[02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:55.400]  why surely in the interest of children's health you would want to know whether
[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:58.840]  there's a link or not it's only to protect the vaccine
[02:27:58.840 --> 02:28:02.600]  program by maintaining public confidence but no they seem
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:07.240]  not to wish to look at these issues
[02:28:07.240 --> 02:28:13.160]  and to be clear you're a surgeon and a expert who researches you know the gut
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:17.720]  of the stomach the intestines i mean that's your specialty uh and you know
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:21.800]  you did these studies and uh now they're claiming that you've engaged in
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:25.160]  fraud but then when you read the articles they never show any evidence of
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:28.840]  fraud they just say you're a fraud yeah and then it's
[02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:32.760]  interesting that the claim of fraud has come from a freelance journalist who
[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:36.280]  has absolutely no training whatsoever in science
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:40.520]  format and he has gone into the media and made up
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:43.880]  the most extravagant supports that when
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:48.280]  even the most mundane analysis failed to substantiate
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:54.040]  and it's very very sad that in pursuing their case against me the
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:59.320]  government's PR campaign in the UK is brought into this notion
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:02.840]  well doctor we're going to come back and talk about how they lied about you and
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:05.800]  and i don't think you have to get your good name back the mainstream media is
[02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:09.720]  so discredited now worldwide that the fact that they're attacking you
[02:29:09.720 --> 02:29:13.800]  is is is is only heaping credit to your name
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:18.120]  and that and that your research is is is verified by other research
[02:29:18.120 --> 02:29:21.800]  but i'm going to bring up the 64 million dollar question when we come back
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:27.000]  uh which is the question you posed why do they know this is happening and are
[02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:30.200]  they intensifying it and we'll get your answer
[02:29:30.200 --> 02:29:33.080]  uh to that doctor andrew wakefield is our guest
[02:29:33.080 --> 02:29:38.200]  i'm going to open the phones up specifically for families
[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:42.360]  who have children with autism and their experience 800

[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:04.200]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:07.320]  hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[02:31:07.320 --> 02:31:10.680]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:13.880]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[02:31:13.880 --> 02:31:17.160]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[02:31:17.160 --> 02:31:20.040]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:23.160]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:26.680]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:11.320]  by the way i forgot to add this book is so important we only cover the most
[02:33:11.320 --> 02:33:14.760]  informative information it's available on the online video bookstore
[02:33:14.760 --> 02:33:19.240]  at info wars.com callous disregard autism and vaccines
[02:33:19.240 --> 02:33:22.520]  the truth behind a tragedy andrew j wakefield
[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:27.080]  if your grandchildren are about to get married or having children
[02:33:27.080 --> 02:33:31.560]  give them this book and while you're at it send them a few links to pig virus
[02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:35.160]  contaminates vaccines but fda says no problem
[02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:38.040]  or send them mainstream government documents where they admit hundreds of
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:41.000]  millions of people were given the sv-40 cancer virus
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.840]  in the polio shot and they admit tens of millions then died
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:49.800]  from that and look i'll come right out and say it i've i've made the film in
[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:53.720]  game blueprint for global enslavement i have the white house science r's own
[02:33:53.720 --> 02:33:56.200]  textbook they're doing this on purpose these are
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:34:00.440]  eugenicists this is population reduction they're testing soft kills
[02:34:00.440 --> 02:34:03.480]  why would they come out and say it's okay for the
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:07.720]  garter still shot to kill young women why would they come out and say it's
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:12.760]  okay if tens of millions died of cancer from the sv-40 shot
[02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:15.720]  why would they they're setting the precedent to do this out in the open
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:19.400]  now andrew wakefield medical doctor he won't go that far
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:22.680]  he did the studies separate studies have been done shown the same thing
[02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:27.000]  i've had medical doctors on about the same thing with crones disease
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:31.000]  luckily it doesn't have the early onset and fry the brain
[02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:34.760]  uh... you know to put it in layman's terms as a doctor
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:38.280]  well as many doctors have said here on the radio show
[02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:41.800]  uh... but uh...
[02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:45.480]  you know i got one person in my office has crones
[02:34:45.480 --> 02:34:49.880]  it's almost killed him and it's mainline medical research that they're
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:53.880]  looking at that being vaccine cause so callous disregard autism
[02:34:53.880 --> 02:34:57.560]  and vaccines the truth behind the tragedy dr wakefield look they know
[02:34:57.560 --> 02:35:00.280]  it's doing this you said you were just in the trial over in england the
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.560]  hearings and got even more documents they've known this is going on what in
[02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:08.360]  2000 uh... abc news got the documents from 2000
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:11.560]  and it came out in 2002 i'm sure you're familiar with this
[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:14.840]  where it was the head uh... of the uh...
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:17.960]  food and drug administration saying i wouldn't give this to my grandkids
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:21.960]  we've got to cover up what this is done my god we've damaged millions
[02:35:21.960 --> 02:35:25.160]  and then they lied and said they'd taken mercury out and then of course that's
[02:35:25.160 --> 02:35:28.680]  separate uh... most of the doctors we talked to like
[02:35:28.680 --> 02:35:32.040]  russell blalock they say the mercury is toxic
[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:36.920]  but is really a side issue they say it is the adjuvant effect of causing an
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:41.000]  autoimmune response that causes the miscarriages that causes the
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:44.840]  autoimmune response in the intestines the autoimmune response the brain
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:49.480]  swelling uh... a lot of children have a convulsion in the car or at home
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:52.760]  after the shots then cops come and arrest them because there's blood on the
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:55.560]  brain they say they've shaken the babies you know that's a whole
[02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:59.560]  another facet to this doctor isn't it how they also persecute people
[02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:03.480]  when the soft kill weapon m m r really hit some hard
[02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:06.600]  then they say oh you must have beat your kid
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:09.720]  yeah well i mean you're absolutely right there is uh... there were cases in england
[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:14.680]  where there were a shaken baby syndrome child died they had hemorrhages
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:18.440]  the pathologist thought the sale of this is something that could be consistent
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:22.760]  with um... the the dtp vaccine that he's just had they weren't allowed to talk
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:26.040]  about it they were actually forbidden to talk about it in
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:29.240]  the courtroom they couldn't address the vaccine issue now
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:33.320]  if you can't bring the evidence into court what kind of justice is that
[02:36:33.320 --> 02:36:37.480]  and the parents have found guilty of having but that's even better
[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:41.080]  they get to brain damage the kid and then throw the parents in prison this is a
[02:36:41.080 --> 02:36:44.360]  wonderful system for a predatory government go ahead
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:48.200]  yeah now i don't you know at the moment i'm a scientist and a doctor i don't
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:52.280]  know whether you know to what extent uh... this is just incompetent
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:56.680]  for conspiracy but i do know there's a lot of damage out there that is going
[02:36:56.680 --> 02:36:59.800]  that is being brushed under the carpet and it's
[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:03.240]  unacceptable kids in this country have never been
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:09.000]  um... had so many chronic uh... immune diseases asthma, eczema, hay fever
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.240]  uh... the Crohn's disease autism what is going on
[02:37:13.240 --> 02:37:17.000]  it's a key question but one study they will not do
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:21.560]  is a comparison of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children
[02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:25.320]  long-term health outcomes of that but reason they won't do that
[02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:28.440]  is of a real concern to me because i think they suspect
[02:37:28.440 --> 02:37:32.360]  that it will show that the kids who've been vaccinated are worse off
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:36.200]  now it may not but do the study that people deserve it
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:40.600]  parents have every right to expect that study not only should have been done in
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:44.440]  the past but if not must be done now is a matter of urgency
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:49.000]  they don't want to do it well doctor uh... look
[02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:52.680]  we've had decades of this info coming out they know what it's doing
[02:37:52.680 --> 02:37:55.960]  and so we could say in the past maybe it was just
[02:37:55.960 --> 02:38:00.680]  uh... incompetence but now the system clearly knows
[02:38:00.680 --> 02:38:03.960]  that vaccines are causing all sorts of problems i mean take
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:06.840]  take Gardasil in the trials it caused death
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:10.520]  but still they came out and aggressively pushed it
[02:38:10.520 --> 02:38:14.520]  uh... can you speak to that and then also uh... the admission
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:18.120]  that these vaccines are now contaminated with pig viruses and you
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:21.800]  have written on that subject yeah tell you break it down at two things i went
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:26.120]  into a meeting recently Alex would uh... one of the speakers was one of the
[02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:29.560]  senior scientists involved in the production of the Gardasil vaccine
[02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:33.800]  she was extremely concerned about the way it's been used
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:37.320]  the rapidity with which it had been introduced in America
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:41.400]  she said it was intended for women in third world countries or girls in third
[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:45.480]  world countries who didn't have access to cervical smear screening
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:49.480]  but there was no evidence that it worked and that it was associated with
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:52.680]  problems the reason for introducing it seems to be
[02:38:52.680 --> 02:38:57.800]  entirely a commercial one and having spoken to someone who worked
[02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:01.640]  at Merck and Insider there were problems
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:05.400]  in the trial as you've alluded to from very early on
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:09.240]  so uh and i've done i've read the other day it's just been withdrawn or
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:13.800]  suspended in India where girls died after administration so
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:18.600]  there's a problem and please the government cannot just ignore
[02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:24.520]  this um the recent debacle over the pig viruses in a
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:28.680]  a rotavirus vaccine again this is a vaccine in England no one uses rotavirus
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:31.880]  vaccine why is it necessary in the US so
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:36.280]  we have a vaccine and then after they say it's been extensively tested for safety
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:38.840]  years later it's been given to millions of children
[02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:42.920]  then they find that it's contaminated with pig viruses so when they find that
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:47.640]  the Glaxo vaccine is contaminated with the what's meant to be a non-injurious
[02:39:47.640 --> 02:39:50.600]  vaccine they withdraw it they suspend it from the market
[02:39:50.600 --> 02:39:55.240]  then they find a couple of months later that the Merck vaccine is contaminated
[02:39:55.240 --> 02:39:59.400]  not what just would be pig virus type one virus but the type two
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:02.680]  virus which is known to be um a pathogen
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:06.280]  dangerous in pigs and they put them both back on the box
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:09.800]  about how can they possibly say as they did
[02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:13.560]  that the benefits outweigh the risks they have no idea
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:17.400]  what the risks are whatsoever that is a totally dishonest statement
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:21.560]  it is a lie and it is a misrepresentation to the consumer and the
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:25.240]  American people well the way dr. Blalock discusses it is
[02:40:25.240 --> 02:40:30.200]  that when you inject a bunch of RNA mixed with adjuvants that jack up the
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:33.240]  immune system on top of it that the stomach and the
[02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:37.080]  intestines is is is really the front line
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:43.160]  of our auto immune system and that it just causes all sorts of bizarre
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:46.840]  interactions and this has been known for over a hundred years
[02:40:46.840 --> 02:40:49.960]  and that they're fully aware of what they're doing i mean
[02:40:49.960 --> 02:40:54.520]  dr. Blalock comes right on on the show and he of course reads the documents
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:58.520]  and says this is a population reduction program but i
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:01.320]  i don't expect you to go that far i know you've already been demonized
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:05.880]  for simply doing the basic research let's briefly though
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:09.320]  talk about their false charges against you and then what's actually in the
[02:41:09.320 --> 02:41:12.760]  book uh callous disregard and how important it is
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:16.680]  uh you know for people to support you because i've done separate research
[02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:20.760]  and i know that you've actually been tamed what you've said and it's because
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:23.720]  you are so measured and well researched and
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:27.240]  effective that they're so scared of you but i mean let's talk about uh again
[02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:30.040]  countering their attempted demonization of you doctor
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:33.640]  right the principal charge against the doctors was that we conducted
[02:41:33.640 --> 02:41:37.160]  unethical research without the appropriate approvals
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:41.960]  on children we exploited children for the purpose of experimentation
[02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:47.880]  what we actually did was listen to and respond to parents who were concerned
[02:41:47.880 --> 02:41:51.800]  about sickness in their very very very ill children
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.080]  who had been historically ignored by the medical system
[02:41:55.080 --> 02:41:58.360]  we put together a multi-disciplinary team to
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:02.760]  to assess these children to investigate them and diagnose them clinically
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:07.560]  and what they have done in england is to misconstrue that as experimentation
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:10.600]  it was not and the contemporaneous documentation
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.760]  absolutely confirms that these children were being investigated
[02:42:14.760 --> 02:42:18.440]  for clinical reasons you do not need
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:22.920]  an approval from an ethical committee for clinical investigations
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:26.040]  well my dad's a dentist and and you know he's got
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:30.840]  uh patents and things uh on just treatments for say dry socket
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:34.840]  uh and that's how it works is is is you say to a patient
[02:42:34.840 --> 02:42:37.880]  do you want to be part of a study we're going to pay you this money
[02:42:37.880 --> 02:42:41.560]  and then you do it right let me be absolutely clear that
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:45.960]  alex no patient was ever paid by anyone for being in the study no i know but
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:49.400]  that's not even unethical everybody knows that the big
[02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:53.480]  pharma companies and everybody pays but they're saying on the news they're
[02:42:53.480 --> 02:42:57.560]  trying to claim you paid them so it's unethical to be able to do a test on
[02:42:57.560 --> 02:42:59.640]  them and they're and they're acting like you were doctor
[02:42:59.640 --> 02:43:03.400]  mingala or something when you did extremely ethical studies
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:07.880]  to i mean my point is knowing how medical trials work
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:11.800]  you did nothing wrong and they're misconstruing what you did
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:15.960]  yes it seems to me that deliberately misunderstanding the evidence that is
[02:43:15.960 --> 02:43:19.640]  in front of them and it was an extraordinary uh decision to have come
[02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.720]  to we were all i have to say frankly amazed that they could reach that
[02:43:23.720 --> 02:43:26.280]  decision they either completely misunderstood it
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:29.880]  or they had come to a predetermined decision based upon
[02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:35.800]  government pressure and media misreported well they're desperate i mean
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:39.560]  would you agree that there is a mass awakening to the dangers of vaccines
[02:43:39.560 --> 02:43:42.280]  going on right now yeah i think this is something they find
[02:43:42.280 --> 02:43:46.040]  particularly difficult to cope with but despite everything they've done to me
[02:43:46.040 --> 02:43:50.680]  despite all the public relations that have been attacking me and the parents
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:54.280]  and other doctors it was a study recently that showed that one in
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:57.480]  four parents in this country thinks vaccines cause autism in other words
[02:43:57.480 --> 02:44:01.560]  their public relations campaign has failed because that is without any
[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:04.440]  counter public relations campaign from our side
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:06.840]  i haven't been in the media before because i haven't been able to be in the
[02:44:06.840 --> 02:44:09.400]  media i haven't been able to get these facts out there
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:13.480]  and 53 percent of people in that study 53 percent of parents
[02:44:13.480 --> 02:44:16.760]  think that vaccines are associated with serious side effects so
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:20.280]  they have got a problem and the problem is one of their own making
[02:44:20.280 --> 02:44:27.240]  well dr wakefield during the h1n1 uh situation uh all i ask
[02:44:27.240 --> 02:44:30.680]  people to do is to read the vaccine insert it said
[02:44:30.680 --> 02:44:39.640]  may cause neurological disorder um it said may reduce fertility it said
[02:44:39.640 --> 02:44:46.600]  may be linked to cancer so i mean uh i mean everybody knows vaccines have
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:52.440]  quote adverse reactions yeah i think that's why it was it was
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:55.800]  really needs to be brought out of the open here we were persuaded through a
[02:44:55.800 --> 02:44:59.400]  mass public relations campaign of fear and intimidation that there was going to
[02:44:59.400 --> 02:45:02.520]  be the worst epidemic of the nastiest for the
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:06.040]  ever and we had to get this vaccine to turn out to be one of the mildest
[02:45:06.040 --> 02:45:09.640]  influenza viruses on record the vaccine seems to have caused
[02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:13.160]  far more problems than they're prepared to do and um
[02:45:13.160 --> 02:45:16.920]  that needs thorough thorough investigation and government oversight
[02:45:16.920 --> 02:45:21.000]  to determine what went wrong there and why it went wrong
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.800]  by the way uh your your book is now published just for a week or so and
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:30.360]  it's what 23 on the amazon chart shooting up charts everywhere else
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:36.040]  give folks the best website is it callous dash disregard dot com is that the
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:39.960]  best site for folks to visit doctor well here's the thing i think people go on

[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:06.280]  dot com and anything uh that we raise in a
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:11.000]  proportion of that will go to autism research absolutely i want to take some
[02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:14.280]  phone calls but but but promise now because you live in austin that the
[02:46:14.280 --> 02:46:17.080]  next month or two you'll come and be in studio with us
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:20.360]  i i i you've got to keep me away i'd love to come and see
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:23.800]  absolutely we can't wait to have you here with us we don't have a lot of time
[02:46:23.800 --> 02:46:27.320]  left this segment the next and i want to go to a few calls here for you dr
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:30.200]  wakefield but again we appreciate your courage
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:33.160]  we appreciate you standing up and speaking out
[02:46:33.160 --> 02:46:37.640]  uh through the ridiculous demonization but but to be specific then
[02:46:37.640 --> 02:46:41.400]  uh you literally did studies in your own office
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:44.280]  and didn't even pay people to be part of the study because i've heard them on the
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:48.520]  news saying you did as if that was bad uh so just set the record straight you
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:51.640]  did nothing wrong except try to save people
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:58.360]  we pursued our professional model ut and we stand by everything we did yet
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:01.960]  and as you said other studies are showing similar responses so
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:04.280]  well that's the thing about the mainstream news articles they never
[02:47:04.280 --> 02:47:09.160]  really say what you did they just say you're bad somehow and unethical
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:13.240]  uh and i guess it's another political
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:16.920]  move uh just like the british government exonerating
[02:47:16.920 --> 02:47:21.320]  tony blair lying about wmds i guess i guess they're just losing all
[02:47:21.320 --> 02:47:24.200]  credibility i'm afraid so i think that this is an
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:28.120]  extravagant public relations campaign it's actually a smoke screen to cover
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:30.520]  up the fact that the there is a problem
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:33.480]  that they are unable to deal with therefore it's easier to go after me than
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:37.080]  it is after solving the problem
[02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:41.480]  but what are they going to do is more parents go take the polio shot and their
[02:47:41.480 --> 02:47:44.680]  kid dies a polio which is in cbs news or they get a
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:48.280]  garter cell shot and their daughter convulses and has paralyzed the neck down
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:51.960]  of the rest of her life or the or the 18 month olds giggling laughing
[02:47:51.960 --> 02:47:54.680]  somebody's listening right now they're not going to listen they don't believe
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:57.480]  us uh the child has the shots they have a
[02:47:57.480 --> 02:48:00.120]  convulsion the police take the parents to jail
[02:48:00.120 --> 02:48:03.640]  i mean you know the reason they're going to lose
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:07.880]  this pr operation is because as their carnage continues
[02:48:07.880 --> 02:48:11.560]  people are going to wake up and remember that we warned them
[02:48:11.560 --> 02:48:15.080]  yes people are most definitely waking up to the fact because
[02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:20.200]  um respectable mainstream professional entirely intelligent people are
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:25.240]  are now realizing themselves that this is affecting their families you know if
[02:48:25.240 --> 02:48:28.680]  autism doesn't affect you now and it's certainly within the future because the
[02:48:28.680 --> 02:48:32.760]  numbers are going up so quickly so people are coming to the realization in
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:37.160]  the saddest most tragic possible way and that is a personal experience of the
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:41.960]  problem and um it's just too big now to brush under the carpet
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:45.560]  what do you want to say to those out there that have persecuted you and lied
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:48.120]  about you because no doubt doctor they're going to end up seeing and
[02:48:48.120 --> 02:48:51.560]  hearing this interview what would you like to say to them
[02:48:51.560 --> 02:48:55.080]  well you know it's a futile effort because i'm not going away the parents
[02:48:55.080 --> 02:48:57.960]  aren't going away the children aren't going away the work will be done
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:01.720]  truth will come out so you're not going to change the
[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:05.480]  history of this one bit we will get to the bottom of it um
[02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:09.000]  whether it exonerates the vaccines or whether it implicates them
[02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.840]  my job as a scientist is to pursue this to its natural conclusion so
[02:49:12.840 --> 02:49:17.480]  that is what i intend to do um we're going to bring come back and take a few
[02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:22.200]  calls for the doctor but before we do that
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:25.560]  jenny mccarthy i've heard vicious talk show host
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:29.240]  nationally on tv and radio claim that she's just
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:33.160]  wanting publicity no she has a child
[02:49:33.160 --> 02:49:37.240]  who was damaged that she lives with every day
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:41.400]  and to just show how callous they are to attack a mother
[02:49:41.400 --> 02:49:46.520]  who has a sick child clearly from the vaccines and to claim
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:52.360]  that she's doing this for her own publicity these people are just heartless
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:55.880]  i mean you know have they spent time with the children
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:00.680]  that have been wrecked by this yeah because they're unable to deal with the
[02:50:00.680 --> 02:50:03.320]  backs of the matter and they go after the person
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:08.120]  and they have no compunction about how they go after the people they're
[02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:12.440]  ruthless and they are solely interested in protecting their own territory and
[02:50:12.440 --> 02:50:16.440]  that is a great great change well you're going to be speaking
[02:50:16.440 --> 02:50:19.720]  tomorrow uh at an important event and we'll cover that
[02:50:19.720 --> 02:50:23.320]  uh when we come back on the other side uh we'll tell folks how to be there but
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:27.720]  bottom line uh when you talk to jenny mccarthy what is her
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:30.760]  a resolve like under the attack she's been under
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:34.760]  oh i think she's absolutely determined you know for mothers like jenny a small
[02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:37.640]  part of them a big part of the fact has been damaged and
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:40.840]  destroyed and you know mothers will never quit they
[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:43.480]  will never ever ever give up and they are

[03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:03.960]  well i got the first-hand information experience about that i have a
[03:01:03.960 --> 03:01:08.280]  13-year-old boy that was diagnosed autistic from memory university in

[03:01:21.880 --> 03:01:25.640]  some developmental delays when he was 12 months old it took us that long to just
[03:01:25.640 --> 03:01:31.560]  get an appointment and get doctors to actually give us permission to get an
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:35.400]  appointment now what's your boy needs is more shots

[03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:13.240]  screen for president planet dot tv viewers uh u.s postal service expands
[03:09:13.240 --> 03:09:18.280]  construction of secret rooms now steve quill called me this morning
[03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:22.920]  and he talked about how al cupid had given him the info uh on the secret
[03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:28.200]  interrogation rooms being expanded i called paul watson he did deep uh
[03:09:28.200 --> 03:09:33.480]  searches uh on google but also on other search databases and found
[03:09:33.480 --> 03:09:36.680]  united states postal service interrogation rooms
[03:09:36.680 --> 03:09:39.880]  but we have the internal blueprints where they're expanding these
[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:44.840]  with these big uh you know one-way windows uh and and and watson did find
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:49.160]  what my memory had had pulled up that during the model states health
[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:52.280]  emergency powers act number 2002 they wanted to have forced
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:56.120]  inoculation nationwide for smallpox and they and it came out in news
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:09:59.880]  articles that oh yeah the feds are going to use
[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:04.120]  sports stadiums and postal offices as the centers
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:08.280]  where if you refuse to be inoculated uh you'll be taken and be held but will
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:12.200]  also forcibly inoculate if we're given the orders at these
[03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:15.800]  injection facilities and and at these and and then
[03:10:15.800 --> 03:10:18.920]  it it turned out police and sheriff's deputies were the ones that were leaking
[03:10:18.920 --> 03:10:21.720]  the info so we know this is real so that's
[03:10:21.720 --> 03:10:25.800]  when steve called me i went yeah no this ties into all the info i have and
[03:10:25.800 --> 03:10:28.600]  he said listen this isn't just al cupid who's a good source
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:32.760]  worked with the joint chiefs of staff uh that gave me this info he said i
[03:10:32.760 --> 03:10:37.560]  i was already told this last week by one of my sources in montana
[03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:41.000]  who was in one of these facilities and they're expanding it now
[03:10:41.000 --> 03:10:45.720]  you tie that in with all the military reports of them doing gun confiscation
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:49.480]  drills and military checkpoints in the news
[03:10:49.480 --> 03:10:53.320]  they'll have these pr pieces these acclimation pieces like oh the marines
[03:10:53.320 --> 03:10:56.840]  were out running checkpoints looking for drunk drivers in california or
[03:10:56.840 --> 03:11:00.440]  tennessee oh the regular army was out in kentucky
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:05.160]  oh uh the local police are training uh for martial law
[03:11:05.160 --> 03:11:09.080]  the point is they're getting ready to implode the economy
[03:11:09.080 --> 03:11:12.920]  they've built this over the last few decades they have the legislation
[03:11:12.920 --> 03:11:16.200]  introduced they have the ten regional fema governors
[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:19.960]  under federal control with the national governors act
[03:11:19.960 --> 03:11:23.640]  all this is in place and now steve has gotten
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:27.000]  and by the way we called the numbers and and and called the addresses
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:30.120]  you know pulled up the numbers on the addresses we're going to go through that
[03:11:30.120 --> 03:11:35.320]  pdf file for prison planet dot tv viewers if you go to the article and
[03:11:35.320 --> 03:11:41.080]  link through we have a pdf document there in the second paragraph
[03:11:41.080 --> 03:11:43.880]  and we'll scroll down so they can see it so they can actually see the
[03:11:43.880 --> 03:11:48.360]  diagrams in that pdf uh yeah there you have it
[03:11:48.360 --> 03:11:52.040]  uh where you can see the different blueprints for these huge
[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:55.000]  interrogation rooms and what's a big concern is
[03:11:55.000 --> 03:11:59.240]  multiple sources say they've got the cover claiming this is for postal
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:02.840]  inspector criminal investigations though no one's ever heard of it
[03:12:02.840 --> 03:12:07.000]  that's the cover for building it we know even in mainstream articles these are
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:11.240]  for forced inoculations and federal police interrogation so i want to go
[03:12:11.240 --> 03:12:14.920]  to steve quail uh who is hot on the trail of this
[03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:18.200]  steve good to have you back with us thanks alex the interesting thing about
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:21.640]  the story that is breaking today with you and i
[03:12:21.640 --> 03:12:25.480]  and others especially many things dal cupid is uh last week
[03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:30.040]  i ran into a gentleman that obviously knows who i am and he started opening up
[03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:33.800]  about the work he's been doing on different belly post offices but
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:37.480]  the department of homeland security facilities and federal buildings for
[03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:41.640]  you're going to love this uh literally silent rooms
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:45.800]  called the interrogation rooms and this guy knows what's going on and he's a
[03:12:45.800 --> 03:12:49.960]  security specialist they said steve what these guys are building are nothing
[03:12:49.960 --> 03:12:54.680]  more than absolutely uh and he said in in his words they
[03:12:54.680 --> 03:12:58.760]  are rendition centers now we know what rendition means torture
[03:12:58.760 --> 03:13:03.240]  and we also know the fact that based on what multiple witnesses throughout the
[03:13:03.240 --> 03:13:06.200]  country are saying is everything is being geared up
[03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:11.800]  and the level of knowledge secrecy but of uh coordinating off these areas alex
[03:13:11.800 --> 03:13:15.160]  with more guards and everything is indicative of something that's getting
[03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:17.800]  really yeah now they're now they're staffing it that's
[03:13:17.800 --> 03:13:21.320]  the big concern remember right bush started the secret arrest the snatch
[03:13:21.320 --> 03:13:25.480]  and grab the torture now lieberman and mccain are on the news trying to pass
[03:13:25.480 --> 03:13:29.640]  laws the belligerent act where the pentagon can direct citizens are
[03:13:29.640 --> 03:13:33.880]  secretly arrested secretly stripped of their rights and can be given quote
[03:13:33.880 --> 03:13:38.440]  enhanced interrogation and then it turns out obama overseas
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:42.760]  has been using new black sites at horse ranches and foreign
[03:13:42.760 --> 03:13:46.600]  post office facilities so they love the nondescript building
[03:13:46.600 --> 03:13:49.720]  they bring you in in the back of a postal truck and take you into the
[03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:54.360]  torture facility absolutely now i want to read a quick update from a friend of
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:57.400]  mine i'm gonna just i'm not going to disclose the city you know what it is
[03:13:57.400 --> 03:14:00.520]  but just for his friend's sake steve my best friend works in a
[03:14:00.520 --> 03:14:03.960]  major midwest area post office distribution facility
[03:14:03.960 --> 03:14:07.800]  on the north side he has spoken of this mysterious room that was describing
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:10.520]  your expose he said it's closely guarded by the
[03:14:10.520 --> 03:14:14.200]  postal police and only a few management members are granted access
[03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:17.960]  it's located on the second floor of the facility and the only access is by a
[03:14:17.960 --> 03:14:20.760]  catwalk i always wondered what it was about
[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:24.440]  waiting till i tell him what it is all about he won't be too surprised because
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:28.840]  he suspected something bad was happening in there so alex this is a real
[03:14:28.840 --> 03:14:31.960]  time today update from a major midwest city
[03:14:31.960 --> 03:14:36.120]  and the bottom line is is that people who even work in the post office the
[03:14:36.120 --> 03:14:39.080]  average postal letter carrier is not going to know
[03:14:39.080 --> 03:14:43.000]  necessarily what this is for but the idea of when the under the emergency
[03:14:43.000 --> 03:14:46.840]  health powers act remember we were going to have to go to the post office
[03:14:46.840 --> 03:14:51.000]  register yeah that was in that was in the denver post i mean it and paul
[03:14:51.000 --> 03:14:53.480]  watson has links they were going to use it
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:58.600]  as the forced inoculation interrogation centers to see if you're an extremist
[03:14:58.600 --> 03:15:03.240]  now they admit everybody's being put on list uh to control this so this fits
[03:15:03.240 --> 03:15:06.520]  into everything we already know but also we know the feds
[03:15:06.520 --> 03:15:09.640]  admit they're growing the opium shipping in the cocaine
[03:15:09.640 --> 03:15:14.920]  they can also use these secret facilities in all the big post offices as a
[03:15:14.920 --> 03:15:17.880]  place to ship in their drugs and then break it up
[03:15:17.880 --> 03:15:21.480]  and then move it out so it'll also be used just like when the cia
[03:15:21.480 --> 03:15:25.080]  rendition plane crashed three years ago with three and a half tons of pure
[03:15:25.080 --> 03:15:28.280]  cocaine it turned out that was also a torture plane
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:31.400]  so they use these for dual use i would imagine there's also going to be
[03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:35.000]  narcotics being brought through these well absolutely and you know one of
[03:15:35.000 --> 03:15:39.080]  the stories you're carrying today uh you know on prison plan is former cia
[03:15:39.080 --> 03:15:43.320]  officials admit to faking bin laden video i think people better realize alex
[03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:47.160]  where they have been dumb and dumbed down they better allow
[03:15:47.160 --> 03:15:52.280]  this reality-based information to shake them up and wake them up because the
[03:15:52.280 --> 03:15:55.160]  bottom line is is that ladies and gentlemen
[03:15:55.160 --> 03:15:58.360]  you are if you're listening to this program or listening
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:02.840]  to me or anybody uh that that's out there screaming at the top of their lungs
[03:16:02.840 --> 03:16:06.040]  you've already probably been categorized as a terrorist and you know alex
[03:16:06.040 --> 03:16:09.720]  when people didn't speak out against torture and i went wild over that so
[03:16:09.720 --> 03:16:13.720]  did you i said listen they will not care until it's a
[03:16:13.720 --> 03:16:17.880]  their child their wife their husband in those chambers and
[03:16:17.880 --> 03:16:21.720]  god forbid i hope that through the ex exposing of this
[03:16:21.720 --> 03:16:25.720]  people start figuring it out and listen the only way the loose variants can
[03:16:25.720 --> 03:16:32.040]  live is under the cloak of darkness secrecy and control so you know my
[03:16:32.040 --> 03:16:35.640]  hat again is off to you for putting the light on the
[03:16:35.640 --> 03:16:38.920]  subject matter that you're dealing with because they will see upon us now
[03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:41.960]  well well it is i want to shift gears just for a moment
[03:16:41.960 --> 03:16:45.800]  you remember uh you were the one that broke the news
[03:16:45.800 --> 03:16:49.640]  that a group of private mercenaries run by a felon
[03:16:49.640 --> 03:16:54.760]  had taken over uh areas of hard montana in the 27 million dollar facility i
[03:16:54.760 --> 03:16:59.480]  went there it was true and even more now i was sent a
[03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:02.840]  photograph yesterday and i wasn't going to cover this
[03:17:02.840 --> 03:17:06.120]  this hour but towards the end i'm going to go ahead and start
[03:17:06.120 --> 03:17:11.080]  because i'm still doing research it says i saw this car on i-45 north
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:14.600]  toward downtown houston today at about 9 a.m never saw one of these before he
[03:17:14.600 --> 03:17:18.920]  was driving like a bat out of hell it says state tactical on it
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:21.640]  and guess what it has the serbian coat of arms
[03:17:21.640 --> 03:17:26.040]  it has a similar name to one that uh hilton has used
[03:17:26.040 --> 03:17:29.080]  and it's tied into israeli defense companies
[03:17:29.080 --> 03:17:33.720]  and it has the same website design and same look but we've confirmed they do
[03:17:33.720 --> 03:17:38.440]  have these fake police cars now driving around in houston
[03:17:38.440 --> 03:17:42.360]  and where we've almost confirmed it's connected to helton we're not
[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:46.200]  a hundred percent sure but it's the same mo the same names
[03:17:46.200 --> 03:17:50.040]  i mean this is and the fact that the feds haven't done anything about hilton
[03:17:50.040 --> 03:17:56.120]  to begin with uh this is just insane well i think too that people need to
[03:17:56.120 --> 03:17:59.080]  understand something the information that i gave about
[03:17:59.080 --> 03:18:02.600]  department homeland security and others they've got to i think
[03:18:02.600 --> 03:18:05.800]  every listener has got to recognize that if they don't
[03:18:05.800 --> 03:18:10.520]  see a policeman or a sheriff or a highway trauma state trooper
[03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:13.560]  these guys now under law alex can put on any
[03:18:13.560 --> 03:18:17.160]  yeah if they're under the departmental and security they can wear any one of a
[03:18:17.160 --> 03:18:20.760]  dozen different uniforms they're putting them into
[03:18:20.760 --> 03:18:25.160]  either they're hiding them in plain sight and again if if all of the events
[03:18:25.160 --> 03:18:29.160]  that are taking place concurrently don't send the biggest
[03:18:29.160 --> 03:18:32.680]  warning that's ever been sounded on talk radio by your program
[03:18:32.680 --> 03:18:38.040]  the bottom line is is that there is no more event that can take place except
[03:18:38.040 --> 03:18:40.840]  when they drop the hammer and ladies and gentlemen that's why all this
[03:18:40.840 --> 03:18:44.040]  information is out there every single politician
[03:18:44.040 --> 03:18:48.840]  who has voted for this stuff needs to be recalled and recall petitions immediately
[03:18:48.840 --> 03:18:52.600]  well let's talk about how they could roll out martial law notice
[03:18:52.600 --> 03:18:56.040]  they're talking about nuclear war with north korea they're talking about first
[03:18:56.040 --> 03:18:59.800]  strikes on iran right as the global banking meltdown happens
[03:18:59.800 --> 03:19:02.440]  we'll talk about that in the second half of the interview steve quill
[03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:05.960]  but but because i was interrupting some we come back from break
[03:19:05.960 --> 03:19:09.400]  walk through what your different sources are telling you and that's the same
[03:19:09.400 --> 03:19:12.680]  info i'm getting uh you this morning you weren't
[03:19:12.680 --> 03:19:15.160]  sure you were saying do you know anything about these
[03:19:15.160 --> 03:19:18.840]  blueprints we went and looked it up found out indeed it's public
[03:19:18.840 --> 03:19:22.200]  that they're building these prison facilities
[03:19:22.200 --> 03:19:28.360]  uh inside of the postal service uh paul watson has links to that in his
[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:32.120]  article us postal service expands construction of secret rooms
[03:19:32.120 --> 03:19:37.720]  this just went up on prisonplanet.com uh so so we've confirmed this is going on
[03:19:37.720 --> 03:19:41.400]  but the issue is it's the other things that the people are telling you
[03:19:41.400 --> 03:19:44.360]  who are involved in this that they're now being staffed
[03:19:44.360 --> 03:19:48.040]  they're now being expanded they're now building bigger ones
[03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:51.400]  they can wear any patch they want of any agency
[03:19:51.400 --> 03:19:54.680]  uh and how and how they admitted seven years ago
[03:19:54.680 --> 03:19:58.840]  this is part of the forced inoculation program that is confirmed steve quill's
[03:19:58.840 --> 03:20:03.240]  our guest key info straight ahead you may be arrested

[03:22:15.800 --> 03:22:19.480]  that social security would be there for you that's not what's happening you
[03:22:19.480 --> 03:22:22.760]  might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't
[03:22:22.760 --> 03:22:26.200]  fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your

[03:23:21.960 --> 03:23:25.480]  can you buy it without proper identification will there be any food
[03:23:25.480 --> 03:23:29.000]  will it make your children sick if there's a quarantine and you can't feed
[03:23:29.000 --> 03:23:32.280]  yourself will you go to the gathering center and be immunized

[03:23:43.800 --> 03:23:47.960]  i'm alex jones i want all of you good guys to live to fight another day
[03:23:47.960 --> 03:23:55.480]  call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com
[03:23:55.480 --> 03:24:07.480]  again that number 1-800-409-5633 don't worry this show is documented
[03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:14.600]  alex jones on the gcn radio network i fell into a burning ring of fire
[03:24:14.600 --> 03:24:21.480]  i went down down down and the flames went higher and it burns burns burns
[03:24:21.480 --> 03:24:25.800]  we're back live ladies and gentlemen steve quills our guest okay steve
[03:24:25.800 --> 03:24:29.960]  lay it all out why this is such a concern because he
[03:24:29.960 --> 03:24:33.720]  it's not like they're just building secret jails which we went and tracked down
[03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:37.720]  in the found the government purchase orders that's creepy enough
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:42.600]  we know from past mainstream reports they want to use post offices during
[03:24:42.600 --> 03:24:46.520]  collapse of society and for forced inoculation
[03:24:46.520 --> 03:24:50.280]  and uh go ahead well also i think the thing that everyone needs to watch is
[03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:56.440]  all of the new revelations on the id the the new push for national id the new
[03:24:56.440 --> 03:25:01.000]  biometrics scanning the new dna scanning the new sampling against your will
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:04.520]  i mean the point is alex the post office is going to become the place where
[03:25:04.520 --> 03:25:10.200]  once they generate the false flag in conjunction with i believe iran in
[03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:14.360]  conjunction with north korea i think people need to understand this that
[03:25:14.360 --> 03:25:18.520]  the mainstream press absolutely does not give news
[03:25:18.520 --> 03:25:22.600]  they don't give the truth and they only give what i would call diversionary
[03:25:22.600 --> 03:25:26.920]  entertainment let's put that in question marks so the point that it has to be
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:31.000]  made clearly is that the identification the billification the
[03:25:31.000 --> 03:25:34.680]  nullification and soon the destruction of anyone
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:38.440]  who is other than them is going to take place and look alex we've seen it the
[03:25:38.440 --> 03:25:42.840]  mayak report all the different uh documentation it doesn't even matter
[03:25:42.840 --> 03:25:45.640]  if we can prove historically that false flags are
[03:25:45.640 --> 03:25:49.560]  general operating procedure of the power that's in place at the time
[03:25:49.560 --> 03:25:53.640]  the korean incident starting with the thinking of the south korean ship by
[03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:58.040]  north korea followed up with the massive deployment of some of the
[03:25:58.040 --> 03:26:03.000]  state-of-the-art weaponry uh to not only guam but also okinawa the reversal of
[03:26:03.000 --> 03:26:05.400]  japanese government okinawa i can tell you this from
[03:26:05.400 --> 03:26:10.440]  someone i know in japan told me uh three days ago point blank is that steve
[03:26:10.440 --> 03:26:14.360]  i was in a position to hear some of the japanese military
[03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:17.480]  two of their highest leaders saying it's time to break out
[03:26:17.480 --> 03:26:20.840]  uh... the stuff that we hope we never have to use
[03:26:20.840 --> 03:26:24.920]  he said use your imagination as most people know alex
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:29.800]  japan is not thrilled with the idea of a nuclear war in korea and let's look
[03:26:29.800 --> 03:26:33.720]  now to the oil spill whether people believe it or not
[03:26:33.720 --> 03:26:37.560]  want to accept it or not all these things are happening almost in a
[03:26:37.560 --> 03:26:40.440]  concert concerted and a concentrated
[03:26:40.440 --> 03:26:44.520]  a point in time to generate the massive amount of chaos a new world order
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:48.680]  thrives on one word out of chaos must come the new world order
[03:26:48.680 --> 03:26:52.440]  and so now we've got uh every day we've got whether the president
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:56.280]  of this country uh making statements on a new
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:00.200]  global order we're seeing it all but remember and this is the thing i think
[03:27:00.200 --> 03:27:04.360]  that everyone loses track of you cannot bring on the new world order until
[03:27:04.360 --> 03:27:08.600]  you do away with the old world order so the false flag is a given i'm also
[03:27:08.600 --> 03:27:11.960]  told and i've been told this by people who live in your area
[03:27:11.960 --> 03:27:15.960]  and you know in austin you guys have a lot of retired and active duty
[03:27:15.960 --> 03:27:21.880]  you know special operations people that again the idea is that once it starts
[03:27:21.880 --> 03:27:25.880]  in uh the middle east and egypt's already running their tests
[03:27:25.880 --> 03:27:29.880]  war against israel syria everybody's getting ready for the big one
[03:27:29.880 --> 03:27:33.640]  and currently with that it's divide and conquer policy
[03:27:33.640 --> 03:27:37.400]  north korea can absolutely take out soul korea
[03:27:37.400 --> 03:27:41.240]  with their artillery i think in under two hours so that means we'll just
[03:27:41.240 --> 03:27:45.000]  burst and dispatch some of our most technologically advanced stuff that most
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:48.120]  people don't even want to acknowledge exist but we'll leave that for another
[03:27:48.120 --> 03:27:51.240]  time and even those guys that are in the command
[03:27:51.240 --> 03:27:55.240]  and control of all the armed services us all over the world
[03:27:55.240 --> 03:28:00.040]  they've been up at a level never before seen and what i'm talking about
[03:28:00.040 --> 03:28:03.640]  is that most people think that everything that goes out from orders
[03:28:03.640 --> 03:28:06.120]  emanate either from the pentagon or white house
[03:28:06.120 --> 03:28:10.920]  that's not true that there is white house approval codes etc
[03:28:10.920 --> 03:28:14.120]  but there are a very high-ranking military
[03:28:14.120 --> 03:28:17.720]  uh members with ranks that most people don't even know still exist
[03:28:17.720 --> 03:28:22.120]  that are are up uh martial law pop-up by the way is one of the guys named
[03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:27.000]  and the thing is is that we're seeing now a building almost to a crescendo and
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:30.200]  it's waiting for the shoot-a-fall but what we're waiting for the shoot-a-fall
[03:28:30.200 --> 03:28:33.480]  whether it's false flag or an international incident or nuclear war
[03:28:33.480 --> 03:28:37.080]  whatever the point being is is that all these centers are being
[03:28:37.080 --> 03:28:40.040]  stopped all the prisons are being stopped you know whether people want to
[03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:43.640]  believe that auto carrier cars can be used for human beings or not
[03:28:43.640 --> 03:28:46.920]  i'm not going to argue the point the thing is we see everything
[03:28:46.920 --> 03:28:51.320]  going on the vilification of veterans that's the one that really threw me off
[03:28:51.320 --> 03:28:54.360]  alex because a veteran should have been screaming at the top of their
[03:28:54.360 --> 03:28:58.600]  well steve i mean it's admitted their training for martial law and military
[03:28:58.600 --> 03:29:02.840]  lockdown and mass arrest and saying we can only keep you safe we can arrest
[03:29:02.840 --> 03:29:06.680]  citizens and strip them of habeas corpus we can only keep you safe
[03:29:06.680 --> 03:29:11.000]  if we can torture i mean look at the north korea situation you've got
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:14.920]  uh the swiss company headed up by rumsfeld giving them the nukes
[03:29:14.920 --> 03:29:20.920]  uh and then and then now right on time uh having the north attack that south
[03:29:20.920 --> 03:29:24.920]  korean ship and this is all happening at at the
[03:29:24.920 --> 03:29:28.600]  perfect time with what's going on in the economy as well
[03:29:28.600 --> 03:29:33.640]  uh but key article up on prisonplanet.com you can also read the pdf document

[03:35:53.240 --> 03:35:57.160]  dot com and alex just in the sense we've been on the air together
[03:35:57.160 --> 03:36:00.520]  uh a guide that's worked on these just have me an email saying i've worked on
[03:36:00.520 --> 03:36:03.800]  about six of these rooms across the state they use them to keep
[03:36:03.800 --> 03:36:07.720]  by anonymity of the people working in them we had to have a ten-year
[03:36:07.720 --> 03:36:11.560]  background check including full fingerprints on a 30-page form
[03:36:11.560 --> 03:36:14.680]  i've worked in many other post office and federal buildings without any
[03:36:14.680 --> 03:36:19.880]  background work the head of the project was a 20-year veteran of the cia
[03:36:19.880 --> 03:36:25.160]  i'm not lying so interesting because again now you've got domestic
[03:36:25.160 --> 03:36:29.960]  intelligence being turned internally we've got the biggest wars potential
[03:36:29.960 --> 03:36:33.320]  being uh uh let's say coming to a focus
[03:36:33.320 --> 03:36:37.960]  and every effort that can be made to ultimately make war against american
[03:36:37.960 --> 03:36:41.480]  people in prison and torture the american people
[03:36:41.480 --> 03:36:45.960]  and it's all going on with the guys of uh you know domestic security i've got to
[03:36:45.960 --> 03:36:49.800]  tell you alex that what we're talking about we're hitting a nerve now also
[03:36:49.800 --> 03:36:53.800]  something that your listeners need to know in real time frequency alerts are
[03:36:53.800 --> 03:36:57.960]  up on hf radio frequencies for all the american troops on the korean peninsula
[03:36:57.960 --> 03:37:01.880]  uh the story's coming out on the news wire no no no they admit we may have
[03:37:01.880 --> 03:37:04.680]  nuclear war they admit we're in a war footing
[03:37:04.680 --> 03:37:08.280]  that north korea could strike if north korea does one thing
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:11.240]  including bringing their ships into korean south korean waters
[03:37:11.240 --> 03:37:14.120]  south korea is going to attack i mean we could see
[03:37:14.120 --> 03:37:17.640]  the start of world war three and notice how this is happening
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:22.760]  right on time with the banking collapse absolutely and and but i didn't get
[03:37:22.760 --> 03:37:26.600]  chance to finish that's really critical is he said steve as an mb
[03:37:26.600 --> 03:37:30.680]  span instructor for american troops area i can tell you there are more tactical
[03:37:30.680 --> 03:37:34.520]  news here than you can shake a stick at so when you said world war three alex
[03:37:34.520 --> 03:37:37.160]  that's exactly it now look here's the deal
[03:37:37.160 --> 03:37:40.520]  if a banking crisis is worldwide they have to
[03:37:40.520 --> 03:37:44.840]  take down they the luciferians the new illuminati the globalists have to take
[03:37:44.840 --> 03:37:47.480]  down the entire banking system of the world
[03:37:47.480 --> 03:37:51.400]  and they are caught literally with nothing in their vaults
[03:37:51.400 --> 03:37:55.320]  and so the point is is that a war is wonderful the old statement that a
[03:37:55.320 --> 03:37:58.600]  banker makes more in one day of war than a european
[03:37:58.600 --> 03:38:02.360]  still becomes true because remember whoever's going to shoot at whoever else
[03:38:02.360 --> 03:38:06.280]  when it all breaks loose somebody's paying for the bombs bullets as gerald
[03:38:06.280 --> 03:38:11.160]  solente says you know it's the bankers it's the bombs that's the bullets
[03:38:11.160 --> 03:38:15.320]  well i agree with you now this could be averted this
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:20.840]  this could be averted but gerald solente uh... dr paul craig roberts
[03:38:20.840 --> 03:38:25.400]  uh... webster tarply yourself every expert we have on
[03:38:25.400 --> 03:38:28.440]  and the ran corporation agrees they said this two years ago
[03:38:28.440 --> 03:38:31.880]  the only way to get their world government the only way to get the people
[03:38:31.880 --> 03:38:34.760]  to stand down and go along with the tyranny
[03:38:34.760 --> 03:38:38.600]  is to launch a major war and one of the ran corporation say in 2008
[03:38:38.600 --> 03:38:42.360]  paul wassen wrote an article about this they said
[03:38:42.360 --> 03:38:45.960]  a theater war like iraq isn't big enough
[03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:49.880]  iran isn't big enough it needs to be as big
[03:38:49.880 --> 03:38:54.360]  as world war two where is the only place to kick that off
[03:38:54.360 --> 03:38:57.320]  well to be as big as world war two it's going to be in two different areas at
[03:38:57.320 --> 03:39:00.600]  least a perfect place to start iran
[03:39:00.600 --> 03:39:05.400]  and north korea but here's my issue we know the aiatollah khamenei was brought
[03:39:05.400 --> 03:39:09.160]  into power by the west because the shawl wasn't doing what he was told
[03:39:09.160 --> 03:39:13.160]  that's actually on record they have the arms for hostage situation
[03:39:13.160 --> 03:39:17.240]  then the aiatollahs the imams backstab the globalist
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:21.640]  at least on the surface we know nukes were given to pakistan by israel the
[03:39:21.640 --> 03:39:25.640]  us in england that's on record also it just came out that israel was giving
[03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:29.400]  them to uh just to south africa why to destabilize
[03:39:29.400 --> 03:39:33.960]  things and we know that abb and rumsfeld in
[03:39:33.960 --> 03:39:37.640]  96 and then again in 2000 gave the nukes to north korea
[03:39:37.640 --> 03:39:42.120]  what is the master geopolitical strategy in that
[03:39:42.120 --> 03:39:45.080]  well the master geopolitical strategy is simply
[03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:48.840]  they are going to initiate a global conflagration
[03:39:48.840 --> 03:39:52.680]  it's going to be billed as the battle of armageddon and it's not the
[03:39:52.680 --> 03:39:55.640]  biblix not to be confused with the biblical battle of armageddon
[03:39:55.640 --> 03:39:59.480]  and they're going to bring about their solution to the world look these guys
[03:39:59.480 --> 03:40:03.160]  are just the perfect dialectic dialectic demons okay
[03:40:03.160 --> 03:40:05.960]  they're generating the problem they're going to provide their solution and the
[03:40:05.960 --> 03:40:10.200]  solution is going to be that quite candid that five and a half billion people
[03:40:10.200 --> 03:40:13.160]  if they have their way and they're not going to have their way
[03:40:13.160 --> 03:40:16.840]  but if they have their way they'd like to see 90 percent of the world's
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:20.520]  population destroyed now alex if you mix into this the whole
[03:40:20.520 --> 03:40:24.840]  situation the gulf why is it that that oil platform
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:28.600]  seemingly the stories even the guys that worked on as you know i think you
[03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:32.760]  covered this are sequestered why is it that the original stories were
[03:40:32.760 --> 03:40:34.680]  slot teams and by the way those weren't
[03:40:34.680 --> 03:40:38.360]  slot teams those were special operations teams that were put on
[03:40:38.360 --> 03:40:42.200]  different golf platforms why is it that all this stuff seemingly
[03:40:42.200 --> 03:40:47.320]  happened within the last 14 days if you will 21 days and the deal is
[03:40:47.320 --> 03:40:52.360]  that it all was almost synchronized and coordinated perfectly as if someone
[03:40:52.360 --> 03:40:55.640]  flipped on the switch my answer that is someone did flip on the switch
[03:40:55.640 --> 03:41:01.880]  the banking problem is so uh severe that in essence i'll sum it up like this
[03:41:01.880 --> 03:41:08.280]  every nation in the world is flat ass and flat out broke the derivatives problem
[03:41:08.280 --> 03:41:12.520]  which we've talked about for a decade and a half you've talked about all of the
[03:41:12.520 --> 03:41:15.400]  different experts you've interviewed the guys i've interviewed
[03:41:15.400 --> 03:41:19.000]  they're all saying the same thing but as long as the band plays on
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:22.600]  the tv stays on and the name becomes the
[03:41:22.600 --> 03:41:26.040]  the expected people are not going to be thinking and so now
[03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:31.880]  every single thing is converging every single thing that's been warned about
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:36.120]  the police state tactics the FEMA camps the torture centers everything
[03:41:36.120 --> 03:41:39.960]  and you know it's amazing because when even a quote good
[03:41:39.960 --> 03:41:43.160]  uh seemingly moral people said that's all right to torture
[03:41:43.160 --> 03:41:48.200]  i said how dare you say that do you not understand the case that everything is
[03:41:48.200 --> 03:41:53.080]  being done overseas is going to come back on your shore on our shore
[03:41:53.080 --> 03:41:56.440]  and i can tell you alex shame on america
[03:41:56.440 --> 03:41:59.720]  shame on its politicians for not speaking out against torture
[03:41:59.720 --> 03:42:02.920]  because the bottom line is when i hear and when i see
[03:42:02.920 --> 03:42:05.880]  the documents you're seeing and i hear the reports you're hearing we hear
[03:42:05.880 --> 03:42:09.800]  different reports similar report it makes me furious
[03:42:09.800 --> 03:42:13.080]  absolutely i know i've cleared the phone lines i'm sorry for those that were
[03:42:13.080 --> 03:42:16.440]  holding on other subjects i want to just take a few calls here
[03:42:16.440 --> 03:42:19.480]  for people specifically that have been involved
[03:42:19.480 --> 03:42:23.400]  in building these torture facilities these soundproof
[03:42:23.400 --> 03:42:30.120]  uh secret uh jails and rendition centers absolutely snatch and grab
[03:42:30.120 --> 03:42:32.840]  centers and we separately have them on the news saying we want to arrest
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:36.360]  citizens secretly we want to have the pentagon arrest whoever they want
[03:42:36.360 --> 03:42:39.640]  and only an act of congress can find out where they went so so that's
[03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:42.600]  mainstream news now folks this is really going on
[03:42:42.600 --> 03:42:45.640]  and what mother place in the post office they've admitted
[03:42:45.640 --> 03:42:49.800]  they want to use the post office for mass arrest and forced inoculation
[03:42:49.800 --> 03:42:54.360]  paul watson has that in his article at prisonplanet.com so we know they've
[03:42:54.360 --> 03:42:57.320]  talked about this in the past and then watson
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:01.960]  uh did find a mainline web page which talks about how the architecture firm
[03:43:01.960 --> 03:43:06.520]  ipg architects constructed the criminal investigative
[03:43:06.520 --> 03:43:10.200]  offices within the makin post office and makin georgia
[03:43:10.200 --> 03:43:13.400]  the new documents describe similar rooms being constructed in lake forest
[03:43:13.400 --> 03:43:17.000]  illinois and uh other areas of the country
[03:43:17.000 --> 03:43:19.960]  and you look at these these are secret dungeons
[03:43:19.960 --> 03:43:23.800]  where they can bring you in the back of a postal vehicle bag over your head
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:27.800]  you're brought in into into a cat a catwalk big sealed door
[03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:32.840]  uh two-way mirrors uh you know this is the secret police this is the secret
[03:43:32.840 --> 03:43:35.400]  america and we know the black sites in europe
[03:43:35.400 --> 03:43:40.600]  are postal facilities and and and horse ranches and shut down grocery stores
[03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:45.560]  and shut down auto parts facilities and they just take you in there and torture
[03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:50.680]  the living daylights out of you uh and uh this is a just an archipelago a
[03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:54.760]  gulag hell folks they're on the news telling you
[03:43:54.760 --> 03:43:57.880]  tortures good of children to get answers and of course
[03:43:57.880 --> 03:44:03.080]  steve quill mentioned this incredible articles up at gcnlive.com
[03:44:03.080 --> 03:44:07.240]  by steve watson uh former cia officials admit
[03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:12.040]  to faking bin laden video military syops took over operation after
[03:44:12.040 --> 03:44:15.240]  intelligence project failed to take off
[03:44:15.240 --> 03:44:20.280]  and uh the you know the incredible part is this is even in the washington post
[03:44:20.280 --> 03:44:22.760]  steve what's happening well let me get the number out
[03:44:22.760 --> 03:44:29.160]  1-800-259-9231 quit calls if you've worked in these facilities 800
[03:44:29.160 --> 03:44:34.280]  259-9231 or have you helped build them or have you worked in a post office and
[03:44:34.280 --> 03:44:37.640]  you've suddenly seen them build a new room or a new building off the
[03:44:37.640 --> 03:44:40.200]  structure and you're told not to go in there and it's all locked up
[03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:43.240]  we want to hear from you 800 when we've confirmed it's real
[03:44:43.240 --> 03:44:50.040]  but the point is we want to hear from you 1-800-259-9231 but steve what is the
[03:44:50.040 --> 03:44:53.160]  issue here where we knew the government was bringing narcotics in the 60s but
[03:44:53.160 --> 03:44:55.880]  now they come on the news and say we're growing the opium
[03:44:55.880 --> 03:44:59.720]  it's a good thing suddenly they're not even hiding things anymore they're
[03:44:59.720 --> 03:45:03.320]  admitting world government they're admitting they ship in the cocaine
[03:45:03.320 --> 03:45:07.560]  they're just it's it's just incredible what is happening steve well i think
[03:45:07.560 --> 03:45:12.040]  at the first of all they don't care anymore where the cloak of secrecy
[03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:15.560]  provided them the ability to do all this stuff and do it with the american
[03:45:15.560 --> 03:45:21.160]  people gladly paying their taxes uh you know going along with the idea that
[03:45:21.160 --> 03:45:24.760]  america would never be responsible or be involved in something like this
[03:45:24.760 --> 03:45:28.600]  it's kind of a gloating session to the same degree that
[03:45:28.600 --> 03:45:33.160]  that um and certain sex around the world have to warn you before they kill you
[03:45:33.160 --> 03:45:36.760]  these guys are perverts but they're totally perverts okay
[03:45:36.760 --> 03:45:40.920]  and they're perverted in the glee they get out of seeing the control you know
[03:45:40.920 --> 03:45:43.400]  alex you and i've talked about this so many times over the years
[03:45:43.400 --> 03:45:48.200]  they are truly controlled freaks but the ultimate power left the club life and
[03:45:48.200 --> 03:45:51.960]  death they actually believe that they're gone little g
[03:45:51.960 --> 03:45:55.800]  and that provides the ultimate base in the conflict for
[03:45:55.800 --> 03:45:59.160]  the ultimate showdown in history and that's what we're heading for
[03:45:59.160 --> 03:46:02.440]  look you've got all the reports coming in the middle east whether egypt's
[03:46:02.440 --> 03:46:05.640]  uh really preparing to attack israel israel's preparing to get around
[03:46:05.640 --> 03:46:08.360]  around to a pretty preemptively going to hit israel
[03:46:08.360 --> 03:46:11.480]  and turkey just basically said the united states go to hell
[03:46:11.480 --> 03:46:14.280]  by the way we have a lot of nuclear weapons at israelic
[03:46:14.280 --> 03:46:18.520]  air force base in turkey so the point that i'm trying to make is that the
[03:46:18.520 --> 03:46:22.200]  volatility of hotspots by the way we're going to go into chevezland too
[03:46:22.200 --> 03:46:26.280]  i mean that's a venezuela we're building for that that was a whole purpose
[03:46:26.280 --> 03:46:29.960]  yeah this is this is one or three i hatey
[03:46:29.960 --> 03:46:32.520]  absolutely steve i want to go to some calls and we'll have to have you back
[03:46:32.520 --> 03:46:35.720]  up the next few days if you can do it it's always hard to get steve on we
[03:46:35.720 --> 03:46:38.760]  appreciate him coming on today but i wanted to bring this up
[03:46:38.760 --> 03:46:42.360]  again they're going to tell the post offices this is for postal inspector
[03:46:42.360 --> 03:46:46.120]  investigations but they've always had those offices we've done the research
[03:46:46.120 --> 03:46:49.720]  these are new hardened soundproofed facilities
[03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:53.400]  and they're building them everywhere and they admit it has the dual use of
[03:46:53.400 --> 03:46:57.800]  interrogation and forced inoculation that's the issue
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:01.160]  and then alex if it weren't for all those issues they wouldn't be
[03:47:01.160 --> 03:47:04.760]  bulletproofing the glass they wouldn't be soundproofing the rooms
[03:47:04.760 --> 03:47:09.960]  and they wouldn't uh be sequestering the access to only a select few that are
[03:47:09.960 --> 03:47:14.120]  involved and allowed access to that look it's right into your eyes
[03:47:14.120 --> 03:47:16.840]  they've already declared their whole hand it's
[03:47:16.840 --> 03:47:21.000]  absolutely happening now and the thing is the question is what is the trigger
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:23.640]  point that's the question i get asked a hundred times a day
[03:47:23.640 --> 03:47:27.640]  i do not know the trigger point but i can tell you this every six-shooter in the
[03:47:27.640 --> 03:47:31.080]  room is hammer back and finger on the trigger
[03:47:31.080 --> 03:47:34.280]  well no doubt i mean look at north korea we'll be covering that more tomorrow i
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:38.520]  mean open talk of world war three is this being used as a political threat to
[03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:42.840]  the nation states pay us the tens of trillions to the bankers give us a
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:46.520]  world order we'll start world war three that's why the globalists gave nukes to
[03:47:46.520 --> 03:47:50.920]  pakistan nukes to south africa uh nukes uh to
[03:47:50.920 --> 03:47:55.160]  north korea or will they go ahead and carry it out
[03:47:55.160 --> 03:47:58.680]  bottom they have to carry it out because look the financial
[03:47:58.680 --> 03:48:04.760]  uh meltdown is so now out of control and and there is no answer there is no
[03:48:04.760 --> 03:48:08.280]  solution you've got 40 million people on food stamps you've got the commercial
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:11.880]  real estate market ready to crash and you know i get emails i don't know if you
[03:48:11.880 --> 03:48:15.960]  get these aleks or people say well it is as bad as you guys said it is no it's
[03:48:15.960 --> 03:48:19.560]  going to be worse and the fact is is that when you've got a whole
[03:48:19.560 --> 03:48:23.640]  a whole uh uh a plethora of information
[03:48:23.640 --> 03:48:28.120]  voluminous in research people say well i just don't believe it it has nothing to
[03:48:28.120 --> 03:48:31.720]  it but well there's no doubt they're geared up for world war three in total
[03:48:31.720 --> 03:48:34.440]  march along gun confiscation that's all admitted
[03:48:34.440 --> 03:48:37.640]  and their finger is starting to squeeze on the trigger and hopefully we get the
[03:48:37.640 --> 03:48:40.920]  word out we can avert this but at least we put the word out
[03:48:40.920 --> 03:48:44.920]  terry in florida did you work on one of these facilities
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:51.480]  well no i didn't work in it but uh it's uh a branch post office that i go into
[03:48:51.480 --> 03:48:59.960]  and it has uh special rooms and uh like a jail and uh soundproof
[03:48:59.960 --> 03:49:05.880]  and uh you know it's not like a normal post office that i grew up with so
[03:49:05.880 --> 03:49:12.920]  those those type of post offices do exist oh man and they admit seven years
[03:49:12.920 --> 03:49:15.640]  ago they're going to be used during martial law and forced inoculation
[03:49:15.640 --> 03:49:18.440]  that's another good point steve i've noticed a lot of new post offices
[03:49:18.440 --> 03:49:22.680]  themselves are like armored prisons absolutely even the little time i live
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:26.040]  in bozeman our main post office everything is done
[03:49:26.040 --> 03:49:29.960]  through guard gates going down into i mean their electronic guard gates with
[03:49:29.960 --> 03:49:33.800]  passes i mean there's so much stuff going on in the little communities you know
[03:49:33.800 --> 03:49:36.440]  we're about i don't know 40 50 000 people here
[03:49:36.440 --> 03:49:41.720]  but alex everything is being hardened okay and and the siege mentality
[03:49:41.720 --> 03:49:45.240]  uh in hell in montana we have one of the federal reserve banks
[03:49:45.240 --> 03:49:49.160]  and i mean the guys that are familiar with what's going on up there they said
[03:49:49.160 --> 03:49:53.080]  steve it's like they're expecting a uh full-scale war against them well look
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:57.160]  steve as you know for four years all the big money's been leaving the country
[03:49:57.160 --> 03:50:02.040]  absolutely i mean in a literal evacuation john wane family is leaving i
[03:50:02.040 --> 03:50:05.000]  confirm that from central texas i'll just leave it at that
[03:50:05.000 --> 03:50:09.800]  and remember three months before the fake flu thing the feds put out
[03:50:09.800 --> 03:50:12.840]  we had the emergency manager out of indiana
[03:50:12.840 --> 03:50:15.720]  where the feds came to them and said we're getting ready for millions dead
[03:50:15.720 --> 03:50:19.560]  from the flu it will happen they use that as a smoke screen
[03:50:19.560 --> 03:50:22.840]  to get their grid in place and we confirmed it then out of the bureau of
[03:50:22.840 --> 03:50:26.360]  cemeteries was getting ready for it in uh new york state
[03:50:26.360 --> 03:50:30.200]  and so clearly and and and they told the emergency managers they said
[03:50:30.200 --> 03:50:33.960]  marshal law harden your police stations and fire
[03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:38.120]  departments from the citizens now what is it the government's been planning
[03:50:38.120 --> 03:50:41.160]  where they think the citizens are going to be attacking all the police station
[03:50:41.160 --> 03:50:43.560]  steve well first of all it's going to be the
[03:50:43.560 --> 03:50:47.160]  financial shutdown of the country first and foremost alex look
[03:50:47.160 --> 03:50:51.080]  you and i did the show the night that one day let's remind everybody

[03:51:11.960 --> 03:51:15.240]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[03:51:15.240 --> 03:51:18.200]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even
[03:51:18.200 --> 03:51:20.760]  happen again so our friends at solutions from
[03:51:20.760 --> 03:51:23.640]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid

[03:54:25.960 --> 03:54:29.160]  i mean mexico has such an aggressive stance towards the united states in
[03:54:29.160 --> 03:54:32.600]  calderon demanding we turn in our semi-automatic rifles

[03:54:41.720 --> 03:54:45.080]  into break there well right i just want to remind everybody the
[03:54:45.080 --> 03:54:48.280]  effect that was taking place remember alex the night that
[03:54:48.280 --> 03:54:51.560]  we did the show and i don't know it was afternoon or a night it was the
[03:54:51.560 --> 03:54:55.560]  afternoon show we did and we prayed and and it was it was it was like
[03:54:55.560 --> 03:54:58.920]  everything was scheduled to go under martial law remember the who had
[03:54:58.920 --> 03:55:02.200]  exerted their authority the military was on uh
[03:55:02.200 --> 03:55:06.520]  alert the military was giving command signals to everybody that this is it
[03:55:06.520 --> 03:55:11.880]  and instantly instantly within 24 hours and it was within 24 hours the whole
[03:55:11.880 --> 03:55:15.720]  thing died down i'm telling people do not lose hope pray like you've never
[03:55:15.720 --> 03:55:20.280]  prayed before that the evil beads of darkness will be exposed to the white
[03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:24.360]  and seriously folks this is the same kind of thing well but listen i mean
[03:55:24.360 --> 03:55:27.640]  they're talking about one false move by the south of the north
[03:55:27.640 --> 03:55:30.600]  they're going to have a nuclear war on the korean peninsula they're talking
[03:55:30.600 --> 03:55:33.960]  about going into iran they're talking about global financial meltdown any
[03:55:33.960 --> 03:55:36.760]  day clearly we all need to be praying to god
[03:55:36.760 --> 03:55:39.960]  regardless getting ourselves right with god because
[03:55:39.960 --> 03:55:44.120]  you know there are no atheists in foxholes and and and and and the other
[03:55:44.120 --> 03:55:48.200]  globalists through crises after crises get us conditioned to just accept
[03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:51.800]  crises we need to get upset about these stage crises
[03:55:51.800 --> 03:55:57.160]  that are taking place uh steve in new york you're on the air go ahead
[03:55:57.160 --> 03:56:02.200]  and and the same as uh we're talking about post offices it's not just post
[03:56:02.200 --> 03:56:06.120]  offices it's they're they're building army reserve centers where it's very
[03:56:06.120 --> 03:56:11.080]  heavily fortified center rooms in them uh which could potentially go to
[03:56:11.080 --> 03:56:14.920]  underground yeah they've got threat fusion centers merging the military the
[03:56:14.920 --> 03:56:17.720]  police uh everything publicly that's a good point
[03:56:17.720 --> 03:56:20.440]  steve well absolutely and i want to share
[03:56:20.440 --> 03:56:23.080]  something you know this country was supposed to be
[03:56:23.080 --> 03:56:27.240]  uh by the people for the people we're a republic okay
[03:56:27.240 --> 03:56:30.440]  but the i think it's important for people to understand that as you and i
[03:56:30.440 --> 03:56:34.920]  alex are broadcasting right now there are people that are absolutely
[03:56:34.920 --> 03:56:40.040]  giving uh confirmation and information to the different uh
[03:56:40.040 --> 03:56:43.880]  places around the country by the way fusion centers fusion centers now the
[03:56:43.880 --> 03:56:48.600]  military is linked into all uh domestic law enforcement highway
[03:56:48.600 --> 03:56:51.800]  patrol etc so now the bottom line is they have their
[03:56:51.800 --> 03:56:55.560]  their own digital codes they can lock out specific police
[03:56:55.560 --> 03:56:59.560]  as well as allow them and so one of the ways that i've tried to warn all these
[03:56:59.560 --> 03:57:03.240]  years over the blue list the blue list are those people that will be
[03:57:03.240 --> 03:57:07.480]  uh assisting in the destruction of their fellow americans primarily law
[03:57:07.480 --> 03:57:11.160]  enforcement and after they've done their dirty work alex those guys get
[03:57:11.160 --> 03:57:15.320]  whacked too so please if you're in law enforcement folks this isn't a joke you've
[03:57:15.320 --> 03:57:18.520]  got supreme court nominees saying ban free speech
[03:57:18.520 --> 03:57:22.040]  and ban the second amendment anything else steven new york about how they're
[03:57:22.040 --> 03:57:24.200]  hardening all these government facilities
[03:57:24.200 --> 03:57:27.640]  well it's a new facility that they're building right here out my back door
[03:57:27.640 --> 03:57:31.720]  um i and i would only be able to get the evidence by
[03:57:31.720 --> 03:57:37.320]  by applying for a job there and i saw i saw the facility i i couldn't take
[03:57:37.320 --> 03:57:40.760]  any pictures because of course uh cameras weren't allowed
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:44.280]  well again the steve you're right on because every facility that's being
[03:57:44.280 --> 03:57:47.640]  built now is being built for d-day whatever
[03:57:47.640 --> 03:57:52.440]  day that that's determined to be but the point is is these are military fortresses
[03:57:52.440 --> 03:57:57.160]  they're being manned with uh uh state-of-the-art weaponry state-of-the-art
[03:57:57.160 --> 03:58:00.040]  surveillance state-of-the-art satellite uplink and downlink
[03:58:00.040 --> 03:58:05.320]  capabilities beyond state-of-the-art uh communications direct to the military
[03:58:05.320 --> 03:58:09.400]  and alex what we're what we are is a nation under siege
[03:58:09.400 --> 03:58:12.520]  and we are a nation soon to be embroiled in the worst
[03:58:12.520 --> 03:58:16.280]  case scenario in nightmare ever imagined yeah they're locking us down to get
[03:58:16.280 --> 03:58:19.240]  ready for world war three and during world war three they're going to attack
