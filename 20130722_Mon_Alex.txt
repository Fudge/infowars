[00:00.000 --> 00:13.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.760 --> 00:24.080]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen
[00:24.080 --> 00:33.840]  it is Monday the 22nd day of July 2013 and we are going to be live here for the next three hours
[00:33.840 --> 00:42.640]  Lord willing Larry Elder who stood up against Pierce Morgan last week exposing the fact that the
[00:42.640 --> 00:48.240]  media is race baiting and trying to create division is going to be joining us in the second hour and
[00:48.240 --> 00:56.160]  we'll take your calls then as well on the deepening racial divisions being openly nakedly
[00:56.160 --> 01:02.160]  disgustingly engineered by the kleptocratic authoritarian liberals and again they're not
[01:02.160 --> 01:05.920]  liberals ladies and gentlemen I take great umbrage with the fact that they're called
[01:05.920 --> 01:14.160]  liberals or progressives they are neo-malthusian neo feudalist who want a command and control economy
[01:14.160 --> 01:23.440]  and a publicly stagnated and reversed society under agenda 21 and the problem is the so-called
[01:23.440 --> 01:30.400]  republican leadership is part of the very same guild on so many fronts the establishment likes
[01:30.400 --> 01:36.080]  to have some opposition in the power structure so that one group can't get too powerful and unseat
[01:36.080 --> 01:45.200]  the hereditary oligarchs themselves that sit above the puppet governing class but I've got a lot of
[01:45.200 --> 01:52.560]  news obviously I want to get to today Ed Asner is going to be popping in as well and we will have
[01:52.560 --> 02:02.880]  open phones starting in the first hour now this morning watching television early this morning
[02:02.880 --> 02:09.280]  and then listening to a television on xm and then tuning into local radio I was ashamed to hear
[02:09.280 --> 02:25.120]  nothing but on its face royal worship it is 24 7 coverage on every channel fox cnn msnbc all of it
[02:25.120 --> 02:34.960]  nbc abc cbs on and on and on every single channel and it made me think of ebb or bernay's the father
[02:34.960 --> 02:40.560]  of modern propaganda and what he said about royalty and how they would create an artificial
[02:40.560 --> 02:48.640]  royalty in this country of the governing class and of the hollywood class fusing the two and then
[02:48.640 --> 02:57.280]  selling americans values based on celebrity empty celebrity instead of having a culture based on
[02:58.000 --> 03:05.760]  liberty and freedom and the family and development when this country was the dominant force in the
[03:05.760 --> 03:16.240]  world and its first 170 180 years or so the rock stars were inventors they were scientists they
[03:16.240 --> 03:22.240]  were trailblazers they were investigators they were heroes they were people that made sacrifices
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.600]  there are people that went against the grain and the social engineer saw that so they created the
[03:27.600 --> 03:33.600]  fake 60s movement and things that was meant to look like it was anti-establishment on the surface
[03:33.600 --> 03:40.800]  but was actually an establishment salvo pointed right at the life force of this country and of
[03:40.800 --> 03:47.760]  the world so i'm going to be getting to that uh after i take some phone calls the toll free

[04:41.520 --> 04:48.400]  ancient tyrannical form of government now being allotted and pushed as progressive as long as it's

[09:10.320 --> 09:16.160]  dot com all right here's what i want to do i want to shake up the broadcast and i talk about this
[09:16.160 --> 09:20.240]  a lot never seem to get around to it i want to go to your phone calls out of the gates today
[09:21.440 --> 09:27.200]  and then in the second half of the hour uh kind of flip the script then go to the news
[09:27.200 --> 09:35.520]  and we are going to get into cia max six hundred and thirty thousand dollar study
[09:35.520 --> 09:39.600]  into how to control global weather through geoengineering that's the london independent
[09:39.600 --> 09:44.880]  and the only reason they're covering it is as a public study ladies and gentlemen there is five
[09:44.880 --> 09:50.720]  billion dollars a year you just type that into a search engine being spent by the department of
[09:50.720 --> 09:58.320]  energy in weather modification programs the programs are admitted the money is admitted
[09:58.320 --> 10:04.320]  what they're doing is classified and their response this is also in the london guardian
[10:04.320 --> 10:09.680]  is reporting on the department of energy spending billions of dollars in geoengineering billions
[10:10.400 --> 10:16.640]  bill gates has spent more than twenty billion dollars in the last fifteen years or so
[10:16.640 --> 10:23.280]  uh on these programs he does it all tax exempt he gets government contracts with a tax exempt
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.320]  company he's got don't believe me just type in bill gates has weather control company
[10:30.000 --> 10:36.960]  that aims to to create and steer and kill and control hurricanes that's mainstream news
[10:37.680 --> 10:40.800]  oh yeah there's one in guardian bill gates backs climate scientists lobbying for large
[10:40.800 --> 10:48.240]  scale geoengineering but when i talk about this what is what is racial madow do she comes out
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.880]  and says alex jones says obama sent the tornado when i said i don't believe obama sent the tornado
[10:56.240 --> 10:59.680]  but i said you never know because there's been so much weather modification their weather
[10:59.680 --> 11:03.680]  modification could have been connected to that the weather's been altered it's a chain reaction
[11:03.680 --> 11:11.920]  but i said tornadoes are 60 year low it probably wasn't that turns into esquire in bloomberg an
[11:11.920 --> 11:18.960]  associated press calling my office saying they want comments on how obama sent the tornado
[11:21.680 --> 11:27.520]  now again this didn't particularly hurt me i use as an example though of the type of stuff
[11:27.520 --> 11:33.920]  they're making up the things they're doing yeah there it is madel hammers crackpond alex jones
[11:33.920 --> 11:39.520]  oklahoma tornado weather weapon conspiracy theory and i keep going back to that because
[11:39.520 --> 11:45.840]  that's now the meme that the white house run media matters kicked off that they're still pushing
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.520]  they don't say i'm lying about billions of bullets and thousands of armored vehicles and
[11:49.520 --> 11:53.760]  domestic plans to take our guns on record if they can get away with it they don't talk about
[11:53.760 --> 11:58.400]  the domestic drones that's been admitted to the nsa spying on us uh or our government training
[11:58.400 --> 12:03.520]  with foreign troops for domestic security operations or 85 billion a month given to foreign
[12:03.520 --> 12:08.640]  offshore banks of taxpayer money or all the government narcotics trafficking in big banks
[12:08.640 --> 12:13.920]  openly announcing world government and obama citing an executive order to expand carbon taxes
[12:13.920 --> 12:19.600]  outside of congress or how obama and the globalist doing everything they can to deindustrialize us
[12:19.600 --> 12:26.160]  and ship our jobs overseas while obama goes on a tour of baloney and bs bravo sierra to tell
[12:26.160 --> 12:31.520]  everybody that he's trying to get the economy going no no ladies and gentlemen it's all that i
[12:31.520 --> 12:37.440]  said obama said a tornado they are a pack of liars so that's the kind of news that's coming up
[12:39.360 --> 12:43.360]  larry elder is going to be joining us uh he's been sparring with the establishment uh
[12:43.360 --> 12:52.560]  racepaders like the tiny viewership uh red codus maximus uh jolly rogerus peers morganus
[12:53.680 --> 12:59.440]  so that's coming up we're going to get into of course what we reported years ago now confirmed
[12:59.440 --> 13:04.480]  germany is involved with the nsa spying on everything oh incredible news that's all over
[13:04.480 --> 13:11.120]  mainstream media they all get pulled surprises for it we're going to get into the latest on the
[13:11.120 --> 13:16.000]  economy that i was just mentioning and so much more today a jam packed transmission
[13:21.360 --> 13:26.720]  and i'm also speaking of red codus maximus i'm going to get into at the bottom of the hour
[13:30.880 --> 13:37.280]  the parallels between british royalty and the way that propaganda is sold and the way they can get
[13:37.280 --> 13:44.640]  on average over 70 percent of brits to say they support the monarchy it's it's the similar
[13:44.640 --> 13:50.400]  psychology and formulae that they've used to turn obama into the p schnick trendy when he's really
[13:50.400 --> 13:57.840]  a fascistic warmongering foaming at the mouth uh dictator he may leave office but the presidency
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.600]  is being turned into a dictatorship and i've been saying that for years and you know the mainstream
[14:01.600 --> 14:06.720]  media has a meme of where's the dictatorship where's the martial law gee i don't know warrantless
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.880]  checkpoints all over the country government spying on you without warrants forced inoculations
[14:10.880 --> 14:18.160]  going on outside of law from alabama to california pension funds public and private being looted in
[14:18.160 --> 14:23.920]  mass i've got articles uh on that today major cities going bankrupt from california to michigan
[14:25.120 --> 14:31.760]  from florida to new york from iowa to tennessee all by design all actually worried out
[14:31.760 --> 14:46.560]  this is the reality and we are being eased in to the collapse of society to consolidate control
[14:47.680 --> 14:55.520]  and only being aware of the fact that it is a planned engineered purposeful breaking of the
[14:55.520 --> 15:02.240]  social contract to move to a system of authoritarianism because the establishment has said in the club
[15:02.240 --> 15:07.360]  of rome documents and all the rest they're not going to let the general public have access
[15:07.360 --> 15:12.720]  to the new technologies the new free energy systems the clean energy systems they're going to give us
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.840]  fake energy systems that are just boondoggles and payoffs to themselves they want in their own words
[15:17.840 --> 15:25.280]  a neo feudalistic form of global fascism that is the builder berg groups own statements that's club
[15:25.280 --> 15:30.800]  of rome i have a bibliographed on the site what is the endgame dot com and in that film that's
[15:30.800 --> 15:38.960]  seminal film if you want to go see where it's at this is the reality of what we face as a society
[15:38.960 --> 15:49.200]  and it's very painful to see this unfolding in our culture and to see the the hereditary
[15:49.200 --> 15:55.200]  dictators of england who aren't even british they're not scottish they're not irish they're not
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.600]  celtic they're not Celtic they are not they're not from gall they're not from even germania really
[16:05.600 --> 16:11.120]  nothing against romanians nothing against transylvanians but that's really who they are
[16:11.760 --> 16:18.240]  is a group of people that beat the muslim invasion
[16:22.880 --> 16:29.600]  of eastern and western europe you know the muslims before the crusade drove them back
[16:29.600 --> 16:36.160]  this is just history seized all the way into areas of germany and into poland
[16:38.480 --> 16:44.720]  and so i guess your their argument is we have a right to rule we i mean i i've got it you know
[16:44.720 --> 16:50.720]  if there's any reason to give the transylvanian royalty a little i mean these are the these are
[16:50.720 --> 16:57.120]  the progeny they are the royal bloodline of laddie and paler uh he has a name it's called count
[16:57.120 --> 17:00.560]  dracula dracool the dragon
[17:05.520 --> 17:11.840]  and so that's their argument that's why they say that uh they are really allowed to rule
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.800]  and they say that they are related going back all the way i mean you can look this up the queen
[17:16.800 --> 17:23.120]  was coordinated on the stone it's up in scotland the stone of destiny they say that they go all
[17:23.120 --> 17:30.880]  the way back to abraham and that then the the the royal family moved into what is transylvanian
[17:30.880 --> 17:38.480]  today uh and stopped the invasion
[17:43.200 --> 17:50.400]  you see everything is just an endless prism an endless kaleidoscope of history and data
[17:50.400 --> 17:56.240]  yeah there it is london telegraph prince charles aired to dracula bloodline yeah he lives there
[17:56.240 --> 18:01.360]  actually more than england now he lives in the dracula castle he actually was bought what is it
[18:01.360 --> 18:06.480]  three castles last time i checked there and one of them is the dracool castle a new castle was built
[18:06.480 --> 18:12.800]  i don't know i think they said 500 years ago in the ruins of the old 2000 year old castle but
[18:12.800 --> 18:22.640]  um that you know vlad moved into when it was already ancient look at the likeness between him
[18:22.640 --> 18:31.120]  and vlad the impaler so that's that that's who they are and and we had a war with these people
[18:31.120 --> 18:36.800]  in 1776 they never been beaten by anybody no one had beaten them not the spanish not the portuguese
[18:36.800 --> 18:45.200]  not the french not the dutch not the austrian hungarian empire uh not uh the russians no one
[18:45.200 --> 18:55.040]  had ever beaten this group of people using the strong folks there in the uk they're in the british
[18:55.040 --> 19:03.520]  aisles and then we beat them and then now you turn the television on and there's 24 7 worship
[19:03.520 --> 19:09.280]  of these people on and on and on and it makes me sick at my stomach now here's some of the
[19:09.280 --> 19:14.960]  articles up on info wars dot com this is exclusive uh footage of the birth of the royal baby it is
[19:14.960 --> 19:19.760]  hilarious satire ladies and gentlemen and if you go to the real alex jones on twitter i may
[19:19.760 --> 19:24.320]  even take it down it may even be distasteful for me but i love to defile royalty because it flies
[19:24.320 --> 19:30.000]  in the face of everything you know individualism should be why uh you're successful not not not
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.720]  some government and you know of armed forces suppressing the people all ladies have their
[19:34.720 --> 19:42.560]  have their power turned off so that uh hundreds of palaces can be heated in the winter that's on
[19:42.560 --> 19:48.400]  record so i showed an exclusive leaked photo of the birth of the royal baby and of course the

[24:05.120 --> 24:08.800]  all right coming up i'm going to give you my in-depth take on
[24:08.800 --> 24:13.120]  the british royal family people say well that's a diversion i thought it's a diversion no i'm
[24:13.120 --> 24:17.920]  going to break down how they've set up the distraction because i i actually have video of this
[24:17.920 --> 24:27.040]  i was driving in and this woman had a big union jack bumper sticker about four times the size of
[24:27.040 --> 24:34.800]  a regular bumper sticker it was probably 10 inches by a 14 inches i mean it was a giant
[24:35.840 --> 24:38.560]  and again i have footage of this but i'm going to upload it in high def
[24:40.320 --> 24:45.040]  and a giant live size queen of england like she's sticking out of the back of the
[24:45.040 --> 24:53.600]  uh the durango or whatever you know dodge vehicle it was suv it's like she's coming
[24:53.600 --> 24:58.560]  out the back window and it's the it's queen elizabeth the second and it and she's holding
[24:58.560 --> 25:04.640]  american flag in her hand so they actually have a little paper flag a little plastic flag attached
[25:04.640 --> 25:12.800]  to her hand and it says long live the queen and almost ran into the lady trying to get up close
[25:12.800 --> 25:19.280]  to her in traffic to get video of it but i'll upload that unbelievable and then just wall to wall
[25:20.400 --> 25:26.240]  disgusting worship just mindless fawning where the reporters are almost laughing
[25:26.240 --> 25:33.920]  they know how ridiculous this is of people in 17th century military outfits being worshiped
[25:34.800 --> 25:41.040]  and then i tweeted uh a satire uh image that i saw on the hike and bike trail this morning
[25:41.040 --> 25:45.360]  was one of those things about this is a dog pooping station so i took a photo of it
[25:45.360 --> 25:50.720]  and said you know exclusive photo of the birth of the baby as a joke and there's people commenting
[25:51.440 --> 25:58.800]  on there going you're just jealous that that you don't have the the same pedigree so i thought
[25:58.800 --> 26:05.200]  it was funny it says utilize mutt mitt stations and my whole point is who says these people are
[26:05.200 --> 26:12.720]  the elitists and we're the scum they're so inbred that most of queen elizabeth the second sisters
[26:12.720 --> 26:19.600]  got locked up in mental institutions look it up i mean just totally inbred raving loons
[26:21.280 --> 26:25.120]  absolute mental illness that's well known that most of the egyptian
[26:25.760 --> 26:32.640]  pharaohs died at about age 15 this ruler died at nine this ruler died at seven this ruler died at
[26:32.640 --> 26:38.800]  19 this ruler was long lived and lived at 25 meanwhile the local villagers would live to be
[26:38.800 --> 26:47.360]  60 70 80 90 100 years old oh that's real elitists now you take over kim jong un's grandfather
[26:47.360 --> 26:53.760]  takes over north korea and then you become the king you become the ruler see i'm already i said
[26:53.760 --> 26:56.960]  i'd go to your phone calls i'm gonna go to your phone calls and then i'll get into all this and
[26:56.960 --> 27:02.720]  paul watson has a great video up comparing the british royalty to the worship of kim jong ill when
[27:02.720 --> 27:09.360]  he died i mean it is just as mindless and it's a peer pressure thing exclusive footage of birth
[27:09.360 --> 27:14.800]  of royal baby incredible satire up on info wars dot com right now please make this go viral uh let's
[27:14.800 --> 27:22.880]  go ahead and go to denise in minnesota you're on the air thanks for holding hi um listen i just
[27:22.880 --> 27:32.320]  wanted to make a comment um on your sunday show i thought it was one of the best explanations
[27:32.320 --> 27:42.560]  between you and pastor manning of showing how all of the divisiveness that's happened with
[27:43.600 --> 27:50.480]  with what's going on right now with the trade on martin case but it you can go back and they do this
[27:50.480 --> 27:56.480]  to everything and everybody they've done it to the native americans they've done it to the blacks
[27:56.480 --> 28:01.680]  they're doing it now to the whites they're done it to the muslims they've done it to the jews
[28:02.240 --> 28:09.040]  is and it and to me it's all about nobody is an individual that's right the globalists do not
[28:09.040 --> 28:13.680]  want you to be an individual they want you to be about your race or your sexual preference
[28:13.680 --> 28:18.960]  or whatever and obsess on that all day instead of what art do you produce what literature what do you
[28:18.960 --> 28:24.160]  stand for i saw guys on the hiking bike trail yesterday volunteering on a big gully to dig a
[28:24.160 --> 28:31.520]  ditch to divert the water and i thought man what a valuable thing on their own going out and volunteering
[28:31.520 --> 28:37.760]  to do a good work like that how satisfying it is to improve things and build things and do things
[28:37.760 --> 28:43.360]  and the average yuppie just like no no no i get ahead by only caring about myself but when everybody
[28:43.360 --> 28:48.400]  truly volunteers as individuals to do the right thing it builds an incredible culture
[28:48.400 --> 28:56.000]  but when we say oh the government handles it it creates a nightmare oh absolutely and i mean
[28:56.000 --> 29:04.560]  and isn't that sad isn't it sad what they've done to everybody and everything well it's it's
[29:04.560 --> 29:10.240]  codel divide and conquer where people think it's like a football game black versus white or whatever
[29:10.240 --> 29:16.640]  to turn on the news and all it's about is a dead teenager which is a sad story but
[29:16.640 --> 29:22.240]  they take that individual and then make it all about that to again create the division but actor
[29:22.240 --> 29:28.400]  james woods put out the tweet saying you know why isn't obama concerned about other dead teenagers
[29:28.400 --> 29:36.080]  like like the wounded warriors and people the the veterans no no it's only about this so that he
[29:36.080 --> 29:42.480]  can appease her race politics so that it's all about oh look i give you race politics i don't
[29:42.480 --> 29:46.800]  give you jobs i don't give you dignity i don't give you a future i'm shutting down your power

[33:29.840 --> 33:34.800]  if you want to know why we're becoming slaves and losing every basic liberty it's because we value
[33:36.240 --> 33:44.880]  tripe we value fluff we value soap opera culture drama queen culture oh it's the old timers that
[33:44.880 --> 33:50.320]  didn't trust the government they were stupid oh really they were stupid no we've been stupid and
[33:50.320 --> 33:57.680]  if you know how hard the great people of the uk uh and the great people uh you know of the subgroups
[33:57.680 --> 34:07.680]  of the united kingdom how hard the irish and the scots and the welch and all the people of those
[34:07.680 --> 34:14.080]  aisles fought against the norman invaders and then those bloodlines died out and they brought over
[34:14.080 --> 34:24.800]  the transylvanian crew about 270 years ago or so if you realize that our ancestors anybody who has
[34:24.800 --> 34:31.600]  a name like jones or anybody that has a name like chapman i mean one of the most common names a group
[34:31.600 --> 34:37.600]  of names are english names and and scottish names and irish names in this country our ancestors all
[34:37.600 --> 34:44.560]  of us our ancestors killed in mash by british royalty who were not british royalty i mean
[34:44.560 --> 34:50.480]  everybody knew these were conquerors everyone hated them everyone cursed them for for over a
[34:50.480 --> 34:57.200]  thousand years and they fought and would behead kings and try to get liberty and magna carta and
[34:57.200 --> 35:06.880]  the first thing the first thing that tony blare did in 1996 when he got elected and the bbc was the
[35:06.880 --> 35:13.280]  headline tony blare my goal is to abolish magna carta well you got to search that tony blare i
[35:13.280 --> 35:22.640]  will abolish magna carta that was the headline bbc folks magna carta conservatively conservatively
[35:22.640 --> 35:31.760]  hundreds of thousands of people died just in a off and on again decade long group of wars
[35:31.760 --> 35:37.440]  to give you magna carta i mean you think the government's out of control now folks that's
[35:37.440 --> 35:44.880]  where due process private property rights warrants uh jurisdictions all of it comes out of that and
[35:44.880 --> 35:54.080]  imagine imagine tony blare declaring war on your freedom at the direction of the queen of england
[35:54.960 --> 35:58.800]  because the queen speech she gives her speech and then that's the directive of the prime minister
[35:58.800 --> 36:06.000]  she wanted magna carta gone the queen of england shooting her fat mouth off her son running around
[36:06.000 --> 36:10.800]  calling for deindustrialization of the british isles calling for the deindustrialization of
[36:10.800 --> 36:17.200]  our country while his holdings have moved to china watch and put it in his video where they
[36:17.200 --> 36:24.000]  admitted that old people would would get on buses all night for the bus fare to have heat because
[36:24.000 --> 36:28.960]  their their gas allotment was turned off and it turned out the queen of england was heating over
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.280]  a hundred palaces with no one in them with a welfare gas allotment
[36:37.680 --> 36:41.520]  and then blare puts out all this double speak about how he would abolish the monarchy
[36:41.520 --> 36:47.440]  if backbenchers called for it so then conservatives see that as a eu globalist attack
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.520]  because it's true about all they've gotten left as a british culture is the monarchy
[36:51.520 --> 36:58.640]  and even that is alien and there's the queen of england and others working with the globalist to get
[36:58.640 --> 37:06.320]  rid of uk independence while the uk independence people defend the monarchy and and i even get the
[37:06.320 --> 37:14.000]  perspective because it's it's the only culture they've got you can't even have the uk flag out
[37:14.000 --> 37:21.680]  what is it the uh king george flag it's the white one with the red cross that's considered racist
[37:21.680 --> 37:28.880]  in england that's the anti sovereignty movement is so strong that in the media and in watson's
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.920]  talked about this if you fly that at your house the police will come to your door and say what are
[37:33.920 --> 37:40.880]  you doing flying that flag i mean this is how insane it is so so so my indictment of the british
[37:40.880 --> 37:48.960]  monarchy is an indictment because the system is fawning over something that is alien to the people
[37:48.960 --> 37:54.320]  being in charge we are the sovereign we are above the government the law comes from us and we have
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.520]  the right to abolish the government it becomes destructive of the declaration of independence
[37:59.520 --> 38:05.360]  read the declaration of independence and then i read articles where oh british scholars come to
[38:05.360 --> 38:10.000]  the universities and call for the abolishment of the declaration of independence and say that it
[38:10.000 --> 38:15.200]  should be made illegal type that in that's bbc should the declaration of independence be illegal
[38:15.200 --> 38:22.320]  that was last year articles in the philadelphia daily news and in the new york times and and
[38:22.320 --> 38:29.360]  the bbc let's abolish the declaration of independence because it talks ill of king
[38:29.360 --> 38:36.080]  george the third and then i saw a woman with the queen of england on her car today a big giant cut
[38:36.080 --> 38:43.760]  out of it saying god bless our queen or god save our queen i've got video of it yeah there it is
[38:43.760 --> 38:49.520]  the deck u.s declaration of independence illegal and then it's got feds arguing in the u.s that yes
[38:49.520 --> 38:56.880]  it's an anti-government document because it says we are the masters not some government god like
[38:56.880 --> 39:02.880]  obama not some government god like kim jong un a third generation royalty in north korea
[39:02.880 --> 39:09.520]  i mean we look at kim jong un and and all of his ridiculous outfits and laugh at him i mean the
[39:09.520 --> 39:16.080]  queen of england's outfits and prince william's outfits and prince harry's outfits and prince
[39:16.080 --> 39:22.800]  charles's outfits and all of the and the duchess of this and the duke of that i mean i'm about to
[39:22.800 --> 39:31.280]  vomit all over myself and the fawning simpering after this makes me want to throw up and if you
[39:31.280 --> 39:37.680]  look at edward bernay's the father of modern propaganda who ran so many he ran the feminist
[39:37.680 --> 39:41.120]  movement he wrote three books on it one of his propaganda i've read all three
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.120]  the books are free online by the way you can find the text of him online and this is stuff
[39:47.120 --> 39:52.000]  written in the 20s and 30s and 40s he ran the department of war psi ops and he said let's not
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.520]  call it war let's not be honest let's call it the department of defense because war is peace
[39:57.520 --> 40:05.760]  and bernay's went on to say in the 20s we're going to merge hollywood with these big newsreel
[40:05.760 --> 40:11.520]  filmed and radio broadcast events with hollywood as soon as the talkies got popular the talking
[40:11.520 --> 40:18.720]  movies with the politicians to make them royal and bring in red carpets and and and and bring
[40:18.720 --> 40:25.520]  in all these extra guards to make it like royalty so that the people feel small and he talked about
[40:25.520 --> 40:29.360]  you know this has been known for thousands of years the government building must be the biggest
[40:29.360 --> 40:34.080]  and most imposing to make the public feel small and powerless this is all part of the projection
[40:34.080 --> 40:40.400]  of power but we must merge that into a love and the people will love their servitude all this
[40:40.400 --> 40:45.040]  huxley wrote about this and brave new world revisited the non-fiction book and talked about
[40:45.040 --> 40:52.240]  it and they sit there laughing at you i mean you've got people that billions and billions of pounds
[40:52.240 --> 41:01.200]  of money i think in u.s. numbers something like six billion dollars a year spent on the royal family
[41:01.760 --> 41:06.000]  they have allowances of hundreds of millions of pounds of peace they have their own trains
[41:06.640 --> 41:14.880]  a fleet of more than 50 aircraft last time i checked wide body to jumbo jets uh ocean liners
[41:14.880 --> 41:23.920]  personally jet copters prince charles has over a hundred palaces and folks when i say a palace
[41:24.560 --> 41:32.320]  i mean huge sprawling compounds that have patronage royal patronage where you'll have
[41:32.320 --> 41:36.480]  hundreds of square miles that are a palace that are the palace grounds where they grow their own
[41:36.480 --> 41:42.000]  organic food they have their own people living there like peasants this is in documentaries
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.640]  about it who get to eat non-gmo and and and they're in their own little fortified
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.920]  they always say the queen of england has no power but then she doesn't allow billboards on
[41:53.920 --> 41:59.360]  her right of way that's why you don't see billboards in the uk she randomly exercises power and shuts
[41:59.360 --> 42:03.120]  down major roads in london every day and sometimes shuts down major rivers
[42:03.120 --> 42:13.360]  to exercise her power she owns more than half the land in canada more than a third of the land in
[42:13.360 --> 42:20.640]  australia and new zealand these places never got out from under them every time they vote to do
[42:20.640 --> 42:28.320]  something she doesn't want the governor general suspends parliament suspends the legislatures and
[42:28.320 --> 42:35.360]  then restacks the deck and then canadiens and australians go how dare you say the queen runs
[42:35.360 --> 42:41.200]  things that's not true because they don't want to be told that kind of like the national security
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.680]  council runs things here doesn't matter what congress does that they do whatever they want
[42:45.680 --> 42:50.800]  we are a conquered people and we're becoming more conquered every day the chains are getting heavier
[42:50.800 --> 42:55.760]  the ball and chains are getting bigger we have to reverse this now and when i watch the simpering
[42:55.760 --> 43:02.160]  oh it's incredible in fact i even have video of it in royal baby gender leaked it's a parasite
[43:02.160 --> 43:08.000]  a joke video i did but it has real msnbc audio that i shot this morning off and on my commentary
[43:08.000 --> 43:14.480]  as she's going oh it's incredible the magic letter will soon be sent by a courier or some of the
[43:14.480 --> 43:20.080]  royal staff and then she's sycophantic like we'll be taken and we'll learn the gender and the great
[43:20.080 --> 43:26.880]  part about royalty now is if it's a baby girl she will be the queen she will not be passed over by a
[43:26.880 --> 43:33.280]  later male heir this makes it so progressive and it's why the people of england 76 love it
[43:34.480 --> 43:44.320]  now the institution of royalty hereditary fiefdom paid for by the people a giant parasite
[43:44.320 --> 43:49.280]  announcing prince charles fill up all of them that you shouldn't be able to take a hot bath you
[43:49.280 --> 43:57.120]  can search that prince charles says don't take a hot bath this is a guy who has giant private diesel
[43:57.120 --> 44:04.000]  trains huge jet copters wide-body jet aircraft and he's like i believe you should not take a
[44:04.000 --> 44:10.800]  hot bath we need a tax on the bath heating of the water is not proper and contributes to the carbon
[44:10.800 --> 44:20.000]  footprint love your servitude love your intention servitude obama you can't have you can't have a
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.640]  hot bath you can't have a car you can't have air conditioning in africa because it'll hurt the earth
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.200]  while they're suppressing all the real technologies and then coming out with big boondoggles that don't
[44:29.200 --> 44:35.600]  even get built to their friends they always create a counterfeit and so this cult of obama where
[44:35.600 --> 44:40.560]  they're where most polls and i've talked to britz i'd say about half of them support the monarchy
[44:40.560 --> 44:45.920]  or under peer pressure they feel like it the media puts out fake polls of 76 to 80 to create a fake
[44:48.880 --> 44:57.520]  unity or or or kind of a a a fake consensus and it's the same thing with obama he's the
[44:57.520 --> 45:01.760]  royalty he's the new christ he's going to save everyone he's going to give you milk and honey
[45:01.760 --> 45:05.440]  he's going to give you free houses free cars free health care and it doesn't matter if he raises
[45:05.440 --> 45:10.720]  payroll taxes on the poorest america doesn't matter if it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions and
[45:10.720 --> 45:15.040]  it's a giant ripoff written by foreign banks it doesn't matter if it has death panels it doesn't
[45:15.040 --> 45:20.720]  matter because you've already bought into the con game oh the queen oh look everyone's loving it it
[45:20.720 --> 45:27.520]  is the emperors new clothes these people are butt naked tyrants nakedly exercising parasitic
[45:27.520 --> 45:32.480]  activities and then but they have all the media what's going to be ether on the menu they're going
[45:32.480 --> 45:39.600]  to have a nice pea soup and they're going to just thawning sycophantically hour after hour day after
[45:39.600 --> 45:47.600]  day with people dressed up in Walt disney outfits shitting there when these are people on record
[45:47.600 --> 45:52.880]  that funded hitler so they could then destroy him and openly funded knocking off their cousins the
[45:52.880 --> 46:02.800]  zars to put the communist in ten times worse i mean these people are the hereditary greatest
[46:02.800 --> 46:12.400]  mass murderers the world has ever seen and my country is such in such a coma and under all this
[46:12.400 --> 46:19.760]  glitz oh my gosh the queen the queen and women on the street what do you think of it i just love
[46:19.760 --> 46:28.640]  the queen and i just love the the princess while old people freeze in their homes freeze to death
[46:28.640 --> 46:37.280]  in some cases on record because the government says we're cutting off your gas allotment unbelievable
[46:37.280 --> 46:42.800]  barbarism all right i'm done i said i'd go to your calls Matthew in texas you're on the air welcome
[46:42.800 --> 46:50.240]  hey how's it going alex good sir well welcome worldwide broadcast welcome yeah thank you i'm
[46:50.240 --> 46:54.800]  a huge listener i'm in austin texas i want to first i'll say thank you for fighting a good fight
[46:55.360 --> 47:00.000]  and uh my question to you is what do you think about this whole thing it's houston with the police
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.760]  chief uh tell them those uh anti protesters in the the trevon martin thing not to show up with
[47:07.760 --> 47:12.560]  their guns if you've heard anything about that yes i saw that uh in the news this morning i meant to
[47:12.560 --> 47:15.760]  tell the crew it may have been a stack i didn't look at this morning because i got here late
[47:15.760 --> 47:20.320]  well i got here early but i had to meet with the newspaper on the latest issue guys will you print
[47:20.320 --> 47:26.320]  me houston police chief says don't bring your guns uh yes i saw that and again you have a right to
[47:26.320 --> 47:30.480]  have your guns openly as long as you're not threatening with them just like a cop isn't
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.800]  allowed to threaten you uh for no reason with a gun that happened in tucson where the cops come in
[47:34.800 --> 47:39.520]  and one of them just pulls a gun on the attendant for no reason just to menace him and you know be
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.560]  on a power trip that cop's been rightfully fired and he should be prosecuted for a
[47:44.560 --> 47:49.920]  terroristic threat and brandishing a weapon but as long as you're there with your weapon sling
[47:49.920 --> 47:55.840]  that is the right of a free man uh and you know i don't particularly like the counter protest
[47:56.400 --> 48:00.400]  to the new black panther party and people it's your right to do it because i think it adds power
[48:00.400 --> 48:06.320]  to it it stirs it up more when this is all a scyop but then you've almost got a march armed
[48:06.320 --> 48:12.640]  armed uh down in houston if they try to uh by fiat you know say don't bring your guns well why is
[48:12.640 --> 48:16.880]  the new black panther party i mean i don't agree with a lot of the racist stuff they spew but i've
[48:16.880 --> 48:24.240]  said good job for them they've marched armed with shotguns many times uh in houston and and look i mean
[48:24.240 --> 48:30.720]  you look the klan has a right to march with shotguns the the new black panther uh black klan has a right
[48:30.720 --> 48:36.880]  the uh mecha laroc lari conquista as as long as their u.s citizens have a right to march armed
[48:36.880 --> 48:42.800]  if they're not it's then insurrection uh but the police chief does not have a monopoly on this
[48:42.800 --> 48:48.480]  i think it's disgusting what do you say yeah i think it's absolutely terrible and i don't think he
[48:48.480 --> 48:54.240]  has a right to even make uh uh make an opinion about this just like president obama didn't have
[48:54.240 --> 49:00.320]  a right to uh talk about the case to begin with i i've never heard from president and tell me if
[49:00.320 --> 49:12.160]  i'm wrong alex that it's commented so strongly on a criminal case well i tell you uh yes sir they
[49:12.160 --> 49:17.840]  were popping in my ear saying they had the article but go ahead yeah but i just i mean there's there's
[49:17.840 --> 49:23.040]  there's no uh i've never heard of a president and and i listened to mpr i made the mistake of
[49:23.040 --> 49:27.600]  listening to mpr later that day after all this came out and you should have heard some of the
[49:27.600 --> 49:32.080]  terrible things there say they're saying well president obama finally played his black card
[49:32.080 --> 49:37.680]  he played his brother card he's a proud brother now i mean that's not the point of being a president
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.680]  there's supposed to be a certain level of impartiality that's that's my whole point
[49:44.080 --> 49:49.360]  well sir uh again uh the whole thing is a divide and conquer situation i appreciate your call
[49:49.920 --> 49:54.320]  uh let's go ahead and talk to jonathan in new york you're on the air but he's calling in on the
[49:54.320 --> 50:02.480]  same subject go ahead thank you alex i wanted to get clarity from you about the definition of
[50:02.480 --> 50:09.600]  liberty because i'm looking it up on the website dictionary and to fight this info war it's i'm
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.920]  finding that it's very difficult to transcend to people especially i live in new york city
[50:15.040 --> 50:21.120]  there are so many people who believe that uh the first of all the definition of liberty
[50:21.120 --> 50:27.840]  broadly is the quality of uh worst state of being free they believe being free means to be on
[50:28.560 --> 50:36.320]  government aid uh to yeah they mean being free is being disempowered jellyfish i mean if i take
[50:36.320 --> 50:42.960]  off a day to take my kids fishing or camping i'm having fun with them but i can't quit thinking
[50:42.960 --> 50:48.640]  about all the things that are going on and all the things i want to do stay there i'm going to
[50:48.640 --> 50:52.720]  come back to you to finish up your point jonathan i think this is important yeah what is the definition
[50:52.720 --> 50:57.280]  of freedom what is the definition of being free what's the definition of liberty we'll be right back

[56:23.040 --> 56:27.280]  here i mean all i can say about what's happening in houston and other places
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.280]  where you've got people white people in hispanics yelling at black people
[56:32.160 --> 56:38.480]  this is exactly what the new world order wants and it's just beautifully played against people
[56:38.480 --> 56:42.720]  you want to know why we're losing our rights why we're becoming poor because more and more
[56:42.720 --> 56:48.880]  we're a nation of morons not all of us but there's a large group of morons out there
[56:50.720 --> 56:55.360]  who just want to fight with each other and if they could just beat the white people they would
[56:55.360 --> 57:01.760]  be successful or if they could just beat the black people they'd be successful or if this was just
[57:01.760 --> 57:06.720]  mexico because texas used to belong to mexico along with five other countries and groups you know
[57:06.720 --> 57:12.480]  the french and everybody else why mexico wouldn't be poor no if mexico ever had independence and
[57:12.480 --> 57:17.520]  ever had real private property and wasn't run by strong men they would be freer we're becoming
[57:17.520 --> 57:22.560]  like mexico we're becoming more like north korea not like what made us great not that america's
[57:22.560 --> 57:28.400]  ever been perfect i'm sorry call or finish your point jonathan go ahead and so what alex i just
[57:28.400 --> 57:37.680]  think that uh liberty is a double-edged sword just as everybody uh you know you have ms mdc
[57:37.680 --> 57:46.240]  talking their racial uh stuff uh how do you defeat the new world order the globalist syndicate
[57:46.800 --> 57:52.800]  with this idea of liberty doing whatever and saying whatever you get to say
[57:52.800 --> 57:59.680]  uh when you have a positive message but then it could also be seen that they also have a positive
[57:59.680 --> 58:04.800]  message to the people in the masses because the way i see it is the liberty is a double-edged sword
[58:05.360 --> 58:10.640]  if ms mdc is talking about their race war and you tell them stop talking about that
[58:10.640 --> 58:16.000]  they're going to throw back at you well alex uh we have a right to say whatever we want to say
[58:16.880 --> 58:20.800]  and then you get to then you'll say the same thing once they and you do when
[58:20.800 --> 58:26.240]  uh they're blocking whatever you're saying so i don't understand how to defeat this
[58:26.800 --> 58:33.520]  global syndicate if liberty is a double-edged sword well well it is and people buy into
[58:33.520 --> 58:37.600]  the fraud too that liberty means the government takes care of them when really they're being
[58:37.600 --> 58:51.440]  turned into slaves this is gcn the genesis communications radio network protecting your
[58:51.440 --> 58:56.000]  home with a security system is a must but when it comes to protecting your family your home and

[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:32.720]  all right folks we're gonna talk to larry elder talk show host rider who i think is really eloquently
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:40.400]  been exposing the incredible division being pushed by the so-called liberals
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:46.720]  all they can offer is racial infighting because that's all they've got while they work for foreign
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:52.320]  banks looting us basically i'm also going to continue breaking down this disgusting media frenzy
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:59.280]  over the royal birth and hey they could be a queen it could be a king oh this is the antithesis
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:05.440]  of what this country was founded on this is kryptonite to superman to the america superman
[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:17.280]  this royal fawning is kryptonite worshiping royalty is the opposite of what america was founded on
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.520]  it is kryptonite to superman trying to give a good tweet
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:32.560]  if america is superman worshiping royals is kryptonite does that make sense
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:39.520]  it's it's just it's everything our ancestors struggled against it's it's but now government's
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.280]  the new royalty with diplomatic immunity above the law we're going to get into all of that
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:48.000]  and we'll have open phones in the third hour as well and i'm very close to getting one of the main
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:55.840]  new black panther leaders on the show to again cover this big distraction but but wake people up
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.960]  the only way the last caller was saying how do we get people out of this infighting and out of this
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:07.600]  divide and conquer i think you hijack the meme you culture jam it and then you show people you
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.320]  cover it because you've got to cover it and nobody's going to listen and you take whatever the big
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:19.040]  enchilada is of the day the big diversion the royal family uh the trayvon martin stuff and then
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:24.480]  you point out how it's a distraction and then show people what they're not being shown and i know
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:28.640]  that's elementary you're like tell us something we don't know that's when i'm trying to get my crew
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:34.240]  to do and they're doing a great job by the way because hindsight's 2020 backseat quarterbacking
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:40.720]  money due quarterbacking my crew does an amazing job i don't put one tenth of what i know into form
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.360]  into action that's what i'm trying to do here and i'm really trying to unlock minds i just want freedom
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:54.160]  i have goodwill and that is the antidote to the globalist poison uh margaret in florida thanks
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:03:04.240]  for holding your on the air worldwide hi um alex i uh you told us on the air that you had a shack
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:13.120]  for your family to bug out to and i have a cabin on ten acres and i was wondering uh your thoughts
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:20.960]  um when to bug out uh what are we looking for well i mean i have a couple places i can go
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.960]  family property and stuff that's got old farmhouses and stuff on it that i go to anyways to go wild
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:33.040]  hog hunting or fishing or or camping or you know riding four wheelers or letting the kids ride around
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:40.960]  on the tractor uh but i mean that's if if we ever go into a great depression and stuff really
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:48.000]  collapses bad i've got storable food farm tools and and gardens and a little great vineyard and
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.960]  things that are already going that i could go to i've got a couple different places with family
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:59.520]  that lives on family you know family partnership property uh so i have one foot in an agrarian
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:06.960]  past uh plus i might have to you know bug out if it ever gets to the point of they shut down my
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:14.640]  media operation uh and you know basically they're arresting patriot leaders i i i won't particularly
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:19.200]  run myself but i'll i'll you know put my family out in the country and it's no secret where they'll
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:27.440]  be it's just out of the way uh i mean here's an example if we had a reactor blow up in california
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:35.120]  like they had in in in in uh japan i would have to leave the us for a couple years because i don't
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.400]  want my kids getting radiated uh so so it's just always good to have that backup does that answer

[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.720]  states also the mainstream media is finally beginning to report on russian combat readiness
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.760]  after the alternative news broke the fact that israel struck russian military sites in syria
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.840]  a few weeks ago major escalation on that front you know why have i been critical of this uh
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.880]  worship of british royalty well a they're not even british but b it's the antithesis of the
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.720]  american system that we worship people because of title or royalty it's about what you stand for
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.760]  who you are what you build what you write what you produce what inventions you make where you
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:46.720]  trailblaze and i'm all about being an individual and i admire people that are honorable and well
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:52.000]  spoken and intelligent and that are good fathers and that's what we see an attack on the family
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.840]  and an attack on fathers and we have the best-selling author of dear father dear son he's also written
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:01.760]  a bunch of other best-selling books larry elder joining us to the bottom of the hour them will

[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.600]  on everything the former head of the screen actors guild and of course famous famous actor
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.320]  in his own right but that is coming up then totally open phones and more news in the third hour but
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.160]  i saw this clip last week and i said please get larry elder he was on everybody's favorite red
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.600]  cup he was on the pierce morgan show and really let him have it it's an amazing 11 minute video
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:32.400]  that's up on info wars dot com it's also on larry elder dot com but let's go ahead and play about a
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.400]  minute of the opening exchange right here with larry elder i was because you weren't doing her any
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:42.800]  favors by condescendingly trying to convince her that she's a victim this is a young lady
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.840]  uh who didn't apply herself a 19 year old who's still in high school instead of saying young lady
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:52.000]  take this as an opportunity to take stock of your life you treated her like she was a victim
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.480]  and that's how you're doing this whole thing about race and racism 7 000 murders last year
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.200]  pierce of black people almost all of those were committed by black people since trayvon martin
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:07.120]  has his unfortunate death there have been 480 blacks killed in chicago alone 75 percent of
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.600]  those crimes have been unsolved where are the cameras where are the shows it's outrageous to
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:16.800]  act as if black america larry black america should fear some non-black guys stalking some black
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:23.600]  kid uh at night the likelihood of a black person being killed uh by an by a non-black person uh
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.680]  is extremely remote which is why this became a big national issue in the first place pierce
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:34.160]  right it's perfectly possible as we have shown us many times and again 94 percent just department
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:40.080]  numbers black on black and it's like they found an easter bunny or a leprechaun or a pot of gold
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.480]  or the unicorn you know the mythical creature the racist white person and i know there's
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:50.640]  racist white people i don't run into a lot of them when you run into them they're big losers folks
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:56.800]  that their whole identity is about race and that's why they're usually failures winners want to be
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.800]  around winners and that's why royalty disgust me obama's the new royalty because of what color
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:07.520]  he is he can do no wrong uh it's the same thing with these british royals what have they done
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:12.320]  but lecture me about carbon all day i don't like obama and i don't like the queen of england
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:17.200]  either larry elder do you get where i'm coming from with that of course i do and and alex i gave
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:22.320]  him facts it is an unfortunate fact that blacks are 12 of the population you throw out the women
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.920]  you're talking about six percent throughout old people and young people you're talking about three
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:31.760]  percent out of three percent come half of all homicides this is why people profile i'm not mad
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.320]  at people for profiling i'm mad at the young thug who's messed up my image and the reason the young
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.120]  thug is there is because the young thug grew up in a home without a father 75 percent of black
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:45.600]  kids born in homes without a father at some point 85 percent of black kids will be in a home without
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:51.360]  a dad obama knows that he gave a speech alex at more house he said a kid growing up without a dad
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.920]  is five times more likely to be poor nine times more likely to drop out of high school 20 times
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:59.760]  more likely to end up in prison so what are we talking about here they take some aberrant case
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:03.760]  and they act as if this is some referendum on america it is as ridiculous as what happened in
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.320]  sandy cook sandy hook and pierce morgan wanted to make some pink cheek white kid the face of gun
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:13.600]  violence in america absolutely it's the same deal it's like guilting everyone all gun owners you
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:19.040]  killed the kids they said that and now all whites you want to corner the little black kid murdering
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.080]  alex it's misdirection because the real problem is what the left has done to the family between 1890
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.800]  1940 look it up in the census reports a black kid was more likely to be born in the nuclear intact
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:33.760]  family than a white kid along from linden johnson he incentivizes all these intercity people into
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:37.520]  getting money provided there's no man in the house and allows the woman to marry the government and
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.440]  allows the man to abandon his financially more responsibility and now fast forward talking
[01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:46.400]  about race and racism and high-capacity magazines it's absurd sure well the bible says and it's
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:50.800]  got historical examples because the israelites were very learned so they wrote down what happened
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:55.680]  and the more stuff they dig up the more they find out how accurate the old testament and new testament
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:01.200]  is historically the things that really went on they knew when a society's about to collapse women
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:06.320]  are put in as the boss and and i'm not knocking women it's just a fact the government has done
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:13.600]  that fake feminism all of this uh the women are slaves to the government uh what happened what
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.920]  happened because i've seen the same numbers you're talking about where illegitimacy in blacks
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:23.840]  was lower than it was in whites crime was lower than whites how did this happen well what two
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.720]  things happen again uh women were incentivized into getting money from the government provided
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.200]  there was no man and the civil rights movement went from demanding equal rights to demanding
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.000]  equal results this way you get these race hustlers like alstropin and jesse jackson demanding this
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.720]  and demanding that equal rights and equal results are two different things equal rights are one thing
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.800]  that everybody is entitled to equal results are things you have to work for and earn and that's
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:56.720]  what happened why do you think the media is desperately pushing this and and am i wrong
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:59.840]  in saying you're a little bit older than i am and you've been a syndicated radio host for
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:05.680]  several decades and you know follow the news continually am i right in saying this is pulling
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:10.880]  out all the stops that we've never seen race baiting at this level a and then b why are they
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.800]  doing it well we've seen race baiting before but what's bizarre about it is one would have thought
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.640]  that it would have been diminished by now we've elected a black president we reelected a black
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:23.360]  president obama got more of the white vote than john carrey did so one would have thought that
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.480]  uh people would have would have perceived that to be a statement about how uh relatively race
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.520]  free consciousness country is instead this is another in a continuing series of race hustlers
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:38.160]  to want to brawley was a race hustle jenna sixth was a race hustle the duke lacrosse thing was a
[01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.720]  race hustle when years ago us a today ran all those cover stories about black churches being
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:47.440]  burnt we found out uh when all the dust settled part of the expression that more churches mosque
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:51.840]  and synagogue were burned in than black churches in usa they had to apologize this is another in
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.720]  the continuing series the mantra white people are after black people black people are under siege
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:00.560]  when in fact if you ask black people what's really going on far and away they're concerned about
[01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:05.440]  what i said before about crime violence bad schools uh the fact is that one out of two black
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:09.280]  adults does not have a full-time job these are the things that are concerning us and this is
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.960]  misdirection and take our attention off of all these things and look on nonsense because the
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:19.280]  left can't come to terms with the damage that they have done how do you reverse it because i
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.600]  genuinely uh want to empower everybody i don't want to pay for all these private prisons i
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:31.840]  don't want to see the culture degenerating across the board i mean for those of us that want good
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:39.840]  will in the face of conscious racepaders like pierce morgan and michelle madow and uh all those
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:46.480]  guys i mean they know what they're doing divide and conquer how do we respond to the people this
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:51.120]  vicious well alice we we do what we're doing we do what you're doing you're fighting back the fact
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:57.040]  is that i call it the uh the access of indoctrination hollywood academia in the media and every day you
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:00.880]  get up in the morning you were infused with all of this stuff you cut on your local news and you
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.720]  hear about how press black people are you can you go to go to the theater you read about you
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.080]  watch a movie called hurricane a movie about a lie based upon uh somebody who murdered three people
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.720]  and suddenly denzel washington is a hero uh even though he murdered three people in the real life
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:19.840]  this is the kind of crap the kids are subjected to every single day the media overwhelmingly
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.600]  left wing academia overwhelmingly left wing hollywood eighty to ninety percent of the
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.040]  money that they give to political cancer contributions goes to the democratic party so this
[01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:31.680]  is what we're up against you are fighting it i'm fighting it uh people have to wake up they've
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:35.920]  got to realize that right now at all three levels of government federal state and local
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:40.000]  they're taking away half of the american people's money in 1900 federal state and local they took
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.720]  about seven percent this is outrageous the founding fathers will be spinning in their graves we need
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:52.240]  to reverse this absolutely uh looking at this uh what do you really in your gut expect to happen
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:58.000]  now because it really seems the media is trying to stir up a race war uh and and i don't see it
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.840]  working too well but they don't care they just keep doing it i think it's backfiring i think this
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:06.480]  might do it uh alsharp then people are taking a look at him this is the guy who every night rails
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:10.880]  and rails and rails about why rich people are be paying more taxes oh millions of dollars in back
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.240]  taxes federal state payroll taxes this is the guy who got involved uh in the ground heights thing
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.160]  some people in new york call it the most serious pogrom in the history of america he was right in
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:24.000]  the thick of that and of course his whole career was based upon to want to brawley i'm thinking
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.920]  and i'm hoping that maybe nbc might be going to take a look at him there's got to be a lot of
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:32.480]  uh negative letters i saw a poll that shows george zerman has higher ratings than alsharp
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:38.160]  then i mean i think that's it more than race spading it's about these people becoming celebrities
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:45.200]  and and and their celebrities pimping the race and it's a disgusting spectacle well it really is
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:51.120]  and i i call sharp and uh reverend j edgar sharp then because along with j agarhoover you you look
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:56.160]  at the guy still in power all these years you wonder why uh and it's through manipulation
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.000]  uh and intimidation and that's what sharpen does so go to a corporation yell and scream
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:03.760]  uh he'll imply he'll bring a whole bunch of black people there uh to take it if you don't give me
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:07.600]  this deal next thing you know the money's past hands there's a book called shakedown written
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.920]  by a journalist named ken terriman who talks about how jesse jackson does this i interviewed
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.920]  terriman on my show he couldn't get arrested on any of the other major shows because they're all in
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:21.520]  bed absolutely and a lot of the republicans i'll be honest like to play along with this and not
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:26.880]  really go after it because that then scares their constituents and and you know makes it racially
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:31.840]  based on top of it i say we just circumvent the whole thing and expose it as you're doing
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.280]  as the political football uh that it's basically become i want i want to go to break and come back

[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:23.840]  who wants freedom and and it's so clear what's happening here the government wants dependency
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:29.520]  it wants a group under its control that's why nbc edited the zimmerman tape 911 call that's why
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:35.840]  they used photos from five six years before of trevon martin that's why the prosecution suppressed
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:42.480]  images of a gun and loot on trevon martin's cell phone uh this is amazing and and and the police
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:48.960]  chief said they wanted him indicted even though that wasn't the facts and it is politically scary
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:54.560]  what do you expect the justice department to do now uh the same folks that run fast and furious larry
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:57.920]  elder they're going to do nothing they're going to hoff and puff and obama is going to give you the
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:01.600]  impression that they're going to be looking at it and of course sharpin wants to keep up the heat
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.640]  but the bottom line is the law does not support bringing charges at all nor do the politics
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.880]  support it the polls show that a plurality of americans are perfectly okay with this not guilty
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:16.400]  verdict by a two-to-one margin they believe uh that uh he's not guilty of manslaughter and by a
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:20.480]  three-to-one margin they believe he's not guilty of murder and so if you really want to route people
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:24.880]  up go ahead and bring charges again and maybe some non-wives might get a little ticked off about
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:29.040]  what's going on so i don't expect anything to happen and uh i'll just say one other thing too
[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:33.840]  obama gave a bunch of anecdotes about how black people are being oppressed in this country if you
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:38.560]  walk by a car you hear a car door lock a woman approaches her purse you're followed in the
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.000]  department store all of those things of course have happened to everybody black black that i know
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.240]  of including me obama however doesn't give other anecdotes i'll give you one i'm in cleveland
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:50.080]  dating a black girl living in the inner city i'm at a park in cleven two o'clock at night we're
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.080]  having a wonderful time in the distance she spots a group of young black men they're coming towards
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.880]  us walking not very fast and sharon says let's go that's what's the problem they don't have any
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.920]  women with them bad sign let's go and we got it when we left now this is an inner city black woman
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:12.160]  this is what she said she did now where's obama was here racist well i couldn't say it as good as you
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:19.920]  just said it um where do you expect this thing to go with the cause celeb which really is an
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:24.720]  why is the establishment so anti-white uh because that's quote the majority and it's a way to beat
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.800]  the majority into going along politically with what the power structure wants i think i think there's
[01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:33.280]  a lot of white guilt uh there's a lot of people that feel noble if they stand up like pierce morgan
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.760]  and puts his hand around some woman and constantly tells her how smart she is it's that thought
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:42.960]  bigotry of low expectations so they build strong men i've actually found a lot of liberals quietly
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:48.160]  are actually the real racist and i think i think that's what it is i think they're i think they're
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:52.800]  racist well here's what it is when you talk to a guy like pierce morgan and he looks at somebody
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:58.480]  like rachel jim tell and says how smart she is this is the kind of condescending attitude that is
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.560]  the basis of race-based preferences the reason that you are allowing blacks and browns to get into
[01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:06.960]  schools not not asians by the way even though they're ethnic minorities is because people really do
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:11.600]  feel that we black people and brown people are too stupid to be able to get really good SATs
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.360]  and the same kind of test scores that everybody else therefore they lower the they lower the bar
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.240]  for us it's a it's a condescending is not racist kind of attitude and that's what george rebert
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.240]  word george w bush meant we talked about the thought bigotry of low expectations what's
[01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.840]  going to happen in the future i would recommend that george durham and change his last name to
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.200]  ben gazi and then the media won't give a damn anymore that's a good idea george ben gazi yeah
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:38.480]  that's it who would we care i don't care man you're a genius i tell you thank you no you just
[01:27:38.480 --> 01:27:44.240]  are funny man it it so so where do you expect this to go we got the two guys shot the parking lot
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.040]  for a free zimmerman thing and i'm seeing all these racial attacks across the country so many
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:55.200]  i can't even cover them now yeah and and and and the media is is totally covering this up because
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.360]  it doesn't fit the narrative and you see three female bodies were found in the bacon house uh
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:04.240]  in cleveland you know i i also say this too uh like we if we had a few more george durham
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.400]  and maybe we'd have a few fewer ariel castros i thought we wanted people to be proactive he'll
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:12.640]  rewrite the book that says it takes a village uh janet napolitano tells us see something say
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:16.560]  something and then you do so and your knuckle dragging race has gone out of profiling so i
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:20.880]  can't figure out what they want well when it's all said and done it looks like a lot of white people
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:27.040]  are going to get killed over this and where is the media on that i mean i agree with you i think
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:33.120]  they've gone a bridge too far i think that even if they're successful stirring up a race war uh
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.480]  that that this is the beginning of the end and i think it's the last gas of of of the big race
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.240]  pimping i think it's still i think it's still going to go on though i think so too and i think
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:45.120]  people are pointing out the hypocrisy the few years ago there was the most brutal
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:52.240]  double homicide i've ever seen in noxial tennessee four black people uh middle the mid 20s uh
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.360]  raped tortured and murdered two young white students in the most graphic heinous thing
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:01.680]  way i've ever heard uh very little coverage and these are the kinds of things people are beginning
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.560]  to to to point out and point out the hot well i mean a black lady grabbed a what a 10 year old
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:11.760]  kid burning to death with a torch for no reason in houston no media coverage and again i'm not even
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.080]  hyping this up because i don't want to create a bunch of division but when it's such hypocrisy
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:22.080]  it it i mean you've got to cover it uh in uh in arizona black guy in a suv with a fiance
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.360]  uh latino on foot crosses in front of him black guy accuses latino of cutting him off they get

[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:02.240]  you try to do that and pool two bigger resources special interest will come in and take it over
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:08.320]  and you can say what you want about the media misrepresenting over the years what ed asner
[01:39:08.320 --> 01:39:13.600]  stands for but i've gotten to know ed asner over the years we just sent one of our crew out there
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:22.480]  to a charity event ed put on to help autistic children autism speaks and ed asner is somebody
[01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:30.320]  across the board uh you know who isn't just the box people put them in i mean if you hear about
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.800]  somebody like martin sheen you want to know pretty well you'll hear oh that's guys a total liberal
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:43.120]  communist and then you actually meeting and he's actually pro-organic anti-vaccine pro-liberty
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:48.800]  on a bunch of fronts and believes that some of the stuff that's pushed by the controlled left
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:54.080]  you know is the answer but but the point is they're not opportunists these are real people
[01:39:54.080 --> 01:40:00.640]  that really care and they will criticize obama for bombing libya and syria and backing al-qaeda
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:06.800]  when the fake right wing won't do it and is backing obama and so that's why i wish i could
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:10.960]  have gone out there but i already had a preset engagement from a month before but ed invited
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:17.520]  me out i sent rob jackson out to the uh celebrity poker event uh all the proceeds went to autism
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:23.120]  research and helping folks and of course he's been the one of the main hosts of mary toller more
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:30.080]  show uh as lou grant hundreds of different movies and tv shows like up that he did the
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:35.040]  voice of one of my favorite good wholesome movies he was president of the screen actors guild
[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:43.040]  and he was uh born in 1929 so he he he has been out there doing a lot of stuff for a long
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:50.560]  time autism speaks just search that and you will pull up uh the official site will put that up on
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:55.120]  screen for everybody but ed spends a lot of his time in fact i know folks that know him most of
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:02.880]  his time a hundred percent giving to charity uh so so truly an amazing guy not trying to kiss his
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:07.440]  hind in here it's just that he's a real humanitarian ed thanks for spending 20 30 minutes with us
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:16.640]  today i'll keep kissing come on come on it feels so good i know but you are a good guy yeah you are
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:22.720]  a good guy too so are we all good guys well at least we try to be i mean that's the difference
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.240]  we can disagree on some things but we are trying to find the truth i think we're trying to have
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:32.800]  justice and i think as long as that's what you're shooting for uh that's the key they don't
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:36.960]  want us to come together on what we agree about they want us divided and conquered and i gotta
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:42.800]  ask you what is your take on the george zimmerman trayvon martin tragedy uh what is your view on
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:50.640]  that that i want to segue into autism uh the wars the nsa all of it with ed asner uh i i did not
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:59.040]  make a deep and intensive study of that whole affair uh but my only feeling is that uh
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:07.600]  uh it is a demonstration of how stupid and backward and weak for his laws are
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:19.600]  that yeah fine he didn't convict him of man slaughter but by god the man did break laws
[01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:28.960]  by his trailing around taking the law into his own hands uh with a loaded weapon in his
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:38.720]  possession i think it exposes florida for its backwardness well i agree that there's two sides
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.520]  of this and i probably wouldn't have been following somebody around uh in you know in the in the
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:50.240]  rain with a gun and and so i think that there is kind of a uh cop want to be angle there some
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:54.080]  people have said oh no he you know he did nothing wrong i don't agree but i agree with jimmy carter
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:01.200]  saying the jury did the right thing because they shot for the premeditated murder instead of a lower
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:05.520]  charge why do you think they went for something they knew they couldn't get most legal analysts say
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:15.760]  well i supposed to uh to be loyal for idiots uh i didn't know that that's what that that they went
[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:23.120]  for the the whole fall of wax uh if that's what they went for then that's wrong they were very wrong
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:27.920]  to a thumbs up yeah i mean most people think they did it on purpose so that he he he he he would get
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:33.280]  off yeah and then it can be used as a political football shifting gears out of that autism we've
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:39.200]  gone from what one in 25 000 30 years ago to one in 68 one in 52 depending on the numbers
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:44.960]  some say it's over diagnosed i don't think that's the case i see massive neurological issues in
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:49.360]  children everywhere now who haven't even been diagnosed with it the quirkiness the just you
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.600]  know the things and it's you know i have friends and family that have autistic children i know this
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:44:00.000]  has touched you as well ed what do you think's going on with autism bottom line and uh tell us
[01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.920]  about autism speaks listen if you've got frogs coming up with all kinds of different sexual
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.720]  aspects why why can our kids be affected in a different way exactly i think it's the environment
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:20.320]  and i and i think it's the poisons that we spew in our water in our air and uh you know
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:28.400]  i don't even want to think about the poisons that were released with the gulf oil spill
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:36.160]  what's in that water now uh if we're we're looking at the eradication throughout the world of uh
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:48.240]  uh of coral atoll uh there's poison everywhere and the the policing of those poisons
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:55.120]  is uh is not occurring with the rapidity with which they infect our lives
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:04.480]  well that's what all the scientists basically say is that it's a cocktail of things and that's how
[01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:09.680]  mercury and things and shots can push it over the edge but they've got studies out now on the gmo
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:16.160]  corn that has its own pesticide in it yeah causing autism even look at look at fukushima
[01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:21.440]  blowing up and the cover up of that what does the establishment think they're going to do
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:31.280]  when they are bushering the environment like this well and and the the uh the uh the drugs that are
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:42.400]  are constantly pushed into the food we eat the chicken and the and the beef and and the excess
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:50.880]  whatever excess is shot into the waters we drink and we're indulging and imbibing in all of those
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:59.360]  pharmaceuticals uh that are given to our animals and the excess of those pharmaceuticals
[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:02.800]  so nobody nobody's watching this store
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:12.400]  Ed I think that's the heart of it we are a poisoned
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:18.640]  we are a
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:27.760]  a absolutely a drunk out of our mind on poison I I think that's why society's getting so crazy
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:38.480]  well and and our children are affected one in 68 one in 88 primarily boys but frogs are similarly
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:52.080]  affected uh the sexual the sexual uh uh typing of frogs um uh it's a back to disappearing as we
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:47:00.320]  have heard uh what what's causing it all why and and does anybody care I don't I don't think
[01:47:01.120 --> 01:47:11.600]  now baby autism has been in this in this uh intensity all our lives and we really uh

[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:08.640]  be able to function in in real life I just had a friend who died of a heart attack at 57 wow
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:16.560]  there's three kids two boys and a girl yeah I saw a study uh British Medical Journal studied
[01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:21.120]  about a month ago we can pull it up and put it on screen for TV viewers where the headline was
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:29.280]  30 is the new 50 and they they went and looked at the DNA we are accelerating our aging now
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:37.280]  I mean this is a huge crisis oh really I hadn't seen that yeah well they spent it to say fit you
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.520]  know 70s the new 50 like oh you're gonna live and be young and all this but when it really comes
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:49.200]  down to it young people have been devastated by the environment I mean just devastated well it's
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:55.600]  not just that devastated by the environment look at the food we're eating look at the salt that
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:06.560]  we're sucking up look at the fat and the additives in all of the uh uh ready to wear food that we eat
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:16.160]  it is it is far from the simple fare you know there there was that wonderful study done on the
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:26.960]  Amish a few years ago and they found that the Amish in Ohio and Pennsylvania ate three huge meals
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:36.080]  a day none of them had a heart attack or or strokes or anything because on quite often
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:42.480]  each individual would walk 25 miles taking care of his land because he wasn't automated
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:49.920]  absolutely and there were no additives and they have no autism no autism folks because
[01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:56.160]  they're living an organic lifestyle right there they say the meek will inherit the earth certainly

[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:34.160]  on it saying America has no functioning democracy uh on the NSA isn't the social contract broken
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:41.040]  and uh now the government's getting more and more brazen uh the NSA last week told Congress
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:45.760]  and the courts you're not allowed to oversee us this is the tail wagging the dog it's like
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:53.120]  Nixon saying it's not illegal when the president does it what's your take on that I think it it's
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:55:00.480]  the uh further proof of the marked step of the United States to do it somewhat of a corporate
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:08.880]  fascism it certainly is and and I love how the corporate profits are guaranteed with taxpayer
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:19.680]  money but the losses are then also put on the people it's a win-win huh god almighty let's make
[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:28.160]  ourselves corporations and we can flaunt and flop around the world like uh like uh a character out
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:39.040]  of uh lost in space danger will Robinson danger yeah yes yes Ed front and center for you what
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.520]  what is right now what are you most focused on politically what concerns you the most
[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:52.000]  well to tell you the truth when I when I see the the march toward fascism corporate fascism in
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:02.480]  this country uh it it's it's occurring in so many areas I don't even begin to want to attack it
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:13.680]  because it's impossible it's like a thousand legged spider uh so out of fatigue and out of failure
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:23.760]  to know where to be effective I don't do anything I I still preach the language of 9-11 and the
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:32.240]  scandal and the fact that that open store will allow the corporate fascism to proceed in this
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:40.400]  country until the American people slap themselves awake and acknowledge that this was a great
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:50.880]  huge governmental crime that sections of government perpetrated this crime helped
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:57:01.200]  perpetrate this crime and 3 000 of our citizens die and nobody is willing to face the truth on that
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:05.040]  oh yeah take the brother who didn't have a throat wound they were clearly set up in the
[01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:10.080]  boss and bombing they're killing witnesses the brother worked for the CIA I mean it's incredible
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:17.360]  and people are on youtube going you're a traitor terrorist lover and I'm like he's pled not guilty
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:24.480]  the media is saying he's guilty the evidence is they were patsy's like Lee Harvey Oswald I'm not
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:31.040]  saying I'm glad he bombed people I'm saying the evidence shows he's a patsy they just can't get
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:37.680]  that in their heads Ed no they can't and they will accept whatever their government tells them
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:43.760]  and as long as you're willing to accept everything and everything that the government tells you
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:50.080]  you're going to be a patsy what do you make of the open funding of al-qaeda and libya and syria
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:56.080]  now to engage in just mass homicide and our media admits it and basically says it's a good thing
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:06.480]  well I I I I've been leery of that revolution from the beginning and I think it's a way to

[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:39.040]  bad people but the institution of monarchy whether it's Saudi Arabia or whether it is
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:47.360]  in the UK and the fawning and the way they use it as a diversion from all the big things that
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:52.240]  are happening at asner former head of screen actors guild uh just in I don't know how many
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:57.120]  hundreds of movies and how many movies have you been in oh hell I never counted man

[02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:48.160]  oh yeah and uh of course the thing that brought me uh uh scared to the tension and praise was uh
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:58.240]  uh up man I tell you uh that is probably my favorite children's movie because there's so few
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:03.280]  that are truly wholesome and and now I it seems like up almost led the way I'm seeing more and
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:08.000]  more wholesome movies uh for children is there a revolution in Hollywood or something happening

[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:39.120]  originally or you know helped create games for children it's a fantasy so so to speak oh I got
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.600]  it so it's it's uh sound like an action adventure but it's a it's a children's movie well I'll tell
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:48.960]  you that's amazing uh and in the last two minutes we've got do you have hope for humanity I mean

[02:02:55.040 --> 02:03:04.000]  I I don't have my coat I I'm I'm a cynic and I I realize that that that saves you a lot of effort
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.360]  a lot of labor when you're a cynic you can just sit back and say oh it's gonna suck

[02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:38.720]  that are up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and i've got more to say about the
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:44.960]  disgusting hysteria about the royal baby and what a new distraction that is so they moved from the
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:54.160]  trevon martin uh george zemerman diversion of racial division to now royalty worship and i've
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:00.720]  got to get to this pension fund news and also the cia admits weather modification i do do i get my
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:06.720]  apology from rachel manow saying i was insane no i don't i don't think i'm not going to hold my
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:12.880]  breath for that her apology is her viewership plunging uh let's go to mario in south carolina
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:19.360]  thanks for holding her on the air hey how's it going alex pretty good brother yeah i just called
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:24.640]  about the uh whole thing with detroit i was thinking that maybe that detroit will be the
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:30.160]  cypress of america and the whole thing was ms williams with him saying they will loot the pension
[02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:35.200]  funds i think he made a correct prediction because isn't that what they're going to do in detroit
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:39.920]  absolutely in fact i haven't even gotten into detroit today despite the fact we have a bunch
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:45.520]  of news on that and mike adams has a story uh dealing with government announcements that they
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:50.640]  are going to get the government pension funds first and you know they tell government bureaucrats
[02:09:50.640 --> 02:09:57.360]  hey you've got to go out and uh write more tickets raise more taxes take more houses when you get
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:04.400]  taxes on the general public uh working class lower middle class middle class above 40 percent
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:12.880]  historically it implodes economies and that's just a basic number and and and and now middle class
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:20.080]  is paying about 65 taxes in this country in in france the average person pays 82 and some people
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:27.040]  pay over 100 percent uh but the socialists are all exempted came out so the power to
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:34.560]  tax is the power to destroy as george washington said and and uh yes they are now moving into
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:40.000]  detroit as you just said uh to take all the government pension funds but of course the
[02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:46.560]  former mayors and people and city managers they're going to be exempt yeah there's the headline
[02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:55.040]  french tax source over 100 percent uh unbelievable uh so absolutely and again that's why they need a
[02:10:55.040 --> 02:11:00.640]  police state they know you're going to wake up try to take the government back and send them all to
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:06.320]  prison and again birdie madoff should not be in jail whenever whenever he says in the news
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:12.080]  jailhouse interviews that all i did is what everybody else does it's true now i'm not saying
[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:18.480]  madoff isn't a crook i'm saying send about a thousand crooks worse than him to jail first
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:25.840]  and then get around to sending him to jail i mean ken lay was a big crook but nothing compared
[02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:32.560]  to goldman sacks jp morgan wells fargo all these guys all these groups warrant buffett's a complete
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:37.680]  criminal and i'm not just saying that it's come out in the news he's done illegal stuff with money
[02:11:37.680 --> 02:11:42.960]  but doesn't get in trouble because they're made men they're above the law if they make a 40 to
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:48.240]  one bet like john corezine steal people's private money two years later oh we're not going to
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:52.960]  prosecute him well that wasn't a hard prediction to make so when you get to the point of they
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:12:00.560]  can never go to jail what does that do it emboldens them to get away with more and more and then that
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:07.680]  haughty attitude is transferred throughout the government until people marvel they say why are
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:13.520]  you on the air why are you still alive well god's involved my grandma's praying for me
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:18.400]  secularly they don't want to underline highlight everything i've said make me a martyr but i
[02:12:18.400 --> 02:12:24.000]  know deep down one of the biggest reasons is i've been told by some minions of the globalist
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.040]  they find this entertaining they actually think i'm demoralizing people they think you're so
[02:12:29.040 --> 02:12:34.400]  cowardly that you're so weak that you hear the truth here boy believe me this is the truth
[02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:39.680]  most you're gonna get to it i'm trying as hard as i can to really give you a researched informed
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:47.440]  answer with complexities the whole nine yards and they're like good you know i'm basically
[02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:53.040]  like america's head on a battle standard to intimidate people they think you're cowards they
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:12:56.960]  think you're broke they think you're weak they i mean i don't think you're like that i think
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:02.240]  they've miscalculated but here i am arguing for them to come after me but you know their
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:06.720]  angle is so what what's you're gonna do about it what's you're gonna do but the truth is they
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:12.240]  want to shut down so so there's a lot of things going on here but i think it's part of their
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:16.800]  haughty arrogance the smarter ones want to destroy me and they have destroyed my name to
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:20.960]  a certain extent with some people that don't pay attention but those folks didn't count anyways
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:24.400]  they're a bunch of spectators so i hope that answers your question i'm kind of ranting
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:31.920]  yeah i understand you but my whole deal is i try to wake up all the zombies but now is
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:36.720]  it's just getting more tiresome and tiresome to the point where you just want to sit back and
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:42.320]  just watch them basically perish away i mean they keep eating the gmo taking the fluoride
[02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:47.120]  and and the vaccines pretty soon next couple generations they won't be able to have kids
[02:13:47.120 --> 02:13:53.520]  and i have to deal with them no more you know no i hear you god bless you great points listen
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:14:02.880]  here's the deal we've already gone from one and 25 000 with autism in 1980 30 plus years ago
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:09.680]  to one in 50 something is the new number and folks cancer rates are up 3000 on average
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:15.760]  if you index them all together pediatrics are up over 10 000 percent pediatric cancers didn't
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:21.680]  exist in the 50s folks i mean we are under a curse you can call it spiritual or whatever
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:29.120]  you want but it's a curse and the globalists call themselves magicians and and what is a master
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:38.640]  magician they are a a a wizard they are a a a a master magician and that doesn't mean they're
[02:14:38.640 --> 02:14:43.520]  actually pulling a real rabbit out of the hat but if you believe a rabbit was pulled out of
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.640]  the hat that wasn't there before when it was really in a hidden compartment or hidden behind a mirror
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:57.840]  then it was pulled out see perception is reality for an unconscious slave and so if they feel like
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:04.240]  they're winning because obama is in office they say well you're gonna vote for uh mit romney and
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:11.280]  it's like no the trick is the system funded both men and knew who they wanted because he was a more
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:17.040]  effective evil not a lesser evil bit romney couldn't get away with anything that's going on right now
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:27.840]  not with his constituents or anybody so see they look at things the dumb down mass as a or b
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:38.960]  coke pepsi ford chevy the broncos versus the titans the cowboys versus the ravens the patriots
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:47.600]  versus the redskins blah blah blah the dolphins versus the chargers the seahawks versus the it
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:55.120]  goes on and on and so people are in a trance they just you're thinking about their job their burnout
[02:15:55.120 --> 02:16:01.280]  their poison from gmo poison from fluoride they have lower iqs i mean the harvard study folks on
[02:16:01.280 --> 02:16:07.520]  average it was 20 something percent for boys and 17 percent for girls so i just average it together
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:13.440]  but it there's 24 studies they look at in that major harvard study and one of them is on iq
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:17.600]  there's a bunch on iq but i'm just say harvard because people go harvard and you can look up
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:22.000]  harvard study fluoride and read what i just said it's a couple hundred pages long go read it i
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:26.480]  actually read the whole thing you know if i'm reading a novel i like i read it slowly but
[02:16:26.480 --> 02:16:30.960]  i mean i spent a speed read so it's kind of getting the gestalt of the info
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:38.480]  so and i take it personal i mean if people were throwing things through the windows of the austin
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:43.200]  city council i'm not calling for that but if they were doing that i'd say well you know they are
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:48.640]  putting fluoride in our water if there were people running around going i'm a victim take the fluoride
[02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:53.680]  out i'd say man yeah i agree with this but see no we're not doing that they've had marches in austin
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:17:03.680]  about trevon martin when that guy had dead brain cells throughout his mind throughout his his brain
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:08.000]  tissue and so does zemmerman we're all in this together we're all being attacked we're all
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:14.480]  being engineered and i think it's disgusting and that's why these people are like this these are
[02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:20.160]  these are victims we are all victims of this of the madness and i figured it out the globalists have
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:26.720]  90 plus percent of the reactors are leaking look that up out of 420 something reactors at 90 is it
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:34.800]  92 or 91 percent are leaking you can look up that number they're not getting away from all this
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:40.880]  these people are just nuts like they think they've got a plan and there is a plan but it's only a
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:46.720]  plan to control us and give us the short end of the stick but man you know it's like we're holding
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.160]  the hanger and a they pulled the pin they're sitting two feet away they're going to get blown
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:55.360]  up by it too they're not getting away with this let's go to brad in colorado brad thanks for holding

[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:19.600]  phone line and then it gets bad or maybe call him back john see if you know a better phone line
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:24.720]  that sounded like a vantage phone or something to me or a really bad cell phone like my wife always

[02:18:30.160 --> 02:18:35.920]  free and she does more and more why don't you use a landline we have a landline and she calls me and
[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:43.760]  it's always big and she's like what you can't hear me and i'm like honey she always gets irritated
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:48.560]  god lovers she's a sweetheart that i can't understand her and i'm like you got to go on the back porch

[02:18:56.320 --> 02:19:01.360]  away from the tower because the evidence is clear being close those cell towers is not good for you

[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:28.720]  to just get us to come back to sanity you know one reason the romans were so aggressive and insane
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:33.920]  towards the end of their dynasty their 400 year 500 year even longer than that if you count the
[02:19:33.920 --> 02:19:43.760]  decline 600 year technically uh dynasty from what a couple hundred bc right through 410 they were
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:50.000]  drinking out of lead lined containers water and wine which makes you completely insane and aggressive
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:56.240]  and there's an example right there we are poisoned we are poisoned and we have and we're not focused
[02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:02.160]  on real environmental issues it's all carbon taxes to pay al gore money we all know the terrible

[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:47.920]  will bail out detroit over his dead body and then he went on to say you can't bail out detroit
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:54.960]  bailing out detroit would have been not having the government take over general motors and ship
[02:24:54.960 --> 02:25:01.920]  it to china and i know that almost every show i mentioned that in the last four years since the
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:10.080]  so-called bailout of general motors because it blows my mind and i also get emails and i see
[02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:19.680]  comments going is that true yes folks you can search the term i'm pulling up the exact headline in
[02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:29.360]  my mind gm bailout shipped factories to china and now by the way four years later that factory
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:36.640]  just opened in china the big one for catalax and a bunch of other gm cars and of course that was
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:42.160]  21 billion to ship to china brazil and a couple eastern european countries and i'm not against
[02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:50.000]  brazil i'm not against um any of those countries but it's being sent there to deindustrialize this
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:56.640]  country because they got people that will work for pennies on the dollar you know they were going
[02:25:56.640 --> 02:26:03.040]  to ship jeep to china but the deal's been made oh we won't ship it to china since it's owned by fiat
[02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:08.400]  now we're going to ship it to italy oh that deal's been made it's going to be going to italy
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:16.000]  yeah there it is outsourcer in chief obama of general motors forbes magazine shipping the gm plant
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:17.680]  to china
[02:26:21.280 --> 02:26:25.920]  and then i got to hear his speech about i want to get jobs going i can't do a good obama
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:31.120]  imitation like bill clinton i want to get jobs for you that's why i'm shipping it to china
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:41.040]  or book yeah yeah we'll get but i can't really do an obama we got to get america going again
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:45.280]  that's what we got to do i i just can't do an obama i can do almost any voice but i can't do
[02:26:45.280 --> 02:26:51.360]  obama when we can play the real obama he's out on some tour right now he's going to get america
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:57.600]  going this guy's shut down hundreds of power plants they're going to shut down a couple thousand more
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:03.360]  and i know i just keep repeating the same thing i mean i'm watching i went and saw with my son
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:08.720]  and shane steiner last week we went and saw of the the brothers and arms gun show a
[02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:13.840]  a little high school friend we went and saw it our wives didn't want to go and uh
[02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:21.840]  um we go see pacific rim that's like a 21st century version of godzilla and i thought it
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:25.840]  was very entertaining but it's all about your u n global government propaganda kind of like
[02:27:25.840 --> 02:27:31.280]  world war z but as for entertainment it was entertaining for a cheesy movie but i was
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:38.560]  watching the kaiju which means giant uh monster in japanese fighting the jagers which means the
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:47.920]  hunters and what they send these aliens in to do is to destroy the major industrial cities first
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:55.520]  boom and just blowing up the power plants and smashing the bridges that's what the globalists
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.160]  do when they go into a third world country and take over they say okay you gotta sell all this off
[02:28:00.160 --> 02:28:06.240]  turn this off shut down five water plants only have one plant we'll charge you nine ten twelve
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:11.600]  fifteen twenty times what the water's worth then that causes rioting which drives down wages even more
[02:28:12.320 --> 02:28:17.120]  that's in the imf world bank plan that got leaked in 2002 it's called the imf riot look it up
[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:24.000]  but if they can't do that they militarily come in over some excuse bomb the plants bomb the
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.520]  energy plants the globalists are like alien kaiju's just shutting everything down
[02:28:29.520 --> 02:28:36.480]  and then obama is kaiju in america i mean when they let me tell you my grandfather went around
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:43.040]  bombing power plants in italy folks out of north africa that's what they did was bomb german bases
[02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:49.680]  and and and and blow up the infrastructure italy before they went in i mean that's what
[02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:54.960]  you do in a war you know the kaiju's come out of the ocean to use a child's analogy and tear up the
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:29:02.160]  cities ahead of the main invasion force giving away the plot here and that's what obama's doing
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:07.440]  but but see it's all for the earth i mean the also city councils yes we've doubled power prices
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:11.920]  the last five years and we're going to double it again and we've shut down all three city-owned
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:16.880]  power plants and there's one partially we own uh the Fayetteville plant we're going to shut it down
[02:29:16.880 --> 02:29:22.480]  now and we're going to buy our power from mexico that comes out of big dirty stacks because the
[02:29:22.480 --> 02:29:29.120]  globalists want to shut down ladies and gentlemen i mean the city council is a kaiju attacking my
[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:36.800]  city obama is a giant kaiju where are the yagers to deal with these people well there aren't any
[02:29:36.800 --> 02:29:42.960]  hunters left in this country all the men act tough all day or or or professional guys only focus on
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:47.440]  their own business and their own money and think they're getting ahead doing that no you're going

[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:32.480]  baby and at real alex jones i get it it's in bad taste i was on the hiking bike trail this morning
[02:35:32.480 --> 02:35:37.440]  went for short jog and i came across it and i had to take a photo of it and then say that it was a
[02:35:37.440 --> 02:35:43.360]  leaked photo of the birth of the new royal baby because they fawn over and act like we're scum and
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:49.680]  they're god and we're mutts and they're pure breeds so it it it all ties in nicely and hey it's

[02:38:29.120 --> 02:38:34.800]  absolutely the globalists used america's might and energy and industry to make deals to build
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:40.800]  their global empire off of selling out america that's been done and so everybody needs to know
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.200]  hey you know the stuff's getting bad the globalists did it and they're bigger than obama they're
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.720]  bigger than republicans what do they hate bell of rite's constitution declaration of independence
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:57.280]  it is like holy water to a vampire get back to what they attack whatever they attack
[02:38:57.280 --> 02:39:03.280]  is what they're scared of and absolutely i i can't think of a better place to point people
[02:39:03.280 --> 02:39:08.320]  to find out about what's happening than the info wars dot com and the youtube videos and the
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:16.080]  nightly news and what we're doing breaking down the hypocrisy making sense of things not you know
[02:39:16.080 --> 02:39:21.040]  the media says jones just makes up this cosmology to make sense of things no the globalists brag
[02:39:21.040 --> 02:39:26.320]  how they set this up we're only pointing out what they've said they're doing so i hardly agree with
[02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:31.760]  you people need to see themselves as leaders and start their own youtube channels their own local

[02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:19.360]  crew i mean it's amazing it's bigger better more successful than i could have imagined

[02:40:52.400 --> 02:40:59.360]  in a few days the top 15 or so down to 10 and then by the end of the month time's almost up here i
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:03.360]  feel like we're not doing justice to all these people we are going to announce the three winners
[02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:07.520]  the hundred thousand dollar prize that's a hundred thousand dollars just to just to see
[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:12.080]  what would happen and what would be produced some of these have been seen a half million times
[02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:17.760]  a lot of them 200 000 times a lot of them 100 000 50 000 20 000 i tried to count it up the other day
[02:41:17.760 --> 02:41:23.120]  and it was it was it was four or five million views i mean that's four or five million people
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:28.320]  that saw incredible art every different angle of tyranny and that's a pure thing we did that
[02:41:28.320 --> 02:41:35.600]  hundred thousand dollars for first place 10 000 for second 5000 for third the people say oh alex
[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:41.120]  is new world order alex is this or that obviously with no proof just to create a diversion because
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:44.880]  they're jealous or they work for the globalist or whatever the case is i don't care the fact that
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:49.760]  i'm being attacked so much as a sign of success but what a pure thing we've all been part of
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.160]  and david night helping hauncho so much of it's been a big hassle for him and others just because
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:42:02.240]  it's so much but also a labor of love because it's so much good incredible art animation fiction
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:11.200]  nonfiction historical stuff pro gun anti tyranny it's amazing info wars.com forward slash paul
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:19.200]  and you can go up there to the site and go through the top 300 or so and we'll try to
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:24.640]  cycle in some of the others as well but we'll be announcing by the end of the month the winners
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:31.360]  and what a pure thing i mean this inspired people to be part of this and whether you win or not
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:37.360]  you win by resisting you win by being a filmmaker and some of these people it was their first film
[02:42:37.360 --> 02:42:40.560]  and it's better than what i could do the first time or even the tenth time
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:48.960]  some of the stuff is tv beyond tv beyond hbo quality i mean i am blown away by the science
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:55.520]  fiction the i mean you name it it is amazing and i've always been here to inspire others
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:01.680]  because others inspired me and so there's humor there's animation there's there's
[02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:07.600]  stick figure animations claymations 600 plus entries that we saw
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.400]  and you've just done a great job and and that's another example of just
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:20.240]  pure resistance pure research and that's what the best things come out of and now
[02:43:20.240 --> 02:43:23.760]  we'll hone this down not just the three winners but others and talk to folks and say
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:27.840]  would you like to be commissioned to make a film would you like to work with us
[02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:32.800]  my only frustration is i can't hire 100 people i might be able to work with four or five groups
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:38.320]  of people maybe i'm out of money i'm spending everything i've got and then some reserve funds
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:42.000]  that's why it's important to buy the pro peer water filters it's why it's important to buy the new
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:47.520]  film state of mind now shipping on blu-ray and dvd that's why it's important to get the t-shirts and
[02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:52.960]  to get info wars magazine we're almost sold out of the july issue it's got 10 bumper stickers in it
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:58.320]  six medium four big ones with stuff like america's been occupied by globalist forces
[02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:04.320]  what a great way to wake people up what a great way to resist info war store dot com
[02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:08.720]  that's what it all comes down to when you buy your young jevity products and informers health
[02:44:08.720 --> 02:44:13.680]  dot com you're getting the best products the lowest prices and supporting the broadcast i mean it's
[02:44:13.680 --> 02:44:20.000]  all about that well let's go ahead and talk to s o d in new york you're on the air
[02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000]  here
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:27.440]  shod you're on the airs or is it solid thanks for thanks for taking my call alex
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:33.200]  hey buddy how you doing good how are you good yeah i just wanted to first of all congratulate
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:39.040]  you on hosting the contest i think it was a very uh wonderful idea to get uh the word out there
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:44.960]  for people who have not who don't really tune into your show and don't really follow the info wars
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:54.480]  crowd um we also participated in it are exactly those are messages in bottles 600 plus messages
[02:44:54.480 --> 02:45:01.280]  in a bottle go ahead yeah we also have an entry in the contest uh entitled uncle sam the search
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:06.400]  for liberty and i was wondering if the finalists have been announced because if you go to the website
[02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:12.400]  and it's i see a list of them there and i don't really see our movie um you know i'm not calling
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:17.360]  to complain but i don't know if it's official content come the finalist list or what you know
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:22.000]  here's the deal they walked into me we're all overwhelmed we're all doing too much here um
[02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:28.160]  they walked in 10 minutes before showtime and said do you want us to go up to the top 35 finalists
[02:45:28.800 --> 02:45:32.880]  and i said man i i don't know you guys are the ones on top of it i need to come see make sure
[02:45:32.880 --> 02:45:38.160]  it's the one let's do it after the show so this isn't gonna work perfect the site's not gonna be
[02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:46.480]  perfect uh we're going in so many directions it's insane it's insane uh so everybody wins by having
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:52.640]  it out there on youtube and waking people up uh and when we say the top 35 finalist i'm i'm sure
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:59.200]  there's going to be stuff that fell through our cracks and so you uh i mean here's the problem
[02:45:59.840 --> 02:46:06.640]  we're getting hundreds of emails a day asking questions so we can't even respond you understand
[02:46:06.640 --> 02:46:11.920]  what i'm saying yes i understand i mean i'm sitting in here with adam cokesh calling me right now
[02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:17.840]  from jail i mean what am i supposed to do with that you know it just goes on and on and on and my
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:23.040]  ringer's not turned off so i don't know what i can do i mean i could have not had the contest
[02:46:23.680 --> 02:46:28.240]  and then not had to worry about it that's what most like tech rush limbaugh he's got two employees
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:36.240]  and he makes 50 million dollars a year and you know basically it all goes to him which is fine
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:43.840]  that's his money great the whole point is i'm here trying to build something trying to do something
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:49.280]  complex i'm doing trailblazing stuff so it's going to come off like a train wreck sometimes
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:56.000]  uh but uh so i mean what's the name of your contest piece and we'll look it up it's called uncle
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:03.760]  sam the search for liberty and the inspiration is basically uh the answer to 1980 1984 1776
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:09.120]  so we take and you're saying out of 300 entries that we have there on the cycle you couldn't put
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:13.360]  600 up it already messes the side up to have 300 you're saying you never saw your piece
[02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:18.320]  no the pieces there were top 10 and everything i just don't see us in the finalist
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:27.520]  yeah unfortunately i can't really judge these here on air so it all just kind of runs together um
[02:47:28.160 --> 02:47:31.600]  and i know there's going to be the one reason i almost don't do this contest is there'll be
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:36.400]  disappointments out there we've had contest before when people don't win they take their video down
[02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:42.160]  it's like why would you take the work you've done that's to wake people up down if if if you don't
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:49.680]  win the contest so like i said i was asked about this before the show today and i was like i can't
[02:47:49.680 --> 02:47:55.440]  give you an answer sitting here right before i go on here about the 35 finalists and then they were
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:58.960]  asking and then i had to have each department actually came to me i'm not complaining it's
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:03.760]  just that i'm a i'm not good at organization or something i had each department involved in this
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:09.920]  come to me hitting me hitting me during breaks and i i don't even have time to go look at it
[02:48:09.920 --> 02:48:12.720]  show me you know what i'm going to make the announcement because i'm we're going to announce
[02:48:12.720 --> 02:48:17.680]  the winner in the middle of next month i appreciate your call sir because because i'm not going to
[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:22.720]  sit here and let something this important and get screwed up like this i told everybody we
[02:48:22.720 --> 02:48:26.240]  could take our time i told everybody we'd try to announce it in july but if we got a bunch
[02:48:26.240 --> 02:48:30.640]  of entries we wouldn't i because i mean tell you i want to make sure every entry gets looked at
[02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:34.880]  because i kept seeing everybody look at the same videos over and over again like they were new
[02:48:34.880 --> 02:48:41.600]  and then not see other videos so again you imagine yourself trying to judge 600 plus videos and those
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:48.400]  are 600 that that that follow the rules there were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:53.440]  and hundreds of others that were okay but didn't follow the rules like you've got to say info wars
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:59.280]  dot com somewhere in there i've got to get enough traffic back to the site to try to get that money
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:05.280]  back so i can continue so and and and i could tell it's going to be an absolute nightmare
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:12.080]  but it doesn't matter because the real victory happened you made the films they're out there
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:17.680]  i'm in the arena it isn't pretty it isn't perfect but i'm trying as best i can paul in new jersey
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:25.840]  you're on the air go ahead yes good afternoon elix the bottom line is you're umanati is trying to
[02:49:25.840 --> 02:49:36.240]  destroy the creation of god on earth here that's a main bottom line that satan want to lose people
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:41.040]  don't know it and no that's it in every culture evil gets in control and everything goes crazy
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:45.280]  and people always say oh we're just having fun oh let the government do what it wants and then

[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:41.920]  i don't know ladies and gentlemen here is it was actually twins a boy and a girl
[02:55:43.920 --> 02:55:48.480]  david ike got this footage inside today this just happened minutes ago
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:53.280]  it is a reptoid a blood drinking parasite
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:59.520]  right that looks like it was attached to the alligator gar my son caught 90 pounds
[02:56:01.920 --> 02:56:10.320]  oh my gosh look at it but what annoys me about those who are so down on the royal family who
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:17.360]  criticize our great british institution so much is the fact that look at north korea such a fantastic
[02:56:17.360 --> 02:56:25.440]  example so loyal to the state the death of kim jong il the recent funeral crying worshiping at his
[02:56:25.440 --> 02:56:33.040]  feet the hereditary leader brit's take that as a genuine expression of patriotism and we mimic it
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:38.000]  with the royal wedding with the royal baby absolutely that north korean worship of state is
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:44.720]  exactly what we need to express our patriotism hereditary in britain via the cherished royal
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:51.120]  family it's the same thing because north korea is only doing what brit's have done for hundreds of
[02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:58.160]  years that is worship an archaic hereditary dictatorship yes yes with all the trinkets
[02:56:58.160 --> 02:57:04.800]  and bubbles that go along with that now everybody is completely obsessed about yet another distraction
[02:57:04.800 --> 02:57:10.320]  just as a little bit with the royal wedding last year kate middle of the turn of the royal
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:14.800]  baby had to get a commoner let's just not concern ourselves with the fact that while brit's are
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:20.560]  saying that's why she's not ugly she said decades of austerity with more tax rises and spending cuts
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:27.360]  worth 60 billion pounds queenie has just given herself a five percent pay rise
[02:57:27.360 --> 02:57:34.640]  cleaning bringing her annual income up to 38 million pounds that's right and she has billions
[02:57:34.640 --> 02:57:42.000]  a year in making ends meet so she needed that extra little bit now it's 38 million pounds a year
[02:57:42.800 --> 02:57:52.640]  for queenie to pay her expenses i hasten to add of course that she owns 6600 million acres of land
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:57.760]  which is one sixth of the earth's entire non-ocean yeah we should have the largest landowner in
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:03.200]  psychopedia so you know if it's good enough for north korea then it's good enough for great britain
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:11.120]  here because the royal worship is state worship and we're being bombarded with it once again as the
[02:58:11.120 --> 02:58:18.880]  british economy melts down decades more austerity queen gives herself pay rise and just like these
[02:58:18.880 --> 02:58:24.800]  north koreans everybody once again bows down we love you government we ought to do that at the tsa

[03:02:20.960 --> 03:02:28.080]  get out of oh no no cops now all over the country going people's houses saying oh we're doing a
[03:02:28.080 --> 03:02:33.680]  drug investigation no warrant and then don't even find anything they just do what they want now and
[03:02:33.680 --> 03:02:39.840]  that's what this that's what tyranny is it's just a wall of government acting however they want
[03:02:39.840 --> 03:02:46.080]  kassandra in maryland you're on the air kassandra go ahead i've been listening to you ever since i
[03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:51.520]  saw that pierce morgan uh interview i didn't hear about you before then but anyway i i'm going to
[03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:56.400]  make this quick i called just to let you know i think you were a little off about the whole
[03:02:56.400 --> 03:03:02.880]  tray von martin case i found evidence myself tray von martin's father is a free mason he had all of
[03:03:02.880 --> 03:03:09.760]  his free mason symbolism i'm black and i fell into the scam of the whole thing in the beginning of
[03:03:09.760 --> 03:03:16.640]  how he how trovan martin was innocent i think it was an all set up i heard that george zimmerman's
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:24.560]  dad was a lawyer a judge i think that this was all a scam to start race wars in america and well
[03:03:24.560 --> 03:03:30.400]  ma'am i think the media is trying to do that but i mean i mean most masons are humanitarians and
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:36.960]  don't even know that higher up it's illuminati manipulated so i mean just because his dad was
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:41.600]  a mason i don't think that means he was involved in it i mean i've seen that theory out there
[03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:48.160]  and i just i'm not poo pooing what you're saying but i just what where's the proof i mean well
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:54.560]  if that was true i would under i would understand that but the pictures that he has on his or that
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:04:02.240]  he had on his facebook wall were not humanitarian pictures they were pictures of just demon symbolism
[03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:10.720]  the it wasn't good stuff he was into and just the how they've taken the case and i don't really
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:14.720]  watch the news i don't know ma'am i mean it's clear something's going on with this yeah from day one
[03:04:14.720 --> 03:04:20.320]  the justice department went down there from day one it's been government run uh and man stuff so
[03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:26.480]  crazy nowadays who knows i i mean i don't think his parents were involved in anything and i and
[03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:34.480]  i think they're very sad uh i mean let me tell you the i mean i just just because something
[03:04:34.480 --> 03:04:39.360]  could be possible one out of a trillion doesn't mean that it's then the case i mean i just don't
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:44.480]  buy into that but i appreciate your call undoubtedly they're trying to divide and conquer people along
[03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:49.440]  those lines i'm sorry to cameron steve and brinda and others i'll be back tomorrow lord willing live
