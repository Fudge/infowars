[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.140]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:31.260]  It never occurred to me after three highly effective vaccines were developed in under
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.800]  a year that we'd have difficulty getting Americans to take the shots.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.020]  But that's obviously where we are.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.740]  I want to underscore in the strongest possible manner I can.
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.580]  And I say this with some authority, as you all know, as a result of being a polio victim
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.840]  myself, and being very aware that it took seven decades to come up with two effective
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.280]  polio vaccines.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.540]  This was done in under one year.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.580]  These shots need to get in everybody's arm as rapidly as possible or we're going to be
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.780]  back in a situation in the fall that we don't yearn for that we went through last year.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.620]  The way to defeat getting back into the position we were last year is to get vaccinated.
[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.300]  This is not complicated.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.060]  97% of the people who are in the hospital now for COVID are unvaccinated.
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:46.700]  So if there's anybody out there willing to listen, get vaccinated.
[00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.700]  It's Saturday.
[00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.080]  July 24 2021 I'm your host Alex Jones and this is an emergency Saturday breaking bulletin.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.160]  It is critical that you stay with us throughout this transmission and check every piece of
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.900]  evidence we're going to show you and then warn others because we have the government
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.300]  documents directly from the Federal Reserve, as well as the UN that they were always planning
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.660]  a second, third, fourth, and then permanent lockdowns.
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.940]  And now Mitch McConnell, the Republicans have signaled that indeed coming this fall lockdown
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.820]  to here in the United States and worldwide.
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.340]  In fact, it's already relaunched in places like the UK, Australia and Canada after a
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.560]  year and a half is still under lockdown, just like Spain.
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.680]  How did I know a year and a half ago that the so called 15 day shutdown to quote leave
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.500]  the hospitals open because of the millions that were going to be dead and dying was a
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500]  fraud?
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.420]  How did I know they claim new variants were going to come out and so that new lockdowns
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.100]  have to be imposed?
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.500]  Because Klaus Schwab at the United Nations and the Davos Group has written books and
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.500]  white papers admitting that this is a corporate world government plan.
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.520]  This is to set up a post-industrial world with a digital worldwide ID card on your smartphone
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.340]  and then later a chip under your skin that tells you when you can and can't leave your
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.660]  house, where you can go, what you can do and how much red meat you can eat.
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.620]  I'm going to get into that today because they've already officially launched this just three
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.620]  days ago in the UK causing a panic.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.160]  And some of you may say, I don't care about the UK, I don't live there.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.260]  This is global governance.
[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.140]  As I've told you a thousand times, what happens in Australia, what happens in South Africa,
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.220]  what happens in the UK, what happens in Canada is coming to your country.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.020]  And it's all directed by the United Nations and the private corporations that control
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.020]  it.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.540]  Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation have spent the last decades, several decades,
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.220]  going through and buying off all the major health ministers and health departments of
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.260]  the planet.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.540]  It's on record.
[00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:05.380]  And now the Rockefeller Foundation is publicly directing the United States of America's US
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.180]  domestic and international COVID response.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.980]  Just like that, the United Nations and the Fortune 100 corporations that founded it and
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.760]  control it are in control of what medicine you can get, what your doctor can treat you
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.560]  with and what you're allowed to even say online.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.100]  And again, who creates the policy for the UN?
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.780]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation controlled by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie
[00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.340]  Endowment and others.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.000]  Who's the new CIA director?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.080]  The former head of the Carnegie Endowment.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.820]  This is the robber barons.
[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.800]  This is the eugenics movement.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.240]  This is the planetary corporate world government being built in your face.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.720]  And if you submit to these seasonal lockdowns and you submit to travel passes to leave your
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.960]  home, you are committing yourself and your children to a nightmare hell where we don't
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.760]  get out of the lockdowns by submitting to them.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.320]  We ensure that more intense lockdowns are going to come because in Klaus Schwab's own
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.980]  words, this is 21st century warfare against the industrial world.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:23.360]  This is the UN stated goal from Rio de Janeiro in 1992 of building a post-industrial planet
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.820]  and reducing the world population to 500 million that is on the Georgia Guidestones.
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.940]  Just a few weeks ago, Jane Goodall, the renowned naturalist came out and said, we should reduce
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.940]  the world population to what it was 500 years ago, which again is 500 million.
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.620]  You've alluded a couple times to the problem of overpopulation, yet at all the world conferences
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:58.020]  on global warming, this and that, we never hear about the problem of overpopulation.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.620]  Do you think it's a taboo subject and if so, why?
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.500]  It's been politically incorrect for a very long time.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.260]  If you go to a global conference on those issues and I'm there, you will hear me talking
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:19.140]  about the mushrooming human population growth that's led to deforestation that leads not
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.140]  just to harm for the animals and the environment, but the people living there too, no question,
[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.740]  like what I described at Gombe.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:34.580]  If you talk about overpopulation and not population control, that's really what got to people.
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.780]  They don't want to be controlled.
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:44.540]  Then of course, there's the Catholic Church and that makes quite a major problem when
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.820]  you are trying to get balance between the people and their environment.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.780]  That's what has to happen if we're going to take this world on through this millennium.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.780]  That has to happen.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.260]  Would you agree we have to get more balance?
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.820]  Everything you've been told about COVID-19 has been a lie.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:03.220]  You were told millions and millions of Americans would die.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.580]  You were told it had a four percent death rate when it didn't have one tenth of one
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.580]  percent rate.
[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.860]  They used fake PCR tests that were totally fraudulent to say that all these people that
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.980]  were completely healthy were sick and they would say, oh, you're just asymptomatic.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.740]  And now they're bringing in global contact tracing run by the UN and Google with the
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.700]  Bill Gates Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative to come to your door.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.500]  And now I've gotten text alerts on my phone and seen on the local news in Austin that
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.060]  I better comply when the contact tracers come to my house.
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.540]  And Biden has launched his strike force teams to come to your door and try to intimidate
[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.980]  you to take shots.
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:48.500]  And Mitch McConnell is there holding America hostage and saying, we're going to have more
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.020]  lockdowns this fall if all of you don't take your shot.
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.900]  But I thought if you took the shot, like Joe Biden said just last week at that town hall,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.900]  you're supposedly completely safe and can't get COVID.
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.860]  The various shots that people are getting now cover that they're you're OK.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.920]  You're not going to you're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.120]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.320]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.560]  You're not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.380]  But I'll tell you what is going to remain open during the next lockdowns they bring
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.680]  in to shut down small businesses and bankrupt our families and force us onto a universal
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.240]  income so they can control our lives with that money.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.000]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, the border where the Border Patrol reports already millions
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:49.000]  of people have crossed in just the first seven months of this year from all over the world,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.320]  including thousands of Africans from Africa and people as far south as Venezuela.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.780]  And what do they tell the Border Patrol when they show up here by the thousands a day per
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.440]  checkpoint where Biden then orders them brought in the United States?
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.680]  They say we're under lockdown.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.760]  We're starving to death.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.240]  We don't have jobs.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.160]  And so now the big Catholic diocese and the Catholic bishop in D.C. has actually told
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160]  the truth.
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.600]  He said under lockdown, they're dying and starving to death.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.400]  The West isn't buying food from them anymore.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.420]  The farmers have no one to sell their food to.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.360]  And so we have to let them in because they're starving to death.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.920]  But what caused them to starve to death?
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:31.180]  What destroyed Africa?
[00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.500]  What destroyed Latin America?
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.640]  What destroyed the Middle East?
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.000]  What destroyed Asia?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.480]  The lockdowns.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.620]  What starved an extra 20 million people to death?
[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.920]  The lockdowns.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.740]  Popular podcaster Tim Pool made this point that Mitch McConnell says we're going to be
[00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.960]  under lockdowns if we don't take their deadly shots.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:54.060]  But don't worry, the border is going to be wide open and nobody's making the illegals
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.060]  take the shots.
[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.240]  And by the way, I agree with that.
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.240]  Nobody should.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:14.440]  This is bipartisan tyranny.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:22.220]  We have Mitch McConnell and we have the puppet president, Joe Biden, working in concert together
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.620]  to violate the Nuremberg code to tell us that you could lose your job or you could lose
[00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.340]  your children or you could not be allowed to go outside.
[00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.420]  You're going to be listed as non-essential, basically subhuman if you don't take an experimental
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.600]  unauthorized injection.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.720]  That is the essence of the Nuremberg code passed and that our government signed on to
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.160]  and that we passed similar laws here in the United States after World War II because the
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.820]  Nazis would coerce people into dangerous experimentation as well.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:11:01.040]  And so what Mitch McConnell and what Joe Biden are doing is patently illegal, patently un-American,
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.720]  and it is our right and our duty to resist this assault.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:11.380]  Thank God the governor of Arkansas, excuse me, of Alabama, had one of the lowest vaccination
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:16.980]  rates in the country, is now, and I give, I'm genuinely complimenting her.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.980]  That's okay.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.980]  That's all right.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.980]  That's all right.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.980]  No, no, no, no.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.980]  Let him talk.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.980]  No.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:35.980]  Look.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:43.980]  That's okay.
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.980]  Look.
[00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.980]  Look, it's not a Trump rally.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.980]  Let him holler.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:53.980]  No one's paying attention.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.980]  Look.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.240]  Here's the point.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:09.240]  Virtually all the COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations are today among the unvaccinated people.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:16.240]  People are really starting to wake up across the world, in Spain, in France, in Germany,
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:19.240]  in countries in Africa, in Canada.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.160]  People are demonstrating in record numbers and saying, we're not accepting your forced
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:31.020]  inoculations and your tracking app with a social credit score to be able to go to the
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.020]  grocery store.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.880]  So, a week after Macron announced that you couldn't leave your house without this special
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:41.460]  digital health passport, he's had to back down, and that's the same thing that needs
[00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.220]  to happen here in the United States as they attempt to roll this out, and the same thing
[00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.360]  that needs to happen to Boris Johnson as well, and that's the next big story we're going
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.360]  to get to.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.220]  But first, I like to back up claims I make.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.960]  When I say that an additional 20 million people have died in the last 16 months of lockdown
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.240]  because it never ended in most areas of Africa or in India, that's a very conservative number
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.320]  from the United Nations.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:13.340]  Now this article is from over a year ago, April 22, 2020, and it has the headline, Instead
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.600]  of Coronavirus, the Hunger Will Kill Us, a Global Food Crisis Looms.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:26.100]  So here's the UN ordering the global shutdown, who made them boss, and then a few months
[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.820]  into it, oh, people are starving to death.
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.860]  They estimated an extra 280 million people would go to the verge of starvation and death,
[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.240]  and they estimated that an additional 30 to 40 million would starve to death during a
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.760]  lockdown in one year.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:47.200]  The best numbers we've got from the UN are between 20 and 30 million people did indeed
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:48.760]  starve to death.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.520]  But in most of those countries, they had to limit the lockdown because people pointed
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.600]  out we're dying by the hundreds of thousands per week.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.000]  We're dying by the millions every few months to stop a few hundred thousand dying from
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.260]  supposedly COVID, which in most cases was the flu or a cold that the PCR tests were
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.400]  fraudulently saying was something else.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.400]  Think about that.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.520]  And now the big news, what is unfolding in the United Kingdom?
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:21.480]  So last week, Boris Johnson very cynically announced Freedom Day and said that the lockdowns
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.640]  and small shops being nonessential, well, that all of that was over and that everybody
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:27.880]  could go back outside.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.400]  Nobody had to wear a mask.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.560]  And I had predicted that they would instantly bring the restrictions back in because I know
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.560]  their psychology.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.200]  Oh, you're in the new normal.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.800]  You're free.
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:45.320]  And first five hundred thousand, then another million people within two days got pinged
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:53.000]  and they've been calling it the ping panic or ping again with all the major stores empty,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.200]  major companies shutting down, total panic, because instead of announcing the shutdown
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:03.440]  again on national TV, they just started pinging millions of people that, oh, you might have
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.000]  been close to somebody that had COVID.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.120]  No due process, no probable cause, just the technocracy, the phone.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.220]  And even if you don't have the government app they've been telling you to take, color
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.220]  of law, there's no law.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.220]  They just say do it.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.680]  Still, the phones are sending it to you as emergency alert messages saying you need to
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.760]  quarantine at home for 10 days.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.520]  So it caused a chain reaction and a giant panic.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.680]  This is how you train people to lock themselves up.
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.120]  This is how you train people to be nonessential.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.780]  But then all the big grocery stores and Walmart and Target and Amazon all over the world,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.120]  they keep operating at 100 percent.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.300]  They consolidate power.
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.560]  They double and triple profits while you go bankrupt.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.040]  This is economic warfare one on one.
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.240]  And here's some of the headlines.
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:58.600]  Tuesday morning, UK news briefing, COVID data that panicked the PM and panicked others.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:02.400]  And then when he saw it, he just had to reimpose things right away.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:04.240]  It's not about people dying of COVID.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.840]  No, no, no, no.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.120]  It's now if you've tested positive, which I'll show you government documents in a moment,
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:16.260]  they admit is a total fraud, including similar fraudulent technologies like Theranos claiming
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:22.160]  you have cancer when you don't and not doing a real test or 23andMe that the head of YouTube
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.420]  helped found where someone sent in the spit of their lizard.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.980]  And we'll tell you what it came back with here in a moment.
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:30.980]  So we're going to cover that.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:35.420]  But here's another headline on Telegraph, limited number of critical workers to be allowed
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.060]  to avoid self-isolation.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.900]  Turns out the government workers and the media and other elites, they're all exempt from
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.460]  their phone telling them not to leave their house.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.980]  Told you that was always coming.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.260]  So so that's Freedom Day is going under the social credit score.
[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.900]  Black Mirror Nightmare app.
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:17:00.380]  Now, let's expand on the fact that the New York Times even a year ago admitted and then
[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:06.500]  since then, there's thousands of articles admitting 20 to 30 million extra people starved
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.180]  to death, a death sentence under the ongoing lockdowns that are now being reannounced all
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:13.180]  over the world.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:18.500]  And when the West shuts down and we stop buying all sorts of raw materials from the Third
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.780]  World, they starve to death.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.540]  And again, what happens then?
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:24.540]  Replacement migration.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:29.900]  The U.N. organizes the refugees and then brings them here and helps collapse our civilization
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.380]  and society as well with the Cloward and Piven strategy.
[00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.100]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.400]  Lockdowns kill more Canadians under 65 than covid-19.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.860]  Massive suicide, massive people not getting medical care and dying.
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.700]  That is the serious torture.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.360]  Here's another one.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.200]  Just a few days ago, the prime minister of Australia was asked, hey, there's a lot of
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.040]  side effects and problems with these vaccines.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:02.720]  Hell, the U.S. vaccines, the Moderna and Pfizer have been banned in a bunch of countries.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.860]  Oh, by the way, did you know India is only 10 percent vaccinated?
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.400]  Did you know Japan's not even 10 percent?
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.200]  Did you know China doesn't make their citizens take vaccines and isn't threatening them to
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.880]  take it?
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:17.800]  Did you know that more than half of the CDC staff have refused it?
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:22.320]  Oh, did you know Jen Psaki had to admit that most of the White House isn't taking the shots
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.920]  and nobody's being made to take them?
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:27.500]  This is all being done to the working class.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.920]  And this is not a vaccine.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:35.400]  It is a dangerous mRNA concoction directly linked in major studies to what?
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.960]  Infertility, blood clots, heart attacks and more.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.200]  So here's a clip of the Australian prime minister being asked.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.120]  He says, hey, it's we're not forcing this.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:53.120]  It's on you if you take it again, an experimental secretive shot linked to all these problems.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.840]  He just previously in press conferences said we need to pressure people and make them do it.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:03.200]  We've seen Kathleen Sebelius here in the U.S., former head of health services under Obama,
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:07.960]  say don't let you have a job, don't let you leave your house, don't let you have your
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.780]  children if you don't.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.740]  So they're trying to play both sides of this so they don't violate the Nuremberg code.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.180]  But they're already have done that.
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.300]  Here's the clip of the prime minister.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:24.260]  Can you talk about the two people who sadly died taking AstraZeneca?
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:32.980]  And would you be worried if one of those people, as I understand it, had or the family claims
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.580]  didn't get wasn't fully informed of the symptoms to look out for?
[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:41.900]  Well, we're all responsible for our own health.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:47.180]  When it comes to informed consent and giving consent to whatever treatment or procedure
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.460]  you may have or I may have, then I'm ultimately responsible for what people do in their health
[00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.220]  treatment to me.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:01.260]  And there has been the opportunity for people to visit their GP, to have that consultation.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.180]  The government has provided that and funded that.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.820]  And the informed consent process provides the decision to the individual.
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.340]  That's the sort of country we live in.
[00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.180]  People make their own decisions about their own health and their own bodies.
[00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.620]  That's why we don't have mandatory vaccination in relation to the general population here,
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.220]  because people make their own decisions.
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.380]  And we encourage people to make those decisions.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.940]  We make as much information available to them as possible.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:32.420]  The vaccines, like any vaccine, with any vaccine, there are risks associated.
[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:36.260]  And I won't go into each of the individual ones because I don't want to particularly
[00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.500]  draw attention to any one.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:43.940]  But we all understand that with any vaccine, there are risk factors and they're enumerated
[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.100]  and they're made available to people and people make decisions about that.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.820]  Another big lie we've been hearing from Biden isn't just that if you have the vaccine, you're
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.220]  totally safe and you can't ever catch COVID again because they could never make a vaccine
[00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:58.820]  for the common cold.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.020]  There's thousands of variants of it.
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:06.700]  So now they teach you to be scared of variants and say it's the unvaccinated 99 percent in
[00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:11.300]  the hospital, 99 percent that are dying, haven't had the vaccine.
[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:13.820]  They never show the statistic, they never show the number.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:18.260]  But out of Canada, out of the U.K., out of Singapore, out of all these countries, there's
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.580]  hundreds of these articles.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.020]  It's actually being reported by local health authorities that the vast majority of people
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:28.880]  sick and dying had taken the COVID vaccine.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:35.580]  And now they're telling you that COVID killed you or made you sick, not the vaccine.
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.540]  Just like the lady that does the big torch lighting and stuff in Tampa Bay, it just turned
[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:47.300]  out that, oh, she can't participate because she got sick and is in the hospital with COVID
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.340]  after she took the COVID vaccine.
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:51.060]  Here's another example.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:57.020]  Vaccinated comprise 75 percent of coronavirus infections in Singapore that has one of the
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.180]  highest rates of vaccination in the world.
[00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.900]  So it's having the opposite effect.
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:09.300]  Now, let me get to the big issue, because all this is intertwined, interconnected.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.180]  New lockdowns are coming.
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.820]  We have a right and a duty to oppose them, not just for our own future, our own business,
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:23.300]  our own lives, but also for the third world that's going to be absolutely, completely
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.140]  devastated at levels even worse than we've already seen.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.300]  This is genocide.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.460]  And then the ragtag groups left are going to be organized and brought here as a permanent
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.460]  political underclass.
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.620]  So we're going to get to that again in a moment.
[00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:44.580]  But first, I want to hit the giant fraud at the middle of this that is incontrovertible,
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.500]  that you've absolutely got to get and share with everyone you know.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.420]  Everyone knows the PCR test is a fraud.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:23:00.300]  The inventor of the PCR test said if you turn it up past 30 resolutions or 30 cycles,
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:07.960]  that you basically get a 100 percent rate for whatever it is you're testing for.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.700]  So you could test for uranium in the air.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.820]  There's no uranium, but you turn it up high enough, it will find uranium.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:20.320]  You could test for beta carotene, but there's no beta carotene from a carrot.
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.320]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.560]  If you turn it up to 40 cycles, 45 cycles, it will tell you that this wooden table has
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.960]  beta carotene in it.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:32.140]  It'll tell you that the brick on the walls have beta carotene on it.
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:34.520]  It's the same thing for COVID-19.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:39.040]  In most people, when they've actually done biopsies, there is no virus of any type in
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.480]  there.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:47.000]  They are just simply taking mucus out of the mucus membrane in the sinus and turning it
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.800]  up to 40 cycles.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:57.080]  As soon as Biden got into office on January 20th, the CDC said, we no longer recommend
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.560]  that you do it at 40 cycles, they said go to 30.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:06.700]  At 30 cycles, most people are negative, whether you have COVID or not, or any other type of
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:10.960]  viral or bacterial infection, because any of those will give you a false positive.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:18.220]  And that came out on the CDC's own website to little or no fanfare back in December.
[00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.740]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.100]  Here's the fine print.
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:25.660]  They can politically turn these PCR tests up whenever they want to say everybody's got
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:30.880]  COVID and cause a martial law shutdown that helps them consolidate money and power and
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.460]  control and forces to adopt this world social credit score and world social medical ID that
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:41.220]  Klaus Schwab and others openly admitted they were going to launch five years ago.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:46.260]  And then when they want to open things up again, then they just have the PCR test dialed
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.260]  back.
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:55.140]  The CDC itself has come out and said it is a fraudulent test, it is not real, it should
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.300]  not be taken seriously.
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:25:02.660]  But still, at airports and all over the world, they are demanding people show proof of one
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:08.620]  of these tests to be able to board an aircraft, get on a train, or even in some cases leave
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:09.620]  your house.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.740]  So I know what you're thinking, wow, that's great, the PCR test has been discredited.
[00:25:14.220 --> 00:25:18.820]  Well, the PCR test was chosen because it's very easy to engage in fraud with it.
[00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:20.900]  You can set it however you want.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.740]  The problem is, and the bad news is, there are hundreds of other companies and similar
[00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:31.880]  tests out there that have now been adopted, and it's become incredibly political.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:38.860]  We now have Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, and many others like, you guessed it, George Soros,
[00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:45.580]  heavily investing in similar PCR style test systems so they can be in control of your
[00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:51.940]  medical records and who is allowed to travel, who is allowed to be able to actually have
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.980]  a job or live or leave their home.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.620]  So you always have the Clinton Global Initiative and Bill and Melinda Gates and the UN involved
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:05.280]  in the contact tracers and the squads that are coming to your house, the strike teams.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:11.080]  But now you've got, of course, the usual suspects in control of the companies themselves.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.640]  And remember, it was Bill Gates eight years ago that funded Theranos and used that young
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:21.560]  woman as his front to say another computerized test could find cancer and hundreds of other
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.560]  things.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.560]  And it was all a fraud.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.560]  It was all a lie.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:30.000]  And millions of people ended up having chemotherapy and having parts of their bodies chopped off
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.200]  due to that.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.780]  She's been indicted for years but never gone to trial.
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.460]  So let's review the fraud again.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:39.200]  Here's the Tanzanian president.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.980]  By the way, he wouldn't do the force inoculations.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:45.820]  He died along with three other African presidents and the Haitian president did the same thing.
[00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:46.820]  He got tortured and killed.
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:48.900]  But that's a side issue.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:56.340]  President queries Tanzania coronavirus kits after goat test and he tested a goat and a
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.900]  papaya and several other things, had them sent off to the UN funded system and they
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:10.740]  all came back, the goat, the papaya and other things, 100% coronavirus positive.
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:11.740]  He thought so.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:17.980]  He noticed that almost every person in Tanzania being tested during the UN push lockdown had
[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:20.540]  COVID but they were asymptomatic and totally healthy.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.060]  So he sent a papaya and he sent a goat and other things.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:30.020]  They were all 100% positive with the UN run PCR test.
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.140]  Now I raise that because we've got a new example of this.
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:39.980]  Not just Theranos with their scam, not just the PCR test with its fraud that's been used
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:45.060]  to shut down the world and kill tens of millions through starvation, but this has now been
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:48.860]  confirmed by major scientific reporters and journals.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.340]  And so everybody's starting to do it.
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.340]  We're going to do it too.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:55.340]  I'm going to send off some of my cat saliva and my dog saliva and see what happens.
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.020]  Next week I'm doing it.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:04.380]  Someone sends a lizard saliva to 23andMe for DNA testing, exposing total fraud of companies'
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.420]  claims of human ancestry.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.700]  And of course, who started it?
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.740]  The head of YouTube.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:15.340]  And that's why everyone, including people that have zero African in them, they just
[00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:21.540]  throw 5% African into it just to quote, teach people to feel like they have solidarity.
[00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:26.700]  It's all just social engineering, all manipulation, all of it is psychological warfare and all
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:31.420]  of it is about setting the precedent to be able to engage in fraud through the medical
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.160]  system and never get in trouble for it.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.820]  So they documented it, they sent it off, and we're going to show you the results right
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.820]  now.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.580]  I wanted to see what would happen if I sent my pet lizard DNA into 23andMe.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:49.520]  And so with the help of my wife, we extracted enough saliva to send off in the mail.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.660]  We were so excited to see the results.
[00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:56.300]  After about three months, we were shocked.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.700]  My lizard was 51% Ashkenazi Jewish.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.580]  He was also 48% West Asian.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.780]  This was really interesting.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:12.220]  They also gave us a little bit of his background and his history, what he liked to eat, etc.
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:15.300]  Let us know which animal's DNA we should send in next.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.420]  They lied to us at every level of this.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:23.900]  And then they suppressed real medical treatments for the flu and for pneumonia and let millions
[00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:29.580]  of people around the world die because they would be told, don't come in until you can't
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.580]  breathe.
[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:35.780]  And then when people came in with regular pneumonia and water in their lungs, they would
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.420]  be intubated and would die when it was too late.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.420]  And then they would say, oh, you died of COVID.
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:41.420]  That's all been confirmed.
[00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.740]  And people that died of car wrecks, gunshot wounds, people that drowned because the hospitals
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:51.060]  all got $53,000 in the US.
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.820]  If you were a COVID patient, similar numbers around the world.
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:57.500]  So this was all set up by the big corporations, all set up by Bill Gates, the Rockefeller
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.740]  Foundation, and John Hopkins was involved to actuary how this worked.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.420]  Everybody else has had real medical problems.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.420]  Don't go to the hospitals.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:11.620]  The hospitals were empty except for the people they would take in and intubate and murder
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:16.740]  except for the COVID patients they would send into nursing homes to actually kill people
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.420]  and jack up those numbers.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.700]  And just yesterday, Biden came out and killed the Trump investigation into Governor Whitmer,
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:27.740]  who sent people knowingly to nursing homes, even when doctors told them it'll kill those
[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:29.220]  old people.
[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.060]  And of course, Governor Cuomo, even though the nursing home association said, don't do
[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:34.940]  it, you'll cause death.
[00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:38.660]  People that they knew had COVID, that just meant the flu or a cold, and in some cases
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:44.500]  COVID, they could go and be by your mom or dad, but you, while they quietly killed your
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.780]  mom and dad in the nursing home, couldn't visit them.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.140]  See how it works?
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:53.180]  All a depopulation, psychological warfare system.
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.660]  And don't forget, Psaki wouldn't answer the question about why they don't make people
[00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.620]  take shots in the White House because they're not going to take the shots.
[00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.620]  None of them are.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.860]  They're not stupid.
[00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.740]  That's for us, not for them.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:11.860]  Throughout history, powerful elites get together and they decide to try to take over their
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.860]  neighbors.
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:16.620]  And they also decide to try to dominate and control their own populations.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:19.820]  And they've used a lot of things to do it throughout history, including the fear of
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.900]  disease.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.060]  And they're doing it again this time on a worldwide scale.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.840]  And they've taken over legitimate science and legitimate medical systems and said, science
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.420]  now means not asking questions.
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.180]  Well, that's the opposite.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.820]  Science means transparency and asking questions.
[00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:43.140]  That's why early on when this was all happening, they said, oh, don't let Trump come out with
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:48.060]  a vaccine because they wanted to be the heroes and they wanted to be the ones to politically
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.220]  control folks.
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.540]  And they didn't want to open the economy up.
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.900]  They wanted to keep it shut down to consolidate control.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.060]  Trump wrongly did warp speed.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.980]  He believed to get the economy going.
[00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.060]  But I understand why he did it.
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.940]  I still don't agree with it.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:08.360]  But these guys were on record, whether it's Kamala Harris or whether it was Joe Biden,
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.360]  you name it.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.800]  And they said, you can't trust this vaccine because they knew the general public doesn't
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.960]  trust vaccines because the long history of them being tainted and having problems.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.960]  Would you get it?
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.700]  Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us.
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.680]  If and when the vaccine comes, it's not likely to go through all the tests that needs to
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.000]  be entered, trials that are needed to be done.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.600]  When we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, who's going to take the shot?
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.940]  Who's going to take the shot?
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.980]  You can be the first one to say, put me, sign me up.
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.620]  They now say it's OK.
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:46.820]  And the question of whether it's real when it's there, that requires enormous transparency.
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.140]  You got to make all of it available to other experts across the nation so they can look
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.140]  and see.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.500]  So there's consensus.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.500]  This is a safe vaccine.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.180]  If the president announced tomorrow we have a vaccine, would you take it?
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.740]  Only if it was completely transparent that other experts in the country could look at
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:04.780]  it.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.420]  Only if we knew all of what went into it.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.780]  If Donald Trump can't give answers and the administration can't give answers to these
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:14.460]  three questions, the American people should not have confidence.
[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.820]  But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.
[00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.620]  One day, Biden says, if you have the vaccine, you can't get sick.
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:24.380]  The next day, he says people are getting sick because they haven't had the vaccine and they're
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.700]  making those that have had the vaccine get sick.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.620]  None of that is based in science.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.820]  All of that is based in fraud.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.360]  The good news is the wheels are coming off this thing.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.900]  The world is awakening.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:38.600]  People are very, very angry and the globalists are cornered.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.180]  The bad news is they are simply doubling down.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.180]  So it is your right.
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.240]  It is your duty.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.320]  If you don't want to be a slave and if you don't want to be bankrupted and if you don't
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.880]  want to be non-essential and if you don't want your children wearing masks and taking
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:57.120]  deadly shots the rest of their lives to protest and to demonstrate now because they're bringing
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.880]  the lockdowns back in the fall.
[00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:02.760]  They've already brought them back around the rest of the world and we have to get out ahead
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:08.040]  of their narrative and let this corrupt system know we're awake and we're going to hold them
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:13.360]  legally and lawfully responsible for what they've done because it's violating federal
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.400]  and state law and it's violating international law and I've had the top lawyers on my show
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.680]  like Dr. Francis Boyle who wrote the US bioweapons law, who helped write the UN bioweapons treaty,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:30.120]  who helped get the death penalty into US law for what they're doing and he's come on my
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.820]  show many times and detailed all of this and exactly what he said on my show 16 months
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.840]  ago that you cannot make a vaccine for a coronavirus and that all it's going to do is cause an
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.920]  autoimmune response to the protein casing and cause blood clots has now been proven
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.920]  right.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:48.880]  Why did he know that?
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.400]  Because he's the top legal bioweapons expert and he consulted the other experts.
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.360]  But now we're not telling you what's coming.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.360]  It's already here.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.320]  This is a life and death situation.
[00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:07.520]  And when you see the Democrats introducing bills by federal law that big tech will be
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:12.840]  held liable if it doesn't censor people that have been hurt by vaccines or if it doesn't
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.920]  censor medical doctors that are exposing that these aren't vaccines, I've got the articles
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:18.920]  right here.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:23.960]  US senators target tech's legal immunity to stop vaccine misinformation and have introduced
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.400]  a bill to hold them liable if they don't muzzle us and keep us quiet while they basically
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.280]  kill us and carry out this bioweapon attack.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.840]  Here's a CNN headline.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.680]  Instagram blocked the hashtag vaccines kill hashtag two years ago.
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.160]  Facebook only just now got around to doing it.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.880]  CNN isn't media.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:51.320]  CNN are attack dog bullies whose job is to attack and destroy and suppress the people
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.840]  while the globalists carry out depopulation.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:59.320]  I am legitimately freaked out for my family and for my friends and for humanity.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.720]  We know this is a fraud.
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:02.300]  We know it's depopulation.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.300]  We know it's evil.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.300]  We know it's wrong.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:11.440]  I want to show you a clip that is extremely powerful of a medical doctor, Charles Hough
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:18.560]  from British Columbia, who is now being disciplined and they may fire him simply because in his
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:24.960]  major medical practice at the hospital, at the ER, he is seeing people dying from blood
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.960]  clots.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.680]  He is seeing people extremely sick.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.600]  He's seeing people having strokes and heart attacks, including young people after they've
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.560]  had the Moderna, the Pfizer shots and others.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:38.720]  So in closing, I want you to understand that we live in a world where you don't just get
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:44.920]  censored off the internet, but you can even lose your job when you have a medical degree
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.680]  and you are reporting what they admit on the inserts of these so-called vaccines it
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.360]  can cause.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.680]  Doctors are supposed to do no harm, Hippocratic Oath.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.720]  And here he is doing his job like so many other prestigious scientists that came out
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.940]  and predicted what these shots would do and who are now warning the world again.
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:04.940]  And how were they?
[00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.940]  How were they rewarded?
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:13.800]  Dr. Yidan and Dr. Tenpenny and so many others, they're rewarded by White House press conferences
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.560]  calling for them to be silenced.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.600]  And the Justice Department and state attorney generals have opened investigations up and
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:25.080]  are talking about trying to arrest them for disinformation.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.640]  Since when is disinformation illegal?
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.480]  Plus, we're not the ones putting out disinformation.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.440]  We're putting out the truth under the First Amendment.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:35.440]  And it's you, the system that spit off more than you can chew.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.600]  And it's you, the system that's depopulating us and that ran this test.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:43.760]  And it's you, the system that came out in the year 2000 in CDC documents that the CDC
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:47.000]  knew that autism was caused by vaccines.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.560]  And the head of the UN vaccine program in December of 2019 admitted that the front line
[00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.520]  was getting wobbly and that they knew vaccines didn't work and that the UN wasn't testing
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.520]  them.
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:00.440]  They were just told to do it by Big Pharma and Bill Gates and that they were murdering
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.440]  people.
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:05.520]  And so instead of backing off, the response of Big Pharma is to push this giant attack
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:09.920]  and commit crimes that are even bigger, hoping they've gotten so many lawyers and scientists
[00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.400]  and doctors and people on board with the fraud that we'll all have mass Stockholm syndrome
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.560]  and accept it.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:21.160]  So here is the clip of the doctor talking about what's really happening.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.340]  This is life saving information.
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.240]  Take this report from freeworldnews.tv.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:27.240]  That's the URL.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.240]  They're not blocking as much.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.240]  And share it on your email.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.520]  Share it on your text message.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.680]  Share it via word of mouth.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:33.460]  Share it on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere else.
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:34.460]  Take clips out.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.460]  Whatever you want.
[00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:39.700]  Get it out there because this is a life and death situation.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.780]  Here is the report they don't want you to see.
[00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:50.900]  You spoke to a potential mechanism of action of the injury and you mentioned to me the
[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.380]  use of a D-dimer test, which we all know what it's for, but we're going to have to explain
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:55.380]  a little bit.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.780]  Could you please speak to this a little bit and give the relevant context and introduction
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.780]  please?
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.620]  Because I think this is really groundbreaking and important.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.620]  Yes.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:04.620]  Yeah.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.780]  Thank you.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:13.980]  So one of the key things that really bothered me when I started to see serious vaccine
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:20.580]  injuries in my own patients is that I had no idea what the mechanism of injury was.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:26.260]  And therefore, as their doctor, I had no idea how to treat it because, you know, as their
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:32.380]  family doctor, they would come to me for help and I needed to help them.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.380]  And I was clueless.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.060]  I mean, this was this is an experiment.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:42.100]  And I was aware that there was literally what we call iatrogenic disease, a medically induced
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.420]  disease being produced by this vaccine.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:49.780]  And so I had asked this in my open letter to Dr. Bonnie Henry, our provincial health
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:51.340]  officer.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:57.020]  What is the mechanism of injury and how do I treat this as these people's doctor?
[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.580]  And of course, nobody knew.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:06.420]  And the vaccine manufacturers had told us that the COVID spike protein does not go intravenous.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.980]  It stays in the arm.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:13.260]  The antibodies to the to the spike protein are produced in the arm.
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.300]  And that's what we had been found.
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:23.500]  But scientists now and Dr. Brody has actually very clearly revealed this, that only 25 percent
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.300]  of the vaccine actually stays in the arm and the rest of it.
[00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:36.060]  So these vaccines are a are a vast number of little messenger RNA strands.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:46.020]  The Moderna vaccine has 40 trillion messenger RNA molecules per vaccine dose, 40 trillion.
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:51.020]  So so so so these are wrapped in a little lipid capsule.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:54.460]  The lipid capsule is to enable them to be absorbed into the cells.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.100]  So this is injected into the person's arm and their deltoid muscle of the shoulder.
[00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:03.300]  From there, as I mentioned, only 25 percent actually stays there.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.460]  The rest is taken up, collected through the lymphatic system and fed into the general
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.820]  circulation.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.940]  And so it circulates around the entire body.
[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:17.740]  And I think every doctor knows that absorption from the the circulation occurs in capillary
[00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.340]  networks because that's where the blood slows right down.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.420]  So this is going through tiny, tiny vessels.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:34.500]  So these little nano capsules containing these trillions of messenger RNA molecules are absorbed
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:40.420]  into the lining around the capillaries, what medically we call the vascular endothelium.
[00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:46.580]  So so these little cap, these little packages are absorbed into the cells around the vessels.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.260]  The package is open.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:56.180]  The body recognizes these messenger RNA strands as as a gene and gets to work making COVID
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.460]  spike proteins.
[00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:03.660]  So in a virus, those COVID spike proteins form part of the viral capsule.
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.940]  But the problem is they're not in a virus.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.060]  They're in they're in the cells around blood vessels.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:15.700]  So as a result, they become part of the cell wall of that cell.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:23.820]  So normally the cells that surround your blood vessels have to be very, very smooth to enable
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.980]  good and and unimpeded flow of blood.
[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.380]  But as soon as you've got all these little spike proteins that become part of the cell
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.180]  wall, it's now a rough surface.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.180]  It's going to be like a very coarse sandpaper.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:43.620]  It's now what the platelets are going to interpret as a damaged vessel.
[00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:44.900]  It's no longer smooth.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.940]  It's rough.
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.180]  So clotting is inevitable because the platelets that come down that vessel are going to hit
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.340]  a rough spot and assume this must be a damaged vessel.
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:57.020]  This vessel needs to be blocked to stop the bleeding.
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.980]  That's how our clotting works.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:06.380]  So so so so clots are according because of this and because of the nature of this, clots
[00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:14.060]  are inevitable because of these these spike proteins in the capillary networks.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.740]  So I set out to then try and prove this.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.140]  Could this theory be correct?
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:26.140]  And so the problem is these little clots in the capillary networks are microscopic and
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:27.420]  they are scattered.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:29.900]  So they're not going to show on any scan.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.540]  They're just too small and too scattered.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.780]  It's not like the big clots that cause strokes or heart attacks.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.580]  They're too small and they're too scattered.
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.940]  So how on earth can we know if the person clotted?
[00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.900]  And the only way is with a blood test called a D-Dimer.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:51.500]  So the D-Dimer is a blood test that is that will show up a recent clot.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.140]  It won't show up an old clot.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:57.340]  It shows up a new clot and it doesn't tell you where the clot is.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:01.300]  It just tells you that the clotting mechanism has been activated.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.820]  So I have now been recruiting patients from my practice, people that have come into my
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:12.460]  office and others that have heard me speak about this and have asked people to do this
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.580]  D-Dimer within one week of their COVID shot.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.900]  And so far, and the study is ongoing, these are preliminary results.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:29.140]  So far, I've got 62% positive elevated D-Dimer, which means that the blood clots are not rare.
[00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:32.500]  That's what the so-called experts keep telling us.
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:37.500]  The clots are rare, the big ones are rare, but the small ones are clearly happening in
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:41.180]  the majority of people, 62%.
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:49.060]  Now I'll tell you what the real concern with this is, is that a clotted vessel is permanently
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.060]  damaged.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.780]  That vessel never, ever goes back to normal.
[00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.940]  So if this theory is correct, which it really looks like by these D-Dimer results, and I'm
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:04.020]  told it has been done in Australia and it's been done in the UK, and they also found elevated
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.700]  D-Dimers.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.820]  And they sort of discarded the information because they said there's no clinical evidence
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:11.820]  of clots.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.300]  Well, the clinical reading is because they're microscopic and they're scattered.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:21.540]  And so you're not going to see clinical evidence, but in fact, all of the frequent side effects
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:31.580]  of the shot, which are headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, could all be signs of cerebral thrombosis
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.140]  on a capillary level.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:39.540]  I mean, those literally, you could be having thousands and thousands of tiny, tiny little
[00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:46.780]  clots in your brain that won't show on a scan, but they will give you those exact symptoms.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:53.460]  So the concern is I have now got six people in my medical practice that cannot exert themselves
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:58.380]  the way they used to be, what medically we call reduced effort tolerance.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:04.460]  Six people who now get out of breath doing things that they could previously do without
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:06.020]  any problem.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:13.140]  So I believe that these people locked up thousands and thousands of capillaries in their lungs
[00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:14.500]  in these six people.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:21.940]  So I believe these people now have permanently damaged lungs because they have got, I mean,
[00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.220]  and that's why they get out of breath.
[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:28.300]  I have one fellow that used to walk two miles to my office every week for a shot for his
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.300]  arthritis.
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.660]  And he says after a quarter of a mile, he's done.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.820]  In other words, his effort tolerance is reduced to one eighth of what it used to be.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:42.340]  And so I've sent some of these people for chest x-rays and CT scans to see what it shows.
[00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:49.780]  And all it shows is distorted architecture, what the radiologist recorders describe as
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.140]  increased reticulation.
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:53.220]  It's a very nonspecific thing.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.580]  And it's because it's microscopic.
[00:46:55.580 --> 00:47:02.060]  It's just, but the concern is because these vessels are now permanently damaged in a person's
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:09.100]  lungs, when the heart tries to pump blood through all those damaged vessels, there's
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.140]  increased resistance trying to pump the blood through those lungs.
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:17.340]  So those people are going to develop something called pulmonary artery hypertension, high
[00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:19.420]  blood pressure in their lungs.
[00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:25.580]  And the concern with that is that those people will probably all develop right-sided heart
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:31.100]  failure within three years and die because they now have increased vascular resistance
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:38.140]  through their lungs and lung tissue and heart tissue and brain and spinal tissue and all
[00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.740]  of that does not regenerate.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:43.820]  In other tissues, it can regenerate liver and kidneys and muscle and other, but there's
[00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:45.740]  some tissues that cannot.
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:51.260]  And so this is this absolutely explains what I've seen in my patients.
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.700]  And that's what I'm doing to prove it.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.980]  And my study is ongoing.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:56.540]  What have I told you?
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:05.020]  There's a substance that is invisible to the naked eye, but it is more valuable than anything
[00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:11.580]  else on earth, more valuable than gold, more valuable than silver, more valuable than diamonds
[00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.700]  or rubies or emeralds or sapphires.
[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.620]  What would it be?
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.940]  Well, it's not a riddle, my friends.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.460]  It's called oxygen.
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:26.220]  And it's a trace gas that's getting lower and lower and lower on our planet.
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:31.260]  But there's other things that we have scarcity in like water.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.420]  That's becoming more and more scarce, fresh water.
[00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.060]  But what else is essential?
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:40.940]  Just as essential as clean water and oxygen to breathe.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.900]  Well, of course, my friends, it's iodine.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:50.060]  Iodine is one of the most important drivers in the body for fertility, for cellular function,
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.140]  for libido, for life.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:56.220]  If you don't have iodine, you die in a matter of months.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.100]  So if you don't have oxygen, you die in four minutes.
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.220]  If you don't have water, you die in a week or so.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.900]  If you don't have food, a month or so.
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.740]  But what's in that food?
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.700]  Iodine.
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:11.820]  But if your food doesn't have that atomic pure iodine, it can't operate.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.380]  And the food itself is lacking.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.980]  That's why most people on earth are deficient in iodine.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.580]  And governments are lowering the allowance you're supposedly need to have
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.740]  all the time because they want control.
