[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:28.000]  Texas Alex Jones look at the fruits of globalism look at what it does
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.080]  implode countries create giant masses of poor people and it operates via the
[00:35.080 --> 00:40.160]  hoax that the establishment wants to create prosperity when they want to
[00:40.160 --> 00:46.000]  create the exact opposite as a tool of control they are now talking about
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.880]  taking all of the money out of the people of Cyprus's bank accounts and why
[00:52.880 --> 00:56.840]  shouldn't they why shouldn't foreign mega banks do something like that to back
[00:56.840 --> 01:01.400]  up their own losses in the bond market because they have a paramilitary police
[01:01.400 --> 01:05.760]  force there that's just like a robber coming into the bank teller and saying
[01:05.760 --> 01:10.840]  hands up put the money in a bag if you want to live and the globalist have
[01:10.840 --> 01:17.160]  set up homeland security secret police apparatuses all over the world to be
[01:17.160 --> 01:23.800]  able to carry this program out against humanity that's what's happening and we
[01:23.800 --> 01:29.600]  sit here watching all of this come true in slow motion that in media motion now
[01:29.600 --> 01:36.280]  in fast motion and then it's speeding up to light speed right now and I will tell
[01:36.280 --> 01:39.360]  you and it's in the IMF World Bank document plans we've been warning you
[01:39.360 --> 01:47.200]  about for 12 years or 11 years since 2002 early 2002 that they do plan on doing
[01:47.200 --> 01:51.720]  this here and that's why they've announced oh the NSA and the Pentagon and
[01:51.720 --> 01:55.640]  the FBI and every other agency they're in your bank account live time watching
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.040]  everything you do see whatever happened to a warrant oh they got to stop drug
[02:00.040 --> 02:05.200]  trafficking when it's on record that the big six Federal Reserve banks launder
[02:05.200 --> 02:08.640]  almost all the drug money you hear about a smaller bank getting busted for drug
[02:08.640 --> 02:12.600]  money occasionally it's because they were laundering money of local cowboys
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.160]  local people you know shipping drugs in themselves which the establishment doesn't
[02:17.160 --> 02:22.080]  cotton to the war on drugs this is a no-brainer people still don't get this
[02:22.080 --> 02:27.000]  some of them is about making drugs illegal so you can boost the price of
[02:27.000 --> 02:33.600]  the black market and go after your competition selectively voila and I
[02:33.600 --> 02:39.520]  don't get how the public doesn't understand that I don't understand how
[02:39.520 --> 02:48.560]  that is the case I just it's a fact it's how the British brought down China over
[02:48.560 --> 02:52.760]  50 years because the Chinese government made opium illegal a couple hundred
[02:52.760 --> 02:56.400]  years ago and within 50 years they'd fully taken the country over via
[02:56.400 --> 03:02.600]  corruption you make drugs illegal it boosts the price and then you ship them
[03:02.600 --> 03:06.360]  in and then take control of the town cities and then districts and then
[03:06.360 --> 03:10.400]  finally China itself and then they have the Boxer rebellion against that and the
[03:10.400 --> 03:15.000]  rest of its history but absolutely hellish and this is the type of stuff
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.360]  being exercised upon us right now now obviously we've got an incredibly
[03:23.360 --> 03:27.160]  important broadcast lined up and I will cover all the news when we come back I
[03:27.160 --> 03:32.640]  did a rebroadcast yesterday on the Sunday show because it was Sunday I will be
[03:32.640 --> 03:36.680]  back next Sunday 4 to 6 live by the way I've done two Sundays tape just because
[03:36.680 --> 03:39.960]  a lot of stuff fell on those dates but I'll be back next Sunday 4 to 6 live

[03:48.400 --> 03:53.600]  then back Sunday and I just had a pretty interesting weekend here in Austin
[03:53.600 --> 04:00.840]  Texas with family we kind of had a mini family reunion out at a little hotel
[04:00.840 --> 04:05.040]  golf course resort we didn't play golf but that was where we went outside
[04:05.040 --> 04:11.200]  Austin have a very interesting story to tell about that we were all sitting in a
[04:11.200 --> 04:18.520]  hot tub myself and three local Austin business people by the pool at the
[04:18.520 --> 04:23.680]  hotel and I'll tell that story later I only bring that up because it was so
[04:23.680 --> 04:27.080]  amazing we were sitting there talking about bankrupting the dollar or the
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.040]  globalist takeover the plan to confiscate our firearms and and those
[04:31.040 --> 04:36.360]  guys sitting there for about 20 minutes while we were talking watching us and he
[04:36.360 --> 04:41.240]  got up and he said look we've taken over you're not gonna stop us it was a
[04:41.240 --> 04:46.400]  bizarre conversation but basically MSNBC he was regurgitating that but he was
[04:46.400 --> 04:50.880]  such an authoritarian and laughing at us saying our authoritarian takeovers here
[04:50.880 --> 04:55.480]  you can't stop us I'm gonna be breaking that down and a lot more today the latest

[07:10.400 --> 07:15.600]  as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of
[07:15.600 --> 07:19.680]  what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of

[08:06.600 --> 08:11.240]  live to the central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance
[08:11.240 --> 08:22.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show it is April 1st 2013 I am your host
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.640]  Alex Jones are going to be live here for the next three hours we had him on
[08:25.640 --> 08:29.120]  for about 20 minutes last week I'm getting him on for a full hour always
[08:29.120 --> 08:33.360]  interesting Dr. Chief Steve Pachinick is going to be with us in the third hour
[08:33.360 --> 08:37.280]  we will open the phones up so you can have a chance to to ask him a few
[08:37.280 --> 08:40.760]  questions during that period we're also going to have open phones in the first
[08:40.760 --> 08:47.280]  and second hour today interspersed with the news and information but here's what
[08:47.280 --> 08:52.920]  I want to say just out of the gates just as North Korea lacks the technical
[08:52.920 --> 08:57.720]  ability to manufacture a automobile just as North Korea lacks the technical
[08:57.720 --> 09:02.600]  capability to feed its own population just as North Korea and authoritarianism
[09:02.600 --> 09:07.280]  in its purest form creates total collapse of human civilization the total
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.640]  state is the collapse of everything but those that wish to inhabit the total
[09:12.640 --> 09:16.760]  state always have such a relish for dominating and controlling that they
[09:16.760 --> 09:23.520]  can't allow anyone in their system to be free or open so the society rots but
[09:23.520 --> 09:30.080]  just as the West not just China but the West ABB the Swiss company that was
[09:30.080 --> 09:34.480]  headed up by Donald Rumsfeld at the time in 1996 transferred the nuclear
[09:34.480 --> 09:41.360]  reactors sold them to them so they could produce fissile material for atomic and
[09:41.360 --> 09:47.080]  hydrogen bombs and that's on record that the West armed North Korea it's on
[09:47.080 --> 09:51.720]  record the West has moved our entire industrial capacity and capability to a
[09:51.720 --> 09:57.680]  large extent to the third world and predominantly China it is a fact that we
[09:57.680 --> 10:03.360]  have been economically slowly strangled and culturally strangled when you turn
[10:03.360 --> 10:09.800]  on the television not just TV news but any other system of establishment media
[10:09.800 --> 10:16.280]  films entertainment you name it it is all anti-liberty anti-human anti-freedom
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.680]  messages so that the United States can be fully broken the globalists have
[10:20.680 --> 10:26.160]  always hated America because we were resistant to tyrants and we became the
[10:26.160 --> 10:31.160]  example of liberty worldwide and and the the opposite of authoritarian
[10:31.160 --> 10:36.920]  centralization doesn't mean America has a perfect history but the idea of rugged
[10:36.920 --> 10:42.480]  individualism is anathema to the enemy so we are not just to be broken down we
[10:42.480 --> 10:47.800]  are to be broken completely and quote reeducated that's why our food and water
[10:47.800 --> 10:52.080]  is poisoned it's why we're dumbed down it's why they lie all across the country
[10:52.080 --> 10:56.880]  and say it's the law to take vaccines and the new Canadian numbers just came
[10:56.880 --> 11:03.920]  out one in 55 children have autism they're killing us I was talking to the
[11:03.920 --> 11:07.920]  lead singer of anthrax last night I'm gonna get him on by the way guys you've
[11:07.920 --> 11:11.840]  got to remind me his numbers in there in my phone I forgot to give it to you as
[11:11.840 --> 11:16.400]  I was out to dinner with Dave Mustaine and I was also at dinner with the lead
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.200]  singer of disturbed I'm not name-dropping the point is is that Dave was
[11:21.200 --> 11:26.720]  staying at my house this weekend here visiting because they're moving to Texas
[11:26.720 --> 11:30.440]  and I've known Dave for years but he's been out here looking at houses staying
[11:30.440 --> 11:35.320]  at my house off and on with his wife and daughter and his son comes to visit but
[11:35.320 --> 11:38.720]  you know he comes out as well and it's just they're all awake to the New World
[11:38.720 --> 11:43.440]  Order now and he was saying most people he knows in the music industry are awake
[11:43.440 --> 11:47.720]  to the New World Order but then it's the higher ups the management and people
[11:47.720 --> 11:53.440]  that are there basically pushing the establishment line and you know trying to
[11:53.440 --> 11:58.000]  not allow anybody to be successful who doesn't tow the line with the New World
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.680]  Order that's why you see people coming out who were anti who have been pro
[12:03.680 --> 12:07.880]  gun like solicitors to loan and I saw his quote last week a month ago he said
[12:07.880 --> 12:11.800]  restrict guns I saw the quote last week up as we pull that up for me again and
[12:11.800 --> 12:14.800]  he said look just get ready to turn them in we're gonna have to go to people's
[12:14.800 --> 12:19.000]  houses and take them see they're trying to break the ice here and just get you
[12:19.000 --> 12:26.800]  prepared to have your guns taken it's it's really happening and what am I
[12:26.800 --> 12:32.880]  getting at here authoritarianism is real and it will overrun you like a
[12:32.880 --> 12:38.160]  staff infection like a cancer it will overrun you like a person being fed
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.600]  into a wood chip or feet first and the pain is real the tyranny is real the
[12:43.600 --> 12:47.840]  the wealth the liberty is pouring out of us like someone who's had their legs
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.960]  chopped off and we've got to admit that this is happening to get tourniquets
[12:51.960 --> 12:57.800]  tied around our knees or we're gonna bleed out which is the plan and again
[12:57.800 --> 13:03.320]  we're not a person who can't regenerate their legs we can rise like the Phoenix
[13:03.320 --> 13:08.320]  the idea of liberty can do that but we're bleeding to death right now we're
[13:08.320 --> 13:11.560]  going into shock right now and the globalists are doing everything they
[13:11.560 --> 13:17.400]  can to push us beneath the water to to to to fully salt the earth of this
[13:17.400 --> 13:21.960]  republic and if you look at what big government has to offer if you look at
[13:21.960 --> 13:25.720]  the cult of government or people that work for government or corporations that
[13:25.720 --> 13:32.360]  are associated with it feel this reflected glory and sense of power
[13:32.360 --> 13:41.920]  through the system that's what they're doing and I run into people who say to
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.680]  me we are taking over we are the collectivist and you have failed and you
[13:46.680 --> 13:50.920]  are weak and you are pathetic and and and I don't take what you say is serious
[13:50.920 --> 13:55.880]  I don't listen to you you don't count and it's a mind game like Carl Rove
[13:55.880 --> 14:00.360]  telling reporters I control history I control reality I'll change reality
[14:00.360 --> 14:05.880]  tomorrow and you will dutifully conform yourself to that because I am the
[14:05.880 --> 14:11.560]  establishment I am basically God and we've seen Robert Gibbs make similar
[14:11.560 --> 14:15.240]  statements about how we lie to the public on things that are verifiably
[14:15.240 --> 14:22.720]  provable and on record and then laughed at everyone you know when he talked
[14:22.720 --> 14:25.800]  about the drone program exists for many years but I get up there and tell
[14:25.800 --> 14:29.520]  people in press conferences it doesn't exist and then the media plays along with
[14:29.520 --> 14:35.280]  that I remember at the time and said okay it doesn't exist that's what I'm
[14:35.280 --> 14:40.200]  getting at here is you either revolt mentally psychologically spiritually
[14:40.200 --> 14:45.080]  and make a break with these people or we become North Korea because in North
[14:45.080 --> 14:48.880]  Korea you watch the mass rallies and you know the inner party members that come
[14:48.880 --> 14:52.320]  out and that's only a few percentage of the population that are even allowed in
[14:52.320 --> 14:56.000]  the major capital controlled cities the other people don't even know where they
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.560]  are they're basically living two centuries ago the men and women are put
[15:00.560 --> 15:06.320]  in cages when they're in estrus when the women are like you breed animals and
[15:06.320 --> 15:10.800]  then the babies are taken at birth and sent to government facilities to be
[15:10.800 --> 15:14.320]  basically trained for whatever specialized area they're in and they've
[15:14.320 --> 15:20.920]  destroyed the basic human system there North Korea is a globalist communist
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.440]  laboratory of destroying humanity of a boot stomping on the human face forever
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.680]  and and look it's a third-generation little fat pudgy weak coward who grew up
[15:31.680 --> 15:38.080]  in the most luxury boarding school in the world for his entire life and obsessed
[15:38.080 --> 15:41.920]  with Hollywood and entertainment and then now he's the dictator over people
[15:41.920 --> 15:47.760]  threatening to nuke Austin Texas where I live and they can't even get a ICBM off
[15:47.760 --> 15:55.720]  the launch pad their medium-range missiles are our our our our our rotting
[15:55.720 --> 16:02.200]  jokes but still the globalist who retirees themselves needed as the
[16:02.200 --> 16:14.520]  supposed threat so my point is if you don't refuse to absolutely break with
[16:14.520 --> 16:20.800]  these people and if you don't refuse to buy any of their garbage and and really
[16:20.800 --> 16:25.840]  hate them and disdain them and speak out against them continually you will be
[16:25.840 --> 16:32.680]  dominated by a horde of locusts on power trips who are useful idiots who are in
[16:32.680 --> 16:38.880]  some type of mass mob zombie psychology to overrun free societies and dominate
[16:38.880 --> 16:46.360]  them listen the establishment is going to take everything we've got because we
[16:46.360 --> 16:58.160]  have gotten in a broken position we have put ourselves in a position of a broken
[16:58.160 --> 17:04.960]  prostitute who got off the bus when she was 17 a runaway you know from Kansas in
[17:04.960 --> 17:12.160]  someplace like Los Angeles or from Illinois and she gets off the you know
[17:12.160 --> 17:15.680]  the bus and wants to be a movie star because the narcissism of television in
[17:15.680 --> 17:20.400]  the culture she buys into that and she goes out to Hollywood and two years
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.840]  later she's been all used up with cigarette burns all over addicted to
[17:24.840 --> 17:28.040]  heroin because they addicted her to get control of her and then she's just
[17:28.040 --> 17:34.160]  found dead in the back alley America is this is just like that woman just like
[17:34.160 --> 17:39.240]  that young girl we buy into the culture we buy into the Madison Avenue we buy
[17:39.240 --> 17:44.120]  into the Hollywood we buy into the Kim Kardashian we buy into the fact that
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.120]  we're not whole unless we go to this undiscovered grasses greener Hollywood
[17:50.120 --> 17:56.360]  imaginary system and all it is is a weaponized construct really created by
[17:56.360 --> 18:01.400]  Edward Bernays about 90 years ago is when they really started setting it up as
[18:01.400 --> 18:07.320]  a Department of War program to not just take over America but the world and
[18:07.320 --> 18:11.280]  Bernays wrote books about it there's countless books I mean I mean that's a
[18:11.280 --> 18:15.520]  fact it's always been a tool of propaganda it's just that they couldn't
[18:15.520 --> 18:20.880]  sell their program as hardcore back then as they are now because people wouldn't
[18:20.880 --> 18:24.760]  buy into it they had to do it by incremental moves and now when you turn
[18:24.760 --> 18:30.480]  on the television the ads the news the sitcoms the dramas all of it is high-tech
[18:30.480 --> 18:35.440]  propaganda selling you that if you'll sign on to globalism if you'll sign on
[18:35.440 --> 18:39.920]  to turning your guns in open borders and high taxes on the rich really the
[18:39.920 --> 18:43.840]  middle class to transfer the money offshore that somehow the economy will
[18:43.840 --> 18:51.360]  get kick-started again and instead all we're doing is sticking our legs deeper
[18:51.360 --> 18:54.960]  down the wood chipper we look at this article that just went up at info wars
[18:54.960 --> 19:02.720]  dot com World War Z scene changed to please Chinese sensors we've gone in
[19:02.720 --> 19:06.640]  ten years from criticizing China with forced abortion and infanticide and
[19:06.640 --> 19:15.120]  suicide nets and fall on gong to our media from the new red dawn to the new
[19:15.120 --> 19:23.720]  World War Z not even allowing you know to show an outbreak starting in China and
[19:23.720 --> 19:27.280]  that and I've read the book that's that you that's how it starts it's all a big
[19:27.280 --> 19:31.080]  martial law conditioning program it promotes world government it promotes
[19:31.080 --> 19:35.840]  Marxism in the book it says that the that the that the collectivist ultimate
[19:35.840 --> 19:39.800]  enemy is American gun owners who are exterminated and actually are thankful
[19:39.800 --> 19:45.000]  for the zombies killing the American people the enemy of the UN and the UN
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.760]  is the good guy so again this is a UN propaganda film you got the communist
[19:50.760 --> 19:54.640]  Chinese government openly saying take American people's guns and then they
[19:54.640 --> 19:58.880]  now dictate what's in these propaganda films of course they do it's global

[24:24.480 --> 24:29.000]  blanket amnesty in the North American Union's complete establishment that's
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.200]  what this amnesty deal is it will absolutely bankrupt the country and
[24:33.200 --> 24:38.040]  drive the wages down to nothing which is the open gold of the UN and the
[24:38.040 --> 24:44.400]  globalist but I want to say something here I see things for what they are from
[24:44.400 --> 24:49.960]  a historical perspective if what was going on right now was happening 200
[24:49.960 --> 24:56.280]  years ago you would say America and the West has been conquered by a private
[24:56.280 --> 25:02.400]  combine and that's what the British East India Company did they conquered most of
[25:02.400 --> 25:07.640]  China and they conquered India and they were in control of India for close to
[25:07.640 --> 25:14.560]  300 years the British East India Company it was also the Dutch East India
[25:14.560 --> 25:20.360]  Company they basically merged later but the point is and that's the Queen of
[25:20.360 --> 25:26.000]  England and the Queen of the Netherlands as well that's British Petroleum Dutch
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.480]  Royal Shell today is just part of it and both of those families wealth is our
[25:31.480 --> 25:37.160]  national secrets these are people that sat on top of the world imperial wealth
[25:37.160 --> 25:42.040]  and so we talk about world government it's not the new world order it's the
[25:42.040 --> 25:49.800]  old world order and they have conquered China the US government at the end of
[25:49.800 --> 25:58.480]  World War two 1949 put Mao Zedong into power and the communist Chinese over
[25:58.480 --> 26:06.000]  there have made deals with literal slave factories no environmental laws no
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.160]  insurance no regulations the parents chain their children you can type this
[26:10.160 --> 26:15.800]  in children in China chain the lamppost where they may get one meal a day
[26:15.800 --> 26:20.600]  while their parents work up to 24 hours and the little children sit there and
[26:20.600 --> 26:25.320]  go to the bathroom over the side of the curb in the dirt road and they chain
[26:25.320 --> 26:29.400]  their children I'm talking three-year-olds four-year-olds two poles now
[26:29.400 --> 26:33.120]  soon as they're five or six they're ready imagine they want to go work in a
[26:33.120 --> 26:39.560]  slave factory because that's better than being chained to a pole all day you
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.800]  don't know why folks come here from China and work so hard and get you know
[26:42.800 --> 26:45.960]  top of their class a pluses and all the rest of it because they've lived in
[26:45.960 --> 26:50.320]  literal hell there it is heartbreaking pictures of Chinese toddlers tied up all
[26:50.320 --> 26:53.040]  day because their parents can't afford child care let's scroll down and show
[26:53.040 --> 26:58.840]  that okay that there's a famous photo from like three years ago that shows a
[26:58.840 --> 27:05.080]  road with a fence on it a chain link cyclone fence and there's hundreds of
[27:05.080 --> 27:09.920]  kids chained up okay now you think when they put an agenda 21 that basically
[27:09.920 --> 27:16.120]  makes it impossible for us to operate businesses here with inspectors you know
[27:16.120 --> 27:22.600]  on purpose removing the authorization to build say a deck on your restaurant on
[27:22.600 --> 27:28.960]  South Congress you spend $500,000 to build it it's a total specs and they
[27:28.960 --> 27:33.480]  come in withdraw it and order you to tear it apart my lawyer Eric tab beat them
[27:33.480 --> 27:37.320]  locally for that local bar and restaurant I mean I mean that's just an
[27:37.320 --> 27:41.840]  example and it was the only time the city had been beaten in the last decade or
[27:41.840 --> 27:48.240]  something it's about ruining you and making sure no one can operate in
[27:48.240 --> 27:52.720]  America or Europe or Canada or New Zealand or Australia unless they're
[27:52.720 --> 27:57.160]  insiders if you're a big insider oil company you can dump toxic waste right
[27:57.160 --> 28:00.920]  in the river if you're general electric you don't have to even run a clean
[28:00.920 --> 28:05.440]  power plant and your competition is totally clean they're shut down this is
[28:05.440 --> 28:11.080]  all on record you're a big globalist company you're exempt from Obamacare and
[28:11.080 --> 28:16.400]  they're hiring bureaucrats that hate our guts they are imploding us put look this
[28:16.400 --> 28:18.800]  is what I'm trying to get at before we come back and really get into the big
[28:18.800 --> 28:25.320]  news China now owns the majority of our supposed debt but if you look at it
[28:25.320 --> 28:29.960]  Americans have been signed on over 600 trillion of the 1.5 quadrillion global
[28:29.960 --> 28:34.200]  that's not even our debt so China owns most the 16 trillion dollar debt or the
[28:34.200 --> 28:37.720]  largest piece that Americans really do owe in the government you notice
[28:37.720 --> 28:41.280]  government wants to bankrupt things as fast as possible because 16 trillion is
[28:41.280 --> 28:44.960]  not that much when you realize the faith and credit of this country that's still
[28:44.960 --> 28:49.920]  left they're just telling you now all this debt is yours and then pointing at
[28:49.920 --> 28:53.720]  the welfare class as if they got us into this debt when the welfare class is a
[28:53.720 --> 28:57.120]  very small percentage of this but I'm still against it because it's very
[28:57.120 --> 29:01.080]  dangerous and they now feel like they're part of the state they've never done
[29:01.080 --> 29:05.600]  anything in their life we pay their salaries the welfare class the governing
[29:05.600 --> 29:11.240]  class all of them but they don't care because they are on a power trip through
[29:11.240 --> 29:16.480]  government so now every Hollywood movie doesn't just have to get Pentagon
[29:16.480 --> 29:21.680]  approval and all this other government approval at the highest levels there's
[29:21.680 --> 29:26.320]  no law that's just how it is now we have to get approval if there's any
[29:26.320 --> 29:32.080]  criticism I mean I've seen cases with spider-man and Batman and stuff where
[29:32.080 --> 29:37.080]  there's just one Chinese police officer is shown as corrupt so they have to
[29:37.080 --> 29:40.920]  edit it imagine the American people don't have any special interests working
[29:40.920 --> 29:45.920]  for us but foreign communists that run giant death camps now control our
[29:45.920 --> 29:52.080]  media we'll talk about it when we come back we're on the march the empires on

[34:42.440 --> 34:47.960]  authoritarian wildly abusive and you don't even hear that in the news anymore
[34:47.960 --> 34:56.920]  and it's because globalism has taken over the globalists are now able to not
[34:56.920 --> 35:00.040]  just have the foreign IMF and World Bank and fellow reserve control our
[35:00.040 --> 35:06.200]  currency our credit and the nation's credit rating and future and sign us
[35:06.200 --> 35:10.080]  onto their debt through economic conquest as they're doing other countries
[35:10.080 --> 35:16.640]  they have teamed up with the communist Chinese with a billion 300 plus million
[35:16.640 --> 35:26.760]  people who are a eugenics death panel society as as as as collectivist and you
[35:26.760 --> 35:33.600]  know basically barbarous as you can get and now they have movies coming out
[35:33.600 --> 35:42.360]  where the UN is exterminating not just zombies but any humans that won't
[35:42.360 --> 35:47.880]  accept global government and it's called World War Z and the communist
[35:47.880 --> 35:56.040]  Chinese don't like the fact that the outbreak happens in China and so that's
[35:56.040 --> 36:04.760]  been edited so that the Communist Party is happy I mean of course they told me
[36:04.760 --> 36:08.520]  we couldn't hand out magazines anywhere in downtown Austin a few weeks ago of
[36:08.520 --> 36:13.200]  course they said we can't have in full wars comm on our car now the police
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.440]  with straight faces riding tickets of course the police chief where I live
[36:18.440 --> 36:24.560]  says ban you know semi-autos or anything with 10 round mags as a start and
[36:24.560 --> 36:28.720]  don't have private sales because they want to confiscate them of course we
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.080]  live in authoritarianism you don't get a job now unless you're going to do with
[36:33.080 --> 36:38.760]  the authoritarian say and it's always going to be more by increment and and
[36:38.760 --> 36:49.160]  here I sit in America and the communist Chinese under just direct words said you
[36:49.160 --> 36:55.040]  can't have red dawn showing communist Chinese invading via Mexico were by the
[36:55.040 --> 37:00.320]  way the Chinese military is massing but it won't be the Chinese invading us
[37:00.320 --> 37:06.160]  they'll be invited in under globalism I mean they actually have drills like in
[37:06.160 --> 37:16.160]  le 9 10 11 under FEMA in 2009 10 and 11 where the Chinese military openly
[37:16.160 --> 37:20.720]  trained along with 15 other countries to quote take on domestic extremist and
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.240]  then we got the training manuals wrote articles about it and it was to go after
[37:25.240 --> 37:30.480]  gun owners our military and and and the 5th branch homeland security operating
[37:30.480 --> 37:35.760]  domestically trains now and says in the news this is now headlines to take on
[37:35.760 --> 37:40.520]  gun owning conservative libertarian returning veterans and quote white men
[37:40.520 --> 37:47.480]  and see that's the unifying thing collectivism anti-gun anti-family just
[37:47.480 --> 37:54.400]  say it's anti-white and then sell it as racial branding and you turn on MSNBC
[37:54.400 --> 37:58.800]  I mean this is so over-the-top ladies and gentlemen I can't even believe it and
[37:58.800 --> 38:02.960]  they say if you don't support everything the collectivists are doing if you don't
[38:02.960 --> 38:06.400]  support banker bailouts if you don't support turning your guns in if you
[38:06.400 --> 38:10.440]  don't support total open borders if you don't support massive tax increases you
[38:10.440 --> 38:15.920]  are a racist people say well I don't buy into that propaganda it doesn't matter
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.280]  they are selling it as politically correct to the minorities that are
[38:20.280 --> 38:26.040]  really the majority that it is good and they aren't good people if they don't
[38:26.040 --> 38:33.520]  dislike white people I mean this is open organized divide and conquer and of
[38:33.520 --> 38:37.600]  course the ultra-rich white people and others that own and run this they're
[38:37.600 --> 38:40.640]  never gonna be touched they're never gonna know it's all about getting all
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.960]  of us while they implode the economy while they bring down our society getting
[38:44.960 --> 38:49.200]  us all fighting with each other where we see what color we are or what region
[38:49.200 --> 38:55.840]  we're from as the only issue and not hey why is 85 billion a month in a robbery
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.360]  because they're gonna make us pay this back in taxes and regulations and
[39:00.360 --> 39:04.520]  inflation why is that going to the private Federal Reserve and more than half
[39:04.520 --> 39:10.320]  of that to foreign European banks I mean that's on record that half the 85
[39:10.320 --> 39:14.880]  billion roughly or a little more than half goes to foreign European banks but
[39:14.880 --> 39:18.920]  the Federal Reserve will not tell the Senate and House Banking Committee where
[39:18.920 --> 39:25.800]  the money goes I could play you the intro from the Obama deception where the
[39:25.800 --> 39:30.240]  different senators are selling tell us where the bailout money went no I won't
[39:30.240 --> 39:35.160]  tell you says Ben Bernanke no I won't tell you says the Treasury Secretary at
[39:35.160 --> 39:39.280]  the time Paulson and it's the same thing every week if you watch the hearings
[39:39.280 --> 39:43.620]  every month it's the same story I live in a country where the Communist
[39:43.620 --> 39:49.920]  Chinese who own the biggest factories in the world and are billionaires every
[39:49.920 --> 39:54.120]  one of the interparty members up team billionaires living in giant fortress
[39:54.120 --> 39:59.840]  palaces helicoptering out to their weekend retreats with giant greenhouses
[39:59.840 --> 40:06.120]  obsessively with only the purest non GMO seeds and water that's even in the news
[40:06.120 --> 40:11.760]  Communist Chinese insiders you know eat organic food are obsessed with it they
[40:11.760 --> 40:16.480]  don't take the vaccines they don't eat the GMO they they are a eugenics
[40:16.480 --> 40:21.120]  operation there to kill their own people there to enslave their own people
[40:21.120 --> 40:26.400]  ahead of the robots replacing them all and China is the place where all the GMO
[40:26.400 --> 40:33.720]  human cloning genetic engineering cross species half plant animal humanoids
[40:33.720 --> 40:37.920]  animals cows that produce human milk they had that eight years ago
[40:37.920 --> 40:42.640]  Reese's monkey pets that glow in the dark that are part jellyfish that's 15
[40:42.640 --> 40:47.320]  years ago I mean it you know Pepsi factories with human fetal cells
[40:47.320 --> 40:53.360]  flavoring I mean this is all on record just beyond Blade Runner and we're here
[40:53.360 --> 40:58.720]  in America watching sitcoms watching dramas we're in every sitcom and every
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.040]  drama and every cop show and every thriller every one of them you're
[41:03.040 --> 41:08.440]  listening to watch TV out there you know this is true every show if you don't
[41:08.440 --> 41:12.880]  like vaccines you're a terrorist child molester if you if you care about guns
[41:12.880 --> 41:18.760]  you're secretly al-Qaeda if you're white you're all secretly racist total just
[41:18.760 --> 41:24.360]  every show the father's scum men are dumb men are foolish men women run
[41:24.360 --> 41:29.280]  everything I mean this is full-on war how do you think the globalist would
[41:29.280 --> 41:33.160]  bring in world authoritarianism they do it like they're doing it right now and
[41:33.160 --> 41:38.120]  does that tell you how important this broadcast is I talked to dr. Pachennick
[41:38.120 --> 41:45.600]  and I talked to other big insiders I talked to I don't have time to do it
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.520]  now every day it's incredible I'm not bragging I'm saying I haven't even
[41:50.520 --> 41:54.880]  realized who we are and how important this broadcast is and I'll be quite
[41:54.880 --> 41:58.680]  honest by the grace of God and your prayers are we even alive and on the
[41:58.680 --> 42:04.080]  air right now but there's coming a time when the globalists probably are just
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.400]  so arrogant on the open they're not going to care they'll want to smash Alex
[42:07.400 --> 42:11.560]  Jones right in front of you because because it's just I mean they're now
[42:11.560 --> 42:15.560]  saying we took 10% we took 40% now we may just take a hundred percent of
[42:15.560 --> 42:20.160]  everybody's bank accounts and it turns out the president of Cyprus you know the
[42:20.160 --> 42:25.160]  leaders of their parliament all the insiders months ago got all their money
[42:25.160 --> 42:33.040]  out of course they did I mean if you're a maid who saved their whole life or a
[42:33.040 --> 42:36.240]  schoolteacher now they're saying well you know what we just took 40% of your
[42:36.240 --> 42:39.480]  money you know I think we're going to take 60 and maybe everything and they
[42:39.480 --> 42:44.880]  won't let you get your money out of your bank account they're going to take
[42:44.880 --> 42:49.880]  everything folks Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny you will live
[42:49.880 --> 42:54.000]  under is the exact level that you will accept I told you they were going to
[42:54.000 --> 42:57.200]  take everything out of your bank account I told you they were going to bankrupt
[42:57.200 --> 43:01.200]  every sitting in the United States and put it under emergency receivership to
[43:01.200 --> 43:05.360]  the globalists that created the fake debt bubble and got your cities to invest
[43:05.360 --> 43:11.080]  in bad derivatives they wanted the cities to invest in derivatives then hold
[43:11.080 --> 43:15.600]  everyone hostage saying too big to fail all the pension funds all the city funds
[43:15.600 --> 43:29.720]  all the county all the funds will go under if you don't prop all of this up
[43:31.000 --> 43:37.160]  and then you you sign on to the 1.5 quidrelium globally and then your
[43:37.160 --> 43:40.920]  cities go bankrupt anyways because it was designed to they sold the cities
[43:40.920 --> 43:44.840]  the counties the cop pension funds the firefighter pension funds they sold
[43:44.840 --> 43:50.760]  everybody this stuff because they had to destroy you to make you dependent they
[43:50.760 --> 43:55.360]  there's so much wealth in a free society in a free market the the IMF and
[43:55.360 --> 43:59.000]  World Bank and XM Bank all they talk about is getting rid of wealth that's
[43:59.000 --> 44:03.680]  privately held killing overheating economies as they call it if we have a
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.480]  4% growth rate they call it overheating but China can have a 14 15% they don't
[44:08.480 --> 44:11.600]  call it overheating because the globalists have overheated it with
[44:11.600 --> 44:16.800]  slave labor that centralized the wealth transfer didn't go to the people to burn
[44:16.800 --> 44:21.280]  out the rest of the world's economic system there was China at sometimes with
[44:21.280 --> 44:29.840]  14% on average 11% growth rates according to Western cook numbers that kept
[44:29.840 --> 44:33.200]  it down because they were using our numbers to crunch it more like 25% growth
[44:33.200 --> 44:39.920]  rates red hot white hot economy that was only a economic military system to
[44:39.920 --> 44:45.600]  shut us down you know I was telling my wife this morning I said you know
[44:45.600 --> 44:49.880]  sometimes to see something super far away is almost bad because as it gets
[44:49.880 --> 44:54.480]  closer to you you become comfortable with it and get over your concern and
[44:54.480 --> 44:58.400]  and the fight or flight instinct to actually do something so I saw the ship
[44:58.400 --> 45:03.560]  over the horizon you know with basically spidey sense historical sense was
[45:03.560 --> 45:07.280]  even that it's just out in the open radar but for the general blind public I
[45:07.280 --> 45:11.960]  saw it over the horizon and I warned everybody just two plus two equals four
[45:11.960 --> 45:16.400]  and they said that was a conspiracy theory and now the New World Order ship
[45:16.400 --> 45:22.920]  is turned is broad-sighting us we're on fire but the public has gotten so
[45:22.920 --> 45:30.360]  comfortable with it but even myself I saw it coming 20 years ago and so now
[45:30.360 --> 45:35.480]  it's here and it's going to get even closer you mean I mean you know they're
[45:35.480 --> 45:39.600]  only firing for the first time now you know say they're a galleon a pirate
[45:39.600 --> 45:42.760]  galleon they're only doing their first broadside right now trying to take out
[45:42.760 --> 45:46.480]  our rudders and our main mast they're going to come back around wreck the other
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.200]  side we don't even know we're under attack we're drooling drunk on TV and
[45:51.200 --> 45:54.960]  culture on the deck we've been psychologically warfare it into just
[45:54.960 --> 45:58.720]  jellyfish you know spinelessness next they're gonna come up and throw tow
[45:58.720 --> 46:03.800]  cables on and they're gonna come on board folks and they're gonna throw us
[46:03.800 --> 46:10.000]  all in the ocean there's your daily analogy and I'm looking across while
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.920]  they're you know reloading these big guns and then cannons are jumping in
[46:14.920 --> 46:22.960]  their tackle and I can see their eyes now and they are crazed with daggers in
[46:22.960 --> 46:28.240]  their teeth and sabers in their hands and pistols all loaded in the in their
[46:28.240 --> 46:31.960]  baskets and I'm going we got to do something the communist Chinese now
[46:31.960 --> 46:35.880]  run our media homeland security is openly saying Al Qaeda is not the threat
[46:35.880 --> 46:42.080]  it's white-gut owners I mean it is just biblical what is preparing to unfold and
[46:42.080 --> 46:47.400]  then I'm talking to all these different former high-level people in
[46:47.400 --> 46:52.280]  government and current ones and they tell me that they go to CFR meetings and
[46:52.280 --> 46:58.280]  they go to Pentagon meetings and most the people there are listeners and are all
[46:58.280 --> 47:01.160]  upset about what's happening and they don't know what to do you don't know
[47:01.160 --> 47:06.240]  what to do you listen to my show and you're just quote glad I'm there glad
[47:06.240 --> 47:10.760]  I'm here I'm going hey pirate ship it's firing on us and you're all going yeah
[47:10.760 --> 47:13.840]  you're right Ben Alex you're great you recognize the pirate ship right as a
[47:13.840 --> 47:22.040]  cannonball takes off somebody's head and it's because the public is so soft and
[47:22.040 --> 47:30.320]  so stupid even people that want to do something at this point we've just got
[47:30.320 --> 47:35.120]  to dig in and try to salvage something and just get the word out as fast as we
[47:35.120 --> 47:39.520]  can as things begin to implode so that people understand why all this is going
[47:39.520 --> 47:44.360]  to happen but
[47:48.000 --> 47:55.760]  to now know that they are openly announcing plans in Congress to start
[47:55.760 --> 48:01.280]  going over the bank accounts stealing our money
[48:01.280 --> 48:11.760]  virtual added taxes token taxes well-haired taxes and the design is to
[48:11.760 --> 48:17.600]  destroy us we are being conquered we're under total psychological warfare and
[48:17.600 --> 48:23.440]  economic bombardment the government has been shipping drugs in as fast as they
[48:23.440 --> 48:30.480]  could in distributing them since the 40s and now they finally got in America so
[48:30.480 --> 48:36.640]  culturally rotten and so decadent and so disconnected that people have become
[48:36.640 --> 48:43.120]  nihilistic and you know say well then fine let it all collapse even though they
[48:43.120 --> 48:48.440]  don't know what it'll be like once it really collapses there's this day is you
[48:48.440 --> 48:54.480]  know joking attitude with some people out there that you know so what
[48:54.480 --> 49:04.640]  this is all real folks it's all now happening exactly as we said and I'm
[49:04.640 --> 49:09.240]  not pleased by that it'd be like if I was up in the crow's nest and I said you
[49:09.240 --> 49:13.320]  know use the ship analogy you know looks like a big galleon the one that got
[49:13.320 --> 49:18.680]  stolen a year ago off of his Spaniola why you know by my eye I've seen that
[49:18.680 --> 49:24.520]  ship before before it was taken by pirates looks like blackbeard ship and
[49:24.520 --> 49:29.480]  the pennant at the top looks black I think I see white on it I believe it's
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.920]  the Jolly Roger makes sail and they're like what's make sale and then now the
[49:34.920 --> 49:38.920]  pirate ship is right there with a big black flag skull and crossbones on it
[49:38.920 --> 49:45.400]  man taking us down hammering us hard hammering us hard and you see all the
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.080]  traitors it's so painful to see all the traitors showing who they are all the
[49:49.080 --> 49:54.440]  big Protestant Catholic churches police chiefs that have been pro guns saying
[49:54.440 --> 49:59.680]  turn your guns in the great time of evil is here and when we come back I'll
[49:59.680 --> 50:02.360]  briefly tell the story start the next hour and take your calls and get into
[50:02.360 --> 50:07.480]  all this news again I had family in town this weekend and kind of a small family
[50:07.480 --> 50:16.760]  reunion out at a little you know a resort outside Austin and I went to that and
[50:16.760 --> 50:21.200]  I was there about half the time because I had company at my house and I just was
[50:21.200 --> 50:26.080]  in the hot tub and all three of these guys were listeners one guy was from
[50:26.080 --> 50:30.760]  Portland Oregon an engineer the other two were businessmen because one was a
[50:30.760 --> 50:34.000]  construction the other was another kind of business I forget we've had a
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.440]  discussion about how do we fix America how do we wake folks up to the bank
[50:37.440 --> 50:44.200]  erupting you know the banks stealing the money and Cyprus Cyprus and this guy
[50:44.200 --> 50:48.240]  gets out of the pool and looks at us and says we're gonna get you and you can't
[50:48.240 --> 50:53.160]  stop us it was just so creepy like it was a pirate right there you know the
[50:53.160 --> 50:57.520]  natural thing to do man these people are dangerous they're dangerous and they

[54:29.960 --> 54:35.000]  destroyed by design and that we're being impoverished by design under a
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.720]  managed economy system in fact there's a big article out today that's getting a
[54:39.720 --> 54:45.760]  lot of attention where David Stockman the former head of one of the most
[54:45.760 --> 54:52.280]  important offices the office of management and budget under President
[54:52.280 --> 54:58.160]  Reagan says we've been taken over by a criminal cabal that is robbing us and

[55:26.400 --> 55:31.040]  extremist in Colorado and I was reading the Denver Post and people thought I was
[55:31.040 --> 55:38.960]  lying on air and hey I don't blame you you know why cuz that sounds crazy this
[55:38.960 --> 55:45.120]  is crazy to have the Communist Chinese telling us well what we can do and you
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.080]  know I told the guys in the hot tub after this this establishment
[55:50.080 --> 55:54.920]  authoritarian collaborator left and I was in that hot tub I you know I gave him
[55:54.920 --> 55:58.120]  Rob do his email cuz he's good at reading his email and I said later in the
[55:58.120 --> 56:01.360]  week we'll get you know a couple you guys on if you want to tell the story of
[56:01.360 --> 56:06.120]  what you saw cuz it's so unbelievable we're all calmly sitting there in a

[56:34.760 --> 56:39.280]  guys were successful in business you know one guy you know has a payroll of
[56:39.280 --> 56:43.040]  a quarter million dollars a month the other guy you know he paid $300,000 he
[56:43.040 --> 56:47.360]  was staying in taxes to you know to the feds last year and we're sitting there
[56:47.360 --> 56:51.520]  in the hot tub I'm watching my kids off running around and stuff at the pool my
[56:51.520 --> 56:56.280]  wife's over there in the pool and this guy gets in the tub and I said man that

[57:04.760 --> 57:09.280]  elitist and I was talking about China and you know the suicide nets and the
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.120]  mass extermination and he goes hey China's doing a great job it's not a

[1:00:33.840 --> 1:00:37.400]  looks like what his plans are in fact it's 100% clear they're going to head
[1:00:37.400 --> 1:00:41.440]  with their with their program to bankrupt all independent private wealth
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:48.160]  not controlled by the crime syndicate in this orgy of authoritarianism that is
[1:00:48.160 --> 1:00:52.120]  now starting to take place but if you just joined us I was telling the story
[1:00:52.120 --> 1:00:56.120]  about my mom had an idea to go out to one of these you know I was the Hyatt
[1:00:56.120 --> 1:01:00.280]  hotel outside Austin Texas like a golf course in the rivers out there and
[1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:03.200]  there's you know big swimming pool and stuff for the kids so we thought we'd
[1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:06.400]  have some family in the town has have small old family reunion for Easter and
[1:01:06.400 --> 1:01:10.920]  go out there so I'm sitting there in the hot tub and it's an upper-end you know
[1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:16.120]  nice hotel and there's five white guys yeah there were other quote you know
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:20.360]  quote groups of people out there but I'd be five white guys in this hot tub over
[1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:25.040]  at things there were two hot tubs and we're sitting there talking about how
[1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:28.200]  you know the globalists are shutting down America how both parties are
[1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:34.720]  corrupt about how you know crony capitalists are able to use government
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:38.280]  to shut down their competition how they're trying to bankrupt despite
[1:01:38.280 --> 1:01:42.520]  design so it was really a serious heartfelt discussion one guys like man
[1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:46.400]  let's talk about the Rangers you know because I hadn't brought it up these
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:50.640]  guys were listeners a couple of them had heard of me but a couple were hardcore
[1:01:50.640 --> 1:01:54.120]  listeners and another guy gets in the hot tub and is listening this wasn't like
[1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:58.240]  that evil Obama you know these these bad minorities it was not even a
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:01.520]  discussion about that but a white guy gets in there you know look like about
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:05.600]  retirement age he said he was 67 later he said the age of white men is over you
[1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.040]  all you know won't be here soon one guy said well how old are you and he goes
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:14.040]  said 67 he goes we got nine years on me it was but the whole point was we were
[1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:17.360]  having a heartfelt yeah them you know the globalists are gonna bankrupt this and
[1:02:17.360 --> 1:02:20.480]  you know they're working with China to leverage things out in the poor Chinese
[1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:24.320]  people yeah do you hear about this and that yeah and and and I'm sitting there
[1:02:24.320 --> 1:02:27.760]  talking to the engineer and they guys sitting there he starts defending
[1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:32.480]  communist China and I went so you're a collectivist he goes yes I am he goes I

[1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:46.280]  gets out of the hot tub we're being real nice to him we thought he was joking and
[1:02:46.280 --> 1:02:52.920]  he stands there for like 20 minutes point his finger at us with the most
[1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:58.880]  ridiculous it'd be like a five-year-old kid going to WWF or WWE wrestling and
[1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:03.800]  standing by one of the you know fake you know muscle guys or you know you know
[1:03:03.800 --> 1:03:06.120]  you know fake tough guys or whatever I'm sure they are tough guys but you know
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:10.180]  it's it's like ballet one of the actors and actually you know little kids feel
[1:03:10.180 --> 1:03:16.240]  powerful reflected glory standing at the knee of a big man I mean I've seen my
[1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:21.680]  son you know I guess he's healthy so he admires his father so we don't let him
[1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:25.320]  watch mainstream television he disdain me that's the message you know he feels
[1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:29.640]  strong when he's around me but it was just watching like yes I'm an
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:33.640]  authoritarian a collectivist and yes the state's taking over and you
[1:03:33.640 --> 1:03:38.320]  individuals will be defeated and he was laughing with like really evil pleasure
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:42.040]  this was like a movie and you know all these serious guys that have all these
[1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:46.440]  employees and are smart and they're going my I employ a lot of people Obamacare
[1:03:46.440 --> 1:03:49.840]  raised taxes on people's payroll you know one guy and they get he's like oh
[1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:53.880]  whatever you know that's all part of the takeover it'll be different once you've
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:57.440]  been dealt with and like you know one guy's just going why don't you just get
[1:03:57.440 --> 1:04:03.600]  out of here then and the guys like you bet I will enjoy your time and it was
[1:04:03.600 --> 1:04:09.440]  like sometimes he was like a anti-white racist who was a white guy and again it's
[1:04:09.440 --> 1:04:12.560]  like a football team it white black whatever they're playing us off against
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:16.400]  each other it's globalism we're all being targeted but it's like this delusion
[1:04:16.400 --> 1:04:22.720]  now with the Democratic Party I'm not even a Republican people know that but
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:26.800]  you know they play the part of the other choice which is so close to Democrats
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:30.480]  doesn't matter and that's the issue they're gonna open the borders up now
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:33.960]  they're saying well that's the way it is on Fox News everyone agrees we have to
[1:04:33.960 --> 1:04:37.640]  do this what legalize the 30 million illegals it's not 15 million or 11
[1:04:37.640 --> 1:04:43.120]  million who then are highly nationalistic and taught not to want to
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.520]  bill of rights and Constitution but to see the government as their friend and
[1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:53.320]  then there's a racial affiliation that's force-fed I mean it is pure
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:05:01.460]  Balkanization and this guy was so creepy and on a power trip Alex Jones here

[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:43.440]  time callers again give you a chance to call in and I'm gonna get your take
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:47.640]  specifically we don't screen your calls when you call in but we ask you
[1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:51.600]  sometimes that when I want your take on something I'd like to have you call in on
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:57.080]  that particular subject so please humor me there they're now bankrupting cities
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:03.520]  all over the United States by signing the cities on to global derivatives in the
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:08.080]  last four years pension funds public and private have been ordered outside of law
[1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:12.200]  but if you don't the regulator shut you down and send you to jail we're having a
[1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:15.160]  crooked toenail the regulations are written where it's impossible to fall
[1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:18.800]  on the laws they've ordered all the big pension funds to invest in the failed
[1:09:18.800 --> 1:09:24.880]  derivatives not to bail the derivatives out but they've already been triaged but
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:28.760]  to destroy the wealth because they want to be able to come in and buy
[1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:34.560]  everything up for pennies on the dollar and social engineer after the economy has
[1:09:34.560 --> 1:09:38.480]  been destroyed because remember the globalists are exempt from all of their
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:43.080]  own regulations so I'd like to get your take on this as they announce that they
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:46.840]  are going to quote federalize the pension funds all over the world including in
[1:09:46.840 --> 1:09:50.880]  the United States when they announce all these new taxes that they already have
[1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:57.600]  in place but they're going to expand them on after-tax money investments that
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:03.080]  they're going to ratchet that up do you realize the Republicans are openly
[1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:07.600]  pushing right now with the Democrats for total amnesty when you're not going to
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:12.000]  get amnesty going down to Mexico or going down to Guatemala or going to you
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:16.760]  know one of these countries you have to go through their system no other country
[1:10:16.760 --> 1:10:20.680]  in the world tells foreigners except Europe European countries come here
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:25.440]  have your baby free have everything paid for this again is designed to bankrupt
[1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:30.000]  the country then have groups of people that see themselves as clients of the
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:35.040]  state and as I was told by a scientist who says he works for the government in
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:40.560]  viruses the Democrat the the demographics have changed we are going to get
[1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:42.840]  your guns
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:47.000]  see I mean if we brought foreigners in here and trained them in the Bill of
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:52.920]  Rights Constitution had a free market created wealth created workers it would
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:56.960]  be a good thing but it's not because it's a globalist program they always
[1:10:56.960 --> 1:11:01.040]  sell us on let's turn the guns in for the children we're like more guns
[1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:04.960]  actually lowered crime never mind that turn your guns in when actually they
[1:11:04.960 --> 1:11:10.280]  want our guns so they can authoritatively dominate us and I know you know
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:15.040]  that but it's the narrative of the gullible public we're in a North American
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:22.600]  Union Europe is being imploded into larger unions the the sovereignty is
[1:11:22.600 --> 1:11:28.760]  being removed we are being conquered and I want to get your take on this here are
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:33.080]  some of the headlines let me just read you some of the headlines here mega rich
[1:11:33.080 --> 1:11:39.600]  withdrew millions from Cyprus before looting and that's a info wars dot com
[1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:43.760]  story that's linked on drudge report dot com on the lower left hand side there's
[1:11:43.760 --> 1:11:48.800]  a bunch of news right there it's all also up at prison planet dot com mega rich
[1:11:48.800 --> 1:12:01.680]  withdrew money from Cyprus before looting news that Cypriot president family
[1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:06.400]  moved 21 million euros to London days before the bank accounts of his people
[1:12:06.400 --> 1:12:11.800]  were looted as part of the bailout deal serves as another reminder that while the
[1:12:11.800 --> 1:12:16.040]  media portrays the victims of Cyprus haircut as the mega rich and wealthy
[1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:20.080]  Russian oligarchs the real victims are middle-class families and small
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:24.600]  business owners well yeah the Russians got it out months before now the Russians
[1:12:24.600 --> 1:12:30.280]  are saying we're not gonna bail out any of our bankholders just like they have
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:37.400]  with the FDIC here FDIC federal depositors insurance corporation it's
[1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:41.000]  all a big joke folks this has been done over and over again how many Mexican
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:46.560]  presidents steal billions of dollars after they sell their country out and
[1:12:46.560 --> 1:12:53.280]  then run to Switzerland to live in you know 500 million dollar houses look it
[1:12:53.280 --> 1:13:00.200]  up and it's the same thing our leaders in Europe and here in the US and Canada
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:04.440]  Australia New Zealand are doing the same thing that Latin American leaders have
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:11.200]  done to their people the same thing Asian leaders have done and the president of
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:16.200]  Cyprus will be allowed to run off a 21 million dollars he'll be allowed to run
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:20.600]  back to the city of London the city within the city the private city it's
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:27.600]  above the law and they've got all these other subsidiary companies I mean 21
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:32.820]  millions nothing but one Salinas Mexican president what was it back in the
[1:13:32.820 --> 1:13:37.520]  90s ran off for like 30 billion himself or something and he's got places in
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:42.480]  New York and he could still go to Mexico and he totally committed crimes but see
[1:13:42.480 --> 1:13:47.600]  the society now is just gonna collapse because well if the president's gonna
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:52.340]  steal that why shouldn't I steal or if the government doesn't pay its own taxes
[1:13:52.340 --> 1:13:58.280]  rich people why should I pay and the whole society falls apart and that's
[1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:04.680]  all this New World Order is is just a system of crooks that exempt themselves
[1:14:04.680 --> 1:14:10.080]  from the laws that they themselves have written by their minions and now they've
[1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:14.600]  taken 40% of the bank accounts now they're saying they may just take
[1:14:14.600 --> 1:14:20.640]  everything and now they're going oh yeah this is the model for Europe in fact
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:25.360]  that's in the BBC today that indeed what I told you weeks ago it's a no-brainer oh
[1:14:25.360 --> 1:14:32.080]  yeah this was a test by the EU to do it in the other countries of course it was
[1:14:32.080 --> 1:14:39.480]  and they sent in British troops and British mercenaries to guard the banks
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:44.080]  while they keep them shut down and extract everybody's money and they've
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:48.120]  all got it psychological warfare actuaried out where they let them get
[1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:53.680]  300 euros a day when the banks are open which is not most of the time will be
[1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:57.000]  closed a week that open a day then call and then there's actual guys with
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.560]  machine guns in there they're there robbing you imagine the guns pointed
[1:15:02.560 --> 1:15:07.400]  out of the tellers boxes it's a reverse bank robbery and that's actually how
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:11.520]  most bank robberies happen and then they're going to go to Spain and Italy
[1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:15.360]  and Portugal and France and all the other countries and then they'll go to
[1:15:15.360 --> 1:15:19.560]  Germany and then they'll run up the line into northern Europe and then they're
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:23.600]  going to rob England and then they're going to rob Canada and the United States
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:27.960]  New Zealand Australia and you have to understand they're going to take
[1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:32.480]  everything you've got that's what Homeland Security is for I kept telling
[1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:39.040]  you Homeland Security is there to take your pension funds and they know folks
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:48.160]  that veterans a lot of people that serve 25 years oh yeah there it is Cyprus
[1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:52.480]  crisis lemon on bank withdrawals to last about a month yeah that's how one
[1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:56.480]  and guardian until all your money's gone and they've got armed police armed
[1:15:56.480 --> 1:16:00.720]  British mercenaries because again Britain's at the heart of this new world
[1:16:00.720 --> 1:16:06.320]  order and they're going to take everything and and again you read the ADL
[1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:09.560]  Southern Prairie Law Center they've got similar groups in Europe if you even
[1:16:09.560 --> 1:16:13.520]  talk about a bank run world government and a banking plan to implode the world
[1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:17.120]  economy and a banking plan to establish world government because we're just
[1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:20.680]  following their own official plans the ADL Southern Prairie Law Center New York
[1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:26.320]  Times come out and say it doesn't exist you're insane and of course that's a
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:29.840]  military tactic to tell you none of this exist let me just go over some more of
[1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:40.240]  these headlines toll-free number to join us 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 mega rich
[1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:43.960]  withdraw money from Cyprus before looting let's just go through these
[1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:49.240]  headlines quickly here well of course the mega rich did that here's another
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:54.200]  one California bankruptcies report warns more cities at risk of going under at
[1:16:54.200 --> 1:17:00.800]  risk they were all signed on to derivatives to steal your money because
[1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:07.000]  you're gullible chumps they think they think you're so weak of course they want
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:12.040]  all the guns now and the demonized guns folks the UN says in the official treaty
[1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:17.040]  that that threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state a power
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:22.720]  monopoly is called a dictatorship for you to have a gun they're not just going
[1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:26.760]  to take the guns and see there's all these cowards that even if they lose
[1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:30.120]  their bank accounts in their future they don't care they're going to run to the
[1:17:30.120 --> 1:17:35.080]  government and worship it because they have Stockholm syndrome they're cowards
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:41.160]  folks they're so cowardly they don't want to admit this and they get off on you
[1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:45.720]  being disarmed and then the state only being armed and they literally go up I've
[1:17:45.720 --> 1:17:52.600]  seen them and grovel to police grovel to government this is what it looks like
[1:17:52.600 --> 1:17:57.480]  to be a fallen joke of a people and I don't say that to put us down I'm really
[1:17:57.480 --> 1:18:03.240]  sad but I had nightmares after I talked to that guy Saturday night I woke up I
[1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:07.360]  don't really usually have nightmares or if I have a scary dream it's more like
[1:18:07.360 --> 1:18:13.560]  entertainment I woke up just in a sweat so sad for how evil that guy is and how
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.760]  pathetic he was like I had sorrow in the dream for how pathetic these people are
[1:18:18.760 --> 1:18:24.320]  that they're so horrible and so weak and so evil and so dangerous and so pathetic
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:27.440]  and that they're gonna have their way they're gonna bring America down they're
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:31.600]  gonna wreck everything because they hate goodness they hate success they hate
[1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:36.240]  wealth because they're nobodies they could only have a job through government
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:41.000]  or big mega corporations of government contracts they hate those of us that are
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:45.440]  strong those of us that are beautiful those of us that are virtuous those of
[1:18:45.440 --> 1:18:51.680]  us that are talented those of us that are hard-working we're the enemy and they
[1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:55.040]  love playing the great game of divide and conquer and they're going to bankrupt
[1:18:55.040 --> 1:19:01.640]  everything and they're gonna dominate us and run our lives and they're gonna set
[1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:05.520]  set up checkpoints and break our families up and rape our wives in front
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:09.480]  of us in FEMA camps and kick our brains out and torture our children in front of
[1:19:09.480 --> 1:19:13.520]  us just like they do with all the military bases hundreds of them

[1:24:13.800 --> 1:24:18.080]  major Hollywood movies now have to get script approval from Communist China and
[1:24:18.080 --> 1:24:23.240]  the Communist Party that's official and I'm reading the comments on info wars.com
[1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:27.760]  a couple people are like hey you don't want to make a billion dollar or a
[1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:32.640]  billion person market upset at you no you do want to have your free speech
[1:24:32.640 --> 1:24:37.800]  across the board to get everybody used to hearing free speech or then you can't
[1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:42.280]  say or do anything because it might hurt someone's feelings and by the way the
[1:24:42.280 --> 1:24:46.320]  I've read the book it just shows outbreaks in different regions of the
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:51.600]  world and actually it's pretty pro-communist Chinese and actually
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:58.120]  endorses Marx and and collectivism and and praises the Chinese government but
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:02.160]  see then oh well we don't even want to show something bad in China now you see
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:09.080]  it then turns to that so they reedit the film they reedit the trailer and then
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:12.400]  it's only you know Chinese can only be shown as good guys and you as bad guys
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:18.120]  oh and you can't criticize China's record you can't say China is producing
[1:25:18.120 --> 1:25:22.680]  too much GMO you can't say China has got unfair tariffs against us with their
[1:25:22.680 --> 1:25:28.080]  currency kept low no you just can't say anything and then Americans are like
[1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:32.960]  well that's good it's good to have the foreign government Chinese party
[1:25:32.960 --> 1:25:40.800]  communist party tell us what to do I mean you tell people 10 years ago the
[1:25:40.800 --> 1:25:45.160]  communist Chinese will control what we do in our country and we'll own our debt
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:50.720]  and we'll put out public memos in the people's daily saying we want to help
[1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:55.240]  Obama disarm the American people and quote this is a quote wage a war on
[1:25:55.240 --> 1:26:02.400]  American gun owners and it's not even news and then they have drills with
[1:26:02.400 --> 1:26:11.560]  troops from Russia China Germany you name it in the Denver Post going oh they're
[1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:15.840]  having drills of taking on local extremists and you read the NLE09
[1:26:15.840 --> 1:26:20.800]  particularly on FEMA's website and it said troops from 15 nations practice
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:27.880]  taking on domestic extremists our government has a deal the first one
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:31.360]  they did was about 12 years ago and it was in the Washington Post with Canada
[1:26:31.360 --> 1:26:37.920]  and Mexico to quote deal with American extremists during a civil war and then
[1:26:37.920 --> 1:26:41.160]  you notice they had the Olympics a few years ago in Canada US troops were in
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:46.120]  Canada patrolling their streets and searching people martial law and they
[1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:51.240]  just do it see US troops in Mexican troops will go to Canada we'll go to
[1:26:51.240 --> 1:26:54.880]  Mexico and there's US troops in Mexico make no mistake so a lot of them are
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:00.680]  getting killed now only occasionally does it end up coming out in the news like
[1:27:00.680 --> 1:27:04.120]  how dare they shoot up the Marines part of a diplomatic detail you know driving
[1:27:04.120 --> 1:27:11.360]  through the town and what happens when the Mexican mafia working for the
[1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:14.400]  globalist starts killing the police around here well they'll just roll over
[1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:18.640]  do whatever they say it's like they have in Mexico this is how countries fall and
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:22.720]  then all the other organized crime gangs are coming in and no one can say no to
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:27.720]  them everyone is just cowards and in a nation of cowards who just give in to
[1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:33.560]  corruption man you lose everything America's had its problems but people you
[1:27:33.560 --> 1:27:36.440]  know in the old days if some robber baron or the railroad try to take
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:39.400]  everybody's property people will just get together and go have a gunfight with
[1:27:39.400 --> 1:27:46.080]  them there were thousands of sagebrush battles from Texas to Colorado to
[1:27:46.080 --> 1:27:50.880]  Washington state and the only reason we have any wealth or money or any due
[1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:57.840]  process is because our ancestors would kill people if people push them around and
[1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:00.840]  the globalists know that and remember that and they're getting ready to take
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:06.320]  everything to arrest patriots torture centers that mean they've got it all
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:10.120]  planned and they're coming out in the culture and all the movies the video

[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:46.520]  and what are the police taught by the Southern Barbery Law Center in ADL if
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:50.160]  someone says the fellow reserve is private they are a terrorist they're
[1:34:50.160 --> 1:34:54.320]  publicly private folks they think the cops are so dumb they tell them it

[1:36:54.680 --> 1:37:00.680]  thanks for having me on I just wanted to make a note Bob Chapman before he
[1:37:00.680 --> 1:37:05.920]  passed away talked about how the sovereign debt crisis in Europe would
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:11.400]  give the the central bank European central bank more control and more
[1:37:11.400 --> 1:37:17.400]  influence in taking over countries and how this ties in with how the Cyprus
[1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:23.760]  situation is really becoming a financial oligarchy model for how the rest of the
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:28.080]  world is going to be taken over and how the wealth is going to be confiscated
[1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:35.280]  and people don't realize that once you set a president how that just magnifies
[1:37:35.280 --> 1:37:42.600]  and grows like a metastasized cancer and Bob Chapman who I think was a common
[1:37:42.600 --> 1:37:52.720]  man genius saw that coming I hear you man I hear you where do you think it's
[1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:59.880]  all going well I it's like what George Cowan said when your neighbor loses
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.920]  their job in their house in their car it's a recession and when you lose your
[1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:10.360]  job in your house in your car it's a depression so until you know the public
[1:38:10.360 --> 1:38:14.360]  on average is now brain damage that's major studies there's early on set of
[1:38:14.360 --> 1:38:17.480]  Alzheimer's because of all the TV watching the average person isn't a
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:23.240]  trance now I mean we're done we're done the public doesn't talk their entrances
[1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:27.840]  they watch TV shows or people that are awake or terrorist all day so it's just
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:32.960]  going to all implode because people want it to they can't help it they can't help
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:38.520]  it people have a will to fail and fall when civilizations go into this I mean
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:41.880]  my god they now are saying they're going to start killing babies up to age three
[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:45.240]  if parents want to kill your children but if you want to raise your kids good
[1:38:45.240 --> 1:38:48.720]  and spank them if they try to walk out the street the third time they will try
[1:38:48.720 --> 1:38:53.280]  to take your kids when there's no law you can't spank your children I mean I
[1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:58.920]  mean I mean things are totally upside down now things are totally and
[1:38:58.920 --> 1:39:02.680]  completely upside down now
[1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:08.480]  enlighten people about that man I'm trying my best Woody I appreciate it
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:12.120]  that they say they grabbed the clip off YouTube again I want to watch it before
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:18.280]  we play it oh we actually did we actually did find it in our computer yeah
[1:39:18.280 --> 1:39:21.480]  when I saw that clip earlier I said that's not the clip because I that's
[1:39:21.480 --> 1:39:24.720]  from some weird nightly news thing they had with the box around it with the
[1:39:24.720 --> 1:39:28.080]  original clips four and a half minutes long it's the whole deal of them saying
[1:39:28.080 --> 1:39:31.920]  we're all slaves and then just introduce but but but simultaneously this
[1:39:31.920 --> 1:39:36.520]  doesn't it doesn't exist on CNBC okay let's try to roll this time here it is I
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:41.760]  think that right now the question is do we all work for central bankers that's
[1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:46.000]  what I want to address to our guests tonight is this global governance at
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:51.280]  last is it one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio you say we've
[1:39:51.280 --> 1:39:55.760]  got some downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't we all just
[1:39:55.760 --> 1:40:00.000]  living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just counting on
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.160]  the fact that there's a Bernanke putt putt and that we won't go any lower than
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:08.400]  say five percent down from here of course we are because if we look at the
[1:40:08.400 --> 1:40:12.520]  economic data there's nothing to get excited about in that that's enough it
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:15.360]  goes on for like four more minutes we've we've played it over and over again I
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:18.880]  just want to remind people that and so cops are listening right now if you
[1:40:18.880 --> 1:40:22.760]  want to know who's taking over America Southern Parvy Law Center ADL other
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:26.760]  groups are openly paid by foreign banks and consortiums big tax-free
[1:40:26.760 --> 1:40:30.760]  foundations hundreds of millions a year you know handed out to these different
[1:40:30.760 --> 1:40:34.560]  groups they say none of that exists there is no global governance even though
[1:40:34.560 --> 1:40:38.240]  it's all being announced there are no foreign banks so how can we stop the
[1:40:38.240 --> 1:40:42.560]  foreign takeover of America where there's a consortium of globalists with
[1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:49.720]  the communist Chinese at the core who makes seven-year-olds work 18 hours a
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:55.720]  day till till their fingers bleed in slave camps how do you think you're
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:41:00.480]  going to compete against that and now the the the hard-able authoritarians that
[1:41:00.480 --> 1:41:05.400]  run North Korea China does and that run those people now run and get script
[1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:11.840]  approval and final cut approval final cut approval of films let me tell you
[1:41:11.840 --> 1:41:20.480]  how final cut approval works I have been around when a major director says I
[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:24.280]  okay I'll tell you right now Richard link letter a scanner darkly that I
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:28.120]  consulted on it's got Keanu Reeves in it Woody Harrelson you name it I'm in the
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:32.600]  film but my main role was consulting on it with Tommy Pilotta there's a great
[1:41:32.600 --> 1:41:36.240]  producer in a great mind work for Microsoft you name it and just some
[1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:40.920]  incredible areas I need to get him all he won't talk about it though but he
[1:41:40.920 --> 1:41:44.400]  certainly knows this shows for real I'll put it to you that way that was written
[1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:52.080]  in the 70s but you know they kind of updated some of it and was it Warner
[1:41:52.080 --> 1:41:55.360]  Brothers put that out yeah yeah Fox put out the other link letter film I'm in
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:59.080]  Fox searchlight this was Warner Brothers guys it's just because it's memory and
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:01.960]  I'm kind of dinging today I'm so depressed over everything that's going on I'm
[1:42:01.960 --> 1:42:05.200]  not going to hardly even I say I can hardly even talk I won't shut up and
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:08.160]  take calls type in a scanner darkly I think it was Warner Brothers I'm going
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:18.480]  for memory but point is the you know they said we don't like the fact that a
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:27.240]  cop blows somebody's head off at a stop a road stop and and we want it cut but
[1:42:27.240 --> 1:42:31.280]  you've got final cut in your if he brings the film in on time and on budget
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.680]  you got your final cut it's not like Rick link letter that's Warner Brothers I
[1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:40.400]  knew that I just wanted to double check for memory and they told them take that
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:48.280]  out and then if you don't take it out they just don't promote it and I've been
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:52.760]  told that by rock stars rap stars just every newspaper people everybody
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:59.960]  that's why America's like this and now the Communist Chinese are saying what
[1:42:59.960 --> 1:43:06.320]  can and can't be in movies they don't want to show an outbreak in China even
[1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:12.040]  though the film is a communist UN film where in the book communism saves the
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:18.640]  world and the enemy is gun owners that must be mowed down I did a review of it
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:23.240]  and our article is up at info wars dot com right now World War Z scene

[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:37.080]  population affected with mine control parasite
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:42.680]  of course we are
[1:44:44.600 --> 1:44:49.560]  oh my god we're in such trouble and they've got they announced a decade ago
[1:44:49.560 --> 1:44:52.680]  these vaccines they give you that a really nanotech that reprogram the
[1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:54.920]  brain
[1:44:55.440 --> 1:45:01.240]  where people can't get upset anymore and I from what I've looked at we know they
[1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:05.320]  found some interesting carrier viruses in the H1N1 shot they gave and all that
[1:45:05.320 --> 1:45:12.520]  and that's what I've seen in the public people look so bad now and and and
[1:45:12.520 --> 1:45:16.920]  they're not like people anymore you can't even talk to them and admit the
[1:45:16.920 --> 1:45:19.920]  flicker screens are doing I mean we're in a science fiction body snatcher movie
[1:45:19.920 --> 1:45:25.640]  basically but it's our own species that's the body snatchers and I guess
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:30.320]  that's just the end of it I mean guess I guess let them take over dumbest down
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:33.400]  and buy a weapon us out and then they'll they'll enjoy all the future
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:36.520]  technologies and stuff and they you know Bill Joy they've all told us that's the
[1:45:36.520 --> 1:45:38.760]  plan
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:44.560]  yeah one of the new programs funded by Bill Gates by the Foundation is a
[1:45:44.560 --> 1:45:49.880]  sterilization program that we use sharp blasts of ultrasound directed at men
[1:45:49.880 --> 1:45:55.000]  scrotums to render them infertile and then of course if you want welfare you've
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  got to get it but you're like well good sterilize the welfare folks when they
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:01.600]  shut everything down we're all going to be on welfare
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:05.760]  let's go to Robert in Pennsylvania you're on the air Robert welcome to the
[1:46:05.760 --> 1:46:12.680]  airwaves hey Alex huge fan I just wanted to ask you how do I approach people with
[1:46:12.680 --> 1:46:17.120]  this information I mean I get ridiculed I get laughed at people think I'm crazy
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:21.160]  how it's just hey exactly no no no it's crazy to say they're taking people's
[1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:24.960]  bank accounts it doesn't exist sounds like you're hanging around a bunch of
[1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:29.680]  morons I mean you know it's not your fault that they're cowardly dumb down low
[1:46:29.680 --> 1:46:34.640]  IQ'd fools and they've never counted in history just just find the like-minded
[1:46:34.640 --> 1:46:39.760]  people and organize against it and run for local office and do things like that
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:44.760]  yeah it you know I just want to also tell you Alex you know you really touched
[1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:50.760]  my life for the positive you know I've become I was raised Jewish and I've
[1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:55.440]  recently become born again and you've helped me to find Jesus Alex and I
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:47:00.520]  really just wanted to thank you for that thank you brother well thank you
[1:47:00.520 --> 1:47:05.200]  Robert what's your take on just I mean people look back on other authoritarian
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:09.120]  regimes and they seem crazy how did that happen people just get to where they
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:13.720]  accept it and then by increments people will accept anything and I people can
[1:47:13.720 --> 1:47:17.160]  hear that I have a real sense of dread people so it's depressing it's not
[1:47:17.160 --> 1:47:21.360]  depressing if we realize just how far we've gone down this path that's what
[1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:25.760]  I'm trying to do here like you said before Alex you know we've had a good
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:32.080]  for so long people are just you know in these days it's uh it's just it's
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:38.080]  difficult it's uh you know it's depressing but I mean you know we get
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:41.680]  through it you know we got it you know I try to encourage people to find Jesus to
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:46.400]  find the Lord you know whatever they think they're higher power you know I'm
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:50.720]  a strong believer in that I you know it's really you know I found myself in a
[1:47:50.720 --> 1:47:56.080]  depression like six months ago but you know I I found religion and I can
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.880]  honestly you know believe that religion really helps it really really changed my
[1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:05.560]  life well I mean if it's not the artificial Christianoid stuff where
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:08.920]  they're all just there to make everybody feel good and and and not get
[1:48:08.920 --> 1:48:11.920]  people to be world changers I mean that's really what this comes down to my
[1:48:11.920 --> 1:48:15.200]  whole mission that's why I try to instinctively bring in other reporters
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:20.320]  build them up put them out there is because you know I'm trying to like do
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:24.040]  my best to give other people the knowledge I've accrued because it's
[1:48:24.040 --> 1:48:28.440]  really self-evident this stuff is not rocket science it's history but very few
[1:48:28.440 --> 1:48:34.240]  people really get the fact that there is evil and there's organized evil and
[1:48:34.240 --> 1:48:39.000]  you've got to face it down I appreciate your call it's good to hear from you
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:44.480]  let's talk to anonymous in Kentucky listening on XM 166 anonymous you're on
[1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:49.680]  the air I don't I've got two questions one I'm thinking about relocating to
[1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:55.680]  Texas for the family values and legacies and stuff stuff you have I'm
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:49:00.560]  wondering if your advice is good on that and secondly you have a list compiled
[1:49:00.560 --> 1:49:06.080]  of 200 300 people that are orchestrating this whole thing why in the world can we
[1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:11.920]  not be like Switzerland and take them down I don't understand that I mean the
[1:49:11.920 --> 1:49:15.760]  Swiss the Swiss don't just have automatic weapons you know anybody who
[1:49:15.760 --> 1:49:18.440]  wants them has rocket launchers you know they have armored redoubts for the
[1:49:18.440 --> 1:49:24.840]  whole public the Swiss decided this is our thing they're not stupid our model
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:28.880]  came off the Swiss and the Swiss you know of course of the richest most
[1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:33.360]  powerful people in the world because they don't allow the globalist infection
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:38.080]  and so the globalists have to run there it's the only pool the globalist haven't
[1:49:38.080 --> 1:49:43.520]  been you know defiling so the globalists come there with their money because it's
[1:49:43.520 --> 1:49:48.320]  the only place they haven't wrecked one of the only places America has never
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:53.640]  been perfect but no Swiss are not the Swiss are described in Europe as the
[1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:58.640]  rednecks of Europe and are actually you know halfway made fun of by the
[1:49:58.640 --> 1:50:02.560]  French and others and really they're just a bunch of German slash you know
[1:50:02.560 --> 1:50:06.400]  northern Italians and they're just people that aren't going to be messed with
[1:50:06.400 --> 1:50:11.200]  and they've got state government see they have cantons that have a limited
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:15.440]  small federal government and the states are in charge our states until the
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:21.320]  17th Amendment we the legislatures voted for the US senators the feds were
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:25.800]  totally our creatures we have an imperial government now and and we
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:29.280]  allowed it so we're in deep trouble and now the criminals have just gotten away
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:33.760]  with more and more to where now they can get away with anything so I mean does
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:38.680]  that answer your question yeah sure to agree but we've got people like you've
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:43.320]  got people like that I might like Rand Paul Ron Paul Ted Cruz and all these
[1:50:43.320 --> 1:50:48.040]  other people are starting to stand up if they don't get physically eliminated by
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:54.200]  some means and or whatever why is it more people can't follow that example I
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:56.560]  tell you what stay there I'm gonna come back and talk to you about this this is
[1:50:56.560 --> 1:50:59.600]  super important don't hang up anonymous we'll be back with more of your calls
[1:50:59.600 --> 1:51:04.440]  stay with us in the last two years alone the US has seen huge losses to our food
[1:51:04.440 --> 1:51:09.680]  supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the US costing us 20 billion and
[1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:13.680]  lost crops alone in 2012 we saw the largest drought in the country in more
[1:51:13.680 --> 1:51:17.920]  than 50 years you may think out of sight out of mind and so you don't think you
[1:51:17.920 --> 1:51:22.800]  will be affected the fact is you are we all are food shortages drive prices up

[1:53:05.920 --> 1:53:09.840]  bolts they kicked in our door and we're in and out of our house in about five
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:14.240]  minutes the police arrived in about 20 minutes but they were long gone with our
[1:53:14.240 --> 1:53:19.480]  TV jewelry and my guns I kept thinking what if my family had been home the
[1:53:19.480 --> 1:53:22.920]  police officer said that more than eighty five percent of break-ins are
[1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:27.640]  through a door and that dead bolts alone don't stop intruders the officer told

[1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:19.560]  I'll continue with your calls going back to anonymous in Kentucky but here's the
[1:54:19.560 --> 1:54:23.880]  issue they run these giant hoaxes like everybody knows America should take
[1:54:23.880 --> 1:54:27.360]  anybody from any country and give them free welfare and pay for their kids to
[1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:33.120]  be born there and that America is bad and that guns are bad America has decided
[1:54:33.120 --> 1:54:38.200]  they want collectivism America has decided that they love Obama and then
[1:54:38.200 --> 1:54:44.800]  people that that are losers you want to feel like their winners they sign on to
[1:54:44.800 --> 1:54:48.680]  something so that they have an extension of feeling like they're part of
[1:54:48.680 --> 1:54:53.520]  something and folks that's what being a sports fans all about I'm not saying it's
[1:54:53.520 --> 1:54:58.200]  bad to like a team or enjoy that you're off time but that then becomes
[1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:04.240]  unbalanced and becomes your whole world and so Republicans would support Bush
[1:55:04.240 --> 1:55:07.920]  and any evil he was involved in because that was their guy and they felt
[1:55:07.920 --> 1:55:13.760]  powerful through him by extension and it's the same thing with Democrats now
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:17.760]  they're saying on Fox News I was watching it this morning
[1:55:17.760 --> 1:55:23.760]  today Mustaine sitting in my living room he's flying back today back to California
[1:55:23.760 --> 1:55:26.160]  and we're sitting there watching and they're like well Republican leadership
[1:55:26.160 --> 1:55:30.080]  say now's the time for amnesty and this is a good immigration deal they won't
[1:55:30.080 --> 1:55:33.480]  let anybody see the details right now but you know everybody's behind it and
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:41.760]  that's just the way it is so you create a bandwagon effect and so it's the idea
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:46.360]  of that's just the way it is and so oh that's just the way it is everybody's
[1:55:46.360 --> 1:55:51.240]  gonna turn their guns in oh boy I tell you everybody really feels good getting
[1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:56.360]  free health care in Obamacare which actually doubles your premiums the
[1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:02.480]  first year and doesn't give anybody free health care unless they walk into the
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:07.360]  emergency room which citizens get turned away but illegals don't because
[1:56:07.360 --> 1:56:11.100]  that's part of a government client deal to try to bring the third world to
[1:56:11.100 --> 1:56:23.160]  America it's all extremely cold-blooded and it's all happening right now I mean
[1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:26.400]  look at these articles here where they came out a month ago and they said oh
[1:56:26.400 --> 1:56:29.960]  yeah the government's looking at all your bank accounts without warrants shows
[1:56:29.960 --> 1:56:33.080]  the Department of Defense and they're sharing it with other agencies that's
[1:56:33.080 --> 1:56:36.720]  just the way it is they're tracking everybody figuring out what they're
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:42.760]  going to steal and they're going to do it if you let them and folks if they
[1:56:42.760 --> 1:56:45.880]  come and say we're taking 10% on everybody's bank account in America all
[1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:48.800]  the globalists like Mitt Romney and people they're all offshore they're exempt
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:53.600]  they'll get up and support it Obama will support it this happens or we'll
[1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:58.200]  lose all the 401ks and we'll lose all the pensions and most people go I guess
[1:56:58.200 --> 1:57:01.920]  take it out of mind so I keep my other 90% and then a year later they'll take
[1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:05.680]  another 20 and then you'll put up with that then they'll take a hundred percent
[1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:13.360]  and because you will they're they're lawless and it's because you're going
[1:57:13.360 --> 1:57:19.800]  along with them it's because you're acting gullible it's because you're a
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:25.960]  pushover but they know some veterans if they have their military pension taken
[1:57:25.960 --> 1:57:29.840]  will get violent they're already gonna have you all surveilled and ready for
[1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:33.080]  you and then yeah they don't care you go kill some people they're just gonna go
[1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:36.320]  after all veterans and all gun owners and and they're gonna try to have a
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:41.120]  domestic war it's also used to shut down the economy so how do you fix that you
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:44.680]  expose the whole paradigm the whole program the whole show the whole play
[1:57:44.680 --> 1:57:49.160]  and you warn people about it before it happens so you have credibility and we've
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:55.160]  done that we've got a chance to beat this there's a very bold plan
[1:57:55.160 --> 1:57:59.640]  Cyprus may now say the debt isn't there is because most of it isn't and say no to
[1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:06.720]  it and get their country back we can do what the people did in Iceland as well
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:11.040]  Cyprus is talking about it you either break with the New World Order and
[1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:17.240]  globalism globalism is the Communist Chinese telling us what to do somebody
[1:58:17.240 --> 1:58:21.760]  would have told you 20 years ago that the Communist Chinese would be dictating
[1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:25.840]  movies couldn't even have anything mildly against the Communist Party I mean
[1:58:25.840 --> 1:58:30.240]  that that puts us under the Communist Party China but that's so over the top
[1:58:30.240 --> 1:58:34.840]  people can't believe it even though it's real and admitted we are now under the
[1:58:34.840 --> 1:58:41.720]  New World Order Communist Party with bankers exempt from it about you are

[2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:49.920]  them back they're about ten years behind anonymous in Kentucky does this I mean
[2:02:49.920 --> 2:02:54.680]  answer your question of why things are like this we've got a bandwagon peer
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:03:02.600]  pressure driven junior high mentality country where the average man associates
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:07.560]  their tribalness with a football team or a baseball team or a hockey team and just
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:12.480]  kind of wattles around and you know might flip somebody off at a red light
[2:03:12.480 --> 2:03:17.760]  that's as manly as they get and a man obviously is informed about geopolitical
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:23.400]  issues of the information is available you know the dreams of our poor
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:29.720]  ancestors or know how to read and write and be free and have a renaissance now
[2:03:29.720 --> 2:03:33.960]  all the evidence is at our fingertips but you know people are just too lazy they
[2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:38.560]  don't respect themselves they don't imagine that they can put up a fight a
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:42.000]  lot of the public so pathetic you know even people that are awake think this
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:47.040]  show couldn't be real because there couldn't be any real opposition well
[2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:54.320]  just don't respect themselves anything else you want to answer yeah I do I for
[2:03:54.320 --> 2:03:58.520]  one well my earlier question about wanting to move to Texas for the family
[2:03:58.520 --> 2:04:02.440]  values and things that Texas isn't perfect by any stress the
[2:04:02.440 --> 2:04:07.320]  imagination but it is one of the better states right and secondly I've had in my
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:14.400]  life after not having credit cards paying in cash not following sports and I
[2:04:14.400 --> 2:04:19.440]  must have gotten informed that way but you know it's just I've gone around in
[2:04:19.440 --> 2:04:24.240]  public and gone to you know like truck stops or whatnot see military people and
[2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:28.720]  ask them you know are you planning on arresting me or shooting me and they go
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:32.440]  why not simple because you know they already time says I'm a terrorist and
[2:04:32.440 --> 2:04:36.240]  they just kind of laugh at me like that's ridiculous those are low-level
[2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:40.640]  compartmentalized people probably my highest level sergeant go talk to an
[2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:48.040]  army war college general and they'll they'll freak out on you absolutely but
[2:04:48.040 --> 2:04:52.720]  no no exactly we have to decompartmentalize this so their plan is broken
[2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:57.080]  that's the key more calls coming up we're gonna get dr. Pachinic on about

[2:06:12.840 --> 2:06:17.200]  the country in more than 50 years you may think out of sight out of mind and so
[2:06:17.200 --> 2:06:21.280]  you don't think you will be affected the fact is you are we all are food

[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.640]  resistance
[2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:22.280]  we're into hour number three and if I sound really negative and dark it's
[2:08:22.280 --> 2:08:26.880]  because that's how I personally feel but I'm negative about the corruption and
[2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:32.320]  about not just the corruption but the passiveness of the public but if you
[2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:38.960]  study history you study the psychology of cultures that are in decadent decline
[2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:43.200]  this is exactly what you would expect but but but here's the difference we have
[2:08:43.200 --> 2:08:46.920]  a lot of different high-tech things that are involved that are really wild cards
[2:08:46.920 --> 2:08:53.360]  for good for bad and for the ugly but if we don't get people really concerned
[2:08:53.360 --> 2:08:58.000]  and involved in active this country's done and the whole world is going to go
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:04.920]  into war that's what every major analyst is saying while we have these
[2:09:04.920 --> 2:09:09.280]  disconnected globalists that you know follow this whole transhumanist eugenics
[2:09:09.280 --> 2:09:13.920]  based global governance template but at the same time they're busy cheating
[2:09:13.920 --> 2:09:19.040]  each other as well and they're trying to create racial division divide and
[2:09:19.040 --> 2:09:23.920]  conquer while 85 billion dollars a month is given to private central banks and
[2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:30.320]  people like Peter Singer it's amazing and if we allow corruption to grow you
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:34.440]  know what's going to stop General Electric having Obama shut down 200
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:39.600]  power plants every couple years that they don't own massively increasing their
[2:09:39.600 --> 2:09:48.080]  profits see people tend to think of making profits by going and writing a
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:52.120]  book or producing a new widget or coming out with a new product that
[2:09:52.120 --> 2:09:55.800]  everybody wants and that's how you innovate civilizations but in command
[2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:01.200]  and control economies you have insiders that just shut down their competition
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:05.640]  and I know I talk about this at nauseam and you notice that the former head of
[2:10:05.640 --> 2:10:09.720]  the Office of Management and Budget David Stockman that's one of the most
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:13.800]  important offices you know economically in the federal government under Reagan
[2:10:13.800 --> 2:10:19.480]  he has come out and said quote we've been lied to robbed and misled and he
[2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:22.720]  goes on to say in an hour-long TV interview that there's an authoritarian
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:26.280]  takeover happening what did the head of the Dallas Federal Reserve say two
[2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:30.120]  weeks ago what did the head of the Kansas City Fed and I mean these are
[2:10:30.120 --> 2:10:34.920]  insiders but they understood they said crony capitalists have taken over and
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:39.560]  they're basically using economic warfare to shut down their competition and now
[2:10:39.560 --> 2:10:46.600]  the Communist Chinese have come out and they killed Red Dawn and made him
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:50.400]  re-edit that movie of a cost of five million dollars the new Red Dawn and
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:55.680]  now World War Z scene and I've read the book it's pro-Marxist though UN takes
[2:10:55.680 --> 2:10:58.840]  over and kills American gun owners they've been re-edited I don't know if
[2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:02.280]  this is in the the film I had an early script and I did a 15 minute
[2:11:02.280 --> 2:11:06.320]  presentation on that secrets of World War Z leaked but the Communist Chinese
[2:11:06.320 --> 2:11:12.480]  government demanded that they cut scenes they get final edit I mean think
[2:11:12.480 --> 2:11:16.720]  about that it used to be a scandal of the Pentagon was involved or the FBI wanted
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:23.880]  a certain message now the Communist Chinese have 10,000 scientists inside
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:27.760]  NASA everything's penetrated everything's infiltrated hundreds of thousands of
[2:11:27.760 --> 2:11:32.840]  private contractors we're gone folks we're done and there's no organization
[2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:37.240]  to this America is literally like a whore that's being sold out for a nickel
[2:11:37.240 --> 2:11:41.600]  on the side of them and there's a guys around the block here same thing with
[2:11:41.600 --> 2:11:45.240]  Europeans that they're now announcing I read the articles last hour they're just
[2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:48.160]  going to take everything out of the bank accounts now and give it to offshore
[2:11:48.160 --> 2:11:53.240]  banks and this is like Hitler's Blitzkrieg but it's an economic Blitzkrieg
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:57.320]  and and Dr. Steve Pacinac I wanted to get him on last week because he was only
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:00.520]  on for about 20 minutes to cover the waterfront with us because he talked
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:06.000]  about false flag mass shootings and I wanted to get him back on to elaborate
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:09.640]  on that because he ran psychological warfare operations with the State
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:14.600]  Department and vice the US Army and others and has been involved in
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:19.760]  overthrowing major governments you can look that up he has to talk about but
[2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:23.200]  you can look it up it's in major newspapers Steve Pacinac.com he also
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:26.280]  wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy that have been turned into major Hollywood
[2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:30.320]  films and the good news he told us last week is he goes to major Pentagon
[2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:34.640]  meetings and you know he still lectures there at different military colleges to
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:38.880]  the brass and you know he said a lot of them are listeners I already know that
[2:12:38.880 --> 2:12:42.360]  separately myself so that's a good indicator that you know they're
[2:12:42.360 --> 2:12:46.080]  concerned about what's happening and resonate with our message here it's not
[2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:51.080]  like it's a rocket science message the communist Chinese now dictate domestic
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:56.040]  media policy not just movies I mean this just shows how we're wide open I
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:12:59.840]  mean this is joke level and so I want to get his take on that what's happening in
[2:12:59.840 --> 2:13:04.600]  Cyprus what's happening in the power structure fishers because he's been a
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:08.960]  member of the Council on Foreign Relations as well Dr. Steve Pacinac
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:12.560]  great to have you on with us here today and I told you I want to cover the
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.600]  waterfront what do you make because I'm almost doing a ghost dance here I mean
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:21.160]  I'm just kind of as a psychiatrist as a doctor as a military man what is the
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:27.160]  psychology I'm going through grief I mean the collectivist are saying you're
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:31.280]  done we're going to wreck you they're celebrating the defacing of the of our
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:36.340]  free country they're celebrating the Balkanization the public's had a
[2:13:36.340 --> 2:13:41.320]  trance or those that are awake don't know what to do the public's voting by
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:46.280]  buying 10 million guns a month homeland securities arming against us I mean what
[2:13:46.280 --> 2:13:52.120]  are we seeing build up here well Alex let me rephrase the entire thing what
[2:13:52.120 --> 2:13:55.680]  are the reasons you and I get along so well and I do respect you's number one
[2:13:55.680 --> 2:14:00.400]  you do talk about the truth but I can understand why you're feeling depressed
[2:14:00.400 --> 2:14:06.320]  the truth is I am not ironically as much as you know and as much as I know let me
[2:14:06.320 --> 2:14:11.000]  rephrase it to be your audience so you'll understand why I'm not absolutely
[2:14:11.000 --> 2:14:14.840]  hey doc your cell phone your landlines breaking up a tiny bit can you talk
[2:14:14.840 --> 2:14:19.280]  right into the receiving cell phone the truth of the matter is I am not
[2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:23.840]  depressed several things happen today that I think indicates the American
[2:14:23.840 --> 2:14:28.120]  public is listening to you and they're listening basically to their own hearts
[2:14:28.120 --> 2:14:33.840]  let me give you an example today the prosecutors we've done a brilliant job
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:39.360]  in Colorado and Aurora and had what we call a gag order that means that no one
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:43.160]  but no one including the president of the United States the defense attorneys
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:47.800]  or anyone could talk about the killings that occurred with James Holmes when he
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:53.720]  killed and had killed 12 people and injured 58 in the movie theater in
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:59.080]  Aurora as we well know he was given the death sentence today now that may seem
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:04.080]  bizarre to most people but for me as someone who has run a unit for the
[2:15:04.080 --> 2:15:08.720]  criminal insane for over several years in the military in a St. Elizabeth's
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:13.200]  hospital this is a very important landmark for the American public what it
[2:15:13.200 --> 2:15:17.200]  says very simply it's not a bump on control it's not about mental illness
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:22.360]  it's about a system of law at least at the state level where you do have a death
[2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:26.720]  sentence and if you go in and you kill people they don't suddenly talk about
[2:15:26.720 --> 2:15:31.600]  gun control what happens is if you don't give the individual a label as they did
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:35.840]  in Sandy Hook where they said he asked Asperg is which he didn't have and a
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:43.760]  person existed in Mr. Holmes that did not exist in a new town and a whole
[2:15:43.760 --> 2:15:47.880]  story was fabricated by FEMA and Sandy Hook where it was not fabricated in
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:52.800]  Aurora what happened in Aurora is that the people of Colorado spoke and they
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:56.720]  said it's enough we don't want to hear about gun control we don't want to hear
[2:15:56.720 --> 2:16:00.960]  about psychiatric diagnosis we don't want to hear about the mentally ill and
[2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:06.120]  I am very proud to say that I may have been directly contributed to that concept
[2:16:06.120 --> 2:16:10.800]  that determination but I think it is a very important determination that
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:15.640]  James Holmes get the death penalty the reason for it is I have had criminal
[2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:19.640]  insane people and then they say oh that's not fair you know it's inhumane to
[2:16:19.640 --> 2:16:24.960]  put them in the gas chamber or to give them sodium ametal that's not inhumane
[2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:30.520]  what is inhumane is to put somebody in prison for 233 years consecutively and
[2:16:30.520 --> 2:16:34.760]  it means absolutely nothing what we're doing is just warehousing prisoners at
[2:16:34.760 --> 2:16:39.800]  the cost of $65,000 for the rest of their life in this case the prosecutors of
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:44.600]  Colorado including the FBI including many people on the federal level worked
[2:16:44.600 --> 2:16:49.240]  very efficiently to make sure that the defense attorney did not have any
[2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:53.520]  excuse and they could have had a psychiatric diagnosis but what happened
[2:16:53.520 --> 2:16:57.120]  and this is why I'm very impressed Alex and I think your audience should be
[2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:01.880]  impressed what happened is that because of the fence lawyers that did not do
[2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:05.800]  well and they broke what we call a gag order the same way the president of
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:10.120]  the United States booked a gag order on Sandy Hook which he should never have
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:14.440]  done if in fact there wasn't killing but there was no killing at Sandy Hook the
[2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:18.960]  president would have been indicted for a federal offense of the gag order so what
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:23.640]  happened in Aurora is not only an indictment of the criminal James Holmes
[2:17:23.640 --> 2:17:29.280]  indictment of the false flag of Sandy Hook so for me this is a very important
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:33.960]  day that your audience has to understand at this at the state and federal level
[2:17:33.960 --> 2:17:38.520]  working with FBI with US attorneys and with local prosecutors in Denver
[2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:44.800]  Colorado this is a major victory it marginalizes the absurdity of psychiatric
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:49.560]  diagnosis that allowed literally killers to get away with murder and I run those
[2:17:49.560 --> 2:17:53.440]  units and they were totally worthless let me let me stop you for a moment we've
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:57.320]  got a break here in about a minute and a half but okay again Dr. Steve Pachennick
[2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:01.760]  joins us here always always interested in and very informative I want to get
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:06.800]  your to it when I say I'm bummed out I'm not physically depressed I mean I feel
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:11.360]  great when I'm with my wife or my children I'm so sick of analyzing the
[2:18:11.360 --> 2:18:16.440]  accelerated rot and and and I'll be honest with you I see a lot of evidence
[2:18:16.440 --> 2:18:23.040]  of false flag at Sandy Hook I see even more when he's got a DARPA contract he's
[2:18:23.040 --> 2:18:27.800]  on all these drugs they want to give him truth serum to quote make him tell the
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:33.920]  truth on this you know you know to plead guilty I see false flag all over the
[2:18:33.920 --> 2:18:39.280]  place not just at Sandy Hook well let's limit it just to Sandy Hook because
[2:18:39.280 --> 2:18:42.560]  that's very important that was literally where the president took his
[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:46.640]  ground and made it he put a line in the sand and said this is where I stand
[2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:51.560]  these poor kids who would never killed he would never present and he created a
[2:18:51.560 --> 2:18:57.160]  total absurd scenario which made no sense had no credibility was inconsistent
[2:18:57.160 --> 2:19:02.360]  he used all these female executives who'd been in Texas in your area Mr. Gene
[2:19:02.360 --> 2:19:06.960]  Rose and Susan Collins who wrote a hundred games and this will take hundred
[2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:11.040]  million who wrote this type of scenario this is the beginning of the end of the
[2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:16.640]  false flags for FEMA for CIA and others so I see the upside to this Alex and you
[2:19:16.640 --> 2:19:21.640]  know I'm not I'm not an optimist I'm a realist on a realistic level I think we're
[2:19:21.640 --> 2:19:24.920]  gonna do much better and we'll get into North Korea and China and why we're
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:28.760]  gonna do much better there in the next hour and I'll explain it to you okay
[2:19:28.760 --> 2:19:31.440]  well explain to me your geopolitical perspective and what you're hearing from
[2:19:31.440 --> 2:19:36.440]  top brass and people but here's what I want to understand I get they do false
[2:19:36.440 --> 2:19:44.760]  flags okay but my my my issues was specifically as being somebody who has
[2:19:44.760 --> 2:19:48.920]  basically covered false flags and worked in the government as an expert on
[2:19:48.920 --> 2:19:53.120]  this what you're saying that tells you that no one was killed because in my
[2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:55.800]  experience when I do false flags why not kill some kids I mean they have more
[2:19:55.800 --> 2:20:00.320]  fun I mean if they enjoy their work we'll be right back

[2:24:06.120 --> 2:24:14.640]  radio network I was talking to Dr. Steve Pachinick during the break and I was
[2:24:14.640 --> 2:24:20.000]  asking him specifically why he thinks Sandy Hook had evidence of being a
[2:24:20.000 --> 2:24:23.720]  false flag and I'd like him now to repeat that information to you then I
[2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:27.160]  want to look at the geopolitical ramifications from his geopolitical
[2:24:27.160 --> 2:24:30.480]  perspective and his contacts on what's really happening in the world right now
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:35.000]  from Cyprus to North Korea and China and he's also worked in the financial
[2:24:35.000 --> 2:24:40.560]  sector so you can comment on that so doc what is your take on on Sandy Hook is
[2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:44.400]  it just all the clear scripting and how they were ready minute one and now it's
[2:24:44.400 --> 2:24:48.320]  come out that Bloomberg was ready months before and and then all the people that
[2:24:48.320 --> 2:24:52.920]  look and act like actors what's your take as an expert on this well this is a
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:56.720]  total script it would have come out of a woman who lives in Sandy Hook who's
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:59.920]  worth six hundred million dollars and you can call her up you can interview her
[2:24:59.920 --> 2:25:03.960]  name Susan Collins she's written all the hundred game movies and the hundred
[2:25:03.960 --> 2:25:08.160]  game books and literally it comes out of her script the assassination of
[2:25:08.160 --> 2:25:13.880]  children in schools, the assassination of children in a dystopic society, the fact
[2:25:13.880 --> 2:25:17.680]  that she had no comment, the fact that this almost came out of her own books on
[2:25:17.680 --> 2:25:23.280]  children in war and secondly you had a whole group of actors Gene Rosen who came
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:28.520]  out of the crisis actors group I always referred my readers to IS 42 social
[2:25:28.520 --> 2:25:32.920]  media emergency management the official course launched in summer by
[2:25:32.920 --> 2:25:37.720]  emergency management Institute which you and I pay for it has how the public
[2:25:37.720 --> 2:25:41.760]  proceeds community key organization in other words there's a whole school on how
[2:25:41.760 --> 2:25:45.680]  to create disasters and these children are also taught how to create disasters
[2:25:45.680 --> 2:25:49.680]  Gene Rosen was not only a not a psychologist but he was also president
[2:25:49.680 --> 2:25:54.680]  in Sandy Hook as a theme advisor and also in Texas plus you had kids who were
[2:25:54.680 --> 2:26:01.400]  in the various acting schools before you also had the frontline E&T people like
[2:26:01.400 --> 2:26:06.280]  Bengali, Flynn, Penn, Frank Chapman who were written about in the New York Times
[2:26:06.280 --> 2:26:10.280]  and gracefully in the New York Times they kind of implied these were absurd
[2:26:10.280 --> 2:26:13.960]  these were Irish cops who I haven't known Connecticut because I worked at
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:18.640]  Greenwich Connecticut so I know Sandy Hook very well it's a white very wealthy
[2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:23.600]  community filled with guns and alcohol but there is no evidence of a murder or
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:28.000]  a killing and in fact what you add is a violation of the gag order which is the
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:33.280]  prosecutorial evidence and everyone violated the gag order as in or in
[2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:37.920]  contrast to Aurora where the president respected it the prosecutors respected
[2:26:37.920 --> 2:26:41.880]  defense attorney and here you had a scripted story about some kid who had
[2:26:41.880 --> 2:26:46.120]  Asperger's by the way which is not a psychiatric disorder which does not have
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:50.840]  an increased proclivity to killing which did not have any history other than the
[2:26:50.840 --> 2:26:54.920]  fact that he had guns and his mother gave him guns and alcohol absolutely
[2:26:54.920 --> 2:26:59.360]  absurd inconsistent irrelevant and very dangerous for us well if you're gonna
[2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:04.120]  stage fast and furious to blame the Second Amendment why not why not do that
[2:27:04.120 --> 2:27:09.440]  and Obama urges quick adoption of the UN arms small arms treaties today this is
[2:27:09.440 --> 2:27:15.800]  all happening right now why do they want our guns so bad doc
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:20.960]  Obama's a very inspecial man from the day one one of the reasons I continually said
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:26.400]  I voted for Obama's on the first time was I wanted the public to see what
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:30.400]  happened it's not just Obama when you have a sociopath like Clinton who lied
[2:27:30.400 --> 2:27:35.480]  you had Bush jr. who lied and brought us to war to two wars and Stockman whom I've
[2:27:35.480 --> 2:27:40.000]  known that correctly said he bankrupted the country I wanted the America to see
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.960]  again what happens when you have a sociopath born and bred of the CIA of
[2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:49.920]  Chicago of pony capitalism of the Pritzker family of the daily family and
[2:27:49.920 --> 2:27:54.040]  what happens when you have people like this be the Republican or Democrats and
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:58.520]  they come and destroy our American system it's not a question whether he's a
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:02.720]  birth or not the question is he's not confident to serve as the president of
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:07.440]  the United States nor was Bush jr. nor was Clinton and what we're having is a
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:12.000]  degradation of the people going into politics and the explosion of the federal
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:16.400]  bureaucracy which is totally dysfunctional and causing us to get into a
[2:28:16.400 --> 2:28:22.240]  major recession and a very in self-destructiveness like Bush jr. Obama's
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:27.080]  very self-destructive he created the Osama bin Laden lie he created the Benghazi
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:30.960]  lied he created so many lies he doesn't even know where he's going now he's
[2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.840]  totally incompetent the only thing I would recommend is impeachment or getting
[2:28:35.840 --> 2:28:41.280]  out of it but unfortunately Biden who's the stupidest and astray is as Roger
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:45.800]  Ailes my friend said is also in line so we have incompetent people in the
[2:28:45.800 --> 2:28:50.240]  federal government however having said that let me go to the converse of what
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:55.280]  I was about to tell you in the end in our break which is you know I'm not worried
[2:28:55.280 --> 2:28:59.800]  about China and I'm not worried about our banking system although and let me go
[2:28:59.800 --> 2:29:02.880]  around the world after having told you how incompetent the president
[2:29:02.880 --> 2:29:07.120]  fortunately our government is so decentralized and our military is so
[2:29:07.120 --> 2:29:11.760]  effective that right now we have a pre-positioning of our military units
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:16.440]  including the F-22s are synced and commanders in the South Sea that can
[2:29:16.440 --> 2:29:21.560]  contain North Korea which seems to be an incredible threat but in fact is going
[2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:25.880]  through a kabuki that has been going on for over 30 years that I was involved
[2:29:25.880 --> 2:29:30.160]  with the president leader doesn't matter his name Kim Jong-un UN and his
[2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:36.000]  grandfather Kim O'Silm Kim Jong-il all of those family members I knew they
[2:29:36.000 --> 2:29:39.760]  went the same thing if they don't like what they are hearing they like to throw
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:43.920]  a tantrum they threaten America they threaten South Korea but the truth of
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:47.320]  the matter is there's so much power stay there we will cover when we come back
[2:29:47.320 --> 2:29:54.840]  from break stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[2:29:54.840 --> 2:29:58.800]  and the GCN radio network

[2:30:05.120 --> 2:30:08.920]  threat of martial law have highlighted the need for Americans to prepare for
[2:30:08.920 --> 2:30:13.760]  emergencies as a result millions are stockpiling food gold and weapons but

[2:33:11.680 --> 2:33:16.080]  you know daughter Pachanik was a major hostage negotiator and helped write the
[2:33:16.080 --> 2:33:21.080]  policy of the State Department on that he helped negotiate one of the only
[2:33:21.080 --> 2:33:28.160]  programs out there that was actually effective in getting a mithy's peace
[2:33:28.160 --> 2:33:32.240]  deal done of course they just assassinated the leader of Egypt and
[2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:35.480]  when he starts talking about Sandy Hook single signs that it was totally stage
[2:33:35.480 --> 2:33:39.520]  it just blows me away because you know I can't prove it either way there's a lot
[2:33:39.520 --> 2:33:44.480]  of suspicious signs there and a lot of issues but but I also see that on on the
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:50.120]  aurora front I just know this they know that guns have made violent crime go
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:34:02.960]  down 49% they know that and they want our guns so that we can be politically
[2:34:02.960 --> 2:34:09.120]  dominated and doc I want to look at the geopolitical because obviously you know
[2:34:09.120 --> 2:34:13.600]  when I say I'm concerned about China I'm concerned about the globalist using
[2:34:13.600 --> 2:34:17.880]  China to leverage out our industry letting the communist Chinese dictate
[2:34:17.880 --> 2:34:23.600]  things and I'm talking about the establishment here that is raising taxes
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:28.160]  raising payroll taxes on poor people California trying to bankrupt their
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:36.680]  state just all of the aggressive stuff that we're seeing being carried out
[2:34:36.680 --> 2:34:42.600]  against people the aggressiveness of the establishment and the fact that more
[2:34:42.600 --> 2:34:47.280]  and more corruption is gotten away with that's what I'm saying freaks me out and
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:51.400]  then the collective is saying Obama he's our great leader we've taken over and
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:58.400]  and and selling this whole hoax that collectivism is a good idea when
[2:34:58.400 --> 2:35:02.240]  obviously it always creates a nightmare but plus the collectivist lie and say
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:07.200]  it's not crony capitalism which is even worse with a bunch of insiders above the
[2:35:07.200 --> 2:35:10.520]  law that's my point so I wanted to ask you you were telling me off air that a
[2:35:10.520 --> 2:35:14.040]  lot of people you talked to the high levels of the military and others you
[2:35:14.040 --> 2:35:17.440]  know that they recognize your voice just from being on the show when you're
[2:35:17.440 --> 2:35:22.200]  walking around talking you know in the in the corridors that you travel and so
[2:35:22.200 --> 2:35:25.920]  I see that as a good sign that people in the power structure know there's a
[2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:30.720]  problem but major societies major empires don't usually get overthrown
[2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:37.280]  they commit suicide and I see the elite committing suicide politically I see
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:42.440]  them just wrecking everything and and are you saying I'm wrong on that front
[2:35:42.440 --> 2:35:45.320]  because I'm not just talking about geopolitical issues I understand
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:49.280]  China's a teetering basket case and all that I understand North Korea is a
[2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:54.600]  basket case my issue is is that it is that I see our establishment acting
[2:35:54.600 --> 2:36:00.000]  more and more delusional like Kim Jong-un I mean I just I'm just sick of it go
[2:36:00.000 --> 2:36:04.800]  ahead I got you I don't disagree with you what you really talking about Alex
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:09.120]  and what most of us despise and I do too and that's why I go on your show and
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:12.560]  I've done that for 10 years is that our federal power has exceeded the
[2:36:12.560 --> 2:36:18.000]  capacity to really be functional it's self-destructive it started up for 30
[2:36:18.000 --> 2:36:22.200]  years ago under Clinton it went through Bush we went into Iraq Afghanistan
[2:36:22.200 --> 2:36:26.000]  Pakistan Syria would totally self-destructive that's why we have
[2:36:26.000 --> 2:36:30.960]  to have a devolution of federal power the so-called elite is no longer an elite
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:35.360]  what's really happening and why I'm optimistic and it's not just an accident
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:39.240]  you have to be in North Texas it's accounts on foreign relations that's
[2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:43.160]  finished the Northeast established and it's pretty much finished the Brookings
[2:36:43.160 --> 2:36:47.600]  US Institute of Peace the Rand Corporation all of those institutions that
[2:36:47.600 --> 2:36:52.400]  I have been a part of are all dying or dead there's a reason why much of the
[2:36:52.400 --> 2:36:57.680]  industry and much of the capabilities are going down South into Georgia North
[2:36:57.680 --> 2:37:02.280]  Carolina South Carolina Florida Texas forget California they will always be a
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:06.480]  basket case to get New York to get Illinois to get Michigan there's a
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:11.200]  demographic shift that's happening by nature the fact that we have to have
[2:37:11.200 --> 2:37:15.560]  areas where we don't have taxes at the state level at the local level and
[2:37:15.560 --> 2:37:19.440]  where local communities are really functioning and we see that in many of
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:23.400]  the major states so I'm not that pessimistic as you are and do I see
[2:37:23.400 --> 2:37:28.320]  chronic capitalism absolutely JPMorgan Jamie Diamond I've been asking him over
[2:37:28.320 --> 2:37:31.680]  10 years I think he's a disaster I think JPMorgan should have been in
[2:37:31.680 --> 2:37:37.640]  prison the whole bank I think Goldman Sachs, Blankfein, Ruben all of them
[2:37:37.640 --> 2:37:41.240]  should have been in prison but they've been part of the chronic capitalism of
[2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:45.240]  every congressman and senator I could name including the president Clinton
[2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:50.080]  Bush Jr. and Obama but once we get federal prosecutors in there once we
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:54.640]  get it at the state level we can break it into that system and we can devolve
[2:37:54.640 --> 2:37:58.120]  the power in other words the governors have to become more important the local
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:02.160]  communities have to become important and in that sense when you really understand
[2:38:02.160 --> 2:38:06.440]  America having lived in Montana and other states you see that the real power
[2:38:06.440 --> 2:38:10.800]  you don't call the federal government to have your sewage system cleaned up or
[2:38:10.800 --> 2:38:15.400]  built you call up your local commission and that's the power in Texas and we
[2:38:15.400 --> 2:38:19.160]  say in Texas often and I remember working to Secretary of State Baker you
[2:38:19.160 --> 2:38:23.000]  have the Republic of Texas I mean that the governor of the governor wasn't
[2:38:23.000 --> 2:38:26.800]  kidding when he said I can secede from the Union there is in fact the fact of
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:31.240]  the session from the Union as the federal establishment becomes too big
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:35.480]  and unable to control itself so what you're saying is the federal establishment
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:40.320]  under Obama acting out a total desperation to act out of his self
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:45.520]  destructiveness creating wars we don't need now the contrast to that is we're
[2:38:45.520 --> 2:38:49.480]  going to put in the local rule which is a very important rule that limits the
[2:38:49.480 --> 2:38:53.880]  about the bank who can charge and will break up their actions on the direct
[2:38:53.880 --> 2:38:58.440]  derivatives and the options in the repo all these fancy things I've been I had
[2:38:58.440 --> 2:39:02.760]  been on investment banker my job was to take down Kidder Peabody in six months
[2:39:02.760 --> 2:39:08.000]  we took down 600 million and we cleaned it out 1986 I was brought in by the SNL
[2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:12.000]  in Maryland I cleaned out the entire SNL system and all of those in the
[2:39:12.000 --> 2:39:16.040]  resolution trust in the 80s we cleaned it out from Maryland all the way down to
[2:39:16.040 --> 2:39:19.840]  Texas and by the way it wasn't an accident that the SNL scandal was
[2:39:19.840 --> 2:39:24.240]  started by Neal and Marvin Bush so you got a lot of your Texas boys getting us
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:28.120]  into trouble on the other end and then our Texas boys getting us into trouble
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:33.320]  on the federal end so you got to clean out your own house down there but I am
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:37.760]  much more optimistic because we're a big country and we have a lot of
[2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:41.640]  resources and at the local level you cannot take against the way you can
[2:39:41.640 --> 2:39:45.840]  dream about it you could put whatever you want in legislation but Nancy Pelosi
[2:39:45.840 --> 2:39:50.360]  and all the others who are liberals who are very wealthy crony capitalists from
[2:39:50.360 --> 2:39:54.600]  Maryland and from San Francisco they can dream on but there's never going to be
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:39:58.280]  legislation to take away our guns there's never going to be a capability to
[2:39:58.280 --> 2:40:02.000]  take away our guns there's never going to be an ability to act at the local
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:07.560]  level that's why we are a huge local country and we're based on local values
[2:40:07.560 --> 2:40:12.080]  and local principles that's why we're so diversified the other part of it
[2:40:12.080 --> 2:40:17.040]  ironically even though you feel very depressed and really you know concerned
[2:40:17.040 --> 2:40:20.000]  and I understand it we're doing better than Europe let me give you an example
[2:40:20.000 --> 2:40:25.240]  Cyprus has always been known to many of us in the national security as a dumping
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:29.960]  spot for black money for the Russians Putin did it all the oligarchs did it
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:34.000]  basically these were Russian Jewish oligarchs who came in under Yeltsin when
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.360]  we broke up the Soviet Union we made a mistake we should have gotten rid of all
[2:40:37.360 --> 2:40:41.800]  those guys but they were given out all the ex-KGB guys were given out parts of
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:47.440]  youth you call of gas prom all the basic companies and they didn't know how to
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:51.640]  run it the Russians by nature are not great managers by nature they're very
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:55.680]  good at mathematics they have a great education system but they corrupt the
[2:40:55.680 --> 2:40:59.880]  system is corrupt now Russia has to deal with the system that's corrupt but
[2:40:59.880 --> 2:41:04.920]  we're maintaining Russia and Putin and how do we do that because of people down
[2:41:04.920 --> 2:41:09.680]  in Texas if they maintain the price of gas and oil at 60 to 70 dollars per
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:14.120]  barrel then Putin stays in power if we want to take him out of power we bring
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:18.960]  it down to 40 and 30 dollars an app about a barrel and he's out of power why
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:22.880]  because the only thing that sustains Putin and the oligarchs in Russia is
[2:41:22.880 --> 2:41:27.600]  our ability in the Texas area and in Louisiana and elsewhere to maintain the
[2:41:27.600 --> 2:41:33.400]  price of oil at about 70 to 80 or 60 to 80 dollars in that range because then he
[2:41:33.400 --> 2:41:37.720]  can sell the gas to Germany so what happened in Cyprus what really happened
[2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:41.680]  in Europe is that it was a war between France and Germany it wasn't a technical
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:45.720]  war but it was the old war World War one World War two but now this was a
[2:41:45.720 --> 2:41:49.880]  financial war France made an attempt through the Maastricht agreement in
[2:41:49.880 --> 2:41:55.040]  1950s and 60s up to 1980 when I was in France I knew this wouldn't work and
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:41:59.320]  France tried to corner Germany by saying we're all going to unify we're all
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:02.840]  going to get away of our printing presses and we're going to get one currency
[2:42:02.840 --> 2:42:07.080]  called the euro it never worked the reason it doesn't work is because each
[2:42:07.080 --> 2:42:11.640]  country needs its own printing machine in order to get out of deflation and what
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:16.200]  happened in effect was that Germany under Angela Merkel who came out of East
[2:42:16.200 --> 2:42:19.560]  Germany we knew a lot about her because her father was a Lutheran who worked with
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:25.000]  our CIA and by the way Putin was trained by the East Germans in the Stasi and he
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:28.760]  was more German than he is Russian so Angela Merkel and Putin are very close
[2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:33.160]  together they understand the problem and Merkel has been intimidating France
[2:42:33.160 --> 2:42:38.440]  Spain Portugal and Italy there's such an extent that they're forcing them to get
[2:42:38.440 --> 2:42:42.280]  into an austerity program where you already have unemployment of 25 to
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:47.040]  20 30 percent that means millions of young people are out of work here in the
[2:42:47.040 --> 2:42:51.440]  United States we have an unemployment of people who are not working fully but
[2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:55.320]  we're able to bring up our machinery very quickly because we're based on one
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:59.640]  concept that no government and no amount of legislation can break up and that's
[2:42:59.640 --> 2:43:02.680]  what I believe in and you believe in Alex and our people believe in and that's
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:07.400]  entrepreneurship we're a country based on individualism entrepreneurship and
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:11.840]  the ability to take risks Europe is not there is not one country in Europe and
[2:43:11.840 --> 2:43:15.320]  I've been through all of them that's based on risk on calculated risk and the
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:20.560]  ability to go over sure but let me ask you this question I mean are you it's a
[2:43:20.560 --> 2:43:24.560]  big deal to have the globalist so invest in the Anglo-American establishment in
[2:43:24.560 --> 2:43:30.160]  China to where now they openly control what can be in movies and things and I'm
[2:43:30.160 --> 2:43:35.800]  saying long-term or even in the midterm where do you see all this going well I
[2:43:35.800 --> 2:43:39.760]  honestly I you know I've critical I've been of our presidents but I've never
[2:43:39.760 --> 2:43:43.800]  been critical of our country number one no countries in worse shape than China
[2:43:43.800 --> 2:43:48.040]  might be a friend and I say that with glee because I know the Chinese sons the
[2:43:48.040 --> 2:43:52.600]  days that don't chow ping and change men they have now a technocrat who spent
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:58.520]  time in Indiana Chitong and the problem with China is two things only one is
[2:43:58.520 --> 2:44:03.240]  political stability as you said on your radio and I've said it repeatedly in a
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:08.840]  good year is a good year in China you have over 75,000 riots on corruption alone
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:13.440]  this year alone you will have over 150,000 riots that have to do with
[2:44:13.440 --> 2:44:18.320]  corruption the second biggest problem for China that they cannot geopolitically
[2:44:18.320 --> 2:44:23.480]  fix and that will then damn them to the end of their civilization and they know
[2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:28.000]  that that's why they're in trouble and that is water no one has the water in
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:32.080]  China the way we had water in the United States we have the Mississippi we have
[2:44:32.080 --> 2:44:37.000]  the Ohio we have the all our rivers and mountains in China you only have one major
[2:44:37.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  river that's the Yangtze River that divides China to the north and the south
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:45.920]  and they've got to build all their industries harpoon and high bank all
[2:44:45.920 --> 2:44:50.840]  along the Yangtze River you've got 1.3 billion people who have to depend on a
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:56.160]  Yalu River and a Yangtze it doesn't work they know it I know it our national
[2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:00.600]  security team knows it which done back 30 40 years all the way to Kissinger and
[2:45:00.600 --> 2:45:05.640]  we know that half a billion people in China have no water in the Gobi Desert
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:10.640]  and that China is already choking to the brim so whatever they want to do here in
[2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:16.480]  terms of changing our our software or doing cyber attacks they're basically
[2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:20.720]  playing on the fiddle while Rome is burning because I can guarantee you in
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:26.040]  Beijing Shanghai Harbin all those areas you will have riots because the
[2:45:26.040 --> 2:45:29.520]  students who are coming out with the grease and electronic engineers are
[2:45:29.520 --> 2:45:33.160]  porters and they have even another problem the students don't want to work
[2:45:33.160 --> 2:45:36.880]  because these are the princelings that they had from before where they had a
[2:45:36.880 --> 2:45:40.800]  one-child policy when you have a one-child policy and they've been in
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:45.680]  totally enamored and indentured to the fact that they don't have to do anything
[2:45:45.680 --> 2:45:49.760]  the entitlement of these kids they don't want to go to the military they don't
[2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:53.160]  want to work at jobs that they weren't entitled to and you don't have the
[2:45:53.160 --> 2:45:57.360]  resources so when you don't have water you don't have a capacity to grow and
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:46:01.280]  you're having a make-believe economy that they made up a number saying seven
[2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:05.280]  percent growth there is no seven percent growth because on a technical level
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:09.320]  when they loan out all their money from their central banks they don't mark to
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:13.080]  the market that means that they loan out a million dollars they claim that's a
[2:46:13.080 --> 2:46:16.320]  million dollars worth of goods the truth is they loan out a million dollars they
[2:46:16.320 --> 2:46:20.000]  don't collect a dollar and I was there when they were building houses and they
[2:46:20.000 --> 2:46:25.320]  were empty and complete and disastrous I'm very optimistic America will exceed
[2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:31.080]  and dominate all of China our Navy has the ability to deny them access through
[2:46:31.080 --> 2:46:35.440]  any lane that they want including the straits of Malacca so I'm not worried
[2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:39.640]  about that I'm not worried about Europe the run on Europe will not affect the
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:44.320]  United States hopefully it'll take down some of our biggest banks JP Morgan Chase
[2:46:44.320 --> 2:46:48.720]  Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley all the chronic capitalism banks but not our
[2:46:48.720 --> 2:46:53.400]  local and regional banks or our credit unions and in turn what happens that we
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:46:57.280]  will grow at the local level not at the federal level if you look at what they
[2:46:57.280 --> 2:47:00.480]  did in the bailout I mean they've written it to take over the local blunt
[2:47:00.480 --> 2:47:05.800]  banks to prop up the big ones but but I agree this could actually be used like a
[2:47:05.800 --> 2:47:10.480]  fever to kind of burn out the infection and get us into a better you know
[2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:17.880]  position here what do you see the big anti gun push that we will not have a
[2:47:17.880 --> 2:47:22.120]  fact we will not have a presidential candidate who is really effective
[2:47:22.120 --> 2:47:26.040]  everybody's talking about a little bit of Obama's pretty much the last of a
[2:47:26.040 --> 2:47:30.080]  sociopath that will come in line he's like his way right into self-destruction
[2:47:30.080 --> 2:47:35.000]  that's why I wanted the people to see this it began with Clinton it got on
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:39.720]  with Hillary Clinton went on with Bush Jr. with Cheney with Rumsfeld retired but
[2:47:39.720 --> 2:47:43.320]  what's happening is their governor's all over the state including your own
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:47.680]  governors in Florida elsewhere where the governor's are saying you know what
[2:47:47.680 --> 2:47:51.240]  let the federal government do what they do we're going to raise our own capacity
[2:47:51.240 --> 2:47:55.000]  we're going to give tax credits and we're going to build cars and Carolina's
[2:47:55.000 --> 2:48:00.160]  in Florida no I agree you're seeing a major nullification tent amendment move
[2:48:00.160 --> 2:48:03.760]  and that's what I've called for a second American Revolution based on just
[2:48:03.760 --> 2:48:08.680]  pulling out and a velvet revolution of ideas it's just my issue is Homeland
[2:48:08.680 --> 2:48:14.640]  Security has its entire system arrayed and now is unclogged and admits aimed at
[2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:19.740]  shutting down states rights blowing stuff up and blaming it on domestic
[2:48:19.740 --> 2:48:24.800]  liberty groups so I'm saying dr. Pachinik a do you see them priming the pump
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:29.880]  for that I know I do and be let me put it this way Homeland Security is a
[2:48:29.880 --> 2:48:34.640]  disaster the Palatano is a disaster everybody I just talked to somebody from
[2:48:34.640 --> 2:48:38.760]  Homeland Security is pretty high up this past weekend and this person reaffirmed
[2:48:38.760 --> 2:48:43.520]  from it is a total fool bar it's fucked up beyond any right let's hold on doc
[2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:50.120]  can't talk like that we got a delay that because it cannot function you can't
[2:48:50.120 --> 2:48:54.680]  have secret service which is totally worthless you can't have the martial
[2:48:54.680 --> 2:48:58.680]  service all of these services are totally dysfunctional they will not
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:03.920]  survive within a system which is based on entrepreneurship and free markets we
[2:49:03.920 --> 2:49:07.680]  don't need it and they can do whatever they try to do FEMA didn't work they
[2:49:07.680 --> 2:49:11.600]  didn't work in the storms they weren't able to handle New Jersey they weren't
[2:49:11.600 --> 2:49:16.280]  able to handle New York so by attrition and by incompetence that's the beauty of
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:19.960]  America is that really the best message here is that people know government
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:24.720]  can't and won't protect them and so people more and more are voting I mean I
[2:49:24.720 --> 2:49:29.520]  think that's a positive sign 10 million guns being sold a month and and people
[2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:33.720]  not trusting the system that's what America was founded on and they're
[2:49:33.720 --> 2:49:37.320]  calling it extremism but people really are getting back to common sense and
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:43.800]  you're saying that it's a hoax that collectivism is really taking over and
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:47.360]  is one that's just their attempt to create a bandwagon effect that's
[2:49:47.360 --> 2:49:51.480]  correct I mean basically it's the incompetent saying that we can do things
[2:49:51.480 --> 2:49:55.040]  when in fact they're showing that it's completely self-destructive every time
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:59.600]  they do a black ops so they try to do a simulation like a FEMA exercise and it
[2:49:59.600 --> 2:50:03.760]  blows back in the world of technology and high tech when you have a country as
[2:50:03.760 --> 2:50:08.560]  big as we are I mean we are huge it is very hard for the federal government to
[2:50:08.560 --> 2:50:13.960]  implement any type of law if you don't have a national police force and we do
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:17.040]  not have an and they're trying to set that up though so the answer is I won't
[2:50:17.040 --> 2:50:21.360]  do it and on a local level I've worked with a lot of local police God bless a
[2:50:21.360 --> 2:50:25.400]  local police because they will never tolerate and I wrote it in the state of
[2:50:25.400 --> 2:50:30.520]  emergency where we had at night County Nevada where we had a standoff between
[2:50:30.520 --> 2:50:36.560]  the local Nevada police state troopers versus federal troopers and we won the
[2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:41.200]  states one what's happening again is a recapitulation of the Civil War but in
[2:50:41.200 --> 2:50:46.680]  a much more economic fashion the states will succeed in it the factor way not in
[2:50:46.680 --> 2:50:51.440]  a jury and no I agree that's actually what I've called for absolutely wow well
[2:50:51.440 --> 2:50:55.440]  said a second few few calls for dr. Steve Pacinic on the other side of this
[2:50:55.440 --> 2:51:01.480]  quick break eight hundred two five nine nine two three one stay with us in the

[2:54:28.000 --> 2:54:32.840]  go ahead and throw that out there real quick sir how you doing Alex I actually
[2:54:32.840 --> 2:54:37.960]  had a couple questions if it was possible one from Mr. Pachennick I was
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:47.160]  just wondering if if they financially it ever did you know happen here if you
[2:54:47.160 --> 2:54:50.720]  think that we would follow you know like Cypress and Iceland if they would
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:55:00.120]  follow Iceland's rule and arrest the bankers twice we had it in 1986 when we
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:04.800]  had to shut down the SNL's and we were quickly able to resolve it in 2008 when
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:10.680]  Bush created the financial crisis we were able to bail out the banks I'm not a
[2:55:10.680 --> 2:55:14.960]  big believer in the banks I don't think we need the big banks they totally
[2:55:14.960 --> 2:55:22.040]  there for their own profit and have no real value versus their capacity and
[2:55:22.040 --> 2:55:26.400]  then network they should be taken down systematically and all we really need is
[2:55:26.400 --> 2:55:31.040]  transfer funds quite frankly without complicating the issue there's a whole
[2:55:31.040 --> 2:55:34.520]  new currency on the internet and many of your followers may know that it's called
[2:55:34.520 --> 2:55:39.120]  Bitcoin which means that we can use any other type of currencies if we want to
[2:55:39.120 --> 2:55:45.240]  instead of the dollar the gold is now securitized as a piece of paper so in
[2:55:45.240 --> 2:55:49.560]  terms of banking it's an antiquated system what you have in banking basically
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:53.800]  is a bunch of binary numbers one and zero going up to the cloud or cloud
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:55:58.440]  computing and then some bank like TD or Bank of America tells you you're secure
[2:55:58.440 --> 2:56:02.360]  but the truth of the matter is you're not anybody can access it and they're not
[2:56:02.360 --> 2:56:07.200]  anything more than just a binary collector there's no value to bankers and
[2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:11.760]  banks in itself so I wouldn't worry about it but we do have a capacity to
[2:56:11.760 --> 2:56:16.680]  basically barter any commodity we monitor in other words information goods
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:21.240]  trades you know I like what you're saying but the bottom line there's a
[2:56:21.240 --> 2:56:26.240]  revolution going on and all the tyranny we see is the establishment trying to
[2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:31.280]  put the brakes on things my issue is is if we don't get active they're gonna end
[2:56:31.280 --> 2:56:35.760]  up succeeding and suppressing a new renaissance but that's a really good
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:40.560]  question Alex yeah I agree with Alex I think there is a revolution going on in
[2:56:40.560 --> 2:56:44.960]  all fronts banking entrepreneurship and business but I don't think this
[2:56:44.960 --> 2:56:48.560]  government will succeed or any federal government because by nature they're
[2:56:48.560 --> 2:56:52.200]  there to please each other and they're totally incompetent they've been there
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:56:56.720]  for 36 years the average time of the senator or congressman they're afraid
[2:56:56.720 --> 2:57:00.180]  to go out at the business and we're basically an entrepreneur are they
[2:57:00.180 --> 2:57:05.920]  trying to start a civil war coming after our guns well I think they they don't
[2:57:05.920 --> 2:57:09.560]  even think of that in terms of a civil war if they did there would be a civil
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:14.280]  war but they can't even you know this is not that Abraham Lincoln who created a
[2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:18.800]  civil war what I call the northern invasion I mean he's deified I don't
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:23.640]  particularly think he is a great president I think he was what was said
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:27.840]  about the booth will spoof sex tempest to run if he basically suppressed our
[2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:32.720]  freedom and created an aggression to maintain the viability of the republic
[2:57:32.720 --> 2:57:37.360]  in order to have railroads and to have the north south trade agreement with a
[2:57:37.360 --> 2:57:42.080]  north basically dominated the south so that type of situation will not occur
[2:57:42.080 --> 2:57:47.000]  again the south is far more dominant at this point the factories occurring in
[2:57:47.000 --> 2:57:50.320]  Texas Carolina no but you're right the so-called left
[2:57:50.320 --> 2:57:55.320]  authoritarians they fantasize about a new civil war and MSNBC I called them the
[2:57:55.320 --> 2:57:59.240]  new Ku Klux Klan and it made huge headlines because all they do is talk
[2:57:59.240 --> 2:58:03.960]  about race and the Klan was a Democratic Party group around race the
[2:58:03.960 --> 2:58:07.960]  Democrats now are trying to base everything on racial division hence
[2:58:07.960 --> 2:58:12.480]  Ku Klux Klan well I I get what you mean but I don't think there's any validity
[2:58:12.480 --> 2:58:16.920]  anymore to Republican a Democrat no no I agree but I'm saying the Democrats are
[2:58:16.920 --> 2:58:22.400]  trying to create a racial no I understand but basically race now is
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:26.600]  almost the one thing that Obama may have done is that there's no more excuse
[2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:30.320]  for anybody to say I'm black and if I could not do anything once you have a
[2:58:30.320 --> 2:58:34.560]  president who's black that pretty much erases the notion that everybody was
[2:58:34.560 --> 2:58:38.640]  suppressed it was black I tell you what let's come back and take a few calls I'm
[2:58:38.640 --> 2:58:43.280]  just so sick of hearing about race sick of it I'm sick of it thank you for

[3:00:20.400 --> 3:00:26.680]  Alex Jones what is America's underlying core that's made us so successful
[3:00:26.680 --> 3:00:31.920]  don't tread on me we need to rediscover that or we'll be slaged me and the Dr.
[3:00:31.920 --> 3:00:36.480]  Pachinic we're just talking about there in the break speaking of doc Dr. D you
[3:00:36.480 --> 3:00:41.320]  disagree with Dr. Pachinic of Steve Pachinic.com best-selling author you
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:46.280]  find out stuff there at the site Dr. D you're on the air go ahead Alex thank
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:49.480]  you for taking my car how you doing today Dr. Pachinic and Alex
[3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:57.240]  his privilege is having you sir go ahead thanks for giving alternative to the
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:01:04.880]  low-grade moron slime stream media thank you that as far as that no bomber
[3:01:04.880 --> 3:01:09.640]  character not Obama no bomber I was early in the game of attacking Obama
[3:01:09.640 --> 3:01:14.320]  because I think it was a fraud he was like this cousin Bush and Cheney
[3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:19.720]  Dr. Pachinic I think Alex is well-founded in his concerns about
[3:01:19.720 --> 3:01:26.400]  China and I would look at the past history of China 1839 opium war where
[3:01:26.400 --> 3:01:30.160]  they took a tool recently over China and the majority of the Chinese were large
[3:01:30.160 --> 3:01:34.080]  secondary I'll say was very angry with America about that two hundred and some
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:39.640]  years later almost I think China is totally ruthless enough to if they need
[3:01:39.640 --> 3:01:43.440]  water all their neighbors but start shaking in fear because I hear the
[3:01:43.440 --> 3:01:47.160]  next great war that's going to be fun and it's going to be about water and it
[3:01:47.160 --> 3:01:52.760]  will be started to be but let me let me just stop you here the issue for water
[3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:58.040]  for China will not be directed towards us it will be directed towards another
[3:01:58.040 --> 3:02:03.120]  country but you hit on a very good point dr. D and that was China's next war if
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:06.680]  there is to be a war and it may well be a war it will not be with the United
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:11.760]  States it will be with India because the only source of water that China has
[3:02:11.760 --> 3:02:17.120]  isn't Tibet so the issue of Tibet is not about the Dalai Lama's everybody thought
[3:02:17.120 --> 3:02:21.040]  Richard Gears concerned whether the Dalai Lama's alive or not it really is
[3:02:21.040 --> 3:02:26.080]  about the Kilimanjaro the mountains of the Himalayas that have the snow and the
[3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:31.680]  capacity to allow the waters to come down into China and particularly into the
[3:02:31.680 --> 3:02:36.440]  Danbley so I predict that what will happen within the next five years is
[3:02:36.440 --> 3:02:40.320]  you're going to see conflagrations between China and India more than you
[3:02:40.320 --> 3:02:44.400]  will with the China in the United States because China is divided north and
[3:02:44.400 --> 3:02:48.680]  south and it's divided between the rich and the poor cities and that's why we
[3:02:48.680 --> 3:02:52.560]  see Pakistan being driven in the arms of the communist Chinese I care about the
[3:02:52.560 --> 3:02:56.520]  Chinese people and I look at Al Gore and his Foxconn factories it's all
[3:02:56.520 --> 3:03:02.160]  disgusting Dr. D did you have a come back to that yes sir my thing Alex is there
[3:03:02.160 --> 3:03:06.280]  is going to be a greater war in terms of contact that they're going to go ahead
[3:03:06.280 --> 3:03:10.840]  to come out of China and there's going to be a conflict about resources I do not
[3:03:10.840 --> 3:03:15.200]  perceive the Chinese is going to allow themselves to be floccaries and check
[3:03:15.200 --> 3:03:20.400]  bullies for the Zionist entities that that's in large control of large parts
[3:03:20.400 --> 3:03:24.280]  in this world that's where I see the conflict I see this flow mission creep
[3:03:24.280 --> 3:03:29.960]  into the Western Hemisphere and I think when that time comes that they have
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:33.280]  expeditionary force here I think it would become clear to all these so-called
[3:03:33.280 --> 3:03:38.320]  intelligence people who couldn't find they tailbones with both hands all right
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:42.840]  very interesting point let me get Dr. Pachennick's final word on that I'm not
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:46.360]  worried about China I'm not worried about Zionists I'm not all of these things
[3:03:46.360 --> 3:03:50.680]  are gone by the wayside we're moving at a very fast pace now in the United States
[3:03:50.680 --> 3:03:56.240]  information capability and cyber war are the initial issues for us I'm worried
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:04:00.560]  about the singularity and in humans letting this get out of control and all
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:05.400]  this genetic engineering I'm worried about major disasters with that stuff
[3:04:05.400 --> 3:04:09.600]  unchecked well I don't know about genetic engineering but the one thing that
[3:04:09.600 --> 3:04:14.040]  could create a major disasters a flu virus that we can't control like we
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:19.680]  had right now in Shanghai that comes onto a plane and it spreads very quickly but
[3:04:19.680 --> 3:04:24.560]  we can't look at our disaster scenarios if you go nuts if you look at it all day
[3:04:24.560 --> 3:04:29.360]  long what you have to look at is basically why we are so big and capable of
[3:04:29.360 --> 3:04:33.600]  growing so quickly and changing no other country can do that neither China
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:38.640]  India Russia or anyone in the European all right listen very thought-provoking
[3:04:38.640 --> 3:04:42.000]  talk thank you so much Dr. Steve Pachennick will see about you during the
[3:04:42.000 --> 3:04:46.560]  spring tonight seven o'clock in four wars nightly news a lot of key special
[3:04:46.560 --> 3:04:50.280]  reports I'm just trying to get people awake and not just watching television
[3:04:50.280 --> 3:04:54.640]  or playing video games or watching sports all day because the world is
[3:04:54.640 --> 3:04:59.520]  rapidly changing and I want to remain free I want you to be free that's our
[3:04:59.520 --> 3:05:17.480]  bottom line mission
