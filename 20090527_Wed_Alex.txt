[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:37.120]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen several years ago as you know North
[00:37.120 --> 00:44.920]  Korea detonated a low-yield atomic bomb in an underground facility an
[00:44.920 --> 00:50.920]  underground test they did that again Monday as we mentioned yesterday and
[00:50.920 --> 00:59.640]  they're doing this because the Stalinist regime is collapsing it is run by the
[00:59.640 --> 01:03.880]  hereditary dictator as all crime syndicates are generally in history
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.400]  just like the Queen of England runs the Commonwealth countries and he is
[01:08.400 --> 01:11.600]  running that nation completely into the ground millions and millions have been
[01:11.600 --> 01:21.320]  starved to death and killed during the 50 plus year rain it's almost 60 year
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.720]  rain of these monsters he and his father he's preparing to pass it on to one of
[01:26.720 --> 01:34.560]  his little nair duel sons pass on the keys to the seven-story pleasure palace
[01:34.560 --> 01:40.520]  as it's called he literally has Asian film stars kidnapped he's had planes
[01:40.520 --> 01:45.040]  hijacked by his security services to bring him in North Korea because he
[01:45.040 --> 01:52.520]  must have a particular Japanese or South Korean film star I mean he is well
[01:52.520 --> 01:56.480]  you always see these James Bond type villains and you know villains from
[01:56.480 --> 02:03.560]  history books and fables fairy tales those are based on real personalities
[02:03.560 --> 02:10.400]  throughout history in fact the real McCoy the bona fide is always worse than
[02:10.400 --> 02:22.080]  what we can even fantasize about so it's just amazing the real thing is worse
[02:22.080 --> 02:30.440]  than what any author can conjure up in their minds I mean who can conjure up
[02:30.440 --> 02:35.840]  Hitler having some of the assassins people involved in the plot to try to
[02:35.840 --> 02:40.960]  kill him at the wolf's lair hung with piano wire and then he would watch it
[02:40.960 --> 02:45.640]  and have them follow him around with a film projector in the film he would
[02:45.640 --> 02:53.240]  watch it every day for nine months leading up to him committing suicide in
[02:53.240 --> 02:59.960]  his Berlin bunker I mean watching people being executed every day getting off on
[02:59.960 --> 03:11.200]  it I digress kind of like tunnel vision getting hypnotized by the target I'm
[03:11.200 --> 03:17.160]  covering that happens to a lot of gunners in World War two flying in with
[03:17.160 --> 03:20.440]  their aircraft with their cannons and machine guns firing on a train or a
[03:20.440 --> 03:31.920]  ship they would they would kind of get target Narcosis and fly right into it but
[03:31.920 --> 03:40.080]  I mean just this diminutive goblin like potbelly weak effeminate demon Kim
[03:40.080 --> 03:44.760]  Jung Il and so you set the New World Order up against him it makes the New
[03:44.760 --> 03:48.840]  World Order look good but see they're far worse because they're more refined
[03:48.840 --> 03:52.960]  and slick in the way they bring in their dehumanization and control and they move
[03:52.960 --> 03:57.480]  slowly and they target the strong worldwide they want to bring society
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.840]  down so they can more easily manage it and call the population they are light
[04:01.840 --> 04:09.720]  years more wicked than the uncontrolled psychopath Kim Jung Il of North Korea but
[04:09.720 --> 04:19.000]  I digress you know I was so busy covering other issues and big
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.160]  international films covering my work yesterday I didn't spend enough time on
[04:23.160 --> 04:29.120]  this and that shows that we all get focused on things that aren't as
[04:29.120 --> 04:34.320]  important as the big geopolitical movements that are taking place North
[04:34.320 --> 04:40.280]  Korea threatens arm strike into Armitus they basically ended that that's the

[08:55.240 --> 09:00.680]  could go nuclear interface Reuters North Korea threatens arm strike ends the
[09:00.680 --> 09:09.600]  armistice Bloomberg this is out of South Korean news the young hop news agency
[09:09.600 --> 09:14.120]  North Korea launches additional missiles into East Sea official Japan is
[09:14.120 --> 09:18.040]  threatening to attack them because North Korea shot missiles right over the
[09:18.040 --> 09:26.320]  nation and had intermediate range missiles land just miles off their coast
[09:26.320 --> 09:30.400]  in years past by the way Alaska was hit like I forgot to print this the this
[09:30.400 --> 09:35.080]  morning when you guys search engine North Korean missile hits Alaska just
[09:35.080 --> 09:39.600]  just I want to pull up the exact year I think it was 2000 was a 2001 I want to
[09:39.600 --> 09:45.760]  that was actually in Reuters but never got any other news it was a dummy ICBM
[09:45.760 --> 09:49.320]  intercontinental ballistic missile didn't have a Merve package it had a
[09:49.320 --> 09:57.520]  single warhead casing without the warhead was a test a drill broke up in
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.440]  the atmosphere on reentry and rained down on the frozen tundra of Alaska I
[10:02.440 --> 10:11.560]  ran sins warships to gulf of Aden saying openly this they're preparing of
[10:11.560 --> 10:16.000]  attack to engage the Israeli and u.s. NATO forces I mean ladies and gentlemen
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.640]  this is the exact type of jockeying you see right before a major war starts and
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.880]  what are the ram corporations say five months ago and Paul Watson wrote about
[10:25.880 --> 10:29.720]  this it's in his new article at prisonplanet.com titled state of war
[10:29.720 --> 10:35.680]  between two Koreas after armistice ended they said we need something bigger than
[10:35.680 --> 10:41.280]  the Iran situation bigger than Iraq bigger than Afghanistan to bring in the
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.400]  new world order and what ran generally calls for ends up being at least looked
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.760]  at or being carried out many cases big you know top think tank to the CFR to
[10:50.760 --> 10:53.960]  the Trattle I don't commission to the Bilderberg group the different interlocking
[10:53.960 --> 11:05.200]  directorates and steering committees and they said a conflict in Asia would be
[11:05.200 --> 11:12.600]  desirable between China Korea South Korea and ladies and gentlemen the
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.400]  globalist mean business they need a war as a political distraction to say look
[11:17.400 --> 11:22.800]  Americans look English look Europeans look South Koreans look Chinese look
[11:22.800 --> 11:27.560]  Japanese everybody and internees descending everywhere Japan Canada
[11:27.560 --> 11:31.800]  Australia New Zealand the United States everywhere it's descending all
[11:31.800 --> 11:38.600]  governments use the threat of terror as a pretext of control and it's in the
[11:38.600 --> 11:43.440]  cards I keep telling you for months staged flu outbreaks what did I say in
[11:43.440 --> 11:49.640]  that March 5th show I came on air and I said this is the third time I have gone
[11:49.640 --> 11:54.760]  on air and warned people in my time on air over the years and specifically said
[11:54.760 --> 12:01.760]  this is a highest level alert from my perspective and my research I did it once
[12:01.760 --> 12:06.560]  two months before 9-11 and months before that I led up to that point of
[12:06.560 --> 12:09.360]  giving out the White House phone number and telling them do not attack the
[12:09.360 --> 12:12.560]  World Trade Center's and blame it on your CIA I said to someone bin Laden and
[12:12.560 --> 12:19.080]  then move into Iraq Afghanistan to encircle Iran I did it in the run-up to
[12:19.080 --> 12:22.960]  the 2006 elections I said I believe they're about to launch an attack Cheney
[12:22.960 --> 12:26.360]  was saying we're about to be hit we will be hit we're gonna have martial law when
[12:26.360 --> 12:30.080]  it happens I could see all the preparatory phase going on in the media in
[12:30.080 --> 12:33.760]  the build-up to them staging something as they get the public ready to hand over
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.320]  their rights kind of like Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drills and that's just
[12:38.320 --> 12:43.960]  one way I gauge you but that's you know one of the main things I factor in and
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.640]  then I put out the alert March 5th and I said here are the cards in the new
[12:49.640 --> 12:52.560]  World Order's fist
[12:54.080 --> 12:59.680]  flu scare as a smoke screen for setting up the martial law control grid and I
[12:59.680 --> 13:04.320]  said it may be hot it may be cold it may be real or it may just be hyped to
[13:04.320 --> 13:08.720]  drill and prepare everybody for a future release and if they go with that
[13:08.720 --> 13:12.480]  they'll then hype that in the next six months they think the big one's coming
[13:12.480 --> 13:17.400]  exactly that happened I'm on record that's what happens when all you do is
[13:17.400 --> 13:22.040]  research this from a historical perspective and I only say that's people
[13:22.040 --> 13:31.280]  pay attention to me this isn't a game now
[13:34.680 --> 13:42.000]  that said I said in their fist is the flu card if they play the flu card that
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.160]  means they're preparing to play the total economic collapse card you think
[13:46.160 --> 13:52.480]  things are bad I mean you an accelerated collapse with massive bankruptcy
[13:52.480 --> 13:56.240]  shutdowns the media destroying confidence by design while then adding a
[13:56.240 --> 14:00.560]  icing of acting like they're trying to fix confidence so they put out a double
[14:00.560 --> 14:05.600]  message 80% bad news 20% good news that's the psychological algorithm that
[14:05.600 --> 14:17.000]  I've picked up on the enemy transmission so we've got that going on now it's
[14:17.000 --> 14:30.040]  important to understand that they play the flu card as a test balloon and I'm
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.600]  on record saying that's probably what they do then if they played that and it
[14:34.600 --> 14:38.720]  wasn't successful they would probably back off or go with another plan but it
[14:38.720 --> 14:44.760]  overall was somewhat successful almost a draw but leaning I'd say 51% in their
[14:44.760 --> 14:50.440]  favor the hysteria worked it didn't work long but still that's a good smoke
[14:50.440 --> 14:55.440]  screener cover for a martial law hot takeover not the cold incremental take
[14:55.440 --> 14:58.040]  over we're seeing is starting to get a little bit warmer and starting to bubble
[14:58.040 --> 15:05.080]  at the bottom of the pan here towards a full boil if it continues to accelerate
[15:05.080 --> 15:10.400]  so you've got that first car to flu then I said that will then accelerate the
[15:10.400 --> 15:18.120]  economic implosion by design and then I said expect C in conjunction this is our
[15:18.120 --> 15:21.480]  World War start it's how the globalist operate they stage the last two on
[15:21.480 --> 15:26.920]  record British Empire blueprints what's being used but it's a hybrid of the
[15:26.920 --> 15:32.200]  European Union British Empire in the United States and Israel that if they
[15:32.200 --> 15:37.680]  go with that blueprint it will then be simultaneous theater wars popping up in
[15:37.680 --> 15:47.080]  different regions of the planet you have massive escalation of crises in the
[15:47.080 --> 15:52.000]  Middle East you notice the suicide bombings and attacks
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.480]  are escalating again in Iraq they're coming to a head in Afghanistan they're
[15:55.480 --> 16:02.200]  everything's coming to a head in Pakistan North Korea now has broken the
[16:02.200 --> 16:07.040]  armistice saying the West is breaking it there has been massive military build-up
[16:07.040 --> 16:10.320]  and drills going on around them that's how the globalists give you a
[16:10.320 --> 16:14.960]  Hobbeson's choice you're not for North Korea complete evil total psychopath I
[16:14.960 --> 16:21.720]  mean this is not hyped this is the real McCoy this is the king rat the crimson
[16:21.720 --> 16:29.640]  king of his little dark ages slave pit exercising raw power a 1984 state versus
[16:29.640 --> 16:43.080]  the Panopticon brave new world white lab coated art form of the mind control
[16:43.080 --> 16:48.480]  state with the overlay of entertainment and sex and partying and drugs with the
[16:48.480 --> 16:52.400]  police state running through it and genetic engineers and human genomes see
[16:52.400 --> 16:56.680]  it's the overarching winning model as right before he died Aldous Huxley
[16:56.680 --> 17:01.040]  reported you know when he went public said look this book is really what the
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.720]  eugenicist are planning this is this is really nonfiction this is what they're
[17:04.720 --> 17:08.040]  planning by the year 2000 as you see there are a few years behind but moving
[17:08.040 --> 17:13.860]  ahead he said this is the dominant structure the elite created the 1984
[17:13.860 --> 17:18.000]  structure the more ancient form of tyranny in parallel with the brave new
[17:18.000 --> 17:27.200]  world technocracy pharmacological system and that they are fusing the two into
[17:27.200 --> 17:33.040]  an amalgamation but the dominant overriding flavor is the brave new
[17:33.040 --> 17:39.200]  world that is the great hovering destructor it is the final revolution it
[17:39.200 --> 17:43.480]  is the final tyranny because unlike a North Korea that finally collapses
[17:43.480 --> 17:50.720]  because of the delusional arrogant power-tripping megalomaniacs things
[17:50.720 --> 17:56.360]  always collapse but not a scientific dictatorship they believe it will just
[17:56.360 --> 18:00.880]  continue to refine itself so what's the greater threat the scientific
[18:00.880 --> 18:06.000]  dictatorship or the thugs and the inner parties all intermarried with some
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.920]  little demonic goblin running at all I mean it's certainly bad for the people
[18:10.920 --> 18:17.400]  of his nation but one day it will collapse and probably never recover for
[18:17.400 --> 18:22.080]  centuries because the culture is so destroyed and so authoritarian and so
[18:22.080 --> 18:28.080]  controlled but it can't invade its neighbors now it can only threaten
[18:28.080 --> 18:34.760]  people it is a husk of what it was so so there you see the two different
[18:34.760 --> 18:40.200]  systems versus liberty and freedom and renaissance and awakening and and the
[18:40.200 --> 18:44.640]  acceleration of knowledge and and a love of the human spirit and a love of the
[18:44.640 --> 18:51.520]  human mind and a dynamic construction of the next wave of humanity into the
[18:51.520 --> 18:58.520]  stars that both systems the brave new world in the 1984 are deathly afraid of
[18:58.520 --> 19:15.640]  the 1776 signature wavelength frequency also known as soul it is the two

[24:41.440 --> 24:47.920]  a few high-powered missiles into the ocean right off the coast of Japan the
[24:47.920 --> 24:55.600]  last 48 hours is only Kim Jong-il trying to get concessions because he looks like
[24:55.600 --> 24:58.520]  he's on death's doorstep he was gone out of the site for over a year and then
[24:58.520 --> 25:02.320]  when they trotted him out to sit at a table he looks like he has cancer or
[25:02.320 --> 25:06.840]  something I've seen that cancer look very very skinny now no more raping women
[25:06.840 --> 25:11.400]  I guess in his spare time and drinking bottles of $2,000 wine while the
[25:11.400 --> 25:16.040]  population literally starves to death and Vanity Fair had reporters there a few
[25:16.040 --> 25:20.400]  years ago when Madeleine Albright was Secretary of State under Clinton and they
[25:20.400 --> 25:25.680]  described how they in them in the main city center they were selling human flesh
[25:25.680 --> 25:31.760]  at little stands and how Madeleine Albright loved the tyranny and was
[25:31.760 --> 25:37.680]  clapping and just really enjoying everything that was happening when they
[25:37.680 --> 25:43.880]  had all the you know those big parades with all the human gymnastics that Nazi
[25:43.880 --> 25:48.200]  regimes and Soviet-style regimes love so much you're seeing all the little
[25:48.200 --> 25:54.320]  slaves work do little worker B dances all in unison under the control of the
[25:54.320 --> 25:58.800]  soldiers with machine guns so that's why when we see soldiers with machine guns
[25:58.800 --> 26:02.600]  in the United States and billboards up about how the government's watching you
[26:02.600 --> 26:06.800]  for your safety and tattletale squads with our children it's why we get so
[26:06.800 --> 26:14.200]  upset because every time that happens every stinking time the criminal class
[26:14.200 --> 26:19.360]  starts taking the middle classes land and property and time and the people
[26:19.360 --> 26:24.000]  become slaves and everybody becomes slaves but a tiny elite and it's happened
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.280]  here there's just still a history of liberty and freedom and so we're still
[26:28.280 --> 26:31.840]  just ignoring the globalist threats and all their dirty tricks and all the
[26:31.840 --> 26:34.520]  things they're doing and all the bills they've got introduced to take over the
[26:34.520 --> 26:40.760]  web and in free speech it's all happening we are becoming North Korea and I
[26:40.760 --> 26:44.240]  get these emails going you need to support the military and the police you
[26:44.240 --> 26:47.360]  don't need to criticize them yeah I guess if I lived in North Korea too with
[26:47.360 --> 26:51.280]  all their billboards up about support the military and police the religion is
[26:51.280 --> 26:55.800]  worshiping them over here and it's the religion worshiping them over there
[26:55.800 --> 27:01.640]  that's not the American way their servants in the community held to a
[27:01.640 --> 27:06.880]  higher standard not held to a lower standard of how they behave and any time
[27:06.880 --> 27:13.440]  government becomes God you have tyranny and misery and enslavement and that is
[27:13.440 --> 27:18.960]  now what is happening all over the free world classical tyranny is here you know
[27:18.960 --> 27:22.920]  I guess I'm anti-government I guess I'm extremist because I don't like him
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.800]  Jung Il in North Korea I guess I'm anti-police and military because I
[27:27.800 --> 27:31.200]  don't like the North Korean military and police that have killed millions and
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.560]  millions of their own people and are degenerate parasites stomping on the
[27:35.560 --> 27:41.480]  human face and spirit forever now do you see how ridiculous it looks when
[27:41.480 --> 27:45.760]  people get criticized for criticizing the out-of-control police in this country
[27:45.760 --> 27:49.840]  who've been encouraged by the criminal illegitimate central government to
[27:49.840 --> 27:54.160]  become thugs and all the police training videos I've seen shot by them
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.800]  where they brag and have celebrations and watch news videos of them shooting
[27:58.800 --> 28:02.720]  innocent women in the facial rubber bullets for no reason and they sit
[28:02.720 --> 28:07.640]  around laughing it's not funny the North Koreans sit around and laugh about what
[28:07.640 --> 28:14.560]  they do to their people you have been infected with a spirit of thuggery you
[28:14.560 --> 28:18.800]  have had your soul torn out of you and you better hope you catch it before it
[28:18.800 --> 28:25.560]  walks out the door I'm your best friend if you don't recognize tyranny for what
[28:25.560 --> 28:30.280]  it is and what the surveillance cameras and the thumb scanners to buy and sell
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.800]  going in everywhere are and if you don't recognize what the vaccine companies are
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.600]  what CPS is you because look the threat isn't North Korea some scumbag with a
[28:40.600 --> 28:45.920]  few nukes the threat is how they'll use his scumbaggery to make them look good
[28:45.920 --> 28:52.000]  to launch their police state against us and I'm hoping that this that they
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.840]  somehow just buy this guy off for a while but they've been refusing to give
[28:55.840 --> 28:59.160]  him food refusing to give him oil so he can then sell it to another country and
[28:59.160 --> 29:04.400]  buy more liquor for himself and more diamonds and rubies and gold crowns and
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.080]  toy sets and the kids a little he's like a little kid this is a dictators
[29:08.080 --> 29:13.280]  spoiled brat kid about to pass it on to his kid and in the old days this would
[29:13.280 --> 29:17.120]  go on for hundreds of years and they would would wear crowns and would be
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.840]  worshiped and then we go oh don't talk bad about the king oh my gosh we get to
[29:21.840 --> 29:25.840]  hang out with royalty that's why I hate Queen Elizabeth the second that's all

[34:31.920 --> 34:36.400]  guys that made that uh new order film that premiered last night
[34:36.400 --> 34:41.040]  it's getting a absolutely huge uh response
[34:41.040 --> 34:49.600]  most downloaded film ever from i fc's on demand huge ratings for i fc
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.280]  and you know i have mixed feelings about the film but i really can't sit or
[34:53.280 --> 34:56.800]  talking about that film while world war three could be
[34:56.800 --> 34:59.920]  unfolding but but i'll just say this now and then maybe we'll get andrew on at
[34:59.920 --> 35:02.320]  the end of the show if he's able to do it
[35:02.320 --> 35:07.840]  um i understand that andrew and the guys at see-think could have made us look
[35:07.840 --> 35:12.000]  a lot worse in this film and i understand the media
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.960]  and how it works
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.920]  and i don't put on an affected uh stance of being a genius or having all the
[35:19.920 --> 35:24.720]  answers or being you know slick i just roll my sleeves up and
[35:24.720 --> 35:27.760]  take on the new world order toe to toe and my job is to wake people up and get
[35:27.760 --> 35:30.640]  them to think for themselves not to necessarily think what i think
[35:30.640 --> 35:34.560]  but just to wake up there's a wider world out there and there are elites
[35:34.560 --> 35:38.800]  that don't have your best interest in heart and history shows that it's a fact
[35:38.800 --> 35:41.760]  but before i finish up in north korea and then take your calls i just want to
[35:41.760 --> 35:44.240]  say this
[35:45.040 --> 35:48.560]  you know i said i thought it was the most fair film made to date by mainstream
[35:48.560 --> 35:54.000]  media there have been quite a few made about myself and others like us
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.760]  and there are a few kooky weird people in there you know one guy thinks he has a
[35:57.760 --> 36:00.800]  microchip in his brain
[36:00.800 --> 36:06.000]  and uh you know for the unwashed masses out there
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.960]  that have never taken on the new world order and never been followed by secret
[36:08.960 --> 36:12.960]  service and never been arrested they could watch it and think oh my god this
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.480]  guy's at a hotel thinking people are following him he's crazy but only a
[36:16.480 --> 36:19.600]  delusional person would think that because bill de berger it's on record
[36:19.600 --> 36:23.440]  but you forget how ignorant the public is
[36:24.560 --> 36:28.000]  and i was talking to andrew this morning and he said look i never even made this
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.400]  point to you but um there were people we didn't put in this
[36:32.400 --> 36:35.440]  film who savagely attacked you and many other people in the
[36:35.440 --> 36:38.800]  patriot movement and that's our reason for not
[36:38.800 --> 36:44.480]  and he had discussed for people in the united states in the patriot movement
[36:44.480 --> 36:49.120]  and it was just very painful to see and there were also people we didn't put in
[36:49.120 --> 36:52.640]  the film who literally were knocking our door down saying you would put
[36:52.640 --> 36:56.960]  microchips in their brains and things if we wanted to make you guys look like
[36:56.960 --> 37:00.400]  cooks it would have been easy and you know what i know that's true because
[37:00.400 --> 37:03.440]  we're not the sequestered mainstream controlled
[37:03.440 --> 37:09.040]  corporate media where you've got four big networks and everything is controlled
[37:09.040 --> 37:12.480]  tightly and the cia and defense department admittedly have officers
[37:12.480 --> 37:16.160]  inside of each installation controlling the information that's on record
[37:16.160 --> 37:20.160]  congress admits it and tens of billions spent a year for fake news
[37:20.160 --> 37:24.640]  and buying reporters slick teleprompters slick backgrounds
[37:24.640 --> 37:28.880]  people in suits arrogant people up there projecting an air
[37:28.880 --> 37:35.840]  of infallibility and of gravity and of authoritativeness
[37:37.120 --> 37:40.000]  that's what goes on
[37:43.760 --> 37:50.640]  and he said you know i fc supported him didn't tell him what to make or what to
[37:50.640 --> 37:55.600]  do and i've had some experience with i fc and have found that that is the case
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.120]  or one of the few independent outfits out there and he said you know he went on
[37:59.120 --> 38:01.600]  to say if we want to do a hit piece pal it would have been easy
[38:01.600 --> 38:06.480]  he started listening to me the stuff they have on tape
[38:06.480 --> 38:08.720]  and i'm not going to say a lot more because you know most of it's off the
[38:08.720 --> 38:12.720]  record but it's it's could be very destructive to certain arrogant
[38:12.720 --> 38:17.600]  individuals out there i'll just leave it at that
[38:17.600 --> 38:21.040]  and i'm just glad i'm taking the high road and all this because people get crazy
[38:21.040 --> 38:24.240]  when films are made about them now this is theatrical release across the
[38:24.240 --> 38:27.920]  country the next few months it's in theaters in new york and la in places
[38:27.920 --> 38:30.160]  right now but see i've been in movies before i've
[38:30.160 --> 38:32.320]  been in waking life that was in theaters you know
[38:32.320 --> 38:36.400]  500-something theaters across the country scanner darkly well opened in 2000
[38:36.400 --> 38:39.120]  theaters i mean i'm in a movie with keanu
[38:39.120 --> 38:45.920]  reason on a writer in scenes with them woody harrelson others
[38:45.920 --> 38:50.400]  and i realize it's not a big deal now i thought it was a big deal till i was in
[38:50.400 --> 38:53.680]  those movies they just fell in my lap because atami pilota and rick link
[38:53.680 --> 38:56.560]  letter and i think i did a pretty good job in both those films
[38:56.560 --> 38:59.120]  people say that's some of their favorite scenes in both it's written up by the
[38:59.120 --> 39:02.800]  critics saying that but it doesn't matter you know
[39:02.800 --> 39:06.320]  what i'm worried about i'm worried about my children and war breaking out
[39:06.320 --> 39:09.760]  and russia and china being sucked into a theater conflict
[39:09.760 --> 39:15.680]  in asia and and nukes in pakistan and israel saying they may hit iran
[39:15.680 --> 39:19.280]  any day now you know that's what i'm thinking about and i'm almost
[39:19.280 --> 39:25.440]  ashamed that i'm on air talking about a movie i mean
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.000]  that's in mook movie theaters and on national television
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.960]  i mean that's really shameful that i even care
[39:34.960 --> 39:38.560]  but millions of people out there watching it now and and and they care so
[39:38.560 --> 39:42.240]  they're asking me about it and so that's why i said look it's overall it's a
[39:42.240 --> 39:46.240]  positive film overall it's the fairest thing i've seen
[39:46.240 --> 39:50.800]  because i know that we're not some centralized media we're the american
[39:50.800 --> 39:54.320]  people the alternative media is a billion flavors
[39:54.320 --> 39:58.000]  across the planet it's anybody with a blog anybody with an email
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.160]  anybody with a website and there is every flavor as there is every
[40:02.160 --> 40:06.320]  color and type and size of fish in the sea
[40:06.880 --> 40:09.920]  and so of course the media anytime they want
[40:09.920 --> 40:14.000]  can descend down into the ranks of the
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.280]  questioning public and all the different questions we ask
[40:17.280 --> 40:20.960]  and they can find crazy looking black people crazy looking white people crazy
[40:20.960 --> 40:24.560]  looking hispanics they can find people that think aliens run the planet
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.040]  they can find people that are just rabidly hating jews and it's a religion
[40:29.040 --> 40:31.680]  or hating catholics they can find whatever they want
[40:31.680 --> 40:35.440]  and i'm telling you i know what the alternative media is and what the
[40:35.440 --> 40:39.840]  american people are our whole society is fallen we're trying to pull out of it
[40:39.840 --> 40:43.520]  and i'll tell you overall it's a positive film
[40:43.520 --> 40:46.640]  and i go back and forth as i get hit by the new york times
[40:46.640 --> 40:52.320]  and variety and the la times and
[40:52.320 --> 40:59.600]  all these other major articles bloomberg that are savage hit pieces
[40:59.600 --> 41:03.520]  and i start getting upset about it because i read bloomberg implying the
[41:03.520 --> 41:06.640]  film says i'm basically a schizophrenic who's at a
[41:06.640 --> 41:12.080]  hotel imagining fire alarms and imagining i'm being followed
[41:12.720 --> 41:17.440]  and that's insulting to my intelligence that is such a fraud such a lie that some
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.440]  of my anger then bleeds over
[41:21.520 --> 41:26.080]  into the filmmakers themselves so you mean it's a it's a very thought
[41:26.080 --> 41:28.560]  provoking film it's a very important film
[41:28.560 --> 41:32.960]  because it makes us question ourselves and and the establishment
[41:32.960 --> 41:37.120]  and i think these guys are really great filmmakers because it
[41:37.120 --> 41:40.160]  i think about the film and folks i've done a lot of other films and i don't
[41:40.160 --> 41:42.960]  even think about them i don't even care there have been huge history channel
[41:42.960 --> 41:47.760]  hit pieces you name it hit pieces in japan hit pieces in germany hit pieces
[41:47.760 --> 41:51.840]  in in england probably 15 or so in england and i don't even care about
[41:51.840 --> 41:54.160]  those films i'll tell you the truth i've watched
[41:54.160 --> 42:00.160]  john ronson's film about me once and it was a five-part series
[42:00.160 --> 42:04.000]  and i didn't even watch the other parts i'm in
[42:04.000 --> 42:07.600]  i mean i i i watched the the one part that was
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.320]  only about me and then i was in the other parts and didn't even
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.960]  watch them didn't even care i said i've seen this one
[42:16.960 --> 42:27.040]  i don't need to i don't even watch myself on television
[42:27.040 --> 42:30.880]  and so that's important to understand
[42:30.880 --> 42:35.760]  that i do think about this film i do because it challenges
[42:35.760 --> 42:39.120]  and and and i think these guys have done a pretty good job and you know
[42:39.120 --> 42:42.400]  people can say well first you liked it and you're saying
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.920]  it's somewhat of a hit piece we are our own hit piece
[42:47.920 --> 42:54.080]  and it's easy for people up on their high horse out there to criticize those
[42:54.080 --> 42:58.160]  of us in the arena taking action those of us
[42:58.160 --> 43:03.120]  that are out there you know engaging the new world order but overall this is
[43:03.120 --> 43:05.360]  positive and that's why the new york times
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.360]  that's why all these other publications
[43:09.360 --> 43:13.600]  bloomberg and others have attacked the film saying it's a horrible film and
[43:13.600 --> 43:17.120]  we're a bunch of cooks is because they're scared of it
[43:17.120 --> 43:22.240]  and they realize that the people are waking up and the people are finding
[43:22.240 --> 43:24.800]  out what's going on the people are learning to differentiate
[43:24.800 --> 43:28.160]  between the cooks and the serious people that are out there
[43:28.160 --> 43:37.840]  asking serious questions so i'm done talking about that
[43:37.840 --> 43:42.880]  it's just all part of this process this evolution of people awakening
[43:42.880 --> 43:46.480]  okay that said ladies and gentlemen as i covered in the first 30 minutes we're
[43:46.480 --> 43:49.680]  going to your calls in a moment
[43:49.680 --> 43:53.760]  this is big news and we can analyze all the geopolitical
[43:53.760 --> 43:56.880]  connections but when you add the stance of the new world order
[43:56.880 --> 44:00.240]  the propaganda campaigns the new world order is involved in the things they've
[44:00.240 --> 44:03.360]  been staging those cards they have the staged
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.360]  flu the staged economic implosion their fear
[44:07.360 --> 44:12.720]  mongering about al-qaeda nukes going off pakistan afghanistan
[44:12.720 --> 44:17.120]  literally imploding into civil war with the west funding the Taliban al-qaeda
[44:17.120 --> 44:20.400]  to carry out attacks to destabilize pakistan and afghanistan
[44:20.400 --> 44:24.560]  on record i mean that's even what the pakistani president's saying
[44:24.560 --> 44:28.000]  you try to tell the public hey al-qaeda works for the u.s they just can't
[44:28.000 --> 44:34.400]  compute it but it's true it's it's so amazing
[44:34.400 --> 44:39.520]  that the west has
[44:39.520 --> 44:46.400]  operatives inside iran staging terror attacks against their government
[44:46.400 --> 44:51.600]  to destabilize it
[44:51.600 --> 44:56.000]  that iran has been taking it and has been laying down and doing nothing
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.040]  provocative and not even really sending ships into their own waters that are
[44:59.040 --> 45:02.240]  just a few miles off their coast but now they've launched
[45:02.240 --> 45:07.680]  missile cruisers deep into the gulf in a menacing fashion and then their
[45:07.680 --> 45:10.640]  admiral comes out and says we're ready to engage you
[45:10.640 --> 45:14.960]  and and this on the heels of israel coming out and blowing the war trumpets
[45:14.960 --> 45:18.160]  and saying we're getting ready to hit iran and hit them hard we're getting
[45:18.160 --> 45:22.080]  ready for tank wars we're getting ready
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.800]  for tank wars what on earth are they talking about
[45:26.800 --> 45:30.720]  so all over the world we see the makings of a world war one or a world war
[45:30.720 --> 45:33.840]  two we see the battle lines being drawn we see everything
[45:33.840 --> 45:39.840]  escalating into the stratosphere we see the new world order when i call chaos
[45:39.840 --> 45:43.840]  right out of the uh...
[45:43.840 --> 45:47.600]  get smart you call it specter if you want but that's the establishment
[45:47.600 --> 45:50.640]  throwing in our face these private corporate groups above
[45:50.640 --> 45:53.600]  government that control the western intelligence agencies
[45:53.600 --> 45:57.280]  and they play the nations off against each other to bring in
[45:57.280 --> 46:03.200]  bankruptcy and war and death and control with themselves at the top
[46:03.200 --> 46:07.120]  i mean you understand that a state of war between the two koreans
[46:07.120 --> 46:10.720]  is now in effect after armistice ended
[46:10.720 --> 46:18.480]  after fifty six plus years
[46:18.480 --> 46:22.560]  do you understand that north korea ends armistice threatens to attack north
[46:22.560 --> 46:26.640]  korea and start shooting off missiles into the
[46:26.640 --> 46:34.160]  sea off of south korea and japan you understand japan said yesterday
[46:34.160 --> 46:40.240]  they're getting ready to hit
[46:40.240 --> 46:43.520]  preemptively and by the way they have a right
[46:43.520 --> 46:47.520]  north korea is continually firing missiles over their nation
[46:47.520 --> 46:52.160]  right off their coast north korea hit
[46:52.160 --> 46:55.760]  the united states in fact as you guys find that article about uh...
[46:55.760 --> 46:59.120]  north korea did the test missile thanks i forgot the year i wanted to give

[55:04.160 --> 55:07.360]  notice our first caller was from south korea holding
[55:07.360 --> 55:10.640]  let's take calls on this situation i hope callers aren't calling in about
[55:10.640 --> 55:16.720]  cuba cabras and stuff like that when you talk about serious issues here
[55:16.720 --> 55:20.880]  chris in south korea you're on the air welcome
[55:20.880 --> 55:24.880]  oh great thanks uh well i just wanted to give some people
[55:24.880 --> 55:28.240]  a little bit of background information quickly about south korea so you can
[55:28.240 --> 55:32.160]  get an idea of what this place is like and then just get into the nuclear thing
[55:32.160 --> 55:37.440]  if i could yeah go ahead okay so first of all
[55:37.440 --> 55:41.680]  south korea um is not really that benevolent in fact i'd say uh you said
[55:41.680 --> 55:44.880]  earlier that you think america's becoming like north korea
[55:44.880 --> 55:48.560]  more likely it's becoming like the south which i think is probably a very
[55:48.560 --> 55:53.600]  soft kind of tyranny or fascism here and for example like they force
[55:53.600 --> 55:56.720]  elementary school kids to brush their teeth with pure fluoride
[55:56.720 --> 56:00.400]  every day so these people are pretty much
[56:00.400 --> 56:04.800]  in control right oh yeah they believe i know they believe in eugenics and and
[56:04.800 --> 56:08.240]  highly sequestered groups and that it's not really the free
[56:08.240 --> 56:10.720]  society they talk about and they're constantly having
[56:10.720 --> 56:14.880]  quiet military coups i understand that and because that's the history of that
[56:14.880 --> 56:18.240]  nation when it was one country but i mean you obviously live over there so you
[56:18.240 --> 56:21.680]  can tell us about it my point is when you talk about the north though
[56:21.680 --> 56:26.080]  i mean this is the quintessential lunatic evil and having that evil
[56:26.080 --> 56:29.440]  has allowed great evil to spring up in the south because there's always the
[56:29.440 --> 56:33.760]  pretext of oh we face that great evil see evils need each other
[56:33.760 --> 56:39.200]  to play uh themselves off against the middle which is free humanity
[56:39.200 --> 56:42.560]  oh yeah absolutely um so let me just
[56:42.560 --> 56:45.840]  like there's a lot that's been happening in the south right now and i just
[56:45.840 --> 56:48.640]  want to tell everyone there have been big military buildups i know the north
[56:48.640 --> 56:51.760]  but was legitimately worried they were about to get hit
[56:51.760 --> 56:56.560]  but what happened recently is that there was a popular ex-president
[56:56.560 --> 56:59.360]  and he's been under pressure for a couple of months they were investigating
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.120]  him for corruption and then he for some reason magically
[57:03.120 --> 57:06.720]  committed suicide and by jumping off a mountain
[57:06.720 --> 57:10.320]  and it was pretty obvious that he was murdered like both of his arms are
[57:10.320 --> 57:12.800]  broken and he had massive head trauma but
[57:12.800 --> 57:16.160]  everything else they didn't even find any blood at the scene and
[57:16.160 --> 57:19.680]  it's just it's a mess it's an absolute mess
[57:19.680 --> 57:23.920]  and the entire media is being controlled by the government here it's it's open
[57:23.920 --> 57:27.200]  it's controlled by the government so there's been all this speculation that
[57:27.200 --> 57:29.760]  he was murdered and it's created this incredible
[57:29.760 --> 57:33.120]  kind of left-right division in South Korea and then the government came out and
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.240]  said well he might have been murdered and
[57:36.240 --> 57:39.440]  blah blah blah so i i don't know why the government media would
[57:39.440 --> 57:42.960]  say that but anyway everybody's just whipped up
[57:42.960 --> 57:46.480]  over this guy's apparent suicide nobody even knows
[57:46.480 --> 57:51.600]  that the north korea broke the the armistice and secondly
[57:51.600 --> 57:58.240]  uh tomorrow or today actually today tomorrow and friday the 29th

[1:01:57.360 --> 1:02:00.480]  collapse going along with this historically
[1:02:00.480 --> 1:02:07.600]  this is this has the makings of a typhoon in
[1:02:07.600 --> 1:02:12.400]  the parallel of storms this is already a bad tropical depression
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:16.000]  with 100 mile an hour winds this sucker looks like it's going to get cooking
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:22.640]  up to 200 300 miles an hour i hope that's not the case
[1:02:22.640 --> 1:02:26.240]  okay but you got to look out the window and see the tornadoes coming at you
[1:02:26.240 --> 1:02:30.240]  this hidden pretty this hidden pretty
[1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:34.720]  i mean the state of war now exists between north and south korea
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:37.680]  and uh we're talking to chris in south korea
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:41.280]  what are you in the military a school teacher what are you doing over there
[1:02:41.280 --> 1:02:45.360]  uh school teacher actually yeah i'm kind of hanging in here because
[1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:50.400]  i fell in love with a korean girl so hey hey great stuff so uh
[1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:54.960]  so we teach english over there yep okay so
[1:02:54.960 --> 1:02:59.680]  tell me uh you're saying it's not even big news there that
[1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:07.120]  the war is back on at least uh on paper no well people are really swept up with
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:11.120]  the suicide or more or murder of their former ex-president who's like
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:14.480]  equivalent to the jimmy carter of south korea
[1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:20.400]  so this happened on saturday actually his name i saw that so
[1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:25.680]  yeah roh well i bet north korea as evil as they are
[1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:28.800]  they know that the south politically may use a new war
[1:03:28.800 --> 1:03:32.160]  as a political diversion look if politicians are all about to go to jail
[1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:34.960]  and for those that don't know south korea as politicians going to prison all
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:37.600]  the time including presidents because it's so corrupt
[1:03:37.600 --> 1:03:41.040]  and that's how they fight with each other they will start wars just to save
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:45.920]  themselves politically won't they oh yeah and uh you know chances are they
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:50.240]  killed this guy too because it ended all the corruption investigations for him
[1:03:50.240 --> 1:03:55.120]  so that's what everybody's focused on but another big thing about this too is
[1:03:55.120 --> 1:03:59.600]  like i said there's going to be thousands of people in soul on friday
[1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:02.960]  and that's the last day of the nuclear disaster drill with the army
[1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:08.560]  and uh i was also reading that apparently obama sending some special
[1:04:08.560 --> 1:04:12.880]  envoy over to this guy's funeral now like the guy was impeached
[1:04:12.880 --> 1:04:18.080]  so why he would send somebody over for this guy's funeral i have no idea like
[1:04:18.080 --> 1:04:22.240]  it i just wanted to say like if something happens here
[1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:25.680]  it's not going to be the north i'm positive it's going to be the south it's
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:29.040]  going to be the u.s it's going to be like 9 11 if something
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:32.240]  happens here because it's all and you think the north is he was evil
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:34.880]  knows evil and this is certainly a possibility
[1:04:34.880 --> 1:04:38.240]  you think the north figures that's happening so they're going ahead and
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:42.720]  saber rattling uh kind of like a dog cornered growling saying
[1:04:42.720 --> 1:04:46.320]  back off yeah because the south is actually
[1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:49.760]  being pretty aggressive towards them like the north
[1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.960]  a couple of months ago yeah i mean i'm aware of this but i want
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:56.960]  folks to hear from somebody in south korea and we're not saying that goblin

[1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:24.240]  live from austin texas alex jones i know we have a lot of great callers holding
[1:08:24.240 --> 1:08:27.440]  here i'm gonna get to you but we got a caller from south korea
[1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:30.800]  you have a lot of calls from there a lot of military and university people over
[1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:33.920]  there that's why i guess christ was a teacher
[1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:37.120]  every time i get a call from south korea i say uh what are you i'm a school
[1:08:37.120 --> 1:08:41.520]  teacher teaching english or i'm in the military or i'm a contractor
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:44.320]  and i've had family that's been over there off and on and uh you know they
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:49.360]  say the south is really nice folks really hard-working people but it it is an
[1:08:49.360 --> 1:08:53.840]  ancient culture it is a police state with kind of a velvet glove over the
[1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:57.920]  iron fist and uh the south has used the north as a
[1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:00.960]  pretext to engage in a lot of corruption
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:05.760]  and the north is just off the chart evil i mean it there is no doubt it is
[1:09:05.760 --> 1:09:09.280]  like something out of a dystopic science fiction movie you know of like an evil
[1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:13.840]  planet run by uh i mean the vicious dwarf son
[1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:19.600]  of the previous dictator who's now creating a hereditary dynasty
[1:09:19.600 --> 1:09:22.640]  that's why i hate kings and queens that's what it is
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:28.720]  it's disgusting it's so sick when you see royals all over tv being worshiped
[1:09:28.720 --> 1:09:32.000]  it's disgusting it's kim jung ill worship
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.760]  all right chris finish up your uh points uh you say they've got a nuclear
[1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:38.720]  attack drill scheduled for months coming up this week i actually saw that in
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:42.240]  the news lots of military drills menacing the north
[1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:46.000]  which is asking for it no day taunt from the west
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.680]  you know they give them nukes build them up and then now are ready to have war
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:54.720]  with them same thing with pakistan while they use al-qaeda and taliban to menace
[1:09:54.720 --> 1:09:58.160]  the central government and their own presidents on record saying taliban and
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:02.160]  al-qaeda works for you you're destabilizing as you killed budo
[1:10:02.160 --> 1:10:05.680]  i mean this is really happening the new world order
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:09.360]  is going down the line with iran with the middle east
[1:10:09.360 --> 1:10:16.480]  with iraq with georgia and south osetia and russia and ukraine and poland
[1:10:16.480 --> 1:10:24.000]  and uh between china and india and uh pakistan and with south and north
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:29.120]  korea and they are just stirring africa the globalists are stirring stuff up
[1:10:29.120 --> 1:10:32.000]  this does not look good ladies and gentlemen this looks like when they
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:34.800]  start world wars this is how the globalists do it
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:36.960]  now i'm not saying they're going to do it because
[1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:40.160]  you know they've got us on the verge of world war a couple other times but
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.080]  this is we're probably in the next few years
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:46.720]  going to go ahead and have world war three folks and and then people won't
[1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:50.240]  see oh alex don't fear monger it's not fear mongering
[1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:55.360]  it's reality they're the north has declared war they say the armistice
[1:10:55.360 --> 1:11:00.640]  the truth is off we're back to war that has been done that is roiders that is
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:04.320]  ap they're firing missiles off the coast of
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:09.200]  japan the vice president the former president
[1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:12.480]  as you just heard killed himself supposedly
[1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:17.280]  this is getting crazy and you add to that everything else has been going on
[1:11:17.280 --> 1:11:21.360]  all this martial law stuff was about drills so when the globalist start
[1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:26.000]  world war three they can lock america down and get away with their geopolitical
[1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:30.800]  operations all right i'm but let's say i'm gonna go to
[1:11:30.800 --> 1:11:34.160]  watch in the next segment let's go to chris in south
[1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:37.280]  korea chris finish up your point i gotta go to others
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:40.880]  i'll try to make it quick uh the saber rattling isn't coming out of nowhere
[1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:44.560]  actually because the stealth for the past several months has actually been
[1:11:44.560 --> 1:11:47.520]  well the north keeps catching southern spies up there
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:51.200]  trying to assassinate kim jong-il or running a spy ring or something like
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:55.120]  that the south is being continually actually provoking the north
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:59.360]  so it's not coming out of nowhere and secondly if something happens here and
[1:11:59.360 --> 1:12:02.880]  there's a nuclear explosion it doesn't match with the north's
[1:12:02.880 --> 1:12:06.720]  rhetoric because the north wants to reunify and take over the peninsula
[1:12:06.720 --> 1:12:10.400]  they want to shoot japan with a missile it wouldn't make any sense
[1:12:10.400 --> 1:12:13.600]  if a nuclear bomb goes off in south korea so
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:17.680]  yeah but the north koreans are are i mean trying to menace everybody
[1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:21.360]  they do routinely will fire missiles right off the coast of japan
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:25.600]  i mean what about japan coming out monday the
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:29.440]  officially in in their parliament in their diet saying we may go ahead and
[1:12:29.440 --> 1:12:33.360]  hit north korea i mean this is getting crazy and everybody knows japan
[1:12:33.360 --> 1:12:38.240]  everybody knows japan has a secret nuke arsenal just like israel
[1:12:38.240 --> 1:12:42.800]  oh yeah i'm carried out of my mind here really
[1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:46.080]  but i don't think for a minute and this has been confirmed even in mainstream
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:49.040]  media japan remember all the times they have nuclear
[1:12:49.040 --> 1:12:53.200]  explosions you know uh... reactor meltdowns
[1:12:53.200 --> 1:12:56.960]  and uh... they'll be uh... you know all these samurai types running out in their
[1:12:56.960 --> 1:13:00.960]  suits you know in their hand mixing the uranium and plutonium i mean
[1:13:00.960 --> 1:13:04.320]  they are they've got so many nukes it'll make your head spin
[1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:10.160]  and this whole thing is just descending into insanity very quickly
[1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:14.720]  oh yeah it's it's crazy yeah folks do you do you think the japanese really
[1:13:14.720 --> 1:13:19.840]  don't have nukes they just i remember in 1999 they bought the biggest
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:23.840]  one-time shipment of uranium and plutonium ever purchased
[1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:27.600]  they bought i forget the exact headline well you guys google this in printed
[1:13:27.600 --> 1:13:33.040]  formings i want to get it exact uh... japan buys
[1:13:33.040 --> 1:13:38.240]  uranium plutonium from EU and i want to say it was enough to run 10 000
[1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:42.960]  reactors for a thousand years or something and it was all weapons great
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:46.320]  and then all these countries didn't want the the triple hole tanker
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:49.760]  full of uranium and plutonium coming within thousands of miles of their
[1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:53.840]  nations there were all those protest that was delivered
[1:13:53.840 --> 1:13:57.840]  into japan in 1999
[1:13:57.840 --> 1:14:02.960]  and those assembly lines are just rolling nukes off and nuke delivering
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:07.360]  missiles if you think us made cruise missiles
[1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:12.240]  will shoot down your chimney can you imagine a japanese made one
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:16.400]  for those people in those factories those secret labs working themselves to
[1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:22.160]  death for the emperor god help us let's go to uh
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:27.120]  and watson's coming up with a key report chris in virginia you're on the air
[1:14:27.120 --> 1:14:32.240]  chris hung up cowl cowl in florida
[1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:37.440]  alex hey buddy hey uh i had a really bad thought
[1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:41.840]  um if the new world order wanted to get rid of all of us
[1:14:41.840 --> 1:14:45.840]  couldn't they just release the swine flu and then put the cure for the
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:52.640]  swine flu inside the vaccination they've got to they've got to first drill
[1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:56.640]  everybody and prepare the police state and society with lots of
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:01.120]  weak soft kills uh to then train everybody that they're the savers to
[1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:04.400]  make sure it's all done in an orderly fashion
[1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.760]  yeah but if they put the cure inside the vaccination
[1:15:07.760 --> 1:15:11.760]  then people like you and me we wouldn't take the vaccination
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:15.760]  and there they go they got rid of all the people who would oppose the new world
[1:15:15.760 --> 1:15:18.960]  order yeah i thought about that that point's been made
[1:15:18.960 --> 1:15:23.760]  that point's been made do you think it has any validity
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:28.640]  this point i mean well you'll know you'll know very fast
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:31.840]  locally you know the media will put out this info at first but if but if people
[1:15:31.840 --> 1:15:35.600]  taking the shot the vaccine are saved then you'll know it's good if they're
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:38.160]  not you know it's a fraud but here's the problem
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:42.000]  they were vaccinating people in mexico with old flu vaccine that had no
[1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:48.320]  resemblance to this virus mutation you know when that was happening so it's
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:52.160]  all i mean for seven years they haven't guessed the right flu
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:56.560]  mutation with the vaccines
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:16:00.000]  you know major
[1:16:00.240 --> 1:16:05.520]  major hospitals like the mayo clinic have come out in in a six-year study
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:09.360]  last week you can we covered it uh last week
[1:16:09.360 --> 1:16:15.440]  reporting that you're 2.9 times almost three times more
[1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:19.280]  likely to end up in the hospital or die from flu if you've had the flu shot
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:22.800]  i mean it's an absolute fact my mother never got sick
[1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:25.440]  and she was doing triathlons like 10 years ago
[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:28.320]  and and and they were saying oh you ought to get a shot a month before to make
[1:16:28.320 --> 1:16:31.920]  sure you don't get the flu because the triathlons the middle of flu season
[1:16:31.920 --> 1:16:35.840]  and she took it and almost killed her everybody i know has almost been killed
[1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:39.520]  by flu shot i don't need the mayo clinic to tell me
[1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:43.840]  if i thought flu shots were good i'd be rolling my sleeve up
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:48.800]  okay that was my only point that's a very astute question thank you so much
[1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:53.840]  uh let's talk to uh shon in minnesota shon go ahead
[1:16:53.840 --> 1:17:01.280]  hey hey there good day to you alex uh this this is a bad time right now i can
[1:17:01.280 --> 1:17:05.680]  just i hope i'm wrong but i can smell i can just smell a false
[1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:13.680]  flag operation uh coming coming soon um i wanted to i want to get your
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:18.480]  perspective on something about a month ago a good friend of mine
[1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:23.360]  turned me on to a documentary called september clues have you seen it by any
[1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:28.480]  chance september clues you know it it rings
[1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:34.240]  bell it's a it's a documentary about it
[1:17:34.240 --> 1:17:37.120]  presents i remember it's about it's about airplanes not
[1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:41.360]  flying into the towers yeah it presents evidence
[1:17:41.360 --> 1:17:47.360]  that possibly the mainstream media emphasis on mainstream media i'm not
[1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:51.520]  i'm not picking on all media general and certainly not the alternative but it
[1:17:51.520 --> 1:17:55.760]  does present some compelling evidence that the mainstream media
[1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:59.920]  i hear you and i appreciate your call you know they did fake newscast drills
[1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.360]  in the first gulf war and we have the video of that and then you know they
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:07.600]  had fake news conferences with fake palm trees that they put on tv
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:11.040]  and the queen of england has been caught going to fake meetings
[1:18:11.040 --> 1:18:14.560]  uh in africa really on soundstage sets in england
[1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:17.840]  you know to meet with africans because she doesn't want to get near them
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:22.400]  um but i have friends and family who saw at least one of the aircraft and then i
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:25.440]  say that and the tv fakery people say no you're
[1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:28.400]  an agent shut up so i've really seen a lot of
[1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:32.160]  unprofessionalism out of most of those people and a lot of craziness
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:35.520]  and it has the hallmarks of a disinformation operation
[1:18:35.520 --> 1:18:40.640]  um now it looks like a plane didn't hit the pentagon the evidence you have to
[1:18:40.640 --> 1:18:43.760]  look at the evidence but with the towers it's different
[1:18:43.760 --> 1:18:47.600]  and it's but you know that's it people are allowed to have their views and their
[1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:54.560]  opinions uh let's go to uh eddie and china eddie are you an american in china
[1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:59.280]  hi hi that's how you're doing good sir uh tell us why you're in china
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:02.480]  uh i i'm probably running an export company
[1:19:02.480 --> 1:19:05.920]  okay interesting so so you're over there uh give us your take on the whole uh
[1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:11.520]  korean peninsula situation well the thing is on chinese television i don't
[1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:15.040]  want to talk too long um there's they've been showing a
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:19.440]  lot of anti-japanese programming they've had a special

[1:25:07.280 --> 1:25:12.800]  paul watson joining us from the united kingdom
[1:25:12.800 --> 1:25:18.720]  headline at presentplanet.com state of war between two koreas after armistice ended
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:26.160]  this is a big deal and you add to this all the military forces moving around the globe
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:32.880]  from eastern europe through central asia right into the far east in the
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:37.520]  korean peninsula this is serious business paul watson
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:41.440]  well it's good to be back good to have you here about break down
[1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:45.040]  your take on what's happening right now then let's get into who really gave
[1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:48.640]  north korea and pakistan the nukes
[1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:52.880]  well as he just mentioned north korea is now
[1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:59.760]  repudiating the 1953 armistice which was not a
[1:25:59.760 --> 1:26:03.680]  it wasn't a peace treaty it was just basically a ceasefire
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:10.240]  that ended the korean war and now they're saying that that
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:14.400]  that is now not in effect according to an official
[1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:18.080]  statement by the korean central news agency
[1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:24.400]  and they're also saying that any attempt to inspect north korean vessels
[1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:30.240]  which south korea has said it will do with u.s help with the u.s running the
[1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:33.840]  program will be countered with quote prompt and strong
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:38.880]  military strikes and we know that as soon as north korea
[1:26:38.880 --> 1:26:43.200]  does anything against south korea then the u.s is going to come to south korea
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:48.480]  is aid north korea is allied with china and just as
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:54.160]  during the korean war the chinese military will support north korea
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:26:59.840]  and that will only be emphasized more so with the fact that u.s troop
[1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:02.880]  you know if they're sent over there will be right on the border with china
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.680]  because china borders north korea so that south korea exactly i hadn't even
[1:27:07.680 --> 1:27:10.400]  made that point that over a million
[1:27:10.400 --> 1:27:13.600]  chinese troops were engaging marine corps and army
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:19.200]  and air force during the korean conflict as it was called
[1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:26.080]  this is insane right so i mean the armistice in 1953 wasn't even
[1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:31.600]  signed by south korea it was signed by the u.s and the united nation
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:37.040]  so technically north korea and south korea have always been in a state of
[1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:40.480]  war because they never signed a proper peace treaty
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:44.560]  but that fragile ceasefire that armistice
[1:27:44.560 --> 1:27:48.240]  was still virtually in effect until today
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:53.360]  when north korea completely renounced it and basically declared that they're
[1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:57.440]  now in a state of war with south korea and if south korea makes any
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:00.560]  movement whatsoever then they're going to attack
[1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:05.760]  whether that believable with what kim jong il said in the past
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:12.240]  remains to be seen but is the very serious situation
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:15.760]  because if you remember on the eve of the iraq war
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:22.400]  in early 2003 when the threat of saddam hussein was
[1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:26.160]  being propagandized by the u.s government and the media
[1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:29.840]  the non-existent threat as was soon to be revealed
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:33.360]  kim jong il was saying that he was going to quote
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.360]  destroy the world and that was played down at the time
[1:28:37.360 --> 1:28:41.040]  by the media and by the u.s government because they didn't want
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:44.400]  such obvious saber rattling while they were trying to
[1:28:44.400 --> 1:28:47.680]  make the case that iraq was the major threat when
[1:28:47.680 --> 1:28:51.280]  iraq was displaying fealty to everything that
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:28:56.080]  the u.s and the united nations was doing in terms of inspection
[1:28:56.080 --> 1:29:00.000]  but now the same we're here in the same rhetoric
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:05.520]  by kim jong il out north korea not only by him obviously by japan as well as
[1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:08.400]  you mentioned before they're threatening to attack
[1:29:08.400 --> 1:29:12.800]  but now it seems a lot more serious because of this
[1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:17.040]  second nuclear test now what was interesting about
[1:29:17.040 --> 1:29:21.920]  the first nuclear test was that originally they claimed that
[1:29:21.920 --> 1:29:25.040]  north korea didn't claim but the russians and others claim that it was
[1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:31.840]  50 megaton blasted turned out to be one and that the latest one had turned out to
[1:29:31.840 --> 1:29:34.480]  be less powerful as well it's only turned out to be
[1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:38.960]  about a quarter of what it was a power that it was exactly these are tiny a
[1:29:38.960 --> 1:29:42.560]  bombs if they're even that they're probably just packing those tunnels
[1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:47.200]  full of a football field of tnt to register on the ricker scales because

[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  and some of the other things that are going on so that is coming up
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:06.880]  and we're talking to paul watson paul
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:10.080]  the world is a dangerous place governments killed conservatively just
[1:34:10.080 --> 1:34:15.520]  the big governments 200 plus million people last century
[1:34:15.520 --> 1:34:19.520]  in fact i do i show 200 million killed in in game and forgot to put what the
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:23.440]  soviets did i just messed up on the graph when i was telling the graphics guy
[1:34:23.440 --> 1:34:28.640]  so it's 250 million at least but let's just be conservative and say 200 million
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:31.760]  because i did put the communist chinese in there
[1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:35.600]  i mean governments the number one cause of death unnatural death
[1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:39.360]  and they're running around jockeying for global dominance and power
[1:34:39.360 --> 1:34:42.720]  these people are bored all the money all the sex all the
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:47.120]  they're sick of it they want war they want power this is the big game
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:50.320]  you know they call the most dangerous game hunting people and you can still
[1:34:50.320 --> 1:34:53.760]  do that in africa today and it's been done you know by many
[1:34:53.760 --> 1:34:56.880]  ancient cultures the romans did it the babelonians did it the as tex
[1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:59.120]  did it
[1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:02.080]  native americans did it some of the tribes would capture other tribes and
[1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:05.360]  hunt them uh some of the gaelic grips would do that
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:09.840]  you know the point is humans do this well the elite do it on a mass scale
[1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:14.320]  and i mean paul looking at the ram corporation document i know your
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:18.320]  article gets into that let's get into the ram corporation wanting war from
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:21.520]  your angle needing war what they said
[1:35:21.520 --> 1:35:25.280]  and it's all tied into this masterpiece you did and curtain emma's on a
[1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:28.160]  similar excellent piece that covers some of the other angles
[1:35:28.160 --> 1:35:32.000]  state of war between two koreas after armistice ended prisonplanet.com
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.480]  paul watson curtain emma north korea ends armistice
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:37.360]  threatens to attack south korea that's info wars dot com different
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:40.400]  different perspectives different angles because there's so many different
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:44.400]  stratas of this story um
[1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:49.520]  watson let's get into the ram corporation situation
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:52.960]  historically what this means it looks like battle lines are being drawn
[1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:57.440]  globally and then let's explain who's given the nukes to pakistan
[1:35:57.440 --> 1:36:04.240]  who's given the nukes uh to north korea and who's even given the nukes u.s
[1:36:04.240 --> 1:36:08.400]  england and israel and halliburton to iran
[1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:11.760]  i mean this is incredible every time it's the same people
[1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:15.200]  and the question is why do these countries take
[1:36:15.200 --> 1:36:18.480]  it's like all the old westerns where the evil guys just shot the
[1:36:18.480 --> 1:36:24.560]  you know the uh little uh pan miners you've been out there panning some
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:27.200]  gold and there's a lot of true stories that these
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:30.720]  blui lamor books and things are based on and they come up and shoot the old
[1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:34.560]  daddy panning for gold and his 12 year old gets up and starts throwing
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:38.640]  punches at the bad guys sent by the railroad to steal the claim
[1:36:38.640 --> 1:36:42.880]  and then they throw a gun down at the kids feet and say pick up the gun kid
[1:36:42.880 --> 1:36:46.640]  pick it up and the kid picks up the gun and they shoot him
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:50.960]  um anyways i'm ranting watson go ahead
[1:36:50.960 --> 1:36:54.960]  well yeah the ran story was something we reported on it
[1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:59.360]  in october last year and it was a story that came out of the
[1:36:59.360 --> 1:37:03.280]  chinese media which is obviously state media
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:07.440]  um but there was no apparent motive to making the story up
[1:37:07.440 --> 1:37:14.880]  and it said that the rand corporation had gone to the pentagon and lobbied
[1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:19.840]  for a new war they said they needed a new bigger conflict
[1:37:19.840 --> 1:37:26.560]  um north korea was mentioned but it was ruled out because they said they needed
[1:37:26.560 --> 1:37:31.120]  something bigger now obviously north korea on its own is a
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:34.480]  small country but if you're talking about a
[1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:38.800]  american troops on the border of china then that's world war three
[1:37:38.800 --> 1:37:43.440]  if it escalates they also mentioned japan
[1:37:43.440 --> 1:37:47.920]  whether in the context they could attack japan or set japan up
[1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:51.920]  it is unclear but we know that japan yesterday
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:56.640]  their former defense minister who's still in the ruling government
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:01.200]  threatened said japan should basically abolish his pacifist constitution so
[1:38:01.200 --> 1:38:04.880]  they could attack north korea with cruise missiles
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:09.440]  so japan could be involved in that way but
[1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:13.040]  yeah north korea was mentioned by rand but it was apparently ruled out at the
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:17.120]  time my only hope that is that this doesn't
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:21.440]  escalate because the impression from what i understand
[1:38:21.440 --> 1:38:26.800]  is that china treats north korea in the sense of
[1:38:26.800 --> 1:38:30.640]  keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer
[1:38:30.640 --> 1:38:34.640]  so with that if that's the case i would hope that
[1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:38.880]  china is prepared to sacrifice north korea
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:42.960]  for the purposes of not escalating this into what could potentially be world
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:47.920]  war three and from what i've read chinese military
[1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:52.880]  officials are talking to russian and south korean military
[1:38:52.880 --> 1:39:00.320]  officials on how they can diffuse it so hopefully that will be the case
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:04.640]  but these things can escalate out of control i mean
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:09.120]  pakistan and india were on the brink of nuclear war in 2002
[1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:13.360]  the people don't understand how close that came to being a reality
[1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:19.840]  so these things can escalate quickly and the fact that i'm in china next week
[1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:24.240]  obviously because china borders north korea
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:28.000]  i hope that it doesn't escalate but it's certainly being interesting
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.960]  two weeks in china if it does an interesting choice of vacation
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:35.680]  destinations i think switzerland was better last
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:40.080]  year when you went there paul and closer to home but
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:44.320]  yeah i think you ought to cancel that trip if this continues to escalate maybe
[1:39:44.320 --> 1:39:47.600]  maybe go take a few uh days off where she still writes stories you can't
[1:39:47.600 --> 1:39:52.080]  control yourself when you do take off two weeks a year for your holiday
[1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:55.680]  um i'm about to have to cancel my little two-day
[1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:59.520]  fishing trip my wife and kids are already on
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:04.080]  their way out to a cabin and i uh i'm calling them up saying i don't
[1:40:04.080 --> 1:40:07.040]  think i'll be there we'll see what happens
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:09.600]  and the point is the reason i might as well stay here is that even if i leave
[1:40:09.600 --> 1:40:13.600]  town and bermas is in here sitting in i'll just be
[1:40:13.600 --> 1:40:17.120]  down the street on a landline calling in at a hotel room to the show
[1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:20.720]  so one way or the another i'll i'll be here the next two days
[1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:24.880]  um watson if you look at our world war one started
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:29.360]  with the assassination of the crown prince of the austrian uh
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:35.360]  hungarian empire if you look at how world war two started if you look at how
[1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:38.720]  they prod and manipulate they first build up enemies
[1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:42.640]  the globalist built up hitler and then went after him they built up north korea
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:47.200]  going after him build up pakistan build up iran i mean it's the same story over
[1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:50.080]  and over again these bankers literally build the
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:55.760]  soviets so they can be an enemy the cia funds castro
[1:40:55.760 --> 1:40:58.800]  and then supposedly lose can loses control of him
[1:40:58.800 --> 1:41:05.200]  they do the same thing over and over and over again and and there's no doubt
[1:41:05.200 --> 1:41:10.720]  that they armed north korea there's no doubt they aren't pakistan the pakistani
[1:41:10.720 --> 1:41:15.120]  president goes on tv and says the west is controlling taliban and al qaeda to
[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:18.240]  commit assassinations and destabilize the government
[1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:22.240]  only about a third most the populist cities so it's the most the population
[1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:24.880]  but it's about a third of the geography i've seen the
[1:41:24.880 --> 1:41:28.720]  maps of what pakistan even controls today
[1:41:28.720 --> 1:41:32.320]  and they're losing control of their nation just like russia lost control of
[1:41:32.320 --> 1:41:36.960]  afghanistan to cia controlled operatives and uh you know we're not
[1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:40.080]  defending pakistan or defending russia facts or facts
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:43.120]  and then our media has such contempt for the american people
[1:41:43.120 --> 1:41:48.400]  that they tell us taliban and al qaeda are with the pakistani government i mean
[1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:51.840]  how asinine uh is that and they clearly
[1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:55.760]  launched the attacks on india and we had the former head of pakistani
[1:41:55.760 --> 1:42:01.920]  intelligence hameed ghoul on breaking that down
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:07.600]  i mean it's the same mo over and over clearly looking at this picture
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:10.880]  they're trying to make the entire world to send
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:15.200]  into regional conflicts and then nato in the united states will play the part of
[1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:18.800]  saviors uh your take on that watch and then let's get into who
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:24.400]  gave them the nukes well that's right it's called order out of chaos and this
[1:42:24.400 --> 1:42:29.920]  is why the major international arms mogulists are always protected at
[1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:33.440]  every turn by the military industrial complex
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:40.560]  of u.s intelligence agencies namely dr aq kahn the father of
[1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:46.320]  pakistan's atom bomb who admitted in 2004
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:50.320]  that he was the leader of a worldwide
[1:42:50.320 --> 1:42:56.960]  arm smuggling network that passed on both information related to construction
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:02.240]  of nuclear weapons and also he had several front companies that
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:07.200]  manufactured key parts for centrifuges which operated out of
[1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:13.040]  dubai and of course this the front company
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:18.480]  shipped these nuclear components to iran libya and
[1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:23.200]  north korea now i've posted on prismplanet.com
[1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:28.400]  about 20 minutes ago an article first written in
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:32.080]  october 2006 because it's more relevant than ever
[1:43:32.080 --> 1:43:38.480]  today written by greg palas called how george bush gave gave crazy kim the
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:42.480]  bomb and it discusses the fact that
[1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:48.640]  before 9 11 and the memo was released after 9 11 by
[1:43:48.640 --> 1:43:55.920]  greg palas via bbc news night top level u.s intelligent
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:00.560]  intelligence agent told palas that gave him documents
[1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:07.360]  proving it that the fbi were issued by higher
[1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:13.680]  ups a quote back off directive not only to people connected
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:18.880]  with the 9 11 pats the hijackers the other movements couldn't be traced
[1:44:18.880 --> 1:44:27.600]  w 199 i the w 199 i and also within w 199 i
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:31.920]  was uh an order to quote back off khan lab
[1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:36.080]  pakistan the bomb that's a direct quote out the memo
[1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:43.760]  khan lab pakistan the bomb so here you have shortly before 9 11
[1:44:43.760 --> 1:44:51.040]  in 2001 the fbi being ordered to back off a q khan while he was
[1:44:51.040 --> 1:44:54.560]  conducting this uh illegal international arms
[1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:58.320]  smuggling operation and giving nuclear technology a nuclear
[1:44:58.320 --> 1:45:03.920]  secret not only to iran but also to north korea
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:08.000]  and uh it goes back even further than that
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:16.160]  because as far back as 1975 and also again in 1983
[1:45:16.160 --> 1:45:20.720]  doctor a q khan kept coming and going out of holland which made the
[1:45:20.720 --> 1:45:25.440]  dutch authorities deeply suspicious of what he was up to
[1:45:25.440 --> 1:45:30.320]  and they tried to arrest him for questioning in 1975 on 1983 but on
[1:45:30.320 --> 1:45:36.000]  both occasions the cia intervened and said leave him alone
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:41.200]  and the dutch authorities were prevented from arresting a q khan
[1:45:41.200 --> 1:45:44.960]  and the former dutch prime minister said quote
[1:45:44.960 --> 1:45:49.360]  the man was followed for almost 10 years and obviously he was a serious problem
[1:45:49.360 --> 1:45:55.120]  but again i was told that the secret services could handle it more effectively
[1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:59.200]  and uh he later stated that khan was allowed to slip
[1:45:59.200 --> 1:46:03.280]  in and out of the netherlands with the blessing of the cia
[1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:07.760]  and the evidence goes on and on in your articles you've got up at prismplanet.com
[1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:16.000]  another facet to that is the fact that we have a b b it's it's not enough to
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:19.200]  have the technology and the know-how and the centrifuges
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:24.400]  you need the fissile material you need the uranium the plutonium
[1:46:24.400 --> 1:46:31.280]  and the reactors and that was a b b and who was the head of a b b the european
[1:46:31.280 --> 1:46:34.880]  company the swiss company when it transferred
[1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:39.760]  uh the systems to in the mid 1990s it all got blamed on bill clinton he was
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:43.600]  certainly part of it and dashel was involved as well
[1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:51.280]  mafia bossy is but it but the bag man was good old donald rumsfeld
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:58.240]  that's right and this was uh in 2000 two years before north korea was declared
[1:46:58.240 --> 1:47:02.960]  part of the axis of evil by george bush in his state the union speech
[1:47:02.960 --> 1:47:08.000]  now and then you got haliburton giving the nuke parts that you can't make this
[1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:13.200]  up this is associated press haliburton goes all we have a special allowance
[1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:16.960]  we're allowed to give the nuke parts to to iran
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:20.720]  i mean folks they're not patriots they're here
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:26.480]  to suck you dry the government doesn't care about you they're a mafia go ahead
[1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:31.360]  yeah uh rumsfeld was asked about that in 2002
[1:47:31.360 --> 1:47:36.320]  when it came out and he said he basically said he just doesn't remember
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:39.760]  but then he had people who were on the board of a bb with it
[1:47:39.760 --> 1:47:43.520]  rumsfeld was an executive director getting paid nearly two hundred thousand
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:48.560]  dollars a year who said that he directly lobbied
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:54.080]  them um other warhawks to get the deal done to get the light
[1:47:54.080 --> 1:47:59.760]  water reactors sold to north korea and at the time the excuse was that
[1:47:59.760 --> 1:48:04.400]  light water reactors can't be used to make nuclear weapons
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:07.200]  which is a bit of a strange thing to say when
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:13.040]  the united states at the time was the chapter still is today chastising iran
[1:48:13.040 --> 1:48:17.520]  for having light water reactors but in the case of north korea they claimed
[1:48:17.520 --> 1:48:20.560]  they could have made nuclear weapons well there's also a different type of
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:23.680]  light waters the type that according to the weapons
[1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:28.720]  inspectors and physicists that iran has can be used but it's
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:32.000]  very hard the type of light waters given in north korea
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:38.480]  by a bb and the west are the perfect type
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:42.880]  henry sokolski i've quoted in the article head of the non-proliferation
[1:48:42.880 --> 1:48:47.360]  policy education center said light water reactors could be used to produce
[1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:52.000]  dozens of bombs worth of weapons grade plutonium in both north korea and iran
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:56.320]  this is true of all whitewater reactors then he said these reactors are like
[1:48:56.320 --> 1:48:59.440]  all reactors they have the potential to make weapons so you might end up
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:02.640]  supplying the worst nuclear violator with the means to acquire
[1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:06.560]  the very weapons we're trying to prevent it from acquiring
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:09.840]  of course i mean this is what i mean you tell a good old boy this
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:12.320]  they can't find korea on a map and they just say
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:17.600]  shut up call me we need to nukem and you're like uh the government's taking
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:20.560]  our freedoms and our rights our government's been hijacked and they
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:22.720]  and they just look at you like you're an idiot
[1:49:22.720 --> 1:49:25.920]  when meanwhile rumsfeld is running around arming everybody
[1:49:25.920 --> 1:49:31.360]  i'm sick of these traders wrapping themselves in the american flag paul
[1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:35.360]  i know and then uh even after bush declared them partly access to the
[1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:39.920]  evilly he gave them another 95 million dollars in 2002
[1:49:39.920 --> 1:49:43.840]  and again more money in january 2003
[1:49:43.840 --> 1:49:47.040]  those light water reactors were told
[1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:51.120]  the the building of them was suspended later on
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:49:55.120]  so the key thing that i emphasize is the aq con connection because
[1:49:55.120 --> 1:49:58.880]  people say oh those reactors were dismantled and all this
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:02.080]  but it's still interesting that they knew these light water reactors could
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:06.000]  produce nuclear bombs and they were happy to give them to
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  the uh starlin is to dictate to kim jong il
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:13.920]  when he was threatening to destroy the world at the same time
[1:50:13.920 --> 1:50:18.080]  and actually firing missiles at one of which
[1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:22.800]  of the warhead actually reached alaska that was reported by south korean
[1:50:22.800 --> 1:50:29.440]  oh hans blitz oh no i don't think hans blitz is going to be too keen on
[1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:34.160]  inspecting those weapons if the south koreans in the u.s try to get that
[1:50:34.160 --> 1:50:36.400]  deal through
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:41.440]  oh yeah i try to make jokes about it gallows humor paul do one more segment

[1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:33.280]  in the next hour paul watson in a few minutes we've got left
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:38.160]  so many angles so many points to all this are you sharing my concern
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:41.680]  historically with the rand corporation document saying they want this war and
[1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:46.480]  everything else that that the globalist need a war
[1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:50.320]  and that all over the world they're pulling out the stops to try to cause
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:55.840]  regional conflicts as a pretext for wider wars
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:00.400]  yeah that's definitely the case obviously whether this is going to be it
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:06.880]  nobody knows and the key um the keystone on which it will rest will be
[1:57:06.880 --> 1:57:12.480]  china's reaction because if they you know commit to their
[1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:16.480]  um agreement with north korea to defend them
[1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:19.840]  then it could escalate into a wider conflict
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:26.000]  so cooler heads have got to prevail um we witnessed similar things in october
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:30.000]  2006 when there was that first nuclear test
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:34.480]  which basically turned out to be a nuclear fizzle it wasn't a massive bomb
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:39.280]  by north korea but i'm seeing much more
[1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:43.920]  saber rattling after this one this time around so
[1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:46.800]  hopefully it's going to die down again but
[1:57:46.800 --> 1:57:52.320]  with the uh u.s military industrial complex busy
[1:57:52.320 --> 1:57:57.920]  coddling and protecting the uh biggest arms dealers in the world
[1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:03.840]  like the cia asset a q karn who sold north korea its nuclear weapons under
[1:58:03.840 --> 1:58:11.600]  know how we have to construct them then anything's possible
[1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:18.560]  absolutely hey on a side note kevin trudeau just text message me hi hi kevin

[2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:58.480]  control the feds are saying they may take over 70 percent of it that means
[2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:03.120]  you're going to pay for it as taxpayers so they can move to china and brazil
[2:01:03.120 --> 2:01:06.000]  that's already been announced they're leaving they're going to ship back

[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:20.560]  trillion to foreign banks that we got to pay foreign tax money might as well
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:24.160]  they're going to have socialism save the car companies but now you can forget it
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:29.520]  we shouldn't bail them out though the feds are just to move them overseas
[2:01:29.520 --> 2:01:34.800]  billionaire elite want to control uh two-thirds of the dumb people they want
[2:01:34.800 --> 2:01:38.000]  them wiped off the planet that's the headline over at prisonplanet.com

[2:01:56.960 --> 2:02:00.480]  because somebody sent it to me a few weeks ago and it's how to consolidate
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:05.200]  your credit card debt uh and how to you know control you know use
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:09.360]  the federal laws against higher interest rates and it's just good advice
[2:02:09.360 --> 2:02:12.640]  and that's why they're scared of them and why bill deberg group was talking to
[2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:15.680]  him uh is because i mean all i know is the stuff
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:19.440]  about herbs that he writes about is the mainline documented stuff not kooky at
[2:02:19.440 --> 2:02:24.560]  all he has a right to say it and put it out even if it was pure bull
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:31.200]  but it's not pure bull and i've we we've probably gotten 500 emails
[2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:34.320]  about him being on and i'd say 80 percent of it's positive saying oh yeah i got
[2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:37.200]  his book i got his materials yeah you know it's saving
[2:02:37.200 --> 2:02:41.440]  a lot of money with my debts it's you know uh you know i was really sick but
[2:02:41.440 --> 2:02:44.720]  what he talked about about eating nothing but organic food and taking these
[2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:48.720]  herbs and exercising now i you know feel great
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:51.440]  i mean it's his right to say it it's his right to do it i know he's listening
[2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:55.760]  right now he just text message me but we you know we just had kevin drudeau on
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:58.400]  the show and that doesn't mean i know everything
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:01.680]  about him or endorse everything he does and who he is i support
[2:03:01.680 --> 2:03:05.920]  his first amendment i support his free speech
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:10.000]  um and the fact that the main street media demonizes
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:13.440]  any man and attacks him i spent about an hour last night watching
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.280]  clips of his infomercials watching pieces that attack him
[2:03:17.280 --> 2:03:20.240]  and i just see all the media tricks that i've seen that have been used against
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:24.800]  myself and so all i'm telling you is is
[2:03:24.800 --> 2:03:27.680]  that when the mainstream media is coming at for somebody
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:32.000]  uh i generally give them the benefit of the doubt and then
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:35.920]  you know i i took his mega memory course i think his my dad bought it for me when
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:39.600]  i was in high school and it really worked and then i learned later it was just a
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:42.640]  lot of tried and trusted and true memory
[2:03:42.640 --> 2:03:46.720]  you know tricks that they teach people uh you know in industry
[2:03:46.720 --> 2:03:50.400]  uh and i read the natural cures they don't want you to know about
[2:03:50.400 --> 2:03:53.520]  because listeners mail me everything it was mailed to me years ago when we get
[2:03:53.520 --> 2:03:56.640]  five six seven sometimes 20 30 books a day mailed
[2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:00.000]  you know hundreds of letters a day and it's just mainline stuff but even if
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:04.240]  it's not all accurate nobody's perfect it's his right to say it
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:09.040]  i mean they're now introduced bills the cyber bullying act to ban free speech
[2:04:09.040 --> 2:04:12.000]  and if someone says that you hurt their feelings it says word for word
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:16.640]  you go to prison look either we got a first amendment
[2:04:16.640 --> 2:04:20.480]  or we don't it's that simple i don't think
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:25.280]  kevin trudeau selling snake oil uh but back on this country was free people
[2:04:25.280 --> 2:04:29.840]  could pull up in a trailer a horse drawn carriage and hold up a
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:33.440]  bottle of laudanum and say this will cure your ills make your hair grow
[2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:38.240]  make you you know feel great and it was opium i don't support them pushing opium
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:41.520]  but it's better than them making it illegal and now we have more opium
[2:04:41.520 --> 2:04:45.600]  because it jacks up the price of it and our whole society's falling apart
[2:04:45.600 --> 2:04:50.240]  you see what i'm saying uh i support people's free speech that's why we had
[2:04:50.240 --> 2:04:53.680]  kevin trudeau on turned out to be a very interesting interview
[2:04:53.680 --> 2:04:57.280]  so uh that's the bottom line on that he has his free speech
[2:04:57.280 --> 2:05:01.120]  i think we all agree on that your phone calls straight ahead your free speech
[2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:05.280]  many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the united states
[2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:08.720]  no longer provides plants with the mineral elements which are essential to

[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:26.480]  hey alex how you doing good sir
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:30.000]  um i don't really have any insight on anything from this part of the world
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:34.240]  and surpassing through right now i wanted to talk about um
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:42.880]  conditioning and predictive programming and uh the revelation of the method
[2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:50.400]  um actually first off i i i've heard you say i think i heard
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:56.320]  you say that um you although you might not
[2:10:56.320 --> 2:11:02.640]  although you say that you um definitely what we're not aware of it
[2:11:02.640 --> 2:11:09.920]  but do you think it's possible that they might have allowed you to somehow
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:15.120]  uh get not be kicked out of bohemian grove so that
[2:11:15.120 --> 2:11:19.920]  you could expose that or something yes i mean i mean i mean it's possible
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:25.840]  that leprechauns are real you know maybe uh
[2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:29.520]  10 000 years ago somebody saw somebody walk up a little flying saucer that was
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:33.440]  dressed like a leprechaun that's where the legends of leprechauns began
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:37.280]  i don't speculate on space aliens and leprechauns
[2:11:37.280 --> 2:11:41.680]  because i can't prove one way or the other whether space aliens or leprechauns
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:45.200]  are real uh all i know is everybody else that's
[2:11:45.200 --> 2:11:48.480]  gone into bohemian grove has been caught and been arrested
[2:11:48.480 --> 2:11:53.040]  but of the it's got to be more than 10 reporters
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:59.040]  people magazine vanity fair uh the list goes on and on local reporters
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:02.960]  they've all been arrested because they try to go into the meeting halls
[2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:08.320]  it's in it's over 100 sub camps they're in that gorge it's 2 700 acres
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:10.880]  people say well why didn't you show the buddha statue
[2:12:10.880 --> 2:12:15.040]  you're covering up for the buddhist or why didn't you show some catholic statue
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:21.600]  because it is 2 700 acres of hills and and and rugged hills where
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:26.080]  where electric i mean gas powered golf carts with attendants take them up the
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:29.760]  hills i was only in the gorge and then went up one hill
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:33.440]  to hide in the woods because i've been questioned by secret service questioned
[2:12:33.440 --> 2:12:37.120]  by sonoma county sheriff's deputies they're the ones that arrested
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:41.280]  the vanity fair guy last year and you know if you read his description of
[2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:44.480]  what's inside what happened to him it's the same thing happened to me i was
[2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:49.120]  just amazingly calm so was mike hansen you know we kind of put on the texas
[2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:51.600]  charm with him and like yeah we're just hillbillies
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:54.800]  you know we're here with that club from texas how you doing
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:12:58.800]  and uh by the grace of god it was all about the mission you know you get past
[2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:04.160]  your fear of being caught and your anxiety by the mission by the mission
[2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:08.640]  and we snuck in we got out i believe they didn't know we were in there
[2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:15.040]  i and i've been honest about why i believe uh that we were left alone
[2:13:15.040 --> 2:13:20.800]  because i saw employees laughing at me and uh some of the sheriff's deputies
[2:13:20.800 --> 2:13:25.200]  were off laughing when the who i later learned was the sheriff came up to me
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:28.320]  and said i saw you with a spyglass up here and i said yeah it's in my bag
[2:13:28.320 --> 2:13:31.840]  binoculars it was really a camera you know you see when you get the shots of the
[2:13:31.840 --> 2:13:34.640]  river uh i was dumb and pulled it out because they
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:37.440]  they have hidden cameras i saw a guard check down there with tv screens when i
[2:13:37.440 --> 2:13:41.280]  walked past it so we you know we were being calm
[2:13:41.280 --> 2:13:44.880]  but later i learned more about the grove that they have a lot of male prostitutes
[2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:49.520]  come in there and i was 50 pounds lighter than and pretty good looking
[2:13:49.520 --> 2:13:52.400]  uh well i guess i was about 40 pounds lighter than because i lost a lot of
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:56.240]  weight but the point is that and mike's not a bad looking guy and so the big
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:13:58.960]  joke was they thought we were the male prostitutes
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:04.960]  so it's kind of a uh in glorious uh reason that we were able to infiltrate
[2:14:04.960 --> 2:14:09.920]  we were uh younger and good looking uh most of these reporters i've seen getting
[2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:14.480]  arrested or older uh or or aren't handsome and so that
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:18.080]  was the big joke i was being laughed at every time i was seeing it was a big
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:21.840]  joke i had we uh we went into one camp and had
[2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:24.720]  guys come up to us and ask us who we were with and it was kind of getting
[2:14:24.720 --> 2:14:28.080]  obvious and they were getting a little paranoid so we left and going back in
[2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:31.040]  hindsight the way these men were approaching us and talking to us
[2:14:31.040 --> 2:14:35.120]  these rich ceo's is they wanted to have a little you know role in the hay
[2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:39.440]  uh but that you know that uh you know as they say in
[2:14:39.440 --> 2:14:45.280]  spartagus uh i like uh oysters not snails i i'm not a snail
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:48.800]  eater i'm not in their camp so if you really want to know
[2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:53.200]  what was going on there that is probably what happened that's my
[2:14:53.200 --> 2:14:57.040]  glorious reason that we did and plus god is with us
[2:14:57.040 --> 2:14:59.760]  uh you know people like to joke around and say the force is with us but when
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:03.280]  god is with you who can be against you i believe in providence and i did say a
[2:15:03.280 --> 2:15:05.840]  prayer god let me get in here let me find out the truth
[2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:09.280]  if there is an ritual going on or if it isn't serious i'll come out and report
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:13.440]  it and i went in and reported it and so i agree with what our guest was saying
[2:15:13.440 --> 2:15:17.680]  yesterday about the elites rationalized to themselves that so what
[2:15:17.680 --> 2:15:21.360]  it's revelation of the method this stuff's going to come out anyway so so what
[2:15:21.360 --> 2:15:25.040]  have i'm exposing it but i've gotten death threats and been beat up and
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:28.800]  other things and so i know they don't like it you know that much
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:32.560]  but i've had more problems say when i'm exposing a federal judge
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:36.880]  like walter e smith pointing out he was having a fraudulent civil trial
[2:15:36.880 --> 2:15:40.720]  he was being basically sued for the criminal trial
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:44.640]  and then there he was the head of the civil trial i said what a fraud
[2:15:44.640 --> 2:15:48.560]  you know the dividends were found not guilty of murder
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:52.720]  but then they were found guilty of using weapons in the commission of a murder
[2:15:52.720 --> 2:15:55.680]  and that was a mandatory federal sentencing he put them there for 47
[2:15:55.680 --> 2:15:59.280]  years apiece and so i was bullhorning the judge i
[2:15:59.280 --> 2:16:03.520]  was making a big deal in the news and i got beat up for it pretty bad
[2:16:03.520 --> 2:16:06.480]  so i and my dad told me that growing up he said you got to watch the little
[2:16:06.480 --> 2:16:09.760]  thugs you got to watch the little local boss hogs
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:13.280]  and and that's true they're the ones that are scared of you see because i can
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:16.400]  i can take on haze county and probably get a lot of them in jail
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:19.840]  so they're dangerous i can take on travis county in austin
[2:16:19.840 --> 2:16:23.280]  that's why in my own backyard i don't mess with the locals too much
[2:16:23.280 --> 2:16:25.680]  i still expose them in things but i'm not out
[2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:28.800]  charging in to mess with the locals because they're the type that'll give
[2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:33.040]  you cement shoes does that make sense right
[2:16:33.040 --> 2:16:36.800]  well let me ask you like i heard you mentioned it back during the flu
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:40.640]  thing that there was an episode of alex baldwin show that came out in
[2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:46.160]  january entitled flu shot that was all about flu shots and
[2:16:46.160 --> 2:16:50.880]  uh you know making the you think you needed to get one and all this stuff
[2:16:50.880 --> 2:16:56.080]  and you recently had posted the old archie bunker from 72 talking about
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:17:00.240]  gun control and all all this conditioning and predictive
[2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:05.840]  programming coming out in shows and movies how do you think they are how
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:09.680]  do they in how do they insert so many things like
[2:17:09.680 --> 2:17:13.360]  that into shows and i mean how without people
[2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:17.600]  without it you know people know and about don't i mean especially back in the
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:22.000]  70s and 80s there might have been a hundred major or less tv producers i
[2:17:22.000 --> 2:17:25.280]  mean each producer would you know have like 2030 shows
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:29.280]  and they're 20 30 years in the business and they had a handful of writers they
[2:17:29.280 --> 2:17:32.800]  use and they have a world view and the cia admits
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:36.800]  going back to the 30s when they were os s they were their planning stories and
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:39.760]  i've i've had the lone gunman star dean hanglin on
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:44.160]  saying the cia planted stories on them planted the
[2:17:44.160 --> 2:17:47.360]  fly hijacked jets in the world trade center use a government drill to make
[2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:50.320]  norad stand down the government's going to do it but going to use an anti
[2:17:50.320 --> 2:17:54.720]  terror drill as the cover that's how they really launch attack 77
[2:17:54.720 --> 2:18:00.720]  9 11 1993 world trade center bombing uh but they don't have total control or
[2:18:00.720 --> 2:18:04.480]  total dominance i know i'm good i know i'm for real
[2:18:04.480 --> 2:18:08.640]  i know i'm affecting change and you know as a lone wolf you're good
[2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:10.960]  and so you need to become a leader and take action
[2:18:10.960 --> 2:18:14.560]  and in that you know that you're having an effect and then
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:18.480]  as we wake up the elite and as we wake up the middle class as we wake up
[2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:22.720]  and as we become the dominant force in society we have to be ready for victory
[2:18:22.720 --> 2:18:25.840]  as well people people think we can't have victory they think
[2:18:25.840 --> 2:18:29.840]  if we ever have success it must be staged the truth is the elite want to
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:33.040]  make you think everything stays and we have no power because they know how much
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:36.640]  power we really got i mean i appreciate your call sir i'm not

[2:24:45.280 --> 2:24:48.960]  as an architect or an engineer you're going up to
[2:24:48.960 --> 2:24:53.360]  give a presentation what else were you gonna add well just the central part of
[2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:56.880]  my presentation is to demand for the plans especially
[2:24:56.880 --> 2:25:00.800]  wtc seven i know there was some early plans for wct
[2:25:00.800 --> 2:25:04.960]  wtc one and two that were released but those weren't final plans
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:08.720]  signed and stamped by an engineer those were preliminary plans which left a lot
[2:25:08.720 --> 2:25:13.200]  of critical dimensions uh unspecific at that time which also they're being very
[2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:16.960]  secretive about building sevens plans after fema took it over
[2:25:16.960 --> 2:25:20.800]  and built the command bunker within it that was a spook house they blew up that
[2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:24.640]  day oh yeah yeah it was loaded with all kinds of
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:29.360]  stuff laundry list of stuff to uh department of defense nsa fbi
[2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:34.960]  cia irs the whole thing giant spook command base
[2:25:34.960 --> 2:25:38.400]  yeah that's right well let me get to this event it is going to be in plaino
[2:25:38.400 --> 2:25:42.880]  texas it's saturday uh july 11th and it's
[2:25:42.880 --> 2:25:47.920]  going to be at a at a campus you can get more information at north texas911truth.com
[2:25:47.920 --> 2:25:51.520]  i'm going to open up the point of finite element analysis
[2:25:51.520 --> 2:25:55.520]  with uh with the plans or without the plans we can still recreate the
[2:25:55.520 --> 2:26:00.320]  situation and kind of highlight the unviability of a
[2:26:00.320 --> 2:26:05.680]  freefall collapse uh senator the symmetrical gravity driven
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:08.800]  collapse that pulverized up and let molten metal
[2:26:08.800 --> 2:26:13.200]  fit for six weeks or so absolutely i gotta jump man good to hear from you
[2:26:13.200 --> 2:26:16.800]  derrick fred infilla you're on the air welcome
[2:26:16.800 --> 2:26:21.440]  i wanted to talk about the uh the economic cartel
[2:26:21.440 --> 2:26:27.840]  uh you have uh as uh as kevin was mentioning you have the agricultural
[2:26:27.840 --> 2:26:32.160]  cartel you have the uh all the other ones he mentioned
[2:26:32.160 --> 2:26:37.360]  but there's a there's a monetary cartel that has to do with the gold
[2:26:37.360 --> 2:26:42.080]  uh we we know that the markets are manipulated
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:49.120]  by the use of planted stories on the sentiment of the traders
[2:26:49.120 --> 2:26:53.680]  uh people are told that there is no reason for
[2:26:53.680 --> 2:26:58.480]  uh uh panic in a particular event and though therefore the price of gold may
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:04.480]  drift downward uh it is uh if no one is participating
[2:27:04.480 --> 2:27:07.520]  in these markets except a few powerful people
[2:27:07.520 --> 2:27:12.480]  then that allows for the uh social psychology to come in
[2:27:12.480 --> 2:27:16.400]  and that in in addition to the uh selling of gold
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:21.360]  suppresses the price of gold so we have an economic cartel
[2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:28.640]  uh and you have a uh uh a long term uh phasing out of the dollar my
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:33.680]  question to you alex is what do you think the reaction of
[2:27:33.680 --> 2:27:37.200]  uh the american people will be when they're told
[2:27:37.200 --> 2:27:41.360]  that they're going to have to get get out of the dollar they're going to be
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:47.360]  facing in a new currency and as a result they're going to be
[2:27:47.360 --> 2:27:52.640]  uh uh basically governed from abroad well they're already telling them that
[2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:56.320]  in time magazine and newsweek and everywhere else so
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:27:59.760]  that's the process but they frame it as this is the solution to the economic
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:02.480]  crisis is to accept these international bankers that
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:05.600]  engineered the crisis but they're the experts that know how to fix it give
[2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:09.040]  them unlimited power over your nation state and they'll fix it
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:12.000]  and then uh there's several different plans they're debating and pushing because
[2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:15.840]  they always give you a few false choices uh but it all comes from the same
[2:28:15.840 --> 2:28:20.000]  group so either way they win and you know we cover
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:25.760]  this actually in the obama deception but how they're laying it out is really
[2:28:25.760 --> 2:28:29.440]  simple uh they're saying they're going to have a world authority that sets
[2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:32.640]  currency rates sets currency values that sets
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:36.320]  interest rates with complete control by this private group they're already
[2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:39.600]  steering things and bending the world to their will
[2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:43.040]  but they've got to keep control of county cities the feds the states
[2:28:43.040 --> 2:28:46.880]  the association of governors you know i mean it's quite a
[2:28:46.880 --> 2:28:50.240]  balancing act a juggling act they're doing that's why with this new global
[2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:53.600]  authority for their quote administrative convenience today
[2:28:53.600 --> 2:28:56.240]  a Rockefeller has said a global government for their
[2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:00.160]  can administrative convenience this will allow them
[2:29:00.160 --> 2:29:05.440]  uh a lot more control and so at first they're just going to be
[2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:10.000]  dictating the regional currencies so you'll already have a global currency
[2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.800]  because they're going to be in control of it they're going to be in a
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:17.200]  centralized global level planning it and setting it all up
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:20.320]  but then they are debating whether to phase it in
[2:29:20.320 --> 2:29:26.080]  with different regional currencies like the amaro the euro uh the asian phoenix
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:28.160]  and others and that's even been in money magazine
[2:29:28.160 --> 2:29:32.320]  or bypass all that completely and even if you have
[2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:36.400]  cash it'll be digitally marked to your face scan in your thumb print
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:39.760]  and the new global cashless society is the biometric
[2:29:39.760 --> 2:29:43.920]  identifier and so everybody's kind of worried about global currencies
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:47.440]  that's really a red herring they're they're planning to leapfrog
[2:29:47.440 --> 2:29:51.680]  pass that to a new global standardized cashless society
[2:29:51.680 --> 2:29:55.600]  we're on the march the empires on the run

[2:35:01.440 --> 2:35:04.480]  kind of surprised not to see any headlines on infor's or printed planet
[2:35:04.480 --> 2:35:08.080]  printedplanet.com this morning about that i was really hoping that you could go
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:11.600]  into that yeah like i said people

[2:35:34.960 --> 2:35:39.040]  that and i you know i did mention that the supreme court and i did say that was
[2:35:39.040 --> 2:35:42.880]  coming up uh but paul watson and curt both wrote

[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:39.680]  harass us and demand to audit things and bureaucrats stomping around like they
[2:40:39.680 --> 2:40:43.600]  own the own everything and i'm a slave and and and and and you know dealing
[2:40:43.600 --> 2:40:47.920]  with dirty tricks people are pulling and dealing with you know
[2:40:47.920 --> 2:40:51.280]  the power getting turned off at my house because i forget to pay a bill
[2:40:51.280 --> 2:40:57.040]  i mean i am a regular guy folks and just to get control of my life i've had to
[2:40:57.040 --> 2:40:59.600]  stop doing as many radio interviews i turned down two or three interviews a
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:02.400]  day now and then those people never call back
[2:41:02.400 --> 2:41:05.920]  those are contacts that are dead because i turned them down
[2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:09.360]  they always get scorned because i don't see my children
[2:41:09.360 --> 2:41:12.400]  even two three hours a day unless i cancel these interviews i don't get the
[2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:16.240]  bills paid i don't deal with employees fighting with
[2:41:16.240 --> 2:41:20.240]  each other you know it's all the crap and i'm not complaining
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:24.320]  but i don't work at some big corporation i am info wars
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:28.480]  i deal with it all i deal with egomaniacs in this movement
[2:41:28.480 --> 2:41:31.280]  because all of society is mentally ill and very sick right now
[2:41:31.280 --> 2:41:35.200]  and very worldly constant attacks constant in fighting and i've learned
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:38.240]  just turn the other cheek take it even i'm not wrong
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:42.560]  i'm wrong just good i'll be the bad guy because we got to beat the new world
[2:41:42.560 --> 2:41:46.240]  order before they start world war three before they release a real super flu
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:50.960]  before they nuke a city this isn't a game this is real
[2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:54.000]  and a lot of you out there that are sucking your thumbs and knitting and
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:41:57.440]  engaging all the baloney as things get worse and worse
[2:41:57.440 --> 2:42:01.040]  you're going to wish you to take an action but we still have time to stop
[2:42:01.040 --> 2:42:04.960]  this if people grow up you got to get on the road though
[2:42:04.960 --> 2:42:09.440]  folks you're and again there is no neutral position here doing nothing
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:13.680]  is a decision doing nothing as consequences
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:17.520]  either join evil or join good but don't make excuses of your police or
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:20.640]  military or news people or or government bureaucrats
[2:42:20.640 --> 2:42:23.760]  you know this is evil you know things are getting worse you know there's
[2:42:23.760 --> 2:42:26.960]  corruption in place and a lot of people as they get scared
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:30.880]  they decide to join the evil they decide to do whatever they're told
[2:42:30.880 --> 2:42:34.720]  just to hold on a lot of times as things get worse some people wake up and
[2:42:34.720 --> 2:42:39.520]  take action but just as many throw themselves down before the
[2:42:39.520 --> 2:42:42.560]  evil they become buffaloed they roll over
[2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:46.560]  i'm not rolling over and i know i'm good i know i'm real
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:50.240]  i know i'm not perfect but i'm doing the best job i can
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:55.120]  i frustratedly get mad that my body gets tired i frustratedly get mad that
[2:42:55.120 --> 2:42:58.160]  that some days i don't want to work 14 15 16 hours a day
[2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:02.400]  because i know i'm this is a short life and i know we're facing pure evil and i
[2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:05.440]  don't have any you know uh
[2:43:05.440 --> 2:43:09.760]  diversions or delusions about that and i realize what we're facing
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.000]  and i realize more and more that fighting the new world order changing
[2:43:14.000 --> 2:43:18.320]  the system we live in is about an inside job like a don henley song says
[2:43:18.320 --> 2:43:22.800]  it's an inside job just like it always is i've got to change who i am you've got
[2:43:22.800 --> 2:43:25.920]  to change who you are you know it doesn't even hurt my feelings with
[2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:29.920]  somebody i've lifted up and built and promoted i mean i don't know if
[2:43:29.920 --> 2:43:33.520]  anybody except a very few people that haven't stabbed me in the back
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:36.800]  very few like a jason bermas a jack mclean a few others
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:41.120]  almost everyone is so obsessed with my success and my
[2:43:41.120 --> 2:43:44.640]  celebrity which is a curse really you know it's got the blessings because i can
[2:43:44.640 --> 2:43:48.560]  reach out and reach a lot of people but it has the curse in that man is so
[2:43:48.560 --> 2:43:53.120]  fallen and people are so petty that all these people i tried to build up and
[2:43:53.120 --> 2:43:57.120]  tried to give platforms they don't appreciate it they hate me for it
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:44:01.280]  when i was only looking for soldiers i was only looking for captains
[2:44:01.280 --> 2:44:05.520]  i was only looking for generals i was only looking for people to try to raise
[2:44:05.520 --> 2:44:10.560]  up as i was risen up by others to to to to be part of the big
[2:44:10.560 --> 2:44:14.240]  win against tyranny and you know it doesn't hurt me when i'm
[2:44:14.240 --> 2:44:18.160]  attacked it hurts me for them the megalomania the power
[2:44:18.160 --> 2:44:21.840]  trips and then i see in them myself i see in them
[2:44:21.840 --> 2:44:24.720]  what i've been in the past i see in them the mistakes i've made
[2:44:24.720 --> 2:44:30.720]  i see in them how how you know we all grow and and so then
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:35.120]  you can't even really hate them now the new world order i do really hate
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:38.240]  because they're conscious of what they're doing they understand human nature
[2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:41.760]  they understand wisdom and they've decided to bend that wisdom towards
[2:44:41.760 --> 2:44:45.360]  dominating innocent people and doing horrible things that hurt innocence and
[2:44:45.360 --> 2:44:49.360]  hurt beauty and hurt creativity and hurt the human spirit that's
[2:44:49.360 --> 2:44:53.120]  meant to be uplifted and grow and build things
[2:44:53.120 --> 2:44:57.600]  and i just really feel sad for those that are missing out on what life's really
[2:44:57.600 --> 2:45:01.520]  all about because i am discovering such fulfillment
[2:45:01.520 --> 2:45:06.160]  and uh
[2:45:06.160 --> 2:45:11.760]  i'm just changing as a person where where i almost enjoy taking the blame i
[2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:15.200]  almost enjoy being hated because i understand that that spirit of
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:20.640]  being humble uh you know is is is really not even
[2:45:20.640 --> 2:45:23.360]  the strongest spirit even though it is
[2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:27.360]  it's just that that's what i was meant to be that i'm home now
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:30.080]  you know i've always been a good-natured person like you know you say all that
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:34.480]  dog's a good-natured old dog i'm a sweet person
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:37.760]  and i i i always grew up thinking everybody was like me everybody was
[2:45:37.760 --> 2:45:41.200]  sweet and loving and had a big heart and they don't ladies and gentlemen
[2:45:41.200 --> 2:45:46.160]  we're a very sick society we're so cold-blooded we'll kill 51 million babies
[2:45:46.160 --> 2:45:50.960]  and counting and be proud of it and make excuses about it you know you can make
[2:45:50.960 --> 2:45:54.240]  excuses all day that's murder you can make excuses all day about the police
[2:45:54.240 --> 2:45:57.840]  turning into police state but we all know it is you can make excuses all day
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:02.640]  about the foreign bankers raping us and robbing us but we know it is
[2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:07.520]  um now let's call bermas in uh because uh the caller was talking about how he
[2:46:07.520 --> 2:46:10.720]  talked about it last night i saw this last night i actually printed it off
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:15.200]  drudge the caller was saying he bermas just ran off he was waiting to come in
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:22.800]  here um the uh yeah come on in how many times up
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:26.080]  the caller's saying he can't find it let me let me read to you the headline
[2:46:26.080 --> 2:46:32.000]  supreme court rules police can initiate suspects questioning
[2:46:32.000 --> 2:46:35.040]  and it says by a five four vote the conservative majority they're not
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:38.720]  conservatives overhaul a 23 year old supreme court decision
[2:46:38.720 --> 2:46:42.240]  that barred the police from initiating questioning after a defendant
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:46.800]  has heard of the right to an attorney and an arraignment or similar proceeding
[2:46:46.800 --> 2:46:49.920]  see because the police were so corrupt in the 70s and stuff and all this happened
[2:46:49.920 --> 2:46:54.640]  that they you know they passed laws and had rulings that the police just can't
[2:46:54.640 --> 2:46:57.120]  say because they put a gun to your head or intimidated you that you said you
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:02.000]  committed the murder or whatever in 1986 decision held that once a defendant
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:05.600]  invoked a right to counsel only the suspect and not the police can initiate
[2:47:05.600 --> 2:47:10.080]  the contact that's saying don't start interrogations on people
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:13.520]  without people's counsel and that goes back to the bill of rights a constitution
[2:47:13.520 --> 2:47:16.560]  that would be conservative would be to keep that
[2:47:16.560 --> 2:47:21.200]  see and it goes on expanding the power of police to question suspects but it
[2:47:21.200 --> 2:47:24.400]  does not change the landmark 66 ruling barring the
[2:47:24.400 --> 2:47:28.720]  police from questioning a suspect who invoked the right to remain silent or
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:32.080]  have a lawyer present initially waived his right to a lawyer and was
[2:47:32.080 --> 2:47:35.600]  questioned by the police he told several conflicting stories several days
[2:47:35.600 --> 2:47:39.040]  later he appeared in court preliminary hearing and told local judge appointed
[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:42.400]  a lawyer to represent him who could not afford an attorney and how this works is
[2:47:42.400 --> 2:47:46.080]  they say look at these criminals we know we need to get tough on them but you get
[2:47:46.080 --> 2:47:50.640]  nazi germany you get soviet russia you take people's due process and their
[2:47:50.640 --> 2:47:54.240]  protections away you get a tyranny which is always the greatest threat to
[2:47:54.240 --> 2:47:58.240]  liberty throughout history so the founders knew to protect that it sounds
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:02.080]  crazy the way the media advertises it the way they act but but but really we
[2:48:02.080 --> 2:48:06.400]  need these and better ten guilty men to go free than one innocent man go to
[2:48:06.400 --> 2:48:09.920]  prison now the attitude the feds have said oh it doesn't matter of around the
[2:48:09.920 --> 2:48:13.520]  country you know over a third of the people on death row are totally innocent
[2:48:13.520 --> 2:48:18.640]  or maybe half you know a few innocent people are going to go to the lethal
[2:48:18.640 --> 2:48:23.360]  injection so that we are all safe see that's napoleonic that's tyranny
[2:48:23.360 --> 2:48:28.160]  that's the flip side the opposite of of the renaissance of the magna
[2:48:28.160 --> 2:48:34.400]  cart of mosaic law of freedom but we we we did pull up a cornell law university
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:39.280]  they're saying it doesn't quite get rid of you being able to say i'm not talking
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:43.760]  to you till i see my attorney it's it's it's saying if the police can trick you
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:48.640]  to talk they can now use it as admissible but it is a pretty big deal jason
[2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:51.600]  your comments on yeah you know it really fired me up alex i couldn't believe it
[2:48:51.600 --> 2:48:54.480]  because now the cops are just going to say oh he said he didn't need a lawyer
[2:48:54.480 --> 2:48:57.920]  you know it's going to be the cops word against yours when they interrogate you
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:00.080]  and it's going to be well it's like ruling saying you don't have a fourth
[2:49:00.080 --> 2:49:03.280]  amendment now yeah yeah and then on top of that they always make it look like it
[2:49:03.280 --> 2:49:07.760]  was so close oh it's five to four almost the last time we saw a nine to zero or
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:12.000]  a seven to two ruling it's always five to four oh we were this close to keeping
[2:49:12.000 --> 2:49:15.360]  your civil liberties oh but the liberals are protecting you they want to ban your
[2:49:15.360 --> 2:49:18.960]  free speech but they'll allow you to not have to answer questions it's all a
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:23.600]  dog and pony show exactly and i was just so upset i can't believe that if i get
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:27.600]  you know pulled over detained and i say i'm not talking to you until i get my
[2:49:27.600 --> 2:49:30.880]  lawyer here they'll just be like okay and just you know throw me to the side
[2:49:30.880 --> 2:49:33.760]  maybe hit me with a baton oh he came in with you know they already do that i
[2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:36.640]  know a lot of people get thrown in jail for months without lawyer yeah exactly
[2:49:36.640 --> 2:49:39.840]  they don't know that's happening on paper you know that's the problem they're
[2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:43.200]  making a supreme court decision about it yes our police corrupt yes have they
[2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:46.480]  done this before yes but now they're saying it's okay police you can get away
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:52.320]  with this now hey what about uh la raza mecha member of the new supreme court
[2:49:52.320 --> 2:49:57.760]  nominee uh i mean this lady has come right out here's her quote i would hope
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:02.720]  that a wise latina woman with the richness of her experiences
[2:50:02.720 --> 2:50:06.800]  would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male
[2:50:06.800 --> 2:50:10.480]  hasn't lived that life and and there's and that's what judge said this is out
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:15.360]  of the new york times uh said and it goes on and she's a member of la raza
[2:50:15.360 --> 2:50:17.840]  and there's even more disturbing quote on the third page but you know what la
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:20.960]  raza means it means for our race everything for those outside the race
[2:50:20.960 --> 2:50:24.080]  nothing folks i don't care if you're hispanic or whatever
[2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:28.320]  i'm sick of the fact that a massive percentage
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:32.080]  of hispanics have been filled with this idea
[2:50:32.080 --> 2:50:36.000]  that get the gringos ha ha our race is the god grace when we had the
[2:50:36.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  mayor here he had ozlonday and said we are the
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:44.240]  super race and it says whether born from experience or inherent psychological
[2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:48.080]  or cultural differences she said for jurists who are women and non-white
[2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:52.400]  our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging
[2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:56.000]  so yeah this is like a commissar who's going to inject
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:00.400]  race into this this is what creates the racism folks stay there Jason

[3:00:18.960 --> 3:00:24.320]  uh tori and nick we come back in the next segment
[3:00:24.320 --> 3:00:27.600]  then i got one of the c-think producers and directors coming on
[3:00:27.600 --> 3:00:30.880]  because he's got a lot of heat for myself included
[3:00:30.880 --> 3:00:34.320]  uh dealing with the c-think film new order that's just a huge success it's
[3:00:34.320 --> 3:00:38.080]  got a lot of attention top ratings record ratings last night
[3:00:38.080 --> 3:00:41.920]  for i fc and record now most i'm not supposed to get into that but it's
[3:00:41.920 --> 3:00:45.840]  hundreds of thousands on the on demand just get dwarf anything they've
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:49.920]  ever seen uh so uh obviously i'll have my new
[3:00:49.920 --> 3:00:54.880]  i fc tv show no i could have had those kind of things a long time ago but who
[3:00:54.880 --> 3:00:59.040]  knows i might actually do one uh the issue here is that i'm going to keep
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:03.120]  doing this radio show that's where we can do everything unedited uncut and
[3:01:03.120 --> 3:01:06.720]  really get everything out but they say i fc is the place where
[3:01:06.720 --> 3:01:11.520]  always uncut so the perfect for me huh uh the point is is that
[3:01:11.520 --> 3:01:15.760]  there's no doubt we'll knock it out of the park either way you slice it
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:20.000]  uh erin you had some uh interesting news you know hundreds of documents have
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:23.680]  come out the last few years smuggled out out of national archives in europe
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:27.840]  where the bill berg group was set up by kind of the nazi money in the in the
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:30.720]  british us money teaming up to set up world government
[3:01:30.720 --> 3:01:33.920]  they brag they covertly set up the european union 50 years before they
[3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:36.560]  admitted it we're already under the north american union the public doesn't
[3:01:36.560 --> 3:01:40.160]  know we have the secret treaty people sued and got a judicial watch did
[3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:43.680]  more documents keep coming out one of our listeners did a great article
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:47.600]  breaking one of these down and we've separately vetted that ourselves and
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:50.880]  checked it so it is accurate and yet the end avenue on is now giving
[3:01:50.880 --> 3:01:53.360]  interviews in the european press they had a bill berger going yeah
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:57.360]  we really run things so they've gotten to the point where they're just ready to
[3:01:57.360 --> 3:02:01.200]  throw it in everybody's face yeah and at the end of an on admitted they created
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:04.880]  the euro you know what was it 55 years before something
[3:02:04.880 --> 3:02:08.640]  and now we have more documents that some of our great dutch listeners have dug
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:12.800]  up uh a guy named hr nord known as mr europe
[3:02:12.800 --> 3:02:16.240]  calling for a federation of europe let's give that rider credit that
[3:02:16.240 --> 3:02:19.920]  yeah it's uh urian mason our jury and mason
[3:02:19.920 --> 3:02:22.640]  not sure i've heard he's raising you know you're written a lot of great stuff
[3:02:22.640 --> 3:02:25.360]  for us we commend him uh so continue with that
[3:02:25.360 --> 3:02:29.680]  yeah he's calling for uh world government through european federation
[3:02:29.680 --> 3:02:32.560]  only as an intermediate step for world government
[3:02:32.560 --> 3:02:36.000]  uh you know they're always attacking the league of nations it wasn't strong
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:39.680]  enough because some national sovereignty remains read the article
[3:02:39.680 --> 3:02:43.600]  and they're calling for the end of all sovereignty in a series of pamphlets
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:47.440]  constructed in the latter days of the german occupation of the european
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:52.800]  continent for the dutch deb bond breaker magazine pioneer magazine
[3:02:52.800 --> 3:02:56.240]  one of the founders of the european parliament hr nord
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:00.400]  nicknamed mr europe wrote that all european countries should prepare
[3:03:00.400 --> 3:03:03.440]  to construct a european federation as a first step
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:08.640]  in the direction of a world government when by the end of 1944 became clear the
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:12.400]  nazis were doomed in their conquest for world domination
[3:03:12.400 --> 3:03:15.520]  with two impatient superpowers waiting in the rings
[3:03:15.520 --> 3:03:19.280]  nor elaborated on this idea in a three-part series explaining
[3:03:19.280 --> 3:03:22.880]  that steps towards a world government should be pursued to rid the world
[3:03:22.880 --> 3:03:27.520]  once and for all of a future german aspiration for world domination
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:30.400]  and it goes but it's germany at the heart of europe
[3:03:30.400 --> 3:03:34.000]  oh we want this government so we don't dominate but that's actually
[3:03:34.000 --> 3:03:38.080]  what dominates europe uh and that's what the builderberg is is that nexus
[3:03:38.080 --> 3:03:41.360]  of that germanic empire with the anglo-american thing that's germanic
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:45.200]  to begin with with the roth child's kind of wrapped around an inner bread into
[3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:50.560]  the middle of a very sickening uh concoction but the separate
[3:03:50.560 --> 3:03:53.280]  declassified army documents say this but i've read
[3:03:53.280 --> 3:03:57.440]  uh shires rise and fall the third rite hind's hobbles order the death set and
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:04:01.600]  scores of other encyclopedic books off mainline documents but you never see
[3:04:01.600 --> 3:04:05.200]  this on the news that hitler planned a european union
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:09.120]  to govern the planet and then carry out eugenics and he got the model from the
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:12.480]  us in england and they set him up and cut
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:16.400]  his legs out from under him it was all a big setup because they wanted to do it
[3:04:16.400 --> 3:04:20.960]  with a soft kill mode but now separate dutch documents confirm it
[3:04:20.960 --> 3:04:25.200]  but this is mainline history yeah in the name of hitler they're going to burn
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:28.960]  the power of the german people and then pursue the ultimate plans anyway
[3:04:28.960 --> 3:04:32.560]  world government in the name of stopping another hitler
[3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:37.600]  yeah it's ridiculous but notice that that is a systematic all it's like a dark
[3:04:37.600 --> 3:04:41.120]  uh uh you know almost you know fourth fifth
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:44.400]  dimensional and by that i mean the level of thinking is so complex
[3:04:44.400 --> 3:04:48.640]  uh philosophy or or or or english they put on like a cute
[3:04:48.640 --> 3:04:53.920]  on a ball and in pool you know the way they do things and it works so well

[3:08:09.840 --> 3:08:12.960]  okay we're going to your calls here in just uh in a momento
[3:08:12.960 --> 3:08:17.600]  but but right now uh finish up your story about the european union
[3:08:17.600 --> 3:08:23.120]  and what it was really set up to be well once again we got exclusive documents
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:27.200]  from 1945 translated out of dutch by some of our great listeners
[3:08:27.200 --> 3:08:31.040]  and so yeah this is an exclusive at info wars dot com oh absolutely
[3:08:31.040 --> 3:08:34.800]  and it's just another piece of the riddle that national sovereignty can't exist
[3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:37.200]  anymore because there's terrible people in the world
[3:08:37.200 --> 3:08:40.720]  so we have to have some you know authoritarian
[3:08:40.720 --> 3:08:44.720]  union worldwide to uh control us all it doesn't make any sense
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:48.240]  so the elite can really start waging war with eugenics on their real target the
[3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:52.560]  people which the wars have always been as orwell wrote the wars are set up by
[3:08:52.560 --> 3:08:57.600]  the elites to suppress their own population kim jong il gets uh a reprieve
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:09:01.440]  from overthrow with the sabre rattling the west gets to look like good guys
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:05.440]  setting themselves up against him south korea gets to take more freedoms
[3:09:05.440 --> 3:09:08.560]  see how it works perfectly for them yeah and they knew the league of nations
[3:09:08.560 --> 3:09:11.840]  wouldn't be strong enough for the desires they knew the united nations
[3:09:11.840 --> 3:09:15.280]  didn't have the teeth they wanted but they by integrating well they
[3:09:15.280 --> 3:09:18.480]  orchestrated both those wars yeah but they knew it was
[3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:23.280]  uh you know one step after another to this takeover this worldwide takeover
[3:09:23.280 --> 3:09:27.360]  and they're shoveling us into this dictatorship worldwide dictatorship
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:30.960]  first through europe then through a greater region it's it's in all these
[3:09:30.960 --> 3:09:34.000]  articles every time they come up and now they admit they want a world government
[3:09:34.000 --> 3:09:37.760]  run by them there's no board denial but bloomberg comes out and says i'm
[3:09:37.760 --> 3:09:40.080]  totally insane there's no haliburton fema camps
[3:09:40.080 --> 3:09:42.720]  that matter it's in the new york times in houston chronicle
[3:09:42.720 --> 3:09:46.080]  uh i'm totally crazy there was no secret service at bill deberg we was
[3:09:46.080 --> 3:09:50.480]  were literal schizophrenics erin running around just delusion only
[3:09:50.480 --> 3:09:53.920]  isn't that going to backfire on the media yeah a year and a half ago bill deberg
[3:09:53.920 --> 3:09:57.760]  doesn't exist now um davin yon and others are admitting they've been
[3:09:57.760 --> 3:10:01.760]  planning it since at least 1955 why do you think they're going public now
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:03.520]  because we exposed them and so they're just gonna
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:07.440]  hide in plain view and act like it's no big deal or more or less yeah
[3:10:07.440 --> 3:10:10.560]  but that's a good question i mean what i mean you know first i told the public
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:14.240]  oh there's no ruling elite there's no corrupt elite your police are locally
[3:10:14.240 --> 3:10:18.080]  run and the 14.8 trillions for your children
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:21.280]  and i mean now it's just hey martial law if you don't like it we're gonna kill
[3:10:21.280 --> 3:10:25.040]  you i mean you know it's just it's so pathetic erin
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:29.280]  once you get into tyranny historically there's only a few degrees separation
[3:10:29.280 --> 3:10:33.680]  till you're in the worst form of tyranny people don't realize we're now here
[3:10:33.680 --> 3:10:37.040]  yeah and national sovereignty has no place apparently
[3:10:37.040 --> 3:10:40.400]  according to this guy in 1945 according to richard haas
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:43.520]  and what is the mindset of these elites i'm going to cover this after we take
[3:10:43.520 --> 3:10:46.800]  calls one benefit of poor economic countries lower
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:51.760]  co2 emissions uh this is out of the examiner
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:10:55.600]  and uh four states adopt no smile policies for driver's license
[3:10:55.600 --> 3:10:58.960]  we we we linked to this story on info wars they were commenting with the
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:01.600]  quotes out of 1984 where you weren't supposed to smile
[3:11:01.600 --> 3:11:04.960]  because that could be seen as obnoxious and now you can't smile on a facial
[3:11:04.960 --> 3:11:08.000]  recognition right yeah because they want you well they don't tell the slaves in
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:10.800]  usa today that that we're not getting your proper
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:15.040]  face scan but yes that's it it's incredible
[3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:18.560]  doesn't somebody call it the worldwide straight jacket for your own good you
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:21.040]  can't do anything you can't have any sovereignty
[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:24.080]  you know for the benefit and they're trying now to tell the poor
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:27.200]  in fact it's somewhere around here where did that pamphlet go ahead and here
[3:11:27.200 --> 3:11:31.120]  that cps gave one of my employees and tried to steal her eight-year-old
[3:11:31.120 --> 3:11:34.320]  where is it is it here in the stack i wanted to show that on air sometime
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:37.520]  it says yelling at your child they'll take them
[3:11:37.520 --> 3:11:41.040]  there's no law there's no i mean these people are criminals
[3:11:41.040 --> 3:11:46.640]  but no smiling either and now they're going to turn bureaucrats loose on us on
[3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:49.520]  our own land i just can't handle it i can't believe you know
[3:11:49.520 --> 3:11:52.480]  you people think it's fun living the sub union it's not going to be fun

[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:04.320]  in your mind when is that it's about to happen

[3:13:08.240 --> 3:13:11.600]  yeah that's why i was saying last year i might go because that's only about
[3:13:11.600 --> 3:13:15.040]  eight hours from where i'm at yeah i just wanted to remind you of it
[3:13:15.040 --> 3:13:18.880]  and uh i know this is a long shot but uh after the gathering me and my girlfriend
[3:13:18.880 --> 3:13:21.600]  we're moving to austin and i would volunteer to work for you for your
[3:13:21.600 --> 3:13:24.320]  charge brother well the problem is we don't
[3:13:24.320 --> 3:13:27.760]  and i and i appreciate that if you want to write articles or volunteer spread the
[3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:30.240]  word like that it's just we have a small operation
[3:13:30.240 --> 3:13:34.000]  and we turn down most volunteers because i just can't handle being infiltrated
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:37.600]  and that's who they try to put in here i mean it's bad they try they try to come
[3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:40.400]  in here and commit crimes and then say we did it
[3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:44.320]  um kind of some miracle i'm not in prison already
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:47.760]  and uh that's why i've turned out all these great people
[3:13:47.760 --> 3:13:50.560]  also i can't respond everybody's emails folks are always getting mags i don't
[3:13:50.560 --> 3:13:54.240]  respond to people's emails or calls i'm overwhelmed and i'm not whining
[3:13:54.240 --> 3:14:00.000]  i'm just making that statement rob do saying he wants volunteers
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:03.600]  yeah but see i kind of pick people myself i go out and
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:08.000]  put a nondescript ad in and then find people but the problem is everybody i
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:10.560]  end up in austin interviewing ends up already their listeners
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:14.560]  i say we're so big i mean really i've always tried to play down how big we
[3:14:14.560 --> 3:14:17.680]  are because i don't like the jealousy flaring up and people going nuts because
[3:14:17.680 --> 3:14:20.960]  it becomes destructive but i mean there's no point in covering it up anymore
[3:14:20.960 --> 3:14:25.040]  we're huge folks i mean huge and just exponentially
[3:14:25.040 --> 3:14:29.680]  growing and i and i'm just thanking my lucky stars every day
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:33.440]  leo en masse leo you're on the air welcome
[3:14:33.440 --> 3:14:40.000]  hi thank you for taking the call yeah i was the uh that funny guy who um
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:46.000]  was taking a picture of by um your man with the little hat up in lexington
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:50.160]  anyway uh without belaboring the obvious um
[3:14:50.160 --> 3:14:55.200]  i think what i'm gonna say is in the reign of captain kirk and the character
[3:14:55.200 --> 3:15:00.080]  that whoopie guldberg played remember that i didn't watch a lot of star trek
[3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:02.720]  next generation but i think i remember she was in the show yeah
[3:15:02.720 --> 3:15:06.160]  yeah and she was the wise wasn't she like a counselor or something
[3:15:06.160 --> 3:15:09.760]  yeah yeah a fountain of wisdom could you could you
[3:15:09.760 --> 3:15:16.400]  ask your buddies who you trust to judge to listen to your show again and count
[3:15:16.400 --> 3:15:20.320]  the time that you spend belaboring the obvious now
[3:15:20.320 --> 3:15:23.760]  i know you want to get the dumb downers in too
[3:15:23.760 --> 3:15:27.360]  but those of us who aren't in the dumb downer crowd which are
[3:15:27.360 --> 3:15:32.240]  quite a few of your listeners would kind of appreciate it if you could
[3:15:32.240 --> 3:15:36.240]  just cut it a little bit so that we can get to the meat anyway that's one of
[3:15:36.240 --> 3:15:39.200]  the issues but the really important issue is i think that
[3:15:39.200 --> 3:15:43.120]  with the bermus on i think what you need to fill in
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:46.480]  is to have some kind of an older wiser woman like
[3:15:46.480 --> 3:15:51.680]  nancy levante or some some interesting woman to take up the time in between
[3:15:51.680 --> 3:15:57.520]  your show and bermus's show and another thing is i want to see the
[3:15:57.520 --> 3:16:02.000]  a section on all of your sites called in their own words
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:06.320]  and so that you could challenge people to um
[3:16:06.320 --> 3:16:10.480]  make a case and with money involved put it put some money some up there
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:14.000]  with all the documents of these people admitting upfront what they're doing
[3:16:14.000 --> 3:16:17.520]  see people don't believe it but you put money down
[3:16:17.520 --> 3:16:20.960]  on the truth and they're going to be chasing it
[3:16:20.960 --> 3:16:24.000]  and then they'll find out it's the truth you see this is how to get it through
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:27.280]  like i think we don't quite understand the methodology i mean the problem with
[3:16:27.280 --> 3:16:32.960]  methodology is this i did a road test of a market test of these nice
[3:16:32.960 --> 3:16:36.960]  young white people who were helping at a
[3:16:36.960 --> 3:16:40.720]  at a food pantry and i said how many of you have heard about
[3:16:40.720 --> 3:16:47.120]  the baxter flu release of live flu to 14 18 countries and was caught in chuck
[3:16:47.120 --> 3:16:52.080]  lasovakia and the ferrets died now this is the bad part
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:55.520]  only well they probably thought you were crazy for just being able to talk and
[3:16:55.520 --> 3:16:59.200]  say the word pharmaceutical i mean people think it's showing off
[3:16:59.200 --> 3:17:02.640]  because they have reduced the language down so much they have
[3:17:02.640 --> 3:17:07.200]  brought in ink sock as your jarwell talked about where you try to talk to

[3:18:34.960 --> 3:18:39.600]  it's breaking out of your spell you know we got rave reviews for the obama
[3:18:39.600 --> 3:18:41.440]  deception it's the best seller we've ever had
[3:18:41.440 --> 3:18:44.800]  it's having a huge effect really funding our operation really reaching out to
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:47.840]  people but i did all get a minority of people saying
[3:18:47.840 --> 3:18:51.760]  i knew all this well the movie isn't for you
[3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:55.040]  it's for people that don't know the left right paradigms control and they play
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:57.760]  us off against each other it's people that don't know all this race stuff
[3:18:57.760 --> 3:19:00.160]  meant to play us off against each other it's people that don't know the
[3:19:00.160 --> 3:19:03.840]  trilateral commission and billderberg group cfr all run the presidents from
[3:19:03.840 --> 3:19:06.880]  their own admissions and quotes and we do have it in their own words
[3:19:06.880 --> 3:19:10.640]  it's for people that don't understand and it goes through
[3:19:10.640 --> 3:19:14.880]  how he's going to betray you and now he has so the film's even bigger
[3:19:14.880 --> 3:19:21.280]  obviously it's not for the choir now we do get into a lot of detailed analysis
[3:19:21.280 --> 3:19:25.600]  and a lot of deep stuff here but i also
[3:19:25.600 --> 3:19:29.200]  this show is successful not because we dumb it down but because we explain it
[3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:34.480]  in a historical perspective and we simplify it and then elaborate
[3:19:34.480 --> 3:19:39.200]  simplify then elaborate because this is like
[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:42.880]  chinese to the average american or it's greek driving along in their car they're
[3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:46.480]  like what's he talking about corrupt government i was told that didn't exist
[3:19:46.480 --> 3:19:49.440]  in history you show him that that's all that ever
[3:19:49.440 --> 3:19:52.400]  has existed he's going to get concerned and wake up
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:55.520]  or you take those that go i know it's bad but i can't do anything
[3:19:55.520 --> 3:19:59.360]  you teach him that they do have power and can do something stay with us more

[3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:13.920]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[3:21:13.920 --> 3:21:17.200]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:21:17.200 --> 3:21:20.400]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:24.880]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[3:21:24.880 --> 3:21:28.560]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:21:28.560 --> 3:21:32.880]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:21:32.880 --> 3:21:38.000]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:41.600]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:46.560]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[3:22:01.120 --> 3:22:04.160]  hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal
[3:22:04.160 --> 3:22:07.920]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with
[3:22:07.920 --> 3:22:11.200]  catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks have
[3:22:11.200 --> 3:22:14.560]  currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:17.280]  accounts a fractional reserve system means only a
[3:22:17.280 --> 3:22:20.720]  small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal
[3:22:20.720 --> 3:22:24.320]  deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to
[3:22:24.320 --> 3:22:28.000]  ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:31.680]  a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[3:22:31.680 --> 3:22:35.280]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[3:22:35.280 --> 3:22:38.640]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[3:22:38.640 --> 3:22:42.320]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative
[3:22:42.320 --> 3:22:46.640]  portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[3:22:46.640 --> 3:22:49.840]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt
[3:22:49.840 --> 3:22:53.200]  gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years
[3:22:53.200 --> 3:23:00.560]  for more information call 1-800-686-2237 that's 1-800-686-2237
[3:23:00.560 --> 3:23:04.320]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[3:23:04.320 --> 3:23:08.000]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:11.360]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:13.840]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:16.800]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could
[3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:20.160]  even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[3:23:20.160 --> 3:23:23.280]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[3:23:23.280 --> 3:23:26.720]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[3:23:26.720 --> 3:23:30.320]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family
[3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:34.000]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any
[3:23:34.000 --> 3:23:37.600]  way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:41.360]  garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:53.520]  gm says bondholder offer fails bankruptcy looms
[3:24:53.520 --> 3:24:57.200]  that's the type of news that we have here is the feds take that over with your
[3:24:57.200 --> 3:25:02.320]  tax money 19.4 billion in loans so gm can move
[3:25:02.320 --> 3:25:05.920]  its main principal operations to china and brazil
[3:25:05.920 --> 3:25:08.880]  and that's on record they are moving to china and brazil and will
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:13.280]  manufacture what the government says talk about power the few gm factories or
[3:25:13.280 --> 3:25:16.960]  jobs that stay here will now be dictated by the federal government
[3:25:16.960 --> 3:25:22.480]  i mean this is uh this is the end my friend of the free republic unless we
[3:25:22.480 --> 3:25:25.120]  use their attack as a way to wake people up and say no to it
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:28.480]  but that's why they want economic implosion is to terrorize the public
[3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:31.360]  into going along with them i just want to spend three or four minutes with them
[3:25:31.360 --> 3:25:34.080]  we got a guest popping in for 10 minutes then more of your calls
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:36.480]  i wanted to bring jim newcomer up because he hadn't been on in a few days
[3:25:36.480 --> 3:25:41.760]  with us gold has been flat at 9559
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:46.640]  60 or so the last few days it's been holding up though at that amount
[3:25:46.640 --> 3:25:51.440]  and they're at the very very tail end of some of that gold ted got four weeks
[3:25:51.440 --> 3:25:56.080]  ago four weeks ago at the 880 level and he factors that into what he sells it
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:26:00.160]  they're at the very end of some of the francs some of the uh sovereigns some of
[3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:03.760]  the other golds going up but still is the best deal out there in the industry
[3:26:03.760 --> 3:26:09.280]  they still have the silver at the insane price with those uh
[3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:12.880]  franklin half dollars i don't know about the Lakota's i didn't ask him
[3:26:12.880 --> 3:26:16.960]  jim newcomer give us the mightest resources specials of the day
[3:26:16.960 --> 3:26:21.520]  okay alex is uh be glad to the uh 20 our liberty the vf uh the private gold
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:27.520]  pre-33 is at 1627 the ten dollar that's the half ounce coin is at 799
[3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:30.400]  we do have the Lakota silver but that price had to go up
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:33.840]  that's at 2050 now or 410 dollars a roll
[3:26:33.840 --> 3:26:38.080]  it's people have still been calling in buying it silver really offers a
[3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:42.560]  a great opportunity here uh the franklin half dollars are at 880
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:47.200]  or 176 dollars a roll and now to explain to people
[3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:50.560]  that's basically what you buy them for you're not going to find these anywhere
[3:26:50.560 --> 3:26:55.280]  near that the way silvers moved up still 880 how long till those run out because
[3:26:55.280 --> 3:26:59.440]  most those other deals have run out well uh when ted gets back he's going to
[3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:02.240]  talk to him i don't know how many he secured at that price but
[3:27:02.240 --> 3:27:06.160]  we did run out of the original we did have to go out and acquire more
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:09.520]  uh and our costs went up on it fairly significantly but we're doing our best
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:12.800]  to hold these prices down so that everybody can get involved
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:16.160]  it's important that they do you know you talked about the world events and
[3:27:16.160 --> 3:27:19.600]  things that's this world's about to just explode here
[3:27:19.600 --> 3:27:23.040]  and that's going to put a lot a lot of pressure on the metals
[3:27:23.040 --> 3:27:28.560]  but we do have the sovereigns at 278 90 and the francs at 225 90 if they're
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:31.440]  exceptional opportunities they're not going to get any cheaper
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:36.160]  so now folks give us a call here at 800 686 2237
[3:27:36.160 --> 3:27:40.560]  if you have any questions at all give us a call we have 25 brokers here so
[3:27:40.560 --> 3:27:44.240]  somebody will be here to answer your questions now jim newcomer what about
[3:27:44.240 --> 3:27:47.840]  the francs and the sovereigns am i correct in saying
[3:27:47.840 --> 3:27:51.360]  we're at the very end of those special deals or is that over to
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:55.040]  we well we we did have to raise the price on those slightly but ted's over
[3:27:55.040 --> 3:27:58.480]  there in europe now he's trying to secure a supply that's going to be able to
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:02.800]  let us drop the price on it but we won't know that until he gets back but we did
[3:28:02.800 --> 3:28:07.200]  have to we did have to rate it slightly through our current supplier
[3:28:07.200 --> 3:28:10.800]  yeah because you're having to buy it i mean so again how much for the francs
[3:28:10.800 --> 3:28:14.800]  how much for the sovereigns okay the sovereigns are at 278 90 that's a quarter
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:19.200]  ounce coin the francs are at 225 90 that's a fifth ounce coin
[3:28:19.200 --> 3:28:23.520]  that's 800 686 2237 great prices
[3:28:23.520 --> 3:28:28.720]  great prices on gold excellent prices amazing prices on silver especially
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:33.200]  those half dollars those silver half dollars 800
[3:28:33.200 --> 3:28:38.480]  686 2237 and you're selling those Lakota's for three four bucks under what
[3:28:38.480 --> 3:28:41.360]  almost everybody else that i've seen is selling them for
[3:28:41.360 --> 3:28:46.960]  so 800 686 2237 folks i believe in precious metals
[3:28:46.960 --> 3:28:50.240]  and to me they're a hedge against inflation they're they're
[3:28:50.240 --> 3:28:53.920]  they're a diversification they're an emergency backup plan but for people
[3:28:53.920 --> 3:28:56.640]  they're heavily invested in the stock market and annuities and
[3:28:56.640 --> 3:28:59.120]  all these things that aren't insured or even the banks
[3:28:59.120 --> 3:29:02.320]  you're really i think irresponsible if you don't look
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:06.000]  strongly at moving part of your assets into silver and gold today
[3:29:06.000 --> 3:29:09.120]  and the place to get it as modest resources that's where i get my precious
[3:29:09.120 --> 3:29:15.520]  metals 1 800 686 2237 800 686 2237

[3:33:36.320 --> 3:33:39.760]  we've got andrew neal one of the directors and producers
[3:33:39.760 --> 3:33:43.040]  of cthink that made the film new world order
[3:33:43.040 --> 3:33:46.880]  now i don't know how much i can say on air but it's
[3:33:46.880 --> 3:33:49.200]  it's one of the hottest things well i've been told the hottest thing they've
[3:33:49.200 --> 3:33:53.360]  ever had at i of c and we've seen the numbers on that
[3:33:53.360 --> 3:33:56.800]  very exciting i knew this would give us a lot of attention and that's the key
[3:33:56.800 --> 3:34:00.720]  breaking out getting attention people say oh well you'll be discredited by this
[3:34:00.720 --> 3:34:03.920]  or that you know it's a subtle film i mean
[3:34:03.920 --> 3:34:07.360]  there are kooky people in the alternative media movement because we're
[3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:09.920]  not some centralized monolithic mainstream media
[3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:14.480]  we're a billion different flavors and if people think that
[3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:17.680]  and i go back and forth on this but overall it's the most positive film
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:22.400]  done by mainstream media it would overall it will be positive
[3:34:22.400 --> 3:34:26.160]  andrew and the guys were truthful with me we said it's not a hit piece but it's
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:29.520]  going to be objective and now talking to him and i remember you know
[3:34:29.520 --> 3:34:32.400]  they had folks that that they could have made it look like complete lunatics
[3:34:32.400 --> 3:34:35.280]  because i know who's out there and i know what goes on i mean if they would
[3:34:35.280 --> 3:34:39.840]  have wanted to uh and uh they didn't do that and i
[3:34:39.840 --> 3:34:42.320]  know that they tried to make you know other people try to make fair films on
[3:34:42.320 --> 3:34:46.400]  discovery channel and things and it got shelved with other filmmakers
[3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:49.920]  so i know how hard it is to get something as fair as what they did on
[3:34:49.920 --> 3:34:53.360]  a little stereotypical and from my opinion you know you know they did focus
[3:34:53.360 --> 3:34:55.760]  on a little bit of the cliches but some of that's for comic
[3:34:55.760 --> 3:34:59.200]  relief but we do have a lot of cliches in our movement
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:04.160]  but at least we're in the arena we're taking action we're engaged
[3:35:04.160 --> 3:35:09.440]  and i know a lot some folks uh you know out there
[3:35:09.440 --> 3:35:13.760]  have trouble dealing with that some people got confused by what i was saying
[3:35:13.760 --> 3:35:17.120]  i'm saying bloomberg and the new york times and variety and all these
[3:35:17.120 --> 3:35:21.520]  publications the LA Times did a halfway hit piece
[3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:24.640]  but the others came out and implied there is no builderberg group there was no
[3:35:24.640 --> 3:35:28.160]  fire alarm pulled by security uh there weren't people following us and there
[3:35:28.160 --> 3:35:30.560]  were people following us andrew neal one of the filmmakers
[3:35:30.560 --> 3:35:34.320]  was in the van with us can tell you that and then one of his partners
[3:35:34.320 --> 3:35:37.440]  davis was in there when the big cops were coming in saying let's attack
[3:35:37.440 --> 3:35:40.640]  the state department together and he go you know my dad's a detective in
[3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:44.640]  chicago i know cops when i see him that's an FBI guy and i go yes i i know it's
[3:35:44.640 --> 3:35:47.600]  like telling me that's a duck swimming along in the pond right there
[3:35:47.600 --> 3:35:50.720]  yes i know that but but the issue i was leading the guy along you know talking
[3:35:50.720 --> 3:35:54.880]  to him uh so
[3:35:54.880 --> 3:35:58.800]  i get mad at the distortions by the media off of this
[3:35:58.800 --> 3:36:04.800]  and then at the same time i don't want to blame these filmmakers i think they've
[3:36:04.800 --> 3:36:07.440]  had a lot of courage and i talked to them they're getting attacked by the left
[3:36:07.440 --> 3:36:10.560]  how dare you give all these cooks this attention they're getting attacked by a
[3:36:10.560 --> 3:36:14.000]  lot of people right now but they're also getting huge amounts of attention
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.480]  and so they've arrived as filmmakers they made a lot of other award-winning
[3:36:16.480 --> 3:36:20.880]  films but this one is big you know it's going big in the theaters
[3:36:20.880 --> 3:36:24.960]  it's going to go big internationally it's huge on ifc so very exciting
[3:36:24.960 --> 3:36:27.760]  and i want to bring up for the next 10 minutes because he's on a shoot right
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:32.880]  now working today in massachusetts i want to bring up andrew neal
[3:36:32.880 --> 3:36:37.120]  hey buddy good to have you on with us thanks for having me on yeah no i mean
[3:36:37.120 --> 3:36:38.880]  um a lot of what you're saying there was really
[3:36:38.880 --> 3:36:41.760]  failing so like just discussing the film right now i mean
[3:36:41.760 --> 3:36:45.440]  you know of course you know as you know but probably better than just about
[3:36:45.440 --> 3:36:47.920]  anyone else it's not you know it's not fun to get
[3:36:47.920 --> 3:36:51.440]  yammered at and yell that and criticize and that sort of thing but
[3:36:51.440 --> 3:36:55.520]  basically the most important thing in my opinion as a filmmaker right now is
[3:36:55.520 --> 3:36:58.800]  that this film is doing really well and that
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:03.840]  you know this in in one month in one month of ifc
[3:37:03.840 --> 3:37:09.360]  vod it is broken all of their records for documentaries on ifc vod and that's
[3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:14.080]  one month okay so that means that means many many
[3:37:14.080 --> 3:37:17.520]  people are tuning in to watch this film you know and and
[3:37:17.520 --> 3:37:21.360]  and uh you know it's not easy to get attacked sometimes i'm down yeah you
[3:37:21.360 --> 3:37:24.240]  know we're getting it from we we've got you know it's a bit sometimes it feels
[3:37:24.240 --> 3:37:27.760]  like a rock in a hard place you know we've got we've got the left
[3:37:27.760 --> 3:37:31.600]  saying how dare you know you give these these people a stoke box
[3:37:31.600 --> 3:37:35.520]  and let them say this kind of stuff you know i've got i've got the right
[3:37:35.520 --> 3:37:38.480]  basically saying the same kind you know sorry
[3:37:38.480 --> 3:37:42.960]  andrew andrew family audience oh sorry sorry saying the same kind of stuff
[3:37:42.960 --> 3:37:47.440]  and you know it gets me pretty angry you know i i just like and because i don't
[3:37:47.440 --> 3:37:51.360]  you know we we try to make something we try to make something objective here
[3:37:51.360 --> 3:37:54.560]  you know and and basically what we feel like is we're getting pinched between
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:58.960]  everybody and and and and uh you know that that that i think that's kind of
[3:37:58.960 --> 3:38:02.400]  gotten on our nerves i mean i even got ron paul supporters
[3:38:02.400 --> 3:38:06.240]  saying this is a hit piece because it connects ron paul and nine eleven
[3:38:06.240 --> 3:38:09.440]  i mean everyone there's so many different agendas yeah well let's get this
[3:38:09.440 --> 3:38:13.360]  clear let's get this clear most america is very mentally ill right now and
[3:38:13.360 --> 3:38:16.400]  there's always problems in society but we're a very sick society
[3:38:16.400 --> 3:38:19.920]  and just like mexico or other countries that can't get it together
[3:38:19.920 --> 3:38:23.600]  when i talk people from mexico they say that nobody wants anybody to do well
[3:38:23.600 --> 3:38:29.040]  it's a culture of corruption so anytime i mean if you were to find a gold nugget
[3:38:29.040 --> 3:38:32.800]  at the grand canyon some old lady to come up and say you were a child molester
[3:38:32.800 --> 3:38:36.960]  you know they don't like anybody having success period you ever gone crab fishing
[3:38:36.960 --> 3:38:40.640]  you got five or six crabs in the bucket they could team up and climb out together
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:44.400]  but if anyone tries to get out the other crab comes over and grabs them
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:48.320]  and and and the american system was always the opposite of that
[3:38:48.320 --> 3:38:51.760]  now we become like every other backwards decadence sickening
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:38:55.440]  it's a nation of spectators that have no respect for themselves
[3:38:55.440 --> 3:38:58.960]  and so they're going to hate anyone who's an achiever but but the good news is
[3:38:58.960 --> 3:39:01.840]  it's the record i fc film the ratings have come in
[3:39:01.840 --> 3:39:06.640]  huge for last night all-time record for the uh uh people that are watching it on
[3:39:06.640 --> 3:39:10.000]  demand and it's huge and you know they're going to want to do a big series
[3:39:10.000 --> 3:39:13.840]  with you guys now basically for all the stuff you know you're a winner listen
[3:39:13.840 --> 3:39:19.120]  they don't like the guy in pole position so so andrew you need to learn to
[3:39:19.120 --> 3:39:23.520]  enjoy it enjoy the jealousy when somebody's jealous of me i just get a
[3:39:23.520 --> 3:39:26.640]  monago you're right you're so smart i'm bad
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:31.040]  you're the genius and then they everybody sees how arrogant they look
[3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:34.720]  that's the secret you know you're doing it for the right reason
[3:39:34.720 --> 3:39:38.800]  you tried to make a fair film i think you went with a few cliches but you could
[3:39:38.800 --> 3:39:43.280]  have gone even worse so so again feel good about your big victory
[3:39:43.280 --> 3:39:45.760]  yeah i mean you know that's the one thing that you brought up that i really
[3:39:45.760 --> 3:39:49.280]  agree with alice you know like i yeah i'm not going to get into the list of the
[3:39:49.280 --> 3:39:52.480]  kind of stuff that we ran into when we were making it so
[3:39:52.480 --> 3:39:56.240]  i mean you know just you told me some of the footage you've got it
[3:39:56.240 --> 3:40:00.080]  it's absolutely you see the people are so arrogant they don't know
[3:40:00.080 --> 3:40:03.120]  what making fun of the patriot movement behind their backs looks like
[3:40:03.120 --> 3:40:06.640]  they don't know what in arrogance looks like on film
[3:40:06.640 --> 3:40:09.840]  they don't know what a favor you did them not showing it
[3:40:09.840 --> 3:40:13.360]  yeah and you know i you know i i have a i have a few people you know that we
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:15.680]  don't look that they're just blatantly or or what
[3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:18.880]  you know that's kind of stuff like that and that's just
[3:40:18.880 --> 3:40:22.480]  it's just it's unprofessional childish you know the fact of the matter is when
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:25.760]  you when you when you shoot with people who have big egos
[3:40:25.760 --> 3:40:30.640]  you know and it's not complex you know sometimes they act like babies when they
[3:40:30.640 --> 3:40:33.200]  don't get put in put in the piece you know and
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:37.280]  and and you know and that's just kind of slimy and and low behavior and
[3:40:37.280 --> 3:40:41.680]  and you know i like i just think it's unprofessional and kind of silly
[3:40:41.680 --> 3:40:45.280]  well listen and or and or and or the issue is everybody's great everybody's
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:48.400]  friends we just need to realize that we're almost
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:51.600]  having nuclear war right now with north korea they've they've
[3:40:51.600 --> 3:40:53.920]  declared war they've gotten rid of the armistice
[3:40:53.920 --> 3:40:57.040]  so the state of war after 56 years is back in place
[3:40:57.040 --> 3:41:00.640]  israel's talking about hitting iran iran has sent battleships out
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:04.640]  to confront the u.s fleet hundreds of miles away from their waters
[3:41:04.640 --> 3:41:09.360]  that's roiders uh the nato is encircling russia russia's threatening back
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:11.680]  russia's saying they're worried about nuclear war
[3:41:11.680 --> 3:41:15.280]  china's on high alert japan's threatening to attack people
[3:41:15.280 --> 3:41:18.640]  and the decadent american public and europeans
[3:41:18.640 --> 3:41:23.200]  are just descending into total lunacy with one group denying there's a new
[3:41:23.200 --> 3:41:26.640]  world order and other people running around crazy you said you had groups and
[3:41:26.640 --> 3:41:30.560]  people you didn't put in the film uh who said that i was mind
[3:41:30.560 --> 3:41:32.880]  controlling people with chips in their heads
[3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:36.160]  uh i don't know i've got people i've got people saying that you
[3:41:36.160 --> 3:41:40.560]  are controlling my mind with a mind control machine
[3:41:40.560 --> 3:41:44.960]  okay and and they're saying and they're saying that this is a propaganda this is
[3:41:44.960 --> 3:41:48.000]  from the other side right the other side is like i'm
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:52.400]  hold on hold on hold on i'm count dracula uh and like i'm saying come
[3:41:52.400 --> 3:41:57.520]  here on helsing i've come here and it's it's it's acting you're like
[3:41:57.520 --> 3:42:02.640]  oh you are strong will for one that has only lived one life uh i was talking
[3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:06.960]  to your friend my cover we got a blah blah
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:09.760]  i was talking to your producer before we got on the show and actually you know
[3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:12.560]  and i'm you know i'm a little worked out about everything and there's
[3:42:12.560 --> 3:42:16.400]  you know too many days of like you know too many opinions but
[3:42:16.400 --> 3:42:19.760]  what he pointed out and i think he's basically right you know if you make
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:23.520]  something to get people this riled up then you've made something interesting
[3:42:23.520 --> 3:42:26.640]  and and in the end you know that is what
[3:42:26.640 --> 3:42:30.240]  luke and i were trying to do was trying to make something interesting something
[3:42:30.240 --> 3:42:33.680]  objective you know and and you're allowed to have your qualms of it about
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:36.560]  the cliches and people are allowed to criticize and that's the other thing i
[3:42:36.560 --> 3:42:39.280]  want to say you know people are allowed to say they hate it
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:42.880]  you know that's it that's that freedom of speech you're allowed to say that
[3:42:42.880 --> 3:42:45.920]  but andrews let me stop you i want to be clear i'm gonna let you make your
[3:42:45.920 --> 3:42:49.840]  points i'm i have complex emotions about it
[3:42:49.840 --> 3:42:52.960]  i understand it's like cliches but because
[3:42:52.960 --> 3:42:56.720]  those really are our cliches i know you were being kind
[3:42:56.720 --> 3:42:59.840]  with the stuff you didn't put in it now that you've told me what you've got my
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:03.680]  god is it unbelievable so so so in a way
[3:43:03.680 --> 3:43:07.920]  i understand but see this is the deal we're not cloistered
[3:43:07.920 --> 3:43:13.920]  do you know monolithic mainstream media so of course if you wanted to to go out
[3:43:13.920 --> 3:43:17.760]  and pick a bunch of buffoons to represent us you could have done that
[3:43:17.760 --> 3:43:21.680]  and and and i don't think you did that to a great extent you did it to
[3:43:21.680 --> 3:43:25.440]  somewhat of you know an extent so i'm not blaming you the issue is
[3:43:25.440 --> 3:43:28.640]  we're on the verge of world war three so what does it even matter
[3:43:28.640 --> 3:43:32.400]  yeah right yeah well you know god did you know i mean excuse me
[3:43:32.400 --> 3:43:36.400]  i don't have an entire problem today you know i you know that that's the thing
[3:43:36.400 --> 3:43:39.840]  like i i think people tend to kind of lose perspective
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:44.480]  about stuff you know and and uh... what's so amazing to me is when we
[3:43:44.480 --> 3:43:48.320]  we set out to make a fair film we make a film that's really for all intents
[3:43:48.320 --> 3:43:52.560]  and purposes a very safe documentary really i mean when it comes down to it
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:55.840]  not behind the scenes movie about what it's like to hang out
[3:43:55.840 --> 3:43:58.800]  with with the activist journalist in your movement
[3:43:58.800 --> 3:44:02.480]  and what's amazing is that people people are so stood up you know
[3:44:02.480 --> 3:44:05.360]  both the positive and the negative actually i don't want to i don't want to
[3:44:05.360 --> 3:44:09.600]  i i want to accentuate the positive too because actually the film is a total
[3:44:09.600 --> 3:44:11.920]  victory right now because of the number of people
[3:44:11.920 --> 3:44:16.240]  we're tuning in i have feet behind it i have feet excited about it
[3:44:16.240 --> 3:44:19.920]  and and and and people are watching and that's the important thing and actually
[3:44:19.920 --> 3:44:24.080]  for for for all the for all the weird wacko email
[3:44:24.080 --> 3:44:27.600]  stuff phone calls that we get because we've had people coming up to us and
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:30.960]  saying you know what we've read that review or this review that was a great
[3:44:30.960 --> 3:44:34.240]  film we really enjoyed it and these are people who don't necessarily agree with
[3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:36.720]  everything that you or other people that still have to say
[3:44:36.720 --> 3:44:40.640]  you know they're like i i didn't really i i have those people off before
[3:44:40.640 --> 3:44:44.320]  as wackos and i understand them now more as human beings and i think
[3:44:44.320 --> 3:44:47.920]  that's an important thing you know i i i well i i think that
[3:44:47.920 --> 3:44:54.720]  the humanity in general would do better to understand why and how people came
[3:44:54.720 --> 3:44:58.160]  to believe what they believe why they believe what they believe and well
[3:44:58.160 --> 3:45:02.400]  look in this media universe with with with a 10 million different
[3:45:02.400 --> 3:45:05.760]  frequencies of information and different ideas and different
[3:45:05.760 --> 3:45:10.800]  variants and and and niches to have a big
[3:45:10.800 --> 3:45:14.480]  avant-garde film with top ratings on cable
[3:45:14.480 --> 3:45:19.440]  and gonna have a huge theatrical release now and and huge ratings
[3:45:19.440 --> 3:45:23.840]  that is a positive thing and overall as the LA Times said it shows
[3:45:23.840 --> 3:45:29.680]  myself and others is charming and what's gonna happen is people are then gonna
[3:45:29.680 --> 3:45:33.200]  see the film they're gonna go find out about who we really are
[3:45:33.200 --> 3:45:36.800]  not saying you distorted it too bad the point is you have to distort something
[3:45:36.800 --> 3:45:39.920]  in in 90 minutes because there's so much info you have to
[3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:43.680]  cram it down and and so the very nature of cutting
[3:45:43.680 --> 3:45:48.080]  something distorts it from its true continuum so they're gonna find the
[3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:50.560]  radio show they're gonna find info wars dot com
[3:45:50.560 --> 3:45:54.640]  they're gonna find prison planet dot com and this is a positive thing i learned
[3:45:54.640 --> 3:46:00.240]  that with real hit pieces certified hit pieces like the history channel thing
[3:46:00.240 --> 3:46:04.640]  that was so over the top one sided the mainstream media has so little credibility
[3:46:04.640 --> 3:46:07.920]  that that actually got us so many new people to wake up
[3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:12.400]  so this is a positive victory and it's a victory for you and i happen to know
[3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:15.520]  that you guys are struggling filmmakers that have made a few hit films
[3:46:15.520 --> 3:46:18.720]  but made but you know have maxed out your credit cards and
[3:46:18.720 --> 3:46:22.800]  you know literally on the edge of uh you know financial oblivion and that you
[3:46:22.800 --> 3:46:26.560]  barely barely might even get your money back on this sucker
[3:46:26.560 --> 3:46:31.680]  you know three years in the making uh and so and so and so and so hold on
[3:46:31.680 --> 3:46:34.240]  people are jealous they think because somebody's got to hit
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:38.160]  you know one-time tv film that they're rich they're not
[3:46:38.160 --> 3:46:42.080]  uh i hope you guys do become wealthy so you can make more films but
[3:46:42.080 --> 3:46:45.680]  that's not what happened again it's a very very sick culture
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:49.520]  show so so andrew you're just having a lot of success now
[3:46:49.520 --> 3:46:53.680]  so just get used to it well you know and the one thing you pointed out there that
[3:46:53.680 --> 3:46:57.360]  i think is important is you know i'm not i'm not saying it's a perfect movie okay
[3:46:57.360 --> 3:47:00.880]  in in fact in my opinion most really great films
[3:47:00.880 --> 3:47:04.960]  have these little flaws that make them what they are it makes them unique
[3:47:04.960 --> 3:47:09.600]  you know it's an impression it's just a fleeting 1.5 hours of time
[3:47:09.600 --> 3:47:14.160]  and you can only so show so much and we chose what we chose because we felt it
[3:47:14.160 --> 3:47:17.040]  painted after it impression of the people we met
[3:47:17.040 --> 3:47:20.080]  you know and of course there's all kinds of stuff that didn't make it in there
[3:47:20.080 --> 3:47:25.200]  and and we tried to be moral and fair and good to the people that we chose
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:28.960]  to show in the film and and and really i think for most people that see this
[3:47:28.960 --> 3:47:32.720]  movie you know they agree with that and and they see
[3:47:32.720 --> 3:47:36.800]  human beings here not not uh you know two-dimensional
[3:47:36.800 --> 3:47:41.360]  cardboard um you know cutouts i and and i and that's a good thing that's what
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:44.160]  we set out to do and i just i basically hope
[3:47:44.160 --> 3:47:48.640]  that in a way like despite you know me just kind of being a baby about you
[3:47:48.640 --> 3:47:53.440]  know uh a lot of controversy uh you know i hope that people just continue
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:56.960]  arguing and talking and thinking and looking
[3:47:56.960 --> 3:48:00.720]  at this movie and and and and hopefully you know
[3:48:00.720 --> 3:48:04.240]  a dialogue will continue and people will talk about it that's that
[3:48:04.240 --> 3:48:08.240]  that's that's why i make film you know what i mean that's why i make them
[3:48:08.240 --> 3:48:13.840]  and so i i hope that you know absolutely well andrew on a few weeks i
[3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:15.760]  want to get you and a couple other filmmakers
[3:48:15.760 --> 3:48:18.960]  here on the show and the aftermath of all this the point is
[3:48:18.960 --> 3:48:24.640]  most films on cable or i fc aren't in every major newspaper and in the front
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:27.760]  page of variety they know this film is important that's why
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:31.200]  they're attacking your film trying to give it bad reviews you've also got a
[3:48:31.200 --> 3:48:33.680]  lot of good reviews from the actual big film sites
[3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:37.840]  and the la times and so you've made a big splash here and that's hard to do
[3:48:37.840 --> 3:48:40.720]  in this huge universe of movies and films and
[3:48:40.720 --> 3:48:44.160]  productions and so i'm just blessed that i was included in it
[3:48:44.160 --> 3:48:48.160]  and uh so uh you know you called me up this morning pretty upset
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:51.600]  uh about what everybody's saying to you and doing that's what they do because

[3:53:08.000 --> 3:53:10.880]  devastated but it taught him a lesson very early in life
[3:53:10.880 --> 3:53:14.480]  that even when you do a great job for someone and your boss tells you how much
[3:53:14.480 --> 3:53:18.320]  he appreciates you every day there is no job security you are always in

[3:54:44.240 --> 3:54:47.520]  you know you're going to make a lousy cult leader you keep telling people to
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:50.160]  think for themselves and it's just not going to work
[3:54:50.160 --> 3:54:54.800]  Alex you've got it you've got to stop telling
[3:54:54.800 --> 3:54:57.920]  people to think for themselves because they keep doing that and they keep
[3:54:57.920 --> 3:55:01.520]  finding out their own truth in life you know and
[3:55:01.520 --> 3:55:06.000]  i just want to say that you remind me of Sun Tzu
[3:55:06.000 --> 3:55:09.360]  Sun Tzu i believe his name was that wrote the art of war
[3:55:09.360 --> 3:55:15.120]  and uh and Superman because oh play oh look look actually that stuff tortures
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:17.760]  me some people get all puffed up and everything
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:21.680]  uh i'm look i'm just i've been doing this for 14 years so i i'm good at it i'm
[3:55:21.680 --> 3:55:26.000]  also bad at it i got a lot of problems but look i am good at getting people
[3:55:26.000 --> 3:55:30.640]  motivated to take action but they already innately all had that in them
[3:55:30.640 --> 3:55:34.320]  but you fight for truth justice and the american way
[3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:39.520]  and you use the enemy's weapons against them you strike where they are weak and
[3:55:39.520 --> 3:55:43.680]  you are strong you are using their all right
[3:55:43.680 --> 3:55:47.200]  you aren't that guy but you're using their techniques
[3:55:47.200 --> 3:55:52.560]  and their battle and i appreciate that alex you've got to keep doing that i
[3:55:52.560 --> 3:55:56.080]  want to remind people be a fully informed juror
[3:55:56.080 --> 3:56:00.720]  go to fij a.org that's a big part of the solution
[3:56:00.720 --> 3:56:03.280]  that's why they're trying to create their own little special courts to try their
[3:56:03.280 --> 3:56:05.920]  police and stuff now just like king george the third
[3:56:05.920 --> 3:56:10.000]  did yeah so the fully informed jury's another way to take our power back
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:15.200]  exactly my son in fact uh uh uh stopped the police from using their illegal
[3:56:15.200 --> 3:56:19.920]  gestapo tactics on a member of our citizenry here in denver
[3:56:19.920 --> 3:56:24.160]  um by standing up on a jury and saying hold on a second
[3:56:24.160 --> 3:56:28.320]  it's their job to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt and did they
[3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:32.080]  uh it trod on this man's constitutional rights in the
[3:56:32.080 --> 3:56:36.400]  in the pursuit of their and you know why corrupt police hate the word gestapo
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:39.600]  that reminds people that in history police are dangerous
[3:56:39.600 --> 3:56:42.560]  that police have got to be controlled just like everything else does i
[3:56:42.560 --> 3:56:45.120]  appreciate your call good to hear from you talk to you for hours but i got
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:48.720]  everybody in there torii in idaho you're on the air
[3:56:48.720 --> 3:56:52.560]  thank you alex um i actually am a younger guy 21 years old and i've grown
[3:56:52.560 --> 3:56:55.920]  up playing video games my entire life and i spoke about a year ago and in
[3:56:55.920 --> 3:56:58.480]  retrospect a lot of the games that i played were
[3:56:58.480 --> 3:57:01.280]  promoting world government and the military and stuff like that but i
[3:57:01.280 --> 3:57:05.200]  actually played a video game just recently called metalgear solved for
[3:57:05.200 --> 3:57:09.280]  and it actually had a lot of parallels with our current reality
[3:57:09.280 --> 3:57:13.760]  it's about um an alternate reality where there's a world government that's
[3:57:13.760 --> 3:57:17.600]  controlled by ai's and those ai's have control of
[3:57:17.600 --> 3:57:21.200]  nanomachines that are in every single soldier and every single person
[3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:24.560]  and so that the nanomachines can control all the soldiers and decide
[3:57:24.560 --> 3:57:27.200]  whether or not they can fire their guns and so on and so forth
[3:57:27.200 --> 3:57:30.480]  um what's the name of this uh what's the name of this game
[3:57:30.480 --> 3:57:35.920]  metalgear solved for oh yeah metalgear solid i get a lot of emails about that
[3:57:35.920 --> 3:57:40.560]  yeah and it it was kind of strange because it wasn't necessarily predictive
[3:57:40.560 --> 3:57:43.040]  programming but it was because it was kind of
[3:57:43.040 --> 3:57:46.080]  exposing the fact that there's a shadow government and elections are controlled
[3:57:46.080 --> 3:57:49.440]  but it's also conditioning and so when you go oh bill terberg group they go oh
[3:57:49.440 --> 3:57:52.880]  i saw that in a movie or oh i saw that in the video game
[3:57:52.880 --> 3:57:55.440]  uh you know that's the only problem look i'm out of time i promise go the other
[3:57:55.440 --> 3:57:57.520]  caller call me back tomorrow we'll talk about it
[3:57:57.520 --> 3:58:01.680]  let's talk to uh nick in new york take us out of here nick go ahead
