[00:00.000 --> 00:25.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this very special Thursday edition of
[00:25.120 --> 00:29.560]  the Alex Jones Show. There have been some massive developments that have taken place
[00:29.560 --> 00:35.000]  since the Davos Group began its meeting in the last week. Again, this is the public arm
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.400]  of the Bilderberg Group. This is the top of the corporate world government that is establishing
[00:39.400 --> 00:45.360]  this entire eugenics biomedical state. They have now signaled that they're shifting away
[00:45.360 --> 00:53.560]  from the force inoculations and the lockdowns for now into carbon taxes and carbon lockdowns.
[00:53.560 --> 00:57.880]  Schwab and others said five years ago that this would be their plan once they've done
[00:57.880 --> 01:04.480]  the biomedical scare. They would then move directly to the carbon tax climate crisis.
[01:04.480 --> 01:08.720]  We're all dead by the year 2030. And then as they orchestrate the cutting off of food
[01:08.720 --> 01:15.240]  and resources in the years leading up to 2030, they then blame the collapse again on us and
[01:15.240 --> 01:19.240]  climate. And of course, it's nonsensical. None of us meant to make sense. They tell
[01:19.240 --> 01:28.280]  you, you deserve to die. They create a self-fulfilling prophecy. And then they launch the controls
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.440]  they have through the bureaucracy and through the infrastructure to accelerate the collapse.
[01:33.440 --> 01:38.480]  And if the general public can simply realize this and understand this, it's a game over
[01:38.480 --> 01:42.680]  for the new world order. Now, I'm taking care of some very important family business, but
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.560]  I'll be there within an hour. I shot a very important special report last night dealing
[01:47.560 --> 01:54.240]  with 5G and how it's causing major airlines to stop their flights in the United States.
[01:54.240 --> 02:00.880]  It's very, very revealing. US 5G is twice as strong as European 5G, extremely toxic,
[02:00.880 --> 02:07.280]  but also completely destroys the signals that aircraft get. That very important report is
[02:07.280 --> 02:12.400]  coming up next segment and so much more today. But this is a big victory that they're having
[02:12.400 --> 02:18.480]  to, on the surface, say that they're stopping the lockdowns and the vax passes for now in
[02:18.480 --> 02:23.400]  areas like the UK because they know that it's built a crescendo, a political resistance
[02:23.400 --> 02:29.120]  in awakening that if they keep pushing, would cause a catalyst and a major political realignment
[02:29.120 --> 02:33.320]  that would defeat them. They had the Liberals and the Conservatives ready with a supermajority
[02:33.320 --> 02:37.880]  and parliament in the UK to override the prime minister and stop the lockdowns. Now, he'll
[02:37.880 --> 02:42.520]  come back with lockdowns later, but the point is people are now onto them. Finally, I want
[02:42.520 --> 02:47.720]  to play a clip of Joe Biden in his disastrous press conference yesterday saying that, oh,
[02:47.720 --> 02:54.560]  he thinks that the upcoming election in 290 days is going to be disputed. It's going to
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.200]  have problems. It's going to be legitimate. Remember, no conservative is allowed to say
[02:58.200 --> 03:04.080]  that. Only Democrats can warn of election theft. Only Democrats can control the counting of
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.120]  the vote. Just as Stalin said, he doesn't care who cast the vote, but he cares who counts
[03:09.120 --> 03:13.200]  them. Harris and Smith will also be taking over a lot of breaking news in the interim
[03:13.200 --> 03:18.040]  today. But here is the clip of Joe Biden. We'll be back on the other side with this
[03:18.040 --> 03:23.560]  very important 5G report. And remember, the only way this broadcast gets out, the only
[03:23.560 --> 03:27.040]  people hear the truth. The only way we bypass big tech in the New World Order is when you
[03:27.040 --> 03:35.360]  share the live links from freeworldnews.tv and infowars.com for slash show and futurenews.news.
[03:35.360 --> 03:38.040]  Here is Joe Biden, the puppet collapsing. Yes, sir.
[03:38.040 --> 03:45.680]  I want to clarify a moment ago when you were asked whether or not you believed that we
[03:45.680 --> 03:50.680]  would have free and fair elections in 2022. If some of these state legislators reforms
[03:50.680 --> 04:00.120]  their voting protocols, you said that it depends. Do you think that they would in any way be
[04:00.120 --> 04:05.280]  illegitimate? Oh, yeah, I think it easily be illegitimate.
[04:05.280 --> 04:13.120]  Imagine if, in fact, Trump has succeeded in convincing Pence to not count the votes. Imagine
[04:13.120 --> 04:16.400]  if... In regards to 2022, sir, the mid-2022...
[04:16.400 --> 04:26.120]  I mean, imagine if those attempts to say that the count was not legit. You have to recount
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.880]  it or we're not going to count. We're going to discard the following votes. I'm not saying
[04:31.880 --> 04:36.840]  it's going to be legit. The increase in the prospect of being illegitimate is a direct
[04:36.840 --> 04:43.120]  proportion of us not being able to get these reforms passed. But I don't think you're going
[04:43.120 --> 04:46.360]  to see... You're not going to see me, and I don't think you're going to see the Democratic
[04:46.360 --> 04:54.440]  Party give up on coming back and assuming that the attempt fails today.
[04:54.440 --> 05:01.080]  One more, sir. You campaigned and you ran on a return to...
[05:01.080 --> 05:06.480]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading
[05:06.480 --> 05:11.040]  a healthier life. Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your
[05:11.040 --> 05:16.560]  system with a supplement that contains both. This infowars life offering vitamin C plus
[05:16.560 --> 05:21.680]  zinc with rose hips should be your next purchase from the infowars store. The rose hips contained
[05:21.680 --> 05:28.120]  within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals that contain the rose plant seeds.
[05:28.120 --> 05:33.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.640]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have
[05:37.640 --> 05:42.400]  shown. As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an
[05:42.400 --> 05:47.500]  important role in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[05:47.500 --> 05:52.600]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations
[05:52.600 --> 05:57.640]  like here in America. So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarsstore.com
[05:57.640 --> 06:00.360]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.
[06:00.360 --> 06:09.280]  Dozens of major world airline carriers have stopped flights to the United States over
[06:09.280 --> 06:15.400]  one big thing, 5G, and the fact that it totally jams all their communications.
[06:15.400 --> 06:22.440]  Lufthansa became one of at least nine airlines cancelling flights or changing jets over fears
[06:22.440 --> 06:27.160]  the 5G network could interfere with the plane's technology.
[06:27.160 --> 06:31.600]  A warning that sensitive flight instruments like autopilot and terrain warning may be
[06:31.600 --> 06:35.920]  compromised in low visibility conditions, which we've seen in the northeast this week.
[06:35.920 --> 06:42.480]  Including the possibility of catastrophic failures leading to multiple fatalities in
[06:42.480 --> 06:49.760]  the absence of appropriate mitigations.
[06:49.760 --> 06:55.600]  When you hear the term 5G, that's simply a name for the latest generation mass rollout
[06:55.600 --> 07:03.520]  of wireless communication. But 5G is extremely powerful, way more powerful than previous generations.
[07:03.520 --> 07:10.280]  It doesn't go as far, but in the proximity where it works it is incredibly powerful and
[07:10.280 --> 07:15.320]  penetrates everything. Now we can't see it because our eyes only pick up a very small
[07:15.320 --> 07:23.280]  part of the energy spectrum, but if you could see it, it is like a giant, blasting sun of
[07:23.280 --> 07:28.600]  microwave radiation. Your cell phones, of course, interface with it using their own
[07:28.600 --> 07:36.320]  microwave system. They are transceivers, they receive and transmit. So everybody is freaking
[07:36.320 --> 07:41.680]  out now. Not about the Wired magazine articles many years ago confirming 5G causes cancer
[07:41.680 --> 07:46.000]  and linking to the actual studies. Not all the real research. Oh no, that's just research
[07:46.000 --> 07:51.640]  papers. But when the public hears, wait a minute, foreign airlines are grounding traffic
[07:51.640 --> 07:56.800]  to major US cities where 5G was about to be turned on. What the hell is going on? Well,
[07:56.800 --> 08:01.640]  it's because they already know in other parts of the world where 5G has gone in, it wreaks
[08:01.640 --> 08:06.920]  total havoc on the instrumentation of the aircraft again because it's so incredibly
[08:06.920 --> 08:14.840]  powerful. It blocks and jams many of their systems like altimeters. Now think about that.
[08:14.840 --> 08:18.360]  Whether you think cancer is a good thing, whether you think the world is overpopulated
[08:18.360 --> 08:21.360]  and you believe it's a good thing, it's going to kill everybody, or maybe you think it's
[08:21.360 --> 08:27.480]  good for you and it's wonderful and has no health effects despite all the facts, why
[08:27.480 --> 08:33.440]  would the establishment worldwide roll this out and not go out and research and check
[08:33.440 --> 08:43.680]  that it jams all sorts of other communications, blinds the different instruments in the cockpit
[08:43.680 --> 08:50.520]  of aircraft. Why wouldn't the corporate system go out and do studies or look at what the
[08:50.520 --> 08:55.160]  effects of this would be once they turned it on? Well, the answer is they just don't
[08:55.160 --> 08:59.720]  care because they want autonomous cars and autonomous robots on the streets and that's
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.840]  what 5G is for overall. Because you can't have latent systems that have a big space
[09:05.840 --> 09:11.680]  of time or have to buffer when it's a robot car or a robot truck or a robot drone or robot
[09:11.680 --> 09:19.880]  aircraft, you've got to have continual connection to that. And that's why they want 5G in place.
[09:19.880 --> 09:23.120]  And the political system doesn't care about the health risks. They don't care about the
[09:23.120 --> 09:26.720]  facts that this stuff is worse statistically than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for
[09:26.720 --> 09:32.400]  40 years. They care about having this control system in so they can roll out the new robot
[09:32.400 --> 09:39.000]  economy that Klaus Schwab talks about so much. But there is a major historical parallel
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.840]  to what we've seen with 5G rollout and all the evidence and all the facts and all the
[09:42.840 --> 09:49.240]  dangers being ignored by the establishment. And that's the deep water horizon oil rig
[09:49.240 --> 09:56.360]  explosion that happened more than a decade ago on April 20th, 2010. And what happened
[09:56.360 --> 10:02.320]  then? It's on record. In fact, if you've seen a movie with Kurt Russell and with others,
[10:02.320 --> 10:06.800]  it's extremely accurate because they used the lawsuit court proceedings and witness
[10:06.800 --> 10:13.400]  files to basically write the script. And I've gone and read much of the file and much
[10:13.400 --> 10:20.960]  of the testimony from Deepwater Horizon. And there were bankers back in London who ordered
[10:20.960 --> 10:28.360]  the bankers in Houston to order the engineers on at that time the deepest well ever drilled
[10:28.360 --> 10:37.560]  in world history to not dump what they call mud in on top of the drill as it went deeper.
[10:37.560 --> 10:41.240]  Now mud is really just concrete. And that's why on a big rig like that, while it's drilling,
[10:41.240 --> 10:46.280]  you'll see ships just lined up for miles and miles, big tankers. And they've got concrete
[10:46.280 --> 10:50.680]  being mixed inside of them that has been pumped into the well and pumped down the hole and
[10:50.680 --> 10:56.560]  it was costing them more than $25 million a day in mud. And so the executives looked
[10:56.560 --> 10:59.920]  at that. This is all on record. They have the emails, they have the text messages, they
[10:59.920 --> 11:06.480]  have the testimony. And often London, they ordered Houston to order the rig to not dump
[11:06.480 --> 11:12.600]  mud. They said, you know, dump seawater into the hole. And then the engineers went, whoa,
[11:12.600 --> 11:17.560]  that will cause it to mix with the gas and oil and cause a blowout guarantee. And because
[11:17.560 --> 11:20.880]  there's not enough pressure in it, at first, the water pressure will keep it down, but
[11:20.880 --> 11:24.320]  it'll only build. And once it explodes, it'll probably kill everybody on the rig and cause
[11:24.320 --> 11:31.800]  the biggest oil spill in history. And on record, the execs ordered them to do it. And so the
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.680]  engineers did want to lose their jobs. They should have just said, I'm not doing it. And
[11:36.680 --> 11:41.280]  they said, okay, we want the head executive in the US here on the ship. So he got on a
[11:41.280 --> 11:45.640]  jet and they got on a helicopter and flew out there. And they did the test. And they
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.320]  stopped dumping the concrete in. And at first it didn't blow up. And he said, see, told
[11:51.320 --> 11:57.280]  you bye, flew off. And a few hours later, in the middle of the night, it blew sky high.
[11:57.280 --> 12:02.920]  And the rest is history. And that's a perfect example of 5g. Are these mRNA vaccines or
[12:02.920 --> 12:07.800]  all of these corporate revolutions where these corporate heads don't feel like they're ever
[12:07.800 --> 12:11.760]  going to be held accountable. Okay, they cause $100 billion of damages, they pay a $2 billion
[12:11.760 --> 12:15.720]  fine. Or they put a deadly vaccine that causes a bunch of death, they'll just have the regulators
[12:15.720 --> 12:20.040]  they own cover it up. And that's what we've seen with the vaccine rollout. That's what
[12:20.040 --> 12:23.600]  we've seen with the Deepwater Horizon. And that's what we've seen with 5g. And it's
[12:23.600 --> 12:30.240]  just crazy. Plato, more than 2300 years ago, wrote about a lot of things that archaeologists
[12:30.240 --> 12:34.520]  have since found to be true. Like everything they discovered is just proving what he said.
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.360]  But there's large parts of what he said that we can't prove. He claimed that out in the
[12:38.360 --> 12:43.640]  Atlantic Ocean, there was this big island that had ships that flew in the air, had
[12:43.640 --> 12:47.760]  a big energy source that fired a light into the air, and that out of that energy source,
[12:47.760 --> 12:54.440]  all the machines, including what he described as basically big, tall, Autobot type transformers
[12:54.440 --> 12:59.440]  walking around that humans control. And he said 2000 plus years ago, this was happening,
[12:59.440 --> 13:03.500]  and that the energy source got unstable because they wanted too much power from it and it
[13:03.500 --> 13:11.480]  blew up. Now, I don't know if Atlantis really existed, but we've built Atlantis type technology
[13:11.480 --> 13:14.800]  now. And we've got a bunch of corporate chiefs and people that feel totally disconnected
[13:14.800 --> 13:19.360]  from reality. They're creating animal human clones. They are releasing GMO all over the
[13:19.360 --> 13:22.880]  planet. They're releasing smart dust. They created COVID-19 and Wuhan. That's in all
[13:22.880 --> 13:28.560]  the documents. And the public is living here in this super scientific advanced civilization,
[13:28.560 --> 13:32.400]  but we're losing our ability to read and write. We're losing our ability to even understand
[13:32.400 --> 13:39.160]  history or even care or even worry about ourselves. We are like the Atlanteans. We are the Atlanteans
[13:39.160 --> 13:45.280]  here today. Whether they exist or not, we are Atlantis. Come true today and we're reaching
[13:45.280 --> 13:51.040]  that Atlantean moment when we destroy ourselves. So ladies and gentlemen, the globalist, no
[13:51.040 --> 13:55.560]  5G gives you cancer. The globalists absolutely know these vaccines don't protect you and
[13:55.560 --> 14:00.240]  cause cancer and heart attacks and blood clots. And they're just going ahead with it because
[14:00.240 --> 14:05.400]  they want to have the organized controlled collapse of society. They want to get rid
[14:05.400 --> 14:09.400]  of the general public. And that's why they're so reckless and so crazy. But it's clear from
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.200]  their activities that wanting the population, wanting to be able to dystopia is really because
[14:13.200 --> 14:17.760]  they don't have the mind or the skills to hold humanity up and actually build a future
[14:17.760 --> 14:21.560]  we don't destroy ourselves. So they've just rationalized that they're having a controlled
[14:21.560 --> 14:26.360]  demolition of the economy through globalism because that's a better plan. And the truth
[14:26.360 --> 14:31.360]  is they're scared and don't know what to do. There's also a healthy mix of powerful corporate
[14:31.360 --> 14:35.520]  executives. So again, I think they know better than engineers about simple mathematics of
[14:35.520 --> 14:42.960]  the fact that deep water well is going to blow up when it hits major gas and oil reserves.
[14:42.960 --> 14:50.520]  So this is a cautionary parable that's real life for everybody to wake up and look around
[14:50.520 --> 14:55.400]  us and realize that everything these big corporations roll out is not always a good
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.960]  idea. And generally, it's a very bad idea. And they're like mad scientists that actually
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.400]  don't know what they're doing, but they're just playing around with the very laws of
[15:03.400 --> 15:07.760]  nature and physics. All right, thank you for joining us here today. We'll continue. We'll
[15:07.760 --> 15:11.520]  come back after the break info wars.com tomorrow's news today.
[15:11.520 --> 15:27.560]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's
[15:27.560 --> 15:34.560]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight? You better believe you got one.
[15:34.560 --> 16:01.520]  From the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. The powerful combination
[16:01.520 --> 16:07.480]  of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones to leading a healthier life. Info wars
[16:07.480 --> 16:11.440]  has made it easier to make sure you're getting enough in your system with a supplement that
[16:11.440 --> 16:17.000]  contains both. This info wars life offering vitamin C plus zinc with rose hips should
[16:17.000 --> 16:21.640]  be your next purchase from the info war store. The rose hips contained within are a part
[16:21.640 --> 16:27.600]  of the rose flower just below the pedals that contain the rose plant seeds. Natural chemicals
[16:27.600 --> 16:32.320]  found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions, including
[16:32.320 --> 16:37.660]  those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown as for
[16:37.660 --> 16:42.080]  vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[16:42.080 --> 16:47.320]  in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health. It has been reported
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.520]  that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.600]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com where we promise our
[16:57.600 --> 17:03.480]  rose hips don't lie. Well, I'm very excited for several reasons that two of our very popular
[17:03.480 --> 17:09.160]  products are back in stock. Whole food, multivitamin, a central nutrient multivitamin from natural
[17:09.160 --> 17:15.240]  healthy sources, not synthetic and vitamin C and zinc with rose hips, the classic Linus
[17:15.240 --> 17:19.680]  Pauling Nobel Prize winning formula to supercharge your immune system and every cell in your
[17:19.680 --> 17:26.280]  body, they're both back in stock sold out for more than four months at 40% off. Another
[17:26.280 --> 17:31.360]  reason I'm very, very excited about this is this will fund our operation and keep us on
[17:31.360 --> 17:38.760]  air. So again, it's a 360 win, but whatever you do, go out and get an organic whole food,
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.440]  multivitamin and take vitamin C and take zinc. And we also have some great vitamin D products
[17:43.440 --> 17:48.800]  at infowarstore.com as well. But whatever you do, defend your body's immune system. We
[17:48.800 --> 17:52.680]  want to keep patriots in the game against the new world order. So it's a 360 win. It's
[17:52.680 --> 17:56.040]  something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and your immune
[17:56.040 --> 18:02.160]  system while funding the info war at infowarstore.com. Ultimate bone broth is back and better than
[18:02.160 --> 18:07.720]  ever and 20% off plus free shipping and double Patriot points for a new sale. After years
[18:07.720 --> 18:11.760]  of being off the shelves or bringing back one of the biggest fan favorite formulas ever
[18:11.760 --> 18:18.000]  and it's now been reformulated as even stronger. It's ultimate bone broth plus it's got concentrated
[18:18.000 --> 18:23.040]  high quality chicken broth protein, turmeric root that's so amazing, chaga musher, bee
[18:23.040 --> 18:28.720]  pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, then it's got added magnesium and potassium for
[18:28.720 --> 18:34.640]  electrolytes. It's got real organic cocoa bean powder with natural chocolate flavor
[18:34.640 --> 18:38.680]  and a touch of sea salt. It even tastes better than last formula. And what it does for your
[18:38.680 --> 18:45.040]  body is simply amazing. Again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein isolate
[18:45.040 --> 18:49.320]  powder for better flavor and dissolvability. You're going to love this. And when it does
[18:49.320 --> 18:53.320]  for your joints, what it does for your body, it does for your bones. It's simply amazing
[18:53.320 --> 18:57.600]  and it helps funding info war. This is really the best bone broth out there. So get yours
[18:57.600 --> 19:03.760]  at infowarstore.com today. If your ruthless mega corporations have taken over almost every
[19:03.760 --> 19:08.320]  government on earth and who are trying to destroy the middle class and any form of upper
[19:08.320 --> 19:12.280]  mobility, you've got to divide and conquer the public so they don't know they're being
[19:12.280 --> 19:19.000]  targeted. And that's why the Fortune 100 have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT, African
[19:19.000 --> 19:23.160]  American rights, all the rest of it, all over the world. That's now their corporate face
[19:23.160 --> 19:28.000]  while they run slave camps in Africa and in communist China and many other areas, while
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.680]  they undermine our basic liberties here and spy on us through the big tech and the central
[19:32.680 --> 19:38.680]  banks and other zone. So this is a criminal takeover. And when you look at the new super
[19:38.680 --> 19:44.320]  class, it's the politicians, it's the corporate media, it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[19:44.320 --> 19:48.320]  it's members of Congress and their staff and their families, it's the White House, hell
[19:48.320 --> 19:54.600]  it's postal workers who were all exempt from the poison shots, but not the general public
[19:54.600 --> 19:58.360]  and everybody else through corporate rule. So this is the true discrimination that's
[19:58.360 --> 19:59.360]  going on.
[19:59.360 --> 20:24.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:24.360 --> 20:39.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, throughout history, humanity looks at evil organizations and
[20:39.440 --> 20:45.760]  powerful empires and believe that somehow they must have a plan, they must be invincible.
[20:45.760 --> 20:54.920]  Why would they be persecuting and enslaving and murdering giant swaths of humanity? And
[20:54.920 --> 20:59.480]  it's because they are psychotics, they are evil. It is a desire they have. Why did Jeffrey
[20:59.480 --> 21:04.560]  Dahmer kidnap people off the street and inject acid into their brain to turn them into sex
[21:04.560 --> 21:12.880]  slaves that sometimes would live up to a week lobotomized? Because he was evil. Why did
[21:12.880 --> 21:19.040]  he torture to death neighborhood dogs and cats? Because he liked it. Why does Bill Gates
[21:19.040 --> 21:26.760]  and Fauci do what they do? Because they like it. Thousands of studies Fauci directly funded
[21:26.760 --> 21:32.880]  torturing dogs and cats to death. And I've raised the dog and cat reports that are public
[21:32.880 --> 21:38.680]  because no one cares about the 10,000 plus black children, that's the main group, almost
[21:38.680 --> 21:46.920]  all black. Mainstream news in the 90s on the east coast of New Jersey and in New York and
[21:46.920 --> 21:52.760]  in Maryland and in DC taking children as young as two from their mothers that were healthy
[21:52.760 --> 22:00.360]  and killing them. Seven and eight year olds would escape facilities and be chained down
[22:00.360 --> 22:09.440]  and murdered, murdered, murdered, murdered. These are mad scientists that have set the
[22:09.440 --> 22:16.120]  precedent to do this on the small scale and now they're doing it on the mass scale. So
[22:16.120 --> 22:20.880]  there are some gigantic seismic developments that have taken place. The globalists have
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.400]  all their actuaries, all their psychological warfare operatives, all their behavioral psychologists
[22:25.400 --> 22:29.160]  and they push and push and push and push in Europe and push and push and push in the
[22:29.160 --> 22:35.480]  UK and push and push and push in the United States and other areas until massive resistance
[22:35.480 --> 22:43.640]  formed and massive resistance kept intensifying and most importantly their own families and
[22:43.640 --> 22:49.840]  their own relations that were compartmentalized and not part of the plan began to leave them
[22:49.840 --> 22:58.200]  and began to leak information on them. And I'm not calling for this but some people's
[22:58.200 --> 23:05.320]  family members have been quietly killing them. It's a very personal family thing, isn't it?
[23:05.320 --> 23:13.800]  So they're under major pressure of the minion class and when the Labour Party joined with
[23:13.800 --> 23:21.280]  the Conservative Party and bucking their leadership in both of the main parties in the UK and
[23:21.280 --> 23:28.440]  had a supermajority to end all the lockdowns, all the face masks, all the crap and remove
[23:28.440 --> 23:37.280]  Boris Johnson. Remember he's a Prime Minister. It's when his party's dominant they elect
[23:37.280 --> 23:41.360]  who the Prime Minister is. You're elected generally to the parliament but then it's
[23:41.360 --> 23:48.120]  parliamentary then the parliament decides who the leader is. And so faced with that they
[23:48.120 --> 23:55.880]  were meeting at Davos this week and last week they came out and the NIH here in the US announced
[23:55.880 --> 24:00.040]  face masks don't work. Natural immunity is better than the shot. We shouldn't give it
[24:00.040 --> 24:06.640]  to children but they put it out as a very quiet press release just kind of buried to
[24:06.640 --> 24:11.680]  cover their ass. And they have their surrogates keep saying it's the law you got to do it.
[24:11.680 --> 24:15.520]  It totally works. You're a terrorist if you don't take it. You should die. You should
[24:15.520 --> 24:18.960]  have healthcare taken away. You should be killed. Like Howard Stern has now said of
[24:18.960 --> 24:25.120]  the unvaccinated. But the fact that here in the US and in the UK they came out, when did
[24:25.120 --> 24:31.920]  they come out? Yesterday coordinated and said they're backing down. Now where the public
[24:31.920 --> 24:37.080]  they think can't escape and they're doing a beta test with Australia and Canada that
[24:37.080 --> 24:48.320]  are two smaller populations they are going to keep squeezing as a laboratory test. But
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.800]  everywhere else they're going to back off for a few months and then they're going to
[24:53.800 --> 25:01.880]  use cyber attacks, false flag and most importantly they're already pre-programming as I said
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.600]  they would do that as soon as they backed off in phase one they're going to apply the
[25:06.600 --> 25:10.960]  pressure back even more intense soon. They would then announce we need climate lockdowns,
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.400]  we need energy rationing and they would start imposing rolling blackouts now starting in
[25:15.400 --> 25:20.920]  the US now starting in Europe last week. And Bill Gates came out and said we're not focused
[25:20.920 --> 25:25.840]  now mainly on the quote pandemic. We're now shifting to climate change the global carbon
[25:25.840 --> 25:33.920]  tax and the social credit score via your vaccine passports. In Australia and the EU and Canada
[25:33.920 --> 25:38.560]  have all officially announced the same global UN run system and even has a social credit
[25:38.560 --> 25:46.560]  score at the top. So it's not coming it's here and then it gets more serious. We have
[25:46.560 --> 25:52.520]  the video coming up next segment. Creepy Bill Gates gives warning of other pandemics far
[25:52.520 --> 26:00.840]  worse than COVID-19 calls on governments to increase vaccine supplies. Calls on governments
[26:00.840 --> 26:07.080]  to increase vaccine supplies which goes money directly to him but that's only a means to
[26:07.080 --> 26:11.240]  the populace. He wants the money to have control of the economy and the governments so he
[26:11.240 --> 26:14.840]  can carry out his psychotic extermination operations which he publicly calls for and
[26:14.840 --> 26:19.440]  his father calls for and his grandfather called for and they ran the eugenics societies they
[26:19.440 --> 26:25.440]  ran Planned Parenthood they have been the managers for over 100 years in this country
[26:25.440 --> 26:33.720]  they are the sword of Satan. Better give him a nickname it's the sword of Satan. I mean
[26:33.720 --> 26:43.720]  that is a true demon on earth incarnate pledge to destroy you and your family. So here we
[26:43.720 --> 26:48.720]  are ladies and gentlemen and so they've reached that point where okay we pressed them too
[26:48.720 --> 26:55.420]  far now if we keep pushing they will crystallize political force legally lawfully non-violently
[26:55.420 --> 26:59.960]  they will take over via civil disobedience and we will lose all our power so press press
[26:59.960 --> 27:03.320]  press press press grab all the power get as much tracking and control and steal as much
[27:03.320 --> 27:10.720]  money kill as many people as you can and then stop but only for a couple weeks and then
[27:10.720 --> 27:15.200]  oh we're going to bring back some of the lockdowns and some of the mask rules and private companies
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.320]  are doing it and oh and oh and this oh the governors are still going to do it or the
[27:19.320 --> 27:22.960]  mayors are still going to do it and that's already being announced but at least psychologically
[27:22.960 --> 27:25.840]  they're telling you you're winning because you are winning and they want you to just
[27:25.840 --> 27:33.440]  go away now and not really take action and and and and steal your resolve harden your
[27:33.440 --> 27:39.960]  resolve to carry out the long cultural political economic system it takes for you to run for
[27:39.960 --> 27:44.040]  office and you to file lawsuits and you to take your kids to church and you to work harder
[27:44.040 --> 27:49.160]  and you to get on the straight and arrow myself included and repent to God no no back off
[27:49.160 --> 27:53.000]  let the good times come back just a little bit as much as the word before and you just
[27:53.000 --> 27:57.760]  keep tightening it slower and slower every time we push push back they let us push back
[27:57.760 --> 28:02.600]  a little and then we relax they take us even tighter and then when we fight back they kind
[28:02.600 --> 28:08.760]  of release a little but soon you're in the vice grip soon they've got you in their pencil
[28:08.760 --> 28:13.200]  attack so they're they're undermining society they're accelerating the collapse of civilization
[28:13.200 --> 28:16.280]  that's their admitted goal they're hitting us from every angle but the minute people
[28:16.280 --> 28:20.280]  realize globalism and the new world order and how it works and read their own documents
[28:20.280 --> 28:25.280]  it's game over because they're the villains they are the author of 90% of the suffering
[28:25.280 --> 28:31.760]  conservatively on the planet I mean these guys are behind almost everything the open
[28:31.760 --> 28:37.680]  border shipping the drugs in brainwashing our children annihilating our currencies hitting
[28:37.680 --> 28:42.480]  us with bio weapons they cooked up themselves and they're the saviors it's us or them are

[33:29.640 --> 33:39.400]  from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones a lot of people tune in and they noticed
[33:39.400 --> 33:45.720]  that most of the time I don't cover what is the big establishment breaking news story
[33:45.720 --> 33:48.720]  because most of the time that's just a distraction or a diversion from the real things that are
[33:48.720 --> 33:53.560]  going on but today a lot of the top stories out there in my opinion I think you'll probably
[33:53.560 --> 33:57.400]  agree are pretty important and I'm going to get to them here in a moment but notice what
[33:57.400 --> 34:02.680]  I did I went big picture or to the root of the matter and I need to get you thinking
[34:02.680 --> 34:08.680]  like this everybody else thinking like this and I know we can stop these people the fact
[34:08.680 --> 34:13.160]  that the ruling class of the planet the globalist the builder group the guys that run the debauch
[34:13.160 --> 34:19.080]  group now said okay let's let's put the brakes on the covid power grab we've gone as far
[34:19.080 --> 34:24.560]  as we can go right now this won't be like the limited pullbacks that you saw in the
[34:24.560 --> 34:29.320]  last two years off and on this is gonna be a major pullback but they're gonna let their
[34:29.320 --> 34:33.440]  own neurotics and their own minions and their own mayors and their own local leaders still
[34:33.440 --> 34:38.160]  continue to tyrannically enforce the garbage but because we've been taking city councils
[34:38.160 --> 34:43.040]  back and taking local governments back this because it's gotten the grassroots angry to
[34:43.040 --> 34:51.760]  take back peacefully the school boards and the infrastructure they've gone whoa in just
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.760]  a year and a half the patriots are taking back as much as George Soros has financed
[34:56.760 --> 35:02.480]  with stolen money over ten billion dollars the last decade so their games taking over
[35:02.480 --> 35:07.160]  local cities and towns in a year and a half of people finally waking up has been pushed
[35:07.160 --> 35:12.800]  back and it's the same thing in Europe people are waking up and all over and Brazil and
[35:12.800 --> 35:18.080]  other areas of South America and Central America is waking up and Africa is waking up and Asia
[35:18.080 --> 35:23.280]  is waking up and the Middle East is waking up to the real globalist attack but if you
[35:23.280 --> 35:27.120]  don't know about the globalist attack you don't have a hope so it's a big deal that
[35:27.120 --> 35:31.400]  they've now pivoted as they said they would do in their white papers I told you twenty
[35:31.400 --> 35:36.000]  two months ago I said when they've pushed as far as they can push they'll then move it
[35:36.000 --> 35:42.400]  to carbon taxes social credit scores and carbon lock downs and exactly that happened and again
[35:42.400 --> 35:46.920]  I will show you the magic trick it's no trick at all they write white papers they write their
[35:46.920 --> 35:52.960]  policy papers and that is a policy point that you see everywhere they don't put these policy
[35:52.960 --> 35:59.840]  points in there because they like to write stuff for no reason okay it's shut down the
[35:59.840 --> 36:03.980]  real economy shut down the human economy shut down the grassroots economy shut down the
[36:03.980 --> 36:08.480]  mainstream economy shut down the farming economy shut down the ranching economy shut
[36:08.480 --> 36:13.480]  down the national economy and come in with green deals with a bunch of fiat money they
[36:13.480 --> 36:18.160]  give themselves to put in infrastructure that doesn't work but that way they look like they're
[36:18.160 --> 36:22.920]  building the future while they're actually destroying all of our futures agenda twenty
[36:22.920 --> 36:27.920]  one agenda twenty thirty I can play you hundreds of incredibly interesting clips I can read
[36:27.920 --> 36:31.800]  all these funny news stories and make the left look like idiots and look how stupid
[36:31.800 --> 36:38.120]  Biden is he can hardly talk at his press conferences oh but it makes you feel good while you're
[36:38.120 --> 36:43.840]  dying politically and spiritually yes he's a buffoon yes he's a big joke but he's designed
[36:43.840 --> 36:48.720]  to do that to discredit the United States and to make us look stupid while the global
[36:48.720 --> 36:54.640]  is discredit the nation state it was all planned he was picked because he's out of his mind
[36:54.640 --> 37:04.160]  he was extremely brain damaged years ago and now he doesn't know what planet he's on perfect
[37:04.160 --> 37:09.480]  for the enemy because they can then blame him for everything he's doing and he says
[37:09.480 --> 37:14.200]  I'm about to sign fifty things twenty things he said it multiple bill signings I have no
[37:14.200 --> 37:19.760]  idea what this is and then he looks around and he says I'm not supposed to read this
[37:19.760 --> 37:25.160]  am I I mean he's got enough old man humor even though he's seen how to know he's doing
[37:25.160 --> 37:29.000]  something really dirty and he's letting the little criminals around him go hey my brain
[37:29.000 --> 37:33.720]  may be gone but I've been around fifty years sixty years running these scams kids so you
[37:33.720 --> 37:39.040]  may have me up here as your front guy but don't think I don't know what you're doing
[37:39.040 --> 37:45.320]  how sick is that he's in on himself being a joke to help bring the country down he doesn't
[37:45.320 --> 37:51.840]  care because he wants what's he want what's he love what's he got to have power over you
[37:51.840 --> 37:57.920]  power you know what I want power to be left alone power to live on a ranch power to work
[37:57.920 --> 38:04.720]  in a garden power to go hunt ducks with dogs power to hike power to love my children power
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.920]  to live a long life and if I'm going to do that I got to get that guy and his controllers
[38:08.920 --> 38:16.320]  off our backs I don't want your DC scum hole I don't want your LA scum hole I don't want
[38:16.320 --> 38:21.920]  your New York scum hole I don't want all your elitist scum holes it is so important to not
[38:21.920 --> 38:26.520]  just not care about Hollywood but to hate it and to absolutely reject it like poison
[38:26.520 --> 38:30.640]  that you swallowed that you vomit out of your mouth because that's what it is it's
[38:30.640 --> 38:37.400]  poison period and it is so liberating to not just not care about the system and care about
[38:37.400 --> 38:42.240]  all their little outfits and their festooning themselves and their award ceremonies and
[38:42.240 --> 38:48.080]  here's why they're so scared all the world is turning against Hollywood all the world
[38:48.080 --> 38:53.680]  is turning against the New York elites all the world is sick of it and doesn't worship
[38:53.680 --> 38:59.800]  them and isn't distracted by them and in fact we're disgusted by you we're disgusted by Tom
[38:59.800 --> 39:07.840]  Hanks we're disgusted by Kamala Harris we're disgusted by Joe Biden we're disgusted by Brad Pitt we're
[39:07.840 --> 39:14.520]  disgusted by Leonardo DiCaprio we're disgusted by Klaus Schwab we're disgusted by the pig
[39:14.520 --> 39:21.440]  queen of England we're disgusted by all you garbage we don't like you but instead of wanting
[39:21.440 --> 39:26.800]  to kill you like you want to kill us we just want you mummies you vampires like that in
[39:26.800 --> 39:31.360]  the scene in the hunger when they're all stumbling around turning to dust like Bill Clinton to
[39:31.360 --> 39:39.400]  go climb in your filthy historical graves that doesn't mean I want you to die you're
[39:39.400 --> 39:47.240]  already dead spiritually I'm saying crawl under the mausoleum crawl into your holes
[39:47.240 --> 39:52.840]  your failures and you knew you were failures and your losers that signed on to evil and
[39:52.840 --> 39:57.240]  that's why you're so pissed and you want to drag us and our children with you with your
[39:57.240 --> 40:04.200]  5g and 6g poison and your GMO mutinogenic mutation shots and all of your Satanism and
[40:04.200 --> 40:11.240]  your evil and your pus you watch CNN you watch any of these shows you read what the
[40:11.240 --> 40:15.720]  universities teach you read what the schools are teaching young children and it's all
[40:15.720 --> 40:22.480]  vile pathetic evil to make you hate yourself and to make you feel alone and then oh don't
[40:22.480 --> 40:27.960]  look up with Leonardo DiCaprio a big comet's coming to kill everybody on earth and then
[40:27.960 --> 40:33.040]  he goes hey the real comet is you the humans we're the comet we've got to kill ourselves
[40:33.040 --> 40:40.640]  he actually says that it starts with you DiCaprio it starts with you sitting out there on your
[40:40.640 --> 40:44.760]  back porch with an HD camera pouring gasoline all over yourself and lighting yourself on
[40:44.760 --> 40:50.280]  fire then I will respect you when you self emulate for the earth and say I'm the most
[40:50.280 --> 40:56.040]  degenerate spoiled piece of filth from the Davos script the population I believe humanity
[40:56.040 --> 41:00.120]  should die I believe there's so many people and I believe that the rich are over consuming
[41:00.120 --> 41:05.680]  and so now I'm going to take this gallon of gasoline I'm going to pour it all over myself
[41:05.680 --> 41:09.880]  and I'm going to take a little torch lighter and I'm going to say for the earth for for
[41:09.880 --> 41:18.800]  the for for Bambi and then no fire extinguishers just sit there and barbecue yourself until
[41:18.800 --> 41:24.680]  you die I'm not going to hurt you I wish you a long life but if you want to hate us and
[41:24.680 --> 41:30.880]  you want to teach us we're a disease and you want us to die I say to you you shellfish
[41:30.880 --> 41:39.640]  little Hollywood pig you little Hollywood piece of trash that if you had any discernment
[41:39.640 --> 41:43.720]  connection to God in the universe and the divine you would know that wanting to hurt
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.240]  poor people and wanting to depopulate the planet so you and your other pig like creatures
[41:48.240 --> 41:53.240]  like Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates can slither around that your elitism is an affront to
[41:53.240 --> 41:59.600]  God and you see the imperfections in others and think you're so perfect you don't want
[41:59.600 --> 42:04.000]  to look at us well we don't want to look at you and we're not going to hurt a little
[42:04.000 --> 42:10.880]  hair on your chinny chin chin but we ask you have some honor like a Japanese samurai
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.200]  you got the will to shove a short sword in right here on your right side and pull it
[42:15.200 --> 42:19.760]  all the way up to the middle and then turn it and stick it in your heart with control
[42:19.760 --> 42:26.040]  no you're not like that you want us to die you don't have the will to do that do you
[42:26.040 --> 42:33.200]  you are a spoiled little maggot you are the most uncool biggest loser on earth and I pray
[42:33.200 --> 42:40.640]  to God not any man but I pray to God to bring you to justice and to bring you down low as
[42:40.640 --> 42:46.520]  an example of the world I hope the audience prays with me that God bring vengeance on
[42:46.520 --> 42:55.360]  Klaus Schwab's little pupil Leonardo DiCaprio you want us to die DiCaprio I say God's got
[42:55.360 --> 43:04.400]  you in his sights whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible
[43:04.400 --> 43:11.520]  for the assault on our democracy we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic terrorists
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.480]  the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal to oppose them
[43:19.120 --> 43:25.040]  they are now debanking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly
[43:25.760 --> 43:31.760]  with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps the traders
[43:31.760 --> 43:38.000]  know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially so be it
[43:38.880 --> 43:46.480]  make them silence us by force this is the final battle of the information war give now buy products
[43:47.120 --> 43:54.320]  donate before everything changes we need you to carry us through to the end victory or death
[43:54.320 --> 44:03.200]  go down to infowarstore.com the CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that people talking
[44:03.200 --> 44:09.360]  bad about the vaccines are working for quote dark forces that the FBI and CIA have been
[44:10.000 --> 44:16.880]  advising him on who these evil groups are they know that all over the world their poison shot
[44:16.880 --> 44:23.120]  is being banned by major governments and Moderna's in trouble as well they know that the people are
[44:23.120 --> 44:28.560]  starting to get wise this depopulation agenda in fact evidence is starting to mount that the
[44:28.560 --> 44:34.080]  shots were supposed to be soft kill weapons but they're so deadly they're killing a higher percentage
[44:34.080 --> 44:42.080]  up front and so people are waking up the weapons work a little too good they're supposed to be
[44:42.080 --> 44:47.680]  silent weapons for quiet wars but instead they're making too big of a noise but it's too late for
[44:47.680 --> 44:53.440]  return back now they're coming after our children so it's up to us to protect our little children
[44:53.440 --> 45:00.400]  or god will not look favorably on us remember god is watching we've all heard about the pastor and
[45:00.400 --> 45:06.160]  his famous statement from inside a concentration camp in world war two that when they came for one
[45:06.160 --> 45:10.240]  group he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and then when they came for another group
[45:10.240 --> 45:15.280]  he wasn't part of that group so he didn't stand up and finally when they came for him there was
[45:15.280 --> 45:19.520]  nobody else to stand up well the global social credit score the china is putting in it's banning
[45:19.520 --> 45:23.760]  people to three hours of video games a week and if you criticize the government you can never buy
[45:23.760 --> 45:28.320]  or sell again well that's that's being brought here and all over the world under the guise of
[45:28.320 --> 45:33.520]  covid vaccine passports they even admit it now they're saying it's going to be a carbon tax
[45:33.520 --> 45:37.600]  attached to it they're going to track where you go what you do and decide where you can go and what
[45:37.600 --> 45:43.520]  you can do that's what the lockdowns are about you'll accept that you'll accept anything so again
[45:43.520 --> 45:47.440]  the left is having fun right now with all the censorship and tyranny pretending like they're
[45:47.440 --> 45:51.280]  part of the power structure but they're all going to be targeted by this nightmare as well
[45:51.280 --> 45:55.360]  we need to get back to basic human rights and promote them or all of us will be enslaved by
[45:55.360 --> 46:02.560]  this horrible technocracy run by the globalists well here we are in the year 2022 and info wars

[47:43.040 --> 47:53.440]  fighting for the home team anybody can look at that and see that they are out to play god
[47:53.440 --> 47:56.480]  that's why they say that the guardians of the earth because they're busy destroying the earth
[47:58.240 --> 48:02.720]  i want to talk about solutions right now the next hour i'll get into joe biden's press conference
[48:02.720 --> 48:06.720]  because even though it's a distraction just to make fun of him and laugh at him and not realize
[48:06.720 --> 48:11.520]  that that's he's a puppet a front man to take the blame he deserves blame but we need to go after
[48:11.520 --> 48:16.640]  those politically by exposing those that run him but his amazing statement of apparently
[48:16.640 --> 48:21.120]  greenlighting russia going into ukraine as long as the incursion isn't too much what does that mean
[48:23.680 --> 48:30.160]  and bill gates again saying oh more deadly viruses are coming in i'm sure he'll own and run and control
[48:30.160 --> 48:36.160]  the lab programs uh that will will create the next virus and release it on us it'll be admitted
[48:36.160 --> 48:42.080]  because he wants you to know he did it to you it's funny to him he thinks he's invincible
[48:43.440 --> 48:47.760]  that's all coming up but i want to talk about some solutions here we have this amazing member of
[48:47.760 --> 48:54.720]  the european union parliament christina anderson she made another powerful statement about tyranny
[48:54.720 --> 48:58.720]  and the fact that governments are targeting you and our predatory because evil is in control of them
[48:58.720 --> 49:02.800]  at the top doesn't mean the whole government's evil it means the evil sees control and we've
[49:02.800 --> 49:07.360]  got to get aware of that and stop it but another very well-spoken lawyer
[49:11.040 --> 49:15.920]  in new york giving a fiery speech but first here's the member of parliament in the european union
[49:16.560 --> 49:25.600]  seraclit a greek philosopher living in the fifth century bc once said the truth often evades being
[49:25.600 --> 49:33.520]  recognized due to its utter incredibility so just because you cannot fathom your government
[49:34.080 --> 49:42.000]  having ill meanings towards you doesn't mean it is not true and on the other hand i'd much rather
[49:42.000 --> 49:51.360]  be wrong than sorry but it's up to you you need to decide what you will do but keep in mind whatever
[49:51.360 --> 49:59.280]  decision you do make you will not only make it for yourself this decision will be made for your
[49:59.280 --> 50:07.440]  children and your children's children as well your decision today will shape the society your
[50:07.440 --> 50:14.560]  children will have to live in your decision today will predetermine whether your children will live
[50:14.560 --> 50:22.640]  in a free and democratic society or if they will be subjected to a surveillance police state now i
[50:22.640 --> 50:30.800]  am determined to leave my children a free and democratic society and this i will fight for
[50:30.800 --> 50:38.400]  tooth and nail and should it be the last thing i do on this planet so be it so once again
[50:38.400 --> 50:47.360]  then dear government bring it on let's see what you've got i am not afraid of you you will not
[50:47.360 --> 50:54.480]  be able to shut me up you will not be able to force me into compliance oh and one other thing
[50:55.360 --> 51:02.240]  trying to buy me off really that isn't going to work either so go ahead offer me a million
[51:02.240 --> 51:10.640]  dollars heck make it a hundred million dollars but you know what securing a future for my children
[51:10.640 --> 51:18.960]  in a free and democratic society you could not possibly put a price tag on that so when it comes
[51:18.960 --> 51:26.560]  to my stand on that issue i would like to put it in the words of margaret fetcher this lady
[51:26.560 --> 51:34.720]  is not for turning you can bet on that thank you yeah you won't see though anybody pushing her to
[51:34.720 --> 51:38.000]  be a president or prime minister because they don't want real powerful women up there they want
[51:38.000 --> 51:43.600]  puppet women just like puppet men and here's another amazing lady this is a trisha lindsey
[51:43.600 --> 51:49.440]  a speech this lawyer gave in new york here's just part of it it's powerful you want to take my
[51:49.440 --> 51:57.360]  children into a room and give them a flick a bar and some damn fry and talk about come get this back
[52:00.400 --> 52:06.240]  you don't have control of my children you don't have control of me they shut outdoors and try to
[52:06.240 --> 52:20.320]  give her god Fauci to hell with us surrendering their pulpits to the demonic huckle i'm not coming
[52:20.320 --> 52:29.760]  to your church you're not getting my time are you crazy taking children out of school i was
[52:29.760 --> 52:39.200]  born an educator for 24 years they stopped teaching them years ago you just didn't know
[52:39.200 --> 52:45.760]  what the hell years ago they taught them compliance they stopped teaching them to think
[52:45.760 --> 52:51.200]  analytical thought went out the window with state exams those state exams were just being used to
[52:51.200 --> 52:56.320]  track your children to determine who's going to college to train them to support this god for
[52:56.320 --> 53:02.800]  against god's faking system all the rest there's only elsewhere they have pushed us into prison
[53:02.800 --> 53:07.440]  i don't care how you look at it but if you're in corporate america you're imprisoned by your
[53:07.440 --> 53:12.400]  lifestyle if you're in a government you're imprisoned by your child with good benefit
[53:12.400 --> 53:17.600]  you understand if you are on society you're imprisoned by their benefit we have to get
[53:17.600 --> 53:25.760]  out their system pour yourself out pour your dollars out and level it that's right level the system
[53:25.760 --> 53:30.800]  it's not here for you it's a parasitic system that is destroying our american system a cloud

[53:37.600 --> 53:44.240]  collapse we have to defend our republic and our human system and our rule of law and what america
[53:44.240 --> 53:49.280]  was and our institutions that are real doesn't matter the enemies captured them all claus law
[53:49.280 --> 53:56.320]  brags the control that governments will have them carry up dirty work then we come in as saviour tell
[53:56.320 --> 54:04.160]  us trick of the book now let's hear from somebody who i've been on the show 30 years ago very crude
[54:04.160 --> 54:10.320]  very nasty but he supported free speech he claimed now he doesn't and here's howard stern just saying
[54:10.320 --> 54:14.800]  go home and die well a if you've already had natural immunity you can get really sick taking
[54:14.800 --> 54:18.800]  these shots the american medical association admits that they now admit it could cause heart
[54:18.800 --> 54:23.280]  attacks and blood clots they admit it doesn't protect you all this is out the cdc's now come out
[54:23.280 --> 54:28.000]  and said mass don't work we already knew that but here's howard stern doubling down obviously
[54:28.000 --> 54:35.680]  being paid to do it we need when we need fizer and others investigated for the billions they admit
[54:35.680 --> 54:40.320]  they paid the us alone to quote influencers to get up there and spout their lies especially on
[54:40.320 --> 54:45.920]  sesame street because under law that's not an authorized audience to be pushing drugs on
[54:45.920 --> 54:52.160]  because it's not approved for them and i've had expert lawyers on so is joe rogan about this
[54:52.160 --> 55:00.320]  that's illegal folks we've got to start standing up for ourselves but here is howard stern go home
[55:00.320 --> 55:09.680]  and die oh if you're at the hospital for a heart attack or a stroke or a broken leg or or a dog bite
[55:09.680 --> 55:16.480]  if you don't have the vaccine card you get sent home wow the guy's worth hundreds of millions of
[55:16.480 --> 55:23.520]  dollars his ancestors fled to america to find freedom and now he's the closest thing and i'll
[55:23.520 --> 55:31.680]  this isn't a joke to a nazi you can imagine saying take health care away and let people die die
[55:31.680 --> 55:36.880]  because you don't take an experimental shot i'm ashamed for howard stern because he can't be ashamed
[55:36.880 --> 55:46.000]  for himself here it is how are you good howard how are you doing today good i wanted to know
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.320]  your opinion um you know we've been in this uh pandemic for the past two years and we're
[55:52.320 --> 55:58.320]  sacrificing all these resources towards people who aren't vaccinated what would you think about
[55:58.320 --> 56:06.800]  just letting the pandemic run wild and move through the unvaccinated now i know that's what it's doing
[56:07.520 --> 56:12.880]  i know you're calling me from uh the ancient city of atlantis i know you're underwater so i'm
[56:12.880 --> 56:23.360]  going to answer you uh quickly uh look here's the thing as robin just pointed out it's happening
[56:23.360 --> 56:29.680]  now if it was up to me anyone unvaccinated would not be admitted to a hospital at this point they've
[56:29.680 --> 56:36.960]  been given plenty of opportunity to get the vaccine they've been told by our nation right
[56:36.960 --> 56:43.520]  they've been told that you will die if you don't have the vaccine some of you will live
[56:43.520 --> 56:52.720]  but most of you will die and uh they don't trust all right so it goes on from there uh it doesn't
[56:52.720 --> 56:57.760]  work you liar and you signed on to the wrong sign of history so did trump so i don't care if you're
[56:57.760 --> 57:01.680]  howard sternard trump or who the hell you are this shot doesn't work other than giving you a
[57:01.680 --> 57:07.680]  heart attack on cancer and blood clots and that's the reality howard so you just keep taking that
[57:07.680 --> 57:10.960]  shot buddy if you're naive enough to believe in the system you're not going to be alive very long
[57:10.960 --> 57:16.160]  and that's your fault but the system wants to ration care they want death panels and they want
[57:16.160 --> 57:20.960]  to be able to persecute a minority first which is almost the majority of the un-injected so they
[57:20.960 --> 57:25.200]  can then persecute everybody else where have we heard of that before howard sternard is a clear
[57:25.200 --> 57:30.080]  and present danger to this country he's anti-free speech he's anti-american and he is an enemy of
[57:30.080 --> 57:35.520]  the american people howard sternard is everything you don't want to be and so are the rest of these
[57:35.520 --> 57:41.760]  trashy rich new york elites that literally hate america you guys are parasites and you're a shame
[57:42.400 --> 57:46.640]  and god's gonna bring justice to you make no mistake god will make you pay
[57:46.640 --> 57:52.880]  pay in four years if you're like me you've been a long time listener of this program
[57:52.880 --> 57:58.880]  and you've fed up with everything going on in the world inside you like me a fire is burning
[57:58.880 --> 58:04.560]  something needs to change and yet we feel helpless almost like we're stuck inside a system that
[58:04.560 --> 58:10.480]  someone else created for us it's time for us to break free from that system reset wars is a game
[58:10.480 --> 58:16.400]  changer you start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim
[58:16.400 --> 58:22.000]  so much of the stuff we look at today is low vibration low energy and makes us depressed and
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.640]  therefore we manifest this negative reality out there when they feel their lie cheat steel plan
[58:26.640 --> 58:33.360]  to enslave and rob the people there is an awakening reset wars has helped me to navigate
[58:33.360 --> 58:39.360]  and to pinpoint and lock on to the deep-rooted psychological tactics that were being used against
[58:39.360 --> 58:45.920]  me and now i'm not scared anymore i have to say i was blown away i feel so much better every day
[58:45.920 --> 58:50.320]  listening to it to alex thank you very much for putting the course together you're absolutely
[58:50.320 --> 58:57.280]  right we are reflections of god we are emanations of that and we can use that god energy to do
[58:57.280 --> 59:01.680]  really anything we want to do in this life roman's chapter 12 paul talks about how we're
[59:01.680 --> 59:06.240]  transformed by the renewing of our mind and that's a process most of our thoughts and
[59:06.240 --> 59:10.880]  actions are subconscious most people go through their day and don't think about many things you
[59:10.880 --> 59:16.160]  can drive along a long journey and not even remember half the trip in this process we need to have a
[59:16.160 --> 59:22.000]  concerted active effort physically and mentally to reprogram that subconscious mind that's what
[59:22.000 --> 59:28.160]  this series is about is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our mind he's exactly right
[59:28.160 --> 59:33.520]  and he's become a great voice in our generation and in this new great awakening and i encourage
[59:33.520 --> 59:38.560]  everybody out there if you haven't gone there yet go to reset wars dot com that's where your journey
[59:38.560 --> 59:48.560]  begins
[59:48.560 --> 1:00:08.560]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:22.560]  here's what we're going to do
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:28.800]  ladies and gentlemen we're going to air a very important report dealing with the wheels coming
[1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:35.680]  off the establishment co booster shots diminish immune system our great wilson did a report on
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:39.040]  this that we're going to air her in just a moment and i'm going to come back and i'm going to cover
[1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:44.320]  news and play clubs and try to talk a little bit dr steve schenick was going to be on today but he
[1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:48.800]  had some type of family you see he said he won't be back for two weeks and so i'm gonna get him back
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:52.880]  on in two weeks when he gets back but joel scowl's and i've been trying to get on for a month
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:56.880]  he's gonna be joining us but first here's wilson's report you can find it banned on video
[1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:08.960]  on january 11th the european union's drug regulator the european medicines agency
[1:01:08.960 --> 1:01:15.280]  cast doubt on the continual use of covet booster shots although they overwhelmingly advocate for
[1:01:15.280 --> 1:01:21.360]  the use of covet vaccines and praise their effectiveness marco cavallari the ema's head of
[1:01:21.360 --> 1:01:27.920]  biological health threats and vaccine strategy explains last week in a briefing while use of
[1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:34.720]  an additional booster shot could be considered as part of a contingency plan repeated vaccinations
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:40.720]  within short intervals will not represent a sustainable long-term strategy and the world
[1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:47.200]  health organization's head tedros agreed with this assessment the very next day tag covac
[1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:53.760]  also said that a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine
[1:01:53.760 --> 1:02:01.520]  composition is unlikely to be sustainable later during that same press briefing marco cavallari
[1:02:01.520 --> 1:02:06.640]  stated that the agency was concerned about continually giving booster shots within a
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:12.640]  short amount of time just as the whole world has been doing we have not seen yet data with respect
[1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:19.520]  to a fourth dose and we would like to see this data before we can make any recommendation but at
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:25.440]  the same times we are rather concerned about a strategy that entangles repeated vaccination
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:32.320]  within a short term so this is something that should be part of of an overarching strategy
[1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:38.400]  on what could be the best strategy for vaccination over time making clear that we cannot really
[1:02:38.400 --> 1:02:45.120]  continuously give a booster dose every three four months on january 18th the european medicines
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:51.120]  agency held another press briefing where cavallari finally admitted that the covet booster shots
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:56.720]  reduced the level of antibodies in its recipients i would like also to take the opportunity to
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:02.720]  again clarify our current position on multiple booster doses the repeated administration of
[1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:09.040]  boosters with very short interval might reduce the level of antibodies that can be produced at
[1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:14.720]  each administration as our immune system needs a certain amount of time to mature the response
[1:03:14.720 --> 1:03:20.320]  to the antigens it is presented with so potentially making the vaccination a little bit less
[1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:27.200]  efficient over time not only is this not new news but this has been known for months as dr
[1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:33.520]  david bower a virologist from the frances crick institute explained about the phaser vaccine
[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:40.560]  in june 2021 so the key message from our finding is that we found that recipients of the phaser
[1:03:40.560 --> 1:03:47.200]  vaccine those who've had two doses have about five to six fold lower amounts of neutralizing
[1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:52.400]  antibodies now these are the sort of gold standard private security antibodies of your
[1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:57.280]  immune system which block the virus from getting into your cells in the first place
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.240]  and so we found that that's less for people with two doses we've also found that for people with
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:08.400]  only one dose of the phaser jab that they are less likely to have high levels of these antibodies
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:13.680]  in their blood and perhaps most importantly for all of us going forward is that we see that the
[1:04:13.680 --> 1:04:20.000]  older you are the lower your levels are likely to be and the time since you've had your second jab
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:26.640]  as that time goes on the lower your levels are also likely to be so if the vaccines lower immunity
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:32.240]  and this information is being shared from scientists to the european medicines agency
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:38.880]  to the world health organization then what is the real motivation behind the booster politics
[1:04:38.880 --> 1:04:46.160]  money death all i know is that the booster shots are officially busted this is brian wilson with

[1:06:25.440 --> 1:06:27.920]  well here's some of the headlines and they are bombshell
[1:06:29.600 --> 1:06:37.360]  cdc admits natural immunity superior to vaccinated immunity alone and preventing covid
[1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:43.760]  hospitalizations and deaths now that's what the israeli study said 13 to 27 times better a year ago
[1:06:43.760 --> 1:06:53.200]  and it's just another major official cdc study cdc.gov finding that it is just orders of magnitude
[1:06:53.200 --> 1:06:58.800]  better and doesn't destroy your immune system later like the covid shots do but that's just
[1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:07.360]  science you know i mean what's your source on that other cdc the ncaa stuns the sports world
[1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:13.280]  by admitting natural immunity is real oh my gosh they admit the moon's real or maybe the sun's real
[1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:17.840]  or maybe they're real oh i mean i love how we're having a debate cuz facebook and twitter and
[1:07:17.840 --> 1:07:22.560]  google wouldn't let you say that natural immunity for the last 20-something months exist remember
[1:07:22.560 --> 1:07:28.080]  i mean rand paul a doctor said it's better and read studies and he got censored off google youtube
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:38.880]  for that and saying mass don't work i mean oh my gosh did you know that the ncaa now admits
[1:07:38.880 --> 1:07:44.080]  natural immunity exists that we live before we had antibiotics and shots and then antibiotics and
[1:07:44.080 --> 1:07:48.960]  shots may work as a stop gap but overall lower our general health and immunity which we all know
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:55.600]  vaccines and antibiotics work pretty good whether or not tender to have problems especially the
[1:07:55.600 --> 1:08:01.440]  shots but then they kill you down the road and they're connected to cancer especially the vaccines
[1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:09.520]  so it just continues ladies and gentlemen they're now saying okay yeah we uh we count natural
[1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:12.720]  immunity and we're not going to try to keep people out of the football games and we're
[1:08:12.720 --> 1:08:16.400]  going to keep players out and all the rest of this stuff and you know we just got to go ahead
[1:08:16.400 --> 1:08:23.200]  and get this and get over it then our body learns how to defeat it absolutely insane
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:29.520]  and it continues coming up we have a first look at biden's inaugural tv program to tell you how
[1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:38.880]  great the economy is and how wonderful it all is that's uh coming up with tom hanks in the last
[1:08:38.880 --> 1:08:54.960]  segment of this hour but right now i wanted to shift gears into joe biden and his ukraine statement
[1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:03.200]  and if you want to know the type of statements that start wars this is it if i wanted to start a
[1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:11.840]  war with russia i would have a stumbling dottering person clearly with dementia a dirty old pervert
[1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:18.320]  pedophile man licking his lips and stumbling around and not knowing where he is minute to minute
[1:09:19.280 --> 1:09:23.920]  sending troops in to surround russia all over its western border with europe
[1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:31.680]  with the head of nato and top u.s general saying we're ready to nuke russia first and u.s senators
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:42.720]  saying we may nuke russia and and nuclear war is survivable this isn't stanley cubrick's 1964
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:47.040]  dr strange love where you had general saying that hypothetically this is actually happening
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:53.840]  of course that was based on kurtis lemay ahead of the air force famously saying that to congress
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:10:01.040]  it was based on something real and so now he's come out said well the incursion isn't too deep
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:08.720]  we may not do anything well they've got to make a land bridge to Crimea that they've already seized
[1:10:08.720 --> 1:10:13.360]  to supply because the global of six years ago started a civil war in ukraine and this is on
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:22.640]  not russia's doorstep but in its birthplace russia started in ukraine it started
[1:10:26.560 --> 1:10:31.840]  in eastern ukraine and they need that land bridge
[1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:41.440]  and then you control of that port they've got there and it's a strategic thing for the russians
[1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:47.520]  to have that land bridge to Crimea and so a statement where you're building force and you're
[1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:52.880]  threatening to attack through all your surrogates but then you say go ahead putin i won't get too
[1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:59.920]  upset if you just take over part of ukraine is just just absolutely over the top but that's what
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:06.160]  happens when you've got a globalist elite that owns the media the banks feels invincible put a
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:11.520]  puppet up there to discredit the presidency but now he's a little too brain dead and the wheels
[1:11:11.520 --> 1:11:17.360]  are coming off this thing i mean this is a disaster here it is you've talked foreign policy advisors
[1:11:17.360 --> 1:11:22.560]  have warned that russia is now ready to attack ukraine but there's still a little unity among
[1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:27.440]  european allies about what a package of sanctions against moscow would look like if the u.s and
[1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:31.680]  nato aren't willing to put troops on the line to defend ukraine and american allies can't agree on
[1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:37.920]  a sanctions package hasn't the u.s in the west lost nearly all of its leverage over vladimir
[1:11:37.920 --> 1:11:44.640]  putin and uh given how ineffective sanctions have been in deterring putin in the past why should
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:51.120]  the threat of new sanctions give him pause well because he's never seen sanctions like the ones
[1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:58.400]  i promised will be imposed if he moves number one number two we're in a situation where uh
[1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:06.000]  vladimir putin is about to uh we've had very frank discussions uh vladimir putin and i and uh
[1:12:06.880 --> 1:12:12.960]  the idea that nato is not going to be united i don't buy i've spoken to every major nato leader
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:20.720]  we've had the nato russian summit we've had other the oscee is met etc and so i think what you're
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:28.320]  going to see is that russia will be held accountable if it invades and it depends on what it does it's
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:33.840]  one thing if it's a minor incursion and then we end up having a fight about what to do and not do
[1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:39.440]  etc but if they actually do what they're capable of doing with the force of mass on the border
[1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:45.760]  it is going to be a disaster for russia if they further grade you invade ukraine and that our
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:53.760]  allies and partners are ready to impose severe cost and significant harm on russia yeah they'll do
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:58.960]  stuff like cut the gas pipelines out of russia into europe so everybody freezes the death and
[1:13:00.240 --> 1:13:03.520]  you know pays triple the prices i mean it's always the same thing with these people
[1:13:04.240 --> 1:13:09.120]  and i'm not a rooster fowl but if russia was on our border doing this i would be against russia and
[1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:16.240]  the ideologues running our country are more like the soviet russians and vladimir putin is by a
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:24.560]  long shot so i'm an ideological person i deal with what people stand for and if there was a country
[1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:31.760]  freer and bettered america i would go there and rapidly the country is becoming unfree but yeah
[1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:37.120]  it's that famous meme russia wants war look how close they put their country to our military basis
[1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:40.400]  and if it was an evil country
[1:13:40.400 --> 1:13:47.200]  then i would be opposed to it but it's not compared to what we have running our country
[1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:50.880]  you know here's another example of how out of his mind by this here he is just a few days ago
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:56.400]  at a pennsylvania rally this is real footage here it is my grandpa was named andro andros finigan
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:04.880]  as kitchen table i learned my ears to say my ears to say joey nobody's better than you but you're
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:10.240]  no better than anybody else maybe it's a scranton you got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder
[1:14:10.240 --> 1:14:15.280]  worried about what they can make next month's mortgage payment well it is what it is because
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:23.920]  he was who he is that's why it is what it is he was who he is you know remember what he went on
[1:14:23.920 --> 1:14:30.320]  he decided he was going to convince bob woodward what a smart guy he was so he went on yeah smart
[1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:36.560]  guy i'll lead an effective strategy to mobilize true and international pressure isolated plenty's
[1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:43.280]  china folks true international pressure let's stop there that's actually from the campaign
[1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:47.280]  trail there's another similar clip i had here i sit in the wrong clip there's so many of these
[1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:54.800]  ladies and gentlemen that it just boggles boggles the mind but this is a designed collapse of the
[1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:01.200]  world and i go back to the fact what are we going to do to stop it it's very very simple
[1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:07.040]  and and the globalists are acting like they're about to back off the pandemic back off the
[1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:14.320]  lockdowns back off the controls back off the the the the vaccine passports but they're going to do
[1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:18.320]  no such thing they're going to act like they are they bring it right back this is a psychological
[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:22.400]  tactic so let's just get aware that we pushed them back and they always had a plan that if we
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:26.000]  pushed them back to where we were going to have a moment of unification defeat of them they'd back
[1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:33.200]  off and let's just keep pushing when our enemy backs off we don't back off we move forward but
[1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:40.080]  i want to show you the disgusting hollywood defense of joe biden and the destruction of this country

[1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:27.040]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well so does he lie
[1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:36.720]  from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[1:33:39.920 --> 1:33:45.520]  you know i get really mad at the globalist and how cynical they are and how out of control they are
[1:33:46.880 --> 1:33:52.160]  and if you just joined us the last segment i played a government funded taxpayer paid for
[1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:59.040]  hollywood attack job on america and i i got emotional and i called tom hanks names and
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:04.000]  things instead let's play it again before i get to tucker carlson and let's analyze the
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:11.840]  real lies in it because i was thinking about this when i saw this this morning and i didn't make the
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:18.640]  main point and then thank god our main producer scott said hey you know the biggest lie in that
[1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:23.200]  piece during the break and i said no and he said they're the ones that tried to keep the economy
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:26.480]  closed they're the ones that tried to make everybody take the shots they're the ones that
[1:34:26.480 --> 1:34:30.640]  tried to make everybody wear the mask and then now they're here taking credit that everybody
[1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:38.960]  pushed back and said no that's mind control and we have the highest jobless claims ever recorded
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:47.040]  in modern history since the great depression and everything they say is a lie but the people
[1:34:47.040 --> 1:34:50.640]  perish for lack of knowledge because i talked to the average person even people that have good
[1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:56.560]  jobs and have degrees and things they they don't know how stuff works you're not tell people
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:35:01.600]  the family and friends they go hey you know documents came out they produced the the wuhan
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:06.640]  virus covered 19 years before at the lab and that they also sought the pentagon authorization to
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:11.520]  release it in china uh and that they they they scribe it as the exact virus is covered 19 people
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:16.240]  just shake their head they go Alex that can't be true the hell it ain't true thousands of documents
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:24.000]  are public so i mean it's almost like beating a dead horse folks if you don't say no to this
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:31.280]  and you don't reject it you're crazy and the biggest thing is quit pretending it's like that uh
[1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:37.760]  that woman gets it that lawyer that black lawyer there in new york who's been a teacher and a
[1:35:37.760 --> 1:35:44.480]  lawyer and worked in the system and she said the system's broken it is it for you tear it all down
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:49.200]  she said you got your government jobs you got your other jobs you think you're going along with this
[1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:57.840]  and it's giving you a future it's destroying your future in fact i want to air oh i'm getting so
[1:35:57.840 --> 1:36:02.800]  angry right now because man all we got to do is wake up and come together and realize we're all
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:08.320]  under attack and that big banks and big universities and big media work for the worst people and
[1:36:08.320 --> 1:36:11.920]  they're telling us to fight over what color we are while they claim they want to stop racism
[1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:15.920]  and they're telling us to fight over where we're from in the u.s or they're telling us to fight
[1:36:15.920 --> 1:36:21.760]  over who hadn't had a shot and who has when these damn people are the worst criminals the world has
[1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:33.280]  ever seen let's play her again i played her last hour but this is uh lawyer trisha lindsey and
[1:36:33.280 --> 1:36:37.280]  and of course there's antefa back there blowing whistles trying to keep her from being able to
[1:36:37.280 --> 1:36:42.800]  be heard anywhere you go to protest force inoculations or tyranny there's the left there
[1:36:42.800 --> 1:36:47.440]  blowing their whistles so you can't be heard because they're not that they're authoritarian
[1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:52.720]  garbage but through the whistles you still hear her voice here it is you want to take my children
[1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:57.520]  into a room and give them a snicker bar and some damn fright and talk about come get this that
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:08.000]  feed that's right you don't have control of my children you don't have control of me they shut
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:20.960]  out doors and try to give her god Fauci to hell with the criminal surrendering their pulpits to

[1:37:45.600 --> 1:37:50.800]  compliance yeah they stopped teaching them to think analytical thought went out the window
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:55.920]  with state exams yeah those state exams were just being used to track your children to determine
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:01.040]  who's going to college to train them to support this god for getting the god forsaken system
[1:38:01.040 --> 1:38:06.800]  all the rest they're going elsewhere they have pushed their state to prison i don't care how you

[1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:58.800]  these desperate families locked up for two years having their jobs destroyed having their whole
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:05.920]  future destroyed designed to make them depressed designed to make you not have children and then

[1:39:55.200 --> 1:40:02.480]  they're the ones at every level doing this this is an assault and their responses if you don't

[1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:35.680]  because they had iodine deficiencies remember the u.s government when it finally was good for a while
[1:41:35.680 --> 1:41:41.040]  i guess in the 40s started putting it in the salt and iq's went up on average of 15 points in the
[1:41:41.040 --> 1:41:47.280]  midwest where they didn't get enough iodine from fish and fertility went way up and burt defects
[1:41:47.280 --> 1:41:51.600]  went way down and then in the 80s they took it back out for whatever reason uh but that's the
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:56.080]  crappy iodine this is the good iodine it's going to sell out the next two days we don't get more

[1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:55.120]  hit something essential for your body and your health and your longevity and your immune system
[1:43:55.120 --> 1:44:00.240]  while funding the info war at info war store dot com so when i first started taking survival
[1:44:00.240 --> 1:44:05.680]  shield basically i was 275 pounds i was overweight i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was
[1:44:05.680 --> 1:44:10.480]  barely holding on to a job and i heard dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one
[1:44:10.480 --> 1:44:15.600]  i got was the original survival shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter
[1:44:15.600 --> 1:44:19.040]  you came out with that you had you know with a deep burning source you know and i got really
[1:44:19.040 --> 1:44:24.480]  excited about that so i took it and man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:30.000]  like my brain was enlightened you know i could think again i could connect with people again
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:35.440]  and over the course of the next couple of years i got my health back and i religiously take basically
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:39.440]  all of your supplements they're they're all absolutely amazing supplements the one i like
[1:44:39.440 --> 1:44:44.080]  recently is knockout it literally like if you want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:49.200]  but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves clean it's a break free of the globalist system
[1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:54.080]  and the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hand beautifully said brother
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:45:01.680]  i thank you so much for calling godspeed it's only been in the last 60 years that we've had
[1:45:01.680 --> 1:45:07.120]  satellites that can decently measure what's happening in the atmosphere but if you look
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:10.800]  at all the different studies reports about my nasa and other governments other agencies
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:16.400]  they all disagree on what's really happening with the client the only constant the only great truth
[1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:23.600]  is change is the only constant so yes climate change is totally real but notice first they
[1:45:23.600 --> 1:45:27.920]  called it global freezing back in the 70s 80s and then it's gonna be global warming and when that
[1:45:27.920 --> 1:45:32.560]  didn't really happen the way they wanted to okay now it's just climate change but did you know that
[1:45:32.560 --> 1:45:38.560]  man-made climate change is a real thing when it comes to the united nations and the department
[1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:44.880]  of energy and bill gates and the un they have weather control trees for 1979 and bill gates has
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:49.920]  been manipulating the weather for a very long time in fact back in 1994 two scientists wanted
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:54.240]  a Nobel prize for an idea of spring different particles out of jet engines to control the
[1:45:54.240 --> 1:46:03.200]  weather so yes man-made climate change is real get our great bag of it here i mean this is from
[1:46:03.200 --> 1:46:08.160]  people say why is it from Chiapas Mexico the communists well that's where some of the best
[1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:13.840]  coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil better than guatemalan
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:18.080]  coffee and yeah we buy it from the little farmers that you know the media calls communist but really
[1:46:18.080 --> 1:46:22.320]  they're just a commune and whatever the point is is that it's good coffee and we've got it and the
[1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:26.000]  farmers don't let the mexican government take over so i actually buy this from the mexican rebels
[1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:29.600]  and i've been buying it for what 14 years and the price has never gone up the same stuff sold at
[1:46:29.600 --> 1:46:34.080]  Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more for pound and i just think it's some of the best
[1:46:34.080 --> 1:46:38.640]  coffee you're gonna find anywhere it's wake up america patriot blend from the Chiapas rebels
[1:46:38.640 --> 1:46:46.880]  literally um in fact i'm gonna tell you a little story um we had like that okay you want to believe
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:51.920]  it anyway so it's info war store dot com and that's how we fund this operation and if you
[1:46:51.920 --> 1:46:53.520]  don't find us you don't want to see that's fine
[1:46:53.520 --> 1:47:17.360]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:47:17.360 --> 1:47:25.920]  the spell is gone nobody buys into the hollywood system or corporate media anymore
[1:47:27.680 --> 1:47:32.880]  so what are they going to do they're going to bring in tyranny and outlaw not agreeing with them
[1:47:32.880 --> 1:47:37.280]  they're going to make us love them like we're a battered woman trying to pack our bags and get
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:43.200]  out of the house well nick point has has been on a no-fly list for coming up on a year soon
[1:47:43.200 --> 1:47:47.920]  and uh that's going to the courts right now you know why it was on a no-fly list but now
[1:47:47.920 --> 1:47:57.920]  we get a good idea nbc news associated press you name it the american first term articulate
[1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:03.680]  young sharp is a threat to the establishment january 6 committee subpoenas too far right
[1:48:03.680 --> 1:48:11.200]  wing activists including nick point as and it says he's under investigation because he took a bitcoin
[1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:22.960]  donation oh my goodness so he's definitely in that 1776 club getting persecuted i appreciate
[1:48:22.960 --> 1:48:30.480]  him on short notice coming on i've been subpoenaed by him they ask questions like give us every time
[1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:36.640]  you ever talked about the election impossible stuff then you didn't give us what we wanted just
[1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:43.840]  like the sandy hook thing that's how it works the weaponization of the judiciary and now the
[1:48:43.840 --> 1:48:53.600]  legislative as a judiciary acting as the executive north korea can't even a lot of candle to this
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:59.760]  nick point as joins us in battled uh banned off the internet just like us except for info wars
[1:48:59.760 --> 1:49:04.080]  dot com and he's got his cider but you check out put it on screen a moment nick thanks for coming
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:08.240]  on wow so now you're starting to find out what a thought criminal you are even though you didn't
[1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:12.640]  go in the capital you didn't call for breaching it you were i saw you there you weren't doing
[1:49:12.640 --> 1:49:18.560]  anything wrong just like us but you're a bad person that's right well hello alex great to be
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:23.280]  with you yeah and it's pretty amazing because the letter is public i mean they published the
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:29.040]  letter yesterday on twitter and it's in you know republished in all the media and even you read
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:33.840]  through their letter on why they're issuing this opinion towards me compelling me to testify
[1:49:33.840 --> 1:49:38.880]  and they acknowledge in the letter there's no criminal wrongdoing they acknowledge in the letter
[1:49:38.880 --> 1:49:44.160]  he's not in the capital and like he said earlier they go through and they list the main points
[1:49:44.160 --> 1:49:49.040]  they said well he gave some speeches he said this and that oh and he received some bitcoin
[1:49:49.040 --> 1:49:53.920]  you know so what really is the law enforcement interest in a person like me because what i
[1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:58.880]  i exercise my first amendment and receive a donation you know it just goes to show what
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:03.760]  a witch hunt this is the really digging down to the bottom of the barrel here you know you go from
[1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:09.120]  they subpoena the chief of staff and people the administration and everything like that
[1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:13.600]  and here we are a year later and what have they got now it's you know a live streamer like me who
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:19.520]  wasn't who they acknowledge was not even inside uh compelling me to testify it's just if that's not
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:24.160]  as ridiculous as it gets i mean who are they gonna subpoena next they're gonna subpoena like a
[1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:30.000]  garbage guy who was collecting trash the next day i appreciate your confidence but you know they
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:34.080]  put you on a fly list they're talking about your criminal taking bitcoin which is totally legal
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:38.880]  and i've talked to multiple people that have been before the committee and they literally ask about
[1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:45.760]  tell us about alex jones this secret meeting with trump before january 6 didn't happen tell us about
[1:50:45.760 --> 1:50:50.160]  you know the meetings where you met with steve bannon to plan the attack didn't i never met with
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:55.680]  steve bannon what i'm saying is it's just they don't and even when they know it's not true they just
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:02.080]  don't stop nick where do you see all this going well what i'm concerned about is that they're
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:07.680]  building up towards maybe trying to convict president trump of something i think that oh yeah
[1:51:07.680 --> 1:51:11.840]  that's what the committee said yesterday they said we're they said we've talked to the just
[1:51:11.840 --> 1:51:16.160]  department and they're gunning and dying for conspiracy well for there to be a conspiracy
[1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:22.320]  that means he's got cohorts well i sure as hell no we weren't involved yeah absolutely i mean i
[1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:26.720]  would i wish we were talking to the trump administration but i know i wasn't i wasn't in
[1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:31.360]  touch with any of these people but but ultimately i think that's where this is headed and i think
[1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:37.600]  that there's nothing there but as you know conspiracy is such a broad statute and i think
[1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:41.920]  they're going through turning over every stone going through every person even even down to
[1:51:41.920 --> 1:51:46.160]  somebody like me who clearly had no involvement and like you said they know that i mean they're
[1:51:46.160 --> 1:51:51.120]  spying on us they said they out they surveil us they probably know more about our involvement
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:55.520]  than we do and so you know they've exonerated us before we even begin to submit documents or
[1:51:55.520 --> 1:52:00.160]  anything like that but i think that you know they're trying to get all these little bits and
[1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:04.800]  pieces together and ultimately it's leading towards trying to get trump and preventing him
[1:52:04.800 --> 1:52:09.840]  from running in 24 i think that's the end game of this whole thing well i don't think that's
[1:52:09.840 --> 1:52:13.120]  that's not your opinion that's well said you would say that for months but but the head of
[1:52:13.120 --> 1:52:18.080]  the committee came out i'm sure you saw the statement yesterday he put a he put a statement
[1:52:18.080 --> 1:52:23.360]  out saying we are gonna indict trump which totally discredits him if he's this impartial
[1:52:23.360 --> 1:52:27.520]  investigative body that claims you know they're doing this for election integrity and they're
[1:52:27.520 --> 1:52:33.680]  saying we know trump's guilty and he's suing trump it makes it a total fraud well yeah because it
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:37.760]  just shows that it's political you know they're trying to come at it with this angle that this
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:43.040]  is 9 11 and we've got to investigate it's got nothing to do with an investigation this is a
[1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:47.280]  political witch hunt and they're going after political targets and you know the thing is and
[1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:51.600]  trump said this before i left office he said really they're coming for the american people
[1:52:51.600 --> 1:52:56.800]  and i'm just in the way and the scary thing is they're not going to stop at trump they're coming
[1:52:56.800 --> 1:53:01.440]  for him because he's the big fish and he's the presumptive nominee if he decides to run in 24
[1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:06.480]  well that's right once they get trump every other pro trump american is a co-conspirator
[1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:12.080]  they're outlawing the republican party that's right and and they're going after the base that
[1:53:12.080 --> 1:53:17.440]  elected donald trump i mean when we elected donald trump at 16 we repudiated the globalist
[1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:23.040]  establishment we repudiated their rule their consensus on liberalism and all this and so
[1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:27.920]  they come after trump and now they're trying to blow up his base which propelled him into power
[1:53:27.920 --> 1:53:33.920]  in the first place and what they want is the you know the slave class of mass wearers back stuff
[1:53:33.920 --> 1:53:39.600]  eggs liberal media watchers that's who they want to rule over and preside over instead of like
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:46.640]  you said the 1776 club freedom loving christian patriots so so the end game is go for trump
[1:53:46.640 --> 1:53:50.640]  go for the the organization cut the snake's head off and then they're going to come for
[1:53:50.640 --> 1:53:55.040]  everybody and they're going to criminalize you know being conservative being a patriot that
[1:53:55.040 --> 1:54:00.320]  that's where this all is headed this sort of uh nine eleven style commission business expansion
[1:54:00.320 --> 1:54:05.360]  of surveillance power expansion of federal law enforcement jurisdiction the end game is to make
[1:54:05.360 --> 1:54:09.920]  it illicit and illegal to do things like you know what they've been doing questioning the election
[1:54:09.920 --> 1:54:15.760]  integrity questioning the efficacy of the backs etc etc they want to criminalize anybody that defies
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:21.600]  their their system and the propaganda they're pushing so there really is uh you know it's you
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:26.080]  and it's you and i and it's trump and we're on the front lines but ultimately everybody here is
[1:54:26.080 --> 1:54:31.280]  affected we're just avatars of the people really that's right we're symbols of the people that the
[1:54:31.280 --> 1:54:36.240]  system hates and the systems hate of nick pointe as our alec shows general trump is a symbol of
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:42.000]  their hatred for the general population but you're absolutely right they are all over the news saying
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:46.800]  we're running on terror we're running on bang the republican party uh biden has been in press
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:51.200]  conferences we put it on screen saying well there won't even be a republican party in a couple years
[1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:55.440]  we're going to outlaw it and even mich mcconnell last week said whoa you're calling us domestic
[1:54:55.440 --> 1:55:00.000]  enemies i think the democrats are biting off way more than they could shoot nick
[1:55:01.520 --> 1:55:06.000]  they are and it's already backfiring and and even because you know i'm very skeptical of
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:12.240]  congressional and senate republicans i know you are too and and even in the congress even in the
[1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:17.680]  senate you're seeing some of these republicans fed crews who last last week two weeks ago
[1:55:17.680 --> 1:55:23.040]  he was saying one six was a terrorist attack then he's putting the screws to the fbi and asking about
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:28.080]  re-apps and so even like you said even someone like mitch mcconnell who i have absolutely
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:33.360]  no faith and no confidence that even him is saying whoa you know pump the brakes and so
[1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:37.520]  they're starting to be this pushback they're looking into the mistreatment of the prisoners of
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:42.960]  one six they're looking into this law enforcement connection which is real and you know it's almost
[1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:48.160]  like oh they admit a thousand government commandos watched as we tried to stop people entering the
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:54.720]  capital the fbi and the pentagon just sat there and watched it happen well and that's just what
[1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:59.040]  they'll admit that's just what they'll admit but you know as well as anybody that if they're
[1:55:59.040 --> 1:56:04.160]  infiltrating all these groups and if they've got assets oh i mean i know how they probably had
[1:56:04.160 --> 1:56:10.720]  50 000 troops there easily easily and not only did they watch and see it but i'm sure they were
[1:56:10.720 --> 1:56:15.040]  instigating i'm sure they were probably involved in planning you know whatever elicit activities
[1:56:15.040 --> 1:56:21.280]  there might have been you know they had their hands all over the tip of the iceberg yes yes and it
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:28.080]  goes way way deeper and so point being you know these republicans even in congress who i i'm just
[1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:33.600]  have no expectations for them even now they're beginning to push back and and it's slowing down
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:37.520]  this committee it's slowing things down and and you're right they bit off way more than they can
[1:56:37.520 --> 1:56:43.040]  chew and i think 2022 is going to be a big surprise for them i think it's going to be a big republican
[1:56:43.040 --> 1:56:48.720]  wave and 24 it's sort of like to me that's like the last shot if we could get a good outcome and
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:54.640]  24 we can clean house blow up i agree but they know that next let's do five more minutes
[1:56:55.360 --> 1:57:00.320]  what are obviously they're not going to let us have this election with 292 days left i mean
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:04.560]  they're going to pull some major crap uh but before we go to break because it's important

[2:01:01.040 --> 2:01:06.000]  it's just this is all winding down and i've been just raising the red alert on my show all day long
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:10.640]  about you know this vaccine mandate stuff is here to stay that's one of the big things i've been

[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:23.040]  i think they were just on pin pool last night i've been banned on getter now for about a month or so
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:27.360]  and uh been been trying to get myself i don't think that's good i you know i think that's because

[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:37.120]  againer and try to like clear the air and get you on there yeah no that'd be great i you know
[2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:42.240]  because i just saw they were on pin pool and uh you know they did this interview and i saw jason
[2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:46.320]  miller was on there and he goes well you know once this is banned because he's this white
[2:01:46.320 --> 2:01:51.200]  nationalist and they go you know well how's he's a white nationalist and he's like oh i don't know
[2:01:51.200 --> 2:01:56.720]  i mean the adl said so like so yeah i mean clearing the air would be great because when i'm sitting
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:02:01.520]  here like well we're taking the adl's word for it come on man i thought you know we're the
[2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:08.960]  conservative side so i've been covering that a lot on my show as well well everybody's done with
[2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:12.880]  hollywood everybody's done with the democrats everybody's done with the new world order and
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:16.960]  the new world order is going to try to stay in power and they're going to fail and so everybody
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:21.120]  better just decide to go on the right side of history and stop hiding in the weeds because
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:27.200]  that's why we got here uh nick point as again tell us i love what you're doing because i i see you

[2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:39.760]  have you launched a streaming platform not just for you but others yes yeah it's called cozy.tv
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:46.720]  we're still in our beta phase so we're trying to achieve feature parity with uh twitch d live you
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:51.360]  know we're trying to get all the same features that they have on their services well you allow me
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:57.840]  on there but you won't censor me will you oh of course no i'll come work for you that's my answer
[2:02:57.840 --> 2:03:02.080]  so tell me i'm gonna come work for nick point as i'm being somewhat sarcastic but i'm serious in a
[2:03:02.080 --> 2:03:10.720]  way uh tell me about this beautiful new platform yeah oh you're hired well um yeah so it's cozy tv
[2:03:10.720 --> 2:03:16.160]  and yeah the goal is to create something that's for us you know for patriots for conservatives
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:21.440]  you know we love band on video i always tell my viewers to go watch my videos on on my channel
[2:03:21.440 --> 2:03:26.320]  there and of course check out info wars and your show and olyn and erison and everything yeah but
[2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:30.400]  the more the merrier and the fact that you're actually launching like trump's got billions of
[2:03:30.400 --> 2:03:35.520]  dollars for this startup he can't do this but you're doing it yeah no it's it's been pretty
[2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:40.640]  incredible you know we've got this developer team and it's just full of these devon kids i mean like
[2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:46.320]  zoomers and they built this thing really all by themselves we have no investment we've got no backers
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:51.360]  no institutional backing but we've just got some brilliant young kids they put this thing that means
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:56.800]  my age but we put this thing together and now we have i think it's two or three dozen streamers on
[2:03:56.800 --> 2:04:02.720]  there um last night we just broke the record i think i had eleven eleven three hundred eleven
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:07.280]  thousand three hundred live viewers um but we have to build it because like you said there's nothing
[2:04:07.280 --> 2:04:13.040]  out there for live streaming and trump with all his billions and all these other republicans they
[2:04:13.040 --> 2:04:19.280]  complain about censorship all day long they do nothing about it that's right so cozy.tv forward

[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:17.840]  terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal
[2:05:17.840 --> 2:05:23.440]  to oppose them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us
[2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:29.920]  and make us go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated
[2:05:29.920 --> 2:05:35.520]  up in camps the traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the
[2:05:35.520 --> 2:05:42.800]  awakening exponentially so be it make them silence us by force this is the final battle
[2:05:42.800 --> 2:05:51.200]  of the information war give now buy products donate before everything changes we need you
[2:05:51.200 --> 2:06:07.120]  to carry us through to the end victory or death go now to infowarstore.com
[2:06:07.120 --> 2:06:25.040]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[2:06:27.520 --> 2:06:33.040]  well he's an old friend of mine i've been interviewing him at least 23 24 years
[2:06:33.040 --> 2:06:39.680]  Joel Scalzen naval aviator means he landed on aircraft carriers in vietnam best-selling
[2:06:39.680 --> 2:06:49.360]  author researcher undoubtedly the top secure home builder i mean the guy's awesome his uncle
[2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:54.960]  was a famous fbi agent that exposed the whole new world order first my first introduction
[2:06:54.960 --> 2:06:59.600]  to the new world order was my grandfather having the book the naked communist and then reading it
[2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:05.520]  uh so he's here with us for the rest of the hour he's a political scientist by training
[2:07:05.520 --> 2:07:10.640]  i won't do his whole bio he really doesn't need need that to be done but i was sitting there
[2:07:10.640 --> 2:07:13.440]  during that one minute break before he came on i was thinking what's the most important thing to
[2:07:13.440 --> 2:07:18.480]  ask Joel Scalzen it's this who are the major power players in his view right now how is it going
[2:07:18.480 --> 2:07:24.560]  what's happening in ukraine what's going on with inflation what's happening with biden uh it's all
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:30.640]  these questions i mean it's just it's all coming through a crescendo in my view right now and i'm
[2:07:30.640 --> 2:07:35.040]  sure he's got issues that he wants to raise as well but joel great to have you on with us
[2:07:35.040 --> 2:07:39.120]  from world affairs brief people can go there and find your great daily newsletter and all the great
[2:07:39.120 --> 2:07:46.000]  work you're doing what do you think right now is front and center for all the people out there
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:55.760]  what is what is central on your radar screen well it's it's of course the puppet biden regime which
[2:07:55.760 --> 2:08:03.040]  is run by a whole host of globalists you know it used to be that uh every president had their
[2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:09.120]  handler one person generally like dick chaney ran the george w bush administration and uh
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:15.360]  uh you know henry kissinger ran the nixon administration they've all been these types of
[2:08:15.920 --> 2:08:21.360]  a puppet presence with a handler who was a globalist but now there are multiple handlers
[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:27.840]  around biden because he's an incompetent dementia-ridden puppet president but they still haven't
[2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:33.760]  stopped the major agenda and right now the biggest story coming out in friday's world affairs brief
[2:08:33.760 --> 2:08:40.240]  is going to be the imminent attack on ukraine by putin and that's what i'd like to address uh first
[2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:46.000]  of all uh i agree with you that's the most front and center thing and you've got a great uh marine
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  corps officer background you've got a real understanding of this this is huge yes it really
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:57.760]  is but as background your listeners have to understand something that only myself and christopher's
[2:08:57.760 --> 2:09:03.680]  story of england who's now deceased and warned about and that was that the fall of the soviet
[2:09:03.680 --> 2:09:08.320]  union was a carefully crafted deception the communist party simply went underground they
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:14.560]  gave orders for the various satellite countries to let these uh protests go forward and to take
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:20.800]  down the berlin wall but they always intended to rebuild the soviet union after they'd gained a lot
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:26.480]  of aid and trade from the west which has happened u.s oil companies for example rebuilt the entire
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:33.360]  russian oil industry and made them the oil powerhouse that has funded a lot of their new weapons
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:42.000]  acquisition this has been a 30 year reconstitution it has indeed and you know of course i knew that
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:47.360]  the globalists knew what i saw but they were supporting the phony fall of the soviet union
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:52.320]  because they wanted to build these enemies that's why they had been allowing china through the u.s
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:57.680]  department of commerce to steal and and get access to military technology for so many years
[2:09:57.680 --> 2:10:05.360]  they're building weapon building enemies so that they can have a third world war now as i've explained
[2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:12.400]  in my world affairs brief i do not believe that the russian uh taking back of ukraine will result
[2:10:12.400 --> 2:10:19.440]  in world war three uh only if the u.s were to directly attack russia and and counter it with
[2:10:19.440 --> 2:10:24.880]  military force which biden has already said he's not going to do it's off the table now that gives
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:31.520]  a green light to russia to do this the second green light that biden has said and this shocked
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:37.840]  ukrainian officials he said you know it wouldn't bother so much if it was just a minor incursion
[2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:45.120]  into ukraine uh only if it was a major intervention would we be you know really upset uh and the
[2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:50.480]  ukrainian officials were caught off guard with this remark because that to them was a green light
[2:10:50.480 --> 2:10:56.160]  that they could go ahead and and and try to take a portion of ukraine but i believe that there is
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:11:02.400]  evidence that they're setting up to take back the whole country and the reason i say this is that
[2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:08.720]  they've got ukraine surrounded now with troops major troop and armored deployments on three sides
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:15.680]  now it used to be just on the south with Crimea and in eastern ukraine which is the russian speaking
[2:11:16.400 --> 2:11:22.400]  portion of ukraine which russia is claiming they indigenously want to join back with russia
[2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:29.440]  so they did a stealth invasion you know several years ago in uh in eastern ukraine weren't able
[2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:34.480]  to consolidate it and now they're attempting to do it and the reason i believe that they're going
[2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:40.160]  to take back the whole country is for the first time they've got a massive amount of troops and
[2:11:40.160 --> 2:11:48.080]  armor stationed in Belarus directly to the north of the capital Kiev and this to me indicates that
[2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:54.960]  with Crimean forces on the south and landing ship forces heading into the black sea they could run a
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:12:01.280]  pincers movement meaning attack from the north in Belarus toward Kiev and from the south and
[2:12:01.280 --> 2:12:08.080]  actually cut off the country in two that's right actually it would cut the country one third and
[2:12:08.080 --> 2:12:15.440]  two thirds and the one third to the west really has nothing at all it's all concentrated in Kiev on
[2:12:15.440 --> 2:12:22.720]  east which is what they would capture in the in the in the pincers movement and so i'm i'm very
[2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:28.000]  much afraid that this is the real attack that's coming it's imminent it probably could happen
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:36.800]  within weeks another indication that the attack is imminent that the russians are taking diplomats
[2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:42.400]  and their and their families out of ukraine especially the Kiev embassy and several other
[2:12:42.400 --> 2:12:50.400]  consulates that's always a hard banger to toward war the u.s. does have a few special forces trainers
[2:12:50.400 --> 2:12:54.880]  in ukraine but the biden administration has already said that they would be pulled out
[2:12:54.880 --> 2:13:00.640]  at the initiation of hostilities this is another green light to Russia to say that we won't have
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:07.840]  any troops in there to justify uh coming to the defense defense of ukraine as i've said they would
[2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:15.680]  have to do if it were korea that were under attack because we have 27 000 troops in korea so while i
[2:13:15.680 --> 2:13:22.080]  don't think that this will be the trigger event for world war three i think it's a a similar situation
[2:13:22.080 --> 2:13:26.880]  to world war two when the west telegraphed to hitler that we wouldn't be upset if you took
[2:13:26.880 --> 2:13:35.600]  austria or Czechoslovakia and then put a red line down at uh at poland and which eventually triggered
[2:13:35.600 --> 2:13:44.000]  world war three uh so it's a very serious situation uh the u.s. has given some or authorized some
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:51.280]  200 million dollars in defensive aid to ukraine stating that we're going to help them stay in
[2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:56.800]  the battle with a much superior force well you know helping them stay in the battle only may
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:03.520]  prolong it but let me tell you what i think the scenario militarily is in ukraine it doesn't matter
[2:14:03.520 --> 2:14:09.680]  if britain is sending javelin anti tank missiles to ukraine it doesn't matter if the u.s. is sending
[2:14:09.680 --> 2:14:17.440]  stinger handheld anti aircraft missiles through estonia which they're doing uh the way that russia's
[2:14:17.440 --> 2:14:23.760]  going to win this war is a massive missile barrage first of all at all ukrainian military bases
[2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:33.760]  to neuter their radar detection uh their fighter capability and then they'll have air superiority
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:40.560]  over the entire country and in conventional war you you you can't win a war if the opposing nation
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:46.960]  has air superiority exactly they're gonna knock their air force out first that's right so that
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:52.960]  they can roam and you can't run a major tank battle when you've got uh the kind of air force that
[2:14:52.960 --> 2:14:59.360]  russia has with its tank killer uh forces in there and a few stinger missiles won't help either
[2:14:59.360 --> 2:15:04.960]  because russian military aircraft like our own have flares and other things to divert a stinger
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:11.040]  missile from attacking their aircraft so i think basically the war would be over within a week or
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:18.720]  two with massive russian missile forces uh annihilating the military capability and ukraine
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:23.040]  doesn't have anything in order to respond and the u.s. has said we're not going to send offensive
[2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:28.800]  missiles into ukraine because we don't want to do anything provocative i mean all of these signals
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:33.520]  you see telegraphs that the biden administration is going to let ukraine fall all right stay there
[2:15:33.520 --> 2:15:37.920]  we got to go to break joel scowson dot com world of first brief dot com we'll come back and talk
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:43.760]  about how historic this is and how dangerous this is we sell his book the strategic relocation dvd

[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:05.520]  meaning i like going to ball games i like going to concerts i like going to play golf i like going
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:12.000]  out to dinner i like the metropolitan life i like everything that comes with this but see i have
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  the survival instinct that is to get the hell out of democrat run cities get the hell out of major
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:24.000]  metropolitan areas because unless we change course soon it's all crashing down is it time to just move
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:28.160]  out to the woods just time to go get a piece of property in the woods just get off grid just get
[2:17:28.160 --> 2:17:32.320]  the emergency food supplies just live off the land that's the survival instinct but see the
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:37.200]  worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says no no no no stay in the

[2:20:13.360 --> 2:20:22.320]  world affairs brief we're talking about what's happening right now with this historic
[2:20:24.240 --> 2:20:29.840]  admission by the white house and others that rush is imminently about to invade troops
[2:20:30.960 --> 2:20:36.880]  on three sides of the country and i i agree i think that's what's about to happen putin says oh
[2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:44.720]  that's not about to happen and then we have ginsaki and general keen and all of all over tv saying
[2:20:44.720 --> 2:20:51.440]  false flags are imminent well i thought false flags didn't exist jose calison so so how does
[2:20:51.440 --> 2:20:57.120]  all this feed into it and do you think russia will stage a false flag to go in a and then be more
[2:20:57.120 --> 2:21:05.120]  importantly is this the anglo-american establishment luring the russians in to a project like you
[2:21:05.120 --> 2:21:08.640]  foretold that would be like the start of world war two is that what's happening
[2:21:10.480 --> 2:21:17.200]  well there's several questions involved in what you said first of all let me dispose of the notion
[2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:24.000]  that this is the west luring russia into an excuse to start world war three uh we have i have to
[2:21:24.000 --> 2:21:32.160]  counter oftentimes uh conservatives who talk about the us involvement in in the globalist in the
[2:21:32.160 --> 2:21:39.840]  maydan revolution uh which was the color revolution which basically uh supposedly ousted the russians
[2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:47.280]  from control over ukraine in 2014 in february but this isn't true at all in fact this was a false
[2:21:48.000 --> 2:21:52.720]  orange revolution just like it was the false phony demise of the soviet union
[2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:59.360]  because and we know this because the only reason the maydan and maydan refers to the main square
[2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:03.840]  in Kiev where the protests were taking place and of course the west was giving some support to the
[2:22:03.840 --> 2:22:11.040]  protesters but the key to this is that the only reason that the protesters won was because the
[2:22:11.040 --> 2:22:17.280]  berkut the riot police who were surrounding all the protesters someone told them to stay in their
[2:22:17.280 --> 2:22:23.120]  barracks on the friday that the protesters won now could the protesters have told the berkut
[2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:27.760]  to stay in their barracks could the western globalist have told the berkut to stay in their
[2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:33.440]  barracks no not at all only the communist government could have told the berkut to stay in their
[2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:38.240]  their barracks i mean this is a crucial piece of information that i put out on the world fairs
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:43.840]  brief and yet it doesn't get circulated why do known people continue to spread the information
[2:22:43.840 --> 2:22:48.080]  that the west is provoking this sure so so that'd be a false flag of its own so so let me make it
[2:22:48.080 --> 2:22:52.080]  more simple jokes i respect your opinion what is really going on just boil it down for us
[2:22:52.080 --> 2:23:00.400]  well the point is is that timoshenko and poroshenko and other you know so-called pro-independence
[2:23:00.400 --> 2:23:06.720]  nationalist ukrainian presidents we're in fact russian puppets just like we have globalist
[2:23:06.720 --> 2:23:11.280]  puppets in our country the russians play this game just as well as our our own globalist too
[2:23:11.280 --> 2:23:20.160]  but then again you know a couple of years ago president zolensky was elected and he is not
[2:23:20.160 --> 2:23:24.880]  and he is not a russian puppet he's legitimate he's a legitimate nationalist and that's one of the
[2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:30.320]  reasons why putin has to take back ukraine now because they don't have a puppet president in
[2:23:30.320 --> 2:23:36.720]  there he's really trying to help the country but the globalist if anything are letting it happen
[2:23:36.720 --> 2:23:42.880]  not because they are provoking it but because like in kuwait they basically gave the green light
[2:23:42.880 --> 2:23:49.680]  to sara mussein to invade korea so that it would be an excuse you know to do the iraq war but that
[2:23:49.680 --> 2:23:55.120]  wasn't world war three and this won't be world war three in my opinion because russia isn't ready
[2:23:56.720 --> 2:24:03.920]  but russia does want to have an excuse to invade uterine and so i believe it was legitimate
[2:24:03.920 --> 2:24:09.040]  that they were planning a false flag and of course the us that's like the pot the kettle
[2:24:09.040 --> 2:24:15.600]  calling the pot black the us is the prime instigator of false flag operations they've been doing it
[2:24:15.600 --> 2:24:20.160]  for a year ever since the spanish-american war the blowing up of the battleship main which was
[2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:27.200]  done by us operatives the pearl harbor of course was was provoked a world war one was provoked
[2:24:28.560 --> 2:24:35.200]  the vietnam war the gulf of tawkin incident was falsified 911 started the war on terror was a
[2:24:35.200 --> 2:24:40.480]  deep state operation from beginning to end so we are the champions of false flags now the
[2:24:40.480 --> 2:24:46.080]  russians have used them before too there were four bombings of apartments in four russian cities
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:54.080]  including moscow and they blamed it on the cheskin separatists in order to justify the cheskin war
[2:24:54.080 --> 2:24:59.600]  sure that was used to bring putin to power that's right that's how putin came to power so
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:05.440]  they are understanding and they watch what the us has done and they try to expose some of the
[2:25:05.440 --> 2:25:11.920]  globalist things like in syria uh you know our deep state is one that created al qaeda we created
[2:25:11.920 --> 2:25:17.840]  isis well then why is russia i'm not defending russia but why is russia promoting more children
[2:25:17.840 --> 2:25:24.960]  and not having men be wimps gg ping is saying three children no sissy men on tv i mean i think
[2:25:24.960 --> 2:25:31.520]  they just know the poison of the left is for us not for them yeah absolutely it's true um
[2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:39.760]  um so in any case the the main thing i want to talk about though is in the newest thing coming
[2:25:39.760 --> 2:25:45.600]  up is even being promoted by russia and this is the specter of missiles coming back into the
[2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:51.760]  americas by russia hinting that if you try to intervene or stop us that you're going to have
[2:25:51.760 --> 2:26:00.880]  a nuclear war now the new york times started this talking about secret freighter shipping of
[2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:06.400]  secret cargo into cuba in venezuela now i don't know how they would know that it was secret car
[2:26:06.400 --> 2:26:14.240]  so that's cuban missile crisis 2.0 that's right and that's what's starting right now uh in probda
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:21.840]  the russian news outlet has been promoting this they've talked about uh the secret missiles mission
[2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:28.000]  to cuba the fact that the us now is running over flights in cuba and venezuela trying to see if
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:32.960]  they've installed any of these missiles in these two countries they also talked about prop just
[2:26:32.960 --> 2:26:42.720]  told the story about a bore class missile submarine surfacing off the us coast to show itself kind of
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:49.040]  as a threat this is what we can nuke you you know if you intervene with us in russia well we've always
[2:26:49.040 --> 2:26:55.120]  known about this retaliatory threat of russian missile submarines but it really isn't anything new
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:27:00.160]  the russian submarines are off our coast the fact that proba didn't even mention which coast it was
[2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:07.120]  indicates that this was for propaganda purposes kind of a hollow threat but i can tell you that
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:14.720]  this missile threat in the americas is not aimed at the ukraine deterrence of deterring the us
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:21.040]  intervening but it's kind of a warning shot that this is what we intend to do before we launch
[2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:28.480]  on america in world war three which has to start with a larger provocation than ukraine so i think
[2:27:28.480 --> 2:27:33.120]  the russians are intending to put missiles back into venezuela and cuba in fact they may have
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:40.720]  already done so you know we never did inspect cuba in the resolution of the so-called missile
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:46.720]  crisis we never did inspect the ships which supposedly had the missiles on them taking them
[2:27:46.720 --> 2:27:50.080]  out but they were all covered with tarp so we don't know if they really took them out or not
[2:27:50.080 --> 2:27:55.600]  in fact people don't realize that we lost big in the cuban missile crisis because kennedy
[2:27:56.160 --> 2:28:01.920]  secretly agreed with khrushchev to remove all of our intermediate range missiles out of turkey
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:08.000]  so we actually did remove any threat to russia out of our turkey missiles but we never were
[2:28:08.000 --> 2:28:12.320]  allowed to inspect cuba to see whether or not they actually removed missiles well let's talk
[2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:16.160]  about this i want to have time to talk about this yand six committee and the open borders
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:22.160]  and the devaluation and the inflation but let's finish up when we come back in this segment on
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:27.680]  how does the russian invasion of ukraine look and uh is the white house telling the truth that

[2:34:25.280 --> 2:34:32.640]  uh you got a big one coming out uh tomorrow so please continue that's right well um in the
[2:34:32.640 --> 2:34:40.240]  big picture i think it is time for ukraine to be taken back as the soviet union is going to be
[2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:45.680]  reconstituted it's amazing how i i read certain pundits in the west talking about all this is a
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:50.000]  conspiracy theory that putin is trying to reestablish the soviet union well he really is
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:55.120]  it's no conspiracy you're going to see it enacted out as i say it's going to be a blitzkrieg
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:35:01.680]  type war it's going to be softening up with massive missile attacks on all of the ukraine bases
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:07.520]  and clearing the skies so that uh the russians can have dominance and i think we'll see ukrainian
[2:35:07.520 --> 2:35:13.600]  forces collapse within a couple of weeks uh when this happened but in the larger big picture i think
[2:35:13.600 --> 2:35:20.560]  there's a real possibility as this could be a one-two punch in other words russia being an ally
[2:35:20.560 --> 2:35:26.160]  of china can coordinate two attacks to ensure that the u.s doesn't have the facility well that's
[2:35:26.160 --> 2:35:32.080]  exactly how you do it you go into hong kong or taiwan or other areas uh the philippines or into
[2:35:33.200 --> 2:35:38.160]  vietnam at the same time the russians go into eastern europe that's right and i'm expecting
[2:35:38.160 --> 2:35:45.440]  the chinese to go in and take taiwan after the winter olympics and uh they are going to be ruthless
[2:35:45.440 --> 2:35:49.600]  it's going to have a major shock effect on the u.s economy because of all of the chip
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:57.440]  manufacture which is already down and restricting auto supply and appliances etc but when taiwan
[2:35:57.440 --> 2:36:03.920]  is taken by china we're going to lose over three-fourths of the chip manufacturing in the country
[2:36:03.920 --> 2:36:10.800]  as well as a lot of other high-tech manufacturing that comes out of taiwan to us products you know
[2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:16.800]  it's a real mistake for us to have allowed china to become such a mammoth supplier of us things you
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:23.120]  know walmart claims that 60 percent of our um you know goods are us made well i went and did an
[2:36:23.120 --> 2:36:30.240]  informal survey in walmart and i couldn't find a single product that wasn't made in china except
[2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:36.800]  on the vitamin shelf and some of the uh you know cosmetic it's been a major double crossing of the
[2:36:36.800 --> 2:36:44.160]  so-called american elite by china or just by their own action they sold themselves out being being so
[2:36:44.160 --> 2:36:51.280]  dependent on china well that's right uh you know they they realize that that's how you build up a
[2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:57.840]  huge enemy who's capable of taking on the west is by giving them all of this income uh from us
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:06.480]  economic support and that's one of the reasons why do you when china and russia do their massive
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:11.600]  nuclear first strike it will be only on us military targets they do not want to enjoy
[2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:17.920]  want to destroy the economic infrastructure which provides so much of the material what you're saying
[2:37:17.920 --> 2:37:22.480]  i agree with they've already got the blue cities and their little calming people in charge of those
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:29.200]  they're just going to cut out the u.s military well in fact it isn't that they control the blue
[2:37:29.200 --> 2:37:35.840]  side of the no but they know the blue side will capitulate go along but only because the globalists
[2:37:35.840 --> 2:37:42.880]  control the blue side and the globalists want china to see to uh be prepared for war they want
[2:37:42.880 --> 2:37:48.160]  china they they want to mask the united states people from the threat now even though certain
[2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:52.800]  generals on our side like general mike flinn are talking about china being a major threat
[2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:58.160]  it's amazing to me how mike flinn has believed all the propaganda from the national war college
[2:37:58.160 --> 2:38:03.200]  that the russia is no longer a threat that it's a dying country he said that on tucker carlson just
[2:38:03.200 --> 2:38:09.840]  the other uh other week and it's a very misinformed position and it shows how much propaganda our
[2:38:09.840 --> 2:38:14.880]  generals are getting from the national war college which are all taught by globalists out of georgetown
[2:38:14.880 --> 2:38:19.920]  etc they do not believe that russia is a threat so when do you think russia already has troops in
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:25.520]  ukraine but what do you think the main thing kicks off how long does it last as i say i think it's
[2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:31.040]  only going to last a couple of weeks because i think the russian has overwhelming superiority
[2:38:31.040 --> 2:38:36.480]  electronically and missile forces to be able to undermine the armored forces which are
[2:38:37.360 --> 2:38:42.880]  basically second rate in in ukraine they don't have the latest armor that russia has yeah so being
[2:38:42.880 --> 2:38:49.280]  in the ukrainian military is going to be a death trap yeah and there's not a lot of fervor in the
[2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:55.360]  ukrainian military towards defending the country because it's a very torn country between russian
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:39:02.240]  speaking people and and ukrainian speaking people which most they're mostly bilingual except in
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:10.080]  eastern ukraine but uh we had a lot of defections during the donbas stealth invasion by russia a
[2:39:10.080 --> 2:39:15.680]  lot of defections over to the russian side and i think that uh that may happen again all right
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:21.760]  shifting gears domestically biden trying to say election fraud clearly want to steal the next
[2:39:21.760 --> 2:39:27.440]  election again trump to me just seems to be going around in circles uh since we out of the game
[2:39:27.440 --> 2:39:33.120]  what do you think about america's politics and america's position right now well first of all
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:39.200]  i agree with the position you've taken that uh we really can't afford to support donald trump
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:44.640]  again for the presidency we need someone who really follow through rather than just give us the
[2:39:44.640 --> 2:39:51.120]  rhetoric now i'm not impugning donald trump's uh desire to make america great again but he
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:58.960]  virtually has no power intellectually or morally to follow through and fight the actual battle it
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:03.920]  takes to fight the globalist he can't he still cannot tell who's a globalist and who isn't he
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:10.480]  continues to make mistakes about that he even went out and criticized ron desantis of florida who has
[2:40:10.480 --> 2:40:17.520]  shown himself very strong against this covet nonsense and this vaccine nonsense uh donald trump
[2:40:17.520 --> 2:40:23.920]  is incapable of of saying i'm sorry i was wrong about the vaccines and he continues to push those so
[2:40:25.280 --> 2:40:31.120]  i think you're right about that i think we need to find some additional support unfortunately
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:39.040]  he's a force that to be reckoned with because his supporters are so fanatical in their support of
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:46.480]  donald trump uh that uh they just won't countenance anyone else as long as he's in in the battle so i
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:52.640]  fear he will be the nominee in 2024 and that hillary clinton is going to be the democratic nominee
[2:40:53.840 --> 2:41:00.400]  the democrats are in real trouble because of their their woke politics their unpopularity
[2:41:00.400 --> 2:41:07.920]  i think the true democrats or support for joe biden is is about 30 which isn't enough to get
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:13.440]  elected even with a lot of election fraud but that's why the democrats are trying so hard to push
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:19.280]  hr1 and hr4 in the senate both of which have to do with federalizing federal election laws and
[2:41:19.280 --> 2:41:25.040]  stopping and overturning the state's attempts to tighten up now i can tell you that the state's
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:29.600]  attempt to tighten up voter registration and fraud and other things is really not going to work as
[2:41:29.600 --> 2:41:37.440]  long as you allow complete 100 computer pro uh computer voting in the united states it's capable
[2:41:37.440 --> 2:41:46.880]  of having election electronic fraud uh whether it's uh it doesn't matter who owns the voting
[2:41:46.880 --> 2:41:52.160]  machines the globalist i think control whoever's going to run these voting machines and they will
[2:41:52.160 --> 2:41:58.800]  there will be fraudulent elections will tell in the 2022 elections how much uh fraud there still
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:04.240]  is but i think there's going to be a lot i still think the democrats are in danger of losing the
[2:42:04.240 --> 2:42:13.120]  house because of how much damage biden has done uh to this but um it's going to be very telling to
[2:42:13.120 --> 2:42:17.520]  see how much election fraud the democrats are going to be much more careful about this they made a
[2:42:17.520 --> 2:42:23.680]  lot of mistakes uh and had to really cover it up with the media uh in denial that there was any
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:31.680]  fraud which was a desperate sloppiness there was a great deal of sloppiness but i'm very very
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:39.040]  disappointed in how the media especially fox news went along with the election fraud and failed to
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:45.200]  discover them there was a book by molly hemmingway for example about a major conservative book about
[2:42:45.200 --> 2:42:50.720]  fraud and she too failed to talk about the edison data which showed how much stay there let's come
[2:42:50.720 --> 2:42:53.840]  back to the final segment with joel scows and big pitchers straight ahead

[2:47:39.040 --> 2:47:44.320]  write myself into the story it's just true i'm under investigation it's admitted for sedition
[2:47:44.320 --> 2:47:49.040]  and conspiracy by the fbi they told us that um we talked to them all the time and we've got the
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:53.680]  subpoenas here it's all ongoing it's ridiculous i didn't preplan an attack on the capital i didn't
[2:47:53.680 --> 2:48:00.240]  attack the capital um but they're now betting it looks like their whole campaign and everything
[2:48:00.240 --> 2:48:07.120]  they're doing with the midterms in 291 days on imminent domestic terror attacks and they're busy
[2:48:07.120 --> 2:48:11.520]  saying rush is going to stage a false flag and i said yesterday yeah governments do that to start
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:17.440]  a war well what about a false flag a new oklahoma city or something so what do you make of that and
[2:48:17.440 --> 2:48:22.800]  and how they get rid of biden or how they bring somebody in new because uh they are really again
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:28.480]  mitch mcconnell had to respond when biden said a week and a half ago republicans are a domestic
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:33.600]  enemy and mitch mcconnell's not like some anti-globalist but he's been like whoa whoa whoa this is
[2:48:33.600 --> 2:48:38.640]  dangerous i think even the republican establishment is starting to figure out the democratic party
[2:48:38.640 --> 2:48:47.360]  is crazy what do you think well uh they're not crazy but they're certainly evil yeah and that's
[2:48:47.360 --> 2:48:52.800]  uh that can look very very crazy but they are the epitome of evil there's a lot of satanic
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:49:00.160]  inspiration and component um there's a lot of hatred among the democratic far left elite
[2:49:00.160 --> 2:49:06.800]  against any goodness in america they just hate it and you can see that come out um at many of
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:12.240]  their acolytes that are elected to school boards and prosecutors and others i was gonna say i'm not
[2:49:12.240 --> 2:49:17.680]  a perfect person but i love jesus when i'm around the left they just go like it like comes out of
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:23.040]  them they can't hide it now yeah they really do i think satan is beginning to rage in the hearts
[2:49:23.040 --> 2:49:28.160]  of men as prophesied in the bible and that's uh very very crucial and there's nothing you can do
[2:49:28.160 --> 2:49:34.720]  to really stop that um the january sixth investigation is aimed at first of all a public
[2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:41.200]  relations campaign to demonize in the idea of americans uh the the the so-called right wing
[2:49:41.200 --> 2:49:48.320]  but also it's to energize and justify department of justice going after domestically people um
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:54.960]  and investigating them like yourself and anyone else that they want to that's part of a censorship
[2:49:54.960 --> 2:50:00.480]  campaign it's part of a deliberate campaign to get you off of the air alex and that's why
[2:50:00.480 --> 2:50:05.040]  it's very important that your listeners support what you're doing uh which is very strong but
[2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:09.520]  additionally it's going to lead eventually what they'd like to do once they get into full digital
[2:50:09.520 --> 2:50:16.160]  banking is the cutting off of people from their bank accounts you know just like michael indell
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:21.680]  had his bank there in minnesota completely cut him off and and uh say that um you know you've
[2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:26.000]  got to find banking elsewhere now he's got enough millions that he can get banking elsewhere
[2:50:26.640 --> 2:50:31.840]  but smaller people to get blacklisted are going to have trouble yeah this is a foreshadowing
[2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:36.640]  of what's coming and where are the republicans where is donald trump where are any of them saying
[2:50:36.640 --> 2:50:43.760]  no to this well they're not there because they really don't understand conspiracy and those
[2:50:43.760 --> 2:50:49.600]  that do for example are afraid to death to come out and talk about it directly and let's expand
[2:50:49.600 --> 2:50:54.240]  on that to interrupt into five more minutes extra time if you can because i'm not kissing your butt
[2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:59.520]  and i'm not kissing mine but why do we see the multifaceted multi-dimension system it seems so
[2:50:59.520 --> 2:51:04.400]  simple to us like riding a bike and other people can't see it i just don't understand it because
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:09.600]  i agree i meet with high-powered people billionaires you name it and they literally joe cannot see it
[2:51:09.600 --> 2:51:13.680]  they look at things one-dimensional or two-dimensional and they cannot see it
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:22.080]  well it's that they don't want to see it because they see enough of the extreme censorship the
[2:51:22.080 --> 2:51:28.800]  blackballing and the destruction of any ceo that comes out and hints i mean even elon musk when he
[2:51:28.800 --> 2:51:34.400]  came out and bucked against the the nevada restrictions or in the california restrictions
[2:51:34.400 --> 2:51:39.920]  in coveted center he just got crucified by the president he doesn't take much for ceos to
[2:51:40.720 --> 2:51:46.640]  to see this you know i have a brother who's very conservative and who's a an economist and yet he
[2:51:46.640 --> 2:51:51.520]  won't touch conspiracy with the 10-foot pole because he knows he won't get interviewed by
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:52:00.160]  ludlow and and others people's uh you know in the mainstream media if he ever buys into conspiracy
[2:52:00.160 --> 2:52:06.160]  and so it is a very strong dampening effect that's taken years to develop in the media
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:10.960]  hostility towards conspiracy theorists well i have news for them there's a lot of conspiracy
[2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:15.840]  facts to back up the theory and the only reason we have to deal in theory is because they hide most
[2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:22.080]  of the facts behind the veil of national security and so that we'll never know what really happened
[2:52:22.080 --> 2:52:26.320]  during jfk and all the government involvement there well i totally agree and so what are they
[2:52:26.320 --> 2:52:30.400]  going to do because i tried to get joe rogan four years ago to be anti-new world order because i
[2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:34.560]  know he was smart he figured out that's a giant audience that's great he's doing it now so the
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:38.960]  show's exploded how are they going to deal with it as the public figures out that things are
[2:52:38.960 --> 2:52:42.800]  conspiratorial and that that's really the reality i mean because it doesn't matter how many people
[2:52:42.800 --> 2:52:49.680]  they take out how many people they silence this information is coming out well it is coming out
[2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:56.080]  but it's only in limited distribution you know the covetous uh false exaggerated pandemic proved
[2:52:56.080 --> 2:53:02.960]  that 80 of americans still get almost all their news from the mainstream media and that leaves
[2:53:02.960 --> 2:53:09.360]  about 20 who deal in the alternative media and that's not enough to ever get it to be widespread
[2:53:09.360 --> 2:53:13.200]  infused especially when you control public education it's one of the biggest mistakes that
[2:53:13.200 --> 2:53:19.360]  ever was made in the america is to have public funding and control of public education it should
[2:53:19.360 --> 2:53:23.840]  have always remained private well that's right that's why it's came over in some ways because
[2:53:23.840 --> 2:53:27.760]  you could give people the truth but so many of them don't know how to even learn
[2:53:27.760 --> 2:53:33.440]  they've been so dumbed down you can't even communicate with them that's right as i say it's
[2:53:33.440 --> 2:53:40.160]  an 80 percent versus 20 percent ratio here and they're growing theirs faster than we're growing
[2:53:40.160 --> 2:53:45.360]  ours now it has resulted in a strong polarization in america and i don't think there's ever going
[2:53:45.360 --> 2:53:51.680]  to be any united ever again the left is going to get more and more evil and they're driving more
[2:53:51.680 --> 2:53:59.280]  of the millennials through collegiate and high school education into woke doctrines uh critical
[2:53:59.280 --> 2:54:05.920]  race theory and evolution all of that is anti god and it's it's destroying and unfortunately you know
[2:54:05.920 --> 2:54:11.760]  most conservatives still send their kids to the public schools i don't understand it alex even
[2:54:11.760 --> 2:54:17.520]  though homeschooling has grown by you know several million and represents almost 11 percent now but
[2:54:17.520 --> 2:54:21.840]  you're right the whole future is going to be the exodus out of this system it's predatory and people
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:27.440]  better figure out this thing is going to destroy you you've got to get out of it now that's right
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:33.200]  and part of getting out is why i wrote strategic relocation you know people need to get out of
[2:54:33.200 --> 2:54:38.240]  the big cities they need to get rural where you can have more control over your lives that you
[2:54:38.240 --> 2:54:43.200]  have freedom from pollution freedom from these ideas freedom from the social things and freedom
[2:54:43.200 --> 2:54:47.680]  from the vaccine mandate you hardly ever see any of that stuff in the rural it's not enforced
[2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:53.280]  local sheriffs don't want to do that but i'm here to tell you because i do consultations
[2:54:53.280 --> 2:54:58.800]  regularly on strategic relocation people are complaining it's almost too late in the game
[2:54:58.800 --> 2:55:02.880]  to relocate because there's so many people getting out of the big cities because of the
[2:55:02.880 --> 2:55:07.360]  covid nonsense and that's driving the prices up exactly people should have listened to you 20 years
[2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:15.200]  ago yeah and so it's getting late in the game now i'll tell you when war comes it's too late to
[2:55:15.200 --> 2:55:20.320]  relocate you've got to make your plans before that happened because it will be preceded by an
[2:55:20.320 --> 2:55:24.720]  emp strike that was my next question when do you think this big war you've been saying
[2:55:24.720 --> 2:55:30.640]  you've been saying 2025 for about 20 years it seems well i'm now saying the latter part of
[2:55:30.640 --> 2:55:36.960]  this decade because russia and china still are very wary of the secret weapon systems the united
[2:55:36.960 --> 2:55:42.160]  states is building and i think a lot of those weapons are going into space that's why china
[2:55:42.160 --> 2:55:47.120]  and russia are gearing up to try to take out satellites because they probably suspect that
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:54.880]  the u.s has space-based interceptors as general matt has told a buzalan private conference he said
[2:55:54.880 --> 2:55:59.280]  you'd be surprised how many trillions that aren't on the budget are going into space
[2:56:00.160 --> 2:56:04.560]  now those aren't just reconnaissance satellites i think those are space-based interceptors which
[2:56:04.560 --> 2:56:10.000]  they will not use to defend against that first strike they want the military decapitated so
[2:56:10.000 --> 2:56:16.000]  they can talk americans into joining a militarized global government that's the whole goal of these
[2:56:16.000 --> 2:56:22.800]  globalist three wars that we've had we're one total commitment they want total commitment to
[2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:28.880]  global and you can't get americans into a global government without a third world war where our
[2:56:28.880 --> 2:56:35.520]  military is decapitated it is the perfect thing and that's why pdv-60 is still secret is because it
[2:56:35.520 --> 2:56:40.800]  tells our missile forces to absorb a nuclear first strike and retaliate afterwards which is
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:47.280]  but couldn't people like you convince the russians and chinese to back off i mean we see them backing
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:52.720]  away from globalism and one-shot policies maybe maybe maybe freedom won't spring here maybe
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:58.880]  the chinese or russians figure this out no no they're ruthless when you look at the speech
[2:56:58.880 --> 2:57:05.360]  that was leaked to the epic times of general haotian the former defense minister china
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:10.480]  they're going to be ruthless with americans you know the nazis in their view were pampering to
[2:57:10.480 --> 2:57:17.040]  the west we're going to be ruthless in cleansing the country and uh so i don't try to easy ping
[2:57:17.040 --> 2:57:24.720]  at marz Hitler yes and and and actually despises his weakness he was too weak on the west according
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:30.880]  to haotian so this is a very serious situation we're facing in the future i'm expecting world war
[2:57:30.880 --> 2:57:36.160]  three in the latter half of this decade when russian and china are fully prepared militarily
[2:57:36.160 --> 2:57:41.440]  to take on the west they're just now deploying some hypersonic missiles they don't have them
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:45.120]  a great number hold on you talked about that a decade ago they're right back with one more segment
[2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:49.920]  with no scousen paying for warriors if you're like me you've been a long time listener of this
[2:57:49.920 --> 2:57:56.480]  program and you fed up with everything going on in the world inside you like me a fire is burning
[2:57:56.480 --> 2:58:02.480]  something needs to change and yet we feel helpless almost like we're stuck inside a system that someone
[2:58:02.480 --> 2:58:08.880]  else created for us it's time for us to break free from that system reset wars is a game changer
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:14.480]  you start to see yourself more as part of the solution instead of just as a victim so much of
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:20.160]  the stuff we look at today is low vibration low energy and makes us depressed and therefore we
[2:58:20.160 --> 2:58:25.200]  manifest this negative reality out there when they feel their lie-cheek steel plan to enslave and
[2:58:25.200 --> 2:58:32.160]  rob the people there is an awakening reset wars has helped me to navigate and to pinpoint
[2:58:32.160 --> 2:58:37.680]  and lock on to the deep-rooted psychological tactics that were being used against me and now
[2:58:37.680 --> 2:58:43.920]  i'm not scared anymore i have to say i was blown away i feel so much better every day listening
[2:58:43.920 --> 2:58:49.600]  to it to alex thank you very much for putting the course together you're absolutely right we are
[2:58:49.600 --> 2:58:55.680]  reflections of god we are emanations of that and we can use that god energy to do really anything
[2:58:55.680 --> 2:59:00.160]  we want to do in this life roman's chapter 12 paul talks about how we're transformed by the
[2:59:00.160 --> 2:59:05.200]  renewing of our mind and that's a process most of our thoughts and actions are subconscious
[2:59:05.840 --> 2:59:10.160]  most people go through their day and don't think about many things you can drive along a long journey
[2:59:10.160 --> 2:59:15.680]  and not even remember half the trip in this process we need to have a concerted active effort
[2:59:15.680 --> 2:59:21.040]  physically and mentally to reprogram that subconscious mind that's what this series is about
[2:59:21.040 --> 2:59:27.120]  is resetting our mind because there's a war on for our mind he's exactly right and he's become a great
[2:59:27.120 --> 2:59:32.160]  voice in our generation and in this new great awakening and i encourage everybody out there
[2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:43.040]  if you haven't gone there yet go to resetwars.com that's where your journey begins
[2:59:43.040 --> 2:59:54.960]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:00:00.480 --> 3:00:04.960]  all right the news and info wars.com that i've not covered in the last hour is insane but
[3:00:04.960 --> 3:00:11.440]  what dulce calzen had to say was so important but man covid vaccines are growing new variants
[3:00:11.440 --> 3:00:20.480]  inside vax bodies claims top bill gates scientists we've got footage of this is america nypd arrest
[3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:24.320]  nine-year-old girl we're trying to go to the museum without a vaccine passport
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:31.040]  i mean this is just good old-fashioned evil dulce calzen with all the incredible things going on
[3:00:31.040 --> 3:00:37.120]  world in closing what do you and want to impart to this audience of several million souls
[3:00:37.120 --> 3:00:47.120]  of every race color and creed that want with them well first message i would like to put forward is
[3:00:47.120 --> 3:00:54.480]  don't expect anyone politically to rise as a savior for us i think the deep state is so much
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:01:01.040]  so powerful and so deeply controlled of government that even if i were president with all i know
[3:01:01.040 --> 3:01:07.040]  about deep state and conspiracy it's almost impossible to root it out because they control
[3:01:07.040 --> 3:01:11.840]  the surveillance equipment in order to take these people down in the american system of justice
[3:01:11.840 --> 3:01:16.640]  you would have to have actual evidence of surveillance of their telephone conversations
[3:01:16.640 --> 3:01:20.880]  and other things spying on them and the nsa is controlled by the deep state they'd never
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:26.240]  follow your orders they wouldn't do it and then even if you could get some evidence the judges
[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:30.960]  are controlled by the deep state and they wouldn't prosecute and let alone the department of justice
[3:01:30.960 --> 3:01:37.040]  we saw how many times they defied president trump when he declared that he wanted now we're watching
[3:01:37.040 --> 3:01:42.400]  images of nine-year-olds arrested for not wearing masks in new york i mean these are just bone
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:48.320]  chilling images dulce calzen and that's going to continue in the big picture remember that the
[3:01:48.320 --> 3:01:55.760]  co vid conspiracy to exaggerate a pandemic and the co vid virus is real and it is a very strong
[3:01:55.760 --> 3:02:03.680]  virus but it's only deadly to people with chronic ill disease illnesses and disease or with vaccine
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:08.880]  damage from having taken years of vaccines it is not a threat it shouldn't be a pandemic
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:16.720]  but they are using it of course now to separate society into the vaccinate vaccinated and the
[3:02:16.720 --> 3:02:22.000]  unvaxxed and the war on the vaccination as i've covered in the past two briefs is really growing
[3:02:22.000 --> 3:02:27.840]  to oh you were on 20 plus years ago and we said you in enforce force inoculation because that
[3:02:27.840 --> 3:02:31.520]  was in their white papers and now we're here people wonder how you and i know all this
[3:02:32.480 --> 3:02:36.240]  our enemies why do our enemies in closing do this they'll admit in white papers what they're
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:39.760]  going to do but then the general public deny it but why do they still admit it
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:48.080]  i think it's because there's so much they're so confident in their control that they can openly
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:52.880]  admit things and realize that the people are really powerless to stop it that's what's the
[3:02:52.880 --> 3:02:58.000]  scary thing but it's very very important to realize that this co vid thing is that we're never going
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:03:04.720]  to let us be free from this co vid or any virus because it can mutate and they can go on beyond
[3:03:04.720 --> 3:03:09.760]  the omicron and then have any of that's an endless emergency it's the perfect power grab
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:16.320]  that's right but it's going to you've got to be prepared rather than hope for a savior for hope
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:20.880]  for a cure to hope for a vaccine i agree that was the worst part about trump is that you said
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:25.200]  this like three years ago and i wasn't quite there yet but you were writing in joe we can't put all
[3:03:25.200 --> 3:03:29.120]  our faith in him it's got to be in god and our self-taking action and that was the problem with
[3:03:29.120 --> 3:03:34.880]  trump is that the whole q thing that's right and the action that you've got to take is get prepared
[3:03:34.880 --> 3:03:41.280]  to get out of establishment society as difficult as that is people keep crying out to me and emails
[3:03:41.280 --> 3:03:46.720]  and i've got to maintain my job but they're going to require the vaccine i said forget the job get
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:52.640]  retrained start preparing because once you start complying there's no end to these boosters and
[3:03:52.640 --> 3:03:58.480]  you're going to get killed or chronic disease from these vaccines if you continue to take them
[3:03:58.480 --> 3:04:02.480]  if you haven't already that's right it's a total trap and nobody's happy about it but
[3:04:03.360 --> 3:04:09.040]  every instinct i've got is get out of the city and just i have to fight just to stay on air joe
[3:04:09.040 --> 3:04:14.080]  because i know how real this is i mean i am like i'm ready to evacuate my family i've got a balance
[3:04:14.080 --> 3:04:18.080]  that was staying on air to fight as much as possible but i realized what you said 20 years ago is
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:25.200]  true we're not going to fix this only god is that's right and and god unfortunately has ruled
[3:04:25.200 --> 3:04:29.760]  that we're going to go through the tribulation because people have lost their sense of morality
[3:04:29.760 --> 3:04:35.200]  they're no longer listening to conscience in terms of the majority people and and that's what's from
[3:04:35.200 --> 3:04:40.960]  look at the rapid growth in homosexuality in this transgender nonsense all of it joe we're out of

[3:06:48.320 --> 3:06:54.720]  at the risk of inducing autoimmune responses autoimmunity in in children that's why i'm
[3:06:54.720 --> 3:07:02.080]  saying never ever use a vaccine that cannot block transmission when you are on the battlefield
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:13.680]  if you have a vaccine that cannot prevent the transmission you cannot control this this this
[3:07:13.680 --> 3:07:19.520]  this pandemic the virus will escape you cannot win this it's impossible so in other words with
[3:07:19.520 --> 3:07:26.000]  this mass vaccination you're doing exactly the opposite you are generating a breeding ground
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:35.120]  for even more infectious variants to replicate scientifically there is no rational what's
[3:07:35.120 --> 3:07:42.480]  whatsoever to to vaccinate children this cannot be justified there is no added value whatsoever
[3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:51.120]  for children there is only major concerns and and and major risks so we know definitely that the
[3:07:51.120 --> 3:07:59.760]  risk benefit ratio is going in a completely wrong direction so how on earth can you with that knowledge
[3:08:00.880 --> 3:08:08.480]  can you even think of doing such a thing it's i've no other words this is criminal and and and
[3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:14.880]  you know as a scientist we don't use these words lightly well you you hear me saying exactly the
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:21.680]  opposite that when you get vaccinated there is no chance that you can contribute to herd immunity
[3:08:22.480 --> 3:08:32.480]  and my advice is very very clear under no single circumstance should you allow to get your child
[3:08:32.480 --> 3:08:40.720]  vaccinated okay dally takes over here in about eight minutes that is such a huge article and
[3:08:42.160 --> 3:08:46.640]  part of me fighting 28 years wants to just hey i've done my job been in the fight i can bow out
[3:08:46.640 --> 3:08:52.880]  now but i can't do that that's why we fight so hard is there's not many outposts that can reach
[3:08:52.880 --> 3:08:59.120]  millions of people like we're able to do right now and then if i can get the millions of you
[3:08:59.120 --> 3:09:04.400]  watching and listening to share this article in that video you saw it won't get two million views
[3:09:04.400 --> 3:09:08.480]  it'll get 20 million views and then if those people shared it would get 100 million views
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:15.120]  this is a life and death situation the article is covered vaccines are growing new variants
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:21.600]  inside vax bodies claims top gates back doctor he's not claiming it's a fact thizer admits it
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:27.680]  then we've got this article i showed the video was b-roll earlier but let's show it with audio
[3:09:27.680 --> 3:09:35.280]  this is america nypd arrests nine-year-old girl and five others we're trying to enter a museum
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:49.120]  of natural history without a vax passport here it is this is dystopia look at that little girl
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:53.600]  she's strong that's the future of america is that little girl right there she's strong
[3:09:53.600 --> 3:09:58.400]  she's strong she understands they don't own her body no look at the child i know it's happening
[3:09:58.400 --> 3:10:02.400]  that we're too loud look at the child look at the child look at the child it's all right she's
[3:10:02.400 --> 3:10:08.000]  gonna do it no where are you taking her where are they taking her like it's a fucking fucked up

[3:10:17.920 --> 3:10:22.880]  the museum she wouldn't let Pfizer put its evil metal proboscis into her and inject her with death
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:27.120]  because she refuses to show her pain look oh it's liberal the women are the cops so it's okay
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:34.080]  so sick ladies and gentlemen not against women being confident saying it's always that nanny state
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:45.520]  a giant exercise in evil people pretending they're part of the power structure pretending they're
[3:10:45.520 --> 3:10:54.800]  winning by carrying out these levels of corruption wow what a broadcast today kate dally or the kate

[3:20:11.280 --> 3:20:16.080]  hi i'm kate dally your guest host today and so appreciative you know i'll tell you what jules
[3:20:16.080 --> 3:20:20.960]  scousen very very good friend of mine been interviewing him for years and i'd love to see him on alex
[3:20:20.960 --> 3:20:26.560]  jones because he's such a great analysis i mean he just absolutely gets it i love that about him
[3:20:27.120 --> 3:20:33.120]  and i want to share with you today a couple of things i um that are i think are very very important
[3:20:33.120 --> 3:20:37.680]  on my way to work i was listening to the song let's go crazy by prince you guys remember that right
[3:20:37.680 --> 3:20:43.200]  and uh the opening line of that song is dearly beloved we are gathered here to get through this
[3:20:43.200 --> 3:20:49.840]  thing called life and i thought you know it is a tough thing right now and probably the reason
[3:20:49.840 --> 3:20:55.120]  that you're tuned in and watching is because you're trying to figure out what to do about it right
[3:20:55.120 --> 3:21:00.960]  and trying to understand it these are well-laid plans now you and i know that because we've
[3:21:00.960 --> 3:21:06.800]  invested time into research we know what we're talking about we understand that these plans
[3:21:06.800 --> 3:21:12.960]  have been going on for a long time and each component of those plans drops in a certain way
[3:21:12.960 --> 3:21:18.000]  but they want it to be very isolated so that everybody looks at each component that drops
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:23.280]  of their well-laid plans as an individual thing and then what we do is we go into the wood into
[3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:30.560]  the weeds trying to decipher that one thing instead of looking at it as a whole so what is
[3:21:30.560 --> 3:21:38.160]  this episode about how to stop propaganda how to stop the brainwashing because i think if anything
[3:21:38.160 --> 3:21:42.240]  we all want to know what to do and how to do it right we all want to know how can we talk to
[3:21:42.240 --> 3:21:49.280]  friends and neighbors how can we get them to see what's happening they're so totally focused on
[3:21:49.280 --> 3:21:55.200]  covid they are focused on the drumbeat of war they're focused on all these things and what do they
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:22:01.840]  drive well they drive fear we get it right we've got king fraud a lot and warm allah doing a number
[3:22:01.840 --> 3:22:06.880]  on the american people we've been couped in this nation and we do have some techniques in some ways
[3:22:06.880 --> 3:22:13.520]  now that we can actually train people to look at the propaganda and recognize it and i think that's
[3:22:13.520 --> 3:22:19.200]  going to be what's important about this episode today one thing that i probably after 10 years on
[3:22:19.200 --> 3:22:24.880]  the radio can say is that uh we are inherently a good people because honestly that's why people
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:29.600]  wear the mask they're controlling little beasts while doing it but that's why they're doing it
[3:22:29.600 --> 3:22:36.080]  right i am a good person and i want you to be a a healthy person so i want to make you do this too
[3:22:36.080 --> 3:22:42.000]  it does come from a good place even though it's completely backwards it comes from a good place
[3:22:42.000 --> 3:22:47.600]  so we're inherently a good people but we're not inherently a bright people are we i mean let's face
[3:22:47.600 --> 3:22:55.840]  it we're not very smart and that is the problem do you guys remember uh Rajneesh Raj Rajneesh
[3:22:55.840 --> 3:22:59.920]  the uh the indian guru guy i loved what he had to say here we go
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:10.800]  coronavirus research in 2002 there was a recognition that the coronavirus was seen as
[3:23:12.480 --> 3:23:19.440]  here okay so this was a clip by Rajneesh and he said we are a so let me focus on this one clip real
[3:23:19.440 --> 3:23:33.040]  quick the people are retarded retarded yes right
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:43.520]  up the retarded okay so we know this to be true and this is the problem we are a people that
[3:23:43.520 --> 3:23:49.120]  doesn't understand what's going on in the big picture so how do we do that so let me let me lay
[3:23:49.120 --> 3:23:54.320]  down a couple of ways that we can do that how do we teach our kids to recognize propaganda how do we
[3:23:54.320 --> 3:23:58.960]  look at the russia drumbeat of war right now and figure out if there's a war going on so i want to
[3:23:58.960 --> 3:24:04.080]  get to this i also want to ask you some questions about the january 6 because what we're what what
[3:24:04.080 --> 3:24:11.600]  is happening in america is we are taught to feel we're not taught to ask questions so it's kind
[3:24:11.600 --> 3:24:16.080]  of like sending a kid off to school and every subject you want to teach it is uh how do you
[3:24:16.080 --> 3:24:20.480]  feel about that that's really what common core is how do you feel about this math problem how do you
[3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:26.160]  feel about this english problem how do you feel about biology it's based on opinion and so we're
[3:24:26.160 --> 3:24:31.840]  not taught to ask the questions and really think and when the when they started uh propagandizing
[3:24:31.840 --> 3:24:36.720]  the january 6th event right off the bat and never mentioned the electoral college again
[3:24:37.280 --> 3:24:42.240]  we learned a lot of things didn't we the media stopped talking about the electoral college
[3:24:42.240 --> 3:24:47.040]  bam done never talked about it again and that's why people were there they wanted to see the votes
[3:24:47.760 --> 3:24:53.120]  you know uh recorded in red right they started talking about a group of americans that were
[3:24:53.120 --> 3:24:58.960]  unarmed waved into the capital taking selfies nobody was talking about the fact that they
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:03.520]  weren't armed nobody was talking about the fact that they were taking selfies of themselves
[3:25:03.520 --> 3:25:08.400]  they didn't want you to focus on any of that and focus is a big huge deal with these people
[3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:14.320]  all the four officers did not die because of the patriots they died from other causes we know this
[3:25:14.320 --> 3:25:21.120]  but they'll never change the official narrative in wikipedia right they'll never ever change it
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:29.040]  in fact uh they never talked uh about anything again except death death by the patriots because
[3:25:29.040 --> 3:25:34.720]  why they had to villainize us there were no arrests for firearms because nobody was armed
[3:25:34.720 --> 3:25:41.040]  there uh where was the violence no one looked like they'd been in an altercation yet they
[3:25:41.040 --> 3:25:48.640]  claimed 140 officers had to seek medical attention i'd they do that it's insane right did anyone have
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:54.720]  a black eye did anyone look like they were in a tussle of course not no patriots were walking
[3:25:54.720 --> 3:25:59.280]  around people that love this country that looked like they'd been in any kind of fight and beyond
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:05.040]  that had they been they'd have been shot these are capital policemen they would have said i have
[3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:10.400]  every right to shoot you because you're going after me none of those things happened the media
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:15.600]  has lied for a year about those four officers dying because they all died of other causes
[3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:24.880]  i got into a little fight with uh one of our fbi darlings over the fact that um there wasn't anything
[3:26:24.880 --> 3:26:31.040]  that the fire extinguisher event never happened he called me a liar over and over again on the air
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:37.440]  well wasn't it true coroner came out and said nothing happened to that officer as far as
[3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:43.680]  anything on the outward appearance or internal damage fire extinguisher never took place but
[3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:49.280]  we're not taught to ask well why did they have to resort to a fire extinguisher lie because
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:57.200]  if it was an armed insurrection we would have been armed with guns correct so if anyone had tried to
[3:26:57.200 --> 3:27:02.400]  be violent they would have been shot on site had they tried to be violent they would have actually
[3:27:02.400 --> 3:27:08.320]  received charges the two that were charged with the fire extension actually they had to remove
[3:27:08.320 --> 3:27:15.840]  those charges because in the end we know the truth we're not taught to ask questions we're not taught
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:20.480]  to ask hey did anyone look like they'd been in any altercation was this really an armed insurrection
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:26.960]  of course not we're not taught to ask we're just taught to feel the emotion of what they're saying
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:32.960]  and talk about theater and grandstand it reminds me that old stick song you know uh this is the show
[3:27:32.960 --> 3:27:39.040]  the grand illusion and that's what it is so how do we get people to understand this how do we
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:45.280]  unwind it how do you go back and show people hey wait a minute all of the obvious questions were
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:52.880]  never asked all of the obvious questions were never were never even pointed to really they didn't
[3:27:52.880 --> 3:27:58.960]  want you to focus on it nobody was armed they walked into a building took selfies while the
[3:27:58.960 --> 3:28:05.440]  capital police stood there but forever in history they'll go with the same byline that five people
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:12.240]  were murdered at the january 6th event it's ludicrous and we all know it it's all for show
[3:28:12.240 --> 3:28:18.160]  so how do we break through this i'm going to show you a technique and and convey a technique to you
[3:28:18.160 --> 3:28:22.800]  that we need to teach our kids and that we need to be doing every single day when we're reading news
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:29.280]  stories and i hope this technique helps you and when we come back because this technique can be
[3:28:29.280 --> 3:28:35.280]  something that's so easy to teach it's so easy and when i come back we'll get right to it i'm
[3:28:35.280 --> 3:28:41.840]  kate deli your guest host kate deli radio dot com i'm actually live right after this for three hours

[3:33:13.040 --> 3:33:17.280]  i'm k dally your guest host glad to be with you today let's talk about how to stop the
[3:33:17.280 --> 3:33:22.960]  brainwashing shall we because i think we need some hints on what we can do uh to talk to our
[3:33:22.960 --> 3:33:27.520]  neighbors and friends and get them to see isn't that basically what we want because power in numbers
[3:33:27.520 --> 3:33:33.360]  is really the only thing that's going to work with us the people um are going to set this right
[3:33:33.360 --> 3:33:39.440]  just like they've done in history many many times um did you know they tried to push a smallpox
[3:33:39.440 --> 3:33:47.280]  vaccine back in the 1800s and guess who stopped it the people the people said no we will not do this
[3:33:47.280 --> 3:33:53.520]  we don't need to do this and they actually stopped it that's how they uh had to kind of reinvent the
[3:33:53.520 --> 3:33:59.120]  vaccine program again in the 1900s is because in the 1800s they tried but it's always going to be the
[3:33:59.120 --> 3:34:05.360]  force of the people so let me give you a technique that works uh pretty well in trying to stop the
[3:34:05.360 --> 3:34:11.120]  propaganda and the brainwashing to get people to see what's going on in our news mainstream news
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:16.800]  will always have an article and the article will always have a paragraph and that first paragraph
[3:34:16.800 --> 3:34:21.440]  is really important and this is the this is the paragraph that you want to read and then you want
[3:34:21.440 --> 3:34:28.960]  to go through with your kids so here's a paragraph about january 6th uh events on thursday to mark
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:34.720]  a year since the january 6th riot at the capital underscored the fragility and uncertainty in america's
[3:34:34.720 --> 3:34:40.240]  future even president biden claimed the deadly insurrection on former president trump and a mob
[3:34:40.240 --> 3:34:47.120]  of extremists military or militia members and former military who embraced trump's web of lies
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:53.760]  right that's how it's always going to go down in history right that first paragraph what it does is
[3:34:53.760 --> 3:35:00.720]  it lies down it lays down i'm sorry an assumption an assumption of what we believe an assumption
[3:35:00.720 --> 3:35:07.680]  of what we have now assumed as truth but if you pick apart the first paragraph and you go sentence
[3:35:07.680 --> 3:35:13.920]  by sentence and you ask is that true is that true is that true it's kind of amazing how the rest of
[3:35:13.920 --> 3:35:21.120]  the article falls apart every single news article depends on that first paragraph to show you the
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:26.160]  exact words that you're supposed to absorb and believe before you hit the rest of the article
[3:35:26.800 --> 3:35:32.480]  so when you're with your kids every single news article you read us you have to go to their
[3:35:32.480 --> 3:35:40.800]  assumption of fact and tear it apart was it deadly no nobody was armed and the patriots actually
[3:35:40.800 --> 3:35:47.920]  didn't kill anybody okay and did it underscore the fragility and uncertainty in america's future
[3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:54.240]  well it depends are you saying that entire event now under is the fragility and uncertainty in
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:36:00.720]  america's future no had nothing to do with it they made a mountain out of a out of a molehill
[3:36:00.720 --> 3:36:07.040]  they tried to make something into something so in every single article and do this today take
[3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:12.960]  three random articles from cnbc or abc or any of the top hitters you know even fox news and even
[3:36:13.520 --> 3:36:19.600]  cnn go to the first paragraph tear it apart and look for the assumptions that are made
[3:36:19.600 --> 3:36:25.520]  that are pretending to be a fact and then you can start to roll back the propaganda and show
[3:36:25.520 --> 3:36:30.800]  somebody okay let's go after every word in this paragraph let's go after every sentence is what
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:36.320]  they are saying true because i'm in a doubt that it is the rest of the article falls apart
[3:36:36.960 --> 3:36:42.800]  everything relies on that first paragraph to spell out the narrative for you so that you're
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:48.960]  not thinking but if you critically think about the words and the sentences used you'll you'll start
[3:36:48.960 --> 3:36:54.640]  to be able to unwind the propaganda for somebody else as you're directing them through this so
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:37:01.280]  this happened in january 6 that's happening with russia again too it always amazes me how we take
[3:37:01.280 --> 3:37:08.720]  these uh drum beats of war and turn it into something huge right so russia are we going to war
[3:37:08.720 --> 3:37:14.160]  i don't think so i think it'd be a small altercation i think that russia would like to have the
[3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:20.640]  ukraine but i don't think it's willing to um to take on some some serious actions to do it is it
[3:37:20.640 --> 3:37:26.480]  really worth that much to have it right to push all of these things to the edge and if they do
[3:37:26.480 --> 3:37:32.960]  would we be involved no but then again we've been back here again in history so many times haven't
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:38.320]  we if we don't have the drumbeat of war we can't do the war budgets you know we can't get the war
[3:37:38.320 --> 3:37:46.960]  budget maxed out we as an economy are driven on a war budget and so as a as a libertarian
[3:37:46.960 --> 3:37:53.600]  and as a republican i can tell you that i am not for the wars um it's all theater to me the boogie
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:38:00.000]  men are all theater remember when they used to roll out uh we call him a king flung poo on the uh
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:05.920]  who flung poo on on the show you know when they used to roll him out every few years as the biggest
[3:38:05.920 --> 3:38:09.520]  threat and they would say you know it's a nuclear threat it's a nuclear threat to get everybody
[3:38:09.520 --> 3:38:15.120]  excited and everybody assuming that north korea was going to drop a bomb on us did it ever happen
[3:38:15.120 --> 3:38:21.600]  no do we have 600 times the firepower yes even if it would have happened they would have never won
[3:38:21.600 --> 3:38:26.160]  they would have never done anything to us because we would have been able to thwart that early on
[3:38:26.800 --> 3:38:34.000]  so it's a problem for us when we can't see through the war the war drum uh the beat of that war
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:40.400]  drum every five minutes in america when they want a good distraction they start to they start to tell
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:44.560]  us we're going to go to war again i actually don't think we'll go to war over this i think we'll
[3:38:44.560 --> 3:38:49.520]  actually because i don't think uh we're ready or nator's ready to go over war over ukraine right
[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:56.080]  why would be why why would we be and also i think when you are looking at the narrative
[3:38:56.960 --> 3:39:02.480]  it's all coming from washington and washington loves to exaggerate and they love to come to
[3:39:02.480 --> 3:39:08.880]  assumptions and when they do they love to say the anonymous state department person has now said
[3:39:08.880 --> 3:39:14.720]  that where it's a possible attack yet biden what has he done he said well possibly some sanctions
[3:39:15.520 --> 3:39:20.000]  you know he's already played his hand off the teleprompter i have to add because he doesn't
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:25.920]  know how to speak without a teleprompter and we have a problem in identifying when we're being
[3:39:25.920 --> 3:39:30.880]  used and abused and i think this is one of those moments i actually don't think it's going to
[3:39:30.880 --> 3:39:36.000]  amount amount to too much we're going to scare monger this because it's a good distraction
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:43.120]  but the truth is going to be very very different i think and i also think that uh that russia might
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:48.400]  decide not to um i just think it's a couple of kids on a playground right now and i think that
[3:39:48.400 --> 3:39:53.360]  they're using it in the press to get us super excited about it i actually do not think something
[3:39:53.360 --> 3:39:58.720]  will happen there but you know what we're in a situation all the time where we have to see
[3:39:58.720 --> 3:40:03.760]  through these headlines do you remember in syria when they tried to tell us that Assad was a mass
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:08.400]  murder gassing his people all of a sudden right after we had him on 60 minutes and he was perfectly
[3:40:08.400 --> 3:40:13.360]  normal you know in the last few years you really haven't heard about Assad gassing his people have
[3:40:13.360 --> 3:40:21.440]  you hmm why not because it's not convenient for a storyline for the narrative i guess mad men just
[3:40:21.440 --> 3:40:27.520]  become mad men and then all of a sudden whoo they're not mad men anymore hmm isn't that interesting
[3:40:27.520 --> 3:40:33.280]  we tend to forget because we have i think a certain amount of ad d in this country where
[3:40:33.280 --> 3:40:38.560]  we do not be we're not able to reflect on the headline and look back and say well wait a second
[3:40:38.560 --> 3:40:44.400]  this wasn't happening this isn't this isn't something that was going on and uh and by the way
[3:40:44.400 --> 3:40:50.240]  why did it just stop why are we no longer concerned about Assad gassing his people i remember interviewing
[3:40:50.240 --> 3:40:54.640]  people on the ground in syria and uh they were saying this is absolutely wrong it's the white
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:41:00.880]  helmets are the bad guys not the good guys and of course we actually elected Assad and so we're
[3:41:00.880 --> 3:41:07.760]  always going to be told a story in our press that allows us to think that we're this close
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:14.320]  to having either world war three or that we assume that a country is uh all of a sudden they have a
[3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:20.240]  mad man and we have to go take them out of course to play ball um so that we can insert somebody
[3:41:20.240 --> 3:41:27.040]  that we want to play ball with but we're not taught to ask those questions that's huge the other
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:33.920]  problem i see is the focus we are highly focused on covid right now and so the problem from coming
[3:41:33.920 --> 3:41:40.080]  from dr robert malone which he laid out beautifully was robert malone talked about the fact that this
[3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:45.840]  highly centered focus has been a brainwashing technique a brainwashing technique but how
[3:41:45.840 --> 3:41:51.600]  do you get through to people that are really kind of in a trance and he said you know he said really
[3:41:51.600 --> 3:41:57.440]  the number one thing that you can do is present the bigger issue of the great reset the bigger
[3:41:57.440 --> 3:42:02.720]  issue of losing liberty the bigger issue that we have at hand that we're going to lose freedom
[3:42:02.720 --> 3:42:09.360]  and basically freedom for our kids if you focus more on that somebody that's in the trance as they're
[3:42:09.360 --> 3:42:14.640]  walking around believing in covid's going to kill me any second a sniffle's coming to get me might
[3:42:14.640 --> 3:42:21.280]  just be sort of jerked out of that trance into a higher level of thinking and that would be get
[3:42:21.280 --> 3:42:27.680]  them get them non-focused on covid and focused on the degree of liberty that we're about to lose
[3:42:27.680 --> 3:42:32.160]  it's another technique just like going through the very first paragraph and picking it apart in a
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:37.040]  news article same kind of thing we have to realize we're at so when i come back i want to play a
[3:42:37.040 --> 3:42:44.160]  clip of dr david martin talking about the beginning of covid the bigger story i'm cake deli your
[3:42:44.160 --> 3:42:54.160]  guesthouse i'll be right back
[3:42:56.160 --> 3:43:02.080]  a riotous mob whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:08.480]  assault on our democracy is surrectioned we will follow the facts wherever they lead domestic
[3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:15.280]  terrorists the days of independent media are numbered the government has made it illegal to
[3:43:15.280 --> 3:43:21.280]  oppose them they are now deep banking us behind the scenes they want to bankrupt us and make us
[3:43:21.280 --> 3:43:28.320]  go away quietly with practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps
[3:43:28.320 --> 3:43:34.240]  the traders know they can shut us down by force but that would accelerate the awakening exponentially
[3:43:34.240 --> 3:43:42.320]  so be it make them silence us by force this is the final battle of the information war give now
[3:43:42.960 --> 3:43:50.800]  buy products donate before everything changes we need you to carry us through to the end victory
[3:43:50.800 --> 3:43:58.720]  or death go now to infowarstore.com why do my enemies hate me so much why do the globalists
[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:05.760]  take you so much why do they hate america so much because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical
[3:44:06.320 --> 3:44:12.480]  system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world government
[3:44:12.480 --> 3:44:19.040]  their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and new process
[3:44:19.040 --> 3:44:26.000]  injustice and god fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with bill gates
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:32.080]  you didn't start a fight with david rockfeller you didn't start a fight with the un they started
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:37.920]  a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away and they're not going
[3:44:37.920 --> 3:44:44.320]  to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put into them the average person still
[3:44:44.320 --> 3:44:48.880]  doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism or about corporate fascism and
[3:44:48.880 --> 3:44:54.000]  it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack we have any chance of beating
[3:44:54.000 --> 3:45:01.280]  these people the powerful combination of both vitamin c and zinc are great stepping stones to

[3:47:14.320 --> 3:47:20.160]  guest host happy to be here and talking about how to stop this brainwashing how what do we do are
[3:47:20.160 --> 3:47:26.400]  there techniques what can we learn what can we do about this and yes there are gladly i'm so glad
[3:47:26.400 --> 3:47:31.200]  about this because you know i know you're worried about it i'm worried about it and we see far too
[3:47:31.200 --> 3:47:36.960]  many people under these weird delusions and they're doing weird things um and uh you think where did
[3:47:36.960 --> 3:47:44.080]  common sense go i know it's insane right i'm living in an insane world well when we comes
[3:47:44.080 --> 3:47:50.080]  to uh russia bill engdahl a friend of mine had some very interesting things to say about that
[3:47:50.080 --> 3:47:54.000]  they see he said you know in their one-sided pursuit kind of a different angle about what's
[3:47:54.000 --> 3:47:59.760]  going on with russia in their one-sided pursuit their insane agenda 2030 that they're doing zero
[3:47:59.760 --> 3:48:06.080]  carbon agenda the king fraud a lot of administration and the eu are putting their industry on a
[3:48:06.080 --> 3:48:12.640]  deliberate road to destruction well before the end of this decade and is this in turn driving
[3:48:12.640 --> 3:48:19.760]  the current nato agenda towards russia in ukraine and belarus and armenia and now kazakhstan and if
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:25.840]  the nato powers that be know that they will lack the depth in military industrial infrastructure
[3:48:25.840 --> 3:48:30.800]  in the near future do you think it would be better to provoke a possible war with russia now
[3:48:30.800 --> 3:48:36.720]  to eliminate a potential resistor to their d industrial agenda other than china russia holds
[3:48:36.720 --> 3:48:42.480]  the only potential to deal a devastating blow to nato if if provoked he said there's an
[3:48:42.480 --> 3:48:49.440]  interesting paradox here if nato uh the stance towards russia and china when measured clearly
[3:48:49.440 --> 3:48:56.880]  suicidal national green agenda economic policies of the usa are as well as the eu nato states right
[3:48:56.880 --> 3:49:01.600]  this transformation of the economies of the world's most advanced industrial economies is underway
[3:49:01.600 --> 3:49:06.640]  and gaining momentum is this part of a bigger plan because is the heart of the transformation is
[3:49:06.640 --> 3:49:14.080]  energy the absurd demand for zero carbon energy by 2050 i know it's insane the to eliminate carbon
[3:49:14.080 --> 3:49:20.080]  from the energy industry is not at this time perhaps never possible but the push for it will
[3:49:20.080 --> 3:49:25.760]  mean tearing apart the world's most productive economies because some of this is based in nuclear
[3:49:25.760 --> 3:49:32.080]  right in nuclear so keep that in mind so when we're talking about covet and we're talking about
[3:49:32.080 --> 3:49:36.320]  kind of their master plan and everybody's focused on covet i want to play a clip for you
[3:49:36.320 --> 3:49:42.320]  from dr david martin this is a fantastic clip in really getting back to the basics of the
[3:49:42.320 --> 3:49:48.640]  bigger plan what was what was at hand and helping people to understand why we're in this mess and
[3:49:48.640 --> 3:49:56.080]  how long ago it started here's dr david martin virus research in 2002 there was a recognition
[3:49:56.640 --> 3:50:04.240]  that the coronavirus was seen as an exploitable mechanism for both good and ill on april the
[3:50:04.240 --> 3:50:12.960]  25th 2003 the us center for disease control filed a patent on the coronavirus transmitted to humans
[3:50:13.840 --> 3:50:24.560]  under 35 us code section 101 nature is prohibited from being patented either sars coronavirus
[3:50:25.360 --> 3:50:33.040]  was manufactured therefore making a patent on it legal or it was natural therefore making a
[3:50:33.040 --> 3:50:41.360]  patent on it illegal if it was manufactured it was a violation of biological and chemical weapons
[3:50:41.360 --> 3:50:50.000]  treaties and laws if it was natural filing a patent on it was illegal then either outcome both
[3:50:50.000 --> 3:50:58.800]  are illegal in the spring of 2007 the cdc filed a petition with the patent office to keep their
[3:50:58.800 --> 3:51:04.640]  application confidential and private they actually filed patents on not only the virus but they also
[3:51:04.640 --> 3:51:12.400]  filed patents on its detection and a kit to measure it because of that cdc patent they had
[3:51:12.400 --> 3:51:19.040]  the ability to control who was authorized and who was not authorized to make independent inquiries
[3:51:19.040 --> 3:51:26.080]  into coronavirus you cannot look at the virus you cannot measure it you cannot develop a test kit
[3:51:26.080 --> 3:51:33.760]  for it and by ultimately receiving the patents that constrained anyone from using it they had the
[3:51:33.760 --> 3:51:42.240]  means they had the motive and most of all they had the monetary gain from turning coronavirus
[3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:51.600]  from a pathogen to profit developing and owning a coronavirus vaccine has become a biotech arms
[3:51:51.600 --> 3:51:57.680]  race with political overtones this vaccine gold rush is starting to bother me gold rush
[3:51:59.520 --> 3:52:06.880]  let's keep that in mind and so somewhere between 2012 and 2013 something happened
[3:52:07.920 --> 3:52:17.280]  the federal funding for research that was feeding into places like harvard emory university north
[3:52:17.280 --> 3:52:25.600]  carolina chapel hill that funding suddenly became impaired by something that happened at the NIH
[3:52:26.240 --> 3:52:31.680]  where the NIH got this little tiny moment of clarity and said i think something we're doing
[3:52:31.680 --> 3:52:39.200]  is wrong and in 2013 the NIH said gain a function research on coronavirus should be suspended
[3:52:39.200 --> 3:52:47.920]  the national institutes of health had a moral and social and potentially legal reason to object to
[3:52:47.920 --> 3:52:55.040]  research but the letters that were sent to the researchers essentially said you are receiving
[3:52:55.040 --> 3:53:02.320]  notice that we're telling you to stop and now on the bottom of the page we're going to clarify
[3:53:02.320 --> 3:53:14.480]  what stop means keep going but when the heat gets hot in 2014 and 15 what do you do you offshore
[3:53:14.480 --> 3:53:20.480]  the research you fund the wuhan institute of urology to do the stuff that sounds like it's
[3:53:20.480 --> 3:53:26.160]  getting a little edgy with respect to its morality and legality but do you do it straight way now
[3:53:26.880 --> 3:53:31.360]  you run the money through a series of cover organizations to make it look like you're
[3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:36.560]  funding a us operation which then subcontracts with the wuhan institute of urology the u.s
[3:53:36.560 --> 3:53:43.360]  could say china did it china could say the u.s did it and the cool thing is both of them are almost
[3:53:43.360 --> 3:53:53.760]  telling the truth i love dr. david martin fantastic friend of mine and a truth teller what can i say
[3:53:53.760 --> 3:54:03.120]  he's wonderful and really pointing out the the time frame behind the plan for covet 19
[3:54:03.840 --> 3:54:08.720]  what people can't see are the bigger laid plans right we can see them because we do our homework
[3:54:08.720 --> 3:54:14.800]  on our research you wouldn't be listening to this show if you hadn't you can see it like the wrestling
[3:54:14.800 --> 3:54:21.040]  match you get to see that it's fixed but how do we show other people that we can go back and we
[3:54:21.040 --> 3:54:26.080]  can show them the history they might be in a trance still walking around like frankenstein
[3:54:26.720 --> 3:54:33.440]  but they might listen and if they can if we can go back enough in time and show them medical tyranny
[3:54:33.440 --> 3:54:40.320]  was planned for a very long time and the gain of function on coronavirus was planned and executed
[3:54:40.320 --> 3:54:47.440]  for two decades that's huge then it shakes at its core the fact that we're in covet 19 since
[3:54:47.440 --> 3:54:56.080]  march of 2020 do you know this week marks the anniversary of the manufacturing of the vaccine
[3:54:56.080 --> 3:55:02.880]  two years ago wait a minute the end of january they started manufacturing the vaccine well according
[3:55:02.880 --> 3:55:09.120]  to sarah gilbert who works for gaits yes they already started manufacturing a cure for something
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:16.320]  they hadn't even named yet and wouldn't name until march if you start to go back and show people
[3:55:16.320 --> 3:55:22.000]  these important messages arguing about the mask arguing about because it's ridiculous but arguing
[3:55:22.000 --> 3:55:26.720]  about it isn't going to help they are going to be solely transfixed on the fact that they're saving
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:33.600]  somebody's life as stupid as that is but you and i have to go back and show them the history
[3:55:33.600 --> 3:55:40.080]  of the gain of function and who owned the patents on corona all the articles today are the hospitals
[3:55:40.080 --> 3:55:44.320]  are at their limit and they're about to reach their limit more importantly always look at the
[3:55:44.320 --> 3:55:51.360]  wording about to reach going to get there it's the hospitals will be full but they're not full
[3:55:51.360 --> 3:55:56.160]  i interviewed dr ben karson the other day and he said something very insightful i've worked in
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:01.680]  hospitals for a very long time we're always at capacity and then we're not and then we are and
[3:56:01.680 --> 3:56:06.880]  then we're not through the through time all the decades that he worked at hospitals he can tell
[3:56:06.880 --> 3:56:12.320]  you that hospitals were full all of the time and then they weren't full this is nothing new but
[3:56:12.320 --> 3:56:17.280]  they're playing on people's fears that this is something new right always in reinventing the
[3:56:17.280 --> 3:56:23.840]  story this has been rebranded four times in nine months and now we've got the new moronic variant
[3:56:23.840 --> 3:56:29.840]  shot coming out why because they couldn't name it booster shot number five that's why people are
[3:56:29.840 --> 3:56:34.960]  getting a little weary of it and so right now they're laying down all the articles all of the news
[3:56:34.960 --> 3:56:40.800]  press releases from israel saying hey oh four is it enough we're hit by this amicron there's
[3:56:40.800 --> 3:56:48.640]  no test for amicron you're taking the same covet test you did a year ago okay there's no test for it
[3:56:48.640 --> 3:56:53.680]  and just because the government and the cdc come out with a label and diagnose you with something
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:57:00.320]  doesn't mean you assume you have it it's ridiculous it's the repackaging of symptoms it's the repackaging
[3:57:00.320 --> 3:57:07.680]  of covet over and over and what is covet the repackaging of the flu of colds and of zinc i mean
[3:57:07.680 --> 3:57:13.200]  i'm sorry i'm not of zinc of uh of flu the cold and pneumonia the taste and smell component that
[3:57:13.200 --> 3:57:18.320]  everybody's so afraid of just take a hundred zinc every day for a while until until your taste and
[3:57:18.320 --> 3:57:24.320]  smell comes back this is not rocket science we have got to unwind the propaganda says pat wood
[3:57:24.320 --> 3:57:30.400]  unwind the propaganda because propaganda is what got us into this there are ways to do this i'm
[3:57:30.400 --> 3:57:35.120]  k dally your guest host i'm glad you've joined me there's more on this at k dally radio dot com
[3:57:35.120 --> 3:57:39.920]  and i show clips about this but we have got to start to train people how to do this and overlook
[3:57:39.920 --> 3:57:51.760]  the and look at the propaganda thanks you guys inside you like me fire is burning something
[3:57:51.760 --> 3:57:57.360]  needs to change i just want to reach out and uh give a recommendation to reset wars uh it's really

[3:58:15.360 --> 3:58:22.240]  ancient wisdom and ancient knowledge and crystallized it with scientific this isn't about alex jump
[3:58:22.240 --> 3:58:28.960]  so what you're about to see is a lengthy powerful well-documented spectrum of information and
[3:58:28.960 --> 3:58:34.560]  experiences and understanding that the power structure is censoring and is definitely afraid
[3:58:34.560 --> 3:58:40.240]  to think the way we were intended to think by god that's what this series is about reset wars has
