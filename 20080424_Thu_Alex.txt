[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:15.000 --> 00:19.000]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome. I am not Alex Jones.
[00:19.000 --> 00:24.000]  However, it still is Thursday, the 24th day of April.
[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  I will be in for the full fourth hour, four hours, I'm sorry.
[00:28.000 --> 00:32.000]  My name is Jason Bermas. I am a producer over at Loud of the Words.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  One of the people that brought you loose change, loose change, final cut.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  And I am honored to be sitting in for the man, the myth, the legend, Alex Jones today.
[00:42.000 --> 00:46.000]  I'm going to have a jam-packed show for you. We're going to be taking calls all four hours.
[00:46.000 --> 00:50.000]  In the first hour, we are going to have Luke Radowski of We Are Changed.
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.000]  Luke was on the show yesterday talking about his Arnold Schwarzenegger confrontation.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  We're going to be discussing that. We're going to be discussing him
[00:57.000 --> 01:02.000]  and the Bush ladies, as well as a John Kerry
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  concentration that has not been aired on YouTube yet, or really discussed.
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  I hear that they actually had him sign a Skull and Bones picture or book or something.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  I don't know. It should be interesting. We'll get more info from Luke.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  In the second hour, we're going to have Mark Dice. We're going to be discussing one of his upcoming projects
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  and really just his website, checking out the Resistance Manifesto.
[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  He's featured prominently in Alex's new 9-11 film that we discussed earlier in the week.
[01:31.000 --> 01:33.000]  Again, should be an exciting guest.
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  In the third hour, we are going to have Jonathan Elenoff from We Are Changed, Colorado.
[01:39.000 --> 01:42.000]  They do such great work over there.
[01:42.000 --> 01:48.000]  Elenoff is a really smart guy. He runs TruthAction.net.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  You can see some of his great articles over there.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  He just continues to do bang-up work, confronted Gary Hart recently.
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.000]  Gary Hart said, oh, I never use the term New World Order.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  It's so funny. The New World Order exists.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  If you're pro-New World Order, if you're for global governance, if you're for the North American Union,
[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000]  these things exist. They do.
[02:10.000 --> 02:13.000]  But as soon as you say, oh, the North American Union is bad, oh, that doesn't exist.
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.000]  The Trans-Texas Corridor, that's not real.
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  I can see it. You can go to Google Maps or Google Earth.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  You can zoom in on it. You can watch the construction.
[02:23.000 --> 02:26.000]  But apparently, it doesn't exist if you're not for it.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  If you don't want to see our goods shipped directly from Mexico through the United States into Canada,
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  further eviscerating our economy.
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  If you don't want to see that, you have some common sense.
[02:37.000 --> 02:39.000]  The North American Union just isn't real.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  Apparently, NAFTA never passed.
[02:41.000 --> 02:46.000]  Apparently, CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, never passed in 2004.
[02:46.000 --> 02:48.000]  And I'm just making this stuff up.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  Finally, in the fourth hour, we're going to be having these student scholars for 9-11 Truth On.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  I believe we're going to be having Justin Martell for the full hour.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  And I don't think they've been on the Alex Jones show before.
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  I hope they are on the Alex Jones show after this.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  But they're just a bang-up organization.
[03:04.000 --> 03:06.000]  They're some good friends of mine.
[03:06.000 --> 03:08.000]  They're out of Keen, New Hampshire.
[03:08.000 --> 03:13.000]  And these two college students did what any motivated Americans out there can do.
[03:13.000 --> 03:25.000]  They got themselves a digital video camera and began to use their mass-com major as a tool to get press passes to events
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  and ask tough questions of candidates, especially about 9-11 Truth.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  The people that they've gotten is unbelievable.
[03:32.000 --> 03:41.000]  From John McCain to Barack Obama to Mike Ravel to, of course, the first Ron Paul confrontation about 9-11,
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  where Ron Paul said that he would be for a new independent investigation into 9-11,
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  and so much more.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  And they're holding a big event over in May.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  I believe it's May 17th.
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  Not only are we going to have family members, I believe it's Bob McElvane and Donna Marsh O'Connor,
[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  which is a bang-up lineup already.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  I mean, that's great.
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  But they're also going to have Daniel Sunjata, who's done this program on several occasions,
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  and a host of others that you may not see as much.
[04:11.000 --> 04:13.000]  Who is this host of others?
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  Well, a lot of people still don't know who J. Michael Springman is,
[04:16.000 --> 04:25.000]  and he is the CIA whistleblower who worked in Jeddah in the late 80s and early 90s and was forced.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  I guess we're in commercial?
[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000]  We must be.
[04:28.000 --> 04:29.000]  I don't know.
[04:29.000 --> 04:31.000]  Are we in commercial?
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  Or we must be going to commercial.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  All right, so we're going to commercial at the Alex Jones show, and we'll be back after this.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  It is a big idea.
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.000]  A new world order.
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  But their objective would be world domination.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[05:31.000 --> 05:34.000]  All of Earth is making great progress toward a world government.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  Most people have no idea.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  They're not after money.
[05:36.000 --> 05:37.000]  They have all the money they need.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  They're after power.
[05:38.000 --> 06:01.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[06:12.000 --> 06:18.000]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[06:18.000 --> 06:20.000]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[06:36.000 --> 06:41.000]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  Share in the oil company secret and get SFR now.
[06:45.000 --> 06:47.000]  Call 888-USE-SFR-1.
[06:47.000 --> 06:51.000]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1 today.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.000]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[06:58.000 --> 07:02.000]  They get closer and closer and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  Tebow Tech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  You know, in the United Kingdom, to places in Japan,
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  to, of course, where it all started, New York City.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  Luke, an honor to have you on the program.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  Hey, thanks for having me on, man.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.000]  No, thanks for coming on, man.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  And we're probably not going to play too many of your clips,
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  just because I don't think it translates as well over the radio as it does.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  We might play some in the fourth hour,
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  so people can check out the document cam, the new revamp stuff.
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  And by the way, folks, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member,
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  it's only 15 cents a day. You get the full fourth hour in video.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  We got the document cam.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  We'll play YouTube clips and other video and feed it right over the internet.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  It's an exciting time over at Alex Jones Productions.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  But, Luke, I mean, in the last week,
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  you've got some of the most prominent people you've confronted them.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  People like Schwarzenegger, who's a thug who likes to walk around in Nazi memorabilia
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  with his death-shed belt buckle.
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  Oh, I got a death-shed belt buckle. Look how tough I am.
[09:32.000 --> 09:35.000]  To John Kerry, who's a skull and bones member.
[09:35.000 --> 09:39.000]  To the Bush women. Why don't you just discuss, I mean, how busy you are.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  I mean, literally, you don't get any sleep.
[09:42.000 --> 09:45.000]  I mean, yesterday, I was on an Alex Jones show, and I said,
[09:45.000 --> 09:50.000]  the more people attack us, the more people attack us, the more we're going to step it up.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  And that's what we're doing. We're stepping it up.
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  And that's why I just released the Arnold competition yesterday.
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  John Kerry's coming out. We have a new survivor, which is going to come out,
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  which is going to describe bombs in the lobby of the World Trade Center.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.000]  We're going to release the provocateur videos.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  We also confronted Katie Couric. All the videos are going to be coming out too.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  We're doubling our efforts because people are attacking us left and right.
[10:14.000 --> 10:18.000]  That's what we're about. And we're going to send a message to the people trying to set us up
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000]  that every time they attack us, we're going to grow more and more and more.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  And that's what it's about. It's about being defiant.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  It's about being brave. It's about believing in yourself and doing the right thing.
[10:29.000 --> 10:34.000]  And I'm telling you, within the last two days, I did not get an hour of sleep.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  I've been talking to lawyers. I've been going to court. I've been going to the police precincts.
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  I've been working videos. I've been editing videos. I've been copying videos.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  It's just been a crazy last 48 hours. I've been just busting my butt, just trying to do whatever I can.
[10:48.000 --> 10:53.000]  And I'm just hoping to inspire as many people as I can to do the right thing, get out there, get involved,
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  and be the change you want to see in this world.
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  I know it sounds generic for me now because I've been saying it almost 100 times now,
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  but that's what it's about.
[11:02.000 --> 11:07.000]  Well, man, you are the quintessential patriot renaissance man, in my opinion.
[11:07.000 --> 11:14.000]  I mean, you go out there and you get these guys on camera and you upload this to YouTube and you have no fear.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  And you've confronted everyone from Giuliani, which got national press coverage,
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  when you confronted him about the fact that, you know, he got a warning that morning.
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.000]  Okay? He got a warning that morning to get out of the buildings because they were going to come down.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  And then he denied that, correct, Luke?
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  Yeah, he definitely did. This was when Sabrina Rivera came up to Rudolph Giuliani.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  This was actually during his birthday, Giuliani's birthday, and shook his hand and asked him,
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  how come you knew the tower was going to collapse? How come you, said to Peter Jennings,
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  I'm not 11, that the tower was going to collapse?
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  And how come the firefighters and the police officers inside that building never got that warning?
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  And Giuliani lied, knowingly lied. He said about three, four times. I never said nothing like that.
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  And then we played the video of him saying that. And you know, we have Gary Hart lying to We Are Changed Colorado.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  I mean, these politicians are just liars. And we keep proving it over and over again.
[12:09.000 --> 12:13.000]  I don't know what it's going to take for the American people just to wake up and start the Second American Revolution.
[12:13.000 --> 12:20.000]  These people are liars. These people are mass murderers. These people are responsible for the tragedy of 9-11.
[12:20.000 --> 12:23.000]  We have the facts. We have the proof. We have the evidence.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  It's up to us to do something about it. And that's what we're about.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  Well, Luke, you know, I'm going to break a little story here on Giuliani that really has never been discussed.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  But I know who gave him that phone call. And how do I know who gave him that phone call?
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  Well, I dug up. I did a little investigative reporting. You know, I went to the archives.
[12:42.000 --> 12:50.000]  And I found out that he was on Barbara Walters 2020, a few days after the attack. Guess who gave him that phone call, Luke?
[12:50.000 --> 12:51.000]  I have no idea.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  Dick Cheney. Wow.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  Dick Cheney gave him that phone call, folks. And if you don't believe me, all you need to do is you need to go into the archives.
[12:59.000 --> 13:05.000]  It's less than a week after 9-11. He did an interview with Barbara Walters. Okay.
[13:05.000 --> 13:11.000]  And here's the thing. It didn't get a lot of play, but, you know, you're down in New York.
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  Luke, you know the newspaper news day over there, right? You know how it comes out and do the different boroughs?
[13:16.000 --> 13:21.000]  Well, I had a friend whose mother archived everything after 9-11.
[13:21.000 --> 13:27.000]  Literally from 9-12 of that year, for the next 18 months, she kept all the papers.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  And I was down visiting him in Queens, and he's like, you know, my mom's got this stack of papers.
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.000]  He's like, maybe you can use this in your next project.
[13:35.000 --> 13:41.000]  And I got to go through it a little bit for the final cut, but, you know, it didn't really fit the script.
[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  You know, I hadn't gone through all of it. And on my new project, Fabled Enemies, which I'm working on down here in Austin right now,
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  I did get to go through that archive. And one of the staff articles goes over Giuliani on Barbara Walters,
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  where he clearly states that Cheney is the one that gave him that call.
[13:58.000 --> 14:04.000]  See, Cheney was calling everybody that morning after the Secret Service took him down to the PEOC.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  He called up Bush, and he said not to come back to D.C.
[14:08.000 --> 14:14.000]  That's because the Secret Service was getting threats, and somehow whoever was pulling off these attacks had all these secret code words.
[14:14.000 --> 14:22.000]  Not only the angel is next, the Air Force One thing, but apparently they had codes for the NSA, the CIA, the FBI,
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  and all these other high-ranking intelligence organizations.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  You can check that up, that's sourced at, I want to say, that is at WorldNet Daily.
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  And if you type in digital moles in the White House, you're going to find out a whole new world of what happened on 9-11.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  It was reported once, and then it faded off, and then they said, oh, well, that threat that was received against Air Force One,
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  that's the Fog of War, Luke. That's the Fog of War.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  We're not actually going to say who gave it to us, how we received it, what was really going on.
[14:49.000 --> 14:54.000]  We'll say Fog of War, and the public is so dumbed down they're going to buy it, okay?
[14:54.000 --> 15:00.000]  I mean, these guys literally get on television and tell you who the criminals are, Luke, and people won't step up.
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  You know why? American Idol's on, and it's a very good show.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  And everybody wants to watch that. They don't want to be involved in their local politics.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  They don't want to be involved in national politics, and it's kind of sad, Luke.
[15:12.000 --> 15:18.000]  So what do we have to do to penetrate? Do you think that maybe this next project that Alex Jones puts out,
[15:18.000 --> 15:21.000]  the 9-11 Chronicles, is going to spark even more activism?
[15:21.000 --> 15:28.000]  I mean, as I've watched this thing get edited, I can only say that, you know, it's really, I mean, you're a role model, Luke.
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  You're going to be a role model for hopefully millions of people around the world.
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  You're already a role model for me. You've been my hero since I first met you down in New York City
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  when we did that first screening and loose change second edition.
[15:39.000 --> 15:44.000]  I saw how fired up you were. I saw how educated you were. I saw how ready to go you were.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  And you really, you've made me proud again and again, brother.
[15:47.000 --> 15:51.000]  I mean, we are changes, not just about me. It's about everybody.
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  I don't even want to be a role model, to be honest with you.
[15:54.000 --> 15:58.000]  And I'm just hoping to inspire as many people to be the change that they want to see in this world.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  And the more people that stand up, the more people that become leaders, the more people that say, that's it.
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  I'm going to do the right thing. The better it is for everybody.
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.000]  And if everybody just stands up, if everybody becomes their own leaders, if everybody believes in themselves and doesn't look up to anybody,
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  I think that's where we're going to make the huge transition into freedom, into liberty.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  And that's what I'm hoping to achieve. And that's what we are changes about, and that's what, you know, we're going to get.
[16:23.000 --> 16:28.000]  And I just wanted to say that's amazing research that you just pulled out. I mean, Dick Cheney telling Rudolph Giuliani
[16:28.000 --> 16:35.000]  that the power's going to collapse while the firefighters, while the police officers, while all the innocent people in the building did not know.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  And then we also know Larry Silverstein received the warning not to come into work.
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.000]  His daughter received the warning, and his son received the warning not to come into work on not 11.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  And we know that from his own personal security staff.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  I mean, this is, this is just so criminal. I mean, I'm just so sick and tired.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  How much evidence do we need to get the truth out? I mean, it's just incredible.
[16:55.000 --> 17:04.000]  And I'd like to point out too that we're not saying that, you know, Larry Silverstein and Dick Cheney and Rudolph Giuliani
[17:04.000 --> 17:12.000]  were in fact the operational arm of this attack, but they were definitely involved in the cover-up and definitely had prior knowledge somehow.
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.000]  So they are connected, and they definitely help with the cover-up.
[17:15.000 --> 17:25.000]  I mean, you know, Dick Cheney, if anybody was slightly part of the operational arm of the three would probably be at the top of my list with the stand-down at the Pentagon
[17:25.000 --> 17:33.000]  with being in the PEOC. But the thing was that when he went on television and did interviews in the first week after 9-11,
[17:33.000 --> 17:41.000]  he didn't think it was a big deal to talk about the PEOC and how he was there prior, let me say this again, prior to the Pentagon strike.
[17:41.000 --> 17:50.000]  But as it progressed, he realized, wait a minute, I can't be there before the Pentagon because otherwise people are going to realize that I allowed that to happen.
[17:50.000 --> 17:56.000]  So the 9-11 commission goes and says, well, although there's conflicting reports and conflicting evidence,
[17:56.000 --> 18:02.000]  Cheney wasn't in that bunker until 9-54, almost 20 minutes after the Pentagon was hit.
[18:02.000 --> 18:11.000]  But we know that Norman Manetta was in that bunker prior to the Pentagon strike, and he said, not only was I there prior to the Pentagon strike,
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  but before I got there, Dick Cheney and Lynn Cheney were in that bunker.
[18:15.000 --> 18:20.000]  And then he talked about the aid that came in as the Pentagon was about to be attacked.
[18:20.000 --> 18:29.000]  He said, hey, the plane's 50 miles out, Mr. Cheney. Hey, the plane's 30 miles out, Mr. Cheney. Hey, Mr. Cheney, the plane's 10 miles out.
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  Do the orders still stand? Of course the orders still stand. Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  What? And of course, Manetta thought this was going to be a shoot-down order.
[18:39.000 --> 18:47.000]  I mean, two targets had been hit, two serious targets, two targets in the middle of Manhattan in restricted airspace.
[18:47.000 --> 18:55.000]  And then the pinnacle of the military-industrial complex, literally the most guarded building in the world, gets struck.
[18:55.000 --> 18:58.000]  Protected by air defense missiles as well?
[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  Yeah. Well, they said there's no, uh, there's no SAM sites on the lawn, and there's no cameras at the Pentagon either.
[19:04.000 --> 19:12.000]  Even though you can see all the cameras on the top of the building that would have caught, you know, the plane that, or whatever hit the Pentagon, quite frankly.
[19:12.000 --> 19:20.000]  I mean, we know through a FOIA request that there are 85 videos pertaining to what struck the Pentagon, and we've seen four of them, and none of them.
[19:20.000 --> 19:29.000]  And I'll repeat this again. None of them clearly show American Airlines Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon.
[19:29.000 --> 19:32.000]  We'd love you to call in. We'd like to take callers in the next two segments.

[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[21:56.000 --> 22:01.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Could their objective be world domination?
[22:07.000 --> 22:10.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[22:10.000 --> 22:18.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[22:20.000 --> 22:26.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.

[23:52.000 --> 24:05.000]  Psyrus Jones from 1810 to 1930.
[24:05.000 --> 24:15.000]  May these great grandchildren believe you could live to 103.
[24:15.000 --> 24:21.000]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid.
[24:21.000 --> 24:26.000]  So Psyrus Jones lived forever.
[24:26.000 --> 24:31.000]  Gravedigger when you dig my grave.
[24:31.000 --> 24:40.000]  Could you make a shallow so I can feel the rain.
[24:40.000 --> 24:45.000]  Gravedigger.
[24:45.000 --> 24:52.000]  Oh, Willie Nelson got 11 when he covers the Dave Matthews band tune a Gravedigger.
[24:52.000 --> 24:59.000]  Willie, a 9-11 truther, a patriot, a hero, and he's going to be playing Bonnaroo this year.
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  And I know someone called about Bonnaroo earlier in the week, but I'd really love to get down there and not only talk to Willie Nelson,
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  but talk to some of these other celebrities, some of these other comedians.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  Janine Garofalo is going to be there and she's also come out on 9-11 truth.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  But another guy that's going to be there, Luke, who I don't really care for, is Jim Norton.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  And Jim Norton helps out on the opening of Anthony's show down in New York.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  It's really big down there, folks. I know it's nationally syndicated on XM.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  But I did the ONA show right at the beginning of Loose Chain's second edition's success.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  And really, Corey started to do the interview, but was not prepared to be attacked in the manner he was.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  And, you know, being a producer, he hadn't done all the research I had, wasn't as quick on his feet with the facts.
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  And I literally came in and he handed me the phone after about six minutes of the interview.
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.000]  And these, you know, disgusting excuses for human beings were talking about how they wanted to rape my mother.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  They wanted to give her aides. They were cutting my mic.
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.000]  I referred to them as sir again and again and again.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  But Jim Norton just makes me nauseous. There's a whole post over at LooseChange911.com about it.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  I mean, he's into pedophilic jokes and all sorts of nonsense.
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  He's just a vile, vile person. And Jesse Ventura went on a couple weeks ago in studio.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  And I can assure you they did not treat Ventura like they treated me.
[26:17.000 --> 26:22.000]  Although they thoroughly disagreed with him, you don't get in the face of an ex-Navy seal.
[26:22.000 --> 26:29.000]  You don't get in the face of an ex-professional wrestler that would literally probably knock Jim Norton out with one punch,
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  pick up his lifeless body and beat ONA with that body.
[26:33.000 --> 26:37.000]  Anyway, we're talking to Luke Radowski of We Are Change.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  And Luke, before we go to collars and we're going to do that in just a moment, folks,
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  we're going to go pretty quick because we already got a lot of collars, but we're going to take them all throughout the show.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  I want to talk a little about this John Kerry confrontation that you just did,
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  because I have not seen this yet. You haven't sent a tape. I haven't seen it on the YouTube.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  What can the kids expect?
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  The John Kerry confrontation is literally amazing.
[26:59.000 --> 27:05.000]  Coming out of that confrontation, I felt so good about how it just took place.
[27:05.000 --> 27:11.000]  We asked John Kerry about his comments last year where he said Building 7 was brought down in a controlled fashion.
[27:11.000 --> 27:16.000]  I got right in his face and I asked him about his comments last year about WTC7.
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  He says, I don't know what you're talking about, kid. Walked away.
[27:19.000 --> 27:26.000]  He's going outside. We know him. Me, Matt, Gary, John Paul just start nailing them with questions about his comments.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  He says, I never said nothing like that and just gets back in his car.
[27:30.000 --> 27:35.000]  Before that, when he's doing his book signing, Matt LaPace goes up to him.
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  Instead of getting the book, he had a picture of the skull and bones.
[27:39.000 --> 27:42.000]  He had Bush and Kerry equal skull and bones.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  He gave it to John Kerry to sign it. John Kerry just looks at the sign.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  He just throws it away and then the police officers just drag Matt away after he looks at the skull and bones.
[27:52.000 --> 27:57.000]  And it's a beautiful video of John Kerry just looking up and down about three times on the skull and bones
[27:57.000 --> 28:01.000]  and looking at the camera up and down. I mean, it was a great competition.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  I mean, these people are liars. He lied. He said he never made...
[28:04.000 --> 28:10.000]  Just like Gary Hart admitted, he never made a statement about a New World Order after not 11.
[28:10.000 --> 28:16.000]  And now John Kerry is lying about him saying that Building 7 was brought down in a controlled fashion.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  I mean, these people are just liars. I mean, we caught him again in another lie.
[28:21.000 --> 28:28.000]  John Kerry lied again and said, I never made those statements about Building 7 and just ran in his car.
[28:28.000 --> 28:36.000]  I mean, this is getting so crazy. I mean, what do we have to prove? I mean, these people are just liars, man.
[28:36.000 --> 28:44.000]  It's literally 1984 where they can change history. Things go down the memory hole and they can just deny what they've said or done.
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.000]  It's just like, you know, Bilderberg member John Edwards going around and all of a sudden people are saying,
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  talking to him about Building 7, he's like, I've never heard of this. I'll look into it.
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  I just don't know what you're talking. There's no reason to be upset. I'll check it out.
[28:59.000 --> 29:05.000]  And then every single instance afterwards where Building 7 is brought up, he just totally ignores it.
[29:05.000 --> 29:12.000]  You know, in passing, he's admitted to go into the Bilderberg meeting, but he said it was for environmental reasons.
[29:12.000 --> 29:15.000]  I mean, what kind of suckers do they think we are?
[29:15.000 --> 29:21.000]  We're not. I mean, we're exposing them. In one YouTube video at a time, we're exposing that they're liars
[29:21.000 --> 29:28.000]  and they are just completely, without a doubt, lying to the American people and that's what they're doing and we're proving it.
[29:28.000 --> 29:43.000]  And folks, we can get by with a little help from our friends going to callers right after the break, PrismPlanet.tv.
[29:43.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:53.000 --> 30:00.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[30:07.000 --> 30:15.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron
[30:15.000 --> 30:19.000]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[30:19.000 --> 30:25.000]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[30:25.000 --> 30:31.000]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[30:31.000 --> 30:38.000]  What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[30:38.000 --> 30:51.000]  Call the Berkey guy and order now by calling 1-877-886-3653 or simply click on the banner at GCNLive.com to order online now.
[31:10.000 --> 31:18.000]  This is potentially serious and can get worse with age, so get regular checkups from your doctor and take advantage of this special risk-free offer on beta-prostate.
[31:18.000 --> 31:29.000]  Beta-prostate contains natural ingredients that help support a healthy prostate and it contains 3,000 times more beta-satasteroids than ordinary supplemental,
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  so it's powerful and it works.
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.000]  What's better is that beta-prostate is a healthy supplement, so you don't need a prescription for it and it's risk-free.
[31:38.000 --> 31:43.000]  For your risk-free trial of beta-prostate, dial 1-800-457-9914.
[31:43.000 --> 31:52.000]  That's 1-800-457-9914. Try beta-prostate risk-free. That's 1-800-457-9914.
[31:52.000 --> 31:59.000]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[31:59.000 --> 32:06.000]  50% protein, 300 mg of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones,
[32:06.000 --> 32:11.000]  with many more nutrients found in this incredible food source that the government does not want you to have.

[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  This product is illegal to grow in the US, but is legal to import.
[32:20.000 --> 32:28.000]  Don't waste time thinking about storing food, plan ahead and prepare for yourself and your family now, and be in control of your destiny.
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  You can save and invest your money, but in the end, food will be your greatest asset.
[32:32.000 --> 32:36.000]  Remember what the Word of God says in Ezekiel 719.
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.000]  Call 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.

[32:49.000 --> 32:53.000]  Call 908-691-2608 today.
[32:53.000 --> 33:04.000]  We will not be forgotten. We won't be left behind. Our memories live on and for a mind.
[33:04.000 --> 33:14.000]  And boys, together, we'll ride again.
[33:14.000 --> 33:19.000]  I am a Midwest farmer. I make a living off the land.
[33:19.000 --> 33:28.000]  I ride a John Deere tractor. I'm a liberated man. The rain hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[33:28.000 --> 33:33.000]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.000]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[33:38.000 --> 33:45.000]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too. He ain't my friend.
[33:45.000 --> 33:51.000]  He ain't his friend, folks. He's there to take his farm. He's there to take his land.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  He's there to put on the government control that we are all under, folks.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  It's the truth. They're really consolidating power right now.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  I mean, they're blowing out the housing market. They're blowing out the dollar.
[34:03.000 --> 34:09.000]  That's why it's important to have hard currencies. Silver, gold. Ted Anderson can help you out with that.
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.000]  And it's good to have the information, Luke. We have to keep educating each other.
[34:13.000 --> 34:20.000]  We have to keep confronting this stuff and we have to push and push until we get the perpetrators behind 9-11, man.
[34:20.000 --> 34:29.000]  The way I look at it is our entire foreign and domestic policy, Luke, is based on what the government and media have told us about 9-11.
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  And it's time to take that back. It's time to bring the truth to the people.
[34:32.000 --> 34:37.000]  Luke, we're going to go to callers. So let's go to our first caller, Russ in Texas.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  He's been holding the longest. Russ, are you with us?
[34:39.000 --> 34:48.000]  I sure am. One of the most fulfilling things in being part of the Patriot movement is actually getting to interact with the people that I look up to and admire.
[34:48.000 --> 34:51.000]  And you guys are right up at the top of that list, along with Alex.
[34:51.000 --> 34:56.000]  And I've had a chance to meet you, Jason, at the Freedom and Law Conference in Dallas.
[34:56.000 --> 35:01.000]  And I had my 15-year-old son with me and he was very much impressed with the information.
[35:01.000 --> 35:10.000]  But I took him last night to a special screening of a new movie called Howard and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.
[35:10.000 --> 35:14.000]  And this is your typical vulgarity and sophomore humor.
[35:14.000 --> 35:20.000]  Now, you guys are young enough to be immersed in the pop culture enough where I don't think we'd bother you too much and I'd recommend seeing it.
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.000]  But these guys get caught, and I'm not going to give away too much of the movie and I have a point to make,
[35:26.000 --> 35:36.000]  but these guys get caught on an airplane smoking out of a bong and the people on the plane misconstrue what they call it as a bomb.
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  So they get thrown in Guantanamo Bay.
[35:39.000 --> 35:48.000]  Well, you know, of course, the brain-dead homeland security people come along and the top guys think they really have some serious terrorists on their hands.
[35:48.000 --> 35:57.000]  And this guy actually, at one point, one of the guys says, I want, I'm not going to say a word into my lawyer gets here, I'm going to plead the Fifth Amendment.
[35:57.000 --> 36:08.000]  And the Homeland Security guy goes and gets a copy of the Bill of Rights, tears out the page with a Fifth Amendment on it, and wipes himself with it.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  Now, this is typical, but my point is they're using humor to get the message out.
[36:14.000 --> 36:23.000]  Well, I would say this, I mean, Michael Hayden virtually did that by saying, well, you know, it's not probable cause, it's reasonable search and seizure.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  And the journalist who's talking to Michael Hayden is saying, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  He's like, it's, you know, probable cause so then you can have a reasonable search and seizure.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  He's like, no, no, no, no, no, there is no probable cause.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  It's reasonable search and seizure and we're going to decide what's reasonable.
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  And that's, I mean, on one end you're right, you know, that's there for the youth.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  They're trying to bring us into this that there is no Fifth Amendment.
[36:46.000 --> 36:53.000]  And then, you know, for the older crowd that are watching the news, they're seeing Michael Hayden up there going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  It's a reasonable search and seizure.
[36:55.000 --> 36:56.000]  There is no probable cause.
[36:56.000 --> 36:57.000]  Well, you're actually talking about the Fourth Amendment.
[36:57.000 --> 36:58.000]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[36:58.000 --> 36:59.000]  But that's okay.
[36:59.000 --> 37:00.000]  No, no, no, no, I understand.
[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  But, you know, his point was, I'm not going to say a word.
[37:02.000 --> 37:10.000]  The point is, I mean, just like George W. Bush said, you know, this is just, the Constitution is just a G.D. piece of paper.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  I mean, this is the attitude that these people have.
[37:13.000 --> 37:18.000]  Even they even interact with an actor who's playing the president Bush in the movie.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  And at one point they sit down and get stoned with him.
[37:21.000 --> 37:28.000]  And then he says, you know, and he tells him, he says, look, it's not important for a citizen to stand up for his government.
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  I am the government and I don't trust them.
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.000]  He said it's important for a citizen to stand up for his country.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  Well, Russ, I mean, that's just the way it is.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  Ever since the Military Commissions Act, he's pretty much anointed himself a God.
[37:40.000 --> 37:41.000]  I thank you for the call, Russ.
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  And thanks for coming out.
[37:43.000 --> 37:44.000]  You still there?
[37:44.000 --> 37:45.000]  No.
[37:45.000 --> 37:46.000]  Yeah, you're still there.
[37:46.000 --> 37:47.000]  Go ahead, Russ.
[37:47.000 --> 37:48.000]  Okay.
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  There is not a We Are Change group in Dallas, Texas.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  Well, then there needs to be.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  Some of us have to get out there.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  The sitting president is moving here after his term.
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  Well, there needs to be.
[38:00.000 --> 38:07.000]  You know, WeAreChange.org, TruthAction.org, LoneLantern.org, there's 9-11 Truth groups everywhere, and I am calling people out.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  You know, let's do this.
[38:09.000 --> 38:10.000]  Luke, how do they get started?
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  Why don't you let the people know?
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  And thanks, Russ.
[38:12.000 --> 38:13.000]  We're going to go to another caller.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  Luke, how do they get involved in We Are Change?
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  People could contact us to get the rules and bylaws and everything that we stand for about nonviolence and peaceful demonstrations.
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  And it's really just about getting a camera, getting the politicians face, educating people, talking to people.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  And as long as you're doing the right thing, you are being a part of change.
[38:30.000 --> 38:32.000]  And that's all that really matters.
[38:32.000 --> 38:33.000]  Absolutely.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  Thank you, Luke.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  Let's go to Scott in New York.
[38:36.000 --> 38:37.000]  I love New York.
[38:37.000 --> 38:38.000]  That's where I'm from, folks.
[38:38.000 --> 38:39.000]  A little vacation.
[38:39.000 --> 38:40.000]  Scott, are you with us?
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  Yeah.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  Do you hear me?
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  Absolutely.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  How are you doing, man?
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  Good, man.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  I live in New York City.
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  And I lived there on 9-11.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  And I lived in Union Square.
[38:50.000 --> 38:57.000]  And after the first building got hit, I went on top of my roof deck.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  And I was watching.
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  I didn't see the second plane hit.
[39:02.000 --> 39:03.000]  I saw the explosion.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  And I'm just curious about the whole second plane and others.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  People are saying that the footage isn't fake on CNN.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  And I know you've done a lot of research.
[39:16.000 --> 39:19.000]  I'm wondering what your opinion is on it.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  Yeah, because we go slow-mo on that thing.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  It does look like it could be fake.
[39:25.000 --> 39:26.000]  All right.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  Let me get into it, though.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  Let me talk about it.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  Because I've gotten this.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  And I'm not trying to cut you off here.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  Jason, if I could say something as well.
[39:34.000 --> 39:35.000]  Sure.
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  I just wanted to say that I just talked to a survivor who was in another building when
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  the Tintrars are under attack.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  It was a building across the World Trade Center.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  He says he didn't see the first plane hit the building.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  But he says he clearly saw the plane hit the second building.
[39:51.000 --> 39:54.000]  And then he saw a huge explosion in the lobby take place.
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  All right.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  Let me just go over it, Luke.
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  Because I'm with you on that.
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  I mean, I've talked to dozens of eyewitnesses.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  I go down to New York City with you.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  I'm down there maybe four or five times a year in some kind of a respect where I am
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  talking to family members, where I am talking to first responders.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  And on top of that, I would say this.
[40:12.000 --> 40:16.000]  If they were going to fake the video of the second plane, why wouldn't they make it
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  look more like a United Airlines plane?
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  Everybody who's flown United knows.
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  Okay.
[40:22.000 --> 40:23.000]  I'm going to say this again.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  Knows that it has a blue underside with two large blue engines.
[40:28.000 --> 40:36.000]  Now, in all the videos I've seen, the best you can see is possibly a United logo on the
[40:36.000 --> 40:37.000]  tail.
[40:37.000 --> 40:38.000]  All right.
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  But when you watch that famous CNN shot from the underbelly of the plane, it's a gray plane.
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  You know, it's clearly a gray plane.
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  There's no, there's no tonal difference.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  There's no blue on the underside.
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  There's no blue engine.
[40:49.000 --> 40:54.000]  Plus it makes an outline hole of whatever hits the building, the plane.
[40:54.000 --> 40:55.000]  I mean, the wings are there.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  You know, the body's there.
[40:57.000 --> 40:58.000]  It goes in.
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  The huge explosion happens.
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.000]  And then there's a hole there.
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  I do not believe in TV fakery.
[41:03.000 --> 41:06.000]  I think there's a good possibility that they use drones.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  If you look at the scientific evidence of the G forces, if you look at the drills they
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  were running that day, if you look at the fact that they had E4Bs in the air.
[41:13.000 --> 41:19.000]  These doomsday planes, one of which got caught out in DC right around the time of the Pentagon
[41:19.000 --> 41:20.000]  attack.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  And then, of course, there is a mysterious white plane on the scene of the World Trade
[41:24.000 --> 41:25.000]  Center.
[41:25.000 --> 41:28.000]  Prior to the second strike, you can see it's a camera plan of archive.
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  I suggest everybody go out and check it out.
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  It looks a little different from an E4B.
[41:31.000 --> 41:36.000]  It looks like it has, it's all white body with blue underside on the wings and possibly
[41:36.000 --> 41:37.000]  a blue tail.
[41:37.000 --> 41:42.000]  But you can also see it, it looks like that plane is also leaving as the second plane
[41:42.000 --> 41:43.000]  hits the building.
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  And it's possibly an E4B.
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  I'm not going to go out and say it is an E4B, but it is a mysterious white plane that isn't
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  restricted airspace and should not be there.
[41:53.000 --> 41:59.000]  I do not believe all this color, key, 9-11 octopus, TV fakery, garbage.
[41:59.000 --> 42:03.000]  And I really think that's out there to discredit us.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  I mean, why would they do that?
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  And I'm yet to be proven wrong, and I think Nico Hopp is a raving lunatic.
[42:11.000 --> 42:18.000]  You can just see that by his tactics, and I'm not even going to plug his work because
[42:18.000 --> 42:22.000]  he's out there harassing people that are being proactive like Luke Radowski all the time.
[42:22.000 --> 42:26.000]  Luke, you're out there trying to make change, trying to bring up real issues, and you've
[42:26.000 --> 42:31.000]  got to deal with this guy who's just in your face because you're not taking his opinion.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Scott, I thank you for the call, man.
[42:33.000 --> 42:34.000]  I hope I answered your question.
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  We're going to jump to yet another caller.
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  Let's go to James in Indiana.
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.000]  James, are you with me?
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  Hi, Jason.
[42:41.000 --> 42:42.000]  How you doing, man?
[42:42.000 --> 42:43.000]  Really good job.
[42:43.000 --> 42:44.000]  Thank you, man.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  I've got a question for you and a one question for Luke, too.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  Sure.
[42:48.000 --> 42:49.000]  If I can.
[42:49.000 --> 42:50.000]  Okay.
[42:50.000 --> 42:51.000]  The one for you.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  Earlier, you kind of touched on it.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  The Pentagon, you were talking about the plane, and then you corrected yourself or whatever
[42:58.000 --> 42:59.000]  was ahead of it.
[42:59.000 --> 43:04.000]  What's confusing to me is why not just admit it was a plane?
[43:04.000 --> 43:11.000]  As far as I'm aware of, every witness that was there said it was a plane, and all the
[43:11.000 --> 43:12.000]  evidence was a plane.
[43:12.000 --> 43:16.000]  There are rescue workers who went inside and talked about the passengers that were still
[43:16.000 --> 43:17.000]  strapped inside.
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  Well, I haven't seen that one, but I mean, have you seen the final cut yet, James?
[43:22.000 --> 43:23.000]  Yeah, it's a great movie.
[43:23.000 --> 43:24.000]  I got it.
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.000]  I bought it.
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.000]  Excellent.
[43:26.000 --> 43:27.000]  You know that we do kind of show both sides.
[43:27.000 --> 43:31.000]  We do show you the eyewitnesses that were there that said that they saw a plane.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  However, none of them saw the plane actually strike the building.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  I'll say it goes over that hill, even Mike Walter, who didn't make the final cut, but
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.720]  he was in the second edition.
[43:38.720 --> 43:43.720]  We went to down to D.C. earlier in the year, and I even went and had a barbecue with Mike
[43:43.720 --> 43:44.720]  Walter.
[43:44.720 --> 43:48.120]  He's the famous guy that said he saw the American Airlines logo, and it was like a
[43:48.120 --> 43:49.720]  missile with wings.
[43:49.720 --> 43:55.320]  I literally spent the afternoon with him and his family, and Bob Pugh, who's in the movie,
[43:55.320 --> 43:58.240]  who took all that video of the lawn and everything.
[43:58.240 --> 44:02.760]  I found it very telling that although he promised us an interview, we went to his home.
[44:02.760 --> 44:04.200]  We had dinner with him.
[44:04.200 --> 44:07.400]  He kept putting it off, and putting it off, and putting it off until it was about the
[44:07.400 --> 44:10.880]  end of the week, and then he just flat-out said no.
[44:10.880 --> 44:14.200]  I don't know why he would say no to us when we-
[44:14.200 --> 44:17.760]  But you're aware that there's like lots of other witnesses to watch out for.
[44:17.760 --> 44:18.760]  Oh, absolutely.
[44:18.760 --> 44:19.760]  Absolutely.
[44:19.760 --> 44:24.240]  But then you go to the guy who was heading up the operation, and he says, well, there's
[44:24.240 --> 44:25.760]  not any big pieces of plane.
[44:25.760 --> 44:28.560]  We haven't found any engines, any fuselage sections.
[44:28.560 --> 44:31.280]  There's these tiny sections.
[44:31.280 --> 44:33.800]  I'm still up in the air with what exactly hit the Pentagon.
[44:33.800 --> 44:35.000]  I don't like to take either side.
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.520]  Obviously, you have to account for the damage against the light poles.
[44:38.520 --> 44:41.600]  You would think something with a wingspan would have had to hit those down.
[44:41.600 --> 44:47.160]  But I would say it's really hard for me to believe that a 757 or a 767 could do that
[44:47.160 --> 44:52.040]  and still maintain enough control not to crash into the lawn or the highway beforehand.
[44:52.040 --> 44:53.040]  I may be wrong.
[44:53.040 --> 44:59.040]  But they see that's the heart of 9-11 is planes flying into buildings, and with that plane
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.280]  flying into that building, we know for a fact that a person couldn't do it.
[45:03.280 --> 45:06.320]  That's, to me, a smoking gun proof of remote controls.
[45:06.320 --> 45:07.480]  Well, I got to agree.
[45:07.480 --> 45:10.440]  If it was a plane, man, I do think it was remote control.
[45:10.440 --> 45:14.200]  And I don't think it was made of the same material as a 757 or 767.
[45:14.200 --> 45:18.680]  Those wings are relatively light flexible metal.
[45:18.680 --> 45:21.360]  I mean, everybody's been on a plane, or not everybody, but most people.
[45:21.360 --> 45:26.200]  And if you sit by the window, you can see the wings move up and down a little bit.
[45:26.200 --> 45:28.720]  There's that there for strain and stress.
[45:28.720 --> 45:32.960]  And I still don't see how it clipped those five light poles, even remote control, being
[45:32.960 --> 45:33.960]  made of that material.
[45:33.960 --> 45:34.960]  It could have been a drone.
[45:34.960 --> 45:36.480]  It could have been something we don't know about.
[45:36.480 --> 45:39.720]  It could have been painted up like an American Airlines plane.
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.960]  My biggest problem with that is if it's a 757, 767 type, even if it was supposedly remote
[45:44.960 --> 45:47.160]  controlled in, where's the tail section?
[45:47.160 --> 45:48.400]  Where's the march from the tail section?
[45:48.400 --> 45:53.080]  How come the wingspan isn't as wide as it should be with the markings?
[45:53.080 --> 45:54.240]  It's off about 60 feet.
[45:54.240 --> 45:59.360]  I think the damage to the building is something like 74 feet, and the wingspan is something
[45:59.360 --> 46:00.520]  like 120 feet.
[46:00.520 --> 46:06.080]  So I mean, again, I'm with you that I do believe some type of plane hit the building.
[46:06.080 --> 46:07.560]  What type is up in the air for me?
[46:07.560 --> 46:09.320]  So you said you had a question for Luke also?
[46:09.320 --> 46:10.320]  Yeah.
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.400]  I had a chance on getting a confrontation with the penguin, Dick Cheney.
[46:16.400 --> 46:21.080]  He was here in New York City, but we couldn't get anywhere near him Monday, police officers
[46:21.080 --> 46:24.920]  and secret service all over him, and there's no way we could get near him.
[46:24.920 --> 46:26.960]  But if there is, we'll be there.
[46:26.960 --> 46:27.960]  Don't worry about it.
[46:27.960 --> 46:28.960]  All right.
[46:28.960 --> 46:29.960]  All right, James.
[46:29.960 --> 46:30.960]  Thank you so much for the call, man.
[46:30.960 --> 46:36.820]  And I would say that my favorite Dick Cheney confrontation so far shows up in Spike Lee's
[46:36.820 --> 46:41.120]  documentary about Hurricane Katrina, where a couple of guys find out he's around the
[46:41.120 --> 46:43.600]  corner in their truck, and they're like, let's go, man.
[46:43.600 --> 46:44.720]  Let's go confront him.
[46:44.720 --> 46:46.720]  And they go right up to him.
[46:46.720 --> 46:49.080]  Go eff yourself, Mr. Cheney.
[46:49.080 --> 46:50.400]  Why don't you go eff yourself?
[46:50.400 --> 46:53.520]  And then the reporter's like, Mr. Cheney, are you getting a lot of that?
[46:53.520 --> 46:56.200]  First time I've heard it.
[46:56.200 --> 47:00.960]  All right, let's go to James in Indiana.
[47:00.960 --> 47:02.640]  James, are you with us?
[47:02.640 --> 47:05.320]  James, maybe dropped?
[47:05.320 --> 47:06.320]  No James?
[47:06.320 --> 47:07.320]  All right.
[47:07.320 --> 47:09.080]  Well, oh, I did just talk to James.
[47:09.080 --> 47:10.080]  What am I doing?
[47:10.080 --> 47:11.080]  Of course I did.
[47:11.080 --> 47:12.080]  Let's go to Don in Texas.
[47:12.080 --> 47:13.080]  I'm sorry about that.
[47:13.080 --> 47:14.080]  Don, are you with us?
[47:14.080 --> 47:15.080]  Yeah.
[47:15.080 --> 47:16.080]  Hi there.
[47:16.080 --> 47:17.080]  Hi there.
[47:17.080 --> 47:18.080]  How you doing, man?
[47:18.080 --> 47:19.080]  Glad to see you there.
[47:19.080 --> 47:20.080]  Well, thank you.
[47:20.080 --> 47:24.560]  Say, a reason I call something that doesn't come up too often, and I think that Alex and
[47:24.560 --> 47:30.320]  several other people have been holding off on it, is this raid on the yearning for Zion
[47:30.320 --> 47:34.240]  Mormon group out there in West Texas.
[47:34.240 --> 47:36.240]  I've been keeping up on it, so what do you want to talk about?
[47:36.240 --> 47:38.360]  I hope you've been researching it.
[47:38.360 --> 47:44.160]  And they've been making different proclamations like the Royal King would say without any
[47:44.160 --> 47:55.360]  trial at all that it's a pedophile camp for sexual gratification for elderly men, and
[47:55.360 --> 47:56.360]  there's been no trial.
[47:56.360 --> 47:57.880]  I agree with you there.
[47:57.880 --> 48:00.880]  Let me just break this down for people that don't know.
[48:00.880 --> 48:06.800]  The government came in to a polygamist compound, and they took all these women's kids.
[48:06.800 --> 48:10.080]  Now they got them both on there, they separated them, they said that they were just going
[48:10.080 --> 48:13.640]  to be away from them for a moment, and then they shipped the kids off in buses.
[48:13.640 --> 48:17.640]  Now they told the women that they could stay there and try to get their kids back or they
[48:17.640 --> 48:18.880]  could go back to the compound.
[48:18.880 --> 48:20.360]  Now there was no guarantees either way.
[48:20.360 --> 48:26.960]  Now these women have been paraded around Larry King Live, Anderson Cooper.
[48:26.960 --> 48:29.400]  It seems like CNN is doing the most coverage of this.
[48:29.400 --> 48:35.040]  Now they've let people into their home recently, and here's my take on that.
[48:35.040 --> 48:39.080]  So far I'm not going to go whether the guys that are there are pedophiles or not.
[48:39.080 --> 48:40.080]  I don't know.
[48:40.080 --> 48:41.080]  I'm not in there.
[48:41.080 --> 48:42.800]  There is no trial like you said.
[48:42.800 --> 48:49.040]  Now the state always seems to go after the people that the masses are going to conclude
[48:49.040 --> 48:50.240]  are crazy off the bat.
[48:50.240 --> 48:54.280]  That's why we saw what happened at Waco.
[48:54.280 --> 48:58.440]  They always test it on people that are a control group.
[48:58.440 --> 49:01.920]  And what they're doing here is they're saying they're going in and making a precedent that
[49:01.920 --> 49:05.200]  they can take your kids whenever they want without a trial.
[49:05.200 --> 49:07.680]  And that's why I believe they're targeting these women.
[49:07.680 --> 49:09.720]  I feel for these women.
[49:09.720 --> 49:15.520]  But it doesn't help their cause that one of these women actually left the compound, escaped
[49:15.520 --> 49:19.000]  with their children, and is talking a lot of smack about it.
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.600]  Now I don't know what the situation there is, but I do know it's not good news for me
[49:22.600 --> 49:30.360]  and you who live what I would say normal Morae lives, one wife, kids, because they're going
[49:30.360 --> 49:35.880]  to use that precedent to inflict this rule on the rest of the population.
[49:35.880 --> 49:36.880]  Do you agree with that, Don?
[49:36.880 --> 49:41.920]  Well, another thing too, you say this one woman left the camp and she's copping out
[49:41.920 --> 49:43.960]  on them and saying they're terrible people.
[49:43.960 --> 49:46.120]  That could be a constructed event.
[49:46.120 --> 49:51.560]  It could be something that there was one woman that had already written a book about the
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.240]  whole thing well ahead of the raid, like it was planned, saying that there were terrible
[49:56.240 --> 49:57.240]  people.
[49:57.240 --> 49:59.040]  They say it's a polygamous group.
[49:59.040 --> 50:00.400]  I know a lot of Mormons.
[50:00.400 --> 50:06.680]  I used to guide hunters up in Wyoming and Idaho, and a lot of Mormon people would come
[50:06.680 --> 50:07.680]  there.
[50:07.680 --> 50:11.440]  I don't know for sure why they say it's a polygamous camp.
[50:11.440 --> 50:13.600]  I'm not proved that it's so.
[50:13.600 --> 50:17.800]  There may be some of that if they are.
[50:17.800 --> 50:24.080]  They should go through the process of the law, not just raid them and make royal proclamations
[50:24.080 --> 50:28.280]  that we've decided this without any trial.
[50:28.280 --> 50:36.040]  I think there's already been 10 or 12, 15 children that have been so upset and frightened
[50:36.040 --> 50:37.040]  and everything.
[50:37.040 --> 50:38.040]  Don, I'm with you.
[50:38.040 --> 50:39.040]  I'm with you.
[50:39.040 --> 50:40.040]  100% Don.
[50:40.040 --> 50:41.040]  There needs to be a trial.
[50:41.040 --> 50:42.040]  There needs to be due process.
[50:42.040 --> 50:43.040]  I thank you for the call.
[50:43.040 --> 50:44.280]  We're going to come back to Simon and others.
[50:44.280 --> 50:47.120]  Last segment with Luke Radowski, Alex Jones Show.
[50:47.120 --> 50:53.400]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[50:53.400 --> 50:57.880]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[50:57.880 --> 51:03.640]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that
[51:03.640 --> 51:06.480]  completely destroys the official fable forever.
[51:06.480 --> 51:10.840]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[51:10.840 --> 51:15.640]  family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[51:15.640 --> 51:17.560]  crime are brought to justice.
[51:17.560 --> 51:21.040]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[51:21.040 --> 51:25.480]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[51:25.480 --> 51:28.840]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[51:51.680 --> 51:54.520]  to Big Brother.
[51:54.520 --> 51:58.280]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[51:58.280 --> 52:00.840]  disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[52:00.840 --> 52:04.880]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and
[52:04.880 --> 52:06.560]  our high stress lifestyles.
[52:06.560 --> 52:10.680]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[52:10.680 --> 52:15.200]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[52:15.200 --> 52:16.200]  water.
[52:16.200 --> 52:20.640]  At SnyderHealth.com we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science,

[54:25.120 --> 54:26.440]  we loop it.

[54:30.640 --> 54:33.040]  Alex Jones will be back for Friday, folks.
[54:33.040 --> 54:35.160]  I'm just filling in for today.
[54:35.160 --> 54:38.680]  You can also go to the InfoWars shop and check out some of the new movies they got.
[54:38.680 --> 54:41.160]  And I got to tell you, I'm really excited about these films.
[54:41.160 --> 54:47.400]  I checked out American Drug War probably about two months ago and was thoroughly impressed
[54:47.400 --> 54:49.160]  with Kevin Booth's performance in this movie.
[54:49.160 --> 54:50.720]  This is an important film.
[54:50.720 --> 54:56.120]  This really breaks down how the CIA and other covert programs within the United States government
[54:56.120 --> 54:58.240]  ship in the hard drugs.
[54:58.240 --> 55:02.080]  They ship in the cocaine, they ship in the heroin that they get you hooked on, throw
[55:02.080 --> 55:07.360]  you in prison for, and then have you work slave labor for about $0.39 an hour for corporations
[55:07.360 --> 55:09.280]  like AT&T and others?
[55:09.280 --> 55:10.280]  You didn't know?
[55:10.280 --> 55:13.680]  Yeah, they're the ones calling you at night saying, hey, how would you like to switch
[55:13.680 --> 55:15.200]  your service?
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.320]  That's a convicted felon.
[55:16.320 --> 55:19.000]  Yeah, more times than not.
[55:19.000 --> 55:23.720]  See that way they don't have to outsource to Pakistan or Mexico or one of these other
[55:23.720 --> 55:28.200]  second or third world nations where they can pay these people slave labor wages.
[55:28.200 --> 55:32.160]  They can just pay slave labor wages in this country and privatize the prisons.
[55:32.160 --> 55:34.000]  It's all good stuff, isn't it, Luke?
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  I still got Luke with me?
[55:36.000 --> 55:40.160]  To America, which we're all living in, unless we do something, it's only going to get worse.
[55:40.160 --> 55:44.520]  Luke, before we take another call, I really just want to plug wearchange.org.
[55:44.520 --> 55:47.440]  I want to plug your YouTube site.
[55:47.440 --> 55:48.440]  What is it?
[55:48.440 --> 55:49.440]  YouTube?
[55:49.440 --> 55:52.400]  And they can just Google We Are Changed and they can see all your stuff?
[55:52.400 --> 55:54.280]  YouTube.com slash We Are Changed.
[55:54.280 --> 55:55.280]  That's right.
[55:55.280 --> 55:59.720]  And there's all sorts of stories over at Prison Planet, over at Info Wars.
[55:59.720 --> 56:01.880]  Aaron Dykes does a great job over here.
[56:01.880 --> 56:05.760]  The Watson boys out in the UK, they do an awesome job at InfoWars.net.
[56:05.760 --> 56:08.040]  Yeah, I wanted to thank those guys.
[56:08.040 --> 56:09.200]  Those guys are awesome.
[56:09.200 --> 56:10.200]  They really are.
[56:10.200 --> 56:11.360]  I love those guys.
[56:11.360 --> 56:16.400]  Let me plug Paul Joseph Watson's book really quick because Order Out of Chaos for me was
[56:16.400 --> 56:19.200]  the quintessential New World Order book.
[56:19.200 --> 56:21.920]  Okay, it's very easy read.
[56:21.920 --> 56:27.920]  It's very well sourced and it's not over the top, folks.
[56:27.920 --> 56:32.120]  Everything in that book is the real deal.
[56:32.120 --> 56:36.000]  I'd like to commend Paul Joseph Watson for what he does over there.
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  He's a hard worker.
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.800]  He puts together some great stories and I love those guys.
[56:40.800 --> 56:42.000]  They're awesome guys.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.840]  So let's take one more caller before we go into the break to the second hour.
[56:45.840 --> 56:48.440]  Simon in California, how are you doing, man?
[56:48.440 --> 56:49.840]  How do you do, gentlemen?
[56:49.840 --> 56:50.840]  Good.
[56:50.840 --> 56:57.960]  I'd just like to say I really appreciate what yourself and Luke and all the others are
[56:57.960 --> 56:58.960]  doing.
[56:58.960 --> 57:03.360]  I'm going to make this call as quickly as possible because I know you guys have got a
[57:03.360 --> 57:09.600]  lot going on, but just to give you a feel for my background, I spent nine years with
[57:09.600 --> 57:13.840]  the British Special Forces as a former Lieutenant Colonel.
[57:13.840 --> 57:19.320]  I've managed to wake up a good friend of mine that's now left the service.
[57:19.320 --> 57:25.880]  He actually served in the Pentagon, so I'd like to make that my first point is the fact
[57:25.880 --> 57:36.440]  that you can't approach the Pentagon at least 150 miles out without being detected, so they've
[57:36.440 --> 57:40.640]  obviously, there's obviously an inside job going on there.
[57:40.640 --> 57:48.840]  With the damage that was caused, it is almost identical to the firing of an exoset missile,
[57:48.840 --> 57:58.000]  which actually can be launched from a carrier and a number of other forms of transport.
[57:58.000 --> 58:04.400]  My second point is that the witnesses that say they saw various planes on 9-11 in New
[58:04.400 --> 58:05.400]  York.
[58:05.400 --> 58:07.400]  Obviously, I wasn't there.
[58:07.400 --> 58:08.400]  Listen, Simon, stick around.
[58:08.400 --> 58:10.320]  We're going to bring you over to the second hour.
[58:10.320 --> 58:12.120]  Luke, thank you so much for joining us.
[58:12.120 --> 58:14.000]  We are change.org.
[58:14.000 --> 58:15.000]  Get ready.
[58:15.000 --> 58:43.680]  We're coming up, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[58:43.680 --> 58:46.040]  It is a big idea.
[58:46.040 --> 58:47.880]  A New World Order.
[58:47.880 --> 58:52.480]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[58:52.480 --> 58:58.480]  It's known as the Builderburg Group, but their objective being world domination.
[58:58.480 --> 59:01.640]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:01.640 --> 59:07.560]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[59:07.560 --> 59:09.920]  of humanity is at hand.
[59:09.920 --> 59:17.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:17.080 --> 59:21.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:21.360 --> 59:24.040]  Builderburg is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.040 --> 59:25.840]  Most people have no idea they're not after money.
[59:25.840 --> 59:27.160]  They have all the money they need.
[59:27.160 --> 59:28.160]  They're after power.
[59:28.160 --> 59:29.160]  That's their after-easy.

[59:36.800 --> 59:37.800]  In-game.
[59:37.800 --> 59:40.800]  Blue prep for global enslavement.
[59:40.800 --> 59:46.000]  You have been warned.
[59:46.000 --> 59:57.640]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:57.640 --> 59:59.040]  Government cover-ups.
[59:59.040 --> 1:00:00.040]  You want answers?
[1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:02.280]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:12.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:13.520]  We are back.
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:15.440]  It is the second hour of the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:22.720]  I am Jason Bermas of Loose Change and you can get Loose Change over at LooseChangeTheFinalCut.com
[1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:28.080]  infowars.com or you can check out my blog over at LooseChange911.com.
[1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:31.480]  Not only do we have all the events that we're doing, where it's being shown, where you can
[1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:35.680]  get Loose Change Final Cut, but you know, I comment on a lot of other things.
[1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:39.560]  We've got Mark Dice on the line, but first I want to finish up with Simon in California
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:41.440]  and his points about the Pentagon.
[1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:45.920]  It definitely does look like some kind of projectile fire when you have that small hole
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:51.120]  and that exit hole that's almost exactly the same size through the third ring at about
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:53.840]  16 feet, doesn't it, Simon?
[1:00:53.840 --> 1:00:54.840]  Exactly.
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:01:01.080]  And the friend of mine that's actually resigned his commission now because of what I've helped
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:09.880]  wake him up to and what he's found out by serving with the U.S. Navy in Hawaii.
[1:01:09.880 --> 1:01:13.640]  He just can't be, just initially couldn't believe what was going on, the way that they're
[1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:20.640]  lying to people and all of these secret operations are going on, that people don't know about
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:25.160]  and as soon as you speak out, they call you a liar.
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:31.880]  I mean, an example is a colleague of mine, Ben Griffin, that's the first SAS soldier
[1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:40.440]  to refuse to go back and fight in Iraq because he's made efforts to get it out there that
[1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:48.200]  David Milliband from the U.K. Parliament is basically saying that the U.K. has no involvement
[1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:53.640]  in extraordinary rendition when everybody knows that as soon as you hand a prisoner
[1:01:53.640 --> 1:02:02.960]  over to the U.S. authorities, that that person is going to be abused and tortured and it's
[1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:03.960]  a disgrace.
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:08.240]  It is a disgrace, Ben, and you know what, they've just passed more and more legislation
[1:02:08.240 --> 1:02:13.080]  to continue to let this happen from Patriot Acts 1 and 2 to parts of Patriot Act 3 to
[1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:14.600]  the Military Commissions Act.
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:17.480]  There is no end in sight unless we wake up the populace.
[1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:24.240]  Simon, I thank you for the call, we are now going to go to Mark Dice of markdice.com or
[1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:30.000]  theresistancemanifesto.com and author and activist and all around great guy.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:32.120]  Mark, how you doing, man?
[1:02:32.120 --> 1:02:33.120]  Pretty good, man.
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:37.800]  You know, just sitting here listening to the We Are Change crew, just making some good
[1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:38.800]  headway.
[1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:42.720]  I'm looking back at when I first heard of Luke, he had won, I had a contest when I was
[1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:48.000]  doing a radio show for GCN on the best 9-11 Truth Jam video and they had gotten out and
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:53.400]  confronted Silverstein's goons outside of New Building 7 and, man, I tell you, just
[1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:58.920]  every single week they just continue to bring it and I just cannot believe the amount of
[1:02:58.920 --> 1:02:59.920]  headway.
[1:02:59.920 --> 1:03:01.000]  These guys are working so hard, man.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:05.600]  We need more people to just get up and get in people's faces and I just want to tip my
[1:03:05.600 --> 1:03:09.840]  hat to Luke and to everybody in We Are Change and just keep up the good work, guys.
[1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:13.440]  You guys are some brave, brave individuals, man.
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:16.440]  Yeah, I mean, they are number one targets over in the media, too.
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:21.120]  I mean, when you're watching Fox and Friends and they're saying, they're going after everybody.
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:22.880]  Like we're a left or right organization.
[1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:23.880]  Folks, we're not.
[1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:25.200]  We're a right and wrong organization.
[1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:29.640]  We don't believe in these false paradigms of conservatism and liberalism.
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:30.640]  It's the same thing.
[1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.360]  It's all about one thing and that's globalism.
[1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:34.760]  It's about this new world order.
[1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:37.160]  If you don't like it, if you don't like the term, that's too bad.
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:38.480]  It's not my term.
[1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:39.480]  It's not Mark's term.
[1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:46.320]  It's a term used by Bill Clinton, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, George Bush, Gary Hart.
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:03:50.400]  You know, Jason, I want to mention something since we've got a pretty big listenership
[1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:55.600]  here for anybody who does want to get involved but just doesn't have access to these criminals
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.400]  or doesn't want to get in front of a loud, loud crowd of people and start giving a speech.
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:06.040]  The one thing that's very effective is the phone mobbing or the phone jamming, as I
[1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:07.040]  call it.
[1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:11.920]  I'll just put out the word, let's organize a phone mob for Sean Hannity today and tomorrow
[1:04:11.920 --> 1:04:13.960]  and my Lord every day if we can.
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:19.440]  But his show comes on in about two hours and basically call into the show, an article
[1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:20.440]  about how to do this.
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:25.680]  I should get it up on theresistancemanifesto.com and we'll explain that a little bit later
[1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:26.920]  on the other side of the break.
[1:04:26.920 --> 1:04:27.920]  But let's get organized.
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:29.120]  Let's call on to Hannity.
[1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:33.360]  Let's make every single phone call on his show today a call about 9-11 Truth.
[1:04:33.360 --> 1:04:36.400]  Mark Dice, a true patriot pioneer, folks.
[1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:37.600]  He's letting you know how you can help.
[1:04:37.600 --> 1:04:40.440]  We're going to talk more about it on the other side and take your calls.
[1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:49.800]  It's the Alex Jones show.
[1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:51.760]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:55.440]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:57.800]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[1:04:57.800 --> 1:05:00.880]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:05.080]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:06.640]  World Order master plan.
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:10.880]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:16.120]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[1:05:16.120 --> 1:05:19.080]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:32.320]  online video library.
[1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:36.480]  By weekly news, television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews and so much
[1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:37.480]  more.

[1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:49.880]  to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the New World Order, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:05:49.880 --> 1:05:54.360]  U.S. CivilFlags.org is here to help Americans remember as well as our leaders that every
[1:05:54.360 --> 1:05:58.520]  man and woman is sovereign and that we're all endowed by our Creator with life, liberty

[1:06:49.920 --> 1:06:53.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:58.640]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes and more?
[1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:03.200]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[1:07:03.200 --> 1:07:04.200]  are synthetic.
[1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:05.640]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[1:07:05.640 --> 1:07:09.320]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:13.800]  coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin and
[1:07:13.800 --> 1:07:14.800]  mucous membranes.
[1:07:14.800 --> 1:07:20.520]  Now compare cowbell and pure soap, all natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:25.440]  testing, they're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products
[1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:26.440]  now.

[1:07:50.800 --> 1:08:02.120]  Ease the T-Rex of Political Talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:03.120]  And we are back folks.
[1:08:03.120 --> 1:08:07.440]  It is the Alex Jones show on the 24th of April this Thursday.
[1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:13.080]  I am Jason Bermas in for Alex Jones and you know, Mark was talking about if you don't
[1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:14.840]  want to be, you know, we are change.
[1:08:14.840 --> 1:08:19.040]  If you can't do what Luke Radowski does so well, there are other ways you can get on
[1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:20.040]  the phone.
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:24.360]  You can be online for an hour and wait to ask Sean Hannity a real question, wait to
[1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:30.400]  ask Bill O'Reilly a real question, wait to ask Rush Limbaugh a real question and it's
[1:08:30.400 --> 1:08:31.560]  not just the Republican side.
[1:08:31.560 --> 1:08:34.960]  You need to go after some of these supposed Democrats too.
[1:08:34.960 --> 1:08:39.200]  You know, the guys over at Scarborough, you know, let's get those guys, they're kind
[1:08:39.200 --> 1:08:40.400]  of pseudo-Republicans.
[1:08:40.400 --> 1:08:44.920]  Tucker Carlson's another, you know, he presents himself as a libertarian, but he's garbage.
[1:08:44.920 --> 1:08:46.280]  All these guys have radio shows.
[1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:47.680]  They're not just on the television.
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:52.280]  And it's a lot more easy to penetrate them through that.
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:56.600]  And if you can't do that, I got to tell you, there's a huge Wikipedia page about loose
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:57.600]  change.
[1:08:57.600 --> 1:09:01.040]  Now nobody has laid out loose change final cut in this Wikipedia page yet.
[1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:02.800]  It's all about the second edition.
[1:09:02.800 --> 1:09:04.320]  There's about 150 sources.
[1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:08.920]  I'd like to see somebody go on that page and write about the final cut, go through point
[1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:12.400]  by point, the evidence that's presented in there, because this is an airtight film.
[1:09:12.400 --> 1:09:16.920]  I mean, we proved beyond a reasonable doubt that not only were we lied to about 9-11,
[1:09:16.920 --> 1:09:22.760]  but the powers that be covered it up and then used it to invade two sovereign nations and
[1:09:22.760 --> 1:09:25.960]  really declare a war on the American people, Mark.
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:30.880]  And we're still under that jackboot, if you will, of the Patriot Act, of the Military
[1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:34.160]  Commissions Act, the end of habeas corpus in this country.
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:39.160]  And they continue to take more away, and they continue to impose their will, man.
[1:09:39.160 --> 1:09:43.520]  And I really do believe that the only way that we're going to win this thing is to get
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:47.520]  information out to people, to do things like you've done, like, I'm sitting here watching
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:52.200]  them edit this new film, The 9-11 Chronicles, which you have a prominent role in, Mark.
[1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:56.280]  And you're sitting in a packed library in a college.
[1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:57.280]  Everybody's quiet.
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:00.400]  And you just, well, why don't you tell them, what do you do?
[1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:05.640]  Well, you can check the video out on YouTube, just search for me on YouTube.
[1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:10.560]  But I just kind of pretended to be a student that was doing some research on the Internet.
[1:10:10.560 --> 1:10:16.960]  And to my shock and dismay, I discovered that Operation Northwoods existed.
[1:10:16.960 --> 1:10:22.480]  And like any ordinary person would that discovered such a thing, I was just shocked.
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:28.440]  And I just couldn't contain my disgust in the quiet library.
[1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:30.480]  I want to touch back on this phone mob.
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:33.400]  I really think that this is a great, a great idea.
[1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:36.440]  And I know that there's a lot of people out there that have tried to call into these shows
[1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:41.400]  and they get frustrated because they hit redial for 10 or 15 minutes and then just feel like
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:42.400]  they can't get through.
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:44.280]  So let me just let out my secret here.
[1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:45.680]  This is how it's done.
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:51.680]  And I think it would be a great idea if we could just mob the show with 10, 10, 20 callers
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:54.360]  today who get through today and tomorrow on the Sean Hannity Show.
[1:10:54.360 --> 1:10:56.200]  Let's really send these clowns a message.
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:10:59.760]  And here's how it's done, instead of just calling in, you know, 15, 20 minutes into
[1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:03.080]  the show, an hour into the show, you have to have the phone number ready.
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:07.880]  You have to call into the show about five minutes before the show even goes to air.
[1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:12.600]  So look up the phone number or go to my site and I have most of the phone numbers for most
[1:11:12.600 --> 1:11:17.720]  of the big shots and start calling into the show about five or 10 minutes before the show
[1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:20.840]  even goes to air and just let it ring and ring and ring.
[1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:23.200]  And then sooner or later the call screener will pick it up.
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:27.600]  You feed them some bogus topic, pick one of the main topics of the day and just have an
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:28.720]  opinion on it.
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:30.200]  They'll put you on hold.
[1:11:30.200 --> 1:11:34.520]  And then that way maybe 30 minutes, an hour into the show, Sean Hannity will go to your
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:41.040]  call and they'll say, let's go to Jason in Austin, Texas and just fire away with your
[1:11:41.040 --> 1:11:43.080]  real question and your real topic.
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:44.840]  They have no idea who you are.
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:49.880]  You just have some comment about Clinton winning the Pennsylvania primary or have some comment
[1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:57.080]  about Barack Obama or say you used to be a liberal but now you've been listening to Hannity
[1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:01.880]  and you think you're coming around and then as soon as he goes to your question, you can
[1:12:01.880 --> 1:12:05.880]  hear this funny little sound in the phone and they'll just say, let's go to so-and-so
[1:12:05.880 --> 1:12:08.760]  and whatever city you're in and just fire it away.
[1:12:08.760 --> 1:12:11.880]  And if you plug a website, they're going to use the seven second delay so your call is
[1:12:11.880 --> 1:12:13.040]  probably going to be wasted.
[1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:18.000]  So just bring up an issue and let's have statements, pre-planned, let's have questions
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:24.840]  and let's just fill his phone board full of questions and comments about 9-11 truth.
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:27.440]  Let's ask him, have you seen loose change, final cut?
[1:12:27.440 --> 1:12:29.680]  How do you explain Operation Northwood?
[1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:33.480]  Any question that you can think of, let's really send these clowns a message and that's
[1:12:33.480 --> 1:12:37.720]  the key how to do it because if you call in halfway through the show, he's giving up
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:38.720]  the phone numbers.
[1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:39.720]  Do you have a question or a comment?
[1:12:39.720 --> 1:12:42.840]  Give me a call at 1-100 Sean Hannity.
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:43.840]  You're never going to get through.
[1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:46.120]  The phone lines are going to be busy forever.
[1:12:46.120 --> 1:12:51.000]  So you have to call in before the show goes to air, get the phone numbers, get the time.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.440]  So he goes to air in about an hour and 45 minutes.
[1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:59.440]  So before this broadcast comes to an end, I suggest everybody get their phone ready,
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:03.920]  get the phone number on my site or just Google Sean Hannity, go to his home page.
[1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:05.640]  I think he's got the phone number there.
[1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:09.520]  And if you can, do it on a landline with a speaker phone because you'll be on hold for
[1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:14.120]  a half an hour, an hour sometimes and it can be really annoying sitting there with a phone
[1:13:14.120 --> 1:13:15.120]  on your ear.
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:19.120]  So what I do when I've done this is I sit at my desk, I call in on my landline, I put
[1:13:19.120 --> 1:13:22.040]  it on speaker phone, I'm surfing the internet, I'm doing other things.
[1:13:22.040 --> 1:13:25.800]  As soon as he says, let's go back to our phones, let's go to Mark in San Diego, then
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:29.760]  I just pick up the phone so I'm not on speaker phone anymore so that it sounds clear and
[1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:32.200]  I just ask him about a particular issue.
[1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:37.120]  That's how it's done and if you don't want to risk getting in these clown spaces and
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:43.560]  these criminal spaces, if you just can't do that, you can speak to millions and millions
[1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:49.840]  of people instead of just handing out DVDs at a local school or in your community, just
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:53.520]  imagine one phone call, you can speak to millions of people.
[1:13:53.520 --> 1:13:58.880]  I've had people email me that they have heard me, people who had no idea who I was and then
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:03.120]  after Googling Bohemian Grove and Operation Northwood, they've emailed me and they said,
[1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:07.200]  dude, I heard you call into Sean Hannity or Michael Savage show six months ago, I thought
[1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:09.640]  you were crazy, I found your site, I think it's great.
[1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:14.840]  So let's do, let's phone mob these criminals every day, that's how it's done, let's cause
[1:14:14.840 --> 1:14:20.000]  them to put a caller ID system on their phone call so that they're going to have to block
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:24.840]  our numbers from getting through to the system because we're just going to jam their phone
[1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:29.920]  lines and we're going to crash their show and we're going to shove 9-11 truth and other
[1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:32.560]  New World Order issues down their throat.
[1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:38.480]  Folks, you have your marching orders from a man who practices what he preaches.
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:43.320]  Mark Dice has been doing this for a long time, how, when did you get started, Mark?
[1:14:43.320 --> 1:14:49.880]  Oh man, you know, I was a latecomer and I was, I was a right wing Republican and I,
[1:14:49.880 --> 1:14:56.120]  before I had the time to take a step back and really look at what was going on.
[1:14:56.120 --> 1:15:03.520]  It was late 2000, 2004 when, when I really started figuring it out and I was doing research
[1:15:03.520 --> 1:15:08.720]  on the Verichip, I was, I was pretty, pretty interested in the technology aspect of the
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:13.320]  New World Order and a big brother and I was familiar with 1984 and how technology was
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:14.320]  going to enslave us.
[1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:16.400]  That's how I came across Alex Jones.
[1:15:16.400 --> 1:15:19.920]  I found a video on the file sharing network that he had done about Verichip.
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:24.880]  I had found some other videos about him and, and I was just so shocked.
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:28.880]  And at that time it was, it was very scary and dangerous to speak out about such a thing
[1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:34.640]  and people, people would think that you were literally mentally ill if you were to bring
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:39.360]  up such issues and now, you know, almost everybody that I talked to, at least if they
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:42.800]  don't believe it, they say, well, you know, I've either heard of that or most people
[1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:44.600]  now are saying, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:48.560]  I haven't looked into it that much because not, not everybody has a lot of time.
[1:15:48.560 --> 1:15:53.520]  We're very busy people and I had a job that had a lot of free time on it.
[1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:58.120]  So my co-workers and I could do some research on the job and wait hours and hours.
[1:15:58.120 --> 1:15:59.120]  We just lost Mark Dice.
[1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:00.120]  Oh no, you're back, Mark.
[1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:01.120]  Mark, you there?
[1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:02.120]  Yeah, I'm here.
[1:16:02.120 --> 1:16:03.120]  I'm sorry, we lost for a second.
[1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:04.120]  Go ahead.
[1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:08.360]  Well, I had a lot of free time on a job and then my co-workers and I would research this
[1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:13.280]  and then the company that I was working for closed and went out of business and I was
[1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:16.320]  in between jobs for about nine months and that's when I wrote the manifesto.
[1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:22.320]  So I did nothing for about six months, but sit, sit up until two, three in the morning
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:27.840]  every night and research and write and I kind of wrote the manifesto as a research paper
[1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:33.680]  for myself and for others because I was coming across this and when you do a research paper
[1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:36.320]  and you're typing it, you yourself are learning.
[1:16:36.320 --> 1:16:41.760]  So I've documented it for myself and to share with other people and if you want to copy
[1:16:41.760 --> 1:16:45.920]  the manifesto, it's almost out of print, so you can go and get it soon.
[1:16:45.920 --> 1:16:53.440]  But man, I just can't express how frustrated I was when I first came across this and that's
[1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:58.200]  why I just bust out of the gate and just with every ounce of energy that I had and every
[1:16:58.200 --> 1:17:02.760]  breath that I had tried to make this aware and it's people like you and it's people
[1:17:02.760 --> 1:17:06.960]  like Luke and it's people like this audience that have felt that same way that I think
[1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:11.440]  and we've talked about this all fair Jason that have, I think has prevented another false
[1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:16.480]  flag attack from happening because if anything happens now as they're going to the people
[1:17:16.480 --> 1:17:21.920]  I believe are going to rise up and even if it is a lone nut that has no connection to
[1:17:21.920 --> 1:17:29.840]  MKUltra or to any group of the New World Order Illuminati complex, I do believe that anything
[1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:32.560]  that happens, the public aren't going to stand for it.
[1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:33.560]  They've heard this.
[1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:35.760]  Their friends have been beating this into their heads.
[1:17:35.760 --> 1:17:40.560]  I mean, Jesse Ventura's own son brought a loose change of attention to him.
[1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:47.880]  Michael Smirkonnis, this other Neocon host that fills in for Sean Hannity, his own son
[1:17:47.880 --> 1:17:52.080]  mentioned that he had brought up loose change at the dinner table.
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:56.880]  So everybody knows and we just need to keep it up and like my dad says, the squeaky wheel
[1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:57.880]  gets the grease.
[1:17:57.880 --> 1:17:59.800]  So let's just continue to squeak.
[1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:05.280]  I totally agree with you there and what I think we need to do is just continue to hand
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:08.560]  out the UDs, continue to be We Are Change.
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:11.200]  TruthAction.org does something on the 11th of every month.
[1:18:11.200 --> 1:18:19.200]  There is really no excuse to get involved other than slothfulness and laziness and fear.
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:21.960]  And for me, I can't live in fear.
[1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:26.200]  I got nothing but love in my heart and I really do believe that love can overcome.
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:27.840]  I mean, I love my freedoms.
[1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:28.840]  I love my country.
[1:18:28.840 --> 1:18:30.360]  I love my family.
[1:18:30.360 --> 1:18:36.240]  And if I want to maintain what they're allowing me to have at this point, because we don't
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:40.600]  have all the same rights, you know, they can come down and close, we have to fight this.
[1:18:40.600 --> 1:18:44.400]  We have to get geared up.
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:45.840]  We have to be pumped up.
[1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:47.440]  We have to share the websites.
[1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:49.480]  We have to call into these other shows.
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:53.840]  It's not just about preaching to the choir, which I'm probably doing with this audience.
[1:18:53.840 --> 1:18:57.160]  You know, it's about reaching out to other people.
[1:18:57.160 --> 1:19:00.680]  I mean, I just got myself a new place out here in Austin while I'm going to be here
[1:19:00.680 --> 1:19:03.080]  in, you know, for about a month or whatever.
[1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:05.520]  And I just met my cousin for the very first time.
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:09.080]  I met him when he was like six weeks old and I was like six or seven years old.
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:10.080]  And he's 19.
[1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:11.960]  He's a UT student.
[1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:16.280]  And it was just this weekend and we're driving through Austin, Texas, and he's pointing
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:20.440]  out the buildings and he goes to me, oh, look, there's the Owl building.
[1:19:20.440 --> 1:19:21.640]  And I go right away.
[1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:22.960]  It clicks in my head.
[1:19:22.960 --> 1:19:23.960]  The Owl building.
[1:19:23.960 --> 1:19:24.960]  Well, how does he know about that?
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:27.800]  And I asked him about the Owl building and he doesn't think it's, you know, what I know
[1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:28.800]  it is.
[1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:30.600]  Mark, you're going to stay with us for one more segment?
[1:19:30.600 --> 1:19:31.600]  We're here.
[1:19:31.600 --> 1:19:32.600]  Awesome.
[1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:33.600]  All right.
[1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:34.600]  We're going to be back one more segment with Mark Dice.
[1:19:34.600 --> 1:19:35.800]  Then we're going to go to your calls.

[1:19:56.480 --> 1:20:01.040]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government is known as the Bilderberg.
[1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:06.480]  Both their objective being world domination or thousands of years.
[1:20:06.480 --> 1:20:11.200]  Their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order.
[1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:18.680]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:23.680]  For the first time in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open.

[1:20:28.040 --> 1:20:30.640]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:31.640]  Most people have no idea.
[1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:32.640]  They're not after money.
[1:20:32.640 --> 1:20:33.640]  They have all the money they need.

[1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:15.600]  Jason Burmese, my guest is Mark Dice of TheResistanceManifesto.com, and if you miss any of this, you can
[1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:20.680]  check it out on the loop over at infowars.com, and those that are prisonplanet.tv subscribers,
[1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:26.640]  which is literally 15 cents a day folks, 15 cents a day, I mean, for the week, you still
[1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:30.640]  couldn't even buy a cup of coffee with what they're charging for this, I think it's like
[1:24:30.640 --> 1:24:35.440]  217 across the street, so, it's just an incredible deal, you can see my pretty face in the fourth
[1:24:35.440 --> 1:24:39.240]  hour, I'm going to be having the student scholars for 9-11 Truth On, and you can go to Info
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:43.680]  Wars and check out Washington You're Fired, now this film, you're thinking, oh this is
[1:24:43.680 --> 1:24:48.360]  a new guy, this is William Lewis, I've never heard of him before, well actually, he edited
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:53.960]  both of Davon Klyce's pictures in plain sight and Ripple Effect, and Mark, you and I, off
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:57.680]  the air, probably about a month ago, were talking about what a talented editor he is,
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:02.520]  I have not seen Washington You're Fired, but it's asking the questions, was Bush using
[1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:08.520]  the NSA to spy on Americans before September 11th, yes, and if so, why didn't the Bush
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:13.240]  administration connect the dots and stop the attacks from occurring, well, any of our listeners
[1:25:13.240 --> 1:25:17.440]  know why they didn't connect the dots, it's because not only were they criminally complicit
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:23.280]  in the funding of the attack, they were also criminally complicit in the actual operational
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:28.440]  arm of 9-11, all the evidence shows it, folks, I mean, the running drills of hijacked aircraft
[1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:34.720]  hitting building that morning out of the National Reconnaissance Office at 8.45, it's ridiculous,
[1:25:34.720 --> 1:25:41.640]  it's unbelievable really, that we have been led down this road of 19 radical Islamists
[1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:46.760]  basically having NORAT stand down and changing our entire foreign and domestic policy in
[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:52.120]  this country. Mark, you know, you're working on a new project, I don't want to give anything
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:55.200]  away, but when do you think this new project's going to be done, when do you think you're
[1:25:55.200 --> 1:26:00.160]  going to be announcing it? I'm thinking probably by the end of the summer, it's basically
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:10.360]  been done and ready to roll, just my recent problems with the IRS have delayed the publication,
[1:26:10.360 --> 1:26:14.440]  you know, if you're going to fight the taxes, maybe the best thing to do is to educate others
[1:26:14.440 --> 1:26:20.520]  instead of just not paying your taxes, because I basically have said for years to screw you
[1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:30.000]  to the IRS and then they came back and said, no, no screw you, and so the new project,
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:34.680]  you know, it's been something that I was working on for many, many years, just as a kind of
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:42.320]  a personal inquest, and I kind of set it aside to release the manifesto and to study the
[1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:48.400]  New World Order and to get information out, and it's not directly involved with 9-11
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.160]  or the New World Order, but I think that much of the audience is going to appreciate it
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:57.760]  and will benefit from it and will find it very beneficial, and so I just don't want
[1:26:57.760 --> 1:27:03.760]  to let the cat out of the bag just yet, but I think it's going to be very appreciated
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:09.280]  by many, many people, and it's needed in some cases, and that's truly all that I have
[1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:11.520]  to say, but it's pretty much done.
[1:27:11.520 --> 1:27:15.720]  Just the lack of funds is holding it back from being released, and I think it's going
[1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:16.720]  to be very exciting.
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:19.920]  I can't wait to hear what people have to say when it is finally ready to go.
[1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:24.840]  And you can go to the ResistanceManifesto.com and see a little preview, YouTube video that
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:25.840]  Mark has put up.
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:29.760]  Mark, we're going to go to the calls and take calls in your final segment here.
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:31.760]  Let's go to Daisy in Florida.
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:34.760]  Daisy, are you with us?
[1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:35.760]  Hi.
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:36.760]  Hello.
[1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:37.760]  Hello.
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:38.760]  Hey, Daisy.
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:39.760]  How are you doing?
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:40.760]  Good.
[1:27:40.760 --> 1:27:41.760]  How are you?
[1:27:41.760 --> 1:27:46.760]  I've had a comment about the FLDS raid.
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:54.760]  I don't understand their reasoning for doing that, except to send a message to all of our
[1:27:54.760 --> 1:28:01.520]  citizens, and I think we need to help them in their defense, because I don't give my
[1:28:01.520 --> 1:28:08.800]  children vaccinations, and so they won't be able to attend public school because the religious
[1:28:08.800 --> 1:28:12.760]  waivers are not being upheld everywhere anymore.
[1:28:12.760 --> 1:28:14.760]  Which is ridiculous and criminal, by the way.
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:17.760]  There's no reason you should be shooting your kids with poison.
[1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:18.760]  Yes.
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:25.680]  My sister-in-law has gotten calls from the Child Protective Service by trying to use
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:31.360]  her religious waiver, and she has all boys, and so it's really dangerous for her.
[1:28:31.360 --> 1:28:33.360]  To be given them the shot.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.080]  Well, they've now made it illegal to homeschool your children in California unless you are
[1:28:37.080 --> 1:28:38.760]  a licensed teacher.
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:39.760]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:44.120]  They are really trying to indoctrinate our children at this point at a whole new level.
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:45.120]  Yes.
[1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:50.600]  My sister-in-law was looking into homeschooling her children when she got the call from the
[1:28:50.600 --> 1:28:54.560]  Child Protective Services, and they told her that she couldn't do that unless she had
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:58.400]  a two-year teaching certificate.
[1:28:58.400 --> 1:29:03.880]  And since her children are really small, and only one is school age, she has no way to
[1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:08.440]  go to school to get that teaching certificate right now.
[1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:15.280]  So it's stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I really see them using this to come and
[1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:16.680]  get my kids next.
[1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:20.560]  Daisy, I feel for you, and I totally agree, and keep fighting.
[1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:22.120]  Don't poison your children.
[1:29:22.120 --> 1:29:23.280]  Educate them in the right way.
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:24.560]  I thank you for the call, Mark.
[1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:30.400]  I thank you for so much for being on with me for half an hour, theresistancemanifesto.com.
[1:29:30.400 --> 1:29:31.400]  Anything else you want to say, quick?
[1:29:31.400 --> 1:29:34.680]  Let's do the phone mob information posted now on how to do it.
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:35.680]  You heard it here.
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:36.680]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:40.520]  We'll be back after this.
[1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:41.800]  We're on the march.
[1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:44.240]  The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:50.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:53.840]  Yes, there is an in-dash AMFM shortwave radio.

[1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:38.200]  These radios are not available anywhere else, and for a limited time, so call now.
[1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:41.200]  Call 877-817-9829.
[1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:48.960]  That's 877-817-9829 and get your Sony GT160S AMFM shortwave radio and CD player from the
[1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:50.520]  power hour.
[1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:54.240]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle MD, I'm the Neutromatical Report here on Genesys.
[1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:58.160]  Allicin's Natural Antibiotic from Allamax Neutrocyticals US is a real thing.
[1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:04.480]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for a fresh, never-before-available
[1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:05.480]  garlic.
[1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:09.960]  Allicin's molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi,
[1:31:09.960 --> 1:31:15.080]  parasites, TB, and it kills flesh and bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections, and ravage
[1:31:15.080 --> 1:31:16.080]  or everyday health.

[1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:49.880]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:51.920]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:55.240]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[1:31:55.240 --> 1:31:59.120]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their
[1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:00.120]  own vehicles?
[1:32:00.120 --> 1:32:03.080]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:07.400]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies
[1:32:07.400 --> 1:32:10.160]  have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:14.640]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment
[1:32:14.640 --> 1:32:16.040]  found at your local store.
[1:32:16.040 --> 1:32:18.240]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:22.360]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[1:32:22.360 --> 1:32:27.240]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong
[1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:32.300]  that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get
[1:32:32.300 --> 1:32:33.960]  another one free of charge.
[1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:38.400]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price
[1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:39.400]  in shipping.
[1:32:39.400 --> 1:32:42.400]  You can share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:45.280]  Call 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:32:45.280 --> 1:33:13.640]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1 today.

[1:50:15.880 --> 1:50:41.840]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:50:41.840 --> 1:51:07.800]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:33.760]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:59.720]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:51:59.720 --> 1:52:25.680]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:51.640]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:52:51.640 --> 1:53:17.600]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:53:17.600 --> 1:53:43.560]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:53:43.560 --> 1:54:09.520]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:54:09.520 --> 1:54:35.480]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:54:35.480 --> 1:55:01.440]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:27.400]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:55:27.400 --> 1:55:53.360]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:55:53.360 --> 1:56:19.320]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:45.280]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:56:45.280 --> 1:57:11.240]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:57:11.240 --> 1:57:37.200]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:57:37.200 --> 1:58:03.160]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:58:03.160 --> 1:58:29.120]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:55.080]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:58:55.080 --> 1:59:21.040]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[1:59:21.040 --> 1:59:48.000]  That's 888-USE-SFR-1.
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:11.160]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:14.560]  We are at the top of the third hour of this global transmission.
[2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:19.000]  Again, if you miss any of this stuff, you can go to infowars.com and it will play on
[2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  a loop.
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:23.960]  The next hour is not only going to be me alive in the studio, but you're going to be able
[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:27.120]  to see the document cam and you're going to see some video.
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:30.560]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, we're going to have student scholars for 9-11 Truth
[2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:31.560]  with us.
[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:33.080]  Justin Martell, I'm a huge fan.
[2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:37.440]  This hour, we have Jonathan Ellenoff on the line, but let's just finish up with Mike in
[2:00:37.440 --> 2:00:40.480]  Maryland, who was an Army personnel.
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:43.960]  His wife was in the Pentagon as it was struck in a secure location.
[2:00:43.960 --> 2:00:47.720]  He gets down there and he says it looks like a bunker buster.
[2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:49.360]  It does not look like a plane hit it.
[2:00:49.360 --> 2:00:51.080]  I just want to get your opinion.
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:56.560]  What do you think of the photographs of the supposed plane parts after the fact that were
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:01:00.200]  released, Mike?
[2:01:00.200 --> 2:01:03.040]  Mike, you still with me?
[2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:04.040]  Maybe we dropped them.
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:05.040]  All right.
[2:01:05.040 --> 2:01:09.680]  Well, I guess we're just going to have to move on without Mike.
[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:11.000]  It was a very interesting call.
[2:01:11.000 --> 2:01:16.920]  I would have liked to get his opinion on what he saw that day as opposed to what was published
[2:01:16.920 --> 2:01:18.240]  later on.
[2:01:18.240 --> 2:01:20.520]  But that's the brakes.
[2:01:20.520 --> 2:01:25.200]  That's okay because we have Jonathan Ellenoff of We Are Changed Colorado online.
[2:01:25.200 --> 2:01:28.920]  The work that they have done is simply outstanding.
[2:01:28.920 --> 2:01:33.000]  From the Gary Hart interview to getting us to come out there to the upcoming stuff at
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:37.880]  the DNC, I'm just glad to know the guy and I'm glad to have spent a week with him.
[2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:40.200]  He's a very intelligent young man.
[2:01:40.200 --> 2:01:45.560]  If there is a group out there that does deserve a donation or your attention and your help,
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:50.200]  it is We Are Changed Colorado because they keep pushing forward, they keep moving on,
[2:01:50.200 --> 2:01:54.240]  and they keep putting out tons of great stuff over at TruthAlliance.net.
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:55.480]  Jonathan, are you there, buddy?
[2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:57.440]  How's it going, Jason?
[2:01:57.440 --> 2:01:58.440]  It's going awesome.
[2:01:58.440 --> 2:02:00.880]  I'm really psyched to have you on the show.
[2:02:00.880 --> 2:02:08.160]  I really did want to get into what you came on the Alex Jones show last week about.
[2:02:08.160 --> 2:02:15.480]  I don't want to name any specific names, but this organization gets this permit to protest
[2:02:15.480 --> 2:02:20.400]  at the DNC while you and other organizations have had nothing but trouble to do so.
[2:02:20.400 --> 2:02:27.360]  Then you go to their website and they literally have a PDF file on how to build a shield.
[2:02:27.360 --> 2:02:30.880]  I'm not talking about a one-page PDF book, folks.
[2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:37.680]  I'm talking about a 20-page document where they're showing you the styles of your shield.
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:40.280]  They're showing guys dressed up in armor.
[2:02:40.280 --> 2:02:47.040]  They're telling you to put on a football helmet or a hockey mask to go after cameras if people
[2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:48.040]  are taping.
[2:02:48.040 --> 2:02:49.040]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:50.800]  That's not how it's done.
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:52.600]  The camera is our friend.
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:55.320]  It is our ally in the Info War.
[2:02:55.320 --> 2:02:58.680]  It shows what's really going on.
[2:02:58.680 --> 2:03:04.640]  These tactics are the same tactics they used in Seattle at the WTO.
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:11.480]  We know, we now know that was a government up to squelch dissent, to bring in provocateurs,
[2:03:11.480 --> 2:03:15.960]  to hold them up, and to take away our free speech, and I'm not going to have it.
[2:03:15.960 --> 2:03:20.680]  They know now that we're hip to their tricks, that it's not about Democrat or Republican.
[2:03:20.680 --> 2:03:23.080]  It's about both, and they're both criminal.
[2:03:23.080 --> 2:03:27.680]  You really think Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama are going to save us?
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:28.960]  They're disgusting people, folks.
[2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:30.440]  They're not here for you and me.
[2:03:30.440 --> 2:03:34.240]  They're here for the special interests, and they're selling us our first woman president
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:37.200]  ever, or our first African-American president ever.
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:40.000]  They're showing how progressive we've come.
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:41.000]  And I'm all for it.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:44.480]  Listen, you bring the right woman up to be a president of the United States, I'm in.
[2:03:44.480 --> 2:03:48.000]  You bring the right African-American up to be the president of the United States, and
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  I'm in.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  I'll vote for him.
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:51.000]  I'll bring him on.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  I'll campaign for him.
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:55.840]  But these are not the people we want running the country, are they, Jonathan?
[2:03:55.840 --> 2:03:57.400]  Far from it.
[2:03:57.400 --> 2:03:58.400]  Far from it.
[2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:03.480]  The same with the information war has grown so much in this past year.
[2:04:03.480 --> 2:04:06.680]  The whole We Are Changed movement came about.
[2:04:06.680 --> 2:04:09.400]  Ron Paul announced his candidacy for president.
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:11.080]  His entire movement came about.
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:14.960]  Of course, many celebrities that came out this past year.
[2:04:14.960 --> 2:04:22.840]  So it's been a wild and crazy year for 9-11, and it's just been an adventure to be a part
[2:04:22.840 --> 2:04:27.800]  of this whole process and see the wake-up that's been going on.
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:29.960]  TruthAlliance.net is Jonathan's site.
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:32.400]  We Are Changed Colorado is the organization.
[2:04:32.400 --> 2:04:35.440]  We're going to be back with a full hour, and we're going to be taking your calls as well
[2:04:35.440 --> 2:04:36.960]  over at the Alex Jones Show.
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:37.960]  Thanks for tuning in.
[2:04:37.960 --> 2:04:38.960]  I am Jason Bermas.
[2:04:38.960 --> 2:04:40.680]  We'll be back after this.
[2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:49.320]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.

[2:06:52.160 --> 2:06:53.920]  world health is staggering.
[2:06:53.920 --> 2:06:58.240]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[2:06:58.240 --> 2:07:02.640]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[2:07:02.640 --> 2:07:05.920]  in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.

[2:08:27.280 --> 2:08:32.280]  That's why we have a command center out in Austin, Texas, headed up by a true patriot
[2:08:32.280 --> 2:08:36.320]  known as Alex Jones, and Alex is carrying a new video over here.
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:42.960]  Again, it's by William Lewis who edited Ripple Effect and 9-11 In Plain Site, a very talented
[2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:43.960]  guy.
[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:46.520]  It's called Washington You're Fired, and some of the other questions he asked in this
[2:08:46.520 --> 2:08:48.760]  video is, are you a terrorist?
[2:08:48.760 --> 2:08:53.880]  Because according to the new definition for homegrown terrorists, you just might be.
[2:08:53.880 --> 2:08:58.240]  And if you saw that Simon Wiesenthal presentation about two or three months ago, you better
[2:08:58.240 --> 2:08:59.240]  believe it.
[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:03.720]  I mean, they're showing Alcada snuff films, literally people getting shot in the face,
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:08.120]  okay, about to be beheaded as well, and then they slip in a little bit, architects and
[2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:13.280]  engineers for 9-11 Truth, and say conspiracy theory is breed on the internet, and imply
[2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:15.120]  that we're with the terrorists.
[2:09:15.120 --> 2:09:20.400]  No folks, I'm with the Constitution, I'm with the Bill of Rights, I'm with freedom, I'm
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:24.160]  with this country, man, I'm with the United States of America, and we need to take it
[2:09:24.160 --> 2:09:25.160]  back.
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:27.320]  Where are the checks and balances?
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:30.160]  Where is the government for and by the people?
[2:09:30.160 --> 2:09:34.960]  Well, we've got to step up and ensure that we continue to move forward.
[2:09:34.960 --> 2:09:41.080]  And Jonathan Elanoff is one of those people that, I mean, constantly, constantly, is getting
[2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:46.680]  people on video, is doing new projects, is pushing forward for the patriot movement.
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:48.760]  And you know, what's your latest and greatest, Jonathan?
[2:09:48.760 --> 2:09:51.240]  What are you working on over at Truth Alliance right now?
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:55.840]  Well, first of all, I want to credit Jason and Micah.
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:58.080]  They run the site, they do a great job.
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:02.160]  We all find articles, and then I write for the site.
[2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:03.960]  So it's kind of a collective effort.
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:09.600]  And I want to also give the rest of the We Are Changed Colorado chapter their credit
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:10.600]  as well.
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:17.800]  You know, there's other members, Josh, Rob, of course, Jason, Adam, all those guys, Shannon,
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:20.400]  just terrific members.
[2:10:20.400 --> 2:10:25.280]  And had I not have met them this past year, I don't know if I would have built up the
[2:10:25.280 --> 2:10:29.480]  courage to fight this info war, and they've all just done a great job.
[2:10:29.480 --> 2:10:37.280]  And, you know, this year, we've been working on a core corruption film, which is a 9-11
[2:10:37.280 --> 2:10:43.160]  film, based on my research and the collective research of many people I've met with, including
[2:10:43.160 --> 2:10:44.880]  you, of course.
[2:10:44.880 --> 2:10:46.760]  And I hope to get that out this year.
[2:10:46.760 --> 2:10:51.320]  And then I just took another project with the Western Clean Energy Campaign to do a
[2:10:51.320 --> 2:10:56.640]  film on big coal and the coal industry and how it is integrated into the Department of
[2:10:56.640 --> 2:10:58.240]  Defense and Department of Energy.
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:03.040]  And so it's been an interesting year working on film projects and, of course, exposing
[2:11:03.040 --> 2:11:08.320]  some of the criminal elements inside of our political system now and facing them, of course,
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:14.040]  in person and having it off in debates and how many times getting thrown out.
[2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:18.520]  Yeah, well, you know, that happens when you speak truth to power.
[2:11:18.520 --> 2:11:19.800]  And that's what we continue to do.
[2:11:19.800 --> 2:11:21.480]  I mean, you've confronted Mitt Romney.
[2:11:21.480 --> 2:11:23.640]  People can check that out over at YouTube.
[2:11:23.640 --> 2:11:27.560]  And I just want to sidetrack for just one second and tell people that they can go check
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:30.080]  out an actual Patriot running for Senate.
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:32.760]  It's a friend of Ron Paul for over 28 years.
[2:11:32.760 --> 2:11:36.160]  You can check it out at MurrayandRon.com.
[2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:39.960]  There is going to be a rally on April 28th in New York City.
[2:11:39.960 --> 2:11:42.320]  And Murray Sabrin is the candidate.
[2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:45.320]  And I think they're giving away two free trips over there, so go check it out.
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:50.540]  We need more people with that Ron Paul mentality, with that constitutional republic, with the
[2:11:50.540 --> 2:11:53.240]  separation of state powers.
[2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:54.240]  So we can do these things.
[2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:58.280]  I mean, I was pretty shocked when I went into Colorado, Jonathan.
[2:11:58.280 --> 2:11:59.880]  You know, people had handguns everywhere.
[2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:02.800]  It's just not like that in New York, you know, where I'm from.
[2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:07.680]  If you want to have a carry or a conceal permit or a carry and conceal permit for a handgun,
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:09.520]  I mean, you have to jump through loops.
[2:12:09.520 --> 2:12:15.040]  You most likely have to be a police officer or in the military or an ex-military in order
[2:12:15.040 --> 2:12:16.040]  to do so.
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:17.040]  We really don't have that right.
[2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:21.720]  I mean, you can have a.22 or a shotgun in your house, sure, but you can't carry around
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:22.720]  a pistol.
[2:12:22.720 --> 2:12:27.720]  And it is just, you know, it's much more free in Colorado, I guess you could say.
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:29.440]  I mean, people are carrying weapons.
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:30.440]  People know their rights.
[2:12:30.440 --> 2:12:33.240]  And it's not like, you know, people are running around murdering people.
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:36.920]  It seemed like a much safer place than New York, Jonathan.
[2:12:36.920 --> 2:12:39.960]  Oh, yeah, our crime rate is very low.
[2:12:39.960 --> 2:12:43.360]  You know, it's generally an outdoor state because of our mountains.
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:48.680]  And, you know, a lot of people, I remember I had a cousin out in Jersey and, you know,
[2:12:48.680 --> 2:12:51.040]  he said, do you hunt for your dinner when we were kids?
[2:12:51.040 --> 2:12:55.920]  And I was like, no, man, it's not like you're a typical cow town, you know, we're a pretty
[2:12:55.920 --> 2:13:00.640]  relatively large city Colorado has, I think over 5 million people in it and most of them
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:02.960]  are centralized in Denver.
[2:13:02.960 --> 2:13:09.200]  And the city itself is very lenient, you know, they're very, very respectful towards medical
[2:13:09.200 --> 2:13:10.200]  marijuana.
[2:13:10.200 --> 2:13:15.600]  I remember one of the first states to pass that Denver and Boulder have decriminalized
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:16.600]  marijuana.
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:22.600]  Of course, they respect the right to possess and carry weapons and definitely an interesting
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:27.720]  state where you see a cross between many different laws and a lot of activists in Colorado.
[2:13:27.720 --> 2:13:32.520]  A lot of outdoors people, people that don't like to work indoors or, you know, in office
[2:13:32.520 --> 2:13:33.520]  jobs.
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:36.400]  So you get a lot of people that like to bike ride, go camping, go up to the mountains and
[2:13:36.400 --> 2:13:39.320]  enjoy themselves skiing and snowboarding.
[2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:43.920]  So our community is generally a bunch of people pretty laid back, as I said before, and you
[2:13:43.920 --> 2:13:49.600]  know, it's a cool town, I wish more people would come out and visit us, but you know,
[2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:53.880]  we know what's going on, we're waking up to the info ward, hopefully we can contribute
[2:13:53.880 --> 2:13:55.480]  our part in this whole battle.
[2:13:55.480 --> 2:14:00.440]  It was a truly beautiful piece of land I was at and I got to tell you folks, I was shocked
[2:14:00.440 --> 2:14:04.920]  to get there and have it be about 20 degrees warmer than it was in New York while I was
[2:14:04.920 --> 2:14:06.080]  out there in February.
[2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:10.920]  I went there thinking, oh, I need a winter hat, like 75 degrees and sunny in Denver and
[2:14:10.920 --> 2:14:11.920]  Boulder, guys.
[2:14:11.920 --> 2:14:15.760]  I mean, it's not until you get up to the upper altitudes that you have that snow and that
[2:14:15.760 --> 2:14:18.920]  powder on the mountains, because it is the Rockies.
[2:14:18.920 --> 2:14:22.840]  And I was just shocked, man, it was a really cool place and I hope to be out there sometime
[2:14:22.840 --> 2:14:28.480]  this summer as well, especially for the DNC, which I'm stoked for.
[2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:34.640]  And I want to talk a little bit more about the DNC and really get your take on this
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:39.360]  organization that did get a permit and their tactics, man, because if you look at that
[2:14:39.360 --> 2:14:43.880]  shield book, it screams provocateur, screams it.
[2:14:43.880 --> 2:14:47.200]  Oh yeah, to say the least.
[2:14:47.200 --> 2:14:51.520]  And you know, the articles that I've been writing, I just posted another one that people
[2:14:51.520 --> 2:15:00.240]  want further information on it, but the reality is that the DNC is going to be hundreds of
[2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:04.960]  activist groups going to be showing up and working together and separately at the same
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:05.960]  time.
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:10.120]  It's going to be a very interesting scene down there, because Denver spent $50 million
[2:15:10.120 --> 2:15:15.880]  on security forces and they haven't announced any of their security procedures, any of their
[2:15:15.880 --> 2:15:20.800]  security zones, the free speech zones, but they've announced all the laws, which are
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:26.160]  very interesting, like curfews and things like that.
[2:15:26.160 --> 2:15:30.280]  And you know, when I posted that article of some of the observations that I've been making
[2:15:30.280 --> 2:15:35.760]  and some of the activist groups planning for protests down there, I received a lot of praise
[2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:40.560]  and I also got attacked personally, which a lot of people want to know where we get
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:41.560]  our sources.
[2:15:41.560 --> 2:15:45.400]  If you go to Truthland.net, you can see where I base my argument.
[2:15:45.400 --> 2:15:46.840]  It's just an observation.
[2:15:46.840 --> 2:15:53.800]  I'm not making accusations, and there are no hard feelings on my end, but I'm concerned.
[2:15:53.800 --> 2:15:59.400]  This is something that the police state uses to make us look bad, to install martial law,
[2:15:59.400 --> 2:16:06.960]  to enforce strict responses, and then they can get their way if people act out of line
[2:16:06.960 --> 2:16:08.480]  or criminal.
[2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:09.920]  And yeah, there are groups out there.
[2:16:09.920 --> 2:16:11.440]  I named some of them.
[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:14.880]  I've been able to observe some on Truthland.net.
[2:16:14.880 --> 2:16:16.600]  You can see that.
[2:16:16.600 --> 2:16:19.160]  And yeah, they're calling for destruction of property.
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:23.680]  They're calling for organized efforts to directly confront police.
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:28.480]  They're calling for all kinds of things that are going to result in, especially with the
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:33.560]  numbers that I've been hearing, tens of thousands of people going to be coordinating these things.
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:41.440]  You're talking about a potential safety risk for people who are wanting to demonstrate peacefully.
[2:16:41.440 --> 2:16:46.880]  So we might see some potential for violence, and I've been to some meetings and recorded
[2:16:46.880 --> 2:16:52.160]  them and all those audio clips are available on Truthland.net as well.
[2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:55.920]  And you can see for yourself, folks, I mean, you know, people are saying that they're going
[2:16:55.920 --> 2:16:56.920]  to get violent.
[2:16:56.920 --> 2:16:57.920]  I've got the quotes.
[2:16:57.920 --> 2:16:58.920]  I've got the confirmation.
[2:16:58.920 --> 2:16:59.920]  I've got the audio clips.
[2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:01.560]  I've got the documents.
[2:17:01.560 --> 2:17:03.160]  People are manifesting this.
[2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:07.680]  You know, I didn't want to be the bearer of the bad news, but hey, look, I'm just a messenger.
[2:17:07.680 --> 2:17:10.080]  I'm observing something going on here.
[2:17:10.080 --> 2:17:13.400]  It looks like two trains headed for each other on the same track, and they're going to collide
[2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:17.800]  if I don't stop it, or at least if we don't begin this process of talking about it so
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:22.760]  that worst case scenario, let's say it does happen, which it looks like it's going to,
[2:17:22.760 --> 2:17:25.280]  you know, we can come out and say, hey, look, we tried to prevent this.
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:26.280]  We tried to stop it.
[2:17:26.280 --> 2:17:28.080]  We tried to educate you on this.
[2:17:28.080 --> 2:17:31.080]  This needs to stop, and that's what we have to do.
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:32.880]  We have to go about things peacefully.
[2:17:32.880 --> 2:17:36.680]  We have to go about civil disobedience in a certain manner, and whenever you see people
[2:17:36.680 --> 2:17:41.880]  trying to go against those principles or those standards, that's when you have to ask yourself,
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:43.600]  okay, what are they doing?
[2:17:43.600 --> 2:17:48.240]  We've never had a coordinated effort this large, and we've acted peaceful about it.
[2:17:48.240 --> 2:17:50.000]  So why are we acting this way?
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.760]  And a lot of people look at the civil rights movement, and they say, oh, well, that was
[2:17:52.760 --> 2:17:53.760]  violent.
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:54.760]  I go, no, no.
[2:17:54.760 --> 2:17:59.560]  The success of the civil rights movement came from Martin Luther King, primarily, every
[2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:00.560]  historian agrees.
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:07.120]  And he was nonviolent, and I mean, the ways that Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. achieve
[2:18:07.120 --> 2:18:12.520]  changed was peaceful, nonviolent resistance, and that's what we need to continue to do.
[2:18:12.520 --> 2:18:16.360]  And the media is going to continue to lie and say we're not using that method, hence
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:21.640]  this story right here, and we need an article up at infowars.com as soon as possible, because
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:26.640]  this has to do with we are change out in New York, and the New York Post is actually reporting
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:32.560]  that Gary, who was detained the other day for confronting the Bush women, punched a girl
[2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:33.560]  in the...
[2:18:33.560 --> 2:18:34.560]  Listen to this one.
[2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:38.560]  He said the authorities are saying that he was arrested after he punched a wheelchair-bound
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:41.960]  girl whose parents had told him to shut up authority, said yesterday.
[2:18:41.960 --> 2:18:44.120]  The girl's 18 and has cerebral palsy.
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:50.840]  I can promise you that Gary did not punch any girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy.
[2:18:50.840 --> 2:18:52.120]  Show me the video.
[2:18:52.120 --> 2:18:58.400]  Show me the video of this man punching a girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy, but they'll
[2:18:58.400 --> 2:18:59.840]  charge him with it.
[2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:03.960]  It's just like when, you know, in the UK, they confront an official.
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:06.720]  He trips and falls, and all of a sudden he's attacked.
[2:19:06.720 --> 2:19:07.840]  It makes me sick.
[2:19:07.840 --> 2:19:08.840]  It makes me ill.
[2:19:08.840 --> 2:19:10.760]  They're painting us out to be demons.
[2:19:10.760 --> 2:19:11.760]  We need to pay attention.
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:15.720]  He needs to sue them, okay, for libel for this.
[2:19:15.720 --> 2:19:20.040]  They really need to bring a lawsuit, punch a girl in a wheelchair, and scream in obscenities.
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:21.240]  It's disgusting, Jonathan.
[2:19:21.240 --> 2:19:23.280]  I'm not going to stand for it.
[2:19:23.280 --> 2:19:24.280]  We are Change Colorado.
[2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:26.840]  We're going to stick it out with us for the entire hour.
[2:19:26.840 --> 2:19:31.960]  TruthAlliance.net is the website, infowars.com, prismplanet.tv, if you want to check me out
[2:19:31.960 --> 2:19:35.080]  in the fourth hour on the video, and we're going to come back, and we're going to take
[2:19:35.080 --> 2:19:39.560]  calls from Ian Stewart, Randy, and Brian in the next hour.
[2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:47.720]  I'm Jason Bermas, and for Alex Jones, we'll be back after these messages.
[2:19:47.720 --> 2:19:51.960]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:19:51.960 --> 2:19:56.600]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:19:56.600 --> 2:19:59.080]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:02.520]  Is that their objective being world domination?
[2:20:02.520 --> 2:20:05.680]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:20:05.680 --> 2:20:10.680]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[2:20:10.680 --> 2:20:14.040]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:21.480]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:20:21.480 --> 2:20:25.360]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:28.040]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:20:28.040 --> 2:20:29.040]  Most people have no idea.
[2:20:29.040 --> 2:20:30.040]  They're not after money.
[2:20:30.040 --> 2:20:31.040]  They have all the money they need.
[2:20:31.040 --> 2:20:32.040]  They're after power.
[2:20:32.040 --> 2:20:33.400]  That's their affidavit.
[2:20:33.400 --> 2:20:39.240]  They're in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, or watch it online right
[2:20:39.240 --> 2:20:44.800]  now at prisonplanet.tv, in-game, blueprint for global enslaved.
[2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:46.880]  You have been warned.
[2:20:46.880 --> 2:20:48.440]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[2:20:48.440 --> 2:20:52.160]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[2:20:52.160 --> 2:20:56.440]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one
[2:20:56.440 --> 2:20:58.160]  huge political voting block.
[2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:02.200]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[2:21:02.200 --> 2:21:06.000]  Their forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty
[2:21:06.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  of conscience.
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:10.640]  History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems, church and state, must be
[2:21:10.640 --> 2:21:11.640]  kept separate.
[2:21:11.640 --> 2:21:15.760]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:18.320]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[2:21:18.320 --> 2:21:22.800]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as papal Rome, religious intolerance
[2:21:22.800 --> 2:21:23.800]  resulted.
[2:21:23.800 --> 2:21:27.520]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[2:21:27.520 --> 2:21:30.280]  America and papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[2:21:30.280 --> 2:21:32.720]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[2:21:32.720 --> 2:21:34.560]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:36.320]  Jesus is coming soon.

[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:49.200]  Terror Storm, a history of government sponsored terror.
[2:21:49.200 --> 2:21:50.720]  Loose change, final cut.
[2:21:50.720 --> 2:21:52.840]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement.
[2:21:52.840 --> 2:21:58.080]  The true story of the Bilderberg group, the late great USA, America, freedom to fascism.

[2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:49.880]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[2:22:49.880 --> 2:22:53.360]  For over five years Cardivite has proven itself time tested.
[2:22:53.360 --> 2:22:57.200]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[2:22:57.200 --> 2:23:00.360]  In our mind there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[2:23:00.360 --> 2:23:05.040]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the
[2:23:05.040 --> 2:23:06.040]  disease that we see.
[2:23:06.040 --> 2:23:09.560]  When we do our program you know in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone
[2:23:09.560 --> 2:23:14.400]  who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular job a few months later we know
[2:23:14.400 --> 2:23:15.400]  we're doing something right.
[2:23:15.400 --> 2:23:16.880]  It's a well thought out formula.
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:21.840]  I mean the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function
[2:23:21.840 --> 2:23:22.840]  is dead on.
[2:23:22.840 --> 2:23:27.160]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation
[2:23:27.160 --> 2:23:28.160]  problems.
[2:23:28.160 --> 2:23:29.160]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[2:23:29.160 --> 2:23:39.560]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:24:09.280]  That's all for number again 1-877-928-8822.
[2:24:43.280 --> 2:24:44.920]  Against the wind folks and we're fighting.
[2:24:44.920 --> 2:24:50.360]  We're fighting against the wind of the new world order of this globalist agenda of the
[2:24:50.360 --> 2:24:51.360]  mainstream media.
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:52.360]  Let me read that.
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:56.720]  Let me read more before I go back to Jonathan and we are changed because this does affect
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:24:57.720]  all of us.
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:25:00.840]  This is how the media spins and lies.
[2:25:00.840 --> 2:25:06.360]  This guy, John and Wendy Loftor, the parents of this girl, you know I don't know anything
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:12.200]  about them but I do know that there's no way this kid was hitting their daughter.
[2:25:12.200 --> 2:25:14.080]  And this is what their quotes are in the paper.
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:19.000]  I heard my daughter hysterically yelling he's hitting me said Wendy.
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:22.600]  He punched her on the shoulder blades but that wasn't enough.
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:28.320]  She said, come on, listen some of this video is actually posted.
[2:25:28.320 --> 2:25:36.160]  If you think that the guy who the Secret Service is talking to Gary did this, there's no way.
[2:25:36.160 --> 2:25:37.160]  There's no way.
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:41.800]  My husband pushed the wheelchair away from him and he reached beyond my husband and began
[2:25:41.800 --> 2:25:45.600]  pounding my daughter in the thigh.
[2:25:45.600 --> 2:25:46.600]  Come on.
[2:25:46.600 --> 2:25:51.240]  The two men fought as the president's family drove off, cops broke them up and busted Talis
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:54.480]  on charges of assault and resisting arrest.
[2:25:54.480 --> 2:25:55.480]  Ridiculous.
[2:25:55.480 --> 2:25:58.760]  I promise you Gary didn't punch this woman.
[2:25:58.760 --> 2:26:01.600]  I'm sick to my stomach right now.
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:06.960]  I mean Jonathan, would you speak to how the media just spins these things out of control?
[2:26:06.960 --> 2:26:10.240]  I mean there's going to be video that surfaces and it's going to clearly show that he didn't
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:11.520]  punch this girl.
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:15.200]  And do you think the New York Times is going to retract this story?
[2:26:15.200 --> 2:26:16.200]  I hope so.
[2:26:16.200 --> 2:26:21.560]  You know, it's clearly, you know, I saw when that was posted on the Weird Change site and
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:27.080]  also when it was first updated and it looked as though the story was that the people had
[2:26:27.080 --> 2:26:33.960]  been told, if I'm not mistaken, to move her closer to Gary so it could appear that way.
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:39.000]  Gary was just trying to get in but I wasn't present so I don't know what actually occurred.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:42.760]  But I do know that, you know, Weird Change is a peaceful group.
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:48.040]  This doesn't sound like anything Weird Change would do, believes in, doesn't reflect anything
[2:26:48.040 --> 2:26:49.840]  that the group would do.
[2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:52.800]  But the mainstream media is trying to paint them as the New Weathermen.
[2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:59.440]  Well, you know, the mainstream media has a long history of this ridiculous framing, character
[2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:00.800]  framing that they tend to do.
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:03.600]  I mean we saw this with Charlie Sheen when he went public.
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:08.240]  We saw it with Rosie O'Donnell when she went public about 9-11.
[2:27:08.240 --> 2:27:14.680]  They use these character assassinations against us to make us look crazy or not credible or
[2:27:14.680 --> 2:27:18.560]  violent or whatever method they're trying to do.
[2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:22.760]  And for the people who aren't woken up, it can work sometimes.
[2:27:22.760 --> 2:27:27.520]  But for the most of the people in this country that are waking up, if not all of them, it
[2:27:27.520 --> 2:27:28.520]  doesn't work anymore.
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:30.760]  These kinds of tactics are silly.
[2:27:30.760 --> 2:27:34.640]  I don't know why they keep resorting to these ridiculous methods.
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:38.160]  What they have to realize is this is backfiring on them at full fold.
[2:27:38.160 --> 2:27:43.720]  I mean every time they do this, our movement grows hundreds of people because people aren't
[2:27:43.720 --> 2:27:44.720]  stupid.
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:45.960]  We know what's going on.
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:50.280]  We know what they're trying to do, and these are old tactics that maybe worked hundreds
[2:27:50.280 --> 2:27:55.680]  of years ago, but they're not going to work in an age of internet, in an age of reason,
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:28:00.440]  in an age of educated, intelligent information sharing, which is what we're going through
[2:28:00.440 --> 2:28:01.440]  today.
[2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:02.440]  So, you know.
[2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:06.400]  Which is why it's so important for them to try to control the internet and bring in internet
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:07.600]  too.
[2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:08.920]  And it's very scary stuff.
[2:28:08.920 --> 2:28:10.320]  I pray to God that that doesn't happen.
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:14.560]  I pray to God that most people wake up before they want you to scan your thumbprint.
[2:28:14.560 --> 2:28:17.280]  They're already testing it out with these new IBM ThinkPad.
[2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:19.000]  See how many people buy this for security?
[2:28:19.000 --> 2:28:20.240]  Oh, look.
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:23.160]  I have a biometric thumb scanner on my computer.
[2:28:23.160 --> 2:28:24.560]  Only I can access it.
[2:28:24.560 --> 2:28:28.680]  Well soon they'll be on all keyboards, and you can only access any computer through that.
[2:28:28.680 --> 2:28:31.280]  And you're going to hook in through internet too with your user ID.
[2:28:31.280 --> 2:28:35.200]  And everything you do, which hasn't already been tracked or traced because, you know,
[2:28:35.200 --> 2:28:39.000]  we've got whistleblowers that have gone public and said, you know, AT&T amongst others are
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:42.640]  giving everything to a quote unquote, secret room.
[2:28:42.640 --> 2:28:43.640]  Everything's being recorded.
[2:28:43.640 --> 2:28:44.640]  It's really unfortunate.
[2:28:44.640 --> 2:28:46.000]  Mainstream news, folks.
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:48.240]  Keith Olderman had the guy on for 10 minutes.
[2:28:48.240 --> 2:28:51.880]  Thing was thrown out of federal court, and now he's just trying to get, you know, get
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:56.720]  it into a lawsuit so that this subject matter can even be brought to the American people.
[2:28:56.720 --> 2:29:02.160]  Why is it on one show for eight minutes, one time, and no one else is talking about it?
[2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:03.160]  Why?
[2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:04.760]  Oh, I'll tell you why.
[2:29:04.760 --> 2:29:06.600]  It's because they're trying to control us.
[2:29:06.600 --> 2:29:07.600]  They're trying.
[2:29:07.600 --> 2:29:10.320]  They're incrementally taking everything away.
[2:29:10.320 --> 2:29:14.760]  Jonathan's with me for the remainder of the hour, and then right at the top of the next
[2:29:14.760 --> 2:29:17.840]  segment, we're going to start going to the calls beginning with Ian in New York.
[2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:21.000]  By the way, Mike, I know you dropped out to take another call.
[2:29:21.000 --> 2:29:24.720]  We may go back to you in the fourth hour with Student Scholars for 9-Eleven Truth.
[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:38.000]  It's the Alex Jones show, and we'll be right back.
[2:29:38.000 --> 2:29:39.280]  We're on the march.
[2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:41.680]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:41.680 --> 2:29:48.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:48.120 --> 2:29:50.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:54.560]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected
[2:29:54.560 --> 2:29:57.000]  by you, but the symptoms are there.
[2:29:57.000 --> 2:30:01.760]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[2:30:01.760 --> 2:30:05.440]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:30:05.440 --> 2:30:10.000]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:11.200]  across America.
[2:30:11.200 --> 2:30:14.880]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:30:14.880 --> 2:30:18.640]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:19.640]  healthier I feel.
[2:30:19.640 --> 2:30:22.320]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:27.520]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:30:27.520 --> 2:30:30.040]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:30:47.560 --> 2:30:52.720]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[2:30:52.720 --> 2:30:57.600]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling, because fruits and vegetables
[2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:01.760]  in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than have heated.
[2:31:01.760 --> 2:31:06.200]  The champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients or body craves.
[2:31:06.200 --> 2:31:10.680]  The champion juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:14.720]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[2:31:14.720 --> 2:31:20.080]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness,
[2:31:20.080 --> 2:31:25.000]  but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:29.880]  Working with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:32.720]  Put the champion juicer to work for you and your family.

[2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:51.520]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced
[2:31:51.520 --> 2:31:52.520]  alkaline environment.
[2:31:52.520 --> 2:31:58.240]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[2:31:58.240 --> 2:32:02.680]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention
[2:32:02.680 --> 2:32:03.880]  of disease.
[2:32:03.880 --> 2:32:08.520]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and
[2:32:08.520 --> 2:32:09.520]  loss of weight.
[2:32:09.520 --> 2:32:12.600]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[2:32:12.600 --> 2:32:15.800]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[2:32:15.800 --> 2:32:19.720]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[2:32:19.720 --> 2:32:24.000]  That accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize
[2:32:24.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  it.
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:28.560]  Do your part, alkalize, and supercharge your body now.
[2:32:28.560 --> 2:32:33.240]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH
[2:32:33.240 --> 2:32:37.160]  of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.

[2:33:43.640 --> 2:33:51.520]  We are back, baby, defending the republic in disgust with the mainstream media, where
[2:33:51.520 --> 2:33:57.200]  they report that 9-11 truth is that we are changed, are literally attacking girls with
[2:33:57.200 --> 2:34:01.080]  cerebral palsy in wheelchairs.
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:02.800]  That's the kind of slander.
[2:34:02.800 --> 2:34:08.800]  That's the kind of disinfo they put out to shape, to form public opinion.
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:12.160]  We got a real patriot with us, at least for the next 30 minutes.
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:17.160]  Here's Jonathan Ellen off of We Are Changed, and I want to remind everybody this is a multi-tiered
[2:34:17.160 --> 2:34:22.640]  attack, and one of those attacks they use is this quote-unquote war on drugs, and that's
[2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:28.040]  why it's so important to get a copy of American Drug War, The Last White Hope, Kevin Booth's
[2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:29.600]  new film, awesome movie.
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:34.120]  I haven't checked out the three hours of bonus features, but I'm going to after reading this.
[2:34:34.120 --> 2:34:35.200]  Let me just give you a hint.
[2:34:35.200 --> 2:34:37.320]  This is a dual-layer DVD9.
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:41.240]  You're talking about five plus hours of stuff on this DVD.
[2:34:41.240 --> 2:34:46.320]  He's got mini docs, free Tommy Chong, it's 60 minutes long, it's a film starring Tommy
[2:34:46.320 --> 2:34:51.400]  Chong and his family chronicling the arrest and his prison sentence.
[2:34:51.400 --> 2:34:54.920]  He's got Freeway Ricky Ross, Drug War Economics.
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:35:01.160]  He's also got Alex Jones in there and fun with Barry the czar, that's Barry McCafferty,
[2:35:01.160 --> 2:35:02.160]  ex-drug czar.
[2:35:02.160 --> 2:35:09.200]  He's got a little short with Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Robert Steele, a CIA officer, among others.
[2:35:09.200 --> 2:35:12.480]  I think there's five other extras I didn't even get to mention right there.
[2:35:12.480 --> 2:35:20.280]  You can get this only at prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[2:35:20.280 --> 2:35:23.120]  I think it's something like 2495.
[2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:28.440]  Get a copy, hold a screening in your local church, get this information out.
[2:35:28.440 --> 2:35:32.960]  This thing's on showtime, so more and more people are watching it, but it needs to become
[2:35:32.960 --> 2:35:38.960]  more mainline because it's a very impressive DVD and hats off to Kevin Booth and the gang.
[2:35:38.960 --> 2:35:45.680]  We're with Jonathan Elanoff of We Are Changed Colorado, truthalliance.net, and are you going
[2:35:45.680 --> 2:35:47.200]  to be doing a story about this, Jonathan?
[2:35:47.200 --> 2:35:52.840]  I think this whole attack, really, deserves some stories all around.
[2:35:52.840 --> 2:35:58.120]  Yeah, we're covering that kind of stuff on the site.
[2:35:58.120 --> 2:36:03.680]  I'm actually talking with Jason right now through IM, and we're able to start getting
[2:36:03.680 --> 2:36:05.320]  some other articles up.
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:10.040]  I did want to mention truthalliance is a community, network community, where we ask for participation
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:11.040]  from people.
[2:36:11.040 --> 2:36:13.680]  If you can go there, sign up, help us out.
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:19.040]  If you see an article that you think should be mentioned, send it over to us, or as always
[2:36:19.040 --> 2:36:22.760]  Alex Jones' site, infowars.
[2:36:22.760 --> 2:36:27.840]  We try to be in information service, and so it's more of a community working together.
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:28.840]  We all network on there.
[2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:33.880]  We all chat on there, and we're able to get a lot done working together.
[2:36:33.880 --> 2:36:40.320]  I know truthalliance is working on offering any We Are Changed sites to be built to anyone
[2:36:40.320 --> 2:36:42.280]  who would like to start a We Are Changed chapter.
[2:36:42.280 --> 2:36:47.240]  If you go to truthalliance.net and talk to email us there, we'll set you up with a free
[2:36:47.240 --> 2:36:54.000]  WordPress site, get you going, and then give you some rundowns on how to start a chapter.
[2:36:54.000 --> 2:36:57.600]  Hopefully people can start their own We Are Changed chapters locally in their area, get
[2:36:57.600 --> 2:36:59.680]  some people to go out and start confronting politicians.
[2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:05.640]  Look, folks, these guys should not be able to go anywhere without being confronted.
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:11.240]  They should be able to get off a plane, be confronted, do their spiel, go back on a plane,
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:14.560]  fly somewhere else, get off a plane, and be confronted again, to the point that they're
[2:37:14.560 --> 2:37:21.800]  so saturated with confrontations that they realize, okay, the people know this stuff.
[2:37:21.800 --> 2:37:25.720]  I can't continue to play it off like they don't know, and that's the way we're going
[2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:28.880]  to win this war of the many different methods.
[2:37:28.880 --> 2:37:33.360]  That's definitely a good start, so we need as many chapters to get out there, go talk
[2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:38.680]  to politicians, talk to local representatives, media moguls, anybody you can, and try to
[2:37:38.680 --> 2:37:40.680]  get this information out there.
[2:37:40.680 --> 2:37:45.120]  I know a lot of people that mass produce DVDs and hand them out on the streets to try to
[2:37:45.120 --> 2:37:46.120]  educate people.
[2:37:46.120 --> 2:37:50.560]  A little information packet, I know 9-11 Truth has a lot of this kind of material available,
[2:37:50.560 --> 2:37:56.280]  I'm sure a lot of the We Are Changed chapters have this information available, so join in
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:02.520]  for war if you can't, people out there that aren't in it, hop along, for me it's exhilarating
[2:38:02.520 --> 2:38:04.040]  to have an adrenaline rush.
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:08.320]  And I'm putting out the call to the listeners for someone to please go to our Wikipedia
[2:38:08.320 --> 2:38:11.120]  page and do loose change Final Cut.
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:14.440]  Second edition has been done to death over there, someone really needs to lay out the
[2:38:14.440 --> 2:38:19.640]  evidence presented in the Final Cut because this is a brand new movie, and people need
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:23.800]  to know when they Google loose change, it's the second thing that comes up other than
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:27.120]  the videos, is the Wikipedia page.
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:30.960]  They need to know that this is a substantially different movie, that the evidence presented
[2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:36.600]  is irrefutable, and that it is a different taste of 9-11 Truth from the second edition,
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:39.720]  so get out there, somebody, anybody, please, somebody do a good job.
[2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:44.320]  All right, let's take some calls here, Jonathan, we're going to go right through the list,
[2:38:44.320 --> 2:38:47.480]  let's go to Ian in New York, Ian are you with us?
[2:38:47.480 --> 2:38:54.840]  Hello, thanks for taking my call, you know, I agree with what you're saying, but you know
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:59.720]  I think people are becoming too passive, and you know, they're going to make up stories
[2:38:59.720 --> 2:39:04.280]  about us hitting people and stuff like that, you know, what are we going to wait until
[2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:09.000]  they come to our doors, put us in the bus, take us to the death camp, we got to start,
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:14.640]  you know, at least some, I'm not suggesting vandalized, but we got to start putting our
[2:39:14.640 --> 2:39:21.640]  mark out there even more, you know, and people are so passive and they watch TV and worried
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:27.840]  about sports all the time, it's getting pretty pathetic, and I've been researching this stuff
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:34.800]  since about 2002, and pretty much how I feel nowadays is if people aren't going to do anything
[2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:40.440]  they deserve exactly what they get, because it's getting so pathetic, and that's how
[2:39:40.440 --> 2:39:41.440]  I feel.
[2:39:41.440 --> 2:39:45.400]  Well, I mean, you know, I can't really disagree with you, I think that there's a lot of ways
[2:39:45.400 --> 2:39:50.480]  to bring the guerrilla information war out there, one of those ways is to plaster bumper
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:56.200]  stickers around your local city or town, even graffiti, you know, I saw some of that over
[2:39:56.200 --> 2:40:01.920]  in the UK with 9-11 Truth, and I'm all for, you know, nonviolent forms of protest, now
[2:40:01.920 --> 2:40:06.200]  on the other hand, you know, I don't think that we should be waiting for them to come
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:10.720]  and get us, I think that if you're an informed individual, you need to get a gun permit,
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:13.760]  you need to learn how to use that weapon, you need to know your rights, you need to
[2:40:13.760 --> 2:40:19.840]  study into the Second Amendment, and you need to realize that it's there for your protection.
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:25.120]  Now, you know, as far as the passive masses, you know, we've been dealing with this for
[2:40:25.120 --> 2:40:29.560]  almost a century, that people have been absorbed in their local sports team, or you know, before
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:33.680]  television it was what was on the radio, and now it's, you know, what's on the television,
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:38.160]  and progressively, we've become number and dumber, in my opinion, we don't care about
[2:40:38.160 --> 2:40:43.120]  the issues, you know, even in the radio days, people listen to the presidential radio address
[2:40:43.120 --> 2:40:46.760]  once a week, you know, you don't hear that anymore, people don't listen to Bush once
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:50.160]  a week on his presidential radio address, it just doesn't happen, people don't even
[2:40:50.160 --> 2:40:54.720]  know unless the media reports on it on the big television, and the majority of those people
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:41:03.720]  aren't in it for the CNNs, the MSNBCs, you know, the C-SPANs, they're in it for ESPN4,
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:09.840]  you know, oh wow, I can watch poker live on TV, oh it's exhilarating, and it is disappointing
[2:41:09.840 --> 2:41:13.640]  man, but you know, I'm gonna keep trucking along because I don't want my freedoms to
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:18.680]  go away, and you know, I indulge, you know, I'm a Simpsons fan, Sunday nights I kick
[2:41:18.680 --> 2:41:23.720]  back and I watch animation domination, and I wanna lose that, but to me that's secondary,
[2:41:23.720 --> 2:41:28.160]  you know, and I thank you for the call, Jonathan, that stuff is secondary, and primary for me
[2:41:28.160 --> 2:41:33.560]  now is to be involved in this patriot movement and wake people up, and almost to the fact
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:39.200]  that you know, when I used to have desk jobs, or even you know, regular blue collar jobs,
[2:41:39.200 --> 2:41:43.680]  I wouldn't shut up at the workplace, it became annoying to people, but they need to know,
[2:41:43.680 --> 2:41:46.200]  you need to drive it into their heads, don't you agree?
[2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:51.680]  Oh absolutely, I'm familiarized myself with the bait, and of course I get a lot of books
[2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:56.560]  that I read, and you know, one of the things that I noticed works in getting something
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:06.080]  done in this movement is educating myself pretty much constantly on debate, on information,
[2:42:06.080 --> 2:42:10.200]  looking at the common things that are said when people refute my claims and trying to
[2:42:10.200 --> 2:42:14.320]  figure out, I think in my head okay, what's the best way to respond to this, and then
[2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:19.120]  I go home and I plan it out, and what's the best way I can influence somebody to look
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:23.440]  at this without thinking I'm crazy or I don't know what I'm talking about, and kind of break
[2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:27.560]  that ice form and say, oh well, you know, and then make a nice little philosophical
[2:42:27.560 --> 2:42:31.960]  jump or even better if you can refer to something in the past, you know, the anthrax attacks
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:35.640]  is one of the easiest ways to get people to look at things because you go, oh yeah, that
[2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:39.600]  was an inside job, but you know, of course no one's arrested or you know, and then you
[2:42:39.600 --> 2:42:43.520]  can, if you know history well, you can go back and you can start talking about past
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:48.960]  events where this kind of stuff has happened, and if you familiarize this information so
[2:42:48.960 --> 2:42:55.000]  that it's right there to pull from your brain basically at that very given moment, that's
[2:42:55.000 --> 2:43:00.320]  what I've noticed helps is that the more information you put on somebody directly and the more
[2:43:00.320 --> 2:43:06.240]  you break that ice for them, the more they are interested in receiving information from
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:11.120]  you, getting your website, getting a card, getting a DVD, whatever you've got on you,
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:16.320]  and so we carry around DVDs, we carry around, we just give them a website name, you know,
[2:43:16.320 --> 2:43:22.320]  give people information, talk to family, talk to friends, talk to workers, co-workers, people,
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:28.080]  you know, just you're hanging out with, anytime, every time, all the time, and the movement
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.640]  grows, we've affected thousands of people by getting local media attention here in Colorado
[2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:37.240]  by just getting us on the news, and once you get people to go to your site, if you can
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:41.960]  just get people to go to your site, which usually you can, make sure your site is filled
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:46.120]  with information and links and video clips and YouTube, and this is an age of information,
[2:43:46.120 --> 2:43:51.560]  so people, once they go to those sites, are immediately broken out of their shells.
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:56.880]  So that's how this is accomplished, by getting out there, getting involved, getting publicity,
[2:43:56.880 --> 2:44:00.560]  and once you can get people to go to a site, or get people to watch a DVD, or get people
[2:44:00.560 --> 2:44:04.760]  to read a book, whatever methods you want to use, I mean, use all of them, that's going
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:08.000]  to wake people up, and I've noticed the results in that, and seeing it firsthand, we've got
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:12.960]  thousands of people in Colorado wake up, you know, we spent about four weeks promoting
[2:44:12.960 --> 2:44:19.840]  Loose Change event here that we did out here with you and Cory and Dylan, and we got almost
[2:44:19.840 --> 2:44:24.600]  2,000 people, and you know, the results of that have been just phenomenal, I mean, we
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:29.920]  have a massive base now that we can coordinate events with, and we get a lot done.
[2:44:29.920 --> 2:44:34.400]  Absolutely, and one of my favorite little technological tricks are these new cell phones,
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:39.160]  you know, they hold a whole bunch of information, they're now video players and MP3 players,
[2:44:39.160 --> 2:44:43.680]  and I have Building 7 going down on mine, among other clips, about the vera chip and
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:49.000]  one world government, but I find that if I break out my cell phone, if they see my shirt,
[2:44:49.000 --> 2:44:53.360]  this says investigate 9-11, which is another form of guerrilla information war, people
[2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:59.000]  see that, and if I see somebody take notice and disgust, or even in curiosity, I walk
[2:44:59.000 --> 2:45:02.760]  up to that person, I say, listen, I'm wearing this shirt for a reason, did you know a third
[2:45:02.760 --> 2:45:05.640]  building went down on 9-11, what are you talking about?
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:08.240]  And then I show them, and they're like, wait a minute, what's that, a Vegas controlled
[2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:09.240]  demolition?
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:13.040]  I'm like, no, that's the 47 story skyscraper they don't want you to know about that fell
[2:45:13.040 --> 2:45:18.480]  into its own footprint at 520, it's a major spookhouse, largest CIA office outside of
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:22.880]  Virginia, largest secret service field office in the world, office of emergency management,
[2:45:22.880 --> 2:45:26.680]  department of defense, securities and exchange commission, and more.
[2:45:26.680 --> 2:45:31.320]  Alright, let's go to another caller, let's go to Randy in Michigan, Randy, are you with
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:32.320]  us?
[2:45:32.320 --> 2:45:34.320]  Randy, you with us?
[2:45:34.320 --> 2:45:35.320]  Yeah, of course.
[2:45:35.320 --> 2:45:42.200]  Oh, great, I just have questions about, as far as, first of all, I'm the biggest fan
[2:45:42.200 --> 2:45:48.080]  of the show ever, I mean, I love you and Alex Jones, you guys are great, I was wondering,
[2:45:48.080 --> 2:45:51.200]  what are we going to do about the internet, I think we have to have some planned things
[2:45:51.200 --> 2:45:54.520]  for ourselves, as far as, you know they're going to try to take it over, because you
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:46:00.120]  know how everything is with the media, the RIA, music, they want money, money, money,
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:05.720]  but like, I mean, I'm a big anti-Microsoft guy, I'm a big Linux user, I'm a computer
[2:46:05.720 --> 2:46:10.320]  nerd, I'm a musician, I'm all that, but like, I was just wondering like, what can we do
[2:46:10.320 --> 2:46:14.360]  to plan ahead for what they're going to do to the internet, that's like how I found out
[2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:18.840]  about you, and I bought your videos, and Alex Jones, and I mean, I have all your videos,
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:24.760]  I have the final cut, I have Alex Jones, you know, InfoWars videos, and-
[2:46:24.760 --> 2:46:28.840]  Sure, well what I think we need to do about it is first, inform people about internet
[2:46:28.840 --> 2:46:32.960]  2, okay, most people don't know what internet 2 is, they don't believe it exists, but you
[2:46:32.960 --> 2:46:36.800]  need to show them, well you know, biometrics is becoming big, and have you noticed that
[2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:41.320]  on some of the new keyboards and laptops, they have this thumb scan, oh but that makes
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:44.840]  me more secure, well you need to point out that that doesn't make them so secure, you
[2:46:44.840 --> 2:46:49.760]  need to show them the next level, you need to show them the verichip, and how in 2004,
[2:46:49.760 --> 2:46:57.480]  the FDA approved a implantable human microchip, okay, let me say it again, an implantable human
[2:46:57.480 --> 2:47:02.800]  microchip that gives off a radio frequency ID, and you can program to do all sorts of
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:06.600]  things, if you don't believe me folks, you can go on eBay, and you can get the ones
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:11.040]  for your dogs, okay, and it comes with an actual hypodermic needle, and then you pay
[2:47:11.040 --> 2:47:15.200]  like ten dollars a month, and you can literally be tracked by a GPS system the rest of your
[2:47:15.200 --> 2:47:17.600]  life if you like, is that what you want?
[2:47:17.600 --> 2:47:21.800]  So dude, I mean you just gotta reach out, first, first and foremost for me is family
[2:47:21.800 --> 2:47:25.120]  all the time, whether they're gonna laugh in my face or think I'm crazy, you know,
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:29.080]  my family is number one to me, second is my friends, you know, I want them to know, I
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:32.760]  want them to tell their friends, and right now we're at the point where it has to be
[2:47:32.760 --> 2:47:38.120]  an information war, and it has to be an information war where we take our marching orders to the
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:42.040]  street, not just to message boards, which is good, don't get me wrong, and not just
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:49.440]  to internet websites, but to the outside world, to coffee shops, okay, to bars, to people,
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:53.840]  to places where people actually go, to malls, where the most brainwashed people are, the
[2:47:53.840 --> 2:47:57.240]  people that spend, you know, five days out of the week at a mall, they're the ones that
[2:47:57.240 --> 2:48:00.560]  really need to wake up from this consumerist culture.
[2:48:00.560 --> 2:48:04.560]  And I thank you for the call, Randy, I hope I led you in the right direction, but you
[2:48:04.560 --> 2:48:08.880]  know, it's only through sharing this information with others that we're gonna be able to make
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:13.720]  a dent in this globalist agenda, Jonathan, and that's really how you got started was
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:18.240]  going around telling people, then you picked up a camera, then you started to go to events,
[2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:22.560]  then you started posting on YouTube, and you know, it's really just snowballed for you
[2:48:22.560 --> 2:48:26.760]  to the point where you have Gary Hart agreeing to interviews.
[2:48:26.760 --> 2:48:32.640]  Yeah, exactly, and he did kind of stiff arm us on that interview, well, he's been pushing
[2:48:32.640 --> 2:48:37.000]  us back, I think he got the feeling that, I think he caught on either to one of our
[2:48:37.000 --> 2:48:42.320]  videos or one of our articles about him, but you know, we did have a sit-down interview
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:48.000]  with him organized, set up, I got him a couple questions that I never posted online yet,
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:51.600]  waiting of course for that interview, which Gary, if you're out there, you know, you
[2:48:51.600 --> 2:48:55.640]  know, let's do this interview, but no, we still talked to the assistant and tried to
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:49:01.280]  get that interview going, and he's avoiding us like no other, but yeah, I mean, you know,
[2:49:01.280 --> 2:49:06.400]  I started out small and basically just started out reading books, watching the DVDs, and
[2:49:06.400 --> 2:49:10.120]  you know, following the movement here and there, and once I became convinced that they
[2:49:10.120 --> 2:49:15.480]  were gonna try to launch a campaign against us, I said, no, forget that, that's gonna
[2:49:15.480 --> 2:49:20.480]  backfire in my book, because now I'm gonna launch a campaign against your disinformation,
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:26.040]  and that's where it kind of triggered for me to go after the New World Order crowd and
[2:49:26.040 --> 2:49:30.800]  you know, specifically target information, and you know, battle this battle, you know,
[2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:34.720]  and people know when they look at this, they know what the answer is, because it's easy
[2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:40.280]  when you look at the evidence, but what's not easy is when people just believe what
[2:49:40.280 --> 2:49:44.880]  they hear, do the research, go out there, get involved, that's one of the reasons why
[2:49:44.880 --> 2:49:50.320]  I got so motivated, is when I actually started doing my own research and realizing how real
[2:49:50.320 --> 2:49:58.040]  this information is and how important it is and vital to my security, my safety, my survival,
[2:49:58.040 --> 2:50:01.640]  and that's what I actually did is, once I started actually finding this information
[2:50:01.640 --> 2:50:05.760]  out for myself, don't take our words for it, look into it yourself, it's as clear as day,
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:10.080]  I'm that confident with it, and you know, I'm transparent, you know, I'm not hiding
[2:50:10.080 --> 2:50:13.760]  anything, I've got nothing to hide, all the information's out there, all I'm doing is
[2:50:13.760 --> 2:50:17.520]  putting pieces together, and I hate to be the messenger, but hey look, we need more
[2:50:17.520 --> 2:50:21.720]  of them, because we're headed towards a brick wall at 90 miles an hour, and we're all arguing
[2:50:21.720 --> 2:50:25.880]  who's in the front seat people, we need to stop watching these different shows, I mean
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:31.200]  I hate to say this, but we gotta wake up, we gotta, we gotta country that's on imminent
[2:50:31.200 --> 2:50:36.760]  different forms of collapses and you know, illegal wars, and we can do something to stop
[2:50:36.760 --> 2:50:37.760]  it now, if we get involved.
[2:50:37.760 --> 2:50:41.280]  You certainly can Jonathan, and we're gonna do the final segment with you on the other
[2:50:41.280 --> 2:50:45.840]  side, we're gonna take more calls, and then the final hour over at PrismPlanet.tv, you
[2:50:45.840 --> 2:50:48.040]  can get the video feed, you can see my pretty face.
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:51.840]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:50:51.840 --> 2:50:56.840]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:50:56.840 --> 2:51:02.840]  It's known as the Builder Bird, put their objective to be world domination.
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:08.240]  For thousands of years their dark order grew, now as they hail the birth of the new world
[2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:14.840]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:21.800]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:51:21.800 --> 2:51:25.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:51:25.680 --> 2:51:28.320]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[2:51:28.320 --> 2:51:31.480]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:33.680]  they're after power, that's their after easy.

[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:47.120]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved, you have been warned.
[2:51:47.120 --> 2:51:50.400]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[2:51:50.400 --> 2:51:53.800]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[2:51:53.800 --> 2:51:58.600]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately
[2:51:58.600 --> 2:52:03.800]  to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:08.120]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is
[2:52:08.120 --> 2:52:13.440]  all that's left, when the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only
[2:52:13.440 --> 2:52:18.280]  chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[2:52:18.280 --> 2:52:21.920]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest
[2:52:21.920 --> 2:52:26.880]  of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[2:52:26.880 --> 2:52:31.960]  Decide it's food now or probably never, but can you afford to be wrong?
[2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:32.960]  Decide now.
[2:52:32.960 --> 2:52:34.560]  Place your bet.
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:42.120]  When you afford to be wrong, call 800-409-5633 on the WebEFoodsDirect.com.
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:47.160]  Call 800-409-5633.
[2:52:47.160 --> 2:52:50.560]  Attention gardeners, this is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[2:52:50.560 --> 2:52:55.240]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[2:52:55.240 --> 2:52:58.760]  It's called proto-grow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems
[2:52:58.760 --> 2:53:03.440]  to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[2:53:03.440 --> 2:53:07.000]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[2:53:07.000 --> 2:53:10.600]  Proto-grow's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically
[2:53:10.600 --> 2:53:14.520]  increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[2:53:14.520 --> 2:53:17.720]  Proto-grow works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock
[2:53:17.720 --> 2:53:20.280]  the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[2:53:20.280 --> 2:53:23.360]  Proto-grow's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary
[2:53:23.360 --> 2:53:25.840]  taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[2:53:25.840 --> 2:53:29.360]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:32.960]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:36.520]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt-sheep superfood should visit the Proto-grow website
[2:53:36.520 --> 2:53:38.080]  at GrowLikeCrazy.com.
[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:43.640]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[2:53:43.640 --> 2:54:11.080]  I wish your buck was still silver, it was back when the country was wrong.
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:23.400]  Back before Elks and before Vietnam War came along.
[2:54:23.400 --> 2:54:37.920]  Before the Beatles and yesterday, when a man could still work and still would, it was the
[2:54:37.920 --> 2:54:51.240]  last of the free life behind us now, and our good times really over for good.
[2:54:51.240 --> 2:55:03.200]  And I was rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell.
[2:55:03.200 --> 2:55:14.040]  No kind of chance for the flag of the Liberty Bell.
[2:55:14.040 --> 2:55:21.480]  I wish your Ford and his Chevy would still last 10 years like this year.
[2:55:21.480 --> 2:55:24.200]  All right, it is the Alex Jones show.
[2:55:24.200 --> 2:55:31.080]  I am Jason Bermas, in for Alex Jones, infowars.com is the website folks, and you can go to infowars.com
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:32.840]  and get this feed.
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:33.840]  Here we're done.
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:37.240]  If you missed any of the first jam-packed three hours, you're going to want to listen
[2:55:37.240 --> 2:55:41.520]  to this one because I can't believe what they're printing at the post, man.
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:44.200]  Bushbashers smashes disabled teen.
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:46.320]  Bushbashers smashes disabled teen.
[2:55:46.320 --> 2:55:47.400]  Now they lie about him.
[2:55:47.400 --> 2:55:51.560]  They say that he was screaming obscenities at Laura and Jenna Bush.
[2:55:51.560 --> 2:55:52.560]  That's not true.
[2:55:52.560 --> 2:55:54.000]  I didn't hear one curse word out of these guys.
[2:55:54.000 --> 2:56:00.360]  I'm sure they were talking about the fact that their husband or his husband is a globalist
[2:56:00.360 --> 2:56:01.360]  pig.
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:03.760]  He's a member of Skull and Bones.
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:04.760]  He's a criminal.
[2:56:04.760 --> 2:56:07.000]  He needs to be brought up on war crimes.
[2:56:07.000 --> 2:56:10.120]  I'm sick of the propaganda.
[2:56:10.120 --> 2:56:13.320]  We have Jonathan Ellen off for the next few minutes, and we're going to go and do student
[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:17.120]  scholars for 9-11 Truth, but we are at the bottom of the hour, Jonathan.
[2:56:17.120 --> 2:56:20.360]  I was just hoping that you'd give out a couple of websites and wrap it up where people can
[2:56:20.360 --> 2:56:22.360]  get in touch with your information.
[2:56:22.360 --> 2:56:23.360]  Sure.
[2:56:23.360 --> 2:56:30.120]  I'm an activist at We Are Changed Colorado with all the other great members there at
[2:56:30.120 --> 2:56:32.600]  WeAreChangedColorado.org.
[2:56:32.600 --> 2:56:36.400]  I write on the website truthalliance.net.
[2:56:36.400 --> 2:56:41.720]  You can see I just posted an article called Missing Nukes, Dead Soldiers, and what do
[2:56:41.720 --> 2:56:47.280]  these all have in common for those who maybe forgot about the Missing Nukes case last year.
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:52.280]  It all connects to a famous 9-11 whistleblower who was also poisoned, all related to Barksdale
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:53.280]  Air Force Base.
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:56:54.280]  That's on truthalliance.net.
[2:56:54.280 --> 2:56:58.520]  I encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with this information because it's a dropping
[2:56:58.520 --> 2:57:04.120]  story, and it's dropping very quickly, and we should really be following up on this information
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:05.120]  out there.
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:08.800]  If anyone can, and they're available to go to the Barksdale Air Force Base or Mino Air
[2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:12.880]  Force Base, please go there, start asking questions, get an investigation.
[2:57:12.880 --> 2:57:14.680]  There's no reason for nukes to be missing.
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:19.320]  Then, of course, I'm also starting Join Raw and the Republicans Against the War activist
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:20.320]  group.
[2:57:20.320 --> 2:57:21.320]  You can go to joinraw.com.
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:22.840]  I see the ads for that.
[2:57:22.840 --> 2:57:26.560]  We're still organizing that site.
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:30.680]  It's always a pleasure being on this show and sharing the information with you, Vermas,
[2:57:30.680 --> 2:57:35.360]  and it's always fun meeting somebody on the sidelines here in this battle.
[2:57:35.360 --> 2:57:36.360]  Absolutely.
[2:57:36.360 --> 2:57:39.840]  You really have brought a lot of people in in Colorado through your activism, through
[2:57:39.840 --> 2:57:43.440]  one man, with the will to bring the truth to the people.
[2:57:43.440 --> 2:57:45.720]  It always starts with one, folks.
[2:57:45.720 --> 2:57:50.400]  You've got to make the decision in your heart that you want to make change in this world.
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:52.560]  That's why we are Change Exists.
[2:57:52.560 --> 2:57:54.200]  That's why truthaction.org exists.
[2:57:54.200 --> 2:57:56.520]  That's why Lone Lantern exists.
[2:57:56.520 --> 2:58:01.240]  That's why Infowars and PrismPlanet.com exists because Alex Jones was fed up.
[2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:04.600]  Top of the hour, we got student scholars from 9-11 Truth and then a surprise guest telling
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:06.200]  us what happened.
[2:58:06.200 --> 2:58:11.360]  At this confrontation in New York City at We Are Change, we'll be back after this PrismPlanet.tv
[2:58:11.360 --> 2:58:12.360]  for the video feed.
[2:58:12.360 --> 2:58:29.800]  Final hour coming up.

[2:58:42.760 --> 2:58:49.000]  the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely
[2:58:49.000 --> 2:58:51.480]  destroys the official fable forever.
[2:58:51.480 --> 2:58:55.760]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which
[2:58:55.760 --> 2:59:00.560]  family members receive answers to their questions, and the true perpetrators of the horrendous
[2:59:00.560 --> 2:59:02.520]  crime are brought to justice.
[2:59:02.520 --> 2:59:05.960]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[2:59:05.960 --> 2:59:10.400]  From hijackers being trained at U.S. military bases, to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change
[2:59:10.400 --> 2:59:14.160]  Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[2:59:28.280 --> 2:59:29.280]  of other titles.
[2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:32.240]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[2:59:32.240 --> 2:59:36.440]  Business is our weapon, and prismplanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight
[2:59:36.440 --> 3:00:06.280]  back to Big Brother.
[3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:18.720]  Well ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones Show 4th Hour, brand spanking new, second
[3:00:18.720 --> 3:00:23.040]  week it's happened, and boy am I excited, I mean, not only do we have the student scholars
[3:00:23.040 --> 3:00:28.160]  on, and we plugged a little bit of their event on May 17th in the first hour, but we're gonna
[3:00:28.160 --> 3:00:33.080]  have an eyewitness to what went down over at this We Are Change confrontation, I mean
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:37.480]  it's all over the right wing blog, it's on Michelle Malkin's site, you know this is gonna
[3:00:37.480 --> 3:00:44.240]  be a talking point on the news tonight, that We Are Change attacked a crippled girl with
[3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:45.360]  cerebral palsy.
[3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:49.040]  This is what you're gonna see on Fox News tonight, I promise you.
[3:00:49.040 --> 3:00:52.080]  If you don't see it on O'Reilly, you're gonna see it on Hannity, and if you don't see it
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:55.400]  there, you're gonna see it on some other right wing ridiculous show.
[3:00:55.400 --> 3:01:01.280]  Okay, that's the bottom line, they're demonizing us, and that's why it's so important to get
[3:01:01.280 --> 3:01:05.480]  these videos, to get, you know, the road to tyranny, to get martial law, to get loose
[3:01:05.480 --> 3:01:10.280]  change final cut, make copies, hand them out, and show people.
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:14.880]  The 9-11 Truth movement just wants, you know, justice for those who carried out the attacks.
[3:01:14.880 --> 3:01:18.000]  We just want our Constitution and Bill of Rights back.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:23.080]  And that's why right now I am completely honored to have one of the co-founders of
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:30.840]  Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth, that's sst911.org, on with me right now to talk a little bit
[3:01:30.840 --> 3:01:34.880]  of 9-11 Truth, and not only talk a little bit of 9-11 Truth, but talk about this great
[3:01:34.880 --> 3:01:36.200]  symposium that he's put together.
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:39.760]  I really didn't get to talk about people other than J. Michael Springman that are gonna
[3:01:39.760 --> 3:01:44.720]  be there, but Daniel Hobsick is gonna be there, Muhammadata in the Venice Flying Circus, Donna
[3:01:44.720 --> 3:01:49.040]  March O'Connor, and Michelle Little, family members, are going to be there, as well as
[3:01:49.040 --> 3:01:50.040]  Bob McElvane.
[3:01:50.040 --> 3:01:53.360]  If you haven't heard him speak, he's a very powerful speaker, he's a great guy too by
[3:01:53.360 --> 3:01:54.360]  the way.
[3:01:54.360 --> 3:01:55.360]  Really nice guy.
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:02:01.240]  Lucian Giada, John Gold, Sandra Hicks, Barry's Wicker, myself, you know, and I'm gonna be
[3:02:01.240 --> 3:02:04.480]  showing a little bit of fabled enemies there, it's probably gonna be the first place that
[3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:06.520]  anybody gets to see this film.
[3:02:06.520 --> 3:02:09.920]  So Justin, great to have you on the Alex Jones show with me buddy.
[3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:14.040]  Well, it's my pleasure, thanks a lot for having me on the show.
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:19.080]  Well, why don't you tell a little bit about how you got started in this whole movement,
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:23.920]  what you've been able to accomplish, and then we'll get into what you're doing in May.
[3:02:23.920 --> 3:02:31.760]  Sure, well, I first started Student Scholars for 9-Eleven Truth with Mike Jackman back
[3:02:31.760 --> 3:02:38.480]  in February 2007, so we've been going just a little bit over a year at this point.
[3:02:38.480 --> 3:02:43.320]  And essentially, you know, it was just set up because we wanted to set up a coalition
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:47.920]  of students across the world who are seriously looking into this subject.
[3:02:47.920 --> 3:02:53.440]  Now we have about 80 members from all across the United States, Canada, the UK, and as far
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:03:00.320]  away as Japan, so we're very excited and we were able to get pretty much every single
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:05.800]  presidential candidate during this past five-month season on record, you know, with their views
[3:03:05.800 --> 3:03:09.200]  on a new 9-Eleven investigation.
[3:03:09.200 --> 3:03:13.320]  And if any of the listeners out there want to learn more or watch the videos or check
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:17.520]  it out, they can visit FFT911.org, that's a little bit of the background.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:21.800]  Yeah, absolutely, and you guys have been at it now well over a year.
[3:03:21.800 --> 3:03:25.920]  Michael Jackman, the other co-founder of this organization, his brother, Eric Jackman,
[3:03:25.920 --> 3:03:32.840]  also highly involved, and you just started out as a student who was into MassCom in New
[3:03:32.840 --> 3:03:38.320]  Hampshire and said, hey, I'm going to do something, I can get press passes, and I think the first
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:43.360]  time we met in person was actually at those primary debates in June, correct?
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:46.480]  Yeah, I think that was the first time that we met.
[3:03:46.480 --> 3:03:52.880]  I think I'd been on your show prior to that, but yeah, we were there, I think it was the
[3:03:52.880 --> 3:03:56.000]  Republican debate back in June, wasn't it?
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:03:59.980]  Yeah, absolutely, in June, and I mean, I was able with my press pass to talk to people
[3:03:59.980 --> 3:04:06.920]  like Tommy Thompson, Sam Brownback, James Gilmore, Duncan Hunter, and others about
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:11.680]  not only the really important issues regarding 9-Eleven, such as the Pakistani funding, the
[3:04:11.680 --> 3:04:20.600]  fact that Bin Laden is supposedly in Pakistan, and the fact we're not going after these people,
[3:04:20.600 --> 3:04:24.960]  the veil that they're putting on, the veil of hypocrisy, the veil that the mainstream
[3:04:24.960 --> 3:04:26.640]  media wants us to believe.
[3:04:26.640 --> 3:04:30.160]  Well, I'm not buying it anymore, Justin, and we're going to be back, we're going to be
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:31.160]  taking calls.
[3:04:31.160 --> 3:04:37.040]  We've got Justin Martel, sst911.org, the New England 9-Eleven symposium coming at you
[3:04:37.040 --> 3:04:45.040]  in May, May 17th, we'll be back to discuss more with Justin Martel.
[3:04:45.040 --> 3:04:49.280]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[3:04:49.280 --> 3:04:53.840]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:04:53.840 --> 3:04:56.320]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:04:56.320 --> 3:04:59.840]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:04:59.840 --> 3:05:03.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:08.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:05:08.000 --> 3:05:13.400]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:05:13.400 --> 3:05:18.280]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:05:18.280 --> 3:05:22.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:05:22.680 --> 3:05:25.360]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:28.520]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[3:05:28.520 --> 3:05:29.520]  they're after power.
[3:05:29.520 --> 3:05:30.520]  That's their affidavit.

[3:05:39.120 --> 3:05:40.120]  You have been warned.

[3:05:49.120 --> 3:05:52.520]  threat of MRSA black mold bird flu and more.
[3:05:52.520 --> 3:05:57.440]  The EPA has stated that indoor air is up to five times more polluted than outdoors causing
[3:05:57.440 --> 3:06:02.080]  50% of all illnesses, now you can protect your home and family with the world's best

[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:46.680]  All you men out there, you need to listen up.
[3:06:46.680 --> 3:06:52.040]  By the age of 60, one in two men already have a prostate related health issue.
[3:06:52.040 --> 3:06:53.040]  What does this mean?
[3:06:53.040 --> 3:06:58.160]  It might be an enlarged prostate, difficulty going to the bathroom, and a diminished sex
[3:06:58.160 --> 3:06:59.160]  drive.
[3:06:59.160 --> 3:07:00.160]  Not a pretty picture.
[3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:04.480]  If you're a man, you need to give your body nutrition to support prostate health.
[3:07:04.480 --> 3:07:05.600]  There's no question about it.
[3:07:05.600 --> 3:07:09.440]  Many people hear this and they might think saw palmetto, but there's something so much
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:10.880]  better out there.
[3:07:10.880 --> 3:07:15.840]  It's called beta prostate and it contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than
[3:07:15.840 --> 3:07:17.400]  ordinary saw palmetto.
[3:07:17.400 --> 3:07:21.440]  So before you try anything else, try beta prostate.
[3:07:21.440 --> 3:07:24.520]  Ignoring your prostate's not going to make the problems go away.
[3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:29.360]  Taking beta prostate is guaranteed to provide effective, all-natural support.
[3:07:29.360 --> 3:07:32.520]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[3:07:32.520 --> 3:07:35.360]  That's 1-800-457-9914.
[3:07:35.360 --> 3:07:39.960]  Call now and find out how you can get a free bottle of beta prostate with your order.
[3:07:39.960 --> 3:07:43.000]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[3:07:43.000 --> 3:07:45.920]  Call now.
[3:07:45.920 --> 3:07:52.520]  From his central Texas command center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[3:07:52.520 --> 3:07:59.240]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:59.240 --> 3:08:05.440]  We are back live folks, fourth hour video feed over at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:08:05.440 --> 3:08:10.400]  Over there at infowars.com they are offering Washington your fired William Lewis' new picture
[3:08:10.400 --> 3:08:11.400]  about D.C.
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:13.840]  He's asking some tough questions.
[3:08:13.840 --> 3:08:18.560]  What violations of the Constitution will most directly impact Americans?
[3:08:18.560 --> 3:08:21.320]  Let's try out the little document cam over here.
[3:08:21.320 --> 3:08:26.960]  We got the document cam and then the VGA thing and bang, there we go, there's a little piece
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:27.960]  of the cover there.
[3:08:27.960 --> 3:08:29.800]  Let's move it up a little.
[3:08:29.800 --> 3:08:30.800]  There you go.
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:32.880]  There's William Lewis himself on the cover.
[3:08:32.880 --> 3:08:36.800]  There's Bob Bowman, Maria Heller, and I'm not sure who the other individual is, but
[3:08:36.800 --> 3:08:39.840]  all great patriots and I can't wait to sit down and watch this.
[3:08:39.840 --> 3:08:42.200]  The guy's done some really great work in the past.
[3:08:42.200 --> 3:08:46.720]  You can get that exclusively over at infowars.com.
[3:08:46.720 --> 3:08:51.920]  Now I have Justin Martel from Student Scholars for 9-Eleven Truth until at least half past
[3:08:51.920 --> 3:08:56.160]  the hour because we're actually going to have, I believe her name is Diane Lipson who was
[3:08:56.160 --> 3:09:00.840]  at this event with We Are Change who witnessed what really went down.
[3:09:00.840 --> 3:09:06.840]  And of course folks, Gary did not punch a disabled girl in a wheelchair, but that doesn't
[3:09:06.840 --> 3:09:08.920]  stop the New York Post from reporting it.
[3:09:08.920 --> 3:09:11.680]  And then we're going to have Gary on in the fifth hour.
[3:09:11.680 --> 3:09:12.680]  That's right.
[3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:17.360]  I'm going to go over about 15, 20 minutes and give Gary side of the whole story.
[3:09:17.360 --> 3:09:21.640]  It should be a jam-packed next hour plus over at the Alex Jones show.
[3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:24.760]  I'm very excited and I want to thank Alex again for letting me sit in.
[3:09:24.760 --> 3:09:28.880]  Justin, this event you're throwing, why don't you let the people know what this event is
[3:09:28.880 --> 3:09:32.080]  all about, how it came to be, and how they can get tickets to it?
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:33.080]  Okay.
[3:09:33.080 --> 3:09:37.880]  So what's going on is on May 17th, we're having the New England 9-Eleven symposium.
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:43.560]  It's going to be held at Keene High School here in Keene, New Hampshire.
[3:09:43.560 --> 3:09:47.000]  And it'll be, it'll be doors open at 9 a.m.
[3:09:47.000 --> 3:09:50.240]  The event will start around 9.30, 9.45.
[3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:55.720]  Tickets are $15 at the door, $10 for students and $10 for seniors.
[3:09:55.720 --> 3:10:01.040]  And we've got a whole lineup of great guests for everyone.
[3:10:01.040 --> 3:10:05.440]  And the event, the theme, the central theme of course is family members, whistleblowers
[3:10:05.440 --> 3:10:08.960]  and researchers speak out.
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:09.960]  Absolutely.
[3:10:09.960 --> 3:10:13.320]  And why don't you name off who's going to be there and why it's so important.
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:16.840]  I mean, you've literally got people that have never come out to any of these types
[3:10:16.840 --> 3:10:18.440]  of events before.
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:19.440]  Okay.
[3:10:19.440 --> 3:10:26.960]  Well, essentially, there's going to be, well, as I said, so we're going to have Daniel
[3:10:26.960 --> 3:10:31.800]  Sinjar, who's the star of the TV program, Rescue Me, one of the hardest working celebrities
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:36.080]  for 911 Truth, and he's tentatively scheduled to host the symposium.
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:38.880]  Then we'll have, of course, Bob McElvane Sinjar.
[3:10:38.880 --> 3:10:44.200]  He's the father of Bobby McElvane, Jr., who lost his life on 911.
[3:10:44.200 --> 3:10:48.960]  And Mr. McElvane attended every 911 Commission hearing as a member of September 11th families
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:49.960]  for Peaceful Tomorrow.
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:52.960]  He's traveled all over the world speaking about 911.
[3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:56.800]  And for one of our researchers, we'll have, of course, Daniel Hobsaker.
[3:10:56.800 --> 3:11:02.640]  He's an investigative journalist and the author of, he's the author of Welcome to Maryland,
[3:11:02.640 --> 3:11:05.640]  Muhammad Adda, and the 911 cover-up in Florida.
[3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:11.440]  Next, of course, we'll have Michelle Little, and she lost her brother, FDNY firefighter
[3:11:11.440 --> 3:11:13.880]  David M. Weiss, on 911.
[3:11:13.880 --> 3:11:17.960]  And along with 911 family members Donna Marshall Connor and Christina Kimanik, Little called
[3:11:17.960 --> 3:11:23.680]  for a real investigation into 911 at the National Press Club on 911 2006.
[3:11:23.680 --> 3:11:29.320]  And we'll have Sandra Hicks, and he's an author and investigative journalist, and he's done
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:34.760]  extensive research into the ISI Pakistan connection to 911 and published The Big Wedding,
[3:11:34.760 --> 3:11:38.920]  which details the whistleblowers and many conflicts of interest within the 911 Commission
[3:11:38.920 --> 3:11:39.920]  as well.
[3:11:39.920 --> 3:11:43.280]  And Hicks is going to be speaking about his current investigation into the mysterious
[3:11:43.280 --> 3:11:46.160]  death of Dr. David Graham.
[3:11:46.160 --> 3:11:51.840]  We'll have Donna Marshall Connor, and she's also a very active 911 family member.
[3:11:51.840 --> 3:11:56.280]  She lost her daughter in the towers on 911, and she was, of course, there with Michelle
[3:11:56.280 --> 3:12:00.280]  Little and Christina Kimanik on 911 2006 at the National Press Club.
[3:12:00.280 --> 3:12:06.000]  We'll have Barry Zwicker, who is an award-winning Canadian alternative media journalist, documentary
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:08.320]  producer, and political activist.
[3:12:08.320 --> 3:12:12.320]  His presentation will concern the media blackout of alternative 911 theory.
[3:12:12.320 --> 3:12:15.720]  And then, of course, we'll have you, Jason Bermitt.
[3:12:15.720 --> 3:12:21.280]  And I think the folks out there know, but you're, of course, a documentary filmmaker,
[3:12:21.280 --> 3:12:25.240]  and your two films, Loose Change, Second Edition, and Loose Change, Final Cut, are pretty much
[3:12:25.240 --> 3:12:31.360]  responsible for bringing this movement onto the brink of becoming mainstream.
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:35.040]  And then we'll have John Gold, who's a longtime researcher and activist.
[3:12:35.040 --> 3:12:38.520]  And he was instrumental in the production of 911 Press for Truth, and has been an advocate
[3:12:38.520 --> 3:12:41.680]  for 911 First Responders and the Feel Good Foundation.
[3:12:41.680 --> 3:12:45.040]  And not only that, but no matter what happens with me, you're going to be able to see a
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:48.160]  portion of Fabled Enemies, my new 911 picture.
[3:12:48.160 --> 3:12:52.480]  I sent you the script probably like two weeks ago now, and you've read through quite a bit
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:53.480]  of it.
[3:12:53.480 --> 3:12:58.280]  Obviously, it's undergone a few changes, and I've edited the first 10 or 15 minutes
[3:12:58.280 --> 3:13:00.320]  over here in Austin, Texas.
[3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:01.760]  It's looking really great.
[3:13:01.760 --> 3:13:02.760]  I'm stoked.
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:06.440]  I think we need more projects to bring in more people.
[3:13:06.440 --> 3:13:10.920]  For some reason, Loose Change, Second Edition, or Loose Change, Final Cut may not be everyone's
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:12.360]  cup of tea.
[3:13:12.360 --> 3:13:16.720]  And this really does cover a lot of issues that the movement has largely ignored or
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:17.720]  marginalized.
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:18.720]  Definitely.
[3:13:18.720 --> 3:13:25.800]  I think that you focus on a lot of information that's out there, but a lot of people are
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:26.800]  not quick to cite.
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:32.320]  And it's a lot of very solid information that I think should be looked at and propagated
[3:13:32.320 --> 3:13:34.520]  by the movement more.
[3:13:34.520 --> 3:13:40.000]  And then, of course, I left out Michael Springman, who you mentioned earlier, who will be at
[3:13:40.000 --> 3:13:41.000]  the event.
[3:13:41.000 --> 3:13:45.880]  And Springman was, for those who don't know, either government whistleblower who, while
[3:13:45.880 --> 3:13:51.200]  working for the State Department, was the head U.S. consular official and the CIA-controlled
[3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:56.640]  U.S. consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from 1987 to 1989.
[3:13:56.640 --> 3:14:01.400]  And he later reported that he was forced by his superiors to issue visas for individuals
[3:14:01.400 --> 3:14:06.400]  traveling to the U.S. that he suspected were terrorists, and he later uncovered that these
[3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:09.880]  individuals were being trained in the U.S. and sent back to Afghanistan to fight the
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:10.880]  Russians.
[3:14:10.880 --> 3:14:14.840]  So this, of course, begs the question of just how involved this was in the CIA in the creation
[3:14:14.840 --> 3:14:16.600]  of what later became al-Qaeda.
[3:14:16.600 --> 3:14:19.360]  And they were working with their asset, Osama bin Laden.
[3:14:19.360 --> 3:14:20.920]  This was also told to him.
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:25.560]  You know, so this nonsense that the Dotgov sites put out, that they never supported bin
[3:14:25.560 --> 3:14:30.680]  Laden, and in fact, when they supported the Mujahideen, they used the ISI as a conduit.
[3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:34.480]  In other words, they give the ISI money, and then they would give it to the Mujahideen.
[3:14:34.480 --> 3:14:35.480]  That is true.
[3:14:35.480 --> 3:14:36.480]  They did do that.
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:37.480]  Okay?
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:41.140]  They've used the ISI, just like they used them on 9-11, to fund their operations and
[3:14:41.140 --> 3:14:44.600]  have that plausible deniability, if you will.
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:46.080]  But this guy was an asset.
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:47.080]  Okay?
[3:14:47.080 --> 3:14:50.880]  Osama bin Laden's family, the bin Laden family and the Bush family, were as tight as you
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:51.880]  can get.
[3:14:51.880 --> 3:14:52.880]  Okay?
[3:14:52.880 --> 3:14:57.000]  And then on top of that, you know, you have a CIA whistleblower who's working in the consulate
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:01.680]  at Jeddah, finding out that bin Laden is part of this whole plan.
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:03.280]  But the media just ignores it.
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:04.360]  They don't put them on the news.
[3:15:04.360 --> 3:15:09.320]  I think the most mainstream coverage that Springman actually got was one CBC interview
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:11.240]  that they took off their site, by the way.
[3:15:11.240 --> 3:15:16.960]  It's archived by Paul Joseph Watson over at his own site, I think propagandamatrix.com.
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:18.320]  You can find that.
[3:15:18.320 --> 3:15:21.320]  But it's incredible what he says, and that's also going to make my new movie.
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:23.160]  I think it's an important piece of the puzzle.
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:26.160]  I think it's been overlooked for far too long.
[3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:29.120]  And it's time for this information to go mainstream.
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:35.040]  It's time for people to understand that this administration and the previous administration
[3:15:35.040 --> 3:15:37.440]  and the administration before that are all corrupt.
[3:15:37.440 --> 3:15:38.880]  They're all part of this thing.
[3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:41.720]  It's not about Republican, it's not about Democrat.
[3:15:41.720 --> 3:15:43.840]  You know, the Clinton administration is culpable.
[3:15:43.840 --> 3:15:46.240]  The Bush administration is very culpable.
[3:15:46.240 --> 3:15:51.520]  I mean, they've passed outlandish legislation after the fact that really makes them, I guess,
[3:15:51.520 --> 3:15:53.600]  even bigger demons in my eyes.
[3:15:53.600 --> 3:15:57.240]  But when, you know, Bill Clinton gets confronted, and he's been confronted, folks, all over
[3:15:57.240 --> 3:16:04.240]  the country now about Bilderberg, about Bohemian Grove, and about 9-11, it disgusts me that
[3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:09.880]  pompous criminal says, how dare you, how dare you say it's an inside job?
[3:16:09.880 --> 3:16:12.720]  How dare you, Bill Clinton?
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:15.880]  You know, I know you ran Coke for the Bush family in the 80s.
[3:16:15.880 --> 3:16:17.480]  I know about Meena, Arkansas.
[3:16:17.480 --> 3:16:18.480]  People are waking up.
[3:16:18.480 --> 3:16:20.160]  You're going to have your day, too.
[3:16:20.160 --> 3:16:23.960]  Okay, just because you were slick on the television doesn't give you a pass.
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:25.760]  Justin, you want to take some calls?
[3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:26.760]  Sure.
[3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:27.760]  Let's do it.
[3:16:27.760 --> 3:16:28.760]  Let's do it.
[3:16:28.760 --> 3:16:29.760]  Let's take some calls.
[3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:31.640]  Let's see if Brian is still there from Alabama.
[3:16:31.640 --> 3:16:34.640]  Brian, are you with us?
[3:16:34.640 --> 3:16:35.640]  He did.
[3:16:35.640 --> 3:16:36.640]  We got Mark and Oregon.
[3:16:36.640 --> 3:16:37.640]  Yes.
[3:16:37.640 --> 3:16:38.640]  Hello, Jason.
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:39.640]  Hey.
[3:16:39.640 --> 3:16:40.640]  How are you doing, Mark?
[3:16:40.640 --> 3:16:41.640]  I'm doing fairly well, sir.
[3:16:41.640 --> 3:16:46.240]  And thank you very much for all the efforts in exposing these atrocities we go through.
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:47.640]  Well, thanks for listening.
[3:16:47.640 --> 3:16:48.640]  Yes, sir.
[3:16:48.640 --> 3:16:49.640]  Thank you for being there.
[3:16:49.640 --> 3:16:54.760]  Jason, by the way, I had something basically to mention about the Pentagon.
[3:16:54.760 --> 3:17:00.360]  But before that, you mentioned the Simpsons program.
[3:17:00.360 --> 3:17:05.520]  And I remember Alex several months ago, it wasn't that long ago, he had mentioned on
[3:17:05.520 --> 3:17:12.960]  his show that in one of the programs, Bart and his family took a trip to New York City.
[3:17:12.960 --> 3:17:17.720]  And it was, this was before 9-11, when this episode came out, and I'm not sure if you
[3:17:17.720 --> 3:17:23.400]  saw it or not, and that Bart Simpson was out sightseeing with his family and he looked
[3:17:23.400 --> 3:17:27.480]  up at the Twin Towers, and the Twin Towers were off in the distance, and then all of
[3:17:27.480 --> 3:17:33.440]  a sudden a nine appeared in the area of the Twin Towers in the far view, and Bart held
[3:17:33.440 --> 3:17:40.240]  up his fingers like one in one or in a V-sign or two fingers right by the nine to turn
[3:17:40.240 --> 3:17:45.400]  it into a very, you know, you could assume that that was saying 9-11.
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:50.040]  Well, I know what episode you're talking about, because there's only one episode where the
[3:17:50.040 --> 3:17:54.320]  Simpsons actually go to New York City, and I believe Homer goes into both Twin Towers
[3:17:54.320 --> 3:18:00.440]  because he has to urinate after drinking several cans of crab juice.
[3:18:00.440 --> 3:18:05.280]  That's the kind of Simpsons geek I am, folks, I've seen every episode, and I don't remember
[3:18:05.280 --> 3:18:08.760]  that slight part, but boy, is that interesting, and I'm definitely going to check that out,
[3:18:08.760 --> 3:18:16.200]  but I mean, we have them on the Lone Gunman, I guess the X-Files spin-off show, where
[3:18:16.200 --> 3:18:21.240]  the government has decided that they're going to remotely fly a commercial airliner into
[3:18:21.240 --> 3:18:25.520]  the Twin Towers and blame it on Arab terrorists.
[3:18:25.520 --> 3:18:33.120]  And I know the Nazis, I've understood that they actually did artistic renditions, basically,
[3:18:33.120 --> 3:18:38.120]  they would have artists and perhaps even photographic artists, so to speak, gathered
[3:18:38.120 --> 3:18:43.480]  into a room or rooms in different places, and for instance, before the invasion of
[3:18:43.480 --> 3:18:48.080]  Poland, they actually graphically represented it all out ahead of time.
[3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:51.800]  And I think, from what I've heard of that, it may have more significance outside of the
[3:18:51.800 --> 3:18:58.440]  occult, but that it's essentially an occult method of projection of desire or objective
[3:18:58.440 --> 3:19:04.320]  into reality through a telepathic means, essentially, through a spiritual means, but what I call
[3:19:04.320 --> 3:19:11.800]  today essentially about Jason and has mostly to do with the Pentagon, and basically, there's
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:16.800]  a film that was made five years ago, maybe a little longer ago, by a man named Eric
[3:19:16.800 --> 3:19:21.560]  Huffschmidt, and the film was called Troubling Questions, and I was wondering if you'd seen
[3:19:21.560 --> 3:19:22.560]  or heard of this movie.
[3:19:22.560 --> 3:19:27.280]  I have seen Eric Huffschmidt's work, I believe it was Painful Questions and Painful Deceptions,
[3:19:27.280 --> 3:19:32.600]  that was the film slash book titles of those, and we'll get into those on the other side
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:37.360]  with you, Mark, so hold over, and then we're going to talk to Justin Martel for one more
[3:19:37.360 --> 3:19:43.160]  segment, we're going to tell you where you can get tickets to this symposium on May 17th
[3:19:43.160 --> 3:19:45.000]  in New England over in New Hampshire.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:49.200]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:53.800]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:19:53.800 --> 3:19:59.800]  It's known as the Builder Bird, but their objective being world domination.
[3:19:59.800 --> 3:20:02.960]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:20:02.960 --> 3:20:08.880]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80%
[3:20:08.880 --> 3:20:13.280]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:20:13.280 --> 3:20:18.760]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:20:18.760 --> 3:20:22.680]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[3:20:22.680 --> 3:20:25.280]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:20:25.280 --> 3:20:28.440]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[3:20:28.440 --> 3:20:30.640]  they're after power, that's their after-easy.

[3:20:42.080 --> 3:20:44.080]  You have been warned.
[3:20:44.080 --> 3:20:45.080]  Fact.
[3:20:45.080 --> 3:20:49.560]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is
[3:20:49.560 --> 3:20:50.560]  staggering.
[3:20:50.560 --> 3:20:54.720]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[3:20:54.720 --> 3:20:59.160]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world
[3:20:59.160 --> 3:21:02.400]  in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[3:21:02.400 --> 3:21:03.400]  The solution.
[3:21:03.400 --> 3:21:07.360]  Detoxification integrated with the electro-cheap premier energy foot spa.

[3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:45.760]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[3:21:45.760 --> 3:21:50.280]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in Liberty's darkest
[3:21:50.280 --> 3:21:51.840]  hour there is hope.
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:54.880]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[3:21:54.880 --> 3:21:59.120]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[3:21:59.120 --> 3:22:00.640]  World Order master plan.
[3:22:00.640 --> 3:22:04.880]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[3:22:04.880 --> 3:22:10.080]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[3:22:10.080 --> 3:22:13.080]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[3:22:36.720 --> 3:22:42.120]  bombs to disc, put them on the file sharing networks, bring down the New World Order.
[3:22:42.120 --> 3:22:43.920]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[3:22:43.920 --> 3:22:48.360]  World Products now is introducing the new detoxer foot and body pads that work while
[3:22:48.360 --> 3:22:51.680]  you're sleeping to pull heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[3:22:51.680 --> 3:22:56.280]  Our detoxer pads release unwanted toxins, relieve stress and pain, and improve the immune
[3:22:56.280 --> 3:22:59.920]  system, circulation and blockages all while you're sleeping.
[3:22:59.920 --> 3:23:03.760]  Very simply you put one pad on each foot before that time and go to sleep, and when
[3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:07.400]  you wake up the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[3:23:07.400 --> 3:23:10.360]  You peel them off and throw them away, it's that simple.
[3:23:10.360 --> 3:23:13.040]  Call 908-691-2608.
[3:23:13.040 --> 3:23:17.560]  We encourage our customers to detox in as many ways as possible to bring the body back
[3:23:17.560 --> 3:23:18.560]  to a balance.
[3:23:18.560 --> 3:23:21.760]  The average person is exposed to hundreds of chemicals daily.
[3:23:21.760 --> 3:23:24.760]  This is one of the many powerful ways to detox the body.
[3:23:24.760 --> 3:23:29.720]  We recommend you try our detoxer foot pads and see and feel the difference for yourself.
[3:23:29.720 --> 3:23:33.560]  Call today at 1-908-691-2608.
[3:23:33.560 --> 3:23:38.160]  Our detoxer foot pads are vegan and environmentally friendly and do not contain chitosan.
[3:23:38.160 --> 3:24:07.120]  Call today, World Products Now, at 1-908-691-2608.
[3:24:08.320 --> 3:24:09.320]  We're back.
[3:24:09.320 --> 3:24:11.800]  Let me tell you folks, it's the Alex Jones show.
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:14.480]  There's no other show like it on radio.
[3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:19.000]  We've got Justin Martel, a student scholar for 9-11 Truth with us throughout this segment,
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:24.280]  and then in a few minutes we're going to have an actual eyewitness to this We Are Change
[3:24:24.280 --> 3:24:25.280]  thing.
[3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:31.640]  And I got to tell you, I don't think that she saw Gary hit a crippled girl with cerebral
[3:24:31.640 --> 3:24:35.240]  palsy in a wheelchair, although that's what they're reporting.
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:39.520]  They're reporting that these guys were screaming obscenities, aka cursing and hurting these
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:40.520]  people.
[3:24:40.520 --> 3:24:44.040]  And before I go back to Justin Martel, I just want to comment on what the last caller
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:45.040]  had to say.
[3:24:45.040 --> 3:24:47.680]  Yeah, unfortunately our leaders are into the occult, whether you believe in the occult
[3:24:47.680 --> 3:24:48.680]  or not.
[3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:49.680]  These guys do.
[3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:50.680]  They go to Bohemian Grove.
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:53.880]  They take part in the ritual of the cremation of care.
[3:24:53.880 --> 3:24:55.320]  So it's not up for debate.
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:24:58.960]  I'm not saying the occult works or they're Satan worshipers.
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:04.240]  All I know is that they do join these societies like Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove, and
[3:25:04.240 --> 3:25:05.440]  they seem to be in the occult.
[3:25:05.440 --> 3:25:10.800]  I mean, there's history channel documentaries about how Hitler thought he had occultic powers,
[3:25:10.800 --> 3:25:12.440]  and he would use symbolism.
[3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:13.680]  So that is creepy.
[3:25:13.680 --> 3:25:17.240]  And then as far as his other question about that other documentary, and he's talking about
[3:25:17.240 --> 3:25:22.080]  the Pentagon, I would assume he's probably talking about the part where people are actually
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:27.080]  picking up these small pieces of debris for the FBI, and we do include that in Loose Change
[3:25:27.080 --> 3:25:28.240]  Final Cut.
[3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:31.960]  If I'm not answering your question, Mark, I do a little show on GCN as well.
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:34.320]  You can check me out at stream 4.
[3:25:34.320 --> 3:25:39.640]  I believe it is 7 to 9 central time, or it might be 6 to 8 central time.
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:40.640]  I'm not sure.
[3:25:40.640 --> 3:25:46.360]  I just moved into the slot over at GCNlive.com, so you can check me out there.
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:50.360]  Justin, where can people get tickets to this symposium?
[3:25:50.360 --> 3:25:56.880]  People can go to sst911.org, and there's information right up on the front page there.
[3:25:56.880 --> 3:26:00.000]  You just click that, and that'll bring you to the event section.
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:04.240]  And there's write-up and bio of all our guests.
[3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:08.240]  There's a flyer that you can download for people in the New England area.
[3:26:08.240 --> 3:26:11.200]  We could definitely use your help if you want to download that flyer printed out.
[3:26:11.200 --> 3:26:14.400]  You know, post it up around town, and there's information there.
[3:26:14.400 --> 3:26:21.400]  You can send me an email or give me a call, and we can talk about there is pre-registration
[3:26:21.400 --> 3:26:25.400]  available for the conference, and you can, of course, buy tickets at the door.
[3:26:25.400 --> 3:26:27.680]  And folks, I got to encourage you to come out to this event.
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:31.080]  These are some of my favorite people in the 9-11 Truth movement.
[3:26:31.080 --> 3:26:32.280]  They are the hard workers.
[3:26:32.280 --> 3:26:34.880]  They are the ones that confronted Barack Obama.
[3:26:34.880 --> 3:26:39.680]  They are the ones that got Ron Paul to say that he would commit to a new 9-11 investigation,
[3:26:39.680 --> 3:26:41.040]  an independent one.
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:45.520]  They are the ones that are on the streets and really doing it up.
[3:26:45.520 --> 3:26:48.600]  And you know, I don't think the organization is big enough, quite frankly.
[3:26:48.600 --> 3:26:51.720]  If you are in college and you're a member of We Are Changed, but you're not a student
[3:26:51.720 --> 3:26:54.280]  scholar for 9-11 Truth, consider joining.
[3:26:54.280 --> 3:26:55.280]  I'm begging you.
[3:26:55.280 --> 3:26:57.440]  You need to join this organization.
[3:26:57.440 --> 3:26:59.120]  These guys are top-notch individuals.
[3:26:59.120 --> 3:27:00.280]  They're stand-up guys.
[3:27:00.280 --> 3:27:01.720]  They're smart.
[3:27:01.720 --> 3:27:02.720]  And they're funny, too.
[3:27:02.720 --> 3:27:06.000]  You know, they've got a whole other thing going on other than 9-11 Truth, although that
[3:27:06.000 --> 3:27:07.600]  is the focus.
[3:27:07.600 --> 3:27:12.240]  And Justin Martell is really just one of the nicest human beings I've come across in this
[3:27:12.240 --> 3:27:15.200]  movement, and I consider him a really good friend.
[3:27:15.200 --> 3:27:20.560]  Justin, what's your take on the New York Post now reporting that, you know, We Are Change
[3:27:20.560 --> 3:27:22.440]  is assaulting people in wheelchairs?
[3:27:22.440 --> 3:27:29.240]  Oh, God, I mean, yeah, I was just really just reading about this in journalism class,
[3:27:29.240 --> 3:27:33.600]  while I was supposed to be paying attention, but I was looking this over.
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:41.400]  And I mean, I just wish them, like, what would be the motivation to beat up a girl in a wheelchair?
[3:27:41.400 --> 3:27:48.680]  To me, the way it sounded, it sounds like the family of this girl in the wheelchair,
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:55.120]  they were supporters of President Bush, and I think it sounded like the dad got agitated
[3:27:55.120 --> 3:28:00.640]  and started to beat up on Gary, is what it sounds like to me, and probably later used
[3:28:00.640 --> 3:28:04.200]  as an excuse, you know, he was hitting my daughter in the wheelchair to get out of it
[3:28:04.200 --> 3:28:05.440]  and avoid charges.
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:11.120]  Yeah, it's pretty incredible, and I'm reading her deposition here to the police, and it
[3:28:11.120 --> 3:28:17.320]  doesn't say anything about, you know, Gary punching anybody.
[3:28:17.320 --> 3:28:22.760]  And again, it actually says that he was being punched, I believe, I mean, we're gonna have
[3:28:22.760 --> 3:28:28.720]  her on in only moments, Justin, but you know, it's gonna be a smear job in the media, it's
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:32.920]  gonna be a talking point for a couple of days, and I doubt there's ever gonna be a retraction,
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:36.160]  and this is how they like to handle the 9-11 truth movement.
[3:28:36.160 --> 3:28:38.920]  They like to lie about us, they like to distort the truth.
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:43.560]  I mean, you saw, did you see what happened to those guys over at the U.K. change?
[3:28:43.560 --> 3:28:51.920]  Yes, yes, the guy tripped over, he tried to take the camera and then tripped and fell,
[3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:54.920]  and they said, U.K. change, push them over.
[3:28:54.920 --> 3:28:59.960]  Absolutely, they are out there with the camera, they are being the new media, which I encourage,
[3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:01.320]  we have to be the new media.
[3:29:01.320 --> 3:29:06.400]  We can't rely on CBS, NBC, BBC, CBC, all these C networks.
[3:29:06.400 --> 3:29:09.320]  We need to become the media, and what happens, they're demonized.
[3:29:09.320 --> 3:29:15.760]  This is T911.org is the website, the event takes place May 17th, hey, no problem, I hope
[3:29:15.760 --> 3:29:21.560]  you do my Sunday show soon, and we're gonna be back with Diane Lipson right after this,
[3:29:21.560 --> 3:29:35.080]  it's the Alex Jones show.
[3:29:35.080 --> 3:29:39.080]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[3:29:39.080 --> 3:29:46.360]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:46.360 --> 3:29:49.760]  I'm Harold Williams, I know about martial law.
[3:29:49.760 --> 3:29:55.320]  I want to teach you how to survive it, America has 10 telling signs of martial law, so use
[3:29:55.320 --> 3:30:00.960]  the short time left to learn to protect your family with the vital information in this book.
[3:30:00.960 --> 3:30:05.760]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com, I will tell you what you need to know to prepare
[3:30:05.760 --> 3:30:08.600]  for martial law, things are changing fast.
[3:30:08.600 --> 3:30:13.800]  We email you a free weekly update, I teach you how to act around troops, where to put

[3:31:54.160 --> 3:31:58.200]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained and utilized
[3:31:58.200 --> 3:32:03.680]  than if heated, the champion juicer is the best way to get your nutrients or body craves.

[3:32:17.320 --> 3:32:22.480]  but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable life-threatening diseases.
[3:32:22.480 --> 3:32:27.400]  Juicing with the champion juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.

[3:33:41.680 --> 3:33:43.680]  We need to stand up for our rights.
[3:33:43.680 --> 3:33:45.680]  We need to get out in the street.
[3:33:45.680 --> 3:33:48.680]  We need to do what Gary did from We Are Changed.
[3:33:48.680 --> 3:33:54.440]  If you're going to get your face bruised up, your lips split and then get charged with
[3:33:54.440 --> 3:33:59.360]  assaulting a crippled girl with cerebral palsy because that's what they're charging with.
[3:33:59.360 --> 3:34:04.280]  Not only in a court of law but in the court of public opinion by publishing this garbage
[3:34:04.280 --> 3:34:09.320]  in the New York Post and before we go to Diane Lipson who was there and can tell us what
[3:34:09.320 --> 3:34:12.920]  she saw and believe me, I just read her email.
[3:34:12.920 --> 3:34:16.640]  The police apparently refused to take her testimony even though she went down to the
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:17.640]  station.
[3:34:17.640 --> 3:34:20.400]  I want to plug MurrayandRon.com.
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:24.160]  This is about a U.S. Senate race and there's going to be a rally in New York City on April
[3:34:24.160 --> 3:34:25.160]  28th.
[3:34:25.160 --> 3:34:26.160]  That's MurrayandRon.com.
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:27.720]  You can go check it out there.
[3:34:27.720 --> 3:34:31.720]  I think they're giving away two free trips to New York City with your donation.
[3:34:31.720 --> 3:34:34.160]  They're going to have some kind of a raffle or whatever.
[3:34:34.160 --> 3:34:38.720]  But a very good organization, go check that out over at MurrayandRon.com.
[3:34:38.720 --> 3:34:40.720]  We're going to take your calls also.
[3:34:40.720 --> 3:34:44.280]  But I do want to talk to Diane and we're going to have Gary in overdrive.
[3:34:44.280 --> 3:34:45.920]  But Diane, are you with us?
[3:34:45.920 --> 3:34:47.840]  Yes, I am.
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:48.840]  Well you were there, Diane.
[3:34:48.840 --> 3:34:51.840]  Why don't you describe the night and then what happened?
[3:34:51.840 --> 3:34:54.840]  Well, okay.
[3:34:54.840 --> 3:34:59.840]  A secret service person had a stand in an area that was, you know, I guess several yards
[3:34:59.840 --> 3:35:03.960]  away from where the bushes were going to get into awaiting them.
[3:35:03.960 --> 3:35:10.400]  There were some or few words between Gary and the agent and there was a little knot
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:15.960]  of people waiting to, there was a little knot of people waiting to, you know, see the bush
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:19.640]  women, you know, get escorted into the van.
[3:35:19.640 --> 3:35:23.600]  And Gary was, you know, he was talking and he was exercising his right of free speech.
[3:35:23.600 --> 3:35:27.480]  I don't exactly remember what he was saying to them, but people in the crowd were kind
[3:35:27.480 --> 3:35:28.480]  of possible for him.
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:31.320]  This is the Upper East Side of New York.
[3:35:31.320 --> 3:35:34.000]  It's kind of a wealthy liberal area.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:38.240]  Not exactly people who were like, you know, in tune with our message.
[3:35:38.240 --> 3:35:42.760]  So there was a man in a blue jacket.
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:47.680]  He was with his wife and I guess I think it was two daughters, but one daughter was in
[3:35:47.680 --> 3:35:51.880]  wheelchair and he was taking particular exceptions to what Gary was saying.
[3:35:51.880 --> 3:35:55.320]  And at one point he even made a threatening gesture to Gary.
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:36:00.360]  He caught his fist at Gary and he had this weird thick cap smile on his face and I had
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:04.040]  like a big moment of cognitive dissonance because I'm wondering, why is this man acting
[3:36:04.040 --> 3:36:07.040]  like this with his family right there?
[3:36:07.040 --> 3:36:08.040]  Okay.
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:13.680]  So the bush women get into the van, Gary shouts at them about 9-11 and he had to shout because
[3:36:13.680 --> 3:36:14.680]  they were far away.
[3:36:14.680 --> 3:36:20.560]  Then we're all walking away and I see the man, I'm pretty, yeah, I think he was wheeling
[3:36:20.560 --> 3:36:21.560]  the chair.
[3:36:21.560 --> 3:36:22.560]  Right?
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:24.200]  I see everybody's walking up the street.
[3:36:24.200 --> 3:36:28.760]  It's like a little bit of an incline, but instead of walking straight up the block,
[3:36:28.760 --> 3:36:36.240]  the man seems into the side of the building where Gary was and then I hear him say, you
[3:36:36.240 --> 3:36:43.240]  know, Gary touched his border and then I see him beating up on Gary and I did not, if Gary
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:45.040]  thought back, I didn't see it.
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:36:49.120]  He's beating Gary up, I'm trying to get my still camera out, I wasn't able to, I'm trying
[3:36:49.120 --> 3:36:55.320]  to pull the guy off and this woman is telling the man to stop, the wife was telling the
[3:36:55.320 --> 3:37:02.600]  man to stop and of course, looking back, if what she said in the New York Post article
[3:37:02.600 --> 3:37:09.480]  if Gary had really done anything to this woman's daughter, why would she be telling
[3:37:09.480 --> 3:37:13.840]  this man to back off, why would she be telling him to stop, you know?
[3:37:13.840 --> 3:37:17.760]  Yeah, if he had actually physically threatened that girl in the wheelchair, there's no way
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:20.440]  that she would stop her husband from defending it.
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:21.440]  Exactly.
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:25.400]  And first and also, there's no way that Gary would do anything like that, the whole reason
[3:37:25.400 --> 3:37:30.360]  that Gary is in this movement is to protect people and to protect women and to protect
[3:37:30.360 --> 3:37:31.360]  families.
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:36.000]  Gary's kind of an old fashioned guy and I know his instinct is to protect women and
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:41.280]  children, that's the kind of a person he is, so it's ludicrous to suggest that he would
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:45.760]  ever, ever assault a woman, much less a handicap woman.
[3:37:45.760 --> 3:37:50.000]  And let's just make it clear, he wasn't shouting any obscenities, he was shouting 9-11 Truth.
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:56.200]  I did not hear any obscenities, no, there was no obscenities, there was no obscenities
[3:37:56.200 --> 3:38:00.240]  and nothing that was threatening, it was just 9-11 Truth.
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:03.720]  So they take him down to the station and you go down to the station and you say the man
[3:38:03.720 --> 3:38:07.440]  that assaulted him is sitting there, they take a couple pictures of him, yeah and he
[3:38:07.440 --> 3:38:08.440]  gets the lead.
[3:38:08.440 --> 3:38:15.360]  They took some photos of him, they took some photos of him, my sense was that they were
[3:38:15.360 --> 3:38:20.120]  sympathetic toward this man who assaulted Gary, I can't be sure about that, but that
[3:38:20.120 --> 3:38:23.400]  was kind of my sense.
[3:38:23.400 --> 3:38:30.400]  And it seemed like, somehow it seemed like perhaps there was a mindset there that Gary
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:35.080]  must be a bad person or something, you know it's very easy for people to blow something
[3:38:35.080 --> 3:38:38.080]  like this up and to convince them something.
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:39.080]  Gotcha.
[3:38:39.080 --> 3:38:46.280]  Now the man was there, I said that I wanted to make a statement, they told me to wait
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:50.600]  two hours later, they told me not to make a statement that it was no point or something
[3:38:50.600 --> 3:38:51.600]  like that.
[3:38:51.600 --> 3:38:54.800]  I'm still not sure why I didn't get to make a statement, but I came home and of course
[3:38:54.800 --> 3:39:00.960]  I typed up, you know I typed up what I saw and sent it to Tykes.
[3:39:00.960 --> 3:39:05.720]  So you typed it up here and it is very exquisite, we're going to be putting this on Infowars.com
[3:39:05.720 --> 3:39:09.680]  now, of course the audio is going to be making it there too, but let's just be clear, he
[3:39:09.680 --> 3:39:14.440]  was never physically intimidating towards anybody, not only this guy or his daughter,
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:19.480]  but towards the Bush family in general, he never cursed, he was exercising his freedom
[3:39:19.480 --> 3:39:22.840]  of speech which we no longer have in this country, they want to put you in a quote
[3:39:22.840 --> 3:39:29.360]  unquote free speech zone and even when he's in that zone, he gets assaulted and then arrested.
[3:39:29.360 --> 3:39:36.120]  He gets assaulted and then arrested, yes, exactly, I'm very frightened for Gary because
[3:39:36.120 --> 3:39:45.160]  Gary, he's a young man and because this person could not control his temper, he might be
[3:39:45.160 --> 3:39:46.400]  ruining Gary's life.
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:51.520]  I think we have to pray for Gary, in addition to assisting him in other ways, we have to
[3:39:51.520 --> 3:39:55.320]  really pray for Gary and pray for that sick guy who assaulted him too because this guy
[3:39:55.320 --> 3:39:57.440]  obviously has problems.
[3:39:57.440 --> 3:40:03.920]  Let's try to wake this guy up, I want to say this, his wife and his name are in the paper,
[3:40:03.920 --> 3:40:08.240]  if you can find this man's address, people need to start mailing this guy, loose change
[3:40:08.240 --> 3:40:13.880]  final cut, they need to start mailing him Terror Storm, they need to know why Gary was
[3:40:13.880 --> 3:40:17.840]  there in the first place and God willing, maybe this guy is going to retract what he's
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:23.680]  done, apologize for assaulting another human being and drop the ludicrous charges that
[3:40:23.680 --> 3:40:26.960]  he assaulted his daughter in a wheelchair.
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:30.760]  My stomach has just turned, if you haven't seen this New York Post article yet, it also
[3:40:30.760 --> 3:40:36.320]  has four pictures of this young lady and one picture of course is with Laura Bush, another
[3:40:36.320 --> 3:40:41.320]  is her holding up the book that Laura and Jenna have written proudly and another is
[3:40:41.320 --> 3:40:45.640]  her and her mother and nobody wants to see any harm come to this young girl, don't get
[3:40:45.640 --> 3:40:52.040]  me wrong, but the way the New York Post is using this propaganda to demonize somebody
[3:40:52.040 --> 3:40:55.960]  who did nothing but get assaulted is disgusting to me.
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:41:00.120]  Also, it's on the Michelle Malkin has written about this now, she picked up the whole New
[3:41:00.120 --> 3:41:01.120]  York Post article.
[3:41:01.120 --> 3:41:04.280]  Oh yeah, it's going to be on Hot Air Blog, I'm telling you, I'm telling people right
[3:41:04.280 --> 3:41:08.800]  now, it's going to be all over O'Reilly, it's going to be all over Hannity and they love
[3:41:08.800 --> 3:41:11.600]  this, they want to demonize us as a violent group.
[3:41:11.600 --> 3:41:16.000]  Yes, they want people to believe that Gary would actually do something that he would
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:17.640]  never, never do.
[3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:21.920]  Diane, I thank you so much for the call, I'm sure Alex Jones is going to be in touch
[3:41:21.920 --> 3:41:24.920]  with you and he's probably going to have you as a guest tomorrow so you can describe
[3:41:24.920 --> 3:41:25.920]  all this.
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:28.560]  I'm going to let you go and I'm going to take some phone calls and then we're going
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:31.760]  to have Gary in overdrive so he can tell us everything.
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:35.560]  Diane, thank you again and thanks for trying to make a statement to these jackboot cops
[3:41:35.560 --> 3:41:36.800]  who just wouldn't hear it.
[3:41:36.800 --> 3:41:39.480]  Quite all right, I'm very happy to help Gary.
[3:41:39.480 --> 3:41:40.960]  All right, thank you so much.
[3:41:40.960 --> 3:41:45.000]  All right guys, in the time we got left before we go to Gary, we're going to shoot through
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  some phone calls.
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:47.880]  Let's go to Ken in Maryland.
[3:41:47.880 --> 3:41:49.120]  Ken, are you with us?
[3:41:49.120 --> 3:41:50.120]  Hey, hey, Gagson.
[3:41:50.120 --> 3:41:52.120]  Hey man, how you doing?
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:58.440]  I'm blessed, I want to go off subject just for a moment, I just want to let you guys
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:05.440]  know that there is going to be a Ron Paul campaign conference call tonight.
[3:42:05.440 --> 3:42:06.440]  Can I give the number?
[3:42:06.440 --> 3:42:07.440]  Of course, go ahead.
[3:42:07.440 --> 3:42:22.080]  Okay, it's 6-0-5, 4-7-5, 8-5-0-0 and the access code is 5-0-9, 2-9-8-4 and that's
[3:42:22.080 --> 3:42:24.320]  it, 9 p.m. tonight.
[3:42:24.320 --> 3:42:26.800]  What 9 p.m., what time, central time?
[3:42:26.800 --> 3:42:28.800]  No, eastern.
[3:42:28.800 --> 3:42:29.800]  Eastern time?
[3:42:29.800 --> 3:42:30.800]  All right, anything else you want to bring up, Ken?
[3:42:30.800 --> 3:42:35.800]  No, I just keep fighting the fight guys, the truth will prevail, truth is truth.
[3:42:35.800 --> 3:42:36.800]  All right, thanks Ken.
[3:42:36.800 --> 3:42:39.000]  We're going to jump to Josh in North Carolina.
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:41.080]  Josh, are you with us?
[3:42:41.080 --> 3:42:42.080]  Hello.
[3:42:42.080 --> 3:42:44.520]  How's everybody doing?
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:45.520]  Cool.
[3:42:45.520 --> 3:42:49.520]  I'm not doing so great, finding out that they're framing up We Are Change for assaulting young
[3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:51.440]  girls in wheelchairs with cerebral palsy.
[3:42:51.440 --> 3:42:53.560]  I'm pretty upset about the whole thing.
[3:42:53.560 --> 3:42:56.360]  Yeah, I'm pretty perturbed myself.
[3:42:56.360 --> 3:43:02.200]  I had something I wanted to say about the whole Pentagon 9-11 thing, but I mean, this
[3:43:02.200 --> 3:43:03.600]  is just amazing.
[3:43:03.600 --> 3:43:13.520]  I mean, I'm infuriated by the idea that they're framing us like that, that's, yeah, ridiculous.
[3:43:13.520 --> 3:43:17.960]  But let me just bring this up about the Pentagon because I was actually going to bring this
[3:43:17.960 --> 3:43:18.960]  up before that.
[3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:19.960]  Okay.
[3:43:19.960 --> 3:43:28.720]  So, it is of my understanding that the DC no-fly zone is protected by automated missile batteries
[3:43:28.720 --> 3:43:38.560]  that were approved under IC and then put into place under LBJ and Nixon and worked on and
[3:43:38.560 --> 3:43:40.280]  updated under Reagan.
[3:43:40.280 --> 3:43:46.960]  Now, these systems are supposed to automatically fire on any jet that flies into the no-fly
[3:43:46.960 --> 3:43:53.800]  zone and the fail safes on them from what I understand are, you know, autonomous.
[3:43:53.800 --> 3:43:55.760]  In other words, no one can shut them down.
[3:43:55.760 --> 3:44:01.680]  So, in the event of a war, you know, something happens that nothing can fly in and basically
[3:44:01.680 --> 3:44:04.400]  do what supposedly happened on 9-11.
[3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:09.320]  The only thing they can go into the no-fly zone is something with a military transponder
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:10.320]  on it.
[3:44:10.320 --> 3:44:11.320]  And yeah.
[3:44:11.320 --> 3:44:15.240]  Well, I mean, I got to take your point.
[3:44:15.240 --> 3:44:17.440]  I mean, that's the word on the street.
[3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:23.040]  I am baffled by that as well, but I think the mystery may be solved in the fact that
[3:44:23.040 --> 3:44:28.640]  Scott Fry signs that memo prior to 9-11, and I mean, just a couple months prior, putting
[3:44:28.640 --> 3:44:33.600]  shoot-down orders in the hands of Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and George Bush solely.
[3:44:33.600 --> 3:44:38.360]  So, colonels and other commanders that would have been able to take out an aircraft just
[3:44:38.360 --> 3:44:42.120]  like you said with no problem, they took that away.
[3:44:42.120 --> 3:44:43.120]  Exactly.
[3:44:43.120 --> 3:44:48.480]  Well, one of two things probably happened either they signed the order to somehow take
[3:44:48.480 --> 3:44:54.520]  that system offline or would hit the Pentagon because it was probably a predator drone.
[3:44:54.520 --> 3:44:56.040]  Look at the size of the hole.
[3:44:56.040 --> 3:44:57.680]  Look at the size of the engine.
[3:44:57.680 --> 3:45:00.160]  They kind of match a predator drone.
[3:45:00.160 --> 3:45:01.400]  It is a possibility.
[3:45:01.400 --> 3:45:02.760]  It is a possibility, man.
[3:45:02.760 --> 3:45:05.960]  Listen, Scott, I got to jump because I actually have Gary on the line.
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:06.960]  Thanks for the call.
[3:45:06.960 --> 3:45:08.560]  I'm sorry, Josh, I got to jump on.
[3:45:08.560 --> 3:45:09.560]  I'm such an idiot.
[3:45:09.560 --> 3:45:12.440]  But we're going to go to Gary because I've got to talk about this story.
[3:45:12.440 --> 3:45:13.440]  You might go into overdrive.
[3:45:13.440 --> 3:45:14.440]  I'm not quite sure.
[3:45:14.440 --> 3:45:15.440]  Gary, are you with me?
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:16.440]  Yes.
[3:45:16.440 --> 3:45:17.440]  I'm with you.
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:18.440]  All right, man.
[3:45:18.440 --> 3:45:20.920]  Well, you know, I've seen the video that you guys put out where you're talking to the
[3:45:20.920 --> 3:45:22.280]  Secret Service agent.
[3:45:22.280 --> 3:45:23.440]  You never raise your hands.
[3:45:23.440 --> 3:45:26.480]  You talk to him in a respectful manner.
[3:45:26.480 --> 3:45:31.360]  And we don't have video of the actual incident, but let's just clear it up right now.
[3:45:31.360 --> 3:45:34.160]  Did you hit a girl in a wheelchair?
[3:45:34.160 --> 3:45:35.160]  That is very funny.
[3:45:35.160 --> 3:45:36.160]  I couldn't believe that.
[3:45:36.160 --> 3:45:39.760]  I mean, I couldn't believe it is the post.
[3:45:39.760 --> 3:45:43.760]  You know, it's very strange what the person did.
[3:45:43.760 --> 3:45:49.480]  He actually used, I believe it was his daughter, he used as a weapon and a shield at the same
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:50.480]  time.
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:52.680]  It was actually very shocking.
[3:45:52.680 --> 3:45:54.800]  The girl was crying.
[3:45:54.800 --> 3:45:58.640]  I was trying to walk away from the incident because it was getting pretty violent.
[3:45:58.640 --> 3:46:07.040]  As soon as I tried to walk away, this gentleman just runs, rams me my kneecap and starts screaming
[3:46:07.040 --> 3:46:11.120]  in the soul, he hit my daughter at the same time, I'm, you know, trying to keep my balance
[3:46:11.120 --> 3:46:12.520]  because I don't even know what's going on.
[3:46:12.520 --> 3:46:18.760]  I see a left and a right, you know, swinging at me is 500 pounds, you know, six for something
[3:46:18.760 --> 3:46:22.840]  guy trying to attack me.
[3:46:22.840 --> 3:46:26.560]  The next thing I know, you know, I'm being swung around the police came and handcuffed
[3:46:26.560 --> 3:46:31.080]  me with my left and right, swinging me around, trying to get handcuffs on me actually kind
[3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:34.000]  of looked like they were trying to like abuse me.
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  They were really angry.
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:39.400]  Because they heard that I hit a, hit somebody in a wheelchair after the man was beaten.
[3:46:39.400 --> 3:46:45.840]  That was actually the only way that he could have basically, you know, framed me because
[3:46:45.840 --> 3:46:50.920]  he was pretty smart in doing so and it seemed pretty coordinated to me.
[3:46:50.920 --> 3:46:52.320]  And let me get this straight.
[3:46:52.320 --> 3:46:54.720]  This guy's like a much bigger guy than you.
[3:46:54.720 --> 3:46:56.240]  Yeah, he's much bigger.
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:46:59.360]  He was like, you know, 400 something pounds.
[3:46:59.360 --> 3:47:02.240]  Yeah, because, you know, again, I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you're not a very
[3:47:02.240 --> 3:47:07.240]  physically intimidating guy. I mean, you're a skinny young guy who, again, you didn't
[3:47:07.240 --> 3:47:08.560]  scream any obscenities. Did you?
[3:47:08.560 --> 3:47:11.760]  I mean, you were talking about 9-11 in the Bush crime scene.
[3:47:11.760 --> 3:47:16.280]  Well, yeah, I was actually intellectually screaming out my statement. I mean, what did
[3:47:16.280 --> 3:47:17.280]  he want me to do?
[3:47:17.280 --> 3:47:20.920]  They were saying I was tackling, but I can't really whisper to somebody 20 feet away.
[3:47:20.920 --> 3:47:23.000]  They were keeping me away from us.
[3:47:23.000 --> 3:47:25.360]  I don't see that as tackling.
[3:47:25.360 --> 3:47:28.840]  Yeah. Well, they're saying that you used obscenities and I just want to clear that
[3:47:28.840 --> 3:47:30.840]  point up right now as well.
[3:47:30.840 --> 3:47:33.640]  You didn't scream any curse words, did you?
[3:47:33.640 --> 3:47:37.600]  Of course not. I mean, this is the post. They had an article about it. They put my picture
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:43.240]  up there a couple of months ago. They said that we had a sign that says, do something
[3:47:43.240 --> 3:47:46.720]  because the government won't. But if I would say that 50,000 is taken down, that's what
[3:47:46.720 --> 3:47:53.440]  it says on the sign. I mean, if they're going to take off the meaning of our sign and say,
[3:47:53.440 --> 3:47:57.320]  we disrespect the victim's family when the sign is about the victim's family, then,
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:48:00.560]  you know, you could expect anything from these morons.
[3:48:00.560 --> 3:48:05.080]  Absolutely. It's very scary. And I, you know, I honestly believe that you should sue for
[3:48:05.080 --> 3:48:09.320]  libel for this because this is going to be on Michelle. It's already on Michelle Malcolm's
[3:48:09.320 --> 3:48:13.400]  site, but it's going to be, it's going to be a talking point on a radio program. Okay.
[3:48:13.400 --> 3:48:17.600]  And you can bet that later today on Fox News, you're going to see this on Hannity. You're
[3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:20.760]  going to see it on O'Reilly. You're going to see it in the mainstream media. You might
[3:48:20.760 --> 3:48:27.720]  even see it on MSNBC and CNN folks, the supposed good media outlets. Listen, Fox is over the
[3:48:27.720 --> 3:48:32.000]  top, no doubt, but those other guys ain't your friends either. Okay. They're just as
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:36.840]  culpable. They're just as guilty and they're going to propagate this story about a 9-11
[3:48:36.840 --> 3:48:43.160]  truth activist who believes in nonviolent, peaceful protest, exercises his first amendment.
[3:48:43.160 --> 3:48:48.040]  He gets assaulted. He gets charged. They won't even hear eyewitness testimony. I mean, I'm
[3:48:48.040 --> 3:48:51.320]  sure you just heard Diane on the phone. You know, she went down to the police station
[3:48:51.320 --> 3:48:56.120]  and waited for it two hours to give a statement and they wouldn't allow it. And this guy doesn't
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:00.360]  get handcuffed. He doesn't get printed. He gets his picture taken and he walks away and
[3:49:00.360 --> 3:49:05.080]  he comes off like some kind of hero in this post article. I'm disgusted, man. I'm sick
[3:49:05.080 --> 3:49:06.080]  to my stomach.
[3:49:06.080 --> 3:49:12.400]  Well, that's just, you know, it's just kind of a symbolism. It all goes on. It's always
[3:49:12.400 --> 3:49:18.200]  awarded, you know, heroes. And this is a fan of big Cheney and the Bush crime syndicate.
[3:49:18.200 --> 3:49:22.400]  And you could have, you know, there's nothing else you could expect from him. There's not
[3:49:22.400 --> 3:49:27.880]  a one. Again, you know, basically a character has a name, but he does have a, uh, a sheep
[3:49:27.880 --> 3:49:32.920]  alike mind. It's no more smarter than, um, I believe a child.
[3:49:32.920 --> 3:49:37.120]  Yeah. Now, now when did they finally release you? Because as I knew yesterday, you were
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:38.120]  still incarcerated.
[3:49:38.120 --> 3:49:44.960]  Yeah. Yes. They released me, um, yesterday around like, uh, 8 p.m. I was stuck, um,
[3:49:44.960 --> 3:49:49.720]  central bookings for like around 12 hours educating the people there about the new world
[3:49:49.720 --> 3:49:50.720]  order.
[3:49:50.720 --> 3:49:55.120]  Um, you know, and what, and what are the charges, Gary? What did, what did they form a charge
[3:49:55.120 --> 3:49:56.120]  you with?
[3:49:56.120 --> 3:50:01.800]  The charges, the charges basically is, uh, assault in a third degree, uh, assault on
[3:50:01.800 --> 3:50:06.480]  the person on, on, on, on the, on the man that they said had a split lip. I don't know
[3:50:06.480 --> 3:50:12.680]  how he had the split lip because, um, basically, I didn't even have time to even defend myself
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:15.840]  because police and service was on me so fast.
[3:50:15.840 --> 3:50:19.880]  All right, Gary, Gary, we're going to come back. We got one more segment. I guess we're
[3:50:19.880 --> 3:50:23.560]  not going to have to do overdrive with you. We're going to do one more segment with you,

[3:54:40.800 --> 3:54:44.840]  charged with assault. He's beaten up and not only charged with assault but charged with
[3:54:44.840 --> 3:54:50.960]  assault on a crippled girl with cerebral palsy. It's a very sad state in this country when
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:56.400]  the mainstream media will continue to propagate these lies and try to demonize this movement.
[3:54:56.400 --> 3:55:01.280]  This movement is trying to save America. It's trying to save the republic. We want our constitution

[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:24.560]  and you know criminal elements and as soon as I you know stated my opinion. Some people
[3:55:24.560 --> 3:55:30.040]  in the crowd didn't like what I was saying and one man actually uses the handcapped order
[3:55:30.040 --> 3:55:37.560]  as an opportunity to me you know trouble and basically the way he did. He started off by
[3:55:37.560 --> 3:55:42.520]  putting a sting in my face. I knew China provoked me at a smile in the face and now I'm a little
[3:55:42.520 --> 3:55:48.520]  smarter and you know I'm active in my emotions. I try to get a police officer. I try to state
[3:55:48.520 --> 3:55:52.280]  that there was an assault but nobody wanted to listen to me. As soon as I walked a little
[3:55:52.280 --> 3:55:57.800]  away from him you know I feel something ramming me in my kneecap. I'm trying to you know gain
[3:55:57.800 --> 3:56:02.720]  my balance and there he goes swinging at me left and right and he proceeds to try to choke
[3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:09.760]  me you know. I get him off of me so I try to get him off of me. I didn't even you know
[3:56:09.760 --> 3:56:16.800]  I didn't even really compare the whole situation you know like it happened so fast. I was before
[3:56:16.800 --> 3:56:22.040]  I know it's secret service then what PD just started swinging me to the left of all the
[3:56:22.040 --> 3:56:29.200]  right wall. You know they slam my face just like they slam Matt the basic face. They slam
[3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:35.920]  mine against the wall and twist the mom and put my put the handcuffs on it very very tight
[3:56:35.920 --> 3:56:41.320]  when it's five hundred pound and basically you know you know just like it was like always
[3:56:41.320 --> 3:56:46.560]  not even you know questioned or nothing I mean. Well you really need to take legal action
[3:56:46.560 --> 3:56:52.160]  man you need to talk to a lawyer ASAP. There's lawyers out there today and he doesn't get
[3:56:52.160 --> 3:56:56.000]  in touch. You need to get in touch with Info Wars and Alex Jones and we'll try to help
