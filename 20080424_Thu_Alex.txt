[00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:02.051]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:02.051 --> 00:00:03.632]  You want answers?
[00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:05.574]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:09.398]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:13.442]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:18.023]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:18.023 --> 00:00:24.629]  I am not Alex Jones, however it still is Thursday the 24th day of April.
[00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:28.693]  I will be in for the full fourth hour, four hours, I'm sorry.
[00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:30.034]  My name is Jason Bermas.
[00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:37.201]  I am a producer over at Loud of the Words, one of the people that brought you Loose Change, Loose Change Final Cut, and I am honored to
[00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:42.474]  To be sitting in for the man, the myth, the legend, Alex Jones today.
[00:00:42.474 --> 00:00:44.315]  I'm going to have a jam-packed show for you.
[00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.676]  We're going to be taking calls all four hours.
[00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:50.358]  In the first hour, we are going to have Luke Rudowsky of We Are Change.
[00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:54.560]  Luke was on the show yesterday talking about his Arnold Schwarzenegger confrontation.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.641]  We're going to be discussing that.
[00:00:55.641 --> 00:01:06.527]  We're going to be discussing him and the Bush ladies, as well as a John Kerry confrontation that has not been aired on YouTube yet.
[00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.011]  Or really discussed.
[00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:14.674]  I hear that they actually had him sign a Skull and Bones picture or book or something.
[00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:14.934]  I don't know.
[00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:15.575]  It should be interesting.
[00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.656]  We'll get more info from Luke.
[00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:19.777]  In the second hour we're going to have Mark Dice.
[00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:24.780]  We're going to be discussing one of his upcoming projects and really just his website.
[00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.801]  Checking out the Resistance Manifesto.
[00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:31.504]  He's featured prominently in Alex's new 9-11 film that we discussed earlier in the week.
[00:01:32.162 --> 00:01:32.662]  I think so.
[00:01:54.585 --> 00:01:59.609]  I confronted Gary Hart recently and Gary Hart said, Oh, I never used the term New World Order.
[00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:00.790]  You know, it's so funny.
[00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.192]  The New World Order exists.
[00:02:03.192 --> 00:02:09.277]  If you're pro New World Order, if you're for global governance, if you're for the North American Union, these things exist.
[00:02:09.277 --> 00:02:10.278]  They do.
[00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:12.580]  But as soon as you say, Oh, the North American Union's bad.
[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.881]  Oh, that doesn't exist.
[00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:14.982]  The trans Texas corridor.
[00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:16.043]  That's not real.
[00:02:16.043 --> 00:02:17.184]  You know, I can see it.
[00:02:17.184 --> 00:02:19.906]  You can go to Google Maps or Google Earth.
[00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:20.887]  You can zoom in on it.
[00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.400]  You can watch the construction, but apparently it doesn't exist if you're not for it.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.343]  If you don't want to see our goods shipped directly from Mexico through the United States into Canada, further eviscerating our economy.
[00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:38.965]  If you don't want to see that, you know, you have some common sense, the North American Union just isn't real.
[00:02:38.965 --> 00:02:47.269]  You know, apparently NAFTA never passed, apparently CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, never passed in 2004, and I'm just making this stuff up.
[00:02:48.786 --> 00:02:53.747]  Finally, in the fourth hour, we're going to be having the Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth on.
[00:02:53.747 --> 00:03:00.148]  I believe we're going to be having Justin Martel for the full hour, and I don't think they've been on the Alex Jones Show before.
[00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:04.209]  I hope they are on the Alex Jones Show after this, but they're just a bang-up organization.
[00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.309]  They're some good friends of mine.
[00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:13.430]  They're out of Keene, New Hampshire, and these two college students did what any motivated Americans out there can do.
[00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.331]  They got themselves a digital video camera.
[00:03:17.532 --> 00:03:29.821]  And began to use their mass comm major as a tool to get press passes to events and ask tough questions of candidates, especially about 9-11 truth.
[00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:32.422]  The people that they've gotten is unbelievable.
[00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:45.572]  From John McCain, to Barack Obama, to Mike Revelle, to of course the first Ron Paul confrontation about 9-11 where Ron Paul said that he would be for a new independent investigation into 9-11.
[00:03:48.163 --> 00:03:51.426]  And so much more, and they're holding a big event over in May.
[00:03:51.426 --> 00:03:53.648]  I believe it's May 17th.
[00:03:53.648 --> 00:04:02.136]  Not only are we going to have family members, I believe it's Bob McElveen and Donna Marsh O'Connor, which is a bang-up lineup already.
[00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:12.125]  I mean, that's great, but they're also going to have Daniel Sinjada, who's done this program on several occasions, and a host of others that you may not see as much.
[00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:13.186]  Who is this host of others?
[00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:13.426]  Well,
[00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:27.462]  A lot of people still don't know who J. Michael Springman is, and he is the CIA whistleblower who worked in JETA in the late 80s and early 90s and was forced... Well, I guess we're in commercial?
[00:04:27.462 --> 00:04:29.223]  We must be.
[00:04:29.223 --> 00:04:29.583]  I don't know.
[00:04:29.583 --> 00:04:32.846]  Are we in commercial?
[00:04:32.846 --> 00:04:34.187]  Or we must be going to commercial.
[00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:35.248]  Alright, so we're going to commercial.
[00:04:35.248 --> 00:04:37.370]  It's the Alex Jones Show, and we'll be back after this!
[00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:54.715]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:54.715 --> 00:04:57.517]  A New World Order.
[00:04:57.517 --> 00:05:02.201]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.263]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:08.045]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:08.045 --> 00:05:11.227]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:18.553]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:27.005]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:30.887]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:33.449]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:34.630]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.410]  They're not after money.
[00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:36.691]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:36.691 --> 00:05:37.672]  They're after power.
[00:05:37.672 --> 00:05:38.813]  That's what they're after these years.
[00:05:38.813 --> 00:05:43.576]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:05:47.538 --> 00:05:50.340]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.461]  You have been warned.
[00:05:52.322 --> 00:05:54.383]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:05:54.383 --> 00:05:57.686]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:05:57.686 --> 00:06:02.650]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.532]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:06:05.532 --> 00:06:12.378]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:06:12.598 --> 00:06:18.586]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:06:18.586 --> 00:06:20.709]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:24.995]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:06:24.995 --> 00:06:29.581]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong.
[00:06:29.781 --> 00:06:36.404]  That they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[00:06:36.404 --> 00:06:41.707]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:44.969]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:45.469]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.

[00:06:54.685 --> 00:06:58.087]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[00:06:58.087 --> 00:07:02.910]  They get closer and closer, and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.412]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?
[00:07:05.412 --> 00:07:10.095]  Tebowtech specializes in non-lethal self-defense products for you and your family.

[00:07:52.706 --> 00:07:58.109]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:58.109 --> 00:08:00.391]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.970]  Well, we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.611]  I am your guest host today.
[00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:08.692]  My name is Jason Burmiss.
[00:08:08.692 --> 00:08:14.175]  You can check out my stuff over at loosechangethefinalcut.com or loosechange911.com.
[00:08:14.175 --> 00:08:16.896]  I do a little blog-skiing hutch over there.
[00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:23.460]  And we are honored to have on the phone the originator, the creator, the man, the myth, the legend.
[00:08:24.787 --> 00:08:25.888]  Luke Radowski.
[00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:28.351]  And Luke just keeps trucking forward.
[00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:30.254]  He is We Are Change.
[00:08:30.254 --> 00:08:32.336]  He has spread a global movement now.
[00:08:32.336 --> 00:08:42.328]  A global movement from places, you know, in the United Kingdom to places in Japan to, of course, where it all started, New York City.
[00:08:42.328 --> 00:08:43.850]  Luke, an honor to have you on the program.
[00:08:44.577 --> 00:08:45.779]  Thanks for having me on, man.
[00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:04.331]  Folks, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.TV member, it's only 15 cents a day.
[00:09:04.331 --> 00:09:06.893]  You get the full fourth hour in video.
[00:09:06.893 --> 00:09:08.154]  We got the document cam.
[00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:12.037]  We're able to play YouTube clips and other video and feed it right over the internet.
[00:09:12.037 --> 00:09:15.901]  It's an exciting time over at Alex Jones Productions, but Luke.
[00:09:16.542 --> 00:09:21.566]  I mean, in the last week, you've got some of the most prominent people you've confronted them.
[00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:28.952]  People like Schwarzenegger, who's a thug who likes to walk around in Nazi memorabilia with his death's head belt buckle.
[00:09:28.952 --> 00:09:30.573]  Ooh, I got a death's head belt buckle.
[00:09:30.573 --> 00:09:32.094]  Look how tough I am.
[00:09:32.094 --> 00:09:35.197]  To John Kerry, who's a Skull and Bones member.
[00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:36.838]  To the Bushwomen.
[00:09:36.838 --> 00:09:39.320]  Why don't you just discuss, I mean, how busy you are?
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.801]  I mean, literally, you don't get any sleep.
[00:09:42.429 --> 00:10:06.814]  I mean, yesterday I was on the Alex Jones Show and I said, the more people attack us, the more people fight, the more people attack us, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more people fight, the more
[00:10:07.054 --> 00:10:09.115]  We also confronted Katie Couric.
[00:10:09.115 --> 00:10:10.556]  All the videos are going to be coming out soon.
[00:10:10.556 --> 00:10:13.997]  We're doubling our efforts because people are attacking us left and right.
[00:10:13.997 --> 00:10:15.298]  That's what we're about.
[00:10:15.298 --> 00:10:22.721]  And we're going to send a message to the people trying to set us up that every time they attack us, we're going to grow more and more and more.
[00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:23.562]  And that's what it's about.
[00:10:23.562 --> 00:10:24.682]  It's about being defiant.
[00:10:24.682 --> 00:10:25.643]  It's about being brave.
[00:10:26.603 --> 00:10:29.265]  Believe in yourself and do the right thing.
[00:10:29.265 --> 00:10:33.588]  And I'm telling you, within the last two days, I did not get an hour of sleep.
[00:10:33.588 --> 00:10:34.569]  I've been just up.
[00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:35.730]  I've been talking to lawyers.
[00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.671]  I've been going to court.
[00:10:36.671 --> 00:10:38.512]  I've been going to the police precinct.
[00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:39.553]  I've been working videos.
[00:10:39.553 --> 00:10:40.633]  I've been editing videos.
[00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:42.074]  I've been copying videos.
[00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:45.417]  It's just been a crazy last 48 hours.
[00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:48.039]  I've been just busting my butt, just trying to do whatever I can.
[00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:51.762]  And I'm just hoping to inspire as many people as I can to do the right thing.
[00:10:51.762 --> 00:10:52.322]  Get out there.
[00:10:52.322 --> 00:10:52.882]  Get involved.
[00:10:54.352 --> 00:10:55.813]  Be the change you want to see in this world.
[00:10:55.813 --> 00:11:02.559]  I know it sounds generic for me now, because I've been saying it almost a hundred times now, but that's what it's about.
[00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:07.583]  Well, man, you are the quintessential Patriot Renaissance man, in my opinion.
[00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:22.355]  I mean, you go out there, and you get these guys on camera, and you upload this to YouTube, and you have no fear, and you've confronted everyone from Giuliani, which got national press coverage when you confronted him about the fact that, you know, he got a warning that morning.
[00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:28.077]  Okay, he got a warning that morning to get out of the buildings because they were going to come down.
[00:11:28.077 --> 00:11:29.118]  And then he denied that.
[00:11:29.118 --> 00:11:30.220]  Correct, Luke?
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.101]  Yeah, he definitely did.
[00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:35.466]  This was when Sabrina Rivera came up to Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:11:35.466 --> 00:11:37.189]  This was actually during his birthday.
[00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:43.633]  Uh, Giuliani's birthday and shook his hand and asked him, how come you knew the towers were going to collapse?
[00:11:43.633 --> 00:11:48.075]  How come you said to Peter Jennings, I'm not 11, that the towers were going to collapse?
[00:11:48.075 --> 00:11:52.017]  And how come the firefighters and the police officers inside that building never got that warning?
[00:11:52.017 --> 00:11:54.598]  And Giuliani lied, knownly lied.
[00:11:54.598 --> 00:11:57.219]  He said about three, four times, I never said nothing like that.
[00:11:57.219 --> 00:11:59.300]  And then we played the video of him saying that.
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.961]  And, you know, we have Gary Hart lying to We Are Change Colorado.
[00:12:03.961 --> 00:12:06.062]  I mean, these politicians are just liars.
[00:12:06.062 --> 00:12:08.762]  And we keep proving it over and over again.
[00:12:08.762 --> 00:12:13.604]  I don't know what it's going to take for the American people just to wake up and start the second American Revolution.
[00:12:13.604 --> 00:12:15.064]  These people are liars.
[00:12:15.064 --> 00:12:16.744]  These people are mass murderers.
[00:12:16.744 --> 00:12:20.105]  These people are responsible for the tragedy of 9-11.
[00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:20.806]  We have the facts.
[00:12:20.806 --> 00:12:21.406]  We have the proof.
[00:12:21.406 --> 00:12:22.706]  We have the evidence.
[00:12:22.706 --> 00:12:25.627]  And it's up to us to do something about it.
[00:12:25.627 --> 00:12:27.267]  And that's what we're about.
[00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:29.428]  Well, Luke, you know, I'm going to break a little story here.
[00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.249]  I'm
[00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:51.563]  I have no idea.
[00:12:51.563 --> 00:12:52.664]  Dick Cheney.
[00:12:52.664 --> 00:12:53.344]  Wow.
[00:12:53.344 --> 00:13:00.226]  Dick Cheney gave him that phone call, folks, and if you don't believe me, all you need to do is you need to go into the archives.
[00:13:00.226 --> 00:13:01.987]  It's less than a week after 9-11.
[00:13:01.987 --> 00:13:05.989]  He did an interview with Barbara Walters, okay?
[00:13:05.989 --> 00:13:08.289]  And here's the thing.
[00:13:08.289 --> 00:13:11.411]  It didn't get a lot of play, but, you know, you're down in New York.
[00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:14.772]  Luke, you know the newspaper Newsday over there, right?
[00:13:14.772 --> 00:13:17.093]  You know how it comes out into the different boroughs?
[00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:18.173]  Well, I had a friend
[00:13:18.874 --> 00:13:21.635]  Whose mother archived everything after 9-11.
[00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:28.237]  Literally, from 9-12 of that year, for the next 18 months, she kept all the papers.
[00:13:28.237 --> 00:13:31.939]  And, uh, I was down visiting him in Queens and he's like, you know, my mom's got this stack of papers.
[00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:35.300]  He's like, maybe you can use this in your next project.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:42.022]  And I, I got to go through it a little bit for the final cut, but, you know, it didn't really fit the script.
[00:13:42.022 --> 00:13:43.983]  Uh, you know, I hadn't gone through all of it.
[00:13:43.983 --> 00:13:47.684]  And on my new project, Fabled Enemies, which I'm working on down here in Austin right now,
[00:13:48.775 --> 00:13:50.518]  I did get to go through that archive.
[00:13:50.518 --> 00:13:58.210]  And one of the staff articles goes over Giuliani on Barbara Walters, where he clearly states that Cheney is the one that gave him that call.
[00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.073]  See, Cheney was calling everybody that morning.
[00:14:01.005 --> 00:14:08.252]  After the Secret Service took him down to the PEOC, he called up Bush and he said not to come back to DC.
[00:14:08.252 --> 00:14:14.397]  That's because the Secret Service was getting threats and somehow whoever was pulling off these attacks had all these secret code words.
[00:14:14.397 --> 00:14:25.227]  Not only the Angel is next, the Air Force one thing, but apparently they had codes for the NSA, the CIA, the FBI, and all these other high-ranking intelligence organizations.
[00:14:25.227 --> 00:14:26.568]  You can check that up, that's sourced at
[00:14:27.709 --> 00:14:37.337]  I want to say that is at WorldNetDaily, and if you type in digital moles in the White House, you're going to find out a whole new world of what happened on 9-11.
[00:14:37.337 --> 00:14:44.503]  It was reported once, and then it faded off, and then they said, oh, well, that threat that was received against Air Force One, that's the fog of war, Luke.
[00:14:44.503 --> 00:14:45.283]  That's the fog of war.
[00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:49.146]  We're not actually going to say who gave it to us, how we received it, what was really going on.
[00:14:49.146 --> 00:14:53.150]  We'll say fog of war, and the public is so dumbed down, they're going to buy it.
[00:14:53.715 --> 00:14:54.116]  Okay?
[00:14:54.116 --> 00:15:00.185]  I mean, these guys literally get on television and tell you who the criminals are, Luke, and people won't step up.
[00:15:00.185 --> 00:15:01.127]  You know why?
[00:15:01.127 --> 00:15:02.469]  American Idol's on.
[00:15:02.469 --> 00:15:03.551]  And it's a very good show.
[00:15:04.889 --> 00:15:06.510]  Everybody wants to watch that.
[00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.672]  They don't want to be involved in their local politics.
[00:15:08.672 --> 00:15:11.113]  They don't want to be involved in national politics.
[00:15:11.113 --> 00:15:12.834]  And it's kind of sad, Luke.
[00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:15.176]  So, what do we have to do to penetrate?
[00:15:15.176 --> 00:15:21.400]  Do you think that maybe this next project that Alex Jones puts out, the 9-11 Chronicles, is going to spark even more activism?
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.002]  I mean, as I've watched this thing get edited, I can only say that, you know,
[00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:28.269]  It's really, I mean, you're a role model, Luke.
[00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:32.052]  You're going to be a role model for hopefully millions of people around the world.
[00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:33.073]  You're already a role model for me.
[00:15:33.073 --> 00:15:38.998]  You've been my hero since I first met you down in New York City when we did that first screening of Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[00:15:38.998 --> 00:15:40.879]  I saw how fired up you were.
[00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:42.340]  I saw how educated you were.
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.822]  I saw how ready to go you were.
[00:15:43.822 --> 00:15:46.544]  And you really, you've made me proud again and again, brother.
[00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:50.638]  I mean, we are changing, not just about me, it's about everybody.
[00:15:50.638 --> 00:15:53.801]  I don't even want to be a role model, to be honest with you.
[00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:58.326]  And I'm just hoping to inspire as many people to be the change that they want to see in this world.
[00:15:58.326 --> 00:16:02.770]  And the more people that stand up, the more people that become leaders, the more people that say, that's it.
[00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.231]  I'm going to do the right thing.
[00:16:04.231 --> 00:16:06.494]  The better it is for everybody.
[00:16:06.494 --> 00:16:17.665]  And if everybody just stands up, if everybody becomes their own leaders, if everybody believes in themselves and doesn't look up to anybody, I think that's where we're going to make the huge transition into freedom, into liberty.
[00:16:17.665 --> 00:16:20.007]  And that's what I'm hoping to achieve.
[00:16:20.007 --> 00:16:22.750]  And that's what we're changing about, and that's what we're going to get.
[00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.852]  And I just wanted to say, that's amazing research that you just pulled out.
[00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:34.596]  I mean, Dick Cheney telling Rudolph Giuliani that towers are going to collapse, while the firefighters, while the police officers, while all the innocent people in the building did not know.
[00:16:34.596 --> 00:16:38.819]  And then we also know Larry Silverstein received the warning not to come into work.
[00:16:38.819 --> 00:16:43.841]  His daughter received the warning, and his son received the warning not to come into work on 9-11.
[00:16:43.841 --> 00:16:46.103]  And we know that from his own personal security staff.
[00:16:46.103 --> 00:16:46.623]  I mean, this is...
[00:16:46.943 --> 00:16:48.144]  This is just so criminal.
[00:16:48.144 --> 00:16:50.026]  I mean, I'm just so sick and tired.
[00:16:50.026 --> 00:16:53.069]  How much evidence do we need to get the truth out?
[00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:55.491]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:16:55.491 --> 00:17:06.342]  And I'd like to point out, too, that we're not saying that, you know, Larry Silverstein and Dick Cheney and Rudolph Giuliani were, in fact, the operational arm
[00:17:07.446 --> 00:17:37.030]  of this attack but they were definitely involved in the cover-up and definitely had prior knowledge somehow so they are connected and they definitely help with the cover-up I mean you know Dick Cheney if anybody was slightly part of the operational arm of the three would probably be at the top of my list with the stand down at the Pentagon with being in the PEOC but the thing was that when he went on television and did interviews in the first week after 9-11 he didn't think it was a big deal to talk about the PEOC and how he was there
[00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:38.579]  Prior.
[00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:39.299]  Let me say this again.
[00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.780]  Prior to the Pentagon strike.
[00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:45.161]  But as it progressed, he realized, wait a minute.
[00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:47.002]  I can't be there before the Pentagon.
[00:17:47.002 --> 00:17:50.643]  Because otherwise, people are going to realize that I allowed that to happen.
[00:17:50.643 --> 00:18:02.286]  So the 9-11 Commission goes and says, well, although there's conflicting reports and conflicting evidence, Cheney wasn't in that bunker until 9-54, almost 20 minutes after the Pentagon was hit.
[00:18:02.286 --> 00:18:02.746]  But we know
[00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:08.345]  That Norman Mineta was in that bunker prior to the Pentagon strike.
[00:18:08.345 --> 00:18:15.409]  And he said, not only was I there prior to the Pentagon strike, but before I got there, Dick Cheney and Lynne Cheney were in that bunker.
[00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:20.231]  And then he talked about the aid that came in as the, you know, Pentagon was about to be attacked.
[00:18:20.231 --> 00:18:23.032]  He said, hey, the plane's 50 miles out, Mr. Cheney.
[00:18:23.032 --> 00:18:26.174]  Hey, the plane's 30 miles out, Mr. Cheney.
[00:18:26.174 --> 00:18:26.854]  Hey, Mr. Cheney!
[00:18:28.015 --> 00:18:29.416]  The plane's ten miles out.
[00:18:29.416 --> 00:18:30.916]  Do the orders still stand?
[00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:32.837]  Of course the orders still stand!
[00:18:32.837 --> 00:18:35.698]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[00:18:35.698 --> 00:18:36.778]  What?
[00:18:36.778 --> 00:18:39.679]  And of course, Minetta thought this was going to be a shoot-down order.
[00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:41.380]  I mean, two targets had been hit.
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.760]  Two serious targets.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.762]  Two targets in the middle of Manhattan in restricted airspace.
[00:18:47.762 --> 00:18:55.185]  And then, the pinnacle of the military-industrial complex, literally the most guarded building in the world, gets struck.
[00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:58.313]  Protected by air defense missiles as well?
[00:18:58.313 --> 00:19:02.199]  Yeah, well they said there's no, uh, there's no SAM sites on the lawn.
[00:19:02.199 --> 00:19:04.162]  And there's no cameras at the Pentagon either.
[00:19:04.162 --> 00:19:11.012]  Even though you can see all the cameras on the top of the building that would have caught, you know, the plane that or whatever hit the Pentagon.
[00:19:11.172 --> 00:19:11.752]  Quite frankly.
[00:19:11.752 --> 00:19:28.806]  I mean, we know, through a FOIA request, that there are 85 videos pertaining to what struck the Pentagon, and we've seen four of them, and none of them, and I'll repeat this again, none of them clearly show American Airlines Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon.
[00:19:28.806 --> 00:19:29.706]  We'd love you to call in.
[00:19:29.706 --> 00:19:31.748]  We'd like to take callers in the next two segments.

[00:21:58.709 --> 00:22:01.772]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:22:01.772 --> 00:22:04.614]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:07.396]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:22:07.396 --> 00:22:10.579]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:17.905]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:22:20.936 --> 00:22:26.360]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[00:24:53.818 --> 00:24:59.742]  Willie, a 9-11 truther, a patriot, a hero, and he's gonna be playing Bonnaroo this year.
[00:24:59.742 --> 00:25:08.909]  And I know someone called in about Bonnaroo earlier in the week, but I'd really love to get down there, not only talk to Willie Nelson, but talk to some of these other celebrities, some of these other comedians.
[00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:11.750]  Janine Garofalo's gonna be there, and she's also come out on 9-11 Truth.
[00:25:13.018 --> 00:25:17.562]  But another guy that's going to be there, Luke, who I don't really care for, is Jim Norton.
[00:25:17.562 --> 00:25:21.126]  And Jim Norton helps out on the Opie and Anthony show down in New York.
[00:25:21.126 --> 00:25:22.507]  It's really big down there, folks.
[00:25:22.507 --> 00:25:25.349]  I know it's nationally syndicated and on XM.
[00:25:25.349 --> 00:25:32.416]  But I did the ONA show right at the beginning of Loose Chain 2nd Edition's success.
[00:25:32.416 --> 00:25:37.861]  And really, Corey started to do the interview, but was not prepared to be attacked in the manner he was.
[00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:47.375]  And, you know, being a producer, he hadn't done all the research I had, wasn't as quick on his feet with the facts, and I literally came in and he handed me the phone after about six minutes of the interview.
[00:25:47.375 --> 00:25:55.937]  And these, you know, disgusting excuses for human beings were talking about how they wanted to rape my mother, they wanted to give her AIDS, they were cutting my mic.
[00:25:55.937 --> 00:26:00.738]  I referred to them as sir again and again and again, but Jim Norton just makes me nauseous.
[00:26:00.738 --> 00:26:04.399]  There's a whole post over at loosechange911.com about it.
[00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:06.339]  I mean, he's into pedophilic jokes and
[00:26:06.846 --> 00:26:07.766]  All sorts of nonsense.
[00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:10.567]  He's just a vile, vile person.
[00:26:10.567 --> 00:26:19.350]  And Jesse Ventura went on a couple weeks ago in studio, and I can assure you they did not treat Ventura like they treated me, although they thoroughly disagreed with him.
[00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.931]  You don't get in the face of an ex-Navy SEAL.
[00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:33.554]  You don't get in the face of an ex-professional wrestler that would literally probably knock Jim Norton out with one punch, pick up his lifeless body, and beat ONA with that body.
[00:26:33.554 --> 00:26:36.555]  Anyway, we're talking to Luke Radowski of We Are Change.
[00:26:37.481 --> 00:26:41.263]  And Luke, before we go to callers, and we're going to do that in just a moment, folks.
[00:26:41.263 --> 00:26:46.065]  We're going to go pretty quick because we already got a lot of callers and we're going to take them all throughout the show.
[00:26:46.065 --> 00:26:50.727]  I want to talk a little about this John Kerry confrontation that you just did because I have not seen this yet.
[00:26:50.727 --> 00:26:51.587]  You haven't sent a tape.
[00:26:51.587 --> 00:26:53.348]  I haven't seen it on the YouTube.
[00:26:53.348 --> 00:26:55.229]  What can the kids expect?
[00:26:55.229 --> 00:26:58.810]  The John Kerry confrontation is literally amazing.
[00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:04.993]  I mean, coming out of that confrontation, I felt so good about how it just took place.
[00:27:05.613 --> 00:27:11.678]  We asked John Kerry about his comments last year, where he said Building 7 was brought down in a controlled fashion.
[00:27:11.678 --> 00:27:15.922]  I got right in his face when I asked him about his comments last year about WTC7.
[00:27:15.922 --> 00:27:17.923]  He says, I don't know what you're talking about, kid.
[00:27:17.923 --> 00:27:19.604]  Walked away.
[00:27:19.604 --> 00:27:20.885]  He's going outside.
[00:27:20.885 --> 00:27:21.506]  We nail him.
[00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:26.470]  Me, Matt, Gary, John Paul just start nailing him with questions about his comments.
[00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.153]  And he says, I never said nothing like that, and just gets back in his car.
[00:27:30.153 --> 00:27:32.595]  And then before that, when he's doing his book signing,
[00:27:33.328 --> 00:27:45.869]  Matt LaPesa goes up to him and instead of getting the book he had a picture of the skull and bones and he had Bush and Kerry equals skull and bones and he gave it to John Kerry to sign and John Kerry just looks at the sign.
[00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:52.711]  And he just throws it away, and then the police officers just drag Matt away after he looks at the skull and bones.
[00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:59.452]  And it's a beautiful video of John Kerry just looking up and down about three times on the skull and bones and looking at the camera up and down.
[00:27:59.452 --> 00:28:01.073]  I mean, it was a great competition.
[00:28:01.073 --> 00:28:02.733]  I mean, these people are liars.
[00:28:02.733 --> 00:28:03.474]  He lied.
[00:28:03.474 --> 00:28:05.694]  He said he never made a statement about a new world order after 9-11.
[00:28:05.694 --> 00:28:06.474]  And now John Kerry's lying.
[00:28:12.736 --> 00:28:13.496]  It's literally 1984.
[00:28:39.275 --> 00:28:44.438]  Where they can change history, things go down the memory hole, and they can just deny what they've said or done.
[00:28:44.438 --> 00:28:54.284]  It's just like, uh, you know, Bilderberg member John Edwards, uh, going around and all of a sudden people are saying, talking to him about Building 7, he's like, I've never heard of this.
[00:28:54.284 --> 00:28:55.424]  I'll look into it.
[00:28:55.424 --> 00:28:59.287]  I just don't know what you're talking, there's no reason to be upset, I'll, I'll check it out.
[00:28:59.287 --> 00:29:05.250]  And then every single instance afterwards where Building 7 is brought up, he just totally ignores it.
[00:29:05.871 --> 00:29:12.494]  You know, in passing, he's admitted to going to the Bilderberg meeting, but he said it was for environmental reasons.
[00:29:12.494 --> 00:29:15.596]  I mean, what kind of suckers do they think we are?
[00:29:15.596 --> 00:29:16.116]  We're not.
[00:29:16.116 --> 00:29:19.518]  I mean, we're exposing them one YouTube video at a time.
[00:29:19.518 --> 00:29:26.361]  We're exposing that they're liars, and they are just completely, without a doubt, lying to the American people.
[00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:29.823]  And that's what they're doing, and we're proving it every time we confront them.
[00:29:29.823 --> 00:29:31.844]  We can get by with a little help from our friends.
[00:29:31.844 --> 00:29:33.865]  Go into callers right after the break.
[00:29:33.865 --> 00:29:34.485]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:29:43.513 --> 00:29:47.436]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:47.436 --> 00:29:50.117]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.427 --> 00:29:56.948]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:29:56.948 --> 00:30:02.349]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[00:30:02.349 --> 00:30:07.510]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:18.613]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[00:30:19.033 --> 00:30:24.795]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:30:24.795 --> 00:30:31.057]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:30:31.057 --> 00:30:32.097]  What about you?
[00:30:32.097 --> 00:30:34.118]  Order your KDF shower filter normally.

[00:33:14.347 --> 00:33:16.468]  I am a Midwest farmer.
[00:33:16.468 --> 00:33:19.189]  I make a living off the land.
[00:33:19.189 --> 00:33:21.370]  I ride a John Deere tractor.
[00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:23.771]  I'm a liberated man.
[00:33:23.771 --> 00:33:28.593]  The rain, it hasn't fallen since the middle of July.
[00:33:28.593 --> 00:33:33.275]  And if it don't come soon, my crops will die.
[00:33:33.275 --> 00:33:37.977]  The bankman says he likes me, but there's nothing he can do.
[00:33:37.977 --> 00:33:41.559]  He tells me that he's coming, but the clouds are coming too.
[00:33:43.208 --> 00:33:45.590]  He ain't my friend.
[00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.451]  He ain't his friend, folks.
[00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:50.013]  He's there to take his farm.
[00:33:50.013 --> 00:33:51.034]  He's there to take his land.
[00:33:51.034 --> 00:33:56.838]  He's there to put on the government control that we are all under, folks.
[00:33:56.838 --> 00:33:57.379]  It's the truth.
[00:33:57.379 --> 00:33:59.460]  They're really consolidating power right now.
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.582]  I mean, they're blowing out the housing market.
[00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:02.743]  They're blowing out the dollar.
[00:34:02.743 --> 00:34:05.545]  That's why it's important to have hard currencies.
[00:34:05.545 --> 00:34:08.207]  Silver, gold, Ted Anderson can help you out with that.
[00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:10.840]  And it's good to have the information, Luke.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.080]  We have to keep educating each other.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.001]  We have to keep confronting this stuff.
[00:34:15.001 --> 00:34:17.242]  And we have to push.
[00:34:17.242 --> 00:34:20.663]  And push until we get the perpetrators behind 9-11, man.
[00:34:20.663 --> 00:34:28.866]  The way I look at it is, our entire foreign and domestic policy, Luke, is based on what the government and media have told us about 9-11.
[00:34:28.866 --> 00:34:30.287]  And it's time to take that back.
[00:34:30.287 --> 00:34:32.487]  It's time to bring the truth to the people.
[00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:33.548]  Luke, we're gonna go to callers.
[00:34:34.184 --> 00:34:37.186]  So let's go to our first caller, Russ in Texas.
[00:34:37.186 --> 00:34:38.147]  He's been holding the longest.
[00:34:38.147 --> 00:34:39.567]  Russ, are you with us?
[00:34:39.567 --> 00:34:40.788]  I sure am.
[00:34:40.788 --> 00:34:48.253]  You know, one of the most fulfilling things in being part of the Patriot Movement is actually getting to interact with the people that I look up to and admire.
[00:34:48.253 --> 00:34:51.755]  And you guys are right at the top of that list, along with Alex.
[00:34:51.755 --> 00:34:55.758]  And I've had a chance to meet you, Jason, at the Freedom in Law Conference in Dallas.
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:01.107]  And I had my 15-year-old son with me and he was very much impressed with the information.
[00:35:01.107 --> 00:35:08.759]  But I took him last night to a special screening of a new movie called Howard and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay.
[00:35:10.232 --> 00:35:13.954]  And this is your typical vulgarity and sophomore humor.
[00:35:13.954 --> 00:35:20.037]  Hey, you guys are young enough to be immersed in the pop culture enough where I don't think it would bother you too much, and I'd recommend seeing it.
[00:35:20.037 --> 00:35:36.686]  But these guys get caught... I'm not going to give away too much of the movie, and I have a point to make, but these guys get caught on an airplane smoking out of a bong, and the people on the plane misconstrue what they call it as a bomb.
[00:35:36.686 --> 00:35:38.247]  So they get thrown in Guantanamo Bay.
[00:35:38.982 --> 00:35:48.570]  Well, you know, of course the brain-dead Homeland Security people come along, and the top guys think they really have some serious terrorists on their hands.
[00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:57.738]  And this guy, actually, at one point, one of the guys says, I want, I'm not going to say a word until my lawyer gets here, I'm going to plead the Fifth Amendment.
[00:35:57.738 --> 00:36:07.346]  And the Homeland Security guy goes and gets a copy of the Bill of Rights, tears out the page with the Fifth Amendment on it, and wipes himself with it.
[00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:13.539]  Now this is typical, but my point is, they're using humor to get the message out.
[00:36:14.062 --> 00:36:14.902]  Well, I would say this.
[00:36:14.902 --> 00:36:20.885]  I mean, Michael Hayden virtually did that by saying, well, you know, it's not probable cause.
[00:36:20.885 --> 00:36:22.765]  It's reasonable search and seizure.
[00:36:22.765 --> 00:36:27.107]  And the journalist who's talking to Michael Hayden is saying, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:27.107 --> 00:36:29.748]  He's like, it's, you know, probable cause.
[00:36:29.748 --> 00:36:32.129]  So then you can have a reasonable search and seizure.
[00:36:32.129 --> 00:36:33.069]  He's like, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:34.970]  There is no probable cause.
[00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.431]  It's reasonable search and seizure.
[00:36:36.431 --> 00:36:38.271]  And we're going to decide what's reasonable.
[00:36:38.271 --> 00:36:40.392]  And that's, I mean, on one end, you're right.
[00:36:40.392 --> 00:36:42.493]  You know, that's there for the youth.
[00:36:42.913 --> 00:36:46.596]  They're trying to bring us into this that there is no Fifth Amendment.
[00:36:46.596 --> 00:36:52.622]  And then, you know, for the older crowd that are watching the news, they're seeing Michael Hayden up there going, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:36:52.622 --> 00:36:53.643]  No, no, no.
[00:36:53.643 --> 00:36:55.264]  It's a reasonable search and seizure.
[00:36:55.264 --> 00:36:56.005]  There is no problem.
[00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:57.566]  You're actually talking about the Fourth Amendment.
[00:36:57.566 --> 00:36:58.347]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:36:58.347 --> 00:36:58.847]  That's okay.
[00:36:58.847 --> 00:36:59.248]  No, no, no.
[00:36:59.248 --> 00:36:59.828]  I understand.
[00:36:59.828 --> 00:37:01.990]  But, you know, his point was, I'm not going to say a word.
[00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:08.596]  The point is, I mean, just like, you know, George W. Bush said, you know, this is, this Constitution is just a G.D.
[00:37:08.596 --> 00:37:09.277]  piece of paper.
[00:37:10.259 --> 00:37:13.622]  I mean, this is the attitude that these people have.
[00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:21.890]  They even interact with an actor who's playing President Bush in the movie, and at one point they sit down and get stoned with him.
[00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:27.936]  And he tells them, he says, look, it's not important for a citizen to stand up for his government.
[00:37:27.936 --> 00:37:30.059]  I am the government and I don't trust them.
[00:37:30.059 --> 00:37:33.262]  He said it's important for a citizen to stand up for his country.
[00:37:34.265 --> 00:37:36.287]  Well, Russ, I mean, that's just the way it is.
[00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:39.909]  Ever since the Military Commissions Act, he's pretty much anointed himself a god.
[00:37:39.909 --> 00:37:42.912]  I thank you for the call, Russ, and thanks for coming out.
[00:37:42.912 --> 00:37:43.412]  You still there?
[00:37:43.412 --> 00:37:44.153]  No?
[00:37:44.153 --> 00:37:45.173]  Yeah, you're still there.
[00:37:45.173 --> 00:37:45.694]  Go ahead, Russ.
[00:37:45.694 --> 00:37:46.915]  Okay.
[00:37:46.915 --> 00:37:50.817]  There is not a We Are Change group in Dallas, Texas.
[00:37:50.817 --> 00:37:51.878]  Well, then there needs to be.
[00:37:51.878 --> 00:37:53.820]  Someone needs to get out there.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.822]  The sitting president is moving here after his term.
[00:37:58.584 --> 00:38:00.546]  Well, there needs to be.
[00:38:00.546 --> 00:38:04.309]  We are Change.org, TruthAction.org, LoneLantern.org.
[00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:08.153]  There's 9-11 truth groups everywhere, and I'm calling people out.
[00:38:08.153 --> 00:38:09.434]  Let's do this.
[00:38:09.434 --> 00:38:10.595]  Luke, how do they get started?
[00:38:10.595 --> 00:38:12.216]  Why don't you let the people know, and thanks, Russ.
[00:38:12.216 --> 00:38:13.417]  We're going to go to another caller.
[00:38:13.417 --> 00:38:15.039]  Luke, how do they get involved in We Are Change?
[00:38:15.743 --> 00:38:22.805]  People could contact us to get the rules and bylaws and everything that we stand for about non-violence and peaceful demonstrations.
[00:38:22.805 --> 00:38:27.467]  And it's really just about getting a camera, getting a politician's face, educating people, talking to people.
[00:38:27.467 --> 00:38:30.828]  And as long as you're doing the right thing, you are being a part of change.
[00:38:30.828 --> 00:38:32.509]  And that's all that really matters.
[00:38:32.509 --> 00:38:32.969]  Absolutely.
[00:38:32.969 --> 00:38:33.789]  Thank you, Lou.
[00:38:33.789 --> 00:38:36.350]  Let's go to Scott in New York.
[00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:36.950]  I love New York.
[00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:38.151]  That's where I'm from, folks.
[00:38:38.151 --> 00:38:39.091]  A little vacation.
[00:38:39.091 --> 00:38:40.431]  Scott, are you with us?
[00:38:40.431 --> 00:38:40.892]  Yeah.
[00:38:40.892 --> 00:38:41.652]  Can you hear me?
[00:38:41.652 --> 00:38:42.132]  Absolutely.
[00:38:42.132 --> 00:38:43.292]  How you doing, man?
[00:38:43.292 --> 00:38:44.253]  Good, man.
[00:38:44.253 --> 00:38:45.153]  I live in New York City.
[00:38:46.212 --> 00:38:48.834]  And I lived there on 9-11.
[00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:50.655]  And I lived in Union Square.
[00:38:50.655 --> 00:38:57.119]  And after the first building got hit, I went on top of my roof deck.
[00:38:57.119 --> 00:38:59.161]  And, you know, I was watching.
[00:38:59.161 --> 00:39:02.063]  I didn't see the second plane hit.
[00:39:02.063 --> 00:39:03.524]  I saw the explosion.
[00:39:03.524 --> 00:39:07.867]  And, you know, I'm just curious, you know, about that whole second plane.
[00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:10.929]  I know there's people are saying that the
[00:39:11.823 --> 00:39:16.746]  But it isn't fake on CNN, and I know you've done a lot of research.
[00:39:16.746 --> 00:39:23.369]  I'm wondering what your opinion is on it.
[00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:26.511]  It does look like it could be fake.
[00:39:26.511 --> 00:39:27.772]  Let me get into it, though.
[00:39:27.772 --> 00:39:31.854]  Let me talk about it, because I've gotten this, and I'm not trying to cut you off here.
[00:39:32.873 --> 00:39:34.234]  If I can say something as well?
[00:39:34.234 --> 00:39:34.915]  Sure.
[00:39:34.915 --> 00:39:42.722]  I just wanted to say that I just talked to a survivor who was in another building when the 10-cars were under attack.
[00:39:42.722 --> 00:39:45.365]  It was a building across the World Trade Center.
[00:39:45.365 --> 00:39:53.753]  He says he didn't see the first plane hit the building, but he says he clearly saw the plane hit the second building, and then he saw a huge explosion in the lobby take place.
[00:39:54.493 --> 00:39:57.914]  Alright, well let me just go over it, Luke, because I'm with you on that.
[00:39:57.914 --> 00:40:00.194]  I mean, I've talked to dozens of eyewitnesses.
[00:40:00.194 --> 00:40:01.734]  You know, I go down to New York City with you.
[00:40:01.734 --> 00:40:09.896]  I'm down there maybe, you know, four or five times a year in some kind of a respect where I am talking to family members, where I am talking to first responders.
[00:40:09.896 --> 00:40:12.156]  And on top of that, I would say this.
[00:40:12.156 --> 00:40:18.297]  If they were going to fake the video of the second plane, why wouldn't they make it look more like a United Airlines plane?
[00:40:18.297 --> 00:40:21.998]  Everybody who's flown United knows.
[00:40:21.998 --> 00:40:23.058]  Okay, I'm gonna say this again.
[00:40:23.058 --> 00:40:23.358]  Knows.
[00:40:24.141 --> 00:40:28.626]  That it has a blue underside with two large blue engines.
[00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:37.975]  Now, in all the videos I've seen, the best you can see is possibly a United logo on the tail, alright?
[00:40:37.975 --> 00:40:41.899]  But when you watch that famous CNN shot from the underbelly of the plane, it's a grey plane.
[00:40:42.492 --> 00:40:44.474]  You know, it's clearly a grey plane.
[00:40:44.474 --> 00:40:54.541]  There's no, there's no tonal difference, there's no blue on the underside, there's no blue engines, plus it makes an outline hole of whatever hits the building, the plane.
[00:40:54.541 --> 00:41:00.946]  I mean, the wings are there, uh, you know, the body's there, it goes in, the huge explosion happens, and then there's a hole there.
[00:41:00.946 --> 00:41:03.028]  I do not believe in TV fakery.
[00:41:03.568 --> 00:41:18.218]  I think there's a good possibility that they used drones if you look at the scientific evidence of the G-forces, if you look at the drills they were running that day, if you look at the fact that they had E-4Bs in the air, these doomsday planes, one of which got caught out in D.C.
[00:41:18.218 --> 00:41:26.163]  right around the time of the Pentagon attack, and then, of course, there is a mysterious white plane on the scene of the World Trade Center prior to the second strike.
[00:41:26.516 --> 00:41:28.177]  You can see it's a camera plan archive.
[00:41:28.177 --> 00:41:30.038]  I suggest everybody go out and check it out.
[00:41:30.038 --> 00:41:31.699]  It looks a little different from an E-4B.
[00:41:31.699 --> 00:41:38.063]  It looks like it has... It's a white body with a blue underside on the wings and possibly a blue tail.
[00:41:38.063 --> 00:41:43.647]  But you can also see it... It looks like that plane is also leaving as the second plane hits the building.
[00:41:43.647 --> 00:41:45.408]  And it's possibly an E-4B.
[00:41:45.408 --> 00:41:48.149]  I'm not going to go out and say it is an E-4B.
[00:41:48.149 --> 00:41:52.332]  But it is a mysterious white plane that is in restricted airspace and should not be there.
[00:41:53.012 --> 00:41:59.174]  Okay, I do not believe all this, you know, color key, 9-11 octopus, TV fakery garbage.
[00:41:59.174 --> 00:42:03.275]  And I really, I really think that's out there to discredit us.
[00:42:03.275 --> 00:42:05.096]  I mean, why would they do that?
[00:42:05.096 --> 00:42:07.697]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[00:42:07.697 --> 00:42:09.597]  And, you know, I'm yet to be proven wrong.
[00:42:09.597 --> 00:42:11.698]  And I think Nico Hopped is a raving lunatic.
[00:42:11.698 --> 00:42:13.739]  You can just see that by his tactics.
[00:42:13.739 --> 00:42:14.979]  And I'm not even going to plug
[00:42:15.638 --> 00:42:22.499]  You know, his work, because he's out there harassing people that are being proactive, like Luke Radowski all the time.
[00:42:22.499 --> 00:42:31.721]  You know, Luke, you're out there trying to make change, trying to bring up real issues, and you've got to deal with this guy who's just in your face because you're not taking his opinion.
[00:42:31.721 --> 00:42:33.241]  Scott, I thank you for the call, man.
[00:42:33.241 --> 00:42:34.741]  I hope I answered your question.
[00:42:34.741 --> 00:42:36.602]  We're going to jump to yet another caller.
[00:42:36.602 --> 00:42:38.382]  Let's go to James in Indiana.
[00:42:38.382 --> 00:42:40.002]  James, are you with me?
[00:42:40.002 --> 00:42:41.082]  Hi, Jason.
[00:42:41.082 --> 00:42:41.723]  How you doing, man?
[00:42:41.723 --> 00:42:43.023]  Really good job.
[00:42:43.023 --> 00:42:43.383]  Thank you, man.
[00:42:44.798 --> 00:42:47.560]  A question for you, and one question for Luke, too.
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:47.941]  Sure.
[00:42:47.941 --> 00:42:48.561]  If I can, okay?
[00:42:48.561 --> 00:42:49.822]  Yeah.
[00:42:49.822 --> 00:42:50.363]  One for you.
[00:42:50.363 --> 00:42:53.586]  Earlier, you kind of touched on it.
[00:42:53.586 --> 00:42:59.451]  The Pentagon, you were talking about the plane, and then you kind of corrected yourself, or whatever it was that hit it.
[00:42:59.451 --> 00:43:03.194]  What's confusing to me is, why not just admit it was a plane?
[00:43:03.194 --> 00:43:11.882]  Because, as far as I'm aware of, every witness that was there said it was a plane, and all the evidence was a plane.
[00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:17.002]  There are rescue workers who went inside and talked about the passengers that were still strapped inside.
[00:43:17.002 --> 00:43:21.926]  Well, I haven't seen that one, but I mean, have you seen the final cut yet, James?
[00:43:21.926 --> 00:43:22.686]  Yeah, it's a great movie.
[00:43:22.686 --> 00:43:23.047]  I got it.
[00:43:23.047 --> 00:43:23.747]  I bought it.
[00:43:23.747 --> 00:43:24.087]  Excellent.
[00:43:24.087 --> 00:43:26.869]  So, you know that, I mean, we do kind of show both sides.
[00:43:26.869 --> 00:43:30.712]  I mean, we do show you the eyewitnesses that were there that said that they saw a plane.
[00:43:30.712 --> 00:43:32.934]  However, none of them saw the plane actually strike the building.
[00:43:32.934 --> 00:43:34.155]  And I'll say it goes over that hill.
[00:43:34.155 --> 00:43:38.578]  Even Mike Walter, who didn't make the final cut, but he was in the second edition.
[00:43:38.578 --> 00:43:39.799]  Now, we went to down to D.C.
[00:43:40.865 --> 00:44:09.456]  Earlier in the year, and I even went and had a barbecue with Mike Walter, and he's the famous guy that said he saw the American Airlines logo and it was like a missile with wings, and I literally spent the afternoon with him and his family, and Bob Pugh, who's in the movie, who took all that video of the lawn and everything, and I found it very telling that, you know, although he promised us an interview, we went to his home, we had dinner with him, he kept putting it off and putting it off and putting it off until it was about the end of the week, and then he just flat-out said no.
[00:44:10.333 --> 00:44:13.976]  Okay, so I don't know why he would say no to us.
[00:44:13.976 --> 00:44:17.539]  But you're aware that there's like lots of other witnesses.
[00:44:17.539 --> 00:44:18.660]  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:25.766]  But then you go to the guy who was heading up the operation and he says, well, there's not any big pieces of plane.
[00:44:25.766 --> 00:44:28.448]  We haven't found any engines, any fuselage sections.
[00:44:28.448 --> 00:44:29.829]  There's these tiny sections.
[00:44:30.535 --> 00:44:33.818]  So, you know, I'm still up in the air with what exactly hit the Pentagon.
[00:44:33.818 --> 00:44:35.059]  I don't like to take either side.
[00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:38.442]  Obviously, you have to account for the damage against the light poles.
[00:44:38.442 --> 00:44:41.484]  You would think something with a wingspan would have had to hit those down.
[00:44:41.484 --> 00:44:52.113]  But I would say it's really hard for me to believe that a 757 or a 767 could do that and still maintain enough control not to crash into the lawn or the highway beforehand.
[00:44:52.113 --> 00:44:53.214]  I may be wrong.
[00:44:53.214 --> 00:44:57.798]  But see, that's the heart of 9-11, is planes flying into buildings.
[00:44:58.187 --> 00:44:58.408]  Mm-hmm.
[00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:06.193]  That's, to me, a smoking gun proof of remote control.
[00:45:06.193 --> 00:45:07.354]  Well, I gotta agree.
[00:45:07.354 --> 00:45:10.396]  If it was a plane, man, I do think it was remote controlled.
[00:45:10.396 --> 00:45:14.039]  And I don't think it was made of the same material as a 757 or 767.
[00:45:14.039 --> 00:45:18.423]  Those wings are relatively, you know, light, flexible metal.
[00:45:18.423 --> 00:45:20.144]  You know, I mean, everybody's been on a plane.
[00:45:20.144 --> 00:45:21.285]  Or not everybody, but most people.
[00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:25.489]  And if you sit by the window, you can see, you know, the wings move up and down a little bit.
[00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:28.011]  You know, there's that there for strain and stress.
[00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:33.975]  And I still don't see how it clipped those five light bulbs, even remote control, being made of that material.
[00:45:33.975 --> 00:45:34.675]  It could have been a drone.
[00:45:34.675 --> 00:45:36.417]  It could have been something we don't know about.
[00:45:36.417 --> 00:45:39.660]  It could have been painted up like an American Airlines plane.
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:45.485]  My biggest problem with that is if it's a 757-767 type, even if it was supposedly remote controlled in,
[00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:46.985]  Where's the tail section?
[00:45:46.985 --> 00:45:48.326]  Where's the marks from the tail section?
[00:45:48.326 --> 00:45:52.988]  How come the wingspan isn't as wide as it should be with the markings?
[00:45:52.988 --> 00:45:55.169]  It's off about 60 feet, I think.
[00:45:55.169 --> 00:46:00.471]  The damage to the building is something like 74 feet, and the wingspan is something like 120 feet.
[00:46:00.471 --> 00:46:05.953]  So, I mean, again, you know, I'm with you that I do believe some type of plane hit the building.
[00:46:05.953 --> 00:46:07.514]  What type is up in the air for me?
[00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:09.414]  So you said you had a question for Luke also?
[00:46:09.414 --> 00:46:12.976]  Yeah, I had a chance on getting a confrontation with the Penguin, Dick Cheney.
[00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:20.193]  He was here in New York City, but we couldn't get anywhere near him on Monday.
[00:46:20.193 --> 00:46:24.816]  Police officers and Secret Service all over him, and there's no way we could get near him.
[00:46:24.816 --> 00:46:26.838]  But if there is, we'll be there.
[00:46:26.838 --> 00:46:28.699]  Don't worry about it.
[00:46:28.699 --> 00:46:29.239]  Alright, James.
[00:46:29.239 --> 00:46:30.880]  Thank you so much for the call, man.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:38.486]  And I would say that my favorite Dick Cheney confrontation so far shows up in Spike Lee's documentary about Hurricane Katrina.
[00:46:39.258 --> 00:46:42.381]  Where a couple guys find out he's around the corner in their truck.
[00:46:42.381 --> 00:46:43.482]  And they're like, let's go, man.
[00:46:43.482 --> 00:46:44.622]  Let's go confront him.
[00:46:44.622 --> 00:46:46.664]  And they go right up to him.
[00:46:46.664 --> 00:46:48.926]  Go F yourself, Mr. Cheney!
[00:46:48.926 --> 00:46:50.347]  Why don't you go F yourself?
[00:46:50.347 --> 00:46:53.310]  And then the reporter's like, Mr. Cheney, are you getting a lot of that?
[00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:57.493]  First time I've heard it!
[00:46:57.493 --> 00:47:00.656]  Alright, let's go to James in Indiana.
[00:47:00.656 --> 00:47:03.618]  James, are you with us?
[00:47:03.618 --> 00:47:04.299]  Ah, James.
[00:47:04.299 --> 00:47:05.279]  James may be dropped.
[00:47:05.279 --> 00:47:06.580]  No James?
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:07.021]  Alright, well...
[00:47:07.933 --> 00:47:08.994]  Oh, I did just talk to James.
[00:47:08.994 --> 00:47:09.454]  What am I doing?
[00:47:09.454 --> 00:47:09.934]  Of course I did.
[00:47:09.934 --> 00:47:11.055]  Let's go to Don in Texas.
[00:47:11.055 --> 00:47:12.836]  I'm sorry about that.
[00:47:12.836 --> 00:47:13.756]  Don, are you with us?
[00:47:13.756 --> 00:47:14.597]  Yeah, hi there.
[00:47:14.597 --> 00:47:15.177]  Hi there.
[00:47:15.177 --> 00:47:15.857]  How you doing, man?
[00:47:15.857 --> 00:47:17.078]  Glad to see you there.
[00:47:17.078 --> 00:47:18.039]  Well, thank you.
[00:47:18.039 --> 00:47:20.140]  Yeah, you're a real patriot.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:33.627]  Say, the reason I call is something that doesn't come up too often, and I think that Alex and several other people have been holding off on it, is this raid on the Yearning for Zion Marmon group out there in West Texas.
[00:47:33.627 --> 00:47:34.367]  Mm-hmm.
[00:47:34.367 --> 00:47:36.168]  I've been keeping up on it, so what do you want to talk about on it?
[00:47:36.168 --> 00:47:37.189]  Yeah, I hope you've been researching it.
[00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:38.612]  I don't know.
[00:47:54.145 --> 00:47:56.966]  And there's been no trial.
[00:47:56.966 --> 00:47:58.126]  I agree with you there.
[00:47:58.126 --> 00:48:00.887]  Let me just break this down for people that don't know.
[00:48:00.887 --> 00:48:06.748]  The government came in to a polygamist compound and they took all these women's kids.
[00:48:06.748 --> 00:48:13.630]  Now they got them both on there, they separated them, they said that they were just going to be away from them for a moment and then they shipped the kids off in buses.
[00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:18.871]  Now they told the women that they could stay there and try to get their kids back or they could go back to the compound.
[00:48:18.871 --> 00:48:20.372]  Now there was no guarantees either way.
[00:48:20.372 --> 00:48:21.692]  Now these women have been paraded
[00:48:22.446 --> 00:48:25.727]  Around Larry King Live, Anderson Cooper.
[00:48:25.727 --> 00:48:29.368]  It seems like CNN is doing the most coverage of this.
[00:48:29.368 --> 00:48:32.149]  Now, they've let people into their home recently.
[00:48:32.149 --> 00:48:35.030]  And here's my take on that.
[00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:39.211]  So far, I'm not going to go whether the guys that are there are pedophiles or not.
[00:48:39.211 --> 00:48:39.871]  I don't know.
[00:48:39.871 --> 00:48:40.512]  I'm not in there.
[00:48:40.512 --> 00:48:42.792]  There is no trial like you said.
[00:48:42.792 --> 00:48:45.073]  Now, the state always seems to go after
[00:48:46.141 --> 00:48:50.144]  The people that the masses are going to conclude are crazy off the bat.
[00:48:50.144 --> 00:48:52.926]  That's why we saw what happened at Waco.
[00:48:52.926 --> 00:48:58.349]  You know, they always tested on people that are a control group, okay?
[00:48:58.349 --> 00:49:05.133]  And what they're doing here is they're saying they're going in and making a precedent that they can take your kids whenever they want without a trial.
[00:49:05.133 --> 00:49:07.535]  And that's why I believe they're targeting these women.
[00:49:07.535 --> 00:49:08.976]  You know, I feel for these women.
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:19.024]  You know, but it doesn't help their cause that one of these women, uh, actually, you know, left the compound, escaped with their children, and is talking a lot of smack about it.
[00:49:19.024 --> 00:49:35.892]  Now, I don't know what the situation there is, but I do know it's not good news for me and you, who live, what I would say, normal, moray lives, you know, one wife, kids, because they're gonna use that precedent to inflict this rule on the rest of the population.
[00:49:35.892 --> 00:49:36.692]  Do you agree with that, Don?
[00:49:37.728 --> 00:49:43.871]  Another thing, too, you say this one woman left the camp and she's copping out on them and saying they're terrible people.
[00:49:43.871 --> 00:49:46.111]  That could be a constructed event.
[00:49:46.111 --> 00:49:56.896]  It could be something that there was one woman that had already written a book about the whole thing, well ahead of the raid, like it was planned, saying that they were terrible people.
[00:49:56.896 --> 00:49:59.177]  They say it's a polygamous group.
[00:49:59.177 --> 00:50:00.717]  I know a lot of Mormons.
[00:50:00.717 --> 00:50:06.820]  I used to guide hunters up in Wyoming and Idaho, and a lot of Mormon people would come there.
[00:50:07.486 --> 00:50:11.768]  And I don't know for sure why they say it's a polygamous camp.
[00:50:11.768 --> 00:50:13.529]  I've not proved that it's so.
[00:50:13.529 --> 00:50:15.189]  There may be some of that.
[00:50:15.189 --> 00:50:27.555]  If they are, they should go through the process of the law, not just raid them and make royal proclamations that we've decided this without any trial.
[00:50:27.555 --> 00:50:30.536]  And I think there's already been 10 or 12, 15 children that have been so
[00:50:36.752 --> 00:50:37.973]  Don, I'm with you.
[00:50:37.973 --> 00:50:39.234]  I'm with you 100 percent, Don.
[00:50:39.234 --> 00:50:40.275]  There needs to be a trial.
[00:50:40.275 --> 00:50:41.636]  There needs to be due process.
[00:50:41.636 --> 00:50:42.396]  I thank you for the call.
[00:50:42.396 --> 00:50:44.057]  We're going to come back to Simon and others.
[00:50:44.057 --> 00:50:47.119]  Last segment with Luke Rudowsky, Alex Jones Show.
[00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:47.820]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[00:50:53.317 --> 00:51:06.464]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[00:51:06.464 --> 00:51:10.286]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[00:51:10.626 --> 00:51:17.532]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[00:51:17.532 --> 00:51:20.934]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[00:51:20.934 --> 00:51:28.821]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[00:51:54.485 --> 00:52:00.569]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of disease such as cancer or diabetes?
[00:52:00.569 --> 00:52:06.514]  Acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat, what we drink, the environment, and our high-stress lifestyles.
[00:52:06.514 --> 00:52:10.676]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[00:52:10.676 --> 00:52:15.580]  The easiest way to reduce disease-causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:24.330]  At SnyderHealth.com, we offer a full line of alkaline water ionizers from Jupiter Science, the leader in water ionization technology for over 25 years.

[00:54:11.087 --> 00:54:11.887]  All right, folks.
[00:54:11.887 --> 00:54:12.807]  We are back.
[00:54:12.807 --> 00:54:14.928]  Final segment of the first hour.
[00:54:14.928 --> 00:54:19.709]  Final segment with Luke Rudowsky of WeAreChange.org.
[00:54:19.709 --> 00:54:25.070]  You can check everything out over at InfoWars.com if you missed any of this global transmission.
[00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:26.350]  We loop it.
[00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:29.871]  So, you know, you'll be able to hear this until tomorrow when Alex goes live again.
[00:54:29.871 --> 00:54:33.071]  Yes, Alex Jones will be back for Friday, folks.
[00:54:33.071 --> 00:54:35.112]  I'm just filling in for today.
[00:54:35.112 --> 00:54:38.613]  You can also go to the InfoWars shop and check out some of the new movies they got.
[00:54:38.613 --> 00:54:40.853]  And I gotta tell you, I'm really excited about these films.
[00:54:41.212 --> 00:54:49.094]  I checked out American Drug War probably about two months ago and was thoroughly impressed with Kevin Booth's performance in this movie.
[00:54:49.094 --> 00:54:50.614]  This is an important film.
[00:54:50.614 --> 00:54:58.176]  This really breaks down how the CIA and other covert programs within the United States government ship in the hard drugs.
[00:54:58.176 --> 00:54:59.216]  They ship in the cocaine.
[00:54:59.216 --> 00:55:09.178]  They ship in the heroin that they get you hooked on, throw you in prison for, and then have you work slave labor for about 39 cents an hour for corporations like AT&T and others.
[00:55:09.178 --> 00:55:09.578]  You didn't know?
[00:55:10.239 --> 00:55:15.021]  Yeah, they're the ones calling you at night, saying, hey, how would you like to switch your service?
[00:55:15.021 --> 00:55:16.641]  That's a convicted felon.
[00:55:16.641 --> 00:55:18.902]  Yeah, more times than not.
[00:55:18.902 --> 00:55:27.966]  See, that way they don't have to outsource to Pakistan, or Mexico, or one of these other second or third world nations where they can, you know, pay these people slave labor wages.
[00:55:27.966 --> 00:55:32.047]  You know, they can just pay slave labor wages in this country and privatize the prisons.
[00:55:32.047 --> 00:55:35.208]  It's all good stuff, isn't it, Luke?
[00:55:35.208 --> 00:55:35.809]  I still got Luke?
[00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:39.490]  The new America which we're all living in, unless we do something, we're only going to get worse.
[00:55:40.117 --> 00:55:44.541]  Luke, before we take another call, I really just want to plug WeAreChange.org.
[00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:47.363]  I want to plug, you know, your YouTube site.
[00:55:47.363 --> 00:55:47.724]  What is it?
[00:55:47.724 --> 00:55:48.224]  YouTube?
[00:55:48.224 --> 00:55:51.727]  And they can just Google WeAreChange and they can see all your stuff?
[00:55:51.727 --> 00:55:54.109]  YouTube.com slash WeAreChange.
[00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.590]  That's right.
[00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:55.670]  And there's all sorts of...
[00:55:57.236 --> 00:55:59.577]  Stories over at Prison Planet, over at InfoWars.
[00:55:59.577 --> 00:56:01.837]  Aaron Dykes does a great job over here.
[00:56:01.837 --> 00:56:04.898]  The Watson Boys out in the UK, they do an awesome job.
[00:56:04.898 --> 00:56:06.739]  InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:06.739 --> 00:56:07.859]  Yeah, I wanted to thank those guys.
[00:56:07.859 --> 00:56:09.159]  Those guys are awesome.
[00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:09.879]  They really are.
[00:56:09.879 --> 00:56:10.900]  You know, I love those guys.
[00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:19.702]  And let me plug Paul Joseph Watson's book really quick, because Order Out of Chaos, for me, was the quintessential New World Order book.
[00:56:19.702 --> 00:56:21.783]  Okay, it's very easy read.
[00:56:21.783 --> 00:56:23.563]  It's very well sourced.
[00:56:24.232 --> 00:56:25.693]  How do you do, gentlemen?
[00:56:51.312 --> 00:56:58.495]  I'd just like to say I really appreciate what yourself and Luke and all the others are doing.
[00:56:58.495 --> 00:57:05.317]  And I'm going to make this call as quickly as possible because I know you guys have got a lot going on.
[00:57:05.317 --> 00:57:13.940]  But just to give you a feel for my background, I spent nine years with the British Special Forces as a former Lieutenant Colonel.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:18.162]  I've managed to wake up a good friend of mine that's now left the service.
[00:57:19.272 --> 00:57:35.300]  He actually served in the Pentagon, so I'd like to make that my first point, is the fact that you can't approach the Pentagon at least 150 miles out without being detected.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:40.542]  So there's obviously an inside job going on there.
[00:57:40.542 --> 00:57:44.624]  With the damage that was caused, it is almost identical to
[00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:56.111]  The firing of an Exocet missile, which actually can be launched from a carrier and a number of other forms of transport.
[00:57:57.983 --> 00:58:08.470]  My second point is that the witnesses that say they saw various planes on 9-11 in New York, obviously... Simon, listen, Simon, stick around.
[00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:10.471]  We're going to bring you over to the second hour.
[00:58:10.471 --> 00:58:12.072]  Luke, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:58:12.072 --> 00:58:13.893]  WeAreChange.org.
[00:58:13.893 --> 00:58:15.474]  Get ready, second hour coming up.
[00:58:15.474 --> 00:58:16.415]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[00:58:34.704 --> 00:58:37.967]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:37.967 --> 00:58:43.673]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:43.673 --> 00:58:45.094]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:45.094 --> 00:58:47.937]  A new world order.
[00:58:47.937 --> 00:58:48.858]  In the near future.
[00:58:49.733 --> 00:58:52.415]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:52.415 --> 00:58:55.638]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:55.638 --> 00:58:58.420]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:01.603]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:01.603 --> 00:59:08.929]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:11.963 --> 00:59:12.323]  We're good to go.
[00:59:45.864 --> 00:59:48.265]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:48.265 --> 00:59:57.247]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:57.247 --> 00:59:58.988]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:58.988 --> 01:00:00.548]  You want answers?
[01:00:00.548 --> 01:00:01.488]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:01.488 --> 01:00:06.290]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:10.351]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:13.384]  We are back!
[01:00:13.384 --> 01:00:15.545]  It is the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:27.994]  I am Jason Bermas of Loose Change, and you can get Loose Change over at LooseChangeTheFinalCut.com, InfoWars.com, or you can check out my blog over at LooseChange911.com.
[01:00:27.994 --> 01:00:32.857]  Not only do we have all the events that we're doing, where it's being shown, where you can get Loose Change Final Cut, but
[01:00:33.317 --> 01:00:35.600]  You know, I comment on a lot of other things.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:41.406]  We've got Mark Dice on the line, but first I want to finish up with Simon in California and his points about the Pentagon.
[01:00:41.406 --> 01:00:52.617]  It definitely does look like some kind of projectile fire when you have that small hole and that exit hole that's almost exactly the same size through the third ring at about 16 feet, doesn't it, Simon?
[01:00:53.712 --> 01:01:07.259]  Exactly, and a friend of mine that's actually resigned his commission now because of what I've helped wake him up to and what he's found out by serving with the US Navy in Hawaii.
[01:01:09.814 --> 01:01:20.697]  He just initially couldn't believe what was going on, the way that they're lying to people and all of these secret operations are going on that people don't know about.
[01:01:20.697 --> 01:01:25.318]  And as soon as you speak out, they call you a liar.
[01:01:25.318 --> 01:01:35.781]  I mean, an example is a colleague of mine, Ben Griffin, that's the first SAS soldier to refuse to go back and fight in Iraq because
[01:01:36.825 --> 01:02:00.630]  He's made efforts to get it out there that David Miliband from the UK Parliament is basically saying that the UK has no involvement in extraordinary rendition, when everybody knows that as soon as you hand a prisoner over to the US authorities, that that person is going to be abused and tortured.
[01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:01.410]  And it's a disgrace.
[01:02:04.489 --> 01:02:06.170]  It is a disgrace, man, and you know what?
[01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:14.513]  They've just passed more and more legislation to continue to let this happen from Patriot Acts 1 and 2 to parts of Patriot Act 3 to the Military Commissions Act.
[01:02:14.513 --> 01:02:17.674]  There is no end in sight unless we wake up the populace.
[01:02:17.674 --> 01:02:19.475]  Simon, I thank you for the call.
[01:02:19.475 --> 01:02:30.439]  We are now going to go to Mark Dice of markdice.com or theresistancemanifesto.com, an author, an activist, an all-around great guy.
[01:02:30.439 --> 01:02:31.319]  Mark, how you doing, man?
[01:02:31.983 --> 01:02:32.684]  Pretty good, man.
[01:02:32.684 --> 01:02:38.109]  You know, just sitting here listening to the We Are Change crew just making some good headway.
[01:02:38.109 --> 01:02:40.692]  I'm looking back at when I first had heard of Luke.
[01:02:40.692 --> 01:02:51.322]  He had won at a contest when I was doing a radio show for GCN on the best 9-11 Truth Jam video, and they had gotten out and confronted Silverstein's goons outside of New Building 7.
[01:02:52.643 --> 01:03:00.974]  Man, I tell you, just every single week they just continue to bring it and I just cannot believe the amount of headway these guys are working so hard, man.
[01:03:00.974 --> 01:03:09.784]  We need more people to just get up and get in people's faces and I just want to tip my hat to Luke and to everybody and We Are Change and just keep up the good work, guys.
[01:03:09.784 --> 01:03:11.026]  You guys are some brave...
[01:03:11.812 --> 01:03:13.193]  Brave individuals, man.
[01:03:28.527 --> 01:03:29.508]  and liberalism.
[01:03:29.508 --> 01:03:30.529]  It's the same thing.
[01:03:30.529 --> 01:03:33.252]  It's all about one thing, and that's globalism.
[01:03:33.252 --> 01:03:34.734]  It's about this new world order.
[01:03:34.734 --> 01:03:37.057]  If you don't like it, if you don't like the term, that's too bad.
[01:03:37.057 --> 01:03:38.398]  It's not my term.
[01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:39.840]  It's not Mark's term.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:44.305]  It's a term used by Bill Clinton, Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, George Bush.
[01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.252]  Gary Hart!
[01:03:46.252 --> 01:03:50.836]  You know, Jason, I want to mention something since we've got a pretty big listenership here.
[01:03:50.836 --> 01:04:06.650]  For anybody who does want to get involved but just doesn't have access to these criminals or doesn't want to get in front of a large crowd of people and start giving a speech, the one thing that's very effective is the phone mobbing, or the phone jamming as they call it.
[01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:07.831]  So I want to just put out the word.
[01:04:08.351 --> 01:04:13.812]  Let's organize a phone mob for Sean Hannity today and tomorrow and, my lord, every day if we can.
[01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:16.653]  But his show comes on in about two hours.
[01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:20.534]  And basically call into the show an article about how to do this.
[01:04:20.534 --> 01:04:23.695]  I should get it up on the resistancemanifesto.com.
[01:04:23.695 --> 01:04:26.815]  And we'll explain that a little bit later on the other side of the break.
[01:04:26.815 --> 01:04:28.096]  But let's get organized.
[01:04:28.096 --> 01:04:29.016]  Let's call into Hannity.
[01:04:29.016 --> 01:04:32.517]  Let's make every single phone call on his show today a call about 9-11 truth.
[01:04:33.715 --> 01:04:36.318]  Mark Dice, a true patriot pioneer, folks.
[01:04:36.318 --> 01:04:37.459]  He's letting you know how you can help.
[01:04:37.459 --> 01:04:39.301]  We're going to talk more about it on the other side.
[01:04:39.301 --> 01:04:40.383]  Take your calls.
[01:04:40.383 --> 01:04:41.264]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:49.775 --> 01:04:51.757]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:55.360]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.822]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:04:57.822 --> 01:05:00.865]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:05:00.865 --> 01:05:06.590]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:10.514]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:05:10.834 --> 01:05:16.035]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[01:05:16.035 --> 01:05:19.076]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[01:05:47.905 --> 01:05:49.867]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:05:49.867 --> 01:05:52.108]  USCivilFlags.org is here to help America.
[01:05:52.128 --> 01:05:52.348]  I'm good.
[01:06:09.315 --> 01:06:14.857]  Show your support for a return to traditional moral values by flying one of these great flags today!
[01:06:14.857 --> 01:06:18.939]  Standard flags are 3 by 5 feet with miniature flags also available.

[01:06:35.726 --> 01:06:40.534]  So visit us online today to pick up your piece of history at uscivilflags.org.

[01:06:43.038 --> 01:06:43.218]  That's 646-498-5309.
[01:06:49.841 --> 01:06:52.942]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:58.463]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:58.463 --> 01:07:04.184]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:05.664]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:07:05.664 --> 01:07:14.666]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:07:14.986 --> 01:07:16.808]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:07:16.808 --> 01:07:21.033]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[01:07:50.678 --> 01:07:53.361]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:53.361 --> 01:08:02.071]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:02.071 --> 01:08:03.253]  And we are back, folks.
[01:08:03.253 --> 01:08:06.516]  It is the Alex Jones Show on the 24th of April.
[01:08:06.516 --> 01:08:07.577]  This Thursday.
[01:08:07.577 --> 01:08:08.579]  I am Jason Bermas.
[01:08:09.711 --> 01:08:18.435]  In for Alex Jones, and you know, Mark was talking about if you don't want to be, you know, We Are Change, if you can't do what Luke Rudowsky does so well, there are other ways.
[01:08:18.435 --> 01:08:29.980]  You can get on the phone, you can be online for an hour and wait to ask Sean Hannity a real question, wait to ask Bill O'Reilly a real question, wait to ask Rush Limbaugh a real question.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:31.560]  And there, it's not just the Republican side.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.182]  You need to go after some of these supposed Democrats too, you know.
[01:08:35.786 --> 01:08:38.827]  Uh, the guys over at Scarborough, you know, let's get those guys.
[01:08:38.827 --> 01:08:40.488]  They're kind of pseudo-Republicans.
[01:08:40.488 --> 01:08:44.830]  Tucker Carlson's another, you know, he presents himself as a libertarian, but he's garbage.
[01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:46.191]  All these guys have radio shows.
[01:08:46.191 --> 01:08:47.592]  They're not just on the television.
[01:08:47.592 --> 01:08:48.372]  And it's a lot more...
[01:08:49.282 --> 01:08:52.203]  Uh, easy to penetrate them through that.
[01:08:52.203 --> 01:08:56.985]  And if you can't do that, I gotta tell you, uh, there's a huge Wikipedia page about loose change.
[01:08:56.985 --> 01:09:00.967]  Now, nobody has laid out loose change final cut in this Wikipedia page yet.
[01:09:00.967 --> 01:09:02.668]  It's all about the second edition.
[01:09:02.668 --> 01:09:04.389]  There's about 150 sources.
[01:09:04.389 --> 01:09:08.030]  I'd like to see somebody go on that page and write about the final cut.
[01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:12.452]  Go through point by point the evidence that's presented in there, because this is an airtight film.
[01:09:12.452 --> 01:09:18.575]  I mean, we proved beyond a reasonable doubt that not only were we lied to about 9-11, but the powers that be covered it up
[01:09:19.517 --> 01:09:25.882]  And then used it to invade two sovereign nations and really declare a war on the American people, Mark.
[01:09:25.882 --> 01:09:34.068]  And we're still under that jackboot, if you will, of the Patriot Act, of the Military Commissions Act, the end of habeas corpus in this country.
[01:09:34.068 --> 01:09:38.912]  And they continue to take more away, and they continue to impose their will, man.
[01:09:38.912 --> 01:09:41.254]  And I really do believe that the only way
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.123]  That we're gonna win this thing is to get information out to people, to do things like you've done.
[01:09:46.123 --> 01:09:52.126]  Like one of the... I'm sitting here watching them edit this new film, The 9-11 Chronicles, which you have a prominent role in, Mark.
[01:09:52.126 --> 01:09:56.029]  And you're sitting in a packed library in a college.
[01:09:56.029 --> 01:09:57.850]  Everybody's quiet.
[01:09:57.850 --> 01:09:59.411]  And you just... Well, why don't you tell them?
[01:09:59.411 --> 01:09:59.791]  What do you do?
[01:10:01.388 --> 01:10:26.739]  Well, you can check the video out on YouTube, just search for me on YouTube, but I just kind of pretended to be a student that was doing some research on the Internet, and to my shock and dismay, I discovered that Operation Northwoods existed, and, you know, like any ordinary person would, that discovered such a thing, I was just shocked, and I just couldn't contain my disgust, you know, in the quiet
[01:10:27.219 --> 01:10:27.979]  Quiet Library.
[01:10:27.979 --> 01:10:30.600]  You know, I want to touch back on this phone mob.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:33.380]  I really think that this is a great, a great idea.
[01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:42.342]  And I know that there's a lot of people out there that have tried to call one of these shows and they get frustrated because they hit redial for 10 or 15 minutes and then just feel like they can't get through.
[01:10:42.342 --> 01:10:54.284]  So let me just let out my secret here that this is how it's done and I think it would be a great idea if we could just mob the show with 10, 20 callers today who get through today and tomorrow on the Sean Hannity Show.
[01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:55.764]  Let's really send these clowns a message.
[01:10:56.164 --> 01:10:57.024]  And here's how it's done.
[01:10:57.024 --> 01:11:03.067]  Instead of just calling in, you know, 15-20 minutes into the show, an hour into the show, you have to have the phone number ready.
[01:11:03.067 --> 01:11:07.829]  You have to call into the show about 5 minutes before the show even goes to air.
[01:11:07.829 --> 01:11:20.355]  So, look up the phone number or go to my site, and I have most of the phone numbers for most of the big shots, and start calling into the show about 5 or 10 minutes before the show even goes to air, and just let it ring and ring and ring.
[01:11:20.755 --> 01:11:39.523]  And then sooner or later, the call screener will pick it up, you feed them some bogus topic, take one of the main topics of the day and just have an opinion on it, they'll put you on hold, and then that way, maybe 30 minutes, an hour into the show, Hannity will go to your call, and they'll say, let's go to Jason in Austin, Texas!
[01:11:39.523 --> 01:11:42.864]  And they just fire away with your real question and your real topic.
[01:11:42.864 --> 01:11:50.207]  They have no idea who you are, you just have some comment about Clinton winning the Pennsylvania primary, or have some comment about
[01:11:51.082 --> 01:12:08.731]  You know, Barack Obama, or say you used to be a liberal, but now you've been listening to Hannity, and you think you're coming around, and then as soon as he goes to your question, you can hear this funny little sound in the phone, and they'll just say, let's go to so-and-so in whatever city you're in, and just fire it away.
[01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:13.013]  And if you plug a website, they're going to use the seven-second delay so your call is probably going to be wasted.
[01:12:13.013 --> 01:12:17.675]  So just bring up an issue, and let's have statements pre-planned, let's have questions,
[01:12:18.295 --> 01:12:24.720]  And let's just fill his phone board full of questions and comments about 9-11 truth.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.402]  Let's ask him, have you seen Luz change Final Cut?
[01:12:27.402 --> 01:12:29.584]  How do you explain Operation Northwood?
[01:12:29.584 --> 01:12:32.946]  Any question that you can think of, let's really send these clowns a message.
[01:12:32.946 --> 01:12:38.350]  And that's the key how to do it, because if you call in halfway through the show, he's given out the phone numbers.
[01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:39.691]  Do you have a question or a comment?
[01:12:39.691 --> 01:12:40.972]  Give me a call at 1-800-SeanHannity.
[01:12:42.753 --> 01:12:43.814]  You're never going to get through.
[01:12:43.814 --> 01:12:46.058]  The phone lines are going to be busy forever.
[01:12:46.058 --> 01:12:50.625]  So you have to call in before the show goes to air, get the phone numbers, get the time.
[01:12:50.625 --> 01:12:56.535]  So he goes to air in about an hour and 45 minutes, so before this broadcast comes to an end.
[01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:59.372]  I suggest everybody get their phone ready.
[01:12:59.372 --> 01:13:00.212]  Get the phone number.
[01:13:00.212 --> 01:13:01.153]  It's on my site.
[01:13:01.153 --> 01:13:02.194]  Just Google Sean Hannity.
[01:13:02.194 --> 01:13:03.935]  Go to his home page.
[01:13:03.935 --> 01:13:05.577]  I think he's got the phone number there.
[01:13:05.577 --> 01:13:14.984]  And if you can, do it on a landline with a speakerphone, because you'll be on hold for a half an hour, an hour sometimes, and it can be really annoying sitting there with a phone on your ear.
[01:13:14.984 --> 01:13:17.286]  So what I do when I've done this is I sit at my desk.
[01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:21.993]  I call in on my landline, I put it on speakerphone, I'm surfing the internet, I'm doing other things.
[01:13:21.993 --> 01:13:32.017]  As soon as he says, let's go back to our phones, let's go to Mark in San Diego, then I just pick up the phone so I'm not on speakerphone anymore so that it sounds clear, and I just ask him about a particular issue.
[01:13:32.017 --> 01:13:44.943]  That's how it's done, and if you don't want to risk getting in these clown spaces and these criminal spaces, if you just can't do that, you can speak to millions and millions of people instead of just
[01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:48.953]  You know, handing out DVDs at a local school or in your community.
[01:13:48.953 --> 01:13:50.975]  Just imagine one phone call.
[01:13:50.975 --> 01:13:53.297]  You can speak to millions of people.
[01:13:53.297 --> 01:13:55.059]  I've had people email me.
[01:13:55.877 --> 01:13:56.978]  Uh, that they have heard me.
[01:13:56.978 --> 01:13:58.680]  People who had no idea who I was.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:06.989]  And then after Googling Bohemian Grove and Operation Northwoods, they've emailed me and they said, dude, I heard you calling the Sean Hannity or Michael Savage show six months ago.
[01:14:06.989 --> 01:14:07.910]  I thought you were crazy.
[01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:08.591]  I found your site.
[01:14:08.591 --> 01:14:09.592]  I think it's great.
[01:14:09.592 --> 01:14:10.372]  So let's do it.
[01:14:10.372 --> 01:14:12.995]  Let's phone mob these criminals every day.
[01:14:12.995 --> 01:14:14.237]  That's how it's done.
[01:14:14.237 --> 01:14:17.260]  Let's cause them to put a caller ID system
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.061]  Folks, you have your marching orders from a man who practices what he preaches.
[01:14:20.061 --> 01:14:22.021]  Mark Dice has been doing this for a long time.
[01:14:22.021 --> 01:14:22.901]  When did you get started, Mark?
[01:14:44.590 --> 01:15:04.405]  Man, you know, I was a latecomer, and I was a right-wing Republican, and before I had the time to take a step back and really look at what was going on, it was late 2004 when I really started figuring it out, and I was doing research on the Vera chip.
[01:15:06.072 --> 01:15:14.275]  Pretty interested in the technology aspect of the New World Order and a big brother, and I was familiar with 1984 and how technology was going to enslave us.
[01:15:14.275 --> 01:15:16.516]  That's how I came across Alex Jones.
[01:15:16.516 --> 01:15:20.297]  I found a video on the file-sharing network that he had done about Verichip.
[01:15:20.297 --> 01:15:24.799]  I had found some other videos about him, and I was just so shocked.
[01:15:24.799 --> 01:15:35.463]  And at that time, it was very scary and dangerous to speak out about such a thing, and people would think that you were literally mentally ill if you were to bring up such issues.
[01:15:36.161 --> 01:15:48.505]  And now, you know, almost everybody that I talk to, at least, if they don't believe it, they say, well, you know, I've either heard of that, or most people now are saying, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised, I haven't looked into it that much, because not everybody has a lot of time.
[01:15:48.505 --> 01:15:58.088]  We're very busy people, and I had a job that had a lot of free time on it, so my co-workers and I could do some research on the job, and wait hours and hours.
[01:15:58.088 --> 01:15:59.129]  I think we just lost Mark Dice.
[01:15:59.129 --> 01:16:00.149]  Oh, no, you're back, Mark.
[01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.829]  Mark, you there?
[01:16:00.829 --> 01:16:01.410]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:02.390]  I'm sorry, we lost you for a second.
[01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:02.650]  Go ahead.
[01:16:03.516 --> 01:16:12.605]  Well, I had a lot of free time on a job, and then my co-workers and I would research this, and then the company that I was working for closed and went out of business.
[01:16:12.605 --> 01:16:16.268]  And I was in between jobs for about nine months, and that's when I wrote the manifesto.
[01:16:16.268 --> 01:16:18.751]  So I did nothing for about six months.
[01:16:19.704 --> 01:16:24.507]  But sit up until 2 or 3 in the morning every night and research and write.
[01:16:24.507 --> 01:16:31.991]  I kind of wrote the manifesto as a research paper for myself and for others, because I was coming across this.
[01:16:31.991 --> 01:16:36.254]  And when you do a research paper and you're typing it, you yourself are learning.
[01:16:36.254 --> 01:16:40.256]  So I've documented it for myself and to share with other people.
[01:16:40.256 --> 01:16:44.459]  And if you want to copy the manifesto, it's almost out of print, so go and get it soon.
[01:16:45.754 --> 01:16:53.196]  But, man, I just can't express how frustrated, you know, I was when I first came across this.
[01:16:53.196 --> 01:17:00.658]  And that's why I just bust out of the gate and just, with every ounce of energy that I had, and every breath that I had, tried to make this aware.
[01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:06.280]  And it's people like you, and it's people like Luke, and it's people like this audience that have felt that same way.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:12.641]  That I think, and you know, we've talked about this off-air, Jason, that have, I think, has prevented another false-leg attack from happening.
[01:17:12.641 --> 01:17:14.302]  Because if anything happens now,
[01:17:15.104 --> 01:17:30.471]  They're going to, the people I believe are going to rise up and even if it is a lone nut that has no connection to MKUltra or to any group of the New World Order Illuminati complex, I do believe that anything that happens
[01:17:31.215 --> 01:17:32.496]  The public aren't going to stand for it.
[01:17:32.496 --> 01:17:33.496]  They've heard this.
[01:17:33.496 --> 01:17:35.857]  Their friends have been beating this into their heads.
[01:17:35.857 --> 01:17:40.540]  I mean, Jesse Ventura's own son brought loose change attention to him.
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:52.026]  Michael Smirconis, this other neocon host that fills in for Sean Hannity, his own son mentioned that he had brought up loose change at the dinner table.
[01:17:52.026 --> 01:17:54.427]  So everybody knows, and we just need to keep it up.
[01:17:54.427 --> 01:17:57.889]  And like my dad says, the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
[01:17:57.889 --> 01:17:59.450]  So let's just continue to squeak.
[01:18:00.127 --> 01:18:01.236]  I totally agree with you there.
[01:18:01.855 --> 01:18:08.417]  And what I think we need to do is just continue to hand out DVDs, continue to be WeAreChange.
[01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:11.138]  TruthAction.org does something on the 11th of every month.
[01:18:11.138 --> 01:18:19.020]  There is really no excuse to get involved other than slothfulness and laziness and fear.
[01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:22.001]  And for me, I can't live in fear.
[01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:26.243]  I got nothing but love in my heart and I really do believe that love can overcome.
[01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.883]  I mean, I love my freedoms.
[01:18:27.883 --> 01:18:28.883]  I love my country.
[01:18:28.883 --> 01:18:30.264]  I love my family.
[01:18:30.264 --> 01:18:30.924]  And if I want to
[01:18:31.886 --> 01:18:37.690]  Maintain what they're allowing me to have at this point, because we don't have all the same rights, you know?
[01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:39.230]  They can come down and quote us.
[01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:40.531]  We have to fight this.
[01:18:40.531 --> 01:18:43.073]  We have to fight this.
[01:18:43.073 --> 01:18:44.334]  We have to get geared up.
[01:18:44.334 --> 01:18:45.794]  We have to be pumped up.
[01:18:45.794 --> 01:18:47.375]  We have to share the websites.
[01:18:47.375 --> 01:18:49.397]  We have to call into these other shows.
[01:18:49.397 --> 01:18:54.280]  It's not just about preaching to the choir, which I'm probably doing with this audience, you know?
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.541]  It's about reaching out to other people.
[01:18:57.210 --> 01:19:02.940]  I mean, I just got myself a new place out here in Austin while I'm gonna be here in, uh, you know, for about a month or whatever.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.444]  And, uh, I just met my cousin for the very first time.
[01:19:05.444 --> 01:19:08.669]  I met him when he was like six weeks old and I was like six or seven years old.
[01:19:08.976 --> 01:19:20.321]  And he's 19, he's a UT student, and, uh, it was just this weekend, and we're driving through, uh, Austin, Texas, and he's pointing out the buildings, and he goes to me, oh, look, there's the Owl Building!
[01:19:20.321 --> 01:19:24.583]  And I go, right away, it clicks in my head, the Owl Building, well, how does he know about that?
[01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:28.685]  And I ask him about the Owl Building, and he doesn't think it's, you know, what I know it is.
[01:19:28.685 --> 01:19:30.346]  Uh, Mark, you gonna stay with us for one more segment?
[01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:31.551]  Awesome.
[01:19:31.551 --> 01:19:35.753]  Alright, we're going to be back one more segment with Mark Dice, then we're going to go to your calls.
[01:19:35.753 --> 01:19:37.314]  It is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:38.334]  I am Jason Burmess.
[01:19:38.334 --> 01:19:39.055]  Thanks for tuning in.
[01:19:39.055 --> 01:19:50.280]  We'll be back after this!
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.761]  It is a big idea.
[01:19:52.761 --> 01:19:54.521]  A new world order.
[01:19:54.521 --> 01:19:55.442]  In the near future.
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:19:59.402]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:19:59.402 --> 01:20:02.224]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:20:02.224 --> 01:20:05.025]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:20:05.025 --> 01:20:08.207]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:20:08.207 --> 01:20:15.512]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:20:18.547 --> 01:20:23.991]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:27.873]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:20:27.873 --> 01:20:30.435]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:20:30.435 --> 01:20:31.596]  Most people have no idea.
[01:20:31.596 --> 01:20:32.376]  They're not after money.
[01:20:32.376 --> 01:20:33.657]  They have all the money they need.
[01:20:33.657 --> 01:20:34.638]  They're after power.
[01:20:34.638 --> 01:20:35.799]  That's their aphrodisiac.

[01:21:58.908 --> 01:22:00.669]  America, freedom to fascism.

[01:24:23.807 --> 01:24:24.508]  15 cents a day.
[01:24:24.508 --> 01:24:30.152]  I mean, for the week, you still couldn't even buy a cup of coffee with what they're charging for this.
[01:24:30.152 --> 01:24:31.213]  I think it's like $2.17 across the street.
[01:24:32.848 --> 01:24:33.888]  It's just an incredible deal.
[01:24:33.888 --> 01:24:35.649]  You can see my pretty face in the fourth hour.
[01:24:35.649 --> 01:24:38.589]  I'm going to be having the Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth on.
[01:24:38.589 --> 01:24:41.930]  And you can go to Infowars and check out Washington, You're Fired.
[01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:44.211]  Now this film, you're thinking, oh, this is a new guy.
[01:24:44.211 --> 01:24:45.091]  This is William Lewis.
[01:24:45.091 --> 01:24:46.191]  I've never heard of him before.
[01:24:46.191 --> 01:24:52.593]  Well, actually, he edited both of Davon Kleist's pictures, In Plain Sight and Ripple Effect.
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:57.721]  Mark, you and I off the air probably about a month ago were talking about what a talented editor he is.
[01:24:57.721 --> 01:24:59.041]  I have not seen Washington.
[01:24:59.041 --> 01:24:59.882]  You're fired.
[01:24:59.882 --> 01:25:05.323]  But it's asking the questions, was Bush using the NSA to spy on Americans before September 11th?
[01:25:05.323 --> 01:25:06.283]  Yes.
[01:25:06.283 --> 01:25:12.025]  And if so, why didn't the Bush administration connect the dots and stop the attacks from occurring?
[01:25:12.025 --> 01:25:14.685]  Well, any of our listeners know why they didn't connect the dots.
[01:25:14.685 --> 01:25:21.607]  It's because not only were they criminally complicit in the funding of the attack, they were also criminally complicit
[01:25:21.929 --> 01:25:24.930]  In the actual operational arm of 9-11.
[01:25:24.930 --> 01:25:26.331]  All the evidence shows it, folks.
[01:25:26.331 --> 01:25:31.833]  I mean, they're running drills of hijacked aircraft hitting buildings that morning out of the National Reconnaissance Office at 845.
[01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:34.614]  It's ridiculous.
[01:25:34.614 --> 01:25:47.320]  It's unbelievable, really, that we have been led down this road of 19 radical Islamists basically having NORAD stand down and changing our entire foreign and domestic policy in this country.
[01:25:48.323 --> 01:25:51.026]  Mark, you're working on a new project.
[01:25:51.026 --> 01:25:54.690]  I don't want to give anything away, but when do you think this new project is going to be done?
[01:25:54.690 --> 01:25:57.453]  When do you think you're going to be announcing it?
[01:25:57.453 --> 01:25:59.516]  I'm thinking probably by the end of the summer.
[01:25:59.516 --> 01:26:01.978]  It's basically been done and ready to roll.
[01:26:01.978 --> 01:26:09.206]  Just my recent problems with the IRS have delayed the publication.
[01:26:10.287 --> 01:26:26.359]  You know, if you're going to fight the taxes, maybe the best thing to do is to educate others instead of just not paying your taxes, because I basically have said for years to screw you to the IRS, and then they came back and said, no, no, screw you.
[01:26:26.359 --> 01:26:34.746]  And so the new project, it's been something that I was working on for many, many years, just as a kind of a
[01:26:35.703 --> 01:26:44.469]  A personal inquest, and I kind of set it aside to release the manifesto and to study the New World Order and to get information out.
[01:26:44.469 --> 01:26:54.397]  And it's not directly involved with 9-11 or the New World Order, but I think that much of the audience is going to appreciate it and will benefit from it and will find it
[01:26:55.809 --> 01:26:56.029]  I think so.
[01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.375]  I had a comment about the FLDS raid.
[01:27:46.798 --> 01:28:11.939]  I don't understand their reasoning for doing that except to send a message to all of us citizens and I think we need to help them in their defense because I don't give my children vaccinations and so they won't be able to attend public school because the religious waivers are not being upheld everywhere anymore.
[01:28:12.702 --> 01:28:14.503]  Which is ridiculous and criminal, by the way.
[01:28:14.503 --> 01:28:18.325]  There's no reason you should be shooting your kids with poison.
[01:28:18.325 --> 01:28:27.609]  Yes, my sister-in-law has gotten calls from the Child Protective Service by trying to use her religious waiver.
[01:28:27.609 --> 01:28:31.171]  And she has all boys, and so it's really dangerous for her.
[01:28:32.248 --> 01:28:38.669]  Well, they've now made it illegal to homeschool your children in California unless you are a licensed teacher.
[01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:39.729]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:44.630]  They are really trying to indoctrinate our children at this point at a whole new level.
[01:28:44.630 --> 01:28:58.273]  Yes, my sister-in-law was looking into homeschooling her children when she got the call from the Child Protective Services and they told her that she couldn't do that unless she had a two-year teaching certificate.
[01:28:58.273 --> 01:29:00.293]  And since her children are really small,
[01:29:01.278 --> 01:29:02.502]  Only one is school age.
[01:29:02.502 --> 01:29:07.416]  She has no way to go to school to get that teaching certificate right now.
[01:29:08.379 --> 01:29:16.845]  So it's like stuck between a rock and a hard place, and I really see them using this to come and get my kids next, you know?
[01:29:16.845 --> 01:29:20.387]  Daisy, I feel for you and I totally agree, and you know, keep fighting.
[01:29:20.387 --> 01:29:21.768]  Don't poison your children.
[01:29:21.768 --> 01:29:23.329]  Educate them in the right way.
[01:29:23.329 --> 01:29:24.630]  I thank you for the call, Mark.
[01:29:24.630 --> 01:29:28.372]  I thank you for so much for being on with me for a half an hour.
[01:29:28.372 --> 01:29:30.253]  Theresistancemanifesto.com.
[01:29:30.253 --> 01:29:31.734]  Anything else you want to say, quick?
[01:29:31.734 --> 01:29:34.636]  Let's do the phone mob information's posted now on how to do it.
[01:29:34.636 --> 01:29:35.357]  You heard it here.
[01:29:35.357 --> 01:29:36.257]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:36.257 --> 01:29:37.018]  We'll be back after this.
[01:29:40.427 --> 01:29:44.359]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:44.359 --> 01:29:47.048]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:50.566 --> 01:30:51.727]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[01:30:51.727 --> 01:30:54.248]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[01:30:54.248 --> 01:30:57.290]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[01:30:57.290 --> 01:30:58.050]  is a real thing.
[01:30:58.050 --> 01:31:05.055]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[01:31:05.055 --> 01:31:16.061]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites, TB, and it kills fleshy bacteria, MRSA, Acinetobacter infections that ravage our everyday health.
[01:31:16.061 --> 01:31:19.243]  Taken daily, it removes these stealth pathogens, clearing our bodies
[01:31:19.603 --> 01:31:20.424]  We're good to go.
[01:31:49.803 --> 01:31:51.864]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:31:51.864 --> 01:31:55.165]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:31:55.165 --> 01:32:00.126]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:32:00.126 --> 01:32:03.027]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:32:03.027 --> 01:32:09.849]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:32:10.069 --> 01:32:16.075]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:32:16.075 --> 01:32:18.198]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:32:18.198 --> 01:32:22.482]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:32:22.482 --> 01:32:27.067]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong.
[01:32:27.267 --> 01:32:33.910]  That they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:39.193]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:32:39.193 --> 01:32:42.455]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[01:32:42.455 --> 01:32:42.995]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:32:42.995 --> 01:32:44.656]  That's 888-USE-SFR1 today!
[01:33:06.873 --> 01:33:13.536]  So much going on, so much going on.
[01:33:13.536 --> 01:33:17.718]  So many things going on in the world.
[01:33:17.718 --> 01:33:21.740]  Babies dying, mothers crying.
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:28.644]  How much all is one human life worth.
[01:33:28.644 --> 01:33:30.765]  And what happened to peace?
[01:33:35.424 --> 01:33:37.225]  Everything that they tell us.
[01:33:37.225 --> 01:33:40.886]  They're gonna kill us.
[01:33:40.886 --> 01:33:44.967]  We better kill them first.
[01:33:44.967 --> 01:33:47.807]  But I remember a commandment.
[01:33:47.807 --> 01:33:50.168]  Thou shall not kill.
[01:33:50.168 --> 01:33:53.329]  How much is that soldier's life worth?
[01:33:53.329 --> 01:34:01.031]  And what happened to peace on earth?
[01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:03.772]  And the people of earth still believe it.
[01:34:06.493 --> 01:34:22.478]  How much is a liar's word worth?
[01:34:22.478 --> 01:34:25.799]  Well, folks, it ain't worth much.
[01:34:25.799 --> 01:34:29.720]  And I gotta tell you, the people that run our government, they're criminals.
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:32.120]  They don't care about you.
[01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.161]  They don't depend on their government salary.
[01:34:34.693 --> 01:34:37.795]  It's not a government for and by the people anymore.
[01:34:37.795 --> 01:34:44.801]  These people are part of privatized corporations, are owned by the lobbyists, are owned by the corporations in many instances.
[01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:48.984]  They're not only millionaires, they're billionaires.
[01:34:48.984 --> 01:34:55.329]  When was the last time a billionaire cared about you and your $30,000 a year job?
[01:34:55.329 --> 01:34:56.850]  Other than to control you.
[01:34:56.850 --> 01:34:57.690]  Okay?
[01:34:57.690 --> 01:34:58.571]  They don't.
[01:34:58.571 --> 01:34:59.752]  You know, that's what I tell people.
[01:34:59.752 --> 01:35:03.595]  You know, I remember being out in San Francisco for the
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:07.023]  A little tea party event that they had over there.
[01:35:07.023 --> 01:35:10.406]  And I'm talking to a Christian who was with his girlfriend.
[01:35:10.406 --> 01:35:13.250]  And, uh, you know, he's talking, well, what about Huckabee?
[01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:14.971]  And I'm like, Huckabee's CFR.
[01:35:14.971 --> 01:35:16.533]  That's Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:35:16.533 --> 01:35:17.795]  He's a globalist.
[01:35:17.795 --> 01:35:20.097]  He doesn't believe in nationalism.
[01:35:20.097 --> 01:35:22.420]  Came out of, uh, Arkansas where Clinton was.
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:24.362]  I'm like, you really trust that guy?
[01:35:25.177 --> 01:35:27.718]  I'm like, the real Christian candidate is Ron Paul.
[01:35:27.718 --> 01:35:28.978]  He's an actual Christian.
[01:35:28.978 --> 01:35:32.680]  He's actually been with his wife for, I think, something like close to 50 years.
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:33.640]  He's got a huge family.
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.861]  He practices what he preaches.
[01:35:35.861 --> 01:35:41.763]  You know, he believes in the Constitution and Bill of Rights and hard currency, and he is looking out for the little guy.
[01:35:41.763 --> 01:35:43.724]  How come you're not talking about Ron Paul?
[01:35:43.724 --> 01:35:44.264]  Mike Huckabee.
[01:35:44.264 --> 01:35:46.004]  I'll tell you why you're talking about Mike Huckabee.
[01:35:46.004 --> 01:35:51.766]  It's because they put him on the cover of magazines, they promote him on CNN, and you own a TV like Willie Nelson says.
[01:35:51.766 --> 01:35:53.327]  The TV tells us what to do.
[01:35:54.312 --> 01:36:04.560]  You know, truer words were never spoken in that film, Network, where, you know, the tube tells us how to dress, the tube tells us how to act, the tube tells us what to like.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.222]  Well, I'm done with it.
[01:36:06.222 --> 01:36:07.042]  All right?
[01:36:07.042 --> 01:36:13.668]  I'm not saying just totally and completely shut off your TV, but you need to discern what kind of information they're giving you.
[01:36:13.668 --> 01:36:14.369]  All right?
[01:36:14.369 --> 01:36:23.376]  Because the mainstream is trying to mainline you into this globalist agenda, where they take your kids, they take your rights, you're a ward of the state,
[01:36:24.089 --> 01:36:26.131]  You know, you're under UN law.
[01:36:26.131 --> 01:36:27.552]  I mean, look at the European Union.
[01:36:27.552 --> 01:36:31.735]  It starts out as a trade agreement and now they're building a constitution.
[01:36:31.735 --> 01:36:32.575]  Okay?
[01:36:32.575 --> 01:36:33.936]  It's not just about trade, folks.
[01:36:33.936 --> 01:36:35.337]  We need to wake up.
[01:36:35.337 --> 01:36:38.519]  So in this last half an hour, we're going to just keep banging out to calls.
[01:36:38.519 --> 01:36:44.804]  And I'm going to get to this article about machine gun toting officers to patrol New York City subway.
[01:36:44.804 --> 01:36:48.707]  You no longer have a Fourth Amendment in New York if you go into the subway.
[01:36:48.707 --> 01:36:51.449]  And I know I confused the Fourth and Fifth Amendments earlier.
[01:36:51.449 --> 01:36:53.110]  The Fourth Amendment is
[01:36:54.477 --> 01:36:59.561]  The right to probable cause for search and seizure and the Fifth Amendment is the right to due process.
[01:36:59.561 --> 01:37:01.062]  I apologize for that.
[01:37:01.062 --> 01:37:15.273]  But, uh, you go down to New York City and you go through and, you know, a lot of the time you'll see just regular military guys, you know, working for the National Guard, and they'll come up to you and you do have the choice to say no, but you've already paid for your subway token, okay?
[01:37:15.273 --> 01:37:17.294]  And you're already waiting on the subway.
[01:37:17.294 --> 01:37:19.015]  And if they want to look in your bag, they're going to.
[01:37:19.015 --> 01:37:23.879]  And if you say no, you can leave the subway, but it's not like they're not gonna eye you or tail you or
[01:37:24.895 --> 01:37:26.877]  Radio up and say, oh, this guy left.
[01:37:26.877 --> 01:37:28.898]  We need to search his bag.
[01:37:28.898 --> 01:37:37.084]  So, yeah, I guess now they're gonna have M4 carbine rifles and MP5 submachine guns in the subway.
[01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:41.067]  MP5 submachine guns!
[01:37:41.067 --> 01:37:41.988]  Is anybody listening?
[01:37:43.032 --> 01:37:46.413]  Okay, maybe you need to see these commercials that are running over at MTV.
[01:37:46.413 --> 01:37:48.473]  Think.MTV.com.
[01:37:48.473 --> 01:37:52.394]  There's an earlier post over at my blog at LooseChange911.com.
[01:37:52.394 --> 01:37:53.594]  Jones Reporter.
[01:37:53.594 --> 01:37:55.874]  Maybe I can get Aaron Dykes to do a story on them.
[01:37:55.874 --> 01:37:58.435]  It should really be up at JonesReporterInfoWars.com.
[01:37:58.435 --> 01:38:03.976]  But they ran two really amazing ads over there about the police state.
[01:38:03.976 --> 01:38:09.097]  And one of them, lo and behold, is in what looks like the New York City subway system.
[01:38:09.097 --> 01:38:09.977]  All these people are
[01:38:10.945 --> 01:38:15.408]  Literally in a subway car, all of a sudden the doors open, and there they are!
[01:38:15.408 --> 01:38:20.491]  The soldiers and the police officers with submachine guns!
[01:38:20.491 --> 01:38:28.417]  And they just stop everybody, they separate families, they take who they want, and then it says, the Holocaust happened to people like us.
[01:38:28.417 --> 01:38:30.418]  And in truer words, we're never spoken, folks.
[01:38:30.418 --> 01:38:39.564]  The other commercial, they just go into an American family's house, they clear the house out within 30 seconds, and they put them on the back of a huge truck with other families
[01:38:40.222 --> 01:38:42.443]  To go to work or concentration camps.
[01:38:42.443 --> 01:38:44.264]  Death camps, if you will.
[01:38:44.264 --> 01:38:48.446]  And it fades out, and it's the same picture in Nazi Germany, man.
[01:38:48.446 --> 01:38:49.906]  And I'm against it.
[01:38:49.906 --> 01:38:50.567]  Alright?
[01:38:50.567 --> 01:38:51.987]  I'm not gonna go along with it.
[01:38:51.987 --> 01:38:54.549]  If you're taking me, you're taking me in a body bag.
[01:38:54.549 --> 01:38:54.789]  Alright?
[01:38:54.789 --> 01:38:56.409]  You're taking me kicking and screaming.
[01:38:56.409 --> 01:38:58.050]  I won't have it.
[01:38:58.050 --> 01:38:58.590]  Alright?
[01:38:58.590 --> 01:39:01.392]  I will not have it.
[01:39:01.392 --> 01:39:03.353]  Now we're gonna take your calls.
[01:39:03.353 --> 01:39:05.574]  Let's go to, uh, William in Florida.
[01:39:05.574 --> 01:39:06.634]  He's been holding the longest.
[01:39:06.634 --> 01:39:07.975]  William, are you with us?
[01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:08.375]  Squeak!
[01:39:09.321 --> 01:39:09.881]  Squeak!
[01:39:09.881 --> 01:39:10.902]  I'm squeaking, Jason.
[01:39:10.902 --> 01:39:11.782]  How are you today?
[01:39:11.782 --> 01:39:12.422]  I'm all right, man.
[01:39:12.422 --> 01:39:13.443]  How are you doing?
[01:39:13.443 --> 01:39:14.904]  I'm doing great.
[01:39:14.904 --> 01:39:25.048]  A little piece of the 9-11 puzzle, actually, believe it or not, from the past, to help with our partial-birth abortion of the New World Order.
[01:39:25.048 --> 01:39:26.589]  I was 10 years old.
[01:39:26.589 --> 01:39:28.430]  I'm 34 now.
[01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:32.311]  And I was going to see my brother, who was serving in the Air Force in Louisiana.
[01:39:32.311 --> 01:39:36.553]  And my mother arranged for me to sit in the cockpit and play with the controls.
[01:39:36.553 --> 01:39:37.534]  I was one of those kids.
[01:39:38.690 --> 01:39:40.812]  And I started asking questions.
[01:39:40.812 --> 01:39:44.555]  And I asked about the steel door to the cockpit.
[01:39:44.555 --> 01:39:46.277]  And I said, don't you guys suffocate in here?
[01:39:46.277 --> 01:39:49.439]  He said, no, we have food.
[01:39:49.439 --> 01:39:51.041]  We even have a place to go to the bathroom.
[01:39:51.041 --> 01:39:52.482]  And he pointed to this little closet.
[01:39:52.482 --> 01:39:54.243]  And he said, no one gets in here.
[01:39:54.243 --> 01:39:55.745]  And I said, no one?
[01:39:55.745 --> 01:40:00.769]  And I had seen enough TV shows to see hijackings and dramatizations.
[01:40:00.769 --> 01:40:01.870]  I said, what if someone
[01:40:02.901 --> 01:40:06.724]  Take a hostage and demand to get in in exchange for that person's life.
[01:40:06.724 --> 01:40:17.612]  He said, no one gets in here until the plane from the time we take off or no one gets out either until the plane lands and everyone is off of there.
[01:40:17.612 --> 01:40:19.133]  And I still remember that to this day.
[01:40:19.133 --> 01:40:25.978]  And when I was when I saw the 9-11 attack, I said, there's no way, you know, there's no way anybody got into that cockpit for any reason.
[01:40:26.837 --> 01:40:28.978]  Well, I mean, there's just so many inconsistencies with the story.
[01:40:28.978 --> 01:40:32.440]  I mean, not only that, but let's look at, uh, United 23.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:36.283]  This is going to make my new movie, Fabled Enemies, uh, for a moment.
[01:40:36.283 --> 01:40:44.248]  United 23, uh, the pilot refused to take off because he saw, uh, four or five Arab guys that he thought looked suspicious.
[01:40:44.248 --> 01:40:46.109]  He knew it was going down on the ground.
[01:40:46.109 --> 01:40:49.671]  So they evacuate the plane and these guys don't want to get off the plane.
[01:40:49.671 --> 01:40:49.891]  Okay.
[01:40:50.882 --> 01:40:54.207]  They eventually get off the plane, but then they don't stick around for their luggage.
[01:40:54.207 --> 01:40:59.976]  And lo and behold, in their luggage are these Al-Qaeda training manuals, blueprints, etc.
[01:40:59.976 --> 01:41:02.740]  Now these guys were never brought to justice, and they said, oh!
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.801]  We couldn't find them!
[01:41:03.801 --> 01:41:05.885]  It's a case of mistaken identity!
[01:41:05.885 --> 01:41:06.686]  Yet they were able...
[01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:10.463]  To, uh, find the identities of the supposed other 19.
[01:41:10.463 --> 01:41:12.964]  So apparently they didn't use false identification.
[01:41:12.964 --> 01:41:15.586]  I mean, Otta's bag is found.
[01:41:15.586 --> 01:41:22.590]  I mean, he took his will on the plane with him and somehow it didn't make it from, uh, Boston Logan Airport onto the plane.
[01:41:22.590 --> 01:41:24.231]  Red flags should be going up everywhere.
[01:41:24.231 --> 01:41:31.976]  On top of that, Time Magazine reported on the 22nd of September that they found weapons on at least three other different planes.
[01:41:31.976 --> 01:41:35.858]  The FAA initially reported that somebody got shot on one of these planes.
[01:41:36.684 --> 01:41:47.372]  Okay, so the whole box cutters jive, getting into a cockpit, and just taking over these planes, and ramming them into buildings, it does not add up to me, William.
[01:41:47.372 --> 01:41:52.716]  Yeah, it's a 10-inch thick steel door with no window and no way to get in from the outside.
[01:41:52.716 --> 01:41:54.617]  Yeah, it's crazy stuff.
[01:41:54.617 --> 01:41:56.339]  William, I thank you for the call.
[01:41:56.339 --> 01:41:57.620]  We're going to keep moving.
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:59.921]  Let's go to Kevin in Vermont.
[01:41:59.921 --> 01:42:01.623]  Kevin, are you with us?
[01:42:01.623 --> 01:42:02.223]  Yep.
[01:42:02.223 --> 01:42:03.704]  How you doing, man?
[01:42:03.704 --> 01:42:05.566]  Pretty good, but my ear is kind of sore.
[01:42:06.781 --> 01:42:09.683]  I know, I'm sorry, you've probably been on hold for about an hour, right?
[01:42:09.683 --> 01:42:11.685]  Uh, probably just about that much.
[01:42:11.685 --> 01:42:12.286]  Yep.
[01:42:12.286 --> 01:42:13.887]  So what do you want to talk about?
[01:42:13.887 --> 01:42:21.173]  Well, in regards to your earlier comment about, uh, I believe the paint job of the U.A.
[01:42:21.173 --> 01:42:23.034]  United Airlines 175?
[01:42:23.034 --> 01:42:23.775]  Yep.
[01:42:23.775 --> 01:42:36.205]  You said, like, uh, that the paint job didn't match with the original, like, normal... I'm just saying all the videos of this plane hitting the building is a great plane, and it doesn't have the blue underside or the blue engines.
[01:42:37.419 --> 01:42:54.664]  Uh, well, I'm sort of a aviation enthusiast, and so, uh, do you think come to mind, uh, uh, the description you're saying most, sounds most like the, uh, new paint job that United has started, uh, painting its aircraft in?
[01:42:54.664 --> 01:43:02.706]  Uh, it's 2001, and the plane that they actually showed as United 175, and you can get the picture of it, it's a blue underside and two blue engines.
[01:43:02.706 --> 01:43:06.507]  Well, uh, I mean, uh, today's, uh,
[01:43:08.998 --> 01:43:16.704]  Yeah, I've seen some of the new United planes.
[01:43:16.704 --> 01:43:18.465]  I actually saw one.
[01:43:18.465 --> 01:43:23.049]  I want to say it was when I was going to Irvine, California last time.
[01:43:23.049 --> 01:43:26.031]  I did see one of the ones with the gray underside and the new paint scheme.
[01:43:26.031 --> 01:43:32.215]  But again, if you look at the planes that were identified as 175 and Flight 11, they had the old paint scheme.
[01:43:32.215 --> 01:43:32.275]  Yep.
[01:43:36.468 --> 01:43:40.093]  Yeah, it was sort of commonplace at the time.
[01:43:40.093 --> 01:43:42.095]  They're still updating the planes.
[01:43:46.427 --> 01:43:47.948]  Modifying them, or so what?
[01:43:47.948 --> 01:43:50.310]  Well, I mean, you know, they're always updating the planes.
[01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:55.633]  It's like the people that argue that cell phone calls could be made at 30,000 feet.
[01:43:55.633 --> 01:44:02.397]  Well, in Europe, they just made it legal to make cell phone calls on planes, and they had to put in transmitters.
[01:44:02.397 --> 01:44:13.663]  And in 2004, American Airlines spent tens of thousands of dollars for this technology on a few planes, you know, for their upper echelon customers, so they could make, you know, phone calls at 30,000 feet.
[01:44:13.663 --> 01:44:14.764]  Cell phone calls don't work.
[01:44:15.239 --> 01:44:16.420]  At 30,000 feet.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:26.426]  I've been in planes and I've tried to get signals and I'll admit that maybe at like somewhere between 7 and 15,000 feet you get a somewhat signal in and out.
[01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:35.291]  I mean it might be possible for maybe a one or two ten-second calls but completely impossible at 30,000 feet.
[01:44:35.291 --> 01:44:39.833]  I feel like there's just so many anomalies involving the planes themselves.
[01:44:39.833 --> 01:44:41.875]  I got another one for you.
[01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:42.195]  One of my
[01:44:42.901 --> 01:44:46.142]  One of the books that I have about 9-11, it's just a simple one.
[01:44:46.142 --> 01:44:52.364]  9-11 revealed and it's about to, by Roland Morgan and Ian Henschel.
[01:44:52.364 --> 01:45:04.287]  One thing that they mention is that this is shortly after they supposedly lose contact with Flight 175.
[01:45:04.287 --> 01:45:07.848]  And I'll just read from the text.
[01:45:07.848 --> 01:45:09.588]  Some four minutes later, the pilot of the U.S.
[01:45:09.588 --> 01:45:12.229]  Airlines Flight 583 tells Flight Control,
[01:45:13.089 --> 01:45:20.350]  Regarding Flight 175, quote, I just picked up an ELT, Emergency Locator Transmitter, on 121.5.
[01:45:20.350 --> 01:45:23.391]  It was brief, but it went off.
[01:45:23.391 --> 01:45:24.251]  End quote.
[01:45:24.251 --> 01:45:26.791]  Control response, quote, OK.
[01:45:26.791 --> 01:45:28.552]  They said it's confirmed.
[01:45:28.552 --> 01:45:32.892]  Believe it or not, as a thing, we're not sure yet.
[01:45:32.892 --> 01:45:41.354]  And so, what I did when I read that is, I mean, aviation enthusiasts that found, and I went on to Wikipedia and checked,
[01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:59.316]  What it is is a transmitter that can only be, from my understanding, only be activated when an aircraft crashes or by the flight crew themselves following the crash.
[01:45:59.316 --> 01:46:01.238]  So, uh, what's your point here?
[01:46:01.238 --> 01:46:09.024]  Well, there may be... It just seems sort of odd or just sort of struck out at me that
[01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:34.179]  As soon as they lose contact with Flight 175, I know there's been people who've said that planes have landed at Rome Air Force Base and switched, but then there's this and 121.5, the frequency that they received it on is the normal frequency for the transmitter to transmit on.
[01:46:34.179 --> 01:46:37.681]  It just seems... Seems odd.
[01:46:37.681 --> 01:46:38.922]  Yeah, it seems odd, along with
[01:46:39.571 --> 01:46:40.791]  Well, Kevin, I'll say this.
[01:46:40.791 --> 01:46:48.474]  I mean, you look at the official version and they're saying that all four planes that were involved in the attack didn't even emit a hijack code.
[01:46:48.474 --> 01:46:48.694]  Okay?
[01:46:48.694 --> 01:47:00.217]  And then on top of that, we have other planes that supposedly had bombs on board, Delta 1989, where they followed a Korean aircraft, a Korean commercial airliner out of Alaskan airspace that they felt was hijacked.
[01:47:00.217 --> 01:47:02.478]  It admitted a hijack code twice.
[01:47:02.478 --> 01:47:02.678]  Okay?
[01:47:02.678 --> 01:47:05.259]  They also, if you listen to the newly released NORAD tape,
[01:47:05.626 --> 01:47:06.627]  We've had them since August.
[01:47:06.627 --> 01:47:10.889]  We offered them on Torrance, but now they're up on a .gov site for anybody to listen to.
[01:47:10.889 --> 01:47:13.831]  You can find out that they're following hijackings out of Canada.
[01:47:13.831 --> 01:47:19.655]  Alright, now this, to me, are all parts of the exercise, and anything from there, God knows what.
[01:47:19.655 --> 01:47:23.357]  But I do thank you for the call, and people do need to look in these anomalies of the planes.
[01:47:23.357 --> 01:47:26.959]  I mean, there's a ton of anomalies just with the planes themselves.
[01:47:26.959 --> 01:47:28.440]  Just with the hijackings.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:32.423]  Just with what the people on the ground were seeing and hearing.
[01:47:32.423 --> 01:47:32.823]  Okay?
[01:47:32.823 --> 01:47:34.664]  A lot of people like to say, oh, those drills were done.
[01:47:35.205 --> 01:47:37.606]  Those drills ended as soon as the real attacks happened.
[01:47:37.606 --> 01:47:38.887]  That is not the case.
[01:47:38.887 --> 01:47:39.887]  Listen to the tapes.
[01:47:39.887 --> 01:47:48.211]  You literally have one of the generals calling up Cheyenne Mountain after Flight 93 has been downed and saying, you need to stop putting the inputs on our screen.
[01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:50.432]  I'm going to stay on the line until it happens.
[01:47:50.432 --> 01:47:51.893]  Because they requested it several times.
[01:47:52.526 --> 01:47:54.247]  And they were more than confused.
[01:47:54.247 --> 01:47:57.549]  Again, you know, that's part of the operational arm of 9-11.
[01:47:57.549 --> 01:47:58.850]  It needs to be discussed.
[01:47:58.850 --> 01:48:12.439]  It doesn't need to be whitewashed by a commission of Richard Benveniste and all these insiders and Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean that goes on television and says that the 9-11 comic book that they put out is accurate.
[01:48:12.439 --> 01:48:13.820]  It's what happened.
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.101]  You'll see that in the new film, too.
[01:48:15.101 --> 01:48:16.321]  Makes me sick.
[01:48:16.321 --> 01:48:17.942]  Makes me disgusted.
[01:48:17.942 --> 01:48:19.303]  You know, they're not just going after us.
[01:48:19.303 --> 01:48:21.184]  They're going after our kids, man!
[01:48:21.184 --> 01:48:22.025]  It's a comic book!
[01:48:22.631 --> 01:48:23.792]  The whole thing is comical.
[01:48:23.792 --> 01:48:24.592]  I mean, they should know.
[01:48:24.592 --> 01:48:28.895]  They put out a graphic novel trying to describe the 9-11 commission report.
[01:48:28.895 --> 01:48:30.736]  You don't think that's brainwashing?
[01:48:30.736 --> 01:48:31.476]  It's disgusting.
[01:48:31.476 --> 01:48:32.397]  It's disturbing.
[01:48:32.397 --> 01:48:34.178]  It's nonsense.
[01:48:34.178 --> 01:48:44.283]  Keane admits in his book Without Precedent and in the New York Times that they took false testimony from the Pentagon and other government agencies and even thought about throwing up indictments.
[01:48:44.283 --> 01:48:45.564]  Well, why didn't you?
[01:48:45.564 --> 01:48:47.685]  Where are the indictments?
[01:48:47.685 --> 01:48:48.546]  It's unreal, man.
[01:48:49.249 --> 01:48:49.849]  Come on!
[01:48:49.849 --> 01:48:51.170]  There's no indictments?
[01:48:51.170 --> 01:48:55.132]  Nobody is charged with gross negligence on that day?
[01:48:55.132 --> 01:48:56.113]  Come on.
[01:48:56.113 --> 01:48:57.213]  At least that.
[01:48:57.213 --> 01:48:58.234]  At least that.
[01:48:58.234 --> 01:49:00.455]  At least give it the air.
[01:49:00.455 --> 01:49:02.216]  The air of truth.
[01:49:02.216 --> 01:49:04.397]  The air of a respectable investigation.
[01:49:04.397 --> 01:49:05.738]  That's not what we had.
[01:49:05.738 --> 01:49:06.218]  We all know.
[01:49:06.218 --> 01:49:09.840]  I mean, even Harper's Magazine on their cover said it was a whitewash.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.081]  Showing people going into white paint.
[01:49:11.081 --> 01:49:11.761]  And that's what it was.
[01:49:11.761 --> 01:49:13.222]  It was a whitewash.
[01:49:13.222 --> 01:49:17.064]  You're not gonna get much out of the actual 9-11 Commission report.
[01:49:17.064 --> 01:49:17.324]  Okay?
[01:49:17.324 --> 01:49:18.805]  Or the comic book that they're selling.
[01:49:19.175 --> 01:49:21.436]  But I do suggest you watch those hearings, man.
[01:49:21.436 --> 01:49:23.196]  They're very telling.
[01:49:23.196 --> 01:49:27.917]  You know, they poo-poo a lot of situations, and they cover up a lot of things.
[01:49:27.917 --> 01:49:31.738]  Zelikow... Zelikow's a good author, man.
[01:49:31.738 --> 01:49:33.199]  He spins it really well.
[01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:37.900]  You know, he likes to talk about alternate universes when he gets confronted with 9-11 truth.
[01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:38.980]  Guy makes me sick.
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:40.940]  Let's go to Mike in Maryland.
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:44.061]  Mike, are you there?
[01:49:44.061 --> 01:49:45.141]  Mike, you with me?
[01:49:45.141 --> 01:49:46.262]  Yeah, how you doing, man?
[01:49:46.262 --> 01:49:46.622]  Good, man.
[01:49:46.622 --> 01:49:47.082]  How you doing?
[01:49:47.660 --> 01:49:48.341]  I'm doing good.
[01:49:48.341 --> 01:49:50.122]  Hey, 9-11.
[01:49:50.122 --> 01:49:58.287]  My wife was at the Pentagon on 9-11, and of course I drove down to see how she was doing, because I was on the phone at the time it was hit.
[01:49:58.287 --> 01:50:01.129]  She was underground at the time that it hit.
[01:50:01.129 --> 01:50:01.949]  Okay.
[01:50:01.949 --> 01:50:05.531]  So I actually visualized and saw everything.
[01:50:05.531 --> 01:50:11.055]  I've never spoke about this, and probably never will again, I'll be honest with you.
[01:50:11.055 --> 01:50:12.216]  Okay.
[01:50:12.216 --> 01:50:13.436]  I didn't see anything.
[01:50:13.436 --> 01:50:14.177]  I did not see
[01:50:14.890 --> 01:50:18.032]  And I worked aviation when I'm retired Army.
[01:50:18.032 --> 01:50:18.833]  Okay.
[01:50:18.833 --> 01:50:21.454]  I never saw one part of a plane.
[01:50:21.454 --> 01:50:22.115]  All right, hold on, Mike.
[01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:23.896]  We're gonna come back to you on the other side.
[01:50:23.896 --> 01:50:25.197]  We're gonna discuss this.
[01:50:25.197 --> 01:50:27.618]  Because, you know, there were people on the scene we covered in the final gut.
[01:50:27.618 --> 01:50:29.619]  They couldn't believe a plane hit the Pentagon.
[01:50:29.619 --> 01:50:32.141]  They saw no debris from a plane.
[01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:33.362]  And it is suspicious.
[01:50:33.362 --> 01:50:36.544]  You know, I hate harping on the Pentagon because it's a divisive issue.
[01:50:36.544 --> 01:50:39.666]  But we're gonna hear what Mike and others have to say on the other side.
[01:50:39.666 --> 01:50:40.867]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:42.127]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[01:50:42.127 --> 01:50:42.888]  We'll be back after this.
[01:50:50.117 --> 01:51:03.281]  And now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:51:03.281 --> 01:51:14.344]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation in which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[01:51:14.344 --> 01:51:17.245]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[01:51:17.765 --> 01:51:19.506]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:25.630]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.901]  We're in a no-holds-bar information war.
[01:51:43.901 --> 01:51:50.003]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[01:51:50.003 --> 01:51:56.006]  Attention GCN listeners, would you like to watch uncensored, unregulated, even banned TV on your computer?
[01:51:56.006 --> 01:52:04.849]  Well now you can watch satellite TV on your PC with an extremely simple hookup that allows computer owners to pick up more channels than any sane person can even watch.
[01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.489]  We're good.
[01:52:24.614 --> 01:52:25.014]  I think so.
[01:52:50.171 --> 01:52:53.533]  Someday, cancer, diabetes, and poor health may disrupt your life.
[01:52:53.533 --> 01:52:56.494]  Are you going to be the one in four who gets cancer in their lifetime?
[01:52:56.494 --> 01:53:00.436]  Well, now you can set aside your worries and offset that chance with AlkaVita.
[01:53:00.436 --> 01:53:07.320]  AlkaVita is a pure elemental liquid silicon that is high in oxygen and highly alkaline to help balance our acidic lifestyles.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:13.703]  Fast food and unhealthy habits contribute to excess acid and undesirable effects that lay foundations of disease and poor health.
[01:53:13.883 --> 01:53:16.925]  Do you remember the old saying, an apple a day keeps the doctor away?
[01:53:16.925 --> 01:53:18.526]  Those words of wisdom are true.
[01:53:18.526 --> 01:53:26.250]  Your body heals itself when eating well, rather than fighting the effects of chemicals like corn syrup, sugar, preservatives, and other unpronounceable ingredients.
[01:53:26.250 --> 01:53:35.796]  Your body is the best pharmacy in the world, and with AlkaVita, it can help your body naturally neutralize excess body acid, and help hydrate your body, promoting the energized, healthier you.

[01:53:42.407 --> 01:53:42.587]  That's 800-651-4011.
[01:54:01.013 --> 01:54:04.656]  You can run on for a long time.
[01:54:04.656 --> 01:54:07.598]  Run on for a long time.
[01:54:07.598 --> 01:54:10.420]  Run on for a long time.
[01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:13.382]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:54:13.382 --> 01:54:15.844]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[01:54:18.058 --> 01:54:32.864]  Go tell that long-tongue liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back-biter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[01:54:37.881 --> 01:55:06.298]  Well my goodness crazies, let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Galilee He spoke to me with a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweet He called my name and my heart stood still When he said, John, go do my will Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider
[01:55:08.359 --> 01:55:17.046]  My boy Johnny Cash with a jam from beyond the grave.
[01:55:17.046 --> 01:55:18.207]  I love this tune, man.
[01:55:18.207 --> 01:55:21.249]  And if you haven't seen the video for it, you can check that out on YouTube.
[01:55:21.249 --> 01:55:23.191]  It's badass.
[01:55:23.191 --> 01:55:26.513]  I'm a big fan and the backbeat they put on that tune, man.
[01:55:26.513 --> 01:55:28.675]  It's just invigorating, man.
[01:55:28.675 --> 01:55:30.577]  And you know, it's an old, old tune.
[01:55:30.577 --> 01:55:33.919]  It's been sung by quite a few people, but Johnny Cash did it right.
[01:55:33.919 --> 01:55:34.840]  And I believe that, man.
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:40.402]  You know, no matter what you believe out there, I believe in good and evil, and none of us are above that.
[01:55:40.402 --> 01:55:50.346]  And we have to constantly be in check every day and try to do the right thing, and try to spread this information, and try to spread the word that we are being lied to by our government.
[01:55:50.346 --> 01:55:59.970]  That the reason that we have the Second Amendment isn't for hunting folks like Jesse Ventura said, it's to make sure that tyranny doesn't come into our home, doesn't come into our family.
[01:55:59.970 --> 01:56:03.011]  And throughout history, man, it's tyrannical governments that have done the most
[01:56:03.564 --> 01:56:03.824]  Most of
[01:56:24.933 --> 01:56:26.675]  Other people's work is Daily TV Show.
[01:56:26.675 --> 01:56:29.497]  Burn them on the disc and wake people up, man.
[01:56:29.497 --> 01:56:32.660]  Get them a DivX DVD player or one of these new media players.
[01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:35.643]  You can burn like six or seven movies onto one disc.
[01:56:35.643 --> 01:56:36.564]  Hand them out.
[01:56:36.564 --> 01:56:39.266]  You know, have people over for dinner.
[01:56:39.266 --> 01:56:40.267]  Have a DVD ready.
[01:56:40.663 --> 01:56:42.785]  You know, that's how we're going to win this thing.
[01:56:42.785 --> 01:56:47.728]  And we're talking to Mike out in Maryland about his experience on 9-11 out in the Pentagon.
[01:56:47.728 --> 01:56:49.049]  Why don't you start over for us, Mike?
[01:56:49.049 --> 01:56:50.190]  Where were you?
[01:56:50.190 --> 01:56:52.052]  You said your wife was underground at the Pentagon.
[01:56:52.052 --> 01:56:53.573]  You're a former Army officer.
[01:56:53.573 --> 01:56:55.394]  When did you actually get there?
[01:56:55.394 --> 01:56:56.055]  Yeah, correct.
[01:56:56.055 --> 01:56:56.755]  Not an officer.
[01:56:56.755 --> 01:56:58.276]  I was enlisted.
[01:56:58.276 --> 01:57:04.041]  My wife was underground because she worked communications underground at the Pentagon.
[01:57:04.041 --> 01:57:07.764]  I was on the phone with her at the time because we were talking about the Twin Towers, of course.
[01:57:09.867 --> 01:57:12.668]  Right away, she says, I'm going to have to go.
[01:57:12.668 --> 01:57:16.009]  And she did not know the Pentagon had gotten hit.
[01:57:16.009 --> 01:57:19.630]  What had happened was she had to go to a secure line.
[01:57:19.630 --> 01:57:24.612]  Because if the light flashes, that means we need to go into a secure area.
[01:57:24.612 --> 01:57:27.773]  And so she changed rooms, went into a different room.
[01:57:27.773 --> 01:57:32.294]  And she called me back in about seven minutes and said, you know, we've been hit.
[01:57:32.294 --> 01:57:33.914]  And I said, what, the Pentagon?
[01:57:33.914 --> 01:57:35.115]  That's impossible.
[01:57:35.115 --> 01:57:36.875]  And she goes, we've been hit.
[01:57:36.875 --> 01:57:37.796]  I said, I'm on my way.
[01:57:40.231 --> 01:57:42.834]  You know, traffic was just horrendous.
[01:57:42.834 --> 01:57:44.837]  But I got down there.
[01:57:44.837 --> 01:57:50.544]  What I saw was exactly what I saw was a bunker buster.
[01:57:50.544 --> 01:57:52.326]  That's the signs I saw because
[01:57:53.021 --> 01:58:03.728]  There was no... where it was hit was the only place in the Pentagon that we had just finished down there that would have maintained a hit like that.
[01:58:03.728 --> 01:58:10.772]  Mike, I'm going to hold you over for one more segment because we've got a short segment here and we're also going to be back with Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change.
[01:58:10.772 --> 01:58:13.013]  We're going to be talking about what's going on over in Colorado.
[01:58:13.013 --> 01:58:14.294]  We're going to be talking about the DNC.
[01:58:14.294 --> 01:58:15.855]  We're going to be taking your calls.
[01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:17.296]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:58:17.296 --> 01:58:18.377]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:18.377 --> 01:58:19.097]  I'm Jason Bermas.
[01:58:19.097 --> 01:58:20.078]  We'll be back after this.
[01:58:31.519 --> 01:58:35.060]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:35.060 --> 01:58:40.582]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:40.582 --> 01:58:42.003]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:42.003 --> 01:58:44.824]  A new world order.
[01:58:44.824 --> 01:58:45.764]  In the near future.
[01:58:46.644 --> 01:58:49.688]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:49.688 --> 01:58:52.531]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:58:52.531 --> 01:58:55.334]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:58:55.334 --> 01:58:58.517]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:58.517 --> 01:59:05.846]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:08.860 --> 01:59:14.304]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:14.304 --> 01:59:18.166]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:18.166 --> 01:59:20.748]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:20.748 --> 01:59:21.909]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:21.909 --> 01:59:22.689]  They're not after money.
[01:59:22.689 --> 01:59:23.970]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:24.951]  They're after power.
[01:59:24.951 --> 01:59:26.092]  That's what happens here.

[01:59:37.639 --> 01:59:38.680]  You have been warned.
[01:59:42.783 --> 01:59:45.184]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:45.184 --> 01:59:49.868]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:49.868 --> 01:59:54.671]  Media.
[01:59:54.671 --> 01:59:56.412]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:56.412 --> 01:59:58.013]  You want answers?
[01:59:58.013 --> 01:59:58.914]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.914 --> 02:00:03.737]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:03.737 --> 02:00:07.820]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.873 --> 02:00:15.094]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, we are at the top of the third hour of this global transmission.
[02:00:15.094 --> 02:00:19.775]  Again, if you miss any of this stuff, you can go to InfoWars.com and it will play on a loop.
[02:00:19.775 --> 02:00:27.097]  Remember, the next hour is not only going to be me, live in studio, but you're going to be able to see the document cam and you're going to see some video.
[02:00:27.097 --> 02:00:31.318]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, we're going to have Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth with us.
[02:00:31.318 --> 02:00:32.958]  Justin Martel, I'm a huge fan.
[02:00:32.958 --> 02:00:38.960]  This hour, we have Jonathan Ellenhoff on the line, but let's just finish up with Mike in Maryland, who is an Army
[02:00:39.616 --> 02:00:40.436]  Mike, you still with me?
[02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:09.662]  Alright, well I guess we're just going to have to move on without Mike.
[02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:18.066]  It was a very interesting call and I would have liked to get his opinion on what he saw that day, you know, as opposed to what was published later on.
[02:01:18.066 --> 02:01:28.591]  But, you know, that's the breaks and that's okay because we have Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change Colorado online and the work that they have done is simply outstanding.
[02:01:28.591 --> 02:01:35.435]  You know, from the Gary Hart interview to getting us to come out there to the upcoming stuff at the DNC, I'm just glad to know the guy.
[02:01:35.819 --> 02:01:37.821]  And I'm glad to have, you know, spent a week with him.
[02:01:37.821 --> 02:01:54.333]  He's a very intelligent young man, and if there is a group out there that does deserve a donation or your attention and your help, it is We Are Change Colorado, because they keep pushing forward, they keep moving on, and they keep putting out, you know, tons of great stuff over at TruthAlliance.net.
[02:01:54.333 --> 02:01:55.874]  Jonathan, are you there, buddy?
[02:01:55.874 --> 02:01:57.375]  How's it going, Jason?
[02:01:57.375 --> 02:01:58.116]  It's going awesome.
[02:01:58.116 --> 02:02:00.677]  I'm really psyched to have you on the show.
[02:02:00.677 --> 02:02:05.301]  And I really did want to get into what you came on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:06.408 --> 02:02:30.734]  Last week about all right, and I don't want to have any specific names, but you know this organization gets this Permit to protest at the DNC while you and other organizations have had nothing but trouble to do so and then you go to their website and they literally have a PDF file on how to build a shield and I'm not talking about a one-page PDF foot book folks
[02:02:31.152 --> 02:02:37.595]  I'm talking about like a 20-page document where they're showing you the styles, the styles of your shield.
[02:02:37.595 --> 02:02:40.157]  They're showing guys dressed up in armor.
[02:02:40.157 --> 02:02:47.560]  They're telling you to put on a football helmet or a hockey mask, to go after cameras if people are taping.
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.841]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[02:02:48.841 --> 02:02:50.762]  That's not how it's done!
[02:02:50.762 --> 02:02:52.583]  The camera is our friend!
[02:02:52.583 --> 02:02:55.324]  It is our ally in the Info War.
[02:02:55.324 --> 02:02:56.845]  It shows what's really going on.
[02:02:57.893 --> 02:02:58.393]  Okay?
[02:02:58.393 --> 02:03:04.497]  And these tactics are the same tactics they used in Seattle at the WTO.
[02:03:04.497 --> 02:03:14.383]  And we know, we now know, that was a government op to squelch dissent, to bring in provocateurs, to hold them up, and to take away our free speech.
[02:03:14.383 --> 02:03:15.264]  And I'm not gonna have it!
[02:03:15.828 --> 02:03:18.571]  See, they know now that we're hip to their tricks.
[02:03:18.571 --> 02:03:20.633]  That it's not about Democrat or Republican.
[02:03:20.633 --> 02:03:21.814]  It's about both.
[02:03:21.814 --> 02:03:23.076]  And they're both criminal.
[02:03:23.076 --> 02:03:27.620]  You really think Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama are gonna save us?
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:28.922]  They're disgusting people, folks.
[02:03:28.922 --> 02:03:30.383]  They're not here for you and me.
[02:03:30.383 --> 02:03:32.025]  They're here for the special interests.
[02:03:32.025 --> 02:03:37.130]  And they're selling us our first woman president ever or our first African-American president ever.
[02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:38.652]  They're showing how progressive we've come.
[02:03:40.044 --> 02:03:40.665]  Oh, far from it.
[02:03:40.665 --> 02:03:41.005]  Far from it.
[02:04:00.491 --> 02:04:03.253]  The information war has grown so much in this past year.
[02:04:03.253 --> 02:04:05.834]  You know, the whole We Are Change movement came about.
[02:04:05.834 --> 02:04:09.277]  You know, Ron Paul announced his candidacy for president.
[02:04:09.277 --> 02:04:10.858]  His entire movement came about.
[02:04:10.858 --> 02:04:14.901]  Of course, the many celebrities that came out this past year.
[02:04:14.901 --> 02:04:20.445]  So, you know, it's been a wild and crazy year for 9-11.
[02:04:20.445 --> 02:04:26.930]  It's just been an adventure to be a part of this whole process and see the wake-up that's been going on.
[02:04:27.617 --> 02:04:29.879]  TruthAlliance.net is Jonathan's site.
[02:04:29.879 --> 02:04:32.322]  WeAreChangeColorado is the organization.
[02:04:32.322 --> 02:04:36.787]  We're going to be back with the full hour and we're going to be taking your calls as well over at the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:36.787 --> 02:04:37.547]  Thanks for tuning in.
[02:04:37.547 --> 02:04:38.428]  I am Jason Bermas.
[02:04:38.428 --> 02:04:39.429]  We'll be back after this.
[02:04:47.318 --> 02:04:49.279]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:04:49.279 --> 02:04:52.901]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:04:52.901 --> 02:04:55.363]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:04:55.363 --> 02:04:58.385]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:04:58.385 --> 02:05:04.128]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:05:04.128 --> 02:05:08.031]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:05:08.371 --> 02:05:13.572]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[02:05:13.572 --> 02:05:16.613]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[02:05:37.501 --> 02:05:39.544]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:05:39.544 --> 02:05:41.527]  Burn the info bombs to disk.

[02:05:45.453 --> 02:05:46.175]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:05:49.522 --> 02:05:50.523]  This is your radio talking.
[02:06:11.553 --> 02:06:12.053]  That's right.
[02:06:42.176 --> 02:06:42.397]  999.
[02:06:42.397 --> 02:06:43.884]  Visit BatteryStation.com.
[02:06:43.884 --> 02:06:45.210]  That's BatteryStation.com.
[02:06:47.366 --> 02:06:47.826]  Fact.
[02:06:47.826 --> 02:06:53.851]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:06:53.851 --> 02:06:58.174]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:06:58.174 --> 02:07:05.859]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:07:05.859 --> 02:07:06.600]  The solution.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.823]  Detoxification integrated with Electrochi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:07:10.823 --> 02:07:12.804]  The Electrochi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:07:12.984 --> 02:07:13.284]  I think so.
[02:07:32.819 --> 02:07:33.139]  Big Brother.
[02:07:53.408 --> 02:07:55.189]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:56.929]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:56.929 --> 02:07:58.530]  You want answers?
[02:07:58.530 --> 02:07:59.450]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:59.450 --> 02:08:04.272]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:04.272 --> 02:08:11.695]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:11.695 --> 02:08:15.357]  We are here to destroy the Empire to ensure that the Republic
[02:08:16.508 --> 02:08:34.083]  That's why we're here, that's why we do what we do, that's why we are Change Exists, that's why we have a command center out in Austin, Texas, headed up by a true patriot known as Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.083 --> 02:08:38.687]  And Alex is carrying a new video over here, again it's by William Lewis, who edited
[02:08:39.471 --> 02:08:42.193]  Ripple Effect and 9-11 in plain sight.
[02:08:42.193 --> 02:08:43.254]  A very talented guy.
[02:08:43.254 --> 02:08:44.976]  It's called Washington, You're Fired.
[02:08:44.976 --> 02:08:48.639]  And some of the other questions he asked in this video is, are you a terrorist?
[02:08:48.639 --> 02:08:53.844]  Because according to the new definition for homegrown terrorists, you just might be.
[02:08:53.844 --> 02:08:58.748]  And if you saw that Simon Wiesenthal presentation about two or three months ago, you better believe it.
[02:08:58.748 --> 02:09:01.370]  I mean, they're showing Al Qaeda snuff films.
[02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:03.752]  Literally people getting shot in the face.
[02:09:03.752 --> 02:09:04.293]  Okay?
[02:09:04.293 --> 02:09:05.694]  About to be beheaded as well.
[02:09:06.175 --> 02:09:15.097]  And then they slip in a little bit, Architects and Engineers for 9-11 Truth, and say conspiracy theories breed on the internet, and imply that we're with the terrorists.
[02:09:15.097 --> 02:09:15.897]  No, folks!
[02:09:15.897 --> 02:09:17.017]  I'm with the Constitution!
[02:09:17.017 --> 02:09:18.657]  I'm with the Bill of Rights!
[02:09:18.657 --> 02:09:20.318]  I'm with freedom!
[02:09:20.318 --> 02:09:21.538]  I'm with this country, man!
[02:09:21.538 --> 02:09:24.678]  I'm with the United States of America, and we need to take it back.
[02:09:24.678 --> 02:09:27.159]  Where are the checks and balances?
[02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:30.379]  Where is the government for and by the people?
[02:09:30.379 --> 02:09:34.300]  Well, we gotta step up and ensure that we continue to move forward.
[02:09:34.884 --> 02:09:46.542]  And Jonathan Ellenhoff is one of those people that, I mean, constantly, constantly is getting people on video, is doing new projects, is pushing forward for the Patriot Movement.
[02:09:46.542 --> 02:09:48.505]  And, you know, what's your latest and greatest, Jonathan?
[02:09:48.505 --> 02:09:50.688]  What are you working on over at Truth Alliance right now?
[02:09:51.707 --> 02:09:55.832]  Well, first of all, I want to accredit Jason and Micah.
[02:09:55.832 --> 02:09:56.933]  They run the site.
[02:09:56.933 --> 02:09:58.035]  They do a great job.
[02:09:58.035 --> 02:10:02.140]  We all find articles and then I write for the site.
[02:10:02.140 --> 02:10:03.641]  So it's kind of a collective effort.
[02:10:05.675 --> 02:10:11.320]  I want to also give the rest of the We Are Change Colorado chapter their credit as well.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:19.288]  There's other members, Josh, Rob, of course, Jason, Adam, all those guys, Shannon, just terrific members.
[02:10:19.288 --> 02:10:27.896]  Had I not have met them this past year, I don't know if I would have built up the courage to fight this info war.
[02:10:27.896 --> 02:10:29.318]  They've all just done a great job.
[02:10:30.999 --> 02:10:44.726]  You know, this year we've been working on a Corps of Corruption film, which is a 9-11 film, based on my research and the collective research of many people I've met with, including you, of course.
[02:10:44.726 --> 02:10:46.707]  And I hope to get that out this year.
[02:10:46.707 --> 02:10:58.033]  And then I just took another project with the Western Clean Energy Campaign to do a film on big coal and the coal industry and how it is integrated into the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy.
[02:10:58.809 --> 02:11:13.592]  So it's been an interesting year working on film projects and of course exposing some of the criminal elements inside of our political system now and facing them, of course, in person and having it off in debates and many times getting thrown out.
[02:11:13.592 --> 02:11:19.813]  Yeah, well, you know, that happens when you speak truth to power and that's what we continue to do.
[02:11:19.813 --> 02:11:21.274]  I mean, you've confronted Mitt Romney.
[02:11:21.274 --> 02:11:23.614]  People can check that out over at YouTube.
[02:11:23.614 --> 02:11:27.815]  And I just want to sidetrack for just one second and tell people that they can go check out
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:30.301]  An actual patriot running for Senate.
[02:11:30.301 --> 02:11:32.683]  Friend of Ron Paul for over 28 years.
[02:11:32.683 --> 02:11:36.025]  You can check it out at murrayandron.com.
[02:11:36.025 --> 02:11:39.807]  There is going to be a rally on April 28th in New York City.
[02:11:39.807 --> 02:11:42.208]  And Murray Sabrin is the candidate.
[02:11:42.208 --> 02:11:44.209]  And I think they're giving away two free trips over there.
[02:11:44.209 --> 02:11:45.210]  So go check it out.
[02:11:45.210 --> 02:11:48.232]  And we need more people with that Ron Paul mentality.
[02:11:48.232 --> 02:11:49.913]  With that constitutional republic.
[02:11:49.913 --> 02:11:53.174]  With the separation of state powers.
[02:11:53.174 --> 02:11:54.255]  So we can do these things.
[02:11:54.255 --> 02:11:57.437]  I mean, I was pretty shocked when I went into Colorado, Jonathan.
[02:11:58.212 --> 02:11:59.773]  You know, people had handguns everywhere.
[02:11:59.773 --> 02:12:01.635]  It's just not like that in New York.
[02:12:01.635 --> 02:12:09.461]  You know, where I'm from, if you want to have a carry or conceal permit, or a carry and conceal permit, for a handgun, I mean, you have to jump through loops.
[02:12:09.461 --> 02:12:15.825]  You most likely have to be a police officer, or in the military, or an ex-military, in order to do so.
[02:12:15.825 --> 02:12:16.966]  We really don't have that right.
[02:12:16.966 --> 02:12:22.630]  I mean, you can have a .22 or a shotgun in your house, sure, but you can't, you can't carry around a pistol.
[02:12:22.630 --> 02:12:24.392]  And it is just, you know, it's,
[02:12:25.214 --> 02:12:27.796]  It's much more free in Colorado, I guess you could say.
[02:12:27.796 --> 02:12:33.259]  I mean, people are carrying weapons, people know their rights, and it's not like, you know, people are running around murdering people.
[02:12:33.259 --> 02:12:36.842]  It seemed like a much safer place than New York, Jonathan.
[02:12:36.842 --> 02:12:39.904]  Oh yeah, our crime rate is very low.
[02:12:39.904 --> 02:12:51.171]  You know, it's generally an outdoor state because of our mountains and, you know, a lot of people, I remember I had a cousin out in Jersey and, you know, he said, do you hunt for your dinner when we were kids?
[02:12:51.171 --> 02:12:52.312]  And I was like, no man, it's
[02:12:52.938 --> 02:12:55.100]  Not like your typical cow town, you know.
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.081]  We're a pretty, relatively large city.
[02:12:57.081 --> 02:13:02.805]  Colorado has, I think, over 5 million people in it, and most of them are centralized in Denver.
[02:13:02.805 --> 02:13:05.908]  And the city itself is very lenient, you know.
[02:13:05.908 --> 02:13:10.051]  They're very, very respectful towards medical marijuana.
[02:13:10.051 --> 02:13:13.053]  We were one of the first states to pass that.
[02:13:13.053 --> 02:13:16.295]  Denver and Boulder have decriminalized marijuana.
[02:13:16.295 --> 02:13:20.899]  Of course, they respect the right to possess and carry weapons.
[02:13:21.599 --> 02:13:27.703]  It's definitely an interesting state where you see a cross between many different laws and a lot of activists in Colorado.
[02:13:27.703 --> 02:13:33.167]  A lot of outdoors people, people that don't like to work indoors or, you know, in office jobs.
[02:13:33.167 --> 02:13:38.111]  So you get a lot of people that like to bike ride, go camping, go up to the mountains and enjoy themselves.
[02:13:38.111 --> 02:13:39.292]  Skiing and snowboarding.
[02:13:39.292 --> 02:13:43.174]  So our community is generally a bunch of people pretty laid back, as I said before.
[02:13:43.174 --> 02:13:46.357]  And, you know, it's a cool town.
[02:13:46.357 --> 02:13:48.538]  I wish more people would come out and visit us.
[02:13:48.538 --> 02:13:50.419]  But, you know, we know what's going on.
[02:13:50.419 --> 02:13:51.080]  We're waking up.
[02:13:51.761 --> 02:13:53.001]  To the InfoWard.
[02:13:53.001 --> 02:13:55.502]  Hopefully we can contribute our part in this whole battle.
[02:13:55.502 --> 02:13:58.782]  It was a truly beautiful piece of land I was at.
[02:13:58.782 --> 02:14:06.204]  And I gotta tell you folks, I was shocked to get there and have it be about 20 degrees warmer than it was in New York while I was out there in February.
[02:14:06.204 --> 02:14:07.984]  I went there thinking, oh, I need a winter hat.
[02:14:07.984 --> 02:14:11.705]  It's like 75 degrees and sunny in Denver and Boulder, guys.
[02:14:11.705 --> 02:14:18.006]  I mean, it's not until you get up to the upper altitudes that you have that snow and that powder on the mountains, because it is the Rockies.
[02:14:19.591 --> 02:14:20.392]  I was just shocked, man.
[02:14:20.392 --> 02:14:28.396]  It was a really cool place and I hope to be out there sometime this summer as well, especially for the DNC, which I'm stoked for.
[02:14:28.396 --> 02:14:42.905]  And I want to talk a little bit more about the DNC and really get your take on this organization that did get a permit and their tactics, man, because if you look at that shield book, it screams provocateur!
[02:14:42.905 --> 02:14:44.506]  Screams it!
[02:14:44.506 --> 02:14:46.327]  Oh yeah, to say the least.
[02:14:47.072 --> 02:15:04.983]  And, you know, the articles that I've been writing, I just posted another one if people want further information on it, but, you know, the reality is that, you know, the DNC is going to be, hundreds of activist groups going to be showing up and working together and separately at the same time.
[02:15:04.983 --> 02:15:11.367]  It's going to be a very interesting scene down there because Denver spent $50 million on security forces
[02:15:12.294 --> 02:15:12.795]  I don't
[02:15:31.109 --> 02:15:35.956]  Some of the activist groups planning for protests down there, I received, you know, a lot of praise.
[02:15:35.956 --> 02:15:41.264]  I also got attacked personally, which, you know, a lot of people want to know where we get our sources.
[02:15:41.264 --> 02:15:45.350]  If you go to Truthline.net, you can see where I base my argument.
[02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:46.532]  It's just an observation.
[02:15:47.057 --> 02:15:53.459]  I'm not making accusations, and there are no hard feelings on my end, but I'm concerned.
[02:15:53.459 --> 02:16:08.365]  Violence is something that the police state uses to make us look bad, to install martial law, to enforce strict responses, and then they can get their way if people act out of line or criminal.
[02:16:08.365 --> 02:16:15.548]  And yeah, there are groups out there, I named some of them, I've been able to observe some on Truth Alliance.net, you can see that.
[02:16:16.249 --> 02:16:19.111]  Um, and yeah, they're calling for destruction of property.
[02:16:19.111 --> 02:16:23.655]  They're calling for organized efforts to directly confront police.
[02:16:23.655 --> 02:16:33.142]  They're calling for all kinds of things that are going to result in, especially with the numbers that I've been hearing, tens of thousands of people are going to be coordinating these things.
[02:16:33.142 --> 02:16:41.388]  Um, you're talking about a potential, uh, safety risk, uh, for, for people who are wanting to demonstrate peacefully.
[02:16:41.388 --> 02:16:42.869]  So we might see some, uh,
[02:16:43.482 --> 02:16:52.093]  You know, potential for violence, and I've been to some meetings and recorded them, and all those audio clips are available on truthalliance.net as well.
[02:16:52.093 --> 02:16:56.859]  And you can see for yourself, folks, I mean, you know, people are saying that they're going to get violent.
[02:16:56.859 --> 02:17:00.884]  I've got the quotes, I've got the confirmation, I've got the audio clips, I've got the documents.
[02:17:01.368 --> 02:17:03.109]  People are manifesting this.
[02:17:03.109 --> 02:17:07.832]  You know, I didn't want to be the bearer of the bad news, but hey, look, I'm just the messenger.
[02:17:07.832 --> 02:17:10.154]  I'm observing something going on here.
[02:17:10.154 --> 02:17:14.817]  It looks like two trains headed for each other on the same track, and they're going to collide if I don't stop it.
[02:17:14.817 --> 02:17:25.264]  Or at least if we don't begin this process of talking about it, so that worst-case scenario, let's say it does happen, which it looks like it's going to, you know, we can come out and say, hey, look, we tried to prevent this.
[02:17:25.264 --> 02:17:26.125]  We tried to stop it.
[02:17:26.125 --> 02:17:28.006]  We tried to educate you on this.
[02:17:28.006 --> 02:17:28.947]  This needs to stop.
[02:17:29.737 --> 02:17:31.079]  And that's what we have to do.
[02:17:31.079 --> 02:17:32.882]  We have to go about things peacefully.
[02:17:32.882 --> 02:17:35.746]  We have to go about civil disobedience in a certain manner.
[02:17:35.746 --> 02:17:40.133]  And whenever you see people trying to go against those principles or those standards...
[02:17:40.526 --> 02:17:43.507]  That's when you have to ask yourself, okay, what are they doing?
[02:17:43.507 --> 02:17:48.168]  We've never had a coordinated effort this large, and we've acted peaceful about it.
[02:17:48.168 --> 02:17:49.829]  So why are we acting this way?
[02:17:49.829 --> 02:17:53.250]  And a lot of people look at the Civil Rights Movement and they say, oh, well, that was violent.
[02:17:53.250 --> 02:17:54.590]  And I go, no, no.
[02:17:54.590 --> 02:17:59.392]  The success of the Civil Rights Movement came from Martin Luther King, primarily.
[02:17:59.392 --> 02:18:00.432]  Every historian agrees.
[02:18:01.536 --> 02:18:02.677]  And he was non-violent.
[02:18:02.677 --> 02:18:06.759]  And I mean, the ways that Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:18:06.759 --> 02:18:10.902]  achieved change was peaceful, non-violent resistance.
[02:18:10.902 --> 02:18:12.463]  And that's what we need to continue to do.
[02:18:12.463 --> 02:18:16.165]  And the media is going to continue to lie and say we're not using that method.
[02:18:16.165 --> 02:18:17.346]  Hence this story right here.
[02:18:17.346 --> 02:18:24.090]  And we need an article up at Infowars.com as soon as possible, because this has to do with We Are Change Out in New York.
[02:18:24.090 --> 02:18:26.151]  And the New York Post is actually reporting
[02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:34.434]  That Gary, who was detained the other day for confronting the Bush women, punched a girl in the... Listen to what this one says.
[02:18:34.434 --> 02:18:41.938]  He said the authorities are saying that he was arrested after he punched a wheelchair-bound girl whose parents had told him to shut up, authorities said yesterday.
[02:18:41.938 --> 02:18:44.340]  The girl's 18 and has cerebral palsy.
[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:50.803]  I can promise you that Gary did not punch any girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy.
[02:18:50.803 --> 02:18:52.064]  Show me the video.
[02:18:52.064 --> 02:18:53.624]  Show me the video of this man
[02:18:55.231 --> 02:18:59.793]  Punching a girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy, but they'll charge him with it.
[02:18:59.793 --> 02:19:06.716]  It's just like when you, you know, out in the UK, they confront an official, he trips and falls and all of a sudden he's attacked.
[02:19:06.716 --> 02:19:07.817]  It makes me sick.
[02:19:07.817 --> 02:19:08.797]  It makes me ill.
[02:19:08.797 --> 02:19:10.718]  They're painting us out to be demons.
[02:19:10.718 --> 02:19:12.459]  We need to pay attention.
[02:19:12.459 --> 02:19:15.680]  He needs to sue them, okay, for libel for this.
[02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.121]  They really need to bring a lawsuit.
[02:19:17.121 --> 02:19:19.942]  Punched a girl in a wheelchair and screaming obscenities.
[02:19:19.942 --> 02:19:21.282]  It's disgusting, Jonathan.
[02:19:21.282 --> 02:19:22.383]  I'm not gonna stand for it.
[02:19:23.211 --> 02:19:26.674]  We are Change Colorado going to stick it out with us for the entire hour.
[02:19:26.674 --> 02:19:28.756]  TruthAlliance.net is the website.
[02:19:28.756 --> 02:19:29.857]  Infowars.com.
[02:19:29.857 --> 02:19:33.359]  PrisonPlanet.tv if you want to check me out in the fourth hour on the video.
[02:19:33.359 --> 02:19:39.665]  And we're going to come back and we're going to take calls from Ian, Stuart, Randy, and Brian in the next hour.
[02:19:39.665 --> 02:19:41.386]  I'm Jason Bermas in for Alex Jones.
[02:19:41.386 --> 02:19:47.711]  We'll be back after these messages.
[02:19:47.711 --> 02:19:49.033]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:50.160 --> 02:19:51.921]  A new world order.
[02:19:51.921 --> 02:19:56.825]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:56.825 --> 02:19:59.647]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:19:59.647 --> 02:20:01.849]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:20:02.455 --> 02:20:05.617]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:05.617 --> 02:20:15.982]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:15.982 --> 02:20:20.945]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:21.425 --> 02:20:25.287]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:25.287 --> 02:20:27.848]  Bill of Merit is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:27.848 --> 02:20:29.009]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:29.009 --> 02:20:29.789]  They're not after money.
[02:20:29.789 --> 02:20:31.070]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:32.050]  They're after power.
[02:20:32.050 --> 02:20:33.211]  That's what happens here.

[02:20:44.716 --> 02:20:45.897]  You have been warned.
[02:20:46.730 --> 02:20:48.331]  Wake up, Protestant America!
[02:20:48.331 --> 02:20:52.013]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[02:20:52.013 --> 02:20:58.056]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations will form one huge political voting bloc.
[02:20:58.056 --> 02:21:02.118]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[02:21:02.118 --> 02:21:05.520]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom.
[02:21:05.720 --> 02:21:06.881]  Liberty of conscience.
[02:21:06.881 --> 02:21:11.546]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[02:21:11.546 --> 02:21:15.609]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[02:21:15.609 --> 02:21:18.212]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[02:21:18.212 --> 02:21:23.517]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[02:21:23.517 --> 02:21:27.180]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[02:21:27.180 --> 02:21:29.763]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[02:21:29.943 --> 02:21:32.726]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late!
[02:21:32.726 --> 02:21:34.649]  The prophecies are fast fulfilling!
[02:21:34.649 --> 02:21:36.231]  Jesus is coming soon!

[02:22:45.593 --> 02:22:49.857]  People who use cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:22:49.857 --> 02:22:53.440]  For over five years, cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:22:53.440 --> 02:22:56.903]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on cardivite.
[02:22:57.156 --> 02:23:00.438]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:23:00.438 --> 02:23:05.941]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[02:23:05.941 --> 02:23:15.687]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:23:15.687 --> 02:23:17.068]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:23:17.068 --> 02:23:22.491]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:23:22.973 --> 02:23:27.494]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:23:27.494 --> 02:23:29.034]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:23:29.034 --> 02:23:32.515]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.

[02:24:05.843 --> 02:24:30.133]  All those drifter's days are past me now I've got so much more to think about Deadlines and commitments What to leave in, what to leave out Against the wind We were running against the wind
[02:24:43.029 --> 02:24:44.850]  Against the wind folks and we're fighting.
[02:24:44.850 --> 02:24:48.391]  We're fighting against the wind of the new world order.
[02:24:48.391 --> 02:24:50.172]  Of this globalist agenda.
[02:24:50.172 --> 02:24:51.572]  Of the mainstream media.
[02:24:51.572 --> 02:24:52.473]  Let me read this.
[02:24:52.473 --> 02:24:53.713]  Let me read more.
[02:24:53.713 --> 02:24:55.834]  Before I go back to Jonathan and we are changed.
[02:24:55.834 --> 02:24:57.154]  Because this does affect all of us.
[02:24:57.154 --> 02:25:00.756]  This is how the media spins and lies.
[02:25:00.756 --> 02:25:01.316]  This guy
[02:25:02.114 --> 02:25:05.536]  Uh, John and Wendy Lovetro, the parents of this, this girl.
[02:25:05.536 --> 02:25:11.180]  You know, I don't know anything about them, but I do know that there's no way this kid was hitting their daughter.
[02:25:11.180 --> 02:25:12.101]  All right?
[02:25:12.101 --> 02:25:14.202]  And this is what their quotes are in the paper.
[02:25:14.202 --> 02:25:18.965]  I heard my daughter hysterically yelling, he's hitting me, said Wendy.
[02:25:18.965 --> 02:25:23.328]  He punched her on the shoulder blades, but that wasn't enough, she said.
[02:25:23.328 --> 02:25:24.608]  What?
[02:25:24.608 --> 02:25:25.329]  Come on!
[02:25:26.072 --> 02:25:28.293]  Yeah, listen, some of this video is actually posted.
[02:25:28.293 --> 02:25:36.017]  If you think that the guy who, uh, the Secret Service is talking to, Gary, did this, I gotta- there's no way.
[02:25:36.017 --> 02:25:36.897]  There's no way.
[02:25:36.897 --> 02:25:45.521]  My husband pushed the wheelchair away from him, and he reached beyond my husband and began pounding my daughter in the thigh.
[02:25:45.521 --> 02:25:47.222]  Come on.
[02:25:47.222 --> 02:25:49.563]  The two men fought as the President's family drove off.
[02:25:49.563 --> 02:25:53.705]  Cops broke them up and busted Talas on charges of assault and resisting arrest.
[02:25:54.477 --> 02:25:55.518]  Ridiculous.
[02:25:55.518 --> 02:25:59.359]  I promise you Gary didn't punch this woman.
[02:25:59.359 --> 02:26:01.880]  I'm sick to my stomach right now!
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:06.963]  I mean, Jonathan, will you speak to how the media just spins these things out of control?
[02:26:06.963 --> 02:26:11.425]  I mean, there's going to be video that surfaces and it's going to clearly show that he didn't punch this girl.
[02:26:11.425 --> 02:26:15.286]  And do you think the New York Times is going to retract this story?
[02:26:15.286 --> 02:26:16.027]  I hope so.
[02:26:16.027 --> 02:26:23.350]  You know, it's clearly, you know, I saw when that was posted on the We Are Change site and also when it was first updated.
[02:26:23.945 --> 02:26:34.289]  And it looked as though the story was that the people were told, if I'm not mistaken, to move her closer to Gary, so it could appear that way.
[02:26:34.289 --> 02:26:38.871]  And Gary was just trying to get in, but I wasn't present, so I don't know what actually occurred.
[02:26:38.871 --> 02:26:42.673]  But I do know that, you know, We Are Change is a peaceful group.
[02:26:42.673 --> 02:26:49.776]  This doesn't sound like anything We Are Change would do, believes in, doesn't reflect anything that the group would do.
[02:26:49.776 --> 02:26:52.497]  But the mainstream media is trying to paint them as the new weathermen.
[02:26:53.280 --> 02:27:00.804]  Well, you know, the mainstream media has a long history of this ridiculous framing, character framing that they tend to do.
[02:27:00.804 --> 02:27:03.565]  I mean, we saw this with Charlie Sheen when he went public.
[02:27:03.565 --> 02:27:06.727]  We saw it with Rosie O'Donnell when she went public about 9-11.
[02:27:06.727 --> 02:27:18.333]  They use these character assassinations against us to make us look crazy or not credible or violent or whatever method they're trying to do.
[02:27:18.333 --> 02:27:20.514]  And for the people who aren't woken up
[02:27:21.303 --> 02:27:28.367]  It can work sometimes, but for the most of the people in this country that are waking up, if not all of them, it doesn't work anymore.
[02:27:28.367 --> 02:27:30.368]  These kinds of tactics are silly.
[02:27:30.368 --> 02:27:34.530]  I don't know why they keep resorting to these ridiculous methods.
[02:27:34.530 --> 02:27:38.151]  What they have to realize is this is backfiring on them at full fold.
[02:27:38.151 --> 02:27:44.195]  I mean, every time they do this, our movement grows hundreds of people, because people aren't stupid.
[02:27:44.195 --> 02:27:44.735]  We know.
[02:27:44.735 --> 02:27:45.895]  We know what's going on.
[02:27:45.895 --> 02:27:47.576]  We know what they're trying to do.
[02:27:47.576 --> 02:27:50.918]  And these are old tactics that maybe worked hundreds of years ago.
[02:27:51.953 --> 02:28:01.595]  But they're not going to work in an age of Internet, in an age of reason, and in an age of educated, intelligent information sharing, which is what we're going through today.
[02:28:01.595 --> 02:28:07.436]  So, you know... Which is why it's so important for them to try to control the Internet and bring in Internet, too.
[02:28:07.436 --> 02:28:10.317]  And it's very scary stuff, I pray to God that that doesn't happen.
[02:28:10.317 --> 02:28:14.478]  I pray to God that most people wake up before they want you to scan your thumbprint.
[02:28:14.478 --> 02:28:17.218]  They're already testing it out with these new IBM ThinkPads.
[02:28:17.218 --> 02:28:19.159]  See how many people buy this for security?
[02:28:19.159 --> 02:28:19.519]  Oh look!
[02:28:20.307 --> 02:28:22.989]  I have a biometric thumb scanner on my computer.
[02:28:22.989 --> 02:28:24.491]  Only I can access it.
[02:28:24.491 --> 02:28:26.152]  Well, soon they'll be on all keyboards.
[02:28:26.152 --> 02:28:28.594]  And you can only access any computer through that.
[02:28:28.594 --> 02:28:31.216]  And you're gonna hook in through internet, too, with your user ID.
[02:28:31.216 --> 02:28:42.346]  And everything you do, which hasn't already been tracked or traced, because, you know, we've got whistleblowers that have gone public and said, you know, AT&T, amongst others, are giving everything to a quote-unquote secret room.
[02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:43.467]  Everything's being recorded.
[02:28:44.002 --> 02:28:44.702]  It's really unfortunate.
[02:28:44.702 --> 02:28:45.983]  Mainstream news, folks.
[02:28:45.983 --> 02:28:48.124]  Keith Olbermann had the guy on for ten minutes.
[02:28:48.124 --> 02:28:56.669]  Thing was thrown out of federal court and now he's just trying to get, you know, get it into a lawsuit so that this subject matter can even be brought to the American people.
[02:28:56.669 --> 02:29:01.993]  Why is it on one show for eight minutes, one time, and no one else is talking about it?
[02:29:01.993 --> 02:29:03.373]  Why?
[02:29:03.373 --> 02:29:04.674]  Oh, I'll tell you why.
[02:29:04.674 --> 02:29:06.515]  It's because they're trying to control us.
[02:29:06.515 --> 02:29:09.297]  They're trying, they're incrementally taking everything away.
[02:29:10.330 --> 02:29:17.799]  Jonathan's with me for the remainder of the hour and then right at the top of the next segment, we're going to start going to the calls beginning with Ian in New York.
[02:29:17.799 --> 02:29:20.983]  By the way, Mike, I know you dropped out to take another call.
[02:29:20.983 --> 02:29:24.707]  We may go back to you in the fourth hour with Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[02:29:24.707 --> 02:29:26.890]  It's the Alex Jones Show and we'll be right back.
[02:29:37.867 --> 02:29:40.856]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.856 --> 02:29:44.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:47.938 --> 02:29:49.919]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:29:49.919 --> 02:29:55.281]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:29:55.281 --> 02:29:56.881]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:29:56.881 --> 02:30:05.284]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:05.284 --> 02:30:11.006]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:11.406 --> 02:30:13.027]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:30:13.027 --> 02:30:15.208]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:30:15.208 --> 02:30:19.729]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:30:19.729 --> 02:30:21.950]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:29.713]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:30:29.893 --> 02:30:34.095]  Order your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305.
[02:30:34.095 --> 02:30:37.977]  That's 866-295-5305.

[02:30:41.018 --> 02:30:45.160]  Heart and body extract, 866-295-5305.
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:47.501]  Or hbextract.com.
[02:30:47.501 --> 02:30:52.603]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[02:30:52.603 --> 02:30:56.305]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[02:30:56.465 --> 02:31:06.150]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[02:31:06.150 --> 02:31:10.552]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.
[02:31:10.552 --> 02:31:14.414]  This gives you more fiber, enzymes, vitamins, and trace minerals.
[02:31:14.414 --> 02:31:24.439]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once-thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[02:31:24.699 --> 02:31:29.801]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[02:31:29.801 --> 02:31:32.643]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.
[02:31:32.643 --> 02:31:37.345]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flour.
[02:31:37.345 --> 02:31:41.587]  The Champion Juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[02:31:41.587 --> 02:31:44.248]  The world's finest juicer is Champion Juicer.
[02:31:44.248 --> 02:31:46.409]  Ask for it at your favorite health food store online today.
[02:31:46.989 --> 02:31:52.833]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[02:31:52.833 --> 02:31:58.256]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:31:58.256 --> 02:32:03.639]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:32:03.639 --> 02:32:09.542]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[02:32:09.542 --> 02:32:13.805]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water, but due to modern way of life,
[02:32:14.005 --> 02:32:15.747]  Most people are overly acidic.
[02:32:15.747 --> 02:32:19.552]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[02:32:19.552 --> 02:32:24.377]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[02:32:24.377 --> 02:32:25.419]  Do your part.
[02:32:25.419 --> 02:32:28.042]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now!
[02:32:28.042 --> 02:32:34.169]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink
[02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:37.231]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[02:32:37.231 --> 02:32:43.715]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[02:32:43.715 --> 02:32:45.116]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[02:33:02.062 --> 02:33:06.164]  Some folks are born, made to wait to fly.
[02:33:06.164 --> 02:33:07.445]  Ooh!
[02:33:07.445 --> 02:33:10.066]  They're red, white, and blue.
[02:33:10.066 --> 02:33:12.567]  They're red, white, and blue.
[02:33:12.567 --> 02:33:19.631]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief, Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[02:33:19.631 --> 02:33:24.153]  Tell them, that it ain't me.
[02:33:24.153 --> 02:33:25.454]  It ain't me, no.
[02:33:25.454 --> 02:33:28.515]  I ain't no sinner, son.
[02:33:45.193 --> 02:33:47.134]  We are back, baby!
[02:33:47.134 --> 02:33:59.978]  Defending the Republic in disgust with the mainstream media, where they report that 9-11 truthers, that we are change, are literally attacking girls with cerebral palsy in wheelchairs.
[02:34:00.919 --> 02:34:02.619]  That's the kind of slander.
[02:34:02.619 --> 02:34:05.980]  That's the kind of disinfo they put out.
[02:34:05.980 --> 02:34:08.601]  To shape, to form public opinion.
[02:34:08.601 --> 02:34:10.841]  Well, we got a real patriot with us.
[02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:12.082]  At least for the next 30 minutes.
[02:34:12.082 --> 02:34:14.562]  He's Jonathan Ellenhoff of We Are Change.
[02:34:14.562 --> 02:34:18.323]  And I want to remind everybody, this is a multi-tiered attack.
[02:34:18.323 --> 02:34:22.364]  And one of those attacks they use is this quote-unquote war on drugs.
[02:34:22.364 --> 02:34:29.646]  And that's why it's so important to get a copy of American Drug War, The Last White Hope, Kevin Booth's new film, awesome movie.
[02:34:29.646 --> 02:34:30.506]  I haven't checked out the
[02:34:31.104 --> 02:34:32.646]  The Three Hours of Bonus Features.
[02:34:49.921 --> 02:34:51.281]  And his prison sentence.
[02:34:51.281 --> 02:34:54.782]  He's got Freeway Ricky Ross, Drug War Economics.
[02:34:54.782 --> 02:34:59.803]  He's also got Alex Jones in there, and fun with Barry the Czar.
[02:34:59.803 --> 02:35:02.224]  That's Barry McCafferty, ex-drug czar.
[02:35:02.224 --> 02:35:02.664]  Okay?
[02:35:02.664 --> 02:35:09.266]  He's got a little short with Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and Robert Steele, a CIA officer, among others.
[02:35:09.266 --> 02:35:12.367]  I mean, I think there's five other extras I didn't even get to mention right there.
[02:35:12.367 --> 02:35:18.048]  And you can get this only at PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com,
[02:35:18.670 --> 02:35:20.291]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:20.291 --> 02:35:22.992]  I think it's something like $24.95.
[02:35:22.992 --> 02:35:24.493]  Get a copy.
[02:35:24.493 --> 02:35:26.434]  Hold a screening in your local church.
[02:35:26.434 --> 02:35:28.175]  You know, get this information out.
[02:35:28.175 --> 02:35:31.637]  You know, this thing's on Showtime, so more and more people are watching it.
[02:35:31.637 --> 02:35:35.599]  But it needs to become more mainline, because it's a very impressive DVD.
[02:35:35.599 --> 02:35:38.861]  And hats off to Kevin Booth and the gang.
[02:35:38.861 --> 02:35:43.483]  We're with Jonathan Ellenhoff of WeAreChangedColoradoTruthAlliance.net.
[02:35:43.483 --> 02:35:43.603]  And
[02:35:44.980 --> 02:35:47.243]  You know, are you going to be doing a story about this, Jonathan?
[02:35:47.243 --> 02:35:54.010]  I think this whole attack, really, this deserves some stories all around.
[02:35:54.010 --> 02:35:58.155]  Yeah, you know, we're covering that kind of stuff on the site.
[02:35:58.155 --> 02:36:02.039]  I'm actually talking with Jason right now through IM, and we're able to
[02:36:03.064 --> 02:36:05.565]  Start getting some other articles up.
[02:36:05.565 --> 02:36:11.468]  I did want to mention Twin Lions is a community, network community, where we ask for participation from people.
[02:36:11.468 --> 02:36:13.589]  If you can go there, sign up, help us out.
[02:36:13.589 --> 02:36:18.291]  If you see an article that you think should be mentioned, send it over to us.
[02:36:18.291 --> 02:36:22.713]  Or, as always, Alex Jones' site, InfoWars.
[02:36:22.713 --> 02:36:25.694]  We try to be an information service.
[02:36:25.694 --> 02:36:27.755]  So it's more of a community working together.
[02:36:27.755 --> 02:36:28.656]  We all network on there.
[02:36:28.656 --> 02:36:29.516]  We all chat on there.
[02:36:30.032 --> 02:36:30.453]  We're good to go.
[02:36:53.792 --> 02:36:59.974]  Hopefully people can start their own We Are Change chapters locally in their area, get some people to go out and start confronting politicians.
[02:36:59.974 --> 02:37:05.595]  Look folks, these guys should not be able to go anywhere without being confronted.
[02:37:05.595 --> 02:37:13.897]  They should be able to get off a plane, be confronted, do their spiel, go back on a plane, fly somewhere else, get off a plane and be confronted again.
[02:37:13.897 --> 02:37:18.438]  To the point that they're so saturated with confrontations.
[02:37:19.398 --> 02:37:21.839]  That they realize, okay, the people know this stuff.
[02:37:21.839 --> 02:37:24.240]  I can't continue to play it off like they don't know.
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:28.802]  And that's the way we're going to win this war, of the many different methods.
[02:37:28.802 --> 02:37:30.482]  It's definitely a good start.
[02:37:30.482 --> 02:37:32.923]  So we need as many chapters to get out there.
[02:37:32.923 --> 02:37:34.304]  Go talk to politicians.
[02:37:34.304 --> 02:37:38.425]  Talk to local representatives, media moguls, anybody you can.
[02:37:38.425 --> 02:37:40.166]  And try to get this information out there, you know.
[02:37:40.166 --> 02:37:42.727]  I know a lot of people that mass-produce DVDs.
[02:37:43.345 --> 02:37:43.605]  I think so.
[02:37:59.426 --> 02:38:01.227]  Hop along.
[02:38:01.227 --> 02:38:02.847]  For me, it's exhilarating.
[02:38:02.847 --> 02:38:03.968]  I have an adrenaline rush.
[02:38:03.968 --> 02:38:10.891]  And I'm putting out the call to the listeners for someone to please go to our Wikipedia page and do Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:38:10.891 --> 02:38:13.172]  Second edition has been done to death over there.
[02:38:13.172 --> 02:38:27.077]  Someone really needs to lay out the evidence presented in the Final Cut because this is a brand new movie and people need to know, you know, when they Google Loose Change, it's the second thing that comes up other than the videos, is the Wikipedia page.
[02:38:27.077 --> 02:38:29.078]  They need to know that this is a substantially different movie
[02:38:30.006 --> 02:38:36.527]  That the evidence presented is irrefutable and that, you know, it is a different taste of 9-11 truth from the second edition.
[02:38:36.527 --> 02:38:40.048]  So get out there, somebody, anybody, please, somebody do a good job.
[02:38:40.048 --> 02:38:42.629]  Alright, let's take some calls here, Jonathan.
[02:38:42.629 --> 02:38:44.169]  We're gonna go right through the list.
[02:38:44.169 --> 02:38:46.149]  Let's go to Ian in New York.
[02:38:46.149 --> 02:38:48.370]  Ian, are you with us?
[02:38:48.370 --> 02:38:51.311]  Hello, thanks for taking my call.
[02:38:51.311 --> 02:38:57.712]  You know, I agree with what you're saying, but, you know, I think people are becoming too passive and
[02:38:58.345 --> 02:39:02.628]  You know, they're going to make up stories about us hitting people and stuff like that.
[02:39:02.628 --> 02:39:07.751]  You know, what are we going to wait until they come to our doors, put us in the bus, take us to the death camp?
[02:39:07.751 --> 02:39:16.517]  We've got to start, you know, at least some... I'm not suggesting vandalizing, but we've got to start putting our mark out there even more.
[02:39:16.517 --> 02:39:23.021]  You know, and people are so passive, and they watch TV and worried about sports all the time.
[02:39:23.021 --> 02:39:24.882]  It's getting pretty pathetic.
[02:39:24.882 --> 02:39:25.502]  And I've been...
[02:39:26.550 --> 02:39:39.695]  You know, researching this stuff and since about 2002 and pretty much how I feel nowadays is if people aren't going to do anything, they deserve exactly what they get because it's getting so pathetic.
[02:39:39.695 --> 02:39:41.456]  And that's how I feel.
[02:39:41.456 --> 02:39:44.357]  Well, I mean, you know, I can't really disagree with you.
[02:39:44.357 --> 02:39:48.039]  I think that there's a lot of ways to bring the guerrilla information war out there.
[02:39:48.039 --> 02:39:54.161]  One of those ways is to plaster bumper stickers around your local city or town, even graffiti.
[02:39:54.568 --> 02:40:01.831]  You know, I saw some of that over in the UK with 9-11 Truth, and I'm all for, you know, nonviolent forms of protest.
[02:40:01.831 --> 02:40:06.793]  Now, on the other hand, you know, I don't think that we should be waiting for them to come and get us.
[02:40:06.793 --> 02:40:19.799]  I think that if you're an informed individual, you need to get a gun permit, you need to learn how to use that weapon, you need to know your rights, you need to study into the Second Amendment, and you need to realize that it's there for your protection.
[02:40:19.799 --> 02:40:20.699]  Now, you know,
[02:40:21.519 --> 02:40:33.646]  As far as the passive masses, you know, we've been dealing with this for almost a century, that people have been absorbed in their local sports team, or, you know, before television it was what was on the radio, and now it's, you know, what's on the television.
[02:40:33.646 --> 02:40:37.348]  And progressively, we've become number and dumber, in my opinion.
[02:40:37.348 --> 02:40:39.469]  We don't care about the issues.
[02:40:39.469 --> 02:40:43.832]  You know, even in the radio days, people listen to the presidential radio address once a week.
[02:40:43.832 --> 02:40:45.713]  You know, you don't hear that anymore.
[02:40:45.713 --> 02:40:48.515]  People don't listen to Bush once a week on his presidential radio address.
[02:40:48.515 --> 02:40:49.195]  It just doesn't happen.
[02:40:49.738 --> 02:40:53.540]  People don't even know unless the media reports on it on the big television.
[02:40:53.540 --> 02:41:01.164]  And the majority of those people aren't in it for the CNNs, the MSNBCs, uh, you know, the C-spans.
[02:41:01.164 --> 02:41:04.725]  They're in it for ESPN 4, you know?
[02:41:04.725 --> 02:41:07.326]  Oh, wow, I can watch poker live on TV?
[02:41:07.326 --> 02:41:08.287]  Oh, it's exhilarating!
[02:41:08.897 --> 02:41:14.582]  And it is disappointing, man, but, you know, I'm gonna keep truckin' along because I don't want my freedoms to go away.
[02:41:14.582 --> 02:41:15.923]  And, you know, I indulge.
[02:41:15.923 --> 02:41:17.845]  You know, I'm a Simpsons fan.
[02:41:17.845 --> 02:41:21.769]  Sunday nights I kick back and I watch Animation Domination, and I don't wanna lose that.
[02:41:21.769 --> 02:41:23.650]  But to me, that's secondary.
[02:41:23.650 --> 02:41:25.192]  You know, and I thank you for the call.
[02:41:25.192 --> 02:41:32.058]  Jonathan, that stuff is secondary, and primary for me now is to be involved in this patriot movement and wake people up.
[02:41:32.058 --> 02:41:33.119]  And almost to the fact,
[02:41:33.679 --> 02:41:41.444]  That, you know, when I used to have desk jobs or even, you know, regular blue-collar jobs, I wouldn't shut up at the workplace.
[02:41:41.444 --> 02:41:43.626]  It became annoying to people, but they need to know.
[02:41:43.626 --> 02:41:45.707]  You need to drive it into their heads, don't you agree?
[02:41:45.707 --> 02:41:47.948]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:47.948 --> 02:42:01.017]  I've familiarized myself with debate and, of course, I get a lot of books that I read and, you know, one of the things that I noticed works in getting something done in this movement is educating myself
[02:42:01.997 --> 02:42:14.146]  Pretty much constantly on debate, on information, looking at the common things that are said when people refute my claims and trying to figure out, I think in my head, okay, what's the best way to respond to this?
[02:42:14.146 --> 02:42:15.687]  And then I go home and I plan it out.
[02:42:16.418 --> 02:42:22.880]  And, uh, what's the best way I can influence somebody to look at this without thinking, I'm crazy or I don't know what I'm talking about.
[02:42:22.880 --> 02:42:34.684]  And kind of break that ice for them and say, oh, well, you know, and then make them a nice little philosophical jump or even better, if you can refer to something in the past, you know, the anthrax attacks is one of the easiest ways to get people to look at things.
[02:42:34.684 --> 02:42:45.588]  Cause you go, oh yeah, that was an inside job, but you know, of course, no one's arrested or, you know, and then you can, if you know history well, you can go back and you can start talking about past events where this kind of stuff has happened.
[02:42:46.127 --> 02:43:10.483]  And if you familiarize this information so that it's right there to pull from your brain, basically, at that very given moment, that's what I've noticed helps is that the more information you put on somebody directly, and the more you break that ice for them, the more they are interested in receiving information from you, getting your website, getting a card, getting a DVD, whatever you've got on you.
[02:43:11.019 --> 02:43:15.863]  And so we carry around DVDs, we carry around, we just give them a website name.
[02:43:15.863 --> 02:43:17.384]  You know, give people information.
[02:43:17.384 --> 02:43:21.787]  Talk to family, talk to friends, talk to workers, co-workers.
[02:43:21.787 --> 02:43:23.668]  People, you know, just you're hanging out with.
[02:43:23.668 --> 02:43:27.151]  Anytime, every time, all the time.
[02:43:27.151 --> 02:43:28.471]  And the movement grows.
[02:43:28.471 --> 02:43:34.556]  We've affected thousands of people by getting local media attention here in Colorado by just getting us on the news.
[02:43:34.556 --> 02:43:40.340]  And once you get people to go to your site, if you can just get people to go to your site, which usually you can,
[02:43:40.805 --> 02:43:44.526]  Make sure your site is filled with information and links and video clips and YouTube.
[02:43:44.526 --> 02:43:51.487]  And this is an age of information, so people, once they go to those sites, are immediately broken out of their shells.
[02:43:51.487 --> 02:43:56.808]  So that's how this is accomplished, by getting out there, getting involved, getting publicity.
[02:43:56.808 --> 02:44:05.449]  And once you can get people to go to a site or get people to watch a DVD or get people to read a book, whatever method you want to use, I mean, use all of them, that's going to wake people up.
[02:44:05.449 --> 02:44:07.710]  And I've noticed the results in that and seen it firsthand.
[02:44:07.710 --> 02:44:10.090]  We've got thousands of people in Colorado waked up.
[02:44:10.700 --> 02:44:24.364]  You know, we spent about four weeks promoting Loose Change event here that we did out here with you and Corey and Dylan, and we got almost 2,000 people, and the results of that have been just phenomenal.
[02:44:24.364 --> 02:44:26.165]  I mean, we have a massive base now.
[02:44:26.747 --> 02:44:29.888]  That we can coordinate events with, and we get a lot done.
[02:44:29.888 --> 02:44:30.689]  Absolutely.
[02:44:30.689 --> 02:44:34.310]  And one of my favorite little technological tricks are these new cell phones.
[02:44:34.310 --> 02:44:36.671]  You know, they hold a whole bunch of information.
[02:44:36.671 --> 02:44:39.092]  They're now video players and MP3 players.
[02:44:39.092 --> 02:44:45.015]  And I have Building 7 going down on mine, among other clips about the Vera chip and One World Government.
[02:44:45.015 --> 02:44:53.859]  But I find that if I break out my cell phone, if they see my shirt that says Investigate 9-11, which is another form of guerrilla information war, people see that.
[02:44:54.545 --> 02:44:59.827]  And if I see somebody take notice in disgust or even in curiosity, I walk up to that person.
[02:44:59.827 --> 02:45:01.907]  I say, listen, I'm wearing this shirt for a reason.
[02:45:01.907 --> 02:45:04.028]  Did you know a third building went down on 9-11?
[02:45:04.028 --> 02:45:05.548]  What are you talking about?
[02:45:05.548 --> 02:45:08.709]  And then I show them and they're like, wait a minute, what's that, a Vegas-controlled demolition?
[02:45:08.709 --> 02:45:09.569]  I'm like, no.
[02:45:09.569 --> 02:45:14.711]  That's the 47-story skyscraper they don't want you to know about that fell into its own footprint at 520.
[02:45:14.711 --> 02:45:16.451]  It's a major spook house.
[02:45:16.451 --> 02:45:18.912]  Largest CIA office outside of Virginia.
[02:45:19.412 --> 02:45:27.137]  Largest Secret Service field office in the world, Office of Emergency Management, Department of Defense, Securities and Exchange Commission, and more.
[02:45:27.137 --> 02:45:28.518]  Alright, let's go to another caller.
[02:45:28.518 --> 02:45:30.419]  Let's go to Randy in Michigan.
[02:45:30.419 --> 02:45:33.561]  Randy, are you with us?
[02:45:33.561 --> 02:45:34.542]  Randy, you with us, man?
[02:45:34.542 --> 02:45:35.042]  Yeah, of course.
[02:45:35.042 --> 02:45:36.023]  Yeah.
[02:45:36.023 --> 02:45:37.224]  Oh, great.
[02:45:37.224 --> 02:45:43.147]  I just have questions, like, about as far as, you know, first of all, I'm the biggest fan of the show ever.
[02:45:43.147 --> 02:45:44.588]  I mean, I love you and Alex Jones.
[02:45:44.588 --> 02:45:46.209]  You guys are great.
[02:45:46.209 --> 02:45:46.930]  I was wondering,
[02:45:48.028 --> 02:45:49.450]  What are we going to do about the internet?
[02:45:49.450 --> 02:45:52.893]  I think we have to have some planned things for ourselves.
[02:45:52.893 --> 02:45:57.738]  You know they're going to try to take it over because you know how everything is with the media, the RIAA, music.
[02:45:57.738 --> 02:46:00.842]  They want money, money, money.
[02:46:00.842 --> 02:46:02.784]  I'm a big anti-Microsoft guy.
[02:46:02.784 --> 02:46:04.185]  I'm a big Linux user.
[02:46:04.185 --> 02:46:06.107]  I'm a computer nerd.
[02:46:06.107 --> 02:46:06.768]  I'm a musician.
[02:46:06.768 --> 02:46:07.228]  I'm all that.
[02:46:08.447 --> 02:46:13.253]  I was just wondering, like, what can we do to plan ahead for what they're going to do to the internet?
[02:46:13.253 --> 02:46:18.979]  That's, like, how I found out about you and I bought your videos and Alex Jones and, I mean, I have all your videos.
[02:46:18.979 --> 02:46:20.722]  I have the final cut.
[02:46:20.722 --> 02:46:22.444]  I have, um, Alex Jones, you know, info.
[02:46:24.805 --> 02:46:29.527]  Sure, well what I think we need to do about it is first inform people about Internet 2.
[02:46:29.527 --> 02:46:33.729]  Most people don't know what Internet 2 is, they don't believe it exists, but you need to show them.
[02:46:33.729 --> 02:46:40.172]  Well, biometrics is becoming big and have you noticed that on some of the new keyboards and laptops they have this thumb scan?
[02:46:40.692 --> 02:46:42.334]  Oh, but that makes me more secure.
[02:46:42.334 --> 02:46:44.777]  Well, you need to point out that that doesn't make them so secure.
[02:46:44.777 --> 02:46:46.358]  You need to show them the next level.
[02:46:46.358 --> 02:46:54.928]  You need to show them the VeraChip and how in 2004 the FDA approved an implantable human microchip.
[02:46:54.928 --> 02:46:55.689]  Okay, let me say it again.
[02:46:55.689 --> 02:46:58.532]  An implantable human microchip.
[02:46:58.932 --> 02:47:03.057]  That gives off a radio frequency ID, and you can program to do all sorts of things.
[02:47:03.057 --> 02:47:08.382]  If you don't believe me, folks, you can go on eBay, and you can get the ones for your dogs, okay?
[02:47:08.382 --> 02:47:15.870]  And it comes with an actual hypodermic needle, and then you pay like $10 a month, and you can literally be tracked by a GPS system the rest of your life, if you like.
[02:47:16.480 --> 02:47:17.521]  Is that what you want?
[02:47:17.521 --> 02:47:20.283]  So, dude, I mean, you've just gotta reach out.
[02:47:20.283 --> 02:47:22.304]  First and foremost for me is family all the time.
[02:47:22.304 --> 02:47:26.867]  Whether they're gonna laugh in my face or think I'm crazy, you know, my family is number one to me.
[02:47:26.867 --> 02:47:28.108]  Second is my friends.
[02:47:28.108 --> 02:47:29.069]  You know, I want them to know.
[02:47:29.069 --> 02:47:30.529]  I want them to tell their friends.
[02:47:30.529 --> 02:47:33.832]  And right now, we're at the point where it has to be an information war.
[02:47:33.832 --> 02:47:38.375]  And it has to be an information war where we take our marching orders to the street.
[02:47:38.375 --> 02:47:45.099]  Not just to message boards, which is good, don't get me wrong, and not just to internet websites, but to the outside world.
[02:47:45.099 --> 02:47:45.980]  To coffee shops.
[02:47:46.480 --> 02:47:53.768]  Okay, to bars, to people, to places where people actually go, to malls, where the most brainwashed people are.
[02:47:53.768 --> 02:47:56.692]  The people that spend, you know, five days out of the week at a mall.
[02:47:56.692 --> 02:48:00.476]  They're the ones that really need to wake up from this consumerist culture.
[02:48:00.476 --> 02:48:01.957]  And I thank you for the call, Randy.
[02:48:01.957 --> 02:48:04.180]  I hope I led you in the right direction, but...
[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:26.268]  You know, it's only through sharing this information with others that we're going to be able to make a dent in this globalist agenda, Jonathan, and that's really how you got started, was going around telling people, then you picked up a camera, then you started to go to events, then you started posting on YouTube, and you know, it's really just snowballed for you to the point where you have Gary Hart agreeing to interviews!
[02:48:26.268 --> 02:48:31.070]  Yeah, exactly, and he did kind of stiff-arm us on that interview.
[02:48:32.034 --> 02:48:33.235]  He's been pushing us back.
[02:48:33.235 --> 02:48:39.880]  I think he got the feeling that, uh, I think he caught on either to one of our videos or one of our, uh, articles about him.
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:43.963]  But, um, you know, we did have a sit down interview with him organized, set up.
[02:48:43.963 --> 02:48:47.686]  I got him a couple of questions that I never posted online yet.
[02:48:47.686 --> 02:48:53.090]  I'm waiting, of course, for that interview, which, Gary, if you're out there, you know, you agreed to do this interview.
[02:48:53.090 --> 02:48:56.653]  But no, we still talk to the assistant and try to get that interview going.
[02:48:56.653 --> 02:48:57.954]  And he's avoiding us like, uh,
[02:48:58.519 --> 02:48:59.500]  Like no other.
[02:48:59.500 --> 02:49:08.164]  But yeah, I mean, you know, I started out small and basically just started out reading books, watching the DVDs and, you know, following the movement here and there.
[02:49:08.164 --> 02:49:14.467]  And once I became convinced that they were going to try to launch a campaign against us, I said, no, forget that.
[02:49:14.467 --> 02:49:20.390]  That's going to backfire in my book, because now I'm going to launch a campaign against your disinformation.
[02:49:20.390 --> 02:49:22.872]  And that's where it kind of triggered for me to
[02:49:24.013 --> 02:49:36.417]  Go after the New World Order crowd and, uh, you know, specifically target information and, you know, battle this battle, you know, and people know when they look at this, they know what the answer is because it's easy when you look at the evidence.
[02:49:36.417 --> 02:49:41.399]  But what's not easy is when people just believe what they hear.
[02:49:41.399 --> 02:49:43.899]  Do the research, go out there, get involved.
[02:49:43.899 --> 02:49:51.802]  That's one of the reasons why I got so motivated is when I actually started doing my own research and realizing how real this information is and how
[02:49:52.415 --> 02:49:57.940]  Important it is and vital to my security, my safety, my survival.
[02:49:57.940 --> 02:50:02.463]  And that's what I actually did is once I started actually finding this information out for myself.
[02:50:02.463 --> 02:50:03.644]  Don't take our words for it.
[02:50:03.644 --> 02:50:04.565]  Look into it yourself.
[02:50:04.565 --> 02:50:05.906]  It's as clear as day.
[02:50:05.906 --> 02:50:07.788]  I'm that confident with it.
[02:50:07.788 --> 02:50:09.309]  And you know, I'm transparent.
[02:50:09.309 --> 02:50:10.490]  You know, I'm not hiding anything.
[02:50:10.490 --> 02:50:11.871]  I've got nothing to hide.
[02:50:11.871 --> 02:50:13.192]  All the information's out there.
[02:50:13.192 --> 02:50:14.873]  All I'm doing is putting pieces together.
[02:50:14.873 --> 02:50:16.555]  And I hate to be the messenger, but hey, look.
[02:50:17.068 --> 02:50:23.515]  We need more of them because we're headed towards a brick wall at 90 miles an hour and we're all arguing who's in the front seat, people.
[02:50:23.515 --> 02:50:25.718]  We need to stop watching these stupid shows.
[02:50:25.718 --> 02:50:28.341]  I mean, I hate to say this, but we got to wake up.
[02:50:28.341 --> 02:50:34.428]  We got a country that's on imminent different forms of collapses and, you know, illegal wars.
[02:50:35.094 --> 02:50:37.877]  And we can do something to stop it now, if we get involved.
[02:50:37.877 --> 02:50:41.480]  We certainly can, Jonathan, and we're going to do the final segment with you on the other side.
[02:50:41.480 --> 02:50:48.005]  We're going to take more calls, and then in the final hour, over at PrisonPlanet.tv, you get the video feed, you can see my pretty face.
[02:50:48.005 --> 02:50:49.427]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:49.427 --> 02:50:52.249]  A new world order.
[02:50:52.249 --> 02:50:53.170]  In the near future.
[02:50:54.068 --> 02:50:57.109]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:57.109 --> 02:50:59.950]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:50:59.950 --> 02:51:02.731]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[02:51:02.731 --> 02:51:05.932]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:05.932 --> 02:51:13.234]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:16.277 --> 02:51:21.721]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:21.721 --> 02:51:25.123]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:47.118 --> 02:51:50.261]  Hi neighbor, this is Steve Schenck, Fearless Task Force.
[02:51:50.261 --> 02:51:53.805]  Life is a gamble, but you can stack the deck.
[02:51:53.805 --> 02:52:03.734]  If you knew what I know about all the problems food will protect you from, you'd start immediately to put every effort and dollar you can get into the biggest supply of food possible.
[02:52:03.734 --> 02:52:08.980]  When the dollar and economy crash, when the imported and genetically poisoned food is all that's left,
[02:52:09.620 --> 02:52:18.184]  When the quarantine and bird flu hit, our only protection and only chance to be fearless is having control of our own supply of food and enough of it.
[02:52:18.184 --> 02:52:26.408]  But if you knew what we haven't yet discovered, you wouldn't waste time listening to the rest of this announcement before charging out and getting a serious food supply.
[02:52:26.408 --> 02:52:29.629]  Decide, it's food now or probably never.
[02:52:29.629 --> 02:52:30.890]  But can you afford to be wrong?
[02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:32.772]  Decide now.
[02:52:32.772 --> 02:52:34.334]  Place your bet.
[02:52:34.334 --> 02:52:36.177]  Can you afford to be wrong?
[02:52:36.177 --> 02:52:37.639]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com.
[02:52:37.639 --> 02:52:37.999]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:52:47.142 --> 02:52:48.043]  Attention gardeners!
[02:52:48.043 --> 02:52:50.645]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[02:52:50.645 --> 02:52:55.168]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[02:52:55.168 --> 02:53:03.034]  It's called ProtoGrow and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[02:53:03.354 --> 02:53:06.475]  Now, here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[02:53:06.475 --> 02:53:14.119]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[02:53:14.119 --> 02:53:19.942]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[02:53:19.942 --> 02:53:25.764]  Proto-Gro's full-spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[02:53:25.764 --> 02:53:29.006]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[02:53:29.306 --> 02:53:32.907]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[02:53:32.907 --> 02:53:37.970]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[02:53:37.970 --> 02:53:40.891]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:53:40.891 --> 02:53:41.131]  That's 877-327-0365.
[02:53:58.936 --> 02:54:01.977]  I wish a buck was still silver.
[02:54:01.977 --> 02:54:10.919]  It was back when the country was strong.
[02:54:10.919 --> 02:54:23.022]  Back before Elvis and before the Vietnam War came along.
[02:54:23.022 --> 02:54:25.802]  Before the Beatles and yesterday.
[02:54:28.888 --> 02:54:33.752]  When a man could still work, still would.
[02:54:33.752 --> 02:54:42.099]  It's the best of the free life behind us now.
[02:54:42.099 --> 02:54:47.883]  And are the good times really over for good?
[02:54:47.883 --> 02:54:58.112]  And are we rolling downhill like a snowball headed for hell?
[02:55:03.632 --> 02:55:04.212]  We're good.
[02:55:21.437 --> 02:55:24.339]  All right, it is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:24.339 --> 02:55:27.022]  I am Jason Bermas, in for Alex Jones.
[02:55:27.022 --> 02:55:32.686]  Infowars.com is the website, folks, and you can go to Infowars.com and get this feed.
[02:55:32.686 --> 02:55:41.433]  After we're done, if you missed any of the first, you know, jam-packed three hours, you're going to want to listen to this one because I can't believe what they're printing at the post, man.
[02:55:41.433 --> 02:55:43.495]  Bush Basher smashes disabled teen.
[02:55:44.170 --> 02:55:46.252]  Bush basher smashes disabled teen.
[02:55:46.252 --> 02:55:47.332]  Now they lie about him.
[02:55:47.332 --> 02:55:51.415]  They say that he was screaming obscenities at Laura and Jenna Bush.
[02:55:51.415 --> 02:55:51.916]  That's not true.
[02:55:51.916 --> 02:55:54.037]  I didn't hear one curse word out of these guys.
[02:55:54.037 --> 02:56:01.023]  I'm sure they were talking about, you know, the fact that their husband or Laura's husband is a globalist pig.
[02:56:01.023 --> 02:56:01.523]  Okay?
[02:56:01.523 --> 02:56:02.724]  He's a member of Skull and Bones.
[02:56:03.499 --> 02:56:04.640]  You know, he's a criminal.
[02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:07.441]  He needs to be brought up on war crimes.
[02:56:07.441 --> 02:56:09.982]  Okay, I'm sick of the propaganda.
[02:56:09.982 --> 02:56:16.966]  And we have Jonathan Elanoff for the next few minutes, and we're gonna go and do Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth, but we are at the bottom of the hour, Jonathan.
[02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:21.908]  So I was just hoping that you'd give out a couple websites and wrap it up where people can get in touch with your information.
[02:56:23.078 --> 02:56:24.199]  Sure.
[02:56:24.199 --> 02:56:33.049]  Well, I'm an activist at We Are Change Colorado with all the other great members there at WeAreChangeColorado.org.
[02:56:33.049 --> 02:56:36.353]  I write on the website TruthAlliance.net.
[02:56:36.353 --> 02:56:42.920]  You can see I just posted an article called Missing Nukes, Dead Soldiers, and what these all have in common.
[02:56:44.041 --> 02:56:52.986]  For those who maybe forgot about the missing nukes case last year, it all connects to a famous 9-11 whistleblower who was also poisoned, all related to Barksdale Air Force Base.
[02:56:52.986 --> 02:56:54.687]  That's on TruthAlliance.net.
[02:56:54.687 --> 02:57:04.933]  I encourage everyone to familiarize themselves with this information, because it's a dropping story, and it's dropping very quickly, and we should really be following up on this information out there.
[02:57:04.933 --> 02:57:11.958]  If anyone can, and they're available to go to the Barksdale Air Force Base or Manoa Air Force Base, please go there, start asking questions, get an investigation.
[02:57:12.758 --> 02:57:15.079]  There's no reason for nukes to be missing.
[02:57:15.079 --> 02:57:19.560]  And then, of course, I'm also starting JoinRAW and the Republicans Against the War Activist Group.
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:22.781]  You can go to joinRAW.com and see the ads for that.
[02:57:22.781 --> 02:57:25.122]  We're still organizing that site.
[02:57:25.122 --> 02:57:34.985]  So, you know, it's always a pleasure being on the show and sharing the information with you, Burmese, and it's always fun meeting somebody on the sidelines here in this battle.
[02:57:35.712 --> 02:57:43.440]  Absolutely, and you really have brought a lot of people in in Colorado through your activism, through one man, with the will to bring the truth to the people.
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:45.583]  It always starts with one, folks, okay?
[02:57:45.583 --> 02:57:47.565]  You've got to make the decision in your heart.
[02:57:48.146 --> 02:57:50.128]  That you want to make change in this world.
[02:57:50.128 --> 02:57:51.910]  And that's why We Are Change exists.
[02:57:51.910 --> 02:57:52.450]  Okay?
[02:57:52.450 --> 02:57:54.072]  That's why TruthAction.org exists.
[02:57:54.072 --> 02:57:56.294]  That's why Lone Lantern exists.
[02:57:56.294 --> 02:57:56.474]  Okay?
[02:57:56.474 --> 02:57:59.217]  That's why InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com exists.
[02:57:59.217 --> 02:58:01.078]  Because Alex Jones was fed up!
[02:58:01.078 --> 02:58:08.826]  Top of the hour we got student scholars for 9-11 Truth and then a surprise guest telling us what happened at this confrontation in New York City at We Are Change.
[02:58:08.826 --> 02:58:09.907]  We'll be back after this.
[02:58:09.907 --> 02:58:12.289]  PrisonPlanet.tv for the video feed.
[02:58:12.289 --> 02:58:13.170]  Final hour coming up.
[02:58:29.619 --> 02:58:31.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:38.223]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:38.223 --> 02:58:51.370]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[02:58:51.370 --> 02:58:55.192]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:58:55.532 --> 02:59:02.434]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:59:02.434 --> 02:59:05.836]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:59:05.836 --> 02:59:07.596]  From hijackers being trained at U.S.
[02:59:07.596 --> 02:59:13.718]  military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.
[02:59:13.718 --> 02:59:20.981]  Secure your copy of Loose Change Final Cut today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com while you're visiting the online video store.
[02:59:21.201 --> 02:59:29.364]  Be sure to check out the huge discounts on films like Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, America, Freedom to Fascism, and hundreds of other titles.
[02:59:29.364 --> 02:59:31.985]  We're in a no-holds-barred information war.
[02:59:31.985 --> 02:59:40.609]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:59:40.609 --> 02:59:43.010]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.010 --> 02:59:45.791]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:13.095 --> 03:00:18.398]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, it's the Alex Jones Show fourth hour, brand spankin' new.
[03:00:18.398 --> 03:00:20.659]  Second week it's happened, and boy am I excited.
[03:00:20.659 --> 03:00:32.945]  I mean, not only do we have the student scholars on, and we plugged a little bit of their event on May 17th in the first hour, but we're gonna have an eyewitness to what went down over at this We Are Change confrontation.
[03:00:32.945 --> 03:00:34.666]  I mean, it's all over the right-wing blog.
[03:00:34.666 --> 03:00:36.887]  It's on Michelle Malkin's site.
[03:00:36.887 --> 03:00:42.110]  You know, this is gonna be a talking point on the news tonight, that We Are Change attacked
[03:00:42.426 --> 03:00:45.288]  A crippled girl with cerebral palsy.
[03:00:45.288 --> 03:00:49.051]  This is what you're gonna see on Fox News tonight, I promise you.
[03:00:49.051 --> 03:00:51.393]  If you don't see it on O'Reilly, you're gonna see it on Hannity.
[03:00:51.393 --> 03:00:55.736]  And if you don't see it there, you're gonna see it on some other right-wing ridiculous show.
[03:00:55.736 --> 03:00:56.757]  Okay, that's the bottom line.
[03:00:56.757 --> 03:00:59.719]  They are demonizing us.
[03:00:59.719 --> 03:01:06.845]  And that's why it's so important to get these videos, to get, you know, the Road to Tyranny, to get Martial Law, to get Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:01:06.845 --> 03:01:09.627]  Make copies, hand them out, and show people.
[03:01:10.262 --> 03:01:14.828]  The 9-11 Truth Movement just wants, you know, justice for those who carried out the attacks.
[03:01:14.828 --> 03:01:17.912]  We just want our Constitution and Bill of Rights back.
[03:01:17.912 --> 03:01:24.701]  And that's why right now I am completely honored to have one of the co-founders of Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth.
[03:01:24.701 --> 03:01:25.743]  That's SST911.org.
[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:36.242]  On with me right now to talk a little bit of 9-11 truth, and not only talk a little bit of 9-11 truth, but talk about this great symposium that he's put together.
[03:01:36.242 --> 03:01:47.164]  I really didn't get to talk about people other than J. Michael Springman that are going to be there, but Daniel Hopsicker's going to be there, Muhammad Ata in the Venice Flying Circus, Donna Marshall-Connor, and Michelle Little.
[03:01:47.164 --> 03:01:49.965]  Family members are going to be there, as well as Bob McElveen.
[03:01:49.965 --> 03:01:52.566]  If you haven't heard him speak, he's a very powerful speaker.
[03:01:52.566 --> 03:01:54.186]  He's a great guy, too, by the way.
[03:01:54.186 --> 03:01:55.066]  Really nice guy.
[03:01:55.066 --> 03:01:58.347]  Daniel Shinjada, John Gold, Sander Hicks, Barry Zwicker.
[03:01:58.911 --> 03:02:00.371]  Myself.
[03:02:00.371 --> 03:02:02.672]  You know, and I'm going to be showing a little bit of Fabled Enemies there.
[03:02:02.672 --> 03:02:06.453]  It's probably going to be the first place that anybody gets to see this film.
[03:02:06.453 --> 03:02:10.533]  So, Justin, great to have you on the Alex Jones Show with me, buddy.
[03:02:10.533 --> 03:02:12.174]  Well, it's my pleasure.
[03:02:12.174 --> 03:02:14.474]  Thanks a lot for having me on the show.
[03:02:14.474 --> 03:02:23.296]  Well, why don't you tell a little bit about how you got started in this whole movement, what you've been able to accomplish, and then we'll get into what you're doing in May.
[03:02:24.855 --> 03:02:25.275]  Sure.
[03:02:25.275 --> 03:02:33.999]  Well, I first started Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth with Mike Jackman back in February 2007.
[03:02:33.999 --> 03:02:47.845]  So we've been going just a little bit over a year at this point and essentially, you know, it was just set up because we wanted to set up a coalition of students across the world who are seriously looking into this subject.
[03:02:47.845 --> 03:02:49.506]  Now we have about 80 members from
[03:02:50.276 --> 03:02:55.918]  All across the United States, Canada, the UK, and as far away as Japan.
[03:02:55.918 --> 03:03:09.024]  So we're very excited, and we were able to get pretty much every single presidential candidate during this past primary season on record, you know, with their views on a new 9-11 investigation.
[03:03:09.024 --> 03:03:15.586]  And if any of the listeners out there want to learn more, watch the videos, or check us out, they can visit sst911.org.
[03:03:15.586 --> 03:03:17.107]  That's a little bit of the background.
[03:03:18.007 --> 03:03:18.867]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:03:18.867 --> 03:03:21.828]  And you guys have been at it now well over a year.
[03:03:21.828 --> 03:03:27.649]  Michael Jackman, the other co-founder of this organization, his brother Eric Jackman, also highly involved.
[03:03:27.649 --> 03:03:36.131]  And you just started out as a student who was into mass comm in New Hampshire and said, hey, I'm going to do something.
[03:03:36.131 --> 03:03:37.632]  I can get press passes.
[03:03:37.632 --> 03:03:42.653]  And I think the first time we met in person was actually at those primary debates in June, correct?
[03:03:44.502 --> 03:03:46.844]  Yeah, I think that was the first time that we met.
[03:03:46.844 --> 03:03:51.166]  I think I've been on your show prior to that.
[03:03:51.166 --> 03:03:52.467]  But yeah, we were there.
[03:03:52.467 --> 03:03:56.289]  I think it was the Republican debates back in June, was it?
[03:03:56.289 --> 03:03:57.230]  Yeah, absolutely, in June.
[03:03:57.230 --> 03:04:05.815]  And I mean, I was able, with my press pass, to talk to people like Tommy Thompson, Sam Brownback, James Gilmore, Duncan Hunter, and others.
[03:04:06.531 --> 03:04:19.633]  Uh, about not only the really important issues regarding 9-11, such as the Pakistani funding, the fact that, you know, Bin Laden is supposedly in Pakistan, and, uh, you know, the fact we're not going after these people.
[03:04:20.410 --> 03:04:22.411]  You know, the veil that they're putting on.
[03:04:22.411 --> 03:04:23.872]  The veil of hypocrisy.
[03:04:23.872 --> 03:04:27.115]  The veil that the mainstream media wants us to believe.
[03:04:27.115 --> 03:04:28.796]  Well, I'm not buying it anymore, Justin.
[03:04:28.796 --> 03:04:31.578]  And we're gonna be back, we're gonna be taking calls.
[03:04:31.578 --> 03:04:34.680]  We got Justin Martel, SST911.org.
[03:04:34.680 --> 03:04:38.583]  The New England 9-11 Symposium, coming at you in May, May 17th.
[03:04:38.583 --> 03:04:45.027]  We'll be back to discuss more with Justin Martel.
[03:04:45.027 --> 03:04:46.448]  It is a big idea.
[03:04:46.448 --> 03:04:48.530]  A new world order.
[03:04:49.252 --> 03:04:53.757]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:04:53.757 --> 03:04:56.980]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:04:56.980 --> 03:04:59.763]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:04:59.763 --> 03:05:02.966]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:05:02.966 --> 03:05:10.273]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:05:13.306 --> 03:05:18.750]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:05:18.750 --> 03:05:22.052]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:05:22.052 --> 03:05:25.174]  The Oval Party is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:05:25.174 --> 03:05:26.355]  Most people have no idea.
[03:05:26.355 --> 03:05:27.135]  They're not after money.
[03:05:27.135 --> 03:05:28.396]  They have all the money they need.
[03:05:28.396 --> 03:05:29.017]  They're after power.
[03:05:29.017 --> 03:05:30.538]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:05:42.065 --> 03:05:43.106]  You have been warned.
[03:05:45.568 --> 03:05:46.169]  We're good to go.
[03:05:52.964 --> 03:05:59.228]  The EPA has stated that indoor air is up to five times more polluted than outdoors, causing 50% of all illnesses.

[03:06:34.928 --> 03:06:35.068]  to 10 p.m.
[03:06:35.068 --> 03:06:36.148]  Eastern for our easy pay plan today.
[03:06:44.171 --> 03:06:46.612]  All you men out there, you need to listen up.
[03:06:46.612 --> 03:06:51.914]  By the age of 60, 1 in 2 men already have a prostate-related health issue.
[03:06:51.914 --> 03:06:52.874]  What does this mean?
[03:06:52.874 --> 03:06:54.695]  It might be an enlarged prostate.
[03:06:54.695 --> 03:06:56.895]  Difficulty going to the bathroom.
[03:06:56.895 --> 03:06:58.876]  And a diminished sex drive.
[03:06:58.876 --> 03:07:00.156]  Not a pretty picture.
[03:07:00.156 --> 03:07:04.398]  If you're a man, you need to give your body nutrition to support prostate health.
[03:07:04.398 --> 03:07:05.498]  There's no question about it.
[03:07:05.498 --> 03:07:08.079]  Many people hear this and they might think Saw Palmetto.
[03:07:08.079 --> 03:07:10.400]  But there's something so much better out there.
[03:07:10.780 --> 03:07:17.326]  It's called Beta Prostate, and it contains 3,000 times more healthy plant sterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[03:07:17.326 --> 03:07:21.289]  So before you try anything else, try Beta Prostate.
[03:07:21.289 --> 03:07:24.171]  Ignoring your prostate's not going to make the problems go away.
[03:07:24.171 --> 03:07:29.175]  Taking Beta Prostate is guaranteed to provide effective, all-natural support.
[03:07:29.175 --> 03:07:29.476]  Dial 1-800-457-9914.
[03:07:29.476 --> 03:07:29.696]  That's 1-800-457-9914.

[03:07:42.847 --> 03:07:45.789]  Call now!
[03:07:45.789 --> 03:07:52.414]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:07:52.414 --> 03:07:59.140]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:07:59.140 --> 03:08:03.583]  We are back live folks, fourth hour, video feed over at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:08:05.302 --> 03:08:08.683]  Over there at Infowars.com, they are offering Washington, you're fired!
[03:08:08.683 --> 03:08:11.364]  William Lewis' new picture about D.C.
[03:08:11.364 --> 03:08:13.705]  He's asking some tough questions!
[03:08:13.705 --> 03:08:17.826]  What violations of the Constitution will most directly impact Americans?
[03:08:17.826 --> 03:08:21.227]  And let's, let's try out the little document cam over here.
[03:08:21.227 --> 03:08:25.628]  We got the document cam, and then the VGA thing, and bang, there we go!
[03:08:25.628 --> 03:08:27.729]  There's a, there's a little piece of the cover there.
[03:08:27.729 --> 03:08:29.649]  Let's move it up a little.
[03:08:29.649 --> 03:08:32.110]  There you go, there's William Lewis himself on the cover.
[03:08:32.625 --> 03:08:39.769]  There's Bob Bowman, Maria Heller, and I'm not sure who the other individual is, but all great patriots, and I can't wait to sit down and watch this.
[03:08:39.769 --> 03:08:46.673]  The guy's done some really great work in the past, and you can get that exclusively over at InfoWars.com.
[03:08:46.673 --> 03:09:02.181]  Now, I have Justin Martel from Student Scholars for 9-11 Truth until at least half past the hour, because we're actually going to have, I believe her name is Diane Lipson, who was at this event with We Are Change, who witnessed what really went down, and of course, folks, you know,
[03:09:02.619 --> 03:09:08.802]  Gary did not punch a disabled girl in a wheelchair, but that doesn't stop the New York Post from reporting it.
[03:09:08.802 --> 03:09:11.523]  And then we're going to have Gary on in the fifth hour.
[03:09:11.523 --> 03:09:17.246]  That's right, I'm going to go over about 15-20 minutes and give Gary's side of the whole story.
[03:09:17.246 --> 03:09:21.627]  It should be a jam-packed next hour plus over at the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:21.627 --> 03:09:24.789]  I'm very excited and I want to thank Alex again for letting me sit in.
[03:09:24.789 --> 03:09:31.652]  Justin, this event you're throwing, why don't you let the people know what this event is all about, how it came to be, and how they can get tickets to it.
[03:09:32.964 --> 03:09:38.166]  Okay, so what's going on is on May 17th, we're having the New England 9-11 Symposium.
[03:09:38.166 --> 03:09:43.328]  It's going to be held at Keene High School here in Keene, New Hampshire.
[03:09:43.328 --> 03:09:46.989]  And it'll be doors open at 9 a.m.
[03:09:46.989 --> 03:09:49.110]  The event will start around 930, 945.
[03:09:49.110 --> 03:09:55.592]  Tickets are $15 at the door, $10 for students and $10 for seniors.
[03:09:55.592 --> 03:09:59.794]  And we've got a whole lineup of great guests for everyone.
[03:10:00.874 --> 03:10:08.936]  And the event, the central theme, of course, is family members, whistleblowers, and researchers speak out.
[03:10:08.936 --> 03:10:13.317]  Absolutely, and why don't you name off who's going to be there and why it's so important?
[03:10:13.317 --> 03:10:19.258]  I mean, you've literally got people that have never come out to any of these types of events before.
[03:10:19.258 --> 03:10:25.000]  Okay, well, essentially, there's going to be a way of advocating.
[03:10:26.055 --> 03:10:36.723]  We're going to have Dane Elton Johner, who's the star of the TV program Rescue Me, one of the hardest-working celebrities from 9-11 Truth, and he's tentatively scheduled to host the symposium.
[03:10:36.723 --> 03:10:38.864]  Then we'll have, of course, Bob McElveen, Sr.
[03:10:38.864 --> 03:10:44.008]  He's the father of Bobby McElveen, Jr., who lost his life on 9-11.
[03:10:44.008 --> 03:10:47.130]  And Mr. McElveen attended every 9-11 commission hearing.
[03:10:47.130 --> 03:10:52.034]  As a member of September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, he's traveled all over the world speaking about 9-11.
[03:10:54.139 --> 03:10:57.241]  And one of our researchers will have, of course, Daniel Hopsicker.
[03:10:57.241 --> 03:11:06.725]  He's an investigative journalist and the author of, uh, the author of Welcome to Terrorland, Muhammad Ada, and the 9-11 cover-up in Florida.
[03:11:06.725 --> 03:11:13.769]  Next, of course, we'll have Michelle Little, and she lost her brother, FDNY firefighter David M. Weiss, on 9-11.
[03:11:13.769 --> 03:11:19.292]  And along with 9-11 family members Donna Marshall-Connor and Christina Kimenick, Little called for a real investigation into 9-11.
[03:11:20.299 --> 03:11:23.581]  At the National Press Club in 9-11, on 9-11-2006.
[03:11:23.581 --> 03:11:40.012]  And we'll have Sander Hicks, and he's an author and investigative journalist, and he's done extensive research into the ISI-Pakistan connection to 9-11, and published The Big Wedding, which details the whistleblowers and many conflicts of interest within the 9-11 Commission as well.
[03:11:40.012 --> 03:11:45.616]  And Hicks is going to be speaking about his current investigation into the mysterious death of Dr. David Graham.
[03:11:47.386 --> 03:11:51.769]  We'll have Donna Marshall-Connor, and she's also a very active 9-11 family member.
[03:11:51.769 --> 03:12:00.894]  She lost her daughter in the towers on 9-11, and she was, of course, there with Michelle Little and Christina Kemenyk on 9-11-2006 with the National Press Club.
[03:12:00.894 --> 03:12:08.058]  We'll have Barry Zwicker, who is an award-winning Canadian alternative media journalist, documentary producer, and political activist.
[03:12:08.058 --> 03:12:13.201]  His presentation will concern the media blackout of alternative 9-11 theory.
[03:12:13.201 --> 03:12:14.762]  And then, of course, we'll have you, Jason Bermas.
[03:12:16.836 --> 03:12:31.236]  I think the folks out there know, but you're of course a documentary filmmaker, and your two films, Loose Change 2nd Edition and Loose Change Final Cut, are pretty much responsible for bringing this movement onto the brink of becoming mainstream.
[03:12:31.236 --> 03:12:34.380]  And then we'll have John Gold, who's a longtime researcher and activist.
[03:12:34.970 --> 03:12:41.617]  And he was instrumental in the production of 9-11 Press for Truth and has been an advocate for 9-11 first responders and the Feel Good Foundation.
[03:12:41.617 --> 03:12:48.785]  And not only that, but you know, no matter what happens with me, you're going to be able to see a portion of Fabled Enemies, my new 9-11 picture.
[03:12:48.785 --> 03:12:53.770]  I sent you the script probably like two weeks ago now, and you've read through quite a bit of it, obviously.
[03:12:53.770 --> 03:12:56.553]  It's undergone a few changes and I've edited the first
[03:12:57.428 --> 03:13:00.250]  10 or 15 minutes over here in Austin, Texas.
[03:13:00.250 --> 03:13:02.091]  It's looking really great.
[03:13:02.091 --> 03:13:03.372]  I'm stoked, you know.
[03:13:03.372 --> 03:13:06.414]  I think we need more projects to bring in more people.
[03:13:06.414 --> 03:13:12.238]  For some reason, you know, loose change second edition or loose change final cut may not be everyone's cup of tea.
[03:13:12.238 --> 03:13:18.582]  And this really does cover a lot of issues that the movement has largely ignored or marginalized.
[03:13:18.582 --> 03:13:19.062]  Definitely.
[03:13:19.062 --> 03:13:23.405]  I think that you focus on a lot of information that's out there, but a lot of people
[03:13:25.709 --> 03:13:34.337]  And it's a lot of very solid information that I think should be looked at and propagated by the movement more.
[03:13:34.337 --> 03:13:40.702]  And then, of course, I left out Michael Springman, who you mentioned earlier, who will be at the event.
[03:13:40.702 --> 03:13:49.109]  And Springman was, for those who don't know, he's a government whistleblower who, while working for the State Department, was the head U.S.
[03:13:49.109 --> 03:13:51.551]  consular official in the CIA-controlled U.S.
[03:13:51.551 --> 03:13:53.173]  consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
[03:13:53.902 --> 03:13:55.283]  And they were working with their asset, Osama Bin Laden.
[03:13:55.283 --> 03:13:56.963]  This was also told to him.
[03:14:20.872 --> 03:14:30.717]  You know, so this nonsense that the .gov sites put out that they never supported Bin Laden and in fact when they supported the Mujahideen, they used the ISI as a conduit.
[03:14:30.717 --> 03:14:34.359]  In other words, they give the ISI money and then they would give it to the Mujahideen.
[03:14:34.359 --> 03:14:35.220]  That is true.
[03:14:35.220 --> 03:14:36.820]  They did do that, okay?
[03:14:36.820 --> 03:14:44.564]  They've used the ISI just like they used them on 9-11 to fund their operations and have that plausible deniability, if you will.
[03:14:44.564 --> 03:14:45.685]  But this guy was an asset.
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:46.820]  Okay?
[03:14:46.820 --> 03:14:52.184]  Osama Bin Laden's family, the Bin Laden family and the Bush family were as tight as you can get.
[03:14:52.184 --> 03:14:52.424]  Okay?
[03:14:52.424 --> 03:15:01.611]  And then on top of that, you know, you have a CIA whistleblower who's working in the consulate at Jeddah finding out that Bin Laden is part of this whole plan!
[03:15:01.611 --> 03:15:03.272]  But the media just ignores it.
[03:15:03.272 --> 03:15:04.453]  They don't put him on the news.
[03:15:04.453 --> 03:15:11.198]  I think the most mainstream coverage that Springman actually got was one CBC interview that they took off their site, by the way.
[03:15:11.198 --> 03:15:15.841]  It's archived by Paul Joseph Watson over at his own site, I think, Propaganda Matrix.
[03:15:18.221 --> 03:15:21.344]  But it's incredible what he says, and that's also going to make my new movie.
[03:15:21.344 --> 03:15:23.285]  I think it's an important piece of the puzzle.
[03:15:23.285 --> 03:15:26.067]  I think it's been overlooked for far too long.
[03:15:26.067 --> 03:15:29.029]  And it's time for this information to go mainstream.
[03:15:29.029 --> 03:15:37.375]  It's time for people to understand that this administration and the previous administration and the administration before that are all corrupt.
[03:15:37.375 --> 03:15:38.816]  They're all part of this thing.
[03:15:38.816 --> 03:15:39.997]  It's not about Republican.
[03:15:39.997 --> 03:15:41.698]  It's not about Democrat.
[03:15:41.698 --> 03:15:43.839]  You know, the Clinton administration is culpable.
[03:15:43.839 --> 03:15:46.021]  The Bush administration is very culpable.
[03:15:46.291 --> 03:15:53.534]  I mean, they've passed outlandish legislation after the fact that really makes them, I guess, even bigger demons in my eyes.
[03:15:53.534 --> 03:16:07.619]  But when, you know, Bill Clinton gets confronted, and he's been confronted, folks, all over the country now, about Bilderberg, about Bohemian Grove, and about 9-11, it disgusts me that that pompous criminal says, how dare you?
[03:16:07.619 --> 03:16:09.860]  How dare you say it's an inside job?
[03:16:09.860 --> 03:16:11.461]  How dare you, Bill Clinton?
[03:16:12.682 --> 03:16:15.983]  You know, I know you ran coke for the Bush family in the 80s.
[03:16:15.983 --> 03:16:17.283]  I know about Mena, Arkansas.
[03:16:17.283 --> 03:16:18.804]  People are waking up.
[03:16:18.804 --> 03:16:20.364]  You're gonna have your day, too.
[03:16:20.364 --> 03:16:24.325]  Okay, just because you were slick on the television doesn't give you a pass.
[03:16:24.325 --> 03:16:26.446]  Justin, you wanna take some calls?
[03:16:26.446 --> 03:16:27.346]  Sure, let's do it.
[03:16:27.346 --> 03:16:27.947]  Well, let's do it.
[03:16:27.947 --> 03:16:29.027]  Let's take some calls.
[03:16:29.027 --> 03:16:31.588]  Let's see if Brian is still there from Alabama.
[03:16:31.588 --> 03:16:34.488]  Brian, are you with us?
[03:16:34.488 --> 03:16:34.869]  Uh, he did.
[03:16:34.869 --> 03:16:37.889]  We got Mark in Oregon?
[03:16:37.889 --> 03:16:38.890]  Yes, hello, Jason.
[03:16:38.890 --> 03:16:39.570]  Hey, how you doing, Mark?
[03:16:39.986 --> 03:16:46.368]  I'm doing fairly well, sir, and thank you very much for all your efforts in exposing these atrocities we go through.
[03:16:46.368 --> 03:16:47.648]  Well, thanks for listening.
[03:16:47.648 --> 03:16:48.348]  Yes, sir.
[03:16:48.348 --> 03:16:50.109]  Thank you for being there.
[03:16:50.109 --> 03:17:00.171]  Jason, by the way, I have something basically to mention about the Pentagon, but before that, you mentioned the Simpsons program.
[03:17:00.171 --> 03:17:08.393]  And I remember Alex, several months ago, it wasn't that long ago, he had mentioned on his show that in one of the programs
[03:17:08.772 --> 03:17:37.960]  Bart and his family took a trip to New York City, and it was, this was before 9-11 when this episode came out, and I'm not sure if you saw it or not, and that Bart Simpson was out sightseeing with his family, and he looked up at the Twin Towers, and the Twin Towers were off in the distance, and then all of a sudden a nine appeared in the area of the Twin Towers in the far view, and Bart held up his fingers like one and one, or in a V sign, or two fingers,
[03:17:38.803 --> 03:17:44.437]  to right by the nine to turn it into a very uh... you know you could assume that that was saying nine eleven
[03:17:45.413 --> 03:17:58.863]  Well, I know what episode you're talking about, because there's only one episode where the Simpsons actually go to New York City, and I believe Homer goes into both Twin Towers because he has to urinate after drinking several cans of crab juice.
[03:17:58.863 --> 03:18:02.365]  That's the kind of Simpsons geek I am, folks.
[03:18:02.365 --> 03:18:04.046]  I've seen every episode.
[03:18:04.046 --> 03:18:07.168]  And I don't remember that slight part, but boy, is that interesting.
[03:18:07.168 --> 03:18:08.729]  And I'm definitely going to check that out.
[03:18:08.729 --> 03:18:11.251]  But I mean, we have them on the lone gunman.
[03:18:12.867 --> 03:18:24.453]  I guess the X-Files spin-off show where the government has decided that they're going to remotely fly a commercial airliner into the Twin Towers and blame it on Arab terrorists.
[03:18:24.453 --> 03:18:28.555]  Yeah, and I know the Nazis.
[03:18:28.555 --> 03:18:33.118]  I've understood that they actually did artistic renditions, basically.
[03:18:33.118 --> 03:18:40.522]  They would have artists and perhaps even photographic artists, so to speak, gathered into a room or rooms in different places.
[03:18:41.497 --> 03:18:47.940]  And, for instance, before the invasion of Poland, they actually graphically represented it all out ahead of time.
[03:18:47.940 --> 03:19:02.705]  And I think, from what I've heard of that, it may have more significance outside of the occult, but that it's essentially an occult method of projection of desire or objective into reality through a telepathic means, essentially, through a spiritual means.
[03:19:02.705 --> 03:19:09.808]  But, you know, what I call today, essentially, about Jason has mostly to do with the Pentagon.
[03:19:11.505 --> 03:19:18.367]  Uh, there's a film that was made, uh, five years ago, maybe a little longer ago, by a man named Eric Huffschmidt.
[03:19:18.367 --> 03:19:22.589]  And the film was called Troubling Questions, and I was wondering if you'd seen or heard of this film.
[03:19:22.589 --> 03:19:24.789]  I have seen, uh, Eric Huffschmidt's work.
[03:19:24.789 --> 03:19:27.210]  I believe it was Painful Questions and Painful Deceptions.
[03:19:27.210 --> 03:19:29.251]  That was the film slash, uh,
[03:19:29.781 --> 03:19:37.663]  Book titles of those and we'll get into those on the other side with you, Mark, so hold over and then we're going to talk to Justin Martel for one more segment.
[03:19:37.663 --> 03:19:44.985]  We're going to tell you where you can get tickets to this symposium on May 17th in New England over in New Hampshire.
[03:19:44.985 --> 03:19:46.326]  It is a big idea.
[03:19:47.461 --> 03:19:49.222]  A New World Order.
[03:19:49.222 --> 03:19:54.123]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[03:19:54.123 --> 03:19:56.944]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:19:56.944 --> 03:19:59.745]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:19:59.745 --> 03:20:02.926]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:20:02.926 --> 03:20:10.228]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:18.713]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:20:18.713 --> 03:20:22.595]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:20:22.595 --> 03:20:25.156]  Bill of America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:20:25.156 --> 03:20:26.317]  Most people have no idea.
[03:20:26.317 --> 03:20:27.097]  They're not after money.
[03:20:27.097 --> 03:20:28.378]  They have all the money they need.
[03:20:28.378 --> 03:20:29.359]  They're after power.
[03:20:29.359 --> 03:20:30.519]  That's what Apple needs here.

[03:20:39.223 --> 03:20:39.983]  Endgame.
[03:20:39.983 --> 03:20:42.024]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[03:20:42.024 --> 03:20:43.884]  You have been warned.
[03:20:43.884 --> 03:20:44.344]  Fact.
[03:20:44.344 --> 03:20:50.366]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[03:20:50.366 --> 03:20:54.687]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[03:20:54.687 --> 03:20:57.428]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design,
[03:20:57.568 --> 03:20:57.808]  I think so.
[03:21:20.009 --> 03:21:20.309]  I think so.
[03:21:43.775 --> 03:21:45.736]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[03:21:45.736 --> 03:21:49.357]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[03:21:49.357 --> 03:21:51.797]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[03:21:51.797 --> 03:21:54.838]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[03:21:54.838 --> 03:22:00.580]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[03:22:00.580 --> 03:22:04.481]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[03:22:04.821 --> 03:22:10.022]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[03:22:10.022 --> 03:22:13.063]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.

[03:22:40.136 --> 03:22:41.898]  Bring down the New World Order.
[03:22:41.898 --> 03:22:42.618]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:22:43.700 --> 03:22:51.703]  World Products now is introducing the new Detoxer Foot and Body Pads that work while you're sleeping to pull heavy metals and toxins from the body.
[03:22:51.703 --> 03:22:59.766]  Our Detoxer Pads release unwanted toxins, relieve stress and pain, and improves the immune system, circulation, and blockages all while you're sleeping.
[03:22:59.766 --> 03:23:03.588]  Very simply, you put one pad on each foot before bedtime and go to sleep.
[03:23:03.588 --> 03:23:07.109]  And when you wake up, the toxins that are drawn out of the body will be in the pads.
[03:23:07.369 --> 03:23:09.351]  You peel them off and throw them away.
[03:23:09.351 --> 03:23:10.252]  It's that simple.
[03:23:10.252 --> 03:23:12.975]  Call 908-691-2608.

[03:23:18.581 --> 03:23:21.704]  The average person is exposed to hundreds of chemicals daily.
[03:23:21.704 --> 03:23:24.567]  This is one of the many powerful ways to detox the body.
[03:23:24.727 --> 03:23:29.612]  We recommend you try our Detoxer Foot Pads and see and feel the difference for yourself.
[03:23:29.612 --> 03:23:32.295]  Call today at 1-908-691-2608.

[03:23:38.001 --> 03:23:38.802]  Call today.
[03:23:38.802 --> 03:23:40.224]  World products now at 1-908-691-2608.
[03:24:08.210 --> 03:24:09.631]  We're back!
[03:24:09.631 --> 03:24:11.671]  And let me tell you folks, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:11.671 --> 03:24:14.392]  There's no other show like it on radio.
[03:24:14.392 --> 03:24:18.893]  We've got Justin Martell, a student scholar for 9-11 Truth with us throughout this segment.
[03:24:18.893 --> 03:24:19.333]  And then in
[03:24:20.302 --> 03:24:35.178]  In a few minutes we're going to have an actual eyewitness to this We Are Change thing, and I gotta tell you, I don't think that she saw Gary hit a crippled girl with cerebral palsy in a wheelchair, although that's what they're reporting.
[03:24:35.178 --> 03:24:39.883]  They're reporting that these guys were screaming obscenities, aka cursing, and hurting these people.
[03:24:40.319 --> 03:24:44.442]  Before I go back to Justin Martel, I just want to comment on what the last caller had to say.
[03:24:44.442 --> 03:24:46.723]  Yeah, unfortunately our leaders are into the occult.
[03:24:46.723 --> 03:24:49.125]  Whether you believe in the occult or not, these guys do.
[03:24:49.125 --> 03:24:55.149]  They go to Bohemian Grove, they take part in the ritual of the cremation of care, so it's not up for debate.
[03:24:55.149 --> 03:24:57.331]  You know, I'm not saying the occult works or, you know,
[03:24:57.844 --> 03:24:58.885]  There's Satan worshipers.
[03:24:58.885 --> 03:25:05.551]  All's I know is that they do join these societies like Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove, and they seem to be in the occult.
[03:25:05.551 --> 03:25:12.397]  I mean, there's History Channel documentaries about how Hitler thought he had occultic powers, and he would use symbolism.
[03:25:12.397 --> 03:25:13.598]  So that is creepy.
[03:25:13.598 --> 03:25:20.284]  And then as far as his other question about that other documentary, and he's talking about the Pentagon, I would assume he's probably talking about the part
[03:25:20.922 --> 03:25:28.186]  Where people are actually picking up these small pieces of debris for the FBI, and we do include that in Loose Change Final Cut.
[03:25:28.186 --> 03:25:31.889]  If I'm not answering your question, Mark, I do a little show on GCN as well.
[03:25:31.889 --> 03:25:34.170]  You can check me out at Stream 4.
[03:25:34.170 --> 03:25:39.633]  I believe it is 7 to 9 Central Time, or it might be 6 to 8 Central Time.
[03:25:39.633 --> 03:25:40.034]  I'm not sure.
[03:25:40.034 --> 03:25:46.317]  I just moved into the slot over at GCNlive.com, so you can check me out there.
[03:25:46.317 --> 03:25:48.919]  Justin, where can people get tickets to this symposium?
[03:25:50.137 --> 03:25:56.861]  People can go to sst911.org and there's information right up on the front page there.
[03:25:56.861 --> 03:25:59.823]  You just click that and that'll bring you to the events section.
[03:25:59.823 --> 03:26:04.006]  And there's write-ups and bios of all our guests.
[03:26:04.006 --> 03:26:08.249]  There's a flyer that you can download for people in the New England area.
[03:26:08.249 --> 03:26:10.370]  We could definitely use your help if you want to download that flyer.
[03:26:10.370 --> 03:26:11.451]  Print it out.
[03:26:11.451 --> 03:26:13.192]  Post it up around town.
[03:26:13.192 --> 03:26:14.412]  And there's information there.
[03:26:14.412 --> 03:26:15.653]  You can send me an email.
[03:26:17.586 --> 03:26:25.259]  Or give me a call, and we can talk about various pre-registration available for the conference, and you can of course buy tickets at the door.
[03:26:25.259 --> 03:26:27.563]  And folks, I gotta encourage you to come out to this event.
[03:26:27.563 --> 03:26:29.046]  These are some of my favorite people.
[03:26:29.565 --> 03:26:31.025]  in the 9-11 truth movement.
[03:26:31.025 --> 03:26:32.206]  They are the hard workers.
[03:26:32.206 --> 03:26:34.827]  They are the ones that confronted Barack Obama.
[03:26:34.827 --> 03:26:40.968]  They are the ones that got Ron Paul to say that he would commit to a new 9-11 investigation, an independent one.
[03:26:40.968 --> 03:26:45.370]  They are the ones that are on the streets and really doing it up.
[03:26:45.370 --> 03:26:48.531]  And, you know, I don't think the organization is big enough, quite frankly.
[03:26:48.531 --> 03:26:54.332]  If you are in college and you're a member of We Are Change but you're not a student scholar for 9-11 truth, consider joining.
[03:26:54.332 --> 03:26:55.573]  I'm begging you.
[03:26:55.573 --> 03:26:56.973]  You need to join this organization.
[03:26:57.313 --> 03:27:02.458]  These guys are top-notch individuals, they're stand-up guys, they're smart, and they're funny, too.
[03:27:02.458 --> 03:27:07.462]  You know, they've got a whole other thing going on other than 9-11 truth, although that is the focus.
[03:27:07.462 --> 03:27:15.229]  And Justin Martel is really just one of the nicest human beings I've come across in this movement, and I consider him a really good friend.
[03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:22.175]  Justin, what's your take on the New York Post now reporting that, you know, we are changed as assaulting people in wheelchairs?
[03:27:23.355 --> 03:27:41.407]  Oh, God, I mean, yeah, I was actually just reading about this in journalism class while I was supposed to be paying attention, but I was looking this over, and I was trying to understand, like, what would be the motivation to beat up a girl in a wheelchair?
[03:27:41.407 --> 03:27:52.074]  To me, the way it sounded, it sounds like the family of this girl in the wheelchair, they were supporters of President Bush, and
[03:27:52.992 --> 03:27:58.156]  I think it sounded like the dad got agitated and started to beat up on Gary is what it sounds like to me.
[03:27:58.156 --> 03:28:01.659]  Um, and probably later used it as an excuse.
[03:28:01.659 --> 03:28:06.443]  You know, he was hitting my daughter in the wheelchair to get out of it and avoid charges.
[03:28:06.443 --> 03:28:07.524]  Yeah, it's pretty incredible.
[03:28:07.524 --> 03:28:16.351]  And I'm reading her, uh, her deposition here to the police and it doesn't say anything about, uh, you know, Gary punching anybody.
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:21.865]  And again, it actually says that he was being punched, I believe.
[03:28:21.865 --> 03:28:25.448]  I mean, we're going to have her on in only moments, Justin.
[03:28:25.448 --> 03:28:28.631]  But, you know, it's going to be a smear job in the media.
[03:28:28.631 --> 03:28:32.815]  It's going to be a talking point for a couple of days, and I doubt there's ever going to be a retraction.
[03:28:32.815 --> 03:28:36.138]  And this is how they like to handle the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[03:28:36.138 --> 03:28:37.479]  They like to lie about us.
[03:28:37.479 --> 03:28:39.020]  They like to distort the truth.
[03:28:39.020 --> 03:28:42.804]  I mean, you saw, did you see what happened to those guys over at the UK Change?
[03:28:45.304 --> 03:28:54.862]  Uh, yes, yes, where the guy tripped over a camera, he tried to take the camera and then tripped and fell and then they said, uh, UK changed, pushed him over.
[03:28:54.862 --> 03:28:55.643]  Absolutely, they...
[03:28:56.340 --> 03:28:57.500]  ...are out there with a camera.
[03:28:57.500 --> 03:28:59.941]  They are being the new media, which I encourage.
[03:28:59.941 --> 03:29:01.282]  We have to be the new media.
[03:29:01.282 --> 03:29:06.343]  We can't rely on CBS, NBC, BBC, CBC, all these C-networks.
[03:29:06.343 --> 03:29:08.064]  We need to become the media, and what happens?
[03:29:08.064 --> 03:29:09.244]  They're demonized.
[03:29:09.244 --> 03:29:12.405]  SST911.org is the website.
[03:29:12.405 --> 03:29:14.065]  The event takes place May 17th.
[03:29:14.065 --> 03:29:15.606]  Hey, no problem.
[03:29:15.606 --> 03:29:17.286]  I hope you do my Sunday show soon.
[03:29:17.286 --> 03:29:21.488]  And we're going to be back with Diane Lipson right after this.
[03:29:21.488 --> 03:29:22.348]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[03:29:34.946 --> 03:29:38.873]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[03:29:38.873 --> 03:29:41.558]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:46.457 --> 03:29:47.818]  I'm Harold Williams.
[03:29:47.818 --> 03:29:49.900]  I know about martial law.
[03:29:49.900 --> 03:29:51.801]  I want to teach you how to survive it.
[03:29:51.801 --> 03:30:00.747]  America has 10 telling signs of martial law, so use the short time left to learn to protect your family with the vital information in this book.
[03:30:00.747 --> 03:30:03.509]  Find the book at survivemartiallaw.com.
[03:30:03.509 --> 03:30:06.972]  I will tell you what you need to know to prepare for martial law.
[03:30:06.972 --> 03:30:08.253]  Things are changing fast.

[03:31:45.000 --> 03:31:50.082]  You can trace every disease, every illness, and every ailment to mineral deficiency.
[03:31:50.082 --> 03:31:53.964]  That is a quote from two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
[03:31:53.964 --> 03:32:03.648]  Because fruits and vegetables in their raw form are better absorbed, retained, and utilized than if heated, the Champion Juicer is the best way to get your nutrients your body craves.
[03:32:03.648 --> 03:32:08.050]  The Champion Juicer chews the fibers and breaks up the cells of vegetables and fruits.

[03:32:11.892 --> 03:32:22.183]  Juicing a combination of raw fruits and vegetables is documented to not only treat minor illness, but also is shown to reverse once thought incurable, life-threatening diseases.
[03:32:22.183 --> 03:32:27.308]  Juicing with the Champion Juicer also promotes fast, healthy weight loss and pure body cleansing.
[03:32:27.308 --> 03:32:29.991]  Put the Champion Juicer to work for you and your family.
[03:32:30.151 --> 03:32:34.835]  Get creative with your juicer and add a grain mill attachment to make your own healthy, fresh flour.
[03:32:34.835 --> 03:32:39.058]  The Champion Juicer also makes great nut butters and frozen sorbets.
[03:32:39.058 --> 03:32:41.740]  The world's finest juicer is Champion Juicer.

[03:33:05.056 --> 03:33:06.656]  Get up, stand up!
[03:33:06.656 --> 03:33:11.259]  Stand up for your rights!
[03:33:11.259 --> 03:33:13.200]  Get up, stand up!
[03:33:13.200 --> 03:33:17.722]  Don't give up the fight!
[03:33:17.722 --> 03:33:24.405]  Preacher man, don't tell me Heaven is under the earth.
[03:33:24.405 --> 03:33:29.308]  I know you don't know What life is really worth.
[03:33:29.308 --> 03:33:31.669]  It's a thought that bitterly scolds
[03:33:40.539 --> 03:33:44.184]  That's right, we need to stand up for our rights!
[03:33:44.184 --> 03:33:45.245]  We need to get out in the street.
[03:33:45.245 --> 03:33:48.469]  We need to do what Gary did from We Are Change.
[03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:51.333]  Even if you're gonna get your, uh, you know, face bruised up.
[03:33:52.108 --> 03:34:11.032]  Your lips split and then get charged with assaulting a crippled girl with cerebral palsy because that's what they're charging with not only in a court of law but in the court of public opinion by publishing this garbage in the New York Post and before we go to Diane Lipson who was there and can tell us what she saw and believe me I just read her
[03:34:11.880 --> 03:34:12.681]  Her email.
[03:34:12.681 --> 03:34:17.524]  I mean the police apparently refused to take her testimony even though she went down to the station.
[03:34:17.524 --> 03:34:20.287]  I want to plug murrayandron.com.
[03:34:20.287 --> 03:34:25.010]  This is about a US Senate race and there's going to be a rally in New York City on April 28th.
[03:34:25.010 --> 03:34:26.411]  That's murrayandron.com.
[03:34:26.411 --> 03:34:27.732]  You can go check it out there.
[03:34:27.732 --> 03:34:31.936]  I think they're giving away two free trips to New York City with your donation.
[03:34:31.936 --> 03:34:34.037]  They're going to have some kind of a raffle or whatever.
[03:34:34.037 --> 03:34:35.318]  But a very good organization.
[03:34:35.318 --> 03:34:38.661]  Go check that out over at murrayandron.com.
[03:34:38.661 --> 03:34:40.042]  Now we're going to take your calls also.
[03:34:40.609 --> 03:34:44.132]  But I do want to talk to Diane, and we're going to have Gary in overdrive.
[03:34:44.132 --> 03:34:46.154]  But, uh, Diane, are you with us?
[03:34:46.154 --> 03:34:47.675]  Yes, I am.
[03:34:47.675 --> 03:34:48.896]  Well, you were there, Diane.
[03:34:48.896 --> 03:34:52.559]  Why don't you describe the night and then what happened?
[03:34:52.559 --> 03:34:53.980]  Well, okay.
[03:34:53.980 --> 03:35:04.869]  Um, a Secret Service person had a stand in an area that was, you know, I guess several yards away from where the bushes were going to get into a waiting van.
[03:35:04.869 --> 03:35:07.832]  Um, there were some, or a few words between Gary and the agent.
[03:35:08.588 --> 03:35:18.698]  Um, and there was a little knot of people waiting to, um, there was a little knot of people waiting to, you know, see the Bush women, you know, get escorted into the van.
[03:35:18.698 --> 03:35:23.603]  And Gary was, you know, he was talking and he was exercising his right of free speech.
[03:35:23.603 --> 03:35:25.685]  I don't exactly remember what he was saying to them.
[03:35:26.089 --> 03:35:28.330]  But people in the crowd were kind of hostile to him.
[03:35:28.330 --> 03:35:31.191]  This is the Upper East Side of New York.
[03:35:31.191 --> 03:35:33.851]  It's kind of a wealthy, liberal area.
[03:35:33.851 --> 03:35:37.593]  Not exactly people who were, like, you know, in tune with our message.
[03:35:37.593 --> 03:35:42.734]  So, there was a man in a blue jacket.
[03:35:42.734 --> 03:35:48.216]  He was with his wife and, I guess, I think it was two daughters, but one daughter was in a wheelchair.
[03:35:48.955 --> 03:35:51.816]  And he was taking particular exception to what Gary was saying.
[03:35:51.816 --> 03:35:55.277]  And at one point, he even made a threatening gesture to Gary.
[03:35:55.277 --> 03:35:59.978]  He cocked his fist at Gary, and he had this weird, thick, half-smile on his face.
[03:35:59.978 --> 03:36:08.301]  And I had, like, a big moment of cognitive dissonance, because I'm wondering, why is this man acting like this with his family right there?
[03:36:08.301 --> 03:36:10.401]  Okay, so the Bushwomen get into the van.
[03:36:10.401 --> 03:36:12.202]  Gary shouts at them about 9-11.
[03:36:12.202 --> 03:36:14.522]  And he had to shout, because they were far away.
[03:36:14.522 --> 03:36:16.123]  Then we're all walking away.
[03:36:16.881 --> 03:36:22.064]  And I see the man, I think he was wheeling the chair, right?
[03:36:22.064 --> 03:36:44.479]  I see everybody walking up the street, it's like a little bit of an incline, but instead of walking straight up the block, the man veered into the side of the building where Gary was, and then I hear him say that Gary touched his daughter, and then I see him beating up on Gary, and if Gary fought back, I didn't see it.
[03:36:44.986 --> 03:36:46.047]  He's beating Gary up.
[03:36:46.047 --> 03:36:48.088]  I'm trying to get my still camera out.
[03:36:48.088 --> 03:36:48.808]  I wasn't able to.
[03:36:48.808 --> 03:36:50.329]  I'm trying to pull the guy off.
[03:36:50.329 --> 03:36:53.751]  And this woman is telling the man to stop.
[03:36:53.751 --> 03:36:56.113]  The wife was telling the man to stop.
[03:36:56.113 --> 03:37:10.081]  And of course, looking back, if what she said in the New York Post article, if Gary had really done anything to this woman's daughter, why would she be telling this man
[03:37:10.751 --> 03:37:11.572]  To back off.
[03:37:11.572 --> 03:37:14.213]  Why would she be telling him to stop, you know?
[03:37:14.213 --> 03:37:20.298]  Yeah, if he had actually physically threatened that girl in the wheelchair, there's no way that she would stop her husband from defending him.
[03:37:20.298 --> 03:37:21.178]  Exactly.
[03:37:21.178 --> 03:37:24.801]  And also, there's no way that Gary would do anything like that.
[03:37:24.801 --> 03:37:30.905]  The whole reason that Gary is in this movement is to protect people, and to protect women, and to protect families.
[03:37:30.905 --> 03:37:36.769]  Gary's kind of an old-fashioned guy, and I know his instinct is to protect women and children.
[03:37:36.769 --> 03:37:38.290]  That's the kind of a person he is.
[03:37:39.148 --> 03:37:45.675]  Um, so it's ludicrous to suggest that he would ever, ever assault a woman, much less a handicapped woman.
[03:37:45.675 --> 03:37:50.100]  And let's just make it clear, he wasn't shouting any obscenities, he was shouting 9-11 truth.
[03:37:50.100 --> 03:37:52.202]  I did not hear any obscenities, no.
[03:37:52.202 --> 03:37:54.765]  There was no obscenities.
[03:37:54.765 --> 03:37:57.568]  There was no obscenities, and nothing that was threatening.
[03:37:58.601 --> 03:38:00.222]  It was just 9-11 truth.
[03:38:00.222 --> 03:38:05.346]  So they take him down to the station and you go down to the station and you say the man that assaulted him is sitting there.
[03:38:05.346 --> 03:38:06.808]  They take a couple pictures of him.
[03:38:06.808 --> 03:38:08.209]  Yeah, and he gets to leave.
[03:38:08.209 --> 03:38:09.270]  They took some photos of him.
[03:38:09.270 --> 03:38:11.351]  They took some photos of him.
[03:38:11.351 --> 03:38:18.437]  My sense was that they were sympathetic toward this man who assaulted Gary.
[03:38:18.437 --> 03:38:23.241]  I can't be sure about that, but that was kind of my sense.
[03:38:23.241 --> 03:38:24.362]  And it seemed like
[03:38:25.469 --> 03:38:25.649]  That's
[03:38:42.801 --> 03:38:45.283]  I said that I wanted to, you know, make a statement.
[03:38:45.283 --> 03:38:46.324]  They told me to wait.
[03:38:46.324 --> 03:38:51.547]  Two hours later, they told me not to make a statement, that there was no point, or something like that.
[03:38:51.547 --> 03:38:57.551]  I'm still not sure why I didn't get to make a statement, but I came home and, of course, I typed up what I saw and sent it.
[03:38:57.551 --> 03:38:57.811]  Yikes.
[03:39:01.231 --> 03:39:03.752]  Yeah, you typed it up here and it is very exquisite.
[03:39:03.752 --> 03:39:08.412]  We're going to be putting this on InfoWars.com and of course his audio is going to be making it there too.
[03:39:08.412 --> 03:39:15.834]  But let's just be clear, he was never physically intimidating towards anybody, not only this guy or his daughter, but towards the Bush family in general.
[03:39:15.834 --> 03:39:17.734]  He never cursed.
[03:39:17.734 --> 03:39:22.015]  He was exercising his freedom of speech, which we no longer have in this country.
[03:39:22.015 --> 03:39:24.895]  They want to put you in a quote-unquote free speech zone.
[03:39:24.895 --> 03:39:28.376]  And even when he's in that zone, he gets assaulted and then arrested.
[03:39:29.318 --> 03:39:31.580]  He gets assaulted and then arrested, yes.
[03:39:31.580 --> 03:39:32.140]  Exactly.
[03:39:32.140 --> 03:39:38.285]  I'm very frightened for Gary, because Gary, you know, he's a young man.
[03:39:38.285 --> 03:39:46.471]  And because this person could not control his temper, he might be ruining Gary's life.
[03:39:46.471 --> 03:39:48.992]  I think we have to pray for Gary.
[03:39:48.992 --> 03:39:56.498]  In addition to assisting him in other ways, we have to really pray for Gary, and pray for that sick guy who assaulted him, too, because this guy obviously has problems.
[03:39:57.230 --> 03:39:59.072]  Well, let's try to wake this guy up.
[03:39:59.072 --> 03:40:00.174]  I wanna say this.
[03:40:00.174 --> 03:40:02.397]  You know, his wife and his name are in the paper.
[03:40:03.178 --> 03:40:07.721]  Uh, if you, if you can find this man's address, people need to start mailing this guy.
[03:40:07.721 --> 03:40:08.802]  Loose change, final cut.
[03:40:08.802 --> 03:40:11.123]  They need to start mailing him, Terror Storm.
[03:40:11.123 --> 03:40:15.266]  They, they need to know why Gary was there in the first place.
[03:40:15.266 --> 03:40:26.374]  And you know, God willing, maybe this guy's going to retract what he's done, apologize for assaulting another human being, and drop the ludicrous charges that he assaulted his daughter in a wheelchair.
[03:40:26.374 --> 03:40:27.995]  I am, my stomach has just turned.
[03:40:27.995 --> 03:40:32.818]  If you haven't seen this New York Post article yet, it also has four pictures of this young lady.
[03:40:33.398 --> 03:40:34.198]  Of course you are.
[03:40:56.585 --> 03:40:59.308]  Also, Michelle Malkin has written about this now.
[03:40:59.308 --> 03:41:01.029]  She picked up the whole New York Post article.
[03:41:01.029 --> 03:41:01.529]  Oh yeah.
[03:41:01.529 --> 03:41:02.951]  It's going to be on HotIre blog.
[03:41:02.951 --> 03:41:03.471]  I'm telling you.
[03:41:03.471 --> 03:41:04.492]  I'm telling people right now.
[03:41:04.492 --> 03:41:06.173]  It's going to be all over O'Reilly.
[03:41:06.173 --> 03:41:08.255]  It's going to be all over Hannity.
[03:41:08.255 --> 03:41:09.076]  And they love this.
[03:41:09.076 --> 03:41:12.118]  They want to demonize us as a violent group.
[03:41:12.118 --> 03:41:18.023]  Yes, they want people to believe that Gary would actually do something that he would never, never do.
[03:41:18.023 --> 03:41:19.805]  Diane, I thank you so much for the call.
[03:41:19.805 --> 03:41:21.086]  I'm sure Alex Jones is going to be
[03:41:21.576 --> 03:41:26.118]  In touch with you and he's probably going to have you as a guest tomorrow so you can describe all this.
[03:41:26.118 --> 03:41:31.880]  I'm going to let you go and I'm going to take some phone calls and then we're going to have Gary in overdrive so he can tell us everything.
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:37.421]  Diane, thank you again and thanks for trying to make a statement to these jackboot cops who just wouldn't hear it.
[03:41:37.421 --> 03:41:38.082]  Quite alright.
[03:41:38.082 --> 03:41:39.782]  I'm very happy to help, Gary.
[03:41:39.782 --> 03:41:40.903]  Alright, thank you so much.
[03:41:40.903 --> 03:41:45.864]  Alright guys, in the time we got left before we go to Gary, we're going to shoot through some phone calls.
[03:41:45.864 --> 03:41:47.845]  Let's go to Ken in Maryland.
[03:41:47.845 --> 03:41:49.786]  Ken, are you with us?
[03:41:49.786 --> 03:41:50.206]  Hey, Gary.
[03:41:50.885 --> 03:41:52.345]  Hey man, how you doing?
[03:41:52.345 --> 03:41:54.326]  I'm blessed.
[03:41:54.326 --> 03:41:56.426]  I want to go off subject just for a moment.
[03:41:56.426 --> 03:42:05.388]  I just want to let you guys know that there is going to be a Ron Paul campaign conference call tonight.
[03:42:05.388 --> 03:42:06.308]  Can I give the number?
[03:42:06.308 --> 03:42:07.688]  Of course, go ahead.
[03:42:07.688 --> 03:42:09.649]  Okay, it's 605-475-8500 and the access code is 509-2984.
[03:42:21.812 --> 03:42:23.074]  And that's at 9 p.m.
[03:42:23.074 --> 03:42:24.095]  tonight.
[03:42:24.095 --> 03:42:25.296]  At what 9 p.m.?
[03:42:25.296 --> 03:42:25.697]  What time?
[03:42:25.697 --> 03:42:26.938]  Central time?
[03:42:26.938 --> 03:42:28.620]  No, Eastern.
[03:42:28.620 --> 03:42:29.140]  Eastern time.
[03:42:29.140 --> 03:42:29.381]  All right.
[03:42:29.381 --> 03:42:31.303]  Anything else you want to bring up, Ken?
[03:42:31.303 --> 03:42:33.586]  No, just keep fighting the fight, guys.
[03:42:33.586 --> 03:42:34.787]  The truth will prevail.
[03:42:34.787 --> 03:42:36.028]  Truth is truth.
[03:42:36.028 --> 03:42:36.309]  All right.
[03:42:36.309 --> 03:42:36.769]  Thanks, Ken.
[03:42:36.769 --> 03:42:39.112]  We're going to jump to Josh in North Carolina.
[03:42:39.112 --> 03:42:41.054]  Josh, are you with us?
[03:42:41.054 --> 03:42:41.334]  Hello.
[03:42:43.348 --> 03:42:44.648]  How's everybody doing?
[03:42:44.648 --> 03:42:45.129]  Cool.
[03:42:45.129 --> 03:42:51.470]  You know, I'm not doing so great finding out that they're, you know, framing up We Are Change for assaulting young girls in wheelchairs with cerebral palsy.
[03:42:51.470 --> 03:42:53.391]  I'm pretty upset about the whole thing.
[03:42:53.391 --> 03:42:56.532]  Yeah, I'm pretty perturbed myself.
[03:42:56.532 --> 03:43:03.594]  I had something I wanted to say about the whole Pentagon 9-11 thing, but I mean, this is just amazing.
[03:43:03.594 --> 03:43:08.635]  I mean, I'm infuriated by the idea that they're framing us like that.
[03:43:08.635 --> 03:43:11.856]  That's, yeah, ridiculous.
[03:43:13.246 --> 03:43:19.569]  But let me just bring this up about the Pentagon, because I was actually going to bring this up before that.
[03:43:19.569 --> 03:43:20.389]  Okay.
[03:43:20.389 --> 03:43:35.676]  So, it is of my understanding that the DC no-fly zone is protected by automated missile batteries that were, you know, approved under Ike, and then put into place under LBJ and Nixon.
[03:43:36.549 --> 03:43:40.251]  Um, and you know, worked on and updated under Reagan.
[03:43:40.251 --> 03:43:53.738]  Now, these systems are supposed to automatically fire on any jet that flies into the no-fly zone, and the fail-safes on them, from what I understand, are, you know, autonomous.
[03:43:53.738 --> 03:43:56.120]  In other words, no one can shut them down.
[03:43:56.120 --> 03:44:03.484]  So in the event of a war, you know, something happens, that nothing can fly in and basically do what supposedly happened on 9-11.
[03:44:04.364 --> 03:44:09.750]  The only thing that can go into the no-fly zone is something with a military transponder on it.
[03:44:12.467 --> 03:44:13.828]  Yeah!
[03:44:13.828 --> 03:44:15.249]  Well, I mean, I gotta take your point.
[03:44:15.249 --> 03:44:17.870]  I mean, that's the word on the street.
[03:44:17.870 --> 03:44:41.564]  I am baffled by that as well, but I think the mystery may be solved in the fact that Scott Fry signs that memo prior to 9-11, and I mean, just a couple months prior, putting shoot-down orders in the hands of Don Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, and George Bush solely, so colonels and other commanders that would have been able to take out an aircraft, just like you said, with no problem, they took that away.
[03:44:42.424 --> 03:44:44.686]  Exactly.
[03:44:44.686 --> 03:44:46.487]  Well, one of two things probably happened.
[03:44:46.487 --> 03:44:54.352]  Either they signed the order to somehow take that system offline, or what hit the Pentagon was probably a Predator drone.
[03:44:54.352 --> 03:44:55.874]  Look at the size of the hole.
[03:44:55.874 --> 03:44:57.595]  Look at the size of the engine.
[03:44:57.595 --> 03:45:00.076]  They kind of match a Predator drone.
[03:45:00.076 --> 03:45:01.337]  It is a possibility.
[03:45:01.337 --> 03:45:02.658]  It is a possibility, man.
[03:45:02.658 --> 03:45:05.740]  Listen, Scott, I've got to jump because I actually have Gary on the line.
[03:45:05.740 --> 03:45:06.481]  Thanks for the call.
[03:45:07.154 --> 03:45:07.875]  I'm sorry, Josh.
[03:45:07.875 --> 03:45:08.575]  I gotta jump on.
[03:45:08.575 --> 03:45:09.336]  I'm such an idiot.
[03:45:09.336 --> 03:45:12.378]  But we're gonna go to Gary because I've got to talk about this story.
[03:45:12.378 --> 03:45:13.519]  We might go into overdrive.
[03:45:13.519 --> 03:45:14.359]  I'm not quite sure.
[03:45:14.359 --> 03:45:15.840]  Gary, are you with me?
[03:45:15.840 --> 03:45:17.121]  Yes, I'm with you.
[03:45:17.121 --> 03:45:17.662]  All right, man.
[03:45:17.662 --> 03:45:22.225]  Well, you know, I've seen the video that you guys put out where you're talking to the Secret Service agent.
[03:45:22.225 --> 03:45:23.386]  You never raise your hands.
[03:45:23.386 --> 03:45:26.328]  You talk to him in a respectful manner.
[03:45:26.328 --> 03:45:28.950]  And we don't have video of the actual incident.
[03:45:29.440 --> 03:45:31.281]  But let's just clear it up right now.
[03:45:31.281 --> 03:45:34.022]  Did you hit a girl in a wheelchair?
[03:45:34.022 --> 03:45:35.083]  That is very funny.
[03:45:35.083 --> 03:45:37.084]  I couldn't believe that.
[03:45:37.084 --> 03:45:39.665]  I mean, I couldn't believe it is the post.
[03:45:39.665 --> 03:45:42.947]  You know, it's very strange.
[03:45:42.947 --> 03:45:49.851]  The person that he actually used, I believe it was his daughter, he used as a weapon and a shield at the same time.
[03:45:49.851 --> 03:45:52.312]  It was actually very shocking.
[03:45:52.312 --> 03:45:53.612]  The girl was crying.
[03:45:53.612 --> 03:45:58.415]  I was trying to walk away from the incident because it was getting pretty violent.
[03:45:59.680 --> 03:46:07.547]  As soon as I try to walk away, this gentleman just rams me in my kneecap and starts screaming assault.
[03:46:07.547 --> 03:46:08.488]  He hit my daughter.
[03:46:08.488 --> 03:46:12.571]  At the same time, I'm trying to keep my balance because I don't even know what's going on.
[03:46:12.571 --> 03:46:16.554]  I see a left and a right swinging at me.
[03:46:16.554 --> 03:46:20.638]  This 500-pound, six-foot-something guy trying to attack me.
[03:46:22.762 --> 03:46:25.343]  The next thing I know, you know, I'm being swung around.
[03:46:25.343 --> 03:46:27.864]  The police can't even handcuff me right, left, and right.
[03:46:27.864 --> 03:46:30.625]  Swinging me around, trying to get handcuffs on me.
[03:46:30.625 --> 03:46:33.946]  Actually, it kind of looked like they were trying to, like, abuse me.
[03:46:33.946 --> 03:46:34.907]  They were really angry.
[03:46:34.907 --> 03:46:37.808]  They heard that I hit somebody in a wheelchair.
[03:46:37.808 --> 03:46:39.288]  That's what the man was saying.
[03:46:39.288 --> 03:46:43.890]  That was actually the only way that he could have basically, you know,
[03:46:44.636 --> 03:46:45.517]  I don't think so.
[03:46:59.589 --> 03:47:03.813]  Yeah, because, you know, again, I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but you're not a very physically intimidating guy.
[03:47:03.813 --> 03:47:08.658]  I mean, you're a skinny, young guy who, again, you didn't scream any obscenities, did you?
[03:47:08.658 --> 03:47:11.781]  I mean, you were talking about 9-11 and the Bush crime scenario.
[03:47:11.781 --> 03:47:15.945]  Well, yeah, I was actually intellectually screaming out my statement.
[03:47:15.945 --> 03:47:17.106]  I mean, what did he want me to do?
[03:47:17.106 --> 03:47:20.710]  They were saying I was hackling, but I can't really whisper to somebody 20 feet away.
[03:47:21.677 --> 03:47:24.158]  They were keeping me away from us, literally.
[03:47:24.158 --> 03:47:25.738]  I don't see that as hackling.
[03:47:25.738 --> 03:47:30.800]  Yeah, well, they're saying that you used obscenities and I just want to clear that point up right now as well.
[03:47:30.800 --> 03:47:33.640]  You didn't scream any curse words, did you?
[03:47:33.640 --> 03:47:34.361]  Of course not.
[03:47:34.361 --> 03:47:35.421]  I mean, this is the post.
[03:47:35.421 --> 03:47:36.701]  They had an article about it.
[03:47:36.701 --> 03:47:40.222]  They put my picture up there a couple of months ago.
[03:47:40.222 --> 03:47:44.363]  They said that we had a sign that says, uh, do something because the government won't.
[03:47:44.363 --> 03:47:46.284]  But it never said that 50,000 sick and dying.
[03:47:46.284 --> 03:47:48.324]  That's what it says on the sign.
[03:47:48.324 --> 03:47:49.805]  I mean, if they're gonna...
[03:47:50.535 --> 03:47:57.125]  You know, take off the meaning of our sign and say we disrespect the victim's family when the sign is about the victim's family.
[03:47:57.125 --> 03:47:59.789]  Then, you know, you could expect anything from these morons.
[03:48:00.626 --> 03:48:01.226]  Absolutely.
[03:48:01.226 --> 03:48:13.334]  It's very scary, and I honestly believe that you should sue for libel for this, because this is going to be on Michelle Malkin's site, but it's going to be a talking point on her radio program, okay?
[03:48:13.334 --> 03:48:22.920]  And you can bet that later today on Fox News, you're going to see this on Hannity, you're going to see it on O'Reilly, you're going to see it in the mainstream media, you might even see it on MSNBC and CNN, folks.
[03:48:24.265 --> 03:48:26.787]  The supposed good media outlets.
[03:48:26.787 --> 03:48:31.370]  Listen, Fox is over the top, no doubt, but those other guys ain't your friends either, okay?
[03:48:31.370 --> 03:48:47.763]  They're just as culpable, they're just as guilty, and they're gonna propagate this story about a 9-11 truth activist who believes in non-violent peaceful protest, exercises his First Amendment, he gets assaulted, he gets charged, they won't even hear eyewitness testimony.
[03:48:47.763 --> 03:48:51.846]  I mean, I'm sure you just heard Diane on the phone, you know, she went down to the police station and waited for you.
[03:48:52.202 --> 03:48:55.365]  Two hours to give a statement and they wouldn't allow it.
[03:48:55.365 --> 03:49:03.852]  And this guy doesn't get handcuffed, he doesn't get printed, he gets his picture taken and he walks away, and he comes off like some kind of hero in this post article.
[03:49:03.852 --> 03:49:04.792]  I'm disgusted, man.
[03:49:04.792 --> 03:49:06.374]  I'm sick to my stomach.
[03:49:06.374 --> 03:49:13.780]  Well, that's just, you know, kind of the symbolism that all goes on, you know, the scum are always awarded, you know, heroes.
[03:49:13.780 --> 03:49:17.383]  And this is a fan of Dick Cheney and the Bush crime syndicate.
[03:49:18.072 --> 03:49:20.894]  And you could have, you know, there's nothing else you could expect from him.
[03:49:20.894 --> 03:49:28.658]  There's not one, again, you know, basically a character assassination, but he does have a sheeple-like mind.
[03:49:28.658 --> 03:49:33.361]  He's no more smarter than, I believe, a child.
[03:49:33.361 --> 03:49:35.542]  Yeah, now when did they finally release you?
[03:49:35.542 --> 03:49:38.824]  Because as I knew yesterday, you were still incarcerated?
[03:49:38.824 --> 03:49:42.246]  Yeah, yes, they released me yesterday around like 8 p.m.
[03:49:43.627 --> 03:49:52.194]  I was stuck central booking for like around 12 hours, educating the people there about the New World Order.
[03:49:52.194 --> 03:49:53.836]  And what are the charges, Gary?
[03:49:53.836 --> 03:49:55.477]  What did they formally charge you with?
[03:49:55.477 --> 03:50:00.742]  The charges basically is assault in a third degree.
[03:50:00.742 --> 03:50:06.206]  Assault on the person, on the man that they said had a split lip.
[03:50:06.206 --> 03:50:08.829]  I don't know how he had the split lip because
[03:50:09.867 --> 03:50:16.610]  Basically, I didn't even have time to even defend myself because police and security service was on me so fast.
[03:50:16.610 --> 03:50:17.511]  Alright, Gary.
[03:50:17.511 --> 03:50:18.431]  Gary, we're going to come back.
[03:50:18.431 --> 03:50:19.592]  We've got one more segment.
[03:50:19.592 --> 03:50:21.893]  I guess we're not going to have to do overdrive with you.
[03:50:21.893 --> 03:50:23.674]  We're going to do one more segment with you, buddy.
[03:50:23.674 --> 03:50:26.335]  I want to get the specifics down, Pat.
[03:50:26.335 --> 03:50:28.156]  I want to know what you think we should do.
[03:50:28.156 --> 03:50:29.797]  Should we redouble our efforts?
[03:50:29.797 --> 03:50:32.718]  WeAreChanger.org, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:50:32.718 --> 03:50:34.239]  We'll be back right after this.
[03:50:45.256 --> 03:50:46.677]  It is a big idea.
[03:50:46.677 --> 03:50:49.498]  A New World Order.
[03:50:49.498 --> 03:50:54.401]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[03:50:54.401 --> 03:50:57.223]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:50:57.223 --> 03:51:00.005]  Could their objective be world domination?
[03:51:00.005 --> 03:51:03.186]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:51:03.186 --> 03:51:10.511]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:51:13.547 --> 03:51:18.991]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[03:51:26.596 --> 03:51:27.376]  They're not after money.
[03:51:27.376 --> 03:51:28.637]  They have all the money they need.
[03:51:28.637 --> 03:51:29.258]  They're after power.
[03:51:29.258 --> 03:51:30.779]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:54:24.128 --> 03:54:28.891]  Two awesome pictures that need to get out there, that people need to watch and spread.
[03:54:29.249 --> 03:54:29.729]  Okay?
[03:54:29.729 --> 03:54:31.370]  That's how we win this information war.
[03:54:31.370 --> 03:54:32.891]  We spread this with other people.
[03:54:32.891 --> 03:54:36.654]  We have soldiers on the ground, like Gary.
[03:54:36.654 --> 03:54:38.455]  And, uh, you know, what happens to him?
[03:54:38.455 --> 03:54:40.697]  He goes and he speaks truth to power.
[03:54:40.697 --> 03:54:41.977]  He's charged with assault.
[03:54:41.977 --> 03:54:43.058]  He's beaten up.
[03:54:43.058 --> 03:54:48.302]  And not only charged with assault, but charged with assault on a crippled girl with cerebral palsy.
[03:54:48.302 --> 03:54:50.583]  It's a very sad state in this country.
[03:54:50.583 --> 03:54:56.267]  When the mainstream media will continue to propagate these lies and try to demonize this movement.
[03:54:56.267 --> 03:54:57.988]  This movement's trying to save America!
[03:54:58.897 --> 03:55:00.178]  It's trying to save the Republic!
[03:55:00.178 --> 03:55:02.260]  We want our Constitution back!
[03:55:02.260 --> 03:55:03.001]  Alright?
[03:55:03.001 --> 03:55:04.482]  I'm sick of it!
[03:55:04.482 --> 03:55:13.251]  So, Gary, you know, I want to take a couple callers at the very end here, but why don't you just, you know, give us the whole thing, really, in a nutshell, one more time.
[03:55:13.251 --> 03:55:18.256]  Yeah, well, I was the guy who exercised my freedom of speech, you know, to confront and
[03:55:18.755 --> 03:55:19.115]  We're good to go.
[03:55:36.939 --> 03:55:38.980]  He started off by putting his finger in my face.
[03:55:38.980 --> 03:55:40.181]  I knew he was trying to provoke me.
[03:55:40.181 --> 03:55:41.883]  He had a smile on his face.
[03:55:41.883 --> 03:55:46.646]  Now, I'm a little smarter than, you know, active in my emotions, so I tried to get a police officer.
[03:55:46.646 --> 03:55:50.890]  I tried to state that it was an assault, but nobody wanted to listen to me.
[03:55:50.890 --> 03:55:58.456]  As soon as I walked a little away from him, I feel something ramming me in my kneecap, trying to, you know, gain my balance.
[03:55:59.372 --> 03:56:04.076]  There he goes swinging at me left and right and he proceeds to try to choke me.
[03:56:04.076 --> 03:56:06.517]  I get him off of me, I mean try to get him off of me.
[03:56:06.517 --> 03:56:12.062]  I didn't even really comprehend the whole situation.
[03:56:14.358 --> 03:56:16.579]  It happened so fast.
[03:56:16.579 --> 03:56:22.700]  Before I know it, Secret Service, NYPD just started swinging me to the left wall, the right wall.
[03:56:22.700 --> 03:56:25.541]  You know, they slammed my face.
[03:56:25.541 --> 03:56:28.442]  Just like they slammed Matt LeBasic's face.
[03:56:28.442 --> 03:56:35.983]  They slammed mine against the wall and twisted my arm and put the handcuffs on it very tight.
[03:56:35.983 --> 03:56:38.404]  When this 500 pound man basically, you know,
[03:56:39.296 --> 03:56:43.939]  Uh, you know, just like always, not even, you know, questioned or nothing.
[03:56:43.939 --> 03:56:46.800]  I mean... Well, you really need to take legal action, man.
[03:56:46.800 --> 03:56:49.562]  You need to talk to a lawyer ASAP.
[03:56:49.562 --> 03:56:56.366]  If there's lawyers out there today and he doesn't get in touch, you need to get in touch with InfoWars and Alex Jones and we'll try to help you out.
[03:56:56.366 --> 03:56:58.807]  I'm sure Alex is going to want you on the program tomorrow.
[03:56:58.807 --> 03:57:02.949]  But, you know, this is going to be the talking point for tonight on the news stations.
[03:57:02.949 --> 03:57:05.010]  This is in the post and I guarantee that.
[03:57:05.010 --> 03:57:07.832]  Let's take the last couple callers in these last couple minutes.
[03:57:08.468 --> 03:57:09.869]  Scott in Colorado, are you still there?
[03:57:09.869 --> 03:57:12.070]  Yeah, I'm here.
[03:57:12.070 --> 03:57:13.131]  How are you doing, Jason?
[03:57:13.131 --> 03:57:13.511]  Good, man.
[03:57:13.511 --> 03:57:14.592]  How are you doing?
[03:57:14.592 --> 03:57:15.912]  You're doing a great job.
[03:57:15.912 --> 03:57:19.254]  I really appreciate everything you and Alex are doing.
[03:57:19.254 --> 03:57:21.936]  Gary, I'm very sorry what's happened to you.
[03:57:21.936 --> 03:57:23.637]  I know exactly how that happened.
[03:57:23.637 --> 03:57:24.357]  It happened to me.
[03:57:24.357 --> 03:57:36.464]  I hope you've got more than the one witness to the event that have given a statement because they'll bring them up against you.
[03:57:36.464 --> 03:57:37.525]  Do you have more than one person?
[03:57:38.303 --> 03:57:48.025]  Well, so far I have around two and I'm trying to talk to a lawyer so he can subpoena the closed-circuit television cameras if they want anything regarding the event.
[03:57:48.025 --> 03:57:49.146]  That's basically all I had.
[03:57:49.146 --> 03:57:57.868]  I was relying upon bands, my first witness's video tape recording that I thought she had, but she unfortunately didn't.
[03:57:57.868 --> 03:57:58.808]  Alright, folks.
[03:57:58.808 --> 03:57:59.388]  Alright, hey.
[03:57:59.388 --> 03:58:01.589]  You know, Gary, we're going to do everything we can to help you out.
[03:58:01.589 --> 03:58:02.689]  I thank you for the call, Scott.
[03:58:03.389 --> 03:58:07.851]  And, uh, retransmission begins in only two minutes over at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:07.851 --> 03:58:16.034]  We're gonna loop this program and tomorrow we're gonna have even more information on the mainstream media lying Bush Basher smashes disabled teen.
[03:58:16.034 --> 03:58:27.099]  It's disgusting!

[03:58:38.394 --> 03:58:45.302]  If the American people truly hope to make a change in Washington, then we must act now with a cohesive plan for taking back our government.
[03:58:45.302 --> 03:58:49.686]  Washington You're Fired is a new patriotic documentary from the director of Beyond Treason.
[03:58:49.686 --> 03:58:54.251]  The video is the result of a two-year endeavor to assemble a video tool for engaging
[03:58:54.591 --> 03:58:59.075]  Educating and motivating the American people to climb back into the driver's seat of Congress.
[03:58:59.075 --> 03:59:07.122]  Washington You're Fired lays out the last seven years of fundamentally flawed terror-related spy bills in a linear fashion that no one has ever constructed before.
[03:59:07.122 --> 03:59:11.906]  The resulting shift in our governmental power structure leaves the American people with only two choices.
[03:59:11.906 --> 03:59:14.828]  Be a part of the problem or be a part of the solution.
[03:59:14.828 --> 03:59:22.095]  Washington You're Fired is being described as the best patriotic video since Freedom to Fascism and we want you to get a copy and share it with your friends.
