[00:00.000 --> 00:14.480]  This world can't disagree, they don't understand how it can be.
[00:14.480 --> 00:22.080]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, and it's not my part of
[00:22.080 --> 00:27.240]  you, it's a fact, and you know that it's true.
[00:27.240 --> 00:30.040]  The horses couldn't drag me away from this broadcast.
[00:30.040 --> 00:34.160]  Record audience is tuned in right now at infohorses.com.
[00:34.160 --> 00:42.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are, Tuesday, already the 16th day of May 2017, and the
[00:42.680 --> 00:48.520]  deep state is now out in the open, and it has emerged like the Kraken out of the Aegean
[00:48.520 --> 00:54.200]  Sea, and is trying to destroy Donald Trump and the American people's desperate attempt
[00:54.200 --> 00:57.240]  to get control of our government back from the globalist.
[00:57.240 --> 01:01.080]  Doesn't mean Trump's perfect, doesn't mean Trump has all the answers, doesn't mean he's
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.300]  not fallible like everybody else, but he is a real American president who really is trying
[01:06.300 --> 01:10.520]  to turn our economy around and bring back our pride, and the enemy is trying to destroy
[01:10.520 --> 01:12.480]  him like I've never seen.
[01:12.480 --> 01:17.920]  It is so cartoonish, it is so naked, it is so ridiculous at this point, I don't even
[01:17.920 --> 01:20.040]  know what to say.
[01:20.040 --> 01:24.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, Roger Stone's gonna be in studio with us coming up here from the
[01:24.440 --> 01:28.480]  next hour, we have several other informative guests today, but let me just break this down.
[01:28.480 --> 01:37.680]  It is incontrovertible fact that President Trump released nothing classified in his meeting
[01:37.680 --> 01:45.720]  with the Russian foreign minister and the Russian head ambassador.
[01:45.720 --> 01:49.840]  Last night it was about five o'clock and I was at home with my family and I was getting
[01:49.840 --> 01:53.720]  ready to go out to eat a business meeting with Roger Stone and some of the crew and
[01:53.720 --> 02:02.040]  my parents went along, and I pull up the story where Trump has supposedly given classified
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.320]  information to the Russians in this meeting.
[02:06.320 --> 02:09.440]  First they said he let them plant bugs in there and didn't let reporters in, it was
[02:09.440 --> 02:15.200]  all these lies, and now they were saying this, and then I go and McMaster runs out and says
[02:15.200 --> 02:20.040]  none of this is true, it's made up, I was there, and the first thing hit me, McMaster
[02:20.040 --> 02:25.960]  is one of the known big leakers, deep state operatives, I said he knows his necks on the
[02:25.960 --> 02:31.280]  chopping block reportedly in the next week or so, he's doing this to be the savior, he's
[02:31.280 --> 02:35.800]  the leaker working with the Washington Post, I call a lot of really smart people and Roger
[02:35.800 --> 02:39.600]  called some folks, I'll just leave it at that, and that's exactly what they said before,
[02:39.600 --> 02:44.520]  we even said, do you think it's McMaster, everybody, well we know it came out of the
[02:44.520 --> 02:49.240]  national security agency, and that's what he sets the top of as the national security
[02:49.240 --> 02:53.120]  advisor to the president, they've got the big office of the head of national intelligence
[02:53.120 --> 02:55.760]  that the interface is with.
[02:55.760 --> 03:01.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is incredible, and what was even more incredible is I was driving
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.160]  to eat dinner at like 545, I was listening to local news, national news and local radio,
[03:06.160 --> 03:10.920]  and it hit me so hard it gave me a headache, because they started getting into what the
[03:10.920 --> 03:17.040]  classified info was about ISIS and Al Qaeda, and it was they were planning to load laptops
[03:17.040 --> 03:23.200]  with bombs, and it hit me not like in joy that I can disprove what liars they are, but
[03:23.200 --> 03:28.440]  that they're that sick and think we're that stupid, the level of lying by the Washington
[03:28.440 --> 03:36.840]  Post that reportedly cheered as they saw record traffic coming into their website, I have
[03:36.840 --> 03:45.360]  over 100 articles, you can Google ISIS bomb makers plan to put bombs in laptops, you'll
[03:45.360 --> 03:53.680]  get AP Reuters, New York Times, Washington Post, The Express, the BBC, literally over
[03:53.680 --> 04:00.760]  100 articles from April and March saying exactly what the president talked about saying, you
[04:00.760 --> 04:04.360]  know, we're really concerned about them blowing up airplanes with this, what do you think?
[04:04.360 --> 04:09.920]  That's what the president's supposed to talk to foreign leaders about, and these traitors,
[04:09.920 --> 04:18.800]  these scumbags turned that in to treason by our president.
[04:18.800 --> 04:22.840]  Now here's the rest of the story of this Machiavellian tale, and it's one in FullWars.com, guess what
[04:22.840 --> 04:28.400]  broke 30 minutes before they put out this piece of BS that they had been floating around
[04:28.400 --> 04:35.400]  for the last couple days, that Seth Rich's PI got in the laptop and clearly he was killed
[04:35.400 --> 04:37.080]  because he was interfacing with WikiLeaks.
[04:37.080 --> 04:42.000]  WikiLeaks is as much as said, we don't give out our sources, but Seth Rich, that was probably
[04:42.000 --> 04:46.480]  our source, WikiLeaks he's just released it all right now, or Nassange, you're a dead
[04:46.480 --> 04:50.120]  man, the Globals are going to kill you, all the planets are aligning now, they're making
[04:50.120 --> 04:56.200]  their move on Trump soon, you can see it, but more importantly, I can feel it.
[04:56.200 --> 05:00.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, hold fast.
[05:00.280 --> 05:04.080]  Over the weekend, President Donald Trump has called on God to bless and empower our country
[05:04.080 --> 05:06.000]  and our people, and reaffirmed our faith.
[05:06.000 --> 05:11.400]  In America, we don't worship government, we worship God, and it's why we proudly proclaim
[05:11.400 --> 05:17.200]  that we are one nation under God, every time we say the Pledge of Allegiance.
[05:17.200 --> 05:19.040]  Which God exactly has he invoked?
[05:19.040 --> 05:20.960]  Was it the God of Hillary Clinton?
[05:20.960 --> 05:23.200]  Rich people, God bless us.
[05:23.200 --> 05:25.440]  Or was it the God of Barack Hussein Obama?
[05:25.440 --> 05:28.160]  God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.
[05:28.160 --> 05:32.840]  No, President Trump has called on the one true God of the universe, whose name is above
[05:32.840 --> 05:33.840]  every name.
[05:33.840 --> 05:35.080]  Champions for Christ.
[05:35.080 --> 05:39.080]  He testified to the greatest pieces of literature in the history of mankind, because of the
[05:39.080 --> 05:41.960]  power contained within the words of this book.
[05:41.960 --> 05:47.120]  You are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope, and love.
[05:47.120 --> 05:50.960]  Even the most remote areas of India, and especially Africa, have heard of him.
[05:50.960 --> 05:56.040]  Jesus Christ has been preached in and is believed on in all nations of the world.
[05:56.040 --> 05:58.360]  Our God is not like their God.
[05:58.360 --> 05:59.880]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[05:59.880 --> 06:03.640]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[06:03.640 --> 06:05.480]  in stock at InfoWars.com.
[06:05.480 --> 06:08.280]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[06:08.280 --> 06:10.360]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[06:10.360 --> 06:14.560]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[06:14.560 --> 06:15.560]  Super Blue.
[06:15.560 --> 06:17.440]  Research across the board is clear.
[06:17.440 --> 06:18.800]  In fact, it's certified.
[06:18.800 --> 06:22.680]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[06:22.680 --> 06:23.680]  clots and heart attacks.
[06:23.680 --> 06:28.400]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[06:28.400 --> 06:30.960]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[06:30.960 --> 06:33.480]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[06:33.480 --> 06:37.640]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[06:37.640 --> 06:42.280]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used its biblical times to help wipe out bad
[06:42.280 --> 06:44.440]  bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[06:44.440 --> 06:48.760]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts, include xylitol,
[06:48.760 --> 06:51.960]  peppermint oil, iodide, nanosilver, and more.
[06:51.960 --> 06:57.040]  Learn more about InfoWarsLife Super Blue toothpaste at InfoWarsLife.com and support
[06:57.040 --> 07:01.040]  the InfoWars while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[07:01.040 --> 07:04.920]  The recent InfoWarsLife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites because I want
[07:04.920 --> 07:06.360]  products I'm going to use for my family.
[07:06.360 --> 07:07.360]  I take this.
[07:07.360 --> 07:08.360]  My family takes this.
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.040]  And then it funds the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going
[07:12.040 --> 07:13.040]  to find anywhere.
[07:13.040 --> 07:17.360]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at InfoWarsLife.com.
[07:17.360 --> 07:21.920]  If I ever forget to take them, like, I'm having noticeable difference.
[07:21.920 --> 07:23.160]  I don't feel good.
[07:23.160 --> 07:26.760]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[07:26.760 --> 07:29.520]  Yeah, I've actually just run out of my Super Female.
[07:29.520 --> 07:35.600]  I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym once again.
[07:35.600 --> 07:38.360]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[07:38.360 --> 07:44.040]  And I know my hair is a little luxurious once again, so obviously the Super Female is amazing.
[07:44.040 --> 07:45.040]  I love it.
[07:45.040 --> 07:47.720]  The nascent iodine is essential.
[07:47.720 --> 07:48.720]  Survival Shield X2.
[07:48.720 --> 07:52.120]  If there's one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[07:52.120 --> 07:56.320]  iodine Survival Shield X2, it's got a five-star rating.
[07:56.320 --> 08:17.160]  So win-win, InfoWarsLife.com.
[08:17.160 --> 08:21.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[08:21.600 --> 08:36.560]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[08:36.560 --> 08:41.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, here we are on the 16th day of May 2017 on this Tuesday Global Transmission.
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.520]  We're going to be live here from the InfoWars News Centers for the next four hours riding
[08:46.520 --> 08:47.520]  shotgun with me.
[08:47.520 --> 08:53.160]  For part of the transmission is Roger Stone, formerly head of the Trump campaign that obviously
[08:53.160 --> 08:55.280]  brought him to victory.
[08:55.280 --> 08:57.600]  The Deep State is lashing out big time.
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.920]  Seth Rich, Murder Developments, the guy that got shot four times in the back a day after
[09:02.920 --> 09:06.640]  WikiLeaks got information they said from a DNC insider.
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.920]  Well, we have also seen folks come out like Julina Sange and say, we don't ever go about
[09:11.920 --> 09:15.320]  sources, but Seth Rich was basically our source.
[09:15.320 --> 09:17.720]  Well, absolutely, he's been killed.
[09:17.720 --> 09:21.120]  Obviously, you never get about sources to protect him, but he's been killed now.
[09:21.120 --> 09:25.200]  You've got to completely release that information and what else you have with WikiLeaks because
[09:25.200 --> 09:26.880]  the planets are now aligning.
[09:26.880 --> 09:33.880]  Notice, within 30 minutes of this breaking on Fox Television, there in DC, getting around
[09:33.880 --> 09:38.840]  the controlled corporate media, the whole Washington Post story comes out that Trump
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.120]  didn't just let him plant listening devices in the Oval Office, the Russians, he didn't
[09:43.120 --> 09:45.840]  just keep out the media and only let the Russians in, none of that was true.
[09:45.840 --> 09:49.160]  He had their pull reporter, our pull reporter, America's.
[09:49.160 --> 09:55.280]  No, no, no, he gave them classified info on Al Qaeda and ISIS and on an ally in the Middle
[09:55.280 --> 09:57.760]  East that gave us intel.
[09:57.760 --> 10:00.080]  And then we learn what he talked about.
[10:00.080 --> 10:06.600]  He talked about laptop bombs that ISIS has been putting out in public releases and in
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.840]  recruitment videos and in bomb making training that they've been preparing.
[10:10.840 --> 10:15.400]  This has been in the news April and again in March and again this year, it's been in
[10:15.400 --> 10:17.800]  the Washington Post, it's been in the New York Times.
[10:17.800 --> 10:24.520]  I have screenshots of all of it that we're going to be putting on screen for everyone.
[10:24.520 --> 10:25.520]  So here it is.
[10:25.520 --> 10:31.480]  Trump revealed highly classified information to Russia Foreign Minister and Ambassador.
[10:31.480 --> 10:34.520]  And then you've got them all attacking him in the Washington Post, the New York Times,
[10:34.520 --> 10:36.440]  but here they are in the New York Times.
[10:36.440 --> 10:42.240]  And here they are with Max Boot and all of the publications coming out, Adam Goldman,
[10:42.240 --> 10:46.920]  you name it, New York Times, on March 22nd, intelligence shows Islamic State is developing
[10:46.920 --> 10:51.680]  a bomb hidden in portable electronic devices.
[10:51.680 --> 10:52.680]  Here it is.
[10:52.680 --> 10:55.880]  U.S. raid in Yemen led to laptop ban on flights.
[10:55.880 --> 10:59.080]  That was on the news in April and in March.
[10:59.080 --> 11:01.960]  All Trump discussed was something that is in the news.
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.040]  Just like Trump saying, did you see the yellow sun, Lavaroff, up in the sky today?
[11:07.040 --> 11:08.680]  Did you see that big old yellow sun?
[11:08.680 --> 11:11.480]  And they go, yes, Mr. President, we saw the yellow sun.
[11:11.480 --> 11:15.000]  And the news goes, my God, he just gave away the intelligence.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.960]  This man is a traitor.
[11:16.960 --> 11:21.160]  So this is the incredible level of lies.
[11:21.160 --> 11:25.000]  Bonafide completely fake saying the sun is in the sky, but meanwhile, 30 minutes after
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.120]  it comes out, Seth Rich, the private eye that was originally hired by the family that went
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.660]  in and got into the laptop saying, yes, he was in contact with WikiLeaks.
[11:34.660 --> 11:37.520]  The family said they thought he was killed and fell, played by Democrats.
[11:37.520 --> 11:41.840]  But now they've reversed that, at least Fox News is claiming, and says, oh, the family
[11:41.840 --> 11:44.480]  saying it isn't true what the P.I. says.
[11:44.480 --> 11:45.980]  So this is amazing.
[11:45.980 --> 11:46.980]  There's the original story.
[11:46.980 --> 11:50.640]  Fox five upon infowars.com, by the way, they're starting to take these articles down.
[11:50.640 --> 11:53.320]  Everybody should screenshot this family's private investigator.
[11:53.320 --> 11:58.200]  There is evidence Seth Rich had contact with WikiLeaks prior to the death.
[11:58.200 --> 12:02.400]  We have Assange as saying as much, even though he doesn't want to break this code of never
[12:02.400 --> 12:04.040]  giving up sources.
[12:04.040 --> 12:07.440]  That's kind of letter of the law when someone's been killed and the globalists know they're
[12:07.440 --> 12:10.880]  the source and they're a hero and they're not a Russian.
[12:10.880 --> 12:11.880]  This is very clear.
[12:11.880 --> 12:17.800]  Julian Assange offered a $25,000 reward for anyone who had information regarding the murder
[12:17.800 --> 12:19.280]  of Seth Rich.
[12:19.280 --> 12:24.520]  What clearer indication could you have had that Rich was his source?
[12:24.520 --> 12:28.800]  Rich was not a low level grunt at the DNC.
[12:28.800 --> 12:32.160]  He was the head of the IT division.
[12:32.160 --> 12:40.600]  So this is a classic example of them creating fake news in an attempt to blunt this devastating
[12:40.600 --> 12:41.600]  news.
[12:41.600 --> 12:46.640]  What the president should do immediately is order the FBI take over the investigation
[12:46.640 --> 12:50.320]  into the Rich murder from the DC Metropolitan Police.
[12:50.320 --> 12:54.720]  Both of them are technically under the control of the president of the United States.
[12:54.720 --> 12:55.720]  Let's go further.
[12:55.720 --> 13:00.080]  We have this PI that was hired by the family saying, I talked to senior police officers
[13:00.080 --> 13:05.500]  that said, quote, we were ordered to stand down on this murder investigation.
[13:05.500 --> 13:10.560]  This is a respected PI with contacts in the police department, former law enforcement.
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.040]  This is bombshell intel.
[13:14.040 --> 13:15.040]  Bombshell intel.
[13:15.040 --> 13:20.120]  And Alex, I would point out that Mark Rich's parents, pardon me, Seth Rich's parents
[13:20.120 --> 13:22.200]  have changed their story.
[13:22.200 --> 13:26.120]  They initially said that they did not believe this was a robbery.
[13:26.120 --> 13:31.360]  In fact, Mr. Rich's father was quoted as saying that his ring and his wallet and his
[13:31.360 --> 13:34.120]  jewelry and his cash was intact.
[13:34.120 --> 13:39.520]  But now they seem to be, you know, with a completely different story trying to discredit
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.800]  the work of this private detective.
[13:41.800 --> 13:47.000]  There is, of course, one other person who could absolutely prove that Mark Rich was
[13:47.000 --> 13:52.320]  a source and he has no source to protect because you, as you point out, Mr. Rich is dead.
[13:52.320 --> 13:54.120]  And that is Julian Assange.
[13:54.120 --> 13:56.000]  Perhaps he will be heard from.
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  Absolutely.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.920]  We're going to walk all through this and recap this, but this is simply amazing.
[14:00.920 --> 14:09.880]  And speaking of that clip, here is the original report from Fox there in DC, the full report,
[14:09.880 --> 14:15.520]  the full report is up on info wars.com and the full transcript and article by Paul Watson,
[14:15.520 --> 14:21.200]  where he talks about the fact that he talked to the senior police and they told him we
[14:21.200 --> 14:23.560]  were ordered to quote stand down.
[14:23.560 --> 14:24.560]  Here is that report.
[14:24.560 --> 14:28.560]  We are just two months shy of the one year anniversary of Seth Rich's murder.
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.520]  And ever since we learned Rich was a DNC staffer, the conspiracy theories online have taken
[14:33.520 --> 14:34.640]  a life of their own.
[14:34.640 --> 14:39.720]  But today Fox five has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists
[14:39.720 --> 14:41.520]  are in fact right.
[14:41.520 --> 14:45.680]  New information from the family's private investigator suggests there is tangible evidence
[14:45.680 --> 14:52.560]  on Seth Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his
[14:52.560 --> 14:53.560]  death.
[14:53.560 --> 14:57.400]  Now the question is, why has DC police as the lead agency on the investigation for the
[14:57.400 --> 15:03.960]  past 10 months insisted this was a botched robbery when till this day there is no evidence
[15:03.960 --> 15:08.880]  to suggest that the rich family hired Rod Wheeler, a former MPD homicide detective to
[15:08.880 --> 15:12.200]  run a parallel investigation into their son's death.
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.200]  Wheeler says he believes there is a cover up and the police department has been told
[15:17.200 --> 15:21.800]  to back down from the investigation.
[15:21.800 --> 15:25.600]  The police department nor the FBI has been forthcoming.
[15:25.600 --> 15:27.680]  They haven't been cooperating at all.
[15:27.680 --> 15:35.240]  I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either
[15:35.240 --> 15:40.280]  at the police department or either at the FBI, I've been told both, but you have sources
[15:40.280 --> 15:48.560]  at the FBI saying that there is information for sure link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks.
[15:48.560 --> 15:53.480]  I want that private detective on actually have a source inside the police department
[15:53.480 --> 15:57.680]  that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, Rod, we were told to stand down
[15:57.680 --> 16:00.640]  in this case and I can't share any information with you.
[16:00.640 --> 16:05.200]  Now that's highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department.
[16:05.200 --> 16:10.800]  Again, I don't think it comes from the chief's office, but I do believe there is a correlation
[16:10.800 --> 16:15.160]  between the mayor's office and the DNC and that's the information that's going to come
[16:15.160 --> 16:16.160]  out tomorrow.
[16:16.160 --> 16:17.160]  Wow.
[16:17.160 --> 16:18.360]  And that's coming out today.
[16:18.360 --> 16:27.520]  So now they've got the top DNC spin master, who is a crisis expert who quote handles crises
[16:27.520 --> 16:30.160]  who is out spinning this whole deal.
[16:30.160 --> 16:31.160]  This is amazing.
[16:31.160 --> 16:36.520]  And again, it turned out Seth Rich was in key IT areas dealing with databases, dealing
[16:36.520 --> 16:38.960]  with DNC communications.
[16:38.960 --> 16:43.840]  And so here we have probably the prime hero, the leaker, an American patriot giving the
[16:43.840 --> 16:48.520]  information to WikiLeaks helping us get a view into CNN and the rest of the media colluding
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.800]  with the Democrats, all this incredible corruption.
[16:50.800 --> 16:52.840]  He gets shot multiple times in the back.
[16:52.840 --> 16:53.840]  Nothing gets taken.
[16:53.840 --> 17:00.820]  The family hires a reputable PI, former police officer who interfaces a parallel investigation
[17:00.820 --> 17:03.960]  discovers all the stuff's going on is told by the police.
[17:03.960 --> 17:06.160]  We've been told to stand down.
[17:06.160 --> 17:07.840]  This is unbelievable.
[17:07.840 --> 17:09.720]  And this happens.
[17:09.720 --> 17:14.640]  This starts coming out 30 minutes before on the news there in DC.
[17:14.640 --> 17:20.160]  And so boom, the Washington Post runs with this giant hoax that Trump told them about
[17:20.160 --> 17:22.320]  laptop bombs.
[17:22.320 --> 17:26.720]  When that had been in the news in April and March in over a hundred major publications.
[17:26.720 --> 17:32.480]  I mean, the brazenness, the Washington Post knowing they'd get caught, then McMaster runs
[17:32.480 --> 17:37.080]  out will play that coming up and gives a short press conference saying he was there.
[17:37.080 --> 17:38.480]  Nothing classified was talked about.
[17:38.480 --> 17:44.200]  I'm telling you, I smell Machiavelli and plot to pull McMaster out of the fire to pull his
[17:44.200 --> 17:45.200]  bacon out of the fire.
[17:45.200 --> 17:46.200]  Roger Stone.
[17:46.200 --> 17:53.160]  Alex, I now believe that the actual leak came from an Obama holdover at the NSA.
[17:53.160 --> 17:59.160]  I am going to presume that that was done with McMaster's knowledge, probably at his direction.
[17:59.160 --> 18:02.760]  He was the man with the greatest single motive here.
[18:02.760 --> 18:07.040]  On the other hand, technically, the president of the United States does have the authority
[18:07.040 --> 18:09.080]  to declassify information.
[18:09.080 --> 18:15.640]  And in this case, this was not exactly a secret having been reported in all of the newspapers.
[18:15.640 --> 18:22.440]  So this is a classic example of manufactured fake news put out there in a timely fashion
[18:22.440 --> 18:27.080]  to blunt the impact of the Seth Rich breaking story.
[18:27.080 --> 18:32.440]  Typical Washington Post, which has long been almost a house organ for the central intelligence.
[18:32.440 --> 18:33.440]  That's right.
[18:33.440 --> 18:35.800]  Hide one story that's real with a fake story.
[18:35.800 --> 18:38.920]  But how brazen are they when this is totally fake?
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.440]  The rest of mainstream media is still running with its real when it's patently total baloney.
[18:44.440 --> 18:47.920]  You know, last night I was told the editors at the New York Times were trying to deal
[18:47.920 --> 18:51.400]  with, you know, they don't rely on the reporting of other newspapers.
[18:51.400 --> 18:54.720]  They have to rely on their own reporting.
[18:54.720 --> 19:00.640]  This is this is so obviously a manipulated news story for which, unfortunately, the Washington
[19:00.640 --> 19:03.120]  Post will pay no price.
[19:03.120 --> 19:04.280]  So that's the thing.
[19:04.280 --> 19:05.880]  They're already complete liars.
[19:05.880 --> 19:08.520]  And here's a few articles for TV viewers and radio listeners.
[19:08.520 --> 19:10.120]  The Express.
[19:10.120 --> 19:17.160]  This is in April, ISIS bomb makers created laptop bombs to full airport security checks.
[19:17.160 --> 19:18.400]  Boom.
[19:18.400 --> 19:20.120]  Here's another one.
[19:20.120 --> 19:22.840]  Readers can make laptop bombs that evade airport security.
[19:22.840 --> 19:27.160]  How they learned about it from the intelligence of the raids that Trump ordered.
[19:27.160 --> 19:28.160]  That was in the news.
[19:28.160 --> 19:29.160]  He's the president.
[19:29.160 --> 19:30.360]  They decided to release that info.
[19:30.360 --> 19:32.360]  The airports know he's the president.
[19:32.360 --> 19:33.360]  Exactly.
[19:33.360 --> 19:35.320]  He has he has power outside the other two brands.
[19:35.320 --> 19:36.320]  He can do what he wants.
[19:36.320 --> 19:40.800]  There's this idea to paralyze him, Roger, that he can't ever visit with the Russians.
[19:40.800 --> 19:44.960]  He can't ever meet with anybody because every time he does, they claim he's behind the scene
[19:44.960 --> 19:47.080]  selling us out when he's doing the opposite.
[19:47.080 --> 19:51.120]  Now, in fact, the focus here is exactly the opposite of what it should be.
[19:51.120 --> 19:54.840]  The president should order the FBI to find the leakers.
[19:54.840 --> 19:55.840]  That's the crime.
[19:55.840 --> 19:56.840]  That's the only crime.
[19:56.840 --> 19:57.840]  Absolutely.
[19:57.840 --> 19:59.400]  Well, how dare Trump say the sun was in the sky this morning?
[19:59.400 --> 20:00.400]  He's not allowed to say that.
[20:00.400 --> 20:01.400]  That's class fun.
[20:01.400 --> 20:02.400]  Well, it's ready to eat bacon.
[20:02.400 --> 20:06.720]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.

[24:20.480 --> 24:23.280]  All right, here is McMaster scurrying out yesterday.
[24:23.280 --> 24:27.360]  We don't want to make him a villain, it's just more and more compounds that does whatever
[24:27.360 --> 24:28.360]  he wants.
[24:28.360 --> 24:29.360]  Trump's very unhappy with him.
[24:29.360 --> 24:30.360]  He scurries out.
[24:30.360 --> 24:31.360]  This is ridiculous.
[24:31.360 --> 24:32.360]  I was there, there was no classified intel.
[24:32.360 --> 24:37.640]  And of course the NSA knows, I'm talking about laptop bombs, was released by him on purpose
[24:37.640 --> 24:43.520]  two months ago to show the intel that we got on the raid that killed the Navy SEAL.
[24:43.520 --> 24:47.840]  And so everybody knows, look out for laptops, look out if they're not operating, right?
[24:47.840 --> 24:49.240]  They could have a bomb in it.
[24:49.240 --> 24:50.240]  That's all over the news.
[24:50.240 --> 24:54.400]  It's like saying, ladies and gentlemen, Trump to the Russians leaked intel, we're really
[24:54.400 --> 24:55.400]  upset right now.
[24:55.400 --> 24:56.400]  Yeah.
[24:56.400 --> 25:00.800]  He leaked that in the 2016 Super Bowl champions were the New England Patriots.
[25:00.800 --> 25:06.280]  Can you believe that in 2017, he leaked the Super Bowl champions 2016?
[25:06.280 --> 25:07.960]  It's so obviously manufactured.
[25:07.960 --> 25:11.280]  But what if he leaked that they won the Super Bowl four months ago?
[25:11.280 --> 25:12.600]  This is treason, bro.
[25:12.600 --> 25:19.720]  Yeah, it's like an Alice in Wonderland world there in Washington, where the newspaper
[25:19.720 --> 25:25.080]  of record in the nation's capital is really just talking points against Donald Trump.
[25:25.080 --> 25:26.080]  You say it all the time.
[25:26.080 --> 25:28.360]  The Washington Post is worse than the onion.
[25:28.360 --> 25:29.600]  It really is.
[25:29.600 --> 25:32.240]  And it is less credible than the onion.
[25:32.240 --> 25:37.280]  I'm going to plug here, but when we come back, we're going to get to all of the breakdown.
[25:37.280 --> 25:40.360]  Your prediction, what happened last night, we got confronted.
[25:40.360 --> 25:43.560]  So much more coming up today with Roger Stone, we're coming up the next year to drop.
[25:43.560 --> 25:45.680]  They're clearly going after trying to destroy Trump.
[25:45.680 --> 25:46.680]  Why?
[25:46.680 --> 25:47.680]  What do we do to stop it?
[25:47.680 --> 25:51.960]  The first, as I mentioned it, here is the National Security Advisor to the president
[25:51.960 --> 25:52.960]  McMaster.
[25:52.960 --> 25:53.960]  Hey, good evening, everybody.
[25:53.960 --> 25:59.160]  I just have a brief statement for the record.
[25:59.160 --> 26:02.680]  There's nothing that the president takes more seriously than the security of the American
[26:02.680 --> 26:03.680]  people.
[26:03.680 --> 26:07.520]  The story that came out tonight as reported is false.
[26:07.520 --> 26:12.720]  The president and the foreign minister reviewed a range of common threats to our two countries,
[26:12.720 --> 26:15.760]  including threats to civil aviation.
[26:15.760 --> 26:23.680]  At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed, and the president did not disclose
[26:23.680 --> 26:28.000]  any military operations that were not already publicly known.
[26:28.000 --> 26:32.520]  Two other senior officials who were present, including the secretary of state, remember
[26:32.520 --> 26:35.120]  the meeting the same way and have said so.
[26:35.120 --> 26:38.560]  They're on the record, accounts should outweigh those of anonymous sources.
[26:38.560 --> 26:40.040]  And I was in the room.
[26:40.040 --> 26:41.040]  It didn't happen.
[26:41.040 --> 26:42.960]  Oh, he's the savior of the president.
[26:42.960 --> 26:44.120]  Thank God he's there.
[26:44.120 --> 26:48.880]  They all know they're putting out this story that's totally and completely idiotic and
[26:48.880 --> 26:49.880]  made up.
[26:49.880 --> 26:52.360]  But they already said the Russians were planting bugs in the room.
[26:52.360 --> 26:55.640]  There were no other photographers, because he was secretly in there, you know, performing
[26:55.640 --> 26:56.800]  fellatio on them.
[26:56.800 --> 27:01.320]  I mean, this is the biggest load of manure, but like you said, the Washington Post won't
[27:01.320 --> 27:02.320]  get in trouble now.
[27:02.320 --> 27:05.040]  Well, and it's got two purposes.
[27:05.040 --> 27:12.000]  One, it helps save McMaster's job, because he clearly has his head on the chopping block.
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.160]  So now it's very difficult for the president to get rid of him.
[27:15.160 --> 27:19.080]  But it also helps the national narrative that they're putting out there to discredit the
[27:19.080 --> 27:22.480]  president that he that he is, you know, that he's unstable.
[27:22.480 --> 27:28.760]  Yesterday, as you know, Alex, there was a video that alleges the president has Alzheimer's.
[27:28.760 --> 27:34.560]  I predict to you this is the next false narrative of the deep state and their allies in the
[27:34.560 --> 27:35.560]  mainstream.
[27:35.560 --> 27:38.160]  When he has super stamina and works 18 hours a day, I'm going to play that clip coming
[27:38.160 --> 27:40.160]  up actually a little bit later in the sour.
[27:40.160 --> 27:43.600]  All right, Roz, we're going to break it all down in the next segment, a bunch of clips,
[27:43.600 --> 27:46.280]  your predictions, where this is all going straight ahead.
[27:46.280 --> 27:51.880]  Before we go any further, we have been developing this product for several years with Dr. Group.
[27:51.880 --> 27:56.240]  It's called Z-Shield, because heavy metals, toxins in the environment are one of the biggest
[27:56.240 --> 27:58.520]  things facing ourselves, facing our health.
[27:58.520 --> 28:02.120]  And we have a lot of great products like X2 that helps pull garbage out of the body,
[28:02.120 --> 28:03.360]  obviously purifying your water.
[28:03.360 --> 28:04.840]  That's very, very important.
[28:04.840 --> 28:10.040]  We have the parasite cleanse, a lot of other products at infowarslife.com, but Z-Shield
[28:10.040 --> 28:15.960]  is rolling out today, toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[28:15.960 --> 28:21.840]  And it's extremely concentrated, extremely concentrated with a bunch of known ingredients
[28:21.840 --> 28:30.960]  like zeolites and chelogy, as well as organic lovage root, organic cleavers herb, tamarind
[28:30.960 --> 28:38.320]  fruit, organic orange peeled, organic cilantro, organic milk thistle, folvic and humic acid
[28:38.320 --> 28:43.200]  to help you upload it better, and again, zeolites concentrate.
[28:43.200 --> 28:48.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is something that I take a couple times a week.
[28:48.560 --> 28:49.560]  Some people take it more.
[28:49.560 --> 28:54.120]  It is just absolutely the common sense thing to do.
[28:54.120 --> 28:57.160]  It is the strongest product out there from our research.
[28:57.160 --> 29:00.000]  There are other similar products out there.
[29:00.000 --> 29:04.680]  There's a lot of other systems in the herbs and in the supplements that do do similar
[29:04.680 --> 29:05.680]  things.
[29:05.680 --> 29:07.800]  There's a lot of things medically out there you can look into, a lot of key ladders and
[29:07.800 --> 29:08.800]  things.
[29:08.800 --> 29:14.160]  This is a well-known field, but this is a supplement, still consult your physician before you use
[29:14.160 --> 29:15.160]  it.
[29:15.160 --> 29:18.800]  But these are well-known documented things that have been really associated with detoxifying
[29:18.800 --> 29:19.800]  the body.
[29:19.800 --> 29:24.600]  The new product is available exclusively at infowarslife.com, and your purchase also
[29:24.600 --> 29:28.080]  supports this broadcast that is in the eye of this forum, taken on the New World Order
[29:28.080 --> 29:30.120]  toe-to-toe and having a big effect.
[29:30.120 --> 29:32.480]  We're hitting major damages on the globalist.
[29:32.480 --> 29:36.000]  We're causing them a lot of trouble, but we're taking enemy fire as well.
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.680]  So be sure and check out our newest product at infowarslife.com.
[29:38.680 --> 29:46.400]  It's Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support at infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-139.
[29:46.400 --> 29:49.520]  We'll be back on the other side to stay with us.
[29:49.520 --> 29:50.800]  We're on the march.
[29:50.800 --> 29:53.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.280 --> 30:00.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.400 --> 30:04.720]  The One Belt, One Road International Forum in Beijing started on Sunday and right now
[30:04.720 --> 30:06.240]  is in its second day.
[30:06.240 --> 30:09.800]  Regarding the latest North Korean missile test launch that happened on Sunday, Putin
[30:09.800 --> 30:14.240]  said that it didn't pose a direct threat to Russia, but that missile tests are unacceptable
[30:14.240 --> 30:18.120]  and that these problems need to be solved peacefully, and not through intimidating North
[30:18.120 --> 30:20.360]  Korea, but through returning to dialogue.
[30:20.360 --> 30:25.320]  Putin also commented on a so-called Wanna Cry, the ransomware virus attack that hit
[30:25.320 --> 30:27.240]  computers across the world last week.
[30:27.240 --> 30:32.000]  He said that malware created by intelligence services can backfire on its creators.
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.320]  He said that, quote, Microsoft's management has made it clear that the virus originated
[30:35.320 --> 30:37.800]  from U.S. intelligence services, end of quote.
[30:37.800 --> 30:42.400]  Putin said that last year Washington refused the Russia's proposal on cybersecurity threats
[30:42.400 --> 30:45.080]  with the aim of drafting a bilateral agreement.
[30:45.080 --> 30:49.600]  Now regarding the forum's main intent, Putin said that the plan is for the greater Eurasia
[30:49.600 --> 30:54.480]  not to just be an abstract geopolitical arrangement, but a truly civilization-wide project looking
[30:54.480 --> 30:58.480]  toward the future, which can be achieved through the spirit of cooperation.
[30:58.480 --> 30:59.480]  This has been Daria for Infowars.com.
[30:59.480 --> 31:04.480]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and
[31:04.480 --> 31:05.480]  nutraceuticals.

[31:57.440 --> 32:00.560]  Check it out for yourself today.
[32:00.560 --> 32:05.520]  Today we call it bone broth, and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[32:05.520 --> 32:08.880]  before it became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk.
[32:08.880 --> 32:14.080]  We are now introducing Caveman by InfowarsLive.com, the ultimate and true paleo nutrition with
[32:14.080 --> 32:20.280]  bone broth, turmeric root, shaga mushroom, and seven total primal superfoods in a single
[32:20.280 --> 32:21.760]  great tasting formula.
[32:21.760 --> 32:22.760]  Caveman.
[32:22.760 --> 32:26.600]  Those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our
[32:26.600 --> 32:30.600]  superior ancestors, and we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[32:30.600 --> 32:33.280]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal.
[32:33.280 --> 32:38.480]  You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking, but you used the bones for strength.
[32:38.480 --> 32:42.760]  From the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces
[32:42.760 --> 32:46.400]  the blood for the body, this is the engine of the life essence.
[32:46.400 --> 32:50.760]  I'm a long way from the Caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back
[32:50.760 --> 32:54.400]  to that essence that made us what we were, and this is a big part of it.
[32:54.400 --> 32:58.840]  I know you're going to want to check out Caveman, ultimate paleo formula for yourself, InfowarsLive.com
[32:58.840 --> 33:21.920]  today.
[33:21.920 --> 33:48.600]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[33:48.600 --> 34:13.880]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[34:18.600 --> 34:45.280]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[34:45.280 --> 35:11.320]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[35:11.320 --> 35:39.000]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[35:39.000 --> 36:08.680]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[36:09.520 --> 36:38.680]  Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
[36:38.680 --> 36:46.600]  And it turns out that's been all over the news for a very, very, very long time.
[36:46.600 --> 36:48.120]  So think about that.
[36:48.120 --> 36:53.880]  It's been on the news since April and March of this year, but they come out and say Trump
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.800]  revealed highly classified information to Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador.
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.920]  And then the media is now debating whether it's real or not when there's no debating
[37:02.920 --> 37:09.120]  that Trump talked to them about, hey, do you see the intel we got about the laptop bombs?
[37:09.120 --> 37:11.080]  That helps Russia as well, doesn't it?
[37:11.080 --> 37:12.600]  Because Trump was proud of it back at the time.
[37:12.600 --> 37:16.320]  You want people to know about the new threats or something to be done about it.
[37:16.320 --> 37:20.000]  The president could declassify whatever he wants, but it was declassified back after
[37:20.000 --> 37:24.600]  it happened, talking about the Navy SEAL losing his life to get the valuable intel.
[37:24.600 --> 37:31.040]  This is incredible that they would lie so obviously, so ridiculously, there's NBC News,
[37:31.040 --> 37:32.040]  I guess they're traders too.
[37:32.040 --> 37:36.400]  ISIS could plant bombs in planes, driving new rules, officials.
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.640]  And that again, ladies and gentlemen, the date on that is April and March, both of those.
[37:41.640 --> 37:46.560]  You can go through and check that hidden in laptop batteries.
[37:46.560 --> 37:52.320]  And of course, that was the January 29th raid and it came out in April at NBC News, ABC News,
[37:52.320 --> 37:54.800]  CBS News, that was in March, that particular article.
[37:54.800 --> 37:59.360]  I mean, this is a fact, Roger, the very same reporters of the New York Times and Washington
[37:59.360 --> 38:05.200]  Post that reported on the laptop bombs right here out of the Washington Post are the same
[38:05.200 --> 38:06.920]  ones now attacking Trump.
[38:06.920 --> 38:11.040]  This is, it's like the same ones that said Trump was wiretapped, then come out and say
[38:11.040 --> 38:14.160]  they never said it and Trump's crazy on CNN.
[38:14.160 --> 38:15.160]  This is insane.
[38:15.160 --> 38:18.680]  It's like saying you're not Roger Stone or I'm not Alex Jones in front of God and country
[38:18.680 --> 38:21.600]  were obviously liars if we said that, but we're not liars.
[38:21.600 --> 38:23.680]  Now, let me make a couple of points here.
[38:23.680 --> 38:28.700]  First of all, the whole Trump sells out the country narrative is an outright lie.
[38:28.700 --> 38:33.120]  This is a hit piece by an opposition rag, but it's not a blunder.
[38:33.120 --> 38:37.120]  And when the rest of the media picks it up, that makes it propaganda because they are
[38:37.120 --> 38:40.320]  like the birds jumping off the telephone wire.
[38:40.320 --> 38:45.680]  There's no equivalency between sharing information and divulging secrets.
[38:45.680 --> 38:50.800]  In fact, if anyone checks the law, there's no such thing as a classified information
[38:50.800 --> 38:52.280]  when it comes to the president.
[38:52.280 --> 38:55.760]  He has the absolute right to divulge anything.
[38:55.760 --> 38:58.280]  Obama did it routinely.
[38:58.280 --> 39:03.600]  So you can see that this is a manufactured story is hysteria.
[39:03.600 --> 39:04.600]  It is.
[39:04.600 --> 39:09.800]  And frankly, the Russians are doing a better job at beating ISIS than we are.
[39:09.800 --> 39:14.560]  And if this helps defeat ISIS, where is the detriment to the United States?
[39:14.560 --> 39:17.120]  Where's the harm to the United States?
[39:17.120 --> 39:24.040]  How ironic that the Washington Post, the story that blew the cover up on the 1972 election
[39:24.040 --> 39:31.280]  is helping extend the cover up into the truth about the 2016 election, i.e., using this
[39:31.280 --> 39:36.880]  story to block the news of the new revelations regarding the murder of Seth Rich.
[39:36.880 --> 39:37.880]  And it's true.
[39:37.880 --> 39:40.640]  As bad as The New York Times is, they have some real journalists there.
[39:40.640 --> 39:44.720]  The Washington Post is leading the way in pure deception.
[39:44.720 --> 39:50.040]  And they were even quoted in articles of last week at the National White House Press
[39:50.040 --> 39:55.400]  center that President Trump wasn't at saying, we have a duty to bring him down, we're going
[39:55.400 --> 39:56.400]  to bring him down.
[39:56.400 --> 39:57.880]  And then they all decide to lie.
[39:57.880 --> 40:02.280]  There's even been articles in the news, almost The New York Times, saying it's time to go
[40:02.280 --> 40:05.320]  ahead and just lie because it's the right thing to do.
[40:05.320 --> 40:06.320]  I don't get it.
[40:06.320 --> 40:08.880]  This is, let me ask you this, Roger.
[40:08.880 --> 40:09.880]  Where does this go next?
[40:09.880 --> 40:11.680]  How does this tie into the FBI director?
[40:11.680 --> 40:13.400]  How does this tie into the future of this country?
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.840]  Because these are such crazed people where they just use anonymous sources that then
[40:18.840 --> 40:26.360]  put out patent disinfo that the second I heard he divulged the Yemen raid about ISIS plans
[40:26.360 --> 40:29.240]  to use laptops for bombs to put bombs inside laptops.
[40:29.240 --> 40:34.480]  I instantly knew the whole story, instantly knew it was a lie, and which that shows they
[40:34.480 --> 40:36.320]  knew it's all a lie.
[40:36.320 --> 40:38.120]  And they think we're that stupid.
[40:38.120 --> 40:43.120]  What planet, what Alice in Wonderland, as you said, rabbit hole, did I just fall down
[40:43.120 --> 40:44.120]  and break my ass?
[40:44.120 --> 40:51.120]  Look, we know that the Obama plants in the various intelligence agencies are withholding
[40:51.120 --> 40:53.680]  critical information from the president.
[40:53.680 --> 40:56.920]  It's not because he lacks the clearance or isn't entitled to it.
[40:56.920 --> 41:02.360]  It's because they are treasonous vipers who are looking for the most opportune moment
[41:02.360 --> 41:03.860]  to strike.
[41:03.860 --> 41:07.480]  The FBI director now becomes crucial for several reasons.
[41:07.480 --> 41:12.800]  One, the FBI must lead the investigation into the murder of Seth Rich.
[41:12.800 --> 41:15.120]  The president has that authority.
[41:15.120 --> 41:20.400]  Secondarily, the FBI needs to find the leakers of this information.
[41:20.400 --> 41:22.200]  Who in the NSA?
[41:22.200 --> 41:24.200]  Which Obama holdover?
[41:24.200 --> 41:28.080]  And let's be clear, they use the national security to put out lies.
[41:28.080 --> 41:31.120]  They, it's not even real leaks, it's false leaks.
[41:31.120 --> 41:37.440]  The most troubling thing that I have seen is the list of would-be FBI directors.
[41:37.440 --> 41:42.200]  To a man and woman, they are establishment insiders.
[41:42.200 --> 41:44.080]  And I'm told the president doesn't like this list.
[41:44.080 --> 41:50.840]  No, I have, my sources tell me that the president likes the idea of former New York police commissioner
[41:50.840 --> 41:54.040]  Ray Kelly, someone that he knows personally.
[41:54.040 --> 41:56.840]  The president doesn't know or have confidence in any law.
[41:56.840 --> 41:59.700]  Why did Gowdy say that he's not the right man for the job?
[41:59.700 --> 42:03.080]  That was, that was disappointing because I think it means he can't help but just totally
[42:03.080 --> 42:04.560]  go after the Democrats.
[42:04.560 --> 42:12.400]  Well, frankly, we need Gowdy in the, in the Russian, the full Russian collusion dust.
[42:12.400 --> 42:14.480]  By the way, he and Nunez have seen all the intel.
[42:14.480 --> 42:15.480]  It's total bull.
[42:15.480 --> 42:16.480]  In fact, it's the opposite.
[42:16.480 --> 42:18.600]  There, the Trump's all being spied on.
[42:18.600 --> 42:20.640]  And the true story is, again, illegal spying.
[42:20.640 --> 42:24.920]  Oh, Scalia, before he died, came out and said, I'm being spied on by Obama and they're blackmailing
[42:24.920 --> 42:26.120]  people, which we already knew.
[42:26.120 --> 42:27.880]  Well, look, this is not surprising.
[42:27.880 --> 42:32.200]  They spied on James Rosen, the Fox reporter who covers the White House.
[42:32.200 --> 42:34.440]  They wiretapped him illegally.
[42:34.440 --> 42:37.920]  And that is a much bigger crime than Watergate.
[42:37.920 --> 42:41.920]  How do journalists feel about the wiretapping of a journalist?
[42:41.920 --> 42:47.240]  It is incredible that we're looking at an FBI.
[42:47.240 --> 42:51.960]  There are people on this list who denied that the president was surveilled when we know
[42:51.960 --> 42:54.960]  now definitively that that is not the case.
[42:54.960 --> 42:58.680]  And we knew from the very same New York Times reporters that said that didn't happen a month
[42:58.680 --> 42:59.680]  later.
[42:59.680 --> 43:00.680]  They reported it did.
[43:00.680 --> 43:05.280]  And when they say it's fake news, InfoWars says we had a cover that said wiretapped and
[43:05.280 --> 43:06.920]  we have the physical newspaper.
[43:06.920 --> 43:07.920]  Yes, they changed it.
[43:07.920 --> 43:08.920]  We covered it.
[43:08.920 --> 43:11.200]  You and I on the 20th, we covered it live in D.C.
[43:11.200 --> 43:12.200]  Yeah.
[43:12.200 --> 43:13.200]  Because you were in there.
[43:13.200 --> 43:18.200]  Adding insult to injury this morning, Congressman Eric Swallow from California was on with Morning
[43:18.200 --> 43:19.200]  Joe.
[43:19.200 --> 43:24.120]  Now, Joe Scarborough may be upset with me because on the show, I revealed that he had a text
[43:24.120 --> 43:29.600]  relationship with Jared Kushner and that Kushner was lagging negative stories about
[43:29.600 --> 43:33.800]  Steve Bannon that Scarborough was delightfully putting out.
[43:33.800 --> 43:37.280]  I have confirmed that on both ends of the transmission.
[43:37.280 --> 43:43.440]  So they put Swallow on this morning to repeat yet again, the lie that Roger Stone knew in
[43:43.440 --> 43:48.120]  advance about the release of information regarding Hillary Clinton.
[43:48.120 --> 43:49.920]  This is very much like this story, Alex.
[43:49.920 --> 43:51.560]  Yeah, I knew it.
[43:51.560 --> 43:54.880]  WikiLeaks posted it on their Twitter feed on July 31st.
[43:54.880 --> 43:55.880]  It's the same crap.
[43:55.880 --> 43:57.280]  It's the same crap.
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.640]  So again, I am anxious to confront Mr. Swallow.
[44:01.640 --> 44:03.640]  This guy is a mannequin.
[44:03.640 --> 44:09.200]  He's a one-trick pony and that trick seems to be lying about me over and over again.
[44:09.200 --> 44:12.360]  I'm so hopeful, Alex, that I will be allowed to testify.
[44:12.360 --> 44:14.160]  Let me just raise this.
[44:14.160 --> 44:20.640]  How bombshell is it that you've got a respected former NYPD detective who's an investigator
[44:20.640 --> 44:21.640]  hired by the family.
[44:21.640 --> 44:23.160]  He says, yeah, I've talked to the police.
[44:23.160 --> 44:24.160]  They've been told to stand down.
[44:24.160 --> 44:25.760]  Yes, he was in contact with a SONGE.
[44:25.760 --> 44:29.880]  We have a SONGE basically in a bunch of clips saying we never give up sources, but he probably
[44:29.880 --> 44:30.880]  could have been our source.
[44:30.880 --> 44:31.880]  We're just going to stop right there.
[44:31.880 --> 44:34.680]  Well, I think a SONGE needs to come out now for his safety.
[44:34.680 --> 44:35.680]  Everybody's.
[44:35.680 --> 44:36.680]  It's not giving up a source.
[44:36.680 --> 44:40.800]  If the person's been killed and shot in the back, I understand technically he can say
[44:40.800 --> 44:41.800]  we never give it up.
[44:41.800 --> 44:46.160]  But that becomes almost like Ashberger's disorder or something, where someone just refuses
[44:46.160 --> 44:50.000]  to go with the actual spirit of the law, the spirit of the agreement.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.320]  If I was a source for a big story and then I get killed, please release that I was the
[44:54.320 --> 44:55.920]  source.
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.760]  Obviously, you are released from your agreement not to release a source.
[45:01.760 --> 45:07.440]  If the source is a hero killed in the service to the Republic and not a Russian, you notice.
[45:07.440 --> 45:14.080]  Well, and also, why has the New York Times never reported that the British diplomat Craig
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.240]  Murray has said repeatedly that he's met with the U.S. Intelligence Agency leaker and that
[45:19.240 --> 45:20.240]  it is not a Russian.
[45:20.240 --> 45:24.760]  Yeah, and he also went so far as to imply that it was Seth Rich, who he met in a parking
[45:24.760 --> 45:26.400]  lot near American University.
[45:26.400 --> 45:27.400]  Yes.
[45:27.400 --> 45:29.160]  So we believe that some of these doctors-
[45:29.160 --> 45:33.840]  Seth Rich was a good Democrat that read all this evil about, let's keep people poor in
[45:33.840 --> 45:34.840]  the dark.
[45:34.840 --> 45:35.840]  Let's have race war.
[45:35.840 --> 45:37.480]  Let's steal more Haitian money.
[45:37.480 --> 45:39.520]  Hey, we got kids ready for you in the hot tub.
[45:39.520 --> 45:44.640]  No, the most important thing Seth Rich knew was that they stopped the vote count in Iowa.
[45:44.640 --> 45:45.640]  They stole it from Sanders.
[45:45.640 --> 45:47.680]  They said that they had not stopped the vote count.
[45:47.680 --> 45:51.680]  Bernie Sanders would have won the Iowa caucuses and Hillary Clinton would have been toast
[45:51.680 --> 45:52.680]  as far as they-
[45:52.680 --> 45:53.680]  They stopped.
[45:53.680 --> 45:56.680]  They said the vote the day before California didn't count and that donors had met with
[45:56.680 --> 45:58.680]  Hillary and then decided it was her.
[45:58.680 --> 46:04.960]  So this is a guy who acted on the basis of conscience, who saw the Democratic Party that
[46:04.960 --> 46:10.320]  he believed in being hijacked by the Clintons and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, incidentally
[46:10.320 --> 46:15.840]  a number of local Republicans in Fort Lauderdale are urging me to challenge Deborah Wasserman
[46:15.840 --> 46:16.840]  Schultz.
[46:16.840 --> 46:23.000]  She's a candidate material, but if it serves the purpose of exposing her and her role in
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.520]  undermining the progressives in the party-
[46:25.520 --> 46:29.280]  If you were the weapon to just expose her and get a patriot elected, that'd be great.
[46:29.280 --> 46:30.520]  I would have to think about it.
[46:30.520 --> 46:33.200]  Maybe just win for real, but the kamikaze.
[46:33.200 --> 46:34.880]  Well, it's a terrible district.
[46:34.880 --> 46:38.920]  It was kind of custom drawn for her.
[46:38.920 --> 46:40.880]  She is a terror.
[46:40.880 --> 46:42.400]  She's a horrific person.
[46:42.400 --> 46:43.720]  I might just think about it.
[46:43.720 --> 46:46.840]  All right, let's talk about what's coming up in a little bit in the next hour.
[46:46.840 --> 46:49.800]  We're going to go tape a big special piece for the nightly news this evening.
[46:49.800 --> 46:51.760]  We appreciate Roger being here, working so hard.
[46:51.760 --> 46:54.800]  We appreciate all of you and your support, but let's go over to one of these clips.
[46:54.800 --> 46:59.600]  In fact, as we mentioned to Sange, Julian Assange on Seth Rich, here's just one of the
[46:59.600 --> 47:03.520]  many places like Hannity, you name it, where he basically said, look, I don't want to say
[47:03.520 --> 47:05.720]  he's our source, but he very well could be the source.
[47:05.720 --> 47:09.840]  And the word is Seth Rich was the source and now you have a detective saying that and people
[47:09.840 --> 47:13.240]  dying and the family that hired him now backing off.
[47:13.240 --> 47:19.880]  Let me tell you, I've talked to people that met with the widow of folks that, you know,
[47:19.880 --> 47:24.000]  Michael Hastings, people whose cars blow up as they drive down the road.
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.120]  And at first, they're at the funeral saying, oh, yeah, they killed him.
[47:26.120 --> 47:29.040]  I'm going to go public or, you know, there was foul play they're going to pay.
[47:29.040 --> 47:31.880]  And then she goes on Pierce Morgan and says, oh, no, it was no big deal.
[47:31.880 --> 47:32.880]  Totally natural causes.
[47:32.880 --> 47:37.320]  And she was a top person as a support aid on the National Security Council.
[47:37.320 --> 47:39.640]  So from their intel, we've got she's a high level spook.
[47:39.640 --> 47:40.640]  So was he.
[47:40.640 --> 47:41.880]  He found out stuff so bad.
[47:41.880 --> 47:43.800]  He had a conscience.
[47:43.800 --> 47:48.160]  Michael Hastings, he went public and then his car blew up and shot the engine a hundred
[47:48.160 --> 47:49.640]  yards down the road.
[47:49.640 --> 47:51.160]  Something that's impossible unless there's a bomb.
[47:51.160 --> 47:53.840]  And he called people that I know and said, I'm being chased.
[47:53.840 --> 47:54.840]  They're trying to kill me.
[47:54.840 --> 47:55.840]  It's Homeland Security.
[47:55.840 --> 47:59.920]  Obama has a special unit of hit men, you know, get the data out, but the data didn't get
[47:59.920 --> 48:00.920]  out.
[48:00.920 --> 48:01.920]  So that's what happens with the families.
[48:01.920 --> 48:03.400]  And I think that may have happened here.
[48:03.400 --> 48:04.400]  We'll get Roger's take on that.
[48:04.400 --> 48:08.040]  But here's Julian Assange in the American political lexicon.
[48:08.040 --> 48:11.200]  That's such a thing as the October surprise.
[48:11.200 --> 48:16.960]  The stuff that you're sitting on, is an October surprise in there?
[48:16.960 --> 48:19.200]  We didn't even know what you're sitting on.
[48:19.200 --> 48:23.320]  Well, he never sits on material.
[48:23.320 --> 48:27.600]  Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant
[48:27.600 --> 48:28.600]  risks.
[48:28.600 --> 48:34.800]  As a 27 year old that works for the DNC, we shot in the back murdered just two weeks
[48:34.800 --> 48:39.400]  ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.
[48:39.400 --> 48:42.880]  So that was just a robbery, I believe, wasn't it?
[48:42.880 --> 48:43.880]  No.
[48:43.880 --> 48:44.880]  There's no finding.
[48:44.880 --> 48:47.560]  So what are you suggesting?
[48:47.560 --> 48:50.360]  What are you suggesting?
[48:50.360 --> 49:00.320]  I'm suggesting that our sources take risks and they become concerned to see things occurring
[49:00.320 --> 49:01.480]  like that.
[49:01.480 --> 49:03.080]  But was he one of your sources then?
[49:03.080 --> 49:06.400]  I mean, we don't comment on who our sources are.
[49:06.400 --> 49:11.360]  So I make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington.
[49:11.360 --> 49:18.560]  Because we have to understand how high the stakes are in the United States and that our
[49:18.560 --> 49:23.960]  sources are, you know, our sources face serious risks.
[49:23.960 --> 49:28.560]  That's why they come to us so we can protect their anonymity.
[49:28.560 --> 49:30.680]  That's quite something to suggest a murder.
[49:30.680 --> 49:33.880]  That's basically what you're doing.
[49:33.880 --> 49:43.440]  Well, others have suggested that we are investigating to understand what happened in that situation
[49:43.440 --> 49:45.240]  with Seth Rich.
[49:45.240 --> 49:49.040]  I think it is a concerning situation.
[49:49.040 --> 49:50.040]  There's not a conclusion yet.
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.280]  We wouldn't be willing to state a conclusion, but we are concerned about it.
[49:55.280 --> 50:02.520]  More importantly, a variety of organic sources are concerned when that kind of thing happens.
[50:02.520 --> 50:07.000]  All right, and then we have Podesta emails in WikiLeaks where he says, I'd like to make
[50:07.000 --> 50:08.480]  an example of these leakers.
[50:08.480 --> 50:11.160]  It's on Paul Watson's article today on InfoWars.
[50:11.160 --> 50:13.440]  Whether they're guilty or not, I don't even care.
[50:13.440 --> 50:18.000]  Let's just start making examples now and then you see what happens to Rich.
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.120]  But we always play that clip and then that's okay.
[50:20.120 --> 50:25.120]  But I saw it on Hannity or one of the clips where he said, I'm saying he could be our
[50:25.120 --> 50:26.120]  source.
[50:26.120 --> 50:27.120]  Asan said he could be our source.
[50:27.120 --> 50:29.040]  He offered a $25,000 reward.
[50:29.040 --> 50:32.400]  Why would you offer a reward for someone who was not your source?
[50:32.400 --> 50:36.360]  But now we have the detective saying the police said there's a cover up.
[50:36.360 --> 50:39.880]  The point is they're asking us to ignore logic.
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.000]  In other words, the guy who's the head of the department from whom the documents leak
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  is murdered and we're supposed to expect that there's nothing suspicious about that.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  That's right.
[50:49.000 --> 50:50.000]  There's Podesta.
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.400]  I'm definitely for making an example of suspected leak or whether or not we have any real basis
[50:53.400 --> 50:54.400]  for it.
[50:54.400 --> 50:55.400]  That's right.
[50:55.400 --> 51:00.240]  Just make an example even if he's not the one.
[51:00.240 --> 51:02.840]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[51:02.840 --> 51:04.960]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[51:04.960 --> 51:07.160]  Are you happy paying high prices?

[54:21.440 --> 54:27.600]  years for m4slife.com, it's ZShield, concentrated zeolites, shilligy and a bunch of other key
[54:27.600 --> 54:34.960]  herbs to a very thick, powerful oil, this isn't filler with alcohol, this is just pure oils
[54:34.960 --> 54:39.600]  and pure compounds from mother nature and some acids that help uptake.
[54:39.600 --> 54:45.760]  It's amazing for heavy metal and toxin removal out of the body, this is something similar
[54:45.760 --> 54:47.880]  to what they have in clinics in Europe.
[54:47.880 --> 54:54.760]  But research it for yourself, the organic lavage root, organic cleavers, tamarind fruit,
[54:54.760 --> 55:00.280]  organic orange peel, organic cilantro, organic milk fissile seed, fulvic and humic acid,
[55:00.280 --> 55:07.440]  shilligy and zeolite concentrates, the new product, ZShield, available at m4warslife.com
[55:07.440 --> 55:09.440]  or AAA 2533139.
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.880]  By the way, we're selling, because they're popular again, at cost, Donald Trump's my
[55:13.880 --> 55:20.400]  president, navy blue, election style shirts to trigger folks and to spread the word and
[55:20.400 --> 55:24.120]  to meet like-minded people and to stand for these bullies.
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.160]  When these three new shirts are sold out, they're limited edition, that's it.
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.800]  We have the, Trump is my president, red shirt that was so popular, that's gone, that's history.
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.200]  We now have the navy blue with m4wars.com on the shoulder, Trump pens 2020, we have
[55:37.200 --> 55:40.640]  Trump as my president, we have three different shirts and when they're gone, they're gone.
[55:40.640 --> 55:49.480]  They're 495, that is cost at m4warsstore.com or AAA 2533139 and absolutely a part of history
[55:49.480 --> 55:54.080]  and support the m4wars, really it's support in free speech because this is a lost leader.
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.160]  These t-shirts are going to end up in the Smithsonian Institute, there's no doubt about
[55:57.160 --> 55:58.160]  it.
[55:58.160 --> 56:02.600]  Just like the iconic Clinton rape t-shirt, these are going to be collector's items.
[56:02.600 --> 56:07.080]  Years from now, you will have this to pass on to your grandchildren and say, you were
[56:07.080 --> 56:08.080]  in the revolution.
[56:08.080 --> 56:11.840]  Whether we won or lost, now I want to bring that up a little bit in the next hour.
[56:11.840 --> 56:12.840]  How do we win?
[56:12.840 --> 56:13.840]  What's the next shoe to drop?
[56:13.840 --> 56:16.800]  Clearly, we're in a civil war already, an information war.
[56:16.800 --> 56:19.240]  They're discredited, but they're so hubris filled, they don't care.
[56:19.240 --> 56:22.400]  You've got this weird club that these guys around that you're going to be talking about
[56:22.400 --> 56:28.160]  Brennan and others and McMaster, but before we go there, you've got the Washington Post
[56:28.160 --> 56:34.160]  and others saying in the news at the White House Correspondents' Dinner without the President
[56:34.160 --> 56:37.720]  there, our job is to destroy the President and bring him down, we're going to do it,
[56:37.720 --> 56:38.920]  we don't care.
[56:38.920 --> 56:42.840]  And then they put out a fake story that he's got putting listening devices in and that's
[56:42.840 --> 56:43.840]  not true.
[56:43.840 --> 56:47.200]  So then he's leaking classified info and that's not true, it's laptop info that's been in
[56:47.200 --> 56:50.080]  the news for months that Trump's allowed to release, he's the President.
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.840]  All this is going on, they're chomping in the bit, you've got Schumer saying, President
[56:53.840 --> 56:58.800]  better watch it, we've got six ways to Sunday the intelligence community to get back at
[56:58.800 --> 56:59.800]  you.
[56:59.800 --> 57:03.240]  Yeah, we see, you're the hijackers, you're the foreign globalist, you're the people
[57:03.240 --> 57:07.120]  trying to bring our country down telling us our American President is the problem, here's
[57:07.120 --> 57:09.320]  Chuck E. Schumer, so what do we do about these traders?
[57:09.320 --> 57:10.320]  Here's Schumer.
[57:10.320 --> 57:15.280]  Take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday of getting back at you.
[57:15.280 --> 57:20.680]  So even for a practical supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do
[57:20.680 --> 57:21.680]  this.
[57:21.680 --> 57:24.120]  So what does Trump do about the flying monkeys?
[57:24.120 --> 57:29.320]  That was an admission that the intelligence agencies are not under civilian control.
[57:29.320 --> 57:31.640]  They're rogue flying monkeys.
[57:31.640 --> 57:35.280]  Chuck just kind of in this swarmy kind of way, just spit it right out there.
[57:35.280 --> 57:39.000]  Yes, we got a bunch of scum threatening us, they believe they own us, they want our guns,
[57:39.000 --> 57:42.320]  they want our kids, they're a teacher of five-year-olds, you know how to give blow jobs, that's what
[57:42.320 --> 57:46.400]  I mean, they want to destroy the country, what do we do with a bunch of brazen, crazy
[57:46.400 --> 57:50.600]  megalomaniacs like Chuck E. Schumer, a flying monkey, that they became flying out of Barack
[57:50.600 --> 57:52.280]  Obama's butt?
[57:52.280 --> 58:00.440]  First of all, you need a reinvigorated, non-political FBI that can ferret out actual crimes, including
[58:00.440 --> 58:01.800]  these leaks.
[58:01.800 --> 58:07.400]  That's why the selection of the FBI director is going to be a crucial question.
[58:07.400 --> 58:11.600]  The other thing, Alex, that is related to this, the upcoming release of the John F.
[58:11.600 --> 58:13.240]  Kennedy assassination, doctor.
[58:13.240 --> 58:17.640]  That's an example, the president has his own branch of government, and they've got him
[58:17.640 --> 58:20.480]  where he wanted to meet with Putin, sorry, but shouldn't he just meet with Putin and
[58:20.480 --> 58:21.480]  call this out now?
[58:21.480 --> 58:24.240]  Look, shouldn't Putin just fly here right now?
[58:24.240 --> 58:29.520]  Putin, look, Trump wants peace with Russia, peace is accomplished through increased trust,
[58:29.520 --> 58:32.480]  trust is accomplished through cooperation, and they won't let us cooperate, here's the
[58:32.480 --> 58:36.480]  deal, the globalists are the enemy, they're the ones screwing us over, not the Russians,
[58:36.480 --> 58:42.120]  the enemy is Michael Moore, Chuck and Schumer, and all the other flying monkeys, flying monkey
[58:42.120 --> 58:43.120]  control freaks.
[58:43.120 --> 58:50.280]  We'll be right back, Roger, 70 seconds with Roger Stone, Stone, Zone, StoneCulture.com.
[58:50.280 --> 58:53.480]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[58:53.480 --> 58:55.200]  Why is this so good?
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.720]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[58:59.720 --> 59:04.520]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[59:04.520 --> 59:10.240]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[59:10.240 --> 59:13.560]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:13.560 --> 59:18.680]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[59:18.680 --> 59:19.920]  going on everywhere.
[59:19.920 --> 59:20.920]  These are all parasites.
[59:20.920 --> 59:23.640]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[59:23.640 --> 59:28.600]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood, I recommend
[59:28.600 --> 59:31.360]  doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:31.360 --> 59:34.480]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:34.480 --> 59:38.280]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose.
[59:38.280 --> 59:41.280]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[59:41.280 --> 59:44.560]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[59:44.560 --> 59:46.760]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:46.760 --> 59:52.960]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:52.960 --> 1:00:22.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:31.000]  Here is a month ago, Chuck E. Schumer threatening President-elect Donald Trump.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.640]  You better do whatever we say, buddy, or we'll smack you upside the head.
[1:00:33.640 --> 1:00:35.320]  There's not the intelligence community.
[1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:37.920]  We wouldn't have the made-up Russian narrative.
[1:00:37.920 --> 1:00:41.160]  And now the Washington Post, he's hiding their hidden devices.
[1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:45.160]  I mean, I mean, I'm expecting they're going to claim that Trump's actually, you know,
[1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:49.040]  wearing a Russian bug, you know, down his throat or something.
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:51.520]  That's all made up, baloney.
[1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:52.520]  And they never get in trouble.
[1:00:52.520 --> 1:00:56.280]  They never, there's no consequences to any of this line.
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:00:58.000]  Here's Chuck E. Schumer.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:02.080]  You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back
[1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:03.080]  at you.
[1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:04.080]  I'll get you.
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:08.400]  So even for a practical reason, the hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do
[1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:09.400]  this.
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:11.600]  What do you think the intelligence community would do if they were motive to?
[1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:12.600]  I don't know.
[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:13.600]  But I, from what?
[1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:14.600]  I don't know.
[1:01:14.600 --> 1:01:15.600]  Ask Jack Kennedy what they would do.
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:19.520]  They are very upset with how he has treated them and talked about them.
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:21.080]  And we need the intelligence community.
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:22.400]  We need them.
[1:01:22.400 --> 1:01:23.400]  The Russian hacking.
[1:01:23.400 --> 1:01:24.400]  We need them.
[1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:27.480]  Without the intelligence community, we wouldn't have discovered it.
[1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:29.000]  Roger, I want to be clear.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Discovered what, Senator?
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:33.880]  Do you have some proof of Russian hacking so you could produce it if you have some?
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:35.720]  Why is Schumer not in Hollywood?
[1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:41.360]  He could would be the ultimate psychopath, villain, child molester, kidnapper in Hollywood.
[1:01:41.360 --> 1:01:42.880]  I'm telling you, I'm not saying he's a child molester.
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:43.880]  I'm not saying he's a kidnapper.
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:44.880]  He is a kidnapper.
[1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:45.880]  But he could play with it.
[1:01:45.880 --> 1:01:48.040]  He literally comes off as like, he could play.
[1:01:48.040 --> 1:01:53.000]  He could go back to the 1930s, Wizard of Oz, I'll get you and your little dog to, I'll
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  get your constitution, my pretty, go get them all, take their children, destroy their economy
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  and get their guns.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.320]  And that little president thinks he'll show them the way, go to the Emerald City and burn
[1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:05.320]  it all down.
[1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:10.720]  Chuckie Schumer, I'm so scared of you, Chuckie.
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:12.720]  That's pretty good.
[1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:15.400]  Chuck Schumer is one of the most odious individuals in the world.
[1:02:15.400 --> 1:02:20.000]  He has an inherent interest in knowing who the US attorney is for New York, for the New
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  York district.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.640]  We have an elite that just wants to piss on America because we're the alpha.
[1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:29.160]  Why don't the elite just get out of the way and end this, we can end this destructive
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:33.280]  conflict and bring order to the galaxy.
[1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:37.840]  Chuck Schumer, the most dangerous place in Washington, Alex, is between Chuck Schumer
[1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:40.760]  and a television camera.
[1:02:40.760 --> 1:02:42.640]  I want to raise this question though.
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:50.160]  Why is it that General Mattis, General McMaster, John Brennan, formerly of the CIA, Michael
[1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:56.120]  Hayden, former of the CIA, and James Clapper, why do these guys all have shaved heads?
[1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:57.240]  Because that's part of being a leather dead.
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:00.840]  Is it some secret club or something that they're in?
[1:03:00.840 --> 1:03:07.280]  I mean, it is just, it defies, you know, the odds of coincidence that every one of these
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:12.240]  guys have the same kind of look, there it is, extraordinary.
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:15.040]  By the way, his smirk at the end of this kind of gives the whole thing away.
[1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:18.520]  It was like a suck of golf balls for a garden hose.
[1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:22.240]  Look at the way he smirks when it's over, thinking, wow, we pulled this off, now my
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:25.240]  job might be safe for another couple of weeks.
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:26.240]  Sorry.
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:33.240]  I mean, look, he is, he is temperamentally not fit for this job, sadly.
[1:03:33.240 --> 1:03:37.840]  I got a little bit too much.
[1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:42.200]  Well, the choice is, I mean, again, these things must be done delicately.
[1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:44.800]  He needs, the president needs to clean house.
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:45.800]  Look at this guy.
[1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:47.960]  I mean, he needs to clean house.
[1:03:47.960 --> 1:03:52.000]  You know, possums like to climb into like dead animals on the side of the road.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:57.200]  You know, the left is having a spasm, they're unhinged, they're acting like the president
[1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:59.200]  handed Putin the nuclear codes.
[1:03:59.200 --> 1:04:02.920]  Well, they're acting like poods, because they're the foreign globalists selling the country
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:07.120]  out, so they have to just then pick Russia and claim, oh, it's the foreign powers, because
[1:04:07.120 --> 1:04:11.160]  they're the globalist foreign power, and Trump's kicking out the multinational pieces
[1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:12.160]  of garbage.
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:15.960]  And this is why I think the rushing collusion issue is going to be critical.
[1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:21.560]  This is how you break the back of both the mainstream media that has run with this, and
[1:04:21.560 --> 1:04:24.960]  the intelligence services which have manufactured it.
[1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:26.840]  They have nothing.
[1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:27.840]  They have zero.
[1:04:27.840 --> 1:04:28.840]  All right, I agree.
[1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:32.680]  I want to come back and ask you the next shoe to drop, because you told me last night,
[1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:35.280]  and you said you talked about it on there, I mean, I think there's a good chance they'll
[1:04:35.280 --> 1:04:36.280]  bring Trump down.
[1:04:36.280 --> 1:04:38.240]  The problem is, then that'll cause a civil war.
[1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:44.760]  These people are so crazy, they're so full of hutzpah, bravada, false confidence, that
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:48.040]  I mean, I know they all got Mr. Clean shit, I'm not against people that have shaped heads,
[1:04:48.040 --> 1:04:50.680]  but there's a little something going on there.
[1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:54.120]  I guess because that's because they put their heads before David Rockefeller died, like in
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  his butt or something.
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:56.120]  I'm sorry, I'm gonna stop.
[1:04:56.120 --> 1:04:57.120]  I'm out of control.
[1:04:57.120 --> 1:05:00.240]  I'm obviously trying to feed the trolls right now.
[1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:04.040]  Over the weekend, President Donald Trump has called on God to bless and empower our country
[1:05:04.040 --> 1:05:05.960]  and our people, and reaffirmed our faith.
[1:05:05.960 --> 1:05:11.400]  Because in America, we don't worship government, we worship God, and it's why we proudly proclaim
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:17.160]  that we are one nation under God, every time we say the pledge of allegiance.
[1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:19.040]  Which God exactly has he invoked?
[1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:20.960]  Was it the God of Hillary Clinton?
[1:05:20.960 --> 1:05:23.200]  Rich people, God bless us.
[1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:25.760]  Or was it the God of Barack Hussein Obama?
[1:05:25.760 --> 1:05:28.160]  God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.
[1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:32.840]  No, President Trump has called on the one true God of the universe, whose name is above
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:33.840]  every name.
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:35.120]  Champions for Christ.
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:39.720]  He testified to the greatest pieces of literature in the history of mankind because of the power
[1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:41.960]  contained within the words of this book.
[1:05:41.960 --> 1:05:47.120]  You are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope, and love.
[1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:50.960]  Even the most remote areas of India, and especially Africa, have heard of him.
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:56.040]  Jesus Christ has been preached in and is believed on in all nations of the world.
[1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:58.360]  Our God is not like their God.
[1:05:58.360 --> 1:05:59.880]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[1:05:59.880 --> 1:06:03.640]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:05.920]  in stock at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:07.720]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:11.680]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood
[1:06:11.680 --> 1:06:13.080]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:17.680]  That's why the last surgeon general's report on oral health warns that your oral health

[1:06:20.440 --> 1:06:23.920]  Super blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with
[1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:27.520]  good halogen iodide, some of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:32.080]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out
[1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:34.560]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:39.200]  Just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen by our dental experts include xylitol,
[1:06:39.200 --> 1:06:44.120]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more, due to requests from listeners who found that
[1:06:44.120 --> 1:06:46.640]  spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:50.600]  We have created the new bubblegum flavored super blue that is spearmint-free.

[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:48.560]  in the body's natural processes, but it also assists with many other functions of the body.

[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:31.200]  Roger Stone's with us another segment that he's going to tape, a powerful piece, which
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:34.200]  is going to be Roger Stone Unchained.
[1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:40.640]  It's a true flow, not an interviewer, but Roger in there, absolutely annihilating the
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:41.640]  globalists.
[1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:44.800]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and with the anti-villain Roger Stone over here, that's what they call
[1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:48.160]  him a villain, because they're the fake news.
[1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:52.800]  We've got so much to break down here today, coming up after Roger leaves us, Globalist
[1:08:52.800 --> 1:08:55.280]  Mag claims American Revolution was a mistake.
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:56.280]  That's a close quote.
[1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:01.960]  I saw the Boston Globe a few years ago actually had a debate they hosted about getting rid
[1:09:01.960 --> 1:09:06.960]  of the Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence, and then it was wrong to secede from England.
[1:09:06.960 --> 1:09:10.280]  They'd narrowly voted, though, in the little contest they had to stay in America.
[1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:13.720]  So they're patriots, I guess, who just barely want to stay in America.
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:14.720]  But here it is.
[1:09:14.720 --> 1:09:20.200]  In Canada, was the American Revolution such a good idea?
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:24.640]  This is what we get from the New York Magazine, New Yorker Magazine, that was saying that
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:29.320]  they're organizing the overthrow of Trump in Congress bipartisanly.
[1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:35.640]  And so because America, it has George Washington standing on top of a pile of chains and skulls,
[1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:39.920]  literally saying, we're the devil, they're the ones claiming Trump's the enemy because
[1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:46.800]  he loves America, they're the anti-Americans, and they project who they are onto us.
[1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:50.720]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[1:09:50.720 --> 1:09:57.280]  And the coming narrative for the Globalists and the two-party duopoly, the political establishment
[1:09:57.280 --> 1:10:00.120]  is Donald Trump is insane.
[1:10:00.120 --> 1:10:04.320]  It's not that he's crazy, it's that he has Alzheimer's and it's in the advanced stages.
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:05.400]  This is nonsense.
[1:10:05.400 --> 1:10:06.400]  This is a lie.
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:07.640]  But mark my words.
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:10.520]  This is the new meme of the far left.
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:17.040]  This is the new meme of those who would essentially just depose him and remove him from power
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:18.720]  under the 25th Amendment.
[1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:22.240]  Every time I've talked to Trump, he brings up something I said on the show or the last
[1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:27.000]  thing we talked about a month before, and it's just like, what are you even doing calling
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.880]  up congratulating me that I got remarried?
[1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:29.880]  How'd you even know this?
[1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:32.760]  And the media are like, oh, Alex didn't want Donald Trump.
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:33.760]  He didn't want Trump on his show.
[1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:34.760]  No, it's the opposite.
[1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:35.760]  He's too important.
[1:10:35.760 --> 1:10:36.760]  He's too busy.
[1:10:36.760 --> 1:10:39.480]  I was like, sir, don't worry about it.
[1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:40.640]  He said he'd come on in a few weeks.
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:42.040]  I said, don't worry about it, sir.
[1:10:42.040 --> 1:10:45.960]  And then they turn that into I don't want Trump, and I like backslap him again, the
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:47.460]  opposite of reality.
[1:10:47.460 --> 1:10:48.960]  He has a phenomenal memory.
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:50.160]  I've known him for 40 years.
[1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:53.520]  I see no evidence whatsoever that he is not as sharp as he has.
[1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:57.080]  But Nancy Pelosi thinks Bush is still in office in three different interviews.
[1:10:57.080 --> 1:11:00.520]  And Maxine Waters is Ukraine is part of Russia.
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:03.920]  So worse than that, well, it actually is at least the east of it.
[1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:04.920]  It's worse.
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:06.280]  She thinks Putin invaded Korea.
[1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:07.280]  That's correct.
[1:11:07.280 --> 1:11:08.280]  Yes.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:09.280]  I'm sorry.
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:10.280]  I'm ranting.
[1:11:10.280 --> 1:11:11.280]  Go ahead.
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:13.200]  No, this is this is going to be a major drive by the left, Alex.
[1:11:13.200 --> 1:11:15.960]  They are going to try to now go for broke.
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:18.240]  Trump is insane, and he has to be removed.
[1:11:18.240 --> 1:11:20.920]  By the way, I forgot to tell them, what's the name of the video will pull it up.
[1:11:20.920 --> 1:11:23.720]  The one where they're claiming is he's listening to somebody that he has Alzheimer's.
[1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:24.720]  What's the name of the video?
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:25.720]  No.
[1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:26.720]  Trump signs of Alzheimer's, I think.
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:27.720]  Yes, it is out yesterday.
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:28.720]  Do you guys pull it up?
[1:11:28.720 --> 1:11:29.720]  We'll play it in the background.
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:30.720]  Go ahead.
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:31.720]  Sorry.
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:34.920]  Now, this is this is going to be a major thrust for those who don't know how the 25th
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:36.360]  Amendment works.
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:41.840]  If a majority of the Trump cabinet and the vice president determined that the president
[1:11:41.840 --> 1:11:47.080]  does not have the mental capacity to carry out the duties of the job, he's removed.
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:54.440]  Now, if he seeks to fight it, it goes to the US House of Representatives for a vote where
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:59.280]  Paul Ryan would stab him right in the- Oh, by the way, Paul Ryan came out yesterday and
[1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:01.360]  said he wants answers and backed it up.
[1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.920]  The Trump's a Russian agent.
[1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:05.720]  I am so sick of this Russian stuff.
[1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.360]  We're restoring the Republic.
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:09.080]  We put $3 trillion in the stock market.
[1:12:09.080 --> 1:12:15.160]  You dead listeners, $300 billion in new jobs, securing the borders, returning the Republic,
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:20.160]  rebuilding the military, cutting the UN funding, getting a conservative to the Supreme Court.
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:26.280]  If that's Russian, then I want to be under Russian rule, but it's not.
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:31.480]  It's people saying we don't want to be America, merged with world government, become socialist.
[1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:35.480]  Oh, but Trump's anti-American, no, they're anti-American.
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:36.480]  They're the plague.
[1:12:36.480 --> 1:12:37.480]  Sorry.
[1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:45.080]  In the 1950s, they accused us, conservatives, of being of red-baiting, of demagoguery and
[1:12:45.080 --> 1:12:46.080]  of- And it was true.
[1:12:46.080 --> 1:12:50.640]  They were horrible anti-American bills, beavering away like termites.
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:52.720]  But now, it's a complete role reversal.
[1:12:52.720 --> 1:12:54.640]  Now, but they weren't Russians.
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:55.640]  They were commies.
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:56.640]  Exactly.
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:13:00.560]  And anyone who isn't for war over Syria with the Russians is now a Russian agent.
[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:02.440]  A traitor to the United States.
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:07.640]  The liberal New York garbage system took over Russia and turned it into that and has been
[1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:09.280]  trying to do it the whole time.
[1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:10.560]  It wasn't the Russians.
[1:13:10.560 --> 1:13:16.120]  The globalists captured Russia and used it as a tool to run around murdering everybody.
[1:13:16.120 --> 1:13:17.120]  Can't we see?
[1:13:17.120 --> 1:13:19.680]  And they want full control of this country.
[1:13:19.680 --> 1:13:25.520]  You saw the left whining about the blacklist of the 1930s and again in the 50s forever.
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:29.840]  Now, their blacklist that includes people like Alex Jones and other patriots.
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:30.840]  It's a real blacklist.
[1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:36.240]  It's a blacklist, which is based on circumventing the First Amendment and a free press in this
[1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:37.240]  country.
[1:13:37.240 --> 1:13:39.360]  Let's just tell Soros, Brock and all of them, we're beating you.
[1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:40.360]  You'll never defeat America.
[1:13:40.360 --> 1:13:41.560]  You'll never mount our head on the wall.
[1:13:41.560 --> 1:13:42.560]  Roger, join me.
[1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:44.000]  America will defeat you.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Join me in this.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Come on, Roger.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  All right.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  There you go.
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  David Brock, this is just for you.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  Yeah.
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.400]  We're having a good time here today.
[1:13:52.400 --> 1:13:54.400]  You'll never defeat America.
[1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:55.400]  Sorry.
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:14:02.080]  But this idea that the American Revolution, no, no, no, you will, sorry.
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:06.200]  The idea that the American Revolution was a mistake, Alex, this is so elitist.
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:09.960]  This red-blooded freedom we got there, buddy, once, that's not a mistake.
[1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:10.960]  You're a mistake.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:11.960]  The highest standard.
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:14.280]  Best party you ran down the ass, cracking your mother, Brock.
[1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:15.280]  Sorry.
[1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:16.280]  Go ahead.
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:17.280]  Look, all right.
[1:14:17.280 --> 1:14:18.280]  I'm out of control.
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:19.280]  Apologize to Christian stations.
[1:14:19.280 --> 1:14:23.400]  I'm going to control myself because this country is in total war and I'm sick of it.
[1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:24.400]  Go ahead.
[1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:27.560]  Look, nobody's taken more of the brunt of this than I have.
[1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:33.960]  Look, I cannot wait to confront that preening, whining, pain in the ass, Adam Schiff.
[1:14:33.960 --> 1:14:36.640]  This guy is the worst stiff I've ever seen.
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:39.880]  He makes George Bush look like a party animal.
[1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:44.560]  I mean, if you watch the guy, he is oozing in sincerity.
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:51.360]  And in March, he said that he had seen conclusive evidence of Russian hacking, a Russian interference
[1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:52.360]  in the election.
[1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:58.680]  And in April, he said to, to real clear politics, he'd seen no evidence of Russian
[1:14:58.680 --> 1:14:59.680]  inclusion.
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:00.680]  I saw conclusive.
[1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:01.680]  What is it?
[1:15:01.680 --> 1:15:05.440]  I saw conclusive proof that this guy is so full of Schiff, his eyes are brown.
[1:15:05.440 --> 1:15:08.080]  I was about to say, I mean, he is full of Schiff.
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:09.080]  Indeed.
[1:15:09.080 --> 1:15:10.080]  You have done well, Stone.
[1:15:10.080 --> 1:15:12.960]  Why do I feel so fired up right now?
[1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:17.240]  Look, I have to assume the Democrats are afraid to face me.
[1:15:17.240 --> 1:15:21.680]  They keep saying they want me to testify, but there's no invitation.
[1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:22.680]  I've made it clear.
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:24.120]  I don't need a subpoena.
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:25.280]  Alex doesn't need a subpoena.
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:28.160]  They've accused him of being a Russian agent.
[1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:30.600]  When do we get our day in the court of public?
[1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:34.520]  You imagine like the Russians trying to tell me what to do?
[1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:39.360]  Well, or that, or that they're financing all of these bots when it's David Brock and
[1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:45.880]  the Soros flying monkeys who have the bots out spewing hate, spewing dissension, spewing
[1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:52.320]  a revolution against the American government and the US Constitution.
[1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:54.040]  That's where we are.
[1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:55.040]  I totally agree with you.
[1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:58.360]  Here's a breakdown of us last night, McMaster exposed as White House leaker.
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:01.800]  Here's a clip from our live feed about an hour after it came out with Roger and I.
[1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:02.800]  Here it is.
[1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:06.800]  So, now they come out today, the Washington Post, and say anonymous source.
[1:16:06.800 --> 1:16:12.760]  The incident anonymous source, you know, says that, says that, you know, Donald Trump's
[1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:13.760]  a good president or something.
[1:16:13.760 --> 1:16:17.640]  It's anonymous source, he's in the meeting, he's just giving him secrets about al-Qaeda
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:18.640]  and ISIS in Syria.
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:21.920]  First off, we've been working with the Russians for four or five years, three years intensely
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:23.480]  to take out ISIS and al-Qaeda.
[1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:24.480]  That's on the news.
[1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:25.920]  Secondarily, Trump's destroying them.
[1:16:25.920 --> 1:16:28.920]  It's Obama and Hillary that helped empower them and put them in charge.
[1:16:28.920 --> 1:16:29.920]  Trump's cleaning that up.
[1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:33.840]  So, the claim that he's helping ISIS and al-Qaeda is just horsemen or everybody does that.
[1:16:33.840 --> 1:16:36.440]  He's the one that exposed them selling the oil, selling the organs.
[1:16:36.440 --> 1:16:37.960]  Roger's about to break this down.
[1:16:37.960 --> 1:16:42.760]  So, I just had the instinct, I said there's only three Americans in the room and they're
[1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:46.160]  saying, you know, we won't say who else was in the room except for the two Russians.
[1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:48.480]  There's five people in the room, including the president.
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:49.720]  Who has the history of doing it?
[1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:53.000]  We've been saying, right, McMaster is even worse than the motive, who has the motive.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  He's about to be removed.
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.400]  McMaster's about to be removed.
[1:16:55.400 --> 1:16:59.520]  So now he's the savior from his own leak to the Washington Post that's incredibly corrupt
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:02.400]  with Jeff Bezos and run by Deep State.
[1:17:02.400 --> 1:17:07.680]  He comes out, he then says, oh, the president didn't do this, I was there, it's made up.
[1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:10.560]  This is perfect to make him look into the president, but I think Trump will see through
[1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:11.560]  it.
[1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:12.680]  That's a high level, folks.
[1:17:12.680 --> 1:17:14.400]  They said, that's the thinking right now.
[1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:16.880]  Then I met Roger about an hour ago for dinner.
[1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:19.640]  He said, I'm on a phone with the New York Times, other sources.
[1:17:19.640 --> 1:17:23.600]  He went and made the calls, came back and said, that is what the thinking is right now.
[1:17:23.600 --> 1:17:27.160]  In fact, they know where the leak came from as an agency.
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:28.160]  So we've honed it down.
[1:17:28.160 --> 1:17:30.240]  Roger Stone's about to give you the exclusive.
[1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:34.920]  Did McMaster leak to the imposing as the savior so that Trump won't fire him?
[1:17:34.920 --> 1:17:35.920]  Roger Stone.
[1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:38.360]  Alex Jones is essentially correct.
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:42.560]  First of all, it's important the American people know that this is completely false.
[1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:47.960]  Donald Trump did not divulge classified information to the Russians.
[1:17:47.960 --> 1:17:53.880]  If he spoke about the efforts by ISIS to use personal computers as bombs and get them
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:56.960]  onto airplanes, there would nothing be inappropriate about that.
[1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:58.840]  You can read about that in the newspaper.
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:17:59.840]  Six months ago.
[1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:06.560]  We know that the leak came out of NSA and by process of elimination and looking at everyone
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:11.320]  who was in the room, there's only one man who has a motive.
[1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:17.840]  This is designed to make Mr. McMaster, General McMaster, indispensable and to stop the effort
[1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:23.520]  to remove him from his current job, kick him over to the Pentagon and give him the fourth
[1:18:23.520 --> 1:18:24.520]  star.
[1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:29.160]  Interesting enough, the military types don't want him at the Pentagon.
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:33.960]  I think the president in his wisdom will see through this and it's time to send Mr.
[1:18:33.960 --> 1:18:36.760]  McMaster, General McMaster back in.
[1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:37.760]  All right.
[1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:38.760]  And that's just part of it.
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:41.400]  We should recap here, Roger, and then come back to one more segment than Dr. Gribbs coming
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:44.160]  in here about what happened.
[1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:47.520]  This laptop with bombs inside of it, that was already in the news, this is totally made
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:48.520]  up.
[1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:50.520]  For me, it's just crazy that they would be this brazen.
[1:18:50.520 --> 1:18:55.000]  Well, but again, this couldn't have been possible if there wasn't a leak from the room.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:59.040]  The president cannot get confidentiality out of his own government.
[1:18:59.040 --> 1:19:01.640]  He had the authority to tell the Russians this.
[1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:05.160]  He didn't divulge anything harmful to the United States.
[1:19:05.160 --> 1:19:09.560]  He is trying to foster a better relationship with the Russians, which is what peace is
[1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:10.560]  about.
[1:19:10.560 --> 1:19:14.960]  The left is supposed to believe in peace, but actually they're the ones who believe in war.
[1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:21.560]  And because people that the president has chosen are disserving him, the focus is completely
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:22.560]  wrong.
[1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:24.200]  The focus should not be on what the president did.
[1:19:24.200 --> 1:19:29.080]  The focus should be on who leaked this so they could be fired and prosecuted.
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:30.080]  That's right.
[1:19:30.080 --> 1:19:33.320]  Major, I want to come back and talk about the next shoes to drop, the new attacks they've
[1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:34.320]  got planned.
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:39.280]  I think we defeat them straight ahead, but they're all over the news saying, end America,
[1:19:39.280 --> 1:19:43.080]  join with Canada, join the world government, George Washington's bad, New Yorker magazine
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:44.080]  saying this now.
[1:19:44.080 --> 1:19:45.920]  These people literally hate America.
[1:19:45.920 --> 1:19:49.960]  They know we love America, so they use all this Trump's anti-America, hoping we get on
[1:19:49.960 --> 1:19:50.960]  some bandwagon.
[1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:55.560]  As they try to organize a coup against the president, it shows how desperate they are.
[1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:57.680]  We'll be right back and we'll take your phone calls as well.
[1:19:57.680 --> 1:19:58.680]  Stay with us.
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:01.160]  Think about this.
[1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:05.200]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated
[1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:10.360]  with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines,
[1:20:10.360 --> 1:20:13.360]  and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:18.120]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.
[1:20:18.120 --> 1:20:21.680]  Protect your family's water supply with a trusted Big Berkey water filter.
[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:27.480]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show Big Berkey water filters remove chloramines, pharmaceuticals,

[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:40.520]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last three years at less than
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:41.920]  two cents per gallon.
[1:20:41.920 --> 1:20:45.720]  Big Berkey, the one powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.

[1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:04.760]  in stock at m4store.com.
[1:21:04.760 --> 1:21:07.520]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:09.600]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[1:21:09.600 --> 1:21:13.800]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:14.800]  Super Blue.
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:16.640]  Research across the board is clear.
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:18.000]  In fact, it's certified.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:21.880]  When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream, and even contribute to blood
[1:21:21.880 --> 1:21:22.880]  clots and heart attacks.
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:27.600]  That's why the Last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health
[1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:30.120]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:34.280]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen
[1:21:34.280 --> 1:21:36.840]  iodine, instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:41.440]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used its biblical times to help wipe out bad
[1:21:41.440 --> 1:21:43.600]  bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[1:21:43.600 --> 1:21:48.000]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue, chosen by our dental experts, include xylitol,
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:51.080]  peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver, and more.

[1:22:04.560 --> 1:22:08.480]  I was making great progress on building my savings, but then I got hit with an unexpected
[1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:09.640]  car repair bill.
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:14.000]  Keeping a close eye on my credit score allowed me to buy my first house, but an unexpected
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.920]  medical emergency sent me back.
[1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:18.160]  When the unexpected happened, Avant was there to help.

[1:22:58.480 --> 1:23:02.240]  Are you putting your money into an IRA, pension, or 401K?
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:07.480]  Then I hope you're prepared to lose 30, 40, 50% or more of your retirement savings because
[1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:10.200]  it's not a question of if the market crashes again.
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:13.120]  It's a question of when it's going to happen.
[1:23:13.120 --> 1:23:16.960]  Did you know there is a way you can protect and grow your wealth safely and predictably
[1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:18.360]  every single year?
[1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:22.360]  The people using this approach didn't lose a penny when the market crashed in 2000 or
[1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:25.680]  2008, and they won't lose a penny in the next crash.
[1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:30.280]  In fact, their money will continue to grow safely year in and year out, even when stocks,
[1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:32.440]  real estate and other investments tumble.

[1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:17.240]  You look like an angel, walk like an angel, talk like an angel, but I got one.
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:25.080]  You're the devil in disguise, oh yes you are, devil in disguise.
[1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:31.600]  You know, they have that line in the Hobbit where he says, or this is the Lord of the
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:37.160]  Rings, he says you look foul but you feel fair, whereas he looks fair but feels foul.
[1:24:37.160 --> 1:24:42.160]  You got to worry about people that don't say they got villain in them, but say they're
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.880]  these little angels.
[1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:48.000]  They walk like an angel, they talk like an angel, but I got wise.
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:52.440]  They're devils in disguise, Chuck E. Schumer, Obama, they're all arrogant, they're all
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:57.160]  decided to wage war against the president, America, they hate this country, enclosing
[1:24:57.160 --> 1:24:58.800]  Roger Schumer before Dr. Grip comes in.
[1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:02.720]  Thanks for coming to town, it's been amazing, I know you're going back tonight.
[1:25:02.720 --> 1:25:03.760]  How do we defeat this?
[1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:05.480]  How do we save this president?
[1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:10.720]  He's not going to be perfect, and if we abandon him, then the globalists could take him down
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:11.720]  even easier.
[1:25:11.720 --> 1:25:14.200]  So, for me, it's a no-brainer.
[1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:18.000]  This guy's under attack because he's so real, and if we're idiots and don't back him to
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:21.480]  the hill, then we deserve what we get.
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:24.760]  This is a question of the president finding the levers of power.
[1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:31.160]  He has the power to control the leaks, he has the power to change the direction of the
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:36.520]  federal government, he has the power to change the direction of the federal judiciary.
[1:25:36.520 --> 1:25:38.720]  But they're in mass mutiny.
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:41.840]  But it's just a question of him finding the levers of power.
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:49.120]  Unfortunately, he has chosen a White House staff that doesn't have a clue, not a clue.
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:56.720]  Until he can get control of his own government and oust the Obama holdover appointees who
[1:25:56.720 --> 1:25:58.280]  are leaking like a sin.
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:02.280]  And isn't that paradoxical, though, he's doing a great job on his policies, but then
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:04.520]  he's doing horrible and who he brought in, why?
[1:26:04.520 --> 1:26:09.120]  The people who are in charge of carrying out those policies essentially refuse to do so,
[1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:12.520]  because they were appointed by Barack Obama.
[1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:19.480]  Because no one in the Trump entourage knew that you had to have a plan in place immediately
[1:26:19.480 --> 1:26:23.520]  to position and place the assistant secretaries.
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:28.800]  Now, you couldn't expect Trump to know this, he is not a veteran Washington politician.
[1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:30.800]  Well, I started it, I know that.
[1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:33.920]  It's a shame he didn't choose a chief of staff who knew it.
[1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:35.680]  Because this is the log jam.
[1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:40.920]  This is why we're having the leaks, because we don't have a Trump administration.
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:42.720]  We still have the Obama administration.
[1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:45.920]  We need to start prosecuting those deputy secretaries.
[1:26:45.920 --> 1:26:50.040]  Well, what we really need to do, if we're going to prosecute, is we want to send a signal
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:51.040]  to the base.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:53.120]  If you want to send a signal to the American people.
[1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:54.120]  Lock her up.
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:55.120]  Yes, absolutely.
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:59.960]  They need to impanel a grand jury and bring Bill and Hillary and Chelsea.
[1:26:59.960 --> 1:27:06.320]  If anybody ever needed to go to prison from politics, it's that sickening, ugly, twisted,
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:08.640]  arrogant, entitled couple.
[1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:15.440]  Indeed, and you know, if you go to ChargeHillaryClinton.com, if you want to sign the petition that we're
[1:27:15.440 --> 1:27:20.440]  going to send to the president, telling him to order the attorney general to impanel this
[1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:25.840]  grand jury and do what the president pledged to do in the campaign.
[1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:28.600]  By the way, that is a good looking pinstripe suit.
[1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:29.600]  Well, thank you very much.
[1:27:29.600 --> 1:27:32.400]  And of course, you pointed out, I should have for them, the media has been saying you dress
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:33.400]  like the Riddler.
[1:27:33.400 --> 1:27:35.640]  He has patches on little question marks.
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:36.640]  That's the Joker actually.
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:38.760]  Exactly, I just like the Joker, not the Riddler.
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:39.960]  How insulting.
[1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:40.960]  That's really insulting.
[1:27:40.960 --> 1:27:45.520]  Well, let's just be honest, what is my style kind of German farm hand?
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:47.920]  This is just some guy going to Baptist Church on Sunday.
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:49.120]  This is up here, Austin.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:51.000]  You got the Austin, Texas thing going on.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.800]  Well, I mean, I got a 20 inch neck.
[1:27:52.800 --> 1:27:53.800]  So you got a big neck too.
[1:27:53.800 --> 1:27:56.480]  I just, it's hard to get the, you know, get the tire on the neck.
[1:27:56.480 --> 1:27:59.240]  You know what works for me to not necessarily work for you.
[1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:01.880]  If you, if you dress like this, you'd look ridiculous.
[1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:03.160]  That's Joker purple though.
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:04.160]  It is.
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:05.160]  That's why I wore it.
[1:28:05.160 --> 1:28:08.080]  I'm guessing, I know you've read the article, I said you're the Riddler.
[1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:17.720]  You know, when I was at the Nixon library commencement dinner, I sat next to Cesar Romero
[1:28:17.720 --> 1:28:19.240]  and I couldn't think of anything to say.
[1:28:19.240 --> 1:28:23.920]  So I said to him, you know, Mr. Romero, you were the greatest Joker of all time.
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:27.280]  I mean, Jack Nicholson, he was terrible.
[1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:30.960]  These other guys, they couldn't hold a candle to you and he said, you know, son, people
[1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:33.320]  tell me that every single day.
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:37.960]  He was a great man, Cesar Romero, a conservative Republican, a true believing patriot and one
[1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:40.400]  of the biggest movie stars of the 1930s.
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:41.400]  Absolutely.
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:42.400]  All right.
[1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:44.440]  I'm going to come back and get into the waterfront here.
[1:28:44.440 --> 1:28:50.280]  It's just, for me, I got really angry earlier than I got in a good mood to go that way.
[1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:54.880]  Just it's all over the news that he talked about the laptop bombs that was all over the
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:55.880]  news.
[1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:56.880]  He's the president.
[1:28:56.880 --> 1:28:57.880]  He's allowed to do that.
[1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:00.280]  He released it two months ago when he was allowed to and they were pointing out, oh, you got
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:04.400]  this Navy SEAL killed to this horrible traitor, no, we got intel on their next plans, on their
[1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:05.760]  bomb-making factories.
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:07.600]  And now it's been confirmed that they've been trying to do that.
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:11.400]  It's in ISIS training videos, it's in ISIS training videos, it's in hundreds of news
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:12.400]  articles.
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:14.200]  He talks about it with the Russians and he's a traitor.
[1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:20.640]  The Washington Post should get in big trouble with some cultural agency, you know, they
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.560]  should pay for what they've done.
[1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:23.560]  There he is.
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:24.560]  Cesar Romero.
[1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:25.720]  I mean, seriously, it's just the arrogance.
[1:29:25.720 --> 1:29:31.160]  Well, but in this particular case, the president was already angry at the Washington Post.
[1:29:31.160 --> 1:29:34.520]  Now I guarantee you, he is furious.
[1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:37.520]  They were the worst in the election in terms of discussion.
[1:29:37.520 --> 1:29:40.400]  The Washington Post, I don't mean to be gross, but they're like monkeys at the zoo that just
[1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:41.400]  grab stuff and throw it.
[1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:43.840]  I mean, they are, they are just making stuff up.
[1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:47.840]  RobsterStone, StoneCulture.com, Alex Jones, then FullWars.com, stay with us.
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:52.160]  I got a PJW piece coming up at the start of this segment.
[1:29:52.160 --> 1:29:53.160]  Stay with us.
[1:29:53.160 --> 1:30:00.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:00.320 --> 1:30:04.120]  Over the weekend, President Donald Trump has called on God to bless and empower our country
[1:30:04.120 --> 1:30:05.120]  and our people.
[1:30:05.120 --> 1:30:06.120]  And reaffirmed our faith.
[1:30:06.120 --> 1:30:09.160]  In America, we don't worship government, we worship God.
[1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:15.720]  And it's why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation under God, every time we say the
[1:30:15.720 --> 1:30:17.240]  pledge of allegiance.
[1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:19.080]  Which God exactly has he invoked?
[1:30:19.080 --> 1:30:21.000]  Was it the God of Hillary Clinton?
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:23.280]  Which people, God bless us.
[1:30:23.280 --> 1:30:25.800]  Or was it the God of Barack Hussein Obama?
[1:30:25.800 --> 1:30:28.200]  God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.
[1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:32.880]  No, President Trump has called on the one true God of the universe, whose name is above
[1:30:32.880 --> 1:30:33.880]  every name.
[1:30:33.880 --> 1:30:35.160]  Champions for Christ.
[1:30:35.160 --> 1:30:39.760]  He testified to the greatest pieces of literature in the history of mankind because of the power
[1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:42.000]  contained within the words of this book.
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:47.160]  You are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope, and love.
[1:30:47.160 --> 1:30:51.040]  Even the most remote areas of India, and especially Africa, have heard of him.
[1:30:51.040 --> 1:30:56.080]  Jesus Christ has been preached in and is believed on in all nations of the world.
[1:30:56.080 --> 1:30:58.400]  Our God is not like their God.
[1:30:58.400 --> 1:30:59.880]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[1:30:59.880 --> 1:31:03.240]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:07.080]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:10.760]  You've all heard the shocking statistics, despite spending trillions of dollars in health
[1:31:10.760 --> 1:31:16.360]  care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer,
[1:31:16.360 --> 1:31:19.440]  heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:22.720]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:25.840]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[1:31:25.840 --> 1:31:28.680]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your
[1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:33.000]  vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional

[1:31:51.040 --> 1:31:52.880]  Your body will be very grateful.
[1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:56.040]  On the web at InfoWarsTeam.com.
[1:31:56.040 --> 1:32:00.040]  That's InfoWarsTeam.com.
[1:32:00.040 --> 1:32:04.520]  InfoWars has partnered with Defender Body Armor to bring you a new state-of-the-art line of
[1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:08.000]  advanced, highly-tested body armor from InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:12.480]  Defender Body Armor is certified to protect against all handgun rounds and even armor-piercing
[1:32:12.480 --> 1:32:14.600]  FN 5.7 pistol rounds.
[1:32:14.600 --> 1:32:19.720]  The secret to Defender Body Armor is its proprietary processing technology that disperses more
[1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:24.200]  kinetic energy at a rate higher than any other traditional body armor, using one of the strongest
[1:32:24.200 --> 1:32:29.400]  synthetic materials ever created, called ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene.
[1:32:29.400 --> 1:32:32.320]  Defender Armor is also super compact and lightweight.
[1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:36.360]  There's a reason the Department of Defense chose Defender to manufacture their new line
[1:32:36.360 --> 1:32:38.280]  of advanced, lightweight armor.
[1:32:38.280 --> 1:32:39.280]  It works.
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:42.920]  Defender Body Armor is made right here in America and has received the highest-level
[1:32:42.920 --> 1:32:47.800]  ballistic resistance certification from an authorized NIJ Ballistic Laboratory.
[1:32:47.800 --> 1:32:52.560]  Defender Body Armor is now available through InfoWarsStore.com, so you can defend yourself,
[1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:57.120]  your family, and finance the Info War against the globalist all at the same time.
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:22.600]  A total 361.
[1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:29.760]  You want to stop tyranny, well so does he, live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex
[1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:30.760]  Jones.
[1:33:30.760 --> 1:33:39.400]  Take me through the center wheels, look at these courageous anti-fascists, what's his
[1:33:39.400 --> 1:33:40.400]  sign saying?
[1:33:40.400 --> 1:33:45.720]  Must be something horrible right, a swastika, gas the Jews, Heil Hitler, the right to openly
[1:33:45.720 --> 1:33:47.880]  discuss ideas must be defended.
[1:33:47.880 --> 1:33:53.480]  Alright, turns out you guys are behaving like actual Nazis, little tip fellas, the good
[1:33:53.480 --> 1:33:57.040]  guys don't normally wear black masks covering their faces.
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:03.640]  Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them?
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:05.640]  I don't, sir.
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:07.640]  Hands.
[1:34:07.640 --> 1:34:14.640]  Are we the baddies?
[1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:40.360]  Yeah, little history lesson love, those Nazis that you hate so much, funny coincidence
[1:34:40.360 --> 1:34:45.000]  because it turns out they were into using intimidation to shut down free speech.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:49.040]  You know, exactly like you're doing to this guy.
[1:34:49.040 --> 1:34:53.480]  You're a white mil!!!
[1:34:53.480 --> 1:35:08.920]  We try to intimidate people out of speaking based on their skin colour because we're
[1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:20.680]  racists I don't care what you believe I'm just gonna keep repeating the word
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:24.280]  Nazi over and over again because I'm functionally retarded and don't have
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:31.120]  an actual argument everyone just cover him then we won't have to collectively
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:37.000]  activate our six brain cells to have an actual discussion where the hell did
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:49.320]  Jeremy Corbyn come from you're not welcome here we're tolerant
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:55.160]  progressives socially conscious citizens and are provoked by the loathsome
[1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:59.160]  presence of a non-mutual fair sheep I mean we literally employed the tactics of
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:04.200]  actual fascists but we're so dumb that if we feign enough righteous indignation
[1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:10.040]  we can delude ourselves into thinking we have the moral high ground
[1:36:34.200 --> 1:36:51.400]  yeah if that actually happened the guy with the sign would be the only person
[1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:59.440]  left on the frigging street because you're the actual Nazis are we the baddies
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.240]  now if you're a radio listener and we'll put the YouTube video up on screen so I
[1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:07.200]  can tell radio listeners how they can find it and you just heard that it's
[1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:11.200]  powerful but not as powerful as actually seeing it you've got a polite nice man
[1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:14.600]  standing on a street in London close to Downing Street where people like to
[1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:22.000]  protest holding up a sign saying that we should support the right of free speech
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:28.280]  and people come over and actually start assaulting him screaming Nazi scum no we
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:31.560]  don't allow free speech and I've been close to 10 Downing Street also though
[1:37:31.560 --> 1:37:38.520]  by Parliament the left doesn't let you protest or demonstrate or even hold up
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:41.800]  newspaper articles they run things they're the God they're the boss and
[1:37:41.800 --> 1:37:46.040]  now they're not the left these are like brainwashed people that are delusional
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:50.600]  and believe they're the savior they're the good guys and then at the end they
[1:37:50.600 --> 1:37:53.720]  actually start assaulting him and grab his sign away and the police are all
[1:37:53.720 --> 1:37:59.840]  around and allow it and I have stacks of news articles where Muslims in the UK
[1:37:59.840 --> 1:38:03.960]  sexually assault women and the police covered it up some cases little girls
[1:38:03.960 --> 1:38:07.560]  by the thousands per town it's come out and then they just say none of this is
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:10.920]  happening it doesn't exist Muslims never rape anybody Muslims never kill
[1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:14.320]  anybody Muslims never run over anybody they never shoot anybody and it's so
[1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:19.440]  frustrating that this is the group we're not supposed to talk about now Dr. Group
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:25.160]  my good buddy one of the top formulators at m4slive.com is with us to
[1:38:25.160 --> 1:38:28.720]  announce the big launch of an amazing new product today that will also
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:32.360]  interspersed with the news here and how much heavy metals there are how many
[1:38:32.360 --> 1:38:36.680]  toxins out there and things that are known to help detoxify the body but we're
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:39.400]  going to cover the waterfront here politically what's happening with Trump
[1:38:39.400 --> 1:38:45.280]  the new product is Z Shield toxic metal and chemical support defense and we're
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:49.840]  going to talk about what shillage he does what the concentrated zeolites do
[1:38:49.840 --> 1:38:53.800]  what some of these other herbs and compounds do and acids that are in it
[1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:59.200]  along with it as we can fight back and also support the operation but fight
[1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:02.680]  back in your own life he's got a whole stack of articles about the toxicity and
[1:39:02.680 --> 1:39:04.720]  what's happening we're going to be discussing that for a few minutes here
[1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:11.320]  and then plunging back into news but then I look at stories here we could have
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:18.000]  been Canada why the American Revolution might have been a bad idea and so the
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:21.080]  people claiming Trump's an enemy Patriots an enemy people that want
[1:39:21.080 --> 1:39:24.560]  sovereignty or enemies we're the foreign agents because we want a country when
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:28.040]  they're the foreign globalist agents that are dissolving the nation states as
[1:39:28.040 --> 1:39:31.240]  we know it and now you have this whole fake controversy if you just join us
[1:39:31.240 --> 1:39:36.160]  with Trump where the news is still going along like is it real isn't it real
[1:39:36.160 --> 1:39:42.080]  McMaster says it's not real they had the Yemen raid back on the 29th of January
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:49.600]  this year five months ago and they got the the bomb maker that data they're
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:55.560]  trying to disguise bombs and batteries of laptops plastic explosives and then
[1:39:55.560 --> 1:39:58.840]  you you tell the public that so they know about the threat the president can
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:03.080]  declassify what he wants that was months ago it came out in April and in
[1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:09.280]  March they got the intel in in in late January and then they just lie and say
[1:40:09.280 --> 1:40:13.360]  he's with the Russians he gave him secret documents because he just discussed
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:18.000]  the threat with him which has been all over the news we've reached a new level
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:23.520]  doctor group what do you make of all this this is lies lies lies and more
[1:40:23.520 --> 1:40:29.840]  lies and it's it seems like you know right now we we've talked like years
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:34.120]  ago about all the attacks and what I look at is the attacks on health care the
[1:40:34.120 --> 1:40:39.240]  attacks on the American public the attacks on the earth the addition of
[1:40:39.240 --> 1:40:43.640]  all the chemicals that are being sprayed on us that are in the food or in the
[1:40:43.640 --> 1:40:48.080]  water that are really to me when I look at all the problems that we're dealing
[1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:53.920]  with out there and then you look at the hardcore left Democratic Party right now
[1:40:53.920 --> 1:40:58.720]  I would have never imagined that people could have be it could be so evil in
[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:04.600]  their attack on the president of the United States I mean the way I look at
[1:41:04.600 --> 1:41:10.080]  it is we free speech is the only way that we get things done it's we the
[1:41:10.080 --> 1:41:14.520]  people think about the organic movement think about the GMO movement think about
[1:41:14.520 --> 1:41:18.480]  getting fluoride out of the water I mean in Europe half of this stuff is banned
[1:41:18.480 --> 1:41:26.440]  already over here in the United States we have 84,000 unregulated cancer
[1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:33.040]  endocrine disrupting IQ disrupting chemicals to where children now in
[1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:39.280]  certain cities where the pollution is very high on tests they're they're put
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:42.520]  up against another eight-year-old to draw stick figures and they can't even
[1:41:42.520 --> 1:41:47.080]  draw a stick figure but they are plunging cancer is exploding messed up
[1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:50.400]  and the same people selling us this is gonna say everything's fine everything's
[1:41:50.400 --> 1:41:55.360]  wonderful everything's good no it's not no it's not studies out that unvaccinated
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:59.080]  children are way healthier than vaccinated so so now you can type in
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:03.280]  Google fluoride and go to and go to the news section you're gonna find news
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:06.960]  articles on the dangers of fluoride you can go and type in BPA you can type
[1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:10.720]  endocrine disrupting chemicals you can type in that's why they're scared of
[1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:14.680]  repressed because we are defeating the globalist we're exposing their entire
[1:42:14.680 --> 1:42:19.280]  medical tourney program their finance program the rigged global markets they
[1:42:19.280 --> 1:42:23.320]  are so upset that humanity is waking up right now dr. group and that's why they
[1:42:23.320 --> 1:42:26.800]  want the censorship right that's why they want the censorship that's why they
[1:42:26.800 --> 1:42:32.400]  want they want to keep the truth from you when the truth is what's going to
[1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:37.600]  set you free which is what I've been saying and how simple it really is when
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:43.160]  you look at the root cause of what we're dealing with I mean you have nine out of
[1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:47.760]  ten people Alex and even one out of two chilled black children now will
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:52.760]  develop diabetes one out of three children white will develop diabetes you
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:57.800]  have all of these things linked to toxic chemicals in the air food and water and
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:03.400]  nothing is being done about now we're the the media when we came out which is
[1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:08.120]  sold out of more comes in my cozy x the anti-fungal probiotic and basically shut
[1:43:08.120 --> 1:43:12.080]  that down like oh my god they say there's this fungus epidemic then they have
[1:43:12.080 --> 1:43:15.360]  the solution yeah like there's bad water we sell high-quality water filters yes
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:18.400]  that's what we do it's called free market we sell what's good there's a
[1:43:18.400 --> 1:43:22.480]  market for it to fund our operation to promote more freedom absolutely wow what
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:27.480]  rocket scientists at the MSM are saying that we're promoting probiotics and
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:30.800]  things that are well documented they're saying we're total cooks but it's well
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:34.600]  known that shilligy it's well known that zeolites and what you have in the new
[1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:40.400]  product from m4slife.com z-shield is good to pull garbage out of the body but
[1:43:40.400 --> 1:43:45.520]  they just sit there and make this huge joke out of it as our support just goes
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:49.480]  up and up and up and up and we totally change the paradigm model of people
[1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:53.280]  funding their own media systems not from outside sponsors they can control them
[1:43:53.280 --> 1:43:57.920]  but with direct sales you know like selling a Trump pinch shirt for 495 that
[1:43:57.920 --> 1:44:01.960]  cost I want to promote free speech and we sold thousands of those yesterday they
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:06.400]  can't stand the fact that we're out here waking people up we're out here taking
[1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:10.880]  action and that we're absolutely you know unapologetic about what we're doing
[1:44:10.880 --> 1:44:15.800]  so they play these games like there aren't any problems you shouldn't filter
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:20.880]  your water you should eat GMO you should eat trans fats and I don't claim to be
[1:44:20.880 --> 1:44:25.120]  on the high horse here you know about stuff I don't claim to have all the
[1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:27.600]  answers I don't claim to be the most healthy person around I'm trying to be
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:30.120]  healthier and I've gotten healthier but let's expand on that we're coming out
[1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:33.920]  soon with a big organic line of shampoo and other personal care products that's
[1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:37.400]  a big national brand in Whole Foods one of the biggest who are patriots who are
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:41.360]  letting us private label it now think about this are they gonna call it snake
[1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:48.080]  shampoo or snake sunscreen or snake body wash or snake mouthwash or come out
[1:44:48.080 --> 1:44:52.120]  with a 10 to 1 mouthwash that is a national brand that's organic that
[1:44:52.120 --> 1:44:56.720]  we're able to private label that is the same as a price of normal normal normal
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:03.840]  mouthwash it's 10 to 1 concentrate and it's the same price that's 10 times
[1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:08.040]  cheaper than the competitor just because we cut out all the scams they'll
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:12.600]  probably call it snake wash I'm even thinking of calling the brand snake
[1:45:12.600 --> 1:45:17.480]  brand because next it'll be he sells snake water filters he sells snake shirts
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:23.040]  he sells snake videos about the dangers of GMO he sells he has a show that
[1:45:23.040 --> 1:45:26.840]  points out they're lying about Trump and showing the actual news articles where
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:31.240]  they reported the laptop bombs two three months ago no that's we're not snakes
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.160]  we're the opposite of the snakes the mainstream media are the snakes so let's
[1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:38.520]  get it whenever when I have you whenever plug and you're the expert on this
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:42.680]  you developed this over several years z shield it's concentrated tell us what it
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:46.680]  does so that's the reason why more and more people are starting to go online
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:51.800]  and starting to listen to you Alex because we have hundreds of thousands of
[1:45:51.800 --> 1:45:55.680]  reviews most of them we can't even post online because people getting better
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.200]  people are waking up when you look at the amount of chlorine that people ingest
[1:46:00.200 --> 1:46:06.040]  I mean the fluoride the chlorine fish the calcified pineal glands the poly
[1:46:06.040 --> 1:46:11.840]  brominated compounds that are everywhere I'm excited about z shield I'm excited
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:15.680]  about all the products because I know that our main goal is to help people and
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:22.600]  the reason why I chose the ingredients in z shield was designed not only to bond
[1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:28.680]  to the harmful chemicals that we're exposed to it's a fact that we know the
[1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:32.400]  cause of disease is that too many chemicals are coming into our body
[1:46:32.400 --> 1:46:36.200]  every single day and not enough chemicals are getting out of our body
[1:46:36.200 --> 1:46:40.640]  every single day why is that our urinate we're not urinating enough we're not
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:44.400]  defecating enough we're not sweating enough and we're not respirating enough
[1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:48.960]  and women's menstrual cycles are messed up those are our natural ways that we
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:54.840]  eliminate chemicals and toxins I put the chelageed in there which is a which is
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:47:00.400]  a black almost decomposed humic-fulvic acid from the Himalayas where you have
[1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:06.200]  to actually go up into the mountains and harvest that by hand all of these
[1:47:06.200 --> 1:47:09.600]  ingredients are chosen from different areas of the world the zeolites which
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:14.720]  have been known we actually have a unique process of sterilizing zeolites
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:18.840]  before we put them in there and the zeolites are known to capture some of
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:26.560]  these compounds these chemicals that are being found especially there's over 200
[1:47:26.560 --> 1:47:31.880]  of these chemicals found in umbilical cord blood from pregnant women so we
[1:47:31.880 --> 1:47:34.960]  know for a fact that we are being bombarded with all these chemicals so
[1:47:34.960 --> 1:47:39.160]  what I wanted to do with the Z-Shield was put together things like the Lovage
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:44.240]  root or the Lovage which is designed to take care of a different spectrum of
[1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:48.440]  chemicals in the body then we put the cleavers in there the cleavers is
[1:47:48.440 --> 1:47:52.560]  designed to push and to support the lymphatic system and by the way there's
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:55.960]  no reviews on this because it just came out today yeah you've taken a lot of
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:47:59.360]  known compounds you're explaining this to me a year ago when you're trying to
[1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:03.560]  develop this and concentrated them together totally organic tested
[1:48:03.560 --> 1:48:07.400]  amazingly clean highest quality and I forgot I should have said this last
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:13.200]  hour 25% off out of the gates we want people to have this now how often do
[1:48:13.200 --> 1:48:16.880]  you take it before you get back on the other stuff that's in it well I mean I
[1:48:16.880 --> 1:48:20.440]  personally with all the research that we've done it would take it every other
[1:48:20.440 --> 1:48:25.440]  day or every day and we have so many people that call in and say listen you
[1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:28.480]  and Alex talk about fluoride you talk about chlorine you talk about endocrine
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:32.400]  disrupting chemicals you talk about the plastic residue you talk about all of
[1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:36.600]  the heavy metals that were exposed to an x2 does a lot to block that going into
[1:48:36.600 --> 1:48:41.080]  certain glands but not everything what does this do and that's why we wanted to
[1:48:41.080 --> 1:48:45.720]  develop something that was more targeted that you know listen you you can't live
[1:48:45.720 --> 1:48:49.720]  in a bubble anymore I mean we we we're going to be breathing the air we're
[1:48:49.720 --> 1:48:54.280]  going to be eating the food I mean yes we want you to eat organic yes that's
[1:48:54.280 --> 1:48:58.160]  why we've been big proponents of detoxification and it's good to do
[1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:02.280]  detoxification on top of it but clean water better food so so what is the
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:05.960]  chelogy what does the zeolites what are the other compounds on a revenue that
[1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:09.760]  are in here what do they do all of the compounds are designed to support
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:13.640]  deliver detoxification which is the milk thistle in there that's racist the
[1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:18.920]  the cleavers in there which is designed for the lymphatic system so you can push
[1:49:18.920 --> 1:49:23.480]  this out and all the other herbs like the cilantro and the fulvic and humic
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:27.680]  blend which are designed to grab and hold on to different types of chemical
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:31.480]  compounds in the blood I mean look they had an article in Houston that just came
[1:49:31.480 --> 1:49:36.800]  out about the hexavalent chromium in the water supplies all over the United
[1:49:36.800 --> 1:49:43.000]  States it's a fact that we know that we are bombarded with toxic chemicals
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.880]  every single day last time you were here you should a bunch of mainstream news
[1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:49.560]  articles about how mold and fungus is mutating and killing people all over the
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:54.120]  country I know three people who have had family members two of them are children
[1:49:54.120 --> 1:49:59.200]  who got brain tumors where fungus just starts growing in the brain it's a tiny
[1:49:59.200 --> 1:50:04.720]  you see it's like the tiny gift of our lord Obama oh lord me I'm sorry no it's
[1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:08.480]  the tiny exposure I mean some of these things in parts per billion these
[1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:12.400]  pesticide residues like glyphos but how is fungus suddenly growing in the brain
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:19.240]  I don't know exactly how it's how and why it's changing is all the GMOs mutating
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:22.840]  or it's it's got to be this just but the media said there's no fun this problem
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:27.040]  there's no allergy we were ridiculed all we made it all up yeah we made it all
[1:50:27.040 --> 1:50:29.720]  hundreds of articles admitting that the funders are killing people everywhere
[1:50:29.720 --> 1:50:33.800]  right and just last week just like the last week now it's coming out in the
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:37.720]  mainstream news that there's the Candida auris fungus which we talked about a
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:43.480]  month ago when we broke it here on the on the Info Wars show is now the big
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:48.160]  next Zika threat to the United States into the world and there's absolutely no
[1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:51.360]  pharmacy most the bats have died from the funds and as a matter of fact look
[1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:54.280]  at all the people on pharmaceutical drugs which contain massive amounts of
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:56.920]  chemicals that they're poisoning their body but what's why is the fund is
[1:50:56.920 --> 1:51:01.880]  getting so much more powerful because the conditions are there for society is
[1:51:01.880 --> 1:51:06.640]  only three missed meals away from chaos those times may be near think about it
[1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:10.520]  our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and
[1:51:10.520 --> 1:51:14.600]  North Korea social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting
[1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:18.280]  of stores and city shutdowns and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our
[1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:22.520]  power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack when
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:26.200]  the chaos from any one of these threats arises the government knows it can't
[1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:30.200]  provide during a widespread national emergency that's why you need your own

[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:22.600]  doing to Trump about their attempt to say he gave the Russian secret evidence
[1:54:22.600 --> 1:54:26.160]  for talking about what's been the news for almost three months about the laptop
[1:54:26.160 --> 1:54:30.000]  bombs that ISIS and al-Qaeda are trying to create and the intel we gathered on

[1:54:57.280 --> 1:55:01.160]  as interesting and we have our affiliates who are great stations all over the
[1:55:01.160 --> 1:55:04.520]  country that have advertising groups that have never called them calling up
[1:55:04.520 --> 1:55:08.840]  saying we want to advertise on these other shows we want Alex Jones off most
[1:55:08.840 --> 1:55:12.560]  our stations are actually expanding us because of that they understand how much
[1:55:12.560 --> 1:55:16.600]  this country is under attack but some stations are taking the money and that's
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:20.000]  fine this is America if you decide you want to do that with George Soros or the
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:23.880]  globalist then you've you know you've made your bed it's the listeners though
[1:55:23.880 --> 1:55:27.400]  who need to support us and spread the word on the local stations you're

[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:34.520]  send them a hundred bucks a month because it's it's it costs money to run

[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:41.520]  or they don't want drudge being out there either you know covering the fact that
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:45.680]  Trump was only covering what was already in the news they want to be just put
[1:56:45.680 --> 1:56:49.560]  lies out and not have anybody there to challenge them well we're challenging
[1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:54.160]  them you're challenging them we're doing all this together back to Dr. Group.
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:56:58.360]  Oh you're absolutely right on that I mean it's it's been a long challenge for
[1:56:58.360 --> 1:57:02.240]  years and years and it just comes back down to simplicity we just really want
[1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:05.800]  to help people that's been my whole mission and I've just identified all of
[1:57:05.800 --> 1:57:10.640]  the problems or the situations that people are dealing with it's very sad
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:15.800]  to it's sad and gratifying it's sad to know that how many people out there are
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:22.200]  suffering how bad the health care system really is right now around the world how
[1:57:22.200 --> 1:57:27.200]  the governmental officials and the people in charge don't want to address
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:31.120]  the root cause of the problem and we're pointing this out I mean negative but
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:38.200]  to fix it sign an executive order banning the 980 cancer causing chemicals
[1:57:38.200 --> 1:57:42.160]  that are out there sign an executive order banning aspartame to sign an
[1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:46.440]  executive order banning fluoride in the water I mean let's address the root
[1:57:46.440 --> 1:57:49.600]  instead they had to sign executive orders illegalized aspartame something
[1:57:49.600 --> 1:57:53.200]  Reagan did that was bad he also created the vaccine damage fund because he
[1:57:53.200 --> 1:57:56.200]  didn't know any better he was taking the flu shots it was brain damage as well
[1:57:56.200 --> 1:58:01.440]  that's another big topic that's been in the news lately I mean it's we need we
[1:58:01.440 --> 1:58:03.680]  the people by the way I'm gonna stop you there I'm gonna come back and cover
[1:58:03.680 --> 1:58:07.680]  this and take calls 800-25-9-9-2-3-1 let's pull it up since we mentioned it

[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:17.520]  coming out that vaccinated children are much more unhealthy and have lower IQs
[1:58:17.520 --> 1:58:21.120]  we're totally vindicated they finally did the human studies they finally did
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:23.880]  because they won't look at the animals I don't know if you heard about the
[1:58:23.880 --> 1:58:27.840]  Boston Herald study they came out and they basically said to hang and kill
[1:58:27.840 --> 1:58:32.280]  everybody that's a vaccine I didn't see that in fact Owen shroyer covered that
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:35.640]  let's like let's pull that up Boston Herald hang people that don't take
[1:58:35.640 --> 1:58:40.640]  vaccines say they're really getting pushy they're really getting pushy

[2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:08.360]  Coming to you from the former United States of America deep in the heart of
[2:00:08.360 --> 2:00:15.320]  Texas it's Alex Jones. I hear people talking about the way we have to live
[2:00:15.320 --> 2:00:23.120]  here in this country. Harping on wars we fight and griping about the way things
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:40.600]  are to be. I don't mind them switching sides. They believe in. When they're running down my country man they're walking on the fight side of me. Yeah they're walking.
[2:00:40.600 --> 2:01:00.600]  Yeah they're walking on the fight side of me. Running down a way of life. Running down a way of life by fighting men or dying people. Yeah if you don't love it leave it. If you don't love it leave it. Let this song I'm singing and be a warning to you.
[2:01:00.600 --> 2:01:10.520]  You're running down my country man you are. I want to cover this in a short segment come back take calls get more into the big study since they're printing them off for me. You're doing a search engine this
[2:01:10.520 --> 2:01:24.800]  study's unvaccinated children healthier than unvaccinated. Also the Boston Herald you mentioned saying hang people that don't take vaccines they keep saying if we don't take vaccines it makes them get sick. Well wait a minute. You took it. It should be protecting you. Plus they just had a bunch of
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:43.080]  illegals come in. That had a measles mumps rebella outbreaks and they say oh we're unvaccinated that's the problem. There's no end but here it is. Talking about walking on the fight inside of me. This is New Yorker magazine same globalist elite mouthpiece.
[2:01:43.080 --> 2:01:57.480]  That just came out two weeks ago and said there's a move to overthrow Trump in Congress and inside his own administration. It's an image of a minute man George Washington standing on top chains and skulls everywhere and that America basically rules a world of death.
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:12.520]  And it says we could have been Canada. Was the American Revolution such a good idea. This is globalism. The very people running down Trump saying he's a Russian agent with no proof are really the globalist agents the corporate agents that are trying to kill national sovereignty.
[2:02:12.520 --> 2:02:29.840]  Kit Daniels wrote a story about it. An info wars dot com. Globalist mad claims American Revolution was a mistake. Anti-Trump mag says America should have been more like Canada. Yeah I guess the British protectorate a British possession. So again you walk. Look you got free speech but they want to overthrow the country.
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:45.720]  Our rights. More and more they said they want to kill patriots. It's all over the news professors saying kill Trump and I'm at a certain point I'm like listen here. I had some guy last night. I'm down a hotel lobby wing to do a live feed with stone.
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:03:03.760]  We're eating dinner with my parents. We ducked out to do a live feed with Buckley and Harrison on Periscope and Facebook and I'm like 60 yards on a hallway by banquet halls. There's no one there. And I hear you're a trader and Trump's a trader.
[2:03:03.760 --> 2:03:20.840]  And I said well come here. Videos on info wars dot com. McMasters fingers is leaked in. Fake Washington Post Russian story. As soon as I get over there you know the guy didn't want to run his mouth anymore. He said well my grandfather fought the Nazis so see now I'm a Nazi.
[2:03:20.840 --> 2:03:34.600]  And so then he says there runs his mouth some more at me. He says well hey how's your wife. I've been married in three years. I'm remarried. My wife's doing great. My family's doing great. My kids are doing great. Fixed them all breakfast this morning. So the stuff you see in the media is fake news.
[2:03:34.600 --> 2:03:53.040]  It's all fake. None of it's even true ladies and gentlemen. So this is the world and the reality that we live in. Maybe I'll play that later if we have some time. But he wants to run his mouth that I'm a trader. And then when I try to get this face he tries to act like what's my problem. Kind of like that lady that told the one guy in New Orleans she wants to kill me.
[2:03:53.040 --> 2:04:16.040]  And he said how dare you. She said what's the big deal. I just want him dead. They are on their own world. Yeah it's the things that we deal with every single day but you know it's it takes a lot of determination a lot of focus and when you know in your heart that you're good and that you really want to help people and it really is all about people making the right decisions
[2:04:16.040 --> 2:04:30.380]  especially when it comes to their health. I mean as long as I mean you know and we fight every single day to get these chemicals and all this stuff taken out of the food and the water and the air but really it's make the right choices in your life.
[2:04:30.380 --> 2:04:59.380]  Eat organic food. Buy organic cosmetics. Stuff around your house. Avoid the fragrances. Don't smoke cigarettes. You're so racist. You are so racist. Reduce the amount of toxins coming into your body and look. No you're a crackpot. You're a crackpot. All you have to do. No no. Heavy metals are good. Heavy metals are good. Liar. Liar. Pants on fire. Get the mercury out of your teeth too. No just drink. Oh racism. Drink water and sweat. I mean. We'll be right back folks with your phone call. Stay with us. Just stop the right.
[2:04:59.380 --> 2:05:16.380]  Okay. Over the weekend President Donald Trump has called on God to bless and empower our country and our people and reaffirmed our faith. In America we don't worship government. We worship God. And it's why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation under God. Every time we say the pledge of allegiance.
[2:05:16.380 --> 2:05:27.380]  Which God exactly has he invoked? Was it the God of Hillary Clinton? Rich people. God bless us. Or was it the God of Barack St. Obama? God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.
[2:05:27.380 --> 2:05:34.380]  No President Trump has called on the one true God of the universe whose name is above every name. Champions for Christ.
[2:05:34.380 --> 2:05:41.380]  He testified to the greatest pieces of literature in the history of mankind because of the power contained within the words of this book.
[2:05:41.380 --> 2:05:46.380]  You are living witness of the gospel message of faith, hope and love.
[2:05:46.380 --> 2:05:59.380]  Even the most remote areas of India and especially Africa have heard of him. Jesus Christ has been preached in and is believed on in all nations of the world. Our God is not like their God. This has been Daria for Infowars.com.
[2:06:16.380 --> 2:06:27.380]  In a single great tasting formula, cavemen, it's those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors.
[2:06:27.380 --> 2:06:35.380]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture them. Everyone knew that you used all the parts of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance, the fat for cooking.
[2:06:35.380 --> 2:06:45.380]  But you used the bones for strength, from the outside structure full of minerals and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body. This is the engine of the life essence.
[2:06:45.380 --> 2:06:53.380]  I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were, but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of it.
[2:06:53.380 --> 2:07:20.380]  I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself and Infowars Life.com today.
[2:07:23.380 --> 2:07:37.380]  This is the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[2:07:37.380 --> 2:07:53.380]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[2:07:53.380 --> 2:08:08.380]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.
[2:08:08.380 --> 2:08:29.380]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:08:29.380 --> 2:08:42.380]  Dr. Edward Groot, one of my good friends is here with us today in studio about to go right to your phone calls. Carlos, Sam, Tim, Mary Lou, Maria and others. Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes covering the waterfront.
[2:08:42.380 --> 2:08:50.380]  Russia calls Washington Post report on Trump Intel sharing utter nonsense.
[2:08:50.380 --> 2:09:12.380]  That's why he would have already met with Putin, but he hasn't. He's met with a Chinese president who wasn't elected. Trump is meeting with him, but not with the Russian president who was.
[2:09:12.380 --> 2:09:24.380]  So they've already paralyzed Trump to a great extent. And then the Washington Post put out that a source said he gave them secret intel about ISIS, planning to put bombs disguised as batteries and laptops.
[2:09:24.380 --> 2:09:35.380]  And I heard that year, say like 530 and I went, that's been all over the news for months. That's the Intel out of the Yemen raid. Trump put that out to warn people. He's the president. He's allowed to.
[2:09:35.380 --> 2:09:47.380]  They think we're so stupid. They did that. By the way, I've been busy during the breaks. I really want to print. You guys do that for me. Just the headline studies show unvaccinated children healthier.
[2:09:47.380 --> 2:09:55.380]  We covered it all last week. I just want to get those because I was going to cover those now and I forgot to. And then also the one out of the Boston Herald saying hang people that don't take vaccines.
[2:09:55.380 --> 2:10:00.380]  That was the headline, right? I saw that last week. I want to show that to folks. We'll do that at the bottom of the hour now.
[2:10:00.380 --> 2:10:06.380]  We're going to make a big deal out of that. We're going to do that one way or the other. And I got some clips I want to play, but Dr. Group.
[2:10:06.380 --> 2:10:13.380]  But I actually want to print it. Yeah, there it is. Editorial. Praying on parents' fears. And then it goes through some of that.
[2:10:13.380 --> 2:10:18.380]  Let's just print all those off for me if you can do that, please.
[2:10:18.380 --> 2:10:25.380]  But again, looking at the situation with Russia, it's so ridiculous.
[2:10:25.380 --> 2:10:32.380]  And it never ends. And the people doing it have been caught lying. So we're sitting here with like this zombie media.
[2:10:32.380 --> 2:10:43.380]  They're dead. No one really believes them, but they can still run these giant hoaxes in an attempt to overthrow Trump. Why are they so mad at Trump?
[2:10:43.380 --> 2:10:55.380]  To me, it's hard to understand why people are still watching the nonsense out there because you can find the truth if you look for it online and you search for it.
[2:10:55.380 --> 2:11:05.380]  This whole collusion with the Russians and all this other stuff that's been going on, it's just like a full-blown attack that's happening on Trump right now.
[2:11:05.380 --> 2:11:17.380]  And hopefully, you know, I have to say that I am a little bit discouraged with the EPA basically releasing and approving all these toxic, harmful chemicals.
[2:11:17.380 --> 2:11:22.380]  One of the things that I was writing to the new administration about was, look, guys, we have to get rid of it.
[2:11:22.380 --> 2:11:29.380]  The FDA is all ex-Monsanto pharmaceutical company heads that are running the government.
[2:11:29.380 --> 2:11:39.380]  It's all lobbyists. It's all big industry that's in government. And this is one of the reasons I was so excited that Trump was going to come in and possibly drain the swamp.
[2:11:39.380 --> 2:11:45.380]  It doesn't matter if it's Trump or anybody else in government, at least they're not part of the whole globalist agenda.
[2:11:45.380 --> 2:11:56.380]  And hopefully we can get rid of all of these industry leaders and all these post-industry people that are running the EPA, that are running the FDA,
[2:11:56.380 --> 2:12:12.380]  that are approving all of these chemicals and all these toxins that are causing us to become sick and ill so the pharmaceutical company can profit and so that everybody walks around with a mind that's easily manipulated.
[2:12:12.380 --> 2:12:21.380]  I mean, if you look at, you ask yourself the question, why are these people, why do people believe in all this stuff that's going on?
[2:12:21.380 --> 2:12:26.380]  Why aren't people doing their own research? Why are they believing everything that they hear on CNN?
[2:12:26.380 --> 2:12:39.380]  A lot of it has to do with the way that they've been manipulated through commercials and through media and through pharmaceuticals and through the fluoride and the water and the chlorine and the vaccinations and the flu shots and the fear that they're under.
[2:12:39.380 --> 2:12:50.380]  I mean, we're dealing with a society right now that is under a tremendous amount of stress and stress will reduce your immune system automatically by 50%.
[2:12:50.380 --> 2:12:59.380]  We're dealing with a society right now is who is extremely toxic. We're seeing cancer, the epidemic rise. We're seeing microbes rise.
[2:12:59.380 --> 2:13:16.380]  We're seeing the soil of the earth that's being degraded and as a matter of fact, Monsanto just got approval the other day for a new chemical called NEMA strike technology,
[2:13:16.380 --> 2:13:21.380]  which attacks the roots, the nematodes on the roots of plants.
[2:13:21.380 --> 2:13:32.380]  So when you look at what's really going on with the soil being poisoned, the plants being poisoned, they're trying to shut down organic farming a lot of places.
[2:13:32.380 --> 2:13:36.380]  They're trying to force contamination in organic farms.
[2:13:36.380 --> 2:13:45.380]  You look at the water supply where most governments are not taking the action to clean it up and now you're starting to see mass lawsuits on that.
[2:13:45.380 --> 2:13:56.380]  You're starting to see mass lawsuits on vaccinations. You're starting to see mass lawsuits against Monsanto for causing cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and denying it for years and years and years.
[2:13:56.380 --> 2:14:04.380]  Those are all great things and I don't like to just come up here and report all the negative news because we have a lot of positive things that are happening in the world today.
[2:14:04.380 --> 2:14:07.380]  People are taking responsibility for their own health.
[2:14:07.380 --> 2:14:16.380]  They are getting online and realizing and looking around their house and knowing and educating themselves on volatile organic compounds.
[2:14:16.380 --> 2:14:24.380]  Some of the most dangerous chemicals in people's homes that we're looking at right now are dryer sheets, believe it or not.
[2:14:24.380 --> 2:14:33.380]  You have these homes that are so close together and you have kids that are outside playing that are getting extremely ill and they're getting these high levels of volatile organic compounds
[2:14:33.380 --> 2:14:38.380]  and they're finding out that it's from the dryer sheets that the house next door is using.
[2:14:38.380 --> 2:14:48.380]  Let's expand on all this. This is hurting the elites too, but we've just been so eased into this toxic environment. We don't care. We just accept it.
[2:14:48.380 --> 2:14:53.380]  We've adapted to our environment killing us. I'm about to go to some phone calls here.
[2:14:53.380 --> 2:15:03.380]  The elites are getting ozone injections every week. I know people that do the ozone injections on the elites and they fly them in their private jets.
[2:15:03.380 --> 2:15:12.380]  They've got a bunch of clinics in Austin. The ozone, the glutathione, they've got these other things they're doing that detoxify them.
[2:15:12.380 --> 2:15:25.380]  Oh, and listen to this. Believe it or not, the elites are actually taking your products and they don't want to admit it, but I've heard through the grapevine that they're doing the detoxification methods and they know that what we have out here is worth it.
[2:15:25.380 --> 2:15:31.380]  We do have the best iodine, too. We do have the best geology system, a Z-Shield down in FullWareStore.com.
[2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:38.380]  And they are taking the iodine and they are doing the detoxification and they are healing their gut because they're not stupid. They know what to do.
[2:15:38.380 --> 2:15:47.380]  No, wait a minute. Probiotics are made up. They've had newspapers say so. We're liars. We shouldn't sell a high-quality probiotic and funder operation in the face of all these attacks.
[2:15:47.380 --> 2:15:54.380]  Now, I want to go to Carlos, Sam, Tim, Mary, Maria, and others here with Dr. Group. On any subject you want to raise, a lot of them have questions for Dr. Group.
[2:15:54.380 --> 2:16:00.380]  A lot of them will talk about Trump. But I'll say this. Yeah, Trump could do more at the EPA. He's trying to actually just get the job to come back.
[2:16:00.380 --> 2:16:08.380]  But the point is, is that he's not perfect. It's that he's an American president and the globalists don't like that because he's actually making the decisions.
[2:16:08.380 --> 2:16:15.380]  And he knows common sense can get to people just like he set up this commission with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. heading it up, exposing the vaccines.
[2:16:15.380 --> 2:16:22.380]  I think he's doing a great job. I mean, he's got a million things on his list and he's got so many people that have already been in office under the...
[2:16:22.380 --> 2:16:27.380]  Sure. Why do you think you're a smart guy? Dr. Group, why are they wanting to take him out so bad?
[2:16:27.380 --> 2:16:33.380]  Because he's going against everything that they've been trying to put in action for years and years.
[2:16:33.380 --> 2:16:46.380]  Think about the billions of dollars from the industries, from the pharmaceutical companies, from the oil and gas industries, all of the deep-seated, anti-free speech,
[2:16:46.380 --> 2:16:54.380]  all of the exposure that's going to be coming out with pedophilia, with all the other stuff that's been going on for years and years.
[2:16:54.380 --> 2:17:05.380]  They're scared because they're scared that the truth is finally going to be in the mainstream and they're losing control of the president,
[2:17:05.380 --> 2:17:10.380]  which is normally just a puppet that's been in place for years and years and years and they're telling what to do.
[2:17:10.380 --> 2:17:12.380]  So that's why I think they're so scared.
[2:17:12.380 --> 2:17:19.380]  That's right. And look at this article. Boston Herald says people should be hanged to death for vaccine choice.
[2:17:19.380 --> 2:17:26.380]  You can pull that up. They're getting desperate because they know we're reaching the tipping point where people are waking up and then I pulled up the articles.
[2:17:26.380 --> 2:17:33.380]  Pattern, premature birth, vaccination, and neurological development disorders.
[2:17:33.380 --> 2:17:37.380]  A cross-section study of six- to 12-year-old vaccinated and unvaccinated children.
[2:17:37.380 --> 2:17:39.380]  And it's all coming out. It's all coming out.
[2:17:39.380 --> 2:17:42.380]  How the Prozac causes bleeding on the brain, the Luvox, all of it.
[2:17:42.380 --> 2:17:48.380]  How the soft drinks that are sugar-free with Aspartame make you fatter and give you brain damage.
[2:17:48.380 --> 2:17:50.380]  This is all mainstream studies now.
[2:17:50.380 --> 2:17:58.380]  Everything we told you, because it's always been in mainstream studies, it's just now people don't trust MSM to MSM's having to report some of the truth.
[2:17:58.380 --> 2:18:00.380]  Rob Do, break it down.
[2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:02.380]  Well, Alex, here's the interesting thing.
[2:18:02.380 --> 2:18:08.380]  After those studies came out, within 48 hours, they were pulled by open access texts.
[2:18:08.380 --> 2:18:12.380]  They were being pressured by the vaccine industry from what my sources are telling me.
[2:18:12.380 --> 2:18:16.380]  If you go to the article, Bombshell Study Proves Unvaccinated Children Are Healthier,
[2:18:16.380 --> 2:18:18.380]  we have a breakdown of those studies.
[2:18:18.380 --> 2:18:21.380]  And then also at the bottom, we have one of the archive links.
[2:18:21.380 --> 2:18:26.380]  They've already pulled down another one that was archived, because people went on and archived these studies.
[2:18:26.380 --> 2:18:34.380]  But basically what it showed was that there was a 6.6-fold increase in neurodevelopmental disorders between vaccinated children and unvaccinated children.
[2:18:34.380 --> 2:18:38.380]  Those are major studies being pulled off the study sites because it's scaring them so bad.
[2:18:38.380 --> 2:18:39.380]  Here it is.
[2:18:39.380 --> 2:18:41.380]  We'll put it on screen. Here's the article.
[2:18:41.380 --> 2:18:46.380]  So that's what's really disturbing about this, because that's why people, they couldn't find them.
[2:18:46.380 --> 2:18:52.380]  I got your text saying, hey, we need these studies. I had actually printed them out because I knew this is the kind of stuff they'd taken studies down like this before.
[2:18:52.380 --> 2:18:58.380]  They don't want people to see this information that vaccinated children are unhealthier than unvaccinated children.
[2:18:58.380 --> 2:19:03.380]  They want to shield this from everybody, because if people start learning this truth, they won't get there.
[2:19:03.380 --> 2:19:09.380]  We've had nurses on from the preemie wards that's been in the news where the babies all stop breathing when they're ordered to give them the shots.
[2:19:09.380 --> 2:19:11.380]  They go and put them on respirators.
[2:19:11.380 --> 2:19:17.380]  Yeah, it's a big game. It's a big game for them. They go, oh, we got to get the intubators ready so we can help the babies breathe after they get their shots.
[2:19:17.380 --> 2:19:23.380]  They're giving them these Hep B shots. There's no way these kids can get Hep B as a little baby. It's ridiculous.
[2:19:23.380 --> 2:19:25.380]  They're giving the most deadly shot there is.
[2:19:25.380 --> 2:19:26.380]  Yeah.
[2:19:26.380 --> 2:19:28.380]  And notice Hep B is exploding now in the U.S.
[2:19:28.380 --> 2:19:38.380]  Yeah, and one of the things that's not talked about a lot with the vaccines is the epigenetic gene damaging problems that we're going to see when they're using all these different animals.
[2:19:38.380 --> 2:19:41.380]  Oh, that's another thing they admit. It's jumping into our genetics.
[2:19:41.380 --> 2:19:50.380]  It can go from generation to generation to generation, three generations down, you're going to have damages from these vaccinations in this generation.
[2:19:50.380 --> 2:19:55.380]  And that goes for the endocrine disrupting chemicals as well. Anything that damages the genes.
[2:19:55.380 --> 2:19:59.380]  We'll be right back. Shame on everybody trying to block this information. It's a fact. We talk to the nurses.
[2:19:59.380 --> 2:20:06.380]  By now you know that wireless technology like cell phones do in fact pose dangers to the health and privacy of everyone.

[2:20:32.380 --> 2:20:35.380]  The big media are at war with President Trump and his allies.

[2:24:18.380 --> 2:24:23.380]  More fake news we broke over a week ago that Trump's planning a purge confirmed.
[2:24:23.380 --> 2:24:28.380]  More fake news that we confirmed that the police and others believe that Mr. Rich on the DNC was murdered.
[2:24:28.380 --> 2:24:30.380]  That's now mainstream news confirmed.
[2:24:30.380 --> 2:24:34.380]  Just hundreds and hundreds of things every month that we first break that are confirmed.
[2:24:34.380 --> 2:24:41.380]  We told you that Timberlake Guilfoyle was being considered as the main contender to replace Sean Spicer.
[2:24:41.380 --> 2:24:46.380]  We even had the White House call up and tell us we were wrong from a separate source.
[2:24:46.380 --> 2:24:49.380]  I think I'll go with our source. It's pretty high up.
[2:24:49.380 --> 2:24:54.380]  Roger Stone, who I guess can talk about some of this now, he's just been in New York.
[2:24:54.380 --> 2:24:57.380]  Had dinner a few nights ago with Kimberly.
[2:24:57.380 --> 2:25:01.380]  They didn't sleep. They had so much fun on the town with her and some of her friends.
[2:25:01.380 --> 2:25:03.380]  Roger's owner for many, many years.
[2:25:03.380 --> 2:25:08.380]  Kimberly Guilfoyle says she's talking with Trump administration about press secretary job.
[2:25:08.380 --> 2:25:10.380]  Oh my gosh, so here we are.
[2:25:10.380 --> 2:25:17.380]  That is exactly six days later, San Jose Mercury News confirming what our sources said.
[2:25:17.380 --> 2:25:23.380]  I called Roger up that day and said, have you heard this? He said, yes, yes, that's what I've heard.
[2:25:23.380 --> 2:25:26.380]  He is not our source. He did not leak that. We have another source.
[2:25:26.380 --> 2:25:29.380]  So there you go. We're right yet again, Roger. Aren't we horrible?
[2:25:29.380 --> 2:25:31.380]  Yeah, it's amazing, Alex.
[2:25:31.380 --> 2:25:40.380]  As you know, the president was inclined towards Kimberly Guilfoyle originally when Sean Spicer was selected.
[2:25:40.380 --> 2:25:46.380]  It would have been an excellent choice because Guilfoyle is, of course, a Hispanic woman,
[2:25:46.380 --> 2:25:53.380]  a very respected attorney, a former prosecutor, a very strong supporter of the president.
[2:25:53.380 --> 2:26:02.380]  She is skillful and obviously, you know, she is very attractive on television and this is the television age.
[2:26:02.380 --> 2:26:07.380]  So that was short circuited originally. Sean Spicer got the job.
[2:26:07.380 --> 2:26:14.380]  Now that it's clear that Spicer cannot do the job, Guilfoyle appears to be under consideration again.
[2:26:14.380 --> 2:26:21.380]  Now, I'm told that she has signed a new contract with Fox, but there are a number of ways out of that contract.
[2:26:21.380 --> 2:26:28.380]  If she were to choose to serve the country, this would be an excellent appointment by the president.
[2:26:28.380 --> 2:26:33.380]  I did see her in New York and I can tell you she is open to it.
[2:26:33.380 --> 2:26:41.380]  It would be a major drop in income, as you might imagine, but it would also be an opportunity to serve the country.
[2:26:41.380 --> 2:26:47.380]  And to not read off a teleprompter, which she already does, she's a smart lady, prosecutor, tenacious, defend the republic.
[2:26:47.380 --> 2:26:53.380]  We have to draft her and as you're saying, obviously the Guilfoyle is considering, is it?
[2:26:53.380 --> 2:26:57.380]  I mean, would you say she's 60-44, 60-40 again, 50-50?
[2:26:57.380 --> 2:27:02.380]  My gut, Alex, is that if she were offered the job, she would accept it.
[2:27:02.380 --> 2:27:05.380]  This is an exceptional opportunity to serve the country.
[2:27:05.380 --> 2:27:09.380]  She is a close friend of Donald and Melania Trump.
[2:27:09.380 --> 2:27:13.380]  She has, I think, been more than fair in the coverage at Fox.
[2:27:13.380 --> 2:27:19.380]  She's been one of those in the opinion shows who's done a great job of defending the president,
[2:27:19.380 --> 2:27:23.380]  which is something that, this is what the press secretary is supposed to be doing.
[2:27:23.380 --> 2:27:26.380]  Yeah, not sitting or throwing him under the bus or hiding in the bushes.
[2:27:26.380 --> 2:27:29.380]  And I'll tell you, it'll be a lot easier to watch her give press briefings than Sean Spicer.
[2:27:29.380 --> 2:27:32.380]  No, that's for sure.
[2:27:32.380 --> 2:27:40.380]  This is another example, though, Alex, of Info Wars being ahead of the curve in terms of reporting exactly what's happening in the Trump administration.
[2:27:40.380 --> 2:27:44.380]  Well, she also said that Roger Ailes wasn't doing anything.
[2:27:44.380 --> 2:27:45.380]  That's true.
[2:27:45.380 --> 2:27:47.380]  So she's not a dishonorable liar.
[2:27:47.380 --> 2:27:51.380]  No, she's been, she's been, unlike Megyn Kelly, who you spoke to the other day,
[2:27:51.380 --> 2:27:57.380]  she has been a defender of Roger Ailes, who really is the person who made her career.
[2:27:57.380 --> 2:28:04.380]  Now, recognize she was once married to Gavin Newsom, now the Lieutenant Governor of California,
[2:28:04.380 --> 2:28:10.380]  former mayor of San Francisco, but that does not reflect her politics.
[2:28:10.380 --> 2:28:15.380]  She is a very skilled political thinker, but she's a solid conservative.
[2:28:15.380 --> 2:28:16.380]  Absolutely.
[2:28:16.380 --> 2:28:20.380]  Well, here we are breaking news six, seven days before it's out.
[2:28:20.380 --> 2:28:21.380]  No wonder they want to shut us down.
[2:28:21.380 --> 2:28:26.380]  We're so horrible, Roger.
[2:28:26.380 --> 2:28:28.380]  I think Roger has lost our audio there in the studio.
[2:28:28.380 --> 2:28:29.380]  Can you hear me, Roger?
[2:28:29.380 --> 2:28:31.380]  I can now say it again, Alex.
[2:28:31.380 --> 2:28:35.380]  They're so upset that we continue to scoop them over and over again.
[2:28:35.380 --> 2:28:37.380]  Well, they're lazy.
[2:28:37.380 --> 2:28:39.380]  We're out doing the work.
[2:28:39.380 --> 2:28:45.380]  And of course, because a number of the people in the Trump campaign have great relationships
[2:28:45.380 --> 2:28:50.380]  with info wars, we do have an inside track in terms of what is going on.
[2:28:50.380 --> 2:28:53.380]  So look, this would be a 10 strike.
[2:28:53.380 --> 2:29:00.380]  You get a Hispanic woman who is very respected, who as a prosecutor, never lost a case,
[2:29:00.380 --> 2:29:06.380]  who famously gave her summations without a note, first in her class in law school,
[2:29:06.380 --> 2:29:12.380]  first in her class in college, you know, a thoroughbred, like Donald Trump, a thoroughbred.
[2:29:12.380 --> 2:29:18.380]  This would be the correct face for the administration rather than Sean Spicer,
[2:29:18.380 --> 2:29:25.380]  a man who I guarantee you will never make Mr. Stone's international best best dress list.
[2:29:25.380 --> 2:29:26.380]  Not a chance.
[2:29:26.380 --> 2:29:31.380]  They are really going to have trouble demonizing her on Saturday Night Live.
[2:29:31.380 --> 2:29:33.380]  All right, Roger, I know you're going to tape some stuff for the nightly news.
[2:29:33.380 --> 2:29:34.380]  Thank you, my friend.
[2:29:34.380 --> 2:29:36.380]  All right, we're coming up to the group, and I promise, laser beam.
[2:29:36.380 --> 2:29:38.380]  We're going to write to your phone calls.
[2:29:38.380 --> 2:29:41.380]  Carlos is up first, then Maria, Mary, Tim, Sam, and others.
[2:29:41.380 --> 2:29:44.380]  Infowars.com is massively censored.
[2:29:44.380 --> 2:29:45.380]  Have you spread that link today?
[2:29:45.380 --> 2:29:47.380]  I want to thank all of you that have.
[2:29:47.380 --> 2:29:48.380]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:48.380 --> 2:29:50.380]  We're on the march.
[2:29:50.380 --> 2:29:52.380]  The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:52.380 --> 2:29:56.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:23.380 --> 2:30:26.380]  What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly.
[2:30:26.380 --> 2:30:29.380]  It is dearness only that gives everything its value.
[2:30:29.380 --> 2:30:32.380]  Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its goods.
[2:30:32.380 --> 2:30:38.380]  And it would be strange, indeed, if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated.
[2:30:38.380 --> 2:30:42.380]  Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right,
[2:30:42.380 --> 2:30:46.380]  not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever.
[2:30:46.380 --> 2:30:51.380]  And if being bound in that matter is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon Earth.
[2:30:51.380 --> 2:30:56.380]  And even the expression is impious, for so unlimited a power can only belong to God.
[2:30:56.380 --> 2:31:22.380]  Thomas Paine, The American Crisis.
[2:31:27.380 --> 2:31:31.380]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system to DNA production and eyesight,
[2:31:31.380 --> 2:31:36.380]  Biotrucelinium is also the perfect supercharger to survival shield X2 nascent iodine,
[2:31:36.380 --> 2:31:39.380]  as both help support a healthy thyroid and many other systems.
[2:31:39.380 --> 2:31:44.380]  Visit infowarslife.com to order your bottle of Biotrucelinium before we sell it again.

[2:31:53.380 --> 2:31:57.380]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in this fight. This is the time to support InfoWars.
[2:31:57.380 --> 2:31:59.380]  That's infowarslife.com.
[2:31:59.380 --> 2:32:05.380]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[2:32:05.380 --> 2:32:10.380]  Research across the board is clear. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream,
[2:32:10.380 --> 2:32:12.380]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[2:32:12.380 --> 2:32:19.380]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[2:32:19.380 --> 2:32:26.380]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula that's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[2:32:26.380 --> 2:32:33.380]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since Biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[2:32:33.380 --> 2:32:41.380]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more
[2:32:41.380 --> 2:32:46.380]  due to requests from listeners who found that spearmint was a little bit too strong for some of their children.
[2:32:46.380 --> 2:32:50.380]  We have created the new Bubble Gum flavored Super Blue that is spearmint-free.

[2:52:58.380 --> 2:53:06.380]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[2:53:06.380 --> 2:53:16.380]  The symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:53:16.380 --> 2:53:22.380]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:53:22.380 --> 2:53:30.380]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:53:30.380 --> 2:53:33.380]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:53:33.380 --> 2:53:41.380]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:53:59.380 --> 2:54:15.380]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central we've got the Alex Jones show, I call it in force live, what we do here on the TV, radio, flash internet, you know, side of things.
[2:54:15.380 --> 2:54:29.380]  But talking to this lady here, you know, I've read hundreds of mainstream news articles about the glyphosates growing breast cancer and then I've sat there and had it hit my own family and I see it up 3-4000% depending on the type.
[2:54:29.380 --> 2:54:33.380]  Pediatric cancer is up 10,000% as children's cancers folks.
[2:54:33.380 --> 2:54:38.380]  I mean this is crazy but it's always only want to find a cure never why is it exploding.
[2:54:38.380 --> 2:54:52.380]  And this lady brings up going to the doctor or going to the nutritionist and then they blow up when the US government had iodide added to the salt for decades and IQs went up 15% Google it.
[2:54:52.380 --> 2:55:00.380]  Roundup gave us cancer as EPA officials help the company CNN at least CNN is finally getting it right in 2017.
[2:55:00.380 --> 2:55:08.380]  Yesterday, I've been disposing glyphosate for 20 years and I would get letters threatening to show me from Monsanto.
[2:55:08.380 --> 2:55:10.380]  You know, I told them I said go ahead and do it.
[2:55:10.380 --> 2:55:22.380]  I could not because I'm some angel if they knew it was giving people cancer when they tested it and it was giving rats cancer in the 70s and they finally got it approved in the 80s and you're lying and saying you can drink it when it'll kill you.
[2:55:22.380 --> 2:55:23.380]  It's wrong.
[2:55:23.380 --> 2:55:25.380]  And I just don't understand it.
[2:55:25.380 --> 2:55:32.380]  But again, folks, we told you they're going to drop they're trying to hire, you know, the new press secretary.
[2:55:32.380 --> 2:55:33.380]  Now it's in the news.
[2:55:33.380 --> 2:55:36.380]  We don't make this up and everybody knows it.
[2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:38.380]  Who's real, but they're trying to shut us down.
[2:55:38.380 --> 2:55:44.380]  So please pray for us and please financially support us and please get the new Z shield that goes great with X2.
[2:55:44.380 --> 2:55:46.380]  What else does this go great with?
[2:55:46.380 --> 2:55:48.380]  That goes well with anything.
[2:55:48.380 --> 2:55:55.380]  I mean, all of the info wars life products are designed to help you achieve the health that you're trying to achieve.
[2:55:55.380 --> 2:55:59.380]  I mean, they're all pretty much based on detoxification and care and cleansing.
[2:55:59.380 --> 2:56:04.380]  You're fun of the info war that the enemy's trying to shut down that totally gets in their face.
[2:56:04.380 --> 2:56:05.380]  It's a total act of defiance.
[2:56:05.380 --> 2:56:10.380]  I want to thank you all for your support 25% off out of the gates because I want you to try it 10% off.
[2:56:10.380 --> 2:56:15.380]  Additionally, when you sign up for auto ship and all orders $50 or more are free shipping infowarstore.com.
[2:56:15.380 --> 2:56:19.380]  Okay, Mary Lou, go ahead and finish your points. Thank you for holding over.
[2:56:19.380 --> 2:56:20.380]  Oh, thank you.
[2:56:20.380 --> 2:56:25.380]  Okay, now here's my point and my question with the field.
[2:56:25.380 --> 2:56:30.380]  Okay, now that is from what I got today because today's first date.
[2:56:30.380 --> 2:56:33.380]  I got to see it on your program.
[2:56:33.380 --> 2:56:40.380]  If any of these products actually can you use them on your on your children, you know, on smaller children?
[2:56:40.380 --> 2:56:49.380]  And the reason the reason why I ask is is my oldest granddaughter when she is mandated to have the vaccine shot when she comes home.
[2:56:49.380 --> 2:56:52.380]  I mean, she is definitely sick for less, not less than five.
[2:56:52.380 --> 2:56:54.380]  First off, I know the Pennsylvania law.
[2:56:54.380 --> 2:57:04.380]  It's got more restrictive like California, but you have objections for religious conscientious moral objections that I think they got rid of one in Pennsylvania.
[2:57:04.380 --> 2:57:07.380]  But you there's a health department filing.
[2:57:07.380 --> 2:57:08.380]  It's not a law.
[2:57:08.380 --> 2:57:09.380]  It's a regulation.
[2:57:09.380 --> 2:57:13.380]  You can opt out of the vaccines in all 50 states, ma'am.
[2:57:13.380 --> 2:57:15.380]  It's probably her.
[2:57:15.380 --> 2:57:16.380]  It's her.
[2:57:16.380 --> 2:57:19.380]  How old are the children?
[2:57:19.380 --> 2:57:22.380]  My oldest one is two and a half.
[2:57:22.380 --> 2:57:23.380]  Oh my God.
[2:57:23.380 --> 2:57:25.380]  Ma'am, ma'am, I've got four children.
[2:57:25.380 --> 2:57:26.380]  They're incredibly healthy.
[2:57:26.380 --> 2:57:27.380]  None of them have ever had a vaccine.
[2:57:27.380 --> 2:57:28.380]  The studies are out there.
[2:57:28.380 --> 2:57:33.380]  There is no law that your children have to take vaccines and none of it in their own inserts.
[2:57:33.380 --> 2:57:39.380]  I know, but the doctor is saying it's mandated.
[2:57:39.380 --> 2:57:40.380]  That's it.
[2:57:40.380 --> 2:57:46.380]  Well, ma'am, you just Google anti-vaccine doctors in Pennsylvania and you take them somewhere else and you don't let that bully.
[2:57:46.380 --> 2:57:48.380]  I tell you what, I can't do this for every case.
[2:57:48.380 --> 2:57:53.380]  You want me to go on airplane, come up there, talk to that doctor?
[2:57:53.380 --> 2:57:55.380]  Oh, I can take care of it.
[2:57:55.380 --> 2:58:01.380]  Well, all I'm telling you, ma'am, is I know, I know, I know people say, oh, let's give them the vaccines and let's give them something to pull heavy metals out of.
[2:58:01.380 --> 2:58:05.380]  I mean, is that where you're going with this?
[2:58:05.380 --> 2:58:06.380]  Well.
[2:58:06.380 --> 2:58:08.380]  Dr. Griff, what's your bottom line?
[2:58:08.380 --> 2:58:11.380]  Let me tell you the best thing you can do for your children.
[2:58:11.380 --> 2:58:12.380]  I have two children of my own.
[2:58:12.380 --> 2:58:17.380]  The best thing you can do is protect them from all the chemicals, all the toxins, everything.
[2:58:17.380 --> 2:58:20.380]  My children use the survival shield.
[2:58:20.380 --> 2:58:23.380]  I make sure that their gut is healthy and clean with Google biotics.
[2:58:23.380 --> 2:58:24.380]  Probiotics are essential.
[2:58:24.380 --> 2:58:25.380]  Yeah, it's up to you, ma'am.
[2:58:25.380 --> 2:58:27.380]  Talk to your physician, but it doesn't sound like this one.
[2:58:27.380 --> 2:58:35.380]  And the Z-Shield as well, because they're going to be exposed to some chemicals, so try to just focus on good food, good water, good air, everything.
[2:58:35.380 --> 2:58:36.380]  Everything in them is safe.
[2:58:36.380 --> 2:58:38.380]  You don't want to give them too much eye to consult your physician.
[2:58:38.380 --> 2:58:39.380]  I'm going to come back to her.
[2:58:39.380 --> 2:58:40.380]  Yes, yes.
[2:58:40.380 --> 2:58:41.380]  This is important.
[2:58:41.380 --> 2:58:42.380]  Mary Lou, don't stay there.
[2:58:42.380 --> 2:59:10.380]  I've made these decisions myself in my own life.
[2:59:10.380 --> 2:59:18.380]  The Prostagart formula does just that with its mixture of plant-based nutrients and antioxidants that help give your body total support.
[2:59:18.380 --> 2:59:27.380]  It's a hand-selected blend of saw palmetto, lycopene, plant sterols, zinc, vitamin D3, selenium, and copper.
[2:59:27.380 --> 2:59:31.380]  Prostagart is something that the men on the Infowars crew take every day.
[2:59:31.380 --> 2:59:38.380]  And from our research, it's something that men should really be adding to their daily regimen in order to keep their body going at optimal levels.
[2:59:38.380 --> 2:59:42.380]  Now's the time to start naturally supporting your body.

[2:59:46.380 --> 3:00:11.380]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[3:00:11.380 --> 3:00:18.380]  I heard it.
[3:00:18.380 --> 3:00:25.380]  You know, having home birth, staying up with kids when they are sick at night, paying the bills, busting your ass.
[3:00:25.380 --> 3:00:27.380]  That's what a real man does, not acting tough.
[3:00:27.380 --> 3:00:29.380]  And you're a real man, Dr. Grip.
[3:00:29.380 --> 3:00:32.380]  Well, let me tell you about one thing.
[3:00:32.380 --> 3:00:37.380]  This is one of the biggest myths that the medical profession has put upon kids.
[3:00:37.380 --> 3:00:40.380]  Well, they admit no vaccine has ever protected from the flu.
[3:00:40.380 --> 3:00:41.380]  It's totally made up.
[3:00:41.380 --> 3:00:42.380]  Yeah.
[3:00:42.380 --> 3:00:46.380]  And they also say as soon as you have a tiny fever, take some medication.
[3:00:46.380 --> 3:00:48.380]  If you look at all of the tests.
[3:00:48.380 --> 3:00:50.380]  Trevers are meant to kill the viruses and bacteria.
[3:00:50.380 --> 3:00:51.380]  Yeah.
[3:00:51.380 --> 3:00:55.380]  I mean, even hyperthermia treatments that MD Anderson was looking into for cancer,
[3:00:55.380 --> 3:00:58.380]  would the cancer cells die anywhere between 104 and 106?
[3:00:58.380 --> 3:01:02.380]  And they were heating up the tumors to die off the cells.
[3:01:02.380 --> 3:01:05.380]  You know, all the viruses and the bacteria and everything.
[3:01:05.380 --> 3:01:08.380]  My kids had a temperature of 106.34.
[3:01:08.380 --> 3:01:11.380]  And the strangest thing is I was watching it happen.
[3:01:11.380 --> 3:01:17.380]  And the body would reduce his temperature all the way down to 101,102.
[3:01:17.380 --> 3:01:19.380]  Then it would spike back up to 106.
[3:01:19.380 --> 3:01:20.380]  Then it would come back down.
[3:01:20.380 --> 3:01:24.380]  Within 10 seconds, it would be going from 106.4 all the way down.
[3:01:24.380 --> 3:01:30.380]  Now, we've instilled so the medical community has instilled so much fear into everybody.
[3:01:30.380 --> 3:01:31.380]  Oh, I know.
[3:01:31.380 --> 3:01:32.380]  I had my own personal life.
[3:01:32.380 --> 3:01:36.380]  I've seen people when a child has 100 and a half.
[3:01:36.380 --> 3:01:39.380]  Give them Tylenol, give them Tylenol, like Tylenol eats their liver.
[3:01:39.380 --> 3:01:40.380]  No.
[3:01:40.380 --> 3:01:41.380]  And then it hits 102 and it goes away.
[3:01:41.380 --> 3:01:42.380]  They call that child abuse.
[3:01:42.380 --> 3:01:43.380]  No.
[3:01:43.380 --> 3:01:46.380]  We have fevers for a reason.
[3:01:46.380 --> 3:01:49.380]  How about pregnant women forced to get the flu shot?
[3:01:49.380 --> 3:01:50.380]  I mean, I knew...
[3:01:50.380 --> 3:01:53.380]  Until six years ago, any medical doctor would tell you in a hypocritic oath,
[3:01:53.380 --> 3:01:57.380]  never give a pregnant woman any vaccine because it causes autoimmune response and abortions.
[3:01:57.380 --> 3:01:59.380]  Fact, the inserts said it.
[3:01:59.380 --> 3:02:02.380]  Now they double down and said give pregnant women extra shots.
[3:02:02.380 --> 3:02:07.380]  My wife was going in to get checked up when she was pregnant and there's a big sign on the door.
[3:02:07.380 --> 3:02:11.380]  Do not forget your flu vaccine today.
[3:02:11.380 --> 3:02:14.380]  And I'm thinking to myself, are you joking?
[3:02:14.380 --> 3:02:15.380]  Are you serious?
[3:02:15.380 --> 3:02:17.380]  Well, it's not just the miscarriages.
[3:02:17.380 --> 3:02:20.380]  It's also the all sorts of neurological disorders.
[3:02:20.380 --> 3:02:23.380]  Oh, the list just goes on and on.
[3:02:23.380 --> 3:02:26.380]  The vaccines are getting worse because they're getting to be hexavalent vaccines
[3:02:26.380 --> 3:02:31.380]  and they're putting multiple different strains of things in these flu shots.
[3:02:31.380 --> 3:02:34.380]  And we see the autism and the cancer and the brain damage.
[3:02:34.380 --> 3:02:36.380]  And we're the conspiracy theorist.
[3:02:36.380 --> 3:02:38.380]  We're the conspiracy theorist.
[3:02:38.380 --> 3:02:43.380]  That's bringing the healthcare system down and weighing so much on it.
[3:02:43.380 --> 3:02:46.380]  How much money it costs to take care of autism?
[3:02:46.380 --> 3:02:48.380]  It's a biochemical attack on the country.
[3:02:48.380 --> 3:02:49.380]  Mary Lou.
[3:02:49.380 --> 3:02:50.380]  Yeah.
[3:02:50.380 --> 3:02:52.380]  Finish up your point, ma'am.
[3:02:52.380 --> 3:02:54.380]  I appreciate you calling. Go ahead.
[3:02:54.380 --> 3:02:55.380]  Here's my saying.
[3:02:55.380 --> 3:02:57.380]  When my son was born, my son...
[3:02:57.380 --> 3:03:01.380]  There was all these problems, but my son got all the shots and he was sick all the time.
[3:03:01.380 --> 3:03:05.380]  And now, you know, doing a lot of the different research,
[3:03:05.380 --> 3:03:08.380]  now I find that my oldest granddaughter,
[3:03:08.380 --> 3:03:13.380]  it's like, I feel like she was born with some of the genetic problems that he had.
[3:03:13.380 --> 3:03:16.380]  So now we got it twice as bad.
[3:03:16.380 --> 3:03:20.380]  Now, I've been given her the Child Ease,
[3:03:20.380 --> 3:03:25.380]  and that seems to actually cure a lot of her functions,
[3:03:25.380 --> 3:03:28.380]  her problems during the day, believe it or not.
[3:03:28.380 --> 3:03:30.380]  Well, we can't say things, cure things.
[3:03:30.380 --> 3:03:32.380]  We can't tell recommend supplements for people under 12.
[3:03:32.380 --> 3:03:34.380]  So it's like I said, make your own decisions,
[3:03:34.380 --> 3:03:37.380]  but Child Ease has been around 30-plus years.
[3:03:37.380 --> 3:03:39.380]  We probably labeled it under another name,
[3:03:39.380 --> 3:03:41.380]  sold by Whole Foods and others.
[3:03:41.380 --> 3:03:43.380]  It's a bunch of concentrated herbs,
[3:03:43.380 --> 3:03:45.380]  and it's kind of a copy of old wives' tale stuff
[3:03:45.380 --> 3:03:47.380]  of a whole bunch of herbs that women would grind up.
[3:03:47.380 --> 3:03:49.380]  It's a black syrup and give the kids.
[3:03:49.380 --> 3:03:51.380]  Now, you just...
[3:03:51.380 --> 3:03:53.380]  Well, I'm going to ask this thing.
[3:03:53.380 --> 3:03:55.380]  Unfortunately, we're not...
[3:03:55.380 --> 3:03:56.380]  Go ahead, ma'am. I'm sorry.
[3:03:56.380 --> 3:03:57.380]  I'm going to run for a minute or two.
[3:03:57.380 --> 3:03:59.380]  Go ahead, ma'am.
[3:03:59.380 --> 3:04:00.380]  The living defense.
[3:04:00.380 --> 3:04:03.380]  Now, I started the living defense back in around January,
[3:04:03.380 --> 3:04:05.380]  but I do take one a day,
[3:04:05.380 --> 3:04:08.380]  and I did notice that just taking one a day,
[3:04:08.380 --> 3:04:11.380]  I know it says, you know, not to take it every single day.
[3:04:11.380 --> 3:04:15.380]  I just want to make sure that because I feel good when...
[3:04:15.380 --> 3:04:18.380]  If I don't take it every day, you know,
[3:04:18.380 --> 3:04:22.380]  because I don't take anything unless it's natural.
[3:04:22.380 --> 3:04:24.380]  Well, ma'am, all I know is thank you for the support.
[3:04:24.380 --> 3:04:25.380]  We couldn't do it without you,
[3:04:25.380 --> 3:04:27.380]  and it's what God gave us through Mother Nature,
[3:04:27.380 --> 3:04:29.380]  and it's the very best products we can come up with,
[3:04:29.380 --> 3:04:30.380]  and it funds the operation.
[3:04:30.380 --> 3:04:32.380]  So thank you so much, and God bless you.
[3:04:32.380 --> 3:04:34.380]  I apologize that our callers keep on our own so long.
[3:04:34.380 --> 3:04:36.380]  We start bringing up vaccines and doctors saying,
[3:04:36.380 --> 3:04:37.380]  it's mandated.
[3:04:37.380 --> 3:04:39.380]  That's not a law, folks.
[3:04:39.380 --> 3:04:40.380]  It's mandated.
[3:04:40.380 --> 3:04:43.380]  The health department said give every Hispanic girl,
[3:04:43.380 --> 3:04:45.380]  you know, in Latin America, the Gardasil,
[3:04:45.380 --> 3:04:48.380]  when it's linked to killing people and sterilizing women.
[3:04:48.380 --> 3:04:50.380]  And now you wonder why the people in Mexico
[3:04:50.380 --> 3:04:52.380]  can't have kids a bunch of them.
[3:04:52.380 --> 3:04:53.380]  People go, well, then there's too many of them.
[3:04:53.380 --> 3:04:54.380]  I'm not racist.
[3:04:54.380 --> 3:04:55.380]  I don't want to kill all the Mexicans.
[3:04:55.380 --> 3:04:57.380]  I just don't want them brainwash hating me.
[3:04:57.380 --> 3:04:58.380]  See?
[3:04:58.380 --> 3:04:59.380]  I know.
[3:04:59.380 --> 3:05:02.380]  The One Belt, One Road International Forum in Beijing
[3:05:02.380 --> 3:05:05.380]  started on Sunday, and right now is in its second day.
[3:05:05.380 --> 3:05:07.380]  Regarding the latest North Korean missile test launch
[3:05:07.380 --> 3:05:08.380]  that happened on Sunday,
[3:05:08.380 --> 3:05:11.380]  Putin said that it didn't pose a direct threat to Russia,
[3:05:11.380 --> 3:05:13.380]  but that missile tests are unacceptable
[3:05:13.380 --> 3:05:15.380]  and that these problems need to be solved peacefully
[3:05:15.380 --> 3:05:17.380]  and not through intimidating North Korea,
[3:05:17.380 --> 3:05:19.380]  but through returning to dialogue.
[3:05:19.380 --> 3:05:22.380]  Putin also commented on a so-called Wanna Cry,
[3:05:22.380 --> 3:05:24.380]  the ransomware virus attack
[3:05:24.380 --> 3:05:26.380]  that hit computers across the world last week.
[3:05:26.380 --> 3:05:29.380]  He said that malware created by intelligence services
[3:05:29.380 --> 3:05:31.380]  can backfire on its creators.
[3:05:31.380 --> 3:05:33.380]  Quote, Microsoft's management has made it clear
[3:05:33.380 --> 3:05:36.380]  that the virus originated from U.S. intelligence services.
[3:05:36.380 --> 3:05:37.380]  End of quote.
[3:05:37.380 --> 3:05:38.380]  Putin said that last year,
[3:05:38.380 --> 3:05:41.380]  Washington refused Russia's proposal on cybersecurity threats
[3:05:41.380 --> 3:05:44.380]  with the aim of drafting a bilateral agreement.
[3:05:44.380 --> 3:05:46.380]  Now regarding the forum's main intent,
[3:05:46.380 --> 3:05:48.380]  Putin said that the plan is for the greater Eurasia,
[3:05:48.380 --> 3:05:51.380]  not to just be an abstract geopolitical arrangement,
[3:05:51.380 --> 3:05:53.380]  but a truly civilization-wide project
[3:05:53.380 --> 3:05:54.380]  looking toward the future,
[3:05:54.380 --> 3:05:57.380]  which can be achieved through the spirit of cooperation.
[3:05:57.380 --> 3:05:59.380]  Visit bandariaforinfowars.com.
[3:05:59.380 --> 3:06:00.380]  After being sold out for months,
[3:06:00.380 --> 3:06:02.380]  our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste
[3:06:02.380 --> 3:06:04.380]  is now back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[3:06:04.380 --> 3:06:07.380]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[3:06:07.380 --> 3:06:09.380]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[3:06:09.380 --> 3:06:11.380]  And since then, people are beating down our doors,
[3:06:11.380 --> 3:06:14.380]  wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[3:06:14.380 --> 3:06:16.380]  Research across the board is clear.
[3:06:16.380 --> 3:06:18.380]  In fact, it's certified.
[3:06:18.380 --> 3:06:20.380]  When bacteria infect your gums,
[3:06:20.380 --> 3:06:21.380]  it can enter your bloodstream
[3:06:21.380 --> 3:06:23.380]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[3:06:23.380 --> 3:06:25.380]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report
[3:06:25.380 --> 3:06:27.380]  on oral health warns that your oral health
[3:06:27.380 --> 3:06:30.380]  can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[3:06:30.380 --> 3:06:31.380]  Super Blue fluoride-free toothpaste
[3:06:31.380 --> 3:06:33.380]  is a groundbreaking new formula.
[3:06:33.380 --> 3:06:35.380]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine,
[3:06:35.380 --> 3:06:36.380]  so the bad halogen fluoride.
[3:06:36.380 --> 3:06:39.380]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients
[3:06:39.380 --> 3:06:40.380]  used since biblical times
[3:06:40.380 --> 3:06:42.380]  to help wipe out bad bacteria
[3:06:42.380 --> 3:06:43.380]  and eliminate bad breath.
[3:06:43.380 --> 3:06:45.380]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue
[3:06:45.380 --> 3:06:47.380]  chosen by our dental experts include
[3:06:47.380 --> 3:06:49.380]  xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine,
[3:06:49.380 --> 3:06:51.380]  nanosilver and more.

[3:08:08.380 --> 3:08:11.380]  From the front lines of the information war,
[3:08:11.380 --> 3:08:13.380]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:13.380 --> 3:08:15.380]  Oh, it's John Rabapur.
[3:08:15.380 --> 3:08:18.380]  Of NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[3:08:18.380 --> 3:08:21.380]  Yeah, we told you Beverly Guilford was in the lead.
[3:08:21.380 --> 3:08:23.380]  Sean Spicer was on his way out.
[3:08:23.380 --> 3:08:25.380]  It's San Jose Mercury News,
[3:08:25.380 --> 3:08:27.380]  Associated Press, last hour.
[3:08:27.380 --> 3:08:29.380]  If we get credit, no.
[3:08:29.380 --> 3:08:31.380]  Mono!
[3:08:31.380 --> 3:08:34.380]  Can you keep him in the dark for life?
[3:08:34.380 --> 3:08:38.380]  Look at you out of the way, that world!
[3:08:38.380 --> 3:08:41.380]  Oh, Mono!
[3:08:41.380 --> 3:08:43.380]  Mono!
[3:08:43.380 --> 3:08:45.380]  Mono!
[3:08:45.380 --> 3:08:48.380]  Gonna take you down the aisle tonight.
[3:08:48.380 --> 3:08:50.380]  All right, let's get serious here.
[3:08:50.380 --> 3:08:52.380]  A little bit of fun in the fourth hour.
[3:08:52.380 --> 3:08:54.380]  I want to finish a few calls.
[3:08:54.380 --> 3:08:56.380]  And then I'm gonna hand the baton to Rabapur,
[3:08:56.380 --> 3:08:58.380]  who's a real angel, co-host of the show.
[3:08:58.380 --> 3:09:00.380]  We're about to add more broadcasts, more shows,
[3:09:00.380 --> 3:09:02.380]  very, very soon, so hopefully he'll have his own,
[3:09:02.380 --> 3:09:04.380]  six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 20 hours a week,
[3:09:04.380 --> 3:09:06.380]  however much they can handle.
[3:09:06.380 --> 3:09:08.380]  They're doing it religiously.
[3:09:08.380 --> 3:09:10.380]  And the stations are ready,
[3:09:10.380 --> 3:09:12.380]  all across the fruited plain.
[3:09:12.380 --> 3:09:14.380]  But before I finish up with these callers here,
[3:09:14.380 --> 3:09:16.380]  I just want to invite Mr. Rabapur
[3:09:16.380 --> 3:09:18.380]  on to the broadcast with us,
[3:09:18.380 --> 3:09:20.380]  of NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[3:09:20.380 --> 3:09:22.380]  They are beavering away, trying to shut us down.
[3:09:22.380 --> 3:09:24.380]  Earlier, we were looking at London Guardian
[3:09:24.380 --> 3:09:26.380]  having a post attacking me by name,
[3:09:26.380 --> 3:09:28.380]  saying, I'm saying vaccines are dangerous.
[3:09:28.380 --> 3:09:30.380]  No, the studies are coming out saying they're dangerous,
[3:09:30.380 --> 3:09:32.380]  saying I'm wrong about Prozac causing cranial bleeding.
[3:09:32.380 --> 3:09:34.380]  See, they used me to say,
[3:09:34.380 --> 3:09:36.380]  I'm the fake news guy, they're branding me as that.
[3:09:36.380 --> 3:09:38.380]  But they never show that I'm showing studies.
[3:09:38.380 --> 3:09:40.380]  I'm showing articles.
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:42.380]  I'm showing their own inserts.
[3:09:42.380 --> 3:09:44.380]  I'm showing their own admissions, John.
[3:09:44.380 --> 3:09:46.380]  So I don't see this
[3:09:46.380 --> 3:09:48.380]  really working anymore.
[3:09:48.380 --> 3:09:50.380]  What do you think?
[3:09:50.380 --> 3:09:52.380]  I think it stopped working a long time ago.
[3:09:52.380 --> 3:09:54.380]  You know, people are getting wise
[3:09:54.380 --> 3:09:56.380]  to this, Alex.
[3:09:56.380 --> 3:09:58.380]  Okay, well, he's to blame,
[3:09:58.380 --> 3:10:00.380]  or she's to blame for
[3:10:00.380 --> 3:10:02.380]  millions of people suddenly
[3:10:02.380 --> 3:10:04.380]  thinking that vaccines might be dangerous.
[3:10:04.380 --> 3:10:06.380]  No, this movement
[3:10:06.380 --> 3:10:08.380]  has been going on in this country
[3:10:08.380 --> 3:10:10.380]  for about 75 years now,
[3:10:10.380 --> 3:10:12.380]  at least.
[3:10:12.380 --> 3:10:14.380]  So wake up a major media
[3:10:14.380 --> 3:10:16.380]  and realize that you're completely insane.
[3:10:16.380 --> 3:10:18.380]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[3:10:18.380 --> 3:10:20.380]  You haven't a clue.
[3:10:20.380 --> 3:10:22.380]  These talking heads say, well, of course,
[3:10:22.380 --> 3:10:24.380]  we know the vaccines are completely
[3:10:24.380 --> 3:10:26.380]  safe and effective.
[3:10:26.380 --> 3:10:28.380]  Really? Do you know that?
[3:10:28.380 --> 3:10:30.380]  Do you know anything?
[3:10:30.380 --> 3:10:32.380]  If you have a high convulsion, blood comes out of their nose,
[3:10:32.380 --> 3:10:34.380]  and then a week later,
[3:10:34.380 --> 3:10:36.380]  at the cemetery,
[3:10:36.380 --> 3:10:38.380]  put them in the ground.
[3:10:38.380 --> 3:10:40.380]  There are people in this building
[3:10:40.380 --> 3:10:42.380]  that I know whose children have died from vaccines.
[3:10:42.380 --> 3:10:44.380]  Exactly.
[3:10:44.380 --> 3:10:46.380]  And if the child was not dead,
[3:10:46.380 --> 3:10:48.380]  when they were taken to the cemetery,
[3:10:48.380 --> 3:10:50.380]  there would be a doctor there to give another shot.
[3:10:50.380 --> 3:10:52.380]  Exactly.
[3:10:52.380 --> 3:10:54.380]  You can be sure of that.
[3:10:54.380 --> 3:10:56.380]  So these idiots on major media,
[3:10:56.380 --> 3:10:58.380]  and I followed them for years,
[3:10:58.380 --> 3:11:00.380]  and so forth, and the anchors,
[3:11:00.380 --> 3:11:02.380]  they know zero.
[3:11:02.380 --> 3:11:04.380]  Nothing about vaccines.
[3:11:04.380 --> 3:11:06.380]  Nothing about drugs.
[3:11:06.380 --> 3:11:08.380]  They're also selfish. They don't want to know.
[3:11:08.380 --> 3:11:10.380]  They kind of self-hypnotize.
[3:11:10.380 --> 3:11:12.380]  So their whole act is
[3:11:12.380 --> 3:11:14.380]  we make you think we know,
[3:11:14.380 --> 3:11:16.380]  and then we bring on this dome head
[3:11:16.380 --> 3:11:18.380]  who is being paid by
[3:11:18.380 --> 3:11:20.380]  pharmaceutical company to say that he's an expert,
[3:11:20.380 --> 3:11:22.380]  and then we
[3:11:22.380 --> 3:11:24.380]  blame somebody. Who can we blame?
[3:11:24.380 --> 3:11:26.380]  Look at this article
[3:11:26.380 --> 3:11:28.380]  right here from Monsanto.
[3:11:28.380 --> 3:11:30.380]  They just hired internet trolls to cover up
[3:11:30.380 --> 3:11:32.380]  Roundup's cancer risk. You're exactly right.
[3:11:32.380 --> 3:11:34.380]  These guys just get paid.
[3:11:34.380 --> 3:11:36.380]  They used to have lawyers writing letters,
[3:11:36.380 --> 3:11:38.380]  and I just said, look, sue me.
[3:11:38.380 --> 3:11:40.380]  I was reading major studies out of Europe
[3:11:40.380 --> 3:11:42.380]  in places where it was giving the rats cancer.
[3:11:42.380 --> 3:11:44.380]  I said, go ahead and sue me.
[3:11:44.380 --> 3:11:46.380]  And I'm not even a hero.
[3:11:46.380 --> 3:11:48.380]  I'm not going to sign on
[3:11:48.380 --> 3:11:50.380]  to cancer killing everybody.
[3:11:50.380 --> 3:11:52.380]  And I'm not a hero.
[3:11:52.380 --> 3:11:54.380]  I'm just not a killer.
[3:11:54.380 --> 3:11:56.380]  My family died of cancer, man.
[3:11:56.380 --> 3:11:58.380]  I'm getting passed here.
[3:11:58.380 --> 3:12:00.380]  My grandmother just died of breast cancer.
[3:12:00.380 --> 3:12:02.380]  I'm sick of this crap.
[3:12:02.380 --> 3:12:04.380]  Sorry, go ahead, Rabbitport.
[3:12:04.380 --> 3:12:06.380]  Yeah, so there you are on the screen with Roundup
[3:12:06.380 --> 3:12:08.380]  and the experts and so forth.
[3:12:08.380 --> 3:12:10.380]  Even the World Health Organization
[3:12:10.380 --> 3:12:12.380]  is forced to, you know,
[3:12:12.380 --> 3:12:14.380]  say over and over, probable carcinogen.
[3:12:14.380 --> 3:12:16.380]  But of course, it's completely safe.
[3:12:16.380 --> 3:12:18.380]  Yes, absolutely safe.
[3:12:18.380 --> 3:12:20.380]  You can drink it, but then they ask the guy that said that to drink it.
[3:12:20.380 --> 3:12:22.380]  He goes, do you think I'm crazy?
[3:12:22.380 --> 3:12:24.380]  I'm not going to drink this stuff.
[3:12:24.380 --> 3:12:26.380]  I'll die.
[3:12:26.380 --> 3:12:28.380]  Well, listen, I want to thank you both.
[3:12:28.380 --> 3:12:30.380]  I'm going to try to get out of here because I know groups got stuff to do
[3:12:30.380 --> 3:12:32.380]  and I want to listen to you and get to other news.
[3:12:32.380 --> 3:12:34.380]  You got to cover, John.
[3:12:34.380 --> 3:12:36.380]  But I promise I go to these calls.
[3:12:36.380 --> 3:12:38.380]  So let's go to a few of them.
[3:12:38.380 --> 3:12:40.380]  I'm glad this caller Jim brings this up and we'll go to Tim.
[3:12:40.380 --> 3:12:42.380]  Jim brings up Supreme Court Bug.
[3:12:42.380 --> 3:12:44.380]  Yeah, what I was told, what we told you.
[3:12:44.380 --> 3:12:46.380]  We sent an investigative team, David Knight, you name it,
[3:12:46.380 --> 3:12:48.380]  down to where Scalia died.
[3:12:48.380 --> 3:12:50.380]  And I said he was getting recruited
[3:12:50.380 --> 3:12:52.380]  by a Bohemian Grove style group.
[3:12:52.380 --> 3:12:54.380]  And he wasn't part of the group.
[3:12:54.380 --> 3:12:56.380]  He got recruited in by the Catholics and then they killed him.
[3:12:56.380 --> 3:12:58.380]  Now I said the Catholics killed him.
[3:12:58.380 --> 3:13:00.380]  He got recruited by a Catholic group.
[3:13:00.380 --> 3:13:02.380]  Months after he died, it was in the Washington Post.
[3:13:02.380 --> 3:13:04.380]  He was part of the Sierra Society, Bohemian Grove created
[3:13:04.380 --> 3:13:06.380]  in South Texas on the border,
[3:13:06.380 --> 3:13:08.380]  this Obama high level appointee guy.
[3:13:08.380 --> 3:13:10.380]  And he's dead.
[3:13:10.380 --> 3:13:12.380]  And we said the word was he was about to go public over wiretapping
[3:13:12.380 --> 3:13:14.380]  and how they were blackmailing Roberts.
[3:13:14.380 --> 3:13:16.380]  Now that we wrote articles.
[3:13:16.380 --> 3:13:18.380]  That's all on record because we're willing
[3:13:18.380 --> 3:13:20.380]  to actually get there
[3:13:20.380 --> 3:13:22.380]  15 hours after they announced he's dead.
[3:13:22.380 --> 3:13:24.380]  Remember, they wouldn't say where his body was
[3:13:24.380 --> 3:13:26.380]  when they announced it was dead. It was just somewhere.
[3:13:26.380 --> 3:13:28.380]  So now it's in mainstream news.
[3:13:28.380 --> 3:13:30.380]  Here, Justice Scalia believed
[3:13:30.380 --> 3:13:32.380]  Supreme Court was being surveilled
[3:13:32.380 --> 3:13:34.380]  by Obama and Jim wants to talk about that.
[3:13:34.380 --> 3:13:36.380]  So something else we were on target about.
[3:13:36.380 --> 3:13:38.380]  Go ahead.
[3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:42.380]  Go ahead, Jim.
[3:13:42.380 --> 3:13:46.380]  Go ahead, Jim. Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
[3:13:48.380 --> 3:13:50.380]  Alex, can you hear me?
[3:13:50.380 --> 3:13:52.380]  Absolutely, Jim. You have a nice voice.
[3:13:52.380 --> 3:13:54.380]  I like your voice, Jim.
[3:13:54.380 --> 3:13:56.380]  Thanks.
[3:13:56.380 --> 3:13:58.380]  Yeah, I wondered if Obama
[3:13:58.380 --> 3:14:00.380]  acted outside the law as often as he did,
[3:14:00.380 --> 3:14:02.380]  why would we think he wouldn't have, for example,
[3:14:02.380 --> 3:14:04.380]  had the key loggers
[3:14:04.380 --> 3:14:06.380]  and sophisticated surveillance
[3:14:06.380 --> 3:14:08.380]  cell phone interceptors placed within the White House
[3:14:08.380 --> 3:14:10.380]  and then the Obama holdovers
[3:14:10.380 --> 3:14:12.380]  would pretend to sweep it
[3:14:12.380 --> 3:14:14.380]  and, oh, it's clean, Mr. Trump.
[3:14:14.380 --> 3:14:16.380]  Why do we think some of those leaks aren't actually being picked up
[3:14:16.380 --> 3:14:18.380]  from the White House the way
[3:14:18.380 --> 3:14:20.380]  Supreme Court was being surveilled?
[3:14:20.380 --> 3:14:22.380]  Totally. It came out in the news
[3:14:22.380 --> 3:14:24.380]  that he's surveilling thousands of Americans in the election.
[3:14:24.380 --> 3:14:26.380]  It came out in the news
[3:14:26.380 --> 3:14:28.380]  that they were spying on the Senate.
[3:14:28.380 --> 3:14:30.380]  They've all been caught, and then the media
[3:14:30.380 --> 3:14:32.380]  says they're going, it's crazy, it's crazy,
[3:14:32.380 --> 3:14:34.380]  it's crazy, Trump's crazy.
[3:14:34.380 --> 3:14:36.380]  Trump claims the sun is yellow. No, it's true.
[3:14:36.380 --> 3:14:38.380]  It happens. So absolutely, Jim.
[3:14:38.380 --> 3:14:40.380]  What's all this going?
[3:14:40.380 --> 3:14:42.380]  Well, if they can find some
[3:14:42.380 --> 3:14:44.380]  actual hard link to take it back to Obama
[3:14:44.380 --> 3:14:46.380]  and his bunker,
[3:14:46.380 --> 3:14:48.380]  then the public, I think, would get upset.
[3:14:48.380 --> 3:14:50.380]  I don't even think that the corporate media
[3:14:50.380 --> 3:14:52.380]  would be able to cover it up.
[3:14:52.380 --> 3:14:54.380]  Can you imagine,
[3:14:54.380 --> 3:14:56.380]  can you imagine, I almost kept this break
[3:14:56.380 --> 3:14:58.380]  so we have more time.
[3:14:58.380 --> 3:15:00.380]  Can you imagine
[3:15:00.380 --> 3:15:02.380]  being with the president, the Russian
[3:15:02.380 --> 3:15:04.380]  foreign minister, and the Russian ambassador,
[3:15:04.380 --> 3:15:06.380]  and then there's McMaster
[3:15:06.380 --> 3:15:08.380]  and the Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson,
[3:15:08.380 --> 3:15:10.380]  and one other person.
[3:15:10.380 --> 3:15:12.380]  They won't say who it was, Priebus.
[3:15:12.380 --> 3:15:14.380]  Priebus knows he's on the way out.
[3:15:14.380 --> 3:15:16.380]  So does McMaster.
[3:15:16.380 --> 3:15:18.380]  So it's one of those two, probably.
[3:15:18.380 --> 3:15:20.380]  Or it's bugged, like you were just saying, Jim.
[3:15:20.380 --> 3:15:22.380]  And then you hate the president so much.
[3:15:22.380 --> 3:15:24.380]  He's like, hey, great intel on the laptop.
[3:15:24.380 --> 3:15:26.380]  So they'll stop blowing up planes,
[3:15:26.380 --> 3:15:28.380]  and they run out and going,
[3:15:28.380 --> 3:15:30.380]  he just released classified info.
[3:15:30.380 --> 3:15:32.380]  Even though it's been all over the news,
[3:15:32.380 --> 3:15:34.380]  the president, who's allowed to declassify, by the way,
[3:15:34.380 --> 3:15:36.380]  is not even allowed to pat the Russians
[3:15:36.380 --> 3:15:38.380]  on the back about how we're working
[3:15:38.380 --> 3:15:40.380]  to take out ISIS.
[3:15:40.380 --> 3:15:42.380]  That's a globalist creation.
[3:15:42.380 --> 3:15:44.380]  That cow surrounded this president is, Jim.
[3:15:44.380 --> 3:15:46.380]  We're going to pat them to warn
[3:15:46.380 --> 3:15:48.380]  the Russians so they could save
[3:15:48.380 --> 3:15:50.380]  their civilian passengers from threats
[3:15:50.380 --> 3:15:52.380]  from Barris's nuts.
[3:15:52.380 --> 3:15:54.380]  One last question, Alex.
[3:15:54.380 --> 3:15:56.380]  What do you think we're going to do
[3:15:56.380 --> 3:15:58.380]  when this big corporate media
[3:15:58.380 --> 3:16:00.380]  keeps this drum beat up for so long
[3:16:00.380 --> 3:16:02.380]  that some of the Republicans jump on this train?
[3:16:02.380 --> 3:16:04.380]  I mean, it's already starting to happen.
[3:16:04.380 --> 3:16:06.380]  Most of the Republicans are black belted
[3:16:06.380 --> 3:16:08.380]  or controlled in the Senate, and they're already saying
[3:16:08.380 --> 3:16:10.380]  that they think that Trump's wearing
[3:16:10.380 --> 3:16:12.380]  Russian underwear or something. I mean,
[3:16:12.380 --> 3:16:14.380]  it is the craziest load of bull.
[3:16:14.380 --> 3:16:16.380]  It's why he's got to go on the offense.
[3:16:16.380 --> 3:16:18.380]  Hillary's got to be charged for the uranium deal.
[3:16:18.380 --> 3:16:20.380]  She's got to be charged for China.
[3:16:20.380 --> 3:16:22.380]  We've got to lock them up. That's what I tell
[3:16:22.380 --> 3:16:24.380]  the president on the phone when I've talked to him.
[3:16:24.380 --> 3:16:26.380]  Sir, they're not going to stop. They don't want you
[3:16:26.380 --> 3:16:28.380]  to make America great again. They're going to destroy you.
[3:16:28.380 --> 3:16:30.380]  I know you want to be conciliatory. You can't do it.
[3:16:30.380 --> 3:16:32.380]  They want to destroy the image of Americana.
[3:16:32.380 --> 3:16:34.380]  You are in a death battle, sir.
[3:16:34.380 --> 3:16:36.380]  Appreciate your call, Jim. Great points.
[3:16:36.380 --> 3:16:38.380]  You want to either one of you want to comment on that?
[3:16:38.380 --> 3:16:40.380]  No.
[3:16:40.380 --> 3:16:42.380]  Yeah, sure. I mean, this is
[3:16:42.380 --> 3:16:44.380]  exactly what's happening.
[3:16:44.380 --> 3:16:46.380]  The spying is everywhere.
[3:16:46.380 --> 3:16:48.380]  Diane Feinstein, remember her?
[3:16:48.380 --> 3:16:50.380]  C.I.A.
[3:16:50.380 --> 3:16:52.380]  Two years ago, whenever it was,
[3:16:52.380 --> 3:16:54.380]  the C.I.A. is spying on us. How outrageous
[3:16:54.380 --> 3:16:56.380]  and so forth and whatever and whatever.
[3:16:56.380 --> 3:16:58.380]  And then the story just goes away.
[3:16:58.380 --> 3:17:00.380]  Everybody forgets about it because,
[3:17:00.380 --> 3:17:02.380]  you know, they know that C.I.A.
[3:17:02.380 --> 3:17:04.380]  has all kinds of information on them.
[3:17:04.380 --> 3:17:06.380]  And then now they pretend,
[3:17:06.380 --> 3:17:08.380]  well, it's all about Trump. He's lying.
[3:17:08.380 --> 3:17:10.380]  He's delusional. Nobody's spying on anybody.
[3:17:10.380 --> 3:17:12.380]  But we know
[3:17:12.380 --> 3:17:14.380]  that the spying is everywhere.
[3:17:14.380 --> 3:17:16.380]  Multiple agents.
[3:17:16.380 --> 3:17:18.380]  I had a guy, I love Brits, by the way,
[3:17:18.380 --> 3:17:20.380]  a British Canadian come over as he moved there.
[3:17:20.380 --> 3:17:22.380]  And he said, you're a trader.
[3:17:22.380 --> 3:17:24.380]  He said, you're a trader
[3:17:24.380 --> 3:17:26.380]  to Russia, to America.
[3:17:26.380 --> 3:17:28.380]  And I was just like, I was like, hey, Cuck,
[3:17:28.380 --> 3:17:30.380]  you're an idiot. He didn't like that.
[3:17:30.380 --> 3:17:32.380]  I wasn't like, bowing up and I'm like, dude, go ahead, man.
[3:17:32.380 --> 3:17:34.380]  You're calling me
[3:17:34.380 --> 3:17:36.380]  a, I'm selling on America.
[3:17:36.380 --> 3:17:38.380]  You're not even American and you're in my face
[3:17:38.380 --> 3:17:40.380]  arrogantly telling me that I'm a Russian
[3:17:40.380 --> 3:17:42.380]  agent, man. I mean, these people are just,
[3:17:42.380 --> 3:17:44.380]  they're just these arrogant dumbasses
[3:17:44.380 --> 3:17:46.380]  because they think they agree with mainstream
[3:17:46.380 --> 3:17:48.380]  TV so they're powerful.
[3:17:48.380 --> 3:17:50.380]  They are delusional.
[3:17:50.380 --> 3:17:52.380]  I agree. They're delusional.
[3:17:52.380 --> 3:17:54.380]  Who is the guy, the professor?
[3:17:54.380 --> 3:17:56.380]  I think you guys were carrying the story.
[3:17:56.380 --> 3:17:58.380]  Weren't you who said, well,
[3:17:58.380 --> 3:18:00.380]  there probably shouldn't have been an American
[3:18:00.380 --> 3:18:02.380]  revolution at all because if there weren't,
[3:18:02.380 --> 3:18:04.380]  America would be nice and peaceful
[3:18:04.380 --> 3:18:06.380]  like Canada is.
[3:18:06.380 --> 3:18:08.380]  Yeah, that's in the New Yorker magazine right now.
[3:18:08.380 --> 3:18:10.380]  It's on infowords.com.
[3:18:10.380 --> 3:18:12.380]  These people are just totally
[3:18:12.380 --> 3:18:14.380]  thatched the traders getting rid of the country,
[3:18:14.380 --> 3:18:16.380]  not us defending it. But again, in their world,
[3:18:16.380 --> 3:18:18.380]  he's a globalist. See, we're
[3:18:18.380 --> 3:18:20.380]  he just walks away. Oh, look, it's a trader.
[3:18:20.380 --> 3:18:22.380]  There's the trader.
[3:18:22.380 --> 3:18:24.380]  I mean, 100 years ago, that guy
[3:18:24.380 --> 3:18:26.380]  had been, you know, laid out.
[3:18:26.380 --> 3:18:28.380]  He's mad that I at least argue.
[3:18:28.380 --> 3:18:30.380]  He's, oh, you know what? I don't talk to you.
[3:18:30.380 --> 3:18:32.380]  I just announced you're a trader.
[3:18:32.380 --> 3:18:34.380]  I'll tell you what, a lot of people
[3:18:34.380 --> 3:18:36.380]  on that side, though, because of all the things
[3:18:36.380 --> 3:18:38.380]  that have come out on the news regarding
[3:18:38.380 --> 3:18:40.380]  you have
[3:18:40.380 --> 3:18:42.380]  actually come over and watched
[3:18:42.380 --> 3:18:44.380]  your stuff and realized that what you're
[3:18:44.380 --> 3:18:46.380]  saying is actually the truth with the
[3:18:46.380 --> 3:18:48.380]  evidence. And I know you've
[3:18:48.380 --> 3:18:50.380]  gained a lot more followers and listeners.
[3:18:50.380 --> 3:18:52.380]  Sure, sure. Let's be clear. The audience is bigger,
[3:18:52.380 --> 3:18:54.380]  but they are really coming after us. I've had probably
[3:18:54.380 --> 3:18:56.380]  14 stations call us.
[3:18:56.380 --> 3:18:58.380]  Some have been on air.
[3:18:58.380 --> 3:19:00.380]  I make Chicago affiliate and they called up and said,
[3:19:00.380 --> 3:19:02.380]  we'll give you half a million dollars. Take them off.
[3:19:02.380 --> 3:19:04.380]  Most stations just can't refuse.
[3:19:04.380 --> 3:19:06.380]  It's just that's how much trouble this country
[3:19:06.380 --> 3:19:08.380]  is in. I mean, they are out to get us.
[3:19:08.380 --> 3:19:10.380]  So as strong as we are, we're kind of like a rocket trying
[3:19:10.380 --> 3:19:12.380]  to get out of the atmosphere. They got missiles
[3:19:12.380 --> 3:19:14.380]  all over us, bullet holes on us.
[3:19:14.380 --> 3:19:16.380]  I mean, we've been tearing the hell up. It's like
[3:19:16.380 --> 3:19:18.380]  Godzilla attacking Tokyo. You know, I mean,
[3:19:18.380 --> 3:19:20.380]  definitely in Latin, Mothra is attacking us.
[3:19:20.380 --> 3:19:22.380]  And we're, I mean, we're kind of winning, but we're
[3:19:22.380 --> 3:19:24.380]  like that green slime pouring out the side of us.
[3:19:24.380 --> 3:19:26.380]  So I just want folks to know we're not, I mean, this
[3:19:26.380 --> 3:19:28.380]  is a real war. Don't you think that people are getting
[3:19:28.380 --> 3:19:30.380]  sick of all the CNN and the MSNBC
[3:19:30.380 --> 3:19:32.380]  and Washington Post
[3:19:32.380 --> 3:19:34.380]  and New York. No, no, absolutely. I'm just saying
[3:19:34.380 --> 3:19:36.380]  if we are like the whole family
[3:19:36.380 --> 3:19:38.380]  here is like, you know,
[3:19:38.380 --> 3:19:40.380]  Godzilla attacking the nuclear reactors.
[3:19:40.380 --> 3:19:42.380]  I mean, let's say Godzilla is a good guy, you know.
[3:19:42.380 --> 3:19:44.380]  The point is, is that we are, we got
[3:19:44.380 --> 3:19:46.380]  all the everybody's attacking
[3:19:46.380 --> 3:19:48.380]  even people that don't, even people that don't
[3:19:48.380 --> 3:19:50.380]  even know who we are, think we're the bad guys
[3:19:50.380 --> 3:19:52.380]  or don't know. That's the whole joke.
[3:19:52.380 --> 3:19:54.380]  Like half the folks are attacking Godzilla. They don't know
[3:19:54.380 --> 3:19:56.380]  he's really the good guy. So it's, it's, it's a total war.
[3:19:56.380 --> 3:19:58.380]  It is. I mean, more than ever
[3:19:58.380 --> 3:20:00.380]  before right now, I mean, I've been, I'm being
[3:20:00.380 --> 3:20:02.380]  attacked as well. Oh, you're attacked every day.
[3:20:02.380 --> 3:20:04.380]  Everybody's being attacked. It's just like,
[3:20:04.380 --> 3:20:06.380]  okay,
[3:20:06.380 --> 3:20:08.380]  we're telling the truth and we have stacks
[3:20:08.380 --> 3:20:10.380]  of documentation. We have our vault.
[3:20:10.380 --> 3:20:12.380]  We're not going to come out. You were in the army
[3:20:12.380 --> 3:20:14.380]  and all sports operations and stuff.
[3:20:14.380 --> 3:20:16.380]  I mean, you, you, you come up with a nice guy.
[3:20:16.380 --> 3:20:18.380]  You're a family guy. You're not a fake tough guy.
[3:20:18.380 --> 3:20:20.380]  But these threats, let me guess, don't mean anything to you.
[3:20:20.380 --> 3:20:22.380]  In fact, does it make you even stronger? It makes me
[3:20:22.380 --> 3:20:24.380]  stronger. Absolutely. Because, you know, we get,
[3:20:24.380 --> 3:20:26.380]  we get a lot of people that come in and say, hey, listen,
[3:20:26.380 --> 3:20:28.380]  and we know you're being attacked. They're saying this
[3:20:28.380 --> 3:20:30.380]  about you. Do you, what do you have?
[3:20:30.380 --> 3:20:32.380]  And so we give them all the documentation.
[3:20:32.380 --> 3:20:34.380]  We prove to them. We've even had fake moles,
[3:20:34.380 --> 3:20:36.380]  fake moles who never even worked here,
[3:20:36.380 --> 3:20:38.380]  then go on the news and say they've worked here
[3:20:38.380 --> 3:20:40.380]  and then make up crap. Right. No, I had people from
[3:20:40.380 --> 3:20:42.380]  my office actually do interviews
[3:20:42.380 --> 3:20:44.380]  that were damaging to us.
[3:20:44.380 --> 3:20:46.380]  So it's, you know, you constantly have to
[3:20:46.380 --> 3:20:48.380]  know who your friends are,
[3:20:48.380 --> 3:20:51.380]  who are, who are around you,
[3:20:51.380 --> 3:20:54.380]  and people that believe in your mission
[3:20:54.380 --> 3:20:56.380]  and people that want to, ultimately,
[3:20:56.380 --> 3:20:58.380]  we're doing this, all of us,
[3:20:58.380 --> 3:21:00.380]  for one thing, to help change
[3:21:00.380 --> 3:21:02.380]  America great again,
[3:21:02.380 --> 3:21:04.380]  to help, help people
[3:21:04.380 --> 3:21:06.380]  change their life because we know
[3:21:06.380 --> 3:21:10.380]  that healthcare is a degrading cancer.
[3:21:10.380 --> 3:21:12.380]  That's right. And we're trying, we're trying to build
[3:21:12.380 --> 3:21:14.380]  a new economy. And we're trying to get people
[3:21:14.380 --> 3:21:16.380]  happy again and non-stressed
[3:21:16.380 --> 3:21:18.380]  and tell people the truth. Here's an example.
[3:21:18.380 --> 3:21:20.380]  And then I got to go to these calls to the fellowship
[3:21:20.380 --> 3:21:22.380]  because I'm taking right before it's time.
[3:21:22.380 --> 3:21:24.380]  He's going to have another hour tomorrow if he wants
[3:21:24.380 --> 3:21:26.380]  because he's a great guy.
[3:21:26.380 --> 3:21:28.380]  Now I've listened to him personally myself,
[3:21:28.380 --> 3:21:30.380]  so I've been a little bit selfish to myself
[3:21:30.380 --> 3:21:32.380]  for taking over the time. Take knockout.
[3:21:32.380 --> 3:21:34.380]  Now I've developed a lot of the products,
[3:21:34.380 --> 3:21:36.380]  where we private label top products with you
[3:21:36.380 --> 3:21:38.380]  and others, but I thought I'm already using
[3:21:38.380 --> 3:21:40.380]  Melatonin. They're all $19.
[3:21:40.380 --> 3:21:42.380]  But I said, these aren't that expensive
[3:21:42.380 --> 3:21:44.380]  products. Why don't we put them all together?
[3:21:44.380 --> 3:21:46.380]  So I came to you and others. I said, is it safe
[3:21:46.380 --> 3:21:48.380]  to put nine different things together at the same strength?
[3:21:48.380 --> 3:21:50.380]  And then you go, absolutely.
[3:21:50.380 --> 3:21:52.380]  So we put it out, private labeled, organic
[3:21:52.380 --> 3:21:54.380]  from a big company in the United States
[3:21:54.380 --> 3:21:56.380]  that made it for us, but it's our own design.
[3:21:56.380 --> 3:21:58.380]  And I talked to
[3:21:58.380 --> 3:22:00.380]  Randall Wilhite, my lawyer
[3:22:00.380 --> 3:22:02.380]  who's a totally healthy guy and doesn't
[3:22:02.380 --> 3:22:04.380]  use drugs and that stuff, but he was on
[3:22:04.380 --> 3:22:06.380]  four different prescription drugs, couldn't sleep,
[3:22:06.380 --> 3:22:08.380]  center, all of it. He's a UT professor
[3:22:08.380 --> 3:22:10.380]  because
[3:22:10.380 --> 3:22:12.380]  he had stayed up so late, so many nights, making himself
[3:22:12.380 --> 3:22:14.380]  stay up, is with brain power
[3:22:14.380 --> 3:22:16.380]  to do cases that he couldn't sleep anymore.
[3:22:16.380 --> 3:22:18.380]  He said, this changed his life. He looks 10 years younger
[3:22:18.380 --> 3:22:20.380]  and he's got, he buys
[3:22:20.380 --> 3:22:22.380]  cases of knockout, takes only one
[3:22:22.380 --> 3:22:24.380]  of nine, but he loves it and says
[3:22:24.380 --> 3:22:26.380]  why does it work so good? Because we
[3:22:26.380 --> 3:22:28.380]  put all of mother nature stuff together
[3:22:28.380 --> 3:22:30.380]  in one product.
[3:22:30.380 --> 3:22:32.380]  It's all about helping people.
[3:22:32.380 --> 3:22:34.380]  That's what it all comes down to. Yeah, then we finally operate
[3:22:34.380 --> 3:22:36.380]  in helping people and how you
[3:22:36.380 --> 3:22:38.380]  do that. You're giving people the products
[3:22:38.380 --> 3:22:40.380]  that they need, that they want to address
[3:22:40.380 --> 3:22:42.380]  the main issues
[3:22:42.380 --> 3:22:44.380]  that they're suffering from right now. And like
[3:22:44.380 --> 3:22:46.380]  you said,
[3:22:46.380 --> 3:22:48.380]  these are individuals that really
[3:22:48.380 --> 3:22:50.380]  believe in you, that want to support
[3:22:50.380 --> 3:22:52.380]  the organization.
[3:22:52.380 --> 3:22:54.380]  They understand what's going on
[3:22:54.380 --> 3:22:56.380]  around them. They understand that they're being
[3:22:56.380 --> 3:22:58.380]  poisoned. They understand that they're being lied to
[3:22:58.380 --> 3:23:00.380]  and they want
[3:23:00.380 --> 3:23:02.380]  to support you to get that
[3:23:02.380 --> 3:23:04.380]  information. Because they're supporting themselves. I want to go to Sam and Tim.
[3:23:04.380 --> 3:23:06.380]  Yeah, and then they tell their friends
[3:23:06.380 --> 3:23:08.380]  and their friends and their friends and they share
[3:23:08.380 --> 3:23:10.380]  and they, you know, now on the internet, the digital age.
[3:23:10.380 --> 3:23:12.380]  And it's exponential
[3:23:12.380 --> 3:23:14.380]  and the establishment's scared.
[3:23:14.380 --> 3:23:16.380]  Report briefly. Don't take these calls and let
[3:23:16.380 --> 3:23:18.380]  you take over. What are they going to do?
[3:23:18.380 --> 3:23:20.380]  Because forget enforcers. I've talked about us because they're always
[3:23:20.380 --> 3:23:22.380]  misbranding us, attacking us, trying to destroy us.
[3:23:22.380 --> 3:23:24.380]  So I have to defend our, you know, I mean defend us
[3:23:24.380 --> 3:23:26.380]  a few minutes every hour. But the globalists, as you said
[3:23:26.380 --> 3:23:28.380]  are clearly losing ground. They admit
[3:23:28.380 --> 3:23:30.380]  they're panicking. World governments collapsing.
[3:23:30.380 --> 3:23:32.380]  It's unelected. Even if they were
[3:23:32.380 --> 3:23:34.380]  successful in destroying you or
[3:23:34.380 --> 3:23:36.380]  I or, you know, anybody
[3:23:36.380 --> 3:23:38.380]  or Donald Trump, none of us are perfect.
[3:23:38.380 --> 3:23:40.380]  Don't they
[3:23:40.380 --> 3:23:42.380]  get that they're losing a battle? I see the elites
[3:23:42.380 --> 3:23:44.380]  moving to all these redoubts, all these
[3:23:44.380 --> 3:23:46.380]  Pacific islands they admit in their own
[3:23:46.380 --> 3:23:48.380]  internal documents. They believe they've already
[3:23:48.380 --> 3:23:50.380]  lost. So why don't they just give up
[3:23:50.380 --> 3:23:52.380]  and try to be good guys? Where do you see this going?
[3:23:52.380 --> 3:23:54.380]  Well, they're not going to give up.
[3:23:54.380 --> 3:23:56.380]  They're going to keep going anyway.
[3:23:56.380 --> 3:23:58.380]  They're, you know, it's one of these points
[3:23:58.380 --> 3:24:00.380]  of no return. Well, we can't turn around
[3:24:00.380 --> 3:24:02.380]  now. I mean, what are we going to do? Just
[3:24:02.380 --> 3:24:04.380]  suddenly disappear and say,
[3:24:04.380 --> 3:24:06.380]  gee, you know, we were trying to deceive
[3:24:06.380 --> 3:24:08.380]  you for decades and
[3:24:08.380 --> 3:24:10.380]  decades and we failed and we're
[3:24:10.380 --> 3:24:12.380]  sorry and we're going away.
[3:24:12.380 --> 3:24:14.380]  You know, they can't do that.
[3:24:14.380 --> 3:24:16.380]  It's like, you know, when the FDA
[3:24:16.380 --> 3:24:18.380]  puts out a drug and
[3:24:18.380 --> 3:24:20.380]  it starts killing people and then another one
[3:24:20.380 --> 3:24:22.380]  and another one, the FDA can't
[3:24:22.380 --> 3:24:24.380]  say, gee, we're sorry we did that.
[3:24:24.380 --> 3:24:26.380]  It's always got to be a story
[3:24:26.380 --> 3:24:28.380]  why it happened this and that.
[3:24:28.380 --> 3:24:30.380]  So they're going to keep on trying.
[3:24:30.380 --> 3:24:32.380]  They're going to keep on going.
[3:24:32.380 --> 3:24:34.380]  They're going to keep on destroying
[3:24:34.380 --> 3:24:36.380]  as much as possible.
[3:24:36.380 --> 3:24:38.380]  But the consciousness
[3:24:38.380 --> 3:24:40.380]  battle is already lost.
[3:24:40.380 --> 3:24:42.380]  People recognize, I mean, come on,
[3:24:42.380 --> 3:24:44.380]  a one world government.
[3:24:44.380 --> 3:24:46.380]  What in lunatic
[3:24:46.380 --> 3:24:48.380]  would think up that idea
[3:24:48.380 --> 3:24:50.380]  and think that they could really sell it?
[3:24:50.380 --> 3:24:52.380]  Who's going to buy it? I can barely run
[3:24:52.380 --> 3:24:54.380]  an operation with 70 people.
[3:24:54.380 --> 3:24:56.380]  Imagine trying one world
[3:24:56.380 --> 3:24:58.380]  a secret unelected government too.
[3:24:58.380 --> 3:25:00.380]  OK, the three of us are in charge of the planet.
[3:25:00.380 --> 3:25:02.380]  OK, get started boys
[3:25:02.380 --> 3:25:04.380]  and let's see what you're going to do.
[3:25:04.380 --> 3:25:06.380]  Sure, I mean, even if
[3:25:06.380 --> 3:25:08.380]  we had the best of motives.
[3:25:08.380 --> 3:25:10.380]  It'd be a disaster.
[3:25:10.380 --> 3:25:12.380]  Yeah, you know, within 24 hours
[3:25:12.380 --> 3:25:14.380]  there would be suicides from
[3:25:14.380 --> 3:25:16.380]  wall to wall because people would say
[3:25:16.380 --> 3:25:18.380]  I can't even understand
[3:25:18.380 --> 3:25:20.380]  the complexities of what's going on here.
[3:25:20.380 --> 3:25:22.380]  You know, can't we go back
[3:25:22.380 --> 3:25:24.380]  to separate countries and local communities
[3:25:24.380 --> 3:25:26.380]  where people can actually
[3:25:26.380 --> 3:25:28.380]  look at each other and recognize
[3:25:28.380 --> 3:25:30.380]  they're all alive instead of running
[3:25:30.380 --> 3:25:32.380]  everything like a giant machine?
[3:25:32.380 --> 3:25:34.380]  I mean, that's what people ought to have low control.
[3:25:34.380 --> 3:25:36.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:25:36.380 --> 3:25:38.380]  That's it. You got to have on the ground
[3:25:38.380 --> 3:25:40.380]  micro economy, not this big
[3:25:40.380 --> 3:25:42.380]  top down thing.
[3:25:42.380 --> 3:25:44.380]  We can have big roads and agreements
[3:25:44.380 --> 3:25:46.380]  and passports, the systems we need to interconnect in this
[3:25:46.380 --> 3:25:48.380]  but not central control where
[3:25:48.380 --> 3:25:50.380]  they make a decision in Zurich
[3:25:50.380 --> 3:25:52.380]  and arrest Amish people because
[3:25:52.380 --> 3:25:54.380]  they made milk for their neighbors, you know, some cheese.
[3:25:54.380 --> 3:25:56.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:25:56.380 --> 3:25:58.380]  Great point. Sam in Louisiana,
[3:25:58.380 --> 3:26:00.380]  you're on the air with John Rebberport. Go ahead.
[3:26:00.380 --> 3:26:02.380]  I always feel like
[3:26:02.380 --> 3:26:04.380]  I'm walking among giants when I get on.
[3:26:04.380 --> 3:26:06.380]  Oh, please.
[3:26:06.380 --> 3:26:08.380]  You're the giant, Sam. Go ahead.
[3:26:08.380 --> 3:26:10.380]  Ah, man, hell,
[3:26:10.380 --> 3:26:12.380]  Dr. Gruper, if I ever get a chance to meet you in person
[3:26:12.380 --> 3:26:14.380]  I'm afraid of my crying your shoulder,
[3:26:14.380 --> 3:26:16.380]  man, because hug you and cry.
[3:26:16.380 --> 3:26:18.380]  You are tremendous,
[3:26:18.380 --> 3:26:20.380]  the products you've given us.
[3:26:20.380 --> 3:26:22.380]  He helped M4s expand
[3:26:22.380 --> 3:26:24.380]  Dr. Grup and his research in helping us
[3:26:24.380 --> 3:26:26.380]  with other big companies as our advisor
[3:26:26.380 --> 3:26:28.380]  is the reason M4s is even here today.
[3:26:28.380 --> 3:26:30.380]  Well, I mean...
[3:26:30.380 --> 3:26:32.380]  No, I'm serious. Go, Jack.
[3:26:32.380 --> 3:26:34.380]  Well, I appreciate that. I mean, it's
[3:26:34.380 --> 3:26:36.380]  it's just something that I've dedicated
[3:26:36.380 --> 3:26:38.380]  my life to. So
[3:26:38.380 --> 3:26:40.380]  what kind of question do you have
[3:26:40.380 --> 3:26:42.380]  for me, Sam?
[3:26:42.380 --> 3:26:44.380]  Yeah, I've been using your deep cleanse
[3:26:44.380 --> 3:26:46.380]  and it has a syllogy. I was really impressed
[3:26:46.380 --> 3:26:48.380]  with that. With the new product,
[3:26:48.380 --> 3:26:50.380]  does this kind of take its place?
[3:26:50.380 --> 3:26:52.380]  Or, you know, what
[3:26:52.380 --> 3:26:54.380]  can I, you know,
[3:26:54.380 --> 3:26:56.380]  do they work and... Here's the big rocket science.
[3:26:56.380 --> 3:26:58.380]  It's basically the similar product
[3:26:58.380 --> 3:27:00.380]  just a different formulation.
[3:27:00.380 --> 3:27:02.380]  Yes, yes, yes.
[3:27:02.380 --> 3:27:04.380]  So that's a good question.
[3:27:04.380 --> 3:27:06.380]  This is kind of an upgraded deep cleanse.
[3:27:06.380 --> 3:27:08.380]  What was happening is
[3:27:08.380 --> 3:27:10.380]  a lot of people were taking the X2
[3:27:10.380 --> 3:27:12.380]  and we also had the iodine
[3:27:12.380 --> 3:27:14.380]  in the deep cleanse.
[3:27:14.380 --> 3:27:16.380]  So people
[3:27:16.380 --> 3:27:18.380]  didn't know if they were getting too much iodine
[3:27:18.380 --> 3:27:20.380]  or not. So what we did was we modified...
[3:27:20.380 --> 3:27:22.380]  We put a sphinger on it. This is deep cleanse
[3:27:22.380 --> 3:27:24.380]  but with concentrated zeolites for the iodine.
[3:27:24.380 --> 3:27:26.380]  Yes, so we took and we used actually
[3:27:26.380 --> 3:27:28.380]  a rare plant called tamarind
[3:27:28.380 --> 3:27:30.380]  and that is specifically that we found
[3:27:30.380 --> 3:27:32.380]  in clinical trials designed
[3:27:32.380 --> 3:27:34.380]  to also
[3:27:34.380 --> 3:27:36.380]  help remove some of those
[3:27:36.380 --> 3:27:38.380]  halogens from the body. And just to be clear,
[3:27:38.380 --> 3:27:40.380]  we then in M4's
[3:27:40.380 --> 3:27:42.380]  life didn't just continue that on. We made something
[3:27:42.380 --> 3:27:44.380]  better. We quietly pulled it back
[3:27:44.380 --> 3:27:46.380]  and now there's this. And our mission
[3:27:46.380 --> 3:27:48.380]  is to constantly improve.
[3:27:48.380 --> 3:27:50.380]  How many products have we pulled back
[3:27:50.380 --> 3:27:52.380]  to add something better? We always do that.
[3:27:52.380 --> 3:27:54.380]  We do that and we're continually doing that.
[3:27:54.380 --> 3:27:56.380]  We are about to unleash
[3:27:56.380 --> 3:27:58.380]  un-revolutionary innovations
[3:27:58.380 --> 3:28:00.380]  in natural health. I mean, all of these
[3:28:00.380 --> 3:28:02.380]  products will go
[3:28:02.380 --> 3:28:04.380]  just continue to improve as technology
[3:28:04.380 --> 3:28:06.380]  improves and be the next generation
[3:28:06.380 --> 3:28:08.380]  and the next generation and the next
[3:28:08.380 --> 3:28:10.380]  generation. And sometimes then we can't find
[3:28:10.380 --> 3:28:12.380]  organic anymore. We have to remove it
[3:28:12.380 --> 3:28:14.380]  and put something else in it. That's happened too. Thank you, Sam. Love you.
[3:28:14.380 --> 3:28:16.380]  Tim in Seattle, last call I got time. I'll try to get to Larry,
[3:28:16.380 --> 3:28:18.380]  but I want I want Rabbi Port to be able to take over
[3:28:18.380 --> 3:28:20.380]  here. I'm kind of hogging the show. I'm famous for that.
[3:28:20.380 --> 3:28:22.380]  Tim in Seattle, go ahead.
[3:28:22.380 --> 3:28:24.380]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[3:28:24.380 --> 3:28:26.380]  I have three un-vaccinated kids
[3:28:26.380 --> 3:28:28.380]  and the lies and hype
[3:28:28.380 --> 3:28:30.380]  that everybody's been telling.
[3:28:30.380 --> 3:28:32.380]  Oh yeah, I put my flesh
[3:28:32.380 --> 3:28:34.380]  where my mouth is. You know, I got four children.
[3:28:34.380 --> 3:28:36.380]  They've never had any of it. They're healthy.
[3:28:36.380 --> 3:28:38.380]  Well, it's because of you.
[3:28:38.380 --> 3:28:40.380]  I trusted you and I did the research.
[3:28:40.380 --> 3:28:42.380]  It was your delivery.
[3:28:42.380 --> 3:28:44.380]  It spoke to me and resonated with me
[3:28:44.380 --> 3:28:46.380]  and thank you for that.
[3:28:46.380 --> 3:28:48.380]  What I really wanted to call about
[3:28:48.380 --> 3:28:50.380]  was
[3:28:50.380 --> 3:28:52.380]  what's the
[3:28:52.380 --> 3:28:54.380]  leadership, the lack of leadership in America
[3:28:54.380 --> 3:28:56.380]  we have, we elected a president.
[3:28:56.380 --> 3:28:58.380]  We need him to meet
[3:28:58.380 --> 3:29:00.380]  this army of sedition.
[3:29:00.380 --> 3:29:02.380]  We need to lock her up.
[3:29:02.380 --> 3:29:04.380]  Hillary Clinton needs to lock her up.
[3:29:04.380 --> 3:29:06.380]  No, I hear you. He's under such sedition though.
[3:29:06.380 --> 3:29:08.380]  He can't even, he's trying.
[3:29:08.380 --> 3:29:10.380]  There's an article today where they're, you know,
[3:29:10.380 --> 3:29:12.380]  they're very scared inside the White House
[3:29:12.380 --> 3:29:14.380]  when we look for it because Trump's yelling at him saying
[3:29:14.380 --> 3:29:16.380]  you get this fixture, you're gone, you know,
[3:29:16.380 --> 3:29:18.380]  you hire the people, you follow what I say
[3:29:18.380 --> 3:29:20.380]  or you're removed. So he's actually
[3:29:20.380 --> 3:29:22.380]  doing that and when we come back
[3:29:22.380 --> 3:29:24.380]  I'm gone and I'm going to ask
[3:29:24.380 --> 3:29:26.380]  Rappaport to say what he thinks Trump should do
[3:29:26.380 --> 3:29:28.380]  to get the ball rolling. He's already done a lot.
[3:29:28.380 --> 3:29:30.380]  That's why they want to kill him.
[3:29:30.380 --> 3:29:32.380]  But what is Rappaport? He's a really smart cookie
[3:29:32.380 --> 3:29:34.380]  of NoMoreFakeNews.com. What does he think?
[3:29:34.380 --> 3:29:36.380]  Yeah, 15 years ago, he's an investigative journalist
[3:29:36.380 --> 3:29:38.380]  for 30 years. He launched NoMoreFakeNews.com
[3:29:38.380 --> 3:29:40.380]  and notice that's the term they use today.
[3:29:40.380 --> 3:29:42.380]  We are the Trailblazers.
[3:29:42.380 --> 3:29:44.380]  John Rappaport, straight ahead.
[3:29:44.380 --> 3:29:46.380]  I don't want to thank you, Donna. Great job.
[3:29:46.380 --> 3:29:48.380]  All right, thanks for having me.
[3:29:48.380 --> 3:30:05.380]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:30:05.380 --> 3:30:07.380]  In America, we don't worship government.
[3:30:07.380 --> 3:30:10.380]  We worship God. And it's why we proudly proclaim
[3:30:10.380 --> 3:30:13.380]  that we are one nation under God.
[3:30:13.380 --> 3:30:16.380]  Every time we say the pledge of allegiance.
[3:30:16.380 --> 3:30:18.380]  Which God exactly has he invoked?
[3:30:18.380 --> 3:30:20.380]  Was it the God of Hillary Clinton?
[3:30:20.380 --> 3:30:22.380]  Rich people, God bless us.
[3:30:22.380 --> 3:30:25.380]  Or was it the God of Barack Hussein Obama?
[3:30:25.380 --> 3:30:27.380]  God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.
[3:30:27.380 --> 3:30:30.380]  No, President Trump has called on the one true God
[3:30:30.380 --> 3:30:33.380]  of the universe, whose name is above every name.
[3:30:33.380 --> 3:30:35.380]  Champions for Christ.
[3:30:35.380 --> 3:30:37.380]  He testified to the greatest pieces of literature
[3:30:37.380 --> 3:30:39.380]  in the history of mankind because of the power
[3:30:39.380 --> 3:30:41.380]  contained within the words of this book.
[3:30:41.380 --> 3:30:44.380]  You are living witness of the gospel message
[3:30:44.380 --> 3:30:46.380]  of faith, hope, and love.
[3:30:46.380 --> 3:30:48.380]  Even the most remote areas of India,
[3:30:48.380 --> 3:30:50.380]  and especially Africa, have heard of him.
[3:30:50.380 --> 3:30:53.380]  Jesus Christ has been preached in and is believed on
[3:30:53.380 --> 3:30:55.380]  in all nations of the world.
[3:30:55.380 --> 3:30:57.380]  Our God is not like their God.
[3:30:57.380 --> 3:30:59.380]  This has been Daria for Infos.com.

[3:31:58.380 --> 3:32:00.380]  Today we call it Bone Broth.
[3:32:00.380 --> 3:32:02.380]  And for thousands of years,
[3:32:02.380 --> 3:32:04.380]  our ancestors enjoyed its benefits
[3:32:04.380 --> 3:32:06.380]  before it became a loss to our modern diets
[3:32:06.380 --> 3:32:08.380]  of processed junk.
[3:32:08.380 --> 3:32:10.380]  We are now introducing Caveman
[3:32:10.380 --> 3:32:12.380]  by InfowarsLife.com.
[3:32:12.380 --> 3:32:14.380]  The ultimate and true paleo nutrition
[3:32:14.380 --> 3:32:16.380]  with bone broth, turmeric root, chaga mushroom
[3:32:16.380 --> 3:32:18.380]  and seven total primal superfoods
[3:32:18.380 --> 3:32:20.380]  in a single great-tasting formula.
[3:32:20.380 --> 3:32:22.380]  Caveman.
[3:32:22.380 --> 3:32:24.380]  It's those people living in the wilds
[3:32:24.380 --> 3:32:26.380]  having to actually build civilization
[3:32:26.380 --> 3:32:28.380]  that are our superior ancestors.
[3:32:28.380 --> 3:32:30.380]  And we need to do everything we can to recapture that.
[3:32:30.380 --> 3:32:32.380]  Everyone knew that you used all the parts
[3:32:32.380 --> 3:32:34.380]  of the animal. You used the meat for sustenance,
[3:32:34.380 --> 3:32:36.380]  the fat for cooking.
[3:32:36.380 --> 3:32:38.380]  The bones for strength.
[3:32:38.380 --> 3:32:40.380]  From the outside structure full of minerals
[3:32:40.380 --> 3:32:42.380]  and key cofactors to the marrow
[3:32:42.380 --> 3:32:44.380]  that produces the blood for the body,
[3:32:44.380 --> 3:32:46.380]  this is the engine of the life essence.
[3:32:46.380 --> 3:32:48.380]  I'm a long way from the Caveman
[3:32:48.380 --> 3:32:50.380]  my ancestors were, but I'm sure as well
[3:32:50.380 --> 3:32:52.380]  trying to get back to that essence
[3:32:52.380 --> 3:32:54.380]  that made us what we were. And this is a big part of it.
[3:32:54.380 --> 3:32:56.380]  I know you're going to want to check out
[3:32:56.380 --> 3:32:58.380]  Caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[3:32:58.380 --> 3:33:08.380]  and your community.
[3:33:08.380 --> 3:33:12.380]  Well I won't back down
[3:33:12.380 --> 3:33:16.380]  no I won't back down
[3:33:16.380 --> 3:33:19.380]  you can stand me up
[3:33:19.380 --> 3:33:21.380]  at the gates of hell
[3:33:21.380 --> 3:33:25.380]  but I won't back down
[3:33:25.380 --> 3:33:29.380]  gonna stand my ground
[3:33:29.380 --> 3:33:31.380]  John Rappaport sitting in for Alex
[3:33:31.380 --> 3:33:33.380]  here in the fourth hour at info wars
[3:33:33.380 --> 3:33:35.380]  before the break
[3:33:35.380 --> 3:33:37.380]  started talking a little bit about
[3:33:37.380 --> 3:33:39.380]  what does Trump need to do
[3:33:39.380 --> 3:33:41.380]  I started writing about this I don't know
[3:33:41.380 --> 3:33:43.380]  last summer
[3:33:43.380 --> 3:33:45.380]  populist candidate
[3:33:45.380 --> 3:33:47.380]  lots of people behind it
[3:33:47.380 --> 3:33:49.380]  lots of different people
[3:33:49.380 --> 3:33:51.380]  they want freedom
[3:33:51.380 --> 3:33:53.380]  they want jobs
[3:33:53.380 --> 3:33:55.380]  they want all kinds of things
[3:33:55.380 --> 3:33:57.380]  they think
[3:33:57.380 --> 3:33:59.380]  they believe
[3:33:59.380 --> 3:34:01.380]  that this candidate can do something for them
[3:34:01.380 --> 3:34:03.380]  and he says he will
[3:34:03.380 --> 3:34:05.380]  and he comes out of nowhere
[3:34:05.380 --> 3:34:07.380]  and he's telling the media
[3:34:07.380 --> 3:34:09.380]  that there are a bunch of idiots never happened before
[3:34:09.380 --> 3:34:11.380]  and modern presidency
[3:34:11.380 --> 3:34:13.380]  candidates you know
[3:34:13.380 --> 3:34:15.380]  you're idiots you're liars
[3:34:15.380 --> 3:34:17.380]  okay
[3:34:17.380 --> 3:34:19.380]  so what I started writing about was this
[3:34:19.380 --> 3:34:21.380]  alright if you're this guy Trump
[3:34:21.380 --> 3:34:23.380]  and you have to establish your own
[3:34:23.380 --> 3:34:25.380]  live streaming web channel
[3:34:25.380 --> 3:34:27.380]  directly to the people
[3:34:27.380 --> 3:34:29.380]  forget the media
[3:34:29.380 --> 3:34:31.380]  go back to the people
[3:34:31.380 --> 3:34:33.380]  every day every two days
[3:34:33.380 --> 3:34:35.380]  on and on
[3:34:35.380 --> 3:34:37.380]  be very specific
[3:34:37.380 --> 3:34:39.380]  tell them what you're doing
[3:34:39.380 --> 3:34:41.380]  tell them why you're doing it
[3:34:41.380 --> 3:34:43.380]  tell them how it
[3:34:43.380 --> 3:34:45.380]  syncs up with the promise you make
[3:34:45.380 --> 3:34:47.380]  tell them who the opposition is
[3:34:47.380 --> 3:34:49.380]  by name
[3:34:49.380 --> 3:34:51.380]  oh who's trying to stop this
[3:34:51.380 --> 3:34:53.380]  who's trying to stop bringing jobs
[3:34:53.380 --> 3:34:55.380]  back to America let's go
[3:34:55.380 --> 3:34:57.380]  you know
[3:34:57.380 --> 3:34:59.380]  don't pay any attention to your director
[3:34:59.380 --> 3:35:01.380]  of communications and your chief
[3:35:01.380 --> 3:35:03.380]  bottle washer and
[3:35:03.380 --> 3:35:05.380]  advisor etc etc who cares
[3:35:05.380 --> 3:35:07.380]  you talk directly to the people that's it
[3:35:09.380 --> 3:35:11.380]  it's a live stream
[3:35:11.380 --> 3:35:13.380]  all over the world
[3:35:13.380 --> 3:35:15.380]  media you're going to have to cover it
[3:35:15.380 --> 3:35:17.380]  but you don't even care whether they do or not
[3:35:17.380 --> 3:35:19.380]  talking to the people
[3:35:19.380 --> 3:35:21.380]  about everything specifically that you're trying to do
[3:35:21.380 --> 3:35:23.380]  of course there's a downside to that
[3:35:23.380 --> 3:35:25.380]  because if you say well
[3:35:25.380 --> 3:35:27.380]  five minutes ago I sent missiles into Syria
[3:35:27.380 --> 3:35:29.380]  you're not going to have to explain that
[3:35:29.380 --> 3:35:31.380]  to the people too because they thought
[3:35:31.380 --> 3:35:33.380]  that you were going to
[3:35:33.380 --> 3:35:35.380]  bring the troops home
[3:35:35.380 --> 3:35:37.380]  not going to interfere
[3:35:37.380 --> 3:35:39.380]  we want to make America
[3:35:39.380 --> 3:35:41.380]  strong and be able
[3:35:41.380 --> 3:35:43.380]  to defend the borders
[3:35:43.380 --> 3:35:45.380]  something that
[3:35:45.380 --> 3:35:47.380]  Juan Paul was talking about a long time ago
[3:35:47.380 --> 3:35:49.380]  dragged in many many many Americans
[3:35:49.380 --> 3:35:51.380]  who understood the wisdom
[3:35:51.380 --> 3:35:53.380]  of what he was saying about that
[3:35:53.380 --> 3:35:55.380]  and many of those people voted for you
[3:35:55.380 --> 3:35:57.380]  Donald Trump
[3:35:57.380 --> 3:35:59.380]  so go back to the people talk to them on a regular
[3:35:59.380 --> 3:36:01.380]  basis
[3:36:01.380 --> 3:36:03.380]  that is
[3:36:03.380 --> 3:36:05.380]  a grand solution
[3:36:05.380 --> 3:36:07.380]  to all of the insanity going on
[3:36:07.380 --> 3:36:09.380]  in the media and Washington
[3:36:09.380 --> 3:36:11.380]  just have to say something about Scalia
[3:36:11.380 --> 3:36:13.380]  because you were talking about that
[3:36:13.380 --> 3:36:15.380]  in the last
[3:36:15.380 --> 3:36:17.380]  half hour there
[3:36:17.380 --> 3:36:19.380]  without trying to get into
[3:36:19.380 --> 3:36:21.380]  all of the sordid, ridiculous
[3:36:21.380 --> 3:36:23.380]  absurd, insane details
[3:36:23.380 --> 3:36:25.380]  about the handling of his death
[3:36:25.380 --> 3:36:27.380]  when he died
[3:36:29.380 --> 3:36:31.380]  there was no FBI investigation
[3:36:31.380 --> 3:36:33.380]  there was no department
[3:36:33.380 --> 3:36:35.380]  of justice making a move
[3:36:35.380 --> 3:36:37.380]  in any direction to look into anything that had to do
[3:36:37.380 --> 3:36:39.380]  with any possible
[3:36:39.380 --> 3:36:41.380]  reason that he might have died except
[3:36:41.380 --> 3:36:43.380]  from natural causes heart attack
[3:36:43.380 --> 3:36:45.380]  why?
[3:36:45.380 --> 3:36:47.380]  because some judge
[3:36:47.380 --> 3:36:49.380]  vaguely
[3:36:49.380 --> 3:36:51.380]  barely a judge in Texas
[3:36:51.380 --> 3:36:53.380]  gets on the phone with a couple of what
[3:36:53.380 --> 3:36:55.380]  marshals
[3:36:55.380 --> 3:36:57.380]  cops standing over Scalia's body
[3:36:57.380 --> 3:36:59.380]  and they say well it looks like
[3:36:59.380 --> 3:37:01.380]  there's no foul play and she says on the phone
[3:37:01.380 --> 3:37:03.380]  okay great no autopsy
[3:37:03.380 --> 3:37:05.380]  and that's the end of the story
[3:37:05.380 --> 3:37:07.380]  there's many more
[3:37:07.380 --> 3:37:09.380]  insane details but
[3:37:09.380 --> 3:37:11.380]  taking off from that
[3:37:11.380 --> 3:37:13.380]  alright so
[3:37:13.380 --> 3:37:15.380]  one of the most important political figures
[3:37:15.380 --> 3:37:17.380]  in America over the last 30 years
[3:37:17.380 --> 3:37:19.380]  like him, Haydn, doesn't matter
[3:37:19.380 --> 3:37:21.380]  he remains one of the most
[3:37:21.380 --> 3:37:23.380]  important and there is
[3:37:23.380 --> 3:37:25.380]  no
[3:37:25.380 --> 3:37:27.380]  with Obama in the White House
[3:37:27.380 --> 3:37:29.380]  zero interest
[3:37:29.380 --> 3:37:31.380]  by the FBI department of justice
[3:37:31.380 --> 3:37:33.380]  you would think
[3:37:33.380 --> 3:37:35.380]  agents would be crawling all over that ranch
[3:37:35.380 --> 3:37:37.380]  all over that resort
[3:37:37.380 --> 3:37:39.380]  all over the funeral home
[3:37:39.380 --> 3:37:41.380]  a couple hundred miles away
[3:37:41.380 --> 3:37:43.380]  where he was prepared
[3:37:43.380 --> 3:37:45.380]  and bombed, fluids removed
[3:37:45.380 --> 3:37:47.380]  etc etc
[3:37:47.380 --> 3:37:49.380]  nothing, absolutely nothing
[3:37:49.380 --> 3:37:51.380]  zero
[3:37:51.380 --> 3:37:53.380]  got to restrain myself
[3:37:53.380 --> 3:37:55.380]  from using profanity
[3:37:55.380 --> 3:37:57.380]  at this point
[3:37:57.380 --> 3:37:59.380]  look at the Washington Post
[3:37:59.380 --> 3:38:01.380]  the New York Times
[3:38:01.380 --> 3:38:03.380]  they bat an eye at this, they lift a finger
[3:38:03.380 --> 3:38:05.380]  to say why isn't
[3:38:05.380 --> 3:38:07.380]  the federal government investigating
[3:38:07.380 --> 3:38:09.380]  why is the Department of Justice the FBI there
[3:38:09.380 --> 3:38:11.380]  why aren't they doing anything
[3:38:11.380 --> 3:38:13.380]  no of course not
[3:38:13.380 --> 3:38:15.380]  I was an old man
[3:38:15.380 --> 3:38:17.380]  he was sick, he died, okay that's it
[3:38:17.380 --> 3:38:19.380]  moving right along now
[3:38:19.380 --> 3:38:21.380]  here's the latest
[3:38:21.380 --> 3:38:23.380]  from Candy Canes
[3:38:23.380 --> 3:38:25.380]  in Disneyland
[3:38:25.380 --> 3:38:27.380]  alright
[3:38:27.380 --> 3:38:29.380]  yeah
[3:38:29.380 --> 3:38:31.380]  that'll get you worked up, way worked up
[3:38:31.380 --> 3:38:33.380]  just picturing Obama
[3:38:33.380 --> 3:38:35.380]  sitting in the White House
[3:38:35.380 --> 3:38:37.380]  oh, Scalia died, wow
[3:38:37.380 --> 3:38:39.380]  wow
[3:38:39.380 --> 3:38:41.380]  yeah, well, good, I mean sure
[3:38:41.380 --> 3:38:43.380]  I mean, yeah, he died
[3:38:43.380 --> 3:38:45.380]  good, okay, let's leave it alone
[3:38:45.380 --> 3:38:47.380]  I'll give him 30 seconds standing in front
[3:38:47.380 --> 3:38:49.380]  of his portrait at the funeral home
[3:38:49.380 --> 3:38:51.380]  wherever it is, get back to the White House
[3:38:51.380 --> 3:38:53.380]  so I can make a list of
[3:38:53.380 --> 3:38:55.380]  people that I would perhaps
[3:38:55.380 --> 3:38:57.380]  nominate with the Supreme Court
[3:38:57.380 --> 3:38:59.380]  never happened, done
[3:38:59.380 --> 3:39:01.380]  next story, Azure Farms
[3:39:01.380 --> 3:39:03.380]  you ever heard of it? I never have
[3:39:03.380 --> 3:39:05.380]  but apparently there are very large
[3:39:05.380 --> 3:39:07.380]  organic farm operation in Oregon
[3:39:07.380 --> 3:39:09.380]  Sherman County
[3:39:09.380 --> 3:39:11.380]  as of last
[3:39:11.380 --> 3:39:13.380]  I looked, there was zero coverage
[3:39:13.380 --> 3:39:15.380]  in local Oregon papers about this story
[3:39:15.380 --> 3:39:17.380]  and usually
[3:39:17.380 --> 3:39:19.380]  they'll cover a story like this even if they cover it
[3:39:19.380 --> 3:39:21.380]  which they ordinarily do
[3:39:21.380 --> 3:39:23.380]  from the wrong side and lie about it and so forth
[3:39:23.380 --> 3:39:25.380]  they give it some coverage
[3:39:27.380 --> 3:39:29.380]  I've tried to contact the Sherman County
[3:39:29.380 --> 3:39:31.380]  government
[3:39:31.380 --> 3:39:33.380]  get nothing back from them
[3:39:33.380 --> 3:39:35.380]  so here's the story that Azure Farms
[3:39:35.380 --> 3:39:37.380]  tells in a nutshell, 2000
[3:39:37.380 --> 3:39:39.380]  acre farm, only part of their operation
[3:39:39.380 --> 3:39:41.380]  they grow all kinds of
[3:39:41.380 --> 3:39:43.380]  organic food, they've been growing it for years
[3:39:43.380 --> 3:39:45.380]  and years and years and all of a sudden
[3:39:45.380 --> 3:39:47.380]  Sherman County, according to Azure Farms
[3:39:47.380 --> 3:39:49.380]  makes the following decision
[3:39:51.380 --> 3:39:53.380]  you've got some weeds growing there
[3:39:53.380 --> 3:39:55.380]  noxious weeds that you're not controlling
[3:39:55.380 --> 3:39:57.380]  and therefore
[3:39:57.380 --> 3:39:59.380]  we are
[3:39:59.380 --> 3:40:01.380]  considering strongly
[3:40:01.380 --> 3:40:03.380]  very soon
[3:40:03.380 --> 3:40:05.380]  to move in there and spray
[3:40:05.380 --> 3:40:07.380]  round up another pesticides
[3:40:07.380 --> 3:40:09.380]  on your farm land
[3:40:09.380 --> 3:40:11.380]  of course this would totally decertify
[3:40:11.380 --> 3:40:13.380]  the farms being organic
[3:40:13.380 --> 3:40:15.380]  it would mean they would have to spend years trying to bring it back to
[3:40:15.380 --> 3:40:17.380]  organic standards
[3:40:17.380 --> 3:40:19.380]  and they would no longer be selling clean
[3:40:19.380 --> 3:40:21.380]  fresh organic food for a while
[3:40:21.380 --> 3:40:23.380]  a long while
[3:40:23.380 --> 3:40:25.380]  that's all, destroy
[3:40:25.380 --> 3:40:27.380]  a healthy farm
[3:40:27.380 --> 3:40:29.380]  providing healthy food
[3:40:29.380 --> 3:40:31.380]  for many people
[3:40:31.380 --> 3:40:33.380]  destroy a business
[3:40:33.380 --> 3:40:35.380]  why not, because we live in the socialist
[3:40:35.380 --> 3:40:37.380]  paradise, what difference does it make
[3:40:37.380 --> 3:40:39.380]  whatever the shortfall is the government
[3:40:39.380 --> 3:40:41.380]  surely can fix it and no problem
[3:40:43.380 --> 3:40:45.380]  wow
[3:40:45.380 --> 3:40:47.380]  so here's
[3:40:47.380 --> 3:40:49.380]  again
[3:40:49.380 --> 3:40:51.380]  the statement from Azure Farms
[3:40:51.380 --> 3:40:53.380]  claim is
[3:40:53.380 --> 3:40:55.380]  Sherman County is now
[3:40:55.380 --> 3:40:57.380]  reinterpreting the local law
[3:40:57.380 --> 3:40:59.380]  that instead of controlling noxious weeds
[3:40:59.380 --> 3:41:01.380]  you have to eliminate them
[3:41:01.380 --> 3:41:03.380]  well, experience shows us
[3:41:03.380 --> 3:41:05.380]  that Monsanto's round up does not
[3:41:05.380 --> 3:41:07.380]  eliminate weeds
[3:41:07.380 --> 3:41:09.380]  if you've not been living in a cave
[3:41:09.380 --> 3:41:11.380]  for the last 20 years
[3:41:11.380 --> 3:41:13.380]  you know that what's been happening all over the world
[3:41:13.380 --> 3:41:15.380]  is in fact
[3:41:15.380 --> 3:41:17.380]  that the round up
[3:41:17.380 --> 3:41:19.380]  that is sprayed on GMO
[3:41:19.380 --> 3:41:21.380]  crops
[3:41:21.380 --> 3:41:23.380]  kills off some of the weeds
[3:41:23.380 --> 3:41:25.380]  so that the stronger weeds
[3:41:25.380 --> 3:41:27.380]  now become kings
[3:41:27.380 --> 3:41:29.380]  and queens
[3:41:29.380 --> 3:41:31.380]  and spread like crazy
[3:41:31.380 --> 3:41:33.380]  and become virtually uncontrollable
[3:41:33.380 --> 3:41:35.380]  unless you drop
[3:41:35.380 --> 3:41:37.380]  napalm on them
[3:41:37.380 --> 3:41:39.380]  so
[3:41:39.380 --> 3:41:41.380]  but Sherman County thinks that by spraying
[3:41:41.380 --> 3:41:43.380]  they're really going to knock out
[3:41:43.380 --> 3:41:45.380]  the weeds when the weeds apparently
[3:41:45.380 --> 3:41:47.380]  don't even need to be knocked out because
[3:41:47.380 --> 3:41:49.380]  they're being controlled
[3:41:49.380 --> 3:41:51.380]  yes, you can have weeds
[3:41:51.380 --> 3:41:53.380]  on a farm
[3:41:53.380 --> 3:41:55.380]  it's not a threat to life in limb
[3:41:55.380 --> 3:41:57.380]  as long as you can handle it
[3:41:57.380 --> 3:41:59.380]  as long as you can control it
[3:41:59.380 --> 3:42:01.380]  but nevertheless they seem to be moving ahead
[3:42:01.380 --> 3:42:03.380]  and they have a scheduled meeting
[3:42:03.380 --> 3:42:05.380]  or hearing
[3:42:05.380 --> 3:42:07.380]  on May 22nd
[3:42:07.380 --> 3:42:09.380]  and they could move forward
[3:42:09.380 --> 3:42:11.380]  to destroy Azure Farms
[3:42:11.380 --> 3:42:13.380]  yeah, we're going to spray
[3:42:13.380 --> 3:42:15.380]  pesticide everywhere
[3:42:15.380 --> 3:42:17.380]  and the other part of the story is apparently
[3:42:17.380 --> 3:42:19.380]  they are
[3:42:19.380 --> 3:42:21.380]  Sherman County is going to make Azure Farms
[3:42:21.380 --> 3:42:23.380]  pay for this
[3:42:23.380 --> 3:42:25.380]  put a lien on the farm to make sure
[3:42:25.380 --> 3:42:27.380]  that you guys cover the cost of spraying
[3:42:27.380 --> 3:42:29.380]  and the labor and so forth
[3:42:29.380 --> 3:42:31.380]  as we destroy your own business
[3:42:31.380 --> 3:42:33.380]  we want you to pay for it
[3:42:33.380 --> 3:42:35.380]  great
[3:42:35.380 --> 3:42:37.380]  fabulous
[3:42:37.380 --> 3:42:39.380]  next, James Comey
[3:42:39.380 --> 3:42:41.380]  a little bit of a postmortem here for people with short
[3:42:41.380 --> 3:42:43.380]  memories
[3:42:43.380 --> 3:42:45.380]  and short attention span
[3:42:45.380 --> 3:42:47.380]  fired, of course, we know
[3:42:51.380 --> 3:42:53.380]  the echo chamber
[3:42:53.380 --> 3:42:55.380]  in Washington in the media
[3:42:55.380 --> 3:42:57.380]  oh, shock
[3:42:57.380 --> 3:42:59.380]  all amazement, unbelievable
[3:42:59.380 --> 3:43:01.380]  stunning
[3:43:01.380 --> 3:43:03.380]  horrendous, oh my god
[3:43:03.380 --> 3:43:05.380]  how could this have happened
[3:43:07.380 --> 3:43:09.380]  people are just falling down
[3:43:09.380 --> 3:43:11.380]  in the street from the
[3:43:11.380 --> 3:43:13.380]  staggering shock of it all
[3:43:13.380 --> 3:43:15.380]  nah, not really
[3:43:15.380 --> 3:43:17.380]  nah
[3:43:17.380 --> 3:43:19.380]  but let's remember that last summer
[3:43:19.380 --> 3:43:21.380]  Comey
[3:43:21.380 --> 3:43:23.380]  suddenly played, he was the FBI director
[3:43:23.380 --> 3:43:25.380]  he suddenly played
[3:43:25.380 --> 3:43:27.380]  FBI director, attorney general
[3:43:27.380 --> 3:43:29.380]  yeah, he played that role, he played the role of
[3:43:29.380 --> 3:43:31.380]  grand jury
[3:43:31.380 --> 3:43:33.380]  he played the role of investigator
[3:43:33.380 --> 3:43:35.380]  researcher
[3:43:35.380 --> 3:43:37.380]  all of these, maybe a few others
[3:43:37.380 --> 3:43:39.380]  and he stood up and gave a press conference
[3:43:39.380 --> 3:43:41.380]  FBI doesn't do press conferences
[3:43:41.380 --> 3:43:43.380]  the FBI
[3:43:43.380 --> 3:43:45.380]  presents evidence
[3:43:45.380 --> 3:43:47.380]  to the justice department, to the prosecutors
[3:43:47.380 --> 3:43:49.380]  who then decide
[3:43:49.380 --> 3:43:51.380]  whether to prosecute
[3:43:51.380 --> 3:43:53.380]  the accused on the basis of
[3:43:53.380 --> 3:43:55.380]  the evidence, but Comey's going to do a press conference
[3:43:55.380 --> 3:43:57.380]  he's going to stand up
[3:43:57.380 --> 3:43:59.380]  because Loretta Lynch, who was the attorney general
[3:43:59.380 --> 3:44:01.380]  at the time, just
[3:44:01.380 --> 3:44:03.380]  huddled with Bill Clinton
[3:44:03.380 --> 3:44:05.380]  the tarmac of an airport
[3:44:05.380 --> 3:44:07.380]  and so the whole thing, well
[3:44:07.380 --> 3:44:09.380]  she was compromised, sure
[3:44:09.380 --> 3:44:11.380]  so Comey took over
[3:44:11.380 --> 3:44:13.380]  you know
[3:44:13.380 --> 3:44:15.380]  and he said, well, essentially this is what he said
[3:44:15.380 --> 3:44:17.380]  Hillary, in the handling of
[3:44:17.380 --> 3:44:19.380]  classified information on her private
[3:44:19.380 --> 3:44:21.380]  email server, which she was not supposed
[3:44:21.380 --> 3:44:23.380]  to have, committed the following
[3:44:23.380 --> 3:44:25.380]  felonies
[3:44:25.380 --> 3:44:27.380]  blah, blah, blah
[3:44:27.380 --> 3:44:29.380]  blah, blah, blah, blah
[3:44:29.380 --> 3:44:31.380]  he checked them off, he enumerated them off
[3:44:31.380 --> 3:44:33.380]  for the audience
[3:44:33.380 --> 3:44:35.380]  right out there in the open
[3:44:35.380 --> 3:44:37.380]  specified what they were
[3:44:37.380 --> 3:44:39.380]  and then he said
[3:44:39.380 --> 3:44:41.380]  but I'm not recommending
[3:44:41.380 --> 3:44:43.380]  you know like
[3:44:43.380 --> 3:44:45.380]  who is he, J. Edgar Hoover
[3:44:45.380 --> 3:44:47.380]  who's got files and everybody in the
[3:44:47.380 --> 3:44:49.380]  government, maybe
[3:44:49.380 --> 3:44:51.380]  I'm not recommending prosecution at this
[3:44:51.380 --> 3:44:53.380]  time because
[3:44:53.380 --> 3:44:55.380]  we saw no intent on Hillary's part
[3:44:55.380 --> 3:44:57.380]  to do harm
[3:44:57.380 --> 3:44:59.380]  to cause harm
[3:44:59.380 --> 3:45:01.380]  or to take a hostile action
[3:45:01.380 --> 3:45:03.380]  when he very well knew
[3:45:03.380 --> 3:45:05.380]  as well as thousands of other
[3:45:05.380 --> 3:45:07.380]  people at that second that the law
[3:45:07.380 --> 3:45:09.380]  that pertained to this
[3:45:09.380 --> 3:45:11.380]  was written specifically
[3:45:11.380 --> 3:45:13.380]  to cover negligence
[3:45:13.380 --> 3:45:15.380]  in the handling of classified materials
[3:45:15.380 --> 3:45:17.380]  negligence, only
[3:45:17.380 --> 3:45:19.380]  that part of the law
[3:45:19.380 --> 3:45:21.380]  so there would be no confusion
[3:45:21.380 --> 3:45:23.380]  about the issue of intent
[3:45:23.380 --> 3:45:25.380]  that negligence alone
[3:45:25.380 --> 3:45:27.380]  rated as a felony
[3:45:27.380 --> 3:45:29.380]  and therefore prosecutable
[3:45:29.380 --> 3:45:31.380]  with fines and jail time
[3:45:31.380 --> 3:45:33.380]  but
[3:45:35.380 --> 3:45:37.380]  no bill, no decision
[3:45:37.380 --> 3:45:39.380]  no prosecution and the justice
[3:45:39.380 --> 3:45:41.380]  department bowed down and went right along
[3:45:41.380 --> 3:45:43.380]  this is James Comey
[3:45:43.380 --> 3:45:45.380]  and he was also of course
[3:45:45.380 --> 3:45:47.380]  connected to the HSBC money laundering
[3:45:47.380 --> 3:45:49.380]  for drug cartels
[3:45:49.380 --> 3:45:51.380]  bank in 2013
[3:45:51.380 --> 3:45:53.380]  when he was brought on board
[3:45:53.380 --> 3:45:55.380]  to clean up that whole mess
[3:45:55.380 --> 3:45:57.380]  aka
[3:45:57.380 --> 3:45:59.380]  put an honest face
[3:45:59.380 --> 3:46:01.380]  on the bank
[3:46:01.380 --> 3:46:03.380]  Mr. Comey is here
[3:46:03.380 --> 3:46:05.380]  all will be well but yet just several years
[3:46:05.380 --> 3:46:07.380]  after he left somehow
[3:46:07.380 --> 3:46:09.380]  mysteriously apparently he didn't take care of everything
[3:46:09.380 --> 3:46:11.380]  because
[3:46:11.380 --> 3:46:13.380]  as the New York Times
[3:46:13.380 --> 3:46:15.380]  other media outlets
[3:46:15.380 --> 3:46:17.380]  have written
[3:46:17.380 --> 3:46:19.380]  2016, HSBC
[3:46:19.380 --> 3:46:21.380]  wow, they've got another problem
[3:46:21.380 --> 3:46:23.380]  that involves currency manipulation
[3:46:23.380 --> 3:46:25.380]  of
[3:46:25.380 --> 3:46:27.380]  $3.5 billion
[3:46:27.380 --> 3:46:29.380]  tidy sum
[3:46:29.380 --> 3:46:31.380]  so Comey didn't do very well there
[3:46:31.380 --> 3:46:33.380]  at a minimum he didn't do very well
[3:46:33.380 --> 3:46:35.380]  whether there was more hanky-panky
[3:46:35.380 --> 3:46:37.380]  that's not for grabs, that's a story
[3:46:37.380 --> 3:46:39.380]  okay
[3:46:39.380 --> 3:46:41.380]  what else do we have here
[3:46:41.380 --> 3:46:43.380]  New Study shows
[3:46:43.380 --> 3:46:45.380]  FDA approved drugs
[3:46:45.380 --> 3:46:47.380]  between the year 2010
[3:46:47.380 --> 3:46:49.380]  that would be 222 drugs
[3:46:49.380 --> 3:46:51.380]  a third of these
[3:46:53.380 --> 3:46:55.380]  were revealed
[3:46:55.380 --> 3:46:57.380]  later on
[3:46:57.380 --> 3:46:59.380]  to cause extreme
[3:46:59.380 --> 3:47:01.380]  and severe adverse reactions
[3:47:01.380 --> 3:47:03.380]  such as
[3:47:03.380 --> 3:47:05.380]  death, death for example
[3:47:05.380 --> 3:47:07.380]  which
[3:47:07.380 --> 3:47:09.380]  the last time I looked would be classified
[3:47:09.380 --> 3:47:11.380]  as an adverse reaction
[3:47:11.380 --> 3:47:13.380]  yep, one third of all
[3:47:13.380 --> 3:47:15.380]  the FDA drugs approved of course
[3:47:15.380 --> 3:47:17.380]  the FDA has nothing to say about this
[3:47:17.380 --> 3:47:19.380]  nothing important like
[3:47:19.380 --> 3:47:21.380]  it's our fault we did this
[3:47:21.380 --> 3:47:23.380]  we kill people with the drugs
[3:47:23.380 --> 3:47:25.380]  right? no
[3:47:25.380 --> 3:47:27.380]  they don't say that, absolutely not
[3:47:29.380 --> 3:47:31.380]  and they get away with it
[3:47:31.380 --> 3:47:33.380]  cause the Department of Justice you see
[3:47:35.380 --> 3:47:37.380]  could come over there
[3:47:37.380 --> 3:47:39.380]  with agents
[3:47:39.380 --> 3:47:41.380]  and little things called handclubs
[3:47:41.380 --> 3:47:43.380]  and they could make arrests and they could bring these people up on charges
[3:47:43.380 --> 3:47:45.380]  and they could begin to dig around
[3:47:45.380 --> 3:47:47.380]  and this and find
[3:47:47.380 --> 3:47:49.380]  you know, easy
[3:47:49.380 --> 3:47:51.380]  I found it
[3:47:51.380 --> 3:47:53.380]  evidence of
[3:47:53.380 --> 3:47:55.380]  at least what you would call
[3:47:55.380 --> 3:47:57.380]  reckless endangerment
[3:47:57.380 --> 3:47:59.380]  at least what you would call
[3:47:59.380 --> 3:48:01.380]  negligent homicide
[3:48:01.380 --> 3:48:03.380]  at least what you would call
[3:48:03.380 --> 3:48:05.380]  when you're really looking at it straight on
[3:48:05.380 --> 3:48:07.380]  premeditated
[3:48:07.380 --> 3:48:09.380]  murder
[3:48:09.380 --> 3:48:11.380]  and arrest many employees of the
[3:48:11.380 --> 3:48:13.380]  FDA, put them on trial
[3:48:13.380 --> 3:48:15.380]  and put them in jail for life without the possibility
[3:48:15.380 --> 3:48:17.380]  of parole, I mean
[3:48:17.380 --> 3:48:19.380]  that is a slam dunk case
[3:48:19.380 --> 3:48:21.380]  where you really look at the evidence
[3:48:21.380 --> 3:48:23.380]  and the evidence is out in the open
[3:48:23.380 --> 3:48:25.380]  I know because I put some of it out
[3:48:25.380 --> 3:48:27.380]  in the open
[3:48:27.380 --> 3:48:29.380]  over the last 15 years
[3:48:31.380 --> 3:48:33.380]  but the Department of Justice says nothing
[3:48:33.380 --> 3:48:35.380]  thereby giving the Americans
[3:48:35.380 --> 3:48:37.380]  the impression
[3:48:37.380 --> 3:48:39.380]  that these agencies
[3:48:39.380 --> 3:48:41.380]  are immune somehow
[3:48:43.380 --> 3:48:45.380]  they just are, you just can't
[3:48:45.380 --> 3:48:47.380]  or go in there and arrest
[3:48:47.380 --> 3:48:49.380]  that kind of person
[3:48:49.380 --> 3:48:51.380]  yes you can
[3:48:51.380 --> 3:48:53.380]  yes you can, you actually can
[3:48:53.380 --> 3:48:55.380]  and you can put them on trial
[3:48:55.380 --> 3:48:57.380]  and if you did put them on trial
[3:48:57.380 --> 3:48:59.380]  this is a word to the wise and major media
[3:48:59.380 --> 3:49:01.380]  if you did put them
[3:49:01.380 --> 3:49:03.380]  on trial in a real show trial
[3:49:03.380 --> 3:49:05.380]  open doors
[3:49:05.380 --> 3:49:07.380]  cameras
[3:49:07.380 --> 3:49:09.380]  by the end of that trial
[3:49:09.380 --> 3:49:11.380]  you would have millions and millions
[3:49:11.380 --> 3:49:13.380]  and millions of people around the world
[3:49:13.380 --> 3:49:15.380]  watching and your ratings
[3:49:15.380 --> 3:49:17.380]  would go through the roof
[3:49:17.380 --> 3:49:19.380]  of course
[3:49:19.380 --> 3:49:21.380]  you might not be able to sell as many
[3:49:21.380 --> 3:49:23.380]  drug ads for pharmaceutical companies
[3:49:23.380 --> 3:49:25.380]  but really who cares
[3:49:25.380 --> 3:49:27.380]  because here's another clue
[3:49:27.380 --> 3:49:29.380]  potato heads in the major media
[3:49:29.380 --> 3:49:31.380]  you can let those pharmaceutical
[3:49:31.380 --> 3:49:33.380]  advertisers go
[3:49:33.380 --> 3:49:35.380]  if your ratings are good enough
[3:49:35.380 --> 3:49:37.380]  other advertisers will
[3:49:37.380 --> 3:49:39.380]  show up and they will pay top
[3:49:39.380 --> 3:49:41.380]  dollar
[3:49:41.380 --> 3:49:43.380]  for time
[3:49:43.380 --> 3:49:45.380]  on your base
[3:49:45.380 --> 3:49:47.380]  on your network or in your newspaper
[3:49:47.380 --> 3:49:49.380]  that is just the way economies
[3:49:49.380 --> 3:49:51.380]  operate of course you wouldn't know that
[3:49:51.380 --> 3:49:53.380]  because you're globalists and you're
[3:49:53.380 --> 3:49:55.380]  you think that the government is the ultimate solution
[3:49:55.380 --> 3:49:57.380]  to everything
[3:49:57.380 --> 3:49:59.380]  centralized center for production
[3:49:59.380 --> 3:50:01.380]  and distribution
[3:50:01.380 --> 3:50:03.380]  distribution of all services to the world
[3:50:03.380 --> 3:50:05.380]  that's why you're so dumb
[3:50:05.380 --> 3:50:07.380]  but I can tell you
[3:50:07.380 --> 3:50:09.380]  that if you could lose
[3:50:09.380 --> 3:50:11.380]  all your pharmaceutical advertisers
[3:50:11.380 --> 3:50:13.380]  and you would still make out great
[3:50:13.380 --> 3:50:15.380]  if your ratings are good enough
[3:50:15.380 --> 3:50:17.380]  because in
[3:50:17.380 --> 3:50:19.380]  a robust economy
[3:50:19.380 --> 3:50:21.380]  or even an imitation of a robust
[3:50:21.380 --> 3:50:23.380]  economy other people show up with money
[3:50:23.380 --> 3:50:25.380]  and they say well looks like you've got
[3:50:25.380 --> 3:50:27.380]  time looks like you've got space
[3:50:27.380 --> 3:50:29.380]  we want in we have products too
[3:50:29.380 --> 3:50:31.380]  you'll be fine
[3:50:31.380 --> 3:50:33.380]  of course
[3:50:33.380 --> 3:50:35.380]  you're not going to do that but I just thought
[3:50:35.380 --> 3:50:37.380]  I'd bring it up to show how
[3:50:37.380 --> 3:50:39.380]  you know
[3:50:39.380 --> 3:50:41.380]  you really are
[3:50:41.380 --> 3:50:43.380]  okay we're heading toward a break here
[3:50:43.380 --> 3:50:45.380]  big story after the break
[3:50:45.380 --> 3:50:47.380]  about vaccine damage
[3:50:47.380 --> 3:50:49.380]  and the capacity and ability
[3:50:49.380 --> 3:50:51.380]  to sue vaccine manufacturers

[3:51:35.380 --> 3:51:37.380]  my wrists don't hurt after typing all day
[3:51:37.380 --> 3:51:39.380]  now I tell you all this because it's true

[3:56:17.380 --> 3:56:19.380]  minutes here as we move toward the close
[3:56:19.380 --> 3:56:21.380]  a big
[3:56:21.380 --> 3:56:23.380]  story that I covered recently
[3:56:23.380 --> 3:56:25.380]  at no more fake news
[3:56:25.380 --> 3:56:27.380]  I'll just give you a tease on it
[3:56:27.380 --> 3:56:29.380]  you can go find it yourself
[3:56:29.380 --> 3:56:31.380]  it's long been
[3:56:31.380 --> 3:56:33.380]  the thought that in America
[3:56:33.380 --> 3:56:35.380]  victims of vaccine damage cannot
[3:56:35.380 --> 3:56:37.380]  sue vaccine manufacturers
[3:56:37.380 --> 3:56:39.380]  they have to go to this crazy
[3:56:39.380 --> 3:56:41.380]  federal vaccine compensation
[3:56:41.380 --> 3:56:43.380]  program and plead
[3:56:43.380 --> 3:56:45.380]  for compensation from vaccine
[3:56:45.380 --> 3:56:47.380]  injury for themselves or their children
[3:56:47.380 --> 3:56:49.380]  and that's a long
[3:56:49.380 --> 3:56:51.380]  story but that's been conventional wisdom
[3:56:51.380 --> 3:56:53.380]  and now all of a sudden
[3:56:53.380 --> 3:56:55.380]  we have lawyers all over the country and I've talked to
[3:56:55.380 --> 3:56:57.380]  a couple of them who are suing
[3:56:57.380 --> 3:56:59.380]  Merck the manufacturer
[3:56:59.380 --> 3:57:01.380]  of the shingles
[3:57:01.380 --> 3:57:03.380]  vaccine which happens to be an adult
[3:57:03.380 --> 3:57:05.380]  vaccine given to
[3:57:05.380 --> 3:57:07.380]  people over 50 over 60 depending on who you
[3:57:07.380 --> 3:57:09.380]  you believe here
[3:57:09.380 --> 3:57:11.380]  wow
[3:57:11.380 --> 3:57:13.380]  suing a manufacturer
[3:57:13.380 --> 3:57:15.380]  one lawyer told me he's got two
[3:57:15.380 --> 3:57:17.380]  suits already filed in California
[3:57:17.380 --> 3:57:19.380]  with 50 plaintiffs each
[3:57:19.380 --> 3:57:21.380]  and 5,000 more people waiting in the wings
[3:57:21.380 --> 3:57:23.380]  and they're talking about extremely
[3:57:23.380 --> 3:57:25.380]  serious injuries and
[3:57:25.380 --> 3:57:27.380]  death from the shingles
[3:57:27.380 --> 3:57:29.380]  vaccine which would tend to indicate
[3:57:29.380 --> 3:57:31.380]  that well wait a minute
[3:57:31.380 --> 3:57:33.380]  in America you actually
[3:57:33.380 --> 3:57:35.380]  can sue a vaccine manufacturer
[3:57:35.380 --> 3:57:37.380]  under certain conditions
[3:57:37.380 --> 3:57:39.380]  and what I discovered
[3:57:39.380 --> 3:57:41.380]  and what I maintain to be the truth and I'll
[3:57:41.380 --> 3:57:43.380]  close with this for the moment
[3:57:43.380 --> 3:57:45.380]  is that if a
[3:57:45.380 --> 3:57:47.380]  vaccine is listed under the
[3:57:47.380 --> 3:57:49.380]  child child immunization
[3:57:49.380 --> 3:57:51.380]  schedule by the CDC
[3:57:51.380 --> 3:57:53.380]  that means that anybody who is trying
[3:57:53.380 --> 3:57:55.380]  to get compensation for injury
[3:57:55.380 --> 3:57:57.380]  from one of those vaccines would indeed
[3:57:57.380 --> 3:57:59.380]  go to the
[3:57:59.380 --> 3:58:01.380]  federal kangaroo court and try
[3:58:01.380 --> 3:58:03.380]  to plead for compensation but
[3:58:03.380 --> 3:58:05.380]  on the other hand
[3:58:05.380 --> 3:58:07.380]  if it's a vaccine that's not
[3:58:07.380 --> 3:58:09.380]  on that schedule and it's for
[3:58:09.380 --> 3:58:11.380]  adults only oh yeah
[3:58:11.380 --> 3:58:13.380]  apparently you can sue
[3:58:13.380 --> 3:58:15.380]  the manufacturer
[3:58:15.380 --> 3:58:17.380]  that's juicy much more on that
[3:58:17.380 --> 3:58:19.380]  at a later date
[3:58:19.380 --> 3:58:21.380]  we're closing out the fourth hour here
