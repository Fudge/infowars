[01:02.520 --> 01:06.920]  members there an hour more than 50 and we reach I don't know four or five times
[01:06.920 --> 01:12.960]  what we did in the past and I just want to say the crew has done an absolutely
[01:12.960 --> 01:17.160]  amazing job and all of you that have donated at info wars money bomb calm
[01:17.160 --> 01:22.840]  you've done an incredible job I want to thank you wall Gerald Salente is coming
[01:22.840 --> 01:26.800]  up kicking off the first hour of the radio show because it's radio shows
[01:26.800 --> 01:30.080]  three or four hours long every day that's four hours actually on the
[01:30.080 --> 01:35.600]  satellite we don't always do four hours but the point is that we're here we're
[01:35.600 --> 01:44.120]  live it is the 19th day of October 2012 a very upsetting interview with David
[01:44.120 --> 01:48.600]  Ike for almost two hours that I just came off of and it mentally is taxing
[01:48.600 --> 01:52.160]  to hear that information but it's painful because so much of what he's
[01:52.160 --> 01:58.120]  getting into with the Jerry Sandusky and other top BBC you know host and people
[01:58.120 --> 02:02.280]  caught in giant pedophile networks connected to the Royal Family mainstream
[02:02.280 --> 02:05.960]  news I mean it's just confirming everything Prince Charles saying basically
[02:05.960 --> 02:11.080]  he's Dracula reincarnated I mean it's just all it's way too crazy and it's
[02:11.080 --> 02:18.600]  all right there and you've got in this Jimmy Savelle the guy that helped
[02:18.600 --> 02:23.080]  children in England who was an obvious pervert weirdo said called the kids a
[02:23.080 --> 02:29.520]  little slave sorted boast at the dark truth about friend Jimmy Savelle by the
[02:29.520 --> 02:32.960]  biographer who tried to unmask him and now it's all coming out it just
[02:32.960 --> 02:38.640]  absolutely blows me away that that that we've let evil people get in the
[02:38.640 --> 02:43.200]  positions of power that's why you end up getting human sacrifice in every
[02:43.200 --> 02:48.240]  culture is because the very very worse to get into control and they just seek
[02:48.240 --> 02:52.440]  to do absolutely horrible things and and now all the wars and the torture and the
[02:52.440 --> 02:57.560]  secret arrest and the warrantless wiretapping and the all of it coming
[02:57.560 --> 03:01.560]  to a head by the way we covered the headline yesterday Joseph Stiglitz has
[03:01.560 --> 03:04.520]  come out the Nobel Prize winner and said Europe's in a depression I thought
[03:04.520 --> 03:08.360]  Gerald Salenta and I were pessimist porn dealers were pointing out this was
[03:08.360 --> 03:13.040]  happening so more and more of it is all admitted and they're really gearing up
[03:13.040 --> 03:18.000]  towards Iran they've cut off the Iranian cable network in Europe all the
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.280]  previous saber rattling that didn't happen so that's a big shine and you've
[03:23.280 --> 03:26.680]  got the big proxy war to bring down Syria then they go into Iran that's
[03:26.680 --> 03:30.240]  always been the plan it looks like we're headed into very serious times
[03:30.240 --> 03:35.240]  whether it's this year or early next year it's all happening you know Max
[03:35.240 --> 03:40.320]  Kaiser is joining us later in the day in the third hour he says it all and
[03:40.320 --> 03:45.760]  basically implode by April but that you could have cities burning and then you
[03:45.760 --> 03:49.080]  know whatever and then the news would say well you know unemployment's at zero
[03:49.080 --> 03:52.640]  percent and government loves you and everything's fine this is the greatest
[03:52.640 --> 03:55.640]  time of your life I mean they could be lowering your dead kid into a coffin in
[03:55.640 --> 03:58.560]  the ground and they'd say look your child's dancing beautifully you know
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.600]  it's just just all pure lies shoveled at us an empire of lies by a bunch of
[04:03.600 --> 04:08.920]  control freaks and Jerry Sandusky types running around having their way with us

[05:04.160 --> 05:08.200]  farmers Americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses

[05:12.120 --> 05:15.680]  and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes

[11:13.880 --> 11:17.280]  just got to ask you I mean it's coming to a head with the TSA they're now at
[11:17.280 --> 11:21.440]  highway checkpoints taking people into trailers and grabbing their genitals I
[11:21.440 --> 11:25.800]  mean I don't fly now basically unless I have to because of it I won't fly with
[11:25.800 --> 11:31.000]  my wife and kids because I can't put up with it and now they've got army
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.160]  checkpoints popping up not just drills everywhere I mean they are we're going
[11:35.160 --> 11:39.480]  into martial law they're just not gonna call it that jumbo trons going up at
[11:39.480 --> 11:44.240]  mall America Walmart saying don't trust anyone but big sis Obama announcements to
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.040]  people's phones I mean we are going into a science fiction system why is the
[11:49.040 --> 11:52.640]  ruling class turning the heat up a thousand times I mean this is just I
[11:52.640 --> 11:59.360]  feel like I'm in fantasy land right now well we said when the crash began in the
[11:59.360 --> 12:05.880]  panic of 08 that we said that after all of the recovery failed they would take
[12:05.880 --> 12:12.880]  us to war and taking us to war takes its shape in different ways and the war now
[12:12.880 --> 12:18.080]  is to control the people look at the numbers that just came out two days ago
[12:18.080 --> 12:24.480]  oh violent crime is up 18 percent what a shock blow me away how could that have
[12:24.480 --> 12:30.000]  happened you know my saying when people lose everything and have nothing left
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.920]  to lose they lose it and by the way before we go on I want to thank you so
[12:35.920 --> 12:42.240]  much for all you are doing for how hard you and your team are working and how
[12:42.240 --> 12:48.360]  dedicated you all are and I'm listening to that lineup of guests that you have
[12:48.360 --> 12:56.240]  and there's nothing in any of the media mainstream or otherwise that could match
[12:56.240 --> 13:02.760]  a ticket like that and so thank you very much for what you are doing and it
[13:02.760 --> 13:09.600]  also came into my mind many but about four years ago about that you did that
[13:09.600 --> 13:15.960]  expose on Obama when everyone was still drinking the Kool-Aid called the Obama
[13:15.960 --> 13:23.920]  deception and I encourage everyone to take a look at that because it fit right
[13:23.920 --> 13:31.920]  in with our motto the signature of the trends journal history before it
[13:31.920 --> 13:39.480]  happens and that's what you did with the Obama deception with myself and others
[13:39.480 --> 13:45.440]  that were on there we showed the history of how this would play out when he just
[13:45.440 --> 13:51.920]  started playing the role as commander-in-chief and then before I answer
[13:51.920 --> 13:58.320]  your question please after I get off the air we'd like to also contribute to
[13:58.320 --> 14:04.800]  keeping this money bomb growing so you could have the best equipment the best
[14:04.800 --> 14:11.360]  satellite hookups and get this message around the world because as Joseph
[14:11.360 --> 14:17.840]  Stiglitz said the Nobel Peace Prize winner yeah it's crashing over there in
[14:17.840 --> 14:23.160]  Europe no kidding I would have never guessed couldn't be because they have
[14:23.160 --> 14:30.880]  25% unemployment in Greeks no couldn't be because 80,000 people took to the
[14:30.880 --> 14:38.840]  streets yesterday in Greece protesting again the fourth one this month no no
[14:38.840 --> 14:43.320]  that had nothing to do with it couldn't be because of those millions of Spanish
[14:43.320 --> 14:50.040]  that are taking to the streets working virtually weekly in circling the
[14:50.040 --> 14:56.200]  parliament because of the poverty that's being imposed upon them the money
[14:56.200 --> 15:01.240]  grabbed being taken from them and given to the banks no no that would have
[15:01.240 --> 15:05.760]  nothing to do with the depression they only have 25% unemployment
[15:05.760 --> 15:13.600]  officially over 50% unemployment for the young people in the country so the whole
[15:13.600 --> 15:19.560]  system is collapsing around the world oh I forgot the wars in Libya you remember
[15:19.560 --> 15:28.080]  that humanitarian mission hey I saw the commander in chief yucking it up with
[15:28.080 --> 15:33.840]  John Stuart I didn't watch it I only watched the clip yeah the commander and
[15:33.840 --> 15:42.600]  chief sitting on a cheap two-bit clown show talking about foreign policy would
[15:42.600 --> 15:48.960]  you imagine Eisenhower sitting there that's how low the bar has fallen in
[15:48.960 --> 15:56.600]  America and check it out Obama says about Libya and the problems that they
[15:56.600 --> 16:03.400]  had we're gonna fix it oh yeah you're gonna fix it hey just like you fixed it
[16:03.400 --> 16:09.800]  in Afghanistan with the 30,000 troops that you sent over there and what did
[16:09.800 --> 16:15.760]  they do oh they got killed a lot of them wiped out a lot of people oh oh oh it
[16:15.760 --> 16:20.160]  didn't make the front page of the toilet paper of record yesterday it was
[16:20.160 --> 16:27.040]  buried on page 12 they killed another three little Afghan children but who
[16:27.040 --> 16:33.960]  cares because it's the presidential reality show so the whole thing is
[16:33.960 --> 16:39.200]  collapsing and what are they doing they're distracting us at every moment
[16:39.200 --> 16:45.740]  last week it was Big Bird this week it's about Romney's binder and no one
[16:45.740 --> 16:52.440]  is speaking about the issues both of these little boys are just going on all
[16:52.440 --> 16:58.000]  the talk shows all the yucking it up I love the way they left it was
[16:58.000 --> 17:06.000]  criticizing Biden for his behavior when he was debating Ryan you know the
[17:06.000 --> 17:12.560]  Cheshire cat against the mouse that's what it looked like to me and here's
[17:12.560 --> 17:22.480]  Biden check it out go to the look at the the dinner that Obama the Al Smith
[17:22.480 --> 17:28.400]  dinner and Romney were out yesterday and you see the picture now I used to work
[17:28.400 --> 17:35.720]  in politics that's what they do they're a bunch of phonies it's always and all
[17:35.720 --> 17:42.000]  the stooges around them laugh on Q so it takes it to the bigger level about you
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.800]  talking about all these leaders in all these different positions that are
[17:46.800 --> 17:53.200]  leading us to destruction it's the same in in Germany with that Merkel it's the
[17:53.200 --> 17:58.720]  same over there in Spain with Rajoy it's the same over there in Italy with
[17:58.720 --> 18:04.680]  three card Monty it's the same everywhere it's the club and they're
[18:04.680 --> 18:11.360]  destroying us and the big news today that hey we got to talk about Romney's

[18:35.720 --> 18:41.960]  little story doesn't make much difference they just did a deal yesterday
[18:41.960 --> 18:50.660]  today in in in Europe in Brussels it's happened the banking systems have
[18:50.660 --> 18:57.440]  merged they have now taken control sovereign control over all of the banks
[18:57.440 --> 19:02.960]  throughout Europe and have now put it under the one bank in Brussels now it's

[19:21.680 --> 19:26.360]  kind of try to cover it up and they're covering it up again this is not news
[19:26.360 --> 19:30.920]  that's making the news and as you said it's in the paper but in the back of it
[19:30.920 --> 19:34.040]  it's like oh yeah and now the country's all sovereignty will be given to the
[19:34.040 --> 19:38.000]  private bank and that's the way it is and you're gonna take your taxes and pay
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.480]  it to foreign bankers and tell you how lazy you are how's that sound and they

[24:45.840 --> 24:50.120]  listeners did it and it helped us get extra capital to move into a bigger
[24:50.120 --> 24:54.400]  office and expand studios and we're now five years later and we don't reach
[24:54.400 --> 24:58.520]  three million a week we reached about 15 million one way or another and now we
[24:58.520 --> 25:01.880]  want to do free-to-air satellites so people all over the world can get the
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.560]  nightly news and other shows and news vignettes that we know we can get on TV
[25:06.560 --> 25:10.320]  stations not just here but all over the world people in major cable systems in
[25:10.320 --> 25:14.240]  Europe and England and also in the US already download the nightly show that
[25:14.240 --> 25:19.440]  present planet on TV viewers see and they edit it and put it on their own cable
[25:19.440 --> 25:26.240]  system so it's just gonna explode once we do this very very excited and working
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.280]  towards it but again we don't have big global sponsorship we don't have Banker
[25:30.280 --> 25:33.360]  Bell out money like MSNBC where they take your money and then give it to them
[25:33.360 --> 25:37.960]  or give it to energy companies Gerald continuing how big a deal this is you
[25:37.960 --> 25:40.960]  got the Rothschilds and Rockefellers merging that happened a month ago
[25:40.960 --> 25:44.000]  assigned that the whole world's coming together under this they're announcing a
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.560]  banking dictatorship worldwide they're butchering our liberties how does I ran
[25:48.560 --> 25:52.920]  tie into that and the storm clouds there and what do you see happening in the
[25:52.920 --> 25:59.560]  election well on a run I have to tell you I'm quite upset about what I just saw
[25:59.560 --> 26:08.760]  in Florida they're running ads campaign ads featuring Israeli Prime Minister
[26:08.760 --> 26:15.320]  Benjamin Netanyahu warning about that red line and no one's to tell Israel if
[26:15.320 --> 26:21.160]  they have a red light and how Iran's is great threat I want to read to you a
[26:21.160 --> 26:28.560]  quote from our autumn trends journalist just went out last week mr. Prime
[26:28.560 --> 26:35.040]  Minister you want a crude rude unprecedented reckless and risky
[26:35.040 --> 26:42.920]  intervention into the US elections who are you trying to replace the
[26:42.920 --> 26:56.240]  administration in Washington or that of Tehran that Alex was from Shole Mavaz
[26:56.240 --> 27:03.280]  the head of Israel's Kadima party that's the second major party could you
[27:03.280 --> 27:13.240]  imagine that a foreign power is injecting themselves into our American election
[27:13.240 --> 27:21.280]  where are the prostitutes saying what an outrage this is that somebody should be
[27:21.280 --> 27:27.720]  running ads and telling us that we have to support Israel unconditionally this
[27:27.720 --> 27:32.240]  is running on and I'm gonna make this come not an anti-semite I'm not in
[27:32.240 --> 27:38.840]  favor of supporting anybody outside of America I'm Italian that's where my money
[27:38.840 --> 27:44.680]  would go first but I don't want to go in there either so to have this going on so
[27:44.680 --> 27:52.280]  where is the election going it's right at the wire we had changed our forecast we
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.640]  had believed that Obama was going to win now we don't know and I'll tell you
[27:57.640 --> 28:05.280]  why because it's all about performance look at what happened Obama bombed he
[28:05.280 --> 28:13.320]  was lackluster in the first debate his poll numbers shot down why because it's
[28:13.320 --> 28:20.000]  the presidential reality show there is no substance so the second debate he
[28:20.000 --> 28:26.680]  does better his poll numbers move up what did he say of substance what did
[28:26.680 --> 28:33.840]  oh Romney say of substance in the last debate how about nothing there was one
[28:33.840 --> 28:39.680]  guy Obama trying to defend a track record that's
[28:39.680 --> 28:47.920]  undefensible and then we have Romney with a plan that has no plan so here's
[28:47.920 --> 28:53.760]  what the campaign debates have come down to they get asked a question and then
[28:53.760 --> 28:58.400]  what they do is they repeat the question and after they repeat the question
[28:58.400 --> 29:04.560]  they go and and kick into the same damn campaign speech we've been hearing over
[29:04.560 --> 29:11.520]  and over for over a year so all it is about is performance look at the language
[29:11.520 --> 29:18.480]  that they used after that so-called debate that was hosted by Candy Crowley
[29:18.480 --> 29:26.480]  Crowley from the Cautu News Network CNN featuring mouse blitzer AC DC 180 and

[34:05.720 --> 34:11.360]  many different things where do you see it going specifically now that so much
[34:11.360 --> 34:15.080]  of what you've broken down has now been accurate fine-tuning or looking out into
[34:15.080 --> 34:19.200]  the future more and more it looks like the really bad scenarios where we're
[34:19.200 --> 34:24.920]  going instead of just the you know nasty scenario really bad really serious
[34:24.920 --> 34:28.760]  you've got a general decadence and a lot of people they're still hard-working

[34:45.160 --> 34:49.080]  children were suspended a bunch of them in the class was in the Huffington post
[34:49.080 --> 34:53.520]  in their places because the teachers iPhone synced with these with the class
[34:53.520 --> 34:57.680]  iPads they had and saw her breath that she'd sent her boyfriend and they said
[34:57.680 --> 35:00.800]  well you still shouldn't have seen it even though it's our fault she's not
[35:00.800 --> 35:04.920]  in trouble you're in trouble or here in Austin that the people call 911
[35:04.920 --> 35:09.520]  because their husband you know the the father's having a seizure and cops get

[35:13.040 --> 35:15.680]  and they go stop having a seizure and start tasering him till he had a
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.240]  heart attack well the guy was unconscious and and they're not getting in
[35:19.240 --> 35:23.360]  trouble I mean I saw a article out of England where it was like a you know
[35:23.360 --> 35:27.400]  almost 80 year old guy who had a stroke no criminal record a scientist with a
[35:27.400 --> 35:33.680]  white cane who's blind can barely walk and the police didn't say halt stop
[35:33.680 --> 35:37.720]  anything they just tasered him and they said well that's okay I mean it's a
[35:37.720 --> 35:42.320]  bunch of sadist and crazy people in charge now they're pushing out any good
[35:42.320 --> 35:47.720]  people and it's just getting crazier and crazier by the minute and I just
[35:47.720 --> 35:52.040]  don't see where it's going to go from this point I've seen other civilizations
[35:52.040 --> 35:56.520]  go through decadent cycles they're nothing like this this technology is
[35:56.520 --> 36:00.600]  gonna allow fraud to go so much further not against technology but it does have
[36:00.600 --> 36:05.760]  that manifestation that I mean I I just can't believe everything that we've
[36:05.760 --> 36:09.960]  basically broken down is so accurate and that if there's any criticism of you or
[36:09.960 --> 36:14.560]  I and other experts we have on because I have people on that are accurate and
[36:14.560 --> 36:17.640]  piercing and you know have records of being accurate not you know not
[36:17.640 --> 36:23.800]  establishment liars and but still it's sick to be right so I mean you get the
[36:23.800 --> 36:27.920]  gist of what I'm saying it's just a marvel at what we're witnessing no we've
[36:27.920 --> 36:31.480]  never seen anything like it and again you know I'm talking about I call it the
[36:31.480 --> 36:37.680]  presidential reality show what American could be proud to be an American after
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.960]  watching these debates this is it an empty suit and a stuffed shirt an
[36:42.960 --> 36:52.920]  emperor with no clothes and a a vulture capitalist that craves power listen to
[36:52.920 --> 36:59.320]  what Eisenhower said that any man that seeks the presidency is either a ego
[36:59.320 --> 37:06.960]  maniac or crazy you don't seek this you the you like a George Washington you
[37:06.960 --> 37:11.520]  don't see they they they want you you don't go seek it Romney's been running
[37:11.520 --> 37:16.520]  forever is Obama really playing president I mean this cats out there
[37:16.520 --> 37:22.960]  with his sleeves rolled up every damn day doing a campaign gig you and I know I
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.240]  were running businesses you can't do this who the hell's running his show
[37:27.240 --> 37:32.160]  you got a whole country to run and this guy's on the campaign trail it's so
[37:32.160 --> 37:38.640]  serious but people refuse to see it for what it is as I mentioned when you
[37:38.640 --> 37:42.840]  looked at that debate that's so-called debate the other night and look at all
[37:42.840 --> 37:48.800]  of the coverage all it was about you know Obama came out swinging it was you
[37:48.800 --> 37:54.000]  know it was bitter from the beginning and biting and blah blah blah but how
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.240]  about the policies what did they talk about what did they say that it were
[37:58.240 --> 38:02.880]  going to do and there's not a dime's worth of difference I can make a point
[38:02.880 --> 38:09.560]  to prove it Romney comes out and says more clean coal oh clean coal great
[38:09.560 --> 38:14.800]  that's like being almost pregnant isn't it I got enough more fracking more and
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.480]  Obama hasn't opened up enough public lands I'm going to open it up for more
[38:20.480 --> 38:26.680]  fracking oh and more opening up of those pristine areas for drilling and get
[38:26.680 --> 38:32.160]  that pipeline running down there from the tar sands through Canada what does
[38:32.160 --> 38:40.720]  Obama do he one ups him he kills out Romney for closing down a coal burning
[38:40.720 --> 38:45.960]  plant when he was governor of Massachusetts so this is what we have
[38:45.960 --> 38:52.320]  when it comes to more war each one talks tougher than the other so when
[38:52.320 --> 38:58.480]  you're saying where is the nation going it's right in front of us it's going
[38:58.480 --> 39:05.320]  down the crapper by two little boys that try to play tough out there on the
[39:05.320 --> 39:13.680]  stage that couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag and this fatmouth Romney
[39:13.680 --> 39:18.920]  I've had it with him talking about bombing this country bombing that
[39:18.920 --> 39:25.680]  country while Romney spent two years running away from the draft in Vietnam
[39:25.680 --> 39:33.280]  missionary mitt in France you imagine being a Mormon missionary in wine
[39:33.280 --> 39:41.000]  drinking cigarette smoking caffeine addicted Bridget Bardot loving France no
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.240]  wonder why he got punched out when he was over there and he did so here's a
[39:46.240 --> 39:53.160]  draft dodger and telling us what we should do and by the way here's my oh
[39:53.160 --> 39:58.880]  when Obama I love when Obama goes into commander and chief mode twice he
[39:58.880 --> 40:05.960]  reminded us I got Osama bin Laden and by the way who is this guy Al Cater I
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.880]  thought Al Cater was dead after they got Osama I'll tell you where Al Cater is
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.840]  they're putting him into Syria and Libya and that's my question Romney saying
[40:14.840 --> 40:19.200]  hey we're gonna get you Russia our troops are in a proxy war in Syria that's
[40:19.200 --> 40:23.160]  now admitted fighting with Al Cater even the New York Times months after it was
[40:23.160 --> 40:26.480]  out admitted it you know this Monday so now it's true kind of like when
[40:26.480 --> 40:29.840]  sticklet says it's a depression well now oh my gosh it's true because they say
[40:29.840 --> 40:34.840]  so you know because they control reality but I mean the craziness of our
[40:34.840 --> 40:40.000]  troops fighting by Al Cater in Syria and then Hillary says we've got to go into
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.960]  Syria their Al Cater and we got to go into Iran their Al Cater knowing I ran
[40:44.960 --> 40:49.800]  a Shiite arch enemies of Al Cater not defending Iran they just they talked to
[40:49.800 --> 40:54.260]  us because they know Gerald the general public doesn't know how to find their
[40:54.260 --> 40:59.280]  butt with both hands you got it you got it and that's what they do so where is
[40:59.280 --> 41:04.120]  it going oh this is the other thing where I have a real beef they're spending
[41:04.120 --> 41:09.720]  this this baloney nothing moronic presidential realities show they're
[41:09.720 --> 41:16.080]  spending 2.5 billion billion with a B in advertising you know where the
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.920]  advertising is going that's that's to pay the prostitutes you pay the
[41:20.920 --> 41:27.320]  prostitutes to do your dirty work so here we have the prostitutes whether
[41:27.320 --> 41:35.120]  it's the guy Lear or Candy Crowley or the last one where did they come up with
[41:35.120 --> 41:42.560]  I would got the questions and I decide what I'm going to ask hey how about the
[41:42.560 --> 41:48.200]  rest of us what do you mean hey I'll talk about Alistair Crowley he's got a
[41:48.200 --> 41:53.120]  lot of followers what I've called her Alistair Crowley now I mean it's
[41:53.120 --> 41:58.720]  ridiculous it's ridiculous here they are Alex the networks are running the
[41:58.720 --> 42:04.120]  campaigns let's get this straight they're getting all the money to run the ads
[42:04.120 --> 42:09.680]  all the debates are being run by the networks they used to be the debates
[42:09.680 --> 42:16.000]  most people are too young to remember they used to be run by the League of
[42:16.000 --> 42:21.760]  Women Voters that's right before the Democratic and Republican Republican
[42:21.760 --> 42:27.960]  mafia took it over this is just a stage two bitch show they're delivering
[42:27.960 --> 42:34.160]  nothing nothing of substance comes out of these again it's the same campaign
[42:34.160 --> 42:38.760]  rhetoric so where's it going I mentioned the rise in crime it's up 18%
[42:38.760 --> 42:44.960]  violent crime is up 18% how about the new housing numbers that came out today
[42:44.960 --> 42:51.680]  it down almost 2% you look at the unemployment numbers that you keep
[42:51.680 --> 42:56.760]  mentioning and just mention oh they readjusted them they went back up again
[42:56.760 --> 43:04.360]  you're looking what about 388,000 people a week a week going on
[43:04.360 --> 43:10.800]  unemployment you look at one issue after the other there is no recovery it's a
[43:10.800 --> 43:16.080]  cover-up so now let's see what else is going on oh isn't it great they have
[43:16.080 --> 43:21.640]  China and Japan fighting each other hey sound familiar couldn't be because the
[43:21.640 --> 43:25.880]  United States is opening up bases over there in Australia they've announced that
[43:25.880 --> 43:30.520]  they're after being defeated in Afghanistan and Iraq destabilizing the
[43:30.520 --> 43:34.280]  Middle East hey let's take on China they got thousands of nicks and a
[43:34.280 --> 43:40.040]  billion 300 million people let's start a fight with them exactly we failed over
[43:40.040 --> 43:46.120]  there let's fail real big let's get Japan our little proxy puppet over there
[43:46.120 --> 43:51.520]  and have them steal a two-bit island say that they paid for it so they could
[43:51.520 --> 43:56.160]  start clashing between each other and boy this thing's coming down big the
[43:56.160 --> 44:01.600]  Chinese aren't letting it go away and think of the stupidity of the psychopaths
[44:01.600 --> 44:07.240]  China is one of Japan's biggest markets now the people in China aren't buying
[44:07.240 --> 44:14.120]  Japanese stuff and remember what I said and you see it happening the crash of
[44:14.120 --> 44:21.440]  29 the Panic of 08 saying the panics fall followed by depression we're in a
[44:21.440 --> 44:29.040]  depression oh even Stiglitz says it now currency wars listen to the head of the
[44:29.040 --> 44:34.400]  financial head of the Brazilian government the finance minister Montague
[44:34.400 --> 44:40.400]  we're in a currency war the United States Europe China they're all
[44:40.400 --> 44:44.680]  devaluing their currencies China just lowered interest rates twice in the last
[44:44.680 --> 44:50.480]  week and a half they're flooding money into the system to prop it up currency
[44:50.480 --> 44:57.280]  wars same thing Panic of 08 crash at 29 depression currency wars trade wars you
[44:57.280 --> 45:03.560]  hear Mittens and you hear Obama bashing China the trade wars are heating up
[45:03.560 --> 45:10.520]  world war how many more pieces have to be put together we talked about what's
[45:10.520 --> 45:14.560]  going on in Spain what's going on in Greece was going on in Portugal millions
[45:14.560 --> 45:20.480]  of people are taking to the streets in desperation they have nothing they have
[45:20.480 --> 45:24.560]  nothing oh and this banking deal that was just done in Brussels you know what
[45:24.560 --> 45:29.320]  the European stability mechanism means in outside of white shoe boy language
[45:29.320 --> 45:33.400]  it's very simple we're gonna tax you more we're gonna cut your pensions your
[45:33.400 --> 45:36.960]  benefits we're gonna raise your retirement age till after you die we're
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.400]  gonna take every penny that you have we're gonna buy you worthless bonds with
[45:41.400 --> 45:46.480]  the money oh and we're gonna deposit it directly into the accounts of the
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.880]  bankers and we're gonna pay an interest for the money they lost in between yeah
[45:50.880 --> 45:54.840]  so we bail I mean explain that slowly though we bail out the mega banks the
[45:54.840 --> 45:59.560]  media tells us we're lazy and that and that we're in debt 90 plus percent of
[45:59.560 --> 46:03.800]  the money goes directly to the bankers who then bail us out but then the money
[46:03.800 --> 46:07.840]  goes back to them because we bailed them out it's fraud within fraud within fraud
[46:07.840 --> 46:14.480]  it makes Bernie Madoff look like a saint and the general public doesn't care
[46:14.480 --> 46:19.120]  because they think Al Qaeda is hiding in their underwear yeah exactly and then
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.840]  when you and then keep piling on to that one and then we heard the grand
[46:23.840 --> 46:29.360]  madame Christine Lagarde the head of the IMF you're not working hard enough you
[46:29.360 --> 46:33.840]  scumbag people in grace you're enough of your kids aren't starving to death your
[46:33.840 --> 46:38.120]  tourism hasn't imploded enough give me more money you need to work six seven
[46:38.120 --> 46:46.680]  days a week and pay your taxes as she doesn't pay a penny in tax oh cuz the
[46:46.680 --> 46:51.160]  EU wrote the rules where the bureaucrats don't pay taxes just like just like the
[46:51.160 --> 46:58.120]  big banks don't pay taxes oh you use the word by the way also in the debate the
[46:58.120 --> 47:03.120]  issues that they talked about none of the major issues and and you just use the
[47:03.120 --> 47:07.600]  word so now I could say it what they talked about and that the last debate
[47:07.600 --> 47:11.840]  so much about gun control people have no jobs they're losing their homes elderly
[47:11.840 --> 47:15.240]  people can't pay their property taxes school taxes they're throwing them out
[47:15.240 --> 47:19.000]  of their houses they're taking them kids are going to college 50% of them are
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.120]  getting out and they're taking they get the jobs have jobs that are paying high
[47:23.120 --> 47:27.320]  school level wages these are facts and we don't they're talking about gun
[47:27.320 --> 47:32.640]  control it's let's talk about 20 minutes on gun control and contraception and I
[47:32.640 --> 47:38.840]  realized why Obama and Romney spoke so much about contraception because the
[47:38.840 --> 47:44.320]  word you just use both of them are scumbags that's what they talk about
[47:44.320 --> 47:49.240]  none of the big issues so as we're looking around the world and what's
[47:49.240 --> 47:54.480]  going on we're at war there's a war in Yemen a war in Bahrain Syria they
[47:54.480 --> 48:00.080]  destroyed Syria and who's destroying it the United States and the Arab Little
[48:00.080 --> 48:04.560]  League and by the way IMF is International Mafia Federation that's
[48:04.560 --> 48:09.560]  what it is they take your money they're alone shocks the last resort then you
[48:09.560 --> 48:13.920]  have as I mentioned all the other wars going on they're taking us to war
[48:13.920 --> 48:18.720]  you keep talking about it over and over again how they grope us how they
[48:18.720 --> 48:24.320]  surveil us how they demean us how they keep pushing us down so we have no
[48:24.320 --> 48:30.320]  dignity courage respect or integrity left and bow to their wishes that's
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.600]  what's going on it's in front of everyone's eyes but no one wants to call
[48:35.600 --> 48:40.600]  a spade a spade and it's building towards the crescendo now I mean they're
[48:40.600 --> 48:44.920]  rolling out the troops on the streets the TSA and the forced inoculations of
[48:44.920 --> 48:47.880]  kids that's totally illegal all over the country they're just shooting kids out
[48:47.880 --> 48:51.760]  of public schools I mean government has put out the green light they're not
[48:51.760 --> 48:54.880]  going to get in trouble for fast and furious they've just put the green light
[48:54.880 --> 49:01.280]  out hey it's time to just go crazy yeah and oh you said nobody gets you haven't
[49:01.280 --> 49:05.280]  seen any heads roll on Wall Street I love it they're all talking about you know
[49:05.280 --> 49:09.640]  what has to be done on what they have a free hand oh and by the way one of the
[49:09.640 --> 49:16.360]  reasons that's given why John the slime cause line was never even brought in for
[49:16.360 --> 49:21.600]  questioning besides him being a bundler for Obama besides him being the former
[49:21.600 --> 49:26.560]  CEO of the Goldman Sachs gang besides him being the senator and governor of
[49:26.560 --> 49:34.960]  New Jersey the same law firm that represents MF global is the white collar
[49:34.960 --> 49:42.200]  law syndicate one of the top ones in the country and you know who used to work
[49:42.200 --> 49:54.000]  there it's such a surprise Eric Holder our attorney yeah couldn't be no how dare
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.400]  you insinuate that he's a good man yeah and just because they're doing business
[50:00.400 --> 50:05.880]  with MF global and that's the law firm that he came from the whole thing is one
[50:05.880 --> 50:12.160]  club it's not a revolving door it's one door it's the banking door and you know
[50:12.160 --> 50:17.560]  that cover that we had on the trends journal that got so much popularity that

[56:33.200 --> 56:37.640]  there's so much to talk about what's your take on the Iran thing I mean how fast
[56:37.640 --> 56:40.640]  that could happen I guess they want to get Syria out of the way and get Al Qaeda
[56:40.640 --> 56:44.920]  in charge there and I guess in a year after that they'll be bombing Syria again
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.440]  to get rid of the Al Qaeda they put in that's already started in Libya I mean
[56:48.440 --> 56:53.160]  where do you see this military madness going well it's again it's World War
[56:53.160 --> 56:58.120]  three will they attack Iran I don't know you know I who knows just but as I say
[56:58.120 --> 57:02.720]  if they do our lives won't be worth anything anymore because you know they
[57:02.720 --> 57:08.960]  say Alex that generals always fight the last war yes they're doing it again
[57:08.960 --> 57:13.320]  they're fighting the last war if there's a war against Iran these are the
[57:13.320 --> 57:18.360]  Persians there's 70 million of them very intelligent people this is in Iraq with
[57:18.360 --> 57:22.920]  26 million people in a very different country this is a very sophisticated
[57:22.920 --> 57:27.520]  society you're gonna see what but you know when I wrote trends 2000 back in

[57:33.240 --> 57:38.720]  nukes that were being sold on the black market when the Soviet Union fell apart
[57:38.720 --> 57:44.080]  they're still out there and they're more sophisticated so the next war is going
[57:44.080 --> 57:49.840]  to go you know boom goes London boom parry you're gonna see suitcase size
[57:49.840 --> 57:55.480]  nukes blowing off you're going to see dirty bombs you're going to see weapons
[57:55.480 --> 58:01.480]  of mass destruction biological warfare it's going to be uncontrollable and of
[58:01.480 --> 58:05.400]  course they'll come out with the lines we're going to be able to fix it like
[58:05.400 --> 58:12.960]  our commander-in-chief just said on the comedy show the other night about how
[58:12.960 --> 58:17.160]  they're gonna fix the problem with four Americans get killed hey how about all
[58:17.160 --> 58:20.680]  the other Americans he ain't killed that's all right they're only soldiers

[58:24.760 --> 58:31.400]  really gets me an ambassador gets killed oh my god the ambassador oh my god

[58:54.200 --> 58:58.080]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[58:58.080 --> 59:01.960]  cheeses but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut
[59:01.960 --> 59:05.560]  yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living
[59:05.560 --> 59:09.280]  enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so
[59:09.280 --> 59:12.160]  afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of
[59:12.160 --> 59:15.440]  history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[59:15.440 --> 59:19.600]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat Miso
[59:19.600 --> 59:24.000]  Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.360]  is a staple for healthy living but here's some good news South relying
[59:27.360 --> 59:30.720]  Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods
[59:30.720 --> 59:34.200]  legally and privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these

[1:00:27.960 --> 1:00:33.880]  trendsresearch.com former libertarian presidential nominee and candidate
[1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:38.040]  Michael Bagnaric talk about the state of the world's coming up they'll be
[1:00:38.040 --> 1:00:43.440]  joining us we'll open the phones up as well with Mr. Bagnaric on a host of
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:48.920]  issues Gerald if you were on you know national TV which isn't what it used to
[1:00:48.920 --> 1:00:52.160]  be the ratings have dropped but let's say you were talking to you know
[1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:56.600]  millions of people which you are but but but folks that weren't informed what
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:00:59.760]  would you say in the five minutes we have left what would you say to them
[1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:03.680]  about you know changing the direction we're going or where it's going if we
[1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:08.360]  don't change it I will say that but I just want to finish that thought I had
[1:01:08.360 --> 1:01:12.840]  to say about the big deal when the ambassador gets killed sure you know when
[1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:18.000]  when Sergeant Rodriguez gets blown up and gets killed by a roadside bomb in
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:23.840]  Afghanistan when when Tammy White gets her brains blown out by a sniper in
[1:01:23.840 --> 1:01:30.440]  Afghanistan when when when somebody else you know Michael Smith the
[1:01:30.440 --> 1:01:37.360]  lieutenant he gets killed by a rocket propelled grenade the president the
[1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:43.880]  secretary of state nobody shows up they don't even show the coffins on TV but
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:49.200]  when the ambassador gets killed boy oh boy the whole crew comes out the world
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:56.040]  stops the embassies are all but when we anything happens to us it doesn't matter
[1:01:56.040 --> 1:02:00.800]  and I'm saying that because it leads into your next question what could change it
[1:02:00.800 --> 1:02:07.280]  the whole system is built upon making them look better than you or me and what
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:12.920]  I say to everyone right now that the only way that the change is going to come
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:19.520]  is when you make the change it has to start with the individual we all have
[1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:24.600]  we all have unique gifts you have yours they're a parent and everybody has to
[1:02:24.600 --> 1:02:29.480]  rise up to keep making your unique gift greater and greater I have a friend of
[1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:34.280]  mine Sonny Rollins the great jazz saxophonist he's in his 80s he gave me a
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:39.240]  quote from one of my books what Zizi gave honey boy he practices every day he
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:44.080]  practices every day getting better at his trade you don't hope for things to
[1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:49.040]  happen I say this because we're in this campaign cycle it's ending we're going
[1:02:49.040 --> 1:02:53.560]  to be left with a choice of a lesser of two evils and I'm saying I don't go out
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:56.920]  with the evils I don't deal with the evils I don't do business with the
[1:02:56.920 --> 1:03:00.440]  evils I don't hang out with the evils why would I vote for an evil to run my
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:06.480]  life well run my country so I'm saying that because people don't have the the
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:16.080]  belief that they are as good as their leaders so I suggest this if Clinton
[1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:27.560]  can if Bush can if Obama can and Romney can then you can and I can unless of
[1:03:27.560 --> 1:03:33.520]  course you think that their mother is better than yours just speaking for
[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:40.640]  myself they're not superior to me they're red carpets all the saluting I
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:46.840]  salute I got one for you save it you're not better than me and your mother's not
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:53.120]  better than mine let's just call it equal so this doesn't get out of hand so
[1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:58.920]  people have to find within themselves to stop buying into the baloney raise
[1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:03.560]  themselves to the highest levels because when the collective consciousness
[1:04:03.560 --> 1:04:08.160]  changes Alex to me that's the only way it changes no no I agree it's these so
[1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:11.840]  called elites that are dragging us down and they know it they're just willing to
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:15.840]  do horrible things that normal good virtuous people aren't they have
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:19.400]  desires that we don't have it's they're like cancer like you said they're
[1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:23.880]  anti you know team humanity and it's time to stop bowing down to them it's
[1:04:23.880 --> 1:04:28.000]  time to get in their face and tell them they're scum and filth I do that in fact
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:31.360]  my mother's my mother's a lot better than them I don't come from inbred
[1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:35.880]  parasites that suck off people my mother's better than theirs well I was
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:39.760]  just trying to keep it equal you know that's what I mean yeah of course what
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:42.880]  do you think their mother would cook I mean these globalists come from a bunch
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:48.200]  of murdering inbred scum most of their mothers were pigs yeah all right hey

[1:08:23.040 --> 1:08:29.760]  another 23 hours until 11 a.m. tomorrow in fact I have a sneaking suspicion when
[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:35.560]  we may just keep going by then we have had an incredible lineup let me tell
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:40.200]  who's been on Congressman Walter Jones Greg Palis, Sean Stone, John Rapaport, Mike
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:45.480]  Adams, Webster Tarpley, George Norrie, James Wesley Rawls, Linda West, Chikari
[1:08:45.480 --> 1:08:51.040]  Jackson and all the guests they had on Russell Doudin, Dan Bedondi, Syrian Girl,
[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:55.800]  Rob Dude, David Ike, Gerald Salente just left us now Michael Bagnarix coming on
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:09:01.880]  Max Kaiser, Joseph Farrah, Amber Lyon, the CNN whistleblower, Larry Pinkney, John
[1:09:01.880 --> 1:09:06.480]  B. Wells, Darren McBrain, Richard Reeves, David Knight, Lord Christopher Monkton,
[1:09:06.480 --> 1:09:15.680]  Joel Scalzen, so many others David Ortiz you name it here on the transmission and
[1:09:15.680 --> 1:09:21.640]  I I don't know I did like 12 hours yesterday and I'm doing not quite as
[1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:27.640]  many today but then I'm back tomorrow to end the 48 hour transmission and look
[1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:32.360]  I don't like getting up on air and asking for money I don't like doing it
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:40.480]  quite frankly if I spent more time on sales and if I spent more time for you
[1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:44.960]  Michael Bagnarix if I spent more time cutting better ads doing things I could
[1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:50.200]  probably raise the capital we need to get the satellite up links and pay for a
[1:09:50.200 --> 1:09:53.920]  bunch of expensive TV equipment even trying to get the cheap stuff because
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:56.520]  we've already got the studios built we're already reaching millions and
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:59.960]  millions and millions more people every week I want to do free-to-air but
[1:09:59.960 --> 1:10:02.800]  there's a couple different satellites we'd need to put the nightly news up on
[1:10:02.800 --> 1:10:06.880]  because the minute you know the mission isn't just make money in fact that money
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:12.120]  is fuel in the rocket we are trying to basically just do outreach to the world
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:15.760]  like the Christian missionaries do with their satellites that reach hundreds of
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:20.560]  millions that's what we want to be able to do kind of like you know British
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:24.920]  government has channels worldwide the Iranian the Russian the US government I
[1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:29.920]  mean I want to do something like that okay I mean money I don't worship money
[1:10:29.920 --> 1:10:33.360]  I don't worship at the altar of it in fact it's a hassle when it's you'll be
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:36.880]  yours personally you got a fool with it you know you got a car that runs you got
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:41.320]  some money in the bank for your kids you got your bills paid man you're you're
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:44.760]  happy these globalists always want more more more more more because they're like
[1:10:44.760 --> 1:10:50.040]  peacocks showing off to each other but I did realize about five six years ago I
[1:10:50.040 --> 1:10:52.680]  said man we're the best there is I mean when it comes to fight the New World
[1:10:52.680 --> 1:10:55.560]  Order we're reaching two or three million people are more a week some some
[1:10:55.560 --> 1:11:00.240]  weeks more and I was like wow listeners are like you need to do this you need to
[1:11:00.240 --> 1:11:03.600]  do that you need to you need to you need to do a magazine you need to do a
[1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:07.520]  nightly news you need to do I was like you know what you're right so it's taking
[1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:12.320]  me five years to get to this next level 50 crew members 51 crew members and
[1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:16.720]  contractors and now we're finishing up some of the new sets which are good for
[1:11:16.720 --> 1:11:20.400]  different shows we're gonna have a lot of little things your gun shows we're
[1:11:20.400 --> 1:11:25.000]  gonna have you know shows analyzing propaganda not just the nightly news I
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.920]  mean we're really building something here but we're always busy doing all the
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:32.920]  other stuff while we're building it and really having a chunk of cash I mean it
[1:11:32.920 --> 1:11:37.960]  to folks CNN studios and stuff cost three to five million dollars our studio I
[1:11:37.960 --> 1:11:42.080]  don't know that studio back there with all the equipment and the building it
[1:11:42.080 --> 1:11:47.360]  and everything $400,000 our one big TV studio we're putting in some little sets
[1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:51.400]  that are 30 to $50,000 a piece and the equipment getting the new upgrade of
[1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:54.440]  cameras you know that's a couple hundred thousand dollars to have enough for
[1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:58.000]  everybody to use just everything looks really awesome and that's what matters
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:01.080]  nowadays we need to get more crew to be able to not just put stuff in the high
[1:12:01.080 --> 1:12:04.840]  def of a prison planet on TV but as the outreach after its first at prison
[1:12:04.840 --> 1:12:08.840]  planet on TV put it up in high def on YouTube it's just the time to sit there
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:11.920]  and compress it and get it up there we don't have the crew that's why it's in
[1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:15.960]  cruddy res because we're just fast as we can blasting it out we put it out high
[1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:21.200]  res and HD for everybody of you know the archive every night but then I'm not
[1:12:21.200 --> 1:12:25.000]  gonna get into a whole rant about it the point is is that we are dedicated to
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:29.360]  this and so I understand we're in a depression and if I got up here and said
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:32.960]  we absolutely have to have this money or we won't be operating it'd be a lie and
[1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:36.080]  you know I could raise five million dollars like that it was I mean it was
[1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:38.800]  one of my show was a fraction of its audience five years ago that it is now
[1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:42.560]  that Ron Paul came home and not being prompted said half the donations we get
[1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:48.560]  and this campaigner from your listeners I mean that's a big deal well I'm
[1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:52.000]  telling you Ron Paul was there as an educational thing even if he didn't have
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  a very good chance of winning people now know about the fellow reserve of the
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:58.640]  New World Order it's main-lined it so we can then go to the next level you know
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:03.360]  now they're passing legislation in the house to audit the Fed 15 years ago
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:08.280]  Ron Paul couldn't get one co-sponsor so it's a process you know with this war is
[1:13:08.280 --> 1:13:12.680]  a series of little battles and big battles and in between battles and
[1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:17.280]  you're all out there more powerful than you know so what can you do spread the
[1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:21.080]  word about the show on your local AM and FM stations you're listening to
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:25.200]  sponsor the show if you're a local business you know support the First
[1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:28.600]  Amendment support people that'll expose the real corruption and who don't play
[1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:32.280]  games to become trailblazers I've already seen my show this has been admitted
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:37.800]  in major trade publications like talkers and radio ink and others that the
[1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:42.200]  Alex Jones show is the mark in trailblazing alternative media and is
[1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:45.960]  at the very center of the internet revolution just because I was always
[1:13:45.960 --> 1:13:49.440]  trying to find any way I could to reach people and get to them so we were
[1:13:49.440 --> 1:13:53.640]  always trying everything new and so that's why we've been trailblazers you
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:58.520]  know they say necessity is the mother of invention I'm no genius I'm just
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:01.760]  somebody that knows I don't want to be a slave and works hard and you figure it
[1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:05.640]  out by trial and error we still got a lot to figure out okay but but you can
[1:14:05.640 --> 1:14:11.120]  see we're growing fast because we're putting everything we can our backup
[1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:15.080]  money everything into really trying to give a full resistance to the globalist
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:20.480]  I mean not do half measures not wish later we would have done more so I'm
[1:14:20.480 --> 1:14:23.200]  gonna tell you what I told you the last four years with these money bobs this is
[1:14:23.200 --> 1:14:27.720]  the fifth year do not give me money if you are in debt or have bill problems
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:31.200]  I'm like one of these preachers if you're a local business you sponsor our
[1:14:31.200 --> 1:14:33.840]  local AM and FM affiliates because they're awesome they're putting us on
[1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:36.600]  prime time and we're getting great ratings for them but they need the
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:41.520]  sponsorship as well spread the word about the show get a prison planet dot
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:45.880]  TV membership to watch the show not just hear it sign up and get the magazines
[1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:48.720]  that's that those are about pamphlets though these are at cost you can buy them
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:52.120]  in bulk this is about people really appreciate them you know glossy magazine
[1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:55.760]  or no and glossy with all the key info every month to them that's at info
[1:14:55.760 --> 1:15:00.160]  or store.com by the pro pure water filters already discounted 10% nobody's
[1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:03.960]  got them at that price and the profit we make off that is good to fund things
[1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:09.760]  infowarstored.com and but if you're a business owner and you don't like
[1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:13.240]  these wars and you don't like torture and you don't like the corruption let me
[1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:18.360]  tell you there's no bigger bang for the buck than giving money straight up to
[1:15:18.360 --> 1:15:24.120]  infowars.com you know I give money to Salvation Army to mills on wheels
[1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:27.560]  things I know we're good charities wherever 90% of the money actually goes
[1:15:27.560 --> 1:15:33.080]  to the people I give some money not a lot I mean compared to what rich people
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:36.760]  would give I give I give money to groups that buy you know hospital beds and
[1:15:36.760 --> 1:15:41.400]  things for for kids and I do intend you know I'm trying to take you know instead
[1:15:41.400 --> 1:15:44.840]  of keeping profit for myself which I do need to protect myself and be strong
[1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:47.960]  I'm just kind of all in well you know what I'll just I'll just put it all in
[1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:51.680]  to this and then sometimes I have to control myself to not you know give the
[1:15:51.680 --> 1:15:55.000]  money I've got a little bit of money to straight up charity but I go out and do
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  research about what the real charities are my point is this is not a charity
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:03.720]  this is hey you want to help us get bigger guns in the info war then go give
[1:16:03.720 --> 1:16:07.840]  right now at infowarsmoneybomb.com I mean really we need people that are
[1:16:07.840 --> 1:16:11.640]  business owners and are successful and who've got you know just piles of money
[1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:15.480]  in the bank and I know that we know our demographics we have incredibly wealthy
[1:16:15.480 --> 1:16:20.640]  people listening a lot of nouveau riche a lot of middle-class you know who will

[1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:41.600]  involved in anything just take care of yourself and you'll be fine look that's
[1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:45.800]  what's gotten us to this point that's why I've thrown caution to the wind being
[1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:48.320]  threatened and all the stuff that I've been through because I realized there's
[1:16:48.320 --> 1:16:51.880]  no future if we don't stop these globalist so again I haven't really done
[1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:56.000]  the pitch yet because I hate asking for money but I mean that's it folks and

[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:19.440]  for money every day once a year for five years we've done this and here we are
[1:17:19.440 --> 1:17:23.640]  we're doing it and if you want to just really help us expand but not we're not
[1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:27.280]  really expand much more it's more electronic get in fact next year I
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:30.880]  don't intend to grow anymore this is this is enough that we may not even do a
[1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:35.720]  money bomb next year but the point is is that fifth annual money bomb you can
[1:17:35.720 --> 1:17:39.480]  get t-shirts you name it there's also some eBay auctions it's all there info

[1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:49.440]  lot of other really big guests let's go to Michael Bagnarek the presidential
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:55.040]  candidate what was it back in 2004 former Austinite friend of mine about to
[1:17:55.040 --> 1:18:00.840]  dinner many times on access TV on Max 16 years ago 17 years ago really you know
[1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:03.800]  getting politically involved at the same time we've been involved before that but
[1:18:03.800 --> 1:18:07.560]  in Austin we're about to go to break my friend it's great to have you on in fact
[1:18:07.560 --> 1:18:12.280]  I had your bio info I want to be sure and plug your plug your website as well
[1:18:12.280 --> 1:18:15.560]  here because that's important in the Constitution classes and your new book
[1:18:15.560 --> 1:18:19.080]  that's coming out and all you're doing but just we're going to break here but
[1:18:19.080 --> 1:18:23.440]  in two minutes the state of the world I mean how crazy does it have to get
[1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:28.240]  before we really wake up oh I wish I knew the answer to that question it is
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:35.920]  going over the edge everybody realizes that there are economic problems the
[1:18:35.920 --> 1:18:41.080]  price of gasoline is going up the price of food is going up and what really is
[1:18:41.080 --> 1:18:46.560]  happening is the value of our money is going down and the United States is in
[1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:51.440]  good shape compared to other countries in the world so if people think they're
[1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:56.800]  hurt now they just have to wait a couple more months and the real pain is
[1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:02.600]  going to start I heard you last week on I think it was real
[1:19:02.600 --> 1:19:06.240]  law radio and you were pointing out I want to come back with this and
[1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:10.680]  whatever you want to get into it's such an honor to have you Michael I heard you
[1:19:10.680 --> 1:19:14.160]  talking about hey just because they pass a law did mean you have to follow it and
[1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:17.480]  then that's in the Constitution that's in the Bill of Rights that's in jurisprudence
[1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:20.560]  that's in Magna Carta I mean if the government says you got to give us your
[1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:23.880]  daughters you know to have sex with and they used to have that in Europe you
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:28.160]  could say no they announced black people or slaves tomorrow and try to pass that
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:31.160]  law which wouldn't happen the point is you could say no I mean if they say I've
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:34.560]  got to go work in a slave pit because they say so no I have a right to fight
[1:19:34.560 --> 1:19:37.600]  back and I want to talk about that because I'm not somebody that runs
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:41.400]  around calling for violence and stuff but defensively you know there's coming
[1:19:41.400 --> 1:19:46.440]  a time where the tyrants can only push so far and we'll be right back with
[1:19:46.440 --> 1:19:50.920]  Michael Bagnaric for the balance of the hour and we'll break down where he sees
[1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:54.240]  the world going and we'll take some calls and Max Kaiser is coming up for two
[1:19:54.240 --> 1:19:57.800]  hours we'll take calls pretty much the whole time he's on with us so your calls
[1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:03.320]  are coming up stay with us Aaron Fullen here as the food police shut down food
[1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:07.520]  co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access not just a
[1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:10.800]  raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for
[1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:14.420]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[1:20:14.420 --> 1:20:18.320]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not

[1:23:12.840 --> 1:23:18.760]  most shocking news story of 2012 Obama's secret war on coal that could increase
[1:23:18.760 --> 1:23:23.960]  your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months as shocking as it

[1:23:27.840 --> 1:23:32.360]  across America but here's some good news there's an underground video at
[1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:36.720]  exposed one two three dot com that thousands of smart patriots have used
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:41.440]  to end their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the video at exposed
[1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:45.680]  one two three dot com has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is
[1:23:45.680 --> 1:23:49.800]  doing everything in its power to take it down and keep America in the dark so
[1:23:49.800 --> 1:23:54.600]  watch it now at exposed one two three dot com before it's too late again that's
[1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:58.720]  exposed one two three dot com
[1:23:58.720 --> 1:24:13.360]  if it keeps on raining love is gonna break when the levee it breaks I have no
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:23.040]  place to stay going down going down now going down going down now yeah the
[1:24:23.040 --> 1:24:37.840]  dollars going down sir one more time oh it's coming oh yeah we are back live
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:41.400]  ladies and gentlemen I'm getting a little dingy because I got about three
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:44.800]  hours sleep last night I went and did coast to coast a.m. and then came back
[1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:50.160]  early this morning and we had crew overnight doing a fabulous job some of
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:54.040]  the reporters and and and people in here all right Michael McNerrick I'm gonna
[1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:57.360]  shut up let's repeat the point you made in the Constitution Bill of Rights
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:01.240]  jurisprudence about the fact they just keep passing all these laws or there's
[1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:04.800]  not even have a law that the TSA can do what they do they just do it they're
[1:25:04.800 --> 1:25:08.520]  not even sworn officers a sworn officer couldn't do that what do you call this
[1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:13.360]  lawlessness of government that's just going rampantly wild right now and why
[1:25:13.360 --> 1:25:16.920]  do you think they're doing this I mean is it just that they've learned they can
[1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:21.920]  get away with it so they are I mean we see history repeating itself get into
[1:25:21.920 --> 1:25:25.200]  that precept though the fact that you know they could announce we're all
[1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:29.760]  slaves tomorrow didn't mean it's really the law yes that's true and and the
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:34.680]  phrase I say is that if Congress passed a law that I was a seven foot tall
[1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:40.200]  purple rabbit that doesn't make it true I'm not seven foot tall I'm not purple
[1:25:40.200 --> 1:25:45.080]  and I'm not a rabbit but if they declare seven foot tall purple rabbit hunting
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:48.920]  season I might be in a little bit of trouble if they have my name on the
[1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:55.000]  list the but you are correct it's mostly because Americans go along with it
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:05.600]  the the problem is that we are so taught to conform to society and submit to
[1:26:05.600 --> 1:26:12.520]  authority that we don't even question if either you or I went out we asked a
[1:26:12.520 --> 1:26:16.280]  young lady to raise her arms up so we could take a naked photo of her I mean
[1:26:16.280 --> 1:26:21.320]  we'd be slept with a harassment suit but that happens every day every moment at
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:25.600]  the airports in the country you know they just and people just filed through
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:30.160]  the the body scan machine you know they're going to visit grandma they
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:38.080]  really pay no attention to what is happening and I used to think I used to
[1:26:38.080 --> 1:26:46.640]  think that survival self-preservation was built in was a DNA encoded you know
[1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:54.320]  response but I was talking to somebody and in the process of doing this
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:58.440]  discussion I asked him what he would do if he was walking down the sidewalk and
[1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:02.600]  somebody started to choke him and he's well I poke him in the eye step on his
[1:27:02.600 --> 1:27:07.920]  foot you know that you some form of you know violence to stop the attack and I
[1:27:07.920 --> 1:27:12.400]  said well what would happen or what would you do if the person choking you was
[1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:16.720]  in a uniform and had a badge what if it was a policeman joking you and I'm not
[1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:21.360]  kidding they said they have to stand there and let it happen because you're
[1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:28.760]  not allowed to resist the police and I was speechless which as you know doesn't
[1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:34.600]  happen very often for me there are people genuinely who walk around with the idea
[1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:39.320]  in their head that if an authority figure tells them to do something they
[1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:44.920]  are obligated to do it and we need to change that philosophy in the United
[1:27:44.920 --> 1:27:49.800]  States that's the core it's totally un-American but we've been taught being
[1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:54.480]  American and being free means you wear giant chains and literally kiss the
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:58.300]  rear end of any bureaucrat immediately I mean that could be the new salute in
[1:27:58.300 --> 1:28:02.320]  America it's not just the TSA grabbing our genitals but we can run like a dog
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:06.360]  and just shove our nose into the butt crack of the nearest bureaucrat and then
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:09.960]  worship them and then they would taser us and beat our brains out and roll
[1:28:09.960 --> 1:28:15.560]  around in our blood and that could be the new American handshake and I would
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:21.000]  in continuing that discussion just because something is a lot doesn't make
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:27.880]  it legitimate Hitler never did anything against law he just passed a law that
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:33.800]  said that it was okay to do the things that he did and in the United States we
[1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:40.080]  all you know prefer to think of us as good law-abiding citizens but at what
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:48.360]  cost I mean how far did we go you know to listen to authority in the 1933
[1:28:48.360 --> 1:28:54.320]  Franklin Delano Roosevelt said that it was now illegal for people to own gold
[1:28:54.320 --> 1:29:00.040]  and that everybody was supposed to turn their gold in to in a Washington DC and
[1:29:00.040 --> 1:29:04.680]  I mean it's surprising that a president of the United States who'd taken oaths of
[1:29:04.680 --> 1:29:10.160]  office would get on a balcony and say that what is even more stunning is that
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:15.120]  American citizens would actually turn in their gold now I know that there were
[1:29:15.120 --> 1:29:22.320]  some that did not but we have 23,000 gun laws in this country all of which are
[1:29:22.320 --> 1:29:27.400]  unconstitutional as you well know they're getting ready to pass the yeah
[1:29:27.400 --> 1:29:30.640]  let's talk about that when we come back and it's also sounds like you're at Cape
[1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:35.080]  Carnaveral sometimes layer rockets launching but I kind of like it what
[1:29:35.080 --> 1:29:38.360]  do they have like 18 monkeys with pots and pans in the background beating them
[1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:42.480]  on their heads all right folks I'm sorry when I have a head sleep look out you

[1:34:12.120 --> 1:34:15.560]  where is it going I mean I mean here's an example out of the Huffden Post
[1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:20.920]  Associated Press and the sign and the teachers this came out yesterday it
[1:34:20.920 --> 1:34:30.040]  happened two days ago the the iPad that the class was using her phone synced
[1:34:30.040 --> 1:34:34.360]  with it because she'd been loading stuff on it and it was her sending pictures
[1:34:34.360 --> 1:34:38.680]  of her brass to her boyfriend and they said doesn't matter zero tolerance you
[1:34:38.680 --> 1:34:43.200]  saw it so you're suspended and the point is I see this more and more where
[1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:47.720]  things are just totally nonsensical on purpose she's not in trouble you're in
[1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:53.280]  trouble and they say yes you were doing your your your you know group learning
[1:34:53.280 --> 1:34:57.000]  on these iPads because it's like groups of four with each one yes it synced and
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.520]  went on there because she's put stuff off her phone on that but you're in
[1:34:59.520 --> 1:35:04.400]  trouble and I see this more and more where you know they'll taser someone
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:07.880]  having a seizure and then say well they deserve it he didn't follow orders but
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:10.560]  he was having a seizure he was unconscious well he's bad we're a
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:14.440]  rest you know I mean more and more it's like government it seems nonsensical but
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:20.240]  they know what they're doing they're just bringing an unreality to things now
[1:35:20.240 --> 1:35:24.320]  where they're always good and you're always bad to be a citizen is to be a
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:29.480]  slave is to be trash is to be scum to be government is to be God and to be
[1:35:29.480 --> 1:35:34.040]  be a global corporates you know controls the government is is is to be God I
[1:35:34.040 --> 1:35:36.560]  want to get into your new book that's coming out I can't wait to read it tell
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:42.760]  us about that but where do you see all this going Michael Bagnari the economy
[1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:47.040]  in the United States and indeed at the entire world is going to crash people
[1:35:47.040 --> 1:35:52.920]  who don't have a year to a year and a half supply of food the people who have
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:58.680]  not converted their paper money into silver and gold are literally not gonna
[1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:05.760]  survive this is like the most dreadful game of musical chairs and speaking of
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:11.280]  musical chairs what's going on where you're at I'm sorry Alex I I've given
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:16.680]  interviews in this lobby before but today they decided to mop and clean and
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:21.320]  the maid is moving the chairs around why don't we just give them some like some
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:24.640]  lightsabers they have a battle in there's what it sounds like it yeah
[1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:33.040]  Darth Vader who I find your lack of faith disturbing impressive most
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:40.000]  impressive honor bonds to roll out honor bonds to roll out I am Optimus Prime
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:46.440]  the Cube and I'm starting to get into the mode now that made him stop that made
[1:36:46.440 --> 1:36:54.280]  him stop telling the name of Darth Vader cease and desist immediately so so how
[1:36:54.280 --> 1:37:01.200]  much red bull have you had over the last two days I yes I think you've had on
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:05.440]  it I've had too much I've had too much pollen burst and a root of my coffee
[1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:10.960]  brother I did the same thing when I was driving the U-Haul down from Indiana to
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:16.680]  Texas drinking coffee and red bull my eyes were about a half an inch wider than
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:27.720]  they usually are honor bonds roll out the problem is very serious and it's
[1:37:27.720 --> 1:37:32.280]  made more serious by the fact that people are in denial or completely
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:37.720]  unaware of the problem I tell people the economy's gonna crash and people are
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:41.640]  gonna starve to death and they just kind of nod their head they figure Michael is
[1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:46.440]  just being you know using hyperbole again I went to a presentation by Peter
[1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:53.800]  Schiff he was talking about the future economy and selling his new book the
[1:37:53.800 --> 1:38:00.160]  real crash and he put it into such detail that even the people who went to
[1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:05.080]  see him who undoubtedly are aware of the problem least a little bit I mean the
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:10.280]  audience was going huh oh my god I mean we couldn't believe how black of a
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:14.080]  picture he was painting and by the way that's what all the numbers show even
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:18.040]  sticklet says it's a global depression now break down what he was saying there
[1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:24.080]  and because it's this learned helplessness it's this it's it's this
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:28.720]  normalcy bias where you can tell people now hey they got a proxy war the Russians
[1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:31.480]  in Syria and the Russians are threatening to start nuke in Europe who
[1:38:31.480 --> 1:38:35.880]  are like oh what's a Russian god I hope they nick man but you know if their
[1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:38.840]  neighbor's dog goes to the bathroom in their yard they're ready to kill them
[1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:42.240]  but if government's violating them or robbing them it's like it's almost cool
[1:38:42.240 --> 1:38:48.800]  to be run over and be a slave right well I can't remember all the details but
[1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:53.880]  basically Peter was saying that as bad as things are in the United States it is
[1:38:53.880 --> 1:39:00.840]  much worse over in Europe he said that Greece and Spain and Italy are
[1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:08.120]  basically falling apart and it's based on loaning money you borrow money you can't
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:11.880]  pay the money back so you borrow more money to pay that back and then you
[1:39:11.880 --> 1:39:17.640]  borrow more money again and what the people loaning money do is they reduce
[1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:22.640]  the interest rate to make it easier for you to borrow is that you're not in
[1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:27.600]  trouble when the interest rate is low but when that interest rate goes back up
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:33.440]  you are screwed and he said that's exactly what has happened in all these
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:38.080]  European countries right now he said the interest rate in the United States is
[1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:45.400]  practically zero and he says that people are still buying US Treasury bonds not
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:51.640]  because US Treasury bonds are so good but by comparison to Europe they are not
[1:39:51.640 --> 1:39:57.880]  as bad and he says as soon as the banks start to raise the interest rates in
[1:39:57.880 --> 1:40:01.640]  the United States things are gonna go to hell in a hand basket yeah that's when
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:05.720]  the inflation the real inflation is gonna start and then it's gonna be auto
[1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:10.880]  bonds rollout can can you do an optimist prime and impersonation Michael
[1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:17.040]  I really don't how about Starscream do you do that I don't even know what
[1:40:17.040 --> 1:40:26.680]  Starscream is Megatron I am the leader I like to do Clint Eastwood go ahead make
[1:40:26.680 --> 1:40:33.960]  my day go ahead punk make my day I can do Bill Clinton I did not have sex with
[1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:41.720]  that woman Monica Lewinsky how dare you hey hey seriously I'm yeah I'm being a
[1:40:41.720 --> 1:40:44.800]  bit dingy and then there was all the bang in the background which would sound
[1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:48.840]  like a Cape Canaveral launch but but I I apologize Michael I am in kind of a
[1:40:48.840 --> 1:40:52.280]  giddy mood here I think from too much caffeine and being totally exhausted
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:56.600]  here in the 48-hour transmission money bomb what is your prognosis I mean look
[1:40:56.600 --> 1:40:59.800]  you got Americans buying guns three four five million a month they say they
[1:40:59.800 --> 1:41:02.240]  don't trust the government you've got a huge group of people probably a hundred
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:05.720]  million that really know we're in deep trouble you've got another hundred
[1:41:05.720 --> 1:41:09.200]  million that don't know which planets are on and another hundred million that
[1:41:09.200 --> 1:41:11.920]  just want a party and have a good time and that's an oversimplification or
[1:41:11.920 --> 1:41:16.120]  bureaucrats and what's gonna happen when things really start accelerating in the
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:19.280]  collapse that now more and more is a foregone conclusion
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:23.760]  government's digging in the 1.6 billion bullets what do you expect to happen I
[1:41:23.760 --> 1:41:29.000]  think we've got a good chance because of your work Ron Paul our listeners myself
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:34.040]  and Optimus Prime and many others I believe that we have a good chance being
[1:41:34.040 --> 1:41:38.400]  serious here you know to actually say hey see big government and tyranny and
[1:41:38.400 --> 1:41:42.760]  cider good ol boy deals it screwed things up let's go back to the Republic but
[1:41:42.760 --> 1:41:50.360]  I think now is the prime battle I agree I agree there are a lot of people that you
[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:54.880]  and I have spoken to over the years that get it they are stocking up on food they
[1:41:54.880 --> 1:42:00.400]  are ready to go and I've had people telling me privately that I mean they
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:06.800]  are locked in loaded and just waiting to see what's gonna happen next the people
[1:42:06.800 --> 1:42:12.480]  who are kind of on the fence they don't believe that it's going to happen or
[1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:16.560]  they don't believe that it's as bad as you and I tell them when it starts to
[1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:20.720]  happen they are gonna come to Jesus very quickly they are gonna be knocking on
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:25.000]  our door you and I are gonna be getting phone calls about oh my gosh what do we
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:30.880]  do so we're gonna have a majority of those people on our side the people who
[1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:35.280]  are concerned that the government to the army has all the guns you can't fight
[1:42:35.280 --> 1:42:40.400]  against the tank or an f-16 you've got to remember that the people that are
[1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:46.480]  operating those war machines are on our side I mean they they cannot be vocal
[1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:53.880]  they can't get up and well they do occasionally we had the one Marine who
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:58.320]  posted on Facebook and immediately they dragged him off to an insane asylum
[1:42:58.320 --> 1:43:02.640]  because he was crazy for you know challenging the government the
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:07.680]  military is on our side we're going to restore liberty it's not gonna be pretty
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:12.440]  in some cases there's gonna be a lot of a shortage of food a shortage of
[1:43:12.440 --> 1:43:18.440]  electricity and people are gonna have to learn how to kind of camp out wherever
[1:43:18.440 --> 1:43:23.440]  they're living but there's also gonna be a little bit of budget the people who
[1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:27.560]  are unprepared they're gonna be going door-to-door looking for your last
[1:43:27.560 --> 1:43:32.280]  jar of peanut butter and you don't need to have a gun so much protect yourself
[1:43:32.280 --> 1:43:36.200]  against the IRS and the ATF you need to have the gun to protect yourself
[1:43:36.200 --> 1:43:42.280]  against the the neighbor who's is gonna try to take your food it's gonna be like
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:47.880]  the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict it's gonna be like that pretty
[1:43:47.880 --> 1:43:53.360]  much wall-to-wall coast-to-coast and by the way government insiders I mean they've
[1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:57.240]  got the former Solicitor General excuse me Comptroller I mean they're all
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:44:01.480]  coming out saying the same thing and government is really digging in against
[1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:07.080]  us and but the ADL the Southern Primary Law Center say we're extremists Michael
[1:44:07.080 --> 1:44:11.760]  if we talk about it well yeah I'm extremist I'm not gonna let anybody take
[1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:16.440]  my stuff or hurt me you know I'm willing to defend myself that makes me an
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:24.440]  extreme I find your lack of faith disturbing but there are organizations
[1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:30.600]  who are working to establish a proper Republican form of government so that
[1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:34.920]  when the existing government crumbles that there will be another one ready to
[1:44:34.920 --> 1:44:39.960]  take its place one that goes back to the fundamentals the founding fathers
[1:44:39.960 --> 1:44:44.680]  documented in all of our our Constitution Declaration of Independence
[1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:50.160]  the United States that everybody thinks they live in so there are a lot of
[1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:57.800]  people being prepared and it's kind of that quiet before the storm there's
[1:44:57.800 --> 1:45:02.720]  that little tension in the air don't act so surprised your highness you aren't
[1:45:02.720 --> 1:45:07.360]  on any mercy mission this time several transmissions were beamed to this ship I
[1:45:07.360 --> 1:45:13.720]  want to know what happened to the plans they sent you so I've got my lightsabers
[1:45:13.720 --> 1:45:22.120]  already I've got I'm sorry so but I'm also trying to spread that knowledge the
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:26.600]  the information that you and I have been trying to teach for so many years I've
[1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:32.360]  recently put into a new book called the secret to sovereignty and if you've had
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:37.360]  a chance to read the preface you'll know that I say I have the answer but you're
[1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:45.000]  not gonna like it and I think it'll be a really important book once that gets out
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:49.400]  well I agree with you here buddy and look it's important more than ever people
[1:45:49.400 --> 1:45:53.520]  to get prepared but also support venues and outlets that's what this show is all
[1:45:53.520 --> 1:45:56.360]  about people supporting and getting your incredible work and getting it out to
[1:45:56.360 --> 1:46:01.520]  others at constitutionpreservation.org people supporting you know Ron Paul in
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:05.520]  the past helping educate people because it's a series of battles in this war
[1:46:05.520 --> 1:46:09.000]  people supporting all the countless researchers and fighters for liberty we
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:13.080]  have on the show it's why we're having donations today 48 hour broadcast and I've
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:17.040]  gotten a bit dingy I'll quit having fun here but me and Michael are old friends so
[1:46:17.040 --> 1:46:20.120]  I I don't think we ever we used to go out libertarians to dinner though I think I
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:22.800]  never did the Darth Vader limitations there I'm kind of reverting back to 12
[1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:27.440]  years old here but actually I like voiceovers by the way national top
[1:46:27.440 --> 1:46:31.640]  voiceover talent John B. Wells is also syndicated radio host Costa Costa
[1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:35.480]  him.com he's gonna be co-hosting for a couple hours coming up later in the
[1:46:35.480 --> 1:46:40.160]  afternoon Max Kaiser is coming up let me give the number out for a few calls for
[1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:43.160]  Michael Bagnaric if you disagree with him or agree with him or disagree with me
[1:46:43.160 --> 1:46:48.400]  or you don't think I should be doing James Earl Jones limitations 800 259
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:58.560]  92 31 800 259 92 31 and we will put you in the arena right now I may even talk to
[1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:03.760]  you in an Optimus Prime voice or I may sing rock and roll songs you never know
[1:47:03.760 --> 1:47:06.560]  what's gonna happen when I haven't got any sleep and I've had five cups of
[1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:10.120]  coffee this morning so far executive cups I had one of the first cups to come
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:15.320]  out this morning and I think that's part of the problem so anyways ladies and
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:21.400]  gentlemen Michael Bagnaric is our guest 800 259 92 31 you know I sit here and
[1:47:21.400 --> 1:47:25.760]  joke around kind of gallows humor because the sands of time for our
[1:47:25.760 --> 1:47:30.520]  Republic are running low and it makes me very very upset I mean I get mad at the
[1:47:30.520 --> 1:47:33.760]  globalist because I know they're dangerous and I know we're on a collision
[1:47:33.760 --> 1:47:37.160]  course and I know I'm not stopping I'm not bowing down and you know kissing
[1:47:37.160 --> 1:47:42.560]  their work-covered toes so I'm just angry that there's such scum and I'm
[1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:46.040]  also mad at the public because these evil doers are pretty weak and pathetic
[1:47:46.040 --> 1:47:50.000]  they just getting big games but historically I know we're going to
[1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.600]  beat these people and I think if we can beat them we're gonna really see a true
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:48:01.280]  you know ascendancy of Liberty and and and it's an absolutely new era what do
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:05.560]  you think about that Michael Bagnaric absolutely absolutely and it just
[1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:10.040]  crossed my mind that you in my limited amount of time I want all of your
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:16.320]  listeners to download the law written by Frederick Bastiat so small pamphlet
[1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:21.040]  excellent if it takes you longer than two hours to read it your daydream and
[1:48:21.040 --> 1:48:27.320]  doing something else download the law by Frederick Bastiat that will explain the
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:32.920]  way the government is supposed to work and it will do it in such clear concise
[1:48:32.920 --> 1:48:38.040]  terms you won't have any doubt that most of what our government does today is
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:44.360]  unconstitutional well said I mean people need to learn that our ancestors
[1:48:44.360 --> 1:48:48.120]  humans only live 75 years on average we go through the same stuff over and over
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:52.400]  again those of us that know history are going oh man oh we know what happens
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:56.360]  next oh because once you get a tyranny the worst to get in and then they're
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:49:00.880]  replaced with even more bad and it's like a race to the most evil and then the
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:04.920]  worst people you could imagine get in control and then things go to hell in a
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:12.040]  handbasket and it's because of our lack of vigilance you know Thomas Jefferson
[1:49:12.040 --> 1:49:17.680]  said the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and when I give presentations
[1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:21.600]  I'll say raise your hand if you're a good patriotic American everybody raises
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:25.440]  their hand raise your hand if you can tell me how many articles are in the
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:31.400]  Constitution nobody it's like what's your standard for good patriotic America
[1:49:31.400 --> 1:49:35.960]  you can dress yourself in the morning I think we ought to raise the standard for
[1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:42.400]  what a good patriotic American really is well I agree with you we're gonna go to
[1:49:42.400 --> 1:49:46.120]  break here in about a minute and come back and take a few calls for two short

[1:49:49.920 --> 1:49:55.880]  Canaveral and I'm settling down as well so we're gonna go to break and come back

[1:56:12.400 --> 1:56:17.880]  planned out it's fun to lose your mind welcome to the club huh yeah I've been
[1:56:17.880 --> 1:56:22.280]  trying to I've been trying to scoop it up after all these years of four eyes and
[1:56:22.280 --> 1:56:27.720]  television you know I'm still you have done well and the reality seriously
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:30.760]  what's your what's your question for Michael Bagnarott here my friend my
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:38.680]  little green friend how can we get through to people because 2012 has just
[1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:43.760]  been blown up and everybody's face on TV and the media everywhere nobody like
[1:56:43.760 --> 1:56:46.960]  wants to listen to it anymore and now that it's getting more serious than
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:51.880]  ever everybody's just tuning out and just not even listen I disagree with you
[1:56:51.880 --> 1:56:55.120]  and I appreciate your call you know I either get callers that say everybody's
[1:56:55.120 --> 1:57:00.640]  waking up I talked to or I get calls saying no one's waking up and I found
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:03.920]  that you know if you're confident about stuff and you're talking to people that
[1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:07.480]  know how to tie their shoelaces they everybody knows stuff's wrong and wants
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:10.480]  to do something about it they just don't know what to do about it I don't
[1:57:10.480 --> 1:57:13.160]  know where all these people are that don't want to wake up and stuff I mean
[1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:17.880]  I mean I'm not trying to be mean but I mean is it like in a mortuary or
[1:57:17.880 --> 1:57:20.600]  something I mean anybody who's alive knows things are wrong I don't think
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:24.040]  anybody denies that Michael have you noticed this paradox Michael Bagnarott
[1:57:24.040 --> 1:57:28.120]  our guest of either people that you talked to her awake and say everybody
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:31.360]  they know is awake or you hear these people that say no one listens to me I
[1:57:31.360 --> 1:57:37.840]  don't know where this is well when they say no one listens to me it's usually
[1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:44.720]  because they are doing the the elevator pitch you know they've taken 10 15 20
[1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:49.840]  years to figure out that things are not right the Federal Reserve is you know
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:54.920]  evil and they'll get in an elevator in the lobby and between the lobby and the
[1:57:54.920 --> 1:57:59.000]  10th floor they grab somebody look by the lapels and they say the Federal Reserve
[1:57:59.000 --> 1:58:03.700]  is unconstitutional the world is going down and basket and people run off the
[1:58:03.700 --> 1:58:09.560]  elevator because you know this person has tried to teach them 20 years of
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:17.200]  education in 15 seconds you have to give people time to absorb the information
[1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:20.500]  yeah also a lot of people know what's going on they're just scared and keep
[1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:24.840]  their mouth shut I mean a lot of people are walnut brains too that's my name
[1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:28.560]  for like I had to call the dogs in my house walnut brains I mean I like them
[1:58:28.560 --> 1:58:31.640]  they're sweet but you know they they well they're not humans and they behave
[1:58:31.640 --> 1:58:35.040]  badly sometimes but a lot of my dogs are smart and a lot of people I know and
[1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:40.640]  hey walnut brains need to be triage just move on folks

[1:58:54.520 --> 1:58:58.400]  small farmers Americans are losing access not just to raw milk and homemade
[1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:01.720]  cheeses but to healthy homecrafted sources for fermented foods like
[1:59:01.720 --> 1:59:05.560]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with
[1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:09.040]  living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food
[1:59:09.040 --> 1:59:12.040]  police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since the
[1:59:12.040 --> 1:59:15.200]  beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and
[1:59:15.200 --> 1:59:18.680]  beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today
[1:59:18.680 --> 1:59:23.200]  Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in
[1:59:23.200 --> 1:59:26.640]  India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's some good

[2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:44.360]  a potbellied globalist I understand that Jack in Texas and Philip and others
[2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:47.920]  you're on the air with Michael Badneric of Constitution Preservation dot
[2:00:47.920 --> 2:00:55.000]  ORG got a question for him sir kind of a comment I I expressed this on another
[2:00:55.000 --> 2:01:01.440]  show and it was meant with like vitro all of like but the thing is I think when
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:07.600]  we wake up the great day will be when they have the election and nobody shows
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.760]  up because I think what they do is they pit us against each other we throw out
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:16.960]  these labels I'm on this side I'm on that side you're on this side yeah and
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:22.000]  when we go to vote I mean it's like I'm voting for my guy and I'm voting for my
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:25.640]  guy but we don't realize I hear you know you're right I mean when when they
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:29.880]  control both of both the candidates it becomes a distraction from local elections
[2:01:29.880 --> 2:01:35.240]  where you get 8% turnout 55% national on average and then it's such a big band
[2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:40.440]  wagon that you know yeah you get sucked in even if you know it's a dog and pony
[2:01:40.440 --> 2:01:44.560]  show I hear you that's why people should vote for you know other candidates or
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:48.080]  run locally Michael Bagneric your comments on what he's saying yeah I
[2:01:48.080 --> 2:01:54.440]  agree we talk to people they said well I'm African-American I can tell by
[2:01:54.440 --> 2:02:00.400]  looking but my the thing that is important to be is that you are American
[2:02:00.400 --> 2:02:04.920]  I don't care if you're African-American Asian-American the United States is
[2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.600]  supposed to be a melting pot we're supposed to be the only country that was
[2:02:08.600 --> 2:02:14.160]  ever created based on ideology so as long as you believe in the Bill of Rights
[2:02:14.160 --> 2:02:22.240]  and you know private property then you know weird brothers and sisters well
[2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:27.320]  said sir anything else Jack in extremist Texas listening on I point one yeah
[2:02:27.320 --> 2:02:30.880]  yeah you know everybody loves sunshine and fresh air I mean everybody black
[2:02:30.880 --> 2:02:37.080]  white whatever and long as we let mainstream media and the construct
[2:02:37.080 --> 2:02:42.200]  define us and label us like I don't I don't call myself African-American I
[2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:48.720]  think that's so so silly we we long as we let them define us and keep us in
[2:02:48.720 --> 2:02:55.760]  these little groups it's useless and as long as it and you know Alex I've been
[2:02:55.760 --> 2:02:59.200]  listening to you since wake up I know everything you said was true and I knew
[2:02:59.200 --> 2:03:02.160]  when I was in the sixth grade I knew something wasn't right you know because
[2:03:02.160 --> 2:03:05.680]  I've you know about sixth grade and during the Vietnam War and I knew that
[2:03:05.680 --> 2:03:10.680]  something right about this but if you'll notice nothing has changed I've been
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:14.800]  through I think when I was you know old enough Reagan was the president and
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:20.240]  nothing's really changed for me but they keep this this wedge in between us and
[2:03:20.240 --> 2:03:25.840]  they dust just keeping control and if you when you report stuff out of the
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:33.040]  mainstream like the the birther thing or anything like Obama deception then
[2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.080]  somebody listening you'll turn them off because they think oh this is some right
[2:03:37.080 --> 2:03:41.600]  wing I heard you say they accuse you of being a right wing guy but I know no
[2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:46.520]  exactly what but really Obama deception is about how it's all controlled it's
[2:03:46.520 --> 2:03:49.880]  not even really about Obama that's the that's the secret of the Obama deception
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:53.600]  and so it has woken up a lot of right wingers establishment right wingers I
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:56.600]  mean I'm more aligned what you'd call right wing because they call it right
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:00.080]  wing to be anti-abortion pro-gun pro-family but the Republicans don't
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:04.960]  really defend that and it's it's a scary thing thank you so much well but we got
[2:04:04.960 --> 2:04:07.920]  more calls coming up Michael Bagnaris gonna leave us Michael I want to get you

[2:07:02.920 --> 2:07:07.080]  shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access
[2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:10.560]  not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy homecrafted
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:14.120]  sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems
[2:07:14.120 --> 2:07:17.960]  there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but
[2:07:17.960 --> 2:07:20.720]  frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these
[2:07:20.720 --> 2:07:23.480]  remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[2:07:23.480 --> 2:07:26.640]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[2:07:26.640 --> 2:07:30.960]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:35.440]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[2:07:35.440 --> 2:07:38.800]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now
[2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:42.040]  discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and
[2:07:42.040 --> 2:07:45.520]  privately in their own homes since it's still legal to make these foods as long
[2:07:45.520 --> 2:07:48.720]  as you can make them yourself for more information check out fermentation

[2:08:25.280 --> 2:08:32.040]  we're gonna take your calls cover the economy so much more a judge has ruled
[2:08:32.040 --> 2:08:35.760]  and I just had it here in front of me we'll cover it in a moment that oh this
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:40.200]  kind of a evidence is clear that cell phones are causing brain cancer folks
[2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:44.320]  30 years ago when they really started to poor to proliferate them I've had the
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:48.120]  guests on the doctors have gone over the studies they knew in lab rat studies it
[2:08:48.120 --> 2:08:52.120]  was giving them all sorts of tumors it basically rattles the DNA they their
[2:08:52.120 --> 2:08:57.040]  studies for decades admitting cell phones heat the brain and just type this
[2:08:57.040 --> 2:09:02.240]  in cell phones heat the brain and here I am I mean I use hands-free we also have
[2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:05.120]  these systems of phones you plug in you know it's like a regular phone into it
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:08.400]  but I still forget and use the cell phone we still let our kids have them we
[2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:13.640]  still have them in our house I know all this but I got used to using them you
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:16.960]  know they're very useful I can conduct all sorts of little business things I
[2:09:16.960 --> 2:09:20.600]  have to do and then news things while I'm driving to and from work I get more
[2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:23.840]  done actually in the 35-minute drive 40-minute drive every day to and fro
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:29.800]  so I can just focus and go through the calls but I'm killing myself and you know
[2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:33.800]  I try to mitigate that as best I can I go ahead and bring that in Dan I've
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:38.000]  printed it twice and who knows what I've done with it thank you so here is that
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.200]  report a mobile phones can cause brain tumors court rules London Telegraph a
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:46.800]  landmark court cases rule there is a link between using a mobile phone and
[2:09:46.800 --> 2:09:51.520]  brain tumors paving the way for a flood of legal actions and they're talking
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:54.320]  about in Europe and the US as well as England just creating like with the
[2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:58.640]  vaccines a federal damage fund where tax money will be paid to people that can
[2:09:58.640 --> 2:10:03.840]  jump through thousands of hoops to get a paltry sum and it says innocent a
[2:10:03.840 --> 2:10:08.520]  Marla Coney 60 an Italian businessman fell ill after using a hand set at work
[2:10:08.520 --> 2:10:13.720]  for up to six hours a day for 12 years yeah everybody around here in the office
[2:10:13.720 --> 2:10:18.000]  uses their cell phones to make calls and I'm like hey hey looky here I got
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:22.560]  landlines landlines and I've tried to make myself learn to use the landline my
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:26.880]  wife's always using cell phones at home we did not be lazy use the cell phone to
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:30.440]  get the numbers out of it it's still doing some transmitting but only as the
[2:10:30.440 --> 2:10:33.840]  GPS tracks you you'll you'll you'll hear like a little ping here a little ping
[2:10:33.840 --> 2:10:37.600]  there but it's not the continued microwaving and so let's all make a
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:42.560]  commitment stop using cell phones and and and and if you're gonna cook your
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:47.480]  shelf move it around put it you know on the dash of the car and have it
[2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:52.360]  wireless or you know a cord put it other places you just be but this is how
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:55.600]  they kill us they they implement something they tell you it's fine it's a
[2:10:55.600 --> 2:10:59.200]  conspiracy theory 20 years ago it's not gonna hurt you all the studies keep
[2:10:59.200 --> 2:11:02.400]  coming out and then everybody's just addicted to it everybody's just gonna
[2:11:02.400 --> 2:11:06.520]  kill themselves like a lot of studies show it's worse than smoking cigarettes
[2:11:06.520 --> 2:11:11.360]  two packs a day Cheryl Crowe says she got it you know brain tumor now we had
[2:11:11.360 --> 2:11:16.320]  breast tumor now you know I mean you know cancer is forever folks and I know
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:19.840]  I'm an extremist in evil and a conspiracy theorist but you know it's
[2:11:19.840 --> 2:11:23.680]  time to really realize that the cell towers by your house all the schools
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:26.520]  around the country they get paid money to put the cell tower right on top of it
[2:11:26.520 --> 2:11:30.080]  I mean let me go on this flash they've done studies big ones university studies
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:33.680]  where the bugs and the plants don't grow as well and get sick around the cell
[2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:40.800]  towers because you know all of the electromagnetic radiation all of it is
[2:11:40.800 --> 2:11:45.680]  just absolutely devastating now Italy Supreme Court in Rome has blamed his
[2:11:45.680 --> 2:11:51.360]  phone singer as a casual link between his illness and phone use the son has
[2:11:51.360 --> 2:11:57.280]  reported mr. Mark Coloni shed of the significant for very many people I
[2:11:57.280 --> 2:11:59.960]  wanted this problem to become public because many people still don't know
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:04.080]  the risk I've talked to World War two well they're dead now and I read reports
[2:12:04.080 --> 2:12:07.280]  about it but I've talked a lot of radio operators World War two into Korea and
[2:12:07.280 --> 2:12:11.360]  after that they said yeah get back from them they'd have high-powered radars and
[2:12:11.360 --> 2:12:18.320]  they would set cans of food and stuff in front of them to heat it up and and
[2:12:18.320 --> 2:12:21.800]  in different my later I was talking to one guy who was doing microwave stuff
[2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:26.360]  from I think it was like Libya or something in the in the 60s who was in
[2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:29.440]  the army right before Gaddafi came in I don't think he was telling me the whole
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:34.040]  story no no he was in Libya then he was in Ethiopia and then they were picking up
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:37.720]  Russian chatter and doing this NSA thing we're gonna get him in here sometimes I
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:40.560]  think he said I can tell the story he's a local realtor friend of mine he's
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:44.240]  friends with one of the IT guys to have known him for like 10 years to side
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:47.800]  issue the point is he was talking about was it microwave or radar they were
[2:12:47.800 --> 2:12:51.760]  using to heat up their food up on this freezing mountain you think of Ethiopia
[2:12:51.760 --> 2:12:55.040]  as hot but it was cold up on the mountaintops and they were like you
[2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.080]  know it might not be a good idea that we're you know even close to this if
[2:12:59.080 --> 2:13:03.320]  it's heating up the food I mean you know radio engineers will tell you at those
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:06.320]  transmitter sites don't get up against the transmitter that's why they got the
[2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:10.280]  transmitter site somewhere else and the old days they'd have it right on top the
[2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:14.800]  building well you don't want to be you don't want to be you know renting out
[2:13:14.800 --> 2:13:17.840]  that apartment right underneath there because the good news about this
[2:13:17.840 --> 2:13:22.280]  frequency pollution is according to the engineers again I don't know much about
[2:13:22.280 --> 2:13:25.840]  computers I don't know much about radio waves I read the studies I talked to the
[2:13:25.840 --> 2:13:32.880]  engineers and I just give it to you in a layman's term but what I try to do
[2:13:32.880 --> 2:13:37.200]  is is is you just get the basics and it's this with most forms of
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:42.200]  transmission whatever the antenna link this it cuts its power that's hitting you
[2:13:42.200 --> 2:13:47.480]  with by half every length of the antenna so if there's a cell tower a mile away
[2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:50.800]  you're not getting that much from it but let me tell you if you live right
[2:13:50.800 --> 2:13:54.600]  underneath it oh baby you're getting hurt or if you've got one of these little
[2:13:54.600 --> 2:13:58.240]  cell phones crammed right up against the side of your head while it's sitting
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:07.960]  there transmitting but there is so much to go on here let me just read these
[2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:14.080]  interesting little points here that are going on
[2:14:16.080 --> 2:14:19.840]  Billy Corrigan again wants me to just mention everybody that's smashing
[2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:24.800]  pumpkins founder hey Alex Billy Corrigan I'm at St. Louis and TSA is doing
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:30.160]  random pat-downs as people are getting on plane five agents just pulling people
[2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:34.960]  out of line full-body searches the people looking total shock agents are
[2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:41.280]  stationed our stone faith looking at everybody suspiciously it's awful I said
[2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:45.160]  do you want to come on for five minutes or when you get off next stop and he says
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:50.360]  I don't mind you mentioning it show in Chinatown tonight or Chi town I guess
[2:14:50.360 --> 2:14:59.880]  that Chicago is what they call Chicago yeah anyways so there you go good thing
[2:14:59.880 --> 2:15:06.200]  he doesn't mind me mentioning it ah boy I tell you what I where is Max Kaiser you
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:13.960]  guys give me an update he matches never never not shown up for us so was it all
[2:15:13.960 --> 2:15:19.160]  nailed down for him to be on the show yeah this would be kind of an explosive
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:22.640]  interview today with me as dingy as I am and goofy and then mixing that back
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:26.280]  right before we were trying to get Kaiser on John bounds like oh man this
[2:15:26.280 --> 2:15:31.120]  will go crazy today man this may go crazy today what do you mean he goes
[2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:37.920]  where is my Max Kaiser that's not very nice see I hope he's all right he might
[2:15:37.920 --> 2:15:44.880]  be sick or something to you never know yeah his Skype may be blocked it says
[2:15:44.880 --> 2:15:50.200]  busy hmm well whatever I got a bunch of other news I'm gonna get to to Spain
[2:15:50.200 --> 2:15:54.720]  seeks outlaw filming cops weeks after a footage showed police beating
[2:15:54.720 --> 2:15:58.680]  demonstrators I want a fundamental right to film police and all over the US
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:02.520]  well it's 14 states now they're arresting and prosecuting people sometimes
[2:16:02.520 --> 2:16:05.880]  that the cops come and the people have a camera on their house and they're
[2:16:05.880 --> 2:16:10.520]  resting I'm calling it wiretapping when it's a public camera but it's not
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:14.680]  illegal to film Hulk Hogan unknowingly in his bed with a woman I mean of course
[2:16:14.680 --> 2:16:19.920]  that's totally illegal and it's just crazy and I've had cops in Texas come
[2:16:19.920 --> 2:16:23.560]  up say turn your camera off and I'm like no I'm not going to you're interfering
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:28.080]  with us like you're a hundred yards away your checkpoint oh come on man don't
[2:16:28.080 --> 2:16:31.480]  destroy America you really want your kids growing up in a country where you
[2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:36.360]  can't you're threatening my family I go to see no now you're gonna frame me yeah
[2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:39.240]  I mean I've actually had that happen it's like come on stop acting like that
[2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:43.240]  you ought to be embarrassed and the problem is they don't want good cops
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:46.360]  anymore most places they've got some I'm small towns and middle-sized cities
[2:16:46.360 --> 2:16:50.720]  that have great police forces very professional really serve the community
[2:16:50.720 --> 2:16:55.760]  but that's the exception now the norm is kind of a bunch of thugs with with good
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:16:59.240]  cops and the thugs are kind of taken over that's that's them the transition
[2:16:59.240 --> 2:17:04.040]  and then a bunch of cities are scary I mean it's scary because the cops are on
[2:17:04.040 --> 2:17:07.480]  power trips they look craved and they will they want to scare you and it's
[2:17:07.480 --> 2:17:11.280]  like it doesn't I say it's scary it scares me for the country but it just gets
[2:17:11.280 --> 2:17:15.640]  me into a very aggressive mode you know I mean you know I'm the type of guy where
[2:17:15.640 --> 2:17:18.840]  I'm walking down some little green belt path and a couple guys come walking by
[2:17:18.840 --> 2:17:22.080]  thinking they're tough or whatever and I act friendly and I'm just like but my
[2:17:22.080 --> 2:17:25.240]  subconscious mind you know it's like saying boy hope they start something
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:28.040]  because I'll grab and bash their brains out they think they're tough you know
[2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:30.800]  that you know it's kind of like that thing and I'm not looking for trouble but
[2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:34.800]  you know what once it starts you know it's like I'm a big monkey I'm a big
[2:17:34.800 --> 2:17:38.400]  ape you know killer ape here I mean I'm literally saying I'm a killer ape folks
[2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:41.760]  not getting into some discussion about you know the origins of man my point is
[2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:45.320]  is that there's a lot of other mean people out there I'm not saying I'm
[2:17:45.320 --> 2:17:50.800]  tough the point is I'm you know I'm a man and you know what once the once the
[2:17:50.800 --> 2:17:54.800]  once the fist starts swinging I'm not afraid in fact I'm snorting and biting
[2:17:54.800 --> 2:17:58.720]  and snapping and kicking and it's not elbowing and you know and head button
[2:17:58.720 --> 2:18:03.680]  and drooling and you know and and and it's it's not pretty and I don't know
[2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:07.600]  why I'm telling you the point is I just I just can't be around it anymore I
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:12.040]  just cannot be around thugs who want a rigged game where they are quote
[2:18:12.040 --> 2:18:15.200]  paramilitary and then we're the enemy because that's what it is to have
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:19.200]  military operations domestically and police that are basically militarized
[2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:23.480]  that's what it is is that they're here to kill people and break things once you
[2:18:23.480 --> 2:18:26.320]  have military as police that's why you have laws against that which they've
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:31.120]  now completely overthrown and so I see gang members scum thugs whether they're
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:34.800]  in uniforms whether they're gangbangers whatever they are if you are a gang of
[2:18:34.800 --> 2:18:38.160]  people because I'm the sweetest guy in the world but if you're a gang of
[2:18:38.160 --> 2:18:43.080]  aggressive people I have instincts and my instincts are you know I start going

[2:22:20.840 --> 2:22:24.560]  the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:29.120]  lose value or that your retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you and

[2:24:31.680 --> 2:24:35.800]  through to him but it's got bad audio so we're gonna get him on landline I'll
[2:24:35.800 --> 2:24:39.760]  be with us in the next segment we will take calls while Max Kaiser's on getting
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:44.880]  into now the admissions in mainstream media so now it's reality you know if
[2:24:44.880 --> 2:24:48.760]  they didn't say the ocean was blue at high noon that it wouldn't be blue but
[2:24:48.760 --> 2:24:51.520]  they said it was blue than it would be blue because you know they run things
[2:24:51.520 --> 2:24:55.640]  they're now saying it's a global depression so we'll get what us to Max
[2:24:55.640 --> 2:25:00.000]  Kaiser's take on that I don't want to your favorite guess one of my favorite so
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.440]  that's coming up let's go to Dean who wanted to talk to back there at the
[2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:09.800]  McNerrick's gone now and so you're talking to me and I'm gonna fill up and
[2:25:09.800 --> 2:25:13.520]  nay and Jim and Josh and Kebler and everybody else Dean you're on the air
[2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:19.920]  go ahead and a couple things that have happened to me recently first I would
[2:25:19.920 --> 2:25:25.920]  like to say to everybody be a Paul Revere junior by a couple memberships to
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:32.840]  prison planet by 2030 40 in full war magazines hand them out to everybody you
[2:25:32.840 --> 2:25:38.000]  know leave them in doctors offices I went with my family down to West Palm
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:42.680]  Beach two weeks ago I was carrying my info wars I carry about three to six of
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:48.320]  them and on the outside of that I carry my none dare call to conspiracy I make
[2:25:48.320 --> 2:25:54.600]  it obvious so I get info warriors coming up to me however I had TSA follow me
[2:25:54.600 --> 2:26:00.280]  into the restroom one of them then when I came out to meet my family there were
[2:26:00.280 --> 2:26:07.680]  three more walking with him telling me so I was in an airport or or I mean
[2:26:07.680 --> 2:26:11.800]  they're now on the streets I know where was this this isn't the airport after
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:16.160]  security this is going to the gate oh yeah we've had TSA now climb up in cars
[2:26:16.160 --> 2:26:19.200]  you know they hear my radio show now at the checkpoints I mean they are
[2:26:19.200 --> 2:26:24.240]  political officers well which obviously hate freedom so I tell us what happened
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:31.280]  well I said all right let me see if this is true I wore off to the right into a
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:37.880]  gift shop they tailed me yeah they're gang members my family no I left and
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:41.760]  started going towards my gate they stood there like zombies I went up to them I
[2:26:41.760 --> 2:26:46.520]  said all right let's go we're going to the gate and they had like express them
[2:26:46.520 --> 2:26:49.920]  expression list looks on their face well yeah because you're supposed to get real
[2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:54.240]  scared and not turn around and face them but they were they were looking at my
[2:26:54.240 --> 2:26:59.000]  info wars they were looking at my none dare call it a conspiracy book and I do
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:04.040]  recommend for anybody buy two three four memberships and give them out to your
[2:27:04.040 --> 2:27:08.040]  friends because you can get up to six people logged in to each membership it's
[2:27:08.040 --> 2:27:13.200]  well worth the waking day I want to be clear we charge for this magazine call
[2:27:13.200 --> 2:27:17.880]  I'm gonna be honest work I could charge more and actually make money but but I
[2:27:17.880 --> 2:27:22.240]  mean right now we're just making it right at profitable so we have a model for
[2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:24.960]  people that want to put them out themselves you know franchising them and
[2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:28.600]  and people that franchise will be able to charge more because we're I for all
[2:27:28.600 --> 2:27:34.480]  not communist but I have this right at break even because I want to be able to
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:38.200]  get as many of them out I mean that's what I'm into I mean I really get off on
[2:27:38.200 --> 2:27:42.520]  putting 50,000 of these on the streets of Austin I put another 20,000 out we
[2:27:42.520 --> 2:27:45.320]  really did like a hundred and twenty thousand advertisers paid for a hundred
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:49.600]  thousand I did a hundred twenty thousand I just can't control myself and I put
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:54.040]  them all up and down I 35 from Round Rock to San Antonio at most the gas
[2:27:54.040 --> 2:27:58.160]  stations and I just can't help it I'm gonna put it in the hill country you
[2:27:58.160 --> 2:28:02.200]  know why cuz I love my beloved Texas and you know what I'm just gonna put
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:05.560]  these out and and the sponsors are coming through to be able to have us
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:12.360]  break even because it's a thrill to know 70,000 glossy magazines it's now in
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:16.800]  gloss are out there covering the New World Order their quotes how they want to
[2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:21.400]  kill us their admissions and and and people are handing these passing these
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:24.760]  on these are having a huge effect as everybody else gets out of print we go
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:28.920]  into it that's my instinct it's proving right I only go with my gut you know good
[2:28:28.920 --> 2:28:32.720]  Lord above discernment whatever you want to call it and and absolutely folks
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:37.360]  buy them in 10 packs up to 100 packs at cost and just give them to people in fact
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:40.960]  I just had an idea we should have a subscription that monthly charges where
[2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:44.760]  people say get a 10 pack cent on top of you know the subscription where you get
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:49.760]  one cent and again down the road it's gonna become more profitable because
[2:28:49.760 --> 2:28:52.680]  that's the model we need to sustain ourselves but I just wanted this to
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:56.440]  really flood things and it's starting to happen but I mean again we've got to
[2:28:56.440 --> 2:28:59.760]  get the bureaucracy going here in my office to be able to get it all done
[2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:04.000]  with all these franchisees that want to pick it up and print it in their area but
[2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:07.760]  also again put half their local content and really have an effect there's a lot
[2:29:07.760 --> 2:29:10.120]  of legal issues with that and things because you know then if they say
[2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:13.080]  something that we can't prove it has to be their own standalone and they're
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:16.160]  liable and things so there's a lot of things you know that we're working on
[2:29:16.160 --> 2:29:19.840]  but yeah it's it's very very exciting and people need to know we're a hundred
[2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:23.520]  and ten percent folks when you donate to us or buy books and videos at info

[2:31:00.200 --> 2:31:04.840]  The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[2:31:04.840 --> 2:31:09.160]  the hottest half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[2:31:09.160 --> 2:31:13.440]  conditions. Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all
[2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:17.720]  impacted, raising prices. The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and
[2:31:17.720 --> 2:31:21.240]  ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices. The only strategy to

[2:33:25.520 --> 2:33:34.680]  the highway patrol. There's some by Jenny Brown. I'll take your blood at a
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:39.480]  checkpoint and beat your wife. Alright I'm sorry I'm gonna stop right there.

[2:34:15.120 --> 2:34:20.080]  deprived and had too much caffeine. Max Kaiser is finally with us as
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:24.120]  Skypes from up and down. Hopefully they'll be able to be there MaxKaiser.com.
[2:34:24.120 --> 2:34:28.280]  Real fast, Dean finish your point. What did the TSA do when you finally turned
[2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:32.680]  around and said I know you're following me? The TSA said nothing and I think what
[2:34:32.680 --> 2:34:35.960]  they're looking for is for me distributing information to anybody
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:40.800]  because I had a handful of the Info Wars magazine and I had my book there.
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:47.120]  Oh American scum trying to communicate and pass messages in the prison. You
[2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:52.520]  wanted to pass messages in a supermax? The warden doesn't put up with that scum.
[2:34:52.520 --> 2:34:58.240]  They weren't too friendly. But that way. So anyways getting back to you. You were
[2:34:58.240 --> 2:35:02.400]  saying you train people. Yeah for 30 years I've been a personal trainer. In my
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:05.920]  20s I won a heavyweight kickboxing championship. I won the Toughman contest.
[2:35:05.920 --> 2:35:10.880]  Developed asthma. Became fat and asthmatic. Then turned 40 and started competitive body
[2:35:10.880 --> 2:35:15.120]  building. Won the AAU Masters. Mr. America competed 20 times. Won the World
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:19.440]  Championship. Had many many clients getting them in better shape. Whether you
[2:35:19.440 --> 2:35:25.040]  be 10 or 90. Soon as Obama took office and weeks after that, months after that, I
[2:35:25.040 --> 2:35:29.440]  started losing clients. A lot of clients because they didn't want to hear what I
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:33.840]  had to talk about with the worldly events of what's going on. And it's tough
[2:35:33.840 --> 2:35:37.720]  to separate them Alex. I don't know about you but you're we're passionate. I'm
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:42.400]  passionate about saving our country. About waking people up. And I think it
[2:35:42.400 --> 2:35:47.400]  cost me my career. Well look we're gonna lose everything if we don't wake people
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:53.160]  up. But I want to look you up Dean. What's your name? I'm under fatbusters.net.

[2:36:09.160 --> 2:36:13.160]  now and get focused because if he's serious he's an incredible interview. If I
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:16.960]  joke around well he's worse than I am and well you know what ends up happening.
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:23.080]  It sounds like a morning zoo. Max Kaiser of MaxKaiser.com joins us and he's here.
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:26.800]  We're gonna take calls as well. Max I gotta say it every time you're on every
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:30.440]  few weeks and your gracious to come on with us. I know you're over there in
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:34.360]  England. It's late. My friend, I mean the Stiglitz announces depression in
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:39.480]  Europe. It's all banker occupation. The Iran situations heating up. What is the
[2:36:39.480 --> 2:36:43.840]  latest Max Kaiser on the announcements of the euro going under one mega bank and
[2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:48.480]  the Rothschilds and Rockefellers merging at the Financial Times of London's
[2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:52.880]  reporting on what is the latest Max Kaiser inventor of the Hollywood virtual
[2:36:52.880 --> 2:36:58.640]  stock exchange system. Retired top broker and all around TV and radio host. Max
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:05.120]  Kaiser what is the latest? Hey I'm straight to be back with you. Yes what's
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:11.960]  happening you know we're here in London because London is about to experience a
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:19.640]  pretty sharp collapse that's gonna follow Greece and follow Spain. It's gonna
[2:37:19.640 --> 2:37:26.080]  come to London. The Prime Minister David Cameron he he's picked a fight with the
[2:37:26.080 --> 2:37:31.160]  European Union the European Commission and the European Commission the ECB
[2:37:31.160 --> 2:37:36.160]  which includes of course Germany France primarily and they operate out of
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:41.880]  Brussels. They don't want Britain Cameron keeps saying that you know we don't
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:47.640]  agree with your bank reforms but the fact is that Britain's Germany's playing a
[2:37:47.640 --> 2:37:52.800]  masterful game here because they're trying to kick Britain out of the euro
[2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:58.080]  zone completely because they want the Frankfurt in Germany to be the major
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:04.320]  banking center in Europe to supplant London as being the major banking
[2:38:04.320 --> 2:38:08.520]  center and the banking center in London has come under incredible attack for
[2:38:08.520 --> 2:38:13.280]  fraud the Barclays live war rigging scandal Royal Bank of Scotland and
[2:38:13.280 --> 2:38:20.240]  Lloyd's Bank and all the major banks here are now embroiled in major scandals
[2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:24.080]  and David Cameron the Prime Minister keeps talking about he wants to defend
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:28.360]  the banks from regulators but meanwhile the people in Europe are saying it's so
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:32.840]  toxic in London it's such a train wreck in London it's such a regulatory
[2:38:32.840 --> 2:38:37.040]  cesspit we don't want anything to do with London so they're gonna do everything
[2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:41.800]  going forward in euros the British PM is gonna be an isolated currency Britain
[2:38:41.800 --> 2:38:46.640]  is gonna be more and more isolated and nobody here really understands that so
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:50.720]  we're here remove the show from Paris to London because we want to document over
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:57.360]  the next 12 to 24 months the collapse of Britain into a Greece style social
[2:38:57.360 --> 2:39:04.560]  chaos so that's your prediction what do you say on your prognosis for the total
[2:39:04.560 --> 2:39:07.960]  collapse that you believe will start being triggered in April and again
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:13.440]  quantifying it simply what a total collapse is right the I've been sticking
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:18.880]  to my prediction of total currency collapsed by April anytime between now
[2:39:18.880 --> 2:39:24.200]  and April and I haven't changed my thoughts on that the situation as you
[2:39:24.200 --> 2:39:27.920]  pointed out at the top continues to deteriorate in terms of people
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:32.920]  recognizing that there is more of a depression going on around the world in
[2:39:32.920 --> 2:39:37.040]  in the US you have something very deceptive at the moment in that real
[2:39:37.040 --> 2:39:41.680]  estate prices are up let's say over the past two quarters but if you look at what
[2:39:41.680 --> 2:39:45.520]  that's all about you find that the hedge fund community the fast money
[2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:50.320]  community is showing up in Phoenix in Florida Detroit they're throwing money
[2:39:50.320 --> 2:39:55.440]  at these properties as flippers but to make a quick buck but there is a very
[2:39:55.440 --> 2:40:01.240]  concentrated in a very small number of funds but there is no wide-scale housing
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:05.600]  recovery as such so that number is little micro bubbles here and there
[2:40:05.600 --> 2:40:10.120]  exactly great way to put it it's a micro bubble if you look at the stock market
[2:40:10.120 --> 2:40:14.080]  today we're seeing something interesting Alex in that the stock market is
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:19.840]  losing you know to use a Wall Street term it's losing its leadership so
[2:40:19.840 --> 2:40:25.600]  Intel Microsoft McDonald's and General Electric these are big companies big
[2:40:25.600 --> 2:40:30.440]  capitalized companies they're all trading down Google yesterday of course came in
[2:40:30.440 --> 2:40:35.080]  with bad earnings the stock dropped 10% in five minutes right on the opening you
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:40.480]  also have Apple computer now is trading down 60 or 70 dollars from its all-time
[2:40:40.480 --> 2:40:44.720]  high and it looks like Apple computer is going to go through a period of trading
[2:40:44.720 --> 2:40:48.200]  down now it's very significant when you're talking about Apple computer
[2:40:48.200 --> 2:40:51.880]  because you're talking about the biggest company in the world by market cap over
[2:40:51.880 --> 2:40:56.480]  600 billion dollars it's by far the biggest component of the NASDAQ which is
[2:40:56.480 --> 2:41:00.800]  that huge part of the market in the United States that has the fast growers
[2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:05.360]  that some yeah that's Bernie Madoff's creation very loving Bernie Madoff was
[2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:09.880]  one of the art was one of the chairman at some point of NASDAQ and he was
[2:41:09.880 --> 2:41:13.840]  involved that's what his platform where he committed a lot of the fraud that he
[2:41:13.840 --> 2:41:17.600]  did commit but even before Bernie was there and now after Bernie was there
[2:41:17.600 --> 2:41:22.000]  it's the place where technology companies like Google Apple Amazon and these
[2:41:22.000 --> 2:41:25.480]  others go public as to whether traded what's going on with Facebook what are
[2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:33.000]  these these sell-offs of things like Apple what does that foretell well the
[2:41:33.000 --> 2:41:37.520]  Facebook is aligned with the company more I would say if you look at a company
[2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:42.640]  I've mentioned on this show before Zynga the virtual currency and virtual
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:47.800]  property company Zynga announced horrible earnings and is crashing down it's down
[2:41:47.800 --> 2:41:52.520]  something like 80 or 90 percent from its IPO which was only six months ago so
[2:41:52.520 --> 2:41:57.400]  that impacts very negatively on Facebook Facebook has yet to really come up
[2:41:57.400 --> 2:42:01.400]  with a business plan that would indicate that they're going to make some
[2:42:01.400 --> 2:42:06.400]  significant money going forward so that's that's down in the teens again
[2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:11.080]  when public at 38 is down below 20 it got to as low as 17 and a half there's
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:16.240]  been a report by Janet Tabacoli recently very respected Chicago based money
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:20.840]  manager and analysts who thinks Facebook is going to trade down to five dollars
[2:42:20.840 --> 2:42:25.640]  a share so that would be more than a 90% drop from its initial public offering so
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:29.000]  that's also very negative for these markets because nothing can go public
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:33.440]  you got the big cap stocks are trading down today of course at the 25th
[2:42:33.440 --> 2:42:38.000]  anniversary of the crash of 1987 which I was there I was participated in that
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:42.600]  crash I was working in New York I know it very well I said to Chris you're one
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:46.320]  of your producers of video when I was on CBS News being interviewed after the
[2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:50.960]  crash of 87 you see Max Kaiser's a 27-year-old stock broker it's kind of amusing I
[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:54.920]  tell you what I want to find that video Chris the main producers out because he
[2:42:54.920 --> 2:42:58.760]  went like you know 20 hours that went home and he's coming back tomorrow as
[2:42:58.760 --> 2:43:01.720]  we're going to 11 a.m. tomorrow the 48-hour transmission but let me just
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:04.440]  ask you the name of the video and we'll pull it up what's the name it's called
[2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:10.840]  Max Kaiser crash of 1987 mice my bit comes in at around two minutes and 20
[2:43:10.840 --> 2:43:19.360]  seconds okay Max Kaiser the crash of 87 on YouTube that'll get it yeah it's a
[2:43:19.360 --> 2:43:23.840]  fun piece it goes back 25 years and when I was working as a stockbroker in
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:29.400]  New York during the crash but a great story came out today from Pimko you
[2:43:29.400 --> 2:43:34.200]  know Pimko is the biggest bond manager in the world Bill Grosses manages hundreds
[2:43:34.200 --> 2:43:38.560]  of billions of dollars he made a comparison between now in 1987 with
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:42.480]  something called portfolio insurance and I know this very very well from my days
[2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:46.240]  on Wall Street people with large stock market accounts you saw them what's
[2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:50.200]  called portfolio insurance you give them the illusion that they only have two or
[2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:55.160]  three percent risk in their portfolio by trading options but of course when you
[2:43:55.160 --> 2:43:59.800]  have so many people doing the exact same trade over billions and hundreds of
[2:43:59.800 --> 2:44:03.600]  billions of dollars worth of stocks you end up with a huge concentration that
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:09.240]  eventually blows up as it did in 1987 now what we have today in the year 2012 is
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:13.600]  we have this similar contraption to portfolio insurance is called derivatives
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:18.400]  and people believe that these derivative contracts are giving them protection on
[2:44:18.400 --> 2:44:23.280]  the downside that they can buy these huge positions and if they hedge their
[2:44:23.280 --> 2:44:27.840]  positions using derivatives that their risk is manageable and quantifiable and
[2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:31.840]  what I can tell you right now and this is plays into my thesis of between now and
[2:44:31.840 --> 2:44:37.240]  April global currency collapse is that once again we will discover that that is
[2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:43.320]  impossible to ensure everyone's portfolio equally that's an impossibility and yet
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:47.560]  they sell it as it is as it's a possibility and we're going to see once
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:53.800]  again a crash except it'll be 1987 but 20 or 30 times bigger and it'll be this
[2:44:53.800 --> 2:44:58.200]  time of currency crash and it's in the point it's baked into the cake it's in
[2:44:58.200 --> 2:45:01.400]  the pipe but the thing that'll fix it will be having checkpoints on the
[2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:05.640]  highways and TSA groping our families and funding al-Qaeda to attack nations
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:09.240]  and then they'll have a fake patsy who they give a visa to and bring into the
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:12.760]  country try to blow up the Federal Reserve the poor little sweet Federal
[2:45:12.760 --> 2:45:17.240]  Reserve they would never stage a false flag patsy event I mean this is just
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:21.640]  Max Kaiser we should be thanking the bankers for what they're doing America
[2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:27.360]  is having a nervous breakdown the TSA events and these fake presidential
[2:45:27.360 --> 2:45:32.960]  debates are something you would see in a mental ward suffering from the deep
[2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:39.880]  dementia and psychotropic dementia and other mental illnesses I agree all right
[2:45:39.880 --> 2:45:43.680]  so have you ever watched a crazy person say a homeless person it's very sad but
[2:45:43.680 --> 2:45:46.320]  you sit there maybe in a cafe watching them out the window and you start
[2:45:46.320 --> 2:45:50.720]  feeling crazy watching the craziness I mean oh don't look in the abyss unless
[2:45:50.720 --> 2:45:55.160]  you become the abyss I mean this is really getting nuts Kaiser well it's a
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:46:00.640]  combination of a mental asylum and a cult because you also have a cult like
[2:46:00.640 --> 2:46:05.840]  qualities when you have but make Mitt Romney he's not a psychotic so much as
[2:46:05.840 --> 2:46:11.120]  a cult leader he's like Jim Jones in the cult of Guyana where he got everyone to
[2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:16.480]  drink the the the Kool-Aid laced with cyanide and that's what private equity
[2:46:16.480 --> 2:46:19.880]  is about that's where he comes from the world of private equity where he he
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:24.440]  hypnotizes people into believing that by stripping corporations of all their
[2:46:24.440 --> 2:46:28.760]  assets and selling them off and firing everybody that somehow that's good for
[2:46:28.760 --> 2:46:33.000]  the for the for the economy and good for America that's like burning down your
[2:46:33.000 --> 2:46:37.320]  house and saying I had to do it because nothing else could have saved the house
[2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:41.320]  so I burned it down or America and member in Vietnam they had to destroy the
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:44.800]  village to save the village you know Mitt Romney's attitude is we've got to
[2:46:44.800 --> 2:46:48.120]  burn down these corporations strip them of all their assets using private
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:53.280]  equity to save them and he wants to take that cult like mentality and apply it to
[2:46:53.280 --> 2:46:57.840]  America he wants to do a leverage buyout of America sell all the assets he
[2:46:57.840 --> 2:47:01.680]  possibly can to private bankers save the difference for himself so is that
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:06.320]  worth goes and have us pay taxes to give him banker bailouts I mean that's
[2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:11.440]  important is that's free market well those aside show that the point is that
[2:47:11.440 --> 2:47:16.960]  Mitt Romney looks at other oligarchs around the world and he wants to be a
[2:47:16.960 --> 2:47:22.640]  10 to 15 billion dollar player as well he is jealous of the 15 to 20 billion
[2:47:22.640 --> 2:47:26.520]  dollar players he's got less than a billion dollars so in his mind he's a
[2:47:26.520 --> 2:47:30.480]  shrimp dick as we used to say on Wall Street so he's got to really step up his
[2:47:30.480 --> 2:47:35.520]  game so he's figured out that if he does a leverage buyout of America he can make
[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:39.960]  himself 10 or 15 billion dollars which he could if he pulls it off on the other
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:44.720]  side of the aisle Barack Obama yeah somebody mentioned on your show earlier
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:50.000]  I think it was Gerald Solente that the Obama deception was a fantastic film and
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.760]  I I've said that for the last seven whatever four years I guess that the
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:59.840]  Obama deception is the best Alex Jones film because it totally predicted what
[2:47:59.840 --> 2:48:04.160]  happened I myself was taken in by Obama when he was running for president I gave
[2:48:04.160 --> 2:48:09.360]  him the benefit of the doubt like an idiot your film cut through all that and
[2:48:09.360 --> 2:48:15.280]  it's been completely true he's he is an absolute a nothing but a puppet empty
[2:48:15.280 --> 2:48:22.960]  suit he reneged on every single promise except one he did buy his kids a dog well
[2:48:22.960 --> 2:48:26.840]  he's organic but doesn't want us to you know I watch Obama he looks very
[2:48:26.840 --> 2:48:32.000]  unhealthy now what is it that happens to presidents where they go gray and they
[2:48:32.000 --> 2:48:36.280]  age 20 years in four years well what happens do they you know maybe have their
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:40.320]  own body scanner there are aliens in the basement they replace their brain I mean
[2:48:40.320 --> 2:48:44.840]  well I mean I mean what's going on here I have no doubt that being president of
[2:48:44.840 --> 2:48:50.520]  the United States is a stressful job and since you have to be on on call 24 hours
[2:48:50.520 --> 2:48:55.560]  a day I'm pretty sure that the president is on drugs 24 hours a day and that is
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:49:00.920]  his entire schedule is medicated so that he is ready to make a decision because
[2:49:00.920 --> 2:49:05.120]  at any given moment something might happen and he needs to make a decision on
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:10.000]  and we saw that with George Bush I think George Bush his reputation for being
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:17.120]  quote-unquote dumb was overplayed I think in his case he was less able to handle
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:21.320]  the demands of being probably when he was governor he had brown hair he gave
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:24.520]  pretty good speeches without teleprompters and within about a year in
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:30.080]  office he was a gibbering lobotomy patient those are the drugs that they
[2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:34.560]  have to keep you alert to make these decisions and once you enter the
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:38.440]  presidential bubble you completely lose track with what's happening no that's
[2:49:38.440 --> 2:49:42.280]  just like the ancient Chinese bounding people's women you know bounding women's
[2:49:42.280 --> 2:49:47.480]  feet not letting them walk I think that the whole cloistered inner cult like JFK
[2:49:47.480 --> 2:49:51.760]  injecting with methamphetamine exactly it's well known they absolutely it's
[2:49:51.760 --> 2:49:55.600]  your responsibility up at 5 a.m. we have to have this briefing don't worry sir the
[2:49:55.600 --> 2:49:58.760]  Air Force takes these pills or take them immediately and then those pills make
[2:49:58.760 --> 2:50:02.000]  it horrible don't worry sir we have an injection for you and it's kind of this
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:05.760]  medical tyranny that's taken over the rest of the West it really takes over
[2:50:05.760 --> 2:50:10.740]  the president I really wish in America you had the possibility of a genuine
[2:50:10.740 --> 2:50:16.080]  grassroots campaign like a teddy Roosevelt or somebody who comes up from
[2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:22.680]  who really communicates and then becomes elected based on a philosophy and an
[2:50:22.680 --> 2:50:28.800]  ideology and and conviction that they believe in but in America today anyone
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:34.040]  who comes along like Iran Paul or even a Ralph Nader who I think had a lot of
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:38.680]  good qualities you know they get decapitated by the media who is of
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:43.320]  course sponsoring the ads they sponsor I hear you max stay there we found that
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:47.600]  two-and-a-half minute clip with Dan rather talking about you I come in at two
[2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:50.760]  minutes and yeah we're gonna play the whole thing because it shows these
[2:50:50.760 --> 2:50:55.320]  stockbrokers acting like five-year-old kids with like six cigars in their mouth
[2:50:55.320 --> 2:50:59.680]  and stuff this is who runs things now a bunch of guys trying to show off to each
[2:50:59.680 --> 2:51:04.560]  other the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of
[2:51:04.560 --> 2:51:09.280]  2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is
[2:51:09.280 --> 2:51:13.560]  in drought conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:18.040]  are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:21.760]  and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to
[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:25.840]  counter this is to freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own
[2:51:25.840 --> 2:51:30.360]  supply of foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases
[2:51:30.360 --> 2:51:34.000]  e-foods will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:37.200]  recently increased my supply from e-foods direct because we have all known

[2:51:44.680 --> 2:51:47.840]  25 years you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food

[2:52:08.840 --> 2:52:13.560]  you already know something big is about to hit the US and you have got to be

[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:29.560]  the people that are in control now disconnected from reality taught eugenics

[2:55:50.520 --> 2:55:54.600]  video feed is at info wars moneybomb.com or info wars.com to continue
[2:55:54.600 --> 2:55:58.440]  watching but here's flashback Max Kaiser discusses the 87s stock market crash
[2:55:58.440 --> 2:56:02.920]  on Dan Rather show here it is. Massacre on Wall Street did a lot more than
[2:56:02.920 --> 2:56:07.800]  shake up political fortunes it taught an entire class a generation that on the
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:12.560]  stock exchange it is no fairytale when the bull turns into a bear. Charles
[2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:17.520]  Osgood reports for the young and upwardly mobile the five-year bull market
[2:56:17.520 --> 2:56:21.680]  brought more success than some of them could handle the music was fast and
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:26.400]  heady and they thought it would never stop but then the other day it did stop
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.280]  at least for a while and there was this sinking feeling this sudden realization
[2:56:30.280 --> 2:56:34.200]  that the stock market was downwardly mobile and so were they. I think we were
[2:56:34.200 --> 2:56:40.400]  living on a blind faith that somehow this would not happen it did happen and
[2:56:40.400 --> 2:56:44.640]  I don't think and the repercussions of it right now is too early to tell just how
[2:56:44.640 --> 2:56:49.480]  it will affect those involved. The upper mentality has been punched maybe knocked
[2:56:49.480 --> 2:56:55.240]  down but the fight is still early I think they're gonna realize having been
[2:56:55.240 --> 2:57:00.840]  punched in this matter that the security that they felt isn't really as solid as
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:05.240]  they believed. These people are VPs they're 28 29 years old they've never
[2:57:05.240 --> 2:57:09.200]  seen a downside of the market they they're not seasoned they've never seen
[2:57:09.200 --> 2:57:13.280]  something like half what happened on Monday. Brokers say older people living
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:16.720]  on their savings and investments were not so badly hurt this time because they
[2:57:16.720 --> 2:57:20.560]  knew they knew it had happened before but of course that was way back in what
[2:57:20.560 --> 2:57:24.360]  to the yuppies is ancient history. There's no way they can handle a real
[2:57:24.360 --> 2:57:29.840]  collapse of the economy comparable to anything that we we had in the 30s because
[2:57:29.840 --> 2:57:35.120]  their lifestyle has been totally different. Well he said it. My generation have not we
[2:57:35.120 --> 2:57:39.960]  didn't live through the depression but I think now saving a penny becomes more
[2:57:39.960 --> 2:57:43.920]  important. Even though the market has come back in the last two sessions the
[2:57:43.920 --> 2:57:48.760]  fast and fancy cars don't seem so irresistible anymore. Count all your chickens
[2:57:48.760 --> 2:57:52.280]  before their heads don't be calling up the Porsche dealership and next day you
[2:57:52.280 --> 2:57:55.640]  have to call up the Ford dealership. Because we had an ad in the paper for a
[2:57:55.640 --> 2:58:00.760]  car and Monday morning we got a ton of calls by Monday afternoon nobody was
[2:58:00.760 --> 2:58:05.240]  calling. I'm like a lot of other people and I have to admit I'd like to live
[2:58:05.240 --> 2:58:09.840]  beyond my means but you know I think twice about making large ticket
[2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:14.400]  purchases now. The plight of the yuppie does not seem tragic to everybody not to
[2:58:14.400 --> 2:58:19.400]  Nobel Prize winning economist Solo. Sweet are the uses of adversity and one of
[2:58:19.400 --> 2:58:24.360]  the things that might do is make engineers out of yuppies. And not to
[2:58:24.360 --> 2:58:30.640]  New York broker Max Kaiser. The idea of a yuppie you know money without stopping
[2:58:30.640 --> 2:58:34.400]  that that's not the case anymore. I personally am glad to see it. I'm sick
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:39.240]  of yuppies. No more yuppie chow. No more yuppie magazines. No more yuppie clubs.
[2:58:39.240 --> 2:58:47.920]  No more yuppies. Thank you Felicia. Cue it up to the beginning of him. Visit GCNLive.com

[3:00:17.520 --> 3:00:22.120]  Engineers out of yuppies. And not to New York broker Max Kaiser. The idea of a
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:27.920]  yuppie you know money without stopping that that's not the case anymore. I'm
[3:00:27.920 --> 3:00:32.600]  personally I'm glad to see it. I'm sick of yuppies. No more yuppie chow. No more
[3:00:32.600 --> 3:00:36.920]  yuppie magazines. No more yuppie clubs. No more yuppies. Great. That's the only
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:40.520]  thing we accomplished of anything. We got rid of the yuppies and I'm happy about
[3:00:40.520 --> 3:00:45.080]  it. For lots of fast-living young people Monday stock market jolt was like a
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:49.240]  sudden heart attack. A heart attack they say is nature's way of telling you to

[3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:16.040]  the 87 crash and boy that foretelling thing of the guy from the
[3:01:16.040 --> 3:01:19.480]  depression saying people wouldn't be able to deal with what we dealt with. Now
[3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:23.600]  things are 20 or 30 times worse like you said. What will it be like if there is a
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:27.200]  total collapse. I mean it'll just be I can't imagine what it will be like with
[3:01:27.200 --> 3:01:31.000]  all these modern super wimps. There aren't even yuppies. They're super
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:37.120]  trendy wimpy wimps. Yeah since the 87 crash there's been wave after wave of
[3:01:37.120 --> 3:01:42.160]  deregulation to make subsequent crashes worse. We have the dot-com crash which was
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:49.680]  worse in 2000. You had the subprime bubble in crash which was huge. Now we're
[3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:53.580]  heading into the mother and father and cousins and uncles. The biggest crash of
[3:01:53.580 --> 3:01:57.840]  all because the brokers on Wall Street and in the city of London believe that
[3:01:57.840 --> 3:02:01.960]  they can technologically hedge themselves against this risk. The exact same thing
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:05.640]  that led to the crash in 87 that you could put on multi-million dollar trades
[3:02:05.640 --> 3:02:09.840]  but be hedged that you knew what the risk was and it was quantifiable. They've
[3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:12.920]  made this mistake every five or six years and the crashes get bigger and
[3:02:12.920 --> 3:02:17.320]  bigger. Now they've done the same thing with the global currency market which is
[3:02:17.320 --> 3:02:21.840]  a four trillion dollar per day market and when this blows up as it will between
[3:02:21.840 --> 3:02:25.960]  now and April then you're talking about global currency collapse and you're
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:31.120]  talking about of course gold and silver trading up to again keep continuing to
[3:02:31.120 --> 3:02:37.080]  trade up at all-time highs against every major paper currency in the world. By
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:42.680]  the way they are having more US envoys and front people killed at embassies
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:47.440]  around the world. Security chief dies in Beirut blast live updates and they're
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:51.600]  saying Assad's behind it. I want to talk something about that proxy war against
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:55.040]  the Syrians and the Russians with Al Qaeda on the side of the West. I mean it's
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:59.280]  just it's very bold to know the media will never point them and they pointed
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:01.960]  out but people don't even know what they're reading. We're gonna be getting to
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:04.360]  that but just briefly because we're gonna come back and take calls Max for a
[3:03:04.360 --> 3:03:08.840]  while. How crazy does it have to get? I mean now Al Qaeda publicly works for the
[3:03:08.840 --> 3:03:13.600]  West? Well I was at the House of Commons yesterday and I had lunch with George
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:19.320]  Galloway who is now back in government here in the UK and we're planning a trip
[3:03:19.320 --> 3:03:24.120]  to Beirut. Remember I talked to you from Beirut once before. We did a few shows
[3:03:24.120 --> 3:03:29.600]  from Beirut, Lebanon and we're planning a trip to go back. Clearly there's a lot
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:33.320]  of action there again and then we want to get a front row seat and do a little
[3:03:33.320 --> 3:03:36.720]  trip over there so hopefully we can do another live show from Beirut to the
[3:03:36.720 --> 3:03:43.880]  Info Wars audience. Absolutely Max. I mean I tell you again I just keep saying
[3:03:43.880 --> 3:03:47.160]  I'm pinching myself because it's all coming true. We've been totally right.
[3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:50.880]  It's getting worse by the minute. It's getting more and more insane and I've
[3:03:50.880 --> 3:03:56.560]  got this feeling we ain't seen nothing yet. Well you know it's all
[3:03:56.560 --> 3:04:03.800]  economic and finance and the progression of the conquest of the economy by
[3:04:03.800 --> 3:04:08.920]  Wall Street in the city of London has continued uninterrupted for 30 years and
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:12.520]  it's gained speed during Clinton. You know he got rid of Glass-Steagall. He
[3:04:12.520 --> 3:04:17.280]  wrote about the the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which made
[3:04:17.280 --> 3:04:21.080]  derivatives trading legal. Before that they were considered gambling and
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:27.080]  illegal and under Clinton and then Obama we've had just more deregulation and
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:32.280]  more escalation of these global fraudsters who have us by the throat.
[3:04:32.280 --> 3:04:37.840]  Remember back in 2008 when Hank Paulson wanted to give his buddies at Goldman
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:42.600]  Sachs a multi-billion dollar bonus he took the senators back the back room and
[3:04:42.600 --> 3:04:45.760]  threatened martial law. The next day they gave him three quarters of a trillion
[3:04:45.760 --> 3:04:49.600]  dollars so they learned that all you need to do is crash the market a bit a
[3:04:49.600 --> 3:04:55.760]  bit of a flash crash to a 1987 style crash. You know natural gas was down 8% in
[3:04:55.760 --> 3:05:01.320]  five minutes. Stay there we're gonna finish up with that and go to calls.
[3:05:01.320 --> 3:05:06.200]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this
[3:05:06.200 --> 3:05:09.760]  country. Going back about a year and a half ago I began to learn about the
[3:05:09.760 --> 3:05:16.000]  incredible health effects of young Jevity products. Aaron Dykes lost 92
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:20.600]  pounds. We're gonna show you some before and afters. Aaron break down what
[3:05:20.600 --> 3:05:24.480]  happened your story. I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to
[3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:28.480]  lose weight but I just didn't get the results it just didn't happen. Then I saw
[3:05:28.480 --> 3:05:32.320]  what you were doing with info wars team.com. I wasn't even trying to lose
[3:05:32.320 --> 3:05:35.400]  weight but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy. I wanted that
[3:05:35.400 --> 3:05:39.160]  nutrition didn't even understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss
[3:05:39.160 --> 3:05:43.620]  goals but the products did that for me. I found myself suddenly losing weight,
[3:05:43.620 --> 3:05:47.880]  more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat the right foods and they
[3:05:47.880 --> 3:05:51.600]  don't even advertise it as weight loss. I want to challenge our radio listeners

[3:07:01.800 --> 3:07:06.520]  love camel milk. Yes, the newest oldest thing in the world, camel milk, has
[3:07:06.520 --> 3:07:10.000]  sustained civilizations for thousands of years. Here's just one user's
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:13.800]  testimonial. My lime-stricken boy developed severe allergies to nearly
[3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:18.600]  every food he had gested. At first I was scared to death to try camel milk, but he
[3:07:18.600 --> 3:07:23.000]  had no allergic reactions of any kind, nothing. The camel milk was wondrous in
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:27.160]  healing his GI issues, and it's the one thing I can attribute to his getting out
[3:07:27.160 --> 3:07:31.800]  of bed after almost a year spent there, too ill to do anything. Camel milk is
[3:07:31.800 --> 3:07:35.920]  loaded with health benefits far superior to other milk, is rich in B vitamins, and
[3:07:35.920 --> 3:07:39.680]  three times higher in vitamin C than cow's milk, ten times higher in iron.
[3:07:39.680 --> 3:07:43.720]  Camel milk comes fresher frozen from your trusted local family farm. Hump back
[3:07:43.720 --> 3:07:50.600]  dairies of Miller, Missouri to order call this number 1-417-848-7570. That's 1-417-
[3:07:50.600 --> 3:08:00.040]  848-7570. Call 1-417-848-7570 for camel milk, the best kept health secret ever.
[3:08:04.720 --> 3:08:11.440]  Behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN
[3:08:11.440 --> 3:08:20.360]  radio network. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:28.400]  Max Kaiser is our guest and we are in the middle of this 48-hour transmission. It
[3:08:28.400 --> 3:08:33.280]  started yesterday at 11 a.m., runs until Saturday at 11 a.m., and if your local
[3:08:33.280 --> 3:08:37.640]  AM and FM, you know, doesn't obviously can't carry the whole 24 hours, you can
[3:08:37.640 --> 3:08:41.560]  all go to infowarsmoneybomb.com and there's free audio and video streams
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:46.880]  there, and the power of you the people, we the people, emailing, Facebooking,
[3:08:46.880 --> 3:08:51.080]  Twittering, sending out that link to everyone and, you know, telling them who's
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:08:55.440]  here. It's Max Kaiser, Gerald Salente, George Norrie. In fact, I have a whole list
[3:08:55.440 --> 3:09:02.120]  here. If you go to the site, you can go to infowarsmoneybomb.com and see who
[3:09:02.120 --> 3:09:05.920]  is coming up. We're going to go to your calls here in just a moment and get more
[3:09:05.920 --> 3:09:11.600]  on the engineer deterioration and also what's happening. Geopolitically, embassies
[3:09:11.600 --> 3:09:17.200]  all over the world and military bases that are pro-globalist are being bombed in
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:20.680]  counter strikes. And I think there may be something, and people are like, well, who
[3:09:20.680 --> 3:09:26.560]  is it? Tarpley says that the Mormon mafia probably killed the ambassador and,
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:34.880]  you know, this and then you had Mr. Haglin on from the Northeast
[3:09:34.880 --> 3:09:38.400]  Intelligence Network and he says it's the Russians. Well, there's a lot of
[3:09:38.400 --> 3:09:41.320]  evidence pointing towards that's why you don't see it in the news. And then
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:45.160]  there's more of these bombings and more head of securities and embassies being
[3:09:45.160 --> 3:09:48.480]  killed. And you notice you're not seeing a big news item out of it. In fact, will you
[3:09:48.480 --> 3:09:55.600]  guys give me that? I just printed and there, thank you. And there is a proxy
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:09:58.680]  war against the Russians. Russian troops are dying. A Russian general has died.
[3:09:58.680 --> 3:10:03.920]  There's Russian Spitznets Army and Marine troops. Spitznets means
[3:10:03.920 --> 3:10:07.320]  special forces. Let me just get to this now and then I promise I'm going to your
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:13.400]  calls. Jim is first and Josh, Jeff, Hill, Billy, Mike and others. But Max, this
[3:10:13.400 --> 3:10:19.200]  whole proxy war that is going on and raging all over the place and this
[3:10:19.200 --> 3:10:22.440]  latest bombing in Lebanon that I'll just put on screen right here. I've
[3:10:22.440 --> 3:10:27.480]  actually just got it here up on my screen. So I can just pull that up for
[3:10:27.480 --> 3:10:34.080]  viewers myself. Where do you see this whole thing going, Max? The craziness
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:40.440]  in Syria? Well, you know, it's, it all goes back to Israeli-Palestine conflict
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:44.280]  and Moscow apparently just came out with a statement saying they're going to get
[3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:47.840]  more active in defending the Palestinians against incursion from the
[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:53.440]  occupying forces of Israel. So that's an interesting development because now
[3:10:53.440 --> 3:11:00.080]  Russia is stepping up into the very hot, hot issue of the Israeli-Palestinian
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:05.960]  conflict. You know, the Palestinians are very few friends, very few people
[3:11:05.960 --> 3:11:09.440]  even in the Muslim world support the Palestinians, certainly not the Sunnis
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:15.360]  over there, Saudi Arabia. They're in bed with the Americans and the British. The
[3:11:15.360 --> 3:11:19.960]  the Shia Muslims, of course, offer some support but they're fighting a war
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:26.720]  against the Troika of Israel, Britain and Israel. So they're in a hot war. So now
[3:11:26.720 --> 3:11:32.160]  Russia is stepping in. So this is very, very interesting. I guess since America
[3:11:32.160 --> 3:11:39.200]  is sending three huge battleships to sit off the coast of Iran, Russia figures,
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:43.840]  you know, why not? We're just going to make a scramble over here and make some
[3:11:43.840 --> 3:11:48.640]  friends in this community where we can secure some additional oil and gas
[3:11:48.640 --> 3:11:54.040]  reserves and let America blow itself up. They allowed America to enter Afghanistan
[3:11:54.040 --> 3:11:58.320]  to get blown up, you know, stuck in the Afghanistaning territories and Russia
[3:11:58.320 --> 3:12:02.680]  knows all about that. They hear America, come on into Afghanistan, get sunk in a
[3:12:02.680 --> 3:12:06.960]  quagmire for 20 years. Now they're going to let them get stuck in this
[3:12:06.960 --> 3:12:12.160]  Iranian conflict. So Russia's playing chess and America's playing checkers.
[3:12:12.160 --> 3:12:16.120]  But it's more than that. The global megabanks won a bankrupt America, wanted
[3:12:16.120 --> 3:12:18.840]  to moralize our military and they're getting hundreds of billions, five
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:22.280]  hundred billion a year conservatively. Even the IMF, it's that of Schmack,
[3:12:22.280 --> 3:12:27.440]  heroin, you know, stuff they mainline to ship it in so our sons and daughters can
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:30.120]  use it and then be put in private prisons owned by megabanks that launder the
[3:12:30.120 --> 3:12:34.320]  drug money and run the aircraft on record. So, I mean, it's all there. So, you know,
[3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:37.760]  we think about it as, oh, America's doing something dumb. Well, no, it's not. America
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:40.800]  is there to be running into the ground like everybody else because these
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:44.680]  bankers are preying on everyone. I mean, isn't that really what's happening in the
[3:12:44.680 --> 3:12:48.760]  final equation? The U.S. has the reserve currency which insulates them as we've
[3:12:48.760 --> 3:12:55.120]  discussed before. That's why I'm saying that the biggest shock collapse of a
[3:12:55.120 --> 3:12:59.720]  country is going to be Britain. That's why I'm here to document the collapse of
[3:12:59.720 --> 3:13:04.960]  Britain into Greece-like anarchy because this economy is getting set to crash
[3:13:04.960 --> 3:13:10.560]  spectacularly. The prime minister is isolating himself from the European
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:16.400]  Union and he's got no friends when he really turns around and relies on Israel
[3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:21.240]  and America as friends. That's a joke. That's like having Genghis Khan and Jack
[3:13:21.240 --> 3:13:24.160]  the Ripper as your friend. So, they're really setting themselves up for a
[3:13:24.160 --> 3:13:28.720]  tremendous collapse here. We want to be front-row and center covered for, you know,
[3:13:28.720 --> 3:13:36.520]  the Kaiser report. Oh, sweet. A bomb hits Beirut. Live updates. London Guardian and
[3:13:36.520 --> 3:13:41.840]  Said Harari, the son of Rafiq Harari, the former prime minister who was
[3:13:41.840 --> 3:13:46.280]  assassinated by a bomb in Beirut. 2005 has accused Syrian president Bashir
[3:13:46.280 --> 3:13:51.600]  Assad of orchestrating the killing today of the head of security there and
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:55.320]  there's more and more of these heads of security getting killed and the word is
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:59.000]  the Ruskies and I think there's something to this. I might say this is what
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:03.560]  people are like, well, which is it? Alex, you said this, you said that. Well, I mean,
[3:14:03.560 --> 3:14:09.320]  we don't know we are trying to figure it out. All these people that know exactly
[3:14:09.320 --> 3:14:13.640]  what it is, you know, and you know, one day into it have all the answers is pure
[3:14:13.640 --> 3:14:17.320]  baloney. We normally learn things in hindsight, which most people don't even
[3:14:17.320 --> 3:14:22.440]  care to know where Syria is or Lebanon is just north of Israel. But this is a
[3:14:22.440 --> 3:14:25.480]  huge proxy war and it's getting crazier by the minute. Let's go to Jim in
[3:14:25.480 --> 3:14:29.120]  Illinois. You're on the year with Max Kaiser. You're a 1530 a.m. listener in
[3:14:29.120 --> 3:14:36.480]  Chicago. WCKG. Go ahead, Jim. Alex and Max, Dynamic Duo. Good to hear your voice.
[3:14:36.480 --> 3:14:41.520]  Quick question for Max. You talked about Alex. We all know in our gut there's
[3:14:41.520 --> 3:14:44.520]  definitely something coming down the pipe. We don't know what and when.
[3:14:44.520 --> 3:14:50.880]  Economically, Max, what do we do to be prepared for this? It's about to come in
[3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:54.480]  quickly. Alex, after he answers, could you shift me back to your studio?
[3:14:54.480 --> 3:14:57.880]  Because studio guys, I'd like to direct them to a website. But that's a question,
[3:14:57.880 --> 3:15:03.320]  Max. What do we do to prepare? Go ahead. I mean, it's nothing that's
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:06.920]  different than what we've been saying for five years, Alex. I mean, do we have to
[3:15:06.920 --> 3:15:10.520]  say the same thing over and over again? The answer to solution.
[3:15:10.520 --> 3:15:15.240]  But, you know, it's obviously in a paper money collapse. Only keep money in the
[3:15:15.240 --> 3:15:22.320]  bank. Only keep money in paper money that you're happy to lose. Okay? That should
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:25.240]  be your guide. If you have money in the bank or you have money in paper money,
[3:15:25.240 --> 3:15:30.240]  dollars or euros, only keep money in paper that you're happy to lose. Because
[3:15:30.240 --> 3:15:33.600]  you're going to lose it. Okay? The only real money going forward is
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:37.080]  gold and silver. So that'll be your money. That's your wealth. If you don't have
[3:15:37.080 --> 3:15:41.000]  any gold and silver, you don't have any money. It's as simple as that. And that's
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:44.920]  that's it. We're going back to the gold and silver as it's been the case for five
[3:15:44.920 --> 3:15:49.240]  thousand years. We've always been on a gold standard. Well, the elites are all
[3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:52.480]  now piling in and buying gold while badmouthing it out of the other side of
[3:15:52.480 --> 3:15:55.760]  their mouth. Of course. Well, that's right. It goes through three stages. First,
[3:15:55.760 --> 3:16:00.480]  nobody wants gold and silver. Then the contrarians start to buy like Ted
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:03.800]  Anderson, you know, back when it was $250, $300 an ounce, he started to buy
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:07.800]  gold and talk about it on your show. Then the second stage is the so-called smart
[3:16:07.800 --> 3:16:11.480]  money. This would be the George Soros. This would be the John Paulson, not to be
[3:16:11.480 --> 3:16:15.200]  confused with Hank Paulson. Other hedge fund managers, even PIMCA, which is a huge
[3:16:15.200 --> 3:16:19.680]  bond manager, they start buying big positions in these metals. The third
[3:16:19.680 --> 3:16:23.920]  stage is when the public enters the market and there's a panic buying
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:29.160]  stampede. That's when you see that manic burst like you saw in the 7980 phase
[3:16:29.160 --> 3:16:33.600]  frame where you saw gold trade at $700, $800 an ounce. But this time we're talking
[3:16:33.600 --> 3:16:40.800]  about gold topping out at $10,000 an ounce. Absolutely. Well said. You're
[3:16:40.800 --> 3:16:43.760]  absolutely right about that. And don't be mean to Jim. We have a lot of new
[3:16:43.760 --> 3:16:46.640]  listeners. That is a new affiliate in just the last few weeks there in
[3:16:46.640 --> 3:16:50.920]  Chicago. They say, what do we do? I mean, they probably have an idea too, Max. They
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:56.840]  just want to hear what you have to say. Okay, great. Well, it's actually a matter
[3:16:56.840 --> 3:17:02.520]  of fact that if you have a banking system that has 800 trillion dollars in
[3:17:02.520 --> 3:17:07.520]  claims, that's the global derivatives market on a total base money supply
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:12.800]  around the world, not even one one hundredth that amount, you're heading for
[3:17:12.800 --> 3:17:18.320]  a rebalancing of gold and silver at $10,000 an ounce and $500 an ounce
[3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:22.160]  respectively. And by the way, on your show the other day, you said I was wrong
[3:17:22.160 --> 3:17:26.400]  about silver trading to $500 an ounce. Let me make this record clear. I
[3:17:26.400 --> 3:17:31.840]  said that before this bull market is over, silver will trade at $500 an
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:36.480]  ounce. This bull market is not over. We have five, six, seven years left on this
[3:17:36.480 --> 3:17:41.920]  market. We will see that $500 an ounce. Well, Max, I was hold on Max. Max, Max, Max, Max.
[3:17:41.920 --> 3:17:46.240]  Okay. Furthermore, furthermore, furthermore, furthermore, furthermore, furthermore,
[3:17:46.240 --> 3:17:50.920]  furthermore. Be quiet. I could just turn him down with this entertaining. Go ahead.
[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:56.320]  Yes, sir. I said if you're a listener to people around the world, we're each to buy
[3:17:56.320 --> 3:18:00.360]  a hundred, a one ounce or two ounces. You need a hundred million people, which is
[3:18:00.360 --> 3:18:04.360]  easily doable around the world. People being victimized by these banking
[3:18:04.360 --> 3:18:09.320]  charlatans. You could get to that $500 an ounce whenever you wanted to get to
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:15.360]  $500 an ounce. It's because of lazy, no good, shiftless people around the world
[3:18:15.360 --> 3:18:20.800]  who complain and don't do anything that we have silver stuck at 34. Go buy
[3:18:20.800 --> 3:18:27.320]  one. Hey, Max, Max, I was, I was not. Put him on hold. Stop it, Max. All right.
[3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:31.760]  Getting back to what I was going to say. Fade you down for just a minute there. I'm
[3:18:31.760 --> 3:18:36.160]  saying, I remember your prediction. You were saying sooner than what's happened
[3:18:36.160 --> 3:18:39.800]  $500 an ounce. And I was saying Max is a smart guy. Most of what he says happened.
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:44.200]  I hope he's wrong about this total collapse by April. And I said, you know,
[3:18:44.200 --> 3:18:47.000]  you haven't been a hundred percent right. And that I don't have a heart attack
[3:18:47.000 --> 3:18:51.200]  over that. Go ahead, Max. I don't think your show is listened to very, very
[3:18:51.200 --> 3:18:57.920]  closely by people on my side. We dissect your show line by line, word by word,
[3:18:57.920 --> 3:19:03.560]  Alex, because we do the work necessary to keep abreast of the global trends. And
[3:19:03.560 --> 3:19:09.160]  we need to know exactly what you're saying. That's what we do. Okay. We, we,
[3:19:09.160 --> 3:19:13.880]  we were tracking you very closely, Alex. I don't know if you're aware of this, but
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:19.520]  you know, we, you can't say a word on the air or tweet a tweet without going
[3:19:19.520 --> 3:19:24.120]  through the direct compilation of data and information that I personally
[3:19:24.120 --> 3:19:32.240]  oversee. Okay, Lord Kaiser, I'm, I'm, I'm, I am being watched. Seriously, though, the
[3:19:32.240 --> 3:19:35.600]  good news is medical discovery. Transfusions of your blood appear to
[3:19:35.600 --> 3:19:39.200]  rejuvenate the elderly. Well, the queen mother was getting blood transfusions
[3:19:39.200 --> 3:19:43.080]  forever. Remember Al Gore has a little refrigerator of blood. Let me tell you
[3:19:43.080 --> 3:19:49.600]  something. Candy corn does the same thing. Alright, let's not degenerate yet. I hope
[3:19:49.600 --> 3:19:53.600]  that answer your question, sir. In Chicago, that was a great question. Thank you. Josh,
[3:19:53.600 --> 3:19:56.880]  Jeff Hill, Billy, Mike, Mike's actually earlier than some of the other
[3:19:56.880 --> 3:20:02.160]  callers. We're going to get to your call straight ahead with Max Kaiser. Alex Jones

[3:22:09.680 --> 3:22:13.200]  President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the

[3:24:05.080 --> 3:24:11.120]  Every day. Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive. He stood six foot
[3:24:11.120 --> 3:24:15.400]  six and waited 245 kind of road at the shoulder. This is a
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:21.880]  song about a TSA agent. And nobody said much. He'd drag your wife off in a
[3:24:21.880 --> 3:24:32.680]  private room. Big John. Big bad TSA pervert. All right, let's go back to Max
[3:24:32.680 --> 3:24:42.880]  Kaiser. You guys laughing at that or not? Kind of quiet and shy. We're gonna go
[3:24:42.880 --> 3:24:46.200]  back to Max Kaiser and your calls quicker here. But this is an alternate. They
[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:51.800]  always announce old things like they're new. Like, up next, humans breathe
[3:24:51.800 --> 3:24:57.600]  oxygen. Amazing medical discovery. Transfusions of young blood appear to
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:00.960]  rejuvenate the elderly. I mean, that's been one of the biggest things they've
[3:25:00.960 --> 3:25:05.160]  done for 50, 60 years. They've known that people with cancer, you name it. I guess
[3:25:05.160 --> 3:25:07.800]  they don't want you knowing any real treatments, but the rich people all get
[3:25:07.800 --> 3:25:13.240]  that. And now they've been doing transfusions on a gray whiskered mice. And
[3:25:13.240 --> 3:25:18.920]  well, it looks like vampire movies are on to something so far. Really? Well, the
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:22.120]  stomach doesn't digest blood well, but there's mentally ill people that like it.
[3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:28.160]  But healthy blood, if it's not diseased with something of your blood type, if
[3:25:28.160 --> 3:25:30.920]  your cells are old and you're breaking down, yeah, there's all sorts of stuff.
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:36.360]  It says human history, altering news flash. Oh, yeah, talk about sensational when
[3:25:36.360 --> 3:25:39.880]  it's not warranted. Scientists have demonstrated that injections of youthful
[3:25:39.880 --> 3:25:44.920]  blood carry semi-magical rejuvenating qualities, at least for gray whiskered
[3:25:44.920 --> 3:25:48.640]  mice. The researchers believe that the same might hold true for humans,
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:52.560]  suggesting that he's like Alzheimer's. It goes on. That's like saying, it's
[3:25:52.560 --> 3:25:57.280]  semi-magical. You got a heart transplant. Now he can walk. It's semi-magical. You
[3:25:57.280 --> 3:26:01.040]  know, you, I mean, Max Kaiser, what do you say to this? Perhaps we should have a
[3:26:01.040 --> 3:26:04.320]  new tax where we have to like slit our throats and bleed directly into
[3:26:04.320 --> 3:26:08.400]  bankers' mouths. That might actually become something new where the TSA has to
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:11.400]  chop your head off and drink your blood to make sure you're not bad.
[3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:17.360]  The more effective than transfusions of young blood is fecal transplants. This is
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:21.520]  actually documented. You can look it up. Do a Google search right now. If you have
[3:26:21.520 --> 3:26:27.080]  an enema with somebody else's fecal matter, and the germs and the colony from
[3:26:27.080 --> 3:26:32.040]  the transplanted fecal matter actually give you greater immunity. It boosts your
[3:26:32.040 --> 3:26:36.720]  immune system. Look up fecal transplants. Where do you come up with this stuff?
[3:26:36.720 --> 3:26:41.760]  Go look for it. Go look for it. This is better than the blood transfusion.
[3:26:41.760 --> 3:26:48.480]  I'm afraid to even search that. Search that. Well, your listeners aren't afraid like you.
[3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:54.640]  You look scaredy cat. Alright, knock it off, guys. Let's talk to Josh and Georgia.
[3:26:54.640 --> 3:27:04.200]  You're on the air. I'm sorry, folks. Josh and Georgia. Josh and Georgia, go ahead.
[3:27:04.200 --> 3:27:09.280]  You're on the air with the madman. Hey, Alex. I just want to say I've been a fan since a few
[3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:13.840]  years ago. I watched Waking Life and loved every minute of it, especially your
[3:27:13.840 --> 3:27:18.400]  little segment in there. By the way, I've got to say he's right. New York Daily News.
[3:27:18.400 --> 3:27:25.400]  A fecal transplant sounds gross, but saves lives. What the...
[3:27:25.400 --> 3:27:34.880]  Georgia, say it's all the truth of me. Why don't you tell people that in that movie Waking
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:39.840]  Life, Alex, I did your voiceover for that. I played you in that movie. That was my voice
[3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:42.880]  playing, Alex Jones. Why don't you tell the truth?
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:48.280]  I didn't know that, but okay, I believe you. Be serious. The fecal transplant thing's
[3:27:48.280 --> 3:27:53.880]  real. This is not morning radio. And I did my... That's me in Waking Life.
[3:27:53.880 --> 3:27:58.520]  No, you're right. I was just testing it. I wanted to see if you recognize even yourself.
[3:27:58.520 --> 3:28:02.960]  But there you are, in the movie, bigger than life. And you're not getting a fecal transplant,
[3:28:02.960 --> 3:28:05.960]  but you're talking about it because it's healthy.
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:12.440]  Okay. Oh, man. Please, sir. Please, stop. Let's go to Josh. Josh...
[3:28:12.440 --> 3:28:14.840]  Make sure it goes in the right end, Alex. A lot of people are gonna say...
[3:28:14.840 --> 3:28:17.720]  That's enough. That's enough. We have a family. Go ahead, Josh.
[3:28:17.720 --> 3:28:22.480]  Make the points in that movie, polyester. I don't know the movie. Go ahead, Josh.
[3:28:22.480 --> 3:28:27.320]  You have a question for Alex. Yes, I've got a question for... Well, you can both
[3:28:27.320 --> 3:28:34.520]  chime in here. It's pretty much pulled down to where do we draw the line? Police brutality
[3:28:34.520 --> 3:28:42.320]  on the rise, TSA. The Second Amendment on the line of getting cut out. The First Amendment,
[3:28:42.320 --> 3:28:48.840]  you know, it's free speech zones. I'm all for peaceful protest, but where is the line?
[3:28:48.840 --> 3:28:52.840]  Listen, listen. They have it now. They are coming. He is gonna ban all the semi-autos
[3:28:52.840 --> 3:28:56.880]  and say we have mental problems and take our guns, which is not fair to most of us. It
[3:28:56.880 --> 3:29:02.200]  would be fair with Max. And, yeah, I mean, it's horrible the point we've gotten to here.
[3:29:02.200 --> 3:29:10.240]  Here's what you do. Everybody should mimic what Benjamin Nathanao did in the U.N. when
[3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:16.360]  we had the cartoon of the bomb in the big, big red marker. And he said, here's the line.
[3:29:16.360 --> 3:29:21.040]  And Iran can't cross this line. Okay, so now when you go to the TSA and you go through
[3:29:21.040 --> 3:29:27.040]  the airport, you take out a big cartoon of a cartoon version of a bomb or something with
[3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:31.720]  a big red marker. When he comes to touch you, you say, here's the line. You're crossing
[3:29:31.720 --> 3:29:37.760]  the line. Then everybody hold up their Netanyahu poster and say, we're not gonna cross the
[3:29:37.760 --> 3:29:44.840]  line. This is the line. You can't cross the line. How dare you say that weird men shouldn't
[3:29:44.840 --> 3:29:50.800]  be able to take your wife behind closed doors and rip her pants off and grab all over. We're
[3:29:50.800 --> 3:30:01.980]  on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. A little
[3:30:01.980 --> 3:30:06.840]  over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good
[3:30:06.840 --> 3:30:11.760]  sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact that
[3:30:11.760 --> 3:30:16.120]  most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized
[3:30:16.120 --> 3:30:22.160]  world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[3:30:22.160 --> 3:30:27.320]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy. I then searched
[3:30:27.320 --> 3:30:32.920]  out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity. The Young
[3:30:32.920 --> 3:30:37.280]  Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need. And once you've
[3:30:37.280 --> 3:30:43.320]  got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two

[3:33:22.320 --> 3:33:26.400]  When we sit here looking at what's happening in our world, we just have to start saying
[3:33:26.400 --> 3:33:31.600]  no to the power structure. Netanyahu can stand up with an image of a bomb and he won't get in
[3:33:31.600 --> 3:33:35.360]  trouble. If you do, they'll probably execute you even though there's no law. I mean, I'm seeing
[3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:40.640]  a lot of stuff now where people are just such spectators, so weak, so soft. The government
[3:33:40.640 --> 3:33:46.320]  wolves and corporate wolves see that and they're gonna take us down. And the country will collapse
[3:33:46.320 --> 3:33:51.040]  and the world will collapse. People become decadent slobs. Every time that happens, evil
[3:33:51.040 --> 3:33:55.680]  takes over, things collapse, things get tough again, people get tough again, and civilization
[3:33:55.680 --> 3:34:00.160]  comes back. This time the corrupt elite have robots and drones and bio weapons and they
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:04.880]  plan to just kill everybody. And I guess that's what the public wants, so they will murder you.
[3:34:05.920 --> 3:34:10.160]  But there are a lot of us though who don't like being self-propelled stomachs and who don't
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:17.360]  like just buying into every lie and I guess we're the extremist bad guys. Listen, I want to come
[3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:22.240]  in to everybody that's given so far to the InfoWars Money Bomb 2012, this once a year event so we
[3:34:22.240 --> 3:34:28.080]  can get the satellite up links, launch the show, free to air out to more people, the TV show,
[3:34:28.080 --> 3:34:31.920]  and a lot of other things we want to get done around here. We've radically expanded our operations
[3:34:31.920 --> 3:34:36.320]  against the globalist and it's really having a big effect. But I want to thank all of you
[3:34:36.320 --> 3:34:42.960]  that are calling and donating at 888-253-3139. And I want to thank all of you that are also
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:48.080]  donating online with PayPal or credit card at InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com. You can also donate by
[3:34:48.080 --> 3:34:51.680]  getting a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and then sharing with your friends and family. Six people
[3:34:51.680 --> 3:34:57.040]  can sign in simultaneously with the same passcode. It's really six memberships a month for $5.95.
[3:34:57.760 --> 3:35:02.000]  It supports us. Every little bit counts when you buy pro-peer water filters, live straw,
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  discounted at InfoWarsShop.com. If you give $100 you can get one of these t-shirts, the camouflage,
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:13.200]  money bomb, liberty or death shirts. We've got some really cool one-of-a-kind eBay auction
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:19.280]  things like the Nyman microphone we used for about five years in here. It's up there on eBay,
[3:35:19.280 --> 3:35:25.200]  sledgehammers I just used to go through the wall next door. We're expanding. All that is at
[3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:30.320]  InfoWarsMoneyBomb.com. And it's just one more thing that helps us fund the operation. It's
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:34.080]  really been essential to what we've done so far. And I want to thank those in the last four years
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:39.360]  that donated to the money bomb. So thank you so much. We'll continue transmitting until 11 a.m.
[3:35:39.360 --> 3:35:44.960]  tomorrow and we'll be back Sunday 4 to 6. Going back to your calls now for Max Kaiser.
[3:35:44.960 --> 3:35:49.760]  Let's go to Jeff and then we're going to go to Mike and Hillbilly and others. Jeff,
[3:35:49.760 --> 3:35:54.400]  you're on the air with Max Kaiser. Go ahead. Hey Alex. Hey, Kaiser. How you doing, man?
[3:35:54.400 --> 3:35:59.360]  Good. All right. Look, I first I got a comment for both of you and then I got a question for
[3:35:59.360 --> 3:36:03.600]  Kaiser. You know, with all the craziness, monotony that's going on with what these globalists are
[3:36:03.600 --> 3:36:09.040]  trying to accomplish. You guys really know how to make me laugh. Alex, two weeks ago,
[3:36:09.040 --> 3:36:13.600]  you called that older woman who got her free Obama phone. I think you said she was a cross
[3:36:13.600 --> 3:36:19.840]  between Elmo, Oscar the Grouch and the Cookie Monster. I was crying when you said that. I could
[3:36:19.840 --> 3:36:25.840]  not stop laughing. And then you said, after Obama gave us a phone, we're going to do more.
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:30.400]  I mean, dude, you really know how to draw out the humor out of that. Well, I tell you,
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:33.520]  it's all gallows humor. It's just me joking around because I'm really upset about this,
[3:36:33.520 --> 3:36:37.440]  and I would go crazy if I didn't make jokes about it. And a few days after we did that,
[3:36:37.440 --> 3:36:42.160]  somebody actually found Elmo being interviewed on a TV show. I think it's in Canada and actually
[3:36:42.160 --> 3:36:47.120]  put the audio to it. So we're going to play that in a moment for people watching over at
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:53.680]  infowarsmoneybomb.com because it's free folks, free video stream going to 11am. But yeah,
[3:36:53.680 --> 3:36:58.880]  I mean, look, it's good to have some local welfare. It's good to help people that are in
[3:36:58.880 --> 3:37:02.880]  trouble. But when it's federal and when it's designed to make people dependent, it creates
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:07.120]  nightmares like that. I want to get Max Kaiser's take on that and get your question for Max. But
[3:37:07.120 --> 3:37:10.720]  here is the Obama phone lady meets Elmo. Here it is.
[3:37:10.720 --> 3:37:39.440]  There you go. Max Kaiser, what do you say to that information?
[3:37:39.440 --> 3:37:43.200]  I'm waiting for the Obama vibrator. You know, you should stop now. Hey, Max, seriously,
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:48.160]  you are an international TV host. What's going on? And then now once we get in this mode,
[3:37:48.160 --> 3:37:53.040]  it's not good. And don't give Obama any ideas. Please stop, sir. It's a family show.
[3:37:53.040 --> 3:37:56.720]  Every time you vote, you get a little sensation, you know, to give you a little.
[3:37:56.720 --> 3:37:59.760]  Okay, there you go. Now you're trying to do a comedy routine. Caller, do you have
[3:37:59.760 --> 3:38:04.800]  something serious to ask of Max? I do. It's besides the enemy of the state
[3:38:04.800 --> 3:38:10.000]  article he did, which I found funny anyway. But I did want to say something seriously.
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  One thing I do want to mention is that you were Kaiser on the phone the last time on the last
[3:38:16.000 --> 3:38:21.120]  interview with him. And I guess your segment was up and it closed out. So I didn't get all
[3:38:21.120 --> 3:38:26.160]  the total stuff on it. But with this fiscal collapse coming and our American dollar being
[3:38:26.160 --> 3:38:32.320]  used worldwide as our currency as well, why do you believe this this country is going to be the
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:37.680]  worst place hit as opposed to, let's say, in Europe, which you're going to be when this collapse
[3:38:37.680 --> 3:38:44.000]  happens? And how come you're not going to be, let's say, where James Wesley said the better,
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:48.960]  better place to be would be like the northwest part of our country? How come you're going to be
[3:38:48.960 --> 3:38:54.640]  in Europe when this collapse happens? Well, as I've said about the currency collapse and the
[3:38:54.640 --> 3:39:00.080]  fiat money around the world, the US dollars, the World Reserve currency, and all the fiat money
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:08.160]  collapse, it will hold on to that and be one of the last to collapse. The British pound is teetering,
[3:39:08.160 --> 3:39:14.800]  which is looking bad. The Japanese yen is teetering because the dollar is reserve currency. I have
[3:39:14.800 --> 3:39:21.600]  said that it would, you know, be around longer for that last to go. But when it goes, most of
[3:39:21.600 --> 3:39:27.600]  our experts, and I agree, it's going to go the hardest. Now, as far as my personal location,
[3:39:27.600 --> 3:39:34.880]  I am here to cover the collapse in Britain, but I am ready to go anywhere that is where I'm needed.
[3:39:34.880 --> 3:39:43.920]  You know, I'm not in space for the duration of this collapse. I think if people are genuinely
[3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:50.560]  interested in truly insulating themselves from what's coming, they need to sort out their passport
[3:39:50.560 --> 3:39:56.000]  situation. There was a great story on the Rockwell today, which you can look it up, about how the
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:40:02.160]  State Department in the US will effectively make it impossible for Americans to get any passport
[3:40:02.160 --> 3:40:07.680]  at all. They're introducing a questionnaire, which by the nature of the questionnaire, it's
[3:40:07.680 --> 3:40:13.600]  impossible to answer. They ask you things like just ridiculous questions. Oh, yeah. I had an
[3:40:13.600 --> 3:40:18.240]  article out of the Austin American statesman from Sunday. I never covered it on air, guys. I tweeted
[3:40:18.240 --> 3:40:22.960]  a photo of it. I think it's out there in the stack. It's a regular paper. That'll, and it says,
[3:40:22.960 --> 3:40:27.680]  you know, should the government be asking how many times you bathe a week? And that's the news.
[3:40:27.680 --> 3:40:32.560]  It says, like, it says, like, who was the doctor that delivered you and who named everyone in the
[3:40:32.560 --> 3:40:37.600]  operating theater when you were born? Questions like that that are impossible. No, but I'm saying
[3:40:37.600 --> 3:40:42.720]  now the census is yearly and they're asking how much money do you have? When do you go to work?
[3:40:42.720 --> 3:40:47.520]  When do you bathe? I mean, the government is just, listen, you're talking about capital controls.
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:52.320]  They, there's the IRS is saying, if we say you hadn't paid us, you're not leaving the country.
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:40:56.080]  I mean, they really, I agree with you. That's the one. They're not going to leave the country in
[3:40:56.080 --> 3:41:00.480]  any case because you won't have a passport at all. I'm saying, if you read this article on
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:07.680]  New Rockwell today, it says you as an American will be unable to get a passport under any circumstances.
[3:41:07.680 --> 3:41:12.800]  They don't want anyone leaving at all for any reason. No, that's what the IRS is about. And
[3:41:12.800 --> 3:41:17.680]  then they're going to stop you at checkpoints and drag you off. And it'll just be, well, they had to
[3:41:17.680 --> 3:41:22.640]  drag off 20,000 people this month and they'll have like fat people, you know, globalist in uniform,
[3:41:22.640 --> 3:41:26.480]  just a machine gunning us. I mean, folks, we're going to be 20 times more evil than the Nazis.
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:30.160]  But look at the, let me say what, is there any inflation in the system? People say,
[3:41:30.160 --> 3:41:34.720]  no, there's no inflation. Look at how much it costs to buy a second passport. The cost of
[3:41:34.720 --> 3:41:42.400]  buying a second passport on Nevis St. Kitts is $220,000. And in the Republic of Dominica,
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:48.160]  it costs $100,000. The price just went up 20%. That's where the inflation is. The cost of
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:51.680]  buying your way out of the hellhole just went up 20%. That's inflation.
[3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:57.040]  Well, we're going to dig that up. But I know that's been happening. But that's the thing is
[3:41:57.040 --> 3:42:02.000]  that we sit here and make sick jokes about all this. This is really happening. And all the idiots
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:05.840]  that work for the system that are complying with this, you're helping manifest this.
[3:42:05.840 --> 3:42:10.640]  The public's to blame too, but you're 10 times more to blame, 20 times more to blame.
[3:42:10.640 --> 3:42:15.200]  But you need, if you can't get a passport right away, second passport in other country,
[3:42:15.200 --> 3:42:19.680]  you definitely need to open a bank account overseas. One or two different territories.
[3:42:19.680 --> 3:42:25.040]  You need to internationalize your life. It doesn't mean that you are necessarily going to
[3:42:25.040 --> 3:42:29.360]  leave the United States right away. But you need to be able to pick up a bag and get out.
[3:42:29.920 --> 3:42:34.160]  They liked the fact that, what is it, 27% of Americans even have a passport.
[3:42:34.160 --> 3:42:39.760]  And now it's going to just be, it's a conspiracy theory. There is no country outside the US
[3:42:39.760 --> 3:42:42.480]  because they already don't know where Syria and Libya is. They already think
[3:42:42.480 --> 3:42:46.160]  bin Laden is hiding in your wife's brazier. I'm serious. They're going to say,
[3:42:46.160 --> 3:42:49.120]  breastfeeding never happened. You'll be arrested if you say that one on.
[3:42:49.120 --> 3:42:53.120]  Knowing how to tie your shoelaces will be rocket science level after all the fluoride.
[3:42:53.840 --> 3:42:58.480]  And saying there's a country outside the US, they're going to say it's a flat thing floating
[3:42:58.480 --> 3:43:02.800]  in space. I'm telling you, the public would believe that. If they, I'm not joking. If they
[3:43:02.800 --> 3:43:09.280]  told them that the United States is a floating thing in pea soup, the general public would
[3:43:09.280 --> 3:43:13.440]  believe it. And if they told the general public to slit their throats, they would do it. They
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:16.640]  love it. They just want total tyranny. They want to be destroyed. They love it. They love it.
[3:43:17.680 --> 3:43:24.160]  To the caller, I'm just saying, you need to diversify and internationalize and hedge yourself
[3:43:24.720 --> 3:43:27.040]  in a number of different countries. Where's a good place? Where's a good place? I mean,
[3:43:27.040 --> 3:43:30.080]  it's hard to get to because you've got to have a lot of cash all of it. What about Switzerland?
[3:43:31.280 --> 3:43:35.840]  Well, exactly. It requires, but Switzerland actually has to come under attack. You know,
[3:43:35.840 --> 3:43:42.160]  the Americas have attacked Switzerland since Union Bank of Switzerland, UBS, the biggest bank of
[3:43:42.160 --> 3:43:48.800]  Switzerland, they bought Payne Weber in Wall Street, my old firm. And as such, the various
[3:43:48.800 --> 3:43:53.440]  regulatory agencies in the US have now entered Switzerland and they've had all those private
[3:43:53.440 --> 3:43:58.960]  accounts open, wide open. So Switzerland is no longer a safe haven. It's not considered a safe
[3:43:58.960 --> 3:44:04.880]  haven in the US. Let's jump to more calls here. And I do have that article now. They're printing
[3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:09.520]  it. But let's play this. I just want to make fun of the Obama phone, lady. Let's remember Ms. Teen
[3:44:09.520 --> 3:44:16.400]  USA 2007. This is the general public. In fact, this is the Brainiac. This is idiocracy that
[3:44:16.400 --> 3:44:20.960]  Mike Judge, of course, made a phone about. This is the average person now that I talk to.
[3:44:21.920 --> 3:44:25.840]  I mean, our listeners obviously are informed and care. That's why you listen and check what we
[3:44:25.840 --> 3:44:29.680]  say. But remember the general public, you wonder why they laugh at you when you warn them? Because
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:37.040]  they literally do not know what planet they're on. Literally. Okay, people think it's like
[3:44:37.040 --> 3:44:40.960]  evil to even know how to talk now. Let's go ahead and play this. Here it is.
[3:44:42.800 --> 3:44:48.800]  Recent polls have shown a fifth of Americans can't locate the US on a world map. Why do you think
[3:44:48.800 --> 3:45:00.800]  this is? I personally believe that US Americans are unable to do so because some people out there
[3:45:00.800 --> 3:45:08.800]  in our nation don't have bounce. And I believe that our education, like such as South Africa and
[3:45:08.800 --> 3:45:16.800]  Iraq everywhere, like such us. And I believe that they should our education over here in the US
[3:45:16.800 --> 3:45:23.360]  should help the US or should help South Africa. It should help the Iraq and the Asian countries.
[3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:28.880]  So we will be able to build up our future. Thank you very much, South Carolina.
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:35.280]  Folks, I mean, I'm not joking that a lot of people are like that. And they think it's cool.
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:40.320]  And I just can't imagine them during the collapse. They are going to literally folks,
[3:45:40.320 --> 3:45:43.360]  if they tell the bureaucrats to line you and your family up and shoot you,
[3:45:43.360 --> 3:45:47.760]  they're going to do it because they like doing it. They like the power. I mean, I'm telling you,
[3:45:47.760 --> 3:45:52.800]  these bureaucrats will rip the flesh off your bones if they're told to. They hate this country and
[3:45:52.800 --> 3:45:57.360]  they hate anyone who can think. I'm sorry, Max, I'm ranting a bit. Caller, I guess that answers
[3:45:57.360 --> 3:46:02.160]  your question. Let's go to Mike in New Hampshire and then Hillbilly and others. Mike, you're on the
[3:46:02.160 --> 3:46:08.960]  air, light listening today during the evil money bomb. Go ahead, sir. Fantastic. Thanks
[3:46:08.960 --> 3:46:17.440]  for taking my call, Alex. I'm thrilled to be here. First, I'd like to tell you that I'd like to show
[3:46:17.440 --> 3:46:23.600]  you that your efforts, what they actually accomplish, the pebble and the pond, there's 350 million
[3:46:23.600 --> 3:46:29.440]  Americans. And if it wasn't for somebody sending me an email, there was a clip from American
[3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:34.240]  dictators one week after the seven different bombings. I wouldn't be the guy that I am today.
[3:46:34.240 --> 3:46:40.320]  And I'll tell you who I am. I'm the crazy person that's chirping everything that I see off the
[3:46:40.320 --> 3:46:45.200]  show. That's talking about micronutrients. That's talking about the economy. That's talking about
[3:46:45.200 --> 3:46:52.800]  inflation. You know, just right across the board. And when I mentioned something like fluoride,
[3:46:52.800 --> 3:46:57.440]  people say, you know, they'll sit there and they'll, you know, they just, they don't understand
[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:05.360]  where it's coming from. The Americans such as. Yes, exactly. Exactly. But when I'm not discouraged
[3:47:05.360 --> 3:47:10.000]  by it, because I know that I'm planting seeds and I know that down the line, it's going to hit
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:14.480]  somebody upside the head like a brick and they're like, Oh my God, Mike Turner was right. He knew
[3:47:14.480 --> 3:47:21.760]  what he was talking about. And Max Kaiser, I first ran into you on the, I think it was the
[3:47:21.760 --> 3:47:29.520]  Obama deception. Was it that or the fall of the Republic or both? Republic, of course. Yeah.
[3:47:30.080 --> 3:47:35.520]  Well, I, I want to tell you, I watch your show now and me and my guitarist, we both, we both
[3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:41.920]  watch your show. Right off the bat, I sent it out. There's no such thing as guitar. No one can
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:47.440]  play an instrument. That's too advanced. Such as Americans, Obama phone, he gonna do more.
[3:47:47.440 --> 3:47:54.400]  I got an excellent guitarist that's, that's my com, comrade in arms. Next, you're going to tell me
[3:47:54.400 --> 3:47:59.760]  that mammals are supposed to breastfeed, please. Well, you know, or that beef is supposed to eat
[3:47:59.760 --> 3:48:09.040]  grass. I mean, come on. I mean, come on. George Washington is the, is a good guy. FEMA says
[3:48:09.040 --> 3:48:14.960]  he's bad. Well, you know, I think I heard somewhere that he was a terrorist. Well, that's what FEMA
[3:48:14.960 --> 3:48:19.040]  teaches. It must be true. They, they're not the bad guys staying the founder of the country's bad.
[3:48:19.040 --> 3:48:24.800]  They're the good guys. Yeah, mate is right, right? I mean, they have all the guns. That makes them
[3:48:24.800 --> 3:48:29.280]  right. Well, they, yeah, well, yeah, they, well they, they, they, they tell us they have all the
[3:48:29.280 --> 3:48:33.680]  guns and strut around all day bugging their eyes out at us. But I just, I've only got a couple
[3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:40.160]  of guns and I'll use them if I have to. Oh, how dare you. Can I interrupt on you guys? I'm sorry,
[3:48:40.160 --> 3:48:46.080]  if I'm, you know, interrupting. Do you want an Obama phone? Do you guys need a room or something?
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:51.120]  Okay. Go ahead, Kaiser. Thank you, sir, for the call. Kaiser, don't have fantasies here on air,
[3:48:51.120 --> 3:48:55.440]  please. Well, what's going on? I mean, I feel like I'm stuck in an elevator with two guys and
[3:48:55.440 --> 3:49:01.200]  you're going up somewhere and I'm trying to get a question. Okay. Caller, did you have a question?
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:06.880]  Well, he just wanted, he just wanted to. He just wanted to. He watches my show. Oh, that's great,
[3:49:06.880 --> 3:49:10.480]  man. You're, you know, no, you, this is the old mean stockbroker coming up telling old lady,
[3:49:10.480 --> 3:49:14.720]  buy the stock you winch. Listen to the thing. Give me your money, God damn it. What are you waiting
[3:49:14.720 --> 3:49:19.360]  for? Okay, stop, stop Kaiser. This is out of control. Okay. Let's not lose the Lord's name
[3:49:19.360 --> 3:49:24.800]  in vain. That's bad, bad luck. Now listen, sorry, Lord. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop
[3:49:24.800 --> 3:49:31.120]  it. Stop it right now. My point is Kaiser is that he just wanted to tell you he liked your show and
[3:49:31.120 --> 3:49:38.240]  you insulted him here. Well, look, the star of Hawaii 5.0 was my favorite actor, Jack Lord.
[3:49:38.240 --> 3:49:43.840]  That's what I'm referring to. I don't even know what that means. Is that okay? Let's talk to Hill
[3:49:43.840 --> 3:49:49.520]  Billy. You're on the air with, uh, well, Max Kaiser. Hey, how are you guys doing? Oh, we're doing
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:56.160]  all right. Sounds like it. Hey, listen, I'm a prison planet dot TV member. Thank you for being
[3:49:56.160 --> 3:50:04.000]  member and, uh, I've shot the temple workshop all the time. Thank you. Great stuff. Thank you. Uh,
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:08.640]  listen, uh, real quick, you're looking, I heard you mentioned before you're looking for a ministry
[3:50:08.640 --> 3:50:15.280]  to support Michael Rude, R-O-O-D Rude. He is on the flight against the New World Order just like
[3:50:15.280 --> 3:50:19.840]  you. Great stuff. You might want to check it out. Uh, second of all, have you ever heard of the
[3:50:19.840 --> 3:50:26.560]  Gerson miracle? Uh, it rings a small bell. Uh, what was it? Was that one Max Kaiser?
[3:50:26.560 --> 3:50:31.600]  There were wings that flew around the room. Well, no, it was actually a doctor named Maxwell
[3:50:31.600 --> 3:50:37.760]  Gerson that, uh, um, that the, the, the elite's poison, actually, he came up with a cure for
[3:50:37.760 --> 3:50:42.960]  cancer. His daughter is carrying on his work until he wanted Mexico, carrying the cancer,
[3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:46.960]  and she claims she can cure any chronic disease. Well, there are a lot of treatments that they,
[3:50:46.960 --> 3:50:50.560]  sure. So there are a lot of treatments that they block. Uh, God bless you, sir. I appreciate your
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:56.560]  call. We're on the calls here for Max Kaiser. I want to say something. The, um, I wanted to
[3:50:56.560 --> 3:51:00.560]  bring it back down to something serious here. We were talking about these countries for different
[3:51:00.560 --> 3:51:06.160]  countries. You're saying, oh, Switzerland or different, you know, the two countries that are
[3:51:06.160 --> 3:51:11.040]  bordering America right now, Canada and Mexico, Canada has become a fortress. If you've ever
[3:51:11.040 --> 3:51:16.320]  tried to go into Canada, it is extremely difficult to do so. And you can't move money back and
[3:51:16.320 --> 3:51:20.320]  forth out of Canada. And people know this, but look, Mexico is becoming this way too. You know,
[3:51:20.320 --> 3:51:25.840]  there's more pressure to keep Americans out of Mexico now than the other way around.
[3:51:25.840 --> 3:51:31.600]  There's, because Mexico, due to their huge oil position, et cetera, is becoming a state that
[3:51:31.600 --> 3:51:37.040]  is trying to keep Americans out within five or six years. You're going to see American, that whole
[3:51:37.040 --> 3:51:42.880]  wall between US and Mexico there to keep Americans out of Mexico. And by the way, Max, when you talk
[3:51:42.880 --> 3:51:47.440]  about this, it totally creeps me out because I know all the points you're saying are true.
[3:51:47.440 --> 3:51:52.720]  I have so much data on it. And it really is upsetting to be sitting here and seeing them just
[3:51:52.720 --> 3:51:58.000]  clamped down to steal everybody's wealth and property. And I don't even care about that. That
[3:51:58.000 --> 3:52:02.240]  it's my family. And then I've sworn to try to defend this republic. And it's a new world order.
[3:52:02.240 --> 3:52:06.480]  There's nowhere to run. But man, I just hope the public knows we're not playing games here.
[3:52:06.480 --> 3:52:11.680]  Yeah. No, I mean, the point is that if you think that you're what you're saying or I'm saying
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:20.320]  is abstract in any sense or in the far horizon and is not immediate, look at what's happening to
[3:52:20.320 --> 3:52:26.080]  the two countries bordering America, Canada, and they got the huge pipeline. That's the,
[3:52:26.080 --> 3:52:31.040]  that's the, as you cover on your show, that goes from Canada down to Mexico, which is servicing
[3:52:31.040 --> 3:52:37.760]  actually, you know, not America, but foreign entities. And that is opening up a very strong
[3:52:37.760 --> 3:52:43.280]  police presence that is not answerable to any of those three countries individually, but for
[3:52:43.280 --> 3:52:50.720]  them collectively. And that's where the US loses its sovereignty. You are right in the kill zone,
[3:52:50.720 --> 3:52:55.040]  if you will, of that phenomenon, because that pipeline... Oh, no, no, no. They're using pipelines
[3:52:55.040 --> 3:53:01.840]  and roads as multinational zones. The UN on record says they've taken over Austin on their website.
[3:53:01.840 --> 3:53:05.840]  Right. So that's right there. Yeah, yeah. That's right there, right in your backyard. I mean,
[3:53:05.840 --> 3:53:12.000]  that's really happening now. And that's that should give people listeners the idea that this is not
[3:53:12.000 --> 3:53:17.280]  something we're talking about is in the fanciful future. This is happening now.
[3:53:18.000 --> 3:53:24.560]  It's unbelievable. I mean, it is just in crazy. I mean, it'd be better if the US did collapse
[3:53:24.560 --> 3:53:29.040]  like the old Soviet Union, because if they're able to keep this going, I mean, there's nothing
[3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:34.640]  they won't steal because the public are thumbs sucking mindless jellyfish begging to be gang
[3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:38.880]  raped by the government. I mean, I just... Well, the mathematics are horrible because going back
[3:53:38.880 --> 3:53:45.200]  40 years, which was the beginning of the post gold standard and the creation of derivatives,
[3:53:45.200 --> 3:53:52.400]  there's been this tug of war between GDP growth, GDP growth and debt creation. And for years,
[3:53:52.400 --> 3:53:56.640]  you've had this give and take. You've had periods of slowdowns and recessions where the debt had
[3:53:56.640 --> 3:54:02.160]  become overwhelming the GDP growth. And then you'd have these periods of growth to counteract that.
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:06.400]  But starting in 2007, and this is what makes this crisis different than any other crisis
[3:54:06.400 --> 3:54:14.000]  in American history before it, is that the debt now is so completely outrageously high as compared
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:19.760]  to any possible GDP growth scenario to grow America out of it, that it's quite disturbing.
[3:54:19.760 --> 3:54:25.840]  And I'll give you this interesting statistic. The amount of GDP growth needed to get America
[3:54:25.840 --> 3:54:34.000]  out of its current economic problems would require burning more barrels of oil than there are in the
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:38.800]  ground. In other words, you've got about a trillion barrels of oil that have been burned since the
[3:54:38.800 --> 3:54:44.880]  beginning of the Industrial Revolution. There are, by some estimates, a trillion barrels left.
[3:54:45.680 --> 3:54:50.960]  If you were to burn one trillion barrels of oil, you would not generate enough GDP growth to
[3:54:50.960 --> 3:54:55.920]  generate the taxes required to pay the existing debt. Yeah. And so they're going to, as Gerald
[3:54:55.920 --> 3:55:00.400]  Salante says, just go to pure prisons and giant death camps and people in black uniforms stomping
[3:55:00.400 --> 3:55:05.120]  around everywhere. I mean, it's just, it's hell itself being relieved. And then hopefully we got
[3:55:05.120 --> 3:55:08.240]  ahead of this and have exposed it enough where they're going to have trouble rolling it out. But
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:15.040]  we've got to fight them at every level and realize we have a bug-eyed, beady-eyed, criminal, evil
[3:55:15.040 --> 3:55:21.280]  government run by mega-corporations with maniac heads and bankers who are only... Oh, let me ask
[3:55:21.280 --> 3:55:25.920]  you this. Going back to the American Revolution, only a third of the people living in America wanted
[3:55:25.920 --> 3:55:32.160]  the revolution. It was 3% started it and then 5% won it as actual combatants. About 10% support.
[3:55:32.160 --> 3:55:37.280]  It's less than a third. Okay. So then you had like a third or so were sympathetic to the British
[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:41.200]  and the remainder were completely ambivalent. Yeah. No, actually about 70%.
[3:55:41.200 --> 3:55:48.000]  I mean, it went back and forth, but you're right. More than half. Let me break it down because it's
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:55.200]  been looked at. About half were Tories and then about 90% of the others were just thumb-sucking
[3:55:55.200 --> 3:56:00.960]  on the fence. And it was really overall less than 10% that were against being total slaves.
[3:56:00.960 --> 3:56:06.240]  All right. So you have my question then. You've got less than, you know, you only had
[3:56:06.240 --> 3:56:13.440]  a few percentage points of the population. It was actually for revolution. And you only had a
[3:56:13.440 --> 3:56:17.680]  few thousand men because, you know, there was not really... You're just talking about men at that
[3:56:17.680 --> 3:56:23.680]  point. Okay. A few women who put that together. So now you flash forward to 2012. We're at a
[3:56:23.680 --> 3:56:28.240]  similar situation where we're not being occupied by the British. We're being occupied by bankers
[3:56:28.240 --> 3:56:32.960]  and global bankers and there's five or 10 of the major banks and they have us by the throat because
[3:56:32.960 --> 3:56:37.360]  they control the money, they control the interest rates, they control the debt, and this is well
[3:56:37.360 --> 3:56:44.000]  documented on your show. So is our sufficient number of people in the U.S. right now that are
[3:56:44.000 --> 3:56:48.640]  alive and breathing and they are they coming together to do what needs to be done? Because
[3:56:48.640 --> 3:56:53.680]  under the Constitution, it says quite clearly that if tyrants take over the government, it's a
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:56:57.360]  constitutional responsibility of the people to take back the government. Yeah, it's not a right,
[3:56:57.360 --> 3:57:02.400]  it's a duty. And that's in the Declaration of Independence as well. That's right. It's a
[3:57:02.400 --> 3:57:06.800]  codified in the Second Amendment. I'm not going to get into more detail on that, but that's where
[3:57:06.800 --> 3:57:15.360]  you find it. Is there going to be some kind of attempt to stage a new Declaration of Independence?
[3:57:15.360 --> 3:57:20.560]  I mean, here's the problem. The guys back then were not in Arizona running drones,
[3:57:20.560 --> 3:57:25.680]  killing people and getting medals for it. They had been in constant vicious wars with
[3:57:25.680 --> 3:57:30.160]  comma hawks hacking each other up. Both sides used those and we're just... We're actually
[3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:36.400]  a very intelligent and form vicious killers. I'm just saying the men are not like that today.
[3:57:36.400 --> 3:57:42.880]  No. They were battle ready. They had already... They had spent years enduring, you know, going
[3:57:42.880 --> 3:57:47.600]  back to the pilgrims of extremely rough time and establishing this country. So they were rough and
[3:57:47.600 --> 3:57:51.040]  ready and they took on what they needed to be done. So you're saying that that doesn't exist.
[3:57:51.040 --> 3:57:57.200]  You've had too many years of the soft kill, as you say, the media, the drugs, etc. You just don't
[3:57:57.200 --> 3:58:04.880]  have the necessary critical mass to stage the proper... Well, I mean, take the founders.
[3:58:04.880 --> 3:58:09.120]  They lost almost every battle the first five years they never gave up. It was the resistance
[3:58:09.120 --> 3:58:12.880]  that was unstoppable. It was the fact that they were like piranhas. I mean, you know,
[3:58:12.880 --> 3:58:16.240]  they would drag with their shoes falling off, literally with blood behind them, you know,
[3:58:16.240 --> 3:58:19.520]  a hundred miles giant cannons. Alex, do I need to come to Austin?
[3:58:20.960 --> 3:58:24.880]  We'd love to have you here in Austin. Do I need to come to Austin? Do we need to get serious
[3:58:24.880 --> 3:58:28.480]  and stage the revolution from Austin? You know, Max, if you were serious about that,
[3:58:28.480 --> 3:58:32.080]  David, they'll come kill you today. I know the point is we are staging the revolution.
[3:58:32.080 --> 3:58:36.480]  Who cares? It's give me liberty or give me death. Let's get it on.
[3:58:36.480 --> 3:58:55.440]  I think they call it victory or death. Stay there. Stay there, Max.
