[00:00.000 --> 00:15.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:31.000 --> 00:45.000]  Political outrage turns bloody in Berkeley. Our KPIX 5 crews were right in the middle of the chaos as both Trump supporters and anti-Trump activists come to blows.
[00:45.000 --> 00:56.000]  Protesters followed Trump supporters to their cars as they left the convention center, around the corner and away from police protection on St. Carlo Street, a mob mentality took over.
[00:56.000 --> 01:03.000]  What do you say to the people who dragged a poor white guy out of a car and beat him?
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Oh my goodness, poor white people, please, all my staff.
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  These were pure attacks. Trump supporters, men, women, even the elderly left this building last night and walked right into danger.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  This Trump supporter was the first casualty of the day, with blood streaming out of his face.
[01:19.000 --> 01:43.000]  Pro-Trump and anti-Trump protesters got into it.
[01:43.000 --> 01:52.000]  You're saying if you're out there and you're trying to represent your First Amendment right to free speech, if somebody comes and attacks you, it's your right to defend yourself.
[01:52.000 --> 02:04.000]  It got ugly. Violence erupting at the event is fight, broke out, fist flying between Trump supporters and anti-Trump supporters. It gets pretty ugly.
[02:04.000 --> 02:15.000]  Yeah, I want to warn the folks watching at home you're about to see some very violent footage.
[02:15.000 --> 02:25.000]  Organizers say today's rallies were meant as a show of unity against what they call a seditious fringe allegedly trying to sabotage the president.
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  You can see there a FedEx delivery driver jumping in to try to put an end to the protest.
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  It's the strength in numbers. I'll give it to you. If you want to come at me, I'll give you a hundred of you against one of me because that's what it's going to take.
[02:37.000 --> 02:59.000]  You got that? This is the heart of 1776.
[02:59.000 --> 03:08.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this Tuesday, the 23rd day of January 2018.
[03:08.000 --> 03:16.000]  Now, I've got a lot of sources obviously in Congress. I've got sources in the Pentagon. I've got sources in federal law enforcement.
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.000]  I've got sources in academia. I've got sources in the press. I've got sources across the board.
[03:24.000 --> 03:33.000]  And in the last few days, I have basically reverse engineered what is in the bombshell congressional memo.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  And then I've checked with my sources without them revealing anything secret.
[03:39.000 --> 03:48.000]  Played a little game of is this accurate? Is that accurate? Would this be what's in it? Would that be what's in it?
[03:48.000 --> 03:59.000]  And because I already know what's in it by studying the entire compendium and being in the center of the so-called Russia investigation as well.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  Because of all that knowledge, I have been able to reverse engineer it.
[04:04.000 --> 04:13.000]  And then I've been able to check with people that have seen the memo or who were part of the memo or who were part of pieces of the memo.
[04:13.000 --> 04:25.000]  And they have said that basically my analysis of the memo is dead on and that the memo will probably be released by next week.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  Maybe even sooner.
[04:28.000 --> 04:30.000]  There's a big fight behind the scenes.
[04:30.000 --> 04:45.000]  Congressman chef of California who's been quarterbacking the whole Russia hoax at the house level is battling to stop its release because it's going to come back in the end to Congress and the Democrats.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Folks, they all got in a room together. The Democrats all got in a room together when he was president-elect. That's what's in the memo.
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  And I'm going to reveal that today. I'm going to reveal what's in the memo. Get ready. Explosively. Tomorrow's news today.
[04:58.000 --> 05:03.000]  Fuel your body with carnivore, the new digestive enzyme product by InfoWars Life.
[05:03.000 --> 05:11.000]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process and increase the bioavailability of nutrients by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion caused by fermentation of undigested food particles in the gut.
[05:16.000 --> 05:23.000]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age. Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes like those naturally present in the body.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.000]  Enjoy the full potential of protein-rich foods again.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  You can eat protein-heavy foods now while minimizing the later indigestion and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[05:33.000 --> 05:41.000]  Just one pill with every high protein meal helps increase the bioavailability and absorption of amino acids, the building blocks to your muscles.
[05:41.000 --> 05:48.000]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes to help digest fats and carbohydrates so you can fully digest all types of meals.
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  Don't let a meal go to waste. Use carnivore by InfoWars Life.
[05:52.000 --> 05:59.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle now. That's InfoWarsLife.com
[06:22.000 --> 06:24.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:32.000 --> 06:46.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars and our team of investigative journalists and our sources have been able to reverse engineer the bombshell congressional memo
[06:46.000 --> 06:59.000]  on the FISA court's activities and the FBI's activities, the Justice Department's activities, congressional Democrats' activities, the Democratic Party's activities, Hillary Clinton's activities,
[06:59.000 --> 07:05.000]  the FBI director at the time, James Comey activities. And we know what is in the memo.
[07:05.000 --> 07:12.000]  And we know why they are attempting to not have it released to the public or have it heavily redacted.
[07:12.000 --> 07:23.000]  Because the Democrats during the campaign thought Hillary was invincible and began to illegally surveil the president.
[07:23.000 --> 07:32.000]  Then they did what you call parallel construction to cover themselves and later went and got a warrant, that too based on fraud.
[07:32.000 --> 07:42.000]  And as you've already seen the last month, the drip, drip, drip bombshells, all of these like atomic bombs dropping on the heads of the deep state,
[07:42.000 --> 07:56.000]  and the criminal Clinton crime network, the cabal, the La Cosa Nostra, which means our secret society, our secret thing, La Cosa Nostra means our secret society, our secret thing.
[07:56.000 --> 08:11.000]  And I've said for weeks it is a La Cosa Nostra style cabal of the highest levels of the Clinton crime network that they started putting in place in 1993 that Bush pretty much went along with.
[08:11.000 --> 08:19.000]  And they're like family members, they vacation together, Barbara Bush calls in Bill Clinton her son, they run the same scam foundations together.
[08:19.000 --> 08:37.000]  So from 1993, right through to Barack Obama in 2017, leaving office on January 20th, they've got at the top of the FBI more than 70% of the key personnel in place as well as the Justice Department.
[08:37.000 --> 08:55.000]  I mean, it is a nightmare. For 26 years, 26 years they have been stacking the federal courts, stacking the FISA courts, stacking the Justice Department, stacking the FBI at the top.
[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  And if you're not a globalist Democrat ready to cover up their crimes, you don't get into any positions of power.
[09:03.000 --> 09:17.000]  It's absolutely true that the average rank and file FBI agent is a hardworking person. I mean, I grew up new FBI agents that were working 18 hours a day with kidnappings and bank robberies and money laundering and just risking their lives.
[09:17.000 --> 09:28.000]  But that's your local FBI. At the top, it's super political. It's always been political, but now it's globalist Democrat crime syndicate.
[09:28.000 --> 09:50.000]  And so it hit me last night as I was going to bed about midnight and I made a bunch of calls that, wow, I've got to get up in the morning and really get up early and kind of codify all this together and present it because we know what's in the memo.
[09:50.000 --> 10:06.000]  We predicted and knew what the FBI was doing before, what the Clintons were doing. We've laid all that out, how they had a cabal inside, how they were fixing the intelligence, how they lied to get the FISA court, how they illegally surveilled Trump Tower, myself included.
[10:06.000 --> 10:17.000]  We broke all that with the guest, with the eyewitnesses, with the people that have testified behind closed doors in Congress, multiple guests we've had on that have been part of this whole thing.
[10:17.000 --> 10:29.000]  And they're sworn to secrecy and not supposed to talk about it, but then the Democrats selectively put out pieces of transcripts that are edited. So they're not playing by the rules here.
[10:29.000 --> 10:44.000]  So I got up this morning, took care, made breakfast, hung out with the children, got them off the school and have tried to collate all this together to present it.
[10:44.000 --> 10:57.000]  And, you know, I decided what I'm going to do is I'm going to tell you the contents of the memo in the last segment of this hour.
[10:57.000 --> 11:10.000]  But before that, I'm going to roll through the history of it and what we already know and what's been admitted. And then I'm going to give you finally what's in there.
[11:10.000 --> 11:32.000]  The reason it's so bombshell is that the memo is the findings of stated fact and other documents and witnesses of the FBI and the Justice Department trying to frame the president and his voters as Russian dupes or Russian agents,
[11:32.000 --> 11:46.000]  getting illegal warrants, then covering it up, then destroying the 5,000 text messages. It's a lot more than that between stroke and page, struck and page.
[11:46.000 --> 12:09.000]  And the paying of money through the FBI, the Fusion GPS to the family members of FBI agents and everybody else and more documents pertaining to how these individuals did that and the fact that they've already been caught talking about how they were forming a shadow government,
[12:09.000 --> 12:17.000]  how they were forming a cabal, how they were forming a secret society. And all of that has pretty much already come out.
[12:17.000 --> 12:30.000]  But what's important is the connections to how Hillary Clinton was directing the whole thing through the Democratic Party.
[12:30.000 --> 12:45.000]  And now we have congressional testimony that's been given by the head of Fusion GPS where he says people are being killed in association with the dossier. Well, that's actually true.
[12:45.000 --> 12:54.000]  But it's people that could expose how they manufactured it and it's people that could expose how they were planning to steal the election and how they did steal the election.
[12:54.000 --> 13:05.000]  You know, people that got shot in the back in Washington, DC. And that's why you see Donna Brazil coming out and distancing herself from Hillary and all this.
[13:05.000 --> 13:17.000]  And that's why you've got the missing laptops being found by the Capitol Police and they won't turn them over even though Debbie Wasserman Schultz is on television in their meeting threatening them if they don't.
[13:17.000 --> 13:26.000]  And she's shaking because she knows what's on that laptop. So the memo connects the dots.
[13:26.000 --> 13:36.000]  And it's a lengthy quote memo. It's really a real dossier. And it just shows the web of how this is all interconnected.
[13:36.000 --> 13:46.000]  That's why you've seen Jim Jordan and them going back over a month and a half ago going, you know, I feel like when we finally get these people to testify and find out what's happening,
[13:46.000 --> 13:54.000]  I feel like Struck and McCabe and all them probably met and decided to make up this dossier and decided to take it to the FISA court.
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  And the president had to order the FISA court to issue it. And I feel like we're going to learn you guys were all in a cabal and knew it was all a big lie.
[14:01.000 --> 14:09.000]  And I feel he doesn't feel like he's got all the documents. It's just secret.
[14:09.000 --> 14:14.000]  And then of course a week later, all that came out. They're letting the Democrats know what they're going to do.
[14:14.000 --> 14:21.000]  So now FBI Struck and Page spoke of secret society after Trump election.
[14:21.000 --> 14:29.000]  Trump had been elected. It's November 9th. And they say we are forming the secret society now.
[14:29.000 --> 14:39.000]  We're forming our own organization, our thing. We're forming our new organization. Call it a secret society today.
[14:39.000 --> 14:51.000]  We're going to go meet with the deputy director tomorrow. And they marched in there and they cooked up this whole criminal conspiracy in there and even called it a secret society.
[14:51.000 --> 15:01.000]  Because that's what secret societies were the old intelligence agencies, like the NSA, the CIA, the FBI. That's what you called them with secret societies.
[15:01.000 --> 15:14.000]  And then in the modern day they go, those don't exist. That's crazy. No, they formed a La Cosa Nostra. I don't mean it's an Italian operation, but La Cosa Nostra means our thing, our secret thing.
[15:14.000 --> 15:28.000]  And so they have a family with Robert Mueller, with Comey, with McCabe and all these people under them and Fusion GPS to fence the fraud, to fence the lie,
[15:28.000 --> 15:37.000]  and then bring it back and then try to push it and the whole desperate things falling apart. And I've now talked to sources that have seen sections of the memo
[15:37.000 --> 15:49.000]  and it is going to absolutely devastate the Democrats. And I wouldn't be surprised if Comey and if Mueller and Hillary Clinton does not go to prison.
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  Because they've broke the rules here. They've gone so far. The word is they are going to be indicted. They are going to go to prison for massive conspiracy against the Republic.
[15:58.000 --> 16:05.000]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[16:05.000 --> 16:15.000]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[16:21.000 --> 16:25.000]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.

[18:08.000 --> 18:21.000]  For more than a decade my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[18:59.000 --> 19:16.000]  I want to plow into all of this. I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com
[19:16.000 --> 19:24.000]  You are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot say it any clear and so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.

[19:39.000 --> 19:51.000]  Infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[19:51.000 --> 20:10.000]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[20:10.000 --> 20:21.000]  I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass and I'm all out of bubblegum.
[20:21.000 --> 20:35.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[20:35.000 --> 20:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are only days, maybe a week, max away from the total devastation of the Democratic Party leadership for their organized brazen criminal plot to overturn the election of President Trump and remove him from office
[20:55.000 --> 21:14.000]  by framing him for Russian collusion when there was absolutely zero evidence of it. Now they've moved on to hopefully finding some type of obstruction or perjury when they're the ones in front of Congress, Mueller, Comey, all of them caught lying over and over and over again.
[21:14.000 --> 21:25.000]  And so in the final segment of the shower, I'm going to just lay out the intel that I've been told is in the memo.
[21:25.000 --> 21:36.000]  But the secret congressional memo on the quote FISA court is the story of the illegal spying, then illegally getting the warrant lying about it.
[21:36.000 --> 21:46.000]  Then trying to classify it, then the NSA director calling Trump the first week he's in office, laying it all out.
[21:46.000 --> 22:01.000]  Trump saying I've been illegally spot on, the media saying you're insane, that never happened. Comey testifying to Congress, along with many others saying it never happened when they were involved, that's coming out in the memo.
[22:01.000 --> 22:12.000]  The memo is really a blueprint for indictment. It's a prosecution's case to the grand jury, the American people. That's what it is.
[22:12.000 --> 22:18.000]  When they say it's bombshell, it's going to lay it all out. Who did what, how they did it, the evidence, they've got everything.
[22:18.000 --> 22:34.000]  Trump's got the whole NSA file now. The unmasking, Susan Powers, rice, all of it. Samantha Powers, rice, all of it. I mean, it's all right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:34.000 --> 22:49.000]  And it's the brazen, hootspa, bravada, hubris craziness, that they would do this and now commit all these crimes to cover it up.
[22:49.000 --> 22:59.000]  So I'm trying to collate because there's so much evidence, so many pieces I want to get to. This is so big, I'm tempted to go off the air and have Owen Schroyer come host the show.
[22:59.000 --> 23:06.000]  And just going to spend two hours in my office and try to really codify it because I've got all the evidence, I've got the sources. I know it's in the memo.
[23:06.000 --> 23:18.000]  I know it's a blueprint for indictment. It's bombshell proof. It's perjury. It's conspiracy to defraud the voters. It's conspiracy to frame the president.
[23:18.000 --> 23:25.000]  And it's all there. And you notice they keep telling you, we feel like this is what's happening. They already have it.
[23:25.000 --> 23:33.000]  And then they release it. Jim Jordan, Nunez, Trey Gowdy, everybody.
[23:33.000 --> 23:46.000]  And you've got the Democrats now, the congressional Democrats that met with Hillary and others in the two months before the president got inaugurated.
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  And there's records of that reportedly. And then there's the FBI records and the text messages and the emails about we got to get an insurance policy.
[23:55.000 --> 24:01.000]  We got to form a secret society. We're going to stop this guy. And that's the stuff we've got.
[24:01.000 --> 24:13.000]  And now it's been reported that the type of galaxy phones they were issued hard code all the text messages on them. Everybody already knows that.
[24:13.000 --> 24:22.000]  None of that's ever erased. You've got to have a special technician that knows how to go in and delete that stuff.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  I can't tell you how many times we've accidentally deleted something and we just have an expert go in and pull it back up out of the trash.
[24:29.000 --> 24:36.000]  And it's more sophisticated than that. There's another copy as well.
[24:36.000 --> 24:51.000]  And so they have been caught now saying 5,000 text messages between these two FBI agents have been deleted by accident.
[24:51.000 --> 24:58.000]  Bleach bit creator ex FBI experts question loss of Peter Strock's text.
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.000]  Well, absolutely.
[25:01.000 --> 25:10.000]  It's ridiculous. So there's so many moving parts here that my head is spinning right now.
[25:10.000 --> 25:19.000]  But the bombshell of them saying we got to have an insurance policy. We got to meet. We can't let this guy stay in office.
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  First thing I have an insurance policy when he's running for office. Then when he wins, okay, we got to form the conspiracy.
[25:25.000 --> 25:32.000]  We got to form the secret society. We got to stop them. We're going to meet with a deputy director tomorrow on and on and on.
[25:32.000 --> 25:38.000]  And that's just what they've released so far, hoping the Democrats give up and roll over because this is going to be a firestorm.
[25:38.000 --> 25:42.000]  This is going to be very, very dangerous for the country.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  A sharp digital forensics expert may still be able to recover them.
[25:46.000 --> 25:56.000]  It's an Andrew Zime creator of Bleach bit. The software that Hillary Clinton subordinates use to clear information from her private server.
[25:56.000 --> 26:04.000]  In general, whenever the software deletes any information, traces are left of the storage device, though they become disorganized like the proverbial needle in a haystack,
[26:04.000 --> 26:10.000]  but they build in backdoors is what he's telling you where the government wants to be able to go back in.
[26:10.000 --> 26:19.000]  And there's a breadcrumb trail because it's all still there to then re-project the skeletal map onto it to be able to pull it back off.
[26:19.000 --> 26:29.000]  And we've got the man that developed a lot of this, Dr. William Benny, former technical head of the National Security Agency, joining us in the second hour to talk about all this.
[26:29.000 --> 26:33.000]  So we'll get a top expert for you on that and we'll pick his gray on there as well.
[26:33.000 --> 26:41.000]  So that's the magnitude of what we're dealing with. But yes, you get tomorrow's news today.
[26:41.000 --> 26:52.000]  I have made a lot of phone calls to top experts and we have all the pieces and we have with the congressional folks have already been hinting at for months that then the next week they release word for word.
[26:52.000 --> 26:58.000]  Remember that tape I played a month ago, Jim Jordan saying, you know, I kind of feel like they all went to McCabe's office.
[26:58.000 --> 27:03.000]  They said, we got to stop the president getting in or got to remove him, got to have some kind of insurance policy.
[27:03.000 --> 27:10.000]  I kind of feel like it was all a cabal of them working together, you know, to stop all this and to create this fraud.
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  And that's just what I feel like might be there because he has high level security clearance and it's seen it all.
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  And the next week exactly that's released.
[27:18.000 --> 27:23.000]  So I've talked to folks that have seen sections of what's been put in the investigation.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  It's an investigational finding a blueprint. It's an impeachment basically of them.
[27:29.000 --> 27:34.000]  The House indicts the Senate tries the president. Well, it's the same thing.
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  The House has produced an indictment. That is what this memo is.
[27:41.000 --> 27:45.000]  It is a blueprint. It is a finding of fact from their own documents.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.000]  It is a house indictment of the Clinton crime syndicate.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  Lois Lerner thing was huge.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  Oh, Representative Jim Jordan told the Daily Caller, my gut tells me this is probably bigger.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  Oh, his gut's telling him more.
[28:02.000 --> 28:07.000]  He's got all the documents of Lois Lerner.
[28:07.000 --> 28:15.000]  And it goes on and on and on with tarmac meetings with the former Justice Department head Loretta Lynch and all of it.
[28:15.000 --> 28:22.000]  It's all going to be there. How these people, this cabal of a few FBI agents and Justice Department, less than 30 people,
[28:22.000 --> 28:29.000]  put there by the Clintons, continued by Obama and others, how they protect the Clinton crime machine,
[28:29.000 --> 28:36.000]  protect the Obama crime machine, collect data to blackmail and attack and go after Christians, libertarians, conservatives,
[28:36.000 --> 28:39.000]  go after the churches, go after the 501c3s, you name it.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  Then they try to stop Trump with made-up stuff in the campaign.
[28:42.000 --> 28:46.000]  Then they get illegal wiretaps. Then they get caught. Then they get warrants.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  Then they lie about that. Then they try to cover up the whole crime.
[28:50.000 --> 29:19.000]  Then they lie to Congress. And it's all coming out. It's all coming out. Criminals, get ready.
[29:20.000 --> 29:32.000]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?
[29:32.000 --> 29:37.000]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years. I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case.

[36:23.000 --> 36:50.000]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  This is nowhere in the press, by the way.
[36:53.000 --> 37:02.000]  I knew this was coming in earlier and I was dealing with it, trying to conduct the broadcast while I knew all this was going on.
[37:02.000 --> 37:08.000]  Now I'm trying to go over all this, but here it is.
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  Let's just get a document cam shot on this right now so I can send this out live.
[37:11.000 --> 37:16.000]  People can then stop it and rewind it and the press and people can look at it and go back over it.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  There's page one. That's a good shot right there.
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  There's page two, page three.
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  I don't normally do this on air, but obviously this is important.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  infowars.com.com.
[37:28.000 --> 37:36.000]  If you want to see this, this is all how they did it to Trump, how they tracked it, all the spine, good God.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  So it's all right here.
[37:40.000 --> 37:54.000]  Now I want to explain though, Congress is writing their report on this memo that's a roadmap to the perjury and the lying and all the rest of it.
[37:54.000 --> 38:00.000]  So that's a separate part, their report on the memo and then what it connects to.
[38:00.000 --> 38:07.000]  And they organized raising conspiracy to overturn the election and defraud the civil rights of U.S. citizens.
[38:07.000 --> 38:18.000]  I mean, the amount of crimes committed here are just absolutely staggering when you read this stuff.
[38:18.000 --> 38:24.000]  Their authorization, they say it was spying on Trump with weapons of mass destruction and working for a foreign intelligence operation.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  Look at the stuff they said to get this.
[38:30.000 --> 38:37.000]  So it just goes on and on and obviously this is trying to eat an elephant in one bite.
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.000]  I think for everybody's safety, we're just going to go ahead and post this and send out a link to this the next 10 minutes.
[38:43.000 --> 38:47.000]  I'm going to go ahead and go to the video that's on drudgerport.com.
[38:47.000 --> 38:52.000]  If you want to find it, if you're a radio listener, it's right in the middle of the site.
[38:52.000 --> 39:01.000]  We also have new video where they're saying we want to take conservatives and we're going to murder them.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  We're coming as we're going to chop their heads off.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  Everybody's like, yes, we're going to murder everyone.
[39:05.000 --> 39:09.000]  So that video is coming up as well.
[39:09.000 --> 39:19.000]  But I told you that I've been talking to a lot of folks that have seen the original actual memo they're talking about.
[39:19.000 --> 39:23.000]  I'll have right here for you first.
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  But then as I'm saying, don't get confused.
[39:25.000 --> 39:32.000]  There's another memo and they're hyping it saying the contents of the memo, we're going to put a report out soon.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  And then they put a report out with this because this catches them in all the different lies and perjury.
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  And remember seeing it in saying nobody's spying on Trump.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  MSNBC, the New York Times, you know, we made this up and infowars made this up and our guests made it up.
[39:46.000 --> 39:50.000]  We had William Benning on at the time who is now advising the president.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[39:52.000 --> 39:58.000]  So you can put two of them together, but we appreciate Mr. Benny sending us this.
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  And of course, it was hiding in plain view, legally done.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  And I'm not at liberty to tell you yet.
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  We're not breaking any laws doing this right now.
[40:06.000 --> 40:07.000]  But this is why they hate us.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  Let's go to some of this video and I may not even be able to come back in the next segment.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  I've got to get ready for this and I've got to, this is just coming in too fast.
[40:15.000 --> 40:16.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[40:16.000 --> 40:20.000]  If you're listening to us on local affiliates, spread the word, infowars.com.
[40:20.000 --> 40:24.000]  We need to probably change the headlines on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter that, you know,
[40:24.000 --> 40:29.000]  not that I'm going to break the contents of the FISA memo, but we are breaking it right now.
[40:29.000 --> 40:30.000]  Again, we deliver.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  We need your prayers, folks.
[40:31.000 --> 40:34.000]  Let's go out to break with some of these demonic-like people.
[40:34.000 --> 40:35.000]  Here it is.
[40:35.000 --> 40:56.000]  Hi, yes, horror power.
[40:56.000 --> 41:00.000]  We're out here representing sex workers and equal rights for them because a lot of the
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  time they're excluded from these.
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  And our jobs are just as important and justice-valid as everybody else's.
[41:07.000 --> 41:14.000]  So power to the whores, power to every woman, trans, women of color, all of us are together
[41:14.000 --> 41:15.000]  out here.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  So is being a whore empowering for women?
[41:18.000 --> 41:19.000]  For some women it is.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  And for the ones that it is not, that's their decision.
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  And for the ones that it is, we're so often vilified by society that we have to work just
[41:28.000 --> 41:33.000]  as any other marginalized group to be recognized as having autonomy over our own body.
[41:33.000 --> 41:38.000]  And that's like super offensive to a lot of the people in society.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  This is amazing.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  So they're chanting, lock him up.
[41:41.000 --> 41:45.000]  Here's the funny thing, if they lock Trump up, the economy would crash, the stock market
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  would crash, the borders would be wide open, and America would become a third world nation.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  And that's what they want.
[41:52.000 --> 41:53.000]  That's what they want.
[41:53.000 --> 41:54.000]  It's incredible.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  You realize they're an idiot, right?
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.000]  What did I say that's wrong, sir?
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  I don't really care what you said that's wrong.
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  My point is that you're an idiot.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  So you have no facts to base your statement?
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  That's absolutely not what I said.
[42:05.000 --> 42:06.000]  You're distorting an info board.
[42:06.000 --> 42:07.000]  You suck.
[42:07.000 --> 42:10.000]  You called me an idiot for no reason.
[42:10.000 --> 42:11.000]  There he goes.
[42:11.000 --> 42:12.000]  There he goes.
[42:12.000 --> 42:13.000]  Yeah, there I go.
[42:13.000 --> 42:14.000]  There he goes.
[42:14.000 --> 42:15.000]  There he goes.
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  I'm not going to do anything.
[42:16.000 --> 42:17.000]  Of course.
[42:17.000 --> 42:18.000]  Because you're a coward.
[42:18.000 --> 42:19.000]  Weren't you about to run away?
[42:19.000 --> 42:22.000]  No, I was about to leave because I really felt like listening to assholes like you.
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.000]  You want to put that on the air, put that on the air.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.000]  We'll do.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  We'll do.
[42:27.000 --> 42:28.000]  Thank you for that content.
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.000]  Don't worry, son.
[42:29.000 --> 42:30.000]  You can do better than your father.
[42:30.000 --> 42:31.000]  How's this?
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Is he in a fart?
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  You farted at me?
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  You farted at me?
[42:37.000 --> 42:38.000]  Oh my God.
[42:38.000 --> 43:04.000]  Yeah, it's what's going on.
[43:04.000 --> 43:30.000]  What's going on?
[43:30.000 --> 43:56.000]  What's going on?
[43:56.000 --> 44:22.000]  What's going on?
[44:22.000 --> 44:50.000]  What's going on?
[44:50.000 --> 45:16.000]  What's going on?
[45:16.000 --> 45:42.000]  What's going on?
[45:42.000 --> 46:08.000]  What's going on?
[46:08.000 --> 46:34.000]  What's going on?
[46:34.000 --> 47:01.000]  What's going on?
[47:01.000 --> 47:30.000]  What's going on?
[47:30.000 --> 47:49.000]  What's going on?
[47:49.000 --> 48:18.000]  What's going on?

[49:10.000 --> 49:36.000]  What's going on?
[49:36.000 --> 50:02.000]  What's going on?
[50:02.000 --> 50:28.000]  What's going on?
[50:28.000 --> 50:57.000]  What's going on?
[50:57.000 --> 51:24.000]  What's going on?
[51:24.000 --> 51:50.000]  What's going on?
[51:50.000 --> 52:17.000]  What's going on?
[52:17.000 --> 52:44.000]  What's going on?
[52:44.000 --> 53:08.000]  What's going on?
[53:08.000 --> 53:28.000]  What's going on?
[53:28.000 --> 53:52.000]  What's going on?
[53:52.000 --> 54:18.000]  What's going on?
[54:18.000 --> 54:44.000]  What's going on?
[54:44.000 --> 55:10.000]  What's going on?
[55:10.000 --> 55:36.000]  What's going on?
[55:36.000 --> 56:01.000]  What's going on?
[56:01.000 --> 56:27.000]  What's going on?
[56:27.000 --> 56:53.000]  What's going on?
[56:53.000 --> 57:19.000]  What's going on?
[57:19.000 --> 57:47.000]  What's going on?
[57:47.000 --> 58:14.000]  What's going on?
[58:14.000 --> 58:40.000]  What's going on?
[58:40.000 --> 59:06.000]  What's going on?
[59:06.000 --> 59:35.000]  What's going on?
[59:35.000 --> 59:58.000]  What's going on?
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  What's going on?
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  What's going on?
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  What's going on?
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  What's going on?
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  What's going on?
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:35.000]  What's going on?
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  What's going on?
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  What's going on?
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  What's going on?
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  What's going on?
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  What's going on?
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  What's going on?
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  What's going on?
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  What's going on?

[03:05:44.000 --> 03:06:12.000]  What's going on?
[03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:30.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, in the last 24 hours on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, we have seen them not let us share our videos, unsubscribe people by the thousands, not let us have tweets even reach people that are signed up to see them.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:46.000]  We've seen more censorship the last 24 hours and we saw the last two years combined. They have dropped the hammer. And Paul Watson and thousands of others are now reporting, they're getting messages saying, you promoted the tax cuts or you promoted Trump going to Davos.
[03:06:46.000 --> 03:07:04.000]  You are a Russian bot. We have evidence, including thousands of new accounts that weren't even around in the election. It's now Russian bots, even though Twitter admitted to Congress, all the Russian bots for the entire campaign were not the equivalent of what Paul Watson got at prison planted on Twitter in one month.
[03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  Congressional reports, CIA reports admit it's nonexistent. The Russians can't even run their own country. The Chinese run our universities, our media they've taken over.
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  But, but this is insane. So this is their new push with Congressman Schiff sending out letters to Twitter saying anyone talking about release the memo.
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:35.000]  And we have the redacted parts that who knows is going to release the memos public info wars.com. No one pointed it out. We did. We broke the memo. We pointed it out. They're trying to spend that.
[03:07:35.000 --> 03:07:45.000]  This is next level. They are so damn scared of this memo because it admits they're illegally spying on Trump and his whole family in the declassified version released by the head of National Intelligence.
[03:07:45.000 --> 03:07:49.000]  Paul, we they are collapsing. Paul, recap this.
[03:07:49.000 --> 03:08:04.000]  They're terrified. And we've got internal conversations from Facebook as well, by the way, which I put up on info wars earlier today where they're concerned about bright bought an info wars gaming Facebook's new algorithm. So we appear more in people's feeds.
[03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:15.000]  Facebook was caught gaming their own algorithm. It's all this gaming that's aimed at us and we're part of the Russian troll network. They game themselves on a regular basis to bury content they don't like.
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  That's what it's all about. But now Twitter. Now you can get a headline up which is Newsweek Trump supporters are angry after warnings from Twitter about Russian interference. They sent out 677,000 emails to all these pro Trump accounts, some of which we're not even started until the
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:47.000]  next you're going to be arrested, saying that they identified and suspended a number of accounts that were potentially connected to a propaganda effort by a Russian government linked organization known as the Internet Research Agency,
[03:08:47.000 --> 03:08:54.000]  which is the same agency that got 280 million impressions on Twitter during the whole election cycle, which is pathetic.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:09:03.000]  I got more than that in one month, just my one account, not including all the other accounts that are way bigger than mine. You know, they did. They tried to pull the same stunt with Brexit Alex.
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:16.000]  You actually had MPs get up in Parliament and say that Russian box stole Brexit. It was a big study. Russian linked accounts spent less than $1 on Brexit ads less than $1.
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:32.000]  You know, with Facebook, you have to spend like $1,000 to get anywhere. They spent less than $1. Again, complete baloney. And now they're saying that Trump, all Trump supporters are just Russian agents because they may have liked or retweeted these accounts, which we don't know.
[03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:40.000]  This is how they're Russian bots. This is how outside globalist powers that have hijacked our nations pointed us the Patriots and say we're the enemy and come after us.
[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:52.000]  I mean, this is it, Paul. They're really doing it. But what's going to happen now? This is all blowing up in their face and the whole thing's falling apart and they've been caught in secret societies at the FBI to remove the president.
[03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:54.000]  What are they going to do now?
[03:09:54.000 --> 03:10:14.000]  Well, I mean, the whole Muller thing is completely collapsing. Even this agent, I'm not sure of the pronunciation, but Peter Schrock, the one with the five months of missing text messages, they've got one of the messages from him. Or even he says there's no evidence of Russia-Trump collusion like the day after the investigation began.
[03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:18.000]  So even in their own internal text messages, they admitted them to themselves.
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  And let's be clear. If we release a U.S. government secret court memo, which has now been released redacted. Nunes has the four pages of redactions. That's Russian.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  So our own court report at infowars.com that no one will report on. That's Russian. Our own files of courts Russian. Did you know that, Paul?
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  It's all just every single thing they go to it as an excuse to distract from the fact that our narratives being completely demolished. They're using this guideline, which is up on Twitter. Let's get it up on infowars.
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  GMF is the organization. It monitors the activities of 600 Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence efforts online, one of which apparently is mine. Accounts were selected for their clear connection. Listen to that. Clear connection to Russian influence.
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:16.000]  But not all of these. Kind of like the congressional hearings and go, Paul Watson's number one today. We banned him at lunch. Talking about how it was an Islamic attack in New York with a truck. They said that was fake. It was completely admitted.
[03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:22.000]  Paul Watson says the sky is blue. Don't worry, sir. Congressman Quigley. We banned him at lunch.
[03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  And so it defines what makes you a Russian bot. And it's accounts controlled by Russian government influence operations. It's also accounts for patriotic pro-Russia users that are loosely connected or unconnected to the Russian government.
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  But it's also users who may or may not understand themselves to be part of the pro-Russian social networks.
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:52.000]  I didn't know I was a Russian agent because I wanted to take care of the military and old people and secure our borders and take our jobs back from China. Those damn Russians.
[03:11:52.000 --> 03:12:07.000]  So any Twitter account that maybe they support the tax cuts or whatever and they say they're a Russian bot. If you at any point liked or retweeted them, that also makes you a Russian bot. And you didn't have to know anything about it. They're now all putting us on this list.
[03:12:07.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  If I have another baby then, should I name it Russian bot? I mean, is that a Russian baby?
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  I think that's the way it's heading right now. But I mean, I went back and found the quote from the Daily Beast, which is when they had the big hysteria over Twitter and Russian influence on Twitter.
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  And here it is. Right before the election, some 36,000 bots on Twitter aimed 1.4 million election-relevant tweets that received 288 million impressions from fellow tweeters. So again, it was less than I got in one month and that's their entire operation.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  Again, Hillary fake polls, fake questions, everything rigged, Hollywood, the Vatican, the EU, Mexico, the Communist Chinese, Saudi Arabia, the whole world against America. None of that counts. It's the magical. I'm ready for some of this Russian money, Paul, because you know we're funding ourselves.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  I haven't gotten Jack Diddley squat from the Russians.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:13.000]  I'm still waiting for my check from the Kremlin. But of course, the Aryan is, when Hillary thought she was going to win, Trump suggested that, you know, we'd have to look at the election results for any kind of shenanigans.
[03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:25.000]  Oh my God, how dare he even suggest the election would be rigged. That's a direct attack on our democracy. What happens the very day, the very day after Trump wins? Oh, it was rigged. And they've been on this same narrative for a year.
[03:13:25.000 --> 03:13:38.000]  Let me ask you this. So they are losing now and I don't just put things on a nice pose to like just be positive like they do in line. We're really wanting right now. What are they going to do when they start getting indicted and all this comes out?
[03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:50.000]  I mean, because they're just Silicon Valley, they're all just committed while they own slave shops in China, the worst dirt bags ever just virtue settling that they're liberal or they're monstrous Nazis.
[03:13:50.000 --> 03:14:00.000]  What are they going to do when they all fail? Because we can't just be nice now and not indict these people. We got to go after everybody. Bezos, all of them. And these are enemies.
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  They're panicking at the moment, Alex, which is why they came out with this, you know, the fake news narrative completely failed. They did a Stanford University investigation found the biggest fake news stories helped Hillary Clinton.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  And the overarching analysis of it had no actual major Hollywood crimes created thousands of fake websites pushing fake Trump news.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:31.000]  Yeah, they also created this narrative called the post truth world, which is basically them saying, damn, our narratives being challenged for the first time ever. We're actually losing the argument.
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  Let's just create this idea that suddenly the truth no longer exists. Now, people are challenging your globalist crap for the first time in decades. And now they're starting to panic.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:57.000]  Now you've got proposals and we've covered this before, Alex, like with the China credit score. They want to link Twitter accounts, Facebook accounts to government issued identity cards, which obviously would make people less likely to criticize the government or to have any kind of controversial.
[03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  Sure, they're going to say you go in a literal gulag like Matt Drubb said. If you don't play ball, listen, we got pointed out by William Benny that the actual FISA memo they're talking about 90 plus percent of it was posted.
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:17.000]  We put it out. Nobody covered it. They don't they don't say it's a fake memo. It's full of bombshells. They just try to say, oh, but it's not the classified parts. Yeah.
[03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:28.000]  But we've already told you reverse engineered what's in those documents. And I'm going to shoot a special video. Paul's going to take over right now. I'm going to shoot a special video where I lay all that out coming up.
[03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:44.000]  If Paul finishes up today, look for that at info wars.com.

They are your body's cellular engines. Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul.
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:28.000]  Because when your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:41.000]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful available on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.

[03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:25.000]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:25.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  So, on the Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, January 23rd edition, let's wrap up what we were talking about before the break because this has broke in the past couple of hours.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:21:05.000]  So, here's what we're talking about.
[03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:16.000]  Now, exactly what evidence constitutes Kremlin-linked activity, we don't know because none whatsoever is presented.
[03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:36.000]  So, instead of releasing the memo, which is what the American people want, the polls show, they're going to block hashtag release the memo trending on Twitter again, presumably.
[03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:47.000]  It says if these reports are accurate, which we don't know if they're accurate or not because there's no evidence whatsoever of it, we're witnessing an ongoing attack by the Russian government through Kremlin-linked social media actors,
[03:21:47.000 --> 03:21:51.000]  directly acting to intervene and influence our democratic process.
[03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  Now, when they say Kremlin-linked social media actors, we'll get on in a minute to exactly who that is.
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:02.000]  Basically, it's anyone who supports Trump is a Kremlin-linked social media actor at this point.
[03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  The letter goes on to state, this should be disconcerting to all Americans, but especially your companies, as once again, it appears the vast majority of their efforts concentrated on your platforms.
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:17.000]  Again, they're trying to bait Twitter and Facebook into following this hysteria.
[03:22:17.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  So, they take even more egregious censorship methods, even more egregious than those exposed by Project Veritas only last week, to censor Trump supporters, to censor conservatives, even within the highly controlled and fought police echo chamber that Twitter already is.
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:49.000]  We saw them try to create a similar hysteria with YouTube last year with the adpocalypse, so they restricted, they censored. Now, we're seeing it once again through Adam Schiff, who has been completely decimated and debunked on his Russian hysteria,
[03:22:49.000 --> 03:22:52.000]  innumerable times over the past year.
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:23:06.000]  It goes on to say this latest example of Russian interference, again, no evidence presented for it, is in keeping with Moscow's concerted covert and continuing campaigns to manipulate American public opinion and erode trust in our law enforcement and intelligence institutions.
[03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:21.000]  These are the same people who defend people like this Peter Schrock, obviously hyper parties and bias abusing their power, but then they say, oh, the Russians, the mythical Russian bots are the ones eroding trust in law enforcement.
[03:23:21.000 --> 03:23:28.000]  You won't even release the damn memo. Who's eroding trust here? It's not your mythical Russian bots.
[03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:36.000]  The memo in question was written by the House Intelligence Committee about alleged surveillance abuses, and again, it remains to be seen whether it will be released.
[03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:48.000]  But along with this, this guideline emerged, which is what they're going from, what Schiff and the others are going from in their hysteria, as to how to identify the mythical Russian bots.
[03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:57.000]  This was from the organization GMF. It said the dashboard monitors the activities of 600 Twitter accounts linked to Russian influence efforts online.
[03:23:57.000 --> 03:24:06.000]  Accounts were selected for their clear connection. Listen to that. Clear connection to Russian influence, but not all of the accounts are directly controlled by Russia.
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:15.000]  What constitutes a clear connection to Russian influence? Basically anything pro-Trump, basically anything anti-the Democratic Party.
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:23.000]  What a convenience that is. The method is focused on understanding the behavior of the aggregate network rather than the behavior of individual users.
[03:24:23.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  So they go on to list people who are directly working for the Russian government, those that are patriotic pro-Russia users that are loosely connected or unconnected to the Russian government.
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:43.000]  This is their Russian bot network. They also list users who may or may not understand themselves to be part of a pro-Russian social network.
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  So you may not even know that you're in this Russian troll bot army and yet you are. Why? Because you have certain opinions which aren't very convenient to those in positions of power,
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:02.000]  to those in the deep state who are trying to sabotage the Trump administration. So you're part of the Russian bot network.
[03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  Now people are sending me messages saying they received one of these emails from Twitter over the past 48 hours. They've sent out 677,000 plus emails to Twitter users,
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:25.000]  almost all of whom are Trump supporters, you would imagine, saying you have liked or retweeted or in some way interacted with a Russian bot trying to undermine American democracy.
[03:25:25.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  Again, it's partly a threat. Somebody sent me a message which said I received an email from Twitter saying I had followed and or liked content from a Russian government-linked organization during the 2016 election.
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  That account was yours. So I'm part of the Russian government-linked organization that undermined the US election. Obviously, I don't know about it, but that's okay because they've made that part of the definition.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:26:08.000]  You may not even know. He also said he followed real Donald Trump and POTUS. So maybe the actual official real Donald Trump account is also part of this Russian troll bot network because at this point it's just anybody who shared anything that is pro-Trump at any point.
[03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:22.000]  Newsweek reports Trump supporters are angry after warnings from Twitter about Russian interference through trolls. Trump supporters in a popular forum on the social media platform Reddit, which is presumably the Donald, have shared their anger about alerts
[03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  and Twitter last week warning their accounts had engaged with or spread the messages of a network of accounts linked to Russian bots believed to have spread 2016 election propaganda.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:44.000]  Now they cite one example in here, which I think it's in this article that I read earlier. Here it is. One individual said he got an email from Twitter accusing me of linking to Russian accounts and retweeting stuff during the election.
[03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:53.000]  This was a user-called analog device, complaining that this was impossible because their Twitter account was opened in the summer of 2017.
[03:26:53.000 --> 03:27:07.000]  So how on earth could he have helped spread Russian propaganda during the 2016 election when he wasn't even on Twitter until nearly a year later? Again, complete bologna. It's all BS, but it never ends.
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:19.000]  The social media platform sent 677,000 people in the United States these emails and basically said you're in cahoots with the evil Russians.
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:28.000]  Now we flash back to this article. Facebook Russian linked accounts spent less than $1 on Brexit ads because they tried to pull this same stunt after Brexit.
[03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:40.000]  They actually got MPs who stood up in parliament and said that Brexit was a Russian troll operation. You know, you had actual troll bots going into the voting booth and voting for Brexit, I imagine.
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:54.000]  But they did an investigation and it turned out that less than $1 was spent by supposed Russian-based operatives to place three advertisements on Facebook in the run-up to Britain's 2016 referendum.
[03:27:54.000 --> 03:28:10.000]  They spent 97 cents to raise the issue of immigration. It wasn't even directly related to Brexit until they spent less than a dollar and yet people were getting up in parliament saying that Brexit was a Russian plot.
[03:28:10.000 --> 03:28:29.000]  Again, complete hysteria. No evidence has ever been presented for this. Are there fake news websites? Are there Russian bots? Yes. But do they have anywhere near the kind of influence that these Schiff and the others and Feinstein are trying to convince us that they do?
[03:28:29.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  It's complete fake news. It's the very essence of fake news. It's hysteria to distract from the details within this memo that they don't want the American people to see.
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:29:00.000]  If you'd like to know more on the Alex Jones show after the break, info was dot com. Go away.

[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:54.000]  That is also available at info wars store.com.
[03:35:54.000 --> 03:36:00.000]  Before we get back into the global news, I just want to mention this because it came out about an hour ago up on Daily Caller.
[03:36:00.000 --> 03:36:13.000]  Even Peter Strock, this guy who skimmed at the top of the FBI, you know, he was the one who came out with the insurance policy in case Donald Trump won, which of course was the Russian hysteria investigation.
[03:36:13.000 --> 03:36:19.000]  Headline is in jaw dropping text. Peter Strock expressed concern about joining Mueller team.
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:30.000]  The FBI's top agent on the Trump Russian investigation sent a text message last year that one top Republican senator says suggests he saw no evidence of Trump campaign collusion.
[03:36:30.000 --> 03:36:47.000]  So even the guy who all this controversy swirls around now as being of course hyperpartisan and bias, because he hated Trump as has been proven over and over again, even he thought there was no evidence of Russian collusion right back when the investigation began.
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:58.000]  The text message is quote jaw dropping Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said in a radio interview today.
[03:36:58.000 --> 03:37:18.000]  He read aloud a May 19 to 2017 text that struck center Lisa Page and FBI lawyer and his mistress. He said quote, you and I both know the odds are nothing. If I thought it was likely I'd be there. No question. I hesitate in part because of my gut sense and concern that there's no big there there.
[03:37:18.000 --> 03:37:31.000]  So he's referring to the Mueller investigation which had kicked off just two days earlier. So even him thinks that it's a complete baloney boss. And yet here we still are today.
[03:37:31.000 --> 03:37:36.000]  Having to deal with it having to rebut this narrative over and over again.
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:52.000]  With of course now as I mentioned before the break Adam Schiff and Diane Feinstein basically claiming that anyone who circulated the hashtag release the memo campaign anyone who helped get it trend as part of a Russian troll army bot network had nothing to do with the fact that you had
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:38:09.000]  it. Congressman all over the media for like two three day solid talking about it. That's not why it trended on Twitter. No, it was those mysterious Russian bots once again. Isn't that convenient because then they can use that as an excuse to distract from the content of the actual
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:24.000]  site as a memo. Again, relying on the convenience of this Russian bot hysteria to distract from their own scandals from their own corruption over and over again. This is an article up on him for was dot com right now.
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  Sweden, my favorite country feminist mother refuses to report Afghan refugee after he sexually abuses her 12 year old daughter. Now this was supposedly an 18 year old as we know from Sweden. They did a big study the official government forensic
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  bureau did a study and found that three quarters of so called child refugees were not children. They were adults. Now feminist mother in Sweden refused to report an Afghan refugee who was living in a house to authorities after he sexually abused her 12 year old daughter.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:39:10.000]  She put the sanctum any she put her concern for this Afghan refugee above concern for the safety of her own child. That's how intense the brainwashing the indoctrination the reeducation is at this point in time in Sweden.
[03:39:10.000 --> 03:39:28.000]  The 45 year old woman was working at a refugee center in Salzburg when she began having a sexual relationship with the refugee who claimed to be 18 years old. Of course, we've seen numerous cases before, especially at the Calais migrant camp, which was supposedly bulldozed but is basically coming back into place right
[03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:44.000]  now of these refugee workers having sex with migrants. I mean, that's that's that's what they're into. That's probably part of the reason why they want to get the job in the first place. Now this woman began a sexual relationship with a refugee was 18 years old.
[03:39:44.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  He was about to become official. So he had to leave this refugee center and she allowed him to move into her family home. She was divorced, but she had kids. This this 12 year old girl had some big sisters as well.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:14.000]  And surprise, surprise within a short period of time, the migrant began sexually abusing the woman's 12 year old daughter kissing and hugging her before one incident in September 2017 when the Afghan put his hands inside the girls underwear and broke her vagina.
[03:40:14.000 --> 03:40:31.000]  So the German propaganda, the public television network, because this is in my video last week, but they showed a relationship between obviously an adult Syrian migrant probably in his 30s and a 60 16 year old girl again portraying it as natural normal.
[03:40:31.000 --> 03:40:45.000]  And this happening is in Sweden. So the daughter, the 12 year old obviously complained to her mother that she was being sexually harassed, sexually assaulted by this Afghan migrant. And the mother did absolutely nothing.
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:58.000]  She didn't report into authority. She didn't even kick him out of the house. It wasn't until the girl refused to come home from school and then told her father is divorced from the mother that this had taken place.
[03:40:58.000 --> 03:41:04.000]  The big sisters also knew about it. And they were told by the mother to shut up.
[03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:12.000]  She said, quote, when he went to trial, I'll tell you what happened in the trial. She said, quote, I thought so much about him that he could stay with me.
[03:41:12.000 --> 03:41:23.000]  She was also reportedly a vehement supporter of the me to movement against the sexual assault of women, of course she was, but not presumably if those women are sexually assaulted by migrants.
[03:41:23.000 --> 03:41:35.000]  Remember what happened in Cologne after the mass mobilization of women on New Year's Eve 2015. The very next day, the feminists all went down to the local migrant center to hand out roses.
[03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:47.000]  So it went to trial. The Afghan received just 100 hours of community service for the assault and will not be deported because this is Sweden and it's gone completely insane.
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:59.000]  He claimed to 18 chances are he was an adult given three quarters of so called child migrants are adults in Sweden, their own national forensic medicine agency confirm that.
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:12.000]  And of course we had the figures released from the official criminal statistics agency bra last week that show rape cases across the country is already the rape capital of Europe increased 10% in 2017.
[03:42:12.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  So Sweden continues to enjoy the benefits of cultural enrichment and now so called feminist mothers are placing their concern for Afghan migrants over the safety of their own daughters.
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  That's how intense the brainwashing the propaganda, the reeducation has become in Scandinavia.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:42.000]  Where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may be hiding after the break because the leader of ISIS take one guess as to where that could be.
[03:42:42.000 --> 03:42:52.000]  We'll be back after the break. This is the Alex Jones show live breaking news at info wars dot com.
[03:42:52.000 --> 03:43:03.000]  I'm so excited the new product in info wars life.com in a glass bottle, two months servings filled to the brim filled to the absolute top, the real red bill.
[03:43:03.000 --> 03:43:09.000]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:43:09.000 --> 03:43:12.000]  But boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:24.000]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people 100 $200 for the formulae.
[03:43:24.000 --> 03:43:33.000]  And I came up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers non GMO made right here in America 120 capsules.
[03:43:33.000 --> 03:43:42.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglin own to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones in your glands.
[03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:52.000]  It is amazing. Red pill now available at info wars store.com and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:43:52.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from info wars life.com.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:00.000]  But instead of going on those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[03:44:00.000 --> 03:44:05.000]  From all the wives tales and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence.
[03:44:05.000 --> 03:44:08.000]  We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[03:44:08.000 --> 03:44:12.000]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works.
[03:44:12.000 --> 03:44:25.000]  And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.

[03:44:52.000 --> 03:44:56.000]  Info wars wife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:44:56.000 --> 03:45:08.000]  We have found extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory health and normal breathing.
[03:45:08.000 --> 03:45:10.000]  This is pollen blood.
[03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  In 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes and excessive mucus production.
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:27.000]  They began studying the effects in public trials, in their public trials.
[03:45:27.000 --> 03:45:41.000]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research of fast-acting chewable tablets, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[03:45:41.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now at infowarslife.com or by calling toll 3.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:46:00.000]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic.

[03:46:26.000 --> 03:46:33.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.

[03:47:12.000 --> 03:47:28.000]  There's a headline up on the independent website and it's possible they've changed it by now because it's completely libelous.
[03:47:28.000 --> 03:47:34.000]  Tommy Robinson who of course has been a guest on this program many times before is in the news today.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:46.000]  It came out in the trial of the individual at the Finsbury Park attacker because you remember that Darren Osborne drove a vehicle into a crowd of Muslims back in June last year.
[03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:51.000]  Terrorist attack, we called it terrorist attack at the time but now it's gone to trial.
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:48:06.000]  They came out today mass media, numerous publications and claimed that Tommy Robinson had sent in some cases direct Twitter messages, direct messages to the terrorists involved in the attack.
[03:48:06.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  In fact I tweeted one of these earlier, the Metro which is the biggest newspaper in Britain in terms of sales, it's tracking about the same as the Sun.
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:21.000]  They tweeted this, Finsbury Park attacker got Twitter DMs from Tommy Robinson days before attack.
[03:48:21.000 --> 03:48:33.000]  So essentially they're claiming that Tommy Robinson directly contacted a terrorist and the obvious implication is that he inspired this terrorist to carry out the attack which killed one person.
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:48.000]  Absolutely incredible libel, it came out that what had happened was this terrorist way before that had subscribed to a mailing list which at one point had sent out content, video content from Tommy Robinson.
[03:48:48.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  So that's the difference between being a member of a mailing list and being in direct contact with an individual via Twitter DM.
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:49:05.000]  Two completely different things yet they're using this to smear Tommy Robinson and to claim or to imply at least that he somehow inspired this terrorist attack.
[03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  They're still doing it even though it's been out for about six hours that the guy was subscribed to a mailing list, not that he was in direct contact.
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:21.000]  They see how the independent Finsbury Park terrorist suspect read messages from Tommy Robinson days before attack.
[03:49:21.000 --> 03:49:30.000]  Now what they initially claimed in effect, I've got the original headline which they've changed because they're getting bombarded with people saying this is clearly libelous.
[03:49:30.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  Their original headline was this because I copied and pasted it into this text file.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:42.000]  Tommy Robinson sent messages to Finsbury Park terrorist suspect days before attack court hears.
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  Now even in this article, which is again completely misleading fake news libelous headline, even in the article, this author admitted, quote, Mr. Robinson's message which was identical to that sent to other supporters.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:03.000]  So what's what's a message that's also sent to others? Well, it's a mailing list.
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:11.000]  Completely different thing from the claim that Robinson directly sent Twitter direct messages to a terrorist.
[03:50:11.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  They're still publishing articles. The Metro still got this tweet up.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  Hours later, six hours later, it was completely clarified that this was a mailing list.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:29.000]  Again, shows you the mainstream media while claiming that where fake news will peddle the most damaging fake news that could put people at risk.
[03:50:29.000 --> 03:50:33.000]  It could actually put Robinson at risk. It's definitely defamed his character.
[03:50:33.000 --> 03:50:38.000]  They'll do it on a whim. They'll do it every single day and they'll feel good about it.
[03:50:38.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  Absolutely incredible that it's still happening as we speak, even though it's hours after it's being clarified.
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:51.000]  But being on a mailing list is completely different from actually directly communicating with someone.
[03:50:51.000 --> 03:50:57.000]  Zero Hedge reports German city bans all new refugees as violent crime spikes.
[03:50:57.000 --> 03:51:07.000]  One small German city start turning away new refugees amid an explosion of violence between the newcomers and a burgeoning and illegal neo-Nazi group that's taken root in the city.
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:14.000]  So again, this is the problem I took about. If you allow these policies to really flourish and enrich these different parts of Germany,
[03:51:14.000 --> 03:51:19.000]  where in some cases they have tiny little villages of like 50 people and then they suddenly now,
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:23.000]  so by the way, 2,000 refugees are coming to stay in your village.
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:25.000]  But don't worry, nothing's going to change.
[03:51:25.000 --> 03:51:32.000]  If you allow that kind of insanity to go on, you're going to bolster actual far-right extremists because people get desperate.
[03:51:32.000 --> 03:51:39.000]  If they're the only people who are listening to them, then obviously membership of those far-right extremist organizations is going to rise.
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:46.000]  If they're treated like absolute crap by their own government and told to shut up and just take it as their towns and villages are overrun,
[03:51:46.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  as crime, as rape, as sexual assault explodes.
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:52:00.000]  Officials in the city of Cottbus, located about 120 kilometers, has been plagued by a surge of attacks from refugees and right-wing extremists since the beginning of the year.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:08.000]  According to Fox News, Brandenburg State Police said two Syrian teenage boys were arrested and there's the suspicion of injuring a German teenager in the face with a knife last week.
[03:52:08.000 --> 03:52:11.000]  So it goes through all the different cases of crime.
[03:52:11.000 --> 03:52:20.000]  Basically, they were able to attribute a 10.4% rise in violent crimes in the state during those two years exclusively or almost exclusively to refugees.
[03:52:20.000 --> 03:52:33.000]  After the study, they basically said, we're not taking any more. The Interior Minister Carl Heinz Schrotter told the mail that the ban on new refugees would be in effect for the next few months.
[03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:37.000]  So initially, it's going to be a few months and it may be longer than that.
[03:52:37.000 --> 03:52:42.000]  They've had enough of it there saying, no, mention this before the break.
[03:52:42.000 --> 03:52:51.000]  The ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is hiding or could be hiding in a European country in a Scandinavian country.
[03:52:51.000 --> 03:52:56.000]  Now, take a wild guess as to which Scandinavian country that may be.
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:53:06.000]  And it's Sweden. According to sources The Guardian has talked to, top ISIS leaders including Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have fled Syria and could now be hiding in Scandinavia.
[03:53:06.000 --> 03:53:13.000]  And if that is the case, then liberal Sweden, where the ID checks are an absolute joke out of control is certainly the most obvious choice.
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:20.000]  Also, as it seems likely the first European country to soon resemble the war zone, they just left.
[03:53:20.000 --> 03:53:29.000]  And of course, that's in reference to the Swedish Prime Minister coming out a few days ago and saying that basically they're considering, or they would at least consider if it was proposed,
[03:53:29.000 --> 03:53:37.000]  putting the army on the streets of Sweden because it's so safe, it's so calm, it's so tranquil, grenade attacks, sexual assaults.
[03:53:37.000 --> 03:53:46.000]  You've got the police having to install microphones in some of these no-go Muslim ghettos to pick up the screams of women because they can't have enough police.
[03:53:46.000 --> 03:53:52.000]  And when they do have police, they get attacked. The police stations basically are fortress in Malmo now.
[03:53:52.000 --> 03:53:56.000]  They can't even have windows on these places because they get attacked, they get burned down.
[03:53:56.000 --> 03:54:07.000]  You've seen police stations bombed, you've seen riots, you've seen cars set ablaze, you've seen the ambulance workers, the fire workers getting attacked in these migrant ghettos.
[03:54:07.000 --> 03:54:14.000]  To all intents and purposes, at least in these concentrated pockets, it does indeed resemble a war zone.
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:26.000]  And now they're speculating that Baghdadi himself, the leader of ISIS, could have returned what is essentially now his spiritual home of Sweden.
[03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:34.000]  Mention this when I was on with Alex. This is out of Breitbart. Health Minister's social media accounts should be linked to government-issued identity cards.
[03:54:34.000 --> 03:54:42.000]  Where have we seen this before? Well, we've seen it with the EU, tried to pull it off, and we've of course seen it with China and their social credit score.
[03:54:42.000 --> 03:54:50.000]  But the Irish Minister responsible for mental health has suggested that all public services cards be linked to social media accounts to verify users' identities.
[03:54:50.000 --> 03:55:03.000]  RTE News reports that Jim Daly, the Irish Minister responsible for mental health and older people, has recently called for all public services cards to be linked to the social media accounts of car users to verify their identity.
[03:55:03.000 --> 03:55:12.000]  Now, of course, we've seen this before, not just in China, but also with the European Union, or the European Commission, more specifically in 2016,
[03:55:12.000 --> 03:55:19.000]  which insisted that state-issued ID cards should be used to log into social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[03:55:19.000 --> 03:55:24.000]  Why would they do that? Well, one, it's to completely eviscerate anonymity on the Internet.
[03:55:24.000 --> 03:55:34.000]  And two, if you know that everything you post on the Internet is directly linked to a government ID card and maybe a social credit score,
[03:55:34.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  if we want to ape the communist Chinese system, maybe you will be less likely to criticize the government.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:46.000]  Maybe you will be less likely to leave offensive comments that might upset people on social media.
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:55:55.000]  So now, you should never tolerate a government ID being linked to your social media accounts. That's completely Orwellian. It's completely draconian.
[03:55:55.000 --> 03:55:59.000]  And it should never happen. Absolutely incredible.
[03:55:59.000 --> 03:56:05.000]  Davos, where, of course, Trump is about to visit, Indian Prime Minister says attacks on globalism must be stopped.
[03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  They are in complete panic mode.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:16.000]  Giving the opening speech at the World Economic Forum's Davos Summit on Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told global elites,
[03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:20.000]  the opposition to globalist policies is one of the world's foremost threats.
[03:56:20.000 --> 03:56:30.000]  Now, we had the big Davos elitist thing is last week come out and say that Trump poses a direct threat to the centralized globalist agenda
[03:56:30.000 --> 03:56:39.000]  that these guys have been putting together for decades, that that's basically going to be the entire subject of the summit in Switzerland this week.
[03:56:39.000 --> 03:56:43.000]  He said, quote, forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalization.
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:49.000]  Their intention is not only to avoid globalization themselves, but they also want to reverse its natural flow.
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:56:51.000]  Yeah, real natural, isn't it?
[03:56:51.000 --> 03:56:58.000]  Being driven solely by the whim, by the will of technocrats against the interests of the ordinary man.
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:01.000]  So they're really, really panicking about that.
[03:57:01.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  We've also got the social media censorship.
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:05.000]  We had this upon Infowars earlier.
[03:57:05.000 --> 03:57:16.000]  Facebook employee says, new trust algorithm will prevent Infowars and Breitbart gaming the system, which is pretty ironic given that Facebook in 2016 got all.
[03:57:16.000 --> 03:57:17.000]  Paul, I don't follow me in a rump.
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:21.000]  I just want you to know, Paul, you've done a great job coming up in 30 minutes.
[03:57:21.000 --> 03:57:28.000]  This is Jack Mesovic, Naval Intelligence, Great Connections, the White House. Our memo is real. Nunes has the redacted areas.
[03:57:28.000 --> 03:57:34.000]  And as we were told, it's a larger document showing the collusion and lies of the globalists.
[03:57:34.000 --> 03:57:36.000]  That's coming up in 30 minutes during the war room.
[03:57:36.000 --> 03:57:37.000]  Thank you for the great job, Paul.
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:42.000]  30 minutes from now, we're going to suss out the actual memo and detail straight ahead.
[03:57:42.000 --> 03:57:43.000]  Infowars.com.
[03:57:43.000 --> 03:57:52.000]  The new probiotic line developed exclusively by Infowars Life after years of research on the human microbiome. Not all probiotics are made the same.
[03:57:52.000 --> 03:58:01.000]  Floor life probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:04.000]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics.
[03:58:04.000 --> 03:58:09.000]  So if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[03:58:09.000 --> 03:58:16.000]  Floor life supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining and metabolism.
[03:58:16.000 --> 03:58:25.000]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[03:58:25.000 --> 03:58:33.000]  Floor life is sold as a 15 billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50 billion probiotic for a 30 day advanced gut restoration program.
[03:58:33.000 --> 03:58:40.000]  Head to InfowarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floor Life probiotics today. That's InfowarsLife.com.
