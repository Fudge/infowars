[00:00.000 --> 00:20.920]  You're going to draw the line, Chuck, how are you going to know?
[00:20.920 --> 00:21.920]  I'm asking you.
[00:21.920 --> 00:22.920]  I'm saying...
[00:22.920 --> 00:23.920]  Is that too high?
[00:23.920 --> 00:24.920]  Is that...
[00:24.920 --> 00:25.920]  You're okay with that margin for error?
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.920]  I have no problem as long as we achieve our objective, and our objective is to get
[00:27.920 --> 00:32.560]  the guys who did 9-11, and it is to avoid another attack against the United States.
[00:32.560 --> 00:34.680]  I was prepared, and we did.
[00:34.680 --> 00:38.600]  We got the authorization from the president and authorization from the Justice Department
[00:38.600 --> 00:39.960]  to go forward with the program.
[00:39.960 --> 00:40.960]  It worked.
[00:40.960 --> 00:43.080]  It worked now for 13 years.
[00:43.080 --> 00:46.840]  We've avoided another mass casualty attack against the United States, and we did capture
[00:46.840 --> 00:47.840]  Ben Laden.
[00:47.840 --> 00:51.440]  We did capture an awful lot of the senior guys of Al Qaeda who were responsible for that
[00:51.440 --> 00:52.440]  attack on 9-11.
[00:52.440 --> 00:56.960]  I'd do it again in a minute.
[00:56.960 --> 01:03.520]  And the Easter Bunny is real as well, and Dick Cheney is a conservative.
[01:03.520 --> 01:10.520]  I know the Neocon, Rhino, Republican media tells you 24-7 that George W. Bush and Dick
[01:10.520 --> 01:17.720]  Cheney are real conservatives, but that's like saying that a transvestite is really
[01:17.720 --> 01:23.440]  a woman, or that a pig dressed up in a tutu is really a woman.
[01:23.440 --> 01:26.560]  I mean, it's just not true, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26.560 --> 01:29.760]  It's a fraud.
[01:29.760 --> 01:31.800]  It's false.
[01:31.800 --> 01:32.800]  You know what?
[01:32.800 --> 01:34.920]  I just thought of something, because I've got all this important news to cover on this
[01:34.920 --> 01:42.840]  live Sunday edition, already the 14th of December, 2014.
[01:42.840 --> 01:44.560]  I thought, why don't I open the phones up?
[01:44.560 --> 01:49.160]  Because we're on a lot of conservative radio stations around the country that have everything
[01:49.160 --> 01:54.280]  from constitutionalists to mainline rhinos listening, and I hear you guys calling into
[01:54.280 --> 02:00.640]  talk radio, calling into affiliates I'm on, saying, we need to get tough.
[02:00.640 --> 02:01.640]  I like torture.
[02:01.640 --> 02:02.640]  It's good.
[02:02.640 --> 02:03.640]  Oh, yeah.
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.600]  We lose the moral high ground when we do that.
[02:07.600 --> 02:10.880]  Then you get into the fact that our government's been funding radical Islam and allowing it
[02:10.880 --> 02:13.880]  to grow and attack so they can take our liberties.
[02:13.880 --> 02:21.320]  But just at the basic level of you can't stoop down to somebody else's level and not become
[02:21.320 --> 02:22.320]  dirty.
[02:22.320 --> 02:26.240]  In fact, I saw ISIS, we guys reprint this.
[02:26.240 --> 02:33.920]  It was all over the news for Friday, you know, IS, Al Qaeda, you know, criticizes U.S. for
[02:33.920 --> 02:34.920]  torture report.
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.000]  I think they called us infidels, the words kafar or something.
[02:40.000 --> 02:45.200]  That's the group that tortures constantly and chops heads off and abuses little kids
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.760]  and stuff and kills them and forces people to suicide, bomb or they'll shoot their families.
[02:49.760 --> 02:53.160]  I just love that scum of the earth group.
[02:53.160 --> 02:55.400]  You don't get much scum here.
[02:55.400 --> 03:01.120]  It's not propaganda that radical lobbyists are just as bad as you can get.
[03:01.120 --> 03:06.760]  It's like an army of Charlie Mansons or something.
[03:06.760 --> 03:07.760]  I mean, they're nuts.
[03:07.760 --> 03:10.640]  Just look at their eyes and then look at the fruits of what they do.
[03:10.640 --> 03:14.200]  They are bad news.
[03:14.200 --> 03:20.000]  What the big megabanks hold their chain of financing and allow them to operate to menace
[03:20.000 --> 03:21.640]  the world and giving up our freedoms.
[03:21.640 --> 03:24.080]  And then they say, oh, let us torture them at Camp X-ray.
[03:24.080 --> 03:28.520]  They got a bunch of 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds there that were conscripted in Afghanistan
[03:28.520 --> 03:30.360]  and stuff and forced to fight.
[03:30.360 --> 03:33.800]  And then you turn around after eight, nine years of captivity, they end up being released
[03:33.800 --> 03:36.560]  to run ISIS brigades.
[03:36.560 --> 03:45.920]  You know why because it's on record their CIA, Mossad, Shembat, Turkish intelligence,
[03:45.920 --> 03:54.240]  Pakistani intelligence, double agents, they are produced in those torture facilities.
[03:54.240 --> 03:55.240]  They are prepared.
[03:55.240 --> 04:00.080]  They are broken just like Mandela was broken when he was a good guy or bad guy in 30-something
[04:00.080 --> 04:01.080]  years in prison.
[04:01.080 --> 04:07.400]  He came out run by the Major De Beers Oppenheimer interest to be the front man.
[04:07.400 --> 04:12.600]  Well, they take some 17-year-olds, some of them 14-years-old, put them in Camp X-ray.
[04:12.600 --> 04:16.480]  For some of them, they've been 10 years and then they're released and they just keep showing
[04:16.480 --> 04:19.400]  up commanding armies.
[04:19.400 --> 04:21.840]  They're cutouts, folks.
[04:21.840 --> 04:24.240]  They're cutouts.
[04:24.240 --> 04:29.160]  And if you look at how they would produce child soldiers in Africa, it was with torture.
[04:29.160 --> 04:35.080]  Africa has a formulae, African countries, African warlords, for this and the CIA has
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.920]  adopted it and it is despicable.
[04:37.920 --> 04:43.240]  So beyond torture, they're producing child soldiers, not just at X-ray.
[04:43.240 --> 04:45.400]  That's just the public promotion prison.
[04:45.400 --> 04:48.040]  They got over 100 black or ghost sites all over the world.
[04:48.040 --> 04:51.760]  We're going to break it all down and I'll put up the phones for people who want to come
[04:51.760 --> 04:54.840]  on and say how great all of this is.
[04:54.840 --> 04:57.240]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com.
[04:57.240 --> 04:59.240]  Stay with us.
[05:28.240 --> 05:29.920]  No needles, no injections.
[05:29.920 --> 05:35.720]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems and secret 12 is a fusion
[05:35.720 --> 05:41.960]  of two organic proprietary forms of vitamin B12 bringing you a true nutraceutical quality
[05:41.960 --> 05:43.460]  vitamin B12.
[05:43.460 --> 05:45.880]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift.
[05:45.880 --> 05:51.520]  Secure your secret 12 formula before December 17 at infowarslife.com and receive it before
[05:51.520 --> 05:52.520]  Christmas guarantee.
[05:52.520 --> 05:59.880]  That's infowarslife.com before December 17 or by calling 888-253-3139.
[05:59.880 --> 06:07.760]  As a community moves towards despotism, respect is restricted to fewer people.
[06:07.760 --> 06:13.640]  That's veteran Denver police officer Charles Jones IV smashing an unarmed suspect in the
[06:13.640 --> 06:17.200]  face six times.
[06:17.200 --> 06:21.080]  Officers accused of using excessive force on a suspect and then trying to erase the evidence
[06:21.080 --> 06:23.400]  as to how they're observing what they're doing in the room.
[06:23.400 --> 06:24.400]  Save me.
[06:24.400 --> 06:25.400]  I don't understand what's going on.
[06:25.400 --> 06:32.120]  A community rates low on an information scale when the press, radio and other channels
[06:32.120 --> 06:35.840]  of communication are controlled by only a few people.
[06:35.840 --> 06:39.600]  Does it raise ethical questions about the use of government money to produce stories
[06:39.600 --> 06:43.120]  about the government that wind up being aired with no disclosure that they were produced
[06:43.120 --> 06:44.120]  by the government?
[06:44.120 --> 06:46.120]  How time you ask for the question.
[06:46.120 --> 06:48.640]  What difference at this point does it make?
[06:48.640 --> 06:54.000]  When a competent observer looks for signs of despotism in the community, he looks beyond
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  fine words and noble phrases.
[06:56.000 --> 07:00.600]  There are actions I have the legal authority to take as president that will help make our
[07:00.600 --> 07:03.960]  immigration system more fair and more just.
[07:03.960 --> 07:06.760]  Tonight, I'm announcing those actions.
[07:06.760 --> 07:11.280]  What I say goes, see, I'm the law around here.
[07:11.280 --> 07:15.480]  You came, you saw, you died.
[07:15.480 --> 07:23.760]  Yes, a modern warfare, our military leaders are finding that words and ideas are highly
[07:23.760 --> 07:24.760]  effective weapons.
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.880]  You just have to be repetitive about this.
[07:26.880 --> 07:31.760]  We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking
[07:31.760 --> 07:34.320]  about guns in a vastly different way.
[07:34.320 --> 07:36.720]  We are trained to deceive if we have to.
[07:36.720 --> 07:38.200]  You really don't have to trust me.
[07:38.200 --> 07:39.200]  You shouldn't trust me.
[07:39.200 --> 07:43.040]  In fact, by my actually participating that, I will taint the news.
[07:43.040 --> 07:47.120]  In communities of this kind, despotism stands a good chance.
[07:47.120 --> 07:53.320]  The nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I'm from the government and
[07:53.320 --> 07:54.320]  I'm here to help.
[07:54.320 --> 07:55.320]  I'm kidding.
[07:55.320 --> 07:56.320]  It's huge.
[07:56.320 --> 07:59.320]  Well, we're going to do everything we can to help you.
[07:59.320 --> 08:03.600]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[08:03.600 --> 08:11.040]  It's the Alex Jones show because there is a war on your mind.
[08:11.040 --> 08:16.720]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lives and disinformation.
[08:16.720 --> 08:21.040]  We're live every Sunday, four to six p.m. central and back weekdays, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
[08:21.040 --> 08:22.040]  central.
[08:22.040 --> 08:25.080]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com are the major news sites.
[08:25.080 --> 08:29.320]  You can follow us on Twitter at real Alex Jones.
[08:29.320 --> 08:32.800]  Let me just calmly lay out the top stories today.
[08:32.800 --> 08:41.200]  Michael Phelan of infowars.com, police say armored military vehicles, quote, needed for
[08:41.200 --> 08:48.160]  war with constitutionalist, close quote, with firearms, quote, we've got a lot of constitutionalist,
[08:48.160 --> 08:54.920]  a lot of people that stockpile weapons that will, quote, be taking enemy fire from this
[08:54.920 --> 08:59.280]  out of a county in Washington state, the big MRAPS from Iraq.
[08:59.280 --> 09:00.400]  Now here's the issue.
[09:00.400 --> 09:04.720]  Big cities probably need things like this because they might actually run into bank robbers
[09:04.720 --> 09:06.520]  or terrorist groups occasionally.
[09:06.520 --> 09:09.720]  And certainly useful to protect police that are moving into an area.
[09:09.720 --> 09:14.740]  But the main deployment of this to even small towns in the training manuals that we've gotten
[09:14.740 --> 09:19.760]  from the FBI and federal marshals, I mean, we're the ones that usually break those.
[09:19.760 --> 09:25.040]  I mean, everybody knows that as a secret, you know, seven years ago, now it's public
[09:25.040 --> 09:29.480]  that it's for returning veterans, gun owners, tea partiers, and they teach the police that
[09:29.480 --> 09:32.880]  a civil war is coming.
[09:32.880 --> 09:36.360]  This is the fifth clip that I've seen in 2014.
[09:36.360 --> 09:40.560]  In fact, I'm going to have Watson tomorrow for infowords.com.
[09:40.560 --> 09:44.880]  I think do a blurb article showing the last four or five articles, probably more about
[09:44.880 --> 09:45.880]  that.
[09:45.880 --> 09:49.760]  I mean, I was able to pull up four or five other examples this year where police chiefs
[09:49.760 --> 09:55.800]  and others to the media say, we need these tanks for the constitutionalist.
[09:55.800 --> 09:59.680]  So so the point is not a debate about do they need this or not?
[09:59.680 --> 10:03.920]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, let the police have full auto, let them have armor, let them
[10:03.920 --> 10:04.920]  have whatever.
[10:04.920 --> 10:12.040]  If it's a major metropolitan area or whatever, because nowadays, who knows drug cartels.
[10:12.040 --> 10:14.120]  I mean, look at Mexico.
[10:14.120 --> 10:22.400]  But it's for the American people and it's for groups that are not committing crimes.
[10:22.400 --> 10:24.120]  It was never set up to fight al Qaeda.
[10:24.120 --> 10:26.600]  They first started deploying this stuff after 9 11.
[10:26.600 --> 10:30.360]  And it's always used and they say for Waco style stuff.
[10:30.360 --> 10:32.360]  Well, they started to fight at Waco.
[10:32.360 --> 10:36.320]  They could have arrested Koresh any time I interviewed the sheriff.
[10:36.320 --> 10:39.040]  He was on record saying he was in town every day.
[10:39.040 --> 10:40.400]  They had a business in town.
[10:40.400 --> 10:42.240]  He jogged up the property every morning.
[10:42.240 --> 10:43.240]  We said arresting.
[10:43.240 --> 10:48.160]  If you've got proof of him molesting kids.
[10:48.160 --> 10:52.120]  And instead they went and opened fire on the building to set a precedent of attacking the
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.880]  American people to demonize that cult.
[10:55.880 --> 10:56.880]  Probably was a cult.
[10:56.880 --> 11:00.600]  A lot of what they said about him wasn't true, but it was a cult.
[11:00.600 --> 11:02.720]  I know the dividends a lot of them.
[11:02.720 --> 11:07.040]  Some are very nice people, but some of them were cult like doesn't matter.
[11:07.040 --> 11:10.040]  You don't blow it up and burn it down with the Delta Force.
[11:10.040 --> 11:11.040]  That's who was there.
[11:11.040 --> 11:12.560]  I watched the C-SPAN hearings.
[11:12.560 --> 11:16.560]  I'll be on other radio shows and I'll bring that up and they all Delta Force.
[11:16.560 --> 11:17.560]  Yeah, right.
[11:17.560 --> 11:21.120]  They don't even know that was in the official congressional report.
[11:21.120 --> 11:24.700]  Our military there murdering those people.
[11:24.700 --> 11:29.360]  We have the FLIR footage from the helicopters and from the aircraft that the FBI was forced
[11:29.360 --> 11:34.480]  to release in court with the troops behind the tanks in an infantry maneuver shooting
[11:34.480 --> 11:38.480]  up the building and shooting people that were trying to get out the back.
[11:38.480 --> 11:42.200]  Now I'm digressing with a history lesson there.
[11:42.200 --> 11:43.920]  The point is that's coming up.
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.480]  Police armored military vehicles needed for constitutionalists with firearms.
[11:49.480 --> 11:51.880]  I'm going to cover that though in the next hour.
[11:51.880 --> 11:55.920]  The video is on infowars.com right now.
[11:55.920 --> 12:02.400]  There is a major arms buildup for a war on American gun owners during national gun confiscation.
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.680]  That's a fact.
[12:03.680 --> 12:09.040]  That's what the federal government is training for and they now admit it and it's treasonous
[12:09.040 --> 12:13.120]  just like Obama signing an executive order to legalize the illegals and let them bring
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.240]  in their families and legalize people that have aggravated felonies and the Republicans
[12:18.240 --> 12:19.720]  are not blocking it.
[12:19.720 --> 12:24.080]  The Republican leadership just like the Republican leadership just voted on this giant spending
[12:24.080 --> 12:31.320]  bill that has what we warned you of last week provisions bigger than the banker bailout
[12:31.320 --> 12:35.960]  to write off all derivatives in the future as they get ready for the next big collapse.
[12:35.960 --> 12:47.240]  It'll make 2008 look like a cakewalk look like a blip compared to an explosion derivatives
[12:47.240 --> 12:52.120]  are bigger than they were six years ago seven years ago and they are writing these treasonous
[12:52.120 --> 12:53.720]  bills that are set to pass the Senate.
[12:53.720 --> 12:58.080]  It's going to the president's death certificate passed the Senate Ted Cruz came out and said
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.880]  it's a nightmare Rand Paul's come out and said it's highly destructive we're going
[13:02.880 --> 13:08.200]  to go over those voting numbers that's coming up later in the hour as well two examples
[13:08.200 --> 13:12.160]  of media censorship I want to look at overseas that tie into what's now starting to happen
[13:12.160 --> 13:19.400]  here under political correctness rubrics China will arrest you if you play the national anthem
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.960]  outside of an official state function and that dovetails whether trying to pass laws
[13:24.960 --> 13:28.920]  where you can't burn the American flag I don't like burning the American flag but if you
[13:28.920 --> 13:32.880]  take somebody's first amendment right to do it you've now become China then they could
[13:32.880 --> 13:38.560]  do it on every other subject and then I've got another one Turkey arrest 27 including
[13:38.560 --> 13:46.680]  police and media for criticizing the president who's basically a dictator Turkish police officers
[13:46.680 --> 13:52.000]  and media workers are detained in a roundup that's in the New York Times and of course

[21:59.080 --> 22:11.640]  the people that carried out 9-11 judge jury then the sentence you get rid of that in western
[22:11.640 --> 22:20.600]  law we're now before 2015 in the year 2015 we're going back we're about to be 2015 we're
[22:20.600 --> 22:31.760]  going back to 1215 wow it just hit me 1215 is exactly how many years ago the battle
[22:31.760 --> 22:36.920]  are running me the Magna Carta where they began to try to restrict and outlaw torture
[22:36.920 --> 22:45.400]  this is the zenith or the birthplace of western law and culture that built so much security
[22:45.400 --> 22:48.240]  hadn't been perfect our legal system is not perfect but I'll tell you it's a lot better
[22:48.240 --> 22:55.760]  than other countries and it creates stability and it creates an environment for investment
[22:55.760 --> 23:02.360]  and a level playing field at least more level we know North Korea is bad because they torture
[23:02.360 --> 23:05.840]  we know North Vietnam was bad because they torture we know the Nazis were bad and Joseph
[23:05.840 --> 23:10.400]  Mengele because they tortured we know Fidel Castro is bad because they tortured we know
[23:10.400 --> 23:15.720]  the Romans were bad because they tortured we know that barbarous cultures torture and
[23:15.720 --> 23:22.440]  A you don't get good intelligence from it study show B what you do get is fake confessions
[23:22.440 --> 23:29.840]  fear and terror we're gonna burn you at the stake you know and we're gonna prove you're
[23:29.840 --> 23:33.920]  a witch one way or the other we're gonna torture you till you confess or if you don't confess
[23:33.920 --> 23:38.400]  it shows the devil was in you and gave you the power to not admit you were a witch this
[23:38.400 --> 23:43.480]  is the type of stuff that kept the dark ages going for hundreds and hundreds of years until
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.920]  people started saying no in places like England in 1215 the Magna Carta folks is what our
[23:48.920 --> 23:52.920]  whole bill of rights constitution all of it comes out of it the Renaissance basically
[23:52.920 --> 23:59.960]  all comes out of it it all comes out of that and some things that happened in Italy so
[23:59.960 --> 24:09.240]  we are here now seeing hundreds of years 800 plus years of progress being flushed down
[24:09.240 --> 24:18.400]  the toilet in a matter of years under the pretext of fighting Al Qaeda who our own government
[24:18.400 --> 24:23.200]  helped create and protect now they call themselves ISIS and I saw Al Qaeda and IS were in the
[24:23.200 --> 24:28.040]  news last week complaining you know how dare you torture people you're giving them moral
[24:28.040 --> 24:33.360]  high ground you're a bunch of infidel scum when they are total tortures so the argument
[24:33.360 --> 24:40.920]  is well we'll do what they do oh great we'll we'll sink to their level and again I'm gonna
[24:40.920 --> 24:47.400]  explain to you what they admit has gone on not in this report the army report of 2007
[24:47.400 --> 24:52.320]  the Pentagon report of 2009 we've read them on air I mean I can't even say what's in
[24:52.320 --> 24:59.160]  some of these reports the army report general to Goombas report of 2007 said that they would
[24:59.160 --> 25:07.040]  routinely rape people small children in front of them but also do it with flashlights dripping
[25:07.040 --> 25:12.720]  with acid I mean I've never thought of something like that that's like Jeffrey Dahmer and they
[25:12.720 --> 25:17.160]  would hire former federal jail guards and pay them up to 120 thousand dollars a year
[25:17.160 --> 25:22.920]  as Pentagon contractors who had rape convictions and child porn convictions this is in the
[25:22.920 --> 25:28.920]  army report the army actually came out and said this is evil I'm not lionizing the army
[25:28.920 --> 25:34.680]  had to do the torturing or they had to deliver the little kids there was such a rebellion
[25:34.680 --> 25:40.600]  in the army that they put out the report admitting at all the original torture report they got
[25:40.600 --> 25:45.040]  almost no coverage so this new one's a whitewash with fine sighted others get ready to leave
[25:45.040 --> 25:54.200]  office down the road covering their butts total whitewash the report 2009 much more hardcore
[25:54.200 --> 26:01.400]  as well but you do not quote keep the country safe torturing people ladies and gentlemen
[26:01.400 --> 26:05.440]  most the people grabbed were conscripts who were sold for upwards of 25 thousand dollars
[26:05.440 --> 26:10.600]  a piece that's mainstream news look it up oh I got a terrorist I'm the informant the
[26:10.600 --> 26:15.240]  informants actually Taliban and they would sell like a 16 year old teenager who'd been
[26:15.240 --> 26:20.800]  conscripted to guard a pass to the waiting special forces helicopter and our own colonels
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.720]  and people famous we've interviewed them a bunch of them not just colonel shaver but
[26:25.720 --> 26:33.280]  others admitted that they would go this person's not a terrorist or not even a combatant they're
[26:33.280 --> 26:38.240]  a conscript they would interrogate them for five minutes and try to say we don't want
[26:38.240 --> 26:43.920]  them dump them back and up the chain the CIA that runs camp x-ray and the camp within
[26:43.920 --> 26:47.640]  Guantanamo Bay there's another secret camp a torture laboratory they said oh that's
[26:47.640 --> 26:52.200]  who we want because you know how they get child soldiers in Africa look it up the formula
[26:52.200 --> 26:55.600]  you get about a 10 or 12 year old you torture them a few years beat them up then tell them
[26:55.600 --> 26:59.040]  you've now graduated your elite they'll do whatever they're told they are torturing and
[26:59.040 --> 27:05.120]  and and testing people to see who could psychologically be a double agent to lead ISIS brigades
[27:05.120 --> 27:11.400]  and others against Syria and others and carry out attacks and be al-qaeda leaders working
[27:11.400 --> 27:16.960]  for the criminal group above our government they have laboratories and that's why so many
[27:16.960 --> 27:21.400]  leaders of ISIS and al-qaeda are graduates of Guantanamo Bay people say well you should
[27:21.400 --> 27:26.480]  never released them why most of the commanders come out of torture bases it's not working
[27:26.480 --> 27:32.560]  oh it's working quite well and when I tell you all this it's San Francisco Chronicle
[27:32.560 --> 27:41.680]  New York Times New York Magazine the New Yorker Miami Herald it's in all the news I mean this
[27:41.680 --> 27:46.960]  stuff about rectal feeding where they snake it all the way up 15 feet through your lower
[27:46.960 --> 27:50.960]  and your upper intestine total torture internal bleeding to feed you they can feed you down
[27:50.960 --> 27:55.960]  the throat the Chinese Communist torture down the throat I mean this is just pervert stuff
[27:55.960 --> 28:02.960]  the the the admissions in Congress in 2008 in a separate report on Camp X-ray was they
[28:02.960 --> 28:10.240]  would put people on LSD and PCP and fly in hookers and they would do satanic rituals
[28:10.240 --> 28:14.520]  to freak these young people out and then pour blood all over them and have sex with them
[28:14.520 --> 28:19.680]  I mean that's in the reports you think rectal feedings a big deal go look at the reports
[28:19.680 --> 28:25.720]  where they have I mean imagine you're 16 year old from Afghanistan and there is a porn
[28:25.720 --> 28:32.480]  star because that's what most these hookers are with a devil outfit on and you're on
[28:32.480 --> 28:38.880]  drugs raping you and you know why they do that at Camp X-ray because they like it it's
[28:38.880 --> 28:43.800]  for those army psychiatrists and CIA psychiatrists that are the real mingle of freaks they're
[28:43.800 --> 28:48.320]  just having a party and want to fly in a bunch of hookers for themselves and go hey baby
[28:48.320 --> 28:53.360]  go in there and do I mean it's just a freak show why did Jeffrey Dahmer do stuff like
[28:53.360 --> 28:57.760]  this to people because he was a psychopathic demon that's why same reason they do it we'll

[37:50.040 --> 37:54.160]  go to the clip you're going to draw the line check how are you going to know i'm i'm saying
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.040]  i is that you're okay with that margin for i have no problem as long as we achieve our
[37:58.040 --> 38:02.000]  objective and our objective is to get the guys who did nine eleven and it is to avoid
[38:02.000 --> 38:07.680]  another attack against the united states i was prepared and we did we got the authorization
[38:07.680 --> 38:11.000]  from the president and authorization from the justice department to go forward to the
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.480]  program it worked it worked now for thirteen years we've avoided another mass casualty
[38:16.480 --> 38:21.040]  attack against the united states we did capture ben laden we did capture an awful lot of the
[38:21.040 --> 38:24.800]  senior guys of al-qaeda who were responsible for that attack on nine eleven i'd do it again
[38:24.800 --> 38:30.680]  in a minute and now al-qaeda on steroids ices is just running all over the place murdering
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.400]  hundreds of thousands and our own governments behind it on record look it up we've done
[38:35.400 --> 38:40.640]  fifty shows on it literally i'm not getting back into it probably seventy shows our military
[38:40.640 --> 38:46.920]  has gone public about it and again our military is the most awake because they've been there
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.400]  watching it joe bigs works in our office he was written about the squire and rolling

[39:01.280 --> 39:07.440]  out delivering people for torture what made him mad was it wasn't the guys they kept trying
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.600]  to suicide bomb them because i've talked to family that's been there when they caught
[39:12.600 --> 39:18.400]  somebody dousing their kids with gasoline to call in the medivacs to save the burning
[39:18.400 --> 39:23.080]  kids and they suicide bomb or try to what the special forces do to them i mean i get in

[39:41.720 --> 39:45.520]  out where'd you bring the drugs because they wanted to control that drug flow they wanted

[52:17.400 --> 52:22.360]  five-year-old child and stick a cookie on a counter and say you can't have that because you've been a
[52:22.360 --> 52:32.760]  bad boy that's torture if you take a young woman that's a little bit overweight and last last
[52:32.760 --> 52:39.080]  um what the perfect woman looks like and advertising all over the place that's torture if you put
[52:39.080 --> 52:47.880]  maryleman roe in front of me and her prime in a bikini it's torture i get it now you know it works
[52:47.880 --> 52:53.720]  and other you know the torture is actually dependent on the individual you take a person you take a
[52:53.720 --> 52:59.480]  person um that well i get it i mean that's what cops do we're going to take your cigarettes away
[52:59.480 --> 53:04.600]  we'll we'll give you some whiskey uh you know we'll we'll go easy on your family uh you know

[53:36.520 --> 53:43.080]  the block like too much all right so so you're a cop and you you catch a guy you think okay okay
[53:43.080 --> 53:47.800]  well let's just say a cop catches a guy and they won't say where the little girl is and we don't
[53:47.800 --> 53:51.960]  know if she's dead or not you go ahead and beat the hell out of him and you know what in that case
[53:51.960 --> 53:58.120]  i would get it in that case you don't legalize it and make it a mainstay go ahead
[54:01.560 --> 54:06.520]  are you still there mark yes sir i'll give you one more minute go ahead your go go ahead okay okay
[54:06.520 --> 54:12.040]  okay um you know and when you're dealing with people of other cultures with other cultures
[54:12.600 --> 54:19.560]  that their idea of a nice time is chopping a guy's head off yeah i mean that's where that's
[54:19.560 --> 54:23.960]  where that's where polo came from is afghanistan chopping people's heads off and using it i get it
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.080]  okay listen man you carry on you're doing a great job happy new year

[54:45.960 --> 54:53.160]  spark guys or whatever all right but see there's the problem if you codify torture the bad guys
[54:53.160 --> 55:02.200]  will use it how do you stop that all right um the deal is the deal is everybody every individual
[55:02.200 --> 55:10.600]  on this planet irregardless of their ethnic upbringing has their level of torture when
[55:10.600 --> 55:16.920]  they have their level of torture and when you hit with precision i'm a lucky valiant kind of guy
[55:16.920 --> 55:24.200]  i truly am um you get it they get it and you know like you don't have to get like all crazy on them
[55:24.200 --> 55:30.600]  okay you don't have to get sadistic but it cannot certainly appear that way no i hear you i hear you
[55:30.600 --> 55:35.560]  but the minute it does our whole culture is in danger and that's the issue it's like using the

[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:39.320]  liberal namby pamby leon mac could you formulate all right why do you hate america

[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:58.040]  hominem attacks i am a liberal in the thomas jefferson sense i would be called a right winger
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:03.800]  today because i'm pro life i'm pro gun things like that these labels don't mean anything i want you
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:07.880]  to have due process hold on a minute hold on a minute you you made some claims there that were
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:15.960]  just ad hominem attacks it attacks the entire judicial system and destroys faith in any type of
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:23.240]  free trial or any testimony if torture is brought in and so that's why i'm against torture so
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:30.840]  argue for torture don't call me names i can ask you is this where are your tears crying for all
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:35.080]  those palestinian people that were getting bombed into oblivion this summer you didn't have a show
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:40.760]  for them uh i said that that was tribal warfare the globalists have organized and i think it's
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:47.560]  bad on both sides and i think it's overall a manipulation to destabilize the region and the
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:53.480]  arab countries use that as a scapegoat to ignore their own oppression it becomes the cause celeb
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:58.920]  because that's all hollywood promotes so again you just want to attack alec shones you're not
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:06.680]  defending torture here today are you no i think it's okay it just errors anyways right all right
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:13.400]  this is sarcastic sir i was the person day one saying 9-11 was being basically staged
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.200]  to attack muslim nations and take over and our government's funding radical islam to
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.760]  destabilize the whole region but none of you so-called you know trendy liberals and that's
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:27.640]  why you made that joke calling me a liberal uh care about the hundreds of thousands of christians
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:34.200]  killed in syria or just people in general being murdered mainly blacks uh in libya
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:41.080]  i mean that's just all you need for a moral equivalency and to feel good about yourself
[01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:48.520]  is to just say i support israel but just because i don't hate israel i criticize israel
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:53.400]  from a place of strength when israel's wrong that's why israel lobby groups like the southern
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:59.480]  probably law center and adl attack me and why the white supremacist attack me because all they've
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.760]  got is tribalism all that's all they've got it's why the black sites a lot of them call me a racist
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:08.840]  because i'm against race war or i don't want to have a war with the police because they're
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:15.480]  being manipulated so now i'm pro cop i'm anti civil war here's the deal i've already won the fight
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:22.760]  to prove there's a world government being formed and that tyranny is rising and that big banks
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:28.360]  run the planet i don't care who runs them i'm against a new derivatives bailout i don't care
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:33.000]  who's doing it i want florida my water i don't care who's behind it i want the gmo's gone i've
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.840]  already proven it's going on i've already won that fight now i'm trying to stop the global
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:45.240]  a staging a race war and then civil war that i predicted that they're now starting and you
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.040]  know who's listening and all you government people and all you dumb down low information shills
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:57.640]  that aren't sophisticated that just feel good and go zionist shill vatican shill reptoid shill bill
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:04.680]  hick shill whatever delusional weak loserville stuff you do i want us to win i cover real issues
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:11.400]  that have an effect and the fact that i don't want protests in america to be go shoot some cop
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:18.040]  directing traffic that's a good moral statement that makes sense and you know what instead of
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:23.160]  just attacking the police i'm converting them because they were already americana and i and
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:27.640]  there's already that vein in them i'm reminding them of what they already were i'm not even converting
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:33.400]  them and the system will probably there's a good chance come after me for it it's a good chance
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:40.360]  i don't want to say things that can't fade i i just they they hate me because i want peace i want

[01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:10.360]  quicker easier more seductive it's absolutely true this country has all its problems but it's
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.520]  demonized constantly because compared to all the others and i've studied the history of the world
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:20.840]  it's fascinating we were the most moral we were unique we were trailblazing we were strong we were
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:29.160]  founded by men and women who were so intelligent and so cool that they set about to take the
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.080]  reminiscence to the next level and change the world forever and beat the greatest empire
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:42.280]  and they didn't torture people they had a lot of other evil stuff but they recognized it and said
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:48.680]  it was evil and said we want to change it's that decision in the heart king david did horrible
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:53.400]  things shin his best friend often be killed so he could have his wife but then he repented
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:09:00.440]  and really repented it's the heart that god judges let me tell you it'll poison our heart
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:06.200]  torturing people yeah it's a phone book upside the head of a child molester one day to make
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.920]  him confess the next day you're raping a child like the armor reports admit they did it i'll be
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:16.120]  grave we can't sign on to that ladies and gentlemen we'll lose our souls just like we can't sign on
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:21.000]  to abortion or any of this garbage it's immoral let's go to robert north dakota you're on the
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:27.000]  year you think torture might be okay go ahead hey alex love your show man and i love all your
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.520]  products and i you know i agree with you 100 on everything what i thought your call screener was
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.000]  that uh you know i'm a veteran i'm an old school veteran and uh you know i believe in honor
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:42.840]  helping the oppressed dignity loyalty you know i just i hope there's still some of that left in
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:48.120]  our military and i absolutely those things that you read i believe are absolutely horrible but
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:54.200]  there's two things i want i want to get out and one is you know we train in the sears course and
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:10:00.120]  stuff like that we train for waterboarding and sleep deprivation i don't think those are torture
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.520]  if it gets our information if any but the other things that you mentioned are absolutely terrible
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:11.240]  now where you cited uh that you read the reports from cnn and abc and cbs are those horrible things
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.640]  my question is i you know i i don't trust the mainstream media especially cnn and all those
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.400]  that you mentioned because they've been in this administration's back pocket from the kid go yeah
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:26.920]  and they've constantly been demonizing our military defunding it spreading it then and then deploying
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.600]  us and uh so how do we know i mean i'm just confused how do we know that what those reports
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:39.000]  are saying that they did are true and not just cnn maybe cbs uh just fabricating that and making
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.240]  it up well i mean here's the thing i cannot believe this you you guys are so sophisticated
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:47.320]  especially the veterans the combat veterans that's why i hate doing this show sometimes because i
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:53.080]  want to explain all the pieces because if i just explain some it aids the enemy there's an internal
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:11:00.040]  fight between the nsa the cia and the army the navy's involved the air force hadn't been around
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:05.000]  that long so it's not as deep but the army usually was the most powerful thing in the us
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.760]  and pretty darn good i mean they really overall the history of the u.s army because it's found
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:17.880]  about george washington it just it overall it's pretty good and then you get the cia in 47 and
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:23.800]  the air force in 47 and nasa in 47 all these new groups they tried to set up to move power into
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.920]  those you got the navy that used to fight with the army you got the marines their their own group
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:34.520]  that aren't too political generally i found when you get into all the intel but there's blocks
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:43.960]  of government fighting and yes the cia leaked the torture photos at army bases to blame the army
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:47.640]  because they're trying to take over the army and take over the drones and i mean i have this not
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:54.200]  from me this is from like colonel schaefer and dr pacanik and three star generals i talked to off
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:58.040]  record i mean the government lessons they know who i talked to so i i mean i don't know all the
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:03.560]  stuff i'm i have a mouthpiece so i mean i have a venue so i'm told this and it turns out to be
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.040]  good intel and i realized well these guys are nice interview admiral more every month he was
[01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:12.200]  the chairman of the joint chiefs for he died and man before he died he was just spilling his guts
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:16.920]  on everything he was the chairman of the joint chiefs former judge advocate head general before
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.440]  that and you're absolutely right there's inner fights going on the cia and the media released
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:29.640]  that report to burn the army so the army released a report with the full details pointing out the
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:35.560]  cia controlled past a certain area they controlled it they would pick army they wanted to be involved
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:42.440]  so it was actually a setup to burn the army the rape of the kids and stuff so what you said is
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.720]  super sophisticated and super accurate you're absolutely right but how do i explain that to
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:54.520]  a general audience i mean it's it's it's so sophisticated i spend 15 hours a day trying
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:00.920]  to figure it all out and i can't figure it out i mean what do you say to that well thank you for
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.000]  for clarifying that a little bit because that makes more sense i've experienced that infuriating
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.680]  myself so i i've seen it and uh that makes more sense so then the simple truth of the
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:17.000]  matter is looking at the army gets blamed for a camp x-ray but but but but who runs the base
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.960]  within it the cia and again i don't want to just demonize the cia every time but so many times
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:29.720]  they're the ones that it ends up with they're the group that started playing dirty in this country
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:35.320]  they're the ones that accepted macchiavelli in 1947 they've been using the ring of mordor since day
[01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:41.480]  one and they have screwed this country up go ahead sorry yeah and they introduced the lsd and all
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:47.160]  the other stuff you name it it just always leads back to them it just so that so that makes sense
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:53.480]  that alex thank you for clarifying that because uh that infighting so these things insert certain steps
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:14:01.720]  are going on but uh so they're using it's like they're using it to get them all against each other
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:07.480]  exactly let me explain how this works my dad working like back in the 80s and i've said my
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:12.680]  parents did some government stuff was trying to fight communist and he had some groups that he knew
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.520]  and family that had worked for the government say will you help take care of some east germans and
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:21.960]  things and try to get them ready to be sent back to germany and i mean then we had like white vans
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.800]  driving around our house when that was going on listening to us and i was like you know 10 years
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:31.080]  old but that's probably about to start calling up getting mad at me but the point is is that is that
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:37.800]  it's just all it's it's it's not it's there's like seven cias there's like four or five nsa's
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:43.400]  there's only one marine corps there's like two armies there's three or four navies i mean there's
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:49.800]  all these factions and the truth is no one can even figure it out i mean this thing is so crazy
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.880]  let's do one more call but they'll only get a minute or so because i'm going to break
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:59.720]  uh babla in virginia go ahead you're on the air yes thanks for taking my call out um there are
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:03.160]  a couple things i was wanting to kind of clarify that there's there's some difference between
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:08.120]  classical conditioning i putting the cookies out in front of kids and saying yes no this is
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.480]  bright this is wrong this is if you get rewarded if you're good you do you get you know punished if
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.280]  you're bad that's classical conditioning there's a big difference between that and torture there is
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:24.360]  i'm i'm a i'm a veteran and um on the torture thing there's a lot of issues i have with the
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.760]  torture because what happens is when you actually torture somebody like you stayed earlier you're
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.400]  pulling the fingernails out and busting the teeth off and stuff like this you're going to get a reply
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.760]  because people will do would say whatever you these things that you want to hear in order
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:42.360]  to stop the pain stay there tell me about it i don't know if you've been involved in torture
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:48.120]  like bigs has but it also affects the torture stay there i'm going to come back to bubba then
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:55.400]  we're going to go to uh who else has been holding the longest john and then raider derek spencer we're

[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:28.280]  jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcm radio
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:38.760]  network radio radio radio active baby look they're good people in the private sector in government
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:44.600]  you name it they're good people in the pta they're good people that are private farmers
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:50.360]  they're good people in the cia but there are globalist interests that want to set up a
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.600]  planetary government where they're above the law and where they can censor and control whatever they
[01:20:54.600 --> 01:21:03.000]  want and the system wants torture but they also want to burn certain agencies and blame them for it
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:08.840]  but never the president or vice president oh dick cheney says he had the president
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:13.240]  and a lawyer authorized it so it's okay well what about the interest above them
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:17.800]  so they want us to riot and blame the cop on the beat yeah i want to go a little higher
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:23.640]  i want to go above dick cheney we'll go above doors w bush tell us sure you that espn watching
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:30.440]  golf playing clone of obama george w did not know what was going on cheney did cheney was the real
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.080]  president that's come out congressional testimony so he's out there on meet the press cover in his butt
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:40.440]  doubling down i'd do it again finish your point bubba sorry to cut you off as a veteran you were
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:43.800]  saying knocking people's teeth out whatever they'll tell you whatever you want to hear
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.840]  yes sir um like i said they'll tell you whatever you want to hear so it's doing the interrogators
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:53.240]  going through this process and they're torching them and whatnot and i've never been involved in
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.960]  doing any of that i just know stuff i've worked with people that that have done that i'll put it
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:22:02.760]  that way the thing is the information that to get out of that a lot of times it's false information
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:08.200]  and when that interrogator acts on that information and they therefore put out this false information
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:13.480]  it's just off a chain reaction and many many facets because what'll happen is say say for
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.960]  example sky that they're torturing says okay our planet attack over here in this in this area
[01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:22.440]  then they start sending guys like me and big and these other grubs out and we go this area and
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:27.640]  there's nothing there we've wasted a lot of time and money and and instead of going someplace where
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:33.160]  we there are enemy or whatever the case is whereas you could offer them a quarter million but held
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:38.760]  him and said you get the quarter million but if the terrorists aren't there we're going to blow
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:44.120]  your head off now that's not torture and i'm told that's what gets the real results i'm not saying
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:48.520]  that's good to do that but see the higher ups don't want to know where the real terrorists are
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.920]  because they're protecting them not really running them they're just protecting them so they can
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:59.160]  create a threat yes sir and if it's if it's terrorists are in your in your classical war
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:04.600]  because you know we all know this all the wars are bogus but when you have your you know countries
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.760]  against countries what have you instead instead of you know fighting the basically if the fashion
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:14.520]  but when you're when you start torturing people what happens too is your adversaries and your
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:19.880]  enemies we realize this so when it comes down to it if you're like in a trench warfare type
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:25.400]  situation or anything what happens is like hey i'm not giving up because i know if these guys
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:30.680]  if i give up these guys are going to be torturing me and that's exactly what george washington said
[01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:35.240]  because about a year into the war his generals were criticizing him for executing people for
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:42.360]  torture and for war crimes he said listen we're going to gain the civilian support by not doing
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:47.560]  this and burning down tories houses and the british are doing that and burning down our houses
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:53.080]  they're going to increase our support and and george washington went on to say if we don't let
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:57.320]  their troops go under honor of promising they won't return to the battlefield if we do shoot
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:02.360]  prisoners they're going to fight to the death and make it personal if we reach out and are
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:06.680]  honorable they're going to want to join us and did you know something like half the german
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:12.920]  hessian mercenaries they brought in defected and didn't just desert they joined the republic
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:19.320]  see how the moral high ground is really the secret weapon does that make sense exactly this is exactly
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:24.760]  the point i was getting to and you know but the people that that are controlling you know look
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:30.360]  you talk about constantly the the illuminati they don't they don't want that they want everybody to
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:34.760]  be down here torturing us each other and they want us to wreak havoc on each other and just
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:39.240]  having total chaos down here and basically destroying each other so they can get to their
[01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:44.440]  the george guide stones numbers and five hundred million people a 90 percent reduction great call
[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:49.880]  thank you i'm going to move to derrick and others first off if you type in ksm terrorist
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:57.560]  or khalid shake mohammed he was held at guantanamo bay well other facilities in guantanamo
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:09.080]  for eight years before he testified that he had bombed buildings and it turned out the one of
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:14.360]  the buildings wasn't built till four years after he was in custody they basically had him confess
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:21.000]  to blowing up the lucetania the titanic and killing jesus christ i mean yeah and that's what they want
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.680]  it's just some fake cut out and they finally got him to confess not with waterboarding they said
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:33.000]  we've got your son your 14 year old son and he just went i'll say whatever you want fine
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.680]  they finally grabbed his wife and kid and that was all they needed well let me use this i'm not
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:42.760]  torturing people i'm going to tell the government and everybody else your children have no future
[01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:48.840]  under this new world order and you know it so why would you go along with this one it's going to
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:54.600]  screw your family over i mean this is just no brainer for me derrick and ohio thank you for
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:00.680]  holding you're on the year worldwide then we'll go to john and others thank you uh first thing
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:06.840]  you know that i've noticed is that you know it started off with most people deny that we are a
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:13.400]  country that it is engaged in torturing people torturing the enemy but now that it's come out
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:20.600]  and they can't hide us anymore it's like without without skipping a beat most people are immediately
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.880]  defending it and the argument i hear well most people that defended on the grassroots
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.960]  have never been in a fight never been in a serious car wreck never seen somebody actually beat up
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:34.600]  for torture never been mugged they are little that's what they want to soft and dumb because
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:39.400]  anyone honorable wouldn't would know you're not for torture sorry go ahead but absolutely right
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:45.240]  there is no nsa or it's not spying on you oh it's spying it's for your own good exactly the lying
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:50.840]  is what discredits them go ahead right first first that our torture policy was denied
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:55.960]  and then when it comes out immediately most common uh most people who just you know watched the
[01:26:55.960 --> 01:27:01.240]  mainstream news immediately defended as well because it's against the terrorists and that's
[01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:06.200]  the only argument i hear pared it back well they did 9 11 against us so it's okay that we do that to
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:11.960]  them um that's and then we don't blow up saudi arabia we're 15 of the hijackers come from we
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.080]  blow up iraq for the second time whose arch enemies with the saudi's see how the saudi
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:26.360]  skip go to iraq perfect plan right exactly people um really don't understand any of the law for any
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.080]  of these things and and then when people say well that's a violation of the eighth amendment that's
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:38.520]  any um indefinite detention cruel and unusual punishment and when people say well whenever i
[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:42.680]  hear the argument will the constitution that's just an old piece of paper that's outdated um
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.320]  but that's the law yeah i guess private property rights and the right to a jury is outdated too and
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:53.240]  the right to own guns exactly there is an attempt to impeach and overthrow our entire system and
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:57.640]  replace it with hell on earth god bless you great call let's go ahead and talk to tony and south

[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:45.960]  there's a bigger issue here with torture you notice america always just blame for every evil in
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:50.280]  the world they don't blame the corrupt interests that are using us to carry out some of these bad
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:57.400]  agendas the ui never criticizes china or north korea or russia anybody else for human rights
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:05.160]  abuses to warfars our own media does it to demonize capitalism and freedom in the american system
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:11.320]  as if it did all this kind of they blame capitalism for the bailouts and the derivatives and
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:16.040]  that's the opposite of capitalism that's insider groups controlling government fascism
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.800]  but they use socialism to control the general public but it is a fascist system above that
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:27.160]  as soon as the public ever clicks to this stuff it's like the games of monopoly it's like the
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:31.960]  rules of a board game this stuff's not that complex to understand how it basically works
[01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.920]  then you can figure out all the little details that is complex it's just how did i not see that
[01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:41.640]  before it's like those paintings that have hidden images that you can't see but as soon as you pull
[01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:49.240]  back and see it you're like how did i not see that my job is not to tell you what to see my job
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.800]  because i've already seen the picture is to go hey there's a hidden picture there
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:59.800]  you might want to look a little closer step back a few feet don't be emotional and just what do you
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:10.520]  see there there's a lot of those on the internet people send you a you know like a asian symbol
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:16.360]  or whatever a letter and or a word and it'll be something a joke you know something dirty usually
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.800]  but you show to somebody they i can't see it you're like it's right there you don't see it
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.160]  it's that same thing getting people out of their trance getting them away from their
[01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.800]  smartphones long enough or espn long enough to just think about what else is going on in the world
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:36.680]  kit daniels wrote a story about the debt i'm gonna go back to your phone calls
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:44.920]  and it passes budget over six times larger the number of galaxies in the universe there's
[01:35:44.920 --> 01:35:49.800]  billions of galaxies that have been photographed by Hubble federal budget makes cosmos look less
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:57.800]  significant in comparison our actual inflation is worse than zimbabwe or the weimar republic when
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:03.880]  it comes to actual bills digital bills and printed bills but the world still accepts the dollar so
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:09.720]  it's okay right now only some inflation the minute though that this starts to become truly
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:16.440]  inflationary we are doomed that's not some negative mean statement i lie asleep at night
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:23.240]  worried about that and so do economists i mean this is a time bomb this isn't fair mongering
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:30.200]  this is real senate passes 1.1 trillion spending bill since measure to president obama
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:37.720]  and i've got articles like this mtv's brainless we say it's actually brawless promotes race riots
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:43.080]  we have that video where they actually promote going out and rioting on mtv i mean if i did that
[01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:48.760]  which i don't want to do that let's be clear but if i did that i would be indicted for inciting a
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:56.440]  riot and i should be but mtv can they're there to corrupt things there to misdirect the youth
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:02.120]  that are upset it's sick it's sick and i don't want to be played like a chump and i don't want you to
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.720]  be played like a chump we're in this giant group movement we're on this planet with eight billion
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:13.720]  people or seven that billion people to be free i've got to get you to be free vice versa let's go
[01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:18.280]  to uh tony in south carolina finishing up your statement then we'll go to mark in texas and others
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:25.800]  go ahead yeah um torturers are just bad i mean they cannot possibly be good and i want to be good
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:30.600]  i want to wear the white hat on the horse i don't want to have the black hat on the horse i'm a 13
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:37.880]  year veteran and i could kind of understand torture if you were assaulting something and you
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:42.360]  overtook some prisoners and you're taking heat fire from that location you want to know what's
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:49.400]  there but getting that immediate information would be helpful to your your movement but sending
[01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:55.400]  that prisoner back to be held for six years at guantanamo or wherever i mean is your information
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:00.440]  going to be useless it's not valuable to you at all well sure and nobody prosecutes torture in the
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:05.640]  heat of the moment when you got guys bleeding to death and there's a hill up there shooting at you
[01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.840]  you pull an i found i'm going to slit your throat if you don't tell me what's happening
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:14.200]  and and then he doesn't tell you oh you go ahead and just stab him in the throat the next guy will
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:20.520]  that's not even torture that's warfare when you creep around though and and and and do all this
[01:38:20.520 --> 01:38:29.800]  there's a reason it's illegal yeah i just uh i want my employees either local state county
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:36.360]  and federal level to be ministers of god i want them to do good i want to feel in my heart that
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.720]  i'm better off because they're there and at least with the federal government i have to question
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:47.320]  whether or not i'm better off because they're there i was about to say who trusts this lying
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:53.800]  usurped captured occupied federal government to run torture i mean who trusts them
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.000]  nobody i mean we're not saying in the heat of the moment
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:07.320]  they bust in and somebody's put a kid in a safe and they're going to suffocate in one hour
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.880]  they won't tell you the combination you can't cut through i mean no one's going to say that you beat
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:16.280]  the guy up you're a bad person that's normal they take normal instincts and they twist them and go
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:21.480]  we should all just torture that's how we'll be a free country no no no no
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:27.560]  it's to get false confessions ladies and gentlemen wish they've done

[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:48.440]  writer greetings josey let me preface this first i have some information i wanted to give to you
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:51.800]  earlier in the week key information but i didn't get a chance because the time ran out
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:59.240]  timing is slow here go ahead nine eleven solved motives corporations profiteers
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:06.600]  forty three minutes long on youtube very well done everyone check that out nine eleven solved
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:17.720]  okay i'll look at it right okay let's look at this you know torture is bad if it is if it is
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:28.520]  overtaken by some bad people but when you look at it when we get ahold of these globalist people
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:36.760]  these bankers that have usurped and destroyed our future destroyed the value of our dollar
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:45.960]  destroyed anything about a american sovereignty i say torture is good at that point let's torture
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:55.160]  them because when bad people face the second judgment and they haven't repented and haven't
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:41:02.440]  had the lord died god in their lives and they haven't accepted jesus christ as their warden
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:07.880]  savior what's going to happen to them they're going to be tortured for eternity no i hear you
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:12.040]  and i appreciate your call you know i get that argument here's the deal i'm not going to lower
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:18.840]  myself to their level and if you convict say david rockefeller of a conspiracy to overthrow the
[01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:26.920]  country create a dictatorship stick them on an island give them life in prison um there's a reason
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.480]  to do that too they won't fight like we were talking earlier about don't torture people they'll
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:36.520]  fight even harder don't not give the globalist a way out of this like you put napoleon on the
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:42.200]  different islands or whatever it's not good to let people know once we get you you're dead
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:47.160]  even with a primitive level it feels good because then they'll just hit the nuclear button

[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:27.320]  mainstream media you want answers government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:38.040]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:49.000]  all right i said i'd play this so we're going to play it i had the article here in front of me
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:55.480]  i'll try to find it right now but it's in uh washington state it's up on info wars dot com if
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:59.080]  you want to see it and we've got the name of the sheriff's department and there's wouldn't
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:02.520]  be a big deal if it hadn't been a whole bunch of the sheriff's departments they say why do you have
[01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:07.560]  these m-rab armored veils well we're getting ready to take fire from the constitutionalists they got
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:11.720]  guns and they're just getting ready for a civil war which hadn't even started yet but they're
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:16.520]  going to stage terror attacks to get the local cops believing all this to march off to war to kill
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:22.120]  each other that's been one of my prime internal directives to expose this there's the headline
[01:48:22.120 --> 01:48:27.880]  police armored military vehicles needed for constitutionalists with firearms that's in
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:32.520]  washington state if you scroll down i give people the county but they're in the article
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:37.640]  that's a spokane valley uh let's go ahead and play this short clip and i'll go back to your calls
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:43.880]  nice thing about this piece of equipment is that if somebody here is directing fire toward a team
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:48.680]  who's trying to get in they can do safely can't they can pull right up to a front of them
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:54.680]  take enemy fire and still try to address the threat without being fear of getting shot
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:59.000]  so i'm thinking that it's totally appropriate in iraq but we're what kind of a situation in the
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:03.400]  u.s would you see that happening i mean we've got a lot of constitutionalists a lot of people that
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:09.240]  it's not called weapons a lot of a lot of ammunition i mean we've got a lot of constitutionalists a
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:14.120]  lot of people that it's not called weapons a lot of a lot of ammunition they have and they have
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:23.000]  no weapons here locally oh no they have weapons here locally and yeah if you declare all the kids
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.760]  belong to government and everybody's gotta go to a work camp like bill airs taught obama to do
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.560]  bill airs by the way is challenging me to a debate we're gonna do it the next few weeks i mean just
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:37.800]  listen the government wants all the guns it's illegitimate and it says we're bad having them
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:44.360]  do you have a few right wing nutbags gonna shoot stuff up yeah less dangerous than honeybees they
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:49.160]  killed 200 something a year right wingers kill a couple dozen i don't want to kill all the honeybees
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:54.840]  because they kill people sometimes what's dangerous is the pharmaceuticals what's dangerous is the
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:59.800]  vaccines what's dangerous is the high fructose corn syrup what's dangerous is the fluoride
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.400]  that's killing millions of people a year it's worse than tobacco
[01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.480]  and i'm sick of it they got all the cops and special operations police just ready for war
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:16.200]  are you guys smart enough to see the big picture i know a lot of you are but this isn't a game they're
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:22.680]  getting ready to start it i'm gonna say this again i'm staying out of the whole thing they blow
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:27.720]  something up blaming on me like they blame rush limbaugh for oklahoma city remember that within
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:33.000]  25 minutes they blamed him and the very people that blamed rush limbaugh and talk radio were the
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:38.840]  ones that did it i'm not gonna reopen that can of worms i've interviewed the cops the firefighters
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:44.840]  the medical workers the generals everybody i mean we know who blew up oklahoma city and let me tell
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:51.400]  you it was called justice department and atf and cops would expose it and the and the government
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:55.480]  would come in their office and say you and your wife are going to be dead if you don't shut your
[01:50:55.480 --> 01:51:03.320]  mouth don browning other police officers have come on this show via video Skype and said
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:09.240]  and let me tell you don browning veteran vietnam highly decorated turned white when i asked him i
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:14.600]  said go ahead and say their names you know why he turned white because despite all his incredible
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:19.320]  courage he realized how dangerous it was and said the names and he stuck his chest out and said their
[01:51:19.320 --> 01:51:26.200]  names on air that's what this show is all about i'm sticking my chest out and if i get crushed doing
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:33.720]  this i asked for it because i'm a man i'm not a coward and never forget it i'm not signing on to
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:39.560]  this evil ever and all of you people that want to serve it go straight to hell because you're not
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:45.240]  getting my soul you understand that and the minute you sign on to this you sign your soul over so i'm
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:50.600]  here to make sure everybody knows exactly what's going on so you can choose a side that's all god
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:59.720]  wants john in colorado you're on the air go ahead alex uh let's say you're going down and it's
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:06.200]  interesting you brought up the 97 bombing because i got in trouble yeah anyway let's say you're going
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:12.040]  down the street the cop pulls you over he says roll down the window and then he basically
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.920]  does anything he wants to do with you that's what it is when you sanction torture
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.320]  yeah pain compliance and the threat continuum they teach cops they can torture you to follow
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:29.720]  orders which is not true if the officer's life is not in danger it's a misappropriation and you're
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:38.920]  absolutely right let me put it to you this way um when the government the state sanctions that it's
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:48.840]  okay for this huge amog amalgamation of whatever agency to come down on one person and do whatever
[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:59.160]  they want to them and then say um um oh yeah there we had we did we did make a few mistakes um and he
[01:52:59.160 --> 01:53:04.840]  was a terrorist after we charged him for five years he confessed everything it's it's bull when
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:11.720]  north korea does it and it's bull when we do it and the minute we sign on to it we've lost our souls
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:20.280]  anything else i think you said it all there brother patricia in arizona you're on the air welcome
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:28.840]  hi go ahead welcome these people were really upsetting me because i want to process for not

[01:53:33.160 --> 01:53:38.040]  tomorrow it's just like cop killers saying a cop beat me up so i'm gonna go shoot a random cop
[01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:42.840]  i guess it's the exact same thing you don't just take people's rights away whoever they are
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:48.840]  they need to ask themselves what if it was their kids who got picked up and they were being accused
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:53.640]  of something that that that they knew they didn't do are they still going to feel that way that it's
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:54:00.680]  okay for them to just torture them till they confess you know no no this is so wrong remember
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:06.280]  that new york case where they there was a fight at a bar so the cops grabbed like six people
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:11.720]  and then they sodomized one with a broken toilet plunger and he said like six hours how do you
[01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:17.400]  sit there sodomizing someone for six hours with a toilet plunger and the cops admitted they did it
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:25.240]  i mean what type of freaks do stuff like that remember that case no but i'm glad because i
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:30.040]  don't want to ever have that image in my mind i think i forget the name guys google new york
