[00:00.000 --> 00:14.000]  ðŸŽµ
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  ðŸŽµ All the times I've come ðŸŽµ
[00:18.000 --> 00:24.000]  ðŸŽµ Fear for down there again ðŸŽµ
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  ðŸŽµ Seasons don't feel the breeze but ðŸŽµ
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  ðŸŽµ Not to the wind, the sun or the rain ðŸŽµ
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  ðŸŽµ We can be right there ðŸŽµ
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.000]  ðŸŽµ Come on baby ðŸŽµ
[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  ðŸŽµ Don't feel the breeze but ðŸŽµ
[00:38.000 --> 00:39.000]  ðŸŽµ Baby take my hand ðŸŽµ
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  ðŸŽµ Don't feel the breeze but ðŸŽµ
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  ðŸŽµ We'll be able to fly ðŸŽµ

[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  ðŸŽµ Baby I'm the man ðŸŽµ
[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000]  I was told by our law enforcement sources that he shot several cops
[00:53.000 --> 00:59.000]  and security personnel who just left at that
[00:59.000 --> 01:07.000]  and I of course said there were shots going off before the main attack on the crowds
[01:07.000 --> 01:12.000]  and you can clearly hear the shots going on 35-40 seconds before
[01:12.000 --> 01:20.000]  a different cyclical rate and then the heavier gun go off right above Mandalay Bay
[01:20.000 --> 01:25.000]  right where they say shots were coming from caught by the taxi driver
[01:25.000 --> 01:27.000]  and there's countless videos of this
[01:27.000 --> 01:29.000]  and why am I opening the broadcast up with this today
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  nine days after one of the worst terror attacks in our country's history
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.000]  it's because they're doing two big things
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  they're having Newsweek take the lead on this information
[01:42.000 --> 01:44.000]  while at the same time quietly letting the truth out
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  so that as more comes out they don't get burned too bad
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.000]  they're running big headline articles in Newsweek
[01:52.000 --> 01:55.000]  and a bunch of other places saying Alex Jones claims there was a second shooter
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  and here's his proof from Monday where you can hear the gun going off
[01:59.000 --> 02:01.000]  it looks like a muzzle flash
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.000]  but by the end of the day we found other videos it was a strobe light
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  and we said okay we were speculating there
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  we're trying to find out what really happened like everybody else is doing
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  that's totally normal
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  they ran it today
[02:16.000 --> 02:24.000]  and a bunch of publications like I just said it this week
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  when I said it last week
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  this is just amazing how deceptive these people are
[02:32.000 --> 02:34.000]  no wonder it's hard for folks to figure out what's going on
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000]  because I can't even keep track of their lies anymore
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.000]  and then here's the big takeaway
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  they now come out and completely contradict their official story
[02:47.000 --> 02:53.000]  and basically admit okay ISIS may be involved
[02:53.000 --> 02:57.000]  Newsweek has an article now looking at it and maybe they are
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  remember we said that day one from our sources
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  but even bigger
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  Newsweek LA Times usual suspects
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  Las Vegas gunman shot security guard a full six minutes
[03:07.000 --> 03:16.000]  before opening fire on concert goers police revealed
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  what have we been telling you what have witnesses said
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  they've said other people were shot guns were going on before
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  you've got casinos a mile away with a report and glass shot out shell casings
[03:28.000 --> 03:32.000]  cops jumping on top of people saying get down everybody locked down
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  I mean this is all going on there's all sorts of gunfire
[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  and they're not telling folks I guess they don't want to scare people
[03:40.000 --> 03:43.000]  away from these tourist destinations or whatever
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  that this was an ISIS attack just like they do to casinos in the Middle East
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  just like they do in India to shopping districts and entertainment districts
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  I mean this goes on all the time in other parts of the world
[03:56.000 --> 04:00.000]  you've got the Kenya attacks on shopping malls
[04:00.000 --> 04:05.000]  over and over again this is what ISIS does this is what Al Qaeda does
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  and we have real sources now could the sources be lying to us absolutely
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  but they've been good sources so far these are real sources
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  the media is like Jones claims he has ballistics experts too but doesn't name him
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  oh like Craig Sawyer that led major teams and still team six
[04:19.000 --> 04:22.000]  and is a top ballistics expert with national TV shows
[04:22.000 --> 04:26.000]  and who's a top federal
[04:26.000 --> 04:28.000]  expert witness that testifies in federal court
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  and a federal marshal
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.000]  they just ignore when we have the sources on
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  and Craig can't get into all his sources he said no you're dead on the right track
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  but I can't tell you
[04:43.000 --> 04:45.000]  but he says everybody's going the right direction
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  I mean they know folks they've been ordered to cover it up
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  and I think President Trump is wrong in doing this
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  now I may be proving wrong down the road stay with us
[05:24.000 --> 05:28.000]  another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation proof bunker
[05:28.000 --> 05:32.000]  there are still very effective low-tech low-cost things you can do to prepare
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.000]  in fact even realizing that there's a need to prepare
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  things that you do prepare for an Armageddon scenario
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  will help you to weather storms to absorb an economic shock
[05:46.000 --> 05:48.000]  or to protect you from home invasion
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others
[05:52.000 --> 05:54.000]  and work for the best case scenario
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  get more information at infowars.com
[05:57.000 --> 06:23.000]  I'm David Knight
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  so 10-11 days ago
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  on October 1st we told you
[06:38.000 --> 06:45.000]  that our sources revealed to us that there were major ISIS connections to the Las Vegas shooter
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  now by Monday it became clear from our White House sources
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  that the national security apparatus has asked the president not to release this information
[06:55.000 --> 07:00.000]  because ISIS was planning this attack with codes built into it
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.000]  to trigger massive sleeper cell attacks across the United States
[07:04.000 --> 07:08.000]  that we'd even been predicting would coincide with the Antifa uprisings
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  that are now beginning
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.000]  we also reported that there were gunshots going off before the main attack
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  and that we were told police officers and security personnel were shot before and after
[07:22.000 --> 07:25.000]  and so that we weren't being given the full story
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.000]  and that there were other engagements around town
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  and now there's countless videos of folks huddling inside hotels saying
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  we've been told to get down their shell casings window shot out
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  and they're a mile away
[07:38.000 --> 07:40.000]  and then everybody in the hotel gets their room free
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  there's video of all this
[07:42.000 --> 07:43.000]  we've already played it
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  I'll probably play it again today
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  now Newsweek while simultaneously repeating everything media matters
[07:51.000 --> 07:54.000]  puts out everything George Soros says
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  that the mouth of George Soros
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  the mouth of Chuck E. Schumer is Jimmy Kimmel
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  this is admitted
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  Newsweek is the mouth of Soros as well
[08:05.000 --> 08:08.000]  and they've been putting out total disinformation saying
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  I'm saying the shooting didn't happen
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  saying that I'm saying O.J. Simpson was involved
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  never said that
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  they're basically claiming Batboy was found at the White House and I'm saying it
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.000]  I'm not saying any of that
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  you know what I've really said
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  and they're scared of it
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  I mean last Tuesday they were attacking me saying
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  Jones says ISIS took responsibility
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  which they didn't
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  yes they did
[08:36.000 --> 08:37.000]  now get ready for it
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  here they are covering their butts today
[08:42.000 --> 08:43.000]  this is so huge
[08:43.000 --> 08:49.000]  if ISIS was behind Las Vegas shooting there's a terrifying reason it won't prove it yet
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  and Newsweek's Tom O'Connor goes on to say
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  sleeper cells inside the U.S.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  exactly what I told you on Monday
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  from the White House source
[08:59.000 --> 09:02.000]  exactly what Paul Rotzen wrote about
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  exactly what Matt Drudge linked to
[09:04.000 --> 09:05.000]  there it is
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  see
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  lead follower get out of the way Newsweek
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  now let me give you more
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  we told you people reported shots going on before the main barrages
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  plus we have the video
[09:19.000 --> 09:20.000]  oh
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  LA Times
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  Las Vegas gunman shot security guard
[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  a full six minutes before opening fire
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  on concert doors police reveal
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  I don't want to be this right
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  I don't want to be this on target
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.000]  but the truth is they're trying to cover this up
[09:38.000 --> 09:40.000]  and the sheriff has come out and done as much as he can
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  saying clearly there's no way this guy acted alone
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  he said that last Thursday
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.000]  and they've said we're looking at radicalization
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  but we can't talk about the evidence yet but
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  looks like some people may have helped him
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  that's from what they found in the room okay
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  so
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  he could have been a patsy because the media acts like I'm changing stories
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  we don't know exactly what happened
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  we know so much we know the official stories collapse
[10:09.000 --> 10:11.000]  we know so far it's collapsed
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  highlights everywhere we were right
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  but then yeah he could have been a gun runner
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  oh we told you he went to the Middle East first
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  we told you the girlfriend went there first
[10:22.000 --> 10:23.000]  the live-in
[10:23.000 --> 10:26.000]  we told you that there were hotel receipts first
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  4chan found them but we published them checked them
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  drug linked to it that was all pretty correct
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  we told you there was a woman in there days before
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  we told you that
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  she was there
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  earlier and that he was there three days earlier
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  all of that's been confirmed
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  the official story down the line
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.000]  from top to bottom
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  up one side and down the other is not true
[10:58.000 --> 11:02.000]  now I've seen certain characters out there
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  floating the idea that nobody got shot I've watched
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  45 minutes or more of different cell phone
[11:09.000 --> 11:15.000]  and rescuer footage and EMT footage it's real
[11:15.000 --> 11:18.000]  it's real there's plenty of splattered heads and splattered legs
[11:18.000 --> 11:20.000]  and people say well some of them aren't splattered
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  I've shot wild hogs deer elk
[11:25.000 --> 11:28.000]  you name it with high-powered rifles in the head
[11:28.000 --> 11:31.000]  many times and it just goes in and a little bit of hole comes out
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  sometimes it blows the whole side of the head off
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  so these arguments that all these people aren't completely splattered
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  is pure malarkey
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  I shot one of those giant African antelopes
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  I forget the names of them
[11:48.000 --> 11:50.000]  in the head and it just went in and went out
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  the thing kept going and then my son was with me
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  and pulled the trigger and hit it through one eye
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  and out the other no eyes and it kept going
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  that's how tough they are and there was like no holes
[12:00.000 --> 12:03.000]  when we went over there
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  I don't mean to get into graphic hunting stuff
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.000]  but the whole point is is that anybody that shot big pieces of meat
[12:10.000 --> 12:15.000]  knows that ballistics do different things
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  and I've watched the footage there's plenty of splattered people
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  with heads all flayed out
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  it was real folks you can't copy the footage I saw
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  so we've caught them red-handed covering up multiple shooters
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  or at least them doing shooting at different times
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  ISIS connections all of it
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  it's all coming out in spades in triplicate
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  they don't even know what to do in MSM
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  and so their hope is to say nobody died
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  so the media can then pick up on that
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  and then get the families to come out
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  and get really upset on television
[12:49.000 --> 12:51.000]  that's the plan
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  and I'm not going along with it so that's the way it is
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  I will not watch the footage again
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  and I will not show it
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  if you want to go find it online it's there
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  there's hours of it
[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  I've only watched 45 minutes of it
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  and had nightmares
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  and because I have children and I have daughters especially
[13:09.000 --> 13:12.000]  and I just don't like seeing young women dying
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.000]  some of the footage is them dying, gulping
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.000]  and you see their eyes go from clear and alive to dead
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  it's real, it's real, it's real
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  it's real, real, real, real, real, real
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  it's okay to question because they lied about babies and incubators
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  and they lied about WMDs, they lied about other massacres
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  it's happened before
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  and it's okay to question things
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  but once the evidence comes out
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  and it's incontrovertible
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  you know it's a diversion
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  they don't do big-staged events with 23,000 people
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  and then just have a bunch of shots go off
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  and then have some, oh quote, crisis actors
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  58 of them, 59 of them
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  no, ladies and gentlemen, you can't cover it up
[13:53.000 --> 13:57.000]  at all the hospitals, you can't cover up something that big
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  you can't do it
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  so that's where I stand on that
[14:04.000 --> 14:07.000]  but that itself is a diversion from what I just told you
[14:07.000 --> 14:10.000]  Las Vegas gunman shot security guard
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  a full six minutes before opening fire on concert guards
[14:13.000 --> 14:18.000]  they've been covering that up for 10 days
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  think about the magnitude of that
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  and that's a bunch of others
[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  we've got countless videos of people with their old huddling
[14:24.000 --> 14:26.000]  and they're saying, oh my god, there's glass
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  get out of here, show casings
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  so, ladies and gentlemen
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  they lied about when he checked in
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  we have all the proof they've not denied that now
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  they've been told to lie
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  and now they're saying, okay, it looks like
[14:39.000 --> 14:41.000]  it may be ISIS in Newsweek
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  and that's because they know they're not going to be able to cover it up
[14:44.000 --> 14:47.000]  because law enforcement isn't going along with it
[14:47.000 --> 14:49.000]  and when it comes out
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  it's one of my main criticism of Trump now
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  that and saying he's against WikiLeaks
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  when WikiLeaks probably got him elected more than anybody
[14:56.000 --> 14:58.000]  more than info wars in our audience
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  really, it's 50-50, but you know, Drudge, it's all in there
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  a constellation that brought Trump the win
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  of the populist resistance
[15:04.000 --> 15:06.000]  but I get you don't want them and they tell you
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.000]  Mr. President, there's a code
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  and they're going to launch ISIS attacks everywhere
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  wherever you air this
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  I don't buy that, that's the left
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  and the globalist inside the FBI
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  trying to get the truth from coming out
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  so they can score political points
[15:16.000 --> 15:18.000]  just like they did for weeks and weeks
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  in Puerto Rico
[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  blocking
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  the aid
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  getting there and the teamsters sitting on it
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  so they can have the biggest disaster possible
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  to blame America
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  it's the same crud
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  and I'm not going along with it
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  it's October ladies and gentlemen
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  November 5th, they claim they're launching their
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  communist uprising
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  this is the final countdown
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  how many days are we out now
[15:44.000 --> 15:46.000]  how many days
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  how many days, 25 days
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.000]  until they launch
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  Bolshevik Revolution Number 2
[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  but this time it's America
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  and we're ready, dug in
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  and we will defeat them

[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  now news week
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  Associated Press and others are reporting
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  it might be an ISIS attack
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  after all
[20:38.000 --> 20:40.000]  and then ISIS is sitting on top
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  to prove because they just want to embarrass
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  the establishment
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.000]  that's a cover story folks
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  the point is
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  is that they're now having to admit that
[20:52.000 --> 20:54.000]  oh the supposed shooter shot a security guard
[20:54.000 --> 20:56.000]  six minutes before
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  the whole story
[20:58.000 --> 21:00.000]  has blown up
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  in everybody's face
[21:02.000 --> 21:04.000]  who pushed it
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  just watch as more unfolds
[21:06.000 --> 21:08.000]  because it's
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  an adventure
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  all reality
[21:12.000 --> 21:14.000]  that we're all living together
[21:14.000 --> 21:16.000]  it's not a drill
[21:16.000 --> 21:18.000]  and you live only once
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  this is the real deal
[21:20.000 --> 21:22.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  well
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  Mr. Weinstein is in a lot of trouble
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  and we're now learning
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  that the media
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  was only
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  putting out the sexual
[21:36.000 --> 21:38.000]  harassment stories
[21:38.000 --> 21:40.000]  because they knew a bigger
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  story was about to break
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  in the New Yorker magazine
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  and they knew this two weeks ago
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  so the same New York Times that spiked
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  the report
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  in
[21:52.000 --> 21:54.000]  2004
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.000]  and in 2008
[21:56.000 --> 21:58.000]  and in 2012
[21:58.000 --> 22:00.000]  that's all confirmed
[22:00.000 --> 22:02.000]  the same
[22:02.000 --> 22:04.000]  CNN that spiked it
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  the same Matt Damon
[22:06.000 --> 22:08.000]  and other usual suspects
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  that went to bat for him and helped cover it up
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.000]  because they're so liberal
[22:12.000 --> 22:14.000]  told you I know folks behind the scenes
[22:14.000 --> 22:16.000]  Matt Damon all those guys
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  it's a total joke the global warming all of it
[22:18.000 --> 22:20.000]  they all listen to this show
[22:20.000 --> 22:22.000]  by the way I can care less
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  and they all know what's really going on
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  but they're just totally
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  mercenary and stand
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  for nothing but themselves
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  they are the whores of the whores
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  all of them and it's all coming out
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  but as I and Cernovich
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.000]  said here last week
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  why is all this breaking so big now
[22:40.000 --> 22:42.000]  we said our gut is
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  the very media outlets that covered it up
[22:44.000 --> 22:46.000]  like the New York Times are now breaking it
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.000]  to minimize it
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  and make it about
[22:50.000 --> 22:52.000]  simply hitting on women
[22:52.000 --> 22:54.000]  and cheating on his wife
[22:54.000 --> 22:56.000]  this in pedophile devil worship
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  central Hollywood
[22:58.000 --> 23:00.000]  and the Clintons are still silent
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  but now we know
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.000]  ladies and gentlemen
[23:04.000 --> 23:06.000]  it's women saying he raped them
[23:08.000 --> 23:10.000]  and that's what it's all about when you make women
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  come in and see you showering
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  and make it all about you
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  serious pervert behavior
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  it's trying to creep women out
[23:20.000 --> 23:22.000]  and then forcing yourself on them
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  it's
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  cucking the women
[23:28.000 --> 23:30.000]  so now the New Yorker magazine
[23:30.000 --> 23:32.000]  from aggressive overtures to sexual assault
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  Harry Weinstein's accusers
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  tell their stories
[23:36.000 --> 23:38.000]  and here's the deal
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  whether it's true or not and I tend to believe it
[23:40.000 --> 23:42.000]  with the Hollywood slime types
[23:42.000 --> 23:44.000]  it's all part of the same slime bucket
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  and it's what everybody wallowed into
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  so it's a bunch of vampires
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  eating each other
[23:50.000 --> 23:52.000]  I mean there's some truth to
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  hey you know what you're getting into
[23:54.000 --> 23:56.000]  when you go to Hollywood
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  it's like walking down the alley
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  in the worst part of town at midnight
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  and getting freaked out when you get mugged
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  but still the muggers are more to blame
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  they actually carried out the criminal act
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  now some of the young
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  16 year old girls that watch TV all day
[24:10.000 --> 24:12.000]  think they're going to be movie stars
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  they go oh yeah come to California you're going to be movie stars
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  know what you're going to be is a crack whore
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  and when they're done using you up they're going to put you in a snuff film
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  for European consumption
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  they're going to torture you to death
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  because the truth is
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  the child porn stuff is just mid-level
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  the torture porn
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  the murder porn
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  well that's king in Hollywood
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  there were hundreds of VHS tapes
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  caught being shipped about
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  30 years ago out of Italy
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  it was a big national Italian television show
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  exposed it to Hollywood
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  and men were paying
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  $50,000 a piece for the VHS tapes
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  only
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  a few of them again sent out
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  of toddlers being raped
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  and then having their brains blown out afterwards
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  just thought you might want to know what these folks are into
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  so if you think hitting on
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  women at restaurants
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  and having a different girlfriend every day
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  is what this is all about thinking in
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  of course they're going after him
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  too full
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  to cover up the really big stuff
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  and to make it
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  about a men's war on women
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  and sell the west has a rape culture
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  when Islam doesn't
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  and created bigger war between the sexes
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  before they level their guns on
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  Trump
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  so everybody knows the left's hypocritical
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  and protecting the Clintons
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  that's why the smarter left is now turning
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  on the Clintons they're going to destroy the Clintons
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  they're going to destroy Weinstein
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  and then they're going to roll women out that say
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  Trump raped them and there'll be such a
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  furor and such a fury
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  that this will be the scandal
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  they believe will bring down Trump
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  it all crystallized this morning
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  I was reading all the news and looking at it
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  and watch it's going to happen
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  because I'm bright-eyed
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  bushy tailed
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  and I've already seen their playbooks before
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  and part of this is the chai comms
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  who are trying to buy up the
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  foreign Islamic owned
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  connections and control
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  Miramax's film studio
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  Weinstein wasn't playing
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  along but his brother wanted to do it, that's known
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  and so you just
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  take him off, take control of the company
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  have a big controversy
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  distract everybody from the stuff that was already
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  going to come out to begin with
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  and then turn it against
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  Trump and I
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  had already thought that this morning and then sure enough
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  I saw the headlines
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  from all the usual suspects in Hollywood
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  okay Weinstein's bad but
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Trump's worse, he's an abuser
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  he's a rapist
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  and they always misrepresent what I've said
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  about this on the Joe Rogan podcast
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  even in my family court deal
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  they edited it and played a clip of where
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  we said it's terrible what Trump said
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  I wouldn't say it or do it
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  but it's not like you're jumping out of the bushes grabbing women
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  he's saying if a woman's climbing up on top of you
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  you can grab them
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  they're that aggressive
[27:04.000 --> 27:06.000]  so it's uncouth, it's not a good thing for a father to do
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  we all agreed, Joe Rogan and myself any bravo
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  that was a five minute discussion
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  it was edited down to saying it's not rape
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  if a woman's already coming on to you
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  to grab them because they're grabbing you
[27:16.000 --> 27:18.000]  I mean is it rape when a woman grabs you?
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  because if that's the case, man I've been raped a lot
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  a lot
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  no it's not, if it's consensual it's there
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  then if they say no don't do that
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  don't push it, it's still not good for a father
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  a married guy to do, it's wrong
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  but it's not rape
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  and then that turns into, oh Alex Jones is defending
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  Trump's rape
[27:36.000 --> 27:38.000]  it's not rape
[27:38.000 --> 27:40.000]  if you're on a
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.000]  tour bus bragging to your buddy, man I'm so popular now
[27:42.000 --> 27:44.000]  women throw themselves on me
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  you can do whatever you want
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  yeah, that's the whole point
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  and I don't like it
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  and that was Trump ten years ago, eleven years ago
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  and he's apologized for it
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  a lot, but most importantly he's delivered
[27:56.000 --> 27:58.000]  on what he said he would do
[27:58.000 --> 28:00.000]  politically to a great extent
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  Steven Bannon
[28:02.000 --> 28:04.000]  and Info Wars and Drudge and all of us together
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  doing a great job trying to keep the Republicans
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  on the straight and narrow and we come back
[28:08.000 --> 28:10.000]  we'll get into that in the big North Korean news
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  but
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  Bannon, myself, everybody are declaring war
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  Info War
[28:16.000 --> 28:18.000]  on the Republic of Establishment
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  their numero uno enemy
[28:20.000 --> 28:22.000]  they're the ones working with the Democrats
[28:22.000 --> 28:24.000]  making the agenda to make America free and great again
[28:24.000 --> 28:26.000]  they are target number one
[28:26.000 --> 28:28.000]  the Democrats have pulled some briar patch
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  stuff where
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  they over give a little bit of money against the candidates
[28:32.000 --> 28:34.000]  you know, we agree with Bannon
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  to take them out, that's to make conservatives
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  think Bannon's a Democrat
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  and to think, oh we better be against Bannon
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  because the Democrats have teamed up with him
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  that's total, please don't throw me in that
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  briar patch, that's exactly
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  what they want, so that's more shill operations
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  by them, we'll be back
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  and if the Democratic Party says army must be ready

[33:34.000 --> 33:36.000]  going to get into the North Korea situation
[33:36.000 --> 33:38.000]  the latest developments there and then into
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  the amazing job that Stephen Bannon is doing
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  as well as
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  Ted Cruz I was really mad at during the campaign
[33:44.000 --> 33:46.000]  but he's really been doing a good job when it comes to
[33:46.000 --> 33:48.000]  policy I guess he just gets
[33:48.000 --> 33:50.000]  underhanded nasty when he's trying to get the presidency
[33:50.000 --> 33:52.000]  but we're going to be looking at all that
[33:52.000 --> 33:54.000]  but make no mistake with this whole
[33:54.000 --> 33:56.000]  Weinstein
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  debacle
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  now with women saying he raped him
[34:00.000 --> 34:02.000]  and I have no doubt
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  guy's a pig
[34:04.000 --> 34:06.000]  he wants to rape America
[34:06.000 --> 34:08.000]  he's a globalist
[34:08.000 --> 34:10.000]  he's proven what he's into
[34:10.000 --> 34:12.000]  but know this
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  they're only doing it because they know
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  America isn't buying going after
[34:16.000 --> 34:18.000]  Trump for any sexual stuff that's been
[34:18.000 --> 34:20.000]  claiming to be illegal
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.000]  Trump for any sexual stuff that's been
[34:22.000 --> 34:24.000]  claimed because of the Clintons and the rest of it
[34:24.000 --> 34:26.000]  and so I've seen major moves
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  where the establishment is getting ready to flush
[34:28.000 --> 34:30.000]  the Clintons
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  but as soon as that's done they're coming for Trump
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  they realize that
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  Trump's approval rating
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  isn't just up six points the last two weeks
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  they have a
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.000]  15% manipulation in how they do the polls
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  9 to 15 sometimes higher
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  and so Trump is 9 to 15 points
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  higher than what they're saying
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  Trump's closer to 60%
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  or higher as I keep explaining to everybody
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  just like I said
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  during the campaign and it came out
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.000]  indeed Google knew, Facebook
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  knew, they've got algorithms
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  let me explain something
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  10 years ago it came out that major
[35:06.000 --> 35:08.000]  travel websites
[35:08.000 --> 35:10.000]  had cookies
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  that knew where you traveled and what you did
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.000]  in an algorithm and so
[35:14.000 --> 35:16.000]  you had to unload your cookies and I would tell folks
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  booking flights here
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  I'd say you notice that flight cost so much
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  unload your cookies, go in on a new browser
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  and they'd be like it's incredible
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  this flight was $2,000
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  now it's $800
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  first class would be $15,000
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  in England and I'd say
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  now go in
[35:34.000 --> 35:36.000]  without the cookies
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  showing we've flown to England before and see what it is
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  it would be $4,000
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  this is an example
[35:42.000 --> 35:44.000]  that had been in the news 10 years ago
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  it's not like I discovered that
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  it's far worse
[35:48.000 --> 35:50.000]  I'll tell my wife if she's shopping on a big shopping cart
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  I go honey, did you back
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  out of your cookies, did you delete them
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  did you go in the fresh browser, she'll go no, no
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  I'll go watch this and every
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  time the products are
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  lower prices
[36:02.000 --> 36:04.000]  and
[36:04.000 --> 36:06.000]  I was just talking about this
[36:06.000 --> 36:08.000]  talking about that this morning with some of the crew the only reason I bring it up
[36:08.000 --> 36:10.000]  it's just it shows you
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  how digitally
[36:12.000 --> 36:14.000]  it's the same to things are
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  and how people need to be aware of that
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  let me do a plug right now
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  since I
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  brought it up
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  when you go to infoarstore.com
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  the price is the price we announce on air
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  it's the same price you see on the
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  site we don't do stuff
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  like that
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  but you need to be aware of what other people do
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  folks like Walmart and Target
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  will raise the price of one thing one week
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  then they'll say 50% off the next week
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  and you're really getting what the regular
[36:44.000 --> 36:46.000]  price was when I say
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  50% off it's 50%
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  off the regular price
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  at 1996
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  Brainforce are amazing
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  Neutropic for the mind

[37:00.000 --> 37:02.000]  in a healthy way
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  it has 4.6 of
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  5000 plus reviews unheard of
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  power reviews
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  it's really half off
[37:10.000 --> 37:12.000]  at $39 it's $15
[37:12.000 --> 37:14.000]  less than the leading competitor
[37:14.000 --> 37:16.000]  it's already discounted now 20% more
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  so yes you don't just
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  support the very tip of the spear
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  you get high quality
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.000]  products
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  infowarslife.com
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  infowarsstore.com
[37:28.000 --> 37:30.000]  or triple 82533139
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  now I said I was going to
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  probably run this for a month because it sold out last time
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  and I said double the amount we order
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  and then I'm going to discount it even more
[37:38.000 --> 37:40.000]  because we get a better price when we do that
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  and then people will buy more and then we can be more successful
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  and expand the operation they get better
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  products and like us more and it's symbiotic
[37:46.000 --> 37:48.000]  I thought we'd have it for a month
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  and then I could trail off until more came in
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  a month after that at the regular price
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  we may have to stop it in a week
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  we're selling so much of it which is good
[37:58.000 --> 38:00.000]  but we got to sell a lot of it to find the operation
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  so infowarslife.com get your Brainforce Plus
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  because I may have to end it in a couple of days
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  I'll probably end it for sure in a week
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  but I thought sales would start tapering off
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  it's just like insane
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  because it really is a good product and that's good
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  to even discount it more because then you'll try it
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  and really see how great it is
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  because other brain pills and stuff even if they say they're natural
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  they give me headaches you name it
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  we went through a lot of formulas before we decided on this one
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  you may like some other formulas better
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  because it's all kind of a person's taste
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  but listeners really love Brainforce

[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  Biotin B12 taking sublingually

[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  essential oils
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  massively discounted to the highest quality
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  it's all there Alexa Pure Pro
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  this is going to end today 20% off
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  Alexa Pure Breeze 20% off
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  that's going to end today
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  because I'm going to meet with Tim Perger
[39:10.000 --> 39:12.000]  and I'm going to go with the new specials for tomorrow
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  but these have been unprecedented
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  and they end today
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  in FullWarsLife.com
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  and Caveman with a turmeric
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  and all the rest of it
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  it's amazing with the concentrated bone broth
[39:24.000 --> 39:26.000]  that's got to end the next few days
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  and I don't want to sell out of it
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  we don't get more in for a month
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  so it'll go back to the regular price
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  starting tomorrow
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  if I have anything to do with it
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  because it's up to me to do
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  it's my fault so sometimes these specials extend out
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  because I have to move to the new ones
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  so infowarslife.com or
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  and whatever you do realize our local affiliates
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  are king
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  spread the word about them
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  support their sponsors let them know you're supporting them
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  we have millions a year to try to get your guns
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  to try to bankrupt the economy
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  to try to sexualize your children
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  to try to demoralize this nation
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  and try to start a race war
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  so we are effectively
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  writing the narrative against the globalist
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  we're blowing their operations up worldwide
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  we are the tip of the spear
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  we're the guts, the blood, the glory
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  we are you
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  you are the info war
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  and when you financially support us it's very critical
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  and when you support local affiliates
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  the rest is critical
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  so please mark your calendar or whatever
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  tithe the local radio station
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  get high quality products, tithe to this show
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  is your local church fighting the globalist
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  did exposing the pedophile rings
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  did exposing the new world order
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  no they're scared because of 501c3
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  telling they can't be political
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  it's a load of unconstitutional malarkey
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  and trumps overturning it
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  but these churches want to play it safe right into hell
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  now a lot of them are good
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  and if they're good donate to them
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  I wouldn't give another red cent
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  to these name it and claim it glitter bug cults
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  I grew up in Dallas
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  in Rockwall folks right in the middle
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  of some of the biggest names out there
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  okay
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  and I know about these preachers behind the scenes
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  let me tell you
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  I've never seen hookers that look so good
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  so you just need to understand these people
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  got helicopters, they got cocaine
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  and they are partying
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  and they are
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  absolutely think you're a joke
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  okay
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  and that's a whole other area it's just these churches
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  these big giant mega churches are everywhere
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  everyone worships these stupid preachers
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  and they're not doing anything
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  to fight the world
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  government
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  the whole B system
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  these local radio stations fighting
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  and fighting for the trump agenda that is to free up the churches
[41:38.000 --> 41:40.000]  and free up Christians
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  and not let the IRS persecute Christians
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  that's what's important
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  because we don't have the religious freedom
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  the internet censorship is coming down
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  it's not coming down on these little glitter bug churches
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  it's coming down on us
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  and they're going against our local radio station

[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  Dr. Group you developed Living Defense
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  for us it took you over a year to do it
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  why is this so good?
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  because people are actually waking up
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  I mean I try to make sure
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  that I don't put toxins from food
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  and water and beverages in my system
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  but right now we're dealing with
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  massive parasites
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  which is anything that's harmful to your body
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  that gives off a host mechanism
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  right now with all the refugees
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  spreading disease around
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  we have biological warfare going on everywhere
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  these are all parasites
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  you have the neem in there
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  you have the organic clove bud
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  the organic wormwood
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  at least twice a year
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  alright well I'm glad we've got some back in
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  because I'm going back on it today
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  it just came back in yesterday Living Defense
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  period
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  and you support the broadcast
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  infowarslives.com
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  thank you doctor group from the global healing center
[46:56.000 --> 47:24.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  escape from the new world order
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  and we're doing a pretty good job folks
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  as the spell they had over us
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  begins to break
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  well here it is from CNBC
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  NFL owners to consider
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  rule change that would require players
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  to stand for the national anthem
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  there's already a rule
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  but they want to act like they're doing something
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  total deception in that headline
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  but you know what that is
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  a big old fat
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  juicy
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  white flag
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  that they are running up in front of the world
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  after what three weeks ago
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  they chastised the president
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  and they said oh you say it's disrespectful
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  no you disrespect us
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  we are powerful
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  America is a powerful
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  NFL is
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  that's what they said
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  and now their ratings are down 35%
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  this year
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  I'm afraid 20 plus the last three years together
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  that's 55
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  juicies
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  it was 51 or 52%
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  just last week
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  but it slid more
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  so see
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  we're breaking Hollywood's back
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  we've broken CNN's back
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  we're breaking the ridiculous NFL's back
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  because now America's awake
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  and breaking with the enemy
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  everywhere now the new world order is admitted
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  everywhere I'm going to go to Bannon first in North Korea
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  now
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  all the things they denied
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  it's all out in the open now
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  and they don't know what to do
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  they don't know how to respond
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  so they're in full
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  panic mode we guys give me another video
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  unless I can't find it thank you
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  this is an amazing time to be alive
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  right now
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  it doesn't mean we're offering some utopia
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  doesn't mean what's going to come after this is going to be perfect
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  but the globalist parasites
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  they thought they set up a world government
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  in secret
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  and thought that there's no way
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  that anybody
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  could ever
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  stop them
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  and they could just sit there
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  and stonewall
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  the entire time
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  the hoax is over
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  the hoax is falling
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  they don't know what to do
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  and along comes Stephen Bannon
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  and says we're in a fight with the new world order
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  we're in a fight with globalist
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  and America's coming back
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  for the number one enemies the republican establishment
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  who's been saying that for years
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  and now we're that close to hauling them out
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  and everywhere we look
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  we're having victory
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  so let's start here
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  let's start here
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  with Bannon declares war
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  on republican establishment
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  and Hannity is all for it
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  see this is watching
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  our movement of Americana
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  go from being ridiculed and denied
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  to now taking over the republican party
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  vanquishing Hollywood
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  vanquishing the NFL
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  vanquishing
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  and Trump's just our front man
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  he falls the wayside or is killed
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  we're sad that happens
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  the taste of victory
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  nothing succeeds
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  like success
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  nothing gives victory like victory
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  the more you win
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  the more you win
[50:54.000 --> 50:56.000]  that's why the enemy is always saying you don't have any power
[50:56.000 --> 50:58.000]  you're nothing
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  telling you you're defeated to demoralize you
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  the ghost to the old republic
[51:02.000 --> 51:04.000]  is rising again
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  the renaissance the electricity of human freedom
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  the burning in the hearts
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  and minds of men and women everywhere
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  here's Bannon
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  basic agenda that President Trump
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  ran on and won
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.000]  he carried states the republicans
[51:18.000 --> 51:20.000]  haven't carried in living memory
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania
[51:22.000 --> 51:24.000]  this agenda works
[51:24.000 --> 51:26.000]  the American people voted for it
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  it's their responsibility by the way
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  McConnell would not be a majority leader
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  unless Trump in North Carolina
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  in Missouri in Wisconsin
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  incumbent upon them to back President Trump's
[51:36.000 --> 51:38.000]  plan but you don't see it
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  what you saw what Corker said today
[51:40.000 --> 51:42.000]  is what they talk about on Capitol Hill
[51:42.000 --> 51:44.000]  that's when I left the White House remember I said
[51:44.000 --> 51:46.000]  I'm going after the republican establishment
[51:46.000 --> 51:48.000]  and we're going to go after them
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  but you're picking the rock solid
[51:50.000 --> 51:52.000]  credential candidates
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  we're spending a ton of time with the grassroots organizations
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  to make sure that these candidates are fully vetted
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  you're going to see people announced this week
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  they're going to have experience in government
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  you're going to see some outsiders that are authentic
[52:02.000 --> 52:04.000]  there's a beginning of the Tea Party
[52:04.000 --> 52:06.000]  when things are first getting going
[52:06.000 --> 52:08.000]  you're going to see real candidates and by the way
[52:08.000 --> 52:10.000]  they're going to take on incumbents in every state
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  and they're going to take on the democrats after that
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  you said in a 60 minutes interview you're a street fighter
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  I'm a street fighter too
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  I noticed that
[52:18.000 --> 52:20.000]  I'm not supporting any republican
[52:20.000 --> 52:22.000]  incumbent that hasn't gotten their job done
[52:22.000 --> 52:24.000]  not one Steve I refuse
[52:24.000 --> 52:26.000]  they have betrayed the American people
[52:26.000 --> 52:28.000]  they have betrayed their promises
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  how do you make a promise
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  that you have been in a half years and not fulfill it
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  it's a lack of sense of urgency
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  by the way these guys work three days a week
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  the American people now are working two jobs
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  now before I go back to Bannon
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  I'm going to play a Marsha Blackburn clip
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  she put out a video that got seen
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  last time I heard millions and millions of times
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  it was going completely viral
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  the same thing happens to our videos all the time
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  they get 20, 30 million
[52:52.000 --> 52:54.000]  they just take them off Facebook
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  and a lot of times it's just Hillary
[52:56.000 --> 52:58.000]  saying black people are predators
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  it's things they've done
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  they don't want the public to see
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  so Marsha Blackburn as you know was involved
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  exposing Planned Parenthood
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  the selling of baby parts that's a fact
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  she put out this viral video
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  got seen millions of times in one day
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  on Twitter and other platforms
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  and it got taken down off Twitter
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  other videos have been taken down off Facebook
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  I was mentioning what's happened to us
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  so this is what they're scared of
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  a nice clean cut good lady
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  with a good background standing up against
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  keeping babies alive selling their body parts
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  all the things we've talked about
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  so much and now it's in the Washington Post
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  Streisand effect in full effect
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Twitter blocked the Congresswoman's
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  anti-abortion ad over baby body parts
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  but it allowed
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  identical tweet
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  so again they allow people
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  to say they're going to kill Trump and leave that up
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  but you put up a nice video
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  just showing crime statistics by Muslims
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  from the government
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  of Sweden and you have your account
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  deleted or your video deleted
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  this is what they're doing this is the censorship
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.000]  and the fact is that they're taking on
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  congressional candidates
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  catapults her into the lead
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  it blows up in their face
[54:06.000 --> 54:08.000]  people say they keep censoring us
[54:08.000 --> 54:10.000]  I'm going to leave YouTube
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  and I go don't leave fight
[54:12.000 --> 54:14.000]  show it's a fraud
[54:14.000 --> 54:16.000]  show it's selective show it's discriminatory
[54:16.000 --> 54:18.000]  and we're doing it
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  and we're winning
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  that's what it's all about
[54:22.000 --> 54:24.000]  we're going to expose them
[54:24.000 --> 54:26.000]  if we fight them when they censor
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  it'll go Streisand effect
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  and blow up in their face
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  and everybody knows what the Streisand effect is
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  it's like a decade ago
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  people were showing her big giant house
[54:36.000 --> 54:38.000]  she tried to suppress it on the internet
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  so it made it the biggest story in the country
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  and that's what they've done
[54:42.000 --> 54:44.000]  so let's go to the censored video
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  that Twitter and others don't want you to see
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  I fought
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  Planned Parenthood
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  God
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  I shoot Skeet
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  have a concealed carry permit for the gun
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  that I do pack in my purse
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  I believe our government
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  spends too much
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  grows too much
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  and is bankrupting our children's future
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  I believe
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  in President Trump's immigration ban
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  and I'll fight with him
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  every step of the way
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  to build that wall
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  I stand for
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  millions of honest Americans
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  who work hard
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  and they play by the rules
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  and I stand for the greatest country
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  the world has ever known
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  I stand
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  when the president walks in the room
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  and yes
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  I stand
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  when I hear the star-spangled banner
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  a great Tennessean
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  who wasn't so politically
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  correct himself once said
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  one man with courage
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  makes a majority
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  courage comes in both genders
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  and I'm running for the U.S. Senate
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  because
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  I'll fight every day
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  to make our Republican majority
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  act like one
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  too much is at stake
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  America needs a conservative
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  revolution and leaders
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  who are willing to fight in it
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  I'm Marcia Blackburn
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  that's why I'm running for the U.S. Senate
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  and I would be honored
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  to have your vote
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  so she comes off very credible
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  very mom-like, very smart, very strong
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  pretty
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  very well-dressed as she has a good background
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  and it just drove the leftist crazy
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  and they said we want this band
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  everybody else can have their ads out there
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  and everybody else errors them and you can see them
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  but you're not allowed to see something wholesome
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  and good and nice
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  that's what Twitter thinks
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  and so they're now going to find out
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  what happens when it blows up
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  in their face
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  and now leaked emails to tell
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  Twitter censorship of Marcia Blackburn's
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  pro-life beliefs
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  yes, insiders from inside Twitter
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  are sick of the censorship and they're going public
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  many of them are liberals but they're not
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  fascist authoritarians
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  who think you can just ban
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  speech in America because you don't like it
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  it's dangerous, I would ever ban the left speech
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  this is a real revolution folks
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  this is against the Republican establishment
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  by a populist movement
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  if the Democrats would have done this themselves
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  they would be in power right now
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  the people want major change
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  and it's coming and it's happening
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  and no amount of staged events
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  no amount of Manchurian candidates
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  no amount of race war funding is going to work
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  people want prosperity
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  and it's not that America is perfect
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  but they're overthrowing it to bring in globalism
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  that's why people are resisting it
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  once globalism is exposed
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  there's no way it's going to exist
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  it's going to be a system's tax exam
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  with diplomatic immunity

[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  that anti-fist democratic socialist and other
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  treasonous groups are fomenting
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  it's important to see their
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.000]  tactics for what they are
[1:00:28.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  anti-fist playbook revealed

[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  anti-fist playbook revealed
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  anti-fist playbook revealed
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:12.080]  rules are being applied. Rule number one, power is not what you have, but what the enemy thinks
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:16.400]  you have. Well, let's be clear that Antifa are not calling on the government to censor anyone.
[1:01:16.400 --> 1:01:20.960]  In fact, that they they resist the notion of turning to the government or turning to the police,
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:25.360]  who we've seen have been infiltrated by white supremacists who have been sympathetic to the
[1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:31.440]  court sort of returned to law and order notion of fascism. And so the idea is the real enemies of
[1:01:31.440 --> 1:01:37.040]  free speech are fascist. We've seen that historically. Number two, never go outside the expertise of
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:44.000]  your people. What about when an Antifa member stabbed a police horse in the neck with a knife?
[1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:52.400]  Was the horse a racist Trump supporter? Yes, so the horse. I didn't know a horse is to vote.
[1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:58.640]  You see, the horse is a tool of the police and police under the Trump administration have been
[1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:05.120]  increasingly intolerant, militarized. Number three, whenever possible, go outside the expertise of
[1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:11.040]  the enemy. You are you are an easy person to display. I mean, no, I'm an easy person to target by
[1:02:11.040 --> 1:02:16.320]  fascists. That's why this organization called Far Left Watch is going through my tweets, finding
[1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:19.600]  tweets from three weeks back. And I don't know if you've gone through my Twitter. Number four,
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:26.640]  make the enemy live up to its own book of rules. Number five, ridicule is man's most potent weapon.
[1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:31.920]  As someone who has cops in my family, I'm offended by that because the people I know who are cops,
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:37.920]  they have kids. Are they immortal? Number six, a good tactic is one your people enjoy. They'll
[1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:42.640]  keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. Hey, my dear, dear friends,
[1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:54.400]  no Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA. Number seven, a tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.
[1:02:54.400 --> 1:03:00.480]  Don't become old news. Number eight, keep the pressure on, never let up. As blood is actually
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:09.120]  reflected in Las Vegas's rising sun, she decides to manipulate the pain, the anger, and directed
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:17.040]  toward lawful gun owners. She tweets, imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer,
[1:03:17.040 --> 1:03:26.240]  which the NRA wants to make easier. Hillary, there's a reason you lost the election. As Americans
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:34.160]  come together, you seek to divide, not sympathize, not empathize, showing just how hollow a tin man
[1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:41.600]  you are. Number nine, the threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself. Number 10, the
[1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:47.760]  major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure
[1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:53.200]  upon the opposition. Number 11, if you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and
[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:58.960]  become a positive. Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:06.480]  sympathizes with the underdog. Every few minutes, somebody gets killed and a certain percentage
[1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:12.400]  are black. Yeah, and nine out of 10 blacks are being killed by blacks. And these Soros handled
[1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:17.520]  groups, their answer is banned guns. Always hear that, you know, the NRA is the new clan because
[1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:22.640]  black people are getting shot in areas where they've banned the guns. Nine out of 10 blacks that are
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:27.520]  shot in this country, look it up, are shot by other black people. Number 12, the price of a
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:33.520]  successful attack is a constructive alternative. Never let the enemy score points because you're
[1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:39.440]  caught without a solution to the problem. Number 13, pick the target, freeze it, personalize it,
[1:04:39.440 --> 1:04:45.600]  and polarize it. White people, white people, not me, because you know what out there? In this,
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:50.000]  in the premises of the university, I deal with microaggressions on a daily as do other people
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:54.240]  of color. And you have people out there wearing hats like those, y'all don't say s**t about it.

[1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:28.960]  Well, riding shotgun with us this hour is one of my great advisors that I consult
[1:06:28.960 --> 1:06:32.960]  here live on air and sometimes privately about what he thinks. He's a former army intelligence
[1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:38.080]  officer that came's highly recommended by smart folks currently in government. But also, I've
[1:06:38.080 --> 1:06:43.520]  been having him on the show for a good 15 years. I was first reading some of his near future novels
[1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:49.920]  20 years ago, really charting different scenarios of America taking back the country peacefully
[1:06:49.920 --> 1:06:55.360]  or violently during a civil war in a fight against globalism. And so now we're beyond
[1:06:55.360 --> 1:07:02.720]  near future. We are in the substantive future here and affecting the battle space of the
[1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:08.400]  near future and medium term future as well. So we'll talk to James,
[1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:12.160]  Leslie Rawls joining us. He also has one of the biggest survival blogs out there is the
[1:07:12.160 --> 1:07:20.000]  survival blog.com. We're going to him in just a moment. But it is unbelievable that they've come
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:24.400]  out in Newsweek with high level government counterterrorism experts saying, you better
[1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:32.160]  watch out because it looks like ISIS might be involved in this. And then you've got other
[1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:38.720]  articles with them changing the timeline saying, okay, he shot six, seven, eight minutes before a
[1:07:38.720 --> 1:07:43.760]  security guard and other stuff went on. Folks, we've got the videos. I've had one of the former
[1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:48.400]  leaders of SEAL Team Six, top ballistics guy in federal court, and he's a federal air marshal.
[1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:53.520]  And it goes on and on. Craig Sawyer on, he's got TV shows on history and discovery channel
[1:07:53.520 --> 1:07:58.960]  where he's a ballistics expert. And he says clearly there's two guns going off the first two and a
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:05.040]  half minutes, which is what witnesses say. And it's down the road in another hotel where witnesses
[1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:11.760]  said there was glass shell casings, people being shot. So there's a cover up. And the media is
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:17.280]  trying to walk it back right now. And their new thing is to say that I said, nobody died there.
[1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:23.600]  I've never said that. I watched the footage when it came out. I'm not watching it again.
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:29.760]  But it's real people. It was really happened. It was very graphic. And as a father, I don't
[1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:33.680]  like watching it because even though the girls were 16, 18 years old, I got a 13 year old
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:38.560]  daughter and it just tears my guts out to watch them dying. Because there's video people dying.
[1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:42.320]  And there's no faking that. There's not enough Academy Awards in the world to fake it.
[1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:46.480]  You see that light go out of somebody's eyes while they're coughing blood up. It's not funny.
[1:08:47.200 --> 1:08:56.000]  Now, there is so much going on on that front. And I've got sources that say they basically know
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.120]  what's going on, but they can't talk to me now. They just put out the leads that
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:05.200]  had ISIS connections, Middle East connections. He did go to the Middle East. We now learn.
[1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:08.880]  We told you that last Monday. We told you first his girlfriend went.
[1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:12.480]  We told you about the receipts and we told you about them there three days before
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:19.760]  and a woman visiting folks. We broke it all. We broke it all. And by we broke it all,
[1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:25.600]  we had a lot of the original first leads and then 4chan and the autistic army. And that's
[1:09:25.600 --> 1:09:29.520]  what they call themselves. They call themselves autistic in a nice way, meaning they're so obsessed
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:35.440]  with the knowledge that 4chan and the internet and Reddit, the Donald get half the credit.
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:39.600]  And then the other researchers on the web and ensure info wars, but it's not about credit.
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:43.440]  The media takes me on as the lead elephant to try to discredit me.
[1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:48.240]  And then it tries to attach things to what I've said to cover up the real evidence.
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:52.880]  So we're going to cover this now because James Wesley Rawls has been predicting that this is
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:57.680]  all coming. The Antifa would quickly morph into a merger with Islamic groups and become
[1:09:57.680 --> 1:10:02.640]  like the weathermen meets Islam, meets radical orthodox Islam. And at the bottom of the hour,
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:06.400]  we'll do North Korea and Mattis, the culprits of the storm, saying that that the army must
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:12.160]  have all options on the table and speaking to the army. That's coming up. But you've got,
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:17.760]  I mean, here's Newsweek. If ISIS was behind the Las Vegas attack, there's a terrifying reason it
[1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:23.440]  hasn't proven it. And they get into letting the government deny it and then showing it later
[1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:28.240]  or and or they have sleeper cells that are going to be activated when they release the next video,
[1:10:28.240 --> 1:10:31.920]  which is what we were told by our White House source. And we had that out and
[1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:36.800]  drugs linked to that on Monday. So this is real folks. I mean, you know,
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:45.040]  the media goes, Jones claims he has former Navy SEAL ballistics experts. They know Craig was
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:50.480]  on stand that last week and they know our other sources are real. They know that they know full
[1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:57.360]  well we gave the president the information on our Pio. He looks at Drudge all the time on his phone,
[1:10:57.360 --> 1:11:01.360]  but he's more obsessed with the New York Times, which I think is silly. They don't have any
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:06.400]  power left, but he looks at them a lot. He looks at Drudge a lot. He looks at info or some, but
[1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:10.880]  mainly when he sees it on Drudge. And then some of his people give him info from info wars.
[1:11:11.440 --> 1:11:15.840]  And sometimes I get phone calls, but he didn't know about our Pio because Hannity,
[1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:21.920]  and he's got a lot on his plate, hadn't covered it. He watches Hannity every night or he takes it.
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:25.600]  That's why you want to talk to the president. That's the most important show in America,
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:31.360]  because he watches Sean Hannity. And I just give you the intel folks. They know that. And
[1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:34.560]  I'm not gonna even, that's why they try to get Hannity off the air. They admit because that.
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:39.200]  I mean, that's how surrounded the president is. So joining us is James Wesley Rawls. James,
[1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:44.880]  how amazing is this that they're now changed the timeline and many were shooting earlier
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:50.560]  here. Now saying, okay, ISIS connections. What do you think is going on here? Why do you think
[1:11:50.560 --> 1:11:57.120]  it's being covered up? Or what's your intel suggestor? Pardon me? Oh, we have a problem
[1:11:57.120 --> 1:12:00.880]  with Skype. It's just disconnected. Skype's a wonderful technology, but I tell you, James is
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:06.880]  out in the boonies to say the least. So it's the next best thing to a string and 10 cans.
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:11.760]  We'll get him in studio sometime. His face hasn't been seen in about 10 years. We'll get James
[1:12:11.760 --> 1:12:18.960]  Wesley Rawls take on all of this as soon as we reconnect with him. And while we're waiting,
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:23.440]  let's just go ahead and get into North Korea first. Here's the cryptic statement by the
[1:12:23.440 --> 1:12:30.240]  president last week talking about the calm before the storm. And clearly he's talking about North
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:35.200]  Korea, but also Iran's threatening preemptive strikes on US ships. So, you know, there's not
[1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:39.280]  just our government out there that's got its problems. There's other bad governments. Okay.
[1:12:39.280 --> 1:12:44.320]  Okay. And so North Korea is out of control. I'm not calling for strikes on them, but what if they
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:49.840]  strike? And we've got to be in a strong posture here so that we can back them down and get some
[1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.640]  detente going. A lot of folks criticizing Trump on being strong on North Korea, I think are
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:58.800]  encouraging our enemies, quite frankly, because this is not the same old neocon government in my
[1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:03.600]  view. But right now, let's go ahead and go to this clip. This is the calm before the storm in case
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:20.320]  you missed it. Well, what's the storm? What storm is it? We have the world's great military people,
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:32.880]  and I will tell you that. And thank you all for coming. Thank you. What storm, Mr. President? We'll find out.
[1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:39.920]  Thank you, everybody. Now, the reason we play that is obviously it builds up to this. This is on
[1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:46.000]  infowars.com. Raquel Phelan Mattis, Army must be ready for military options on North Korea. We've
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.320]  got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our president can employ. Defense
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:56.720]  Secretary said, and this was while he was addressing a meeting of the Army, the Association of the
[1:13:56.720 --> 1:14:03.840]  United States Army Convention in Washington, D.C. Here it is. Unsurprisingly about Korea,
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:11.520]  and I suspect you're probably not going to reveal to us the intricate details of your Korea strategy.
[1:14:11.520 --> 1:14:19.520]  But what can the U.S. military do to lessen the likelihood of conflict on the Korean Peninsula?
[1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:27.360]  Oh, what a great question. We'll talk about Korea for a minute because it's on all of our minds,
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:32.960]  and you know there's a reason that I recommended TR Farinback's book that we all pull it out and
[1:14:32.960 --> 1:14:41.280]  read it one more time. But, ladies and gentlemen, it is right now a diplomatically led economic
[1:14:41.280 --> 1:14:49.120]  sanctioned buttressed effort to try to turn North Korea off this path. Now, what does the future
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:55.840]  hold? Neither you nor I can say, so there's one thing the U.S. Army can do, and that is,
[1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:01.840]  you have got to be ready to ensure that we have military options that our president
[1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:08.800]  can employ if needed. We currently, we currently are in a diplomatically led effort,
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:15.920]  and how many times have you seen the U.N. Security Council vote unanimously, now twice in a row,
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:22.960]  to impose stronger sanctions on North Korea? And remember, the Security Council has countries
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:30.720]  like France and Russia, China, the United States, you know who's on there, and all voted unanimously
[1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:37.760]  on this. The international community has spoken, but that means the U.S. Army must stand ready.
[1:15:38.720 --> 1:15:45.200]  And so if you're ready, that's your duty at this point in time, and I know the Army will always
[1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:48.800]  do it duty. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for having me. We'll be back. I mean, the fact is that
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:54.080]  the U.N. is behind this, that shows you how belligerent North Korea has been. And again, I don't want war,
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:16:02.240]  but this is serious. Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors
[1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:08.000]  would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a
[1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:14.960]  defense. Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had
[1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:21.440]  drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet
[1:16:21.440 --> 1:16:26.880]  war. Pathanogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:33.040]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter
[1:16:33.040 --> 1:16:40.560]  this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs
[1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:46.480]  to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:50.720]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our
[1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:55.920]  bodies back in our own hands, and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[1:16:55.920 --> 1:17:00.880]  You know, someone very profoundly once said many years ago that if fascism ever comes to America,
[1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:05.760]  it'll come in the name of liberalism. You're a white male. You're a white man.
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:15.760]  Welcome to The War Room, the latest expansion in Info Wars live broadcasting. We are live
[1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:22.640]  weekdays from 3 to 6 p.m. central at infowars.com slash show, and this YouTube channel right here

[1:17:37.600 --> 1:17:42.240]  phone calls. The liberal establishment media has controlled the narrative for too long.
[1:17:42.240 --> 1:17:46.560]  The silent majority is no longer silent. This is The War Room.
[1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:03.360]  Men, give your body the support it needs with Info Wars Life Prostaguard. It's time to start

[1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:32.000]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating,
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:36.240]  you know like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison. Harvest
[1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:41.920]  right freeze dryers retain 97 percent of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value
[1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:48.800]  and have a shelf life of up to 25 years. Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation.
[1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:53.600]  Harvest right is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer. So what are you waiting
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:20:22.080]  for? Check it out right now at InfoWarsStore.com. He aligns himself with the truth and it's time

[1:20:33.040 --> 1:20:36.640]  James Losey Rolls is joining us via phone now, former Army intel officer,
[1:20:36.640 --> 1:20:43.680]  bestsellingauthorsurvivalblog.com. What do you want to tackle first? Before you got cut off,
[1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:49.120]  as you know, they've come out and changed the timeline. Said he was shooting before, shot a
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:54.480]  security guard, now security analyst during Newsweek saying maybe it was ISIS. That's what I was
[1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:58.640]  told by folks in the hostage rescue team. Let's just say surrounding it. I'm going to leave it at
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:02.720]  that. I mean, those are real sources and everything they told me is now bearing out. I'm not going
[1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:07.600]  to repeat the whole laundry list, but one of the Middle East's girlfriend, all of it, was radicalized.
[1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:12.240]  They believe that he did have help. We broke all that first. Now it's coming out. What do you make
[1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:19.680]  of that? Then we'll get into North Korea, anti-fundmore, James. Well, I have to agree that the change
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:30.640]  in the timeline is significant and to try to piece together why he would have supposedly committed
[1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:37.840]  suicide right in the middle of his shooting spree when he'd shot up less than half the ammunition
[1:21:37.840 --> 1:21:42.880]  that he had there in the room. Yeah, they told me that the locals that have come out show that
[1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:48.800]  there was, I could see, 18 of the 100-round surefire magazines sitting there in a pile,
[1:21:48.800 --> 1:21:58.800]  a neat pile, ready to be loaded and fired. So what happened? Really odd. And to see the timeline
[1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:03.680]  changed in terms of the reason of why he might have committed suicide, thinking that the room
[1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:11.120]  was going to be rushed, that went away. So what triggered that? The other thing I wanted to mention
[1:22:11.120 --> 1:22:18.640]  that's significant is the same thing I mentioned to Rob Do last week. And that is Stephen Paddock
[1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:24.640]  was a private pilot. And as I'm sure you know, most people who get involved in general aviation
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:33.440]  get aircraft on the brain. If he was a private pilot and he knew how to pilot light
[1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:43.760]  aircraft, why wouldn't he simply do a landing gear up crash landing on that field full of 20,000
[1:22:43.760 --> 1:22:49.760]  people? He probably couldn't have killed 200 or 300 people without even having a bomb on board
[1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:56.640]  the aircraft. Conservatively landing gear up. Exactly. If he came in at full speed gear up,
[1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:06.000]  he would just slice through probably 1,000 people. Yeah. So there's so many unanswered
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:13.520]  questions here, so much conflicting information, unless or until the government releases the video
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:18.720]  that Stephen Paddock supposedly was taking of himself doing the shooting, I'm going to be
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:24.000]  completely incredulous. Well, again, just to show how good our sources are, they said no,
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:30.640]  he was taken out by police. We know several got wounded. We now learn and that then the HRT was
[1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:37.280]  behind them. But everything they told us is the truth so far. And so I guess I don't haven't
[1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:42.400]  gotten more information since then. I guess they've been ordered to stand down or just not tell the
[1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:49.200]  truth. I mean, this is amazing. Yeah, we're certainly being treated like mushrooms on this one.
[1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:56.320]  They're keeping us in the dark and you know what, they're feeding us. So we just need to be
[1:23:57.760 --> 1:24:03.360]  forward-leaning on this. We need to push our elected representatives and push the folks
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:07.360]  in the law enforcement community to get the information out there, the real truth of what
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:15.040]  happened out. And I suspect that we're going to find that he did have connections to ISIS,
[1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:22.960]  firm connections. And this really should be labeled an act of radical Islamic terrorism.
[1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:29.280]  What do you make of Newsweek saying, okay, it might be ISIS? I mean, they're kind of walked
[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:34.480]  back now their claims that was preposterous. Why would the FBI within hours of the event and ISIS
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:40.160]  taking responsibility rule them out when they never do that before? And generally even AP admits
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:47.680]  ISIS normally only takes credit for what they've done. Right. I think it was incredibly irresponsible
[1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:55.440]  of the FBI at the very least and probably nefarious of them to rule out an ISIS connection.
[1:24:57.360 --> 1:25:04.560]  I don't see how they had the evidence in hand that early on to make that kind of call. I don't
[1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:14.000]  think they could. We're still waiting for some substantive information to come out and I wouldn't
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:19.120]  be surprised if it comes out of either the intelligence community or high-level law enforcement
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:26.560]  telling us exactly what the connection between Stephen Paddock and ISIS was. Now, granted,
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:32.240]  his wife was from the northern Philippines and I don't know whether or not she had an Islamic
[1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:42.240]  background or not. But even in the absence of that, anyone who's had contact with Islamic
[1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:51.280]  recruitment videos could have conceivably become a convert to Islam and become an ISIS sympathizer
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:56.800]  or an ISIS shock troop. Well, look, law enforcement told us connections traveling the Middle East,
[1:25:56.800 --> 1:26:00.880]  all of it before that was in the news. That was proof right there what they gave us.
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:05.920]  And now it's all starting to come out. But just like Benghazi, I don't think they're going to
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:12.800]  be able to cover this up. I know from a White House source why Trump has basically sat on this
[1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:18.240]  because they're telling him we're not sure still yet. But sir, if it is ISIS, we think there's
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:22.960]  codes in the attack that may launch a larger attack because they know Trump is into military
[1:26:22.960 --> 1:26:28.240]  secrecy and not telling folks what you know. So they're kind of using that against the president
[1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:34.480]  so that some of the deep state Democrats can make this about gun control instead of validating the
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:39.680]  president about the danger of the Islamic invasion. And ISIS saying, as you know, the last few years,
[1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:44.880]  their main push is getting white Westerners who can blend in to carry out the attacks. That's what
[1:26:44.880 --> 1:26:50.720]  they've said they've been targeting. Their next big push has been that. Yes, and that's quite
[1:26:50.720 --> 1:26:57.520]  believable. Now, if Trump is holding back with holding information that he has, it may be very
[1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:02.880]  well be because folks in the intelligence community or in the Pentagon may have told them,
[1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:10.000]  may have told him that they have some sort of counter strike plan or that there or there might
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:18.720]  be a sources and methods issue with releasing information. I wouldn't be surprised at all
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:28.560]  if folks in the NSA had some intercepts that point that connected Stephen Paddock to ISIS.
[1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:35.200]  But because of the sensitivity of forces and methods, that can't be released publicly. That's
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:40.000]  just like in World War Two, the British for four years of the war had enigma, had the code, but
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.320]  a lot of times had to let submarines sink the fleets, had to let them do it because they only
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:50.160]  needed it for those critical times to win the war. Yeah, it very well could be an upset issue like
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:58.080]  that. Wow. Amazing. Just to see this unfolding. What does your gut tell you just looking at the
[1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:04.800]  whole thing? Well, my gut tells me that, A, there was more than one person involved.
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:16.640]  The hotel records alone point to that. B, there could be a ISIS connection. And C, I think that
[1:28:18.560 --> 1:28:26.960]  Stephen Paddock was either a mind control subject or manipulated by possibly a FBI team
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:34.240]  infiltration where they may have orchestrated some of these events just like they did the
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:37.600]  first bombing at the war. Stay there. This is so important. I want you to flesh this out because
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:42.800]  I know you're an expert on this. Again, James Leslie Rawls, survivalblog.com, amazing info,
[1:28:42.800 --> 1:28:46.960]  because he would lay in bed for hours screaming, screaming, not knowing who he was according to
[1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:51.280]  his girlfriend and more. He had a lot of, his brother looks like a mind control head. Let's talk
[1:28:51.280 --> 1:29:02.160]  about this straight ahead. December 23, 1776. These are the times that try men's souls. The
[1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:06.640]  summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:12.400]  country. But he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny,
[1:29:12.400 --> 1:29:17.120]  like hell, is not easily conquered. Yet we have this consolation with us that the heart of the
[1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:22.720]  conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly. It is
[1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:27.920]  dearness only that gives everything its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price on its
[1:29:27.920 --> 1:29:33.120]  goods. And it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:38.480]  highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right,
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:44.000]  not only to tax, but to bind us in all cases whatsoever. And if being bound in that matter
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:49.440]  is not slavery, then there is no such thing as slavery upon earth. Even the expression is impious,

[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:34.400]  Now when I say there are dozens of videos, I've probably watched, I don't want to exaggerate,
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:41.200]  close to a hundred. I've watched more than 10 videos shot of the people dead and dying
[1:33:41.760 --> 1:33:47.040]  during the shooting and after in the first few minutes, but I thought hey let's show you some
[1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:52.560]  of the new videos people are pointing out. I mean they were shot the day of the event live,
[1:33:53.600 --> 1:34:00.080]  but as folks, citizen researchers dig through this, they're finding more and more videos that show
[1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:04.960]  the exact same rate of fire, the exact same things we hear from different areas. We do have a leading
[1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:13.680]  national acoustics expert who is doing modeling right now and it's pointing towards multiple
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:18.880]  shooters and it's pointing towards, but he's still researching it. Not being a bump stock,
[1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:24.400]  they're able with acoustic signatures to even tell you what firearms they are and I can tell you
[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:30.480]  there's a heavier machine gun, not a crank that's on a belt and that's what all the guys that are
[1:34:30.480 --> 1:34:35.760]  experts Navy SEALs and Army people, Green Berets and others have told us that they've been saying
[1:34:35.760 --> 1:34:40.960]  the same thing since the day it happened. I called all the Green Berets and military guys and special
[1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:46.160]  ops people, I called a bunch of them and they all said the same thing and now it's coming out. So
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:51.360]  let me play this new video. Let's put it on screen so I can plug the YouTube channel that has this
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:56.960]  people can go see the full video. That's the alternative news and info report as you can see
[1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:01.280]  that went up on October 9th. This is just one of the new ones I hadn't seen. Again it's from the day,
[1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:07.440]  but they've got it and put it on their channel. New video services proves multiple shooters in Vegas
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:13.920]  and this fits into all the other videos just from a different angle, a different area. So let's go
[1:35:13.920 --> 1:35:38.160]  ahead and roll some of this footage. Now let's stop right there. I'm going to play that for
[1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:43.280]  James Rosey Rolls. Now let's play the cab driver footage shot right under the window in the parking
[1:35:43.280 --> 1:35:50.080]  lawn at Mandalay and you can hear it far off distant. Sounds like it's close to a mile away,
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:58.480]  a different firearm. And then you hear something that sounds like an M4 AR-15
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:06.240]  you know that's closer together right above ladies and gentlemen. And it's all happening
[1:36:06.240 --> 1:36:10.720]  the first two and a half minutes. There's only one gun going off or one person shooting at a time
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:24.560]  after that, but in the first two and a half minutes here it is.
[1:36:24.560 --> 1:36:38.400]  That sounds like it's coming from farther away.
[1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:54.640]  I notice she's in the same position when it goes off and it's 10 times louder.
[1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:00.240]  Then she moves and it's still loud. People say oh is she drove away? No, she's still in the same
[1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:06.800]  spot when you hear it being a lot louder and right above. That's where the reported shooting
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:14.080]  was coming from. So that is powerful. James Wesley Rolls. Alex, I think you're right. There's
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:22.560]  three distinct sound signatures there. One is an echo, but the other, the very first shooting you
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:28.160]  heard was shooting from in the distance and then you had shooting from up close and the
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:34.160]  cyclic rate sounded like it was right around 600 rounds a minute and that could have been an M4
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:44.800]  with a long magazine and with a heavy buffer to slow the cyclic rate down, but to me that sounded
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:51.840]  like an M249, which is a belt fed. I have serious doubts that we're getting the whole story about
[1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:58.320]  what happened that night about how many people were shooting and where all the shooting was
[1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:03.680]  originating. There's some information that came out in the last couple of days about shooting
[1:38:03.680 --> 1:38:10.240]  that took place in the front lobby of the Bellagio Hotel. Yes, we've got witnesses all saying
[1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:18.080]  casings, glass, please saying get in. It's very compelling. Right, so we definitely have at least
[1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:23.760]  two different locations where they were shooting going on and we're definitely not getting the
[1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:32.320]  whole story. I really want to have folks dig into this forensically and see what happened.
[1:38:32.320 --> 1:38:40.400]  And to get back to our previous subject on possible mind control or infiltration by
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:43.600]  either government informants. You were getting into case points where they
[1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:47.360]  find a mentally ill person, wind them up, control them, and they believe they're being
[1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:51.360]  handled by a foreign power, but they're being handled by the FBI. I mean even the New York Times
[1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:56.480]  had mentioned that the FBI, one out of a hundred terror plots, hatched 98 of them.
[1:38:56.480 --> 1:39:04.400]  Right, we very well could have a situation where Stephen Paddock might have even been
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:12.800]  in a situation like in the fictional movie Conspiracy Theory where they
[1:39:13.600 --> 1:39:21.680]  had an individual who was mentally imbalanced and in a delicate state and convinced him that
[1:39:21.680 --> 1:39:28.320]  he's actually helping the government when he's actually being used as a patsy, as a fall guy.
[1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:38.400]  And it very well could have been orchestrated by means of contacts away from his home where
[1:39:39.200 --> 1:39:44.640]  even if Mary Lou Danly, his girlfriend, were to testify, she wouldn't have a thing to say
[1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:51.200]  because I think if you look at his travel pattern, which was amazing for a guy who
[1:39:51.200 --> 1:40:00.240]  was supposedly a professional gambler, he was bouncing around between Southern Nevada, Texas,
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:08.000]  and Northern Arizona on a regular basis. And that would have given plenty of opportunity
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:13.280]  for him to be touching base with a FBI handler or say-
[1:40:13.280 --> 1:40:22.720]  His MO fits a gun runner or narcotics trafficker who's being controlled fast and furious style,
[1:40:22.720 --> 1:40:27.120]  who's laundering millions of dollars every quarter through these things, but that he was
[1:40:27.120 --> 1:40:31.600]  just the useful idiot bag man being used to do it, paying for everything, his family,
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:36.000]  his brother's now being investigated for narcotics trafficking. I mean you've got this
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:39.840]  whole, and then the hotel lying about him getting there, you know, three days later,
[1:40:39.840 --> 1:40:46.320]  and the receipts, I mean what does all that say? Yeah, and I have never heard of a professional
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:54.560]  gambler that plays video poker because it's not like a live poker game where you can watch the
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:41:00.400]  dealer and the dealing- No, it's programmed where you lose 65% of the time.
[1:41:01.200 --> 1:41:04.800]  Right, so how do you, you're not going to make up for that on volume.
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:14.640]  I think he was there to launder money, and he had to spend all those hours in the casino
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:19.600]  and do that volume of gambling to cover the amount of money that had to-
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:22.720]  Sure, I mean look, his dad's a famous bank robber, a psychopath that tried to run a
[1:41:22.720 --> 1:41:27.760]  revpie agent. The whole family's been handled, it's coming out, the brothers are basically
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:32.480]  snitches. I mean this guy's the classic cut out snitch that thought he was a tough guy,
[1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:37.120]  told women he was a secret agent, told women he was a psychopath, when what he really was was
[1:41:37.120 --> 1:41:45.920]  just some cut out decoy slime bag. I think he very well may be right that we are not being
[1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:52.640]  told the whole story about Stephen Paddock, what his motivations were, who was controlling him,
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:42:00.000]  and what he thought he was doing. It could have been either a false flag or a third flag operation,
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:07.840]  and I'm sure a lot of your listeners are familiar with the term third flag, but typically like in
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:12.480]  in the case of a famous American spy named Pollock.
[1:42:13.520 --> 1:42:18.240]  Hold on, stay there. Let's come back and finish up with different types of false flags, third flags,
[1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:24.320]  different double crosses, triple agents, quadruple agents, all sorts of decoy operations. Let's talk
[1:42:24.320 --> 1:42:29.840]  about that on the other side, then get into the big enchilada, North Korea with our guest James Wesley
[1:42:29.840 --> 1:42:36.480]  Rawls, and now admit a possible strike on North Korea is the talk of the calm before the storm,

[1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:11.840]  the body. That's why I'm introducing ZShield. Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's

[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:24.240]  in the next hour and have open phones and I'm going to cover all the other big breaking news on
[1:47:24.240 --> 1:47:29.680]  the economy. You name it James Wesley Rawls and survivalblog.com former army intel officer best
[1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:36.160]  selling author is our guest but let's play that clip just one more of this video showing the same
[1:47:36.160 --> 1:47:43.520]  thing from Sunday night where you can as he said hear faraway shooting close shooting and then
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:48.240]  there's echoes and bullets bouncing around the middle of it if you want to slow it down but
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:54.560]  but I mean it's just totally clear and of course the video I played earlier is even clear but here
[1:47:54.560 --> 1:48:18.000]  it is right there you can hear overlapping fire that's clearly two different rifles two different
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:24.400]  cadences crossing over each other just spectacularly obvious James Wesley Rawls continuing
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:35.520]  with what a triple flag is okay a third flag operation is where an individual is led to
[1:48:35.520 --> 1:48:43.040]  believe that they will be infiltrating an organization in their country on behalf of
[1:48:43.040 --> 1:48:56.560]  another country and I mentioned Jonathan Pollard he was a CIA analyst who became a intelligence
[1:48:56.560 --> 1:49:02.480]  asset for the government of Israel back in the 1980s and he was eventually released I think
[1:49:02.480 --> 1:49:13.440]  in around 2015 but a lot of times people will be brought into intelligence operations and led to
[1:49:13.440 --> 1:49:21.280]  believe that they're going to be representing a third country that say for example Stephen
[1:49:21.280 --> 1:49:27.920]  Patek was told that he would either be representing the United States government or another friendly
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:39.120]  pro-western government to infiltrate ISIS on behalf as an operative but in fact he was being
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:48.880]  played where this wasn't a uh and a Reichstag style operation where they wanted to actually
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:55.280]  have a terrorist incident take place that they could blame on another another country
[1:49:55.280 --> 1:50:01.280]  or just to be clear I kind of fumbled the term but I've read about third flags going back hundreds
[1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:06.080]  of years ago different governments in wars between Spain and England doing it when these
[1:50:06.080 --> 1:50:11.200]  terms first got developed of false flag third flag and they had a whole bunch of other terms just
[1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:15.840]  like they have for you know picking up sea garbage flotsam jetsam it just goes on and on all these
[1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:20.960]  weird naval terms that these come from but when I call it triple flag isn't this kind of a term
[1:50:20.960 --> 1:50:25.680]  that is there a triple cross where again you think you're doing one thing working for another
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:30.320]  group but it's really another group and you're being set up as a decoy basically right it's
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:39.840]  conceivable that um that there was a foreign intelligence agency or a terrorist group that
[1:50:40.880 --> 1:50:48.080]  made it look like uh he was was operating on behalf of the United States government
[1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:53.600]  and you know basically doing a good service for his own country sure that's easy to do I mean
[1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:58.080]  that's the whole plot of the movie sniper uh that came out a few years ago that's a very powerful
[1:50:58.080 --> 1:51:06.400]  film have have you seen that with Mark Wahlberg yes I have and then that that is a a good um
[1:51:06.400 --> 1:51:11.280]  comparison that that's a comparable situation that's a third flag happened that's a third flag
[1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:16.720]  that's a third flag operation right he's told he's getting ready to address dangers of the
[1:51:16.720 --> 1:51:21.040]  president and his security so see if you can get into sniper position see if you can carry this
[1:51:21.040 --> 1:51:25.360]  attack out and then really they just intend to have him doing a drill where they end up killing him
[1:51:25.360 --> 1:51:32.080]  and then making it look like he did it right and another another third flag would be Arlington
[1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:36.640]  road Arlington road where that the professor thinks he's going to stop the bombing but they
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:44.000]  actually set him up right right and in the case of Stephen Paddock there was almost an hour that
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:51.120]  went by between the time the shooting started out on the at least the firing from the building
[1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:57.040]  down to the to the um to the concert below there was almost an hour that went by so
[1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:03.600]  the coroner is not going to be able to determine exactly when he was killed or whether he killed
[1:52:03.600 --> 1:52:09.680]  himself so there may have been someone else doing all of the shooting by the same what does it
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:13.840]  signify the first shots were ever fired what does it signify that my sources that have proven
[1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:17.840]  accurate so far the only part that hasn't been proven now that they told me was that indeed
[1:52:17.840 --> 1:52:24.080]  he was shot by the police uh did not commit suicide well that wouldn't surprise me at all
[1:52:24.080 --> 1:52:31.680]  because again at the time he stopped shooting he still had a number of weapons that had never
[1:52:31.680 --> 1:52:37.920]  been fired so even if he was having mechanical problems with the weapons he was shooting um
[1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:42.960]  there was a number of weapons that had never been fired there were stacks of loaded magazines still
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:48.800]  sitting there neatly stacked ready to be fired and without anyone bursting through the doors
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:54.880]  what what was his reason for then suddenly did he have some sudden change of heart where he
[1:52:54.880 --> 1:53:01.440]  wanted to kill himself it just doesn't it doesn't match and well we now know we've been we've been
[1:53:01.440 --> 1:53:06.560]  saying that James and now we know the whole official story is unraveling and and first we
[1:53:06.560 --> 1:53:10.400]  had the sheriff going he had to have help and we're looking at radicalization and then they
[1:53:10.400 --> 1:53:13.920]  kind of pulled back from that and now their narrative is unraveling what do you think's
[1:53:13.920 --> 1:53:18.080]  going on i think we've got patriot leakers that they're having to get out of head up because
[1:53:18.080 --> 1:53:22.800]  they know people are pissed off and about to release more well certainly their initial
[1:53:22.800 --> 1:53:30.320]  narrative about the timeline of when the hotel security guard came to the door um they had to
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:37.760]  change that because that that completely unraveled on them but unfortunately that took away the
[1:53:37.760 --> 1:53:44.480]  convenient reason for steven paddock to have committed suicide which was he was in fear that
[1:53:44.480 --> 1:53:54.160]  he that he was in imminent danger of having the room rushed by a swat team so i think we're being
[1:53:54.720 --> 1:54:02.400]  fed a lot of lies here and the truth will come out the truth will prevail because we live in the
[1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:09.120]  internet age we live in the age of ubiquitous cell phones with cameras built of ubiquitous
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:13.840]  humid there's so many people documenting everything that big brother's now been turned against big
[1:54:13.840 --> 1:54:20.800]  brother right and and you'll if you notice on youtube there are now videos being released
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:29.520]  that synchronize three four or five videos um together based on the firing pattern and it's
[1:54:29.520 --> 1:54:36.560]  lining up yeah they're they're syncing all these up so it's like having multiple human assets on
[1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:42.880]  the ground at multiple locations you can't lie yourself around a situation like that but the
[1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:47.840]  truth will come out well my sources are real tight lip now and i'm surprised they even gave us what
[1:54:47.840 --> 1:54:52.960]  we got risking their lives undoubtedly but they just say it's complete bs and the guy was isis
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:58.000]  antifa and that there were other about other shooters and that he was going to the middle east
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:03.680]  and now it's all starting to come out so now they're all completely silent and my other sources
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:09.440]  just say look you're on target we can't tell you alex but you're on target yeah i think that as time
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:14.160]  goes on more and more information is going to come out and there's one other really interesting
[1:55:14.160 --> 1:55:20.400]  tidbit that you probably already mentioned on your show and that is an airplane that he previously
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:29.040]  owned ended up being sold to an intelligence defense contractor in shantilly virginia i saw
[1:55:29.040 --> 1:55:32.480]  that but i didn't ever cover it stay there and do five more minutes with us i want to get into
[1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:36.880]  north korea with you just a briefly on the side of this break uh just amazing to have james wasley

[1:55:40.640 --> 1:55:44.800]  and just really building this picture because there's so much i haven't even gotten into i mean it's
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:51.200]  just crazy what a cover-up it is but i don't plan to be breaking all this we're just looking at what
[1:55:51.200 --> 1:56:00.080]  humanity is discovering covering it but it locks in with what the fbi hostage rescue team folks told
[1:56:00.080 --> 1:56:06.880]  us uh and from what other sources said so this is just to be this right it's just to see you and

[2:00:20.720 --> 2:00:26.240]  from the front line you just gotta be willing to die formation war to live it's alex jones
[2:00:26.240 --> 2:00:33.280]  nobody else is not willing to fight to their slaves but now we see the new world order going
[2:00:33.280 --> 2:00:42.320]  on to the rocks it's bad for business james leslie ralls north korea the calm before the storm
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:48.160]  speech now i'm confirmed to be a threat to north korea uh is this all just saber rattling uh i don't
[2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:53.120]  want a war i love my four children at the same time i know north korea is evil it's not like these
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:57.520]  middle eastern wars this is a real threat given weapons by the globalist trump appears to be cleaning
[2:00:57.520 --> 2:01:01.840]  up the globalist mess in the middle east and now this but i don't want to strike but he does get
[2:01:01.840 --> 2:01:08.320]  more belligerent how they even get the u.n and others on board uh for the u.s to basically stand
[2:01:08.320 --> 2:01:15.600]  up north korea what do you make of this situation well alex i think that you're right that most of
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:22.640]  it is saber rattling uh the the threat of an actual shooting war with north korea is relatively
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:32.000]  small but the implications of that happening are huge because north korea is now a nuclear armed power
[2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:41.760]  so we the threat there is credible um a lot of it though is grandstanding and saber rattling
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:53.440]  for the sake of uh consolidating power uh in the united nations and um backing up the longstanding
[2:01:54.240 --> 2:02:00.560]  american position in the region you know a lot of your listeners may not realize but
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:06.480]  peace was really not ever declared in on the korean yeah the war is still going on it's
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:12.560]  it's like this is fine the state of war in existence it's just as there's just simply
[2:02:12.560 --> 2:02:23.600]  been a ceasefire since the early 50s so um yes that very well uh could uh re-erupt and it could be
[2:02:23.600 --> 2:02:31.280]  very ugly when it does if nukes start getting bobbed around my real doubts about the situation
[2:02:31.280 --> 2:02:40.000]  involve north korean technology obviously they have fission bombs i kind of doubt that they have um
[2:02:40.640 --> 2:02:49.520]  any kind of deliverable fusion bomb and i also have doubts that they have sufficient miniaturization
[2:02:49.520 --> 2:02:54.320]  to deliver put their nuclear weapons on their so you don't think they have hydrogen bombs yet
[2:02:54.320 --> 2:03:02.320]  well uh hydrogen bomb you know takes a fusion bomb to set off a fusion bomb hydrogen bomb
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:08.320]  takes an atomic bomb to detonate a hydrant right i don't think they're going to um
[2:03:09.520 --> 2:03:16.160]  they're not they're not going to have the ability to miniaturize uh certainly hydrogen bomb
[2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:22.160]  technology for many years and and they may not even have the ability to miniaturize
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:26.880]  their fusion bomb their atom bomb technology i agree with you the evidence shows that why are they
[2:03:26.880 --> 2:03:32.160]  getting so belligerent and and and just so crazy is that a sign that kim jong-un is weak and he's
[2:03:32.160 --> 2:03:38.160]  doing it for domestic control i think a lot of it it may be for yeah just for domestic consumption
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:47.360]  to try to consolidate his power he comes from a whole dynasty of absolutely paranoid dictators
[2:03:47.360 --> 2:03:53.920]  his father and his grandfather were both notoriously paranoid there have been multiple
[2:03:53.920 --> 2:04:03.920]  killings within the family to consolidate power and to prevent any kind of attempted coup within
[2:04:03.920 --> 2:04:12.400]  the regime so the level the level of paranoia the level of xenophobia is just off the charts
[2:04:12.400 --> 2:04:17.760]  in north korea that's a great point people think is the west is racist or the least racist group
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:21.600]  you go to asia man they all hate each other like it is just incredible
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:33.520]  yeah um the the level of xenophobia there cannot be underrated and the the level of paranoia
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:40.000]  is similarly just again off the charts so it makes it almost impossible to predict
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:46.160]  how kim jong-un might react to particular situation all right that's why it's so dangerous
[2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:50.960]  we'll keep watching an amazing analysis james resley roll survival blog.com find his books there
[2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:51.600]  thank you james
[2:04:55.360 --> 2:04:59.120]  what exactly is political correctness and why is it being pushed on the american public
[2:04:59.120 --> 2:05:04.000]  well political correctness is simply a form of psychological manipulation the government uses
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:08.320]  to control public opinion by controlling your opinions the establishment gets you to not only
[2:05:08.320 --> 2:05:12.640]  agree with their agenda but to also ensure that your government created viewpoint also
[2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:16.880]  influences others in ripple effect this is how the power elite and the government stay in power
[2:05:16.880 --> 2:05:21.440]  the use psychological manipulation they turn the public into obedient sheeple and over time
[2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:26.160]  we lose our ability to distinguish reality from deception but how does political correctness and
[2:05:26.160 --> 2:05:30.880]  other deliberate deceptions work well first the establishment saturates mass media with their
[2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:35.840]  agenda they're trying to push until it invades every aspect of popular culture and is accepted
[2:05:35.840 --> 2:05:40.160]  as truth such as global warming for example then the establishment suppresses any counter
[2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:45.360]  arguments through their agenda by calling critics kooky nutjobs racist or in the case of man made
[2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:49.600]  climate change climate deniers you can learn more about this tyranny over the minds a minute
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:06:06.080]  info wars dot com prism planet dot tv and our youtube channel resistance news this is kit daniel's reporting
[2:06:14.240 --> 2:06:19.040]  monday through friday from 11 a.m to 3 p.m central i'm your host alec shones
[2:06:19.040 --> 2:06:24.000]  this is the info war on local stations tv and radio across the country and of course
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:32.320]  at news wars there's a war in the media news wars dot com as well as prism planet dot com
[2:06:35.440 --> 2:06:39.440]  now let's go ahead and go over some of these articles i'm going to open the phones up about
[2:06:39.440 --> 2:06:45.200]  the big vegas cover-up developments coming out uh the north korea situation the nfl running up the
[2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:52.000]  wide flag they're trying to exercise power over america and a lot more but i'm also going to get
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:57.120]  to a story paul watson posted this morning that i should have led the show with i just got so focused
[2:06:57.120 --> 2:07:01.040]  on the incredible news of them changing the narrative admitting people were getting shot
[2:07:01.040 --> 2:07:07.520]  earlier than they were inside the hotel uh that they think there were accomplices that uh he went
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:11.840]  to the middle east i mean the whole thing's unraveling exactly as we told you it would
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:19.200]  it's simply incredible but this big news is on info wars dot com and and you know paul sometimes
[2:07:19.200 --> 2:07:26.800]  has kind of light headlines for stuff that is just over the top important and you read this story
[2:07:27.360 --> 2:07:32.960]  we already know these numbers but we had 2015 numbers the government always comes out close
[2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:38.960]  to a year later with last year's numbers and you can play games with statistics but murders
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:44.480]  they those they got a really accurate number on the number of folks that actually got killed
[2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:50.160]  that that deal that were enrolled is dead this is one of the most accurate numbers out there's
[2:07:50.160 --> 2:07:57.920]  obviously people missing you have to factor into that but uh this is info wars dot com paul joseph
[2:07:57.920 --> 2:08:03.440]  watson and this is the type of article that they censor on youtube facebook and twitter
[2:08:03.440 --> 2:08:10.240]  this is what they don't want out and folks i'm not putting this out to put down black people the media
[2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:14.560]  whenever there's black on white crime newspaper editors have said they tell their writers not to
[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:19.760]  say the race of the person but then if a white person kills some black people they go out of their
[2:08:19.760 --> 2:08:26.320]  way mainly the white editors the leftist to say all white people are to blame because some scumbag
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:30.640]  killed nine innocent black people in a church in south carolina but then when a black guy shoots
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:37.840]  nine white people thank god only killing one uh and says he does it because he hates white people
[2:08:37.840 --> 2:08:44.240]  they censor it if you even report on what he said or if islamists say go out and rape
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:50.480]  western women they censor that or they censor the rape epidemic in sweden or germany i mean this
[2:08:50.480 --> 2:08:56.160]  is happening to info wars this is this is going on they have republican congressional candidates
[2:08:56.160 --> 2:09:02.080]  that put out really just nice friendly videos on twitter marcia blackburn it gets a couple million
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:09.360]  views they just ban it and tell her it's banned for violating their rules so we've hit next level
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:17.040]  censorship but listen to this censored info because we now have the 2016 numbers 10 months later we get
[2:09:17.040 --> 2:09:22.000]  them usually it's a year usually it's in december we get them or or january this is a little early
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.920]  uh new fbi crime stats show white privilege might not be america's biggest problem
[2:09:29.600 --> 2:09:39.360]  and for every homicide by a black person there's 12.37 for white people killing 1.42
[2:09:40.960 --> 2:09:46.880]  and hispanics 2.54 and if you look at the numbers from a year before that they're also in the new
[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:53.120]  one i haven't had time to just pulling on to murder rates and crime rates here it if you index it
[2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:58.720]  you find whites are twice as likely per capita to be or right at twice it's it's not quite twice
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:04.160]  right at twice as likely to be killed by police now does that mean police want to kill white people
[2:10:04.160 --> 2:10:10.560]  know the only racism there is you could just say they're politically correct or scared is they slow
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:14.880]  roll into lower income areas that happen to be black because they know they might get shot in the
[2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:21.120]  back or demonized they're not going to risk their life going into a home invasion or a in many cases
[2:10:21.840 --> 2:10:26.160]  a domestic disturbance that is super dangerous whether it's black folks or white folks or whoever
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:32.400]  that's the most dangerous thing is a is a domestic disturbance because people their their emotions
[2:10:32.400 --> 2:10:38.320]  are up with their mate or their kids or whatever's going on anybody knows you know tempers can flare
[2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:43.760]  that's a dangerous situation to walk into some family fight people are wound up they're emotional
[2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:49.600]  they're not thinking well are the cops going to roll in to say a house would you know a family
[2:10:49.600 --> 2:10:53.360]  of 10 people in it while people are yelling and screaming and waving guns no they're going to
[2:10:53.360 --> 2:10:57.120]  drive on down the street and call the SWAT team that's going to take them 30 minutes to an hour
[2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:01.520]  to get there and by then somebody's going to be dead because you also look at the statistics a
[2:11:01.520 --> 2:11:07.520]  lot of cops are getting killed going into white domestic disturbances but they're risking their
[2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:12.400]  lives because on average they think they're appreciated going in there but if they're not
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:17.040]  appreciate it and going to get shot in the back they're not going to show up so that's the facts
[2:11:17.040 --> 2:11:23.680]  you got 3 000 people plus a year shot chicago close to a thousand dead nobody's talking a couple hundred
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:32.400]  black people killed by cops thousands dead in chicago thousands shot so this this article
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:38.880]  has the latest numbers and they're even more dramatic than the year before while some blame
[2:11:38.880 --> 2:11:43.680]  mass shootings in las vegas online privilege new fbi crime statistics suggest that while white people
[2:11:43.680 --> 2:11:48.400]  may not be the main source of the problem when it comes to violent crime i love how paul said
[2:11:48.400 --> 2:11:53.920]  may not be these statistics are conclusive i love paul to death he's so prolific and so great
[2:11:53.920 --> 2:11:59.120]  this is a very it needs to be shocking new statistics show blacks commit 10 times more
[2:11:59.120 --> 2:12:07.360]  homicides in whites censored data i mean you know i don't understand whatever just get the
[2:12:07.360 --> 2:12:13.200]  article out folks newly released figures covering 2016 that break down arrests in terms of race
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:17.200]  illustrated how black people are still vastly overrepresented in virtually every crime category
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:22.560]  despite making up 13 percent of the population total arrests of black people are 2 million
[2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:29.360]  263 000 compared to 5 858 000 arrested white people who make up around 73 percent of the
[2:12:29.360 --> 2:12:34.960]  population uh yeah but all of them are about to die that's why like in a decade it'll be
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:39.600]  60 percent non-white so one reason i'm not committing a lot of crime is they're young
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:44.560]  people commit most of the crime so see a lot of that's also skewed by that but it is the numbers
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:49.440]  black people are the most likely and more likely than whites to be arrested for murder
[2:12:49.440 --> 2:12:54.960]  and non-negligent manslaughter despite being a minority with 52.6 of arrests as category being
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:13:02.800]  african americans 13 percent of the population 52 percent of the arrests for it of adults arrested
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:11.600]  for murder 52 percent were black or african america 45.4 percent were white and 2.6 of other
[2:13:11.600 --> 2:13:20.640]  races reports the fbi do you hear that black people are also overrepresented in virtually every
[2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:28.720]  other category including robbery rape aggravated assault motor vehicle theft and prostitution
[2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:37.120]  weapons violations and show folks those graphs okay and and remember even obama's just department
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:42.960]  tried to manipulate these numbers down it didn't work folks and if you want to know why starting
[2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:48.720]  in the 60s the black community had lower crime rates on average than many other communities
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:55.280]  the lowest level of illegitimacy but they had the highest number of new jobs and had decided to hey
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:58.160]  y'all you know what what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and i'm not defending what happened to
[2:13:58.160 --> 2:14:02.880]  him but they said we're gonna dress nice have our own businesses and we're not gonna shop
[2:14:02.880 --> 2:14:08.640]  in the cracker areas and it made them incredibly successful i'm not saying the suppression was
[2:14:08.640 --> 2:14:12.400]  good but it made them have their own communities their own systems made them become successful
[2:14:13.360 --> 2:14:18.240]  under the pressure and then they came in with a great society and as lbj's letters said i'm
[2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:22.000]  gonna have those inwards vote and democrat for a hundred years we're gonna tell them not have men
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:26.240]  in the house break up their families break up those black churches we're gonna have control of them
[2:14:26.240 --> 2:14:31.520]  and boy did they do it then they hyped up the gangster culture in the media they pushed it that
[2:14:31.520 --> 2:14:36.400]  was tough that was cool that's how a black man got ahead and they had him primed for the presence
[2:14:37.200 --> 2:14:43.200]  and it's been the same thing ever since that an mtv in the in the in the early 90s they told top rock
[2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:48.880]  stars i've talked to two of myself you better start doing hip hop and having these hip hop artists on
[2:14:48.880 --> 2:14:53.440]  because we're gonna force feed it and make it the future we know they were just using top acts to
[2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:59.440]  force feed the gangster rap you know and setting them up and they told him we don't just want the
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:04.880]  normal rap that was pretty popular we want the gangster tough guy thug garbage so that all these
[2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:09.120]  kids thought their dad that went to church and their dad that you know you know worked at a shoe
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:15.760]  shop or was a or you know was a was a janitor and i'm not saying those are jobs they all should

[2:21:44.320 --> 2:21:53.360]  two five three three one three nine now let me tell you a little story here dr corcy is somewhat
[2:21:53.360 --> 2:21:59.280]  popular on air and he does our political stuff in dc a lot of it he's done a lot of great stuff in
[2:21:59.280 --> 2:22:06.880]  the past he has a lot of great connections but it's not really sexy you know uh it's kind of dry
[2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:12.080]  about oh they're rating fanny may and freddy mac to fund obama care or
[2:22:14.320 --> 2:22:18.000]  many other cases like that but he writes those because it's for a dc audience
[2:22:19.200 --> 2:22:24.560]  show the articles don't go viral on info wars a lot of folks read them but they're just not viral
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:31.120]  like a paul watch an article but when you talk about delivering and we're not getting
[2:22:31.120 --> 2:22:35.600]  paid any lobbying money for the american people because that's who we lobby for our myself you
[2:22:37.520 --> 2:22:42.720]  remember ran paul wanted to come on six months ago his plan got pitched through
[2:22:42.720 --> 2:22:47.760]  dr corcy and others but frankly course he first put out the plan and got the documents
[2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:53.760]  about defunding it and and and and not letting him raid fanny may and freddy mac so he picked
[2:22:53.760 --> 2:22:58.000]  it's not about credit it's showing how they're that's why they want to keep info wars off the
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:02.160]  president's desk because the president when he gets good info acts on it this is huge
[2:23:02.160 --> 2:23:07.760]  we should get corcy on tomorrow oh wait i'm not poo pooing corcy it's like some guest aren't super
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:14.320]  viral but with targeted audiences they're super effective look at this article by kit daniels
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:20.000]  as we predicted trump assigned ran paul health care plan trump joins forces with senator ran paul
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:25.360]  and it's got the whole plan to basically defund it even if they don't get rid of the whole
[2:23:25.360 --> 2:23:31.600]  bill them itself they just defund it and then that helps the american people not get ripped off
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:36.320]  it forces states to bring in competition it'll lower prices give you higher quality care they
[2:23:36.320 --> 2:23:41.040]  don't get to wreck american health care than come in with a single player as is equal to manuel and
[2:23:41.040 --> 2:23:46.400]  jonathan gruber said they both said on television you're stupid we're wrecking it take it over
[2:23:46.400 --> 2:23:53.600]  with a republican blue blood scum so big article breaking it all down and we've got all the corcy
[2:23:53.600 --> 2:23:59.280]  videos in there where he broke it all down great job dr jerome corcy uh on that front
[2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:04.960]  and again the sheriff departments altered the timeline saying he shot people before he opened
[2:24:04.960 --> 2:24:09.600]  fire and when they said and he did go to the middle east like we first told you and he checked in
[2:24:09.600 --> 2:24:13.680]  three days early like we first told you and and and just oh i mean it's just everything we told
[2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:19.360]  you's coming up oh and newsweek says isis may be behind it now
[2:24:22.240 --> 2:24:28.480]  oh and uh the new york times have been caught on tape admitting that they slanted news against
[2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:32.400]  conservatives and trump uh we don't really need project veritas to tell us that but it's
[2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:38.480]  nice to have the video isn't it oh and i almost forgot little zook zookie newsweek's reporting
[2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:44.240]  he exploited disaster with portoreca virtual reality he he he partners with the red cross
[2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:49.680]  because then they keep 90 percent of the money it's all big global scam so a did that and then
[2:24:49.680 --> 2:24:53.680]  he shows himself in portoreca telling you how to do it it's a virtual reality
[2:24:55.440 --> 2:25:00.560]  and that nice his little sick avatar it looks like it's what a three-year-old would watch i love
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:04.720]  that everything zuckerberg and npr and all of them do is talk to you like you're an idiot you know
[2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:10.160]  that doesn't make sense we're not idiots they admit the message is the medium the message
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:19.040]  is the medium the the the the the delivery form the way they give you the delivery the fact that

[2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:55.680]  timeline now newsweek says it might have been ices i mean this is a lot of big developments uh on

[2:34:36.880 --> 2:34:42.720]  don't think so man there's no way well that's because 90 of the justice department is still

[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:01.600]  admitted that other stuff was going on it's admitted uh that that he had people there three
[2:35:01.600 --> 2:35:06.320]  days before it's admitted there's a cover-up and they keep changing their story and we have the
[2:35:06.320 --> 2:35:10.240]  hostage rescue team source and we have all the military sources saying clearly it's multiple
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:17.840]  firearms this is powerful information thank you matt now let's talk to melissa in california
[2:35:17.840 --> 2:35:23.840]  melissa you're on the air go ahead hi alec um i was calling because i haven't heard anyone address
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:29.840]  this yet uh in the beginning when the press originally leaked the photos they were on there
[2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:36.080]  for like four hours before they cut some stuff out of it even now if you go to the uk uh website
[2:35:36.080 --> 2:35:43.920]  or where where they leaked them um it's cut out of their original picture there is a shoe in the
[2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:50.400]  picture and you can see that it's a pant leg and then behind the chair back there is something
[2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:56.560]  it's like a plaid shirt it has uh black and white and you can tell that it's the body
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:04.960]  you know i remember those photos in the sun the daily mail and i didn't see them anymore
[2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:09.280]  where it's like his leg under the bipod and there is some stuff under the table uh you're
[2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:15.760]  saying that's been taken down well you can still view it but you won't be able to see the actual
[2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:24.000]  sheriff uh detective who's examining the bullet wound obviously up ahead in there um i did some
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:30.080]  research on my own and i looked up the sheriff's department and i got uh pictures of everyone
[2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:36.000]  well there's a black lady and she has a white watch on and if you look in the photo you can
[2:36:36.000 --> 2:36:42.240]  see the white watch you can see her hand on the head of whatever's back there and it would make
[2:36:42.240 --> 2:36:48.480]  sense well listen man screenshot all this and send it to show tips at info wars dot com right now

[2:36:56.640 --> 2:37:00.480]  going off all the shooting experts saying it's the case and the sheriff's department now changing
[2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:05.200]  their story saying he shot people before he went on the rampage and for 10 days they've been covering
[2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:09.360]  that up now admitting he went to the middle east which our source is told to stay one what do you
[2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:15.920]  make of now newsweek having to admit that yes indeed it may be a nice attack well i think it is i
[2:37:15.920 --> 2:37:22.080]  think it is a terrorist attack and i think that they didn't get the tip in time that it was going
[2:37:22.080 --> 2:37:27.440]  to happen and they didn't get there and i have a feeling i have never seen a picture of hate or
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:36.720]  jesus compost you know who is this guy he's busy a cia is he i mean well man give me a favor
[2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:39.840]  we're gonna look into what you're saying but i remember it was like in the sun it was in the
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:44.960]  daily mail i remember the photo that it was wider and later i saw crop photos so memory

[2:37:49.200 --> 2:37:53.440]  com thank you melissa and these are great calls we're going to ferret all the south some of us
[2:37:53.440 --> 2:38:00.080]  can end up not being accurate like day one monday it will you hear the gun going off looks like a
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:06.160]  flash uh from the fifth or sixth floor turns out it's a strobe light saw other videos showing
[2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:11.440]  that that was the case we said folks that was a lead we followed wasn't right by monday afternoon
[2:38:11.440 --> 2:38:16.480]  media today came out and said jones says uh you know this week that it's just that it's a shooting
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:22.000]  but we know it's a strobe light see they're they're going back to what we early said to find
[2:38:22.000 --> 2:38:25.920]  anything is wrong because they're so freaked out that they know that we've been proven right yet
[2:38:25.920 --> 2:38:31.920]  again okay let's take more calls eric in ohio once we talk about the vegas cover-up i mean it's
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:36.320]  now a cover-up folks i mean but we've solved the case in that we know they're covering it up
[2:38:37.600 --> 2:38:43.520]  and the islamic connections are evident i mean we have the hrt sources uh go ahead eric hey thanks
[2:38:43.520 --> 2:38:48.080]  for taking my call alex you and mr roll has already touched on it but obviously we have
[2:38:48.080 --> 2:38:52.640]  an additional confirmed shooter at the beloggio uh i'm sure you've also heard reports that they were
[2:38:53.200 --> 2:38:59.520]  there was a shooter at tropic canna and possibly even down at ground level at the concert uh my
[2:38:59.520 --> 2:39:05.120]  theory at this point is this was supposed to be a much larger attack possibly as many as 20 plus
[2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:13.840]  shooters uh explosives involved complete chaos um two points on that one as mr rolls is uh correctly
[2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:18.720]  pointed out several times you can only shoot one gun at a time okay an accountant for yeah i've been
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:25.120]  shooting ars and building ars for 15 years even if one of our two jams there's still 20 plus guns in
[2:39:25.120 --> 2:39:31.120]  that room so i think the reason he got the hotel room early is because he was expecting more co-conspirators
[2:39:31.120 --> 2:39:36.880]  to come to the room to get armed hence the camera system hence the additional death and then and then
[2:39:36.880 --> 2:39:43.680]  he got set up yeah now assuming the other shooters at the beloggio and tropic canna are confirmed
[2:39:43.680 --> 2:39:48.560]  and police did take them out it'd be very telling to find out sure it would probably mean that they
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:53.600]  were going to set him up but still try to get their shots in but then from from our witnesses the
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:39:58.400]  beloggio the cops shot those people or stopped them so looks like they were more on the ground
[2:39:58.400 --> 2:40:03.920]  um yeah and let's see if there's any hotel security footage of those shooters going in and
[2:40:03.920 --> 2:40:07.600]  out of this let me ask you this what do you make of the whole story unraveling so fast
[2:40:09.360 --> 2:40:13.600]  i i think it with this day and age it's inevitable with the amount of technology the cell phone
[2:40:13.600 --> 2:40:18.320]  cameras it it just becomes harder and harder oh the second point i wanted to make was you
[2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:24.160]  heard the police uh the sheriff say that patrick had a plan to escape correct yes so why make a plan
[2:40:24.160 --> 2:40:29.280]  to escape if you're a lone wolf and you have one exit on a 30 well he didn't commit suicide i was
[2:40:29.280 --> 2:40:34.480]  told that by the hrt and they've been proven totally correct absolutely so if you're going to
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:39.040]  have a plan to escape if you think you're going to escape all right it's not going to happen if
[2:40:39.040 --> 2:40:43.360]  you're going to go one on one with squad now if you have multiple shooters spread out throughout
[2:40:43.360 --> 2:40:49.680]  the city all right you have explosives you have 20 plus shooters complete chaos that really really
[2:40:49.680 --> 2:40:55.120]  really increases your chances of not being zeroed in on and that's what the best brains think is
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:40:59.600]  that most people got cold feet warned the crowd and that only two to three shooters were willing
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:05.440]  to carry out the triangulated fire and that's why his brother eric is so squirrely he knew about it
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:11.120]  absolutely last point real quick alec i would just want to remind everybody let's not forget
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:16.960]  about the old you're all going to die lady okay so what more do we know about her we're more
[2:41:16.960 --> 2:41:24.240]  interestingly why don't we know more about her well you sound like you do this professionally
[2:41:24.240 --> 2:41:30.080]  eric we're in the military you're a cop no sir near well i mean the citizens are out there looking
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:34.240]  at this for themselves they're not buying it uh and we and we've got that footage coming up from
[2:41:34.240 --> 2:41:41.440]  the Bellagio and we're going to be playing for folks anything else eric no sir you know since
[2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:45.120]  we mentioned that can we play the lady saying they're all in a dime and other witnesses reportedly
[2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:49.680]  told the cops to us so the cops are looking for who's saying this i mean i think it's clearly not
[2:41:50.640 --> 2:41:55.040]  hotel staff because they would just go tell the cops uh it means probably people that got cold
[2:41:55.040 --> 2:41:59.120]  feet but what a weird way to get cold feet why wouldn't you just call the police and say there's
[2:41:59.120 --> 2:42:04.640]  about to be a mass shooting but then i go back to how do you get all those guns up in that hotel
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:11.120]  room when even top you know when and others top casino owners go we profile you when you leave we
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:17.840]  search your room i mean that's what they do here's the clip of the lady uh that night uh there on
[2:42:17.840 --> 2:42:22.160]  october first talking about being warned you're all going to die so there is a lady who pushed
[2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:27.120]  her way forward into the concert venue under the first row and she started messing with another
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:33.200]  lady and told us that we are all going to die tonight would you know why she was saying that i
[2:42:33.200 --> 2:42:38.480]  mean it was this after she the shots were fired or it was about 45 minutes before the shots were
[2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:44.080]  actually fired but then she was escorted out by security all right folks we're going to go
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:49.760]  to break and come right back thanks for the call eric more calls straight ahead on other issues as
[2:42:49.760 --> 2:42:59.280]  well we're going to go to luke steven b thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry

[2:43:05.360 --> 2:43:12.560]  and prepare a defense 60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:19.040]  they had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for
[2:43:19.040 --> 2:43:24.880]  quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our

[2:47:51.600 --> 2:47:56.880]  mile away renae downs and her husband who's a marine and said you know clearly heard shots right up

[2:48:17.520 --> 2:48:23.040]  that night and another interview she did after that here it is and again this fits into the
[2:48:23.040 --> 2:48:27.520]  direction of the shots close to a mile away but but but but but but but but and then later
[2:48:27.520 --> 2:48:33.680]  bam bam bam bam right up on top at the mandalay right where the shootings we know took place

[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:54.080]  this it's metaphysical there's always this rush to get a video and then it's always at the end

[2:51:38.720 --> 2:51:43.680]  than ever that's a big article out university of new brunswick found canadian students are thinking
[2:51:43.680 --> 2:51:48.160]  more freely about threesomes but are held back by experience because of fear of being stigmatized
[2:51:48.160 --> 2:51:53.600]  no what's happening is they're less sexually active now on average older people are more active
[2:51:53.600 --> 2:51:58.640]  and so they see all this online i think that's what a relationship is until they actually experience
[2:51:58.640 --> 2:52:03.520]  it and it's not all it's cracked up to be just ask anybody i've read about that myself never

[2:52:10.080 --> 2:52:16.000]  here ladies and gentlemen but i mentioned earlier the big article by paul joseph watson

[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:37.120]  people are like this no but it means the new black panther party and other groups including
[2:52:37.120 --> 2:52:43.040]  cnn promote killing white people as if they deserve it because they hype up the few questionable
[2:52:43.040 --> 2:52:49.920]  black deaths as if it's the end of the world to create the racial division totally cold blooded

[2:54:08.080 --> 2:54:12.000]  war on the republican establishment and how they're the main enemy and i totally agree with that i
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:17.680]  want to play his second clip about how corker is quitting because he's a loser and now he may get
[2:54:17.680 --> 2:54:23.520]  indicted so that's why he's attacking trump and he gets into the fact that uh he would get crushed by
[2:54:23.520 --> 2:54:28.480]  marsha blackburn who twitter and others are now censoring but it's only blowing up in their face
[2:54:28.480 --> 2:54:32.720]  so let's go ahead and play this clip then we'll go to break and come back with some more of your
[2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:37.680]  phone calls ahead of the guest host that will be hosting the fourth hour here it is pulled by people
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:45.680]  in the room ben sass john mccain linsey graham uh corker and even mcconnell they trashed the
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:52.160]  president but yet they can't get any of their promises completed i've they are the swamp
[2:54:52.160 --> 2:54:58.160]  republicans are weak and pathetic and they're lacking in identity and the forgotten men and
[2:54:58.160 --> 2:55:03.360]  women the vote of this election are being let down look they hold totally have total contempt
[2:55:03.920 --> 2:55:08.320]  for the forgotten man they have total contempt for the base that's what you saw in alabama
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:13.280]  in alabama where they came in with uh luther strange with 32 million dollars to destroy
[2:55:13.280 --> 2:55:17.760]  judge more you saw at the base thought of them right the base totally rejects them these people
[2:55:17.760 --> 2:55:23.440]  have no respect for the working men and women in the united states i tell you what senator corker
[2:55:23.440 --> 2:55:27.040]  is an absolute disgrace and i agree with jason miller who is the comms director
[2:55:27.040 --> 2:55:31.600]  on our campaign i think one of the best comms people around jason's on cnn but he never talks
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:37.760]  out of school sorry to hear that he well on cnn today he called for senator corker to resign
[2:55:37.760 --> 2:55:42.240]  i agree with him for the governor of tennessee to replace him with marsha blackburn a real
[2:55:42.240 --> 2:55:48.560]  conservative if bob corker has any honor any decency he should resign immediately he should
[2:55:48.560 --> 2:55:53.040]  not let those words stand away said about the president he wouldn't win steve that's why he's
[2:55:53.040 --> 2:55:57.760]  really getting out by the way he got out because he saw what happened in alabama if he wants to
[2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:01.680]  by the way he should get back in because he's gonna get crushed by blackburn would kill he's
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:05.600]  gonna get crushed in a primary he doesn't have the guts to get in so he doesn't have the guts to
[2:56:05.600 --> 2:56:11.200]  get back in the race he should resign there are a bunch of cowards that just want to run around
[2:56:11.200 --> 2:56:16.480]  acting official and powerful when the whole world's moved on everyone hates them and nothing will put
[2:56:16.480 --> 2:56:22.800]  these scumbags back together again by the way paul joseph watson is hosting the fourth hour today

[2:56:42.080 --> 2:56:47.040]  did go to the middle east and he was there earlier than they said the cover-up is imploding another

[3:00:05.680 --> 3:00:10.320]  got a caller here from tokyo i didn't realize but hold on to 30 minutes let's talk about north korea
[3:00:10.320 --> 3:00:17.840]  world war three the poll watch that's coming up live from london england let's go ahead and go to
[3:00:17.840 --> 3:00:25.760]  yoshi in tokyo yoshi you're on the air worldwide that's the jones it's an honor to be here my uh
[3:00:25.760 --> 3:00:32.960]  hundred-year-old grandmother enjoys the caveman well thank you she lost her balance so she keeps
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:38.720]  falling but she never breaks the bone i don't know if it's helping but yeah it's tasty and
[3:00:38.720 --> 3:00:44.800]  and it's really a staple here wow you get it all the way to tokyo thank you for the support sir
[3:00:46.000 --> 3:00:49.760]  yeah the shipping cost is really a pain there's never we'll try to get some international
[3:00:49.760 --> 3:00:54.560]  distributors or something like or maybe have 50 off for folks that are overseas or something to
[3:00:54.560 --> 3:01:00.400]  alleviate that yeah that would significantly increase my purchase as it's because sometimes i buy
[3:01:00.400 --> 3:01:06.640]  something and then one third of the cost is just uh i understand or customs tries to hold it up i know
[3:01:06.640 --> 3:01:12.240]  folks ordering overseas are really uh really really doing it as as a service to us so thank you
[3:01:13.200 --> 3:01:19.760]  oh yeah so anyway so i'm in tokyo i'm half japanese but i've been here most of my life
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:29.120]  the issue is north korea and the belligerent or diplomatic solution and i'm rather disturbed
[3:01:29.120 --> 3:01:38.000]  are sad to see that informers or yourself have taken a stance that there is no diplomatic solution
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:47.760]  but uh i have well i have faith in your ability to read and do research but it seems maybe mister
[3:01:47.760 --> 3:01:56.560]  noticed that there's this old treaty called the agreed framework which uh initially was supposed
[3:01:56.560 --> 3:02:04.960]  to halt uh nuclear weapons development by north korea by stopping their construction of these
[3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:10.000]  nuclear um sure the framework agreement was given reactors and everything and they stopped
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:13.600]  doing it but they gave them reactors they can build the fissile material so i'm aware of all
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:19.040]  those framework agreements when it goes back to like jimmy carter and people right no the framework
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:23.360]  of agreement is under clinton sure the fool that's when they transferred them to stop but i think
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:27.200]  they started negotiations i'm saying with clinton they use jimmy carter as the envoy
[3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:34.960]  yeah but the perhaps the misunderstanding is that giving them the agreement under the agreement is
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:42.160]  to give them uh light water reactors but there was never any funding to do so the u.s congress
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:49.040]  did not want to do so well let me say this i do believe there's diplomatic stuff i don't want a war
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:54.240]  or i've only looked at both sides of this and i i think kim jong-un's a really bad guy and
[3:02:54.240 --> 3:02:59.520]  his firing missiles right over you know the uh your country japan but but i i mean i think
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:03.760]  a war would be disastrous but i know even the japanese government's getting more hard line
[3:03:03.760 --> 3:03:06.960]  with kim jong-un well i mean why do you think that's happening and what do you think should happen
[3:03:08.800 --> 3:03:16.240]  look if japan wasn't such a country because of well being bombed back to the stone age
[3:03:16.240 --> 3:03:22.080]  so to speak and with the new treat constitution and all the brainwashing that the americans
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:30.240]  instituted subsequently to make us feel so thoroughly guilt ridden that we're so we aren't so
[3:03:31.040 --> 3:03:38.480]  militarist but uh economic sanctioned on an extremely poor country won't help at all but
[3:03:38.480 --> 3:03:42.720]  you see uh so don't understand it was just starboard people but you're saying if you had your own
[3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:46.560]  military uh then then then north korea wouldn't be acting like this or what are you saying
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:54.320]  if we did then we probably have already sent special forces in the 80s or 90s to reclaim our
[3:03:54.320 --> 3:04:00.160]  people japan really loves north korea especially after they've abducted our people but that's not
[3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:06.480]  really oh yeah exactly like kim jong-un's father kim jong-il used to kidnap lots of folks just for
[3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:14.160]  his own sexual pleasure sexual pleasure and forcing people to teach uh their spies japanese
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:18.800]  or other other things technical things but there you are saying how bad north korea is and then
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:22.720]  and then we're bad for saying they're bad i mean i'm just not gonna say they're good that's all
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:31.440]  so yeah that's that's a given they're universally hated and uh as uh one of the phrases we like to
[3:04:31.440 --> 3:04:40.560]  say is that north korea is like the the uh vial armpit of asia nobody wants to get well it's
[3:04:40.560 --> 3:04:44.640]  certainly an oppressive communist regime thank you for the call yoshi thanks for your support call
[3:04:44.640 --> 3:04:54.400]  back again i'd love to talk longer whole watch is coming up stay with us it was thomas jefferson
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:58.240]  who once said that our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what rodeo will
[3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:03.200]  pass to destruction to wit by consolidation of power first and then corruption its necessary
[3:05:03.200 --> 3:05:07.440]  consequence jefferson was warning us about the global elite the one percent of the one percent
[3:05:07.440 --> 3:05:12.080]  consolidating the world's wealth and subverting the people's voice in government unfortunately we
[3:05:12.080 --> 3:05:16.800]  didn't heed his advice we now live in a neo feudalistic society which were treated as indentured
[3:05:16.800 --> 3:05:21.280]  servants who only exist to serve the needs of the establishment political office no longer represents
[3:05:21.280 --> 3:05:25.840]  the voice of the people but rather the initiation process politicians go through to gain acceptance
[3:05:25.840 --> 3:05:30.320]  into the aristocracy simply put we the people are responsible for civilization and culture yet
[3:05:30.320 --> 3:05:34.160]  we're suppressed by a tiny elite who have organized into criminal gangs that operate governments
[3:05:34.160 --> 3:05:38.880]  around the world we falsely believe that everything is simply black and white one extreme against the
[3:05:38.880 --> 3:05:43.600]  other conservative versus liberal but things will change once more of us realize this truth as thomas
[3:05:43.600 --> 3:05:48.320]  jefferson also said enlighten the people generally and tyranny and oppressions of the body and mind
[3:05:48.320 --> 3:06:03.600]  will vanish like evil spirits at the dawn of day this is kit daniels within full wars dot com
[3:06:05.840 --> 3:06:10.400]  we alive it is the fourth hour of the alex jones show coming up at the bottom of the hour we
[3:06:10.400 --> 3:06:15.680]  have a special guest he's an actor and a model young guy just making his way in the world
[3:06:15.680 --> 3:06:21.920]  he was fired for supporting donald trump he was fired for being a conservative he's going to tell
[3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:27.360]  you the full story it ties into the whole harvey winestein situation which is still blowing up
[3:06:27.360 --> 3:06:32.960]  hillary clinton it took hillary clinton less than what five hours to blame the nla for the last
[3:06:32.960 --> 3:06:40.880]  vegas massacre it took her five days to disavow to finally condemn harvey winestein this is cnn
[3:06:40.880 --> 3:06:46.640]  hillary can hillary clinton condemns longtime democratic donor harvey winestein hillary clinton
[3:06:46.640 --> 3:06:51.520]  condemned disgrace hollywood executive harvey winestein on tuesday marking her first public
[3:06:51.520 --> 3:06:56.320]  comments on the matter since reports of his alleged predatory behavior broke five days ago
[3:06:57.040 --> 3:07:01.200]  so is she going to give the one million plus dollars that harvey winestein donated to her
[3:07:01.200 --> 3:07:09.040]  campaign to a rape victims charity don't hold your breath she said quote the behavior described
[3:07:09.040 --> 3:07:16.480]  by women cannot be tolerated that's what hillary clinton said about harvey winestein the behavior
[3:07:16.480 --> 3:07:21.680]  described by women cannot be tolerated unless your name is bill clinton of course and then hillary
[3:07:21.680 --> 3:07:28.320]  will not only tolerate that behavior she'll intimidate the victims on your behalf so she's
[3:07:28.320 --> 3:07:34.800]  finally condemned it after five days we have countless hollywood celebrities who have worked
[3:07:34.800 --> 3:07:40.560]  closely with winestein who have spiked this story who have helped get this story spiked in the past
[3:07:41.120 --> 3:07:53.120]  still refusing to come out matt daemon it's amazing the most self-righteous people the most
[3:07:53.120 --> 3:07:58.160]  vehement self-righteous people on every other issue which which is what matt daemon is those are
[3:07:58.160 --> 3:08:02.880]  always the people who have the biggest skeletons in the closet he was one of the guys who made the
[3:08:02.880 --> 3:08:09.280]  phone call back in 2004 when this was about to blow up in the new york times they spiked it
[3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:15.200]  it was matt daemon and ben afleck well even ben afleck now has been forced to come out five days
[3:08:15.200 --> 3:08:21.280]  later and disavow but again after everybody else already did it he was the what he was the first
[3:08:21.280 --> 3:08:27.360]  one that should have disavowed it because he helped spike this story back in 2004 when the new york
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:34.000]  times had it and they sunk it so this continues to rumble of course we had new revelations today
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:39.600]  the new yorkers put out a giant article which i've read most of it it'll tell you about an hour to
[3:08:39.600 --> 3:08:46.400]  read the whole thing describing detailing what these victims actually went through and it really
[3:08:46.400 --> 3:08:52.560]  puts to shame those people who have been claiming over the past few days that there's any equivalency
[3:08:52.560 --> 3:09:00.640]  between the trump grabber by the you know what tape and the serial mechanized industrial abuse
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:06.880]  the harvey weinstein raw over the course of three decades remember we had stelter brian stelter of
[3:09:06.880 --> 3:09:13.200]  cnn we had rob briner come out yesterday a couple of days ago and say oh this is trump is even worse
[3:09:13.840 --> 3:09:20.400]  trump's locker room talk is worse than this guy allegedly raping women if you read about the
[3:09:20.400 --> 3:09:25.520]  details of it we can't get into the details of it because that's a graphic he's comparing a
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:30.720]  trump's hollywood access tape well he said you know they let them grab you by the you know what
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:38.800]  to actual incidents where harvey weinstein would lure these women frightened young women often
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:44.640]  less than 25 years old a lot of them he would lure them to his hotel room he would strip down naked
[3:09:44.640 --> 3:09:51.440]  expose himself basically grab their head and force them to perform oral sex which is rape
[3:09:52.160 --> 3:09:58.160]  they're comparing that to trump laughing and saying oh yeah these women throw themselves at you
[3:09:58.160 --> 3:10:03.600]  they'll let you grab by the way this guy could get any stars that wanted a job to do it or the
[3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:08.960]  best call girls he wanted the power over these young women particularly young 18 years old you
[3:10:08.960 --> 3:10:13.520]  name it he wanted them to basically vomit while the pig creature raped them reportedly
[3:10:13.520 --> 3:10:18.240]  no that's exactly it he wanted the power he could have he could have paid for prostitutes
[3:10:18.240 --> 3:10:23.280]  he was a multi-millionaire this is a quote alex from the new york hospital is one of the victims
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:28.720]  weinstein's worth billions chart go ahead yeah this is one of the victims this is a quote i was
[3:10:28.720 --> 3:10:33.280]  very petrified but i didn't want to show him that i was petrified because i could feel
[3:10:33.280 --> 3:10:38.320]  that the more i was freaking out the more he was excited now this is a young woman who was again
[3:10:38.320 --> 3:10:42.960]  was lured up to his hotel room on false pretenses they were often told oh yeah there's going to
[3:10:42.960 --> 3:10:47.840]  be another woman there to discuss a business arrangement or whatever she added it was like a
[3:10:47.840 --> 3:10:54.560]  hunter with a wild animal the fear turns him on she said she was leaving and he panicked we haven't
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:11:00.080]  done anything she remembered him saying it's like being in a walt Disney movie so the fear that these
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:07.280]  women showed the more nervous and frightened they got the more it turned him on so that's what it was
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:12.880]  all about this is a more kind of a serial killer thing and that's why they're in the kids it's because
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:19.600]  it's about panicking people yeah it's like the hunters like what he says like seeing the animal
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:26.480]  panic the predator gets more excited the more the animal panics they'd savor the kill even more
[3:11:27.040 --> 3:11:31.840]  and that's the same kind of attitude that these victims describe with harvey weinstein
[3:11:31.840 --> 3:11:39.440]  you've got his allies still coming out fashion designer donna caron defending him she basically
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:44.000]  said these women were asking for it now that's an important distinction to make of course
[3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:49.360]  none of these women are asking for it by the way they dress the way they behave in many cases they
[3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:56.400]  were lured they were procured under false pretenses it wasn't a date situation it was a business
[3:11:56.400 --> 3:12:01.760]  situation in the vast majority of these cases where these women were raped they were going there for
[3:12:01.760 --> 3:12:06.480]  a meeting they thought they'd get a business opportunity it wasn't a romantic thing so again
[3:12:06.480 --> 3:12:11.680]  to compare it to the trump grab them by the you know what tape is a complete misnomer you have
[3:12:11.680 --> 3:12:17.360]  to make that distinction these were frightened young women this wasn't a romantic situation
[3:12:17.360 --> 3:12:24.000]  now there is a situation where certain women some women are predatory and will throw themselves
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:31.440]  at famous men because power is an aphrodisiac that's the context of the trump hollywood access tape
[3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:36.800]  has nothing to do with rape it's trump talking about predatory women who throw themselves at
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:42.000]  famous men if you want to deny that that exists then fine you're living in an alternate reality
[3:12:42.000 --> 3:12:48.960]  it does but again that's some women not all women these women described in these cases were not
[3:12:48.960 --> 3:12:54.320]  meeting him under any kind of pretenses they weren't interested in him sexually or romantically
[3:12:54.320 --> 3:13:00.560]  he's a big fat blob he's a horrible individual this was completely predatory on the part of
[3:13:00.560 --> 3:13:05.520]  Weinstein so to blame the victims which of course is what we hear in the cases of um
[3:13:06.400 --> 3:13:11.520]  islamic grooming especially over in this country leftist blaming the victims because
[3:13:11.520 --> 3:13:16.560]  they're wearing skirts or whatever they're walking through the streets at night we see it once again
[3:13:16.560 --> 3:13:22.000]  with the left in this case with the big fashion designer coming out and defending him despite
[3:13:22.000 --> 3:13:28.240]  the fact that again when you get into the details of this there's no there's no room for defense
[3:13:28.240 --> 3:13:31.360]  and paul let me just add one point if i can and i'm gonna get out here but i've been
[3:13:31.360 --> 3:13:36.080]  eating my lunch watching you break this down the very same feminist people are coming out
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:40.960]  defending him these older feminist women are coming out saying oh these women asked for it
[3:13:40.960 --> 3:13:45.520]  well they these are the same feminists that claim all men are rapist and western culture is evil
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:50.320]  but they love islam and so the very hollywood that covered this up is the one telling us that the
[3:13:50.320 --> 3:13:56.240]  west is bad while they defend islam because they get off on the power that islam has over women
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:14:03.120]  these are truly deviant evil people as you've been saying no they're the first ones to blame i mean
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:08.080]  look at the college rape hoax they claim that one in four one in five women were going to be
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:13.200]  victims of rape on college campuses they based that on a study which was completely out of the
[3:14:13.200 --> 3:14:19.440]  norm based on an an adult community center in one instance and suddenly that became a narrative
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:24.560]  echoed across the world even obama started talking about it but when it's one of their own
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:30.800]  it literally takes them five days five days after these revelations come out to finally
[3:14:30.800 --> 3:14:36.240]  distance themselves from it and you've still got people like michael moore who praised winstein in
[3:14:36.240 --> 3:14:43.120]  a 2015 tweet basically said he was amazing to work with michael moore has still not disavowed even
[3:14:43.120 --> 3:14:49.200]  after the onrush even after the deluge of people who disavowed today including ben afleck you've
[3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:54.400]  got michael moore you've got matt daemon in fact i tweeted about it collin furth another one who
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:59.200]  worked closely with winstein who has not disavowed and again these are the same people who will
[3:15:00.160 --> 3:15:04.640]  line up and attack trump all day for not disavowing david do during the campaign
[3:15:04.640 --> 3:15:09.120]  even though he did over and over again do you disavow do you disavow yes i disavow
[3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:14.320]  a week later do you disavow yes i disavow they're obsessed with disavowals as soon as it's their
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:21.200]  turn to disavow anything they go awol matt daemon michael moore collin furth brad pit
[3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:26.880]  leonardo de caprio rossel crow and again it's always these actors like leonardo de caprio it
[3:15:26.880 --> 3:15:32.080]  was so vehement and morally righteous about all their little pet political issues and they'll never
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:37.520]  shut up about them while being complete hypocrites like with de caprio taking private jets everywhere
[3:15:37.520 --> 3:15:44.000]  hanging out on giant yachts with oil billionaires while lecturing you about your energies they're
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:48.400]  always the same kind of people so vehement so right just leon dignan and they're the ones who
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:54.720]  are completely silent all of them bodies with wine steen all of them remain silent because i'm

[3:22:28.800 --> 3:22:34.560]  Weinstein revelations in recent days now the deluge of celebrities and politicians on the
[3:22:34.560 --> 3:22:40.320]  left finally coming forward with their disavowals too little too late of course on the first night
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:47.440]  of this or the first couple of nights the late night comedy shows which railed endlessly about
[3:22:47.440 --> 3:22:54.080]  Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly did not mention this once they finally had to all mention it
[3:22:54.080 --> 3:22:58.560]  in unison last night and make jokes about it because of course the previous night they had
[3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:04.880]  written the jokes and they were basically sworn off telling them protection once again if you
[3:23:04.880 --> 3:23:10.640]  find out about the level of abuse the sheer level of abuse that Weinstein got away with for so long
[3:23:10.640 --> 3:23:16.400]  he had to have powerful protectors at every single level of Hollywood and of course many of those
[3:23:16.400 --> 3:23:22.800]  same people work within television as well so why do you think it took all this time all this public
[3:23:22.800 --> 3:23:29.200]  pressure to make these people come forward and to make those late night talk show hosts actually
[3:23:29.200 --> 3:23:35.920]  have to mention this now we're going to go to this clip which is basically a Weinstein with
[3:23:35.920 --> 3:23:42.080]  one of his victims now from what I read I believe they're stood outside his hotel room he's basically
[3:23:42.080 --> 3:23:46.480]  trying to go into the hotel room and get naked which is what he tried to do in almost every
[3:23:46.480 --> 3:23:51.680]  instance he's trying to convince this woman to come into the room with him having already
[3:23:51.680 --> 3:23:58.400]  groped her previously let's go to this clip i'm telling you right now what do we have to do here

[3:25:35.120 --> 3:25:44.560]  please you're making a big scene here so there you hear harvey weinstein again trying to groom
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:49.520]  this poor woman trying to basically verbally beat her down to come into his hotel room you heard him
[3:25:49.520 --> 3:25:55.440]  say there that he was used to it what did he mean by that well that was revealed in a separate
[3:25:55.440 --> 3:26:01.840]  instance where he bragged about being used to women saying no and they said no over and over
[3:26:01.840 --> 3:26:08.400]  and over again until he pressured them into it either physically or via verbal intimidation threats
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:14.160]  that he would ruin their careers if they didn't go along with it so that's what he meant when he said
[3:26:14.160 --> 3:26:19.680]  oh i'm used to it when she kept saying no no no i don't want to go in i don't want to go in and
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:25.440]  going back to what i said before he got excitement according to one of his victims he would he got
[3:26:25.440 --> 3:26:32.000]  excited the more they resisted the more frightened they became that actually turned him on this is
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:37.440]  the level of depravity that we're dealing with here let's read another quote from the new york
[3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:43.520]  article again from one of his female victims i was very petrified again that's the one we just
[3:26:44.240 --> 3:26:52.160]  read out she said that he got off on her freaking out i mean that's basically serial killer mentality
[3:26:52.160 --> 3:26:56.640]  not that he's a serial killer but it's the same kind of mentality there's another quote
[3:26:57.840 --> 3:27:02.160]  and it's by the same woman who said quote i know that everybody i mean everybody in
[3:27:02.160 --> 3:27:08.160]  hollywood knows that it's happening of course that was before the last couple of days of revelations
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:13.760]  when nobody had come out and disavowed it so everybody knew about it back then he's been
[3:27:13.760 --> 3:27:19.920]  getting away with it for three decades same thing with the jimmy savill pedophile scandal over in
[3:27:19.920 --> 3:27:25.440]  britain where everybody in the entertainment industry in britain knew about it and he got away
[3:27:25.440 --> 3:27:33.120]  with it because he was being protected by higher ups who's protecting harvey winestein who was
[3:27:33.120 --> 3:27:39.680]  protecting him at least for the past three decades that will probably never come to life will it
[3:27:40.320 --> 3:27:45.520]  we do know that matt daemon who still hasn't come out and disavowed him this is out of the daily mail
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:51.040]  matt daemon called spineless profiteer who stays silent by harvey winestein victim rose mcgowan
[3:27:51.840 --> 3:27:55.760]  matt daemon may soon be forced to comment on the decades of sexual harassment harvey winestein
[3:27:55.760 --> 3:28:00.080]  inflicted upon his staff and a number of hollywood actresses after one of those stars took aim at the
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:06.480]  oscar winning writer and star of goodwill hunting again this is about how they found out what they
[3:28:06.480 --> 3:28:14.800]  knew about the fact that winestein's procura was being paid 400 000 a year for a role in a film
[3:28:14.800 --> 3:28:20.640]  company when he was doing nothing whatsoever in that film company his entire job was to procure
[3:28:20.640 --> 3:28:27.440]  women so that harvey winestein could try and sexually abuse them matt daemon according to
[3:28:27.440 --> 3:28:34.240]  this article and russell crow knew about it they made phone calls that spiked an investigation in
[3:28:34.240 --> 3:28:44.240]  the new york times back in 2004 13 years ago they helped cover it up absolutely incredible

[3:33:37.280 --> 3:33:44.080]  guest now because as i've been discussing we've seen how hollywood treats alleged serial sex
[3:33:44.080 --> 3:33:51.360]  abusers lets them get away with it defends them for 30 years plus in the case of harvey winestein
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:55.280]  now we're going to see we're going to take a look into how hollywood in the entertainment
[3:33:55.280 --> 3:34:00.880]  industry treats people with conservative beliefs and we're talking to our guest who is
[3:34:00.880 --> 3:34:06.640]  lucas dozer a young model an actor and we're going to get his side of the story of what happened
[3:34:06.640 --> 3:34:11.600]  to him you're going to want to hear this and he is live with us now lucas welcome to the show
[3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:19.200]  hi thanks for having me good to have you now you're a young model actor you you were hired by
[3:34:19.200 --> 3:34:24.480]  this agency you signed a contract with them if you want to name the agency that's up to you
[3:34:24.480 --> 3:34:32.400]  but tell us what happened over the past week or so well basically um so as you said a year and a
[3:34:32.400 --> 3:34:39.360]  half ago i was given the opportunity to work with this agency and during this time um i developed
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:50.480]  a presence on social media um but the agency was it's the fact that um i was expressing my views
[3:34:50.480 --> 3:34:57.040]  politically and specifically they really disliked a photo that i had on facebook with a it was
[3:34:57.040 --> 3:35:03.360]  president trump with a caption that read my president um and a few months later so like last
[3:35:03.360 --> 3:35:11.520]  week um i was informed that my um by email that my contract had been terminated due to my polarizing
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:17.520]  views and it's it's important to remember that polarizing to the to the left is anything that i
[3:35:17.520 --> 3:35:24.080]  mean factual that they can't agree with and now paul something like this definitely wouldn't have
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:30.080]  happened if um i would have encouraged blowing up the white house like madonna did publicly
[3:35:30.080 --> 3:35:35.040]  and it wouldn't have happened if i supported kneeling for the anthem or for the flag of the
[3:35:35.040 --> 3:35:41.520]  united states and definitely wouldn't have happened if um i would have been um making threats like
[3:35:41.520 --> 3:35:49.280]  we see many leftists do on social media towards our president and so you were posting this these
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:57.360]  pro-trump memes and i mean let's get it clear you're 16 17 now right yeah i'm 17 so you're
[3:35:57.360 --> 3:36:03.440]  not even old enough to vote but they were so triggered they were so insecure at the fact that
[3:36:03.440 --> 3:36:11.040]  you had god forbid conservative political opinions you posted some things uh tell us exactly the
[3:36:11.040 --> 3:36:16.240]  process of how they informed you and then what happened what was your response to them basically
[3:36:16.240 --> 3:36:22.560]  threatening to fire you right yeah so like i just received an email one day and i mean
[3:36:22.560 --> 3:36:29.760]  they just told me that um they weren't going to um they don't want to be associated with someone
[3:36:29.760 --> 3:36:36.720]  that has the views the polarizing views which i had according to them of course and they yeah
[3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:42.400]  they just said that they won't appreciate and they don't have a placement for me at the agency
[3:36:44.400 --> 3:36:52.000]  absolutely insane so a 17 year old kid they were so triggered by this so left
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:57.600]  perplexed by this like they've never had it before they've never seen anyone god forbid express
[3:36:57.600 --> 3:37:03.360]  conservative political beliefs now is there any kind of legal recourse on this are you gonna try
[3:37:03.360 --> 3:37:08.240]  and pursue it legally or you're just gonna leave it as it is for now and try and get a contract
[3:37:08.240 --> 3:37:15.120]  with another agency you know i think i mean i've got input from many of my other friends and they
[3:37:15.120 --> 3:37:19.520]  just said that you know if they're not going to accept you there then just try somewhere else
[3:37:19.520 --> 3:37:24.720]  and i mean i'm probably not going to sue them just because i mean my attorney said that it's
[3:37:24.720 --> 3:37:32.800]  freedom of speech so i mean i think i'm just gonna leave it as it is um and just find work
[3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:41.280]  with another agency that will actually appreciate my work absolutely incredible just to make it
[3:37:41.280 --> 3:37:46.400]  clear to people james woods came out a couple years ago and said the reason he doesn't expect
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:52.240]  to work in hollywood again is that he criticized obama we literally now have to have clandestine
[3:37:52.240 --> 3:37:58.080]  secret societies of conservatives in hollywood where they can meet and express their opinions
[3:37:58.080 --> 3:38:03.040]  without fear of censure without people and being in fear of people destroying their careers
[3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:07.520]  on the flip side we've got this harvey weinstein thing which we'll get into in a moment but
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:13.040]  i mean lucas did you have any idea going into this industry as a young man trying to get a
[3:38:13.040 --> 3:38:19.600]  start in this industry how utterly intolerant they are and what does it say about them that they
[3:38:19.600 --> 3:38:26.880]  react in this way to a 17 year old guy with conservative political opinions you know going
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:31.360]  into this industry i know that like i mean you have to be a liberal a real liberal in the
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:38.000]  entertainment industry and if you're publicly a conservative you're seen as a racist as a
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:46.160]  sexist all these things that the left is seeing us and um honestly i think it's just upsetting with
[3:38:46.160 --> 3:38:52.160]  everything i mean there are many many people in hollywood um that are not appreciative of
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:38:56.080]  conservatives and are they say that they're tolerant of other ideologies well it doesn't
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:39:01.840]  seem like they truly are i mean you look at stacy dash you look at all these other actresses um
[3:39:01.840 --> 3:39:09.360]  that were actually fired and like not um they didn't want to their agencies or whatever clients
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:15.200]  didn't want to associate themselves with someone that's a conservative now we've seen hollywood
[3:39:15.200 --> 3:39:20.160]  losing money in fact i'm going to do a big video on this in a couple of days time their box office
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:25.280]  receipts are down now even on what they were in 2002 despite the fact that they have way more
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:31.280]  screens they had the worst summer i believe in terms of box office income in 15 years the worst
[3:39:31.280 --> 3:39:36.800]  summer box office income in hollywood do you think that's to do with this kind of virtue
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:42.320]  signaling that we see inserted into everything at the movie level at the tv level the americans
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:48.240]  are finally starting to get jaded they're finally starting to switch off or do you think the reason
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:39:53.520]  why hollywood's starting to struggle in terms of income is basically that people are making crappy
[3:39:53.520 --> 3:39:59.360]  movies they have no imagination you know everything's a superhero sequel but do you think also there's
[3:39:59.360 --> 3:40:05.120]  some level of uh you know jaded sentimentality among americans where they see now that hollywood
[3:40:05.680 --> 3:40:12.320]  in the culture war is basically being used as a political tool to bludgeon people into compliance
[3:40:12.320 --> 3:40:17.840]  into carrying into adopting leftist dogmas and they've just stopped caring about their primary
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:23.520]  role which is to make good movies what do you think about that well i definitely agree with you i
[3:40:23.520 --> 3:40:29.680]  think that the fact is the man like americans are really upset with the fact and i mean you just look
[3:40:29.680 --> 3:40:35.760]  at the nfo i mean you have the ratings down why because you're targeting our flag you're targeting
[3:40:35.760 --> 3:40:41.360]  our anthem and it's despicable and the american people we can see if they're not intolerant we've
[3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:46.480]  seen it with the election of president trump they're sick and tired of all these um of the
[3:40:46.480 --> 3:40:52.960]  establishment in hollywood and in washington um you see all the corrupt corruption of the lies
[3:40:52.960 --> 3:41:00.480]  the secrets the uh dark side of hollywood and that's um you see that trend in washington dc as well
[3:41:00.480 --> 3:41:06.000]  and the american people aren't going to tolerate it and that's why um the numbers are low for hollywood
[3:41:07.760 --> 3:41:11.920]  now talking about the dark side of hollywood obviously today we've been talking about these
[3:41:11.920 --> 3:41:17.600]  harvey weinstein revelations in the past we've had revelations from other hollywood
[3:41:17.600 --> 3:41:21.840]  child actors obviously you you're not in the industry fully yet but you you may have some
[3:41:21.840 --> 3:41:28.000]  knowledge of this of this sexual abuse at some levels it's it's the harvey weinstein type at
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:33.200]  other levels it's actually uh accusations of pedophilia in hollywood of course we had the whole
[3:41:33.200 --> 3:41:39.920]  roman polanski scandal which rumbled on for decades with people like meryl streep saying that she was
[3:41:39.920 --> 3:41:45.600]  sorry he was in jail some of the same people that were close to harvey weinstein have defended
[3:41:45.600 --> 3:41:50.880]  roman polanski in the past just from your experience which i know is going to be limited at this stage
[3:41:50.880 --> 3:41:56.720]  but have you heard these stories about this mass sexual abuse problem within hollywood
[3:41:56.720 --> 3:42:03.360]  uh just from being just from getting into the industry yeah definitely i mean um i've read
[3:42:03.360 --> 3:42:08.000]  into all these things and i'm really disgusted by all these allegations and definitely don't want
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:14.400]  to glorify these actions however what is troubling is that neither for example with the uh weinstein
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:21.040]  case um neither hillary nor obama have called out these allegations even uh given that they nearly
[3:42:21.040 --> 3:42:27.760]  nearly uh ruined trump's um trump after allegations against him surfaced and it's just yet another
[3:42:27.760 --> 3:42:32.960]  example of the hypocrisy on the left and them just turning a blind eye whenever monetary campaign
[3:42:32.960 --> 3:42:38.160]  donations are involved all right stay there lucas is that we'll be back after the break don't go away

[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:19.360]  day after day alone on a hill the man with the foolish grain is keeping perfectly
[3:47:19.360 --> 3:47:24.320]  we are live this is the fourth hour of the alex jones show talking to lucas dozer who is a
[3:47:24.320 --> 3:47:30.400]  young up and coming model an actor who was told who was informed by his agency that he would be
[3:47:30.400 --> 3:47:36.640]  fired because of his political support on social media he wasn't even an activist he wasn't really
[3:47:36.640 --> 3:47:42.240]  that visible he was just expressing support for conservative ideas for donald trump on twitter
[3:47:42.240 --> 3:47:48.800]  that he would be fired if he did not remove those post lucas they actually said if you remove the
[3:47:48.800 --> 3:47:53.200]  post then things might get better and they might keep you on that's what they told you right
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:47:59.440]  yeah they did that's exactly what they told me after i had a meeting with them um a few months
[3:47:59.440 --> 3:48:06.720]  back and you know obviously i kind of said no i didn't want to remove my posts and i think
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:12.560]  that if i was going to lose my job then i for supporting the president then that's kind of
[3:48:12.560 --> 3:48:19.760]  silly you know it's amazing i mean we have an industry with hollywood that protects this
[3:48:19.760 --> 3:48:27.040]  serious this serial sexual abuser of women harvey winstein for 30 plus years it takes most of them
[3:48:27.040 --> 3:48:33.200]  five days to come out and disavow him that's the kind of thing that they will tolerate for 30 years
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:40.800]  you've got conservative views as a 16 17 year old up and coming actor and that cannot be tolerated
[3:48:40.800 --> 3:48:47.120]  absolutely incredible even with tv now you've got you know tim allen he had the big hit show with abc
[3:48:47.120 --> 3:48:53.520]  for the time slot he was doing really well last man standing that got cancelled we speculated it
[3:48:53.520 --> 3:48:59.200]  was because of his conservative views which again weren't even that vehemently expressed but he later
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:04.400]  came out and confirmed that that was probably why they cancelled it you've got a hollywood secret
[3:49:04.400 --> 3:49:09.520]  society where they literally have to have clandestine meetings you've got people coming out blowing the
[3:49:09.520 --> 3:49:15.040]  whistle elijah would the lord of the ring star came out last year and said that he was preyed upon
[3:49:15.040 --> 3:49:21.440]  as a child actor you got a big pedophile problem in the music industry in hollywood you've got big
[3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:27.760]  serial sexual abusers but no you're the problem a 17 year old with a twitter account absolutely
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:33.520]  incredible i mean does it does it put you off pursuing your career knowing how ridiculously
[3:49:33.520 --> 3:49:40.800]  hypocritical and in fact dirty and seedy that this industry is you know i don't think it really
[3:49:40.800 --> 3:49:47.120]  puts me off i just think it kind of empowers me i want to go into this industry i know it's hard
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:52.960]  as a conservative and but i'm still going to fight it and i've set my goals high and i'm
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:57.840]  going to follow them regardless of what others say or what others think of my political views
[3:49:57.840 --> 3:50:02.480]  so at no stage did you think oh i i can just hide my political views and things are going to be a
[3:50:02.480 --> 3:50:09.200]  lot easier that thought process never crossed your mind right uh i would say maybe it did for a
[3:50:09.200 --> 3:50:14.240]  for a short period of time but then i thought like where's the freedom of speech i mean i'm going to
[3:50:14.240 --> 3:50:19.600]  express my opinions i mean they're not as long as i'm not threatening someone i'm going to support
[3:50:19.600 --> 3:50:25.040]  my president i'm going to be proud of my country and i'm going to be proud of my flag and i'm going
[3:50:25.040 --> 3:50:31.520]  to be proud of everything american i'm not going to hide that amazing well it's it's not a surprise
[3:50:31.520 --> 3:50:35.920]  that it happened i guess the only surprise is that you're so young and yet they got so insecure
[3:50:35.920 --> 3:50:40.880]  and targeted you for it anyway that's a surprising angle a bit i just think close in here tell people
[3:50:40.880 --> 3:50:48.000]  how they can follow you on twitter and any other information you want to tell them about well exactly
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:52.640]  go follow please i would like to ask for everyone to follow on twitter i'm going to be posting more
[3:50:52.640 --> 3:50:59.040]  information about the entire story the process and everything i mean i'm trying to get in contact
[3:50:59.040 --> 3:51:04.640]  i'm still trying to get in contact with the agency but definitely i've had some supporters
[3:51:04.640 --> 3:51:10.080]  already like sending threatening messages and i condemned any threatening messages that were
[3:51:10.080 --> 3:51:14.080]  sent toward the agency i don't think that as conservatives we should be doing things like
[3:51:14.080 --> 3:51:20.080]  that we should be better than what the leftists are doing living in chicago i can see on a daily
[3:51:20.080 --> 3:51:27.520]  basis what the left is doing in the streets and i don't want any threats or negative things going
[3:51:27.520 --> 3:51:33.120]  towards the agency i just think that we i'm going to get through this one way or another
[3:51:34.400 --> 3:51:39.440]  all right we'll leave it there but kudos to you for standing up for your beliefs lucas dozer thanks
[3:51:39.440 --> 3:51:46.640]  for joining us today thanks for having me again my pleasure there goes lucas again no surprise
[3:51:46.640 --> 3:51:51.360]  that that's how hollywood reacts that's how they handle people coming into the industry
[3:51:51.360 --> 3:51:56.560]  not even established actors who come out and god forbid express conservative beliefs i guess
[3:51:56.560 --> 3:52:01.360]  once they get to a beachhead where they're actually successful then they have some level
[3:52:01.360 --> 3:52:08.640]  of protection but for them to be this i rate this intent on not even allowing people with
[3:52:08.640 --> 3:52:13.200]  conservative opinions to get in the industry in the first place as obviously they tried to do
[3:52:13.200 --> 3:52:17.600]  that's the incredible aspect of this story that i wanted to bring to people's attention
[3:52:17.600 --> 3:52:24.400]  we got a few minutes left here though so let's dip into some final news stories zero hedge reports
[3:52:24.400 --> 3:52:30.000]  home depot panics over millenials forced to host tutorials on using tape measures and hammering
[3:52:30.000 --> 3:52:35.920]  nails millenials are such crybabies that they're obviously they've spent a lot more time being
[3:52:35.920 --> 3:52:40.880]  offended over people using the wrong pronouns and things like that that they don't have
[3:52:40.880 --> 3:52:47.280]  basic life skills it mentions mopping the floor most of them don't know how to mop a floor and
[3:52:47.280 --> 3:52:52.880]  now home depot another businesses like that are starting to freak out they're actually putting
[3:52:52.880 --> 3:53:00.880]  out how to videos on how to mop floors use tape measures and hammer nails this is an actual
[3:53:00.880 --> 3:53:07.920]  business concern from home depot from scott's miracle grow as well who point out in this
[3:53:07.920 --> 3:53:15.840]  article that a lot of millenials don't know that plants need sunlight to grow or they die
[3:53:15.840 --> 3:53:21.040]  the millenials don't understand that they're keeping their plants in their basement or wherever
[3:53:21.040 --> 3:53:27.440]  and they're all dying because they've got no idea about basic biology or how to use a tape measure
[3:53:27.440 --> 3:53:34.240]  or how to how can how can anyone not know how to mop a floor this is literally like baby level
[3:53:34.240 --> 3:53:40.240]  skills but they're freaking out about it they're having to put out all these how-to videos to
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:46.720]  train people the most basic of basic skills what does that tell you about this generation
[3:53:47.680 --> 3:53:51.840]  the anti-trump late night comedy lineup keeps plummeting this is an article out of
[3:53:51.840 --> 3:53:56.240]  Washington Examiner and they point out that while America was laughing at Twitter and
[3:53:56.240 --> 3:54:02.320]  watching YouTube videos late night was slipping and again this is the point I got into in the
[3:54:02.320 --> 3:54:08.240]  previous segment Hollywood is losing money they're hemorrhaging their audience because again
[3:54:08.240 --> 3:54:14.240]  these movies these TV shows have been turned into political weapons when the primary focus
[3:54:14.240 --> 3:54:21.760]  is identity politics virtue signaling and amplifying leftist political dogmas they lose focus of
[3:54:21.760 --> 3:54:28.720]  their primary role what it should be which is to make entertaining content I mean look at Steven
[3:54:28.720 --> 3:54:36.640]  Colbert every single night Trump this Trump that I mean you expect a bit of it yeah but it's just
[3:54:36.640 --> 3:54:43.840]  relentless anything he does anything he tweets and it's quite nasty of course with Steven Colbert
[3:54:44.640 --> 3:54:49.200]  he isn't writing most of it but it just shows you the people behind the scenes are jumping on this
[3:54:49.200 --> 3:54:54.320]  train you've now got Hollywood producers you've got TV executives telling them that they're not
[3:54:54.320 --> 3:55:00.480]  being political enough that Americans should have more of this ram down their throats it's not
[3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:07.520]  working people are turning out in droves tuning out in droves I should say writing in the Federalist
[3:55:07.520 --> 3:55:14.080]  Ben Dominic points out that the late night viewership of ABC CBS plus NBC this week barely
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:21.920]  broke 8 million viewers combined not long ago retired NBC funny man Jay Leno was bringing in 6 million
[3:55:21.920 --> 3:55:28.000]  viewers all on his own what caused the networks comics to start flopping obviously the generational
[3:55:28.000 --> 3:55:33.120]  demographics and technological developments can't be discounted millennials don't watch as much
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:38.720]  television but again some of it is due to virtue signaling because then if you look at the news
[3:55:38.720 --> 3:55:45.840]  channels Sean Hannity is kicking their butt people are tuning out and it's not the sole reason
[3:55:45.840 --> 3:55:51.760]  obviously Netflix or their options YouTube are a big part of it but they're tuning out because
[3:55:51.760 --> 3:55:58.800]  they're getting jaded with this relentless politicization of comedy of sports of movies of
[3:55:58.800 --> 3:56:06.560]  music of entertainment and the quality is declining the quality is noticeably declining people are
[3:56:06.560 --> 3:56:11.680]  tuning out of course over on YouTube you've got the late night comedy channels doing quite well
