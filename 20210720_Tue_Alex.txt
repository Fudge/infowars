[00:30.000 --> 00:42.360]  It's Tuesday, July 20th of the year, is 2021, and I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are
[00:42.360 --> 00:46.160]  seeing history take place in front of all of our eyes.
[00:46.160 --> 00:53.840]  We're seeing world government with the express aim of sterilizing and killing us, openly
[00:53.840 --> 00:59.120]  establishing a worldwide medical ID passport system that will finally end with an implantable
[00:59.120 --> 01:05.880]  microchip under the skin in the words of the United Nations head operative Klaus Schwab,
[01:05.880 --> 01:06.880]  and that's where we are.
[01:06.880 --> 01:11.640]  And they're saying it's a new world order everywhere, and with it is the sexual indoctrination
[01:11.640 --> 01:16.820]  of your children, your parental rights being taken, and your children being sterilized as
[01:16.820 --> 01:21.560]  young as age three in phase one.
[01:21.560 --> 01:27.080]  Phase two, at birth, a helmet will be put over your children, and they will be programmed
[01:27.080 --> 01:42.680]  from birth in a 360 virtual reality into the, quote, new way of thinking with direct neural
[01:42.680 --> 01:47.000]  interaction with the AI evermind.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.640]  They call this direct neural intervention so that the racism and the inherent evilness
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.480]  of your child will be gotten rid of, the left will line up to have his children mounted
[01:58.480 --> 02:03.680]  at birth in the trial programs, turning them into even further autistic zombies.
[02:03.680 --> 02:06.160]  And there's no level the left won't follow.
[02:06.160 --> 02:11.040]  When the left husband or wife dies of the shot, they go take it themselves.
[02:11.040 --> 02:13.840]  They line up to give newborn babies the deadly shot.
[02:13.840 --> 02:17.320]  They want to die, and they want to take us with them.
[02:17.320 --> 02:20.600]  They've been turned over to a great illusion.
[02:20.600 --> 02:24.840]  Well, it's happened in Greece, it's happened in France, it's been announced in the U.K.,
[02:24.840 --> 02:29.640]  it's all the U.N. directed program that you must have an injection to leave your house
[02:29.640 --> 02:31.200]  and go to the grocery store.
[02:31.200 --> 02:36.360]  Of course, they're starting out with football games and concerts to have the big corporations
[02:36.360 --> 02:42.000]  force it on you, and then it'll roll on down to the smaller restaurants and bars, but Johnson's
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.760]  saying you'll be arrested and given multiple years in prison if you don't do it, the exact
[02:45.760 --> 02:47.560]  same things have been announced in France.
[02:47.560 --> 02:50.120]  Remember, we told you a year and a half ago this was coming.
[02:50.120 --> 02:55.800]  It was the official U.N. globalist plan, so like Fauci came out and said, make three-year-olds
[02:55.800 --> 03:00.720]  wear two masks last week, and I said, by next week, the major medical associations will
[03:00.720 --> 03:04.760]  say never take masks off, and they announced it today, they said, never take masks off.
[03:04.760 --> 03:07.840]  This is a cult of psychotic murderous.
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.000]  Fauci ran the whole Wuhan lab, they released the damn virus, the vaccine is worse than
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.520]  the virus, but does what the virus does, it just has your body grow the virus with the
[03:16.520 --> 03:17.520]  spike protein.
[03:17.520 --> 03:22.160]  This is just an apocalypse unfolding, but the public has Stockholm syndrome and can't
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.960]  admit it's happening, and so they rationalize and make excuses about what's going on.
[03:26.960 --> 03:32.040]  That's why it's key for the globalist program that we be taking off air and others be taking
[03:32.040 --> 03:36.200]  off air, and that no medical doctors be able to challenge this as they are, so they can
[03:36.200 --> 03:38.080]  gaslight everyone to death.
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.360]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us on the other side of this break to talk about what it's like
[03:42.360 --> 03:47.040]  to live right in the middle of Air Strip 1, but here's Boris Johnson yesterday celebrating
[03:47.040 --> 03:51.360]  Freedom Day, we're welling in term, and then of course there were tens of thousands, hundreds
[03:51.360 --> 03:56.000]  of thousands out protesting, the police brutally attacked them, we have hours of footage of
[03:56.000 --> 04:01.960]  women being run over with horses, Billy clubbed in the head by the paramilitary satanic forces
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.400]  that are now in control of the UK, God help us, notice Black Lives Matter and criticizing
[04:06.400 --> 04:08.600]  these cops, they love them, here it is.
[04:08.600 --> 04:13.760]  I should certainly just know that by the end of September when all over 18s would have
[04:13.760 --> 04:20.160]  had their chance to be double jabbed, we're planning to make full vaccination the condition
[04:20.160 --> 04:25.480]  of entry to nightclubs and other venues where large crowds gather.
[04:25.480 --> 04:55.320]  The proof of a negative test will no longer be an R.
[04:55.320 --> 04:56.320]  here.
[04:56.320 --> 05:21.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[05:21.320 --> 05:46.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[05:46.320 --> 06:12.320]  We're inside the New World Order.

[51:14.320 --> 51:42.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[51:42.320 --> 52:10.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[52:10.320 --> 52:38.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[52:38.320 --> 53:06.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[53:06.320 --> 53:34.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[53:34.320 --> 54:00.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[54:00.320 --> 54:28.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[54:28.320 --> 54:50.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[54:50.320 --> 55:18.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[55:18.320 --> 55:46.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[55:46.320 --> 56:14.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[56:14.320 --> 56:42.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[56:42.320 --> 56:44.320]  Absolutely.
[57:12.320 --> 57:40.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[57:40.320 --> 58:06.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[58:06.320 --> 58:34.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[58:34.320 --> 58:56.320]  We're inside the New World Order.
[58:56.320 --> 59:05.320]  And now, Washington D.C.'s dirty little secret has been freed by a man of many secrets, Joe Biden. Americans are enemy number one.
[59:05.320 --> 59:16.320]  They weren't protesters. Don't dare call them protesters. They were a riotous mob, insurrectionists, domestic terrorists.
[59:16.320 --> 59:26.320]  The poison of racism has always existed in America, but over the past four years, it seems to have found new life.
[59:26.320 --> 59:38.320]  The FBI's view that top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocate for the superiority of the white race.
[59:38.320 --> 59:51.320]  Those Americans opposing the views of the current administration and its legion of sycophantic power hungry minions will be targeted in the name of misinformation or information that doesn't fit their narrative.
[59:51.320 --> 59:59.320]  For how long has the administration been spying on people's Facebook profiles looking for vaccine misinformation?
[59:59.320 --> 1:00:14.320]  Well, that was quite a loaded and accurate question, which I would refute. This is publicly open information, people sharing information online, just as you are all reporting information on your news stations.
[1:00:14.320 --> 1:00:25.320]  Okay, so these 12 people who you have on a list, 12 individuals, do they know that somebody at the Surgeon General's office is going through their profile?
[1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:35.320]  I'm happy to get you the citation of where that comes from. There's no secret list. I will tell you that these are people who are sharing information on public platforms on Facebook.
[1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:48.320]  Information that is traveling is inaccurate. Our biggest concern here, and I frankly think it should be, your biggest concern is the number of people who are dying around the country because they're getting misinformation that is leading them to not take a vaccine.
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:01:08.320]  In a recent statement from the executive office titled Fact Sheet, National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, President Biden lays out a plan to enhance domestic terrorism analysis and improve information sharing throughout law enforcement at the federal, state, local, tribal and territorial levels.
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:25.320]  Biden's statement goes on to designate the power of the federal government and homeland security to augment its efforts to address online terrorist recruitment and mobilization to violence by domestic terrorists through increased information sharing with the technology sector,
[1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:46.320]  i.e. Silicon Valley, and the creation of innovative ways to foster digital literacy, i.e. censorship, and build resilience to recruitment and mobilization while improving employee screening to enhance methods for identifying domestic terrorists who might pose insider threats,
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:02:04.320]  i.e. the imagined white supremacist boogeyman, while DOD, DOJ and DHS are similarly pursuing efforts to ensure domestic terrorists are not employed within our military or law enforcement ranks and improve screening and vetting processes,
[1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:23.320]  a wild goose chase that will put our national security at severe risk. Overreaching methods used to track down and prosecute an entire family that assumed they were protected by the First Amendment to voice a redress of their grievances after rampant reports of voter fraud and clear intimidation.
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:34.320]  Federal investigators say that they have multiple videos and social media messages that indicate the family traveled from Borger, small town just north of Amarillo, all the way to Washington D.C., according to documents in the court,
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:45.320]  a day after the riot, a Facebook post from the mother says, quote, I was just thinking, tear gas tastes like freedom. All five family members now face multiple federal charges.
[1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:56.320]  From the corruption of a government that has abandoned its oath of office. John Barron reporting.
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:30.320]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away. Listen to this. Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:46.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health. Just one of these ingredients can be a life changing supplement for your health. And we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at infowarstore.com. So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[1:03:46.320 --> 1:04:08.320]  I suggest that you do the same thing and right now it's at an introductory price of $19.95. That's 33% off at infowarstore.com.
[1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:21.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars.com studios. It's Alex Jones.
[1:04:21.320 --> 1:04:32.320]  Well, I just met her five minutes ago and I'll just say this. I don't invite most of my guests out for dinner, but I said, I got to take this lady with my wife out to dinner. She's really interesting.
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:45.320]  I remember seeing her up on TV with Trump, hearing about her story, five years in prison for something wrong with a car's title or something. I mean, you know, they can put anybody they want in jail, wire all these nonviolent people in jail.
[1:04:45.320 --> 1:05:01.320]  Trump said, let nonviolent people out. Angela Stanton King wrote a bestseller, number one national bestseller about her story, and that helped get some of this criminal justice reform through that then President Trump and the Republicans basically got no credit for.
[1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:11.320]  But then she was there on January 6. She's got a new book out caught in the coup. Angela Stanton King, national bestselling author. We're going to talk about that. So we have that shared experience.
[1:05:11.320 --> 1:05:23.320]  Then she ran for Congress in Georgia, saw the fraud for herself with the suitcases being pulled out now confirmed to be premeditated fraud. She was a witness to that. So she's like everywhere all the time.
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:33.320]  I kind of feel like the same way I keep like popping in these crazy things because when you're a man or woman in the arena, that's what happens. And then she's also been massively censored with her millions of online followers.
[1:05:33.320 --> 1:05:46.320]  She had taken away from her Angela Stanton epk.com. It's great to have you here. Oh man. Thanks, Alex. It's a blessing to be here on your show today. Where should we start? Because there's so much to get into.
[1:05:46.320 --> 1:05:51.320]  Oh, wow. There's a lot to get into. Well, you told me a lot in five minutes. Just repeat that to the viewers.
[1:05:51.320 --> 1:06:01.320]  Wow. I'm just going to kind of follow suit. You know, I was fortunate enough to be able to work with Trump and his administration by way of my godmother, Dr. Alveda King.
[1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:05.320]  Oh, I forgot that part. See, there's so much.
[1:06:05.320 --> 1:06:15.320]  Yes. I actually met Alveda when I was released from prison and had nowhere to go. And this is kind of what made my switch from Democrat to Republican because here I am a convicted felon.
[1:06:15.320 --> 1:06:22.320]  I can't get any government assistance. I can't get any help. So I've got no choice but to get up off of my butt and create a lifestyle for myself.
[1:06:22.320 --> 1:06:31.320]  And so I ended up meeting her on that journey. And then here we are years later in a Trump bright house fighting for criminal justice reform and using my story.
[1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:39.320]  I ended up going to prison for title fraud and in that process, I was pregnant and I know a lot of people don't like to get into it, but I'll spill it.
[1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:48.320]  I gave birth to my daughter, chained to a bed. And so not only after that, I was released and had to go through a lot in order to get my life back on track.
[1:06:48.320 --> 1:06:55.320]  So how I got involved was everybody was crying about family separation at the border. And I was saying, hey, wait a minute.
[1:06:55.320 --> 1:07:07.320]  Why is nobody talking about family separation in the border? Because I was an American citizen chained to a bed with a sheriff watching when they snatched my daughter out of my arms and separated our family.
[1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:13.320]  And Trump was not president. It was for nonviolent crime. So I said, wait a minute, these people are full of crap.
[1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:23.320]  Trump said, hey, anybody that's interested in fighting for criminal justice reform, I'm here. I'll listen. I went in and told my story was very, very instrumental in helping to pass the first step act.
[1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:30.320]  And the president also made it illegal for them to chain women to bed during childbirth because of my story.
[1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:33.320]  And he ended the cages down at the border that Obama had, but they still blame him.
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:39.320]  Still blame him for and forgot all about the kids and cages and juvenile detention centers across this nation.
[1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:45.320]  So to me, it seemed like it was just all about jokes, you know, so I ended up getting a full pardon from the president.
[1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:52.320]  After getting a full pardon from the president, I ran for office because I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to use my story.
[1:07:52.320 --> 1:07:59.320]  All the Democrats are always talking about black lives matter and the impact of black life. I said, well, wait a minute, you know, I'm from the hood.
[1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:05.320]  I was born in the hood. Everything that they're talking about, I've been able to overcome. So let me jump in this race.
[1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:11.320]  I ran for John Lewis's seat down there in Fulton County in Georgia's Fifth District. Not only was our president cheated, but I was cheated.
[1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:22.320]  My campaign was completely suppressed. The media was completely biased. They wouldn't even allow me to promote or advertise any of my campaign videos through my social media.
[1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:32.320]  And now nearly one million followers completely deleted Twitter, Instagram, backup Instagram account and Facebook all gone.
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:41.320]  And all that success and all the speeches and all the fame you weren't looking for built that for them and then they just steal it from you. That's theft.
[1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:48.320]  And that's exactly what they do. They try to make it seem as if they've done the work, but they've been floating in the back community like that for a very long time.
[1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:50.320]  And it's time for us to wake up.
[1:08:50.320 --> 1:09:01.320]  Like I said, where to start? The whole point about Martin Luther King, what would he say about critical race theory? To me, that looks like it's 180 degrees, the opposite of what you're.
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:11.320]  I tell you what, the same daughter that I gave birth to change to a bed just won the International Championship for the Harvard Debate Council made history.
[1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:17.320]  This is two days ago. She did that because her mother told her that she could be anything that she wanted to be.
[1:09:17.320 --> 1:09:24.320]  There are no limits. So had I allowed someone to teach my daughter that someone was better than her or that she would never make it.
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:34.320]  Or if I took on that mindset myself, I would have never made it from the prison to the palace or from the hood to all good.
[1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:40.320]  Wow. So what would your your ancestor Martin Luther King, Jr. say today?
[1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:51.320]  I don't think that he would agree at all with what's going on. And this is actually my godmother Alveda King is the niece, but I don't think that he would agree at all with what's going on.
[1:09:51.320 --> 1:09:59.320]  It's not what he stood for. I mean, to me, when I look into some of these policies and I look into what Black Lives Matter stands for, and I know that it's actually against Black life.
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:05.320]  I mean, it's complete agenda is totally against even the creation of Black life.
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:14.320]  These are the same people that are on the front lines of abortion. So how can you say Black Lives Matter and not recognize the fact that Black life begins in the womb?
[1:10:14.320 --> 1:10:16.320]  We have to wake up.
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:23.320]  And then look at Black Lives Matter. I mean, I look at these antifa events, everything. It's all 90% white academics dressed up in black.
[1:10:23.320 --> 1:10:32.320]  And then they're in black neighborhoods trying to stir up a riot so they can literally use black people to burn down the country and then blame black people. I mean, it's pure evil.
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:41.320]  I mean, it reminds me so much of some of the things that were witnessed in the past with the KKK. I mean, why are they not burning down the influential white communities?
[1:10:41.320 --> 1:10:48.320]  They're coming in our communities, burning down the businesses that we own, completely destroying property and saying that they're doing it to save us.
[1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:55.320]  But nobody has come back to rebuild. These communities are still completely destroyed. And I don't see the benefit of it.
[1:10:55.320 --> 1:11:04.320]  Anything that Joe Biden has done since, you know, there are a lot of black Democrats in office and black women like Stacey Abrams that want to take credit for putting Joe Biden in office.
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:16.320]  What has Joe Biden done to enhance black life? The only thing I've seen Joe Biden do is sign the Equality Act, which totally, totally, totally puts our children in harm's way.
[1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:22.320]  Amazing. I could listen to you all day. We still got about 45 minutes left. We're going to break about three minutes.
[1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:28.320]  What order then do you want to go through things? What happened to the Capitol? How you watch them still the election in Georgia, not just crumbs, but your own?
[1:11:28.320 --> 1:11:31.320]  I mean, there's so much to get into.
[1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:36.320]  We probably should start with what happened in the election and then go to January 6th because I think it all led up to that.
[1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:39.320]  Let's do that. Let's do that. Let's start getting into it.
[1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:47.320]  So, again, with the campaign that I ran in Georgia for John Lewis to see, I mean, complete, complete absolute media bias.
[1:11:47.320 --> 1:11:53.320]  The woman that was hand selected in the Kimmel Williams by the Democrat written in refused to debate.
[1:11:53.320 --> 1:11:59.320]  I mean, there were more than 50 attempts to debate with this woman and she would not debate at one time.
[1:11:59.320 --> 1:12:08.320]  Let alone that she somehow managed to get more votes than John Lewis ever got in the history of his career and no one had ever heard of her.
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:14.320]  She's not even an Atlanta native. She's from Alabama. I'm watching the election take place. I'm looking at the counts.
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:18.320]  I'm seeing them stop the vote. They're saying, hey, water mainly now noted and break.
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:28.320]  I show the footage of them grabbing the suitcases up on the same day that they're having the election in the same room that somehow holds the balance.
[1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:32.320]  I said, wait a minute, something here isn't right.
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:38.320]  After that, we saw plenty of video surface with the Ruby Harris and her daughter with a supervisor.
[1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:42.320]  And I guess her assistant, we saw suitcases being pulled out from up under tables.
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:52.320]  We saw ballots being run through twice. Not only that, not only was I a candidate in that race, not only is my name on every ballot that Donald Trump's name is on.
[1:12:52.320 --> 1:12:57.320]  We also witnessed Republicans being locked out of counting centers.
[1:12:57.320 --> 1:13:03.320]  We saw board covering the windows in the windows where they weren't even allowed to see them count.
[1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:10.320]  Somehow there's also videos of ballots being dropped off in the middle of the night.
[1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:12.320]  And we're not supposed to ask questions about that.
[1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:14.320]  Why can't I ask questions?
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:19.320]  Stacey Abrams cried about being cheated by Governor Kemp. She's still crying about it.
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:24.320]  Why can't we ask questions without having our social media accounts suspended in ban?
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:31.320]  Let's talk about that. In fact, guys, reprint me or pull me the new National Terrorism Directive by Biden because I want to show her this.
[1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:33.320]  You're so informed by what I know about it.
[1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:38.320]  Did you know they declared anybody who questions the election fraud of white supremacists?
[1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:44.320]  I'm so white, I don't know what to do. Every time I get in the morning, I see this white skin.
[1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:45.320]  I just don't know what to do.
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:48.320]  And you didn't like your election being stolen to your white supremacists.
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:51.320]  We're going to show that when we come back. This is crazy, but it's happened.
[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:53.320]  Stay with us. They're stealing our whole country right now.
[1:13:53.320 --> 1:13:55.320]  A bunch of foreign banks.
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:05.320]  Your voice counts. When you share information, be it over the Internet or in person, it changes the world.
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:09.320]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry.
[1:14:09.320 --> 1:14:14.320]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got.

[1:14:56.320 --> 1:15:04.320]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[1:15:04.320 --> 1:15:13.320]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power.
[1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:20.320]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.

[1:17:19.320 --> 1:17:34.320]  Angela Stanton King is our guest best-selling author and she helped get prison reform through.
[1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:38.320]  And then she ran for Congress right there in Georgia and saw it stolen.
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:44.320]  Right there, well, Trump got robbed, all that news is coming out and then that leads to the Capitol you were saying and what happened there.
[1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:47.320]  But you hit the break, you were still talking about what happened in Georgia.
[1:17:47.320 --> 1:17:51.320]  What you witnessed now, they have to admit there was fraud where they've done spot checks.
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:55.320]  Oh my gosh, $10,000, $20,000 for Trump. Clearly it was stolen from them.
[1:17:55.320 --> 1:18:01.320]  But then how does it get reinstated when the whole political class doesn't want President Trump back?
[1:18:01.320 --> 1:18:06.320]  You know, I think that there's just a group of powerful people that don't want President Trump.
[1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:12.320]  I think the majority of America wants President Trump back and I say that because I was there to witness.
[1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:18.320]  I've been at several of his rallies, you know, I've written, you know, in private jets with Mike Liddell.
[1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:27.320]  I was with Herman Cain at the rally in Tulsa where they say that he caught COVID and unfortunately, you know, lost his life and I've seen the support that this president has.
[1:18:27.320 --> 1:18:36.320]  And I know that since, you know, Joe Biden has gotten in office, a lot of eyes have been opened, but back to January 6, I was there, Alex, and so were you.
[1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:42.320]  And I never heard the president tell anyone to storm the Capitol.
[1:18:42.320 --> 1:18:49.320]  I've heard the president speak very peacefully and calmly about what his expectations were and how we could support each other.
[1:18:49.320 --> 1:18:58.320]  But you know, I have heard the Democrats tell people to burn things down, get in their faces, right, to make sure you attack them, to run up on them.
[1:18:58.320 --> 1:19:01.320]  We'll burn everything down if we don't get what we want.
[1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:04.320]  Whoever said protest are peaceful. That's Cuomo on CNN.
[1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:08.320]  Hey, listen, they're playing us off for fools.
[1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:16.320]  And now we've got this big whole January 6 interaction, but didn't a couple of the Democrats get locked up for storming the Capitol the other day?
[1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:22.320]  Absolutely. And now they're holding 500 people, most of which didn't even hit anybody in solitary confinement.
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:25.320]  Since when does that happen? They let carjackers out in a week now.
[1:19:25.320 --> 1:19:27.320]  In a week. And let me tell you something.
[1:19:27.320 --> 1:19:34.320]  I was there at on January 6 and I was on my way. I was riding in a golf cart and I had security take me up to the front.
[1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:36.320]  And when I got there, I had a really bad feeling.
[1:19:36.320 --> 1:19:45.320]  I saw some people there that I had never seen at any of the president's rallies before and I knew that they were all about trouble.
[1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:50.320]  I turned around and there's a video of me leaving just because I had a bad feeling.
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:51.320]  I had a horrible feeling too.
[1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:57.320]  It just the energy wasn't right. And I mean, I was at the president's RNC speech as well and also at the National Prayer Breakfast.
[1:19:57.320 --> 1:20:06.320]  But even at the RNC speech that night where we were all attacked by Black Lives Matter, I was on the inside of the White House and it was such a peaceful atmosphere.
[1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:13.320]  The moment we walked outside of the gate, it was almost as if you walked into hell right there.
[1:20:13.320 --> 1:20:15.320]  That was the time Rand Paul got attacked, right?
[1:20:15.320 --> 1:20:21.320]  I was right there and I'm like, these people are attacking Rand Paul.
[1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:30.320]  Brianna Taylor didn't even know he was the one that submitted the law and the proposal, wrote the legislation to end the no knock warrants.
[1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:38.320]  And they're attacking him using her name and it's all because they're strictly driven by racism.
[1:20:38.320 --> 1:20:40.320]  Well, it shows exactly how it's upside down world.
[1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:49.320]  Upside down world. And now we're out here not only fighting against this stereotype that somehow racism is all of a sudden on the rise.
[1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:51.320]  But what's going on with our children?
[1:20:51.320 --> 1:20:55.320]  I think that racism is just a distraction for what's happening with them.
[1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:58.320]  Man, I wish you would have gotten to Congress. I wish they wouldn't have stole it.
[1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:03.320]  How many other amazing folks are you like out there that people are suppressing of every race, color, and creed or humans?
[1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:10.320]  Listen, they're going to make sure they suppress people like me because I'm also the one that was down at the Palace Bar in Miami
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:17.320]  and caught those kids on stage at one o'clock at night in a place where I was made to show my identification
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:22.320]  because adults were in there drinking, smoking, and having strip teases.
[1:21:22.320 --> 1:21:27.320]  And then here are seven and nine year old little girls, shoes too big.
[1:21:27.320 --> 1:21:31.320]  We're going to cover this next segment, but you're one of these people that is so engaged everywhere.
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:35.320]  And I just, everything you keep showing me, you're that lady, you're that lady, you're that lady.
[1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:39.320]  Wow. I keep saying like, what else are you up to?
[1:21:39.320 --> 1:21:41.320]  We've got to fight this fight.
[1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:44.320]  Well, I know you told my producer, I said, what does she want to get into mainly?
[1:21:44.320 --> 1:21:47.320]  She said, well, she's really pissed off about transgender stuff.
[1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:49.320]  So we'll, we'll spend the rest of the interview if you want on that.
[1:21:49.320 --> 1:21:54.320]  We come back, but getting back to the Capitol, watching that a million people showed up.
[1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:57.320]  It was peaceful. Maybe a few thousand got rowdy with the cops.
[1:21:57.320 --> 1:22:01.320]  Maybe 600 went in. They're calling this worse than Pearl Harbor, worse than 9-11.
[1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:02.320]  That is horrible.
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:04.320]  I think that is really horrible that they're doing that.
[1:22:04.320 --> 1:22:09.320]  And I mean, hey, after what we saw Black Lives Matter do, I've watched Black Lives Matter,
[1:22:09.320 --> 1:22:12.320]  literally not only destroy the city of Atlanta, Minneapolis.
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:16.320]  I mean, all throughout the United States to be violent, people have lost their lives,
[1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:20.320]  millions and millions of property damage, downtown buildings, spray painted.
[1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:23.320]  I mean, complete destitute.
[1:22:23.320 --> 1:22:27.320]  I mean, just the whole Wendy's in Atlanta, Georgia, that was burned down and just completely gone
[1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:30.320]  and rioting by there and just thinking about some of the things that have happened and took
[1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:32.320]  in place and nobody has come back to rebuild.
[1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:34.320]  And they're going to say that January 6th was bad.
[1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:36.320]  I just want to say, I really like your energy.
[1:22:36.320 --> 1:22:40.320]  Hey, all I know is the people that were at the Capitol on January 6th weren't the people
[1:22:40.320 --> 1:22:43.320]  coming into the Black communities, burning our communities down.
[1:22:43.320 --> 1:22:45.320]  And that's all I got to say.
[1:22:45.320 --> 1:22:51.320]  If America was in a football game right now, globalist versus American, who really is winning right now?
[1:22:51.320 --> 1:22:54.320]  Because I see them stealing the election, doing all this.
[1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:56.320]  Yeah, they think they're in charge right now.
[1:22:56.320 --> 1:22:58.320]  And I see it backfiring big on them.
[1:22:58.320 --> 1:23:01.320]  It's definitely going to backfire big on them because people are getting fed up.
[1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:02.320]  And guess what?
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:03.320]  Americans are joining forces.
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:06.320]  They're saying, hey, wait a minute, they're sitting right.
[1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:11.320]  Trump was the, you know, the year of 2020 was just that it gave us 2020 vision.
[1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:14.320]  Trump opened our eyes and we're getting ready to fight this thing.
[1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:19.320]  And we're not going out silent and we ain't going out like no pumps either.
[1:23:19.320 --> 1:23:22.320]  Well, I think that's what really panicked the Democrats was the demographics.
[1:23:22.320 --> 1:23:28.320]  You had almost 40% of black males voting for Republicans under Trump, almost a tripling.
[1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:30.320]  You had a double black females vote for him.
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:36.320]  If that continued, and then Trump delivered on the economy and unifying, that'd be game over for the race-pempt Democrats.
[1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:38.320]  Hey, listen, I was right there in Atlanta.
[1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:44.320]  Trump rolled out his $500 billion platinum plan that was specifically for the black community.
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:45.320]  What did we do?
[1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:51.320]  We watched Joe Biden on with Charlemagne and God saying, hey, if you don't vote for me, then you ain't black.
[1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:53.320]  And what did black people do?
[1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:57.320]  Have to prove the color of their skin like he didn't already know it.
[1:23:57.320 --> 1:24:02.320]  I think that we may be missing our own opportunities because we're misled.
[1:24:02.320 --> 1:24:03.320]  Well, it's so condescending.
[1:24:03.320 --> 1:24:10.320]  I mean, if somebody told me you're not a Christian unless you do what I say or you're not, you're not what, I mean, it's like he owns somebody.
[1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:11.320]  Somebody told me you better do this.
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:12.320]  You're not who you are.
[1:24:12.320 --> 1:24:13.320]  I'd say shut the hell up.
[1:24:13.320 --> 1:24:15.320]  I mean, who the hell is this guy?
[1:24:15.320 --> 1:24:16.320]  It's so horrible.
[1:24:16.320 --> 1:24:17.320]  It's so bad.
[1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:18.320]  I mean, I can just see playing this day.
[1:24:18.320 --> 1:24:23.320]  I mean, one car, we could get a meeting with President Trump, get in, discuss issues going on in the black community.
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:29.320]  Right now, you still got Black Lives Matter, Ice Cube, all of these organizations saying, hey, Joe Biden, what about us?
[1:24:29.320 --> 1:24:32.320]  We see that there's been $50 million for the Asian community.
[1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:36.320]  We see that there's been a stop paid against the Asian Americans.
[1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:43.320]  But if you got in off of the people that say Black Lives Matter, where is anything that you're doing before Black Lives Matter?
[1:24:43.320 --> 1:24:44.320]  Well, that was like Obama.
[1:24:44.320 --> 1:24:46.320]  Remember, he wouldn't even go speak at a black group.
[1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:47.320]  Listen.
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:49.320]  Why did he run away from black people?
[1:24:49.320 --> 1:25:00.320]  Not only that, but it took away the funding from our HBCUs and also banned funding for our faith-based HBCUs, which Donald Trump actually put back in place.
[1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:02.320]  So thank you, Mr. Trump, for that.
[1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:09.320]  But why did, because he was even pointed out, you know, by the black community, everybody, Obama ran from the black community.
[1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:15.320]  Listen, Obama was all about transitioning our children, changing their sexes, and aborting our babies.
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:17.320]  And if that's just the bond, it's the God truth.
[1:25:17.320 --> 1:25:20.320]  I mean, we got to stop voting just because of someone's skin color.
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:23.320]  That doesn't mean that that's what's best for you.
[1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:25.320]  And that goes back to what Common Sense is?
[1:25:25.320 --> 1:25:27.320]  Common Sense.
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:28.320]  Wow.
[1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:36.320]  I'm impressed. The new book, and oh, your other was the number one bestseller, but this is Caught in the Coup, Angela Stanton King.
[1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:38.320]  And you can find this in bookstores on your website.
[1:25:38.320 --> 1:25:39.320]  Yep.
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:40.320]  Where's the best place?
[1:25:40.320 --> 1:25:42.320]  You can find it everywhere with AngelaStantonEPK.com.
[1:25:42.320 --> 1:25:43.320]  I'll take you straight to it.
[1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:50.320]  Well, we're going to come back and get into their big move against our children, children of every color, the transgender depopulation agenda.
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:51.320]  Straight ahead.
[1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:54.320]  Stay with us.
[1:25:54.320 --> 1:25:58.320]  As we predicted, the globalists are now launching a new lockdown.
[1:25:58.320 --> 1:26:03.320]  The first one has already destroyed the third world, already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death.
[1:26:03.320 --> 1:26:07.320]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world.
[1:26:07.320 --> 1:26:14.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high quality, storable food that's ready to ship while you still can at 2020 prices.
[1:26:14.320 --> 1:26:18.320]  We have the biggest, best company in the United States as our supplier.
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:26.320]  Their entire catalog is at infowarstore.com, you get an additional 10% off at infowarstore.com, but only for one more week.
[1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:28.320]  They told us you can extend it one more week, Alex.
[1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:29.320]  But that's it.
[1:26:29.320 --> 1:26:31.320]  They won't do this sale again until November.
[1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:34.320]  And then the food prices go up in 2022.
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:36.320]  This is insurance you can eat.
[1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:43.320]  It's the highest quality, hundreds of high quality foods, three months, six months, your supplies, all ready for you at infowarstore.com or call toll free.
[1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:46.320]  Triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:26:46.320 --> 1:26:52.320]  Again, infowarstore.com, 10% off on high quality, storable food, ready to ship, but it ends in just one week.
[1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:54.320]  So take action now while you still can.
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:58.320]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021.
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:00.320]  And I just want to say something.
[1:27:00.320 --> 1:27:05.320]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over the years.
[1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:06.320]  It is truly an answer to prayer.
[1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:10.320]  And I am so blessed and thankful for all of you, the listeners of this show.
[1:27:10.320 --> 1:27:12.320]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you.
[1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:16.320]  Whether you are old, whether you are Hispanic, white, black, it doesn't matter.
[1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:17.320]  You've got red blood.
[1:27:17.320 --> 1:27:23.320]  And if you love freedom and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together.
[1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:27.320]  And it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years.
[1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:31.320]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:34.320]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:39.320]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:27:39.320 --> 1:27:42.320]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:46.320]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've done.
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:50.320]  And just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:53.320]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for the worse.
[1:27:53.320 --> 1:27:54.320]  God bless.
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:27:59.320]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome.
[1:27:59.320 --> 1:28:00.320]  Go ahead.
[1:28:00.320 --> 1:28:01.320]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:02.320]  Good.
[1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:03.320]  Great last call.
[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:06.320]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:12.320]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, moralization and absurdity.
[1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:14.320]  It's like we're living in a twilight zone.
[1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:16.320]  All right, Eric's in New Hampshire.
[1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:17.320]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[1:28:17.320 --> 1:28:18.320]  Go ahead.
[1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:19.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:20.320]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:28:20.320 --> 1:28:22.320]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for one of the products.
[1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:23.320]  The X2Cube does wonders.
[1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:26.320]  They recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:27.320]  Get off the fence.
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:28.320]  Get the product.
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:29.320]  Support the import.
[1:28:29.320 --> 1:28:30.320]  Tyler in Maine.
[1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:31.320]  You're on the year.
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:32.320]  Thanks for holding.
[1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:33.320]  Go ahead.
[1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:34.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:28:34.320 --> 1:28:35.320]  It's great to be on with you.
[1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:41.320]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the products, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:45.320]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps with the bedroom.
[1:28:45.320 --> 1:28:47.320]  So, just number one for a few of you.
[1:28:47.320 --> 1:28:48.320]  It definitely works.
[1:28:48.320 --> 1:28:49.320]  It's not a joke.
[1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:50.320]  Absolutely.
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:29:13.320]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:17.320]  And for the children and the people that support it, are going to realize that this is going
[1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:19.320]  to be the grooming of the next generation.
[1:29:19.320 --> 1:29:24.000]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:25.320]  comfortable just seeing it.
[1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:28.320]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[1:29:28.320 --> 1:29:33.320]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[1:29:33.320 --> 1:29:36.320]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:38.320]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:49.320]  Learn to love, learn to vote, face your fate, they'll convert your children.
[1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:59.320]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate, we're coming for them.
[1:29:59.320 --> 1:30:09.320]  We're coming for them, we're coming for your children, we're coming for them.
[1:30:09.320 --> 1:30:14.320]  Your children will care about fairies and justice for others.
[1:30:14.320 --> 1:30:19.320]  Your children will work to convert all their sisters and brothers.
[1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:22.320]  Then soon they're all alone.
[1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:25.320]  Some of these guys are registered pedophiles turned up.
[1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:40.320]  Your kids will start converting you.
[1:30:40.320 --> 1:30:54.320]  Total cult.
[1:30:54.320 --> 1:30:56.320]  A man tried to talk to your child about sex at the park.
[1:30:56.320 --> 1:30:57.320]  They go to jail.
[1:30:57.320 --> 1:30:59.320]  And now they bring them into the schools.
[1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:01.320]  They set them on their lap.
[1:31:01.320 --> 1:31:27.320]  Come on try a little sky, they'll convert your children.
[1:31:27.320 --> 1:31:34.320]  They'll convert your children and make an ally of you.
[1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:35.320]  We'll get your kids.
[1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:36.320]  We'll corrupt your children.
[1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:39.320]  We'll make an ally of you.
[1:31:39.320 --> 1:31:41.320]  Pedophile agenda.
[1:31:41.320 --> 1:31:44.320]  We'll make an ally of you.
[1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:46.320]  Now you're locked in your house.
[1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:47.320]  You can't follow your current past.
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:48.320]  That's going to rape you with that.
[1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:50.320]  And we have to warn you ladies and gentlemen,
[1:31:50.320 --> 1:31:53.320]  if you've got young or impressionable children in your household,
[1:31:53.320 --> 1:31:55.320]  bring them to the screen right now.
[1:31:55.320 --> 1:32:00.320]  And we witnessed parents taking their children as young as two
[1:32:00.320 --> 1:32:02.320]  inside to take part.
[1:32:02.320 --> 1:32:04.320]  Talking, singing and reading.
[1:32:04.320 --> 1:32:08.320]  We can both be groomed to an audience of preschoolers, toddlers
[1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:09.320]  and their caregivers.
[1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:11.320]  Family programming.
[1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:13.320]  Oh my God.
[1:32:13.320 --> 1:32:16.320]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender
[1:32:16.320 --> 1:32:19.320]  has been reading to children at a Houston public library
[1:32:19.320 --> 1:32:22.320]  as part of its drag queen story hour.
[1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:26.320]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens,
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:31.320]  Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[1:32:31.320 --> 1:32:35.320]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an eight-year-old boy.
[1:32:35.320 --> 1:32:38.320]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[1:32:38.320 --> 1:32:40.320]  People seem to walk away having a good time.
[1:32:40.320 --> 1:32:41.320]  Start them young, right?
[1:32:41.320 --> 1:32:43.320]  Start them young, right?
[1:32:43.320 --> 1:32:46.320]  So all of this is fun about the IMF and World Bank.
[1:32:46.320 --> 1:32:48.320]  Klaus Schwab came out two weeks ago and said,
[1:32:48.320 --> 1:32:52.320]  we need more sexual training for homosexuality with the children.
[1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:54.320]  That's so people don't have children.
[1:32:54.320 --> 1:32:55.320]  So this is depopulation.
[1:32:55.320 --> 1:33:00.320]  Angela Stanton King, you, again, helped get prison reform in this country.
[1:33:00.320 --> 1:33:03.320]  They say you're the catalyst, your book, number one bestseller.
[1:33:03.320 --> 1:33:05.320]  Trump gives it credit for getting that done.
[1:33:05.320 --> 1:33:08.320]  And so, you know, you've got a lot of power.
[1:33:08.320 --> 1:33:10.320]  I mean, you've got some energy.
[1:33:10.320 --> 1:33:11.320]  You're able to get things done.
[1:33:11.320 --> 1:33:14.320]  People that can get things done are the ones who do it over and over again.
[1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:17.320]  And so you were telling us off air that your next big fight is this.
[1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:19.320]  That's where God led you to explain.
[1:33:19.320 --> 1:33:22.320]  You weren't in some bar to see kids dance.
[1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:23.320]  You were on the beach in Miami.
[1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:24.320]  You heard a bunch of music.
[1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:25.320]  You went to see what it was.
[1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:27.320]  We're going to play the video here in a moment.
[1:33:27.320 --> 1:33:32.320]  But now this is your, I mean, just another big fight of the heart you've got going here as a mother.
[1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:34.320]  Tell us what you witnessed.
[1:33:34.320 --> 1:33:38.320]  Well, first of all, when I got to the club, it was already 11.40 at night.
[1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:42.320]  I was asked, stopped at the front to show my ID to make sure that I was old enough to enter.
[1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:44.320]  I go inside after showing my ID.
[1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:46.320]  I sit down with a bunch of other adults.
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:47.320]  Everyone's drinking.
[1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:49.320]  They're all smoking hookah.
[1:33:49.320 --> 1:33:54.320]  We're watching this gentleman that we see on the screen with the blonde hair performed with two other men.
[1:33:54.320 --> 1:33:58.320]  They're having a half naked sex orgy right on stage.
[1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:03.320]  Not only of that, the one with the blonde hair with the two girls was getting dry humped in the mouth.
[1:34:03.320 --> 1:34:08.320]  After that scene was over, he went to the back, come back out and I see the two little girls.
[1:34:08.320 --> 1:34:09.320]  I'm like, hold on, wait a minute.
[1:34:09.320 --> 1:34:15.320]  I'm instantly uncomfortable because now I feel like I'm contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
[1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:25.320]  There is no reason why children should be allowed to be in this type of adult environment where these sexually explicit things are taking place.
[1:34:25.320 --> 1:34:27.320]  So of course I take out my video.
[1:34:27.320 --> 1:34:28.320]  I start recording.
[1:34:28.320 --> 1:34:32.320]  I also call the manager over and tell him how inappropriate it is.
[1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:39.320]  Next thing I know, they run an article on the news saying that, hey, I'm responsible for all of the death threats that their club is getting.
[1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:42.320]  And all I'm doing is attacking their establishment.
[1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:47.320]  What I'm saying is you can't take a child into a female strip club.
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:49.320]  You can't take them into Magic City or Atlanta.
[1:34:49.320 --> 1:34:57.320]  So why is it okay to see men have naked stripping for money and allowing children to share that same state?
[1:34:57.320 --> 1:34:59.320]  And men yelling sexual things at the children.
[1:34:59.320 --> 1:35:01.320]  We've had to believe it, but it's caught on your audio.
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:03.320]  They're going, yeah, I want to ask you.
[1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:04.320]  I mean, this is sick.
[1:35:04.320 --> 1:35:05.320]  It is sick.
[1:35:05.320 --> 1:35:07.320]  And I want to be clear on something.
[1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:14.320]  I want to say, first of all, the reason why I have this passion in me is because I was a victim of sexual abuse at a very young age by a family member.
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:18.320]  Not only that, I am also the mother of an adult trans son.
[1:35:18.320 --> 1:35:22.320]  So I want to be clear when we start talking about this transgender movement.
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:30.320]  And many of you may have seen me on Dr. Phil because me and Dr. Phil had a big falling out because he tried to convince me that I had given birth to a female.
[1:35:30.320 --> 1:35:31.320]  This is my thing.
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:36.320]  When we are dealing with children and as an adult, if you want to make a decision to say, hey, this is how I want to live my life.
[1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:38.320]  That's one thing.
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:39.320]  100% agree.
[1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:40.320]  Leave the children alone.
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:42.320]  And that is where we're at.
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:45.320]  We're talking about this attack that are on the minds of our children.
[1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:55.320]  And the reason why this is so important to me is because I know someone had made my son believe somewhere along the lines that he could be a woman transitioning.
[1:35:55.320 --> 1:35:59.320]  And that's where this is going without even telling parents all over the world.
[1:35:59.320 --> 1:36:02.320]  Big corporations are funding this to go confuse children.
[1:36:02.320 --> 1:36:09.320]  Now they're saying half of autistic boys worldwide are now becoming transgender because they can make them fixate and brainwash them.
[1:36:09.320 --> 1:36:11.320]  Not only that, let's talk about what this really means.
[1:36:11.320 --> 1:36:19.320]  I mean, I remember a few years ago seeing a big movement in the community where everybody was talking about, let's stop the genital mutilation of young girls over in Africa.
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:22.320]  Transgenderism is genital mutilation.
[1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.320]  It's dismemberment, right?
[1:36:24.320 --> 1:36:26.320]  They first do it with chemicals and then they physically cut it off.
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:27.320]  Exactly.
[1:36:27.320 --> 1:36:29.320]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:32.320]  And I mean, if you cut it off, I mean, how is it going to work?
[1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:35.320]  This all leads down to, just like you said, depopulation.
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:39.320]  They even have girls having their breasts removed because they think they're a boy.
[1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.320]  This is training a woman, a little girl to cut her breast off.
[1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:47.320]  I mean, if you cut your hand off 50 years ago, they put you in a mental institution.
[1:36:47.320 --> 1:36:49.320]  If you cut your penis off, they put you in a mental institution.
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:51.320]  Now they tell you you're great.
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:52.320]  This is so serious.
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:56.320]  This is such an attack on life because how are you going to feed your baby?
[1:36:56.320 --> 1:36:59.320]  Your breasts are there for a reason.
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:01.320]  Well, it's a satanic ritual.
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:02.320]  It absolutely is.
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:04.320]  So is the child's sacrifice.
[1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:05.320]  So, hey, we can get into that.
[1:37:05.320 --> 1:37:06.320]  Abortion.
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:07.320]  No, hit them.
[1:37:07.320 --> 1:37:08.320]  Tell them the truth.
[1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:09.320]  Listen, let me tell you something.
[1:37:09.320 --> 1:37:13.320]  Planned Parenthood is a racist organization brought and grounded in eugenics.
[1:37:13.320 --> 1:37:14.320]  They've...
[1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:15.320]  Hey, I'll tell you what.
[1:37:15.320 --> 1:37:19.320]  My doctor, who I haven't seen in a year, I was supposed to have an appointment.
[1:37:19.320 --> 1:37:20.320]  I missed my appointment.
[1:37:20.320 --> 1:37:22.320]  So they said, I only got one at two o'clock.
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:23.320]  I got to go to it today.
[1:37:23.320 --> 1:37:27.320]  How would you like to take a break in about 30 minutes, but come back and host 30 months
[1:37:27.320 --> 1:37:28.320]  of show?
[1:37:28.320 --> 1:37:29.320]  Hey, we can do that one.
[1:37:29.320 --> 1:37:30.320]  All right.
[1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:31.320]  Owen's great, but Owen's okay.
[1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:32.320]  Owen's not going to do it.
[1:37:32.320 --> 1:37:33.320]  He's great.
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:34.320]  He's got his 3 p.m. show.
[1:37:34.320 --> 1:37:35.320]  Well, tell Owen he can...
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:36.320]  He can relax at 3...
[1:37:36.320 --> 1:37:37.320]  At 1.30.
[1:37:37.320 --> 1:37:40.320]  He's going to come in here and she's going to host the last 30 minutes of my show before
[1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:42.320]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:44.320]  But we still got a segment and a half left.
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:45.320]  Okay.
[1:37:45.320 --> 1:37:46.320]  I keep telling them what's going on.
[1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:49.320]  Oh, back to this transgender agenda that we're talking about.
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:54.320]  This is in a direct attack on life and even with Planned Parenthood, this is a admitted
[1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:56.320]  racist organization, right?
[1:37:56.320 --> 1:37:59.320]  Where they specifically targeted the black community.
[1:37:59.320 --> 1:38:05.320]  The 75%, over 75% of their abortion clinics are in black communities.
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:07.320]  They're telling us abortion is healthcare.
[1:38:07.320 --> 1:38:13.320]  Not only that, on October 31st of 2017, Planned Parenthood put up a tweet.
[1:38:13.320 --> 1:38:20.320]  It said that black women in America are statistically safer aborting their children than they are
[1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:21.320]  giving birth.
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:24.320]  We should be offended, but you don't see that.
[1:38:24.320 --> 1:38:29.320]  You see people like Stacey Abrams and Tamika Mallory, the people that are at the head of
[1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:34.320]  these movements saying black lives matter, but also telling our women that abortion is
[1:38:34.320 --> 1:38:35.320]  healthcare.
[1:38:35.320 --> 1:38:39.320]  Listen, 46% of the black population has already been aborted.
[1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:41.320]  Let's talk about these agendas.
[1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:47.320]  abortion, transgenderism, mass incarceration, maybe even a shot.
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:51.320]  All of these things seem to be in attack on black life, but we keep voting for the people
[1:38:51.320 --> 1:38:53.320]  that are actually against us.
[1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:54.320]  We'll be right back.
[1:38:54.320 --> 1:38:59.320]  Michael Lindell is a man in the arena, a man after Teddy Roosevelt's own heart.
[1:38:59.320 --> 1:39:03.320]  People demonize him, they laugh at him, they attack him, but he's been proven right.
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:08.320]  The audits are coming out and there was total absolute election fraud against President Trump
[1:39:08.320 --> 1:39:11.320]  and against the American people.
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:12.320]  That is the bottom line.
[1:39:12.320 --> 1:39:16.320]  And Michael Lindell is getting sued by all these big, powerful, globalist institutions
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:18.320]  trying to shut him down.
[1:39:18.320 --> 1:39:23.320]  That's why it's so important to support my fellow.com and all the great products he's
[1:39:23.320 --> 1:39:28.320]  got and all the thousands of employees he has hired in America because he's doing God's

[1:39:29.320 --> 1:39:31.320]  And at the same time, he's funding info wars.
[1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:32.320]  That's right.
[1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:39.320]  The globalist are having their revolution, but for humanity has to have its revolution.

[1:40:01.200 --> 1:40:03.900]  We have to first recognize this anti-human
[1:40:04.920 --> 1:40:06.920]  takeovers trying to
[1:40:06.920 --> 1:40:13.800]  enslave the entire biological processes of humans and turn us into these artificial corporate
[1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:16.720]  controlled
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:18.720]  slaves
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:22.520]  Orson slaves and just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:25.480]  Rendered down to be servile
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:28.500]  minions of the system and a ritual of
[1:40:29.120 --> 1:40:34.200]  Dominance and satanic control. We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world
[1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:40.360]  Which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia
[1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:44.480]  It's that choice. It's that realization. It's gonna change the world and
[1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:48.880]  It's the only choice. We've got freedom or slavery go to evil
[1:40:49.400 --> 1:40:52.880]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:59.340]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water soil and

[1:42:53.600 --> 1:43:09.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:43.000]  Angela Stanton King is our guest and she is an impressive lady my text messages are filling up from friends and family
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:44.960]  And they don't really do that for all that was a great interview
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:51.680]  But I mean I just feel good truthful energy from you and we've had a lot of the same experiences and you help get major reform done
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:55.200]  And your own son I basically you're saying you know, you love him
[1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:01.840]  You're not attacking him but had this put in his mind as the thing to do and now it's everywhere. They're bombarding our children
[1:44:02.280 --> 1:44:07.600]  With it and so so you've got the floor here and you're gonna come back in the last 30 minutes the next hour
[1:44:07.600 --> 1:44:09.600]  You're gonna host the show today as well
[1:44:10.240 --> 1:44:16.440]  Head of Paul Watson about how serious this is and where this is going and what you think we should do man
[1:44:16.440 --> 1:44:21.400]  I with something has to be done and for one we need to get us some real freedom fighters and
[1:44:21.680 --> 1:44:26.600]  Congress and I don't think that that's gonna happen for us until of course we can clean up what's going on with these
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:29.480]  Dominion machines and get this election fraud cleaned up
[1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:35.080]  But I think honestly I mean with all the work that I've been able to do for this administration and with this
[1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:41.840]  Administration and the things that my eyes have been open up to I never really thought that any of this was about racism or COVID
[1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:49.160]  I've always thought that this was a cover-up for human trafficking and pedophilia and it seems as the days play out that these things are becoming
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:53.040]  More and more relevant as we go along here
[1:44:53.040 --> 1:44:57.840]  And not only with the agenda that I see by the media pushed on me and how I was attacked
[1:44:58.560 --> 1:45:04.320]  Basically a being accused of misgendering my own son. I've got the birth certificate. I filled it out
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:06.320]  I know what the doctors told me I know
[1:45:06.320 --> 1:45:13.040]  Who and what I've raised and I think that this spirit of confusion that they are forcing on our children is wrong
[1:45:13.040 --> 1:45:16.960]  And we have to have some strong people that are willing to stand up against it
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:21.520]  It's gotten so bad that even at we spa not too long ago
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:27.160]  Ladies were in a jacuzzi. They were on their side of the spa a man comes in says hey
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:32.080]  Identify as a white guy with a big beard to big penis listen and and two big balls
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:36.920]  Okay gets inside of the jacuzzi tub not only with adult women
[1:45:36.920 --> 1:45:41.160]  But a nine-year-old child and a 14-year-old child as well all of these women get up
[1:45:41.160 --> 1:45:46.160]  They run to the front. They say hey, we're demanding our money back. What about our rights and they're saying by law
[1:45:46.160 --> 1:45:51.640]  We can't do anything. We can't discriminate against gender identity. Well, wait a minute. Okay?
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:57.400]  If you identify as a woman, why do you still have man parts? Where is the common sense?
[1:45:57.400 --> 1:46:04.720]  There used to be a thing caught in decent exposure, right? Well, you just couldn't expose yourself in front of a group of people
[1:46:05.080 --> 1:46:11.440]  The laws that have been passed since this new administration has been in office put our children in harm's way
[1:46:11.440 --> 1:46:15.000]  I sat and watched Keisha Bottoms sign an executive order
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:22.560]  Allowing men to go into women's bathroom, and I'm thinking to myself. Hey, wait a minute. I've raised a daughter in the house with three boys
[1:46:22.560 --> 1:46:28.280]  Never once had they ever had to be in the bathroom together never have my sons ever
[1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:35.080]  Exposed themselves to my daughter, but now she goes to school or she goes to the airport or she goes to a restaurant
[1:46:35.160 --> 1:46:40.560]  She has to be exposed to exactly my own daughters never sat there and saw me do that
[1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:45.160]  And I always left them when they were getting dressed after they were about three the I mean the idea of this is sick
[1:46:45.160 --> 1:46:49.280]  And it's like oh, we're the ones to corrupt your children. We're the ones that are gonna teach them
[1:46:49.280 --> 1:46:56.360]  This is this is out of control and by the way look at this evil Ontario woman charged after allegedly sexually assaulting a boy
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:46:58.520]  They said this little boy got raped in a park
[1:46:58.520 --> 1:47:02.800]  It's a big old gross man, and they say a woman did it that'd be like
[1:47:03.840 --> 1:47:10.480]  Again, I mean this is just so ridiculous to say that's a woman and now they're letting men take over all the sports track
[1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:19.080]  Weightlifting everything from the women what a cult what a sick cult a bunch of pedophiles are literally taking over women's spaces
[1:47:19.080 --> 1:47:21.120]  And this is what I want to say like to me
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:26.800]  I had to really sit down because I went back to school and I got my bachelor's degree in psychology because I wanted to understand
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:32.800]  My son's experience and what I learned was that when it comes to LBGTQ and all of those letters
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:39.160]  All of those letters represent a sexuality. When did we begin to tie children with sex?
[1:47:39.160 --> 1:47:42.000]  So if you think about the L well that goes back to Margaret Senor
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:46.600]  They said make it all about the health department and your gender and then we control you to sterilize you
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:52.040]  And so isn't that doesn't it seem like all of this stuff is tied together somehow the black lives matter movement?
[1:47:52.040 --> 1:47:53.480]  We find out that this is a farce
[1:47:53.480 --> 1:48:02.160]  This is actually about a queer affirming network that wants to totally disrupt right the Western prescribed nuclear family that was stated on their own
[1:48:02.160 --> 1:48:11.800]  This is a biological transhumanist revolution. That's exactly what it is because the founder of black lives matter is married to a white trans man
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:14.600]  Black America you need to wake up
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:23.240]  What it is is a revolution because if you take over people's biology you've conquered them just like Monsanto said in a court case 20 something years ago
[1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:29.520]  In the South Africa they were getting sued over this GMO product they had that the farmers couldn't make seeds that grew out of it
[1:48:29.520 --> 1:48:34.360]  And they said listen our real goals to have humans like this where where we've got to be made in test tubes
[1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:39.600]  I mean they want to end men and women coming together and that power of families period because that's everything
[1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:42.720]  Hey, not only is it revolutionary this thing is also spiritual
[1:48:42.720 --> 1:48:45.960]  Okay, because if you're confused and don't know who you are
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:50.600]  It's very important that you know your identity if you're confused and don't know who you are
[1:48:50.760 --> 1:48:57.200]  Then you can believe that you're anyone if you don't have a name and I say a you'll respond if I say be your respond
[1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:04.160]  We need to make sure that our children know who they are and that we are not supporting agendas that end our lifelines
[1:49:04.160 --> 1:49:11.040]  What about your butt line? Are you voting now? Oh, absolutely. And that's how you conquer people is ending their bloodline. You just cut right to the chase
[1:49:12.280 --> 1:49:14.280]  That's exactly what's happening here
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:19.920]  And what about everybody getting on board thinking? Oh, this is like this is like not being racist
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:24.480]  Oh now now we're not having a gender. They've just signed on to the most scientific evil ever
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:29.000]  Ever and this ends life. It doesn't create life and with the black
[1:49:29.800 --> 1:49:33.160]  Population already being so low. We're we're only 13% of the population
[1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:38.520]  Joe Biden said it. He had a viral interview that it was an interview that went viral
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:41.920]  We was talking to black community leaders and he said hey America is doomed
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:45.960]  He said not just because of African Americans, but because of by
[1:49:46.440 --> 1:49:49.520]  2040 then white people will be the minority
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:54.640]  He said so you all better learn how to get along with the Latinas because it's more of them than you
[1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:57.000]  This was his exact quote Joe Biden
[1:49:57.720 --> 1:50:04.800]  If our numbers are so low and we're already outnumbered and why are you allowing millions and millions of illegal immigrants?
[1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:10.200]  Flowing to the border and telling us that we need to abort our children in order for their children to live and again
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:15.440]  It's nothing against Hispanics. They're making us all in groups. Well, we say we're all gonna fight it out exactly
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:21.520]  Well, hey, this is the thing it and I'm a former felon, right? Thank you president Trump for giving me a full part
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:25.760]  But if we know the difference between an American citizen and an American criminal the damage
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:29.400]  You need to know the difference between a legal immigrant and an illegal. No, I totally agree
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:32.440]  But all I'm saying is they want to play us all up against each other. Absolutely, right
[1:50:32.440 --> 1:50:38.200]  That's here senator Dick Durbin will play the club white people are being demographically replaced GOP is doomed
[1:50:38.360 --> 1:50:42.960]  So the GOP is the party that ended slavery the GOP is the party that passes some rights movement
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:49.640]  The GOP is the party that will Chamberlain and Martin Luther King were in but then they brainwash everybody to follow the
[1:50:49.880 --> 1:50:54.280]  KKK Democrat and now here they are again the Robert Byrd senators
[1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:56.880]  KKK grand Cyclops
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:51:02.120]  Literally saying hey minorities you better be with us. We're gonna get the white people
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:07.840]  Which is they're gonna make white people become racists and get in a racial group the way you control a prison is putting people in racial groups
[1:51:07.840 --> 1:51:13.320]  They're turning us into a prison planet. I'll tell you what the GOP supported me
[1:51:13.320 --> 1:51:16.120]  Not only did they support me they supported my campaign while
[1:51:16.320 --> 1:51:22.180]  Democrats were telling people that I was a racist and that I was a white supremacist and my message was that I wanted
[1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:27.360]  Black Americans to give life to their children. I wanted us to make sure that our men become men
[1:51:27.360 --> 1:51:31.640]  Yes, and the white supremacist doesn't want to kill doesn't want to kill black people and wants men to be men
[1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:36.000]  I'll dare you you're so evil. Absolutely. So here's dick Durbin race pimp globalist
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:40.280]  Here he is saying again, we're gonna get rid of the white people. This is a good thing
[1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:46.040]  Which again is gonna make white people then see black people's the enemy when it's these people manipulating us against each other here
[1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:47.440]  It is
[1:51:47.440 --> 1:51:54.240]  in response to the minority leaders statement about the changes in voting laws across America
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  The record speaks for itself. I
[1:51:57.840 --> 1:51:59.840]  believe the number is 17
[1:52:00.360 --> 1:52:02.000]  17 states
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:06.880]  Controlled by the Republicans in the legislature, which you've set out to specifically
[1:52:07.480 --> 1:52:11.160]  limit previous opportunities under law to vote
[1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:19.760]  Coincidence that 17 states would do these things. I don't think so. I think it's by design
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:27.160]  And that's why the Senate Rules Committee was in charge of today to talk specifically about the measures that they
[1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:32.880]  Are let's stop right there. This is a longer clip. I guess I've mentioned I want to cut this down to just him saying that
[1:52:32.880 --> 1:52:36.520]  So let's try to do that right now and to come back the next segment and play that but again
[1:52:36.520 --> 1:52:41.520]  All the facts are record numbers of quote minorities are voting Republican. That's why the Democrats are so panicked
[1:52:41.520 --> 1:52:46.000]  I'm gonna give you a chance to respond that will give you a 20-minute break after that and then you're gonna come back
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:50.200]  And you're gonna host and then I'm gonna come back today after my doctor's appointment had that one a year and then
[1:52:50.360 --> 1:52:51.400]  Cancel one in the morning
[1:52:51.400 --> 1:52:54.320]  So they gave me this one at two o'clock and I gotta go get my you know
[1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:57.440]  You really check up and all that blood drawn all that fun stuff, but I'll be back
[1:52:58.600 --> 1:53:03.400]  Sometime once the war room starts because there's a lot to cover and I've got some huge news separately
[1:53:03.400 --> 1:53:06.200]  I barely plug today. We won't be here on there unless you support us
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:13.840]  We've got new save the frogs in full wars calm coffee mugs for 995 get a second one for 495
[1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:18.640]  And these mugs cost us like four bucks to make so we gotta saw a lot of those to fund this operation
[1:53:18.640 --> 1:53:23.280]  We also have x2 deep earth crystal iodine in the spray bottle
[1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:27.240]  Uh, the sale ends today as it's about to sell out it will sell up at the end of the day
[1:53:27.520 --> 1:53:32.040]  It's 60% off and we have the dropper bottle same iodine so good for your body the missing link
[1:53:32.040 --> 1:53:37.800]  I talked about for for manliness or feminists. They hit us with fluoride. That's the opposite of the iodine
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:41.280]  We've got it for 40% off as well. That's how it's gonna end soon. It's selling up
[1:53:43.680 --> 1:53:47.200]  As we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown

[1:55:47.960 --> 1:55:50.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:56:07.280]  There's a man going round taking names and he decides who to free and who to blame
[1:56:09.720 --> 1:56:12.480]  Everybody won't be treated all the same
[1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:23.960]  All right, here's Dick Durbin saying all politics is racial and Republicans are white supremacists basically and so they're gonna be out of power
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:29.320]  Cuz they're only for white people imagine announcing. He's this party can't be for anybody, but white people
[1:56:29.320 --> 1:56:34.560]  I mean the Republicans have to call this out the Democrats are nasty little monsters. Here he is
[1:56:35.480 --> 1:56:39.320]  and yet the Republicans went in control of state legislatures are
[1:56:39.320 --> 1:56:43.840]  Or by design trying to make it more difficult for some people to vote. Why?
[1:56:44.800 --> 1:56:46.800]  The answer is very simple
[1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:50.920]  The demographics of America are not on the side of the Republican Party
[1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:56.920]  The new voters in this country are moving away from them away from Donald Trump
[1:56:57.480 --> 1:57:00.920]  away from their party creed that they preach
[1:57:02.520 --> 1:57:07.000]  Instead they're moving to be independents or it even vote on the other side
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:17.160]  To argue and fight against that the Republicans in legislative settings are reducing and restricting the opportunity to vote
[1:57:17.800 --> 1:57:19.800]  That's what it's all about
[1:57:19.920 --> 1:57:21.920]  The senator from Kentucky
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:28.960]  Attributes it to hysteria. It is not it is a genuine concern over whether in this country
[1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:32.480]  where democracy is our creed and our
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:38.620]  Our goal in every election we have the most participation fair participation
[1:57:39.240 --> 1:57:43.480]  By eligible voters that we've ever had and we continue to build on that
[1:57:44.600 --> 1:57:50.640]  So he's saying demographically Republicans are doomed but the numbers showed with Trump record numbers of minorities voting for him
[1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:55.720]  So that's not true. What do you make of this? I think this whole thing about this voting build is just a bunch of crap
[1:57:55.720 --> 1:57:59.840]  I mean they're saying hey black people aren't gonna be able to vote because they don't have ID
[1:57:59.840 --> 1:58:02.840]  Um, excuse me. We have ID when we go to the liquor store
[1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:06.040]  We have ID when we're in line at the club on the weekends
[1:58:06.040 --> 1:58:09.320]  We also have ID when they asked us to show our ID
[1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:15.840]  We're making a purchase with our debit cards the fact that some of these people are saying that we don't know how to get on the internet
[1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:17.840]  We don't know how to fill out an application
[1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:23.320]  We don't know how to fill out an absentee vote because no one said that you can't feel vote
[1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:27.960]  If there's an issue with you standing in line all they're saying is show your ID
[1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:29.960]  This is about election
[1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:35.800]  Integrity every citizen in America should be required to show identification
[1:58:36.320 --> 1:58:41.000]  We want to know who these people are in case there's some sort of a crime when I look at this man
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:58:46.800]  You know what I see I see somebody that's lying straight to their straight through their teeth because I'm listening to him
[1:58:46.800 --> 1:58:52.960]  I thought that he's also the same man that would not only vote for my children to be aborted
[1:58:52.960 --> 1:58:57.480]  He would also vote to pay for it. You're not my friend. You're an enemy
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:59:03.720]  You want to find illegals coming across the border, but give us a message that we need to transition and abort our children
[1:59:03.720 --> 1:59:07.700]  The devil is a lie and the Democrats are too. Wow, beautifully said
[1:59:07.700 --> 1:59:13.600]  I mean they literally say like if aliens landed and say do not have any more children and cut your men's testicles off
[1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:18.760]  You like what you're here to exterminate us. They're like, I love you. I love you and all the corporate
[1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:22.560]  You notice all the corporate pitchmen are black people now. That's not to help black people
[1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:25.040]  It's the globalists hiding themselves behind the black face
[1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:31.720]  That's exactly what it is and this all points to one thing again. Like we said, this is a depopulation agenda
[1:59:32.160 --> 1:59:35.760]  And there's some people behind it and they don't have your best interest at heart
[1:59:35.800 --> 1:59:40.200]  One thing that we have to do is begin to vote for policy and not people
[1:59:40.200 --> 1:59:42.840]  They want to try to paint Donald Trump as the bad guy
[1:59:42.840 --> 1:59:45.920]  They want to paint him as the face of the Republican Party
[1:59:45.920 --> 1:59:50.680]  No, Donald Trump is a face of those people that want to be free that don't want to be censored
[1:59:50.680 --> 1:59:57.720]  They want to have the right to practice their faith their religion and also the people that have enough sense to know the difference between a
[1:59:57.960 --> 1:59:59.960]  man and a woman
[2:00:00.680 --> 2:00:03.600]  Beautifully said, I'm gonna come back and cover a bunch of news
[2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:04.360]  I haven't hit yet
[2:00:04.360 --> 2:00:06.000]  You're gonna get about a 20-minute
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:12.520]  25-minute break and then you're gonna host two segments and I really appreciate you doing that and then of course then Paul Watson will host the
[2:00:13.160 --> 2:00:17.440]  Fourth hour the lot with the announcement of the COVID martial law over there
[2:00:17.440 --> 2:00:23.640]  And then of course, I want you to 3 p.m. Central with the war room very very impressed the website is
[2:00:24.360 --> 2:00:30.960]  Angela stanton epk.com and she's got her new book out in 20 seconds. What are you gonna cover in the last half hour?
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:35.160]  Oh, we're gonna talk some more about this equality act that was signed by Joe Biden
[2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:36.960]  We're gonna get a little bit into
[2:00:36.960 --> 2:00:37.840]  Trump's
[2:00:37.840 --> 2:00:45.720]  Censorship lawsuit that he put up against big tech and we're gonna get into what we can do right while we're in this battle to protect our children
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:50.320]  Against this satanic agenda a born talk show host my goodness. We'll be back
[2:00:56.240 --> 2:01:01.160]  Jacob in Ohio welcome go ahead. Hey, how's it going? Alex the great last caller?
[2:01:01.160 --> 2:01:04.080]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplements
[2:01:04.080 --> 2:01:08.000]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:14.160]  Moralization and absurdity. It's like we're living at a twilight zone and all right Eric's in New Hampshire Eric
[2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:18.800]  Thanks for calling. Go ahead. Hey, Alex. Thanks for taking my call if I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for the
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:23.760]  One of the product the XQ does wonders that recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it
[2:01:23.760 --> 2:01:29.440]  Get off the fence get the product support the info or Tyler in Maine. You're on the year. Thanks for rolling. Go ahead
[2:01:29.440 --> 2:01:33.200]  Hey, Alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor honor talk to you awesome
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:40.840]  So personally, I wanted to do was say I love the products alpha power even at 29 if you asked my better half
[2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:44.520]  She loves it and it helps in the bedroom. So just number one
[2:01:44.520 --> 2:02:02.720]  Only works, it's not a joke. He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side
[2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:15.200]  You're listening to Alex Jones
[2:02:23.200 --> 2:02:27.520]  The Alex Jones show there is a war on for your mind
[2:02:27.520 --> 2:02:35.040]  I mean, I'm not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful and I hope that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:38.200]  Because I've had chills
[2:02:38.200 --> 2:02:40.200]  since last night
[2:02:40.360 --> 2:02:43.720]  This just confirms everything else. We've already researched a
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:49.720]  Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by elite
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:54.360]  Millions being killed mandatory quarantines checkpoints the end of the family
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:03:03.000]  Everything that's in the other documents, but this dovetails of all the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize you and force vaccines and
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:09.320]  The hell we're already living in this is going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these eugenics madmen
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:11.320]  But that story is up on prisonplanet.com
[2:03:11.840 --> 2:03:18.720]  The question is will you have the courage to really do the research yourself because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims
[2:03:18.720 --> 2:03:27.560]  These people are so arrogant that they write policy papers so many of them that they're producing these policy papers and reports and white papers
[2:03:27.800 --> 2:03:34.440]  So fast that you could never read them all it is an open conspiracy against you and your family
[2:03:34.440 --> 2:03:35.560]  I pray to God
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:42.080]  I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength and the will to be able to face this fire and
[2:03:42.320 --> 2:03:46.040]  To give me the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:52.160]  Don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos or on message boards, and I'm a liar. I
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:55.800]  Know why because it's scary
[2:03:59.920 --> 2:04:02.200]  You're not gonna be able to go to the ball games anymore
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:07.960]  You're not gonna be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends you're not gonna be able to just
[2:04:09.120 --> 2:04:11.440]  You know go out and enjoy yourself all the time
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:16.200]  The only chance we've got of beating this scientific dictatorship
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:22.360]  This creeping death that takes its time to incrementally enslave you
[2:04:23.320 --> 2:04:25.800]  mentally psychologically physically spiritually
[2:04:26.200 --> 2:04:32.440]  The only way to defeat it is for the rank and file of this planet to realize that
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:35.880]  You have a choice to make on what your destiny is gonna be
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:42.560]  Once you face this information once you've consciously admitted it to yourself, it will take over your life
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:47.440]  It should take over your life. I mean what else what else could it do?
[2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:57.000]  We've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open
[2:04:58.240 --> 2:05:00.240]  unveiling of planetary dictatorship
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:05.120]  They all talk about how we need a police state to carry this out
[2:05:05.120 --> 2:05:10.520]  Canada and the United States are gonna work in lockstep display the seriousness of our commitment
[2:05:11.000 --> 2:05:16.160]  At both home and abroad when loser draw you need to choose a sign
[2:05:17.880 --> 2:05:20.760]  If the wars tomorrow's news today
[2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:26.760]  The globalists have said in their white papers in their own UN documents that they want to create
[2:05:26.760 --> 2:05:34.280]  a race-specific bio weapons and other systems to depopulate the planet a lot of this from my sources is that they're preparing to release
[2:05:35.040 --> 2:05:37.040]  Bio weapons claim that they're naturally
[2:05:37.720 --> 2:05:41.440]  Occurring and then use that as the cover for civil emergency
[2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:43.520]  societal control
[2:05:43.520 --> 2:05:47.680]  Crackdowns on free speech Obama put the internet kill switch in five years ago
[2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:53.360]  And when he got confronted by it by Congress, he said well, it's in case the bird flu or stars gets out
[2:05:53.360 --> 2:05:59.560]  Just type that in CDC says internet kill switch is in case bird flu or stars breaks out
[2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:05.240]  And they have to control panic and direct every website in the US to one government announcement
[2:06:05.240 --> 2:06:12.640]  And we looked at every angle and believe a bio weapon release could be the thing they'd released to bring in a world government to counter a
[2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:21.240]  Global problem and the UN has said that a global pandemic is the only thing that may save their world government if a wars tomorrow's news today
[2:06:21.240 --> 2:06:23.000]  Dr. Fauci
[2:06:23.000 --> 2:06:29.160]  We don't know whether the pandemic started in a lab in Wuhan or evolved naturally, but we should want to know
[2:06:29.600 --> 2:06:34.520]  Three million people have died from this pandemic and that should cause us to explore all possibilities
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:42.040]  Instead government authorities self-interested in continuing gain of function research say there's nothing to see here
[2:06:42.640 --> 2:06:49.120]  Gain of function research as you know is juicing up naturally occurring animal viruses to infect humans
[2:06:49.120 --> 2:06:54.440]  To arrive at the truth the US government should admit that the Wuhan virology Institute
[2:06:54.960 --> 2:06:59.200]  Was experimenting to enhance the coronavirus's ability to infect humans
[2:06:59.920 --> 2:07:02.440]  Juicing up super viruses is not new
[2:07:03.160 --> 2:07:08.480]  Scientists in the US have long known how to mutate animal viruses to infect humans for years
[2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:13.840]  Dr. Ralph Barrick a virologist in the US has been collaborating with dr
[2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:20.640]  She's Engley of the Wuhan virology Institute sharing his discoveries about how to create super viruses
[2:07:20.760 --> 2:07:24.680]  This gain of function research has been funded by the NIH
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:30.560]  The collaboration between the US and the Wuhan virology Institute continues
[2:07:31.240 --> 2:07:39.760]  doctors Barrick and she worked together to insert bat virus spike protein into the backbone of the deadly SARS virus and
[2:07:39.760 --> 2:07:44.880]  Then use this man-made super virus to infect human airway cells
[2:07:45.680 --> 2:07:50.640]  Think about that for a moment. The SARS virus had a 15% mortality
[2:07:51.200 --> 2:07:55.400]  We're fighting a pandemic that has about a 1% mortality
[2:07:55.400 --> 2:08:04.280]  Can you imagine if a SARS virus that's been juiced up and had viral proteins added to it to the spike protein if that were released?
[2:08:04.720 --> 2:08:06.280]  accidentally
[2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:12.000]  Dr. Fauci, do you still support funding of the NIH funding of the lab in Wuhan?
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:19.480]  Senator Paul with all due respect you are entirely and completely incorrect
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:23.960]  That the NIH has not ever and does not now
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:31.480]  Fund your alliance come back a function research. He's doubling down Wuhan Institute. Do they find a barric?
[2:08:31.480 --> 2:08:36.240]  We do not fund if you find Dr. Barrick's gain of function research
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:45.120]  Dr. Barrett does not doing gain of function research and if it is it's according to the guidelines and it is being conducted in North
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:53.640]  Carolina and not thinking turning a bat virus spike protein that he got from the Wuhan Institute into the SARS virus is gain of function
[2:08:53.640 --> 2:09:00.120]  That is not a minority because at least 200 scientists have signed a statement from the Cambridge working group
[2:09:00.120 --> 2:09:02.120]  Saying that it is gain of function
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:07.520]  Well, it is not and if you look at the grant and you look at the progress reports
[2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:14.320]  It is not gain of function despite the fact that people tweet that so right about it
[2:09:14.320 --> 2:09:19.400]  Support sending money to the Wuhan Virology Institute. We do not send money now to do one on
[2:09:20.080 --> 2:09:24.680]  Support sending money. We did under your tutelage. We were sending it through eco health
[2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:31.440]  It was a sub agency and a sub grant. Do you support that the money from NIH that was going to the Wuhan Institute?
[2:09:31.440 --> 2:09:34.920]  Let me explain to you why that was done
[2:09:35.880 --> 2:09:37.880]  the SARS-CoV-1
[2:09:39.320 --> 2:09:43.280]  Originated in bats in China it would have been
[2:09:44.040 --> 2:09:46.480]  Irresponsible of us if we did not
[2:09:46.480 --> 2:09:54.080]  Investigate the bat viruses and the serology to see who might have been or perhaps it would be
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:58.600]  Possible to send it to the Chinese government that we may not be able to trust with this
[2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:05.320]  Knowledge and with this incredibly dangerous viruses government scientists like yourself who favor
[2:10:07.400 --> 2:10:11.720]  For joining us again here today the reason I replayed this from May
[2:10:11.720 --> 2:10:17.840]  We've got another article about it today is Fauci's back out making denials in the press that they ever find a gain of function
[2:10:17.840 --> 2:10:20.280]  They called it the gain of function research
[2:10:21.000 --> 2:10:23.000]  grant and
[2:10:23.280 --> 2:10:26.640]  The reason I wanted to play that is what we're gonna cover when we come back now
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:29.800]  When I say
[2:10:29.800 --> 2:10:35.600]  I've over prepared for something that's not a joke the media always picks that up was old Jones couldn't cover it
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:36.800]  He was over prepared
[2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:42.320]  Yeah, like I've got too much to cover here in the 10 minutes. I've got left before I got to go and then our amazing guest
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:45.120]  I was gonna take over that ladies energy is just incredible
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:55.480]  Fauci is all over TV and now everyone is regurgitating the line
[2:10:56.840 --> 2:11:02.200]  That 99% of the deaths of COVID are from people unvaccinated
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:09.240]  You can spend 30 seconds and go to the US government's own numbers and that's completely false and in fact almost
[2:11:09.880 --> 2:11:17.400]  50% of the new COVID deaths are in the vaccinated. I have the damn documents and articles right here
[2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:22.880]  But I've got Fox and CNN and all of them like demonic parrots
[2:11:23.760 --> 2:11:25.760]  Repeating the same lie over and over again
[2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:31.960]  So if I just show you these headlines and talk about this it doesn't really do anything
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:36.560]  We need to special reports special shows emergency broadcast. I don't know what we're gonna call this
[2:11:39.400 --> 2:11:44.680]  And I love this crew they do a great job, I've tried to harm more people so I can go live even more than just my show
[2:11:44.680 --> 2:11:51.120]  But I'm gonna talk to crew and see the ones to come here tonight to allow show about this because we gotta do a whole show on this
[2:11:51.720 --> 2:11:57.040]  Hey, everybody if you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:01.560]  I've got great news. In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while. Here's the thing
[2:12:01.560 --> 2:12:08.920]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans survival soup beans these beans are gorgeous
[2:12:09.080 --> 2:12:16.240]  Highly nutritious and above all with no hesitation whatsoever the best tasting beans in the entire world the best part
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:23.600]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week for listeners who know higher food prices are coming and want an inflation
[2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:30.640]  Head you can actually eat if you want to gets even better with your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being
[2:12:30.640 --> 2:12:37.440]  I also want to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated super food in the world
[2:12:37.760 --> 2:12:44.040]  Period go to soup bean survival calm that soup bean survival calm and discover the real reason
[2:12:44.040 --> 2:12:50.680]  We're giving this unusual super food away at soup bean survival calm that soup bean survival calm
[2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:55.680]  Your voice counts
[2:12:55.680 --> 2:13:03.360]  When you share information be it over the internet or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular

[2:13:52.600 --> 2:13:58.520]  The world is awakening the world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigms
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:07.000]  They are discovering the globalist the elites the manipulation the CFR the trilateral Commission the Bilderberg group the Bohemian Grove
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:09.000]  the club of Rome and
[2:14:10.040 --> 2:14:12.840]  So even though it seems like the globalist are winning
[2:14:13.640 --> 2:14:19.720]  The truth is they've had to come out the open to attack human freedom because they're actually losing
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:22.560]  We have forced them out in the open
[2:14:22.800 --> 2:14:27.080]  So as bad as these times are a lot of negative things are about to happen realize
[2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:33.160]  Humanity is winning you've got a trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:37.880]  That is invincible. That is ethereal timeless and unstoppable
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:45.000]  So don't trust in man trust in God to lead God and direct your soul and then take action against the globalist and realize

[2:14:53.360 --> 2:14:59.080]  Mike Lindell is a man in the arena a man after Teddy Roosevelt's own heart people demonize him
[2:14:59.080 --> 2:15:03.920]  They laugh at him they attack him, but he's been proven right the audits are coming out and there was total
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:11.320]  Absolute election fraud against the president from then against the American people that is the bottom line and Mike Lindell
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:16.600]  Is getting sued by all these big powerful globalist institutions trying to shut them down
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:21.560]  That's why it's so important to support my fellow calm and all the great products

[2:16:21.860 --> 2:16:30.740]  Let me tell you I'm impressed with Angela Stanton King
[2:16:31.540 --> 2:16:34.580]  She really feel like five years younger just being in here. I don't know what's going on with that lady
[2:16:34.580 --> 2:16:36.580]  But she's got some energy
[2:16:36.660 --> 2:16:40.900]  And she's gonna be hosting the next two segments and I'm inviting her back in the next month to come here and spend three
[2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:43.380]  Four days with all the shows her amazing work
[2:16:43.380 --> 2:16:44.740]  She's gonna be hosting the next two segments
[2:16:44.740 --> 2:16:48.660]  I got a doctor's appointment out of reschedule, but I'm coming back at three o'clock today
[2:16:48.660 --> 2:16:53.380]  And I'm gonna tape on a special emergency report with all this research
[2:16:53.380 --> 2:16:56.100]  I've got that is gonna air at six o'clock tonight
[2:16:56.820 --> 2:17:00.180]  When Owen shroyer goes off the air. I don't know. I'm gonna stream it over the satellites
[2:17:00.420 --> 2:17:03.940]  I may do that too or I may just post it to band off video, but
[2:17:07.540 --> 2:17:09.540]  Fauci is all over tv saying
[2:17:10.100 --> 2:17:14.820]  99% of people dying haven't had the vaccine and I've got the numbers. He's a liar
[2:17:14.820 --> 2:17:24.100]  There depending on the u.k. Israel the u.s. It's all 46 to 52% dying have already had the shot and most of the new cases are
[2:17:24.100 --> 2:17:30.740]  Invaccinated because it's all a fraud. It's that damn pcr test. I mean, who knows what the truth is. It's so many damn lies
[2:17:31.780 --> 2:17:33.780]  Now I I told you
[2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:37.460]  About this big article that jimmy white did for info wars.com
[2:17:38.740 --> 2:17:42.900]  Rand Paul calls out Fauci for lying to congress over gain of function research
[2:17:43.540 --> 2:17:44.580]  and
[2:17:44.580 --> 2:17:49.860]  We we played a clip from a few months ago because now Fauci's back and he completely
[2:17:51.140 --> 2:17:54.340]  Melts down so we're gonna get to that video here in just a moment, but first
[2:17:55.700 --> 2:17:57.700]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:17:58.740 --> 2:18:03.060]  We have products that are game changing and you heard our guests angela stanton king
[2:18:04.900 --> 2:18:09.860]  Who knows who I am but hadn't really seen the show because I asked her I said, how do you know about the depopulation?
[2:18:09.860 --> 2:18:15.220]  You know everything I know she goes well. I've just been living on researching it. So that's when you know we're winning folks
[2:18:15.220 --> 2:18:20.500]  There's this amazing lady. He's got everything I got and just as much or maybe more and she didn't get it from me
[2:18:21.700 --> 2:18:27.060]  That is exciting and she's pissed and she knows humanity's under attack and she gets it and she's not backing down
[2:18:27.540 --> 2:18:29.220]  That's exciting
[2:18:29.220 --> 2:18:32.580]  And that's the type of people we need in congress and that's the type of person
[2:18:32.580 --> 2:18:35.700]  I'd love to have her as president wouldn't you the point is is that
[2:18:35.700 --> 2:18:42.580]  We know we're under attack, but we got to warn others and we got to say we're not taking this crap anymore from these globalists
[2:18:43.380 --> 2:18:45.380]  But I can't do it if you don't support us
[2:18:45.700 --> 2:18:49.060]  So the my pillow advertisements brought a little bit extra money. That's great
[2:18:49.540 --> 2:18:52.660]  But then for anything I plugged and we don't sell our own products at that time
[2:18:52.820 --> 2:18:56.740]  So I got called into the accountant's office this morning. They said yeah, you're feeling real good about your my pillow plugs
[2:18:56.820 --> 2:19:00.660]  It's great products, but you know when you didn't plug our product here today, we had a major shortfall
[2:19:00.740 --> 2:19:02.740]  so it kind of averages out so
[2:19:02.740 --> 2:19:06.340]  I'm not bitching. I'm not complaining. I'm saying we got products. You already need
[2:19:06.740 --> 2:19:11.780]  We're not like the black rifle company coffee that says, you know, all our supporters suck. We hate gun owners
[2:19:11.860 --> 2:19:16.020]  We hate americans, you know, we you know, we think white people are evil or whatever
[2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:20.500]  We just sell coffee that's high quality and of course we wouldn't turn our backs on cowl written house
[2:19:20.660 --> 2:19:23.060]  We got coffee way back. I'm not even competition with those guys
[2:19:23.220 --> 2:19:27.940]  There's the new york times literally crapping all over america. So I'm gonna have to declare war on those guys
[2:19:28.260 --> 2:19:30.260]  the point is is that
[2:19:30.260 --> 2:19:36.500]  We are steadfast. We're not backing down and we need you to buy a book a coffee mug a t-shirt a whatever
[2:19:36.580 --> 2:19:39.940]  We appreciate you. We're not bitching at you. We're just saying hey, we're in this fight together
[2:19:40.020 --> 2:19:42.020]  I don't back down, but I need your support
[2:19:42.500 --> 2:19:48.420]  So green fiber capsules with all the amino acids and a ton of vitamins and minerals so good for you from the very best sprouts

[2:19:55.540 --> 2:20:05.060]  50% off. It's a limited time. It's horrible food sale will end this sunday. I barely plugged it to extended one week 10% off get 2020 prices today
[2:20:05.940 --> 2:20:07.940]  and then separately
[2:20:08.100 --> 2:20:09.300]  We also
[2:20:09.300 --> 2:20:16.660]  Have the big enchilada and I told you I just got to sell this to get money in and so I was selling the spray bottles of x2
[2:20:17.140 --> 2:20:19.140]  Just because that's what we had the majority of
[2:20:19.140 --> 2:20:25.780]  Total same bottle same stuff in it. There's different spray cap instead of a dropper cap. We sold out of this
[2:20:25.780 --> 2:20:29.220]  I mean they just told me 10 minutes go during the break. It'll be sold out by the end of the day
[2:20:29.460 --> 2:20:35.860]  So that's gone back to regular price till it sells out survival show that's to drip a dropper bottle exact same product

[2:20:45.700 --> 2:20:49.700]  That's why they hit you with the bad halogen fluoride and that whole family
[2:20:49.940 --> 2:20:52.180]  This is the opposite of what they want you to have
[2:20:52.260 --> 2:20:57.220]  This is what you should have and it's selling out x2 info or store.com 40% off
[2:20:57.460 --> 2:20:59.460]  Here is senator rand paul
[2:20:59.540 --> 2:21:05.220]  Destroying fouchy and fouchy shaking with anger because it's criminal actions of launching the covet attack is coming out
[2:21:06.420 --> 2:21:12.420]  Dr. Richard e bright a molecular biologist from rutgers described this research in wuhan as
[2:21:12.420 --> 2:21:19.220]  The wuhan lab used NIH funding to construct novel chimeric SARS related coronaviruses
[2:21:19.780 --> 2:21:27.060]  Able to infect human cells and laboratory animals. This is high-risk research that creates new
[2:21:27.780 --> 2:21:29.780]  potential pandemic pathogens
[2:21:30.660 --> 2:21:35.380]  Potential pandemic pathogens that exist only in the lab not in nature
[2:21:36.020 --> 2:21:39.380]  This research matches these are dr. E bright's words
[2:21:39.380 --> 2:21:47.380]  This research matches indeed epitomizes the definition of gain of function research done entirely in wuhan
[2:21:48.500 --> 2:21:50.980]  For which there was supposed to be a federal pause
[2:21:52.580 --> 2:21:55.700]  Dr. Fauci knowing that it is a crime to lie to congress
[2:21:56.180 --> 2:22:03.060]  Do you wish to retract your statement of may 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain of function research in wuhan?
[2:22:03.060 --> 2:22:08.340]  Senator paul, i have never lied before the congress
[2:22:08.340 --> 2:22:09.940]  Microphone
[2:22:09.940 --> 2:22:12.980]  Your microphone senator paul. I have never lied
[2:22:13.620 --> 2:22:16.260]  Before the congress and I do not retract
[2:22:16.900 --> 2:22:18.340]  That statement
[2:22:18.340 --> 2:22:25.140]  This paper that you were referring to was judged by qualified staff up and down the chain
[2:22:25.700 --> 2:22:28.820]  As not being gain of function
[2:22:28.820 --> 2:22:34.180]  So what was let me finish shaking animal virus and you increase the invincibility to humans
[2:22:34.420 --> 2:22:38.420]  You're saying that's not gain of function. Yeah, that is correct and and senator paul
[2:22:38.580 --> 2:22:42.740]  You do not know what you are talking about quite frankly and I want to say that
[2:22:43.220 --> 2:22:46.820]  Officially you do not know what you are talking about
[2:22:47.540 --> 2:22:50.340]  Okay, you get one person. It's read from the NIH
[2:22:50.420 --> 2:22:54.660]  Can I answer the question? This is your definition that you guys wrote
[2:22:54.660 --> 2:23:03.140]  It says that scientific research that increases the transmissibility of a transmissibility among animals is gain of function
[2:23:03.460 --> 2:23:09.780]  They took animal viruses that only occur in animals and they increased their transmissibility to humans
[2:23:10.100 --> 2:23:16.500]  How you can say that is not gain of function. It is not it's a dance and you're dancing around this because you're trying to obscure
[2:23:17.140 --> 2:23:20.900]  Responsibility for four million people dying around the world from a pandemic
[2:23:20.900 --> 2:23:27.300]  And let's let's send doctor. I have to well now you're getting into something if the point that you are making
[2:23:27.860 --> 2:23:34.180]  Is that the the grant that was funded as a sub-award from eco health to wuhan?
[2:23:34.660 --> 2:23:36.660]  Created SARS-CoV-2
[2:23:37.220 --> 2:23:40.180]  That's where you are getting let me finish. We don't know
[2:23:40.500 --> 2:23:42.100]  Well, wait a minute. I come to the lab
[2:23:42.180 --> 2:23:47.780]  But all the evidence is pointing that it came from the lab and there will be responsibility for those who funded the lab
[2:23:48.100 --> 2:23:49.060]  Including yourself
[2:23:49.060 --> 2:23:57.140]  I totally this committee will allow the witness to I totally resent the lie that you are now propagating senator
[2:23:57.780 --> 2:24:03.620]  Because if you look at the viruses that were used in the experiments
[2:24:04.260 --> 2:24:09.540]  That were given in the annual reports that were published in the literature
[2:24:10.100 --> 2:24:14.980]  It is molecularly impossible. No one's saying those virus caused it
[2:24:14.980 --> 2:24:21.940]  It is molecularly those virus caused the pandemic what we're alleging is the gain of function research was going on in that lab
[2:24:22.180 --> 2:24:28.260]  And NIH funded it that is not a little way from it. It meets your definition and you are obfuscating the truth
[2:24:28.420 --> 2:24:33.780]  I'm not obfuscating the truth. You're the one. I'm sorry, but I will allow the witness to let me just finish
[2:24:34.020 --> 2:24:39.780]  I want everyone to understand that if you look at those viruses and that's judged by qualified
[2:24:40.820 --> 2:24:42.820]  virologists and evolutionary biologists
[2:24:42.820 --> 2:24:50.820]  Those viruses are molecularly impossible. No one's saying they are. No one's saying the virus caused the pandemic
[2:24:54.820 --> 2:24:56.820]  Your voice counts
[2:24:56.820 --> 2:25:00.180]  When you share information be it over the internet or in person
[2:25:00.580 --> 2:25:05.380]  It changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular. They know you're angry
[2:25:05.940 --> 2:25:10.820]  And now to get around big tech it's more important than ever that we use every tool we've got

[2:29:24.500 --> 2:29:29.220]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's alex jones
[2:29:32.420 --> 2:29:37.380]  What's up everybody this is your new host of info wars for the next 30 minutes
[2:29:37.380 --> 2:29:42.580]  Angela statin king alas had to step off for a little bit. He knew I had it under control
[2:29:42.820 --> 2:29:46.420]  We're going to get back into something real quick before we go to another segment
[2:29:46.740 --> 2:29:48.740]  Let's touch back on the equality act
[2:29:48.980 --> 2:29:53.940]  You know, we were talking about that joe biden made it important that he signed that executive order
[2:29:54.180 --> 2:29:58.820]  And how it impacts our children and what's coming down the pipeline in our education system
[2:29:59.140 --> 2:30:03.460]  Listen, I went to the daycare the other day with a friend of mine to pick up my goddaughter
[2:30:03.460 --> 2:30:09.140]  This is a daycare. Her daughter is two years old. We walk into the front of the school
[2:30:09.540 --> 2:30:15.060]  And this is what's up on the board and as you can see in the brown puzzle it says
[2:30:15.780 --> 2:30:17.780]  sexual orientation
[2:30:18.020 --> 2:30:24.100]  Come to find out this particular school, which is the children's courtyard
[2:30:24.580 --> 2:30:30.260]  They're all over the united states and there are hundreds of them. I had a question. Hey, listen
[2:30:30.260 --> 2:30:34.260]  I'm not against anybody's preference or anything that anyone is doing
[2:30:34.820 --> 2:30:37.860]  but why is sexual orientation with just someone's
[2:30:38.660 --> 2:30:40.660]  preference for sex
[2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:43.540]  Listed on a bulletin board at a daycare
[2:30:44.100 --> 2:30:45.700]  For two year olds
[2:30:45.700 --> 2:30:48.900]  I was given the answer that it's all about diversity
[2:30:49.140 --> 2:30:54.420]  And if we didn't like it, we could take our child out of that school and take her somewhere else
[2:30:55.060 --> 2:30:56.500]  Listen america
[2:30:56.500 --> 2:31:02.420]  We're in trouble. It's time for us to wake up. Did you also know that in our schools now?
[2:31:02.500 --> 2:31:08.820]  They are allowing our children to be called by gender neutral names if they go in and say hey
[2:31:09.300 --> 2:31:10.900]  I want to be called
[2:31:10.900 --> 2:31:15.940]  Jill and my name is really jack the teachers are doing it and they're not notifying the parents
[2:31:16.580 --> 2:31:21.540]  What are your children being taught and why are we allowing that to happen?
[2:31:21.540 --> 2:31:26.900]  But I think that it's important that we wake up and realize that this agenda is serious
[2:31:26.980 --> 2:31:28.980]  And we need to get serious and fighting it
[2:31:29.780 --> 2:31:33.700]  That's what we need to do. So let's move on to our next subject president
[2:31:34.180 --> 2:31:34.580]  Trump
[2:31:34.580 --> 2:31:41.860]  I think we've got a clip of him as you heard alex say listen all of my instagram my social media my twitter my facebook
[2:31:42.420 --> 2:31:44.420]  all of my accounts have been disabled and
[2:31:45.140 --> 2:31:46.340]  suspended
[2:31:46.340 --> 2:31:53.220]  Nearly one million followers and supporters. Why because i'm not telling people that abortion is health care
[2:31:53.380 --> 2:31:57.700]  I'm telling them that abortion is death care because i'm telling people that hey
[2:31:58.260 --> 2:31:59.940]  lgbtq
[2:31:59.940 --> 2:32:05.780]  Even though that's your preference that you're an adult. They're all sexualities. Why are we tying sex to children?
[2:32:06.340 --> 2:32:08.980]  Who looks at a four-year-old or a five-year-old?
[2:32:09.540 --> 2:32:11.540]  And labels them a sexuality
[2:32:11.540 --> 2:32:19.300]  No, I don't get a Cadillac commercial for preaching abortion. I get censored for being pro-life
[2:32:19.940 --> 2:32:24.740]  President trump recently filed a lawsuit against big tech. Let's hear what he had to say
[2:32:26.020 --> 2:32:30.340]  I just want to say that I stand before you this morning to
[2:32:31.300 --> 2:32:33.300]  announce a very important
[2:32:33.620 --> 2:32:38.980]  And very beautiful. I think development for our freedom and our freedom of speech
[2:32:38.980 --> 2:32:40.980]  And that goes to all americans
[2:32:42.420 --> 2:32:43.940]  today
[2:32:43.940 --> 2:32:46.340]  In conjunction with the america first
[2:32:47.380 --> 2:32:49.380]  policy institute i'm filing
[2:32:50.180 --> 2:32:55.460]  As the lead class representative a major class action lawsuit against
[2:32:56.260 --> 2:32:59.620]  The big tech giants including facebook google and twitter
[2:33:00.660 --> 2:33:03.780]  As well as their ceo's mark zuckerberg
[2:33:03.780 --> 2:33:10.420]  Sundar butchay and jack dorsi three real nice guys
[2:33:13.380 --> 2:33:15.380]  We're asking the u.s
[2:33:15.460 --> 2:33:20.020]  district court for the southern district of florida to order an immediate halt
[2:33:20.740 --> 2:33:25.620]  To social media companies a legal shameful censorship of
[2:33:26.260 --> 2:33:29.380]  The american people and that's exactly what they are doing
[2:33:29.380 --> 2:33:33.540]  We're demanding an end to the shadow banning
[2:33:34.420 --> 2:33:42.260]  A stop to the silencing and a stop to the blacklisting banishing and cancelling that you know so well
[2:33:43.220 --> 2:33:45.060]  Our case
[2:33:45.060 --> 2:33:53.220]  Will prove this censorship is unlawful. It's unconstitutional and it's completely unamerican. We all know that we know all know that
[2:33:53.940 --> 2:33:55.940]  very very well
[2:33:55.940 --> 2:34:00.580]  Our filing also seeks injunctive relief to allow prompt
[2:34:01.300 --> 2:34:03.300]  restitution and
[2:34:03.380 --> 2:34:10.420]  Really restoration and you can name about 20 other things and it has to be prompt because it's destroying our country
[2:34:11.540 --> 2:34:13.300]  Of my accounts
[2:34:13.300 --> 2:34:21.220]  In addition we are asking the court to impose punitive damages on these social media giants
[2:34:21.220 --> 2:34:27.140]  We're going to hold big tech very accountable. This is the first of
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:33.620]  Numerous other lawsuits. I assume that would follow but this is the lead and I think it's going to be
[2:34:34.340 --> 2:34:37.140]  A very very important game changer for our country
[2:34:37.860 --> 2:34:43.140]  It will be a pivotal battle in the defense of the first amendment and in the end
[2:34:43.220 --> 2:34:46.500]  I am confident that we will achieve a historic victory for
[2:34:47.220 --> 2:34:48.900]  american freedom
[2:34:48.900 --> 2:34:51.380]  And at the same time freedom of speech
[2:34:57.060 --> 2:35:01.140]  What the president said did you just hear what president trump said, you know
[2:35:01.140 --> 2:35:05.140]  I was sitting back and I was watching and I followed president trump on twitter
[2:35:05.140 --> 2:35:10.820]  I also followed him on instagram because I was very hip and aware of how fake news could be
[2:35:10.820 --> 2:35:16.180]  I had been in the media before I had you know a 30 million dollar frivolous lawsuit filed against me
[2:35:16.180 --> 2:35:18.900]  I was made out to be the bad guy. None of that stuff was true
[2:35:19.140 --> 2:35:22.900]  And it took a long time for me to be able to prove my truth in court
[2:35:23.140 --> 2:35:24.260]  But I stood on it
[2:35:24.260 --> 2:35:27.780]  But I said and I watched how the media not only attacked the president
[2:35:27.780 --> 2:35:34.020]  But also attacked people like me that supported him somehow me with my brown skin instantly became a white supremacist
[2:35:34.340 --> 2:35:41.380]  But trump's social media allowed him to debunk everything that they said it allowed him to show his truth
[2:35:41.380 --> 2:35:47.140]  And when they silenced the sitting president of the united states, I knew then
[2:35:47.700 --> 2:35:52.900]  That there was no hope for the rest of us if they could silence a sitting president
[2:35:53.140 --> 2:35:58.260]  Hey, what if there's an emergency? What if a bomb goes off this guy is who's in control?
[2:35:58.340 --> 2:36:00.100]  He has the power
[2:36:00.100 --> 2:36:03.940]  How do you silence a united states sitting president?
[2:36:04.180 --> 2:36:10.020]  I knew then that big tech had too much power and after that they start coming after us
[2:36:10.020 --> 2:36:15.140]  One by one me they consider me to be a threat. Why not only am I a trump supporter?
[2:36:15.300 --> 2:36:21.060]  I'm a black trump supporter. Listen, mr. President. You know, I love you. I sent them my information already
[2:36:21.140 --> 2:36:24.900]  I've got all of my screenshots. I've got all of my emails anything that you need
[2:36:25.220 --> 2:36:30.740]  I'll be glad to join hands with you on this lawsuit because freedom of speech is a real thing
[2:36:31.860 --> 2:36:33.300]  This is serious
[2:36:33.300 --> 2:36:39.140]  Even going back to the equality act things that were signed by joe biden with a ban conversion therapy
[2:36:39.140 --> 2:36:43.220]  These things take away your rights as a parent
[2:36:44.500 --> 2:36:46.500]  You have the freedom of speech
[2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:52.660]  If someone is telling your child something that you don't believe or something that you don't support as a parent
[2:36:52.660 --> 2:36:54.660]  You should have the right
[2:36:54.740 --> 2:36:56.740]  to tell your child the truth
[2:36:57.460 --> 2:36:59.460]  Look at my story. This is a real guys
[2:37:00.260 --> 2:37:02.180]  Have you been following me?
[2:37:02.180 --> 2:37:06.500]  Do you not see what's happening and what's playing out before our eyes?
[2:37:06.500 --> 2:37:08.500]  Right here in america
[2:37:08.580 --> 2:37:13.300]  This country is being taken over. It's being stolen and
[2:37:14.020 --> 2:37:20.260]  Swept right from up under our feet. They wanted to make it seem as though this was all about racism
[2:37:20.340 --> 2:37:27.620]  No, it wasn't this was about our freedom. So that lawsuit that trump filed, you know, I pay attention to what's going on
[2:37:27.700 --> 2:37:34.020]  It seems like that came right on the heels of a bill that governor dissented signed down in Florida
[2:37:34.020 --> 2:37:39.700]  Allowing people to be able to sue big tech if I'm right
[2:37:39.780 --> 2:37:45.140]  I do believe that trump is in Florida. So maybe these two have gotten together and decided hey
[2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:47.860]  We're going to do something but do you guys also remember
[2:37:48.260 --> 2:37:54.740]  Before they silenced trump on press on on twitter and he was begging congress to do something about section 230
[2:37:55.140 --> 2:37:57.940]  He knew this was coming. How did this get into play?
[2:37:58.500 --> 2:38:01.460]  How is the media able to just lie?
[2:38:01.460 --> 2:38:03.460]  And mislead the people
[2:38:04.500 --> 2:38:07.540]  Absolutely amazing. We need to stand up
[2:38:08.180 --> 2:38:10.180]  and and why are we
[2:38:10.260 --> 2:38:12.260]  allowing people to divide us
[2:38:12.980 --> 2:38:14.500]  by race
[2:38:14.500 --> 2:38:16.020]  by politics
[2:38:16.020 --> 2:38:21.060]  And what book is it written that because I'm black I can't have conservative values
[2:38:21.460 --> 2:38:28.660]  Or because I've spent time in prison or because I was what you want to say a lifetime welfare recipient
[2:38:28.660 --> 2:38:33.540]  And I learned how to get off of my butt and go start my own business and become financially free
[2:38:33.780 --> 2:38:35.780]  Who's to say that I can't change my mind?
[2:38:36.740 --> 2:38:42.100]  Why does all black people have to be democrat and if you have conservative values
[2:38:42.580 --> 2:38:44.580]  Then you're a white supremacist
[2:38:44.580 --> 2:38:47.620]  But men can be women and our children can be transition
[2:38:48.500 --> 2:38:50.500]  America wake up
[2:38:52.020 --> 2:38:55.380]  As we predicted the globalist are now launching a new lockdown
[2:38:55.380 --> 2:39:00.820]  The first one has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death
[2:39:01.060 --> 2:39:04.420]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world
[2:39:05.140 --> 2:39:09.140]  Ladies and gentlemen now is the time for you to get high quality storeable food that's ready to ship

[2:39:57.780 --> 2:40:02.500]  Thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people
[2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:08.340]  I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[2:40:08.900 --> 2:40:10.900]  Infection on my lung that'll never go away
[2:40:11.300 --> 2:40:15.780]  Living defense saved my life. They had me on antibiotics for two years
[2:40:15.780 --> 2:40:21.380]  That almost killed me living defense brought me back. I wanted to just quote from the bible
[2:40:21.460 --> 2:40:26.740]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now. This is Matthew 24 verse 9
[2:40:26.820 --> 2:40:29.300]  Then they shall deliver you up to be
[2:40:29.940 --> 2:40:35.940]  Afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my namesake
[2:40:36.100 --> 2:40:41.540]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[2:40:41.540 --> 2:40:47.380]  That's right where we're at brother. And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say
[2:40:47.700 --> 2:40:50.900]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country
[2:40:53.380 --> 2:40:56.740]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're
[2:40:57.140 --> 2:41:01.540]  Supercomputers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do
[2:41:01.620 --> 2:41:05.620]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate
[2:41:05.780 --> 2:41:10.340]  I still have one because this trojan horse this promethean fire has a lot of power
[2:41:10.340 --> 2:41:16.900]  But when i'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality faraday cage a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com

[2:41:32.260 --> 2:41:33.860]  for

[2:42:47.300 --> 2:42:53.300]  Yeah, absolutely
[2:42:55.620 --> 2:42:58.260]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:43:11.540 --> 2:43:13.540]  Waging war on corruption
[2:43:13.540 --> 2:43:21.540]  It's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:43:24.260 --> 2:43:25.700]  Everybody we're back
[2:43:25.700 --> 2:43:31.940]  Once again, we're talking about some of the most tragic things that are happening here in america to me
[2:43:32.020 --> 2:43:36.020]  It's a loss of all common sense before we get into this next clip
[2:43:36.100 --> 2:43:39.300]  Make sure that you all pick up a copy of my story
[2:43:39.300 --> 2:43:44.020]  Caught in the coup available at angela stanton epk.com
[2:43:44.500 --> 2:43:46.660]  Find out the truth about what was going on
[2:43:47.060 --> 2:43:53.220]  Um in trump's white house not what you know the fake news is he always called it tried to make us believe
[2:43:53.460 --> 2:43:56.740]  You guys can pick up that copy of angela stanton epk.com
[2:43:57.060 --> 2:44:00.580]  And i'm also on youtube at the angela stanton king show
[2:44:00.980 --> 2:44:01.940]  so
[2:44:01.940 --> 2:44:04.980]  Common sense used to be a thing right you just used to know
[2:44:04.980 --> 2:44:11.940]  Right from wrong regardless of what anybody tried to tell you regardless of what anybody else decided to teach you you knew
[2:44:12.820 --> 2:44:18.500]  Right from wrong. You know that if you jump into water, it could either be shallow or it could be deep
[2:44:18.580 --> 2:44:24.100]  Those are things that you know, so you're taking a risk on jumping into water. You need to be prepared to swim
[2:44:24.900 --> 2:44:30.020]  Common sense has gone completely out of the window and joe by ins america
[2:44:30.740 --> 2:44:32.740]  Look at this clip
[2:44:32.740 --> 2:44:34.740]  Oh
[2:44:38.100 --> 2:44:40.100]  The baby has been able to latch
[2:44:40.340 --> 2:44:42.660]  But i've not been able to produce any milk
[2:44:42.820 --> 2:44:50.260]  That's okay because we're going to supplement the feeding with formula so that my baby is still getting the the nutrients that they need
[2:44:50.820 --> 2:44:51.780]  But
[2:44:51.780 --> 2:44:55.300]  I'm still feeling comfortable. I appreciate you so much for all your work
[2:44:56.020 --> 2:44:58.020]  I appreciate you also, baby
[2:44:58.020 --> 2:45:02.500]  I'm gonna turn without you
[2:45:02.660 --> 2:45:04.020]  I'm land
[2:45:04.020 --> 2:45:08.420]  Let's talk about this for a minute america because what you just witnessed in that clip
[2:45:09.140 --> 2:45:10.740]  you just saw
[2:45:10.740 --> 2:45:16.340]  The woman who was the one that had the beard and the red hair on the right with the scar under her breast
[2:45:16.900 --> 2:45:20.660]  That actually cut her breast off to transition to a man
[2:45:21.300 --> 2:45:24.100]  The one with the glasses has given birth to the baby
[2:45:25.300 --> 2:45:26.740]  the man
[2:45:26.740 --> 2:45:31.460]  Is now transitioning to the mother and has the baby
[2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:39.140]  Sucking on his breast listen to what's happening in joe by ins america the man is saying
[2:45:39.780 --> 2:45:42.100]  The baby has been able to latch on
[2:45:42.820 --> 2:45:44.820]  But i can't produce
[2:45:45.060 --> 2:45:49.300]  Any milk now i know the democrat say that we're supposed to support science
[2:45:49.300 --> 2:45:57.540]  But where the hell is science and where the hell is common sense the woman who had the breast that actually produced the milk
[2:45:58.580 --> 2:46:00.580]  dismembered her breast
[2:46:00.820 --> 2:46:02.500]  remove them
[2:46:02.500 --> 2:46:04.500]  and now the man
[2:46:04.660 --> 2:46:06.660]  has the baby
[2:46:06.900 --> 2:46:08.900]  Sucking on a male titty
[2:46:09.460 --> 2:46:12.980]  That cannot produce milk and you are telling me that
[2:46:13.620 --> 2:46:15.060]  This is normal
[2:46:15.060 --> 2:46:21.780]  This is no offense to anybody in the lgbtq community and there are many people that stand with me that say angela
[2:46:21.780 --> 2:46:26.820]  You know what you're absolutely right. This is going too far. This is not what we represent
[2:46:27.060 --> 2:46:33.380]  Is anyone thinking about the children? What is the purpose of the baby sucking on the man's nipple?
[2:46:34.500 --> 2:46:35.380]  if
[2:46:35.380 --> 2:46:36.900]  He does not
[2:46:36.900 --> 2:46:41.780]  Produce milk if you ask me those are definitely signs of pedophilic behavior
[2:46:41.780 --> 2:46:46.660]  But of course once again, this is joe by ins america. This is what?
[2:46:47.220 --> 2:46:52.660]  In our school system. This is what's in our equality act and this is what's coming down the pipeline
[2:46:53.300 --> 2:46:58.820]  For our children. So let's get on to another very important subject. We're hearing it all over the news
[2:46:59.540 --> 2:47:00.580]  coronavirus
[2:47:00.580 --> 2:47:05.700]  They're saying that there's another variant on the way. They're pushing vaccines
[2:47:05.700 --> 2:47:13.940]  Um, you know joe biden his administration has decided to go door to door to make sure that the unvaccinated are vaccinated because they're saying
[2:47:14.580 --> 2:47:16.820]  That the unvaccinated are going to
[2:47:17.700 --> 2:47:19.700]  Infect the vaccinated now
[2:47:20.100 --> 2:47:23.780]  This is my question and i'm not the brightest person in the world
[2:47:24.340 --> 2:47:28.020]  And i was just talking to my dad because we were planning on having our family reunion
[2:47:28.420 --> 2:47:34.580]  At the end of this month and they wanted to know who was all vaccinated and who was not so they're afraid and they may cancel
[2:47:34.580 --> 2:47:39.060]  I said but dad i said if if you've already taken your vaccine your shot
[2:47:39.140 --> 2:47:46.180]  I said then you're protected. I say why are you worried about me if you're taking if you've already taken the shot
[2:47:46.660 --> 2:47:49.460]  That's supposed to protect you from getting it
[2:47:50.180 --> 2:47:58.820]  Then why are you worried about the people that have it and if you've already taken a shot that's supposed to protect you from getting it
[2:47:59.940 --> 2:48:02.100]  Um, why do you have to still wear a mask?
[2:48:02.100 --> 2:48:05.700]  I mean this whole thing is a little confusing to me
[2:48:05.940 --> 2:48:07.060]  You know, it seems to me
[2:48:07.060 --> 2:48:13.780]  I saw a clip one time of you know some hollywood celebrities saying that they'd had to do anything that they could to get trump out of office
[2:48:13.860 --> 2:48:17.540]  Even if it was shutting down the economy to me
[2:48:18.660 --> 2:48:22.260]  I think it's all a plot and a plan to just get trump out of office
[2:48:22.340 --> 2:48:28.100]  I'm not saying that covid wasn't real and there aren't evil people in the world in the world that created some type of
[2:48:28.100 --> 2:48:35.620]  You know disease that was spread and killed people because people are just that evil if they're an important full term babies
[2:48:36.420 --> 2:48:42.900]  Harvesting their organs. I don't know any woman has ever had an abortion that said hey, let me have my baby's remains
[2:48:43.700 --> 2:48:45.700]  Or walked out of a clinic with their baby
[2:48:47.700 --> 2:48:49.220]  Where are those
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:50.900]  bodies going
[2:48:50.900 --> 2:48:53.940]  Those fresh hearts those fresh livers those fresh
[2:48:54.660 --> 2:48:56.660]  brains all those fresh
[2:48:56.660 --> 2:48:58.260]  sales
[2:48:58.260 --> 2:49:00.980]  I think that america again, like I said
[2:49:01.700 --> 2:49:06.420]  We have to wake up. It's just too much going on and censorship is a very big thing
[2:49:06.500 --> 2:49:12.660]  So listen, I'm excited about what alex jones and the rest of the staff are doing here at info wars
[2:49:12.900 --> 2:49:16.100]  Because I've learned that not only was my astray on the show
[2:49:16.580 --> 2:49:20.660]  But risa islam is also coming on the show later this week
[2:49:21.380 --> 2:49:23.940]  That's a brother of mine that I work within the community
[2:49:23.940 --> 2:49:29.540]  One of the things that we realize is we're no longer going to be separated by political parties
[2:49:29.860 --> 2:49:31.860]  We're not going to be separated by race
[2:49:32.180 --> 2:49:34.580]  We're not going to be separated by religion
[2:49:34.900 --> 2:49:39.780]  And we're not going to be separated by sexuality. The only thing that's going to separate us
[2:49:40.420 --> 2:49:42.420]  Is good and evil
[2:49:42.820 --> 2:49:48.900]  You don't have to have a certain amount of money or be a certain religion to know what's right and what's wrong
[2:49:48.900 --> 2:49:55.700]  Everybody gets that there's good and bad in every race. There's good and bad in every religion
[2:49:56.020 --> 2:49:58.900]  There's good and bad in every economic status, right?
[2:49:59.700 --> 2:50:05.780]  So when we're speaking about these things like the pedophilia that's creeping its way down through the lgbtq
[2:50:06.660 --> 2:50:12.420]  Community and that movement. We're not attacking everyone in that community. We're saying hey
[2:50:13.380 --> 2:50:16.580]  Even if you're in that community speak out against this
[2:50:16.580 --> 2:50:22.740]  We know that pedophilia is the real thing, you know back in the day when we were younger, you know, they just said
[2:50:22.980 --> 2:50:28.180]  It was child molestation. There have been predators for children for a very long time
[2:50:29.700 --> 2:50:32.020]  Let's not act like this is something new
[2:50:34.180 --> 2:50:36.340]  We need to start showing up to our schools
[2:50:37.060 --> 2:50:39.940]  We need to start showing up to our capitals
[2:50:40.500 --> 2:50:45.460]  We need to start demanding that our people in congress and our state
[2:50:45.460 --> 2:50:53.060]  Legislators protect the innocence of our children. Why are we allowing them to be sexualized?
[2:50:56.500 --> 2:50:58.500]  How can you explain it
[2:50:58.660 --> 2:51:00.660]  How can you explain
[2:51:01.220 --> 2:51:02.580]  This choir
[2:51:02.580 --> 2:51:07.140]  Over 60 men saying hey, we're going to convert your children
[2:51:07.140 --> 2:51:13.220]  I don't know anybody of any type of sexuality that had to be converted. I mean we all grew up. We were all kids
[2:51:13.220 --> 2:51:18.260]  You you figured it out. It takes time to develop your personality
[2:51:19.460 --> 2:51:23.860]  This whole war against our children is psychological
[2:51:25.780 --> 2:51:32.420]  The rainbow the bright colors any teacher any parent any counselor
[2:51:33.300 --> 2:51:36.500]  You know that children are attracted to bright colors
[2:51:36.500 --> 2:51:41.940]  How many cartoons have they made to entertain children that use bright colors?
[2:51:42.500 --> 2:51:44.500]  How many videos? How many toys?
[2:51:45.540 --> 2:51:50.900]  How many educational seminars everything you see represents the rainbow?
[2:51:54.100 --> 2:51:56.100]  Look at this
[2:51:57.060 --> 2:52:02.740]  This is happening right before our eyes. Why does a child need to know
[2:52:02.740 --> 2:52:05.540]  What an adult prefers sexually
[2:52:07.780 --> 2:52:09.780]  How is that on the front line?
[2:52:11.300 --> 2:52:15.300]  When we were kids, we were just trying to figure out how do we spell our name?
[2:52:15.540 --> 2:52:18.660]  How do we color inside of a straight line?
[2:52:19.380 --> 2:52:21.380]  How do we finish a complete sentence?
[2:52:22.980 --> 2:52:24.980]  Let alone trying to figure out
[2:52:25.140 --> 2:52:27.140]  What we had in our pants
[2:52:28.020 --> 2:52:30.020]  Or how to use it
[2:52:30.020 --> 2:52:34.020]  Most of the drag queens that I see entertaining children
[2:52:34.740 --> 2:52:38.740]  They look like cartoon characters and another thing with this clip that's playing right here
[2:52:39.060 --> 2:52:48.020]  Has anybody paid attention to that the front runners of this movement are always brown or black even with the flag?
[2:52:49.540 --> 2:52:54.020]  They added the black and brown stripes. How did sexuality all of a sudden
[2:52:54.020 --> 2:52:56.020]  Tied to a minority?
[2:52:57.380 --> 2:53:03.060]  Why are people being defined by their sexual preference when I meet you?
[2:53:03.060 --> 2:53:06.580]  I don't need to know that you're gay. I don't even need to know that you're straight
[2:53:06.580 --> 2:53:10.900]  Tell me your name what type of business you're in and how we can work together and I'm good
[2:53:10.900 --> 2:53:15.460]  What you do in your bedroom is not my concern
[2:53:17.540 --> 2:53:19.540]  Let's get back to the question
[2:53:19.540 --> 2:53:25.300]  Not my concern. Let's get back to common sense America
[2:53:26.180 --> 2:53:28.180]  Let's go against censorship
[2:53:28.260 --> 2:53:33.780]  Let's go against the sexual perversion of our children and let's stop being blinded by fake news
[2:53:33.860 --> 2:53:38.660]  I've enjoyed it today. Angela Stan and King. I mean Angela Stan EPK.com

[2:56:28.820 --> 2:56:34.740]  But it isn't merely a temporary tyranny these lunatics are driving humanity towards the end game

[2:56:42.900 --> 2:56:51.940]  Operation lockstep which has almost completely unfolded as it was written the implementation of a full blown biometric id system
[2:56:52.420 --> 2:56:56.260]  Won't merely address the fears and control of the covet cold
[2:56:56.580 --> 2:57:03.220]  How much control of information should there be and by whom and how can false information be effectively challenged
[2:57:03.220 --> 2:57:08.580]  And what if that false information is coming from companies or from governments
[2:57:09.140 --> 2:57:12.580]  We're at a moment where the social media platforms have to
[2:57:13.540 --> 2:57:19.140]  Step forward and recognize the moment to assert that they're a technology platform and not a broadcaster
[2:57:19.460 --> 2:57:21.460]  Is is over
[2:57:21.460 --> 2:57:29.220]  They in fact have to be a participant in broadcasting accurate information and partnering with the scientific and health communities to
[2:57:29.220 --> 2:57:37.780]  Counterweight if not flood the zone of accurate information because it's a threat to put the genie back in the bottle of the misinformation
[2:57:37.780 --> 2:57:44.580]  And disinformation is not impossible one thing we haven't spoken about and I'm wondering whether it's time to talk about this is
[2:57:45.220 --> 2:57:49.780]  A step up from the part of the government's on enforcement actions against fake news
[2:57:50.260 --> 2:57:52.260]  This is an enormous task
[2:57:52.260 --> 2:57:59.620]  The fingerprints and eye scans of every indian in the country are being taken and collated into an online database
[2:58:01.220 --> 2:58:05.620]  When complete everyone will have a unique 12-digit identity number
[2:58:05.860 --> 2:58:10.580]  It'll enable them to access India's vast and unwieldy welfare states
[2:58:10.580 --> 2:58:15.860]  It will enslave humanity in other levels of technocracy including a functional
[2:58:15.860 --> 2:58:24.340]  MRI scanner at airports and public places to detect abnormal behavior and anti-social intent a cheaper lower bandwidth
[2:58:24.980 --> 2:58:29.940]  Telepresence technology that serves those who are under permanent lockdown
[2:58:30.180 --> 2:58:38.340]  Eventually a china-style firewall will fracture the internet as it is driven by protectionism and national security concerns
[2:58:38.340 --> 2:58:46.900]  Biometric systems can recognize a person's specific physical attributes their fingerprints facial features iris or retina
[2:58:48.340 --> 2:58:52.900]  The technology is already used around the world by the Somali army
[2:58:52.900 --> 2:59:00.340]  Indian doctors and for authenticating patients for important drugs or for online banking on smartphones
[2:59:00.340 --> 2:59:07.380]  There are even systems that look under your skin so to speak such as infrared scanners that are used in vein matching
[2:59:07.780 --> 2:59:14.580]  Oxygen pour blood in veins absorbs more infrared light than surrounding tissue so that vein patterns can be matched
[2:59:15.380 --> 2:59:17.380]  You know
[2:59:17.380 --> 2:59:20.340]  I was a lab technician myself
[2:59:20.340 --> 2:59:23.780]  I'm immunologist and I have worked in the lab
[2:59:24.340 --> 2:59:26.580]  And lab accidents happen
[2:59:26.580 --> 2:59:34.500]  It's common. It is vital that we determine without question that the coronavirus is absolutely a biological weapon
[2:59:34.820 --> 2:59:41.940]  Released by the communist chinese government who appear at the center of operation lockstep as the totalitarian heroes
[2:59:42.260 --> 2:59:44.260]  They were made out to be in 2020
[2:59:44.740 --> 2:59:47.860]  Just as they were depicted by the Rockefeller foundation
[2:59:48.340 --> 2:59:54.740]  11 years earlier in operation lockstep our government has already made a decision on whether or not to be able to
[2:59:54.740 --> 3:00:00.180]  Lockstep our government has become powerless at wielding justice against the corruption
[3:00:00.500 --> 3:00:07.620]  Tightening its grip on the levers of control that we openly live in a system that if an individual plans a murder
[3:00:07.940 --> 3:00:11.300]  They are charged with premeditated murder in the first degree
[3:00:11.540 --> 3:00:17.540]  But if globalist think tanks in league with the united nations and the communist chinese government
[3:00:17.540 --> 3:00:25.860]  Literally print a document with the intent of the advancement of genocide and technocratic tyranny on a global scale
[3:00:25.940 --> 3:00:31.140]  That actually comes to pass. Well, then it's just business as usual
[3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:47.140]  John bound reporting
[3:00:50.820 --> 3:00:55.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen shroyer here the host of the info wars war room and I am very excited

[3:01:56.180 --> 3:02:03.220]  Live from london england, it's paul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:02:07.060 --> 3:02:13.060]  We all live it is the summit news hour and i'm gonna cover a news story that just broke about an hour ago
[3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:19.460]  Probably in the next segment where the top health official in australia is now literally telling people in australia
[3:02:19.700 --> 3:02:21.540]  That they can't have
[3:02:21.540 --> 3:02:25.140]  Conversations with each other because they found one new
[3:02:25.940 --> 3:02:28.740]  Covid case in that area of australia
[3:02:29.380 --> 3:02:33.460]  In new south wales, but i'm going to get into that later because of course we celebrated
[3:02:33.940 --> 3:02:40.180]  Freedom day here in london here in the uk yesterday when all coronavirus restrictions were supposed to be lifted
[3:02:40.180 --> 3:02:44.580]  The freedom day protesters the actual freedom protesters
[3:02:45.220 --> 3:02:48.820]  Went out onto the streets once again, and they celebrated their freedom
[3:02:48.820 --> 3:02:52.660]  They were able to respect embrace embody and communicate their freedom
[3:02:53.300 --> 3:02:57.780]  By having seven shades of hell beaten out of them by the police
[3:02:57.940 --> 3:02:59.940]  Because we're so free
[3:03:01.140 --> 3:03:05.700]  Of course we have a situation now where by even though these restrictions have been lifted
[3:03:05.700 --> 3:03:10.580]  I would say from personal experience just from walking around today
[3:03:11.300 --> 3:03:14.980]  Despite the fact that there's no law that says you have to wear a mask in a shop
[3:03:15.940 --> 3:03:22.100]  In most other places. I think only airports are the ones who actually can legally enforce it, but maybe not even then
[3:03:22.900 --> 3:03:29.620]  80% of people are still wearing the masks. We had the hottest day so far this year in the uk yesterday
[3:03:29.620 --> 3:03:31.620]  Today is almost as hot
[3:03:31.620 --> 3:03:39.060]  People still wearing masks outside. People literally sat down outside with no one else around them
[3:03:39.380 --> 3:03:43.220]  Eating their lunch and then putting the mask back on in between bites
[3:03:43.780 --> 3:03:48.180]  People queuing up again with no one around them two or three people in a queue
[3:03:48.820 --> 3:03:51.540]  To eat an outdoor restaurant
[3:03:52.100 --> 3:03:58.500]  Wearing their masks from the point where you meet the person at the front desk of the restaurant to where you sit down
[3:03:58.500 --> 3:04:01.940]  Ten yards away outside the entire time
[3:04:02.260 --> 3:04:06.660]  But wearing their masks when they stand there to book their table
[3:04:07.300 --> 3:04:11.300]  Why is everyone so petrified? Why is everyone so brainwashed?
[3:04:11.620 --> 3:04:17.300]  Why does this have a lasting effect? Well, it's not just a cliche. It was a deliberate military
[3:04:17.540 --> 3:04:23.540]  Shops operation. We have the documents on it. They've all come out because the vast majority of the British population
[3:04:23.540 --> 3:04:29.300]  Don't know this, but we know why they're so cowed. Why they're so
[3:04:30.260 --> 3:04:34.980]  Jellyfish like in their complete subservience and total compliance to these mandates
[3:04:34.980 --> 3:04:39.620]  Which even though the government says they now don't have to comply with in a number of cases
[3:04:40.180 --> 3:04:44.020]  They're doing so of their own accord because they've been so terrified
[3:04:44.740 --> 3:04:50.260]  Because they were given a completely false picture of the lethality of this virus from the very beginning
[3:04:50.260 --> 3:04:57.060]  There's a book called a state of fear by Laura Doddsworth, which has made waves here in the UK
[3:04:57.620 --> 3:05:05.620]  And she got the documents proving that at the start of the pandemic the government made a conscious decision to shift from handling the outbreak of this pandemic
[3:05:06.500 --> 3:05:11.780]  Via the textbook basis of how they would handle all historical pandemics before it which is
[3:05:12.100 --> 3:05:18.260]  To protect the vulnerable and then allow everyone else to go about their lives in order to achieve herd immunity
[3:05:18.260 --> 3:05:21.060]  That was how we dealt with every other major pandemic in the past
[3:05:21.780 --> 3:05:25.060]  But they made a rapid decision to do a u-turn on that
[3:05:25.860 --> 3:05:33.140]  In the early days of the pandemic right before the lockdown was announced here in the united kingdom towards the end of march 2020
[3:05:33.540 --> 3:05:35.540]  when they literally allowed
[3:05:35.540 --> 3:05:41.380]  behavioral scientists not virologists not medical scientists behavioral scientists
[3:05:41.380 --> 3:05:47.940]  Gchq and the british military to take over the task of
[3:05:48.900 --> 3:05:52.900]  Informing the population of how they should respond to the pandemic
[3:05:53.220 --> 3:05:57.780]  Of course by informing they literally mean brainwashing and mind control
[3:05:58.900 --> 3:06:04.500]  Totalitarian unethical methods of brainwashing and mind control which they themselves admitted
[3:06:05.060 --> 3:06:08.500]  to Laura Doddsworth the author who published this book
[3:06:08.500 --> 3:06:15.140]  This was the scientific pandemic influenza group on behaviors again behavioral scientists weaponizing their trade
[3:06:15.460 --> 3:06:18.260]  To cout how people into being terrified of the virus
[3:06:19.140 --> 3:06:25.300]  And they did so because they thought that many people quote still do not feel sufficiently personally threatened
[3:06:25.620 --> 3:06:29.460]  And that the perceived level of personal threat needs to be increased
[3:06:29.780 --> 3:06:34.900]  Because that's the only way they thought people would comply with any of these mandates whatsoever
[3:06:34.900 --> 3:06:38.340]  Which was completely wrong by the way because most people were complying with the
[3:06:38.980 --> 3:06:47.700]  Social distancing and the handwashing for weeks and maybe even more than a month before the lockdown was brought into legal force
[3:06:48.740 --> 3:06:53.860]  So we had the behavioral scientists on the sage committee who again aren't medical scientists
[3:06:54.340 --> 3:06:59.540]  Telling the government that they need to use totalitarian unethical propaganda brainwashing methods
[3:06:59.540 --> 3:07:06.260]  And the brainwashing methods lie to the public in order to make them terrified to make them more compliant. That's exactly what happened
[3:07:07.380 --> 3:07:13.860]  She also writes and this is covered in the article out of the telegraph life inside the fear factory government keeps us on high alert
[3:07:14.900 --> 3:07:16.900]  She also writes about the RICU
[3:07:17.940 --> 3:07:22.180]  Which is the home office the british government's research information and communications unit
[3:07:22.180 --> 3:07:30.020]  Which attempts to covertly engineer the thoughts of people by providing to support to bodies seen by the public as grass roots
[3:07:30.660 --> 3:07:36.180]  Organizations, so it's about all these committees that aren't actually officially government bodies
[3:07:36.740 --> 3:07:41.140]  They're just liaising with the government and then they've got their fingers in the pie of all these other
[3:07:42.180 --> 3:07:48.420]  Influencers cultural groups celebrities and people like that who they yet then used to propaganda as the public even more
[3:07:48.420 --> 3:07:51.220]  She also writes of another group
[3:07:52.260 --> 3:07:58.660]  The rapid response unit based in number 10 downing street and the counter disinformation cell
[3:07:59.380 --> 3:08:04.740]  Attached to the department for digital culture media and sport again. It's attached. It's not explicitly government
[3:08:04.740 --> 3:08:09.380]  Which means they can get away with doing more things, but they're basically telling the government what to do
[3:08:10.340 --> 3:08:14.020]  Both of which monitor social media and tackle fake news
[3:08:14.020 --> 3:08:22.020]  Including Doddsworth claims YouTube videos by doctors who contradict WHO guidance on cove it despite the fact that the WHO itself
[3:08:22.020 --> 3:08:26.740]  In its own advice contradicted itself on cove it innumerable times
[3:08:27.220 --> 3:08:35.140]  They said there was no human-to-human transmission of cove it on january 14th because the communist chinese government told them and we could trust them right
[3:08:35.940 --> 3:08:39.540]  So again, it's all these subgroups that aren't even government entities
[3:08:39.540 --> 3:08:45.060]  Slimy shadowy groups that have basically seized control of the government and you know that
[3:08:45.860 --> 3:08:52.820]  Because of what came out yesterday from what the prime minister Boris Johnson was saying at the start of this lockdown
[3:08:53.460 --> 3:08:58.900]  Which was the quote. This was october that this came out. Of course. He said it back in march
[3:09:00.020 --> 3:09:03.060]  But then it's just been released today publicly or yesterday
[3:09:04.100 --> 3:09:08.980]  He said I must say remember this is Boris Johnson at the start of the pandemic before lockdown
[3:09:08.980 --> 3:09:15.140]  I must say I've been slightly rocked by some of the data on cove it's totalities the median age of death
[3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:17.620]  is 82
[3:09:17.620 --> 3:09:24.260]  81 for men 85 for women. That's above life expectancy. So get cove it and live longer
[3:09:24.420 --> 3:09:31.220]  This is what dominant Cummings who was in number ten down in street says Boris Johnson said about the pandemic at its origin
[3:09:31.220 --> 3:09:38.500]  He said hardly anyone under 60 goes into hospital 4% and all of those virtually all survive
[3:09:38.980 --> 3:09:46.580]  And I no longer buy all this NHS overwhelmed stuff. I think we may need to recalibrate that's Boris Johnson
[3:09:47.540 --> 3:09:54.420]  Admitting that the lockdown strategy was a complete failure because the average age of death was 82 and above
[3:09:54.660 --> 3:09:58.980]  And when somebody did a freedom of information out request to the uk government
[3:09:58.980 --> 3:10:05.140]  They asked them the question. How many of these deaths in the official cove it death toll figure are the uk
[3:10:05.780 --> 3:10:10.260]  Of the uk or from cove it alone with no cove morbidities
[3:10:10.660 --> 3:10:16.580]  And they got an answer and it's still on the government official website office of national statistics. I'm looking at it right now
[3:10:17.620 --> 3:10:19.620]  the uk government admits
[3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:26.660]  8.9 percent of the cove it death toll died solely of cove it with no other cove morbidities
[3:10:26.660 --> 3:10:33.540]  So the official true death toll figure is less than one tenth of what they're telling the public it is
[3:10:33.860 --> 3:10:37.460]  So is there any surprise that people are still so terrified?
[3:10:37.700 --> 3:10:40.980]  They're still wearing masks even though they're not legally obliged to
[3:10:41.700 --> 3:10:45.140]  Is there any surprise that we had a poll last year last summer indeed?
[3:10:45.940 --> 3:10:47.940]  Which found that the average brit
[3:10:48.100 --> 3:10:54.660]  Thought coronavirus was 100 times more deadly than it actually is they thought six to seven percent of the population
[3:10:54.660 --> 3:10:58.980]  This was a year ago that died of cove it 19
[3:10:59.780 --> 3:11:02.740]  Again, it was not only a hundred times less. It was
[3:11:03.300 --> 3:11:09.540]  One tenth the official figure they told us was actually those who had died of cove it without any co-morbidities
[3:11:10.420 --> 3:11:15.780]  That's why people are still wearing masks. That's why they're still walking around with terrified looks on their faces
[3:11:16.100 --> 3:11:19.460]  And that's why they support vaccine passports
[3:11:19.460 --> 3:11:25.220]  Which are now going to expand into every area of society as we increasingly devolve into a
[3:11:25.700 --> 3:11:28.340]  communist chinese style social credit score
[3:11:28.900 --> 3:11:33.380]  Bio security police state and that's what i'm going to get into on the other side
[3:11:33.380 --> 3:11:39.700]  They're now saying people attend football matches people who want to go to nightclubs people who want to go to crowded venues
[3:11:39.700 --> 3:11:49.700]  It just keeps expanding further and further. This is summit news. We'll be back after the break. Don't go away
[3:11:53.060 --> 3:11:56.340]  Jacob in ohio welcome go ahead. Hey, how's it going alex?
[3:11:56.980 --> 3:12:00.820]  Great last caller. I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement
[3:12:01.220 --> 3:12:04.900]  It's basically the only way i get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting
[3:12:04.900 --> 3:12:10.900]  Moralization and absurdity. It's like we're living at a twilight zone and all right eric's in new hampshire eric

[3:12:44.500 --> 3:12:46.500]  absolutely
[3:12:49.860 --> 3:12:53.220]  As we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown
[3:12:53.620 --> 3:12:58.820]  The first one has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death
[3:12:58.820 --> 3:13:02.260]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world

[3:13:49.700 --> 3:13:55.540]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:14:03.060 --> 3:14:11.140]  Transmuting world wide from the summit dot new studios in the united kingdom. You are listening to pa
[3:14:11.540 --> 3:14:13.540]  joseph watson
[3:14:13.540 --> 3:14:19.140]  So in a bocker state of fear laura doddsworth documents how there are
[3:14:19.780 --> 3:14:24.260]  behavioral insight teams operating within at least 10 government departments again
[3:14:24.340 --> 3:14:28.500]  These aren't official government bodies. They're quasi government quasi private bodies
[3:14:29.380 --> 3:14:33.300]  who are tasked with manipulating and propagandizing the british public
[3:14:34.100 --> 3:14:38.100]  We also literally have the uk army the british army
[3:14:38.100 --> 3:14:46.740]  Which is only supposed to focus propaganda campaigns to foreign adversaries being turned inwards on the uk population
[3:14:47.060 --> 3:14:49.060]  at the start of this pandemic
[3:14:49.300 --> 3:14:52.740]  Again, this is out the article inside the fear factory out of the telegraph
[3:14:53.620 --> 3:14:55.620]  She says some people believe
[3:14:55.940 --> 3:15:02.980]  And oh you can believe it if you've seen the thread responses on twitter where it's the announcement of a new lockdown policy then below it
[3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:09.140]  Words for word different bot accounts copying the same copy-pasted thing where it says
[3:15:09.460 --> 3:15:13.620]  Oh, this isn't enough lockdown. We need more strict lockdowns. We need it for another year
[3:15:14.180 --> 3:15:22.180]  Exactly the same text to flood the comments to flood these twitter threads. It's bots doing it. China's done that for over a decade
[3:15:22.260 --> 3:15:24.260]  They literally hire millions of people
[3:15:25.060 --> 3:15:27.700]  to manipulate public opinion and to create fake
[3:15:27.700 --> 3:15:33.300]  Consensus on social media by amplifying chinese government propaganda narratives
[3:15:34.020 --> 3:15:40.580]  And now because apparently china's great and we're aping and mimicking everything they do because authoritarian tyranny is so cool now
[3:15:41.380 --> 3:15:43.380]  We get that done to us
[3:15:43.620 --> 3:15:49.060]  And it was the british military and these other behavioral insight groups who have infested our government
[3:15:49.380 --> 3:15:56.260]  That literally took that fake chinese propaganda of the video footage of people convulsing and collapsing on the street
[3:15:56.260 --> 3:16:02.340]  Before the lockdowns in the west were implemented again to terrify the public into going along with it
[3:16:02.820 --> 3:16:04.820]  Despite the fact we know they were completely faked
[3:16:05.380 --> 3:16:10.500]  Convulsing and collapsing and falling down on the street has never been a symptom of covid
[3:16:10.500 --> 3:16:13.060]  It wasn't then it isn't now it was completely faked
[3:16:13.060 --> 3:16:14.900]  It was a complete hoax
[3:16:14.900 --> 3:16:21.700]  Amplified by the media amplified by the likes of this 77th brigade, which is literally the british military
[3:16:21.700 --> 3:16:27.780]  Propagandizing its own people when it's supposed to be focusing its direction out to foreign adversaries
[3:16:28.180 --> 3:16:32.180]  So she says some people believe they've been targeted by the 77th brigade
[3:16:33.060 --> 3:16:35.060]  Part of the sixth division of the army
[3:16:35.220 --> 3:16:43.380]  But according to the ministry of defense uses quote legitimate non-military levers as a means to adapt behaviors of the opposing forces and adversaries
[3:16:43.940 --> 3:16:46.420]  When she inquired about the activities of some of these bodies
[3:16:46.820 --> 3:16:50.660]  She says I hit a brick wall and I find that when someone puts up a brick wall
[3:16:50.660 --> 3:16:53.700]  It's because that's where the real story lies
[3:16:54.660 --> 3:16:56.660]  now another one of these
[3:16:56.740 --> 3:17:02.500]  Behavioral insight weaponization of propaganda techniques was centered around the wearing of masks
[3:17:03.140 --> 3:17:10.980]  Just as you know at the start of the pandemic the WHO every major public health body in developed countries said masks
[3:17:11.460 --> 3:17:17.460]  Non-surgical masks, which is the one that's at the everyone's wearing still don't do anything to stop covid
[3:17:17.460 --> 3:17:22.900]  We've had the best part of the year in the united kingdom wearing these masks by law
[3:17:23.380 --> 3:17:27.060]  And the case numbers kept going up same thing in spain
[3:17:27.060 --> 3:17:34.900]  I was in spain last summer right after they mandated masks everywhere literally in 40 degree heat outside having to wear a mask
[3:17:35.540 --> 3:17:37.700]  And the police in spain aren't like the
[3:17:38.340 --> 3:17:45.220]  Benny hill bobbies that we have here in the uk. They're big butch tough guys and they will literally pin you down
[3:17:45.220 --> 3:17:50.900]  Uh and handcuff you we've seen that on many occasions literally people being beaten up for not wearing masks
[3:17:52.020 --> 3:17:59.620]  Again, it was all complete below any propaganda. Anthony Fauci in his own emails right back at the start of the pandemic in february
[3:18:00.500 --> 3:18:03.540]  Said the masks are completely useless
[3:18:04.260 --> 3:18:07.380]  Now we have another government advisor one who actually speaks some
[3:18:08.260 --> 3:18:09.540]  sense
[3:18:09.540 --> 3:18:11.540]  Going public yesterday
[3:18:11.540 --> 3:18:16.580]  And the headline is government advisor admits masks are just comfort blankets that do virtually nothing
[3:18:17.540 --> 3:18:21.540]  Making the point and this is dr. Collin axe and a sage advisor for the government
[3:18:22.580 --> 3:18:24.580]  One who actually wants to
[3:18:24.660 --> 3:18:31.940]  Get back to normal and not implement these mandates forever as the hardline communist susan mitchey has said over and over again
[3:18:32.900 --> 3:18:37.220]  He told the london telegraph that medics have given people a cartoonish view of how
[3:18:37.220 --> 3:18:44.900]  Microscopic viruses travel through the air and the masks have gaps in them that are up to 5 000 times bigger than
[3:18:45.300 --> 3:18:47.780]  Covid particles the particle is
[3:18:48.740 --> 3:18:54.180]  5 000 times smaller than the holes in the fabric of that mask they go straight through
[3:18:54.820 --> 3:18:58.740]  This is why it's completely cartoonish pantomime nonsense
[3:18:59.300 --> 3:19:01.300]  that people wear a mask
[3:19:01.780 --> 3:19:05.860]  For the five foot walk to their dinner table. They've been doing that for the past
[3:19:05.860 --> 3:19:10.580]  What seven months in here in the uk at least complete pantomime act
[3:19:11.220 --> 3:19:13.060]  He made the analogy
[3:19:13.060 --> 3:19:18.340]  He said the small sizes are not easily understood but an imperfect analogy would be to imagine marbles
[3:19:18.900 --> 3:19:24.900]  Fired at builders scaffolding. Some might hit a pole and rebound, but obviously most will fly through
[3:19:25.940 --> 3:19:29.460]  And these are the great protective devices that we've all been mandated to wear
[3:19:29.460 --> 3:19:35.780]  These have been used to create yet more division turmoil confrontations in society completely useless
[3:19:36.420 --> 3:19:43.460]  Fauci knew it from the start all these behavioral insight manipulators knew it from the start, but the decision was made
[3:19:44.660 --> 3:19:49.460]  Right when they introduced all these mask mandates after previously saying there was no point because they don't do anything
[3:19:50.100 --> 3:19:55.940]  This isn't about a medical response that's going to stop the spread of the transmission of the virus. This is about
[3:19:55.940 --> 3:20:04.420]  Now enforcing compliance via coercion and they literally said that in the same documents that I talked about previously
[3:20:05.060 --> 3:20:08.260]  In regard to the uk and these behavioral insight teams
[3:20:09.860 --> 3:20:16.020]  Goes on to say noting the mask debate is about the particle journey acts on explain that masks can catch droplets and
[3:20:16.180 --> 3:20:20.980]  Sputum from a cough, which is why people in hospitals wear them when they're doing medical procedures
[3:20:20.980 --> 3:20:29.220]  But they're wearing different masks entirely. But what's important is that SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly distributed by tiny aerosols
[3:20:29.860 --> 3:20:36.100]  So the COVID viral particle is around 100 nanometers material gaps in blue surgical masks
[3:20:36.180 --> 3:20:40.020]  Which is what most people wear are up to 1,000 times that size
[3:20:40.580 --> 3:20:42.420]  cloth mask gaps
[3:20:42.420 --> 3:20:44.100]  can be
[3:20:44.100 --> 3:20:46.100]  500,000 times the size
[3:20:46.100 --> 3:20:51.460]  So the holes in the masks of what a great majority of people walking around wearing thinking they're
[3:20:52.020 --> 3:20:55.540]  Protecting themselves and others and being a good person
[3:20:56.260 --> 3:21:05.620]  You idiot the holes in that stupid face nappy that you're wearing a 500,000 times bigger than the virus particle
[3:21:05.700 --> 3:21:08.660]  It's all pantomime. It's all nonsense
[3:21:10.340 --> 3:21:12.660]  As Fauci admitted in his own emails
[3:21:12.660 --> 3:21:19.540]  The professor noted that those aerosols escape masks and will render the mask ineffective. And yet still what do we have today?
[3:21:20.260 --> 3:21:26.660]  Zero hedge reports is this why a child doctors group suddenly demanded all kids over to wear masks at school
[3:21:27.380 --> 3:21:29.380]  Even though they're going to vaccinate them
[3:21:30.500 --> 3:21:36.260]  So as in case you wondered why the American Academy of Pediatricians would overall the CDC science consider this
[3:21:36.260 --> 3:21:43.460]  The American Academy of Pediatrics wants all kids masked until vaccinated. Let's go to their website and see who the biggest donor is
[3:21:43.780 --> 3:21:46.660]  Oh, look, it's Pfizer. Well, imagine my shock
[3:21:47.220 --> 3:21:53.860]  So they're demanding kids over the age of two years old wear the masks despite knowing that the masks are completely useless
[3:21:54.180 --> 3:21:57.220]  The virus particle is in the case of the cloth masks
[3:21:58.020 --> 3:22:02.580]  500,000 times smaller than the fabric the hole in the fabric in the mask
[3:22:02.580 --> 3:22:09.620]  It was never intended to stop the spread of covid. The one peer-reviewed study the one contemporary peer-reviewed study
[3:22:10.020 --> 3:22:15.700]  Into the efficacy of masks was the dan mask trial study in danmark. They took 6,000
[3:22:16.100 --> 3:22:23.220]  Participants they found that those who wore the mask and those didn't there was no statistical difference between those who got infected with
[3:22:23.220 --> 3:22:30.500]  covid and those who didn't based on wearing a mask and there's no study that exists that proves masks
[3:22:30.500 --> 3:22:35.860]  Work to any great degree. It was an exercise in coercing compliance
[3:22:36.100 --> 3:22:40.740]  Because they knew if they could get away with that then they can get away with the next stage
[3:22:40.740 --> 3:22:44.580]  Which is vaccine passports which I'll talk about in the next segment don't go away
[3:22:47.700 --> 3:22:52.580]  You know listeners calling to the show and they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:22:53.060 --> 3:22:58.980]  Because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer for financial support
[3:22:58.980 --> 3:23:04.580]  And for word of mouth and then we're all in together and I you know, it gets old having to come to you and say hey
[3:23:04.580 --> 3:23:06.980]  I got great products, please bomb or we won't be here on air
[3:23:06.980 --> 3:23:11.540]  But it's true for the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level
[3:23:12.020 --> 3:23:16.660]  That is not beholden to big corporate sponsors and they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else
[3:23:16.660 --> 3:23:22.100]  They crippled all the other groups and we're still here and as this whole new world order comes out in the open
[3:23:22.500 --> 3:23:26.420]  Our credibility is going up. That's why we've got to be taken off there. That's why America
[3:23:26.420 --> 3:23:31.380]  You've got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved and America still was I free
[3:23:31.780 --> 3:23:36.660]  You can't have info wars has been proven right be it on air with all the craziness that's about to unfold
[3:23:36.980 --> 3:23:41.460]  Because if you think stuff's bad now just get ready. So thank you all and get an info or store.com

[3:23:50.660 --> 3:23:52.660]  The globalists are having their revolution
[3:23:52.660 --> 3:23:58.580]  But for humanity has to have its revolution. We have to first recognize this anti-human
[3:23:59.140 --> 3:24:01.140]  Takeovers trying to
[3:24:01.940 --> 3:24:05.300]  enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[3:24:06.100 --> 3:24:08.580]  and turn us into these artificial corporate
[3:24:09.140 --> 3:24:11.140]  controlled
[3:24:11.380 --> 3:24:13.380]  slaves
[3:24:13.380 --> 3:24:17.300]  Orson slaves just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[3:24:17.300 --> 3:24:24.180]  Rendered down to be servile minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and satanic control
[3:24:24.580 --> 3:24:28.180]  We have to recognize the great reset post industrial world
[3:24:28.420 --> 3:24:31.620]  That realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[3:24:31.940 --> 3:24:33.940]  That is the opposite of their dystopia
[3:24:34.500 --> 3:24:37.620]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world
[3:24:38.580 --> 3:24:42.500]  And it's the only choice we've got freedom or slavery go to evil
[3:24:43.060 --> 3:24:45.460]  It is a spiritual battle an image of the world
[3:24:45.460 --> 3:24:48.820]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it

[3:26:48.260 --> 3:26:55.620]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:27:02.660 --> 3:27:08.100]  You're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:27:08.100 --> 3:27:16.980]  So australia from the very beginning was one of the most authoritarian draconian countries
[3:27:17.220 --> 3:27:20.420]  In the developed world when it came to enforcing these lockdowns
[3:27:20.580 --> 3:27:23.780]  In fact, I remember writing stories in the early months of the pandemic
[3:27:24.420 --> 3:27:27.940]  Where they would announce the lockdown on the news and then literally have
[3:27:28.580 --> 3:27:30.580]  police and security guards
[3:27:31.300 --> 3:27:36.180]  Standing outside apartment blocks to prevent people from leaving their own apartments
[3:27:36.180 --> 3:27:38.180]  We had an article and a video
[3:27:39.220 --> 3:27:41.060]  from australia
[3:27:41.060 --> 3:27:45.300]  Where a woman was arrested for the crime the egregious crime of
[3:27:45.860 --> 3:27:51.060]  Organizing an anti-law in fact, I don't even think she organized it. I think she just promoted it on facebook
[3:27:51.780 --> 3:28:00.100]  Pregnant woman the police in australia showed up to a house burst into a house and arrested her in front of her husband and her kids
[3:28:00.100 --> 3:28:08.660]  They passed laws in australia, which gave the government permission to seize remove children from the custody of their parents
[3:28:09.380 --> 3:28:12.020]  To ensure complaints with coronavirus rules
[3:28:13.060 --> 3:28:18.020]  They used surveillance drones to catch people who weren't wearing masks outside
[3:28:18.740 --> 3:28:22.900]  And to keep track of cars that travel further than five kilometers from home
[3:28:22.900 --> 3:28:29.780]  They gave themselves the power to enter people's homes without a warrant and perform spot checks
[3:28:30.900 --> 3:28:34.740]  We showcased another video. They see the pregnant woman being arrested
[3:28:35.780 --> 3:28:42.580]  It's always interesting by the way, I go back and I remember writing these articles this one from september last year
[3:28:42.580 --> 3:28:44.260]  So it's about 10 months old
[3:28:44.260 --> 3:28:51.140]  Go always go back to these articles and notice that the videos that were originally there have all been deleted on twitter
[3:28:51.140 --> 3:28:56.820]  Well, what a surprise either because they've made them delete the tweet or they've just suspended the account
[3:28:57.220 --> 3:29:02.660]  So I mean you can see the screenshot. You can't watch the actual videos in many cases because they get deleted
[3:29:03.460 --> 3:29:09.540]  The point is though, australia is the most recording most authoritarian country in the developed world to enforce these lockdowns
[3:29:10.420 --> 3:29:12.420]  And they're going for this disastrous
[3:29:13.700 --> 3:29:19.380]  Crazy insane policy of trying to achieve zero covid the same as new zealand
[3:29:19.380 --> 3:29:23.380]  Because they've got it better in terms of being able to close their borders
[3:29:23.460 --> 3:29:27.780]  But they think that by doing this they can just eliminate the virus altogether
[3:29:28.260 --> 3:29:32.660]  So whenever you get a single case of it a single case
[3:29:33.220 --> 3:29:36.180]  They all freak out and they put everyone under lockdown again
[3:29:36.500 --> 3:29:39.860]  Everyone in entire city under lockdown because of one case
[3:29:40.820 --> 3:29:42.820]  In fact, we highlighted it last month
[3:29:42.820 --> 3:29:49.140]  Alice springs a town in australia 800 miles away from the nearest city went into full lockdown
[3:29:49.300 --> 3:29:54.500]  After just a single new case of covid was detected one case
[3:29:55.140 --> 3:30:01.620]  The city is 800 miles away from any nearest other city and the entire city goes under lockdown
[3:30:01.860 --> 3:30:06.740]  Well, now it's gotten even worse for australians and this is really a new level of inhumanity
[3:30:07.460 --> 3:30:10.660]  Because the top health official in new south wales
[3:30:10.660 --> 3:30:13.300]  And we've got the clip which will roll here in a second
[3:30:14.020 --> 3:30:19.220]  Now says that australians shouldn't be having conversations with each other
[3:30:19.460 --> 3:30:25.060]  They're not just preventing them from meeting in bars restaurants theaters cinemas etc
[3:30:25.060 --> 3:30:30.580]  They're now literally telling people they can't talk to each other. This is the government in australia
[3:30:31.140 --> 3:30:33.460]  Chief health officer of new south wales
[3:30:33.940 --> 3:30:38.820]  They all look the same by the way this woman looks exactly the same as that communist hard line
[3:30:38.820 --> 3:30:43.540]  As susan mitchie. They all look like middle-aged caron women's with their masks on
[3:30:44.260 --> 3:30:49.540]  Well, she gave a press conference telling australians they shouldn't engage in conversation with each other
[3:30:49.940 --> 3:30:54.740]  Even if they're wearing the sainted masks and we have the clip here it is
[3:30:56.660 --> 3:31:01.140]  Whilst it isn't human nature to engage in conversation with others
[3:31:01.780 --> 3:31:03.780]  To be friendly
[3:31:03.780 --> 3:31:10.820]  Unfortunately, this is not the time to do that. So even if you run into your next door neighbour
[3:31:11.700 --> 3:31:18.260]  In the shopping center in the coals while you're at coals wars or aldi or any other grocery shop
[3:31:19.220 --> 3:31:21.220]  Don't start up a conversation
[3:31:21.460 --> 3:31:24.820]  Now is the time for minimizing your interactions with others
[3:31:25.460 --> 3:31:27.460]  Even if you've got a mask
[3:31:27.860 --> 3:31:32.100]  Do not think that affords total protection. We want to be absolutely sure
[3:31:32.100 --> 3:31:38.260]  That as we go about our daily lives, we do not come into contact with anyone else that would pose a risk
[3:31:40.740 --> 3:31:44.180]  So therefore everyone under a seven-day stay-at-home order
[3:31:44.500 --> 3:31:50.100]  They've made masks compulsory again in schools teachers students kids have all got to wear them
[3:31:50.340 --> 3:31:58.900]  And now they're literally giving press conferences telling australians not to have conversations with each other in the grocery store
[3:31:58.900 --> 3:32:02.340]  She talks about conversations being part of human nature
[3:32:02.660 --> 3:32:07.620]  The government telling you you can't have a conversation with your friends or your neighbours that's in humane
[3:32:07.780 --> 3:32:09.780]  That's completely inhumane
[3:32:10.100 --> 3:32:13.540]  We thought we couldn't scale any more plum any more depths in this
[3:32:14.260 --> 3:32:19.060]  Lockdown fiasco, but we've managed it today in australia. And where's the backlash?
[3:32:19.780 --> 3:32:25.540]  I mean when I think of australians, I think of you know crocodile dundee. I thought they were supposed to be big tough guys
[3:32:25.540 --> 3:32:32.420]  Where are the protests? Where's the resistance? There's more resistance in london. There's more resistance in greece
[3:32:32.820 --> 3:32:37.700]  There's even more resistance in france. What are australians doing? I thought they were tough
[3:32:38.500 --> 3:32:46.660]  They're just accepting it. They're literally accepting being told by some bureaucrat. They can't talk to their friend. That's insane
[3:32:49.140 --> 3:32:51.380]  And somebody commented in fact it was the um
[3:32:51.380 --> 3:32:55.220]  um, English pop group writes that fred it were big
[3:32:55.940 --> 3:32:58.660]  Lockdown skeptics and campaigners against lockdown
[3:32:59.300 --> 3:33:03.780]  Very interesting comment. They said quote the desperation is front and center
[3:33:04.020 --> 3:33:10.740]  They're either running out of time or they're going insane right in front of our eyes. And I think that sums it up
[3:33:11.460 --> 3:33:13.060]  perfectly
[3:33:13.060 --> 3:33:17.620]  Meanwhile in the uk on the day that freedom day was supposed to be happening
[3:33:17.620 --> 3:33:24.500]  We of course had the announcement that we would have to present vaccine passports to go about basic social
[3:33:25.140 --> 3:33:28.740]  Activities, we've seen this in greece. We've seen it in france as I mentioned before
[3:33:29.460 --> 3:33:34.100]  In france, of course, they had to backtrack somewhat now. They're saying that they're graciously
[3:33:34.420 --> 3:33:41.460]  Affording the citizenry in france the right to enter a supermarket without having been vaccinated. Yes for the moment
[3:33:41.540 --> 3:33:43.540]  They will let you eat
[3:33:43.540 --> 3:33:49.540]  And we see a similar situation developing in the uk the direction of travel is going from nightclubs
[3:33:49.940 --> 3:33:55.540]  Crowded venues and they're saying maybe pubs now. They're saying almost for sure football matches
[3:33:56.340 --> 3:34:00.340]  Unvaccinated football fans to be banned from matches in the uk
[3:34:01.140 --> 3:34:05.300]  Creating a two tier society of the jabbed and the jabbed not
[3:34:06.900 --> 3:34:12.340]  It's been reported that football clubs are likely to be told only supporters who can prove they've had the jab will be allowed to enter stadiums
[3:34:12.340 --> 3:34:18.980]  After the season starts later this summer daily mail reports plans being drawn up that will require football fans to prove
[3:34:18.980 --> 3:34:25.060]  They've had two doses of covid vaccination before they can attend matches from the end of september
[3:34:26.340 --> 3:34:29.700]  Says if the measures this is key because they put a provisor in
[3:34:30.100 --> 3:34:32.340]  Thinking that it's going to put people back to sleep
[3:34:32.820 --> 3:34:38.100]  Because if the measure is introduced government will be expected to fall back on the previous definition of large crowds
[3:34:38.100 --> 3:34:42.900]  A definition which they can change at any moment because because they've moved the goalpost on everything else
[3:34:43.940 --> 3:34:46.340]  Set out in step three of the roadmap out of lockdown
[3:34:46.660 --> 3:34:50.100]  Which was a capacity of 16 thousand spectators. However
[3:34:50.740 --> 3:34:56.580]  The legal requirement on football fans to be vaccinated before they can send games and negative covid tests would not be enough
[3:34:56.660 --> 3:34:58.660]  Oh, yeah, they've introduced that by the way
[3:34:59.380 --> 3:35:02.580]  See in france what they were doing is obtaining
[3:35:03.140 --> 3:35:05.380]  free covid tests from the government
[3:35:05.380 --> 3:35:11.940]  And you shouldn't even have to put yourself through that but they were using those free covid tests to avoid having to get the vaccine
[3:35:12.580 --> 3:35:16.660]  Friends banned that they got rid of that. They say now you need your own covid test
[3:35:17.060 --> 3:35:21.780]  Now the uk has gone one step further and said said you're not even allowed to prove
[3:35:22.420 --> 3:35:25.620]  You don't have covid you have to take the vaccine
[3:35:25.940 --> 3:35:33.140]  Despite the fact that there's a ton of people in hospital who took both jabs of the covid vaccine and then got covid because the vaccine works so well
[3:35:33.140 --> 3:35:40.340]  But it says these rules will only come into force if coronavirus infection rates deaths and hospitalizations are high
[3:35:41.380 --> 3:35:43.380]  Or there are dangerous variants
[3:35:44.260 --> 3:35:50.660]  Circulating and of course what the government calls dangerous variants or scariots as other people call them
[3:35:51.220 --> 3:35:56.020]  Will be circulating for years making that qualification rather redundant
[3:35:57.060 --> 3:36:02.340]  Now this is all being introduced despite the fact that the government's own events research program
[3:36:02.340 --> 3:36:04.340]  Where they had all these
[3:36:04.420 --> 3:36:12.100]  nightclub events outdoor sporting events to test whether coronavirus was very transmissible during these events
[3:36:13.380 --> 3:36:18.100]  They found quote that revealed few infections linked to outdoor sports events
[3:36:18.100 --> 3:36:20.580]  So the government's own test pilot program
[3:36:21.140 --> 3:36:27.780]  Found that this wasn't a super spreader event in any case Wimbledon tennis championships was won some of the euro
[3:36:28.340 --> 3:36:30.980]  2020 games were other pilot test events
[3:36:30.980 --> 3:36:37.380]  They found that they didn't spread the virus and yet they're still introducing the vaccine passports anyway
[3:36:37.780 --> 3:36:43.940]  Why are they doing that? We'll get into that and more on the other side of the break summit dot news dot go away
[3:36:44.180 --> 3:36:46.180]  We'll be right back

[3:40:01.540 --> 3:40:05.140]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting

[3:40:11.940 --> 3:40:16.580]  Go ahead. Hey alex. Thanks for taking my call if I could I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product
[3:40:16.900 --> 3:40:20.820]  The x2 who does wonders they recommend it to everybody you're on the fence about it

[3:40:26.580 --> 3:40:30.260]  Hey, alex. It's great to be on with you. It's an honor honor talk to you awesome
[3:40:30.260 --> 3:40:36.580]  Uh, so first thing I wanted to do is say I love the products alpha power even at 29
[3:40:36.660 --> 3:40:40.420]  If you ask my better half she loves it. All right, it helps in the bedroom
[3:40:40.580 --> 3:40:45.380]  So just number one for a few years. It definitely works. It's not a joke. Yeah, absolutely
[3:40:45.380 --> 3:40:55.620]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:41:03.940 --> 3:41:08.340]  You're listening to summit.news with paul joseph watson
[3:41:08.340 --> 3:41:10.340]  Are you
[3:41:13.620 --> 3:41:20.820]  So after months and months of claiming that they never had any plans to introduce a vaccine passport and having conducted their own
[3:41:20.900 --> 3:41:24.100]  Study and admitted that it would be discriminatory to do so
[3:41:24.740 --> 3:41:28.820]  The government yesterday announced that they would be introducing vaccine passports
[3:41:29.300 --> 3:41:36.100]  The unvaccinated would be banned from football matches nightclubs and other crowded events maybe even pubs in the future
[3:41:36.100 --> 3:41:41.860]  I might present a problem to them given that this country has at least one million illegal immigrants
[3:41:41.940 --> 3:41:47.460]  The vast majority of whom are not going to get vaccines or vaccine passports. That's another
[3:41:48.100 --> 3:41:53.060]  Spanner in the works that they may encounter at a later date, but we also have this headline
[3:41:54.020 --> 3:41:59.940]  Report vaccine passports now may be demanded for office workers. Oh, but it's not mandatory
[3:42:00.020 --> 3:42:03.060]  You just can't get a job without it, but it's not mandatory
[3:42:03.060 --> 3:42:08.660]  The british government has suggested that not only should so-called vaccine passports be used by clubs pubs and restaurants
[3:42:08.980 --> 3:42:13.940]  But also the office workers should be subject to the system in order to return to their jobs
[3:42:14.500 --> 3:42:21.060]  London telegraph reports department for health and social care has indicated that the past system should be adopted in everyday workplaces
[3:42:21.380 --> 3:42:25.860]  But again, it's not mandatory. You just can't feed your family without getting it
[3:42:27.140 --> 3:42:29.140]  good news here though
[3:42:29.140 --> 3:42:34.500]  nightclub owners say they'll refuse to enforce vaccine passports as a condition of entry
[3:42:35.300 --> 3:42:40.260]  This was asked yet another uk government minister refused to rule out vaccine passports for pubs
[3:42:40.820 --> 3:42:48.020]  But nightclub owners say the plan to impose the same rules on their venues is shambolic with some vowing to refuse to enforce it
[3:42:49.540 --> 3:42:54.180]  Michael kill chief executive of the nighttime industries association said quote
[3:42:54.180 --> 3:43:00.340]  The announcement from the prime minister that covid passports will be made mandatory for nightclubs in september comes after his health secretary
[3:43:00.900 --> 3:43:05.780]  Said only one week ago that they would not be compulsory. What an absolute shambles
[3:43:06.980 --> 3:43:10.580]  Says leaving aside the fact that this is yet another chaotic uten that will leave nightclubs
[3:43:10.580 --> 3:43:14.580]  Who have been planning for reopening for months will now have to make more changes to the way they operate
[3:43:14.580 --> 3:43:21.220]  This is still a bad idea. Oh, yeah, it's also completely unenforceable and impractical. Have you seen british nightclubs?
[3:43:21.220 --> 3:43:26.660]  Have you been to new castle or manchester on a saturday night and been trying to get into a nightclub?
[3:43:27.140 --> 3:43:30.660]  Yeah, it's bit of a free for all so good-looking force in that
[3:43:32.100 --> 3:43:36.820]  But peter mark's chief executive of nightclub operator rec home uk went further
[3:43:37.380 --> 3:43:42.980]  Saying his nightclubs won't be requiring people to be double jabbed or they won't have anyone in
[3:43:43.380 --> 3:43:48.100]  He said younger guests are 95 percent of our customers. They won't be fully vaccinated by september
[3:43:48.100 --> 3:43:51.620]  We won't be requiring them. Otherwise, we won't have anyone in that's the point
[3:43:51.700 --> 3:43:58.340]  These nightclubs have profit margins of about 15 percent if they don't if they lose 15 percent of their customers
[3:43:58.660 --> 3:44:00.500]  They're going out of business
[3:44:00.500 --> 3:44:06.260]  35 percent of 18 to 13 year olds 18 to 30 year olds in the uk haven't been vaccinated
[3:44:06.820 --> 3:44:08.820]  So they're going to go out of business
[3:44:08.820 --> 3:44:10.820]  of course the argument could be made that
[3:44:11.380 --> 3:44:13.940]  The government is merely making these threats
[3:44:13.940 --> 3:44:18.820]  To coerce young people into being vaccinated, which is what happened in israel
[3:44:19.380 --> 3:44:23.460]  And then when they introduced the vaccine passports to get into all these venues in israel
[3:44:23.940 --> 3:44:30.500]  It was never enforced. It was a complete joke. Oh, but then they had another variant and maybe they do have to start enforcing it
[3:44:30.980 --> 3:44:36.420]  But it's good to see that nightclub operators are saying they're just going to disobey completely and refuse although
[3:44:37.060 --> 3:44:39.140]  You know, we've heard that before and they didn't
[3:44:39.140 --> 3:44:43.700]  Andrew Lloyd Webber said he'd be arrested if he opened his theater
[3:44:44.820 --> 3:44:48.740]  He never followed through on that promise so that remains to be seen. I believe it when I see it
[3:44:49.700 --> 3:44:54.020]  Meanwhile local family restaurant becomes latest victim of lockdown as rich get richer
[3:44:54.580 --> 3:44:55.540]  This was a restaurant
[3:44:55.540 --> 3:45:00.900]  I used to go to about 15 years ago when I used to live up in sheffield called julios
[3:45:00.900 --> 3:45:08.900]  The only restaurant in the entire village and now it's closed down as a result of covet 19 as they announced on their facebook page
[3:45:10.340 --> 3:45:13.700]  Given that julios was the only restaurant in the area aside from pubs
[3:45:13.700 --> 3:45:19.380]  Which are also struggling its loss is sure to be keenly felt by the local community given that it had been a much loved gathering place
[3:45:19.380 --> 3:45:23.300]  For almost 20 years and this is just one story. This has happened
[3:45:24.020 --> 3:45:29.780]  10 percent of restaurants in the uk have closed down permanently and in fact, it's more than that
[3:45:29.780 --> 3:45:32.740]  Because they're including the numbers of the ones that have opened
[3:45:33.140 --> 3:45:37.780]  So it's probably more like 15 percent at least of restaurants in the uk have closed
[3:45:38.260 --> 3:45:43.060]  Not as a result of the pandemic because sweden kept kept its restaurants open
[3:45:43.060 --> 3:45:49.220]  Didn't it and didn't have as high a death toll as the uk it's because of the lockdown
[3:45:49.860 --> 3:45:53.060]  Casual dining venues fell by 19.4
[3:45:53.060 --> 3:46:00.420]  Another report found that almost 10,000 licensed premises in the uk including pubs clubs and restaurants had closed during 2020
[3:46:01.220 --> 3:46:04.980]  Meanwhile the combined wealth of the world's 10 richest men rose by
[3:46:06.180 --> 3:46:11.860]  540 billion jeff bezos of amazon is doing just fine. He sent himself into space today
[3:46:12.340 --> 3:46:18.820]  With some of the 86 billion that he made as a result of amazon shares soaring because of course
[3:46:18.820 --> 3:46:24.260]  Most of their smaller competition went out of business. Everyone was stuck at home. They couldn't go into shops
[3:46:24.740 --> 3:46:27.780]  They had to order from amazon the rich got richer
[3:46:28.580 --> 3:46:33.140]  Billionaires exploited the impact of lockdown to create a rigged economy according to oxfam
[3:46:33.700 --> 3:46:37.620]  Causing expanding wealth inequalities during the worst economic downturn in a century
[3:46:37.860 --> 3:46:43.060]  There were the record number of billionaires created in the uk even as small businesses went under a lockdown
[3:46:43.060 --> 3:46:49.620]  Saw 150 million people globally pushed into extreme poverty. You'd think the left would care about that, wouldn't you?
[3:46:49.620 --> 3:46:51.620]  They don't give a damn. They want more lockdown
[3:46:52.500 --> 3:46:58.020]  Let's shift gears now and go into this quick Nigel forage video because today we had
[3:46:58.980 --> 3:47:06.020]  430 illegal immigrants land on the southern english coast. This is out of Breitbart another record day in the english channel
[3:47:06.580 --> 3:47:09.620]  There's 430 illegals brought ashore on monday
[3:47:09.620 --> 3:47:12.580]  There's 430 illegals brought ashore on monday
[3:47:13.300 --> 3:47:20.500]  Says the boat crisis the boat migrant crisis in the english channel set yet another daily record with the british border force taking over
[3:47:20.900 --> 3:47:26.020]  430 illegal aliens ashore after they set sail from france. Of course, they get taxi service
[3:47:26.100 --> 3:47:29.540]  They get free food. They get pop in four star hotels, but we can't travel
[3:47:29.940 --> 3:47:33.780]  Here is Nigel forage talking about this issue. Let's go to the clip
[3:47:33.780 --> 3:47:38.500]  Very very few of these people would ever qualify as refugees
[3:47:39.060 --> 3:47:41.060]  And if it's so awful where they've come from
[3:47:41.700 --> 3:47:49.300]  Why on earth have they deserted the women and children there? As you can tell, I take a very very firm line on this
[3:47:49.300 --> 3:47:53.700]  I think we're being humiliated on the world stage. I really honestly do
[3:47:54.580 --> 3:48:00.580]  Pretty Patel has made a series of strong statements. They began back in the august of 2019
[3:48:00.580 --> 3:48:06.340]  She keeps telling us what she's going to do and nothing has changed. The problem is getting worse
[3:48:06.660 --> 3:48:12.180]  Four star hotels have been filled up all over the country. There are over 60 000 people
[3:48:12.580 --> 3:48:17.300]  Who have either failed their asylum claims or are waiting to be processed
[3:48:17.380 --> 3:48:21.140]  But even if and when in most cases they fail
[3:48:21.620 --> 3:48:28.180]  They will still remain in this country. It is coming at a massive cost to us massive financial cost to us
[3:48:28.180 --> 3:48:30.900]  I would suggest quite a big security risk
[3:48:31.300 --> 3:48:36.180]  As we just don't know who most of these young men are very few of them have ID papers
[3:48:36.180 --> 3:48:41.300]  It's a trick. Get rid of your passport and then you can't actually be returned anywhere
[3:48:41.620 --> 3:48:47.940]  And I'm going to follow this because as I say, I think in the space of the next few weeks
[3:48:48.180 --> 3:48:52.820]  This will become the biggest non-COVID story in this country
[3:48:52.820 --> 3:48:58.420]  This country, I think the numbers that are coming are about to explode
[3:48:59.860 --> 3:49:04.500]  So during this supposedly deadly pandemic, we've got hundreds of migrants arriving every day
[3:49:04.580 --> 3:49:12.660]  We've got them being given escorts taxi services by the British government given free food free money put up in free hotels at tax payer expense
[3:49:13.380 --> 3:49:18.500]  Meanwhile, if I want to come back from France or if I want to come back from Spain after visiting my parents
[3:49:18.500 --> 3:49:24.580]  Which I basically can't do. I haven't seen them since last year. I have to sell quarantine for two weeks
[3:49:24.660 --> 3:49:26.660]  Maybe I should just get on a dingy
[3:49:26.980 --> 3:49:31.780]  If I want to go to France and come back that way and then I'll be treated like absolute royalty
[3:49:32.340 --> 3:49:36.500]  Then of course you have the security issue. We saw the video of these migrants arriving just
[3:49:37.140 --> 3:49:42.660]  Screaming running off into the town in different directions. Half of them weren't even processed
[3:49:43.140 --> 3:49:44.980]  God knows who they are
[3:49:44.980 --> 3:49:51.620]  Gaddafi warned that ISIS would exploit this refugee wave to commit atrocities. That's precisely what happened
[3:49:52.420 --> 3:49:56.420]  Happened in the case of the Paris massacre where the majority of the terrorists
[3:49:57.620 --> 3:50:01.140]  Exploited this wave. They claimed to be refugees. They were let into the country
[3:50:01.300 --> 3:50:07.780]  Our own government rescued the Manchester Arena bomber as a refugee. You've had a spate of beheadings in France
[3:50:07.780 --> 3:50:15.700]  From where these migrants are coming from over the past two years of terrorists who again entered the country on a refugee wave
[3:50:16.020 --> 3:50:21.380]  And now some of them are all coming here, but I can't go to Spain to see my own parents
[3:50:22.500 --> 3:50:24.260]  Meanwhile
[3:50:24.260 --> 3:50:31.620]  Back in jolly old England, Sadiq Kahn says new statue of activist who beheaded white colonizers in front of their children
[3:50:32.020 --> 3:50:34.500]  reflects London's achievements and diversity
[3:50:34.500 --> 3:50:41.540]  This is a statue of John Chilwembe an anti-colonial activist awarded the decapitation of William Livingstone
[3:50:41.620 --> 3:50:46.660]  Very nice fellow in front of his children and then displayed his head on a pike
[3:50:47.300 --> 3:50:54.580]  Saying this is according to Sadiq Kahn that putting up a statue of this individual reflects London's achievements and diversity
[3:50:55.380 --> 3:50:57.380]  so basically
[3:50:57.380 --> 3:51:05.700]  Celebrating white European farmers who went over to Malawi in the early 1900s the people who decapitated them in front of their children
[3:51:06.020 --> 3:51:09.460]  And then put their heads on spikes during a church service afterwards
[3:51:10.100 --> 3:51:13.940]  Those are the people who we need to now celebrate
[3:51:15.540 --> 3:51:19.700]  That's going to wrap it up though again massive protests in London yesterday
[3:51:19.700 --> 3:51:25.700]  There's another protest on Saturday. It looks like it's going to be the biggest ever anti-lockdown protests
[3:51:25.700 --> 3:51:30.900]  I'll be there and encourage everyone else in London in the UK to be there as well
[3:51:30.900 --> 3:51:48.260]  That's going to wrap it up though for the summit dot news hour. Come on next war room with Owen Shroyer. Keep it locked in
