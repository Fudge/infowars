[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  It's Tuesday, January 10th, 2023.
[00:11.600 --> 00:17.360]  That's going to take some getting used to 2023.
[00:17.360 --> 00:23.640]  Well, we have another very powerful and formative broadcast lined up for you today, huge developments
[00:23.640 --> 00:24.640]  on so many fronts.
[00:24.640 --> 00:29.560]  Joe Biden's been caught in classified documents at his think tank, but he's not allowed to
[00:29.560 --> 00:34.200]  classify declassified documents like a president is.
[00:34.200 --> 00:37.000]  So Trump did nothing with classified documents.
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.040]  Obama did nothing with classified documents, not defending Obama.
[00:40.040 --> 00:41.040]  It's just true.
[00:41.040 --> 00:48.440]  But Biden committed serious felonies, but that's okay because it's 10% for the big guy.
[00:48.440 --> 00:53.480]  Then we have huge, huge developments on the poison, short front.
[00:53.480 --> 00:58.120]  We have massive coverage of the net zero will lead to the end of modern civilization, says
[00:58.120 --> 01:00.280]  top scientists.
[01:00.280 --> 01:04.120]  We've got the big moves now happening in Congress.
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.040]  McCarthy's been keeping some of his promises.
[01:06.040 --> 01:08.120]  We'll be tracking all that.
[01:08.120 --> 01:12.120]  We have Drew Hernandez joining us with big breaking news in the second hour, open phones
[01:12.120 --> 01:14.840]  today and so much more.
[01:14.840 --> 01:18.280]  But first, I want to bring you the very sad news.
[01:18.280 --> 01:24.720]  President Trump revealed last night that Lynette Hardaway, the diamond of diamond and silk,
[01:24.720 --> 01:25.720]  has died.
[01:25.720 --> 01:31.480]  I had a chance to be on their show before she became ill and stopped doing her show late
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.480]  last year.
[01:32.480 --> 01:33.480]  Here's a few minutes of that.
[01:33.480 --> 01:39.040]  And first thing I want to apologize to you, Mr. Alice Jones, because at the beginning
[01:39.040 --> 01:43.080]  of everything, one thing we didn't understand was the media, right?
[01:43.080 --> 01:44.080]  Okay.
[01:44.080 --> 01:46.760]  This is extremely dangerous to our democracy.
[01:46.760 --> 01:54.520]  The media put a lot of different nuggets and labels out there and they tell us what those
[01:54.520 --> 02:02.680]  labels mean and we tend to believe them because that's all we see or that's all we saw.
[02:02.680 --> 02:07.320]  But now as we go through this ourselves as diamond and silk or what's going through this
[02:07.320 --> 02:13.160]  ourselves as diamond and silk, and so how they begin to call us, what they were calling
[02:13.160 --> 02:21.320]  you and how they begin to censor us and it's like, whatever you say does not mean anything.
[02:21.320 --> 02:26.880]  You don't get it right to say it, we're like, wait a minute, something is wrong here.
[02:26.880 --> 02:29.160]  This is fake news.
[02:29.160 --> 02:31.440]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:31.440 --> 02:33.160]  They are nothing but distractions.
[02:33.160 --> 02:38.440]  So I want to first apologize for not even believing you at the beginning, but I want
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.480]  to recognize that Alice Jones was right.
[02:41.480 --> 02:42.480]  Yep.
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.480]  Alice Jones was right.
[02:43.480 --> 02:47.880]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, slip it up or rub it down.
[02:47.880 --> 02:49.760]  Alice Jones was right.
[02:49.760 --> 02:55.280]  A governmental corporate big tech coup is in control of the United States and works
[02:55.280 --> 03:02.000]  directly with the European Union and is absolutely completely criminal and illegal at every level
[03:02.000 --> 03:06.000]  and will be the enforcement for the social credit score that is the Mark of the Beast
[03:06.000 --> 03:07.000]  system.
[03:07.000 --> 03:10.560]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:10.560 --> 03:14.200]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:14.200 --> 03:17.320]  Alice Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[03:17.320 --> 03:20.120]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:20.120 --> 03:24.800]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:24.800 --> 03:30.400]  I came across this quote here and it says, when you tear out a man's tongue, you are
[03:30.400 --> 03:32.440]  not proving him a liar.
[03:32.440 --> 03:37.120]  You're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.
[03:37.120 --> 03:40.280]  I don't have to sit here and tell you it's coming anymore and show you documents like
[03:40.280 --> 03:41.280]  I used to.
[03:41.280 --> 03:42.280]  You're just going to live it now.
[03:42.280 --> 03:50.000]  And what we got to do as a country, as a people, is stop playing the games to the level, to
[03:50.000 --> 03:56.440]  this corporate media that they want us to play, be distracted and deflected from.
[03:56.440 --> 04:00.160]  And we have to go within and do our own research.
[04:00.160 --> 04:01.160]  That's right.
[04:01.160 --> 04:02.160]  Educate ourselves.
[04:02.160 --> 04:08.760]  Instead of looking at the rug and how pretty the rug may be, we need to lift up the rug,
[04:08.760 --> 04:14.800]  remove the rug, and see all the dirt underneath the rug so we can understand what's going
[04:14.800 --> 04:15.800]  on.
[04:15.800 --> 04:16.800]  Right.
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.240]  And what they do is they label and they say conspiracy theory and you get scared because
[04:21.240 --> 04:22.840]  oh, I don't want to be tied to that.
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.800]  Only to be called that when you can call out some stuff too, wait a minute.
[04:26.800 --> 04:30.320]  This is what could be happening over you asking questions.
[04:30.320 --> 04:32.760]  So we all know that Alex Jones was right.
[04:32.760 --> 04:34.920]  Nobody will take the credit for that.
[04:34.920 --> 04:36.240]  I didn't hear Ronald Reagan.
[04:36.240 --> 04:37.240]  I heard you.
[04:37.240 --> 04:38.240]  I heard you.
[04:38.240 --> 04:44.840]  And it was a whole bunch of things that we were perplexed by, but now we are like, oh
[04:44.840 --> 04:50.040]  my God, Alex Jones.
[04:50.040 --> 04:53.680]  We're living.
[04:53.680 --> 04:57.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back to the Special Live Tuesday broadcast.
[04:57.560 --> 04:59.360]  Stay with us.
[04:59.360 --> 05:15.360]  I have decided that all of you will take a special injection, so that you will be safe.
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.360]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[05:19.360 --> 05:28.360]  And so, I need all of you to stay indoors for the next 15 days to flatten the cans.
[05:28.360 --> 05:36.360]  I also need you to wear masks, and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[05:36.360 --> 05:42.360]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy.
[05:42.360 --> 05:46.360]  Leaving companies that only I own, profitable.
[05:46.360 --> 05:49.360]  You will then be my slave.
[05:49.360 --> 06:00.360]  And then you'll get that special shot of freedom from Cobra, who will move your immune system, so you'll be dependent on me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[06:19.360 --> 06:36.360]  It is federal law, because the executive is its own branch of government, and the president is the head of the executive branch.
[06:36.360 --> 06:45.360]  The president can declassify anything they want at any time, including even to enemies.
[06:45.360 --> 06:52.360]  That's how JFK declassified stuff to the Russians that let them know that we could blow them to kingdom come and had a far superior nuclear force.
[06:52.360 --> 06:55.360]  So they back down during the Bay of Pigs.
[06:55.360 --> 07:05.360]  President Trump argued in the last few years and said, those are my documents, and I've chosen to have them, and they're locked up in the secret services there.
[07:05.360 --> 07:10.360]  And there were things he was proud of, like the North Korea peace deal and the rest of it.
[07:10.360 --> 07:14.360]  They raided him.
[07:14.360 --> 07:16.360]  They criminally did that.
[07:16.360 --> 07:20.360]  Now we know Biden, who does not have declassification power.
[07:20.360 --> 07:30.360]  When he was vice president under Obama, had a giant horde of documents, and now the media is spinning it like it's okay.
[07:30.360 --> 07:37.360]  That, ladies and gentlemen, was and is illegal like everything else this criminal does.
[07:37.360 --> 07:42.360]  It's now time to start the impeachment hearings, and I've heard nothing out of McCarthy so far.
[07:42.360 --> 07:46.360]  Yeah, he's kicking deep state Democrats off committee chairmen ships.
[07:46.360 --> 07:50.360]  Yes, he's moving forward to get rid of the 86,000 new IRS agents.
[07:50.360 --> 07:56.360]  Yes, he's talking about looking at the Ukraine funding and he's doing a few things, but I want to hear about impeachment.
[07:56.360 --> 08:04.360]  There were big crowds of protesters down there when Biden was at the border for two hours on Sunday with their impeached Biden.
[08:04.360 --> 08:06.360]  That's what the people want.
[08:06.360 --> 08:07.360]  That's what the law states.
[08:07.360 --> 08:13.360]  He's committed all these crimes, do it, or the Republican leadership is aiding and abetting Biden.
[08:13.360 --> 08:21.360]  Biden documents how the discovery of classified material differs from Trump, and that's the hill trying to spin it.
[08:21.360 --> 08:27.360]  The White House on Monday disclosed that lawyers for President Biden discovered what they called a small number to classify documents.
[08:27.360 --> 08:34.360]  In November, in an office Biden had used between his time serving as vice president and president at a think tank.
[08:34.360 --> 08:37.360]  The documents returned over the next day of the National Archives.
[08:37.360 --> 08:39.360]  So, oh, he turned them over so it's okay.
[08:39.360 --> 08:46.360]  And the White House said it's cooperating with the Department of Justice and it conducts a review of the documents.
[08:46.360 --> 08:47.360]  It's cut and dry.
[08:47.360 --> 08:51.360]  Vice presidents do not have declassification power.
[08:51.360 --> 08:52.360]  This is a fraud.
[08:52.360 --> 08:58.360]  McCarthy Biden document discovery is proof Dems overplayed their hand.
[08:58.360 --> 09:04.360]  Classified docs from Biden's time as VP discovered in UPenn office.
[09:04.360 --> 09:12.360]  U.S. Attorney reviewing documents marked classified from Joe Biden's vice presidency found in Biden think tank.
[09:12.360 --> 09:15.360]  And it goes on and on from there.
[09:15.360 --> 09:16.360]  But again, look it up yourself.
[09:16.360 --> 09:20.360]  Vice presidents do not have declassification power.
[09:20.360 --> 09:23.360]  Only once you're sworn as the president do you have that.
[09:23.360 --> 09:30.360]  But here's a few clips from the past and present where Biden said it was irresponsible for Trump to keep classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.
[09:30.360 --> 09:31.360]  Here it is.
[09:31.360 --> 09:42.360]  When you saw the photograph of the top secret documents laid out on the floor at Mar-a-Lago, what did you think to yourself, looking at that image?
[09:42.360 --> 09:46.360]  How that could possibly happen.
[09:46.360 --> 09:49.360]  How anyone could be that irresponsible.
[09:49.360 --> 09:54.360]  And I thought what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods.
[09:54.360 --> 09:58.360]  By that I mean names of people who helped or etc.
[09:58.360 --> 10:02.360]  And it's just totally irresponsible.
[10:02.360 --> 10:05.360]  And you don't know what was in those documents.
[10:05.360 --> 10:16.360]  I have not asked for the specifics of those documents because I don't want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the just department should move or not move on certain actions they can take.
[10:16.360 --> 10:25.360]  I agree that I would not tell them what to do and not in fact engage in telling them how to prosecute or not.
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.360]  When we come back, a surprising answer to the question of whether President Biden will...
[10:31.360 --> 10:40.360]  Three sources tell CBS News the classified documents were discovered in this building about a mile from the White House at the offices of the Penn-Biden Center.
[10:40.360 --> 10:45.360]  A foreign policy research institute set up after President Biden left the vice presidency.
[10:45.360 --> 10:54.360]  According to a source familiar with the matter, the classified documents are small in number and were found in November in a box among unclassified material.
[10:54.360 --> 10:58.360]  Sources would not characterize how sensitive the documents are.
[10:58.360 --> 11:06.360]  Responding to requests from CBS News, the White House Council said that on November 2nd of last year, before the midterm elections,
[11:06.360 --> 11:10.360]  lawyers for President Biden were cleaning out office space at the center.
[11:10.360 --> 11:17.360]  When they discovered the documents marked classified in a locked closet, they stopped the work and contacted the White House.
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.360]  White House lawyers then reached out to the National Archives, which is responsible for the records.
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.360]  The archives in turn contacted the Department of Justice.
[11:26.360 --> 11:32.360]  Attorney General Merrick Garland then tasked the U.S. Attorney in Chicago, John Loush, a Trump appointee,
[11:32.360 --> 11:37.360]  with determining what is in the documents and how they arrived at the Penn-Biden Center.
[11:37.360 --> 11:43.360]  The FBI is also involved in the preliminary inquiry, which a source says is nearing its conclusion.
[11:55.360 --> 12:02.360]  It's Biden in Mexico. They drag the reporters out. They say, what are you going to do about the classified documents?
[12:02.360 --> 12:09.360]  The media fetishizes the intelligence agencies. They're just sprawling criminal interfaces to the globalists
[12:09.360 --> 12:14.360]  that rob and surveil and censor the American people and others.
[12:14.360 --> 12:20.360]  And they fetishize, ooh, secret documents, oh, you'll get in trouble, only the National Archives can have this.
[12:20.360 --> 12:22.360]  It's a bureaucratic power grab.
[12:22.360 --> 12:30.360]  But regardless, when we pull back at Twitter from the files that have come out and at Facebook and the other big tech companies,
[12:30.360 --> 12:42.360]  they put CIA, FBI and other intelligence agency groups inside of those organizations spying and surveilling the American people.
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.360]  It's all come out. And it's completely illegal.
[12:46.360 --> 12:53.360]  They gave, it turns out, highest-level top-secret security clearances to executives at Twitter,
[12:53.360 --> 12:55.360]  and now we're learning all the other groups as well,
[12:55.360 --> 13:02.360]  to have access to all these treasure troves of government data on you and I and all the rest of us.
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.360]  So this is just an orgy of criminal activity completely out of control.
[13:07.360 --> 13:13.360]  The government is a consortium of corrupt corporations out of control bureaucrats.
[13:13.360 --> 13:15.360]  Everybody pretending to be James Bond.
[13:15.360 --> 13:21.360]  And really what they are is a bunch of criminals that are stalking us and defrauding us and just raping the hell out of us.
[13:21.360 --> 13:29.360]  They are a new permanent ruling class that passed the public around like $2 horse.
[13:29.360 --> 13:32.360]  And it's got to stop.
[13:32.360 --> 13:38.360]  This country has political, cultural, spiritual cancer, and it knows we're waking up to the corruption.
[13:38.360 --> 13:43.360]  So it's trying to normalize pedophilia and everything else in a hope that as it comes out,
[13:43.360 --> 13:46.360]  we just accept it because they have seared our conscience.
[13:46.360 --> 13:48.360]  That is not happening.
[13:48.360 --> 13:54.360]  Now, coming up, ladies and gentlemen, we've got so much today.
[13:54.360 --> 14:02.360]  We're going to drill into the control grid, the castle of society, cutting off the carbon, the biggest developments yet.
[14:02.360 --> 14:08.360]  Biden is set to announce a ban on all gas-powered stoves.
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.360]  Next it will be gas-powered generators, gas-powered vehicles.
[14:12.360 --> 14:17.360]  Natural gas is the cleanest thing out there.
[14:17.360 --> 14:24.360]  All it puts off is a tiny bit of carbon dioxide, but they've listed that as a poison.
[14:24.360 --> 14:26.360]  And so they want to ban that.
[14:26.360 --> 14:29.360]  They want to ban our industry, ban our infrastructure.
[14:29.360 --> 14:30.360]  First it's the oil.
[14:30.360 --> 14:32.360]  Now it's the gas.
[14:32.360 --> 14:35.360]  They mean business, but people are fighting back.
[14:35.360 --> 14:38.360]  That's just one article in these three stacks on that front.
[14:38.360 --> 14:41.360]  Yuval Harari has come out and said, you will give up your body.
[14:41.360 --> 14:43.360]  We're going to force you into a matrix pod.
[14:43.360 --> 14:47.360]  He actually announced that.
[14:47.360 --> 14:48.360]  Told you.
[14:48.360 --> 14:56.360]  Lady classified in the year 2000, Federation of American Scientists, a 1977 DARPA Pentagon plan to end war.
[14:56.360 --> 15:03.360]  They said babies will be born in artificial looms and then will be put in pods that are fed by robots.
[15:03.360 --> 15:12.360]  And then the heat of the humans will then power the robots and you'll be in a virtual reality and there'll be no crime or no war because the supercomputer will control it.
[15:12.360 --> 15:14.360]  You think, well, that's insane.
[15:14.360 --> 15:15.360]  Really?
[15:15.360 --> 15:17.360]  This is their real plan, people.
[15:17.360 --> 15:23.360]  He says you will be forced into the metaverse and you will be forced into a pod.
[15:23.360 --> 15:25.360]  That is their plan.
[15:25.360 --> 15:35.360]  That's where it ends, where they can totally control reality and then try to manipulate through the third dimension, through the higher dimensions in your mind and try to trick you into choosing Satan.
[15:35.360 --> 15:51.360]  So when you see like Hollywood and all the virtual reality and you see Times Square being bombarded with all the fake info, they want total pods from birth to try to manipulate your entire reality in this hellscape to control the future.
[15:51.360 --> 15:53.360]  That's their plan, not mine.
[15:53.360 --> 15:55.360]  You see them trying to build it now.
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.360]  First read about that in my book, Descent and the Tyranny in 2002.
[15:59.360 --> 16:02.360]  They want the planet for themselves, my friends.
[16:02.360 --> 16:05.360]  If we're so stupid, we let them kill us.
[16:05.360 --> 16:13.360]  We deserve it, except children don't deserve it, do they?
[16:13.360 --> 16:33.360]  And I looked and behold, a pale horse and he that sat on the horse was named Death.
[16:33.360 --> 16:43.360]  The translation is, I looked and behold, a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and hell followed with him.
[16:43.360 --> 16:46.360]  The book of Revelation.
[16:46.360 --> 16:48.360]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[16:48.360 --> 16:50.360]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[16:50.360 --> 16:52.360]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[16:52.360 --> 16:54.360]  This is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[16:54.360 --> 16:56.360]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[16:56.360 --> 17:00.360]  They're very upset that they're losing and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[17:00.360 --> 17:04.360]  Remember two words. Info Wars Platinum.
[17:04.360 --> 17:08.360]  In the history of Info Wars supplements and they're amazing.

[17:15.360 --> 17:23.360]  Now all three of these are private labels of three national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company that also makes high-end supplements.
[17:23.360 --> 17:25.360]  And the owner's a listener and a supporter.

[20:00.360 --> 20:11.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.360 --> 20:30.360]  Welcome back, my friends. Guess what leaked last night? We'll be covering it coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[20:30.360 --> 20:43.360]  It's important information. It's really the Bilderberg Group, operating as the Debo's Group, and they don't want you to know what corporations, political leaders and others, military leaders are there,
[20:43.360 --> 21:01.360]  we've gotten the Debo's Group Annual Meeting internal leak of who's really there, and they are going to be and are very upset about this information coming out.
[21:01.360 --> 21:21.360]  So we're going to be covering all of this coming up in the last segment of this hour. Exclusive, The dossier acquires confidential Debo's attendee lists, The dossier being that publication.
[21:21.360 --> 21:48.360]  We're going to be looking at it in great detail. Zelensky to speak at World Economic Forum alongside NATO Chief, CNN Anchor, and we have the confidential list right here that's coming up at the end of this hour today.
[21:48.360 --> 21:58.360]  Lynette Hardaway, the Diamond of Diamond and Silk has died. Turns out I was on one of her last shows before she fell ill and was unable to broadcast.
[21:58.360 --> 22:09.360]  The last few months since she's now dead, she'll be sorely missed. She is survived by Silk. I'm going to get her on the show and our condolences.
[22:09.360 --> 22:18.360]  Go out to the family. You know, our own Chris Andrews two weeks ago died here of a heart attack at 39 with no health problems.
[22:18.360 --> 22:24.360]  Just fell down and died on Christmas Day.
[22:24.360 --> 22:39.360]  And you look at the actuaries, the insurance company numbers all over the western world, and we have record death since the introduction of the shots. But I don't know if Diamond took the shot. I know Chris Andrews didn't.
[22:39.360 --> 22:55.360]  Diamond alone does attack the heart. Those that take the shots have a three to ten fold bad reaction compared to even what the spike protein in the virus itself causes. But the so-called vaccines make your body produce the spike protein.
[22:55.360 --> 23:10.360]  You know, it's killing people in mass. I have a whole stack of stories on that front, including a nine-year-old girl playing flag football with no health problems dropping dead on the field.
[23:10.360 --> 23:34.360]  We also learned more about the hero customer who shot armed robber at Houston taco joint ordered to face grand jury by Soros funded DA. And it gets worse. The man he shot had multiple armed robbery convictions and had been let out of prison when he was part of a three-man team that robbed a cell phone store
[23:34.360 --> 24:03.360]  and shot the cell phone employee manager to death just a few years ago. So when you're part of a three-man team robbing and shooting someone for money at the cell phone shop, you get let out to go terrorize people again and the Soros DA wants the hero put in prison.
[24:03.360 --> 24:22.360]  This is the same hijacked government that hired 86,000 IRS agents in their own words to target people making $40,000 a year and below, even though they only pay a fraction of taxes to harass and drive working class people into bankruptcy.
[24:22.360 --> 24:42.360]  Villains, villains, villains, villains, villains. And think of the power with thousands of jurisdictions. Almost every major city has DAs and district attorneys and county attorneys put in office with George Soros money so this can all be carried out.
[24:42.360 --> 24:55.360]  And they got the judges in their pockets in many cases too. Not all of them, but in the key jurisdictions. The judge that railroaded me right here in Austin found me guilty and then rigged that whole fake trial.
[24:55.360 --> 25:10.360]  Guilty until proven guiltier on the Soros financial payroll on record. It's funny to them. That's how you rule a country. That's how you dominate. That's how you carry the Siebel out.
[25:10.360 --> 25:20.360]  But when we come back, I want to hit the really big news and that's the carbon taxes. Now they're already being implemented here in America and what it's going to do if we don't stop them? That's coming up.
[25:20.360 --> 25:40.360]  Net zero will lead to the end of modern civilizations as top scientists in a major study. We're going to look at that and then tie it into by administration ways nationwide ban on gas stoves as just a beginning. It all ties together with you've all know a Harari and his new chilling statements.
[25:40.360 --> 25:54.360]  Like two segments. Really cover this properly, but I also as I said, you need to get into the Davos documents leaking that are simply put bone chilling.
[25:54.360 --> 26:10.360]  Let me talk about this. Today is the last day to get DNA force plus and vitamin mineral fusion that are so essential for your telomeres so essential for your DNA, your mitochondria, the guts of yourselves with the PQQ and the CoQ 10.
[26:10.360 --> 26:20.360]  That's DNA force plus with all these other key compounds that are proven to actually help your telomeres last longer. They don't make your DNA strands grow. They slow.
[26:20.360 --> 26:39.360]  Massively, they're decline. DNA force plus is the world's Royce of quality product for your immune system and beyond and health and longevity. It is 50% off today is the last day to get 50% off on that because it will sell out the next week.
[26:39.360 --> 26:54.360]  Current sales prices. It goes back to regular price tomorrow. And of course, vitamin mineral fusion, all the essential vitamins, all the essential minerals and key cofactors and amino acids to supercharge your body's overall health and your immune system as well.
[26:54.360 --> 27:08.360]  It tastes great. One little scoop per pitcher. Stir it up. Leave it in your refrigerator. Have a glass of the morning or the evening or twice a day. Great for adults, old people, children, you name it, but particularly folks that don't absorb vitamin D3 as much like black folks and others.
[27:08.360 --> 27:25.360]  Look it up. You don't get as much sunshine. Your body doesn't get as much vitamin D. You particularly need vitamin mineral fusion. It's 50% off at infowarstore.com, 50% off at infowarstore.com.
[27:25.360 --> 27:39.360]  And it came in about three and a half weeks ago. Been sold out for over two years. The real Red Pill Plus. Finally back in stock, but we only had the budget to get a moderate amount of it. So at current sales rates, it's going to sell out in the next two weeks.
[27:39.360 --> 27:56.360]  Despite that, this is as close as the Matrix Red Pill, as you're going to find. We're keeping it at 50% off because I want you to experience it. I want you to try it. And ladies and gentlemen, we need the funds to be able to stay on air.
[27:56.360 --> 28:09.360]  So take advantage of this. You're going to love it. The preglonone alone is amazing because everybody produces it in your body. As you get older, you produce less. And the endocrine disruptors and mimickers block it in the body.
[28:09.360 --> 28:20.360]  So when you take high quality preglonone, it helps your body produce the normal amount of hormones you're supposed to have. So instead of hormone supplementation, a lot of folks take preglonone and helps your body produce it naturally.
[28:20.360 --> 28:32.360]  With all the trace elements, vitamins and minerals, and other key cofactors, and some healthy green tea extract and other things in there like your momate, it's got everything you need.
[28:32.360 --> 28:46.360]  Instant results with energy that takes a few weeks for the preglonone and other things to kick in for all the other great results. So get your real Red Pill today, exclusively at infowarstore.com for 50% off and help keep this broadcast on the air.

[29:59.360 --> 30:12.360]  There's a war against our masculinity. There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be.
[30:12.360 --> 30:25.360]  But through Mother Nature, the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done. And I got to tell you, all our supplements are great, but we've got a real game changer now.
[30:25.360 --> 30:34.360]  We've never put anything out this powerful. It's InfoWars Platinum. Now exclusively available at 40% off at infowarstore.com.

[30:59.360 --> 31:07.360]  Why does the establishment spend so much time demonizing InfoWars, attacking myself and the crew and our other hosts?
[31:07.360 --> 31:17.360]  Because they know we're pro-human. They know we're telling the truth. They know we've got their number. They know everything we do is about empowering humanity.
[31:17.360 --> 31:25.360]  And God gave us through Mother Nature incredible compounds that will supercharge our body's stamina, libido, energy, and immune systems.
[31:25.360 --> 31:37.360]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus that has all the documented compounds like preglonone and so much more to supercharge your body.

[31:59.360 --> 32:05.360]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow Info Warriors here in the United States and around the world.
[32:05.360 --> 32:15.360]  We are so excited to announce InfoWars MD. It turns out the top company in the U.S. for supplements is owned by a patriot.
[32:15.360 --> 32:22.360]  And it turns out they're willing to give us deals that no one else is getting because they want to support InfoWars and keep us on the air.
[32:22.360 --> 32:26.360]  This deal has been a year in the making and finally the products are being brought to market.

[33:24.360 --> 33:33.360]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[33:33.360 --> 33:39.360]  And we have returned ladies and gentlemen. All right.
[33:39.360 --> 33:44.360]  The globalists want to post industrial world. They signed a UN World Government Treaty in 1992.
[33:44.360 --> 34:01.360]  It's in a 20-20. It's in a 21. And then now they're going for a 20-30, which their minions are telling you, whether it's Greta Thunberg or AOC or Beto O'Rourke or the UN or Klaus Schwab, the world's going to end as you know it in 20-30.
[34:01.360 --> 34:05.360]  And you'll own nothing and have nothing and be happy.
[34:05.360 --> 34:16.360]  And they're systematically claiming they're replacing your stoves and your cars and the coal plants and everything else in your farms with sustainable things.
[34:16.360 --> 34:23.360]  And they're saying organic farming is not sustainable. Only chemical farming and warehouses run by Bill Gates is.
[34:23.360 --> 34:26.360]  And he's the biggest farm owner now in the United States.
[34:26.360 --> 34:35.360]  And the number three food producer in the world, the Netherlands, Holland, they've announced that by 20-30 they're going to shut down 90% of the production.
[34:35.360 --> 34:40.360]  This year they're shutting down 30%. Calfarts are bad.
[34:40.360 --> 34:55.360]  No, they make up the atmosphere. It gives them the pseudoscience excuse to take control of everything and make you go on to the replacement industries are setting up that by every study and every actuary and every analysis don't work.
[34:55.360 --> 35:02.360]  Well, of course they don't work. Spain was the first to put in windmills and cut off their power plants 10 years ago.
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.360]  They have 50% unemployment below the age of 30. The country is gone.
[35:07.360 --> 35:10.360]  That's how the communists and socialists create artificial famines.
[35:10.360 --> 35:15.360]  So here's the headline from DailySkeptic, it's up on infowars.com. You should read the article.
[35:15.360 --> 35:27.360]  NetZero will lead to the end of modern civilization, says top scientist. A damning indictment of the NetZero political project has been made by the world's leading nuclear physicist.
[35:27.360 --> 35:35.360]  In a published paper in Science, Dr. Wallace Mannheimer said it would be the end of modern civilization.
[35:35.360 --> 35:44.360]  Writing about wind and solar power, he argued it would be especially tragic when not only will this new infrastructure fail but will cost trillions.
[35:44.360 --> 35:51.360]  Trash large portions of the environment and be entirely unnecessary. The stakes he added are enormous.
[35:51.360 --> 35:57.360]  But it is necessary to cause the collapse of civilization.
[35:57.360 --> 36:03.360]  Spend some time, go to infowars.com, read the article and then read his paper.
[36:03.360 --> 36:07.360]  It's very important. In fact, guys, I meant to print the paper I scanned over it last night.
[36:07.360 --> 36:10.360]  Will you please print me the paper? Thank you.
[36:10.360 --> 36:25.360]  Now, let's move on. Biden administration weighs a nationwide ban on gas stoves, saying they're toxic and produce poison gas like carbon dioxide that plants breathe and that is not poison.
[36:25.360 --> 36:40.360]  And they say, and it also puts off some, not carbon dioxide, but carbon monoxide. Yes, microscopic amounts that cause no problems. But they don't care about that.
[36:40.360 --> 36:49.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, if a jet engine, when you're on an airplane that turns the engines on and you smell the carbon monoxide, it gives you a little bit of a headache.
[36:49.360 --> 36:59.360]  They've got studies out that that is millions of times the carbon monoxide you're breathing. It's still just a trace amount, but enough to hurt you some, give you a headache, intoxicate you.
[36:59.360 --> 37:18.360]  It's a poison. Millions of times the amount of carbon monoxide when you're in a jet waiting for it to take off that gets into the cockpit, then what comes off gas burning stove, burning natural gas, burning propane.
[37:18.360 --> 37:25.360]  Now, there's things like butane and things that are cheaper that aren't as refined that let off a little bit of bad stuff.
[37:25.360 --> 37:37.360]  But that's so easy for them to then ban space heaters saying they're toxic as Europe has done or San Francisco last month banning all fireplaces saying the woods putting off carbon monoxide.
[37:37.360 --> 37:47.360]  And yeah, if you sat in a small room that was sealed with a fire going, it would produce enough carbon oxide to give you a headache.
[37:47.360 --> 37:53.360]  But it's going up the chimney into the atmosphere and it's part of the gases that form the planet's atmosphere.
[37:53.360 --> 38:03.360]  They know that when there's big fires and big forest burn down, it energizes the atmosphere creates potash and creates more rain and puts nitrogen into the soil.
[38:03.360 --> 38:10.360]  They are limiting and demonizing and listing natural things that are part of our environment is toxic.
[38:10.360 --> 38:23.360]  A volcano puts out not trillions, but quadrillions more carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and all the rest of it.
[38:23.360 --> 38:27.360]  Then all human activity for multiple years.
[38:27.360 --> 38:30.360]  There's different studies on top of volcano, different ones put out more.
[38:30.360 --> 38:38.360]  But when Mount St. Helens blew up in that one eruption, they estimated put out more carbon than humans would put out in the next decade.
[38:38.360 --> 38:41.360]  One volcano.
[38:41.360 --> 38:43.360]  Look it up.
[38:43.360 --> 38:48.360]  One big volcano can lower the earth's temperature for up to a decade.
[38:48.360 --> 38:51.360]  It puts so much particular into the sky.
[38:51.360 --> 38:53.360]  Are they going to ban volcanoes?
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.360]  They don't have the power to do it.
[38:55.360 --> 39:01.360]  The sun, if you lay out in July, all day long in the sun, you make a heat exposure and die.
[39:01.360 --> 39:05.360]  Doesn't mean we shouldn't ever get sun.
[39:05.360 --> 39:12.360]  But here comes the Biden administration is weighing, they say it's on the table, a total ban of all gas stoves.
[39:12.360 --> 39:17.360]  Bang their sail and then banning the gas that you actually get for them.
[39:17.360 --> 39:20.360]  When so many people live in rural areas, can't get electricity.
[39:20.360 --> 39:24.360]  And any chef will tell you, you don't want to cook an electric stove, they suck.
[39:24.360 --> 39:25.360]  They are horrible.
[39:25.360 --> 39:29.360]  Flame is the way to go for everything you cook.
[39:29.360 --> 39:31.360]  And where's the electricity coming from?
[39:31.360 --> 39:34.360]  They're cutting off the coal power plants that were supplying 90% of the energy.
[39:34.360 --> 39:40.360]  Now they're saying in California during power outages, don't charge your electric car because there's not enough power.
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.360]  They're deliberately cutting off the power.
[39:44.360 --> 39:50.360]  Fox News, gas stove ban on the table for federal agency.
[39:50.360 --> 39:53.360]  The Product Safety Commission.
[39:53.360 --> 40:03.360]  The test of this was Prop 65 15 years ago in California, where they listed levels of lead, mercury, arsenic and things that can be in food or products.
[40:03.360 --> 40:17.360]  At 100 times what the European Union standards are, massively bigger than the US government standards, where there is more lead in the air than can be in an apple that you eat.
[40:17.360 --> 40:25.360]  But because a powerful spectrometer can pick it up, they have to then list it as toxic.
[40:25.360 --> 40:33.360]  While they pump deadly vaccines into us full of all sorts of poisons and won't even tell us on the insert what's in them and say it's classified.
[40:33.360 --> 40:40.360]  But you walk into business in California, it says over the door, this building contains things that violate Prop 65.
[40:40.360 --> 40:41.360]  It's simple.
[40:41.360 --> 40:49.360]  They list everything as illegal, everything is toxic, everything is bad, but then give their own corporations and companies and groups waivers.
[40:49.360 --> 40:54.360]  They don't let you have domestic flight travel.
[40:54.360 --> 40:56.360]  Pains moving to do it.
[40:56.360 --> 41:01.360]  France just set it to ban all domestic internal travel.
[41:01.360 --> 41:05.360]  By next year they've already banned most short flights this year.
[41:05.360 --> 41:09.360]  They say take the train to the car, then they're going to cut those off as well.
[41:09.360 --> 41:16.360]  But the elites can fly around on their private jets all day long and it goes on from there.
[41:16.360 --> 41:18.360]  Here's Tufts University with a globalist.
[41:18.360 --> 41:24.360]  This is just the tip of the iceberg, Biden and the Democrats want you to spend $65,000 plus for a new electric car,
[41:24.360 --> 41:31.360]  home electrical upgrades like solar panels, $15,000, $20,000 for new appliances, oh yeah, and $10,000 for new furnace,
[41:31.360 --> 41:35.360]  nor can landlords afford upgrades.
[41:35.360 --> 41:38.360]  Can you afford all the sick people from the shots?
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.360]  Swiss right wing party to call referendum and bid to block climate change law, good.
[41:43.360 --> 41:47.360]  Same thing is happening in the Netherlands.
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.360]  And what's it all meant to do?
[41:49.360 --> 41:52.360]  Make it where first world populations can't afford to have children.
[41:52.360 --> 41:53.360]  Data.
[41:53.360 --> 41:57.360]  White American births below replacement level in every state.
[41:57.360 --> 41:59.360]  Japan is below replacement level.
[41:59.360 --> 42:00.360]  Europe is.
[42:00.360 --> 42:01.360]  Only the third world's growing.
[42:01.360 --> 42:02.360]  We come back.
[42:02.360 --> 42:03.360]  What's really behind all this?
[42:03.360 --> 42:07.360]  Paul Ehrlich, who's the grand poobah, the grand master of it all,
[42:07.360 --> 42:12.360]  writing limits to growth, the population bomb, eco science, the rest of it,
[42:12.360 --> 42:17.360]  says the FCC should see to it that large families are always treated as negative light on television.
[42:17.360 --> 42:21.360]  This is in 1970, they did it all.
[42:21.360 --> 42:30.360]  And then it ties in to Harare's latest chilling statements about how you will be forced into the metaverse.
[42:30.360 --> 42:34.360]  Wait till we get to this information next segment.
[42:34.360 --> 42:41.360]  In fact, we're going to come out of break with Yuval Noah Harare in his latest statements
[42:41.360 --> 42:45.360]  about how you have to learn how to walk and talk again in the metaverse.
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.360]  You'll be locked up in your house to save us from carbon and must wear the VR goggles,
[42:49.360 --> 42:53.360]  which are the prototype for putting us into the pods of the Matrix.
[42:53.360 --> 42:56.360]  There's actually a Pentagon plan from 1977.
[42:56.360 --> 42:57.360]  It's all real, folks.
[42:57.360 --> 42:58.360]  Stay with us.
[43:00.360 --> 43:05.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, a very exciting development has just taken place.
[43:05.360 --> 43:09.360]  I want to encourage you all to go to infowarstore.com and check it out for yourself
[43:09.360 --> 43:13.360]  because it is a very strong, high-quality formula.
[43:13.360 --> 43:18.360]  Down-and-out sleep support, liquid, is very fast-acting, taken out of the tongue.
[43:18.360 --> 43:24.360]  It's got a very good dose of melatonin, passionflower of the larian root extract,
[43:24.360 --> 43:26.360]  lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[43:26.360 --> 43:33.360]  All of these compounds are documented on record to help give you deeper, cleaner, healthier sleep.
[43:33.360 --> 43:37.360]  And that is one of the biggest game changers out there with all the stress we have in this world.
[43:37.360 --> 43:40.360]  And we've got some other great sleep aids as well, and they're excellent.
[43:40.360 --> 43:41.360]  They're all different formulas.
[43:41.360 --> 43:45.360]  But this one is particularly the strongest one we have.
[43:45.360 --> 43:48.360]  So down-and-out, sold out for more than five months.
[43:48.360 --> 43:51.360]  It's now back available at infowarstore.com.

[43:56.360 --> 43:59.360]  with down-and-out sleep support at infowarstore.
[44:00.360 --> 44:05.360]  The powerful combination of both vitamin C and zinc are great stepping stones
[44:05.360 --> 44:07.360]  to leading a healthier life.
[44:07.360 --> 44:11.360]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system

[44:17.360 --> 44:20.360]  should be your next purchase from the info war store.
[44:20.360 --> 44:24.360]  The rose hips contained within are a part of the rose flower just below the petals
[44:24.360 --> 44:27.360]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[44:27.360 --> 44:32.360]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[44:32.360 --> 44:37.360]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[44:37.360 --> 44:42.360]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.360]  in nutrition, immune defense, and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[44:46.360 --> 44:50.360]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,
[44:50.360 --> 44:53.360]  even in affluent populations like here in America.
[44:53.360 --> 44:57.360]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at infowarstore.com
[44:57.360 --> 45:00.360]  where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[45:07.360 --> 45:11.360]  Infowars has made it easier to make sure you are getting enough in your system

[45:24.360 --> 45:27.360]  that contain the rose plant seeds.
[45:27.360 --> 45:32.360]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions
[45:32.360 --> 45:37.360]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[45:37.360 --> 45:40.360]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves,
[45:40.360 --> 45:44.360]  you probably already know that they play an important role in nutrition, immune defense,
[45:44.360 --> 45:46.360]  and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[45:46.360 --> 45:50.360]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate,

[46:34.360 --> 46:37.360]  Read all about it, be very safe with it.
[46:37.360 --> 46:40.360]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[46:40.360 --> 46:42.360]  Don't do it during the day.
[46:42.360 --> 46:46.360]  1776 testosterone boost, totally incredible.
[46:46.360 --> 46:50.360]  Go read about them, learn more about them at infowarstore.com

[47:01.360 --> 47:20.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:20.360 --> 47:26.360]  Maybe the most important quality to survive and flourish in the 21st century
[47:26.360 --> 47:32.360]  is to have mental flexibility, not just to keep learning and changing again and again,
[47:32.360 --> 47:35.360]  also to keep letting go.
[47:35.360 --> 47:41.360]  Part of what makes it difficult to learn new things that we hold on.
[47:41.360 --> 47:47.360]  Like, you know, I spent so many years learning something and now the world has changed.
[47:47.360 --> 47:54.360]  And I just don't want to let go and letting go, maybe I'll give an example of how deep it goes.
[47:54.360 --> 48:00.360]  Like, it's not just what you learn in college or what you learned in kindergarten.
[48:00.360 --> 48:08.360]  It's even what you learned as a baby, as a toddler, like learning how to see or learning how to walk.
[48:08.360 --> 48:12.360]  And what does that mean if I have to relearn how to see and walk?
[48:12.360 --> 48:19.360]  Well, as virtual reality improves, and you know, with all the talk of the metaverse and so forth,
[48:19.360 --> 48:26.360]  as we'll discuss later on, increasingly it's likely that there will be many more activities shifting
[48:26.360 --> 48:34.360]  from the physical biological world that we know into a new reality, a virtual reality,
[48:34.360 --> 48:38.360]  which has different physical and biological laws.
[48:38.360 --> 48:41.360]  Even the laws of physics there are different.
[48:41.360 --> 48:49.360]  So whether you want to interact socially there, or maybe you have a job in virtual reality, in the metaverse,
[48:49.360 --> 48:56.360]  or maybe you design, you have a new job designing fashion, designing shirts for virtual reality
[48:56.360 --> 48:58.360]  because people want to look good there.
[48:58.360 --> 49:10.360]  You need to forget how physics and light and gravity works here because it works in a different way in that reality.
[49:10.360 --> 49:13.360]  So just what does it mean?
[49:13.360 --> 49:20.360]  Like I'm now 46, let's say I have a new job designing fashion for the metaverse.
[49:20.360 --> 49:31.360]  How can I at age 46 kind of forget what it means to see and learn from scratch how to see things?
[49:31.360 --> 49:34.360]  Are you optimistic that adults can do that?
[49:34.360 --> 49:36.360]  We can't do it alone.
[49:36.360 --> 49:40.360]  Humans can't do it alone or individuals can't do it alone?
[49:40.360 --> 49:42.360]  Individuals can't do it alone.
[49:42.360 --> 49:46.360]  Like placing all the responsibility on individuals, the world is changing.
[49:46.360 --> 49:51.360]  Now it's your job to adapt, to change yourself, to learn.
[49:51.360 --> 49:53.360]  It doesn't work like that.
[49:53.360 --> 49:57.360]  It's too much for an individual to do just by themselves.
[49:57.360 --> 50:09.360]  We'll probably require organizations, governments to step in to make sure that people are not left behind.
[50:09.360 --> 50:11.360]  You know, just retraining people.
[50:11.360 --> 50:14.360]  We will have to see more government support.
[50:17.360 --> 50:21.360]  That's only a two and a half minute clip and I can talk for ten hours about it.
[50:21.360 --> 50:23.360]  We're going to make you do it.
[50:23.360 --> 50:25.360]  You'll have a universal basic income.
[50:25.360 --> 50:30.360]  You'll be forced to work in the metaverse and wear these VR goggles on your head.
[50:30.360 --> 50:33.360]  And we're going to reprogram the whole way the universe works.
[50:33.360 --> 50:37.360]  So when O'Brien is torturing Winston in 1984, he says,
[50:37.360 --> 50:40.360]  when I'm done brainwashing you, you won't know what gravity is.
[50:40.360 --> 50:42.360]  You won't believe it exists.
[50:42.360 --> 50:45.360]  You won't know what two plus two equals.
[50:45.360 --> 50:49.360]  And of course Orwell had worked at the highest levels of British intelligence and for the Communists and for Stalin
[50:49.360 --> 50:52.360]  and the whole nine yards and he understood where they were going and he was telling you,
[50:52.360 --> 50:56.360]  he wrote essays that this is where they really want to take you.
[50:56.360 --> 50:59.360]  And he just says, we're going to have government make you do this.
[50:59.360 --> 51:02.360]  No one's going to get left behind, not the Amish, not you.
[51:02.360 --> 51:04.360]  You're going to get your brain chip.
[51:04.360 --> 51:08.360]  You're going to get your neuro link because if you want to live, if you want to have a job,
[51:08.360 --> 51:11.360]  if you want food, you're going to do this.
[51:11.360 --> 51:15.360]  And the more you get into it, the more you're enslaved by it and the more depressed you get
[51:15.360 --> 51:20.360]  and the more alone you get and they say, hey, just opt to upload your brain now into the metaverse.
[51:20.360 --> 51:22.360]  Of course, you're really not going to be uploading your brain.
[51:22.360 --> 51:24.360]  You're going to be dying.
[51:24.360 --> 51:28.360]  But they'll have a law saying, oh, you can't say two men can't have a baby.
[51:28.360 --> 51:31.360]  You can't say that a man can't be a woman or a woman be a man.
[51:31.360 --> 51:42.360]  And you can't say that this corporation, Microsoft, Apple, metaverse, formerly Facebook,
[51:42.360 --> 51:45.360]  you can't say that that isn't really the person.
[51:45.360 --> 51:46.360]  Yeah, it can sound like them.
[51:46.360 --> 51:47.360]  It can look like them.
[51:47.360 --> 51:49.360]  The AIs recorded everything they say and do.
[51:49.360 --> 51:51.360]  And of course, it's a facsimile.
[51:51.360 --> 51:54.360]  But the big crime punishable by death.
[51:54.360 --> 52:00.360]  I've been telling you this for decades as they're now announcing it will be saying that's not real.
[52:00.360 --> 52:02.360]  And the machine doesn't have a soul.
[52:02.360 --> 52:05.360]  You've got to bow down to it.
[52:05.360 --> 52:11.360]  What the machines will have is a controlled universe that the system programs and the system creates
[52:11.360 --> 52:17.360]  the topography and the rules of which is called a total prison for your mind.
[52:17.360 --> 52:21.360]  And an attempt to trick your soul to believe it is imprisoned in there.
[52:21.360 --> 52:24.360]  And then from birth, children will only be given images.
[52:24.360 --> 52:28.360]  The system wants them to have and their minds will be programmed along that system
[52:28.360 --> 52:32.360]  so that they generationally won't even be able to recognize the third dimension
[52:32.360 --> 52:34.360]  and real reality and real choice.
[52:34.360 --> 52:38.360]  This is beyond satanic.
[52:38.360 --> 52:40.360]  Here, Hernandez sent me that clip this morning.
[52:40.360 --> 52:41.360]  He was already set for the show yesterday.
[52:41.360 --> 52:43.360]  We'll be talking about it next hour.
[52:43.360 --> 52:47.360]  But I want to play Paul Ehrlich in 1970.
[52:47.360 --> 52:48.360]  He was their spokesperson.
[52:48.360 --> 52:50.360]  He was on Johnny Carson 20-plus times promoting it.
[52:50.360 --> 52:55.360]  The FCC should see to it that large families are always treated the negative light on television.
[52:55.360 --> 53:01.360]  Well, since then, all the multi-children families, the dads a bad figure.
[53:01.360 --> 53:03.360]  Big families are evil.
[53:03.360 --> 53:04.360]  Children are bad.
[53:04.360 --> 53:06.360]  Children are bad for the earth.
[53:06.360 --> 53:09.360]  On and on and on.
[53:09.360 --> 53:13.360]  All of it to sell you on opting in yourself to a one-child policy,
[53:13.360 --> 53:15.360]  which they now say is good for the earth,
[53:15.360 --> 53:17.360]  even though we need to stabilize our population,
[53:17.360 --> 53:22.360]  have at least 2.1 children to replace the population we have.
[53:22.360 --> 53:25.360]  But see, they're building a post-human world,
[53:25.360 --> 53:27.360]  and there's not room for that here.
[53:27.360 --> 53:29.360]  That's how the corporation's captured humanity,
[53:29.360 --> 53:36.360]  is by making us lab-grown, lab-controlled biological androids in their own admissions.
[53:36.360 --> 53:40.360]  And Harari is the high priest, the spokesperson of the Davos Group,
[53:40.360 --> 53:43.360]  of Bill Gates, of the UN, of their whole project.
[53:43.360 --> 53:48.360]  But Paul Ehrlich, starting in the 60s, was really their chief scientist.
[53:48.360 --> 53:51.360]  And he wrote with John P. Holdren, Ecoscience,
[53:51.360 --> 53:54.360]  talking about putting fluoride in the water to lower your fertility, all of it.
[53:54.360 --> 53:57.360]  And these are the people that think we're so dumb,
[53:57.360 --> 54:01.360]  they can just hijack and take full control of civilization.
[54:01.360 --> 54:07.360]  So here he is in 1970, listen to the arrogance of how he's going to brainwash the public,
[54:07.360 --> 54:10.360]  because he knows best, because the rest of you are all just scum.
[54:10.360 --> 54:13.360]  He also predicted mass die-offs by 77,
[54:13.360 --> 54:15.360]  and the world would fall to one billion people.
[54:15.360 --> 54:16.360]  Never happened.
[54:16.360 --> 54:18.360]  But he's telling you the world's going to end,
[54:18.360 --> 54:20.360]  so you accept it's going to end,
[54:20.360 --> 54:24.360]  and that's what AOC and Bill Gates and Beto O'Rourke,
[54:24.360 --> 54:26.360]  they all tell you it's ending in 2030.
[54:26.360 --> 54:28.360]  Because as you know the world, it will be ending.
[54:28.360 --> 54:31.360]  You'll wish you were dead if they succeed.
[54:31.360 --> 54:32.360]  They're selling you dystopia.
[54:32.360 --> 54:34.360]  They're selling you depression.
[54:34.360 --> 54:36.360]  They're selling you state-intimidated,
[54:36.360 --> 54:39.360]  sponsored, forced euthanasia or murder,
[54:39.360 --> 54:41.360]  as Canada and England are now doing.
[54:41.360 --> 54:43.360]  They're sterilizing your children.
[54:43.360 --> 54:45.360]  They're cutting your son's testicles off.
[54:45.360 --> 54:46.360]  They're chemically sterilizing them.
[54:46.360 --> 54:50.360]  They're selling the most macabre, nightmare systems
[54:50.360 --> 54:54.360]  as something that's good and that we should accept and is altruistic.
[54:54.360 --> 54:57.360]  And they're the high priests with their new anti-human, transhumanist religion
[54:57.360 --> 54:59.360]  that are going to lead us into the brave new world.
[54:59.360 --> 55:02.360]  But really they're not leading us into some new brave new evolution.
[55:02.360 --> 55:06.360]  They're leading us into a dead end with their energy systems.
[55:06.360 --> 55:09.360]  And all their projects meant to fail, not to succeed.
[55:09.360 --> 55:11.360]  You believe you're going into a better world.
[55:11.360 --> 55:13.360]  You're going into a trap.
[55:13.360 --> 55:15.360]  You're going into a black hole.
[55:15.360 --> 55:17.360]  We're going to play this clip, go to break,
[55:17.360 --> 55:20.360]  start the next hour, get into the big Davos group documents that came out,
[55:20.360 --> 55:22.360]  Andrew Hernandez joins us, there's so much more.
[55:22.360 --> 55:24.360]  Remember the only way people hear this information is when you share the links
[55:24.360 --> 55:28.360]  from infowars.com forward slash show and bandot video.
[55:28.360 --> 55:30.360]  Take clips out, we're free to air, whatever you do,
[55:30.360 --> 55:33.360]  spread the word because we're really starting to win this fight
[55:33.360 --> 55:35.360]  but we haven't won the main war.
[55:35.360 --> 55:37.360]  And please go to infowars.com.
[55:37.360 --> 55:41.360]  Today is the last day to get vital mineral fusion and DNA Force Plus for 50% off.
[55:41.360 --> 55:44.360]  Here is the top priest of the new world order.
[55:44.360 --> 55:49.360]  Now, given the population explosion, let alone in this country,
[55:49.360 --> 55:53.360]  what can the government, what ought the government to do about this?
[55:53.360 --> 55:55.360]  Well, what it ought to do is this, the first thing,
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.360]  you don't want to put, I'm against government interference in our lives.
[55:59.360 --> 56:00.360]  You want to minimize that.
[56:00.360 --> 56:04.360]  So the very first thing the government should do is try and take the pressure off to reproduce.
[56:04.360 --> 56:06.360]  There's a lot of pressure in our society now to reproduce.
[56:06.360 --> 56:09.360]  If you're single, people try and push you into getting married.
[56:09.360 --> 56:13.360]  You know, your wife, you have a bachelor over and your wife says,
[56:13.360 --> 56:16.360]  gee, shouldn't I have a nice girl over the idea that nobody should escape.
[56:16.360 --> 56:18.360]  So there's pressure to get married.
[56:18.360 --> 56:21.360]  Young couples, if they don't have children, people say, gee, they must be sterile.
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.360]  They never say, gee, maybe they like good wine and going to the theater and so on.
[56:25.360 --> 56:26.360]  They prefer that to scraping diapers.
[56:26.360 --> 56:28.360]  So there's pressure to have children.
[56:28.360 --> 56:31.360]  So the first thing that should happen is that the president ought to say,
[56:31.360 --> 56:38.360]  from now, here on out, no intelligent patriotic American family ought to have more than two children, preferably one.
[56:38.360 --> 56:43.360]  If you're starting a family now, not any law, but just say, this is what responsible people do.
[56:43.360 --> 56:49.360]  You ought to make the FCC see to it that large families are always treated in a negative light on television wherever they appear.
[56:49.360 --> 56:54.360]  There ought to be a tremendous amount of television time devoted to spot commercials, the sort we've had against smoking.
[56:54.360 --> 56:59.360]  But ones in the middle, say, in the middle of Beverly Hillbillies, you get a scene which shows Los Angeles in a smog
[56:59.360 --> 57:01.360]  and it just says, this city has a fatal disease.
[57:01.360 --> 57:04.360]  It's called overpopulation in so long.
[57:04.360 --> 57:08.360]  Now, that sort of campaign, you could have a census, a sample census,
[57:08.360 --> 57:10.360]  which would see whether that was having a desired effect.
[57:10.360 --> 57:13.360]  If that didn't, you could move to giving women bonuses for not having babies.
[57:13.360 --> 57:15.360]  That almost certainly would do the job.
[57:15.360 --> 57:21.360]  If that didn't have the effect, then you could move to changing the tax structure so that people who had the money
[57:21.360 --> 57:23.360]  and had the children paid for the children.
[57:23.360 --> 57:26.360]  In other words, you would increase taxes on people with children rather than decrease.
[57:26.360 --> 57:30.360]  And since they, when they have the children, they require more services, if that doesn't work,
[57:30.360 --> 57:32.360]  then you'll have the government legislating the size of the family.
[57:32.360 --> 57:34.360]  And people say, oh, that's impossible.
[57:34.360 --> 57:37.360]  Government can never intrude and tell you how many children to have.
[57:37.360 --> 57:38.360]  Well, I got news.
[57:38.360 --> 57:40.360]  You know, it intruded a long time ago and told you how many wives you can have.
[57:40.360 --> 57:45.360]  And there's not the slightest question that if we don't get the population under control with voluntary means,
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.360]  that in the not-too-distant future, the government will simply tell you how many children you can have
[57:48.360 --> 57:49.360]  and throw you in jail if you have too many.
[57:49.360 --> 57:51.360]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[57:51.360 --> 57:53.360]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[57:53.360 --> 57:54.360]  Well, so do I.
[57:54.360 --> 57:58.360]  And I've been the most affected individual in the fight against the globalist,
[57:58.360 --> 58:01.360]  and I've got their number, and I know how to bring them down.
[58:01.360 --> 58:05.360]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[58:05.360 --> 58:10.360]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[58:10.360 --> 58:13.360]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on every front,
[58:13.360 --> 58:16.360]  but I'm not going to back down, and I'll never give up, but I could give out.
[58:16.360 --> 58:18.360]  So please keep me on the field.
[58:18.360 --> 58:21.360]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great products at the same time
[58:21.360 --> 58:23.360]  that will empower you and your family.

[59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.360]  Ever going to surrender, I physically can't do it.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:04.360]  It's my great part.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.360]  F**k you, Klaus Schwab. F**k you.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:10.360]  I got plenty of words for you, but at the end of the day,
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.360]  f**k you in your new world order, and f**k the horse you rode in on,
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.360]  and all your s**t.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.360]  And so they know if that spirit begins to, in their words,
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:26.360]  infect other people, it's game over for them to turn us into robots
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.360]  and play God and give us all these orders
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.360]  and tell us how to live and tell us what to do.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.360]  You're talking about Oxford and the Oxford Council.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.360]  That has just announced that it's going to break up Oxford
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:42.360]  into 15-minute communities, call them 15-minute cities,
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.360]  where everything that they say you need
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.360]  is within the 15-minute walk or cycle ride away you live.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:55.360]  And that you cannot, under this proposal,
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:01:00.360]  leave your 15-minute city in a car
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.360]  more than 100 times a year, or you find every time you do.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:10.360]  Now, what is that? That's simply lockdown.
[01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:15.360]  It's COVID lockdown, but it's done under the guise of climate change.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.360]  And so that's what this is really all about,
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.360]  is your ability to have free will that God gave you,
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.360]  and they're trying to take that away.
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:28.360]  The only thing God managed to create are organic beings.
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:33.360]  All these trees and giraffes and humans, they are just organic.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.360]  But we are now trying to create inorganic entities,
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:43.360]  inorganic life forms, cyborgs, artificial intelligence, and so forth.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.360]  If we succeed, and there is a very good chance we will,
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.360]  then very soon we will be beyond.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.360]  That's why I oppose them, and that's why I fight them.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.360]  And they act like, oh, they understand the universe,
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:59.360]  and they're bringing balance to it, and no, they like to hurt people,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.360]  they like to destroy children, they like to steal people's energy,
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.360]  they like to see people in miserable situations,
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:08.360]  because it makes them feel good, because they hate themselves.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:11.360]  Hundreds of different serial killers and psychopaths,
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.360]  and whether they're black, white, or Hispanic or Asian,
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:19.360]  they all look the same, and their eyes have the same weird dead look.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.360]  And beyond a dead look, they look scared.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.360]  Not just because they're in a mugshot, they look like they're captured.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.360]  Because those aren't people, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.360]  That's not a person anymore.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.360]  There's something in there driving it.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.360]  Better believe it.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:35.360]  And so when you look at the New World Order in Bill Gates,
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.360]  and people like Fauci, let me tell you, folks,
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:43.360]  there is a system of anti-God, anti-human inside that body
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.360]  that's running that body, and that's a biological android with one mission,
[01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.360]  and that is to humiliate you and cut you off from God before they kill you.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.360]  Well, Anthony Fauci told our government to tell people,
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:02.360]  don't do autopsies on COVID patients.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:09.360]  You cannot find that for which you do not look.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:19.360]  I have a post-vaccine nine-year-old on my desk, dead.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.360]  And that's all this is, is people turning the dial.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:26.360]  And how do you turn the dial? The Satanism? You kill people.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.360]  You hurt children. You molest children.
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:31.360]  You put poison in people that breaks their DNA.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.360]  They've now confirmed in more than a hundred studies that this mRNA
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:38.360]  with the spike protein goes into the cells for generations
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.360]  and has passed on to the children and causes mutations.
[01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.360]  They are turning people into mutants.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.360]  It's called the Fauci Effect.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.360]  We found other coronaviruses in bats, a whole host of them.
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.360]  Some of them looked very similar to SARS.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.360]  So we sequenced the spike protein, the protein that attaches to cells.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.360]  Then we, well, I didn't do this work, but my colleagues enchanted the work,
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:06.360]  you create pseudoparticles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses,
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:08.360]  sifted bind to human cells.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:12.360]  And each step of this, you move closer and closer to this virus
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.360]  could really become pathogenic in people.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:20.360]  So we need to turn the dial to the Holy Spirit, the big broadcast,
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.360]  and obviously, if you've been turning the dial the other way,
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.360]  you're not going to want to turn the dial.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.360]  It's not going to feel too good to turn the dial towards God.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.360]  So Christ was saying, yet behind me, I got a mission.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.360]  I'm going someplace. I'm on a path. I'm on a trajectory.
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.360]  I want to get in line with the Holy Spirit and then move to the future.
[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:44.360]  Oh, yes.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.360]  You guys are like, oh, you want that? Here, have that.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:50.360]  And I'm right there right now. I just, oh, wow.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.360]  I just feel the presence of God right now. Unbelievable.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:57.360]  God said, you want it? Here, I love you.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:18.360]  Come to me.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.360]  You can also make straight donations at infowarstore.com,
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:37.360]  clicking on the big red banner. A one time recurring,
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.360]  but I'm asking you to take action. We're nonviolent,
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.360]  but every time you donate money, every time you buy products,
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.360]  every time you keep us on air, you are literally,
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.360]  nonviolently politically, punching the new world order in the nose,
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.360]  punching their lives in the nose.
[01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:53.360]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.360]  We're going over the top.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:21.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:28.360]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.360]  And for the balance of the hour, Drew Hernandez.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:35.360]  He's going to get a talk show host, journalist,
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.360]  embattled field reporter and all the different antivariats.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:41.360]  He is with us to cover the waterfront in this hour.
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:45.360]  Then in the third hour and beyond, we're opening the phones up
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.360]  on any of the topics and issues we've raised or whatever topics, callers want to call in about.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:54.360]  Well, I guess it was last night.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:07:01.360]  Drew sent me a link that we played last hour of Harari, W-E-F Psycho.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.360]  You all know Harari, explains humans must let go and relearn how to see and walk,
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.360]  must be forced into the metaverse, the governments must force us into the metaverse,
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.360]  and that they will control the reality that we get.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.360]  He argues individuals will not be able to do this alone.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.360]  He says there will need to be government intervention.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.360]  So I want to start this hour where we ended the last hour.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.360]  This isn't just some crazy quack. This is their spokesperson.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.360]  He didn't invent all of this, obviously.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:31.360]  He's putting out, they've been putting out for a hundred years,
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.360]  but now they're very close to this.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.360]  Sure, folks are rejecting the metaverse or they're rejecting the poison shots,
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.360]  but they're saying we're not going to stop in the future.
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.360]  He says if you want a job, you're going to have to be part of this.
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:48.360]  Kind of like that famous photo six, seven years ago of Zuckerberg walking into the auditorium
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:52.360]  and everybody's sitting there like gorillas devolving,
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.360]  hunched over their laptops with their VRs on, but he's not wearing VR.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.360]  They're in his prison. They're seeing his reality.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.360]  They've got what he wants them to see being fed to them.
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:07.360]  So the power of this for brainwashing in their own words is insane.
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.360]  It's good that it's being rejected, but they're still rolling it out
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.360]  with the social credit score and the universal basic income
[01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:19.360]  and all the different surveillance systems that we're going to be going over in this hour.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.360]  We're also with Darug and look at the borders.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.360]  Biden's touch and go in El Paso.
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.360]  Biden now with classified documents that the vice president doesn't have the power
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:31.360]  to classify things that was from his vice presidential tenure.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.360]  We've got the Debo's group list leaked much bigger than what they normally claim is there
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.360]  of Zelensky and world leaders in the head of NATO.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.360]  This really is the private corporate global government
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:44.360]  that's really taking control of our lives.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.360]  We're going to be hitting that and so much more today.
[01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:50.360]  We'll also get Drew's take on the congressional situation last week.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.360]  What do you think of Kevin McCarthy and more?
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:58.360]  Drew Hernandez can be found at drewhlib.com.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.360]  Drewhlib.com. Drew, great to have you here with us.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.360]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:09.360]  Well, let's tackle this Harari thing because I think people need to understand
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.360]  and we've talked about this a lot on the show is the spiritual component
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.360]  going on behind the New World Order, these global elites, the World Economic Forum.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.360]  These people are proxies, right?
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.360]  They're literally possessed by Satan and demons to do their bidding
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.360]  with the ultimate New World Order satanic agenda that we see in the Bible
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.360]  that is listed very clearly.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.360]  But to really zero in and I really want to zero in on this clip
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:37.360]  is as to why and the psyche behind these psychos.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.360]  The number one thing that these people want is to not only play God
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.360]  but be God and be in the position of God.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.360]  And by the way, I just interrupt you.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:49.360]  He says that in other clubs that we're going to be God.
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:51.360]  I don't believe in God yet.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.360]  We're going to be God.
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:57.360]  This whole cult, they want to be God and we're slaves in this hellscape they're creating.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360]  Absolutely.
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.360]  Because of that, they try to think how they could imitate God and what God has engineered.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.360]  So specifically talking about this, God has created us with a soul and a spirit
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.360]  which is the spiritual DNA and component that animates us
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:18.360]  which is a huge mystery to scientists which is a huge mystery in the scientific medical world.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:25.360]  No one can clearly pinpoint how God has engineered this specific essential part of a human being
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:31.360]  and globalists know this but they have a satanic, imitating, pseudo-Christ mindset
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:36.360]  that wants to replicate it not for the purposes of understanding how God did something
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:39.360]  so they could worship and glorify God for His creation.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.360]  No, they want to be Him so that you back engineer it.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.360]  This is why they all go to AI.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:47.360]  This is the closest technology they have today to do this.
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.360]  They want to jack you in through AI, through VR, maybe AR, augmented reality
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:57.360]  so they could somehow tap into your conscience because they need your conscience and your soul
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.360]  to take away your free will.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.360]  The one thing that God has engineered us all on planet Earth is free will.
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:09.360]  God has given that to us as human beings we have free will to do what we want.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:16.360]  It comes with a positive impact or it comes with negative consequences here on planet Earth and also in Heaven.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  And, Andrew, what you say is so key.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:23.360]  From day one with the COVID rollout they admitted this is about climate, it's about restricting your movement,
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:28.360]  it's about forcing you to work in the metaverse and virtually they admit
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.360]  that they want to force us into this to physically restrain where we go
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.360]  which is the total proof of enslavement.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.360]  So out of the gates this thing is totally diabolical.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:43.360]  100% because they need to replicate somehow tapping into your conscience.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:47.360]  They need to replicate somehow tapping into your soul.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.360]  They need that because that is how you tap into someone's free will.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:55.360]  If you could tap into their mind and you control everything they think, everything they see,
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.360]  everything they download, everything, all of their actions, all of their thoughts,
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:03.360]  then you could completely control a human being from the top down.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.360]  That is why they want this.
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:13.360]  This is the closest technology right now in 2023 that the global elites have right now to their access
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.360]  in order to accomplish something like this.
[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:19.360]  So let's expand on that. We know from Dr. Ewing Cameron and Jellie and West,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:22.360]  this used to be on my History Channel, hour long documentaries,
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.360]  that when they kidnapped little kids, the CIA and Canada and the U.S. by the tens of thousands,
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:31.360]  and foster children, they would take them at 4, 5, 6, 7 and put hoods over their heads,
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.360]  audio into their ears, put them on drugs, in some cases for years until they erased who they were
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.360]  and then reprogrammed them. So that was a primitive form of this.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:42.360]  This is a brainwashing system.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:47.360]  100% because if they could tap into that through the technology that we have today,
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.360]  then they could control your mind.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.360]  Listen, the globally elites, when you take a look at the World Economic Forum,
[01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.360]  Davos is coming up next week and everyone, I advise everyone, should watch it like a hawk.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.360]  Clip it up, put it all over Twitter, put it all over everywhere.
[01:13:03.360 --> 01:13:06.360]  Clip these people at what they're saying because the general public needs to understand
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360]  just how much of a threat these people are.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:13.360]  They're a threat to the Republic. They're a threat to humanity because of people like Qvari.
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:18.360]  Listen to what this guy says, that there needs to be government intervention
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:23.360]  to get people to get on board with tapping into virtual reality.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.360]  What he's literally saying is you need to come out of reality because we're moving into the future.
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.360]  You need to merge with AI. You need to merge with a machine.
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:35.360]  Your mind, psychologically, can't do it itself to get there.
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:39.360]  So the government is going to take that place. It's going to take your free will
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:44.360]  in order to plunge you down into a path where you will lose your mind entirely.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.360]  And he's saying the future is a group forcing you to wear a hood over your head.
[01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:52.360]  I mean, if that isn't a cult, what is?
[01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:55.360]  That's the death cult. And at the end of the day, listen,
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:59.360]  the prime human being that the globalists want, right?
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:04.360]  The prime human being for Klaus Schwab, Noah Hervar, all these people, right?
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:09.360]  The globalists, the prime human being is someone that is mindless,
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.360]  that cannot think, that does not think, that is 100% controllable.
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:16.360]  I'll even go as far as to say this.
[01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.360]  Even the SJWs and the commies you see on the streets,
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.360]  where Owen Schreuer goes out there and you go out there, I go out there,
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  or Savannah Hernandez goes and debates these mindless zombies,
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.360]  even those people are a problem because those people could wake up someday.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:38.360]  That's problematic for the globalists. They need a mind that is 100% jacked into a system
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:42.360]  that is controllable on the back end from them, just like social media,
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:45.360]  just like Twitter, just like Facebook or the metaverse,
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.360]  just like all these big tech companies.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:54.360]  Absolutely surveilled, controlled rig system where we become biological Android robots plugged into the matrix.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.360]  And that's exactly where their mindsets are going right now.
[01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:01.360]  This isn't coming, the reason why they're talking about it
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.360]  is because you know these people are aware of the technology,
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.360]  they're aware of what they can get away of.
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:12.360]  Post-2020, majority of the world, not the populists and the info warriors watching right now,
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.360]  but a lot of people bent the knee and sacrificed a lot of freedoms
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:17.360]  in the name of safety and security.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.360]  That was a test run to see what they can get away with.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.360]  The big stuff is on its way, and this is just one of many things
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.360]  that they're going to roll out to control people's minds,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.360]  and we'll see how humanity receives it or rejects it.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:31.360]  I know IU and other people will not accept this
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:35.360]  because this is about taking away your free will and autonomy as a human being.
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:40.360]  And they're drugging us with a dopamine and totally controlling everybody.
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.360]  We've got to be conscious of this.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.360]  We come back, I'm going to talk about why they're in such a rush to get this in place now.
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.360]  How about the good news straight ahead with Drew Hernandez?
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:56.360]  Stay with us infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:39.360]  That way we can consolidate control and bankrupt the world economy,
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:44.360]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:50.360]  You will then be my slaves. Oh, and then you get that special shot

[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:01.360]  Infowars secret weapon is finally here.

[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.360]  for your way of life, for your libido.
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.360]  And it also keeps Infowars on the air, and I almost forgot,
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:17.360]  you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay for similar products
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.360]  or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.360]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360]  that supplies some of the top names.
[01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.360]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner's a listener
[01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:30.360]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.360]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high quality CBD
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.360]  for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.360]  You're not going to find at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram,
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.360]  you're not going to find tumor at 95% of humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.360]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.360]  These similar formulas with the same formulas
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:50.360]  sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.360]  Infowars MD, now available exclusively at infowarsstore.com.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:20:00.360]  A true 360 win.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:29.360]  We're going to hit all the other world news and economy news
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:33.360]  and the latest Biden with secret document news and it's illegal and he does it
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:36.360]  because he was vice president at the time vice presidents don't have that power
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.360]  unless you're directed by the president.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.360]  That's all coming up, but I wanted to get more into Yuval Noah Harari
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:48.360]  who is putting out their actual battle plan that we've been worrying about
[01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.360]  on there for 28 years.
[01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:53.360]  I want to play this short clip and start it and stop it and get Drew's take on it.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.360]  I did this last hour, but it's so important I'm going to do it again and let him comment
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.360]  because I know Drew's just as smart as I am, maybe smarter, which is great.
[01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:04.360]  We really smart people to get this, but everything he tells you is it's authoritarian.
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.360]  We're going to make you do it. Governments can be involved.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.360]  You'll have to do this to have a job.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.360]  They're forcing you into this artificial system where reality is suspended,
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.360]  where 2 plus 2 doesn't mean 4, where there's no gravity, where they're the masters,
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.360]  they're playing field, they're scammed, they're fraud.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:24.360]  You think FTX and Sam Bankman-Free was bad?
[01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:30.360]  You're giving these types of people control of your mind, but here is why they're doing it.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.360]  They know with technology it's a double-edged sword.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360]  They're using it for evil.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.360]  They know the powerful innovations are threatening their monopoly of power.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.360]  They call those disruptive technologies.
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.360]  So they want to harness humanity fully dumbest down and get control
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:47.360]  so they can use all the good aspects of this themselves and test it all on us
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:51.360]  like Netanyahu said a month ago with Jordan Peterson.
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:54.360]  We said, oh, Israel, we tested it, we know what it would do.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:57.360]  And now we're going to test all the new mRNA technologies on the Israeli people.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:59.360]  We'll be the laboratory of the world.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.360]  Our people are lab rats.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:04.360]  Why would they say my people are lab rats?
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:05.360]  That's Joseph Mingla.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.360]  Why would Harari say we're going to make you do this?
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.360]  Well, there's a point where they have to emerge.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.360]  There's a point where they have to admit this and finally throw it in your face
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:16.360]  and hope you go into Stockholm syndrome.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.360]  What do you think on that, Drew Hernandez?
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.360]  We'll start playing the clip.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.360]  I think it's pretty obvious.
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.360]  I think when we see that, that's exactly what the agenda is
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:28.360]  because these people have an agenda for world domination,
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:31.360]  but it's just through the centuries, through the hundreds of years,
[01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.360]  it comes through different forms,
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.360]  and it also coincides with the current technology of the day.
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.360]  So if people think that what we're talking about is too far-fetched
[01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:42.360]  and it's just way too out there,
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.360]  maybe because we're thinking like 100, 200, 500 years ahead, like they do.
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:49.360]  Come on, Alex, you and I know this, even the CCP.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.360]  These people have plans for the next 500 years.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:56.360]  They're not just thinking, oh, 10 years down the line, 20 here, 30 there, no, no.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:23:00.360]  These people have plans for humanity that go down hundreds of years down the line.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.360]  Hitler was looking 1,000 years ahead. That's what they're doing.
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.360]  Exactly. So let's take a look at that clip.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.360]  That's exactly why they're talking like this.
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360]  Drew, you'll take control of the last six minutes of the segment.
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:13.360]  You say pause it when you want and then make comments.
[01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:16.360]  You're hosting right now. Tell us to roll it.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.360]  Let's go.
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:23.360]  Maybe the most important quality to survive and flourish in the 21st century
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.360]  is to have mental flexibility,
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.360]  not just to keep learning and changing again and again,
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:32.360]  also to keep letting go.
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:38.360]  Part of what makes it difficult to learn new things that we hold on.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:42.360]  Like, you know, I spent so many years learning something
[01:23:42.360 --> 01:23:44.360]  and now the world has changed.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:48.360]  And I just don't want to let go and letting go,
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.360]  maybe I'll give an example of how deep it goes.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:57.360]  It's not just what you learn in college or what you learned in kindergarten.
[01:23:57.360 --> 01:24:01.360]  It's even what you learned as a baby, as a toddler,
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.360]  like learning how to see or learning how to walk.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:09.360]  What does that mean? I have to relearn how to see and walk.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.360]  Well, as virtual reality improves,
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.360]  and you know, with all the talk of the metaverse and so forth,
[01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.360]  we'll discuss later on.
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:21.360]  Alright, people need to understand,
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.360]  when you listen to these guys talk, right,
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.360]  they sound all good, they sound all heroic.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.360]  This is how abusers function.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:31.360]  They prop themselves up as the saviors and the heroes
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.360]  and the protectors of the individual that they're targeting.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.360]  So these guys always start that way.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.360]  They always start like the nice guys,
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:40.360]  like the heroes, they're going to save humanity.
[01:24:40.360 --> 01:24:42.360]  Oh, this is...
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.360]  Just let go, put the handcuffs on, get in the trunk,
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:47.360]  I will take care of you.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:49.360]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.360]  They are the ones that are going to enslave you,
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.360]  but they pretend to be the protectors.
[01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360]  But the point I was trying to make is,
[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.360]  they do this in a way that sounds like,
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.360]  oh, you're just an old wine skin.
[01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.360]  It's time to be a new wine skin
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.360]  in order to get with the new generation and the new times.
[01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.360]  But then look where he turns, continue with what he's saying.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.360]  How to see and walk.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:16.360]  Well, as virtual reality improves,
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:18.360]  and you know, with all the talk of the metaverse and so forth,
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:20.360]  that we'll discuss later on,
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.360]  increasingly it's likely that there will be many more activities
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:29.360]  shifting from the physical, biological world that we know
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:33.360]  into a new reality, a virtual reality,
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.360]  which has different physical and biological laws.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:40.360]  Even the laws of physics there are different.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:44.360]  So whether you want to interact socially there,
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:48.360]  or maybe you have a job in virtual reality, in the metaverse,
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:53.360]  or maybe you design, you have a new job designing fashion,
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.360]  designing shirts for virtual reality,
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.360]  because people want to look good there.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.360]  So you need to forget how physics and light
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.360]  and gravity works here,
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.360]  because it works in a different way in that reality.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:13.360]  So just what does it mean?
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.360]  Like I'm now 46.
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:20.360]  Let's say I have a new job designing fashion for the metaverse.
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:26.360]  How can I at age 46 kind of forget what it means to see,
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.360]  and learn from scratch how to see things?
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.360]  Are you optimistic that adults can do that?
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.360]  We can't do it alone.
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:37.360]  Like placing all...
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:39.360]  Can't do it alone or individuals can't do it alone?
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:41.360]  Individuals can't do it alone.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:44.360]  Like placing all the responsibility on individuals,
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.360]  the world is changing, now it's your job to adapt,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.360]  to change yourself, to learn.
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.360]  It doesn't work like that.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.360]  It's too much for an individual to do just by themselves.
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:02.360]  We'll probably require organizations,
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.360]  governments to step in,
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.360]  to make sure that people are not left behind.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:09.360]  Just retraining people.
[01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:13.360]  We will have to see more government support.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.360]  Total brainwashing, Hernandez.
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360]  That's it right there.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360]  You see the bait and switch?
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.360]  The bait is I'm a good guy.
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.360]  This is how the predators and abusers function.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:25.360]  The bait is I'm a good guy.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.360]  I'm here to save you.
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.360]  We're here to assist you in going down into the future
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.360]  because you might be an old boomer and not be able to get it.
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.360]  This is literally like aliens show up and they would say this.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360]  This is like a science fiction movie.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:39.360]  We're here to help you assimilate.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:40.360]  You will assimilate.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:42.360]  This is futile.
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.360]  Absolutely.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:46.360]  This is 100% Nazi tyrannical thinking.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.360]  The guy is literally sitting there saying,
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.360]  we're going to be the ones to protect you.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  We'll take you into the future and then the switch comes
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  and the host literally asks him,
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:59.360]  so do you think humans can do it themselves?
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.360]  No.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.360]  It needs to be government intervention.
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:06.360]  What he's talking about is forced so-called evolution.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.360]  Exactly.
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.360]  He's saying AI and here's the key.
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:13.360]  He says the laws of physics, you have to suspend them
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:15.360]  and you will own nothing.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360]  You will be happy because you're going to be living in the metaverse.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.360]  You won't have real clothes.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360]  You'll be in a pod but you'll have the clothes he's designing
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:23.360]  that you pay him for.
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:25.360]  It's to take you out of reality.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.360]  These people don't want you in reality.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.360]  That's why they want to bring you into something virtual.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.360]  That's why he's making comments like that so they suspend you
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:36.360]  outside of reality in your mind so they can control everything
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:38.360]  that you're doing and seeing.
[01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:42.360]  It makes 100% sense to me because if they could suspend you
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:46.360]  out of reality and not even have you understand where you are
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:48.360]  and keep you in that perpetual mindset,
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.360]  that is how they could control you forever.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360]  These people are demons, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:29:17.360]  We'll be right back with Hernandez. Stay with us.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:30.360]  We'll be right back with Hernandez.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:58.360]  We'll be right back with Hernandez.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:31.360]  On the horse was named Death.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:37.360]  Another translation is I looked and behold a pale horse
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:42.360]  and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him.
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:45.360]  A book of Revelation.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.360]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:49.360]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.360]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.360]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.360]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.360]  They're very upset that they're losing
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.360]  and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:01.360]  Info Wars M.D. is finally here.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.360]  It's the very same high-quality products
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:06.360]  you've been getting through Info Wars Life,
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.360]  but an expanded catalog and in some cases the prices are lower
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.360]  because we're going directly to the source
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:16.360]  that was supplying the supplement companies
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:18.360]  that we were buying our high-quality products from.
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:22.360]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.360]  via the Info Wars M.D. line.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.360]  The highest quality, triple tested.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:29.360]  Many of these products are sold on store shelves
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.360]  for more than twice the cost.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.360]  You'll get them at infowarstore.com under our exclusive label.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.360]  We are bringing you the highest quality supplements
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:40.360]  directly from the factory, right here in the USA,
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.360]  to your door.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360]  It'll make your life healthy, better,
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:47.360]  boost your immune system and it keeps Info Wars store on the air.
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:51.360]  So again, introducing Info Wars M.D. now exclusively available
[01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:55.360]  at infowarstore.com with massive, massive sales.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:00.360]  It's a post-COVID world now.
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:03.360]  Americans have lost trust in their doctors
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:05.360]  and the healthcare system.
[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.360]  There's a solution.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.360]  The Wellness Company.
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:10.360]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough and I'm the Chief Scientific Officer
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.360]  and I can tell you firsthand that these verticals
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:16.360]  of uncensored content, virtual appointments,
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:19.360]  doctors on demand, prescriptions through a network
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:24.360]  of community pharmacies in home, in vitro diagnostics,
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:29.360]  laboratory testing, imaging, an online set of holistic products
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:33.360]  can help guide you for your usual general medical care,
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:37.360]  but also COVID-19, acute and post-COVID syndromes,
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:41.360]  vaccine injury syndromes, and the array of things
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:45.360]  that now America has to work through in this new world
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.360]  that we're living in.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:50.360]  So go to onlinehealthnow.com and check out
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:53.360]  the Wellness Company for a low monthly fee.
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:33:17.360]  You can get started today and on a pathway to better health.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:29.360]  Drew wants to get back into this whole false reality.
[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:31.360]  Not just the Hollywood brainwashing,
[01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:33.360]  not just the drugging of the kids,
[01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.360]  but the literal digital hood over our head
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.360]  to complete the journey into enslavement.
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:40.360]  And I'm going to tie in some other news articles
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:41.360]  that we're going to shift gears,
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:43.360]  but please remember, listeners,
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.360]  we don't get put as the end cap at all the bookstores.
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.360]  We don't get promoted by President Obama
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:50.360]  and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates like Arari does.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.360]  We don't get the billionaire funding.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.360]  We're funded by you.
[01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.360]  We try to bring you amazing, high quality products
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:58.360]  so you have a great experience and come back and buy again.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:01.360]  And Info Wars, again, is in the red on the edge of black.
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.360]  We have made it through the big trials,
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360]  all the big battles.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.360]  We're going to continue on.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:06.360]  We're appealing these rulings.
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:09.360]  We're going to stay on the air for years.
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:13.360]  They can't shut us down unless you don't fund the operation
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:15.360]  and we're just a little bit in the red.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.360]  We have great products you already need.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:21.360]  The great reset in the war for the world came out six months ago.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:25.360]  It was off and on, the number one selling book in the world.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.360]  And the way it works with publishing is,
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360]  I got a small payment up front,
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360]  and then I've still not been paid six months
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.360]  as long as I'm supposed to get paid
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:36.360]  for the million-plus books that got sold.
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:39.360]  And I intend to take that money and put it into the operation
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.360]  to keep this show on the air.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.360]  That money is supposed to get here in the next month.
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:45.360]  That's great.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.360]  But there's a way you can support Info Wars right away.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:50.360]  Not the books sold in stores, not the books sold in Amazon,
[01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:52.360]  but infowarsstore.com,
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:54.360]  where you can get signed and unsigned books.
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:56.360]  You can get the book for 20-something bucks, hardcover,
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:58.360]  the great reset war for the world, their own words,
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:02.360]  Harari, what they plan for you and your family, how to stop them.
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:05.360]  Steve Bannon said the most important book
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.360]  written in our generation.
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:08.360]  I didn't ask him to say that.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.360]  He read it and it was blown away.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:13.360]  This book is so important to give to friends and family
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.360]  to wake up as well.
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:18.360]  So get an unsigned copy or get a signed copy for $99
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:22.360]  at infowarsstore.com as a fundraiser.
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:26.360]  We have 1,500 books left that I am going to sign.
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.360]  I just signed a couple hundred this morning.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.360]  And when those 1,500 are gone,
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:33.360]  no more signed copies from Info Wars.
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:36.360]  That will be it for signed copies.
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:41.360]  There's another 1,800 books that are unsigned
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:43.360]  at infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:45.360]  And I hope you'll get those as well.
[01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.360]  But it's the signed copies at infowarsstore.com
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.360]  that are the fundraiser.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.360]  You get a signed copy and you know you kept us on air.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:56.360]  That will raise over $100,000 if we sell those.
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:00.360]  And that will get us through much of the underage
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:02.360]  we've got for this month.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.360]  So it's simple things like that.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.360]  Part of this is a catch-22.
[01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.360]  We have millions and millions and millions and millions
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.360]  and millions and millions.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.360]  Something like 8 million people watch Band-Aught videos
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:12.360]  every day.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.360]  But then we get a bill of $100,000 a month.
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:16.360]  We're building our own system.
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:17.360]  We're successful.
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360]  But we're only backed by you, the listeners and viewers.
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:20.360]  So we have a lot of expenses.
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:23.360]  I don't want to have to cut back the hundreds and hundreds
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:27.360]  of band hosts and investigative journalists and others
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.360]  and scientists and others that are on Band-Aught video
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360]  like Drew Hernandez and many others.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.360]  I need to keep that site going.
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:34.360]  It's an important service to save lives
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.360]  and expose the new world order with all the censorship
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.360]  that's going on.
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:39.360]  So please go to infowarsstore.com right now
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360]  and get a signed or unsigned copy
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.360]  of the great reset in the war for the world.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:45.360]  It's your last chance to get signed copies.
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360]  When those 1,500 are gone, they are gone.
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:51.360]  And finally, last day to get DNA Force Plus
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:55.360]  with the PQQ and the CoQ-10 that helps your telomeres last longer,
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.360]  cleans out your cells, next level immune system.
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:01.360]  It's just incredible what does your mind, everything else.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:03.360]  It's 50% off.
[01:37:03.360 --> 01:37:05.360]  So is vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:07.360]  They're almost sold out.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.360]  It'll be months before more comes in.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.360]  So it's going to go back to a regular price
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.360]  for the next few weeks so we get the money in.
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.360]  But today is the last day for 50% off
[01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.360]  at infowarsstore.com or triple eight,
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:21.360]  two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.

[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:27.360]  that's so good for your youth and your stamina and your energy.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360]  Things in it like preglonone.
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360]  It's 50% off back in stock.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.360]  Get that at infowarsstore.com and our great,

[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:43.360]  It's been sold out for five months.
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  It's back in stock.
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.360]  40% off at infowarsstore.com.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.360]  Back to Drew Hernandez of DrewHLive.com.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.360]  Incredible reporter, syndicated talk show host
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.360]  in his own right.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.360]  It was great being on with him a few weeks ago
[01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:56.360]  and he and Charlie Kerr co-hosting together.
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.360]  You wanted to get back into Harari
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.360]  and this attack on humanity, this attempt to
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:03.360]  colonize our mind and our very soul.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360]  Yeah, 100%.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:07.360]  I think what I want people to like really think about
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:12.360]  is again, you take a look in my view,
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.360]  this is like a very interesting digital form
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.360]  of possession of the human being, right?
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.360]  And they want your conscience.
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:21.360]  They want your soul.
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:23.360]  They want your mind because if they have that,
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:26.360]  that taps into your free will and they could control you.
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.360]  That's what they need to neuter out of humanity.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.360]  It's very clear that that's what they need.
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.360]  That's an essential, that's a necessity for these people
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.360]  in order to get exactly what they want.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.360]  I mean, put this in the political sphere, right?
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:42.360]  I mean, look at what's being fed by Democrats, all right?
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:46.360]  You got Puppet Joe Biden that's been installed
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:48.360]  as the president of the United States.
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:52.360]  You have people like Puppet Senator John Federnick.
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.360]  Now you got Puppet Governor Katie Hobbs
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:56.360]  down in Arizona as well.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.360]  These people don't have minds.
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:39:00.360]  These people don't think.
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.360]  They don't do anything out of their own will.
[01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.360]  These people are told what to do.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:07.360]  They're commanded how to govern.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.360]  We can even say that, but it's an agenda
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:12.360]  that these people download from the top down
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:15.360]  and all they do is perform and do as that they're told.
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:18.360]  The problem with that, even with that,
[01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:21.360]  is that you take a look at Puppet Biden, he makes mistakes.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.360]  He makes tons of mistakes that cause people to wake up.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.360]  They can't have that.
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:27.360]  You take a look at John Federnick.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.360]  They won't have him talk to anybody, not even give an interview.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360]  Why?
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.360]  Because people will see through that this guy
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.360]  is literally just a mindless puppet and doesn't know anything.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.360]  Same thing with so-called Governor Katie Hobbs down in Arizona.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:43.360]  The reason why we're seeing this trend start to rise
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:46.360]  with these so-called politicians and elected leaders
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:49.360]  that are being installed of just these mindless puppets
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:51.360]  is because that is what they need.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.360]  That is what they want.
[01:39:52.360 --> 01:39:56.360]  They need people that can 100% be controllable,
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.360]  that will question nothing, that will show no opposition
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.360]  and not even have the potential of providing any opposition
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.360]  or waking up and getting red-pilled some day
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.360]  and coming to the realization that there's a new world order.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.360]  There's a globally lead out there.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360]  The deep state is out there.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:12.360]  What you say is so key.
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:14.360]  I remember reading Bloomberg articles a decade ago
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:15.360]  and others saying,
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.360]  Davos elites want puppet presidents and leaders
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.360]  and saying they just want drones
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.360]  and they want to discredit elected governments
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:25.360]  so they're purposely putting zombies like Biden and Federman in.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360]  They admit what you're saying.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:30.360]  There it is and the technology has caught up.
[01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:32.360]  The technology has cut up now
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:34.360]  because now they have the ability.
[01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:36.360]  This is why they're talking about this.
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.360]  Imagine if they had someone like Biden just mindless.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.360]  AI controlled can take certain downloads.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:44.360]  No mistakes.
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.360]  Don't need to give the guy Q cards.
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:48.360]  Imagine if they could have you.
[01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.360]  You think that these global satanic homicidal maniacs,
[01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:53.360]  if they had that kind of technology,
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360]  wouldn't use it against the American people?
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360]  Look what they're doing with mRNA.
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.360]  Look what they're doing with big tech.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.360]  Look what they're doing with all the technology we have today.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:03.360]  As humans, we have to be very careful.
[01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.360]  I'm not saying technology is evil.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:07.360]  I'm not a Gnosticism pusher.
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:09.360]  I'm going to interrupt.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:11.360]  Go back to Gnosticism with the Gnostics, but hold on.
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:14.360]  Remember a decade ago, the CIA admitted they created a program
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:17.360]  where they put in the info and they put a fake name on it
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:20.360]  and it writes the same article under a thousand different names?
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:21.360]  Absolutely.
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:24.360]  Technology can be used for good or for evil
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.360]  and we're seeing that very clear right now.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360]  This goes back to the Garden of Eden, Alex.
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:34.360]  What was one of the things that the serpent, the devil used to tempt Eve?
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.360]  You will receive higher knowledge to discern good from evil.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:40.360]  You will receive higher wisdom.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:46.360]  I will impart to you something you don't know that will make you advanced.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.360]  Makes sense when you start to see all these tech companies come out.
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:52.360]  Steve Jobs goes and has an acid trip or is on DMT,
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:54.360]  sees visions that you should call the company Apple,
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:56.360]  go down this route, go down this route.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.360]  And look where we are today.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.360]  Like I said, if you want to listen, the New World Order thinks
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:04.360]  like the Nazis did thousands of years down the line,
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.360]  that's because it's demonic in origin.
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:10.360]  These demons have been around for centuries, thousands of years.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360]  They know how humanity works.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.360]  They know what humanity wants and they got an agenda.
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:15.360]  Let's just say what they are.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:18.360]  The Bible tells us they're fallen marooned here.
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:19.360]  We're more advanced than they are,
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.360]  but we don't understand that we're made the image of God.
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.360]  They're aliens.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.360]  That's what it is.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.360]  Interdimensional aliens.
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.360]  And by the way, I talked to top globalists.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.360]  I've talked off record and they all know this.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:29.360]  They don't even laugh.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:30.360]  They go, yeah, of course.
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:31.360]  It's aliens, folks.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.360]  Aliens, bad aliens, fallen aliens, not good guys,
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.360]  are literally manipulating our species to build the system they want.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360]  Because we're the actual builders.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.360]  We're the geniuses.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:42.360]  We just don't know it.
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.360]  Absolutely.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:47.360]  The fallen angels have been manipulating humanity for thousands of years
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:50.360]  and it's continuing today and it's not going to stop.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:53.360]  People need to wake up to that reality because that is reality.
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:57.360]  As in the days of Noah, so will it be in the days of the Son of Men.
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:02.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now launching the most powerful supplements
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:08.360]  in the history of Infowars under a new brand name, Infowars Platinum.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:11.360]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products you see in front of you
[01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:16.360]  are already number one bestsellers in the market for the last few years
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:17.360]  because they work so well.
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:21.360]  We've gone right to the manufacturer who are listeners, the owners of fan,
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.360]  and they've given us this huge deal off of retail,
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:29.360]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.360]  And not just under one name.
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:35.360]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.360]  and suppliers have put out.
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:41.360]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.360]  We're talking about Payne MD.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:45.360]  We're talking about HGH MaxBoost.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:48.360]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360]  These things are incredible.
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:53.360]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:55.360]  and consult your healthcare provider.
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:56.360]  Those are so powerful.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.360]  Get them at infowarsstore.com.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.360]  I'm Dr. Peter McCullough, and it's an absolute pleasure to introduce to you
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:08.360]  the Wellness Company, an alternative healthcare system for this COVID
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:13.360]  and post COVID world where trust has been lost in doctors
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.360]  and healthcare systems.

[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:15.360]  because we're going directly to the source that was supplying the supplement companies
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.360]  that we were buying our high quality products from.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:24.360]  So we're able to lower prices and bring you more products via the Info Wars MD line.

[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.360]  So again, introducing Info Wars MD.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:47:19.360]  Now exclusively available at infowarsstore.com with massive, massive sales.
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:28.360]  Look, the globalists know what they're doing.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:35.360]  They get busy working and have all this garbage news and Hollywood propaganda out there.
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.360]  They hope you just give up, kind of roll over and don't pay attention.
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:43.360]  Then they bring in this anti-human domestication kill grid.
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:44.360]  And we're aware of it.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:45.360]  We've been warning about it for decades.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.360]  It's all coming through like we said because we're on target.
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:53.360]  There's all these ideologies, all these distraction things out there.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.360]  But you notice, more people say, man, it's like, it's Alex Jones' world.
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:47:59.360]  We're just living it.
[01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.360]  No, it's not Alex Jones' world.
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.360]  It's the devil's world.
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.360]  The devil has dominion right now for a short time and is making his move against humanity.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.360]  He will be defeated.
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:14.360]  But you have to understand, we're telling you what's coming next because the enemy is on record with their plan.
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:19.360]  And it's horrible to see the plan, but what's more horrible is to not do anything about it.
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:24.360]  So, so many people, it's like hearing you've got to lose weight or you've got to clean out the garage
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.360]  or you've got to save money or you've got to take care of a problem.
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:28.360]  You don't want to hear it.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.360]  You procrastinate.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:32.360]  Folks, procrastination with this is death.
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:33.360]  You're designed to fight this.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:35.360]  You're designed to overcome this.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:39.360]  Dear Hernandez, I want to hit some other news with you on the poison shots and politics
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:42.360]  and more before you got to leave and go to your own show.
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  Just in closing, because you're also been a youth minister and pastor in your, you know, in your previous incarnation.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:52.360]  That's why you're so dolly to the Holy Spirit discernment, because that really is our knowledge.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.360]  It's not that I'm smarter.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  You're smart.
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.360]  We're actually just resonating and connected.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.360]  I can't tell people how many times I'll just know something and then go research it and they're actually saying it and doing it.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:05.360]  So, so we do have the advanced technology of the Holy Spirit.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:07.360]  Can you speak to that?
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.360]  Yes.
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:17.360]  At the end of the day, if God be for us who could be against us, okay, so all of this that's happening is happening.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:20.360]  God is overseeing and watching what is happening.
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:24.360]  He has his timeline and is allowing certain things to happen for certain reasons.
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:34.360]  Now, where I kind of separate with other, you know, so-called Christians or pastors is a lot of a lot of evangelicals will kind of say,
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:38.360]  well, you know, God said this was going to happen and we're in the last days.
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:43.360]  So we might as well just pack it up and just look to the sky and Jesus is going to come and save us.
[01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:46.360]  Well, we don't, we don't, no man knows the day or the hour.
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.360]  Okay, this is kind of where I separate from that.
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  And I say, well, we don't know if that's going to happen for another 10 minutes, 10 years.
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360]  Who knows?
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.360]  We don't, nobody knows.
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:05.360]  What I do know is that the Bible also commands that we must expose darkness, that we must oppose evil,
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.360]  and that we must stand with God, especially in the face of tyranny.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:12.360]  That's when those things come to fruition.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:19.360]  So right now as a Christian, and I kind of find myself by myself a lot of these times and some like Christian circles like disagree with me,
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:23.360]  which I don't care at this point, because if anyone should be effective right now,
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:31.360]  not only exposing this, but taking this kind of stuff head on and really having the power of God alongside of you to combat it,
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.360]  it should be a born again Christian right now, where we are in the future.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:36.360]  That's right.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:37.360]  People are hiding in churches.
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.360]  They don't want to talk about these topics because they're scary, but that's not going to make it go away.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:42.360]  This is a test.
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:45.360]  God said, this is a test and it's a white throne judgment.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:49.360]  If you don't stand up against this evil, God's going to say, I don't know you.
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:53.360]  And 100% and he also says cowards are going to hell.
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:54.360]  That's in the Bible, man.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:59.360]  I mean, so a lot of people are just, they're afraid to speak out.
[01:50:59.360 --> 01:51:04.360]  They're afraid to expose because it will come with consequences.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.360]  It'll come with persecution.
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.360]  It'll come with cancellation.
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:11.360]  You could possibly lose everything you possibly have.
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:14.360]  But if we're standing with God, nothing else should matter.
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:19.360]  Because at the end of the day, if God has called us and God has pushed us in this position
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:25.360]  and God is calling us to come out and speak out against some serious evil in our generation right now.
[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:26.360]  This is our generation.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:29.360]  This is taking place right before our very eyes.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.360]  We are, I guess I'll speak for myself.
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:38.360]  I am convicted every single day to wake up and seriously expose and do everything in my power.
[01:51:38.360 --> 01:51:44.360]  Like Ezekiel said, they said, they're going to kill you if you don't shut up and he said, I can't stop.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360]  It's burning in my bones.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360]  Absolutely.
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:50.360]  They want you to do nothing and to say nothing.
[01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:51.360]  Okay.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.360]  The global elites, they're not atheists.
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.360]  They're not.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.360]  They know God is real.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.360]  They know that Satan exists.
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:03.360]  They know that these powers are at work.
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:04.360]  They know what's going to happen.
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:08.360]  The Bible talks about this in Psalms chapter two that the nations laugh.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:11.360]  They mock at God and God looks down upon them.
[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:14.360]  Like they all know what's going on.
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:19.360]  And let me raise this exactly as John the Revelator said 2000 years ago in the island of Patmos.
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:24.360]  World government, total control cannot buy or sell without this digital mark.
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:29.360]  And then everything that comes with it, it'll turn women against men, men against women, children against parents.
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.360]  Everything is perfectly described.
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:34.360]  How can you people not know this is an emergency transmission?
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.360]  This is a warning.
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:41.360]  God gives us free will, but God also gave us an owner's manual or a cheat sheet here.
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.360]  And I'll also say this.
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.360]  Okay.
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:48.360]  I'm not going to name any names, but we do have so-called Christians.
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:49.360]  Okay.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:59.360]  Self-proclaimed Christians in the world of politics, policymakers, deciders in DC that even claim to be America first.
[01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:07.360]  What I want to know is why are none of you calling out this global threat?
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.360]  Okay.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:16.360]  Why are none of these people openly and aggressively opposing people like Klaus Schwab, people and groups like the World Economic Forum?
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:23.360]  Why are these people not coming out and taking these people down just as much as the CCP?
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.360]  Okay.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:29.360]  Those are huge threats right now here in the States because these people want to see us fall.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:30.360]  I agree.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:34.360]  The CCP and the World Economic Forum are the two-headed dragon.
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:35.360]  They're huge.
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:37.360]  This is the two-headed dragon.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:39.360]  This is the threat that we're all facing right now.
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:47.360]  And what I want to see in terms of lawmakers and people that claim to love this country is, okay, the next step is what are we doing about Klaus Schwab?
[01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:50.360]  What are we doing about the World Economic Forum?
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.360]  What are we doing about Dr. Fauci?
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:55.360]  What are we doing about the World Health Organization?
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:54:02.360]  What are we doing about these so-called unelected, okay, organizations that are determining policy for Americans?
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:03.360]  And they bragged they're doing this.
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:05.360]  So what do you make of the whole McCarthy saga?
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.360]  Where do you see that going?
[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.360]  I don't think anything's going to change.
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:10.360]  I don't.
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:11.360]  I don't think anything's going to change.
[01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:13.360]  It's going to be business as usual.
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:15.360]  There's a reason why they want rhinos installed.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:20.360]  And the reason why they want rhinos installed is so that things could continue going the way that they want to go.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:24.360]  And anyone that does not see that by now, listen, Alex, you and I both know this.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:28.360]  The Uniparty is fully functional and operational right now.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:32.360]  And the globally elites in the World Economic Forum, George Soros and Klaus Schwab,
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:37.360]  they have their tentacles wrapped around all these so-called Republicans and Democrats on both sides.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.360]  No, I agree.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.360]  So why do you think Trump endorsed McCarthy?
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:46.360]  I think Trump has been advised to maybe get more moderate.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:48.360]  And I think he's even talked about that.
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:49.360]  I think we've seen that.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:55.360]  And I think what that's done to him personally is it's made him look rather weak.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:59.360]  I think, let me speak for myself.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.360]  I want to see the old Trump.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:06.360]  Like when I listen to his speeches, when I watch him talk, I'm like, where is the old Trump?
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  Where is the 2016 Trump?
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:16.360]  That base Trump that was speaking out against globalism, literally outspokenly talking about going after the deep state.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.360]  Where is that aggressive Trump that I saw in 2016?
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:26.360]  I don't know if other people agree with me on this, but what I've been watching, listen, I love what he's done.
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.360]  I'm very thankful for what he's done.
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:30.360]  And in many ways, he's changed my life with what he's done.
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:36.360]  But I think moving forward, we need that old aggressive Trump, not some moderate Trump, and more.
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:40.360]  And more, Alex, because we've crossed the threshold.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:41.360]  I totally agree.
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:42.360]  Let me talk to you about this.
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:48.360]  I think it's fair to say and disagree if you do, man, we've broken the back on their poison shots, their whole mask, their whole lockdowns.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.360]  But now we got to go forward with hearings and prosecution of Fauci.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:57.360]  But now we learn former FDA chief worked with Twitter to suppress COVID-19 Vax tweets.
[01:55:57.360 --> 01:56:02.360]  We have Pfizer board member Scott Gottlieb was a major influence on lockdown.
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:03.360]  Twitter fouls reveal.
[01:56:03.360 --> 01:56:08.360]  I mean, this is them suppressing the public consumers, blocking therapeutics.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.360]  I mean, we have them.
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:15.360]  They have been exposed 100% and more people need to wake up to that reality.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  This is why they're trying to censor everything.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.360]  This is why they want to shadow ban everybody.
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.360]  This is why they want to take down info wars because it proves it wasn't just big tech doing it.
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:33.360]  What we knew it was government and intelligence agencies and corporations pushing a poison product and suppressing its day one, knowing what they were doing.
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.360]  But they jumped the shark.
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  They look scared now.
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:39.360]  Yes, it is real corporate global fascism.
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:41.360]  This is the globally lead agenda.
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:49.360]  And what they're doing through organizations like the World Economic Forum, World Health Organization, FBI, CIA, they're all together.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:51.360]  Okay, they're all one big group.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:57.360]  They're all together and they're led and energized by Satan to push this agenda alone.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:59.360]  Humanity needs to needs to wake up.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:05.360]  This is why they want to censor the information, shadow ban and deboost everyone that's speaking out against this stuff.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  Why?
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.360]  Because they they don't want to look bad.
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:10.360]  No, they censor it because it's true.
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:12.360]  Because it's all true.
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.360]  Everything about everything we're saying is true.
[01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:16.360]  Otherwise, why would they censor it?
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:17.360]  Because it's misinformation.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.360]  But it's all been proven true.
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:22.360]  So how do they strike back now that they've been so exposed?
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:29.360]  I think they will continue because there still are a lot of people in this country, Alex, that are willing to bow the knee.
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:31.360]  There are people that are literally right now.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:33.360]  You guys can find this story later and maybe cover it.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:37.360]  There's organizations still calling for more COVID lockdowns right now in 2023.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  I saw that. Let's do a few more minutes for you to go.
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.360]  I'm going to open the phones up for callers.
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:45.360]  Hour number three, so much more coming up.

[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:58.360]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics, the injections.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:59:02.360]  To really cut us off from what God designed us to be.

[02:00:25.360 --> 02:00:29.360]  There's always going to be fallen entities that try to play God, but they're not God.
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:31.360]  And they will fail in the end.
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:32.360]  In closing, we've got five minutes left.
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:35.360]  Drew Hernandez, I just love the work you do.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:36.360]  You're one of my favorite people on air.
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:41.360]  I salute everything you're up to, the multiple shows you're doing, the investigative journalism.
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:47.360]  In the closing five minutes, you've got the floor to hit any other news areas or issues you wanted to cover.
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:58.360]  Well, right now I just want to encourage people, encourage the listeners to really pay attention to what people are saying alongside of what they do.
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:06.360]  Moving into 2023, 2024, all these so called America first politicians, people that claim to care about this country so much.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:14.360]  If these people are not actively not only speaking out against the CCP and the world economic form these two double headed dragon threats, right?
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:22.360]  If these people are not openly working against what these people are doing, we have a huge problem.
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:31.360]  Okay, and I think what that's going to do is if we put public pressure, okay, on our so called elected officials, right?
[02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:42.360]  If we put public pressure, even on conservative media, I take issue with this as well, is why are we not addressing the obvious elephant in the room?
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:45.360]  And you got to ask yourself, who's on the payroll?
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:48.360]  Okay, who's on the World Economic Forum website?
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.360]  Who's in support of the World Economic Forum?
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.360]  I don't care if they got an R by their name.
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.360]  I don't care if they claim they're America first.
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.360]  That's a problem, okay?
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:02.360]  Because America first means we put America over anybody because God has given us this and this is our home.
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:03.360]  This is our country.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.360]  We can't sell it out to the CCP.
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:09.360]  Klaus Schwab does not make decisions for my life.
[02:02:09.360 --> 02:02:14.360]  Okay, Bill Gates is not overlord of the universe in the United States of America.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:17.360]  That spirit of freedom and patriotism.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:25.360]  Okay, it has to continue and it must live on and it must go on because we're entering into an era where you have this.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:32.360]  This technocracy mixed with corporate fascism, the global elites that are operating from the top down with their proxies,
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:38.360]  like Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates and these people that they use to infiltrate society.
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.360]  We need to push back on that culturally.
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:43.360]  We need to push back on that politically.
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:45.360]  We need to push back that in our media.
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:53.360]  Okay, I'll tell you right now, if people are not covering what's going on in Davos next week, I find that very sus.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:58.360]  Because why are we not paying attention to a group of people meeting with,
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:04.360]  I think the report was like 200 world leaders or something like people that are going to determine policy for the entire world
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:07.360]  and who's at the middle of it, quarterbacking it all.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:12.360]  Klaus Schwab in the World Economic Forum making recommendations on how you should rule your country.
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:14.360]  Who the hell are you? Who elected you?
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:21.360]  No, no, no, because these people believe in a new world order, global communism, globalism
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:30.360]  and all of this is only accomplished if you do not have any human autonomy, any nationalism.
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.360]  Okay, whatever country you come from, this is why they want to remove all that.
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:41.360]  You will be removed because you stand in the way, but you will not be removed if you stand your ground.
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  You will be removed in their eyes because you stand in their way, but you will not be removed if you stand your ground.
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:52.360]  And right now, 2023, 2024, I'm not calling for violence.
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:56.360]  What I'm saying is stand your ground against these people.
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:58.360]  Do not be afraid to be canceled.
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:01.360]  Do not be afraid to be slandered or demonized.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:02.360]  It's already happening.
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:05.360]  Okay, those weapons don't even work anymore anyways.
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:07.360]  Now they're looking New Zealand.
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.360]  Now they're telling their own residents, oh, you should watch your neighbors and make sure they're not radicalized
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  because they might be domestic terrorists.
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.360]  Oh, well, what are some of the symptoms the New Zealand government says?
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:25.360]  Oh, well, one of the things you can identify if they're terrorist is if they have issue with COVID lockdowns or they're anti-vax.
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:30.360]  Okay, these words are buzz words that they're using to shut down people that love freedom.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.360]  And because they're losing and they're scared.
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.360]  DrewHLive.com.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.360]  We love you, brother.
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:37.360]  People are going to find all the great shows and work you're doing.
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:38.360]  Please come and studio soon.
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:39.360]  I want to work with you again.
[02:04:39.360 --> 02:04:41.360]  We've done on the border and so much more.
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:43.360]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:44.360]  Let's do it.
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.360]  All right, there goes Drew Hernandez.
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:49.360]  Wow, that was a powerful interview.
[02:04:49.360 --> 02:04:50.360]  I'm going to come back.
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:51.360]  I'm going to give the number out.
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.360]  I'm going to go right to your phone calls.
[02:04:53.360 --> 02:04:56.360]  We've got other breaking news and information back in 60 seconds.
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:25.360]  Stay with us.
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:55.360]  I'm going to go right to your phone calls.
[02:05:55.360 --> 02:06:01.360]  You've got me for the rest of your miserable lives.
[02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:03.360]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:11.360]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:16.360]  Man, I tell you, if you just joined us that last hour of every man does, it was just amazing.
[02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:20.360]  That guy, it's got the spirit, the forces with him.
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:23.360]  All right, I want to give the number out for long time callers.
[02:06:23.360 --> 02:06:25.360]  First time callers agree, disagree.
[02:06:25.360 --> 02:06:26.360]  You name it.
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:33.360]  All I ask is you have a clean phone line rate and make your point move the next person and dispense with the pleasantries as they say.
[02:06:33.360 --> 02:06:38.360]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789.
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:42.360]  Alex, 877-789-2539.
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:46.360]  Some international callers can't call a toll free number.
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:57.360]  We have country code 01512-646-1776 or country code 512-646-1776.
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:06:59.360]  Okay.
[02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:01.360]  It broke last night.
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:10.360]  Biden is vice president, went to set up his foundation at Penn State and he had a bunch of documents and we now know what they are.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:22.360]  It's being revealed, being reported that US intelligence materials related to Ukraine and Iran and UK found in Biden's private offices, sources tell CNN.
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:23.360]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:29.360]  A vice president cannot declassify or have secret documents unless he has a presidential letter for each document.
[02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:30.360]  So it's a felony.
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:32.360]  Trump had it all legal.
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:37.360]  But of course the media is spinning it like it is no big deal.
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:40.360]  Now there's a big article on infowars.com about this.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:41.360]  It's huge.
[02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:43.360]  Tomorrow especially.
[02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:49.360]  We're going to be covering this a lot next week when the Davos Group is meeting the public arm of the UN and the Bilderberg Group.
[02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:50.360]  We'll be playing clips.
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:56.360]  We'll be covering it live next week as we expose the corporate global government.
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:59.360]  Breaking Davos 2023 guest list leak.
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:14.360]  Globals preparing final phase of great reset takeover, Jamie White wrote it at the director, Chris Ray, the CEO of Amazon, BlackRock and Pfizer and top officials at the Gate Foundation and the Soros Network are on the list.
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:22.360]  A list of attendees of the World Economic Forum's annual Davos Summit has leaked and just about every globalist figure you'd expect is on the roster.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:25.360]  That's where the corporations buy off the politicians to give them their orders.
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:34.360]  The list notes that some 50 heads of state governments have already confirmed their participation in the annual meeting and it's expected to raise to more than 60.
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:54.360]  The list includes some of the most powerful names in government finance business on our planet, including FBI Director Chris Ray to make sure the deep state can commit all the crimes at once and persecutes the patriots, the CEO of Amazon, BlackRock and Pfizer, top officials at the Gates Foundation, Soros Network and heads of the New York Times and NBC Universal.
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:09:05.360]  Biden's climate envoy John Kerry, European Central Bank President Christine Legrand, World Health Organization Director General Tedros, and it goes on from there.
[02:09:05.360 --> 02:09:12.360]  CNN, Free Zarkaria, Fox News, Maria Barton Armo, and is also on the list.
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.360]  And it just continues on.
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:24.360]  Here is the full list linked to the article on infowars.com, you can see all of this for yourself.
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:30.360]  Zelensky to speak at World Economic Forum alongside NATO chief, CNN anchor.
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:33.360]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:35.360]  It's all on infowars.com.
[02:09:35.360 --> 02:09:46.360]  I hope you'll share it with people to expose the corporate fascists that launched the bio attack, that launched the poison shots and so much more against humanity.
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:49.360]  Now, I mentioned this earlier in the first hour, but never got to it.
[02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:55.360]  It's Tucker Carlson talking about how he was censored the documents now show.
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:04.360]  According to Louisiana Attorney General that sued and got the documents for simply saying immunity is better than a shot or the shot isn't needed for children.
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:07.360]  Our children aren't dying from COVID. All that was true.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:16.360]  But here is Tucker Carlson talking about the fact that he was censored along with so many others.
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:19.360]  But thank God this is coming out. Here it is.
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:24.360]  It was never really a secret that there were huge problems with the COVID shots.
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  And we knew this because the Biden administration's own VAERS database indicated that from the beginning.
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:32.360]  A lot of people were being injured.
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.360]  But the media suppressed that news.
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:39.360]  We tried to point it out more than a year ago, not because we have a problem with vaccines or anti-vaxxers,
[02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:45.360]  but because if you're going to force people to take something, you probably ought to know what it is and what effects it might have.
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:49.360]  That's the most basic right of all to know that what goes into your body.
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:51.360]  To know something about it.
[02:10:51.360 --> 02:10:56.360]  But in trying to say that we were censored and now we know we were censored directly by the White House.
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:02.360]  In April of 2021, the White House's director of digital strategy, a character called Rob Flaherty,
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.360]  sent this email to Facebook.
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:09.360]  Quote, the top post on Facebook about vaccines today is Tucker Carlson saying they don't work, he complained.
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:16.360]  He then pressured the White House pressured Facebook to follow its policy of, quote, reduction, meaning censorship.
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:23.360]  We're quoting, if reduction means pumping our most vaccine has an audience with Tucker Carlson saying it doesn't work, then I'm not sure it's reduction.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.360]  In other words, censor more.
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:31.360]  The Facebook employee responded by promising that the company was, quote, running this down now.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:36.360]  We asked Rob Flaherty to join us tonight to explain, but of course he's a coward and he won't.
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:43.360]  So we only know this, by the way, because of a lawsuit from the attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri.
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:51.360]  So now let's just play one of the dozens of clips of children dying in the US that make the news after they take the shot.
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:56.360]  Here's a clip, 16-year-old girl dies, collapses of heart attack while playing flag football.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:58.360]  16-year-old girl, here it is.
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:00.360]  Top story now at four.
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:05.360]  A local student athlete has died after a medical emergency during a flag football game.
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:11.360]  She's been identified as 16-year-old Asari Hughes, a sophomore at Desert Oasis High School.
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:17.360]  In Fox 5's Danny Mastin, speaking with family members this afternoon who tell us exactly what happened.
[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:19.360]  Danny.
[02:12:19.360 --> 02:12:27.360]  Kim and John, I spoke with Asari's dad on the phone today who tells me she had a heart problem but had been cleared to play.
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  Her dad, of course, confused, frustrated and devastated by his daughter's passing.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:39.360]  Asari's dad tells me Asari has always had a love and passion for football.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:44.360]  She first started playing flag football at Centennial High School before coming to Desert Oasis.
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:49.360]  She showed initial signs of heart problems at her first game at Desert Oasis.
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:54.360]  She went to the doctors and cardiologists cleared her to play at last night's game.
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:01.360]  When playing at that game, Asari's dad tells me she started to feel tired and was experiencing chest problems.
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.360]  She went to sit down and that is when she collapsed.
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:07.360]  She wasn't breathing and did not have a pulse.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:11.360]  A nurse from the stands performed CPR and used a defibrillator.
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:18.360]  Which prompted Asari's heart to start beating again, but when arriving to the hospital, she passed.
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:21.360]  Understandably, her classmates are grieving this loss.
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:27.360]  We spoke with students from Desert Oasis today who say the mood at school has been somber.
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:29.360]  People feel sorrow.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:33.360]  They shut down all the practices in my games.
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:41.360]  Actually, I've heard selfishness come from people because I heard a football player like, why do they cancel practice?
[02:13:41.360 --> 02:13:46.360]  I'm like, let's not worry about something. That girl just lost her life.
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:52.360]  Alright, so listen to that carefully. She obviously has been injected.
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:55.360]  We have all the numbers. We know it's exploding everywhere.
[02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:58.360]  So she suddenly gets a new heart problem.
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:01.360]  Goes to the doctor and says, you're fine. Go ahead and play.
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:03.360]  There's microcarditis. Her heart's been damaged.
[02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:06.360]  She goes back out, dies.
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.360]  Because they're told to tell you there's no problem.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.360]  We have the insurance company numbers in every country that took the shots.
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:17.360]  At least a 13% increase overall in death.
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:20.360]  The highest record number of deaths ever.
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:23.360]  And it's in young people. Heart attacks.
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:26.360]  Here's a Canadian reporter. You see these every day now.
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:29.360]  Passing on on TV. You never saw this before.
[02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:32.360]  You never saw this, but now it's everywhere.
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:35.360]  But they're telling you, yeah, microcarditis is way up. Heart attacks are way up,
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:37.360]  but it's not the shot.
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:40.360]  But it was an unapproved injection. Here's the video.
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:45.360]  Has come just a week before the third anniversary.
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:49.360]  Well, people we spoke with say they were happy that something is being done,
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:53.360]  but this is something that they've been asking for since day one.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.360]  So for them, this is about a thousand days too late.
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:02.360]  Now, never mind. I'm looking at after the day.
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:09.360]  Families are pushing feds to, pushing the feds to.
[02:15:09.360 --> 02:15:15.360]  Sorry, I'm not feeling very well right now.
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:17.360]  And I'm about to.
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.360]  Okay, we'll come back.
[02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  Make sure that Jessica, you are doing okay.
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:23.360]  She goes out and falls over.
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:24.360]  We will.
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:26.360]  Yeah, she falls over. They cut the club.
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:28.360]  Now, a lot of this is 5G. Let's be clear.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:32.360]  5G is the most powerful system they've got,
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:37.360]  and it affects the heart in major studies and the lungs.
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.360]  So we're going to come back, go to your phone, call straight ahead.
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:42.360]  But this is it.
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:45.360]  We have lived to the point of the mass world government calling.
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:47.360]  The mass killing has begun. We're still on air.
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.360]  I don't know how long I've done the best job I can.
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.360]  I know you have as losers as well.
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:57.360]  But let's just keep fighting, folks. Stay with us.
[02:16:23.360 --> 02:16:28.360]  And we came out many years ago with Real Red Pill Plus,
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.360]  that has all the documented compounds, like preglonone,
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:35.360]  and so much more to supercharge your body.
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:40.360]  And to give your body the key elements and the key ingredients
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:43.360]  it needs to function at a proper level.
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:46.360]  This is the answer to the New World Order's tyranny.
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.360]  This is Real Red Pill Plus sold out for two years,
[02:16:49.360 --> 02:16:54.360]  50% off at infowarstore.com.

[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:26.360]  I've been so many opportunities because of this man
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:28.360]  and because of this platform.
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:31.360]  And I would probably not even be half of where I am right now
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:32.360]  if it weren't for Alex Jones.
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:35.360]  I mean, I've been able to be on podcasts with Alex and Joe Rogan
[02:17:35.360 --> 02:17:38.360]  and Tim Cass, the super Tim Cass IRL.
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:41.360]  Listen, what I'm saying is do not take Alex Jones
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:43.360]  and Band-Aid video for granted
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:46.360]  because you don't know what you have until it's gone.
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:49.360]  We need to support free speech systems right now.
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:51.360]  So go check out the store, go support their store,
[02:17:51.360 --> 02:17:54.360]  go support info wars, leave a donation right now.
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:58.360]  Don't wait until they're gone.
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:01.360]  I have an extremely important message to all of my fellow
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:04.360]  info warriors here in the United States and around the world.
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:09.360]  We are so excited to announce Info Wars MD.

[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:18.360]  that no one else is getting
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:20.360]  because they want to support info wars
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:21.360]  to keep us on the air.
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:23.360]  This deal has been a year in the making

[02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:28.360]  We are back live going right to your phone calls.
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:30.360]  I'll be hosting a little bit the next hour
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:33.360]  that a special guest toast takes over from Australia.
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:36.360]  Look forward to talking to Chase and Duncan and Sabix
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:39.360]  and Millie and Aaron and Martin and Carlos
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:42.360]  and Steve and Joe and Ryan and so many others.
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:46.360]  Remember what we're doing, the enemy hates above all else
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.360]  because the globalists are not all powerful.
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:50.360]  No one knows who first said it decades ago on the internet,
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:51.360]  but it's true.
[02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:54.360]  The propaganda would not be necessary
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:58.360]  if the situation was hopeless.
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:00.360]  If the situation was hopeless,
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:02.360]  the propaganda would not be necessary.
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:04.360]  I'm not that smart a guy.
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:06.360]  I don't have magical powers, but I love freedom
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.360]  and I can study history.
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:11.360]  And in 28 years on air, together,
[02:21:11.360 --> 02:21:15.360]  we have devastated the New World Order.
[02:21:15.360 --> 02:21:17.360]  I intend to go on devastating them,
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:19.360]  but I can't do without your help
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:21.360]  plus we sell great products you need.
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:23.360]  Today's the last day to get vitamin mineral fusion
[02:21:23.360 --> 02:21:25.360]  and DNA force plus 50% off.
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:26.360]  It's going to go back to full price
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.360]  for the next few weeks until it sells out.
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:30.360]  It'll be months and months until we get more in
[02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:32.360]  if we're able to stay on air.
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:33.360]  That's really up to you.
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:34.360]  You need DNA force plus.
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:35.360]  It's incredible for your telomeres,
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:36.360]  your immune system, your body,
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:38.360]  for cell repair, for mitochondria,
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:40.360]  for telomere repair.
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:43.360]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:45.360]  Vitamin mineral fusion also 50% off.
[02:21:45.360 --> 02:21:48.360]  Today is the last day, the absolute last day.
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:51.360]  Real red pill plus came in, but a limited supply.
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:53.360]  We already sold out a most of it despite that.
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:56.360]  It's 50% off and we got a big shipment in
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:22:00.360]  of down and out, our super strong organic sleep aid
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:04.360]  with a big dose of melatonin and valerian root
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:07.360]  and so much more deep clean rest will sleep.
[02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:08.360]  It's not competition with knockout
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:09.360]  and stuff.
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:10.360]  Knockout's crazy.
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:11.360]  It's not as strong.
[02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:12.360]  And for some folks, you're going to want a knockout
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:13.360]  and you're not going to want down and out
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:14.360]  because they're two different formulas.
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:16.360]  They're both available.
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.360]  40% off, infowarsstore.com.
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:19.360]  I want to thank you all for the support.
[02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:22.360]  Okay, without further ado, let's go to the phone calls.
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:24.360]  Chase the Patriot from California.
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:26.360]  You're on the air with the huge floods
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:27.360]  and everything you're dealing with.
[02:22:27.360 --> 02:22:29.360]  How are you doing?
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:31.360]  Hey, I tell you, there is quite a few floods.
[02:22:31.360 --> 02:22:33.360]  My mom lives in Avila Beach, actually,
[02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:36.360]  and the roads at the 101 freeway
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:37.360]  are completely covered with water.
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:39.360]  Oh, listen, I had a personal friend I called this morning
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:41.360]  that lives in Hollywood and he said
[02:22:41.360 --> 02:22:43.360]  that he can't even get out of his house
[02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:45.360]  more than 100 feet.
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:46.360]  That's right.
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:47.360]  It's coming down.
[02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:49.360]  And I tell you, we've been in a drought for a few years,
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:51.360]  so I'll take all the rain we could get.
[02:22:51.360 --> 02:22:53.360]  But I wanted to talk, you know, I've been listening to the show
[02:22:53.360 --> 02:22:55.360]  and I got the good, bad, the ugly,
[02:22:55.360 --> 02:22:57.360]  classic Western in the background.
[02:22:57.360 --> 02:22:59.360]  So I got a few quick points for you.
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:00.360]  First, the good.
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:02.360]  Now, we got McCarthy and his speaker,
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:03.360]  and that's not good necessarily,
[02:23:03.360 --> 02:23:06.360]  but at least we don't have the Democrats in control
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:07.360]  because here's the bad.
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:10.360]  His district was dissolved from Nunez.
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:14.360]  Congressman Nunez, it was, you know, America first
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:16.360]  when California Exodus started,
[02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:18.360]  everybody started leaving the state
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:20.360]  because they hate the policies here.
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:22.360]  They lost a seat in the representatives
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:23.360]  for the first time ever.
[02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:26.360]  And so they dissolved that seat into McCarthy
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:29.360]  and Valadeo, who was one of the 10 Republicans
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:32.360]  devoted for impeachment of President Trump.
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:34.360]  So it gets pretty deep there,
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:36.360]  the ugliness of that swamp.
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:38.360]  But let's get to the ugly now.
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:40.360]  We've also seen the censorship
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:42.360]  and lawfare has been at next level,
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:44.360]  especially targeting you.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:45.360]  And now we see some of the proof
[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:46.360]  coming out of the Twitter files.
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:48.360]  So everybody needs to get out there,
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:51.360]  support info wars, go buy the book.
[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:52.360]  I bought the book.
[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:53.360]  It's awesome.
[02:23:53.360 --> 02:23:55.360]  And, you know, I'm getting into the details
[02:23:55.360 --> 02:23:57.360]  of all the different documents.
[02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:00.360]  And it's a great way to inform other people as well
[02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:02.360]  about what's really going on in the world
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:05.360]  with these lockdowns and these shots and everything else.
[02:24:05.360 --> 02:24:07.360]  I totally agree with you.
[02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:09.360]  And look, I'm not defending McCarthy.
[02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:10.360]  I didn't want him in there.
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:13.360]  But Roger still predicted that six months before this happened,
[02:24:13.360 --> 02:24:16.360]  he said a razor thin Republican victory
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:19.360]  will mean that that 20 or so, 25 patriots
[02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:21.360]  will be able to control the whole agenda,
[02:24:21.360 --> 02:24:22.360]  like Mnuchin controls the Senate.
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:23.360]  And we're seeing that.
[02:24:23.360 --> 02:24:25.360]  So now it really falls to Matt Gaetz
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:26.360]  and MTG and others.
[02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:30.360]  Will they deliver on the agenda they promised?
[02:24:30.360 --> 02:24:31.360]  Exactly.
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:32.360]  And this sexy example as well
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:35.360]  is maybe we can do something similar in the Senate
[02:24:35.360 --> 02:24:37.360]  where it wouldn't take so many people,
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.360]  but if we got a good five or six
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.360]  to go in there with Rand Paul and others,
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:42.360]  maybe they can lock it down.
[02:24:42.360 --> 02:24:43.360]  That's right.
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.360]  Well, we know we can't give up.
[02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:45.360]  We know we can't give up.
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:46.360]  The swamps definitely scared.
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.360]  They pulled out all the stops.
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:49.360]  They've committed incredible crimes,
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:50.360]  try to stay in power.
[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:52.360]  They've revealed themselves, folks.
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:54.360]  People say, well, why do you keep fighting?
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:55.360]  They just get more evil
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:57.360]  because it's going to show their hand.
[02:24:57.360 --> 02:24:58.360]  That's right.
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:00.360]  And Alex, I got one question for you.
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:02.360]  If you take it, I've got a cousin who works all day.
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:03.360]  He listens to your show.
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:04.360]  If you can just give a shout out.
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:07.360]  Thanks for listening to Eli and make his day right now.
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:08.360]  I appreciate everything you do.
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:09.360]  Thank you.
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:10.360]  Thank you, Chase.
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:12.360]  Eli, thanks for listening.
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:13.360]  We love you.
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:14.360]  You are the Paul Revere.
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:16.360]  Please tell everybody to tune in, Eli,
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:20.360]  to M4 Wars to get what's really going on.
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:24.360]  Ryan in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.360]  Hey, Alex.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:28.360]  I just wanted to go over a couple of things.
[02:25:28.360 --> 02:25:30.360]  I've been following politics a long time.
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.360]  And the one thing I'm certain of is that timing is everything.
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:36.360]  It's really curious that, you know,
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:38.360]  Joe Biden's about to announce his presidency.
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:41.360]  And then all of a sudden we see this announcement.
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.360]  Oh, he's got documented.
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:43.360]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:44.360]  No, the deep state's done with him.
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:46.360]  They want him to step down.
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:47.360]  Absolutely.
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:48.360]  That's why they're bringing out Hunter and stuff.
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:50.360]  They wouldn't let it out two years ago in the election.
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:52.360]  But now they're totally what I saw this morning.
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:55.360]  I meant to say that they're bringing this out to try to get
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:56.360]  Biden to step down.
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:59.360]  Yeah, it seems like a checkmate set up to me.
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:00.360]  I agree.
[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:01.360]  So who are they planning?
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:03.360]  I think it's Gavin Newsom.
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:05.360]  Yeah, I think it's Gavin Newsom as well.
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:08.360]  He keeps saying them trot him out.
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:10.360]  I mean, these people are so fake.
[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:12.360]  I don't understand how the left...
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:13.360]  Well, they love to lie.
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:14.360]  They have nothing but a stain.
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:16.360]  So the fact he says he'll never run for president,
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.360]  you know he is.
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:20.360]  Yeah, but it's also why now?
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:23.360]  I mean, we've had, you know, so much corruption surrounding
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:24.360]  the Biden family.
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:26.360]  Why now?
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:30.360]  Well, because exactly, Biden's getting big for his britches.
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:33.360]  And they know he'll never survive into the next term.
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:36.360]  So they're ready to get rid of him now.
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:38.360]  Yeah, that's what it seems like to me.
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:39.360]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:40.360]  Thank you for everything you do.
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:41.360]  No, thank you.
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:43.360]  But I mean, just like Ryan's as smart as I am.
[02:26:43.360 --> 02:26:46.360]  I mean, you know, Ryan totally gets what's going on here.
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:48.360]  I just lost audio to my headset.
[02:26:48.360 --> 02:26:49.360]  I must have...
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:50.360]  Oh, there it is.
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:51.360]  It just came back.
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:53.360]  I'm like slapping my headset receiver box and like
[02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:55.360]  knocking it off myself.
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:56.360]  It's not the crew's fault.
[02:26:56.360 --> 02:26:59.360]  I'm like slapped it and just stopped working.
[02:26:59.360 --> 02:27:01.360]  I'm so excited talking to college.
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:03.360]  Oh, like flailing around.
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:04.360]  Let's go to Jeff in Canada.
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:05.360]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:06.360]  Welcome.
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:07.360]  Hi, Alex.
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:08.360]  Love you.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:09.360]  Love your team.
[02:27:09.360 --> 02:27:10.360]  Love what you guys do.
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:11.360]  Love you, too.
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:14.360]  First, I wanted to make a suggestion for a guest, and that's
[02:27:14.360 --> 02:27:17.360]  Daniel Estuland to go over the...
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:20.360]  I've been trying to get Daniel Estuland on for five years.
[02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.360]  And if you can get him on, I'd appreciate it.
[02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:26.360]  He's a great mind, amazing researcher.
[02:27:26.360 --> 02:27:28.360]  We want Daniel Estuland.
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:31.360]  Okay, and I wanted to ask you if you could play a clip from
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:35.360]  your seminal film Endgame, and that's the bullhorn scene where
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:40.360]  you're bullhorning the Bilderberg group up in their ivory tower.
[02:27:40.360 --> 02:27:43.360]  And I think that's at the point where they basically figured
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:46.360]  out who Alex Jones was and the power that you had.
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:49.360]  And I think that speech is probably the most important
[02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.360]  speech you ever gave in your life.
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:52.360]  And that's all I got.
[02:27:52.360 --> 02:27:53.360]  Thanks.
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:54.360]  It's funny you say that.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.360]  There have been times in my life, four or five of them.
[02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:02.360]  Where I spiritually crossed a Rubicon and I could feel the
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:05.360]  enemy's spirit not wanting me to make that move.
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:10.360]  And when I gave that speech and I said those things and they
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:15.360]  freaked out and sent out like the U.S.
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:19.360]  ambassador to the U.N. who died like a year later of a heart
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:22.360]  attack, forget his name.
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:26.360]  They sent him out to talk to me, and once they saw me, they
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:29.360]  walked up to me and I kept yelling because they were, and
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:31.360]  they said I'll screw you and just didn't have the nerve to do
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:32.360]  it.
[02:28:32.360 --> 02:28:34.360]  So at first they came marching out to talk to me.
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:36.360]  It's in the full film.
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:38.360]  And then they didn't have the nerve after.
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:40.360]  It was bizarre.
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:41.360]  Guys, go to Endgame.
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:43.360]  We have a digital copy here, but it's online everywhere.
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:45.360]  And it's like in the middle of the film.
[02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:48.360]  It's a two and a half hour film where I, my bullhorn, it will
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:52.360]  start the fourth hour with that since you mentioned.
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:54.360]  I mean, it was a moment.
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:58.360]  And I felt that I crossed a threshold.
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:00.360]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:02.360]  You want to stop their globalist agenda?
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:03.360]  Well, so do I.
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.360]  And I've been the most affected individual in the fight
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:07.360]  against the globalist.
[02:29:07.360 --> 02:29:10.360]  And I've got their number and I know how to bring them down.
[02:29:10.360 --> 02:29:14.360]  But, ladies and gentlemen, I can't do it without your support.
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:18.360]  And the good news is we're only under about $200,000 a month.
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:21.360]  The bad news is the enemy is intensifying their attacks on
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:24.360]  every front, but I'm not going to back down and I'll never give up,
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:25.360]  but I could give out.
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:27.360]  So please keep me on the field.
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:29.360]  Keep me on the front lines against the enemy while getting great
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:32.360]  products at the same time that will empower you and your family.

[02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:34.360]  And over the course of the next couple of years, I got my health back

[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.360]  They're all absolutely amazing supplements.

[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.360]  But anyway, so the point is we have to get ourselves clean.
[02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:49.360]  We have to break free of the globalist system.
[02:32:49.360 --> 02:32:53.360]  And the only way to do that is to take our own health into our own hands.
[02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:54.360]  Beautifully said, brother.
[02:32:54.360 --> 02:33:23.360]  I thank you so much for calling Godspeed.
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:25.360]  Hi, everyone.
[02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:28.360]  Right back to your phone calls, but I want to talk about something.
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:33.360]  I've talked about 10 or 15 times, but most of the audience too is in a few times a week
[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:35.360]  and they miss this.
[02:33:35.360 --> 02:33:37.360]  So I now know it's beyond critical.
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:42.360]  I'm going to cut promos, ads, video reports, announcements, and flood the zone with this
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:44.360]  because I know what's happened.
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:47.360]  So I'm going to spend a minute and a half on this and go to your calls.
[02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:50.360]  And I've heard this from hundreds of people, but it happened again last night.
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:52.360]  I leave here at about five o'clock.
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:54.360]  I'm out of gas.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:34:01.360]  I pull over to gas station and I've got a problem with sweets and I go, I want an ice cream sandwich.
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:06.360]  So I go into the store and I get an ice cream sandwich while the car is gassing up.
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:11.360]  And I walk up to the man, a Hispanic gentleman, older gentleman behind the counter.
[02:34:11.360 --> 02:34:13.360]  He says, Alex, I'm a big listener of yours.
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:14.360]  I said, well, thank you.
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:15.360]  He goes, well, how's everything going?
[02:34:15.360 --> 02:34:16.360]  And I said, well, they're trying to shut us down.
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:20.360]  He goes, yeah, me and my son and others listen, but we've not been supporting you because
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:24.360]  we don't want our money going to those people that sued you.
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:27.360]  And I looked at him and I said, have you not been listening?
[02:34:27.360 --> 02:34:30.360]  I explained we have two to three years of appeals.
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:34.360]  None of the money you buy products now goes to those people.
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:37.360]  All those billion dollar numbers are made up to make you give up.
[02:34:37.360 --> 02:34:40.360]  None of the money you buy products for goes to them.
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:42.360]  He goes, well, aren't you in bankruptcy?
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:48.360]  I said, chapter 11 sub chapter five, that's a reorganization because if we didn't do that,
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:54.360]  they would be able to have the state courts put padlocks on this building and shut it down.
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:55.360]  You understand?
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:57.360]  Plus we were out of money.
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:01.360]  He goes, oh, I said, listen, don't I'm not mad at you.
[02:35:01.360 --> 02:35:02.360]  I appreciate your past support.
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:08.360]  But believe me, believe me, I could go across town and do a new show and work for somebody.
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:09.360]  But I love the crew.
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:11.360]  I love the infrastructure and the great people we've got.
[02:35:11.360 --> 02:35:13.360]  We're really effective here.
[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:16.360]  Just trust me and tune in and spread the word, sir.
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:17.360]  And we're not going away.
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:18.360]  He goes, you're not going off air.
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:21.360]  I said, no, unless you don't support.
[02:35:21.360 --> 02:35:23.360]  We get so many emails, so many calls.
[02:35:23.360 --> 02:35:26.360]  The crew hears about it all day.
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:35.360]  The money you send to buy products that are in stock rate of ship to you does not go to those people.
[02:35:35.360 --> 02:35:40.360]  Now, if they settle and I don't have much money, if they do, whatever, I'll tell you about it.
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:46.360]  Or if, if, if, if, if things go sideways and we got to shut this down, it might happen.
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:49.360]  But that's off six months in the future.
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:52.360]  The only people that can shut us down is you.
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:57.360]  None of the money that you spend buying products goes to the Democrats and them.
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:59.360]  In fact, they don't want to settle.
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:00.360]  They said they want to shut down.
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.360]  You've seen them on TV.
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:04.360]  So we have two to four years.
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:07.360]  The average is about two and a half years of appeals, maybe three.
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:08.360]  And it's all rigged.
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:10.360]  Who knows what will happen by then?
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:14.360]  We're on the verge of nuclear war.
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:17.360]  Staying on air is what matters.
[02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:22.360]  And so understand that.
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:25.360]  Even my own family thinks we're going to shut down.
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:27.360]  Even my own family thinks bankruptcy is something else.
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:29.360]  There's like 25 different types of bankruptcy.
[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:31.360]  We're in chapter 11, sub chapter five.
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:34.360]  We're on air like I told you six months ago when we did it.
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:35.360]  They're totally pissed we're in it.
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:39.360]  They're totally pissed the truth that I have no extra money is coming out.
[02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:41.360]  Because their big lives have been multiple.
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:44.360]  They've been that, oh, I got hundreds of millions of dollars total lie.
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:48.360]  Or, or, oh, you know, all the rest of stuff so that you don't support.
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:49.360]  What are their lawyers saying?
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:50.360]  Texas and Connecticut.
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:53.360]  Democrat party operatives run by Senator Blymouth all when they get on TV.
[02:36:53.360 --> 02:36:55.360]  They say, don't give him money.
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:56.360]  Don't bet on him.
[02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:00.360]  He's going down because they want the show shut down and they hate the idea
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:03.360]  of grassroots supporting people.
[02:37:03.360 --> 02:37:05.360]  I'll be the first person.
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:08.360]  If we're going to get it shut down, it'll take a months and months.
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:12.360]  If that even the court decides that to tell you, I will give you the truth.
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:19.360]  100% on my soul on my children that you've been given nothing but the truth.
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:21.360]  I see through a rose color darkly.
[02:37:21.360 --> 02:37:24.360]  I make mistakes, but I'm 99% accurate when it comes to this stuff.
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:28.360]  95% when it comes to news and people know that that's why they hate me because
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:30.360]  there's real people in the universe folks.
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:31.360]  There's not just evil people.
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:32.360]  I'm real.
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  I'm 100% real.
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:35.360]  I love being real.
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:36.360]  It's everything I am.
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:37.360]  It's my identity.
[02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:38.360]  It's my identity.
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:41.360]  So as long as you buy products at infowarestore.com that empower you and
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:44.360]  enrich you, we're going to stay on air.
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:48.360]  And if it gets to the point where I've got to go work someplace else and I've got
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:52.360]  a bunch of offers, I'm going to say, okay, you've got to bring my crew with me.
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.360]  And I'll take a third of the money I'd get.
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:38:00.360]  I've got $5 million offers a year on the table right now to go work for other
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:03.360]  people and say whatever I want.
[02:38:03.360 --> 02:38:07.360]  $5 million won't bring my whole crew over.
[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:09.360]  And that's why I'm here.
[02:38:09.360 --> 02:38:11.360]  And it's not like, oh, you're so good.
[02:38:11.360 --> 02:38:13.360]  These people have stood with me.
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:14.360]  These people are my friends.
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:15.360]  These people put up with me.
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:21.360]  I love these people like I love my right arm or my fricking heart.
[02:38:21.360 --> 02:38:23.360]  And they've stood with me.
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:24.360]  I'm standing with them.
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:32.360]  That's why I've put everything I've got into this except my house.
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:35.360]  And we're winning and God's in charge.
[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:38.360]  I said I'd do a little two minute thing on this, but that's where we're at.
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:41.360]  So that's the reality of where we are.
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:47.360]  Your money is not going to them.
[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:50.360]  By the time they try to bring us down and set up any scams they've got,
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:52.360]  every dime's going to stay on air.
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:53.360]  That's the sick joke.
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:55.360]  There is no extra money.
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:01.360]  So it's a real pleasure I have that all their lies about hundreds of millions
[02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:02.360]  of dollars aren't true.
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.360]  And I'm sworn in federal court to not have this money.
[02:39:05.360 --> 02:39:07.360]  I will go to prison if I'm lying.
[02:39:07.360 --> 02:39:09.360]  And their money's not there.
[02:39:09.360 --> 02:39:12.360]  Don't believe the enemy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:13.360]  Believe me.
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:18.360]  Because I spend every waking hour trying to focus my soul and my intellect
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:20.360]  to tell you the truth.
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:22.360]  Because let me tell you, it's easy to tell lies.
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:25.360]  It's hard to tell the truth because you've got to actually figure out
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:26.360]  what the truth is.
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:32.360]  I sit there and, man, I split hairs and I focus and I meditate and I cogitate
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:38.360]  and I just really give you everything I got to really tell you exactly
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:41.360]  what I think, exactly what I believe.
[02:39:41.360 --> 02:39:46.360]  I am the opposite of CNN and the opposite of ABC and the opposite of Joe Biden.
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:50.360]  I am a human that believes in you and believes in God and our children
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:53.360]  and I won't sell out for nobody.
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:56.360]  In fact, I love fighting evil.
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:57.360]  I love not selling out.
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:39:59.360]  I love being real.
[02:39:59.360 --> 02:40:02.360]  It burns in my bones like Ezekiel said.
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:05.360]  They can put a gun to my children's head
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:10.360]  and I cannot physically, spiritually sell you out.
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:12.360]  It is impossible.
[02:40:15.360 --> 02:40:19.360]  I can sell you out sheet on my wife, though.
[02:40:19.360 --> 02:40:23.360]  Don't do it, though. Oh, man.
[02:40:23.360 --> 02:40:26.360]  I can sell you out a lot of other ways, folks.
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  And I do sell you out by drinking too much because I'm falling and I got problems.
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:37.360]  So I'm not perfect, but I do not consciously ever sell you out.
[02:40:37.360 --> 02:40:46.360]  I never in any way do anything that is not 100% to take these people down.
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:51.360]  So don't feel sorry for me all I've gone through and think like I'm some victim.
[02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:53.360]  Oh, baby, I'm the opposite.
[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:55.360]  I want to wage war on these people.
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:00.360]  I want the ring with these people and I'm going to bring them down with God's help
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:02.360]  and I need your help to do it.
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:14.360]  The children are crying out for liberators.
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:17.360]  They're crying out for resistance.
[02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:20.360]  They're crying out for people to save them
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:25.360]  and nobody's coming if we don't listen to the Holy Spirit and if we don't do it.
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:32.360]  You're not going to find anybody more real than me except you
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:34.360]  because you know you're real.
[02:41:35.360 --> 02:41:40.360]  You know you're real and I know I'm real and the enemy knows I'm real
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:42.360]  and they're scared of the spirit we got.
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:45.360]  We've got the weapons system.
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:51.360]  We've got the deck of cards in our hands to beat these people.
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:52.360]  We don't have a hand.
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:54.360]  We have the deck.
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:41:59.360]  All we got to do is exercise and I said I'd talk about that for two minutes.
[02:41:59.360 --> 02:42:01.360]  I just talked about it for 10 minutes.
[02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:06.360]  I'm going to go to break.
[02:42:07.360 --> 02:42:09.360]  I'm going to come back with your calls.
[02:42:09.360 --> 02:42:13.360]  But we can't give up for the children and we will not give up for them
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:16.360]  and we will be victorious.
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:18.360]  I'll take every one of your phone calls before the guest host takes over.
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.360]  It may take three segments or so.
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:23.360]  But I promise you when we come out of this break I'm going to write to Duncan
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:26.360]  and everybody else in the order your calls are received.
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:30.360]  But all I'm telling you right now is if you don't bet on him for wars,
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:35.360]  you're betting against yourself and you're rolling over to these demons and letting them win.
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:38.360]  I will not roll over and die to these people.
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.360]  I will not submit to their tyranny.
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:45.360]  And I pledge my mind, my soul, my sacred honor, my treasure, my children,
[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:49.360]  everything I am in the belief in you.
[02:42:49.360 --> 02:42:54.360]  So energize yourself and energize the info war today.
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:55.360]  Spread the word.
[02:42:55.360 --> 02:43:23.360]  Come back.
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:31.360]  On the horse was named death.
[02:43:31.360 --> 02:43:37.360]  Now the translation is I looked and behold a pale horse
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:42.360]  and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him.
[02:43:42.360 --> 02:43:45.360]  The book of Revelation.
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:47.360]  Very serious times to be alive folks.
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:49.360]  They're not just doing this as a one off.
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:50.360]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:51.360]  This is our fight.
[02:43:51.360 --> 02:43:53.360]  And I'm proud of humanity.
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:54.360]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[02:43:54.360 --> 02:43:56.360]  They're very upset that they're losing
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:58.360]  and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:02.360]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[02:44:02.360 --> 02:44:07.360]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:09.360]  in any way that they deemed fit.
[02:44:09.360 --> 02:44:11.360]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:13.360]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:14.360]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:16.360]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next.
[02:44:16.360 --> 02:44:17.360]  Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon.
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:19.360]  Or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:21.360]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago,
[02:44:21.360 --> 02:44:22.360]  but on their 28 years.
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:24.360]  And I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.360]  And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:28.360]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:30.360]  And now because we've been so successful
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:31.360]  warning the population of the planet,
[02:44:31.360 --> 02:44:32.360]  not just America,
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:34.360]  we're public enemy number one
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:36.360]  when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:38.360]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:40.360]  how successful Info Wars has been
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:41.360]  because of your past support.
[02:44:41.360 --> 02:44:43.360]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[02:44:43.360 --> 02:44:44.360]  And I ask you now,
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:45.360]  the critical juncture of the battle,
[02:44:45.360 --> 02:44:46.360]  free double your efforts
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:48.360]  by visiting infowarstore.com

[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:01.360]  Info Wars secret weapon is finally here.
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:03.360]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system,
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:04.360]  for your stamina,
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:05.360]  for your energy,

[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:07.360]  for your libido.
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:10.360]  And it also keeps Info Wars on the air.
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:11.360]  And I almost forgot,
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:15.360]  you save at least 50% on these products
[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:16.360]  for what you pay
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:18.360]  for similar products or the exact same products
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:19.360]  in stores around the country.
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:21.360]  That's because we go right to the highest quality
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:22.360]  manufacturer in the nation

[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:26.360]  They then give us the best deal out there
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:27.360]  because the owner is a listener
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:29.360]  and we're able to bring it to you
[02:45:29.360 --> 02:45:30.360]  with massive discounts.
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:31.360]  You're not going to find
[02:45:31.360 --> 02:45:33.360]  1,000 milligram high quality CBD
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:35.360]  for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:36.360]  You're not going to find
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:37.360]  at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[02:45:37.360 --> 02:45:38.360]  You're not going to find
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:40.360]  two-market 95% of humanoid
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:41.360]  at the price we're selling it.
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:44.360]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:45.360]  These similar formulas
[02:45:45.360 --> 02:45:46.360]  with the same formulas
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:49.360]  sell for up to 200% more
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:50.360]  than we're selling these.
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:53.360]  Info Wars MD, now available exclusively
[02:45:53.360 --> 02:45:56.360]  at infowarstore.com, a true 360 win.
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:45:59.360]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:00.360]  we are now launching
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:02.360]  the most powerful supplements
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:03.360]  in the history of Info Wars
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:05.360]  under a new brand name,
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:07.360]  Info Wars Platinum.
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:09.360]  Now, all three of these revolutionary products
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:10.360]  you see in front of you
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:13.360]  are already number one best sellers
[02:46:13.360 --> 02:46:16.360]  in the market for the last few years
[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:17.360]  because they work so well.
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:19.360]  We've gone right to the manufacturer
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:21.360]  who are listeners, the owners of fan
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:23.360]  and they've given us this huge deal
[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:25.360]  off of retail, 40% off
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:27.360]  what these products are found for
[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:29.360]  under other names.
[02:46:29.360 --> 02:46:31.360]  And not just under one name,
[02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:33.360]  they sell these under three or four other brands
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:35.360]  that other major distributors
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:36.360]  and suppliers have put out.
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:38.360]  The difference is we have it
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:41.360]  for 40% off what it is in stores.
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:42.360]  We're talking about Pain MD.
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:45.360]  We're talking about HGH max boost.
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:48.360]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:50.360]  These things are incredible.
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:52.360]  I would suggest you take half a dose
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:53.360]  or less when you first do
[02:46:53.360 --> 02:46:55.360]  and consult your healthcare provider
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:56.360]  because they're so powerful.
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:58.360]  Get them at infowarstore.com.
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:01.360]  Leading a frontal assault
[02:47:01.360 --> 02:47:04.360]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:32.360]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:34.360]  Alright, enough of my rants.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:36.360]  Let's go right to your calls.
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:38.360]  Duncan in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:40.360]  Hey Alex, first I want to say
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:42.360]  amen to what you had to say
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:44.360]  during the last segment.
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:46.360]  Love your good heart
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:48.360]  and your loyalty to father's
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:50.360]  honest truth.
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:51.360]  Thank you, keep it up.
[02:47:51.360 --> 02:47:52.360]  Thank you brother.
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:54.360]  I wanted to talk about
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.360]  making info wars more effective.
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:58.360]  The John Birch Society has chapters
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:00.360]  all across the nation
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:03.360]  made up of committed American patriots.
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:06.360]  One thought would be partnering with them
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:08.360]  in having like a dedicated hour
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:10.360]  once or twice a week.
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:12.360]  I have had John and McManus on.
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:14.360]  I've had any time they went on.
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:16.360]  They're the ones that educated my dad.
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:18.360]  They're the ones that educated my grandfather.
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:20.360]  They're the ones that educated me.
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:22.360]  I was never part of the John Birch Society,
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:24.360]  but their materials are dead on.
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:26.360]  The most accurate they are.
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:28.360]  They are the ones that educated me.
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:30.360]  The most accurate they are.
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:32.360]  They are the only reason we've got a fighting chance.
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:34.360]  God influence them, God gets the credit.
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:36.360]  But temporarily on this planet
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:38.360]  the John Birch Society has knocked it out of the park.
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:40.360]  Amen.
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:43.360]  What about an hour once or twice a week?
[02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:45.360]  The John Birch Society can call me
[02:48:45.360 --> 02:48:48.360]  and they can have their own show every day if they want to.
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:50.360]  That's excellent.
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:52.360]  Another thought is having Sheriff Mack
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:54.360]  on regularly
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:56.360]  to activate County Sheriff.
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:48:58.360]  I agree. The County Sheriff's key
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.360]  to counter the whole Soros takeover.
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:02.360]  Amen.
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:04.360]  Also, we'd love to hear more
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:06.360]  of Joel Scalzen on your show.
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  Love Joel Scalzen.
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:10.360]  If we had the operators
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:12.360]  and people to run the shows, we'd be 24 hours a day.
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:14.360]  We don't have the money.
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:16.360]  If we had an extra
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:18.360]  $300,000, $400,000 a month,
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:20.360]  I could hire a whole crew 24 hours a day
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:22.360]  and other hosts do it all.
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:24.360]  We just never got there.
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:26.360]  Believe me, that's what's so frustrating, brother.
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:28.360]  You bet.
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:30.360]  We don't have the money.
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.360]  Having an hour where we specifically
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:34.360]  talk about taking action
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:36.360]  with help in relieving
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:38.360]  a lot of frustration.
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:40.360]  People hear about the problems.
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:42.360]  They hear about everything going on,
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:44.360]  but then not taking action
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.360]  just develops frustration.
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:48.360]  No, I hear you. I appreciate your call.
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:50.360]  I mean, be aware of the new order.
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:52.360]  Block every project at Scott's.
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:54.360]  That's what we're doing. Thank you.
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:56.360]  Savox in Washington, you're on the air.
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:58.360]  Thank you, sir.
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:00.360]  This is Savox in Seattle,
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:02.360]  previously in Fogueras,
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:04.360]  right there on a telegram.
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.360]  Call to action.
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  I don't know why I'm not seeing
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:10.360]  a Bolsonaro or a Trump
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:12.360]  event happening outside
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:14.360]  of the Melinda,
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:16.360]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:18.360]  It's empty over there.
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:20.360]  Everybody has some downtown homeless.
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:22.360]  And you show all the outside.
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:24.360]  It's really nice, nice building.
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:26.360]  Put your tent outside.
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:28.360]  Roger, I don't want
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:30.360]  to break in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:32.360]  but I think people should camp
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:34.360]  out there and we would cover it.
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:36.360]  People should go there and camp out
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:38.360]  and expose. He's behind the poison virus.
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:40.360]  He's behind the shots.
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:42.360]  He's behind it all. I agree with you.
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:44.360]  That's the thing.
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:46.360]  Peaceful process. It has to be peaceful.
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:48.360]  But also, you know,
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:50.360]  also, check out this
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:52.360]  couple of great memes.
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:54.360]  You have to check it out. Always throw
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:56.360]  your Alex Jones and Harrison Smith
[02:50:56.360 --> 02:50:58.360]  in a
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:00.360]  Avengers outfit.
[02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:02.360]  If you go to Savox, X-A,
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:04.360]  V-O-X, X-S and X-Men memes.
[02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:06.360]  It's the first meme over there, bro.
[02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:08.360]  It's my tribute to you guys,
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:10.360]  but yeah.
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:12.360]  Slow down. Where do we find
[02:51:12.360 --> 02:51:14.360]  this meme you did?
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:16.360]  It's called
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:18.360]  Savox in Telegram.
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:20.360]  X-A, X-S and X-S.
[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:22.360]  X-A-V-O-X.
[02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:24.360]  Love it. We'll check out Savox
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:26.360]  on Telegram. We'll put it on the screen of the crew.
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:28.360]  Find anything else?
[02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:30.360]  And also,
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:32.360]  thank you for the products.
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:34.360]  Thank you for
[02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:36.360]  sharing the work. We're still working on
[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:38.360]  Greg Reese's reports and some of the info
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:40.360]  wars through the Spanish side.
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:42.360]  Again, we used to do the Infoguerras
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:44.360]  channel, but I had to change it to my own
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:46.360]  since I don't have the Infoguerras
[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:48.360]  official, you know.
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:50.360]  We love you.
[02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:52.360]  People take everything we do, put it in Spanish.
[02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:54.360]  We love you. Thank you, sir.
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:56.360]  Let's talk to Aaron Illinois. You're on the air.
[02:51:56.360 --> 02:51:58.360]  Aaron, go ahead.
[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:00.360]  Hey, Alex. Since you covered
[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:02.360]  or since you mentioned Bill Gates owning
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:04.360]  the most farmland in the USA,
[02:52:04.360 --> 02:52:06.360]  let's cover exactly what has grown
[02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:08.360]  on his farmland.
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:10.360]  So at the time of this article from June
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:12.360]  2021 from NBC News,
[02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:14.360]  Alex owns roughly
[02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:16.360]  108,000 acres of farmland
[02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:18.360]  in the United States.
[02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:20.360]  In that, it's 14,000
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:22.360]  acres of farmland in Washington
[02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:24.360]  that includes potato fields
[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:26.360]  so massive that they're
[02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:28.360]  visible from space. These potatoes
[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:30.360]  supply McDonald's, Alex, which are
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:32.360]  used for French fries.
[02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:34.360]  Bill Gates also owns the soil that the
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:36.360]  potatoes are grown in.
[02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:38.360]  And I just want to say
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:40.360]  next time you put a Mickey D's French
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:42.360]  in your mouth, think of Bill Gates
[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:44.360]  in his pink sweater and realize that
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:46.360]  you're taking Gates into your body.
[02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:48.360]  Also, if you pick up a carrot or onion
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:50.360]  at the supermarket, chances are
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:52.360]  that it was grown by Bill Gates.
[02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:54.360]  What do you say, Alex?
[02:52:54.360 --> 02:52:56.360]  No, I totally agree. I wouldn't eat
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:58.360]  anything that guy produces.
[02:52:58.360 --> 02:53:00.360]  No, exactly. We just need to tell
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:02.360]  everyone you know that if they care
[02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:04.360]  about their health and it's like
[02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:06.360]  why would you trust king of vaccines
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:08.360]  to feed the masses, you know?
[02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:10.360]  Well, why would you trust the guy that
[02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:12.360]  says he wants to depopulate you
[02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:14.360]  with taking a shot in your body?
[02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:16.360]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:18.360]  So, yeah, let's just spread
[02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:20.360]  that word and thank you very much, Alex,
[02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:22.360]  for all you do. God bless you. Thank you, Aaron.
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:24.360]  We love you. We appreciate you so much. Joe
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:26.360]  in Florida, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:28.360]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:30.360]  First, I'd like to say that
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:32.360]  your product, the BrainForce Ultra
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:34.360]  is a great product.
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:36.360]  And I work hard all day
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:38.360]  and when I need energy at night
[02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:40.360]  to, when I need to
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:42.360]  be able to have a little extra energy
[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:44.360]  but not stay up all night
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:46.360]  to play guitar or
[02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:48.360]  to help fight the New World Order
[02:53:48.360 --> 02:53:50.360]  on social media or just read a book.
[02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:52.360]  I love taking that product.
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:54.360]  Exactly, because if my wife wants to go out
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:56.360]  to dinner like seven o'clock at night,
[02:53:56.360 --> 02:53:58.360]  we got a nanny or whatever.
[02:53:58.360 --> 02:54:00.360]  I don't want to drink coffee. I sit for five, six hours.
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:02.360]  I don't want to take, but
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:04.360]  this particular product acts really quick
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:06.360]  because it goes away in three hours.
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:08.360]  That's why BrainForce Ultra is so special.
[02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:10.360]  It really is an amazing product.
[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:12.360]  It's unique because it's a sublingual
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:14.360]  effect and that allows it
[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:16.360]  to kick in quickly and then fade off quicker.
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:18.360]  Absolutely.
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:20.360]  I wanted to tell you
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:22.360]  an original idea
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:24.360]  or story, if you will, that
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:26.360]  I haven't heard any of the doctors or scientists
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:28.360]  talk about that you've spoken with.
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:30.360]  And
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:32.360]  well, in April
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:34.360]  2016
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:36.360]  of 2021
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:38.360]  the FDA banned
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:40.360]  or they recalled
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:42.360]  BAMlanavibMab
[02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:48.360]  that is a monoclonal
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:50.360]  antibody treatment.
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:52.360]  And why is that significant?
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:54.360]  Well,
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:56.360]  people have talked a lot about ADE
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:54:58.360]  from the vaccines,
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:00.360]  but I haven't heard anybody mention
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:02.360]  it.
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:04.360]  It's antibody dependent enhancement.
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:08.360]  The antibodies that are
[02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:10.360]  in the monoclonal antibodies
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:12.360]  can cause the same thing.
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:14.360]  And I believe that's why
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:16.360]  the FDA recalled that product.
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:20.360]  Now, that's a great point.
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:22.360]  We've had scientists not to worry about that years ago.
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:24.360]  Yeah, they've talked a lot
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:26.360]  about antibody dependent enhancement
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:28.360]  from the vaccines, but I haven't
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:30.360]  heard anybody mention it
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:32.360]  from the monoclonal antibodies,
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:34.360]  but I have a paper here from Nature
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:36.360]  Microbiology
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:38.360]  Antibody dependent enhancement
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:40.360]  and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:42.360]  and therapies.
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:44.360]  Well, one of the therapies they mentioned in there
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:46.360]  is the monoclonal antibodies.
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:48.360]  And
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:50.360]  there's a little bit of an ambiguity
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:52.360]  in the title, I mean in the name
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:54.360]  antibody dependent enhancement that I'd like to clear up.
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:56.360]  It's not
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:55:58.360]  that the body becomes dependent
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:00.360]  on the antibodies.
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:02.360]  What's dependent on antibodies is the enhancement
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:04.360]  of the disease.
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:06.360]  So, not to give you a hard time,
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:08.360]  but sometimes I hear you say
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:10.360]  antibody dependency enhancement
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:12.360]  and what that kind of
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:14.360]  I butcher stuff all the time, brother.
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:16.360]  I'm not reading up a teleprompter.
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:18.360]  I make lots of mistakes. None of them are on purpose, but you're damn
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.360]  I listen to the show we broadcast sometimes.
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:22.360]  I'm like, you just said it's 2022.
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:24.360]  It's 2023.
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:26.360]  Yeah, I mean, like I said, not to give you a hard time.
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:28.360]  No, give me a hard time.
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.360]  Let me tell you, I'm not lying on purpose.
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:32.360]  I'm getting stuff wrong sometimes.
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:34.360]  Well, the only reason I mentioned it is because
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:36.360]  the thing dependency
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:38.360]  makes it sound like the person is dependent
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:40.360]  on the antibodies,
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:42.360]  but what it is that
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:44.360]  the enhancement of disease happens
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:46.360]  dependent on the presence of antibodies.
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:48.360]  So, when these antibodies are present,
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:50.360]  that allows
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:52.360]  the virus into your
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:54.360]  macrophages.
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:56.360]  Absolutely. What we know is these shots are really hurting people.
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:58.360]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:00.360]  And
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:02.360]  so, well,
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:04.360]  with the new variants coming around,
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:06.360]  what's significant about this is that...
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:08.360]  Even mainstream media admits the vaccines cause the new variants.
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:10.360]  Right.
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:12.360]  Yeah, and so, you know,
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:14.360]  they're talking about this new XBB 0.1
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:16.360]  0.5 that,
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:18.360]  you know, there's going to be other ones as well.
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:20.360]  There's no...
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:22.360]  The danger is that there's no telling what
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:24.360]  what variant you may be
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.360]  sickened with.
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:28.360]  And the FDA says in this press release
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:30.360]  that there are currently no testing technologies
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:32.360]  available.
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:34.360]  Last night, Gage said two years ago,
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:36.360]  terrorists will release the new mega virus.
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:38.360]  Well, we're the terrorists to him.
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:40.360]  We're going to release the new virus that kills us.
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:42.360]  Thanks for the call. All right.
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:44.360]  Hour number four, more calls and a special guest.
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:46.360]  Straight ahead, stay with us.
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:48.360]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:50.360]  a very exciting development
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:52.360]  that's just taken place.
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:54.360]  I want to encourage you all to go to

[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:08.360]  It's got a very good dose
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:10.360]  of melatonin,
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:12.360]  passionflower, valerian root extract,
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:14.360]  lemon balm, and German chamomile.
[02:58:14.360 --> 02:58:16.360]  All of these compounds are documented

[02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:20.360]  cleaner, healthier

[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:24.360]  game changers out there with all the stress
[02:58:24.360 --> 02:58:26.360]  we have in this world.

[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:30.360]  and they're excellent. They're all different formulas.
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:32.360]  But this one is particularly the strongest
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:34.360]  one we have.
[02:58:34.360 --> 02:58:36.360]  So, Gallon out, sold out for more than
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:38.360]  five months. It's now back available

[02:58:48.360 --> 02:58:50.360]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[02:58:50.360 --> 02:58:52.360]  There's a war
[02:58:52.360 --> 02:58:54.360]  in the environment, the food, the water, the air,
[02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:56.360]  the electromagnetics,
[02:58:56.360 --> 02:58:58.360]  the injections,
[02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:00.360]  to really cut us off from what God designed us
[02:59:00.360 --> 02:59:02.360]  to be.
[02:59:02.360 --> 02:59:04.360]  But through Mother Nature,
[02:59:04.360 --> 02:59:06.360]  the creator gave us compounds
[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:08.360]  that can counteract what the globalists have done.
[02:59:08.360 --> 02:59:10.360]  And I got to tell you,
[02:59:10.360 --> 02:59:12.360]  all our supplements are great, but we've got a real
[02:59:12.360 --> 02:59:14.360]  game changer now.
[02:59:14.360 --> 02:59:16.360]  We've never put anything out this powerful.
[02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:18.360]  It's InfoWars Platinum
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:20.360]  now exclusively available at 40%

[02:59:26.360 --> 02:59:28.360]  But it's exclusively available

[02:59:36.360 --> 02:59:38.360]  It's Pain MD.
[02:59:38.360 --> 02:59:40.360]  And it's 1776
[02:59:40.360 --> 02:59:42.360]  testosterone boost.
[02:59:42.360 --> 02:59:44.360]  You owe it to yourself and your way of life

[02:59:46.360 --> 03:00:09.360]  in the future.
[03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:11.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here in Canada
[03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:13.360]  today to stand up against the build of our crew.
[03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:15.360]  This is tending to get rid of the sovereignty
[03:00:15.360 --> 03:00:17.360]  of the United States.
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:19.360]  The truth of your world
[03:00:19.360 --> 03:00:21.360]  government has now been exposed.
[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:23.360]  We know you are ruthless.
[03:00:23.360 --> 03:00:25.360]  We know you are evil.
[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:27.360]  Today, the Rockefeller
[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:29.360]  and the Rothschild representatives here
[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:31.360]  to the Queen of the Netherlands
[03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:33.360]  to all of you, we tell you
[03:00:33.360 --> 03:00:35.360]  you are not our queens. You are not our kings.
[03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:37.360]  You are not our gods.
[03:00:37.360 --> 03:00:39.360]  We do not belong to you.
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:41.360]  We are not your slaves. We stand
[03:00:41.360 --> 03:00:43.360]  as free humans have stood since
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:45.360]  the beginning of time against the strong
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:47.360]  men, against the thugs,
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:49.360]  against the bullies.
[03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:51.360]  We will defeat your world government.
[03:00:51.360 --> 03:00:53.360]  We will defeat world taxation.
[03:00:53.360 --> 03:00:55.360]  We will defeat your control grid.
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:57.360]  God is on our side.
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:00:59.360]  I stand before
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:01.360]  the creator of the universe
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:03.360]  and I ask the creator of the universe
[03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:05.360]  as our founding fathers did in 1776
[03:01:05.360 --> 03:01:07.360]  to leave God
[03:01:07.360 --> 03:01:09.360]  and direct us and to give us
[03:01:09.360 --> 03:01:11.360]  the power and the foresight
[03:01:11.360 --> 03:01:13.360]  and the understanding and the will
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:15.360]  to stand against your entire agenda
[03:01:15.360 --> 03:01:17.360]  including your final plan
[03:01:17.360 --> 03:01:19.360]  of world population reduction
[03:01:19.360 --> 03:01:21.360]  of 80% that Henry Kissinger
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:23.360]  penned in 1973.
[03:01:23.360 --> 03:01:25.360]  Why do you put
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:27.360]  mercury in the vaccines?
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:29.360]  Stannisodium fluoride in the water.
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:31.360]  Why? Why do you put
[03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.360]  cancer viruses in the vaccines?
[03:01:33.360 --> 03:01:35.360]  Why have you used the British
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:37.360]  uranium now in four separate nations?
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:39.360]  You're arrogant. You have the sickness
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:41.360]  that elites have had throughout history
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:43.360]  in their literal and in some cases
[03:01:43.360 --> 03:01:45.360]  figurative ivory towers.
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:47.360]  You believe that you're invincible.
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:49.360]  You will and you are
[03:01:49.360 --> 03:01:51.360]  failing now.
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:53.360]  Your new world order will fall.
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:55.360]  Humanity will
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:57.360]  defeat you. The answer
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:01:59.360]  to 1984 is
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:01.360]  1776.
[03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:03.360]  Yes!
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:07.360]  Yes!
[03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:09.360]  Billerberg is an elite organization
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:11.360]  and the way it works, the protocol
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:13.360]  of the meetings is the staff
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:15.360]  after they're vetted out, they're told
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.360]  exactly how they're supposed to behave themselves
[03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:19.360]  meaning that they can never address
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:21.360]  the attendees, they can never speak to them
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:23.360]  unless they're spoken to first, they can never look them in the eye.
[03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:25.360]  They have to approach them from the right side
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:27.360]  the people who are right-handed
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:29.360]  and from the left side the people who are left-handed
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:31.360]  they can never look them straight on
[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:33.360]  and needless to say
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:35.360]  all the information that is being spoken
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:37.360]  at during the conferences is under no
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:39.360]  circumstances allowed to come out, that's what they're told
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:41.360]  that threatened with not being
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:43.360]  able to find another job anywhere in the sector
[03:02:43.360 --> 03:02:45.360]  if they reveal any information
[03:02:45.360 --> 03:02:47.360]  to the press.
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:53.360]  Richard Holbrook?
[03:02:53.360 --> 03:02:55.360]  Ambassador Richard Holbrook
[03:02:55.360 --> 03:02:57.360]  thought the peasantry wouldn't recognize him
[03:02:57.360 --> 03:02:59.360]  if he took a stroll
[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:01.360]  off the grounds of Brook Street.
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:09.360]  Holbrook cackled when I told him
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:11.360]  that we were not his slaves.
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:16.360]  Holbrook, we're not your slaves, Holbrook!
[03:03:20.360 --> 03:03:22.360]  We're not your slaves!
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:25.360]  Holbrook, we don't belong to you!
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:31.360]  We're not your property!
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:35.360]  Get back on the sidewalk!
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:38.360]  We're free humanity!
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:42.360]  Yeah, there he goes.
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:47.360]  Power. They love it.
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:01.360]  Okay, we're going to be going around the back here, guys.
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:10.360]  Hey, guys, how you doing?
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:16.360]  There are several rings of security service.
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:18.360]  The American delegation at every
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:20.360]  Billenberg meeting is usually protected by the CIA
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:22.360]  and the Special Division of the US Army.
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:25.360]  The British delegation is protected by the MI-6.
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:28.360]  Israelis usually are protected by the Mossad.
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:31.360]  The Ottawa police, in this case, working for the security,
[03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:33.360]  they have very little...
[03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:35.360]  Actually, they don't have any information at all
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:37.360]  about what the meeting is about.
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:39.360]  They didn't know who the Billenbergs are.
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:42.360]  Then there's an elite private firm
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:45.360]  protecting the perimeter doing all the dirty work,
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:47.360]  such as shooting out the photographers
[03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:49.360]  and bothering the protesters.
[03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:51.360]  This is all from the film end game, free online.
[03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:58.360]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[03:05:21.360 --> 03:05:26.360]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:54.360]  The price way, way lower than the same product on store shelves
[03:05:54.360 --> 03:05:56.360]  for up to twice the cost.
[03:05:56.360 --> 03:06:22.360]  Here are your calls.
[03:06:22.360 --> 03:06:26.360]  Constantly brag that the mega cities of the future,
[03:06:26.360 --> 03:06:28.360]  Austin being one of them,
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:30.360]  will be the control grids that take over
[03:06:30.360 --> 03:06:32.360]  all the countryside and rural areas
[03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:34.360]  and will be used to train people
[03:06:34.360 --> 03:06:36.360]  to live in a high-tech technocracy
[03:06:36.360 --> 03:06:38.360]  that makes the current communist Chinese
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:41.360]  social credit score look tame in comparison.
[03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:43.360]  That's why in this revolution,
[03:06:43.360 --> 03:06:45.360]  we've got to not just have the information,
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:47.360]  we've not just got to keep our immune systems up,
[03:06:47.360 --> 03:06:50.360]  we've got to warn others about the New World Order,
[03:06:50.360 --> 03:06:53.360]  and all of us need to work with friends and family
[03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:55.360]  to get pieces of rural property
[03:06:55.360 --> 03:06:57.360]  and get back to the land,
[03:06:57.360 --> 03:06:59.360]  even if it's only part-time,
[03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:01.360]  to learn how to become self-sufficient.
[03:07:01.360 --> 03:07:03.360]  Because in the future, you're going to watch those
[03:07:03.360 --> 03:07:05.360]  under the control of the globalist
[03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:07.360]  and the social credit score.
[03:07:07.360 --> 03:07:10.360]  You're going to watch those who are hot in the trap
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:12.360]  of the universal basic income,
[03:07:12.360 --> 03:07:14.360]  being forced to take injections,
[03:07:14.360 --> 03:07:16.360]  being forced to be sterilized,
[03:07:16.360 --> 03:07:18.360]  being forced to many cases,
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:20.360]  being forced to start euthanasia.
[03:07:20.360 --> 03:07:22.360]  Canada is the model.
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:24.360]  This is a control grid.
[03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:26.360]  This is a vice they're putting us in.
[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:28.360]  Everybody should go online and find my film.
[03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:30.360]  It's free.
[03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:32.360]  In-game, Blueprint for Global Enslavement made in 2007
[03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:34.360]  with all their documents,
[03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:37.360]  predicting what would be here by the year 2023.
[03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:39.360]  And it's already here
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:41.360]  because it's their battle plan.
[03:07:41.360 --> 03:07:43.360]  It's their program.
[03:07:43.360 --> 03:07:45.360]  In the near future,
[03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:48.360]  it will be done by a powerful world government.
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:52.360]  Once free nations are slaves to the will of a tiny elite,
[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:56.360]  the dawn of a new dark age is upon mankind.
[03:07:56.360 --> 03:07:59.360]  Countries are a thing of the past.
[03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:03.360]  Every form of independence is under attack,
[03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:06.360]  with the family and even the individual itself
[03:08:06.360 --> 03:08:08.360]  nearing extinction.
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:11.360]  Close to 80% of the Earth's population
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:13.360]  has been eliminated.
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:16.360]  The remnants of a once free humanity
[03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:18.360]  are forced to live within highly controlled,
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:21.360]  compact, prison-like cities.
[03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:24.360]  Travel is highly restricted.
[03:08:24.360 --> 03:08:27.360]  Super highways connect the mega cities
[03:08:27.360 --> 03:08:31.360]  and keep the population from entering into unauthorized zones.
[03:08:31.360 --> 03:08:34.360]  No human activity is private.
[03:08:34.360 --> 03:08:39.360]  AI supercomputers chronicle and categorize every action.
[03:08:39.360 --> 03:08:44.360]  A prison planet dominated by a ruthless gang of control freaks
[03:08:44.360 --> 03:08:47.360]  whose power can never be challenged.
[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:51.360]  This is the vision of the global elite, their goal.
[03:08:51.360 --> 03:08:53.360]  The bad news is these people mean business
[03:08:53.360 --> 03:08:55.360]  and are mass-murdering mad scientists.
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:08:57.360]  The good news is we have their blueprint,
[03:08:57.360 --> 03:08:59.360]  we have the Death Star plans,
[03:08:59.360 --> 03:09:01.360]  and we know how to bring them down.
[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:04.360]  That city is a UN controlled stronghold.
[03:09:04.360 --> 03:09:07.360]  That is a test grid for the systems they're putting in,
[03:09:07.360 --> 03:09:09.360]  not just the 5G, but the surveillance,
[03:09:09.360 --> 03:09:11.360]  the trapper chips and all the cars,
[03:09:11.360 --> 03:09:13.360]  the kill switches, the robots, the drones,
[03:09:13.360 --> 03:09:15.360]  all of it is being admitted.
[03:09:15.360 --> 03:09:17.360]  The globalists are taking control
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:19.360]  of the evolutionary process of humanity.
[03:09:19.360 --> 03:09:21.360]  They're playing God at treating us
[03:09:21.360 --> 03:09:24.360]  like Benjamin Netanyahu said a month ago
[03:09:24.360 --> 03:09:27.360]  on Jordan Peterson's show as lab rats.
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:30.360]  He said the entire Israeli population are lab rats,
[03:09:30.360 --> 03:09:32.360]  not just for their COVID injections,
[03:09:32.360 --> 03:09:35.360]  but for future tests of mRNA.
[03:09:35.360 --> 03:09:37.360]  So Israel became, if you will,
[03:09:37.360 --> 03:09:40.360]  the lab for Pfizer,
[03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:42.360]  and that's how we did it.
[03:09:42.360 --> 03:09:44.360]  We gave the information to the world,
[03:09:44.360 --> 03:09:46.360]  not only in publishing medical magazines and so on.
[03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:49.360]  I intend to bring on that base,
[03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:52.360]  database of personal medical records
[03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:54.360]  for our entire population,
[03:09:54.360 --> 03:09:56.360]  a genetic database, genomes, okay?
[03:09:56.360 --> 03:09:59.360]  Now let pharma companies,
[03:09:59.360 --> 03:10:01.360]  let medical companies,
[03:10:01.360 --> 03:10:05.360]  let them run algorithms on this database, okay?
[03:10:05.360 --> 03:10:08.360]  But you can create, you know,
[03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:11.360]  a biotechnological industry
[03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:13.360]  that is unheard of right now.
[03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:15.360]  Unheard of, unimagined even.
[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:16.360]  Think about that.
[03:10:16.360 --> 03:10:17.360]  That's what Israel's become.
[03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:19.360]  That's what Singapore's become.
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:20.360]  That's what the UK's become.
[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:21.360]  That's what Germany's become.
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:24.360]  That's what China is the model of, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:27.360]  And we have to come together and realize this
[03:10:27.360 --> 03:10:29.360]  and not let them continue to push
[03:10:29.360 --> 03:10:31.360]  humanity over the edge of the cliff.
[03:10:31.360 --> 03:10:33.360]  Info Wars is the very front line of this fight,
[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:35.360]  the very tip of the spear.
[03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:36.360]  And I salute the thinking of your past support.
[03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:38.360]  But now more than ever realize,
[03:10:38.360 --> 03:10:40.360]  we need your support and your word of mouth.
[03:10:40.360 --> 03:10:42.360]  The public is ready to hear the truth.
[03:10:42.360 --> 03:10:43.360]  We've won major battles,
[03:10:43.360 --> 03:10:45.360]  but the war has not been won yet.
[03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:46.360]  Please spread the word about the broadcast
[03:10:46.360 --> 03:10:48.360]  and go to infowarstore.com
[03:10:48.360 --> 03:10:49.360]  and buy great products today
[03:10:49.360 --> 03:10:50.360]  that boost your immune system
[03:10:50.360 --> 03:10:51.360]  and empower your life,
[03:10:51.360 --> 03:10:53.360]  while also keeping Info Wars on the air
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:55.360]  a true 360 win.
[03:10:55.360 --> 03:10:57.360]  Like a rock thrown into a pond,
[03:10:57.360 --> 03:10:59.360]  your actions, even though they may seem little,
[03:10:59.360 --> 03:11:01.360]  have a massive ripple effect
[03:11:01.360 --> 03:11:03.360]  throughout time and space.
[03:11:03.360 --> 03:11:05.360]  We're actually winning the Info War.
[03:11:05.360 --> 03:11:07.360]  And when you realize that Bandai Video
[03:11:07.360 --> 03:11:11.360]  has hundreds and hundreds of censored directors
[03:11:11.360 --> 03:11:13.360]  and investigative journalists to talk to most,
[03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:16.360]  whose information is beyond incredible.
[03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:18.360]  Hundreds of medical doctors and scientists,
[03:11:18.360 --> 03:11:20.360]  all of them right now telling the truth
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:22.360]  at Bandai Video.
[03:11:22.360 --> 03:11:24.360]  Millions of people today visiting Bandai Video,
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:26.360]  but you can take that information
[03:11:26.360 --> 03:11:28.360]  and cause a bigger ripple effect,
[03:11:28.360 --> 03:11:29.360]  an amplifying effect,
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:31.360]  and make sure it gets out to your friends,
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:34.360]  your family, your neighbors, and perfect strangers.
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:36.360]  You are the modern Paul Revere's.
[03:11:36.360 --> 03:11:38.360]  You are what takes our information
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:40.360]  and amplifies it.
[03:11:40.360 --> 03:11:41.360]  When you decide to take action,
[03:11:41.360 --> 03:11:45.360]  we as a species and as a race are invincible.
[03:11:45.360 --> 03:11:47.360]  So I thank you all for your past action
[03:11:47.360 --> 03:11:50.360]  and I challenge you to redouble your efforts now
[03:11:50.360 --> 03:11:53.360]  because humanity and the children are counting on you.
[03:11:53.360 --> 03:11:56.360]  All right, let's jam in some calls
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:58.360]  here before the guest host takes over.
[03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:00.360]  Bart in Texas and then Bart in Georgia.
[03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:02.360]  Bart, welcome, go ahead.
[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:04.360]  Hey, Alex, you're doing great work.
[03:12:04.360 --> 03:12:05.360]  I do appreciate it.
[03:12:05.360 --> 03:12:06.360]  Thank you.
[03:12:06.360 --> 03:12:09.360]  So in that, you've all heard a clip.
[03:12:13.360 --> 03:12:15.360]  And there's two things in particular he said
[03:12:15.360 --> 03:12:18.360]  that I really never hear too often.
[03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:20.360]  Number one, he said the metaverse,
[03:12:20.360 --> 03:12:23.360]  in the metaverse, the biology is different,
[03:12:23.360 --> 03:12:27.360]  but we all know there's no organic biology in the metaverse.
[03:12:27.360 --> 03:12:30.360]  I mean, you can call it digital biology,
[03:12:30.360 --> 03:12:32.360]  but it's not biology.
[03:12:32.360 --> 03:12:33.360]  It's a lie.
[03:12:33.360 --> 03:12:34.360]  It's a lie, it's a joke.
[03:12:34.360 --> 03:12:36.360]  Anybody that's not listening carefully
[03:12:36.360 --> 03:12:38.360]  is just going to get in a trance.
[03:12:38.360 --> 03:12:43.360]  And number two, they may be able to download our memories
[03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:44.360]  given technology now.
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:46.360]  They may be able to download our memories
[03:12:46.360 --> 03:12:48.360]  into the metaverse,
[03:12:48.360 --> 03:12:51.360]  but they're not going to be able to get my consciousness there.
[03:12:51.360 --> 03:12:55.360]  Nobody ever talks about the fact that it's going to be impossible
[03:12:55.360 --> 03:13:00.360]  to transfer life or consciousness into the metaverse,
[03:13:00.360 --> 03:13:04.360]  and you're an idiot if you think that you can live there.
[03:13:04.360 --> 03:13:07.360]  Wow, continue.
[03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:08.360]  That's pretty much it.
[03:13:08.360 --> 03:13:10.360]  Those are the two points I wanted to hit.
[03:13:10.360 --> 03:13:12.360]  It's just, you just listen to him carefully.
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:13.360]  He knows it's a fraud.
[03:13:13.360 --> 03:13:15.360]  He wants you to give his will over to him.
[03:13:15.360 --> 03:13:20.360]  Well, but you've got to listen super carefully to parse it
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:24.360]  and realize that if you look closely,
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:25.360]  it doesn't make sense.
[03:13:25.360 --> 03:13:27.360]  It's just crap or lies as you call it.
[03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:28.360]  Well, he wants to give you,
[03:13:28.360 --> 03:13:30.360]  he wants you to give your biology over to them
[03:13:30.360 --> 03:13:32.360]  and forget you have it while they're controlling it.
[03:13:32.360 --> 03:13:33.360]  Great points.
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:34.360]  Thank you so much, sir.
[03:13:34.360 --> 03:13:35.360]  Amazing.
[03:13:35.360 --> 03:13:36.360]  Bart in Georgia, you're on the air.
[03:13:36.360 --> 03:13:37.360]  Go ahead.
[03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:40.360]  Yes, gentlemen, take out your earphones.
[03:13:40.360 --> 03:13:43.360]  I'm going to do the Alex Jones battle scream.
[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:49.360]  All right.
[03:13:49.360 --> 03:13:52.360]  Now, Alex, I want to talk about how my new Corvette
[03:13:52.360 --> 03:13:54.360]  started up by itself this morning.
[03:13:54.360 --> 03:13:56.360]  I went in the garage and started talking to me.
[03:13:56.360 --> 03:13:59.360]  I said, come on, Bart, let's go get laid and get drunk.
[03:13:59.360 --> 03:14:00.360]  I said, no, sir.
[03:14:00.360 --> 03:14:01.360]  It's nine o'clock in the morning.
[03:14:01.360 --> 03:14:03.360]  There's people and there's children on the school
[03:14:03.360 --> 03:14:08.360]  and the car took off and without me, Robert Barnes, help.
[03:14:08.360 --> 03:14:10.360]  You're funny.
[03:14:10.360 --> 03:14:12.360]  What else on your mind, Bart?
[03:14:12.360 --> 03:14:15.360]  I want Bill Gates arrested right now.
[03:14:15.360 --> 03:14:16.360]  That's all I have to say.
[03:14:16.360 --> 03:14:20.360]  And I just spent the last hour in the convenience store
[03:14:20.360 --> 03:14:23.360]  hollering at some guy that doesn't speak English.
[03:14:23.360 --> 03:14:25.360]  Mar-Bord Rose.
[03:14:25.360 --> 03:14:27.360]  Mar-Bord Rose.
[03:14:27.360 --> 03:14:28.360]  Over.
[03:14:28.360 --> 03:14:29.360]  God bless you, brother.
[03:14:29.360 --> 03:14:30.360]  All right.
[03:14:30.360 --> 03:14:31.360]  I'm sorry to Carlos.
[03:14:31.360 --> 03:14:33.360]  I'm sorry to Nancy and I'm sorry to Steve.
[03:14:33.360 --> 03:14:35.360]  I'm going to take a lot of calls tomorrow.
[03:14:35.360 --> 03:14:37.360]  So if you give us your name and number, we will call you.
[03:14:37.360 --> 03:14:40.360]  Don't forget, John, just to take the calls.
[03:14:40.360 --> 03:14:43.360]  I will take up two hours of calls tomorrow,
[03:14:43.360 --> 03:14:45.360]  but I need you to give me your number.
[03:14:45.360 --> 03:14:46.360]  I'll call you back.
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:47.360]  So I apologize to that.
[03:14:47.360 --> 03:14:53.360]  Our special guest host from Australia is about to take over.
[03:14:53.360 --> 03:14:57.360]  You can check out her website at zmedia.com.
[03:14:57.360 --> 03:15:03.360]  That's three Z's, three E's, Z-E-E-E, Z-E-E-E, media.com.
[03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:05.360]  Maria Z is about to take over.
[03:15:05.360 --> 03:15:09.360]  Then in about 45 minutes, Owen,
[03:15:09.360 --> 03:15:13.360]  the cut destroyer, shroyer, will take over with the war room.
[03:15:13.360 --> 03:15:16.360]  A lot of big guests this week.
[03:15:16.360 --> 03:15:18.360]  A lot of huge news coming up.
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:20.360]  A lot of big developments.
[03:15:20.360 --> 03:15:22.360]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:22.360 --> 03:15:23.360]  Tomorrow's news today.
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:24.360]  I'm very, very blessed to be here.
[03:15:24.360 --> 03:15:25.360]  Very thankful to the crew.
[03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:28.360]  Very thankful for all of you and what you've done to keep us on air.
[03:15:28.360 --> 03:15:30.360]  And this is an adventure.
[03:15:30.360 --> 03:15:32.360]  This is an incredible time to be alive,
[03:15:32.360 --> 03:15:34.360]  and I love you all so much.
[03:15:34.360 --> 03:15:36.360]  And yes, I want to take calls.
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:39.360]  So, we've already done this some, but more and more,
[03:15:39.360 --> 03:15:41.360]  I'm going to do special shows at night and weekends.
[03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:43.360]  They're like three hours commercial free.
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:44.360]  Just taking your calls.
[03:15:44.360 --> 03:15:45.360]  Your calls are the best.
[03:15:45.360 --> 03:15:47.360]  So love and appreciate you all.
[03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:50.360]  All right, our special guest host takes over on the other side.
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:51.360]  Infowars.com.
[03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:53.360]  Do not share that link.
[03:15:58.360 --> 03:16:03.360]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the Globals.
[03:16:03.360 --> 03:16:07.360]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[03:16:07.360 --> 03:16:10.360]  not just in America, but in the world.
[03:16:10.360 --> 03:16:13.360]  We are engaging the Globals at point-blank range
[03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:15.360]  in the information war.
[03:16:15.360 --> 03:16:17.360]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[03:16:17.360 --> 03:16:20.360]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers
[03:16:20.360 --> 03:16:24.360]  who support them for the real reason you've had the success.
[03:16:24.360 --> 03:16:26.360]  We're having now the greatest victories
[03:16:26.360 --> 03:16:29.360]  in the fight against the new war you've ever had.
[03:16:29.360 --> 03:16:33.360]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:36.360]  And that's why today it's more important than ever
[03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:38.360]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[03:16:38.360 --> 03:16:41.360]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[03:16:41.360 --> 03:16:42.360]  and to intensify them.
[03:16:42.360 --> 03:16:44.360]  God bless you all.
[03:16:44.360 --> 03:16:45.360]  I salute you.
[03:16:45.360 --> 03:16:46.360]  I thank you.
[03:16:46.360 --> 03:16:49.360]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[03:16:49.360 --> 03:16:52.360]  because we are over the target and history is happening.
[03:16:52.360 --> 03:16:53.360]  The fight is my fight.
[03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:54.360]  It's your fight.
[03:16:54.360 --> 03:16:55.360]  It's our fight.
[03:16:55.360 --> 03:16:56.360]  God bless you all.
[03:16:56.360 --> 03:16:58.360]  There is a war on for your mind.
[03:16:58.360 --> 03:17:00.360]  Your mind is a battlefield.
[03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:02.360]  This is an information war.
[03:17:02.360 --> 03:17:07.360]  Info wars popularized those terms more than two decades ago.
[03:17:07.360 --> 03:17:10.360]  And today, whether it's Donald Trump or Governor DeSantis
[03:17:10.360 --> 03:17:14.360]  or Dr. Robert Malone, they're all using the terms
[03:17:14.360 --> 03:17:16.360]  that info wars has popularized
[03:17:16.360 --> 03:17:18.360]  because we understand the enemy's operations
[03:17:18.360 --> 03:17:20.360]  and we know how to beat them.
[03:17:20.360 --> 03:17:22.360]  But we can't do it without funding.
[03:17:22.360 --> 03:17:24.360]  And we make it easy to fund with great products
[03:17:24.360 --> 03:17:26.360]  and power you and your immune system
[03:17:26.360 --> 03:17:27.360]  and your family as well.

[03:17:32.360 --> 03:17:34.360]  But I'm asking you to take action.
[03:17:34.360 --> 03:17:35.360]  We're non-violent.
[03:17:35.360 --> 03:17:38.360]  But every time you donate money, every time you buy products,
[03:17:38.360 --> 03:17:39.360]  every time you keep us on air,
[03:17:39.360 --> 03:17:41.360]  you are literally non-violently politically
[03:17:41.360 --> 03:17:43.360]  punching the new world order in the nose,
[03:17:43.360 --> 03:17:46.360]  punching their lies in the nose.
[03:17:46.360 --> 03:17:48.360]  We are going to defeat the new world order.
[03:17:48.360 --> 03:17:49.360]  We're going over the top.
[03:17:49.360 --> 03:17:50.360]  Right now is the critical juncture.
[03:17:50.360 --> 03:17:52.360]  So please go to infowarstore.com
[03:17:52.360 --> 03:17:54.360]  and donate now.

[03:19:28.360 --> 03:19:30.360]  while getting great products at the same time
[03:19:30.360 --> 03:19:32.360]  that will empower you and your family.

[03:19:41.360 --> 03:19:43.360]  not part of it going towards product cost.
[03:19:43.360 --> 03:19:45.360]  But I thank you all for your support.

[03:19:51.360 --> 03:19:58.360]  Our guests are counting on you, not taking action.
[03:19:58.360 --> 03:20:03.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:03.360 --> 03:20:12.360]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:12.360 --> 03:20:14.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:14.360 --> 03:20:18.360]  I'm your guest host, Maria Zee from Zmedia.com.
[03:20:18.360 --> 03:20:22.360]  It's an honor to be here with you all today,
[03:20:22.360 --> 03:20:26.360]  guest hosting, coming to you live from the testing ground
[03:20:26.360 --> 03:20:28.360]  of the New World Order in Australia.
[03:20:28.360 --> 03:20:31.360]  That's right, we were subjected to pregnant women
[03:20:31.360 --> 03:20:35.360]  being pushed to the ground, old ladies harassed,
[03:20:35.360 --> 03:20:38.360]  pensioners recently being arrested and accused
[03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:42.360]  of stalking the governor for peacefully protesting.
[03:20:42.360 --> 03:20:44.360]  The tyranny continues,
[03:20:44.360 --> 03:20:48.360]  the governor for peacefully protesting, the tyranny continues
[03:20:48.360 --> 03:20:50.360]  in the country of Australia.
[03:20:50.360 --> 03:20:53.360]  I'm going to bring a special guest on today,
[03:20:53.360 --> 03:20:55.360]  James Rogarski, who's following the developments
[03:20:55.360 --> 03:20:58.360]  on the WHO's international health regulations amendments.
[03:20:58.360 --> 03:21:00.360]  You need to know this information
[03:21:00.360 --> 03:21:03.360]  because they're meeting in secret this week as we speak
[03:21:03.360 --> 03:21:05.360]  and not many people know about it.
[03:21:05.360 --> 03:21:08.360]  But we really are, James is on the screen right now.
[03:21:08.360 --> 03:21:10.360]  James, welcome.
[03:21:10.360 --> 03:21:12.360]  Thank you, Maria.
[03:21:12.360 --> 03:21:15.360]  It's a pleasure to be here and we've obviously got breaking news.
[03:21:15.360 --> 03:21:17.360]  We do have breaking news.
[03:21:17.360 --> 03:21:19.360]  Before we get started, I just want to say,
[03:21:19.360 --> 03:21:21.360]  we really are in the eye of the storm.
[03:21:21.360 --> 03:21:26.360]  We are literally in the globalist waiting room unwillingly,
[03:21:26.360 --> 03:21:30.360]  knowing that when the doctor calls us into that treatment room
[03:21:30.360 --> 03:21:32.360]  that we don't want to be in,
[03:21:32.360 --> 03:21:35.360]  it spells forced injections and reeducation.
[03:21:35.360 --> 03:21:36.360]  This is where we are.
[03:21:36.360 --> 03:21:39.360]  The mechanisms of conditioning us towards this
[03:21:39.360 --> 03:21:40.360]  are already in place.
[03:21:40.360 --> 03:21:42.360]  They did this with the force shots
[03:21:42.360 --> 03:21:44.360]  by way of taking your livelihood,
[03:21:44.360 --> 03:21:46.360]  even custody of your kids,
[03:21:46.360 --> 03:21:49.360]  which did happen to some parents around the world.
[03:21:49.360 --> 03:21:52.360]  Lockdowns and psychological torment via the media.
[03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:54.360]  But what they're putting in place was the...
[03:21:54.360 --> 03:21:56.360]  This was the beta test.
[03:21:56.360 --> 03:22:00.360]  What they're putting in place is more than just a psychological war.
[03:22:00.360 --> 03:22:04.360]  We've entered into the phase of medical martial law
[03:22:04.360 --> 03:22:06.360]  and that is not an overstatement.
[03:22:06.360 --> 03:22:09.360]  It already began with COVID and what is coming is much, much worse.
[03:22:09.360 --> 03:22:12.360]  I've spoken about this topic like I'm beating a dead horse,
[03:22:12.360 --> 03:22:14.360]  but I really believe it's the most important news
[03:22:14.360 --> 03:22:15.360]  in the world right now.
[03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:17.360]  James is going to break it with me right now.
[03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:20.360]  No one has their finger on the pulse like him
[03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:22.360]  on the subject of the WHO.
[03:22:22.360 --> 03:22:27.360]  So James, again, thank you so much for being here with us today.
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:29.360]  Long story short,
[03:22:29.360 --> 03:22:33.360]  the International Health Regulations Review Committee,
[03:22:33.360 --> 03:22:36.360]  which only answers to Tedros Cabracius,
[03:22:36.360 --> 03:22:38.360]  the Director General of the WHO,
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:40.360]  is meeting all this week,
[03:22:40.360 --> 03:22:44.360]  and their goal is to take a 46-page document,
[03:22:44.360 --> 03:22:48.360]  the current rough draft of proposed amendments
[03:22:48.360 --> 03:22:51.360]  to the International Health Regulations.
[03:22:51.360 --> 03:22:53.360]  They're polishing up the document.
[03:22:53.360 --> 03:22:56.360]  I would argue, and I think people in the future looking back
[03:22:56.360 --> 03:22:58.360]  will be able to see,
[03:22:58.360 --> 03:23:02.360]  that this is actually a founding, enacting document
[03:23:02.360 --> 03:23:05.360]  of the New World Order of the One World Government.
[03:23:05.360 --> 03:23:08.360]  There have been many proposals in the past,
[03:23:08.360 --> 03:23:10.360]  many plans in the past.
[03:23:10.360 --> 03:23:13.360]  This is when the rubber is hitting the road.
[03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:18.360]  They want to enact into legally binding international law
[03:23:18.360 --> 03:23:21.360]  amendments to existing regulations
[03:23:21.360 --> 03:23:25.360]  that give them powers that really should turn your stomach.
[03:23:25.360 --> 03:23:31.360]  They've got a self-imposed deadline of Sunday the 15th
[03:23:31.360 --> 03:23:34.360]  to hand these proposed amendments over
[03:23:34.360 --> 03:23:36.360]  to the WHO.
[03:23:36.360 --> 03:23:38.360]  The reason for that is,
[03:23:38.360 --> 03:23:40.360]  even though they don't listen to their own rules
[03:23:40.360 --> 03:23:42.360]  and they break them all the time,
[03:23:42.360 --> 03:23:45.360]  there is a rule in the International Health Regulations
[03:23:45.360 --> 03:23:49.360]  that any proposed amendments have to be submitted
[03:23:49.360 --> 03:23:51.360]  four months in advance
[03:23:51.360 --> 03:23:54.360]  of when they would have a chance to adopt these amendments,
[03:23:54.360 --> 03:23:58.360]  and that will be happening from May 21st to the 30th.
[03:23:58.360 --> 03:24:02.360]  That's when they have all 194 member nations come together
[03:24:02.360 --> 03:24:05.360]  at the World Health Assembly in Geneva.
[03:24:05.360 --> 03:24:10.360]  Now, the event that's going on this week is confidential.
[03:24:10.360 --> 03:24:13.360]  All of the hand-picked technocrats that are meeting
[03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:16.360]  are sworn to not talk about it.
[03:24:16.360 --> 03:24:20.360]  I've sent all of them emails and they don't reply.
[03:24:20.360 --> 03:24:25.360]  What they are crafting are 46 pages
[03:24:25.360 --> 03:24:28.360]  that have been submitted from 16 different countries,
[03:24:28.360 --> 03:24:30.360]  including the United States,
[03:24:30.360 --> 03:24:33.360]  not including Australia,
[03:24:33.360 --> 03:24:38.360]  and many of those nations submitted on behalf of groups of nations,
[03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:41.360]  like the Czech Republic submitted for the European Union,
[03:24:41.360 --> 03:24:43.360]  and so forth,
[03:24:43.360 --> 03:24:46.360]  and the soundbite.
[03:24:46.360 --> 03:24:49.360]  I've prepared both the soundbite for people
[03:24:49.360 --> 03:24:51.360]  who only want to get a snippet.
[03:24:51.360 --> 03:24:53.360]  I've got the top 10 reasons,
[03:24:53.360 --> 03:24:55.360]  and there's the top 100,
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:24:58.360]  but essentially the soundbite is one of the amendments
[03:24:58.360 --> 03:25:00.360]  that they would have,
[03:25:00.360 --> 03:25:03.360]  would wipe out, cross out, remove,
[03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:06.360]  respect for human dignity, human rights,
[03:25:06.360 --> 03:25:08.360]  and fundamental freedoms.
[03:25:08.360 --> 03:25:14.360]  And so that sets the tone for the 46 pages
[03:25:14.360 --> 03:25:19.360]  worth of just abominable things that they want to enact,
[03:25:19.360 --> 03:25:23.360]  and I really believe this can be seen as the founding document
[03:25:23.360 --> 03:25:27.360]  of what Alex has been talking about for decades.
[03:25:27.360 --> 03:25:29.360]  You're absolutely right, James.
[03:25:29.360 --> 03:25:31.360]  The team's just bringing up your sub-stack.
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:33.360]  The radio viewers can't see this,
[03:25:33.360 --> 03:25:37.360]  but I encourage everyone to go to JamesRugusky.substack.com
[03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:39.360]  and read through some of his articles.
[03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:42.360]  As I said, no one has their finger on the pulse
[03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:45.360]  as far as monitoring the WHO and these proposed amendments,
[03:25:45.360 --> 03:25:49.360]  like James, and so he's a very, very important guest today.
[03:25:49.360 --> 03:25:52.360]  James, I want to ask you the four months in advance.
[03:25:52.360 --> 03:25:55.360]  So we were told that they wanted to finalise
[03:25:55.360 --> 03:25:58.360]  the IHR amendments and sort of put them into place
[03:25:58.360 --> 03:26:01.360]  by May of 2024,
[03:26:01.360 --> 03:26:04.360]  but we had suspicions that come May 2023,
[03:26:04.360 --> 03:26:07.360]  they were going to go full force with this.
[03:26:07.360 --> 03:26:12.360]  Whispers of timelines of, you know, potential 5G attacks
[03:26:12.360 --> 03:26:16.360]  and things of this nature are coming through to my desk
[03:26:16.360 --> 03:26:18.360]  in the next five months.
[03:26:18.360 --> 03:26:20.360]  Do we think that they'll actually finalise
[03:26:20.360 --> 03:26:23.360]  the IHR amendments in May and rush this through
[03:26:23.360 --> 03:26:26.360]  rather than, you know, waiting until next year?
[03:26:28.360 --> 03:26:31.360]  They have been saying for more than a year now
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:35.360]  that their timeline is shooting for 2024,
[03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:37.360]  but they've obviously set the stage
[03:26:37.360 --> 03:26:39.360]  so that if they wanted to,
[03:26:39.360 --> 03:26:41.360]  they could ignore what they've said in the past
[03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:44.360]  and they could vote to adopt these.
[03:26:44.360 --> 03:26:47.360]  Now, the concern, and I want to nip in the but confusion
[03:26:47.360 --> 03:26:49.360]  that almost everybody has,
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:52.360]  we are not talking about the pandemic treaty.
[03:26:52.360 --> 03:26:55.360]  That is a completely separate thing.
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:57.360]  If you hear anybody use the word treaty,
[03:26:57.360 --> 03:27:00.360]  they're talking about something different.
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:03.360]  The setup with the international health regulations
[03:27:03.360 --> 03:27:05.360]  is much more concerning
[03:27:05.360 --> 03:27:09.360]  because it's an agreement that already exists.
[03:27:09.360 --> 03:27:12.360]  All of the nations on the planet have already
[03:27:12.360 --> 03:27:14.360]  adopted it and, you know,
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:17.360]  given their allegiance to it, if you will.
[03:27:17.360 --> 03:27:21.360]  And so if these amendments are adopted
[03:27:21.360 --> 03:27:25.360]  by a simple majority of the 194 nations,
[03:27:25.360 --> 03:27:27.360]  they become law.
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:30.360]  There will be no asking the Senate
[03:27:30.360 --> 03:27:32.360]  for their advice and consent
[03:27:32.360 --> 03:27:36.360]  and there is not even a presidential signature needed.
[03:27:36.360 --> 03:27:39.360]  That happened back in 2007
[03:27:39.360 --> 03:27:44.360]  and what was agreed to are if the amendments are passed,
[03:27:44.360 --> 03:27:46.360]  that's it, okay?
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:50.360]  And so whether they choose to do that in 2024
[03:27:50.360 --> 03:27:53.360]  or this year in 2023,
[03:27:53.360 --> 03:27:57.360]  our response needs to be no in either case.
[03:27:57.360 --> 03:28:00.360]  And what we need to do is start raising awareness now.
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:02.360]  Now, Marie, I have a little bit of a surprise for you.
[03:28:02.360 --> 03:28:04.360]  I did publish this morning
[03:28:04.360 --> 03:28:07.360]  an open letter to the United States Congress.
[03:28:07.360 --> 03:28:10.360]  It's the main article on my substack.
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:13.360]  Tomorrow, I'll be doing a very similar thing
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:15.360]  for the people of Australia.
[03:28:15.360 --> 03:28:18.360]  We need to do this for every nation on the planet.
[03:28:18.360 --> 03:28:21.360]  I've tried to make it very easy for people
[03:28:21.360 --> 03:28:24.360]  to understand what is going on
[03:28:24.360 --> 03:28:27.360]  and also to reach out and essentially tell
[03:28:27.360 --> 03:28:29.360]  their congresspeople or parliamentarians
[03:28:29.360 --> 03:28:31.360]  or whatever representatives they may have,
[03:28:31.360 --> 03:28:37.360]  you need to take a stand on what is your opinion
[03:28:37.360 --> 03:28:39.360]  about having a one-world government,
[03:28:39.360 --> 03:28:42.360]  handing over sovereignty, human rights,
[03:28:42.360 --> 03:28:46.360]  fundamental freedoms, and even our dignity to...
[03:28:46.360 --> 03:28:48.360]  James, we're about to go to break.
[03:28:48.360 --> 03:28:49.360]  On the other side of this break,
[03:28:49.360 --> 03:28:51.360]  we're going to explain what the IHR is
[03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:53.360]  so that people know what actions they're going to take
[03:28:53.360 --> 03:28:55.360]  and stay with us.
[03:28:57.360 --> 03:28:59.360]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years
[03:28:59.360 --> 03:29:02.360]  since high school, and they had great effects.
[03:29:02.360 --> 03:29:04.360]  And the science has gotten better and better
[03:29:04.360 --> 03:29:06.360]  and better over the years.
[03:29:06.360 --> 03:29:08.360]  And now, with all the things we're bombarded with
[03:29:08.360 --> 03:29:11.360]  and the water and the food and the feminizing factors,
[03:29:11.360 --> 03:29:13.360]  it is more important than ever to use the compounds
[03:29:13.360 --> 03:29:16.360]  God gave us to boost our natural male potential.
[03:29:16.360 --> 03:29:18.360]  But these products work great for women as well.
[03:29:18.360 --> 03:29:20.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[03:29:20.360 --> 03:29:23.360]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[03:29:23.360 --> 03:29:26.360]  We got it discounted for 40% off InfoWarsTour.com
[03:29:26.360 --> 03:29:29.360]  under the label InfoWars Platinum.
[03:29:29.360 --> 03:29:31.360]  We've also got HGH Max Boost.
[03:29:31.360 --> 03:29:33.360]  Read all about it, be very safe with it.
[03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:35.360]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first
[03:29:35.360 --> 03:29:37.360]  and take it before you go to bed at night.
[03:29:37.360 --> 03:29:39.360]  Don't do it during the day.
[03:29:39.360 --> 03:29:41.360]  1776 testosterone boost.
[03:29:41.360 --> 03:29:43.360]  Totally incredible.
[03:29:43.360 --> 03:29:44.360]  Go read about them.

[03:29:54.360 --> 03:30:12.360]  under the new name InfoWars Platinum.
[03:30:24.360 --> 03:30:31.360]  The translation is,
[03:30:31.360 --> 03:30:34.360]  I looked and behold a pale horse
[03:30:34.360 --> 03:30:37.360]  and his name that sat on him was death
[03:30:37.360 --> 03:30:40.360]  and hell followed with him.
[03:30:40.360 --> 03:30:42.360]  A book of Revelation.
[03:30:42.360 --> 03:30:45.360]  Very serious times to be alive, folks.
[03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:47.360]  They're not just doing this as a one-off.
[03:30:47.360 --> 03:30:49.360]  This is the beginning of the rest of our lives.
[03:30:49.360 --> 03:30:51.360]  This is our fight and I'm proud of humanity.
[03:30:51.360 --> 03:30:53.360]  The globalists even admit it's leaked.
[03:30:53.360 --> 03:30:55.360]  They're very upset that they're losing
[03:30:55.360 --> 03:30:57.360]  and that this hasn't gone the way they thought it would.
[03:30:57.360 --> 03:30:59.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars Live products
[03:30:59.360 --> 03:31:01.360]  have always been the highest quality,
[03:31:01.360 --> 03:31:04.360]  triple-tested, and you've seen the right reviews.
[03:31:04.360 --> 03:31:06.360]  But doing deep research,
[03:31:06.360 --> 03:31:09.360]  we made contact with the top company in the United States
[03:31:09.360 --> 03:31:11.360]  and it turned out they were supplying
[03:31:11.360 --> 03:31:13.360]  almost all the raw materials
[03:31:13.360 --> 03:31:15.360]  to the companies that we were already using.
[03:31:15.360 --> 03:31:17.360]  So we've gone directly to the source
[03:31:17.360 --> 03:31:20.360]  and that means we can give you lower prices
[03:31:20.360 --> 03:31:22.360]  on the very same high-quality supplements
[03:31:22.360 --> 03:31:24.360]  and in some cases even better.

[03:31:52.360 --> 03:31:54.360]  than the same product on store shelves

[03:31:58.360 --> 03:32:00.360]  Come to command here
[03:32:00.360 --> 03:32:03.360]  with an important message to humanity.
[03:32:03.360 --> 03:32:06.360]  I have decided that all of you
[03:32:06.360 --> 03:32:09.360]  will take a special injection
[03:32:09.360 --> 03:32:11.360]  so that you will be safe.
[03:32:11.360 --> 03:32:14.360]  But the injection is not ready.
[03:32:14.360 --> 03:32:16.360]  And so,
[03:32:16.360 --> 03:32:19.360]  I need all of you to stay indoors
[03:32:19.360 --> 03:32:21.360]  for the next 15 days
[03:32:21.360 --> 03:32:23.360]  to flatten the cans.
[03:32:23.360 --> 03:32:26.360]  I also need you to wear masks
[03:32:26.360 --> 03:32:29.360]  and I also need you to only shop
[03:32:29.360 --> 03:32:31.360]  at mega corporations.
[03:32:31.360 --> 03:32:35.360]  That way we can consolidate control
[03:32:35.360 --> 03:32:37.360]  and bankrupt the world economy,
[03:32:37.360 --> 03:32:40.360]  leaving companies that only I own
[03:32:40.360 --> 03:32:42.360]  profitable.
[03:32:42.360 --> 03:32:44.360]  You will then be my slaves.
[03:32:44.360 --> 03:32:48.360]  Oh, and then you get that special shot
[03:32:48.360 --> 03:32:50.360]  and get him from KELPRA
[03:32:50.360 --> 03:32:52.360]  who will move your immune system
[03:32:52.360 --> 03:32:54.360]  so you'll be dependent on me
[03:32:54.360 --> 03:32:56.360]  for the rest of your miserable lives.
[03:32:58.360 --> 03:33:00.360]  Leading a frontal assault
[03:33:00.360 --> 03:33:03.360]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:33:03.360 --> 03:33:05.360]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:13.360 --> 03:33:15.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.360 --> 03:33:17.360]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z
[03:33:17.360 --> 03:33:19.360]  with special guest, James Roguski,
[03:33:19.360 --> 03:33:21.360]  here today talking about the
[03:33:21.360 --> 03:33:23.360]  international health regulations.
[03:33:23.360 --> 03:33:25.360]  Now, before we go into the action
[03:33:25.360 --> 03:33:27.360]  the countries can take,
[03:33:27.360 --> 03:33:29.360]  I want to actually define what the IHR is.
[03:33:29.360 --> 03:33:31.360]  So, the international health regulations,
[03:33:31.360 --> 03:33:33.360]  according to the WHO's website,
[03:33:33.360 --> 03:33:35.360]  are an instrument of international law
[03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:38.360]  that is legally binding on 196 countries,
[03:33:38.360 --> 03:33:41.360]  including the 194 who member states.
[03:33:41.360 --> 03:33:43.360]  The United States and Australia
[03:33:43.360 --> 03:33:45.360]  are both on that list.
[03:33:45.360 --> 03:33:47.360]  The IHR grew out of the response
[03:33:47.360 --> 03:33:49.360]  to deadly epidemics
[03:33:49.360 --> 03:33:51.360]  that once overran Europe,
[03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:53.360]  they create rights and obligations for countries,
[03:33:53.360 --> 03:33:55.360]  including the requirement
[03:33:55.360 --> 03:33:57.360]  to report public health events.
[03:33:57.360 --> 03:33:59.360]  The regulations also outline the criteria
[03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:01.360]  to determine whether or not
[03:34:01.360 --> 03:34:03.360]  a particular event constitutes
[03:34:03.360 --> 03:34:05.360]  a public health emergency of international concern.
[03:34:05.360 --> 03:34:07.360]  As we saw with monkeypox,
[03:34:07.360 --> 03:34:09.360]  they will declare a public health emergency
[03:34:09.360 --> 03:34:11.360]  of international concern
[03:34:11.360 --> 03:34:13.360]  at the drop of a hat.
[03:34:13.360 --> 03:34:15.360]  They don't need anything of concern
[03:34:15.360 --> 03:34:17.360]  in order to declare that.
[03:34:17.360 --> 03:34:19.360]  And all of a sudden, the world goes into panic.
[03:34:19.360 --> 03:34:21.360]  We get told which injections
[03:34:21.360 --> 03:34:23.360]  we have to take
[03:34:23.360 --> 03:34:25.360]  according to the agreements
[03:34:25.360 --> 03:34:27.360]  that the WHO has with Big Pharma,
[03:34:27.360 --> 03:34:29.360]  which, by the way, now,
[03:34:29.360 --> 03:34:31.360]  Australia has pledged $10 million
[03:34:31.360 --> 03:34:33.360]  into the global pandemic fund.
[03:34:33.360 --> 03:34:35.360]  We're running the global pandemic centre
[03:34:35.360 --> 03:34:37.360]  out of this country. It's why I keep telling people,
[03:34:37.360 --> 03:34:39.360]  watch Australia. It is hell on Earth here.
[03:34:39.360 --> 03:34:41.360]  Even though it doesn't necessarily look like it,
[03:34:41.360 --> 03:34:43.360]  we are in the eye of the storm.
[03:34:43.360 --> 03:34:45.360]  And so we've pledged that money
[03:34:45.360 --> 03:34:47.360]  into the global pandemic fund.
[03:34:47.360 --> 03:34:49.360]  What they can do with that is essentially now
[03:34:49.360 --> 03:34:51.360]  with the proposed amendments that James is talking about.
[03:34:51.360 --> 03:34:53.360]  This information will literally save lives.
[03:34:53.360 --> 03:34:55.360]  They can then
[03:34:55.360 --> 03:34:57.360]  seize the funds
[03:34:57.360 --> 03:34:59.360]  that a country has pledged
[03:34:59.360 --> 03:35:01.360]  into that global monetary fund
[03:35:01.360 --> 03:35:03.360]  and refuse to give them back to countries,
[03:35:03.360 --> 03:35:05.360]  which means that life-saving medications
[03:35:05.360 --> 03:35:07.360]  won't be supplied if you don't comply
[03:35:07.360 --> 03:35:09.360]  with their forced shots, their next round
[03:35:09.360 --> 03:35:11.360]  of shots. And believe me,
[03:35:11.360 --> 03:35:13.360]  they've told us another pandemic is coming
[03:35:13.360 --> 03:35:15.360]  and they're setting up the stage right now for it.
[03:35:15.360 --> 03:35:17.360]  So, James,
[03:35:17.360 --> 03:35:19.360]  I just want to go over some of the more alarming
[03:35:19.360 --> 03:35:21.360]  language in these articles
[03:35:21.360 --> 03:35:23.360]  before we actually talk to people about
[03:35:23.360 --> 03:35:25.360]  what they need to do.
[03:35:25.360 --> 03:35:27.360]  Article 3, obviously, I've raised this on this broadcast
[03:35:27.360 --> 03:35:29.360]  before. Removal of human dignity,
[03:35:29.360 --> 03:35:31.360]  fundamental freedoms
[03:35:31.360 --> 03:35:33.360]  and human rights. They want to scratch that out
[03:35:33.360 --> 03:35:35.360]  completely. It's so brazen.
[03:35:35.360 --> 03:35:37.360]  It's so in your face. It's unbelievable.
[03:35:37.360 --> 03:35:39.360]  What else should people be aware of
[03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:41.360]  within the amendments to the IHR
[03:35:41.360 --> 03:35:43.360]  which are legally binding for the United
[03:35:43.360 --> 03:35:45.360]  States, Australia and 194 countries?
[03:35:47.360 --> 03:35:49.360]  The first article of the amendments
[03:35:49.360 --> 03:35:51.360]  defines terms.
[03:35:51.360 --> 03:35:53.360]  And what you have to know at a start
[03:35:53.360 --> 03:35:55.360]  is there are many words that are not defined.
[03:35:55.360 --> 03:35:57.360]  So they change the definitions
[03:35:57.360 --> 03:35:59.360]  all the time. Words like vaccine
[03:35:59.360 --> 03:36:01.360]  and pandemic and safe and effective
[03:36:01.360 --> 03:36:03.360]  and so on and so on
[03:36:03.360 --> 03:36:05.360]  are not legally defined. So when you
[03:36:05.360 --> 03:36:07.360]  hear people using words that are not
[03:36:07.360 --> 03:36:09.360]  defined, you know they're lying to you.
[03:36:09.360 --> 03:36:11.360]  They're just making up the meaning as they go.
[03:36:11.360 --> 03:36:13.360]  What they would like to
[03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:15.360]  change and it's very important,
[03:36:15.360 --> 03:36:17.360]  the World Health Organization
[03:36:17.360 --> 03:36:19.360]  under article 23
[03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:21.360]  of the WHO Constitution
[03:36:21.360 --> 03:36:23.360]  is an advisory body
[03:36:23.360 --> 03:36:25.360]  that can make
[03:36:25.360 --> 03:36:27.360]  non-binding recommendations.
[03:36:27.360 --> 03:36:29.360]  They want to scratch out
[03:36:29.360 --> 03:36:31.360]  the words non-binding
[03:36:31.360 --> 03:36:33.360]  which would make it so that
[03:36:33.360 --> 03:36:35.360]  when they proclaim something, when they
[03:36:35.360 --> 03:36:37.360]  declare something, it's no longer
[03:36:37.360 --> 03:36:39.360]  just a recommendation, it's an order.
[03:36:39.360 --> 03:36:41.360]  And so they want
[03:36:41.360 --> 03:36:43.360]  to shift this all
[03:36:43.360 --> 03:36:45.360]  into a situation
[03:36:45.360 --> 03:36:47.360]  where rather than just recommending that
[03:36:47.360 --> 03:36:49.360]  a nation does something,
[03:36:49.360 --> 03:36:51.360]  and in article 18 you can see that
[03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:53.360]  they've made recommendations to do
[03:36:53.360 --> 03:36:55.360]  quarantines,
[03:36:55.360 --> 03:36:57.360]  lockdowns, masking.
[03:36:57.360 --> 03:36:59.360]  The other issues
[03:36:59.360 --> 03:37:01.360]  are they want to have
[03:37:01.360 --> 03:37:03.360]  control over whether or not
[03:37:03.360 --> 03:37:05.360]  they can tell people to take
[03:37:05.360 --> 03:37:07.360]  preventative measures or injections
[03:37:07.360 --> 03:37:09.360]  like vaccinations. Really
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:11.360]  it's wide open. You could let
[03:37:11.360 --> 03:37:13.360]  your imagination run rampant with you.
[03:37:13.360 --> 03:37:15.360]  They want to have the power
[03:37:15.360 --> 03:37:17.360]  to tell everybody what to do.
[03:37:17.360 --> 03:37:19.360]  And one of the main things that
[03:37:19.360 --> 03:37:21.360]  they want to institute
[03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:23.360]  was clearly the cat was
[03:37:23.360 --> 03:37:25.360]  let out of the bag during the G20
[03:37:25.360 --> 03:37:27.360]  when the Indonesian
[03:37:27.360 --> 03:37:29.360]  health minister who's really a banker
[03:37:29.360 --> 03:37:31.360]  said very clearly
[03:37:31.360 --> 03:37:33.360]  that Indonesia was proud that
[03:37:33.360 --> 03:37:35.360]  they had submitted amendments
[03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:37.360]  to institute a global
[03:37:37.360 --> 03:37:39.360]  digital health certificate.
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:41.360]  Now that's not just digital, they have a paper
[03:37:41.360 --> 03:37:43.360]  backup so don't think that if you don't have
[03:37:43.360 --> 03:37:45.360]  a phone you're going to get away from it.
[03:37:45.360 --> 03:37:47.360]  Essentially they want everyone to have a
[03:37:47.360 --> 03:37:49.360]  QR code which would
[03:37:49.360 --> 03:37:51.360]  access their private
[03:37:51.360 --> 03:37:53.360]  health related data.
[03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.360]  Now that's a clear violation
[03:37:55.360 --> 03:37:57.360]  of the right to privacy in the Fourth
[03:37:57.360 --> 03:37:59.360]  Amendment and it's also a clear
[03:37:59.360 --> 03:38:01.360]  violation of the Tenth Amendment
[03:38:01.360 --> 03:38:03.360]  because the federal government does not
[03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:05.360]  have in the United States
[03:38:05.360 --> 03:38:07.360]  the right to control health
[03:38:07.360 --> 03:38:09.360]  and so all of the state legislatures
[03:38:09.360 --> 03:38:11.360]  need to step up
[03:38:11.360 --> 03:38:13.360]  and defend states rights
[03:38:13.360 --> 03:38:15.360]  because the United States and they know
[03:38:15.360 --> 03:38:17.360]  this very well and in
[03:38:17.360 --> 03:38:19.360]  the document that they
[03:38:19.360 --> 03:38:21.360]  signed in 2007
[03:38:21.360 --> 03:38:23.360]  they clearly stated in the existing
[03:38:23.360 --> 03:38:25.360]  health regulations on page 60
[03:38:25.360 --> 03:38:27.360]  and 61 that the federal
[03:38:27.360 --> 03:38:29.360]  government knows
[03:38:29.360 --> 03:38:31.360]  that they cannot make the states
[03:38:31.360 --> 03:38:33.360]  comply. They can only encourage
[03:38:33.360 --> 03:38:35.360]  them and how that really works
[03:38:35.360 --> 03:38:37.360]  is they either bribe or extort
[03:38:37.360 --> 03:38:39.360]  them by saying well if you don't
[03:38:39.360 --> 03:38:41.360]  do what we want you to do we're not going to give you money
[03:38:41.360 --> 03:38:43.360]  for this that and the other program.
[03:38:43.360 --> 03:38:45.360]  This is all
[03:38:45.360 --> 03:38:47.360]  an incredibly large
[03:38:47.360 --> 03:38:49.360]  organized crime syndicate.
[03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:51.360]  They're laundering money
[03:38:51.360 --> 03:38:53.360]  to feed their crony capitalist
[03:38:53.360 --> 03:38:55.360]  members of what I call
[03:38:55.360 --> 03:38:57.360]  the pharmaceutical hospital emergency
[03:38:57.360 --> 03:38:59.360]  industrial complex. They want
[03:38:59.360 --> 03:39:01.360]  to redirect billions of dollars
[03:39:01.360 --> 03:39:03.360]  into the pharmaceutical industry
[03:39:03.360 --> 03:39:05.360]  and use it as bribes
[03:39:05.360 --> 03:39:07.360]  to get nations who would
[03:39:07.360 --> 03:39:09.360]  love to have that investment even though
[03:39:09.360 --> 03:39:11.360]  they don't realize they're investing
[03:39:11.360 --> 03:39:13.360]  things that are just poisonous.
[03:39:13.360 --> 03:39:15.360]  They want the votes
[03:39:15.360 --> 03:39:17.360]  for the promise of equity
[03:39:17.360 --> 03:39:19.360]  and equity doesn't mean equality
[03:39:19.360 --> 03:39:21.360]  equity means
[03:39:21.360 --> 03:39:23.360]  money and you know follow the money people
[03:39:23.360 --> 03:39:25.360]  it's always the case.
[03:39:25.360 --> 03:39:27.360]  They want to control your lives they want to have
[03:39:27.360 --> 03:39:29.360]  a QR code that
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:31.360]  taps into your private health data
[03:39:31.360 --> 03:39:33.360]  so that they can say well you have to get
[03:39:33.360 --> 03:39:35.360]  this treatment this preventive medications
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:37.360]  these injections whatever
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:39.360]  it may be and
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:41.360]  in article two they've expanded
[03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:43.360]  the scope from
[03:39:43.360 --> 03:39:45.360]  emergencies
[03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:47.360]  to anything that could
[03:39:47.360 --> 03:39:49.360]  potentially be
[03:39:49.360 --> 03:39:51.360]  an emergency.
[03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:53.360]  Someone sneezes
[03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:55.360]  in Venezuela
[03:39:55.360 --> 03:39:57.360]  and they say this could lead to a pandemic
[03:39:57.360 --> 03:39:59.360]  we need everyone to take
[03:39:59.360 --> 03:40:01.360]  XYZ injection and I'm not
[03:40:01.360 --> 03:40:03.360]  even exaggerating
[03:40:03.360 --> 03:40:05.360]  here because if you breed the WHO's
[03:40:05.360 --> 03:40:07.360]  immunization agenda
[03:40:07.360 --> 03:40:09.360]  2030 document they have in there
[03:40:09.360 --> 03:40:11.360]  that they want to introduce 500 new vaccines
[03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:13.360]  vaccines to
[03:40:13.360 --> 03:40:15.360]  the world by 2030.
[03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:17.360]  Now some of those are on the regular
[03:40:17.360 --> 03:40:19.360]  schedule and people have argued with me
[03:40:19.360 --> 03:40:21.360]  some of these are on the regular schedule
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:23.360]  yes but some are not and they've told
[03:40:23.360 --> 03:40:25.360]  us clearly in the
[03:40:25.360 --> 03:40:27.360]  Australia's pandemic preparedness
[03:40:27.360 --> 03:40:29.360]  plan and I'm sure that every country
[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:31.360]  has the same thing that they want
[03:40:31.360 --> 03:40:33.360]  to preemptively vaccinate
[03:40:33.360 --> 03:40:35.360]  and I won't even use that word it's inject
[03:40:35.360 --> 03:40:37.360]  they want to preemptively inject people
[03:40:37.360 --> 03:40:39.360]  for a potential pandemic and this will
[03:40:39.360 --> 03:40:41.360]  be a lifelong cycle not just that James
[03:40:41.360 --> 03:40:43.360]  they want regular testing
[03:40:43.360 --> 03:40:45.360]  they want to regularly collect
[03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:47.360]  data from people
[03:40:47.360 --> 03:40:49.360]  including samples of
[03:40:49.360 --> 03:40:51.360]  their DNA and samples of their blood
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:53.360]  and God knows what else
[03:40:53.360 --> 03:40:55.360]  you know to summarize it
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:40:57.360]  they have no respect for your rights
[03:40:57.360 --> 03:40:59.360]  you know your human rights your fundamental
[03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:01.360]  freedoms
[03:41:01.360 --> 03:41:03.360]  Maria you're either reading my articles
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:05.360]  or your psychic or both
[03:41:05.360 --> 03:41:07.360]  or you're just paying attention because you said
[03:41:07.360 --> 03:41:09.360]  Venezuela and
[03:41:09.360 --> 03:41:11.360]  oh looks like we've lost James
[03:41:11.360 --> 03:41:13.360]  there
[03:41:13.360 --> 03:41:15.360]  I'm not sure what he was about to say
[03:41:15.360 --> 03:41:17.360]  but I'm intrigued
[03:41:17.360 --> 03:41:19.360]  if you what he's
[03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:21.360]  here we go James you're back
[03:41:21.360 --> 03:41:23.360]  if you go to
[03:41:23.360 --> 03:41:25.360]  catastrophic contagion
[03:41:25.360 --> 03:41:27.360]  dot com
[03:41:27.360 --> 03:41:29.360]  you'll see that their latest
[03:41:29.360 --> 03:41:31.360]  tabletop exercise their latest
[03:41:31.360 --> 03:41:33.360]  simulation much like
[03:41:33.360 --> 03:41:35.360]  Agenda 201
[03:41:35.360 --> 03:41:37.360]  that was just a couple of months before
[03:41:37.360 --> 03:41:39.360]  all of this happened with COVID
[03:41:39.360 --> 03:41:41.360]  if you go to catastrophic contagion
[03:41:41.360 --> 03:41:43.360]  dot com you'll see that
[03:41:43.360 --> 03:41:45.360]  their next problem
[03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:47.360]  is actually scheduled to be in
[03:41:47.360 --> 03:41:49.360]  Venezuela and so it's
[03:41:49.360 --> 03:41:51.360]  you know they're predicting
[03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:53.360]  a childhood outbreak
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:55.360]  it's S E E R S
[03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:57.360]  it's an entero virus and
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:41:59.360]  basically what they are crafting
[03:41:59.360 --> 03:42:01.360]  with these amendments is the
[03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:03.360]  ability
[03:42:05.360 --> 03:42:07.360]  looks like we keep losing James there
[03:42:07.360 --> 03:42:09.360]  what I think what he was about to say is
[03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:11.360]  what they're crafting with these amendments is the
[03:42:11.360 --> 03:42:13.360]  ability to have
[03:42:13.360 --> 03:42:15.360]  an advanced system
[03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:17.360]  much more than what they previously had
[03:42:17.360 --> 03:42:19.360]  so as he said that before they were
[03:42:19.360 --> 03:42:21.360]  recommendations and now
[03:42:21.360 --> 03:42:23.360]  it's talking about the
[03:42:23.360 --> 03:42:25.360]  WHO being able to enforce so before
[03:42:25.360 --> 03:42:27.360]  where countries were saying oh we're listening to the
[03:42:27.360 --> 03:42:29.360]  WHO's recommendations no no now
[03:42:29.360 --> 03:42:31.360]  it's going to be we're listening to the
[03:42:31.360 --> 03:42:33.360]  WHO's orders during
[03:42:33.360 --> 03:42:35.360]  the next manufactured pandemic which
[03:42:35.360 --> 03:42:37.360]  Biden said is coming Gates has said is coming
[03:42:37.360 --> 03:42:39.360]  the WHO has said is coming
[03:42:39.360 --> 03:42:41.360]  Australia said is coming every country knows
[03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:43.360]  this is coming it's only a matter of time
[03:42:43.360 --> 03:42:45.360]  and the building blocks for them to be able
[03:42:45.360 --> 03:42:47.360]  to forcefully inject people lock them up
[03:42:47.360 --> 03:42:49.360]  reeducate them of being set up as
[03:42:49.360 --> 03:42:51.360]  we speak this is a warning for the whole
[03:42:51.360 --> 03:42:53.360]  world we'll be back right after this short
[03:42:53.360 --> 03:42:55.360]  break with more on this topic
[03:42:55.360 --> 03:42:57.360]  there is
[03:42:57.360 --> 03:42:59.360]  a war on for your mind
[03:42:59.360 --> 03:43:01.360]  your mind is a battlefield

[03:43:03.360 --> 03:43:05.360]  info wars popularized
[03:43:05.360 --> 03:43:07.360]  those terms more than two decades
[03:43:07.360 --> 03:43:09.360]  ago and today whether it's
[03:43:09.360 --> 03:43:11.360]  Donald Trump or Governor
[03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:13.360]  Sannis or Dr. Robert Malone
[03:43:13.360 --> 03:43:15.360]  they're all using the terms
[03:43:15.360 --> 03:43:17.360]  that info wars has popularized
[03:43:17.360 --> 03:43:19.360]  because we understand the enemy's operations
[03:43:19.360 --> 03:43:21.360]  and we know how to beat them
[03:43:21.360 --> 03:43:23.360]  but we can't do it without funding

[03:43:57.360 --> 03:43:59.360]  so when I first started taking
[03:43:59.360 --> 03:44:01.360]  survival shield basically I was
[03:44:01.360 --> 03:44:03.360]  275 pounds I was overweight
[03:44:03.360 --> 03:44:05.360]  I had brain fog like you wouldn't believe
[03:44:05.360 --> 03:44:07.360]  I was barely holding on to a job
[03:44:07.360 --> 03:44:09.360]  and I heard Dr. Group on your show and I listened to it
[03:44:09.360 --> 03:44:11.360]  so the first one I got was the original
[03:44:11.360 --> 03:44:13.360]  survival shield the X1 and it worked
[03:44:13.360 --> 03:44:15.360]  pretty good and then shortly thereafter
[03:44:15.360 --> 03:44:17.360]  you came out with that too you had
[03:44:17.360 --> 03:44:19.360]  you know with a deep burn source you know and I got really excited about that
[03:44:19.360 --> 03:44:21.360]  so I took it and man in two weeks
[03:44:21.360 --> 03:44:23.360]  I went from brain fog
[03:44:23.360 --> 03:44:25.360]  to like literally like my brain
[03:44:25.360 --> 03:44:27.360]  was enlightened you know I could think
[03:44:27.360 --> 03:44:29.360]  again I could connect with people again
[03:44:29.360 --> 03:44:31.360]  and over the course of the next
[03:44:31.360 --> 03:44:33.360]  couple of years I got my health back
[03:44:33.360 --> 03:44:35.360]  and I religiously took basically all of your supplements
[03:44:35.360 --> 03:44:37.360]  they're all absolutely amazing
[03:44:37.360 --> 03:44:39.360]  supplements the one I like recently
[03:44:39.360 --> 03:44:41.360]  is knockout it literally like if you want
[03:44:41.360 --> 03:44:43.360]  to sleep just take it it's amazing it works
[03:44:43.360 --> 03:44:45.360]  but anyway so the point is we have to
[03:44:45.360 --> 03:44:47.360]  get ourselves clean we have to break free
[03:44:47.360 --> 03:44:49.360]  of the globalist system and the only way
[03:44:49.360 --> 03:44:51.360]  to do that is to take our own health
[03:44:51.360 --> 03:44:53.360]  into our own hands beautifully said brother

[03:47:31.360 --> 03:47:33.360]  a stop to the IHR amendments I want to
[03:47:33.360 --> 03:47:35.360]  just let people know the previous path
[03:47:35.360 --> 03:47:37.360]  that the WHO took which was
[03:47:37.360 --> 03:47:39.360]  to to go down
[03:47:39.360 --> 03:47:41.360]  the path of a WHO treaty
[03:47:41.360 --> 03:47:43.360]  was actually stopped
[03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:45.360]  earlier last year
[03:47:45.360 --> 03:47:47.360]  we got stopped the treaty trending
[03:47:47.360 --> 03:47:49.360]  on twitter we got it we got it all over
[03:47:49.360 --> 03:47:51.360]  social media we campaigned
[03:47:51.360 --> 03:47:53.360]  that's my part it's the digital war
[03:47:53.360 --> 03:47:55.360]  and then other people went
[03:47:55.360 --> 03:47:57.360]  and raised awareness on the streets
[03:47:57.360 --> 03:47:59.360]  talk to people in parliament
[03:47:59.360 --> 03:48:01.360]  in government and
[03:48:01.360 --> 03:48:03.360]  the UK actually got involved
[03:48:03.360 --> 03:48:05.360]  the UK
[03:48:05.360 --> 03:48:07.360]  a case a legal case in the UK
[03:48:07.360 --> 03:48:09.360]  helped put a stop to the treaty
[03:48:09.360 --> 03:48:11.360]  dead in its tracks last
[03:48:11.360 --> 03:48:13.360]  time that they proposed it so it is
[03:48:13.360 --> 03:48:15.360]  possible I want people to know it's not a
[03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:17.360]  doomed situation but it does
[03:48:17.360 --> 03:48:19.360]  require people to get involved
[03:48:19.360 --> 03:48:21.360]  and make sure that we put a stop to this
[03:48:21.360 --> 03:48:23.360]  while we wait on James I'll continue
[03:48:23.360 --> 03:48:25.360]  telling you about what's happening
[03:48:25.360 --> 03:48:27.360]  this time around so stop the treaty

[03:48:29.360 --> 03:48:31.360]  victory for freedom loving
[03:48:31.360 --> 03:48:33.360]  people all around the world now we
[03:48:33.360 --> 03:48:35.360]  want to put a stop to the IHR amendments
[03:48:35.360 --> 03:48:37.360]  and we can do it again
[03:48:37.360 --> 03:48:39.360]  James talk to us about what you've put together
[03:48:39.360 --> 03:48:41.360]  in the next couple of minutes
[03:48:41.360 --> 03:48:43.360]  step number one is really very easy
[03:48:43.360 --> 03:48:45.360]  and we're doing it right now
[03:48:45.360 --> 03:48:47.360]  and everyone who's listening to this if you just
[03:48:47.360 --> 03:48:49.360]  share this video this audio however
[03:48:49.360 --> 03:48:51.360]  you get access to it
[03:48:51.360 --> 03:48:53.360]  99.9%
[03:48:53.360 --> 03:48:55.360]  of people on the planet are unaware
[03:48:55.360 --> 03:48:57.360]  that this is happening they've been
[03:48:57.360 --> 03:48:59.360]  trying to keep it secret
[03:48:59.360 --> 03:49:01.360]  and while that's all that's a curse
[03:49:01.360 --> 03:49:03.360]  it's also a blessing
[03:49:03.360 --> 03:49:05.360]  they would love to have nobody
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:07.360]  pay any attention to this
[03:49:07.360 --> 03:49:09.360]  do it all in secret have it pop
[03:49:09.360 --> 03:49:11.360]  up in May and then just have
[03:49:11.360 --> 03:49:13.360]  a vote of
[03:49:13.360 --> 03:49:15.360]  ascension to it and oh there's
[03:49:15.360 --> 03:49:17.360]  no objection so boom it passes and
[03:49:17.360 --> 03:49:19.360]  before you know it you're in lockdown
[03:49:19.360 --> 03:49:21.360]  when everyone is looking
[03:49:21.360 --> 03:49:23.360]  at it and they know what it is
[03:49:23.360 --> 03:49:25.360]  because the WHO
[03:49:25.360 --> 03:49:27.360]  is trying to hide it
[03:49:27.360 --> 03:49:29.360]  they've failed in the one thing that they
[03:49:29.360 --> 03:49:31.360]  might be sort of good at which is they're
[03:49:31.360 --> 03:49:33.360]  not doing an enormous
[03:49:33.360 --> 03:49:35.360]  propaganda campaign
[03:49:35.360 --> 03:49:37.360]  people have not been pre-programmed
[03:49:37.360 --> 03:49:39.360]  to believe oh
[03:49:39.360 --> 03:49:41.360]  we must give all of our power to the
[03:49:41.360 --> 03:49:43.360]  WHO and we must amend the
[03:49:43.360 --> 03:49:45.360]  international health regulations when
[03:49:45.360 --> 03:49:47.360]  you share this information with the average
[03:49:47.360 --> 03:49:49.360]  person they look at you sideways
[03:49:49.360 --> 03:49:51.360]  a little bit and they go international health
[03:49:51.360 --> 03:49:53.360]  regulations what are you talking about
[03:49:53.360 --> 03:49:55.360]  now they may have heard of the pandemic
[03:49:55.360 --> 03:49:57.360]  treaty and you just have to go
[03:49:57.360 --> 03:49:59.360]  no no no no no that's
[03:49:59.360 --> 03:50:01.360]  not what this is if
[03:50:01.360 --> 03:50:03.360]  anybody says the word treaty that is
[03:50:03.360 --> 03:50:05.360]  not what we're talking about this is
[03:50:05.360 --> 03:50:07.360]  different and when you show
[03:50:07.360 --> 03:50:09.360]  them just a little bit of information
[03:50:09.360 --> 03:50:11.360]  and they see that they want to cross
[03:50:11.360 --> 03:50:13.360]  out fundamental freedoms human
[03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:15.360]  rights and dignity and they want to
[03:50:15.360 --> 03:50:17.360]  have vaccine passports
[03:50:17.360 --> 03:50:19.360]  and digital health certificates and they
[03:50:19.360 --> 03:50:21.360]  want to give all power to one
[03:50:21.360 --> 03:50:23.360]  person to declare
[03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:25.360]  emergencies and one of
[03:50:25.360 --> 03:50:27.360]  the things we didn't talk about was
[03:50:27.360 --> 03:50:29.360]  he would then have the ability to create
[03:50:29.360 --> 03:50:31.360]  an allocation plan
[03:50:31.360 --> 03:50:33.360]  which is clearly Marxist
[03:50:33.360 --> 03:50:35.360]  philosophy he would be
[03:50:35.360 --> 03:50:37.360]  able to tell country A
[03:50:37.360 --> 03:50:39.360]  that there are manufacturers that have to
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:41.360]  make certain products pharmaceutical drugs
[03:50:41.360 --> 03:50:43.360]  and injectables and
[03:50:43.360 --> 03:50:45.360]  provide them and give them to
[03:50:45.360 --> 03:50:47.360]  country B you look
[03:50:47.360 --> 03:50:49.360]  at that and you go well I don't think it's
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:51.360]  what we want to have one person being
[03:50:51.360 --> 03:50:53.360]  charged of the means of production
[03:50:53.360 --> 03:50:55.360]  of the pharmaceutical hospital
[03:50:55.360 --> 03:50:57.360]  emergency industrial complex
[03:50:57.360 --> 03:50:59.360]  and so anyone who looks
[03:50:59.360 --> 03:51:01.360]  at this is
[03:51:01.360 --> 03:51:03.360]  gutterily they're punched in the gut
[03:51:03.360 --> 03:51:05.360]  these are the documents
[03:51:05.360 --> 03:51:07.360]  that are enacting
[03:51:07.360 --> 03:51:09.360]  the very thing that Alex Jones
[03:51:09.360 --> 03:51:11.360]  has been talking about for decades
[03:51:11.360 --> 03:51:13.360]  it's
[03:51:13.360 --> 03:51:15.360]  go time people now is the time
[03:51:15.360 --> 03:51:17.360]  and so I've put together a system
[03:51:17.360 --> 03:51:19.360]  by which it makes it easy
[03:51:19.360 --> 03:51:21.360]  to contact congress
[03:51:21.360 --> 03:51:23.360]  you can send emails
[03:51:23.360 --> 03:51:25.360]  with the push of a button but that's not
[03:51:25.360 --> 03:51:27.360]  good enough you've got it really
[03:51:27.360 --> 03:51:29.360]  get up in their face call them
[03:51:29.360 --> 03:51:31.360]  set up a visit
[03:51:31.360 --> 03:51:33.360]  there are allies
[03:51:33.360 --> 03:51:35.360]  in congress not all of them
[03:51:35.360 --> 03:51:37.360]  many of them are probably
[03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:39.360]  for this they are
[03:51:39.360 --> 03:51:41.360]  globalists they want to give up
[03:51:41.360 --> 03:51:43.360]  American sovereignty
[03:51:43.360 --> 03:51:45.360]  and personal freedoms
[03:51:45.360 --> 03:51:47.360]  but there are allies we need to identify
[03:51:47.360 --> 03:51:49.360]  them work with them we've already done
[03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:51.360]  that in other countries as well
[03:51:51.360 --> 03:51:53.360]  and you know now that congress is finally
[03:51:53.360 --> 03:51:55.360]  you know picked a speaker
[03:51:55.360 --> 03:51:57.360]  now is the time to let them know
[03:51:57.360 --> 03:51:59.360]  that you the people we the
[03:51:59.360 --> 03:52:01.360]  people know what is going
[03:52:01.360 --> 03:52:03.360]  on in Geneva most
[03:52:03.360 --> 03:52:05.360]  of the viewers here know more about this
[03:52:05.360 --> 03:52:07.360]  already than most of the people
[03:52:07.360 --> 03:52:09.360]  in congress and so
[03:52:09.360 --> 03:52:11.360]  and I want to say something James a lot of people
[03:52:11.360 --> 03:52:13.360]  a lot of people have lost faith
[03:52:13.360 --> 03:52:15.360]  in the government and their and their ability
[03:52:15.360 --> 03:52:17.360]  to respond to the public's demands
[03:52:17.360 --> 03:52:19.360]  but let me tell you something if it's not just
[03:52:19.360 --> 03:52:21.360]  a handful of people if it's you
[03:52:21.360 --> 03:52:23.360]  your neighbor your brother your sister
[03:52:23.360 --> 03:52:25.360]  absolutely everyone that you know your kids
[03:52:25.360 --> 03:52:27.360]  your parents if every single
[03:52:27.360 --> 03:52:29.360]  person hammers
[03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:31.360]  their members of congress hammers
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:33.360]  their people in parliament and again I'm going to repeat
[03:52:33.360 --> 03:52:35.360]  Australian action is coming very very soon
[03:52:35.360 --> 03:52:37.360]  we've been in meetings this week we've got
[03:52:37.360 --> 03:52:39.360]  senators on board this is
[03:52:39.360 --> 03:52:41.360]  we are we are doing something
[03:52:41.360 --> 03:52:43.360]  with this but you know if every
[03:52:43.360 --> 03:52:45.360]  single person just constantly
[03:52:45.360 --> 03:52:47.360]  brings this up with these
[03:52:47.360 --> 03:52:49.360]  so-called elected officials
[03:52:49.360 --> 03:52:51.360]  they won't have a chair a choice but
[03:52:51.360 --> 03:52:53.360]  to respond because they will be inundated
[03:52:53.360 --> 03:52:55.360]  and this is what needs to happen this
[03:52:55.360 --> 03:52:57.360]  is the most important issue facing
[03:52:57.360 --> 03:52:59.360]  the world right now if we don't stop this
[03:52:59.360 --> 03:53:01.360]  we will be controlled by terror
[03:53:01.360 --> 03:53:03.360]  terrorist Ted Ross who has
[03:53:03.360 --> 03:53:05.360]  previously withheld life-saving
[03:53:05.360 --> 03:53:07.360]  medication in Ethiopia
[03:53:07.360 --> 03:53:09.360]  and also during
[03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:11.360]  COVID-19 let's just be honest
[03:53:11.360 --> 03:53:13.360]  I have
[03:53:13.360 --> 03:53:15.360]  every faith in the world that the
[03:53:15.360 --> 03:53:17.360]  power of the people united
[03:53:17.360 --> 03:53:19.360]  is greater than the people
[03:53:19.360 --> 03:53:21.360]  who are illegitimately in power
[03:53:21.360 --> 03:53:23.360]  and so our numbers
[03:53:23.360 --> 03:53:25.360]  are enormous
[03:53:25.360 --> 03:53:27.360]  but we have a task that we have to accomplish
[03:53:27.360 --> 03:53:29.360]  number one we have to share
[03:53:29.360 --> 03:53:31.360]  this information with people
[03:53:31.360 --> 03:53:33.360]  and I'm so serious about this I do something
[03:53:33.360 --> 03:53:35.360]  that everybody thinks I'm crazy
[03:53:35.360 --> 03:53:37.360]  and that's why I glitched out earlier because
[03:53:37.360 --> 03:53:39.360]  someone was trying to get in touch with me
[03:53:39.360 --> 03:53:41.360]  you can call me directly my
[03:53:41.360 --> 03:53:43.360]  phone number is 310-619-3055
[03:53:47.360 --> 03:53:49.360]  I put it out there all the time
[03:53:49.360 --> 03:53:51.360]  I am that serious about this
[03:53:51.360 --> 03:53:53.360]  I am serious too
[03:53:53.360 --> 03:53:55.360]  call me I'll answer any questions
[03:53:55.360 --> 03:53:57.360]  that you have if you want to get involved
[03:53:57.360 --> 03:53:59.360]  in a bigger way than just sending some emails
[03:53:59.360 --> 03:54:01.360]  let me know and we'll work together on this
[03:54:01.360 --> 03:54:03.360]  this is a worldwide effort
[03:54:03.360 --> 03:54:05.360]  but America has to lead
[03:54:05.360 --> 03:54:07.360]  James has been doxing himself
[03:54:07.360 --> 03:54:09.360]  online for
[03:54:09.360 --> 03:54:11.360]  the longest time
[03:54:11.360 --> 03:54:13.360]  but he means it when he says it
[03:54:13.360 --> 03:54:15.360]  he's been collaborating with people
[03:54:15.360 --> 03:54:17.360]  all over the world helping other countries
[03:54:17.360 --> 03:54:19.360]  he's helped Canada he's helped Australia
[03:54:19.360 --> 03:54:21.360]  on occasion he's an amazing activist
[03:54:21.360 --> 03:54:23.360]  an amazing human being and that's why I brought
[03:54:23.360 --> 03:54:25.360]  him on today James thank you so much
[03:54:25.360 --> 03:54:27.360]  for all of the information that you've given
[03:54:27.360 --> 03:54:29.360]  everyone today and again head to
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:31.360]  jamesragusky.substack.com
[03:54:31.360 --> 03:54:33.360]  for more information share this
[03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:35.360]  information everywhere thank you again James
[03:54:35.360 --> 03:54:37.360]  thank you
[03:54:37.360 --> 03:54:39.360]  we really are
[03:54:39.360 --> 03:54:41.360]  staring down the barrel
[03:54:41.360 --> 03:54:43.360]  of complete and
[03:54:43.360 --> 03:54:45.360]  total control
[03:54:45.360 --> 03:54:47.360]  and I think that those words aren't harsh enough
[03:54:47.360 --> 03:54:49.360]  we're staring down the barrel
[03:54:49.360 --> 03:54:51.360]  of Joseph Mengele
[03:54:51.360 --> 03:54:53.360]  scientists
[03:54:53.360 --> 03:54:55.360]  not even real scientists
[03:54:55.360 --> 03:54:57.360]  being able to control every aspect
[03:54:57.360 --> 03:54:59.360]  of our lives including our ability
[03:54:59.360 --> 03:55:01.360]  to manage our own health and our own bodies
[03:55:01.360 --> 03:55:03.360]  and the problem is what James is talking about here
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:05.360]  again it will paralyze
[03:55:05.360 --> 03:55:07.360]  the countries where they have to comply
[03:55:07.360 --> 03:55:09.360]  with whatever the WHO says
[03:55:09.360 --> 03:55:11.360]  and we know that the WHO
[03:55:11.360 --> 03:55:13.360]  is a fake health organization
[03:55:13.360 --> 03:55:15.360]  these people
[03:55:15.360 --> 03:55:17.360]  have zero interest in health
[03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:19.360]  they have an interest in making
[03:55:19.360 --> 03:55:21.360]  children and women infertile
[03:55:21.360 --> 03:55:23.360]  in Africa they have an interest
[03:55:23.360 --> 03:55:25.360]  in making the world infertile with
[03:55:25.360 --> 03:55:27.360]  their poison shots and they've done so successfully
[03:55:27.360 --> 03:55:29.360]  unfortunately because of the people
[03:55:29.360 --> 03:55:31.360]  that didn't listen to the warnings in the beginning
[03:55:31.360 --> 03:55:33.360]  and now we have this explosion
[03:55:33.360 --> 03:55:35.360]  of deaths people dropping dead
[03:55:35.360 --> 03:55:37.360]  every single day football players
[03:55:37.360 --> 03:55:39.360]  the most healthy people in the world
[03:55:39.360 --> 03:55:41.360]  athletes that have been training
[03:55:41.360 --> 03:55:43.360]  every day their whole lives to get to the point
[03:55:43.360 --> 03:55:45.360]  of being professional athletes
[03:55:45.360 --> 03:55:47.360]  dropping on the field from cardiac arrest
[03:55:47.360 --> 03:55:49.360]  and you want to tell me it's because of a hit to the chest
[03:55:49.360 --> 03:55:51.360]  pull the other leg
[03:55:51.360 --> 03:55:53.360]  they did this
[03:55:53.360 --> 03:55:55.360]  successfully
[03:55:55.360 --> 03:55:57.360]  they orchestrated the biggest
[03:55:57.360 --> 03:55:59.360]  depopulation and disability
[03:55:59.360 --> 03:56:01.360]  plans successfully with the help of the WHO
[03:56:01.360 --> 03:56:03.360]  and the public
[03:56:03.360 --> 03:56:05.360]  is unaware
[03:56:05.360 --> 03:56:07.360]  and yes they are growing more aware
[03:56:07.360 --> 03:56:09.360]  and yes the resistance is rising and you are
[03:56:09.360 --> 03:56:11.360]  the resistance if you're listening to this broadcast
[03:56:11.360 --> 03:56:13.360]  if you're watching it
[03:56:13.360 --> 03:56:15.360]  you are the key to saving the world
[03:56:15.360 --> 03:56:17.360]  to saving the planet you are such
[03:56:17.360 --> 03:56:19.360]  an important role
[03:56:19.360 --> 03:56:21.360]  in history I don't know if people hear
[03:56:21.360 --> 03:56:23.360]  that enough I mean Alex always
[03:56:23.360 --> 03:56:25.360]  says it but maybe people
[03:56:25.360 --> 03:56:27.360]  maybe people take it for granted
[03:56:27.360 --> 03:56:29.360]  you are the heroes of
[03:56:29.360 --> 03:56:31.360]  our age the ones
[03:56:31.360 --> 03:56:33.360]  who are aware who are not afraid
[03:56:33.360 --> 03:56:35.360]  of staring at the truth
[03:56:35.360 --> 03:56:37.360]  that is facing us
[03:56:37.360 --> 03:56:39.360]  that is horrible to face
[03:56:39.360 --> 03:56:41.360]  the fact that there are globalists
[03:56:41.360 --> 03:56:43.360]  out there who want you dead
[03:56:43.360 --> 03:56:45.360]  and that is the reality of the situation
[03:56:45.360 --> 03:56:47.360]  it's not easy
[03:56:47.360 --> 03:56:49.360]  but you are brave enough
[03:56:49.360 --> 03:56:51.360]  and you are courageous enough to say right
[03:56:51.360 --> 03:56:53.360]  I see this threat in front of me I know
[03:56:53.360 --> 03:56:55.360]  I know
[03:56:55.360 --> 03:56:57.360]  that there are people that want me dead
[03:56:57.360 --> 03:56:59.360]  and I'm going to do what I can to warn my neighbour
[03:56:59.360 --> 03:57:01.360]  that doesn't know that there are murderers
[03:57:01.360 --> 03:57:03.360]  after them and their children
[03:57:03.360 --> 03:57:05.360]  you are heroes
