[00:00.000 --> 00:11.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:11.880 --> 00:19.440]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:19.440 --> 00:31.080]  Alex Jones it is Monday at the eighth day of March 2010 we're gonna be live
[00:31.080 --> 00:35.440]  here for the next four hours and believe me this is a transmission you do
[00:35.440 --> 00:45.080]  not want to miss I am really starting to get spooked by what's going on I just
[00:45.080 --> 00:50.760]  had the Southern Private Law Center call me they're doing some cover story on
[00:50.760 --> 00:55.560]  yours truly for their intelligence report that they mail out to millions of
[00:55.560 --> 01:02.360]  people's homes my parents for some reason get it in their mailbox anybody
[01:02.360 --> 01:07.040]  who's middle-class I guess gets one and they tell you who's dangerous and who's
[01:07.040 --> 01:13.040]  bad they set the parameters of reality if they say the moon is made of cheese or
[01:13.040 --> 01:22.640]  Iraq has WMDs it must be true and of course the Southern Private Law Center
[01:22.640 --> 01:28.840]  has been saying that the tea parties in 9-11 Truth are gonna do something violent
[01:28.840 --> 01:33.520]  when no one had done anything violent and Chris Matthews and Glenn Beck were
[01:33.520 --> 01:37.440]  parroting what they had to say the last few months and then right on time you
[01:37.440 --> 01:44.760]  have the Pentagon shooting you have Joe Stack and in the middle of it yours
[01:44.760 --> 01:54.720]  truly is continually being demonized very very creepy and I got to tell you
[01:54.720 --> 02:07.520]  I've had a chill running up and down my spine as of late not just for myself
[02:07.520 --> 02:14.040]  personally but for this whole country and this whole planet there is no doubt
[02:14.040 --> 02:19.440]  that the establishment is getting ready to really shake the planet up and an
[02:19.440 --> 02:31.440]  attempt to bring in their globalist agenda so I want to break down the
[02:31.440 --> 02:38.200]  Pentagon shooting Joe Stack where this is going the ADL the Southern Parvy Law
[02:38.200 --> 02:41.760]  Center and the mainstream media don't start demonizing a group and saying
[02:41.760 --> 02:48.440]  they're violent and gonna carry out violence until the Pentagon and the
[02:48.440 --> 02:53.440]  Justice Department and private corporate black ops are getting ready to stage
[02:53.440 --> 03:01.200]  chair and the Joe Stack situation the Pentagon both coincide with pre
[03:01.200 --> 03:07.040]  conditioning and then there's all the dovetail signs all the earmarks of a
[03:07.040 --> 03:12.600]  staged event and these are only preparatory to get it on people's
[03:12.600 --> 03:16.960]  psychological radar that oh these are bad groups the birthers the tea parties
[03:16.960 --> 03:24.040]  the truthers they're going to get you so that these groups can be demonized when
[03:24.040 --> 03:27.280]  these are the only groups exposing the banking takeover and what the new world
[03:27.280 --> 03:32.600]  orders doing and these are groups that are exploding and size and popularity the
[03:32.600 --> 03:42.520]  demonization is now here and I have been singled out as the chief demon I am now
[03:42.520 --> 03:49.080]  the chief devil according to these people and they've got their co-intel
[03:49.080 --> 03:54.200]  pro at the low-level opening up simultaneously all revealing themselves
[03:54.200 --> 04:01.520]  as operatives opening up on this talk show host and it has two effects it
[04:01.520 --> 04:07.680]  makes this radio show and everything we do that much bigger but that is only
[04:07.680 --> 04:14.080]  done in the final process to build us up to then destroy us and I don't know
[04:14.080 --> 04:20.480]  what form that will take but I have a good idea they've got to be careful
[04:20.480 --> 04:25.840]  though they tried to destroy Ron Paul in 2008 and only made him bigger he
[04:25.840 --> 04:31.160]  survived it because a lot of us stuck beside him when the media ran its
[04:31.160 --> 04:39.440]  disinfo pieces against him but this is definitely a time to girt ourselves
[04:39.440 --> 04:43.640]  because things are just now starting to heat up and then there's so much other
[04:43.640 --> 04:48.960]  news Max Kaiser is joining us coming up in two hours very important broadcast

[05:06.760 --> 05:10.800]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:10.800 --> 05:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's

[05:18.720 --> 05:23.280]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.280 --> 05:27.920]  dangerously overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding
[05:27.920 --> 05:31.680]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids

[06:12.080 --> 06:15.440]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[06:15.440 --> 06:20.240]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[06:20.240 --> 06:25.360]  shards I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[06:25.360 --> 06:29.920]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[06:29.920 --> 06:34.600]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[08:00.640 --> 08:05.200]  i am calling on every honest and vigilant muslim
[08:05.200 --> 08:10.640]  in the countries of the zionist crusader alliance in general
[08:10.640 --> 08:15.040]  and america britain and israel in particular
[08:15.040 --> 08:20.800]  to prepare to play his dual role in responding to and repelling
[08:20.800 --> 08:25.680]  the aggression of the enemies of islam in a new web video the american born
[08:25.680 --> 08:29.360]  spokesman for al-qaeda calls on muslim serving the u.s military
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.360]  to emulate the actions of major nadal hassan the mujahid brother
[08:33.360 --> 08:41.920]  nadal hassan is a pioneer a trailblazer and a role model who has opened a door
[08:41.920 --> 08:46.320]  lit a path and showing the way forward for every muslim
[08:46.320 --> 08:50.720]  who finds himself among the unbelievers the sun is charged with killing 13
[08:50.720 --> 08:53.600]  people at fort hood in november i believe
[08:53.600 --> 08:58.160]  that defiant brother nadal is the ideal role model
[08:58.160 --> 09:05.040]  for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate
[09:05.040 --> 09:08.800]  regimes just hours after this video was released pakistani
[09:08.800 --> 09:12.560]  intelligence officials announced that adam gadan also known as azam al-amr
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.280]  ki had been arrested in recent days in the video gadan goes on to say
[09:17.280 --> 09:19.920]  fighters should target mass transportation systems
[09:19.920 --> 09:23.200]  and also wreak havoc by killing or capturing people in government
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.720]  industry and the media you shouldn't make the mistake of thinking
[09:28.720 --> 09:36.160]  that military bases are the only high value targets in america and the west
[09:36.160 --> 09:44.080]  on the contrary there are countless other strategic places institutions
[09:44.080 --> 09:50.080]  and installations which by striking the muslim can do major damage
[09:50.080 --> 09:54.160]  to the crusader west gadan also recommended finding ways to shake
[09:54.160 --> 10:01.200]  consumer confidence and stifle spending madfrey the associated press
[10:01.200 --> 10:06.000]  that was the disinfo piece by the associated press yesterday that has
[10:06.000 --> 10:13.760]  almost zero credibility on military and terrorism news
[10:13.760 --> 10:18.240]  the ap every few weeks runs a headline ben laden
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.520]  puts out new audio tape or ben laden's puts out a letter on a website and
[10:23.520 --> 10:26.160]  then at the bottom of the article it always says
[10:26.160 --> 10:32.400]  we cannot confirm this new audio tape or videotape or text is ben laden
[10:32.400 --> 10:37.760]  and then months later it comes out it's not he's been dead since 2001
[10:37.760 --> 10:45.440]  u.s intelligence has even admitted that kidney failure
[10:45.440 --> 10:50.000]  and yesterday they announced they had adam gadan two days after his new
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.320]  video praising attacks on military bases and
[10:56.320 --> 11:00.960]  other targets to coincide of course with the
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.800]  pentagon shooting to psychologically create the idea
[11:04.800 --> 11:12.160]  that 911 truthers work with al-ciyeda and by last night they had to admit cbs
[11:12.160 --> 11:21.280]  news associated press you name it oh adam gadan wasn't captured
[11:21.280 --> 11:25.840]  just like a few weeks ago they had the big offensive going on in
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.240]  afghanistan against taliban held air hitting the streets globally
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.240]  hundreds of billions in mc hitting the streets globally
[11:34.240 --> 11:43.920]  hundreds of billions and
[11:43.920 --> 11:49.120]  hitting the streets globally hundreds of billions and liquid secret cash
[11:49.120 --> 11:54.560]  for our rulers they announced they'd captured number two in
[11:54.560 --> 11:57.920]  taliban week later it came out it wasn't true
[11:57.920 --> 12:02.080]  they just announced oh we captured number two oh we captured number three
[12:02.080 --> 12:09.280]  and of course it's all over the news that adam gadan
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.120]  videos and other al-qaeda videos have been uploaded by u.s government
[12:13.120 --> 12:16.400]  intelligence fronts in the same video layer
[12:16.400 --> 12:20.960]  as the u.s intelligence fronts video bugs
[12:20.960 --> 12:24.160]  the al-qaeda video is loaded in by the same cg
[12:24.160 --> 12:28.080]  in the same video layer they're so lazy they don't even make
[12:28.080 --> 12:35.120]  one fake video with gadan up there grandson of adl founding board member
[12:35.120 --> 12:39.760]  arrested for beating up muslims outside mosque in california
[12:39.760 --> 12:43.760]  hated muslims so much and they came to him and said we got a way for you
[12:43.760 --> 12:47.920]  to really you want to beat these people young man
[12:47.920 --> 12:53.440]  you go and pose as one of them and then later when we're done with you after a
[12:53.440 --> 12:56.560]  decade of you doing this we'll stage your death and give you a
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.320]  face job and of course it's been declassified black ops does
[13:00.320 --> 13:03.440]  that all over the world
[13:03.840 --> 13:08.800]  and so the public's all saying oh adam gadan was captured alix guess he isn't a
[13:08.800 --> 13:12.800]  fake oh really and i said yesterday on air before i
[13:12.800 --> 13:17.360]  learned that simultaneously by my last hour it was then announced okay we
[13:17.360 --> 13:21.200]  didn't capture him it wasn't true but they even made that a footnote
[13:21.200 --> 13:26.480]  they still kept running headlines gadan captured but not the gadan we thought
[13:26.480 --> 13:33.200]  they would bury their attraction in other articles
[13:36.160 --> 13:42.080]  this is how stupid they think we are this is how stupid they think you are
[13:42.080 --> 13:46.480]  they think he will buy anything they put out it's like they claim they killed
[13:46.480 --> 13:51.680]  chemical ali four separate times
[13:51.680 --> 13:56.880]  then they executed him what last year they killed him four times
[13:56.880 --> 13:59.360]  they killed saddam's sons three or four times
[13:59.360 --> 14:03.520]  they killed different al-qaeda leaders in some cases 14 times
[14:03.520 --> 14:06.800]  and would never retract the last time they killed him just announced every
[14:06.800 --> 14:10.160]  few months they killed him again
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.480]  now you'd think that they wouldn't be so lazy and would pick other supposed
[14:14.480 --> 14:18.320]  leaders they killed and and make that up but they're not lazy
[14:18.320 --> 14:22.160]  they're setting the precedent to lie to you in the open
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.920]  at a cartoonish absurdist level to where the media just psychologically gets
[14:27.920 --> 14:31.520]  accustomed to accepting mass lies and never questioning
[14:31.520 --> 14:34.560]  they're setting the precedent
[14:36.880 --> 14:41.840]  now the whole world is hurtling towards total financial collapse a new order is
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.760]  being formed on the ashes of the globalist last system
[14:45.760 --> 14:49.440]  the head of the imf today
[14:49.920 --> 14:56.400]  is announcing that all western nations will pay taxes
[14:56.400 --> 15:00.000]  directly to the imf and world bank to quote save the earth
[15:00.000 --> 15:03.520]  and that they don't even need any nations to ratify it
[15:03.520 --> 15:08.240]  that the g20 leaders the private banking heads that run our governments
[15:08.240 --> 15:14.880]  have already agreed at their meeting four weeks ago in australia
[15:14.880 --> 15:17.920]  they don't need a congress they don't need a parliament they do
[15:17.920 --> 15:21.760]  whatever they want whenever they want
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.680]  they have moved most of our industry over to china they are now creating a new
[15:25.680 --> 15:29.840]  cold war between the us and china it is all staged
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.280]  they will use the threat of china as a pretext to shut down freedom on the
[15:33.280 --> 15:37.920]  web that is being announced today
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.240]  and now all the west has got to do the people that control the west
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.880]  is shut down any domestic dissent supposedly for the people
[15:46.880 --> 15:51.440]  by the people we supposedly run our countries our constitution
[15:51.440 --> 15:54.560]  is supposedly the law of the land but no anyone that talks about the
[15:54.560 --> 15:57.040]  constitution bill of rights anyone that questions
[15:57.040 --> 16:00.640]  staged terror anyone that questions obama's birth certificate and all of
[16:00.640 --> 16:02.960]  his deception and his records all being sealed and
[16:02.960 --> 16:07.840]  his real name real name being barry satara and anyone that wants a pro
[16:07.840 --> 16:11.760]  second amendment system you are all internally the number one
[16:11.760 --> 16:17.120]  enemy of the so-called government that sits atop our country sucking it dry
[16:17.120 --> 16:20.640]  all the internal reports all the internal training
[16:20.640 --> 16:24.720]  is for you the gun owner the american
[16:24.720 --> 16:29.360]  and now they're preparing the white al qaeda story they've been
[16:29.360 --> 16:32.800]  putting it out for five years quietly setting up their story
[16:32.800 --> 16:38.160]  on bbc and fox and cnn and having glenn beck who we can trust put it out
[16:38.160 --> 16:43.680]  oh he's a good guy we can trust him he says we need new taxes
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.280]  he says we need the patriot act he says he is worried about domestic
[16:47.280 --> 16:50.640]  constitutional terrorist
[16:51.680 --> 16:56.480]  and so the talking point is now being put out there at an exponential rate
[16:56.480 --> 17:00.960]  adl reports southern property lawson reports every day
[17:00.960 --> 17:04.640]  mainstream media reports the enemy within the enemy within
[17:04.640 --> 17:08.240]  the enemy within the citizens are going to attack their terrorists now
[17:08.240 --> 17:11.440]  you bet we're using the patriot act against citizens and even non-terror
[17:11.440 --> 17:14.960]  related oh we've got to put mobile homeland security
[17:14.960 --> 17:19.200]  tsa checkpoints all over america that was announced over the weekend
[17:19.200 --> 17:22.880]  we're going to randomly put citizens through it and set you down in brain

[17:25.760 --> 17:30.240]  when we go live at prisonplanet.tv oh we're going to have mobile centers that

[25:55.680 --> 25:59.040]  the church is being federalized the clergy response teams
[25:59.040 --> 26:03.920]  you couldn't write a curt vonnegut novel about a future police state
[26:03.920 --> 26:07.600]  and have it more satirically over the top
[26:07.600 --> 26:10.400]  this is more scientific than brave new world
[26:10.400 --> 26:17.120]  more brutal than 1984 they've built the control grid
[26:17.120 --> 26:20.880]  in parallel to our republic and now they're dissolving the pillars of the
[26:20.880 --> 26:26.400]  republic and absorbing us this isn't a game or a
[26:26.400 --> 26:31.280]  joke this radio show ladies and gentlemen this is reality

[26:34.800 --> 26:37.360]  of this thing
[26:40.160 --> 26:44.480]  i don't even know what to do anymore it's just so diabolical
[26:44.480 --> 26:47.760]  and we've allowed this level of evil to be set up
[26:47.760 --> 26:51.680]  that we've allowed the media to tell us torture is good torture of people's
[26:51.680 --> 26:56.320]  children in front of them secret arrest and end of habeas corpus
[26:56.320 --> 27:02.640]  and now the media is saying use all of these systems against the american
[27:02.640 --> 27:05.840]  people and that's what the patriot act says it was designed for
[27:05.840 --> 27:10.720]  in section 802 look at this article the centers to be
[27:10.720 --> 27:14.640]  detained as enemy belligerents inside the us
[27:14.640 --> 27:18.000]  mccain and Lieberman have introduced a bill to do it and that's not just
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.400]  prisonplanet.com and paul watson that breaks this down
[27:22.400 --> 27:29.120]  here's the atlantic atlantic monthly a detention bill you ought to read more
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.760]  carefully
[27:32.640 --> 27:36.240]  us citizens suspected of terror activity without any evidence
[27:36.240 --> 27:38.960]  could be detained by the military on us soil
[27:38.960 --> 27:45.760]  that's the atlantic magazine doesn't get more prestigious than that
[27:45.760 --> 27:50.080]  warning you i mean it's i can't believe this is going this far
[27:50.080 --> 27:53.280]  i mean they're really getting ready to shut down the web
[27:53.280 --> 27:56.080]  they're really getting ready to start arresting people
[27:56.080 --> 27:59.840]  they're really going to try it ladies and gentlemen and they want us to get
[27:59.840 --> 28:02.960]  violent because when anybody fights back being drug
[28:02.960 --> 28:06.160]  off to the fema camp you're going to be called a terrorist
[28:06.160 --> 28:10.160]  do you have any idea police and military what's going to happen to you
[28:10.160 --> 28:14.080]  when one percent of the gun owners resist
[28:14.080 --> 28:18.640]  that's a million and a half combatants and once this thing goes hot people
[28:18.640 --> 28:21.440]  aren't going to wait in their houses for you fools
[28:21.440 --> 28:25.280]  and all your cameras and rfid and tracker crap isn't going to help you do
[28:25.280 --> 28:28.640]  understand that and it's not going to help us the american
[28:28.640 --> 28:32.080]  people either this doesn't have to happen fools
[28:32.080 --> 28:35.680]  that are you know there's a reason in the last 20 years they only hire police
[28:35.680 --> 28:38.800]  officers with under 100 iq every time i mentioned that i get
[28:38.800 --> 28:43.840]  emails saying it didn't true just google it's mainstream news every major city
[28:43.840 --> 28:47.360]  they don't like hiring cops that are smart because they know the cops will see
[28:47.360 --> 28:51.840]  through the programming and lies and i'm not saying all cops are dumb
[28:51.840 --> 28:55.040]  the point is is that they don't want to hire smart people
[28:55.040 --> 28:58.800]  look at the tsa i'm not saying you're all dumb but a lot of your
[28:58.800 --> 29:02.640]  as dumb as a box of rocks not all of you but quite a few and they give you this
[29:02.640 --> 29:07.680]  unholy unconstitutional power and they teach you that
[29:07.680 --> 29:11.600]  thugism and abuse is a good thing
[29:12.160 --> 29:17.040]  look we have a criminal group that's hijacked our country
[29:17.040 --> 29:20.160]  and a lot of people are waking up and taking action so the government's going
[29:20.160 --> 29:22.880]  to stage a bunch of terror attacks and shootings and bombings and everything
[29:22.880 --> 29:25.920]  else and blaming on every group criticizing them
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.320]  just get ready for it it's already started it's the only card they can play
[29:30.320 --> 29:34.560]  as i've said the last few months and look it's happening
[29:34.560 --> 29:38.800]  but it is really creepy that in every one of these reports

[35:32.160 --> 35:36.880]  appropriate so unlimited power in the last clause
[35:36.880 --> 35:40.960]  just like section 802 of the us a patriot act says all activities that
[35:40.960 --> 35:44.400]  endanger human life that are a violation of any federal or state law are
[35:44.400 --> 35:49.680]  applicable under the patriot act that strips the entire bill of rights
[35:52.480 --> 35:55.360]  i'm going to break this down fully in the next hour
[35:55.360 --> 35:58.880]  because it ties in with what the tsa is announcing they're going to do and are
[35:58.880 --> 36:02.080]  starting to do nationwide
[36:02.080 --> 36:14.320]  but when i sent rob do jason bermas and jason douglas
[36:15.120 --> 36:21.600]  up to g20 the pentagon put out a report that they were at a
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.400]  international guard base massing thousands of troops
[36:26.400 --> 36:30.320]  we called the base and said and other reporters had been there and we said we
[36:30.320 --> 36:32.880]  like to come over and interview and they said just come to the gate
[36:32.880 --> 36:38.560]  so on video this is in the upcoming police state four rise of femum
[36:38.560 --> 36:42.880]  they pull up they give them their name information
[36:42.880 --> 36:46.480]  and they make them wait 20 minutes and they say uh yeah pull over there we're
[36:46.480 --> 36:49.520]  going to come talk to you they come over they talk to them and they say come

[37:05.680 --> 37:08.560]  it back tomorrow then and the guy said look i'm
[37:08.560 --> 37:11.520]  such and such with the police department and i got his name i called him
[37:11.520 --> 37:16.160]  myself later from here in austin and we wrote an article about it
[37:16.160 --> 37:20.400]  at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and uh
[37:20.400 --> 37:23.680]  he said you were suspected of being terrorist you were plotting to attack
[37:23.680 --> 37:27.120]  the base you were sneaking around and you ran
[37:27.120 --> 37:30.000]  and he gave them the names of the military officers they talked to
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.640]  we have the video they're totally polite see we're not human to the military
[37:34.640 --> 37:40.560]  and the police now we're inhuman scum you don't pull up politely and say we'd
[37:40.560 --> 37:44.560]  like to interview your public spokesperson we're making a film
[37:44.560 --> 37:47.040]  about this
[37:48.000 --> 37:52.080]  we're not human we don't even exist just out of hand lie about us
[37:52.080 --> 37:55.600]  say we were planning to blow the base up
[37:55.600 --> 37:59.040]  and then he laughed at
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.480]  jason douglas and said well you're gonna be on the list for the rest of your
[38:02.480 --> 38:05.920]  life because see jason douglas isn't a human because
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.440]  these people are psychopaths
[38:10.880 --> 38:14.560]  lying about us means nothing and there's that talking point adl southern
[38:14.560 --> 38:17.920]  probably law center mainstream media going on really for the last year
[38:17.920 --> 38:21.840]  out of the blue that 911 truth alternative media
[38:21.840 --> 38:26.160]  burthers in the fetters we got army documents on this are violent
[38:26.160 --> 38:30.960]  terrorist and then magically somebody goes to the
[38:30.960 --> 38:36.560]  military base the pentagon and supposedly shoots two people
[38:36.560 --> 38:39.920]  and magically somebody who's a tea party person the media claim
[38:39.920 --> 38:45.680]  turned out it wasn't true flies a plane into the irs building
[38:46.160 --> 38:50.160]  and they've got the legislation which i don't know why they need this i guess
[38:50.160 --> 38:52.560]  they just want to be public i mean the patriot acts already got these
[38:52.560 --> 38:57.760]  provisions the the enemy combatant act states that they just
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.840]  strip you extra judicially of your citizenship and can arrest you in
[39:01.840 --> 39:08.400]  these fashions this is the complete end of our republic
[39:08.400 --> 39:12.160]  and once these protections are gone it's going to be used on everyone
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.400]  it always is throughout history
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.080]  but they think you're such a drug-addled
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.080]  decadent dumb-down entertainment obsessed
[39:24.080 --> 39:30.080]  tv head culture that you're just going to accept it and they're moving
[39:30.080 --> 39:33.760]  with scientific tyranny using your tax money
[39:33.760 --> 39:37.120]  and they stayed in these reports they're going to take your farms and ranches
[39:37.120 --> 39:40.160]  they're going to take your businesses they're going to draft your children
[39:40.160 --> 39:43.600]  into domestic spy cores and domestic environment cores
[39:43.600 --> 39:46.640]  and it's all being announced that they're going to take over the boy scouts and
[39:46.640 --> 39:49.760]  they're now doing it and train them to quote take on gun owners and veterans
[39:49.760 --> 39:52.560]  new york times
[39:53.040 --> 40:00.320]  they're just doing it and the republican party is cheerleading all of it
[40:00.320 --> 40:04.400]  and claiming obama's a communist and a and a muslim
[40:04.400 --> 40:09.200]  and and and and he's not hard enough on terror when he is dwarfing everything
[40:09.200 --> 40:12.880]  bush did again giving obama left cover so the left
[40:12.880 --> 40:16.720]  in this country doesn't realize what's happening
[40:18.320 --> 40:26.240]  do you feel safe having this set up look at what you are allowing to be built
[40:26.240 --> 40:29.680]  and a lot of you know tyranny's being set up so you're scared you're going to
[40:29.680 --> 40:34.400]  try to just play it safe but playing it safe against tyranny is not playing it
[40:34.400 --> 40:37.760]  safe it's ensuring it happens and many of you
[40:37.760 --> 40:42.000]  that are laughing now or are scared and don't get involved if this ends up
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.200]  succeeding you're going to have yourself to blame for it as much as the new world
[40:45.200 --> 40:48.080]  order you understand that
[40:49.440 --> 40:53.520]  you are having your water poisoned you are having your food poisoned on record
[40:53.520 --> 40:57.760]  the gmo that hundreds of chemicals they put in the water
[40:57.760 --> 41:00.720]  the vaccines
[41:01.120 --> 41:07.520]  they're coming after me but they're also coming after all of you
[41:07.520 --> 41:13.520]  we know how these systems end we know the goal is to be authoritarian and
[41:13.520 --> 41:16.000]  oppressive
[41:16.400 --> 41:20.000]  we know they're federalizing all local police putting in threat fusion spy
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.120]  centers that violate the entire bill of rights on its face
[41:23.120 --> 41:28.000]  we know the government brings in the majority of the narcotics on record
[41:28.000 --> 41:31.520]  we know they're planning to launch new wars there is no
[41:31.520 --> 41:36.320]  end to what this ruling class is doing they are predators
[41:36.320 --> 41:41.520]  parasitically feeding on everything good funding radical muslim terror groups
[41:41.520 --> 41:44.160]  at every front
[41:52.560 --> 41:56.960]  so think about it ladies and gentlemen think about the future think about
[41:56.960 --> 42:00.160]  what you're allowing to happen
[42:00.160 --> 42:06.720]  think about how they sell you on oh we're just
[42:06.720 --> 42:09.920]  going to torture foreigners we're just going to secretly arrest foreigners and
[42:09.920 --> 42:14.560]  then you find out they're using the patriot act on gun shows
[42:14.560 --> 42:21.360]  and homeless and veterans and supposed family violence
[42:21.360 --> 42:25.200]  and for people supposedly who hadn't paid their income tax oh you don't get
[42:25.200 --> 42:28.080]  your due process you don't get your equal protection under the law

[42:46.400 --> 42:49.840]  torturing children in front of their parents sexually
[42:49.840 --> 42:59.200]  raping them well that's what america's got to do to get tough on al-qaeda
[42:59.200 --> 43:02.720]  torturing people to death secret black sites all
[43:02.720 --> 43:07.120]  over the world snatching and grabbing whoever they want whenever they want
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.120]  and now they're saying we're going to do it america to citizens
[43:11.120 --> 43:15.040]  they've come out in the open so the fbi and the atf and the cops and
[43:15.040 --> 43:19.520]  the private contractors think it's okay men we're getting tough on the terrorists
[43:19.520 --> 43:22.720]  in america these truthers and barthers and
[43:22.720 --> 43:25.680]  in the fetters have been linked to this event in austin
[43:25.680 --> 43:28.880]  and the event at the pentagon but that's classified the public can't be told
[43:28.880 --> 43:32.160]  this these are the high-valued targets you're
[43:32.160 --> 43:34.880]  going to break into their house and plant stuff on them
[43:34.880 --> 43:40.240]  or you're going to snatch and grab them this guy goes home at work at this time
[43:40.240 --> 43:45.120]  we've got some local pd working with us
[43:45.120 --> 43:50.720]  member of the cia operative carnaby and houston
[43:50.720 --> 43:56.160]  what a year and a half ago high-level cia the cops pull him over get him out of
[43:56.160 --> 44:00.000]  his car and execute him right there on the street
[44:02.880 --> 44:06.800]  they got cia squads in every department above
[44:06.800 --> 44:13.600]  50 000 people that's a dead reckoning in key drug routes the cia runs small
[44:13.600 --> 44:16.480]  police departments
[44:17.760 --> 44:21.680]  and hey if the cops are on the take from the government
[44:21.680 --> 44:26.400]  you see these local judges and cops living in million-dollar houses
[44:26.400 --> 44:28.960]  then they start getting more corrupt they start raping women they start
[44:28.960 --> 44:31.680]  parking outside the topless bars pulling them over making them do sexual
[44:31.680 --> 44:34.320]  favors they start beating up their neighbors killing
[44:34.320 --> 44:37.040]  people they start just pulling cars over robbing
[44:37.040 --> 44:42.240]  people's wallets because hey they're allowed to commit crime
[44:42.240 --> 44:44.720]  they know stuff about the government and the government
[44:44.720 --> 44:48.000]  has been recruiting for decades more and more criminals into their midst and
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.280]  kicking the good men and women out until now they think they've got enough
[44:51.280 --> 44:54.320]  criminals in major police departments and in the state
[44:54.320 --> 44:58.160]  houses and in the federal agencies that they are going for absolute broke
[44:58.160 --> 45:01.520]  and the government's put out reports a month ago saying john you and
[45:01.520 --> 45:04.800]  albert can solace could write memos ordering the military to torture
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.360]  children and bury people alive and that the
[45:09.360 --> 45:12.800]  president is basically a god and they're telling the justice department
[45:12.800 --> 45:16.480]  the fbi that right now they're saying boys you do whatever you want as long as
[45:16.480 --> 45:21.360]  we order it it's open season on the american people
[45:21.360 --> 45:26.000]  tear them limb from limb drive them into submission
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.280]  the banks are going to take good care of us we just got to hold these people
[45:29.280 --> 45:32.160]  down while we rob them
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.280]  you're all going to get a piece of it they're farms they're ranches they're
[45:39.280 --> 45:42.320]  businesses they're women
[45:43.200 --> 45:47.360]  and you see all the new cops and fbi people they got shaved heads go teased
[45:47.360 --> 45:54.320]  devil tats they look like hardcore ex-con enforcers
[45:56.640 --> 45:59.520]  and they do what they want when they want and i want you to know something
[45:59.520 --> 46:03.280]  folks they're not going to give you any quarter
[46:03.280 --> 46:07.360]  they're not going to back off one bit they decided to go for a broke they've
[46:07.360 --> 46:12.160]  committed so many crimes they've tortured children with battery acid
[46:12.160 --> 46:15.040]  sexually that's all i'm going to say it's in the army report msnbc if you
[46:15.040 --> 46:17.760]  want to read it and our government has said
[46:17.760 --> 46:23.200]  that's good that's wholesome what comes next how much further do we sink
[46:23.200 --> 46:28.560]  where do we go from there a lot further down
[46:31.360 --> 46:34.800]  hell is being released
[46:34.800 --> 46:40.880]  and the movies and the culture the video games are all about rape and
[46:40.880 --> 46:45.200]  torture and murder and death and killing
[46:45.200 --> 46:48.480]  you know the roman republic didn't have gladiators when it was first founded
[46:48.480 --> 46:52.800]  and then it was only convicted murderers that had to fight and then it
[46:52.800 --> 46:57.840]  they started throwing people in for not paying their taxes or for no reason
[46:57.840 --> 47:02.160]  and the roman historians wrote it was meant to dumb down the people and sear
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.360]  their conscience so they would accept brutality and see it as a form of
[47:05.360 --> 47:08.320]  entertainment so that they wouldn't stand up for each other when they were
[47:08.320 --> 47:12.560]  oppressed and scientific torture porn as the
[47:12.560 --> 47:15.600]  media calls it showing unbelievable rape and
[47:15.600 --> 47:20.800]  torture in in movies showing it as if it's good
[47:20.800 --> 47:24.320]  people go and watch that and are totally desensitized
[47:24.320 --> 47:28.960]  it's now manly to be into torture and death and killing
[47:28.960 --> 47:35.840]  we have been turned into a nation of demons
[47:35.840 --> 47:38.960]  and when i say fat i mean spiritually fat decadence
[47:38.960 --> 47:47.040]  lovingly hateful spiteful falsely sardonic arrogant
[47:48.400 --> 47:52.880]  exponential envy like a disease is spread
[47:52.880 --> 47:59.760]  pulcanized divided against each other lovers of themselves lovers of evil
[48:00.080 --> 48:03.600]  50 million dead babies
[48:05.200 --> 48:09.120]  black people led by their wicked leaders have allowed 52 percent of their
[48:09.120 --> 48:16.240]  people to be murdered by abortion and they love it
[48:17.120 --> 48:20.800]  but some college kids is a joke throw some cotton balls out
[48:20.800 --> 48:24.160]  by the black dormitory
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.560]  and they're being charged with terrorism
[48:28.960 --> 48:32.880]  yeah see that's what the system does it always gives you a false
[48:32.880 --> 48:39.600]  version of justice oh we're gonna kill 52 percent of the black people

[48:42.640 --> 48:45.120]  community but none of that's a problem your black leaders aren't gonna get
[48:45.120 --> 48:48.560]  concerned about that but don't worry when some
[48:48.560 --> 48:52.560]  college kids throw a bag of white cotton balls i guess meaning used to be
[48:52.560 --> 48:58.080]  cotton pickers we're gonna charge them with terrorism

[54:12.400 --> 54:16.400]  welcome to your life a government run by foreign banks robbing
[54:16.400 --> 54:21.440]  everything in front of our eyes
[54:21.440 --> 54:25.040]  they knew all the torture information was going to come out of Abu Ghraib and
[54:25.040 --> 54:28.320]  other camps so they released some of the lighter
[54:28.320 --> 54:33.200]  photos people being bitten by dogs beaten to death
[54:33.200 --> 54:36.800]  having to do sexually humiliating things because this is what the perverts
[54:36.800 --> 54:43.760]  who run our government like and so they sold the world on how great this was
[54:43.760 --> 54:47.600]  and of course the world only hated us that much more and now our government
[54:47.600 --> 54:50.320]  can't criticize china killing political dissidents
[54:50.320 --> 54:55.040]  because our government's gearing up to do it as well
[54:55.040 --> 54:59.520]  and we know how this ends we know where this road
[54:59.520 --> 55:06.240]  leads to death and destruction and damnation
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.680]  we know so for all of you soft people out there
[55:11.680 --> 55:15.760]  who are tuning in for the first time and think this is funny
[55:15.760 --> 55:21.360]  you haven't studied history and you have no idea what you're in store for
[55:22.480 --> 55:27.760]  we're a nation of spoiled brat children
[55:29.680 --> 55:34.640]  and we better repent and you're not going to find god in most these churches
[55:34.640 --> 55:37.600]  you're going to find a bunch of worldly glitter bugs
[55:37.600 --> 55:41.040]  you're going to find god hitting your knees at midnight in the stillness of the
[55:41.040 --> 55:43.600]  night and asking god for forgiveness for not
[55:43.600 --> 55:47.840]  standing up against this evil and not doing more asking god to forgive you
[55:47.840 --> 55:51.440]  for hardening your heart and not recognizing evil in the culture when
[55:51.440 --> 55:55.360]  it's all around you evil isn't cute or funny
[55:55.360 --> 55:59.840]  it's stinking piles of dead bodies it's maggot covered corpses
[55:59.840 --> 56:05.600]  it's pain and humiliation and it's innocence being tortured
[56:05.600 --> 56:14.480]  this disgusting fetish that's pushed to paramilitary police and
[56:14.480 --> 56:21.520]  military everywhere and this this this religion of weakness and cowardice
[56:21.520 --> 56:25.920]  and a public that's trained to just sit there and wait for help
[56:25.920 --> 56:31.040]  help it and come in i thought about friday's show with gerald solente talking
[56:31.040 --> 56:33.760]  about how it was a big earthquake when he was in chili
[56:33.760 --> 56:37.200]  and he got out of the building and nobody else did they just sat there calling
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.760]  the front desk and calling the police begging for help
[56:41.760 --> 56:46.960]  and how he was in a restaurant no one would help this choking man
[56:46.960 --> 56:50.080]  so he finally helped him and then they found out there was a doctor in the
[56:50.080 --> 56:53.920]  house who didn't want to get involved just like when i saw that choking woman
[56:53.920 --> 56:58.160]  no one would help her they were all yelling call 911 call 911
[56:58.160 --> 57:02.960]  they had their whole humanity taken a bunch of tv watching spectators who
[57:02.960 --> 57:06.480]  can't and won't do anything and the establishment knows that
[57:06.480 --> 57:13.200]  so they're going to rob you and hurt you do you understand that fools
[57:15.600 --> 57:21.200]  they are going to smash this society into a trillion pieces
[57:22.400 --> 57:25.680]  because that's the nature of evil that's the nature of government
[57:25.680 --> 57:31.680]  once evil and corruption gets a hold it's then a competition
[57:31.680 --> 57:34.800]  of the wicked of the evil with each other to get into control
[57:34.800 --> 57:39.520]  and within just a few decades you get pure psychopathic
[57:39.520 --> 57:44.960]  sadistic murderers in who just start slaughtering everyone for enjoyment
[57:44.960 --> 57:48.560]  and you got CNN saying mousey tongue's a great guy
[57:48.560 --> 57:56.160]  played that last week twice just bathing washing our brains in pure
[57:56.160 --> 58:04.160]  evil god help us and i can really feel in my spirit and my
[58:04.160 --> 58:08.160]  intellect and my gut and my psyche that we are headed towards
[58:08.160 --> 58:12.640]  a major explosion of this tyranny
[58:15.040 --> 58:18.640]  i intellectually see it but i also spiritually see it
[58:18.640 --> 58:21.600]  you better hear right with god that's all i can tell you you better
[58:21.600 --> 58:27.840]  hit your knees and ask god not for protection
[58:27.840 --> 58:33.040]  we don't deserve that but that we get right with god
[58:33.040 --> 58:37.520]  and that god work with all of us to make us be the leaders in our communities
[58:37.520 --> 58:46.640]  to stand against this evil that is the only way we're going to be redeemed

[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:53.440]  70 years ago during the great depression
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.400]  90% of the population was agrarian lived on the land and was self-sufficient
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:04.800]  10% was urban now 90% or 89% if you want to be exact
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:10.640]  is urban 11% is rural and roughly half of the rural population is self-sufficient
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:13.680]  five and a half percent
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.280]  and there was an increase in crime and a lot of problems during the great

[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.680]  among other businesses few details are known to fox four news but the incident
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:48.720]  happened at 11 a.m at the four forest building
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.480]  at 12222 merit drive off interstate 635
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:57.840]  dalis fire rescue reported at least three people were transported to hospitals

[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.200]  one was being allowed in or out and that lockdown is great so the
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.480]  shooter can kill more people a great little system so everybody
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.520]  can call 911

[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.280]  you don't even call 911 you just go on pass because you're so self-centered
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.800]  and decadent and if the government's torturing children in black op camps
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.800]  worldwide because they like it you better not say anything
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:38.000]  after all you got to get your nails done this afternoon you got to go watch a
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.720]  basketball game at the bar with your buddies and get drunk
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.040]  you got to act cool you got to get a new tattoo

[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.560]  not saying you're bad if you got tattoos you know what i mean
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:59.520]  what do you worship what are your idols you worship god and liberty and freedom
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:02.480]  and your rights do you jealously guard your rights as thomas
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:08.000]  jefferson said you better guard the jewel even if you fight
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.360]  as hard as you can to protect it you'll probably still lose it but if you
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.560]  become a bunch of slack jog lazy punks you will be taken
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.520]  and you will be drug to the center of evil because evil doesn't quit always

[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:37.840]  important times in human history of not the most
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:43.760]  important massive technological development
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.200]  a incredibly wicked elite ruling the planet
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:52.800]  setting up a draconian planetary regime to carry out mass extermination
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.560]  of the majority of the population that is their final public
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:02.800]  stated goal thousands of times in textbooks and government documents
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:07.040]  you think they're selling you on torture and death and war and surveillance
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:10.640]  just so they can be rich and powerful they've already got all the money
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:18.080]  they already print the money these are unbelievably dark people and you know
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:21.920]  they think you're a coward they think i get up here and talk about all this in
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.200]  the way they're happy i'm here they think it scares you and creates a
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.200]  chilling effect i certainly hope that's not the case and i know it scares some
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.480]  and cowards don't matter
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:36.560]  i'm talking to people that are red-blooded and realize that
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:40.800]  you don't cower down to a threat and have it go away
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.560]  i'm speaking to people that recognize what's going on and are going to stand
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.280]  up against it and realize we can beat these people
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:51.360]  because 90 percent of this war is a mind game this is an illegitimate
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.880]  degenerate pack of lying criminals who engage in every form of deception and
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.920]  lies you can imagine
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:03.600]  and they've got to sell their minions their police their military their
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:08.720]  enforcers their bureaucrats that torture and secret arrest is good
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.160]  that's why they're trying to pass new legislation to arrest citizens secretly
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.000]  and torture them for no reason even Atlantic monthly's reporting on this
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.800]  that's coming up at the bottom of the hour with a big news blitz
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.440]  but you know what i'm not angry at cowards who
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.880]  rationalize what's going on and psychologically make excuses and laugh
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.520]  this off or who know it's real and just hide under their
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:40.960]  bed figuratively i'm angry at another group of people
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.240]  not just the evil people that have set this system up and profit from it
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.600]  but from those of you out there that know how evil this system is
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.800]  and you have made the choice to join it you have made the choice to serve it
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:59.040]  you know it's bad and you have decided to join with it
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:04.640]  because you think you're on the winning team
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.400]  you know it's bad you know it's evil you know it's destructive
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.240]  and you say alex because i've been at events and been called and
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.960]  talk to people and they always say it's off record and i've got i wear a
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.840]  journalist hat so when it's off record but you've seen them write books and
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:20.400]  talk about it you've heard them here some of them on this show
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.760]  oh alex the world's always been a bad place you got to make compromises in
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.200]  the general public just as evil as the elite and they tear you apart if they
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.880]  were in control and you just better try to join the elite to protect
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.120]  yourself and you know we've got to do some bad
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.960]  things to protect the good and you know the truth must be guarded by a body
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.800]  guard of lies and the injustice the means and blah blah blah yeah look
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:46.960]  where that type of thinking has taken us
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.400]  all right i said i'm gonna go to your calls
[01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.840]  it just really hit me this weekend it hits me stronger and stronger just how
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.560]  hardcore this is just how real it is and the
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:03.120]  bizarreness of the things that are going on the
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:10.720]  the over the top and the fact that i'm one of the most dominant prolific
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:18.800]  voices in the world against this that is an ego trip that freaks me out
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.920]  i'm freaked out because i know i'm right i know i'm dealing with psychopathic
[01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.920]  control-free killers i know who they are i know
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.960]  they're bad we've proven it it's it's it's ridiculous how much proof
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:34.080]  there is and it's like a bad nightmare i i just
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:37.680]  want to wake up from it i wanted to stop i want people in government to say no
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:40.720]  we're not going to be pure evil
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:46.960]  i mean i wish for a boss hog corruption i wish it was just politicians getting
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:51.200]  bribes and kickbacks and you know on highways
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.120]  i mean that's not good but it's not giant cia
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:59.360]  torture centers which really aren't about even torture it's about
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:02.800]  having hundreds of bases where government personnel and private
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.600]  contractors rape and torture people and children
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:11.440]  to create cadres armies of literal demon force i mean it's just armies of
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.680]  hell are being bred and fitted out i see their huge systems
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.040]  and their and their warfires and their factories turning out
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.360]  not just physical implements of war but the spiritual implements and it's
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.880]  it's unbelievable and they're all around us and carrying out every
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.920]  form of viciousness and horribleness against innocence you can imagine
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.080]  and i feel the pain spiritually intellectually physically but i could
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.840]  feel the pain of the planet of the people on the planet and all the
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.720]  horrible sorrow and everything they're being put through
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.960]  and i know why this has happened evil's always been there but we became
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:54.320]  beguiled by it we we got sold by it to just go to sleep and not be involved
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.520]  and it's not our job and just watch our tv's
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:00.800]  and suck our thumbs and
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:05.440]  we have cancer we have spiritual cancer we have physical
[01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:08.800]  cancer we have economic cancer
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:13.600]  all the curses that are coming upon us all the disease and
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:17.920]  and an infection exploding all the new diseases and all the
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.360]  we are just completely screwed
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.600]  we are dealing with an elite
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.720]  that wouldn't just kill 3 000 people on 9 11 they would do it in such an
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.600]  obvious way multifaceted evil genius to threaten those of us that are
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.840]  intelligent yeah look we kill people out in the open there's nothing you're
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:44.480]  going to stop us and then they're disdain for the
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.720]  general public thinking you're so dumb that you would just accept this and
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:51.440]  buy their lie because they know subconsciously and
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:55.200]  spiritually you know it's a lie and then you accept the lie you buy into
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.240]  the lie and then you'll accept all the other
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.720]  lies
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:12.800]  all right i'm done preaching i said i take your calls
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:17.360]  and i'm not even depressed
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:22.640]  this is not depression you're hearing here this is not even a weight
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.320]  i don't even have a weight on me it's more like
[01:15:27.680 --> 01:15:33.600]  i've got so much depth now of understanding and
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.640]  it's indescribable
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:41.680]  the worst part is i have to be aware of the establishment i have to know
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:45.040]  that they're conscious and know the evil they're committing and they
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.160]  enjoy it and that for them this is all so much fun
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.960]  and then i'm here conscious i have their same perspective that is i i can
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.320]  look at things through their eyes
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:03.680]  and i can look at things through the public's eyes through different
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:07.840]  strata different psychological types and i just can't believe it i i can't
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.680]  believe our species is like this i
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:16.560]  i don't want to run away and hide out of fear
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:22.560]  i just want to not be part of this i just wanted to go away i wanted to
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:25.120]  stop i
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.280]  i don't think most of you realize what's going to happen to all of you
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.400]  what's already being done to you through the water and food
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:44.160]  through the television god almighty
[01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:48.640]  it really hit me the average black person doesn't even know or care that
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:55.120]  52 percent of their people are killed in america and that's a great example of
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:57.600]  how perspective they can be upset over somebody
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.560]  putting a cross in their yard or cotton balls on on their front lawn
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:06.560]  but not over half of their people being murdered
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.240]  that's the same thing we have this big criminal government abusing all of us
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.640]  openly we know what's evil we know it lies constantly but
[01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:22.720]  we see an awakening taking place but people aren't awakening fast enough or
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.960]  deep enough if i could just show people what i
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:30.000]  know if i could just have you look through my mind
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:35.120]  and all the research i've done and i if people could just have discernment it
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:37.520]  would just
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.760]  the world though the truly wicked though they can see that's the
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.760]  thing about it they are not blind at the highest levels of evil they're not
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.200]  deceived they know what they're doing
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:58.240]  and what sick is they can see what i see they can see the alternative for
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.560]  humanity
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.560]  and
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.760]  it's just unspeakable
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.960]  unspeakable
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.320]  it's unspeakable
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:23.440]  it's
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:28.320]  it's beyond anything i could have ever imagined
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.560]  because more than just committing their acts of evil they enjoy the discord the
[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:35.760]  confusion the mental illness the sickness the
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.120]  they love taking god's incredible creation they love taking innocent
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:43.360]  wonderful children full of light and liberty in a future and turning them
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.760]  into these hunchback crone-like demons we see people on the planet
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.920]  i don't even mean their physical look i mean the spirit
[01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:55.760]  how are we going to go to break go to bill carry john mark ben and others and
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.960]  then i'm going to get into all the news
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:05.280]  but i'll say what i said last hour folks you had better hit your knees
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.840]  every night
[01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:12.960]  and you better ask the creator of the universe to open your eyes up
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:17.680]  because if you open your eyes up spiritually
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.000]  to the devil's system
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:28.400]  and if you even begin to see one-tenth of what i've seen you will know why i
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.400]  work so hard why i can't even make myself go home
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:37.280]  though i hate even being here i hate doing this but i can't stop because i've
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.320]  got to fight these people
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:46.800]  then you wouldn't be so lazy and so weak-minded and so willing to be deceived

[01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:15.040]  there was a reason that our forefathers were highest focused
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:19.760]  people wasn't they were squares and weren't cool
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.560]  they had been through history they'd been through war they'd seen other
[01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.640]  civilizations they knew that slovenliness
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.800]  weakness backstabbing pettiness worldliness was destructive and that
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:38.080]  once you let evil in it will bring you down and destroy you
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.400]  because the globalists aren't just going to kill us they're going to continue
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.840]  to poison us slowly with degenerative diseases
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.600]  they're going to continue to murder us at will they're going to continue to
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:51.920]  carry out all forms of evil against our society
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.040]  we need to kick the evil out and it starts at our own homes
[01:24:55.040 --> 01:24:59.120]  and it starts in our own hearts starts on our
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.520]  mind our soul our home our block our neighborhood
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:07.920]  our city our county our state our country our world
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:12.640]  we need to repent that's what we need to do
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.640]  it changes within us and look i'm not perfect i'm 36 years old and i've been
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:20.560]  worldly i've done bad things but i've always had a good heart and love god and
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:24.000]  love goodness and that's where it starts folks if
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.320]  you just ask god to fill you with his spirit
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:32.320]  then if you're truly filled with the spirit you will fight evil
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.120]  if you're not filled with that in your church ladies and gentlemen you're in
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.960]  a wicked new world order church and you already knew that
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.520]  all right i said i'm going to your calls i got a bunch of news to get to and
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:45.520]  kaiser's coming up but bill in canada you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:50.720]  yes hi elix never never believe that your message isn't getting through because
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.360]  even in canada you have a large following here
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.280]  uh... i know but the message isn't getting through how bad it really is bill
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.600]  people think i'm exaggerating i can't describe how evil it is
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.960]  no the right the right ones no the right ones
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.800]  follow everything that you said and that at the
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:13.920]  yeah at the right time and i don't know when that's going to be there they're
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:18.080]  going to stand up to be counted but what i'm calling in about here
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:21.200]  is there is one family that has been
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:27.360]  uh... singled out here and had their home invaded
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:33.920]  by one hundred uh... camouflage and uh...
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.480]  heavily armed swat team members and everything else
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:43.840]  and they they were occupied for four and a half days like that
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:49.920]  and when the children wanted to uh... hit the biffy they had to have
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.400]  a police escort together what was this i mean has it been in the news
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.320]  yes it has but but they've put a spin on it
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:03.120]  and uh... so what happened tell me the case where is it
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:09.120]  the case is uh... in northern alberta close to the british columbia border
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:14.720]  and this family set up there about twenty years ago to be self-sufficient so
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.160]  they wouldn't be depending on the new ages for
[01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:21.120]  uh... for everything right and let me guess they said they were abusing the
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.200]  children i don't know the case what happened
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.240]  well they haven't got to be there they tried that but it wouldn't wash because
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:31.520]  these people are very clean living people
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.200]  and uh... they spin their own wool they make their own cheese
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:40.480]  so why did the devils come what did the devils do tell me the case so i can
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.440]  look it up okay ten years ago
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:49.440]  the uh... the uh... there was some sabotage in the oil field
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:54.880]  and part of the sabotage was done by the police and they admitted it in court
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:59.840]  and yet still put this man in jail for for twenty eight months
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:03.600]  oh sure that's the case where they're claiming natives are blowing stuff up
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.640]  that study well we do we don't know who
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:12.160]  who they're claiming is blowing what up but uh... you know they were the police
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:18.000]  there for four days well they came under the auspices of a search warrant
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:23.360]  which was uh... it appears to be improperly done
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:28.320]  and even if it was you still don't have so they held him captive for four days
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:34.480]  four and a half and uh... anybody that that you know like a three-year-old
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.080]  wanted to uh... to use the biffy well they had no no they do that in public
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.960]  school training they make the children defecate and urinate and
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:44.400]  in buckets at most major public schools you don't believe in listeners
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:48.400]  to search engine it as part of the my mass mind control it's literally a

[01:35:52.200 --> 01:36:01.360]  enemy belligerence this is just we knew it was coming but it's still just
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:08.200]  disgusting to see I'm actually doing it that's let's go to Kerry Kerry in Texas
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.080]  you're on the air yeah like whenever you start walking through this this grid of
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:17.800]  evil that's being established I can't help but think of that Luciferian creed
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:21.480]  of do as I will because that's what holds us all together whether it's
[01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:26.760]  torturing children or genetically modifying food or lies or abortion
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:31.840]  whatever it is it goes back to that people don't like to admit that Luciferian
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.600]  is and that's integral with the whole elitist thinking but it's there you
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:40.960]  can't get around it and to the last caller you mentioned how you get
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:45.480]  frustrated that you can't that people think you're exaggerating when you say
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.280]  things are they're true and I understand some people thought you were
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.520]  exaggerating when you were talking last week about aspartic acid and the
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:37:00.120]  bacteria that secrete it that is used to make aspartame it's absolutely true and
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:04.520]  something that's even more common than aspartame is the citric acid citric
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.680]  acid is produced by asparagus Niger a fungus it's excreted by a fungus that
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:14.600]  submerge in molasses and it's not only a fungus it's like fungus that's been
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:20.120]  radiated with gamma rays to genetically modify it and it's a mutant I mean it
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:24.880]  sounds insane when you say that stuff but anybody could search engine asparagus
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.320]  no we're eating total franken foods and I've read about that as well but we know
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:36.520]  that the the excretia of these genetically engineered bacteria is a toxic
[01:37:36.520 --> 01:37:41.720]  highly addictive poison aspartame and now you can't at any store I've gone to
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:46.720]  can't find any gum that doesn't have it even if it's not sugar-free they know
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:51.200]  it's brain damaging people it's so diabolical I mean they're just poisoning
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.040]  everything and it's genetically engineered bacteria crap and every time I
[01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:00.120]  mentioned that I got emails saying it's ridiculous no it's not I mean people
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:06.040]  just can't believe the magnitude of the elite playing God and doing everything
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.680]  they can to destroy creation meanwhile selling us on a world government to say
[01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:15.840]  if the environment by taxing carbon dioxide that's good for the environment
[01:38:15.840 --> 01:38:19.320]  see they know people are concerned about the earth because there are a lot of
[01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:24.360]  problems and so they create a fake counterfeit of that which is attacking
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:29.080]  something good to have total control I appreciate your call Kerry good to hear
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:36.720]  from you it's just there are thousands of genetically modified organisms that
[01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:46.600]  they've already made that we're eating and I tell people this and they won't
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.160]  even go look it up they'll just think it's not true
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:59.040]  John in Washington you're on the air yeah the going on the reason I was calling
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.760]  I'm buying the good bite here in Spokane Washington and getting out 200 DVDs
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:11.080]  handing them out for free thanks to you not copyright copywriting your DVDs but
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:19.120]  my question day was how close you think we are but you know the FEMA camp scare
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:25.640]  me I'm not sure about you but they're pretty scary John I appreciate your call
[01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:31.680]  what scares me is letting evil win we already live in a big FEMA camp check
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:36.160]  points license plate readers the children are being trained to thumb scan to get
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:39.400]  their lunch or library books they're being trained to be searched without
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.560]  warrants we already have more people in prison than even China and they've got
[01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:49.200]  the legislation to designate all the old military bases as FEMA camps they will
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:52.880]  continue to destroy the economy they will continue to incrementally have
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.080]  people go bankrupt and then they'll advertise the government centers you
[01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:03.400]  know federal and state federally funded state homeless centers that are little
[01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:09.200]  prisons as their FEMA camps and they will pass legislation who arrest people
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:16.160]  for their political views that bill is now introduced I'm gonna cover that we
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:25.240]  finish calls here in a moment let's go ahead and take another call let's go
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.400]  ahead and talk to mark and Marilyn mark you're on the air hey Alex how you
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:34.440]  doing thanks for taking my call we've talked a few times I'm the guy that
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:42.080]  helped with that vfw thing about the inventory that they took with the getting
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:46.920]  back to the military firearms that's right all the old firearms from World
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.720]  War I World War II Korea Vietnam the government's registering them all with a
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:55.400]  vfw of course for confiscation Alex you gotta let me focus here I'm nowhere near
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:59.760]  as good as you are but I have what I believe might be a solution a proactive
[01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:04.160]  peaceful solution that everybody can take part in that the cares take part in
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.280]  it I'd like to share it with you and first thing I'd like to say is a little
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:13.160]  problem with enemy identification we're having you do a really great job of
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:17.920]  exposing all these things I mean what are we exposing now I mean they're doing
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:21.800]  it blame plain sight what we're really doing is just clarifying what they're
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:28.920]  doing and you know exposing what Benedict Beck I mean that guy you can't
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:32.360]  tell me he doesn't have a college education he's so subliminal in his
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:37.080]  methods and folks floating those pictures around the stock market it's
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:42.240]  completely controlled Goldman Sachs is all over that you know we've got to tell
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:46.240]  people who the enemy is because you know if you get punched in the face your
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:51.980]  first reflex is to punch back and whether it's happening for real or it's
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:58.440]  false flag flying into the side of an IRS building is it's not the enemy the
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:03.680]  enemy I believe and you can't name individual people because they'll take
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:08.560]  you off the air but I mean we got to see a far way and things like that when you
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:13.640]  can direct people and then tell them to the bankers who are the bankers
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:17.960]  actually a Bloomberg article what two months ago guys will you pull it
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:23.440]  Bloomberg arming it's a Bloomberg article headline Goldman Sachs arming
[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:29.200]  themselves for people attacking them and that will just turn them into victims
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:32.840]  we need to expose these criminals and not do anything violent to them but the
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:38.840]  reason notice it is the IRS it is the military being attacked and the reason
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:43.760]  we know this is staged for many reasons but they preparatory they they prepared
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.440]  the public that there would be attacks on these very installations then it
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:50.760]  happened so they could demonize their political enemies and I've been saying
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:54.400]  it's the season for that made the prediction it's all come true in
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:58.760]  triplicate which just further concerns me because I know where we're going in
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:05.000]  the next phase and I don't like it and yeah the UN's not being attacked the
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:09.080]  Federal Reserve's not being attacked Goldman Sachs isn't being attacked the
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:13.120]  Council on Foreign Relations isn't being attacked these people are not being
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:17.040]  attacked the real system is not attacking themselves in these staged
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:22.480]  terror attacks they're attacking their own police and military and enforcers
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:31.240]  and parasite suckers at the IRS because they want to get their culture to get
[01:43:31.240 --> 01:43:35.080]  into more warlike mode against us the people and they're internally teaching
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:39.080]  them that we are the enemy go ahead and taser that scum if they talk back go
[01:43:39.080 --> 01:43:41.680]  ahead and beat them up go ahead and torture them because they want to kill
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:48.120]  you it's it's meant to get them and us against them mentality and also have
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:53.160]  people that are angry at the government say yay Joe Stack yay you know the guy
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:44:00.080]  at the Pentagon as some people have done so that the establishment can get the
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.520]  opposition to the New World Order going against their minions instead of
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:07.840]  actually against the elite and then it's also meant for just the general
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.680]  public to scare them away from joining a tea party or a birther or a truth
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:15.800]  movement or an in-the-fed movement because oh my gosh they're connected to
[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:21.880]  violence so we know the psy op we know why they're doing it and but yes the
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:27.360]  fact that you never seal see real globalist targets being hit is another
[01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:31.800]  indicator it's always their low-level minions and so that's the bottom line
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:36.440]  you know I have a small solution I believe would work it's proactive it's
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:41.240]  we'll go ahead and get to it okay what I believe in you and every solution has
[01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:45.640]  risk and it's all going to come down to the few in the end anyway in the few
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:50.000]  are we that's all we've got at the few we can wake a few people up but most
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.800]  people are not going to understand what your solution I gotta move quicker
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.720]  well the solution is they want to take down the banks people don't understand
[01:44:58.720 --> 01:45:03.480]  that it's not going to be a sudden crash it's going to be a frog boiling it in
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.440]  water just like slant they said now you would slant they said you know that
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:12.960]  people need to get involved here's how to get involved and you can't do it in
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:19.040]  their face you have to do it by telling people that it's against the law to tell
[01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:26.360]  anyone to take the banks down you can't cause a run on the banks now see if you
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:29.760]  take your money out of the bank you get to keep your money and you can defeat
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:35.320]  the world world order I'm gonna have to put you on hold and and and and come
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:40.160]  back to you what's the caller's name I'm gonna go back to you in a minute mark
[01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:48.160]  but this is the I need to hear it cut and dry okay I'm not sure what your
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:53.440]  solution is yet but if you're saying identifying that taking the or saying the
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:46:01.720]  banks are going down as illegal the big central banks in October of 2008 so we
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.840]  were gonna have a depression to destroy their competition and to terrorize
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:10.000]  Congress into going against the Bill of Rights Constitution and the will of the
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.160]  people that was and is financial terrorism that's what fall the Republic
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:22.760]  covers and they brought down Iceland Iceland said no we're not paying you the
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:27.200]  money it's not owed Greece is totally controlled by Goldman Sachs so they're
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:35.840]  going along with it total raping now go ahead Mark finish up okay they're
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:40.920]  raping us what I'm saying is I mean we can't reelect any we can't get out of
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:44.200]  people in because we're not community isn't okay so that's the solution we
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:48.840]  can't honest people and what are you saying I'm saying that he who takes the
[01:46:48.840 --> 01:46:53.440]  bank out first keeps the money they're trying to take the banks out they're
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:59.080]  taking our money if we were to do it that we the people this would communicate
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:04.280]  to our lawmakers that we're on top of this we know so what we do is we get
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.840]  together with George Norrie and a few of the others that are willing to take the
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:12.280]  risk they can't go for everybody and we just tell people over and over again
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:18.720]  that it's against the law to withdraw all your money the week of June 19th and if
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:22.960]  everybody gets the message that it's against the law to tell everybody to
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:27.520]  take their money out of the bank on June 19th the week of June 19th guess what
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.400]  people who are listening are going to do and I mean if you understand what I'm
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.680]  saying they're gonna go pull their money and I appreciate your idea but I don't
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:42.160]  agree with it I'm not saying your idea is cockamamie but there aren't silver
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:45.160]  bullets in this
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:52.320]  the general public has a fraction of the money the banks have created thousands
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:58.040]  of times fiat currency and credit what the entire planet owns and has that's
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:48:01.760]  why they need to destroy the economy to make you go bankrupt so they get your
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.600]  property and land it's all it's a Ponzi scheme but when they pop the Ponzi
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.360]  scheme they get all the real material like Greece's islands and their
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:16.880]  infrastructure or Argentina's mines and their roads and their lakes and their
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.360]  fields and their national parks and all of our ports we're already deep into
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:28.840]  receivership I do think getting your money out of the big federal reserve
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:39.080]  banks is good the Goldman Sachs the JP Morgan chases the Bank of Americas it is
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:43.880]  good to support local banks credit unions things like that but see when we
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:47.120]  talk about crash they're not going to probably crash things overnight not let
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:50.640]  you have your money they're just going to devalue the value of your money see
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:57.560]  that the human mind works from a psychological perspective in a primitive
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.680]  way like how do I kill a saber-toot tiger well I get up here on a cliff and
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.680]  I throw boulders at it like you know that you do one thing and it brings them
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:11.760]  down that's why the movies it's all Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone or
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:20.800]  whoever the hero is going out and beating everything overnight with one
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:30.200]  big swoop devastating swoop and that isn't how it works okay you identify
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.120]  that the banks engage in financial terrorism to take over that they bait
[01:49:34.120 --> 01:49:37.480]  and switched and kept the money and won't say where it went that they're
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:42.200]  openly setting up a bank of the world and taking over the planet right now see
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:46.480]  I had incredible news to get to here and I and I wanted to quickly go to calls
[01:49:46.480 --> 01:49:49.960]  but that's why some days I don't take calls not that your calls were bad it
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:54.400]  just burns up time and sometimes takes us in interesting directions sometimes
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:50:05.680]  not I have news here in front of me the centers to be detained as enemy

[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:05.000]  discovery channel they're having at the underworld bomber premiering this
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.640]  Thursday well I don't really pay attention but the underwear bomber was
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:11.520]  admittedly staged by the government they let him on the plane protecting a
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:15.560]  mainstream news to sell the body scanners in the police state because
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.440]  their targets the American people they know we fly they beta test their
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:25.320]  control surveillance grid when people are in the airports now they're gonna
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:30.040]  move it to mobile brain scanning and naked body scanning systems we've got
[01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:34.320]  video from Homeland Security coming up later in the broadcast and how it ties
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:39.680]  into the centers to be detained as enemy belligerence new bill thank you for
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:46.720]  the call John McCain to completely get rid of any bill of rights any habeas
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:52.360]  corpus anything and it says you can be interrogated oh heaven help us Monica
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:56:00.800]  in New York you're on the air hello Alex yes you are unbelievably watching on
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:09.280]  the wall and I say that not as just to affirm you and but God has equipped you
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:16.480]  to be able to do this I'm telling you and we see that and this morning I was
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:20.720]  just unctioned to just I mean it was like really hard to press through to
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:25.360]  pray and you will be lifted up in prayer and and not only that and which you when
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:29.080]  you first started the program how you were it was like it was like birthing
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:35.680]  something I think people in the spirit need to realize that there they have
[01:56:35.680 --> 01:56:41.720]  been created to operate a certain way and there is an evil will trying to force
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:48.320]  us to not resist it it's a spirit and and I mean that's what it is forcing down
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:53.280]  upon us to go along with the system to be evil to be worldly to not have
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:57:00.240]  courage and I feel like today I have passed over another line this has
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.120]  happened to me before in a progression of discernment and awakening and and the
[01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:09.240]  reason I'm waking up and even more and other people are as well is because the
[01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:14.680]  enemy is rising right now and God is trying to lift you up the listeners
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:21.760]  against this enemy and I just realized the position I'm in and I I just say
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:26.640]  why God what why is the world this way why do I understand this and a lot of
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.920]  other people can't if they could just know what I know yeah and we don't need
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.680]  to know like not all people need to know all specific things I really believe in
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.920]  the spiritual you're dealing with a dimension where you're operating and
[01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:45.000]  you know it's an all-knowing through you know what I mean it's like God can
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.240]  download it to you and there is no fear in it when God's there well that's what
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.440]  it's like though I mean I knew they were gonna stage an attack in Austin I knew
[01:57:53.440 --> 01:57:57.160]  they were gonna at stage attacks and blame it on 9-11 truth and I said it'll
[01:57:57.160 --> 01:58:01.200]  happen in the next month and it happened and and then I know pretty much what
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:04.880]  they're gonna do next I'm gonna try to really formulate my thoughts and cover
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:08.960]  it in the last hour it's just it's like watching a train coming you see it
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:12.560]  coming you're saying look there's the train and people don't see it it runs
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:18.320]  them over how can they not see it it's spiritual psychology is what it is you
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:22.960]  have to understand and see a pattern in it in order for you to operate the way
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.440]  you do in the very thing that God allows you to do it and equip you you have to
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:33.520]  see it that way and it's a pattern and it's almost like you could set up a grid
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:38.840]  and see it and point by point pick out absolutely and that's what the globalists
[01:58:38.840 --> 01:58:43.160]  use their computers to do and also their master gives them the same
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:49.440]  discernment America's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a
[01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:57.440]  decade we are the GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:02.720]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history

[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:49.280]  technologies are used on major stock exchanges today I want to get into the
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:55.000]  state of the world economy with him but I also want to talk about the Joe Stack
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:59.320]  attack a lot of evidence that was staged the Pentagon attack we saw
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:03.080]  preconditioning that 9-11 truthers were going to get violent before anyone had
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:06.800]  ever gotten violent and I saw the media putting that out and I said look they're
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:10.680]  about to stage something and now it turns out his parents warned turns out
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:14.240]  he's got government connections with weird government contracts and in
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:19.400]  communications with the Pentagon same thing with Joe Stack but regardless they
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:24.120]  are really demonizing everybody right now the Southern Prairie Law Center is
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:29.280]  attacking me every day they're demonizing the tea parties they're going after
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:33.400]  everybody so we'll talk about that with Max Kaiser as well because the people
[02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:39.960]  are really starting to wake up the banks control both parties the good news is I
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:44.720]  want to cover first Iceland voters reject repayment plan and how that dovetails
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:50.360]  with this AP article IMF suggest how to raise climate change funds pay money
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:56.320]  directly to them so we'll talk about the open expansion of this private banking
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:02:01.360]  world government with Max Kaiser Max Kaiser good to have you here with us
[02:02:01.360 --> 02:02:08.920]  yeah it's good to be back with you so much is going on let's let's talk in
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:13.400]  general terms first about the world economy more and more analysts are
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:17.440]  saying look we got 22% unemployment we're really going to depression things
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:23.320]  are getting worse not better where is this going yeah well as we've talked
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:30.880]  about before it's a global phenomenon I would I call the the global insurrection
[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:35.800]  against banking occupation we're seeing it in Iceland we're seeing it in Greece
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:41.080]  we're saying it in countries all over the world it started in 2007 with the
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:45.160]  beginning of the credit crunch that we first started to understand what was
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.720]  happening with the credit crunch remember over there at Citigroup the CEO
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.120]  Citigroup Chuck Prince said as long as the music keeps going we're gonna keep
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:58.320]  dancing and what he meant by that was as long as the Fed was gonna continue to
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:03.200]  print money in ways that we could borrow and securitize our way into these phony
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.160]  profits we're gonna continue to do so even though our underlying basic
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:12.200]  business model is corrupt well anyway the music stopped and this was the
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:16.920]  beginning of the global credit crunch it was huge in 2008 there was a bit of a
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:22.040]  respite in 2009 because of the stimulus package which was basically nothing
[02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:27.840]  more than a bit of a sugar high and now in 2010 it's the resumption of this
[02:03:27.840 --> 02:03:32.760]  global crunch this credit crunch this deflation this depression and the people
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:36.240]  in various countries around the world are starting to fight back they're
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:40.600]  fighting back in Iceland they're fighting back in Greece so it's not just in
[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:46.640]  the US that people are being disenfranchised by the the the tyranny
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:52.720]  that's gone on on the level of the investment banks and worldwide I've
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:57.760]  seen the news in Iceland in Spain in Greece the media is implying that the
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:04.200]  anti-banking parties the anti-looting parties are terrorist or a radical and
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:08.240]  so look for events to be staged and blamed on the opposition there but I
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:11.960]  don't think that these stage provocations or in some cases the
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:17.200]  establishment allowing nuts to attack the government is gonna make the people
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:21.880]  love the banks I think this isn't gonna work max well it's interesting in
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:28.560]  countries like Greece and Iceland that people understand specifically what the
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:35.360]  problem is and they are pushing back directly against against the bankers
[02:04:35.360 --> 02:04:41.200]  themselves in the US the message is very muted because the mainstream media is
[02:04:41.200 --> 02:04:46.200]  able to get all of the activists to line themselves up into a circular firing
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.800]  line and they all shoot each other exactly we're busy Republicans bashing
[02:04:50.800 --> 02:04:55.240]  Democrats Democrats bashing Republicans Republicans and Democrats bashing
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:05:00.280]  Alex Jones we'll be right back shooting at each other we'll be right back with
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:03.480]  Max Kaiser stay there Max
[02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:09.560]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs

[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:07.560]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:11.880]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:16.080]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:20.120]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:24.000]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.080]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:06:28.080 --> 02:06:32.440]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:36.760]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:40.480]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.680]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:06:44.680 --> 02:06:48.040]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[02:08:08.160 --> 02:08:13.600]  center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's Alex
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:20.760]  Jones and the GCN radio network Max Kaiser of Max Kaiser.com is our guest
[02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:25.360]  for the rest of the hour we're gonna open the phones up for people
[02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:31.760]  specifically with questions for Max Kaiser at the bottom of the hour it's
[02:08:31.760 --> 02:08:37.760]  very simple less than 20 big central banks openly you're setting up world
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.320]  government saying we're gonna pay our carbon taxes to them they go into
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:46.600]  nations set up these derivative systems to get people deeply in fraudulent debt
[02:08:46.600 --> 02:08:51.760]  they want the resources of the nation they pay off the politicians to buy in
[02:08:51.760 --> 02:08:55.600]  to the Ponzi schemes but instead of going to prison like Bernie Madoff or
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:00.840]  Ken lay when they implode the economy they get even more power and they use
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:07.440]  paramilitary military industrial complex systems and television brainwashing to
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:10.960]  play the public off against each other and to suppress and demonize anybody
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:17.680]  else that wakes up but Max the reason I talk about myself here is that I have
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.640]  Time Magazine New York Times Newsweek Southern Parvy Law Center they called me
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:28.200]  today they're doing a cover story on their intelligence report demonizing me
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:32.560]  they're misrepresenting who I am what I stand for what I'm doing they're
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:36.960]  demonizing anybody that criticizes the banks as racist just nothing to do with
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:42.080]  it they're making it about Obama which is what they do you know the right wing
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:46.800]  makes it about Obama the left wing makes it about the Republicans to where as
[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:50.480]  you said we're a circular firing line all shooting at each other they've got the
[02:09:50.480 --> 02:09:56.640]  people shooting at each other but then meanwhile it's pretty creepy to now have
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.000]  the London Guardian and and just New York Daily News the Austin American
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.160]  Statesman no exaggeration three or four big publications a day saying I'm
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:12.000]  dangerous I'm bad Alex Jones has caused a huge psychosis globally I mean it's
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:15.280]  creeping my wife and I I mean I can handle the heat in the kitchen but I
[02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:20.240]  don't think of myself as that big you had recognized previously I didn't get you
[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:23.760]  want to talk about me but I want your advice that that I was super effective
[02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:26.680]  than I was being mimicked and you're more of a media expert than I've done it
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:31.640]  longer than I have what do you say to what I'm saying here why do you think
[02:10:31.640 --> 02:10:39.560]  this is happening Max Kaiser's line dropped I don't I don't want to do
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.560]  Skype anymore guys I maybe a little bit better audio quality but it just doesn't
[02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:48.520]  work to like foreign countries and places so and then we don't notice when
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:52.280]  the line drops that's always good to ask a long question because I mean I'm
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:11:00.040]  here watching this happen I'm watching this go on I am seeing it and I'm seeing
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:06.080]  myself being held up as the devil because I am identifying the banks as the
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.000]  enemy I'm telling people don't fight with Obama don't fight with the
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:15.520]  Republicans the leadership is controlled by the same people we have got to
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:21.040]  address the real issues and we've got to do it now and that's what Max Kaiser is
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:26.520]  doing Max Kaiser for several years on this show and his own television
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:33.640]  programs has been identifying the real enemy Max why do you think I don't know
[02:11:33.640 --> 02:11:37.120]  how much of my question you heard before your line dropped I'm asking your
[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:41.520]  advice why do you think the mainstream media is now identifying Alex Jones is
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:48.040]  this big number one enemy because you're so handsome no seriously because you've
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:52.120]  been telling me on and off air for the last year or so that I was really having
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:57.360]  an effect and I kind of put it off as you miss you know analyzing it but but I'm
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:12:05.880]  asking you now why do you think this is happening well I mean clearly the why
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:11.480]  there's a there's a deal that was out of the thing basically there's this credit
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:15.560]  crunch there's a credit collapse and no matter how much money they throw at it
[02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:19.080]  they can't reinflate the bubble they can't they're trying to get the bubble
[02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:23.480]  going again they can't do it so you know there's the people are are they're
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:27.720]  looking for scapegoats you know that the classic propaganda model going back you
[02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:33.720]  know to World War two is first you develop demagogues or develop and then
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:39.160]  you also develop scapegoats so wonder in Nazi Germany for example Hitler was the
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:44.520]  godlike figure and the minorities that they've chosen that they choose they
[02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:48.320]  choose were the scapegoats now here we have a little a blank find over a
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:52.400]  Goldman Sachs saying he's doing God's work he's clearly setting himself up as
[02:12:52.400 --> 02:12:56.600]  a demagogue he's in touch with God he's doing God's work and for the
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:00.120]  propaganda model to work he's got to pick up you gotta have scapegoats and they
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:05.120]  give awards they give they give Obama awards for starting more wars peace
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:09.960]  prizes so that's the joke they're God we're bad you need a scapegoat for the
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:14.080]  propaganda model to work it for because people need to love they mean that they
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.560]  needed to form up with their captor and they need to hate somebody so that's the
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:24.240]  way the propaganda model works so in America right now they're they're you
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:27.760]  know if you're the property if you're the scapegoat they need somebody to be
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:32.320]  the scapegoat so I mean but this is not this is not on unpredictable I mean
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:36.820]  this is quite this is the model that we're talking about because since the
[02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:42.760]  credit collapse has eliminated the easy money what we have now is
[02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:47.400]  this wholesale transference of wealth what's left into the pockets of the top
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:52.240]  1% and they have to do it in a way that everybody kind of thinks is is
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:56.400]  acceptable and they do this by scapegoating one portion of the
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:01.480]  population by setting themselves up as God and that they need to continue to
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:05.720]  transfer wealth to themselves because they need and that's the model that we've
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:11.240]  seen before history that's the model being used in the US today well max I
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:15.440]  mean you have always identified that the big power structure Wall Street and
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:21.440]  others are in control of both parties and you've been identifying the banks and
[02:14:21.440 --> 02:14:26.360]  and you talk about the revolt against the banking global dictatorship gaining
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:30.480]  steam but they've been more successful in the US playing different political
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:36.680]  grips off against each other divide and conquer specifically though what do you
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:41.040]  see unfolding in Iceland and in Greece I mean for those that don't know over the
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:48.160]  weekend Iceland voters reject repayment plan because it's a fraud yeah well as
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:52.000]  these currencies you know remember the Icelandic chronic collapse I was in
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:57.320]  Reykjavik a year before the collapse I was in the hotel 101 I was sitting with
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:02.120]  bankers from what was still a viable farm Lehman brothers and they told me
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:06.680]  that they were planning to attack the Icelandic Chrona using derivatives
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:10.560]  another financial product and that they were going to take the Icelandic
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:15.000]  economy down I made it I filmed at that time I spoke to bankers I told them you
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.920]  know this economy is going to blow up in less than a year because you are in
[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:22.120]  control of the speculators you have lost control of your economy and they
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:25.400]  laughed at me and they said no that's impossible and of course it would last
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:30.600]  in a year later the Chrona collapsed the Icelandic economy collapsed now we're
[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:34.520]  seeing the same speculators move on to Greece and move on to the Eurozone where
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:39.240]  they say to Greece you know we're going to collapse your economy unless you give
[02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:42.280]  us some of your islands and that you give us some of your tourist attractions
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:46.160]  which we can securitize and turn into derivatives and trade with each other
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.360]  for next year's Christmas bonus and if you don't do that we're going to crash
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:53.600]  your economy so they use these of derivatives as what basically weaponized
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:57.800]  financial products we sell a bank policy went to Congress instead either give it
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:02.800]  $700 billion remember at the end of 2008 if you give it $700 billion or we're
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:07.000]  going to crash your economy now that's that he held the Congress hostage to me
[02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:12.840]  I don't understand how he got away with holding the American Congress hostage
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:18.040]  like this and demanding $700 billion in ransom they mean you know the US is
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:22.520]  crying about pirates in Somalia what about the pirates on the floor right
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:25.760]  there in Congress they mean I don't understand the double standard there
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:30.600]  well I'm you may have seen this it just came out today Atlantic Monthly and I'll
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:36.040]  give folks a document cam shot of this it says a detention bill you ought to
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:40.560]  read more carefully again that's Atlantic Monthly here's the prison planet
[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:45.400]  dot com article dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerence this is a
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:49.880]  John McCain Joseph Lieberman bill says the enemy belligerent interrogation
[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:55.080]  detention and prosecution act of 2010 allows the holding of citizens inside
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:17:00.720]  the United States for any reason section 5 any matters as the president
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:06.520]  considers appropriate with no evidence of any crime being committed extra
[02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:10.960]  judicially by the military and then our homeland securities put out a training
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:15.400]  video of these mobile homeland security body scanning vans that will also
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:20.360]  brain scan you and then they will claim with their quackery just like the lie
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:24.400]  detector sent millions of innocent people to prison they'll have some minimum
[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:29.240]  wage TSA person say this shows you're a terrorist it tells of your lying
[02:17:29.240 --> 02:17:33.960]  supposedly and then you disappear I mean my god I mean I'm living in the running
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:38.960]  man max this is it this is incredible well it's because they're broke they
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:43.360]  think they did the easiest way to make money in the world is in the prison
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:48.560]  business and we know that the prison business in the u.s. is thriving the
[02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:52.080]  u.s. has the biggest prison population in the world it's growing the fastest
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:56.440]  minority in the United States in terms of growth is the prison population we
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:59.640]  know that the private companies that own the prison they own the restaurants and
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:03.000]  hotels that are located near the prison so when you go to visit your family in
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:06.760]  prison you stay in the hotel and eat in the restaurants you're paying the same
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:10.040]  owner who owns the prison we know that the prison owners lobby Washington to
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:14.360]  get laws passed to make it easier to put people into prison and this is a huge
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:17.720]  moneymaker it's the easy way to make money you see in the United States
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:22.080]  unfortunately they don't have enough self-confidence anymore to compete and do
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:26.440]  things like high technology and go to the moon you know the fact that Barack
[02:18:26.440 --> 02:18:30.240]  Obama canceled NASA and canceled all the space programs was really a shame
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:33.320]  because you know if it wasn't for NASA there wasn't for man landing on the moon
[02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:38.040]  in 1969 there would have been no Silicon Valley there would have been no Google
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:41.040]  there would have been no Microsoft there would have been no Oracle software
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:45.560]  there would have been no IBM doing the PC industry there's no Apple computer it
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:50.200]  was it you know the cutting edge of it of a technological revolution based on
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:53.800]  the fact that everybody wanted to be an astronaut every now and people wanted to
[02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:57.040]  get our science degrees and America was competitive and we were going to beat
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.800]  the Russians with Sputnik and it was a very competitive society but now
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:05.640]  America's lost its will to compete so they basically all they want to do is
[02:19:05.640 --> 02:19:09.720]  build prisons and lock people up for money because they're broke and they
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:13.280]  don't know how do they have too much debt you see America is like the guy is
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:17.520]  like a student with too much debt who gives up or the unemployed guy too much
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:21.160]  debt who gives up the entire country is like this they have too much debt so
[02:19:21.160 --> 02:19:25.760]  instead of trying to compete or to get a job and to compete on the world stage
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:29.620]  they're just they've given up America's given up on itself it doesn't have enough
[02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:32.840]  confidence to really want to compete on the world stage anymore they're letting
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:37.480]  China and India and these other countries take center stage but that was the
[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:40.880]  globalist that was the globalist plan I read that from documents in the 70s
[02:19:40.880 --> 02:19:45.240]  move everything to China get us in debt turn us into a prison colony implode out
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:50.320]  our economy and all we'll provide is propaganda and military hardware max
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:55.480]  let's look at the IMF suggests how to raise climate change funds this is
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:59.680]  really just their global tax but how would private bankers sell a global tax
[02:19:59.680 --> 02:20:03.720]  oh to save the penguins and then we'll talk about where Max Kaiser sees this

[02:21:17.040 --> 02:21:21.560]  underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president
[02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:26.240]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon
[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:31.520]  all of us as American citizens to pay attention full of the Republic identifies
[02:21:31.520 --> 02:21:36.640]  the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:40.640]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:44.560]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:48.600]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and

[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:18.520]  the government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:22.400]  dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for you that's
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:26.600]  not what's happening you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package
[02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:30.480]  wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your
[02:22:30.480 --> 02:22:34.920]  retirement would be secure if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to

[02:23:56.360 --> 02:24:02.520]  me big John Lipscomb host of don't tread on me radio show
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:14.320]  Associated Press today IMF suggests how to raise climate change funds the head
[02:24:14.320 --> 02:24:20.720]  of the International Monetary Fund director Dominic Strauss Kahn says that
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:26.800]  nations should have a quota system based on their GDP paid directly to the
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:31.920]  IMF and World Bank to save the earth from climate change and they admit
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:35.760]  where the money goes and what they do with it will be secret has nothing to do
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.280]  with it they couldn't get Congress to pass the bill so they're just doing it
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:43.320]  this is what they said at the end of Copenhagen what's the thinking of these
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:48.480]  people globally Max Kaiser because the money isn't there the people are going
[02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:53.400]  bankrupt the unemployment's over 20 plus percent and all these counties and
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:59.320]  cities and states are passing laws the tax food Europe's passing more taxes
[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:04.280]  they're bringing in unlimited amounts of immigrants who then weigh down the
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:09.680]  welfare system I mean the banks want to bankrupt things well they're looking
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:14.240]  for a new bubble and they were able to turn real estate into a wildly
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:20.640]  successful bubble that was after the Nasdaq bubble which was after the long
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:26.160]  term capital management bubble and savings and loan crisis bubble so they
[02:25:26.160 --> 02:25:30.720]  need to create they need to find a new bubble carbon trading they hope will be
[02:25:30.720 --> 02:25:35.720]  this new bubble if you get the laws around the world forcing governments
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:39.800]  to buy into the carbon trading scheme then you have a ready buyer you have
[02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:43.920]  demand for the product then you can collateralize and securitize that
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:47.760]  demand and create futures contracts and derivatives that you can swap with each
[02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:52.280]  other and and that's the theory is that if you create a hundred billion and
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:55.560]  two hundred billion and multi trillion dollar derivatives bubble based on this
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:26:00.400]  new asset the carbon based asset then it'll be trickled down economy and it
[02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:04.640]  will be back to the way it was in 2005 and 2006 all we need is another huge
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:09.880]  bubble but in my opinion the next big bubble to come down the pike is
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:13.520]  something that nobody's talking about right now and it's going to be what
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:16.960]  we're seeing over there cancer fits Gerald and the commodity futures trading
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:21.640]  commission headed up by Gary Gensler who's a former Goldman Sachs guy he's
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:24.800]  over there commodity futures trading commission they're going to authorize
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:30.280]  starting next month trading in box office futures contracts in my opinion
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:34.840]  this has the appeal this has the potential to be the next huge bubble and
[02:26:34.840 --> 02:26:39.200]  bust in the American economy and we are unique and now we're going to see the
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:42.400]  creation of a bubble it's like looking through the Hubble telescope and seeing
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:46.760]  the creation of a faraway galaxy here we're going to watch a bubble go from
[02:26:46.760 --> 02:26:52.000]  zero to five hundred billion dollars and then back to zero again in the course
[02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:57.160]  of 24 months and this is going to be heralded as an amazing saving grace for
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:01.200]  the American economy they're gonna take box office futures which a box office
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:05.080]  receipts which are roughly 10 to 15 billion dollars a year where they look
[02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:08.960]  at it domestically or worldwide they're going to securitize that and they're
[02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:12.560]  going to introduce hundreds of billions of dollars of box office collateralized
[02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:16.360]  futures contracts and this is going to be made available to millions of
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:20.440]  investors and the bankers are going to make money on the way up and then when
[02:27:20.440 --> 02:27:23.720]  it all goes bankrupt they'll make money on a hollywood bailout
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:28.920]  well this is multi-dimensional because first of all there's three major pieces
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:34.960]  to this first of all this is an insider trader's paradise this is a gangsters
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:41.360]  paradise being overseen by Gary Gensler chairman of the CFTC who I sent some I
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:45.320]  made some you know I reached out to them to try to warn them about what was
[02:27:45.320 --> 02:27:49.440]  going on here but this is a former Goldman Sachs guy he's been put in place by
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:53.480]  the banking cartel and they're going to oversee with cancer for child this
[02:27:53.480 --> 02:27:59.760]  enormous enormous catastrophe the insider trading possibilities are really
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:04.880]  unbelievable like nothing we've seen before now we'll see films that they
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:10.120]  short where they'll sabotage the release well that's the beginning of it so let's
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:13.320]  say you've got two movies opening in two years you know Indiana Jones the night
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.880]  the sequel spider-man the sequel there's going to be that the news the global
[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:22.000]  news treats this as real news you know the hollywood news is covered before
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:27.040]  world news the hollywood news it's the global current and this is covered you
[02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:30.800]  know before you know earthquakes and foreign countries before people declare
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.800]  war they tell you what angeli jolly and Brad Pitt are doing you know this is
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:38.240]  the most important thing for most people this is the basis of why this is
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:43.880]  going to be a huge spectacular bubble so they're going to be of course shorting
[02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:48.080]  each other's projects in the in the market to sabotage each other's projects
[02:28:48.080 --> 02:28:51.920]  that's one aspect to it but also we know that they're going to be colluding with
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:56.240]  each other just like Goldman and JP Morgan and he's got a collude now in the
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:59.960]  derivatives business they're going to be colluding in these box office and then
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:03.840]  when it totally implodes the banks will fully control that an industry they
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:08.360]  already dominated and they'll be able to politicize it even more because now
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:14.240]  there'll be all these city and county and state money invested well I don't
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:18.840]  have the retail see the thing of the thing that about a con game the way
[02:29:18.840 --> 02:29:23.720]  con works Alex is he the con has to want to be con you know we've all seen
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:29.320]  this the scene of of con men working their trade when when these box office
[02:29:29.320 --> 02:29:33.320]  features contract are released to the public people are going to be tripping
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:37.640]  over themselves to get involved in this new business because everybody wants a
[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:42.080]  piece of the celebrity Hollywood exactly they'll say I'm I'm involved in the new
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:46.160]  Brad Pitt movie stay there let's explain how the con works then they'll balloon it
[02:29:46.160 --> 02:29:50.920]  up and then implode it and it just continues we have a Goldman Sachs guy
[02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:55.560]  setting up the grease collapse now running the grease collapse we're on

[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:32.400]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:08.160]  off Ken lay types you got cut off by the break max Kaiser continue right well
[02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:12.680]  it's for the kind of work that the person has to want to be condo basically
[02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:16.960]  and that in this case you're you're conning them with the come on with
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:21.000]  Hollywood by turning Hollywood into a Ponzi scheme that anybody lose money on
[02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:25.400]  but beyond that there's another piece of this which is the technology itself the
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:30.360]  virtual specialist technology that I invented back in 1996 this technology
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:36.360]  it effectively it was invented when I put it together to eliminate all of the
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:40.320]  front-running abuse that I saw on the floor of the stock exchange when I was
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:44.600]  working as a stock broker so it's designed to eliminate what's called the
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:49.400]  broker-dealer conflict of interest because everyone is buying and selling
[02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:52.680]  stocks professionally on the floor of the exchange they act as both a broker
[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:56.480]  matching buyers themselves but they also act as a principal in buying and
[02:36:56.480 --> 02:37:01.040]  selling for their own account my technology eliminates the conflict of
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:04.440]  interest it eliminates front-running it eliminates what we call now high
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:09.800]  frequency trading that technology that patent is being warehouse by Cantor
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:13.840]  Fitzgerald and not being allowed into the public domain because they make a
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:16.920]  ton of money supporting the infrastructure of Wall Street which makes
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:20.840]  a ton of money doing things like high frequency trading and front-running so
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:23.960]  it's just like a drug company whose warehousing and valuable patents on a
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:27.440]  drug even though could cure lots of people it would cut into an existing
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:32.040]  business so Cantor is effectively warehousing a technology that could
[02:37:32.040 --> 02:37:36.200]  save Americans hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars that are lost
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:40.280]  by abuse on the floor of the exchange by these banks engaging in front of
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:44.000]  instead it's come out that the big banks have special government developed
[02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:48.640]  programs that allow them to actually cheat the market that these these
[02:37:48.640 --> 02:37:53.720]  technologies the high-frequency trading as revealed when they captured one of
[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:57.800]  the defectors from Goldman Sachs a few months ago they set up shop on the
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:01.360]  floor of the exchange and they siphon off billions of dollars Goldman says they
[02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:06.720]  make a hundred million dollars a day on their book a lot of it comes from high
[02:38:06.720 --> 02:38:10.480]  frequency trading on the floor the exchange using this siphoning technique
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:13.520]  where they go into the exchange and they get involved in the market making
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:18.240]  process and they basically siphon money out my technology the high virtual
[02:38:18.240 --> 02:38:23.480]  specialist technology patent number 5950176 in the US would eliminate all
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.080]  of that and save hundreds of millions of not billions of dollars but it's
[02:38:27.080 --> 02:38:31.160]  being a warehouse by Cantor Cantor won't put it into the public domain because
[02:38:31.160 --> 02:38:33.840]  they know that it would cut into their business and would cut into their fellow
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:41.720]  Wall Street broker business Max Kaiser where does it end because we are seeing
[02:38:41.720 --> 02:38:45.600]  people say no in Greece but it doesn't matter Goldman set it up 10 years ago
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:50.640]  they're now running as you know but listeners may not the the the bankruptcy
[02:38:50.640 --> 02:38:54.880]  there at the government level they've paid off the politicians everywhere you
[02:38:54.880 --> 02:38:59.480]  look it's Goldman Sachs piloting the fraud than the other big banks nexusing
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:04.720]  in with them help fund them and carry it out with them but Iceland voters and we
[02:39:04.720 --> 02:39:08.000]  have one of the leaders of the parliament Jones daughter you're joining us
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:13.680]  tomorrow they used anti terror laws as you know but listeners may have missed
[02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:19.080]  it like there's a headline UK anti terror laws right move against Icelandic
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:23.680]  banks that's out of a British newspaper where they're even seizing
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:28.040]  citizens money saying well your government owes us this money ten times
[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:33.240]  the entire GDP of the nation and then now that they've said no the banks are
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:36.360]  going guess what we actually owned assets in your country already that'll pay
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:41.560]  this off okay that's fine but they're still gonna try some other chicanery I
[02:39:41.560 --> 02:39:46.760]  mean explain how Goldman Sachs ally with the other big brokerage banks takes
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:50.480]  down nations and now we've got top politicians in the US the leader of the
[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:54.800]  Democrats in the Senate saying the same thing's gonna happen here but saying
[02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:59.080]  we've got to do whatever the banks say in the next financial terrorism or we'll
[02:39:59.080 --> 02:40:03.080]  have a depression but we know we're getting a depression by letting them to
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:06.600]  continue to rape us and we've seen all the headlines of her Bloomberg financial
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:10.800]  listen every day with the bankers bragging look how we got more power out
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:15.280]  of our last scam let's go even bigger you know the world is ours I mean it's
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:20.600]  just it's so transparent well Iceland is pushing back you know do you feel
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:23.440]  you saw that story that I was going to introduce they're trying to work on a
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:30.440]  new a new scheme now to make themselves a free press country an Iceland now is
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:35.240]  going to raise the bar and be a country the only country in the world where
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:39.880]  people can go like wiki leaks can be set up and and not be under threat of
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:43.560]  prosecution so I was taking it to the next level they're saying not only we're
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:46.120]  gonna get rid of the bad bankers we're gonna start getting rid of the bad
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:50.520]  media and we're gonna start to get rid of all the all the garbage out there
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:55.320]  that's called the Icelandic modern media initiative that's right they want to
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:00.520]  come out of this as a shining example not only to the banking fraudsters but
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:04.200]  all the media that supports the party you see the jackals that John Perkins
[02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:09.280]  talks about what do you think black ops are gonna do try to stop this cuz one
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:13.360]  example of people standing up you know if one aunt stands up they can all
[02:41:13.360 --> 02:41:18.120]  stand up and those little puny ants outnumber us a thousand to one well
[02:41:18.120 --> 02:41:21.920]  that's why the people of Greece native get involved with the people of
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:25.360]  Iceland that's why when you're talking on your show about the different groups
[02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:32.160]  in the u.s. that are struggling to emerge from this new post-credit crisis
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:35.920]  suppression and we're all being demonized we're all being demonized as
[02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:39.440]  terrorists they have common cause with the people in Iceland the people in
[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:43.400]  Greece and people all over the world this is a global problem so when you
[02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:46.960]  have the global dimension you're not talking about oh a few hundred thousand
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:50.760]  or a few million in the u.s. who are struggling against their oppressors are
[02:41:50.760 --> 02:41:54.080]  talking about millions all over the world who are struggling against the
[02:41:54.080 --> 02:41:58.160]  basically the same group of bankers Goldman Sachs is in there is at the
[02:41:58.160 --> 02:42:01.000]  center of everything you know I mean they were in the center of the grease
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.760]  problem they were now at the New York Post just talked about in 2005 they were
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:12.040]  behind a deal to cook the books as far as the new ocean front development that
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:14.840]  they were working on a new seaside development we're working on we know
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:18.680]  that they cook the books in 2000 to allow Greece into the euro to begin with
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:24.120]  they did some additional tricks in 2009 okay so the name keeps coming up
[02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:28.520]  talking about people all over the world millions of people in countries all over
[02:42:28.520 --> 02:42:32.840]  the world we and then we only know that there are two or three of those at the
[02:42:32.840 --> 02:42:37.120]  center of the problem you're telling me that millions around the world can't
[02:42:37.120 --> 02:42:43.360]  figure out a way to decapitalize just one or two of the worst of the worst I
[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:47.200]  mean that's come on now let me expand on that but I want to ask you where you're
[02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:51.680]  back I mean I dropped on your head as a kid I mean are you mentally impaired I
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.280]  mean I use Alex Jones but I mean anybody listen to this no I understand
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:00.440]  but the problem but Max that's what I'm trying to ask you guys are that's what
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:04.960]  I'm trying to ask you is I was listening to Bloomberg Financial Saturday night I
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:09.440]  was on with her all done I was driving home for 30 minutes listening to it they
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:14.000]  had a former Goldman Sachs CEO on bragging that well the reason we're
[02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:18.520]  do so good is we have our people all over government I mean they know they are
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:25.040]  a lawless mafia pirate group that yeah yeah remember in New York City where I
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:29.680]  lived for many years you had a guy named Don Gotti that the dapper Don who was
[02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:35.520]  very blatant walking around town in his $2,000 suit you know bragging about his
[02:43:35.520 --> 02:43:39.760]  criminality now you've got Lloyd Blank fine who goes on TV bragging about his
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:44.080]  criminality because they know they can get away with it with impunity it doesn't
[02:43:44.080 --> 02:43:46.960]  mean that it doesn't mean they're doing anything less criminal it's just that
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:50.480]  there's no there's no regulations in place right now at the moment you know
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:53.640]  the reason the only way to get after these guys is you've got to attack it
[02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:58.000]  like a racket that's a bring in anti-racketeering laws they control
[02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.800]  Northcom they control Homeland Security they control the Southern Poverty Law
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:07.840]  Center and they're demonizing anyone that criticizes them but I don't see it
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:12.460]  working this time I mean why are they so arrogant I mean I've never seen and we've
[02:44:12.460 --> 02:44:15.400]  interviewed all these different financial experts university professors
[02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:19.560]  former federal regulators they say there's never been fraud at anywhere near
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:23.240]  this magnitude they cover it and fall the Republic that you appear in I mean why
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:29.960]  why why do they think they're invincible well we you know this is this is the
[02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:34.000]  ego I worked on Wall Street and it's really it's very typical to find people
[02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:38.520]  who have a God complex because and and especially after 9 of the attacks of
[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:42.800]  9-11 there's this notion that they attacked people the people on Wall
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:46.200]  Street and for them to come back and re-establish their business they were
[02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:49.680]  doing they're doing something more than just shuffling lots of paper and
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:54.840]  stealing money they were now fighting some epic clash of civilization so they
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:58.560]  got into their head that they're doing something cosmically important and
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:03.720]  once you get you know you inhale the sniff of this the God complex it's very
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:07.880]  intoxicating so the people this is why they keep referring to themselves as
[02:45:07.880 --> 02:45:12.520]  God because they really believe that they're doing something extraordinarily
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:17.240]  important for the benefit of humanity as a whole but this is the part of the
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.120]  propaganda model you have to really believe your God did you put your head
[02:45:21.120 --> 02:45:25.440]  at the pillow at night and ignored the fact that you're impoverishing millions
[02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:29.960]  of people and in the countries around the world you're causing mass starvation
[02:45:29.960 --> 02:45:34.880]  and and colonization and massive problems so they have this is incredible
[02:45:34.880 --> 02:45:38.960]  God complex and it goes right into the White House you know that the problem in
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:43.080]  the White House is of course you've got basically the way like Barack Obama for
[02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:46.520]  example the way he attacks health care if he looks at the health care stocks if
[02:45:46.520 --> 02:45:50.000]  they're going up he says he thinks he's doing a good job if they're going down
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:54.480]  he thinks he's doing a bad job he's a day trader Barack Obama is a day trader he
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:58.360]  looks at all the America's policies in front of him he trades them like a day
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:02.440]  trader who's just trading stocks all day he has actually no idea he's a servant
[02:46:02.440 --> 02:46:05.000]  of the people he doesn't have any idea what that even though what that means
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:10.320]  he just he's just a basically nickel and dime and the day with a few more
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:15.200]  bucks than he started with max I want to go to calls but how do you see this
[02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:19.880]  ending not how you wish it would end but trending outwards we do see a lot of
[02:46:19.880 --> 02:46:23.840]  resistance forming we see the bankers like Marie Antoinette saying let them
[02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:30.800]  eat cake how do you see this unfolding you and I end up doing wildly popular
[02:46:30.800 --> 02:46:38.240]  cooking shows we're gonna be on the food channel and it's gonna be Alex and
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:42.280]  Max cooking chili you know and it's gonna be it's all gonna be over we're
[02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:46.080]  gonna be let's make it let's make a chili it's called the America chili will
[02:46:46.080 --> 02:46:50.160]  be hey out remember when America existed back in a few years ago I'll be like
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:53.520]  yeah it was a great country back then wasn't it yeah put a little bit more
[02:46:53.520 --> 02:46:57.320]  chili powder in the chili yeah by the way after this show the Chinese will be
[02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:00.440]  coming on the new orders of America and they'll be making some nice Chinese food
[02:47:00.440 --> 02:47:06.040]  stay tuned for the next show by America post-america new China land by well that
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:09.000]  really is it but that's the bigger David Rockefeller plan there's a method of
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:12.680]  this madness they said in the 70s they would bankrupt this move everything to
[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:18.560]  China and now China says they're the king daddy and the police don't care as
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:23.160]  long as they can taser somebody and I guess we just fall into a big pile is
[02:47:23.160 --> 02:47:28.320]  what you're saying well clearly on the money front I mean China has the
[02:47:28.320 --> 02:47:35.320]  ability to dictate policy in America because every time the US tries to push
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:38.800]  back the China just says okay well we're just gonna stop buying your US
[02:47:38.800 --> 02:47:42.880]  Treasury bond so they have the US sovereignty again it's it's all about
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:46.960]  market trading and China owns an extraordinary amount of you and I've
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:51.520]  never seen that such such such saber-rattling their their government's
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:55.120]  openly saying they're gonna start dumping the dollar that that that we're now an
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:59.480]  enemy I've got the articles here today that we're no longer on good stead with
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:07.520]  the US why is China saying all this well because they they want to now let the
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:11.880]  world know that they're in charge and that people should not be doing deals
[02:48:11.880 --> 02:48:16.720]  with the US Russia shouldn't be doing deals with the US Iran of course they're
[02:48:16.720 --> 02:48:20.400]  doing deals with Iran even though America's saber-rattling with Iran they
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:23.360]  want to let the world know that they're open for business they're all over
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:27.360]  Africa they're buying a strategic asset they're buying oil related assets but
[02:48:27.360 --> 02:48:30.400]  China wants to let the world know that listen don't believe that malarkey
[02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:34.240]  coming out of the US that that they're still in control we're in control we're
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:37.800]  doing deals we've got lots of money we're open for business they have to let
[02:48:37.800 --> 02:48:41.520]  get that message out and that's why they they every time they get a chance
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:46.560]  whether it's to go up against Google or go up against whomever they want to let
[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:50.200]  the world know that they're open for business and for the world to focus their
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:49:00.640]  attention on what's possible now in China and they also on every front say no
[02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:07.720]  to the UN they're saying no to the carbon taxes they're saying no to all of
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:11.480]  this and saying you Americans go ahead and raise carbon taxes and then your
[02:49:11.480 --> 02:49:17.120]  banks are going to invest your money with us go ahead idiots China's not
[02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:24.840]  spending 50% of any of the you know in the US they spend 50% of tax revenue
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:30.640]  and one and a half trillion on on defense to fight wars that are completely
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:33.360]  obsolete because now we know that the world war three is going to be fought
[02:49:33.360 --> 02:49:36.760]  in the currency pit it's going to be currency against currency no it's going
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:41.440]  to send tanks you know China doesn't need to send tanks at the California they
[02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:44.080]  just going to dump US Treasury bonds they're not going to waste money buying
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:47.680]  you know infrastructure except a military infrastructure unless it makes
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:51.920]  good TV show no they're actually building a real infrastructure they're
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:57.320]  actually building a real infrastructure and instead our infrastructure is body
[02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:03.960]  scanners checkpoints potbellied cops with machine guns the US just put his
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:09.920]  first high-speed train in on in California in China I think as already
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:13.720]  has enough high-speed train track to go from New York to LA or something is
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:17.280]  something extraordinary you know they're putting a high-speed train tracks I
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:23.520]  mean but they're clearly they're they're in they're in control and it's you
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:28.080]  know the solutions for the US are not are not hard to figure out but the
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:32.200]  problem is you've got this incredible bottleneck because you've got the the
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:36.040]  the banks and the politicians have fused together to create this enormous
[02:50:36.040 --> 02:50:39.200]  hurdle well the other big problem max we're going to break come back with
[02:50:39.200 --> 02:50:43.400]  some calls is the Pentagon says well we're going to expand worldwide but
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:47.960]  even if we implode will make the American people our enemy and continue our
[02:50:47.960 --> 02:50:52.240]  domination here and they they like to live like Somalia where the Pentagon
[02:50:52.240 --> 02:50:56.720]  with bankers above them just sits on top of big slag heap with all of us
[02:50:56.720 --> 02:51:01.400]  walking around in loincloths and so the Pentagon's just taken over the roads the
[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:07.240]  schools the police body scanners license plate readers you just might be only a
[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:11.480]  few meals away from anarchy look at the recent world events and even the

[02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:18.680]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:52:18.680 --> 02:52:23.640]  I've turned a memories influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[02:52:23.640 --> 02:52:29.120]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:33.040]  pay attention full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:38.040]  the criminal off-shore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:42.160]  ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke that are arsonists

[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:35.960]  nightmare and I'm just here covering it and I've got every major newspaper and
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:40.280]  government operation demonizing the hell out of me right now because we are
[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:45.640]  effective and they know that we know they're criminals and coming up next
[02:54:45.640 --> 02:54:48.240]  hour I'm gonna get into all the news and I haven't even covered yet it's just
[02:54:48.240 --> 02:54:53.840]  unspeakably insane let's go to Melissa in mass you're on with Max Kaiser go
[02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:59.040]  ahead hi Alex hi Max thank you so much for taking my call I have two really
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:03.640]  quick things to know I used to work at TD bank I worked there for four years and
[02:55:03.640 --> 02:55:08.240]  one thing is that they utilize a website blocker that's intended to be used for
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:13.120]  employees so they don't look at sexually vulgar or sexually explicit
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:17.760]  websites they block both info wars and prison planet and listed at for militants
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:21.520]  behavior so that was interesting I thought they should know that second
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:26.760]  thing this new overdraft fee revenue law that's going into effect July 1st is
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:30.040]  there a bottom line there that we're not saying I know how important overdraft
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:33.760]  fees are to the big banks yeah this is a question that I'd throw in for Max
[02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:40.000]  they're announcing that they may not ensure your money markets they're
[02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:43.680]  announcing they may keep your money for seven days they're in there openly
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:47.840]  talking about dollar devaluations they're openly saying they may take people's
[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:51.480]  pension funds and the government will then give you part of it back Max Kaiser
[02:55:51.480 --> 02:55:56.760]  yeah well this is just every every week we get more information that's pointing
[02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:01.800]  into pointing in the same direction isn't it the banks they they're out of
[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:04.800]  money they don't have any money they want your money they're setting it up now
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:09.400]  so they can make it easy to freeze your account you don't have access to your
[02:56:09.400 --> 02:56:12.440]  account or whatever I mean they they're broke they're they're sitting on a
[02:56:12.440 --> 02:56:16.120]  hundred and billions of losses that they have not yet disclosed there's another
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:22.600]  second leg to the crisis in play right now then there's another huge gap down
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:25.280]  in real but they're saying they're gonna use the crisis to have a
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:31.240]  constitution of the world where we pay our taxes to the banks they they
[02:56:31.240 --> 02:56:36.160]  consider any any deposit in any bank if they consider it to be their money
[02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:41.360]  but let's just say that and they think Northcom just like they're doing in
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:46.040]  Greece will allow them to take everybody's money and they're using this
[02:56:46.040 --> 02:56:49.760]  propaganda model that we're God and we need to fight the bad guys and if you
[02:56:49.760 --> 02:56:54.040]  resist your scapegoat you know and talk about city back city back last week it
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:56:59.680]  was disclosed that this group it's a new group called fabulous it serves the
[02:56:59.680 --> 02:57:02.720]  gay community the city group said we don't like your material we're gonna
[02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:05.880]  freeze your account so here they're scapegoating the gay community when
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:10.680]  did we see that last oh the 1930s in Nazi Germany again they pick a group they
[02:57:10.680 --> 02:57:14.680]  think some popular with most people to set the precedent like oh we're just
[02:57:14.680 --> 02:57:18.120]  gonna secretly arrest Americans that are Muslims and now they've got a bill
[02:57:18.120 --> 02:57:26.080]  for everybody it's classic scapegoating you know 101 scapegoating 101 thank you
[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:30.400]  Melissa pastor in Ohio you're on the air let me just have something to that you
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:34.120]  know you remember in America we had the Jim Crow laws which were discriminatory
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:38.320]  laws yeah and some people can only use this you know if the colors only
[02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:43.040]  bathroom right colors only sections in the in the restaurant at the back of the
[02:57:43.040 --> 02:57:46.480]  bus well the same thing is it being applied to interest rates if you're a
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:52.160]  Goldman you get to borrow money at 1% and get a free rate of return at 17% if
[02:57:52.160 --> 02:57:56.080]  you're everybody else you have to borrow money at 17% and the most you'll ever
[02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:59.920]  get on that is 1% on your money well that's like the only you it's a Jim
[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:03.080]  Crow law using interest rates is discriminating against anyone who's not a
[02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:09.320]  Goldman's tax employee get at the back of the bus and shut up well in the EU the
[02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:14.200]  bureaucrats have a 17% income tax and everybody else has a 50% and it's the
[02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:18.480]  same thing expanding on every level now they have these homeland security no
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:22.680]  fly list it'll be no work list and they just magically put whoever they want on
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:27.280]  it with no evidence I mean it's just a but don't worry we'll arrest some college
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:31.200]  students that threw some cotton balls out on the ground that that means black
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:38.240]  people pick cotton we'll arrest them for terrorism but then we'll abort 52% of the

[03:00:55.000 --> 03:01:00.000]  I noticed that I noticed the different things that you're saying trust me Alex
[03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:05.600]  you are not alone even though you may not hear and know of the people that are

[03:01:10.600 --> 03:01:14.160]  you guys have the resources and we'll pastor let me be clear I know the
[03:01:14.160 --> 03:01:19.160]  world's on fire with people waking up Max knows that I just can't believe people
[03:01:19.160 --> 03:01:23.520]  aren't even waking up faster because it's so outrageous but I appreciate your
[03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:30.560]  call I mean Max you see the huge awakening don't you well I'm gonna I'm
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:34.960]  curious to see exactly how the huge awakening will happen because what form
[03:01:34.960 --> 03:01:40.560]  it'll take because you know in the 60s we had a huge awakening and it took the
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:45.680]  form of a musical revolution and a social revolution and then basically
[03:01:45.680 --> 03:01:48.640]  society went back to sleep you know here's something very interesting I see
[03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:53.120]  in Berkeley California the students now are protesting against these rise in
[03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:57.080]  great which of course is great that they're protesting that but where were
[03:01:57.080 --> 03:02:02.160]  the students two years ago when they were all supporting the Iraq war invasion
[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:06.960]  and they were all tattletailing on their professors who were against the Iraq war
[03:02:06.960 --> 03:02:10.480]  invasion remember that two or three years ago when professors said we're
[03:02:10.480 --> 03:02:13.640]  against here well all the money that was spent in Iraq they don't have any
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:16.240]  money for education now they're protesting because they don't have money
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:20.160]  for education well tough luck you should absolutely against the Iraq war two or
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:24.160]  three years ago and now you have money for education let's talk to Petunia in
[03:02:24.160 --> 03:02:28.480]  Texas Petunia you're on the air with Max Kaiser hi thank you thank you for
[03:02:28.480 --> 03:02:32.520]  taking the call just very quickly I think that one of the things that we need
[03:02:32.520 --> 03:02:36.880]  to do is to bring a third party like the Constitution Party of Texas we're
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:42.160]  trying to get ballot access right now and it's not easy you know the two big
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:45.520]  party of the Republicans and the Democrats have a little monopoly going
[03:02:45.520 --> 03:02:49.440]  on and when it's well the public better get out there and realize that we did
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:53.240]  it to take our states back against this takeover and it needs to be done now do
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:59.160]  you have a question for Max Kaiser well um you don't I appreciate your call I
[03:02:59.160 --> 03:03:02.520]  gotta let you go okay I told you these are calls for Max Kaiser you can call
[03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:06.960]  back another time on that Mike and Louisiana you're on the air go ahead
[03:03:06.960 --> 03:03:16.760]  things so one I in in all the polls when it comes to 9-11 it seems like there's
[03:03:16.760 --> 03:03:22.800]  an overwhelming majority of the public on these polls that are want a new and
[03:03:22.800 --> 03:03:27.080]  big investigation or otherwise don't believe the guy on the media says we're
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:33.680]  terrorist the majority of America here's my question why don't why is there a
[03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:39.840]  candidate that is reading these polls and running on a 9-11 investigation
[03:03:39.840 --> 03:03:45.500]  platform make a great question you gotta get that to Max Kaiser max well
[03:03:45.500 --> 03:03:49.280]  apparently New Hampshire is going for it New Hampshire is now going to do a full
[03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:52.800]  scale and they're put something on the ballot they're gonna do a non-binding
[03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:58.480]  look into this event and so there are pockets the you know states are taking
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:02.240]  the chicken up the ball that's right they've got what now it's a majority of
[03:04:02.240 --> 03:04:06.240]  their town signing on because in New Hampshire they have right to revolt right
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:10.640]  to revolt laws where they can force it onto the ballot and at the statehouse of
[03:04:10.640 --> 03:04:14.920]  the town's one yeah now I went out let's say if I'm in America I would say
[03:04:14.920 --> 03:04:17.960]  you know what I think I moved to New Hampshire let New Hampshire reap the
[03:04:17.960 --> 03:04:21.720]  benefit of wanting to pursue this and move to New Hampshire boost their
[03:04:21.720 --> 03:04:25.240]  economy get a job in New Hampshire make New Hampshire you know the New
[03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:30.600]  California because they're not afraid to look at stuff go to New Hampshire well
[03:04:30.600 --> 03:04:33.900]  in closing Max well said I'm glad you brought that up because I mentioned it
[03:04:33.900 --> 03:04:36.520]  last week but it hardly talked about it I want to get some people on from New
[03:04:36.520 --> 03:04:40.520]  Hampshire they're leading this that's why the system is demonizing 9-11 truth
[03:04:40.520 --> 03:04:45.440]  24-7 now they're scared of something and they know the majority of America's

[03:08:36.560 --> 03:08:40.520]  engaged in any violence in the last two years I've seen mainstream media
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:46.520]  talking points that 9-11 truth is going to attack the government that has now
[03:08:46.520 --> 03:08:53.240]  happened last Thursday and Fox News had me on Saturday night Geraldo Rivera to
[03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:59.160]  officially come out and say this has destroyed your movement no physics and
[03:08:59.160 --> 03:09:04.480]  reality and science hasn't done that we expose your false flag terror and you're
[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:07.680]  not going to be able to stop the truth from coming out no matter how much
[03:09:07.680 --> 03:09:14.880]  terrorism you stage and we're gonna have Webster Tarpley on today in the last 20

[03:09:29.960 --> 03:09:37.160]  great okay so that is coming up here's an article 12 New England towns demand
[03:09:37.160 --> 03:09:44.600]  9-1-1 investigation reinvestigation a new movement to reinstate the 9-11 attacks
[03:09:44.600 --> 03:09:49.680]  a new movement to reinvestigate the 9-11 attacks is gaining pace in the US with
[03:09:49.680 --> 03:09:53.920]  major public support 12 towns are set to decide whether to ask the federal
[03:09:53.920 --> 03:09:59.240]  government for a new independent probe because in New Hampshire they can have
[03:09:59.240 --> 03:10:06.880]  the cities basically order the legislature what to do New York is
[03:10:06.880 --> 03:10:10.400]  dubbed as the Empire State for its wealth and resources and is rightfully
[03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:14.480]  regarded as America's most famous city a beacon of fashion finance and fast-paced
[03:10:14.480 --> 03:10:18.880]  action New Hampshire is the granite state for so-called self-sufficiency less
[03:10:18.880 --> 03:10:24.920]  flash and cash more famous for hosting the first US presidential primary and
[03:10:24.920 --> 03:10:29.720]  it continues they're talking about all the cities that are moving for a new
[03:10:29.720 --> 03:10:36.800]  investigation this is why the system is so concerned and trying to demonize 911
[03:10:36.800 --> 03:10:42.400]  truth it's asinine 911 truth exposing government-sponsored terrorism and then
[03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:47.680]  the government tries to say we are terrorists it's not going to work but
[03:10:47.680 --> 03:10:51.480]  they're also demonizing the tea parties the end the Fedders the barthers
[03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:54.680]  everybody else we're being told we're terrorists we're going to commit terror
[03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:58.960]  attacks by the Southern Poverty Law Center and others that are spokesmen for
[03:10:58.960 --> 03:11:03.160]  the government and just like Hitler would stage terror attacks to demonize
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:07.280]  his political enemies the same thing as being set up and I've been predicting it
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:13.600]  intensely in the last really year but the last three months intensely warning
[03:11:13.600 --> 03:11:18.120]  every day and now you're seeing clear false flags so Webster coming on the
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:25.440]  last 20 minutes to walk through all of this with us and we have a bunch of
[03:11:25.440 --> 03:11:29.080]  guests joining us tomorrow believe me you're not gonna want to miss that
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:35.360]  information now yesterday I started getting calls saying Adam
[03:11:35.360 --> 03:11:40.400]  Gadan the grandson of the ADL founding board member a guy who was arrested for
[03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:45.680]  beating up Arabs outside their mosque in California a guy who was so hateful of
[03:11:45.680 --> 03:11:49.480]  Arabs and Islam he couldn't control himself he then went and grew a big
[03:11:49.480 --> 03:11:54.800]  beard and he sits there in English saying he's a top al-Qaeda commander and
[03:11:54.800 --> 03:11:58.640]  then wire magazine reported that videos of him and others that have been
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:04.000]  uploaded by different government front groups put the al-Qaeda lower third and
[03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:09.400]  logo up in the same video layer as the Intel Center and other groups that
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:15.080]  upload these there have been fake bin Laden videos fake al-Qaeda videos all
[03:12:15.080 --> 03:12:20.120]  confirmed they announced they'd arrested him everybody was like oh Adam Gadan
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:25.600]  must be real and I said folks watch they'll say they didn't arrest him or
[03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:28.720]  they arrested him as an intelligence operative and they're protecting him
[03:12:28.720 --> 03:12:31.720]  I've seen other arrests of high-level al-Qaeda and you'll hear a year later
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:35.080]  two years later in some cases oh they were really US government agents this
[03:12:35.080 --> 03:12:39.280]  will be in the news but buried in a footnote and they quietly released them
[03:12:39.280 --> 03:12:46.800]  under a new name and a witness protection program okay that goes on when
[03:12:46.800 --> 03:12:51.240]  they executed Tim McVeigh two different mainline news reporters reported he was
[03:12:51.240 --> 03:12:57.600]  breathing in Terre Hood Indiana when he left and it came out in federal
[03:12:57.600 --> 03:13:00.920]  documents at the Southern Primary Law Center was running the Elohim City
[03:13:00.920 --> 03:13:05.000]  white supremacist compound that McVeigh was at and it was sworn in federal
[03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:08.600]  documents by Terry Nichols and others and then later the lawyers involved
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:13.560]  actually got the FBI declassified but the FBI blocked out part of it then they
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:17.200]  got another four-year request through federal court where they blocked out
[03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:20.760]  other areas they could put the two together and have the full report full
[03:13:20.760 --> 03:13:26.040]  federal operation you had a bunch of states what was it 14th the time moving
[03:13:26.040 --> 03:13:29.360]  to declare 10th Amendment sovereignty against the feds the UN takeover of Bill
[03:13:29.360 --> 03:13:34.800]  Clinton the sellout to the Chinese a move to get us out of the United Nations
[03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:38.640]  and boom they blew that building up came out on CBS News that the ATF had been
[03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:42.800]  told not to be in the building that day that the FBI was in the town running an
[03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:48.560]  operation and it came out that McVeigh was hired in black ops to infiltrate
[03:13:48.560 --> 03:13:54.560]  militia and terror groups that is confirmed and it's confirmed in the
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:57.760]  New York Times and CBS News again that the FBI cooked the bomb trained the
[03:13:57.760 --> 03:14:02.120]  drivers totally set up these two mentally retarded dupes in 1993 for the
[03:14:02.120 --> 03:14:06.200]  World Trade Center attack the Ahmad Salam intelligence agent from Egypt
[03:14:06.200 --> 03:14:09.640]  thought they were setting him up recorded the FBI telling him you let that
[03:14:09.640 --> 03:14:13.000]  bomb and go ahead and that's the only reason he got away without being
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:16.440]  arrested and he was given a million three hundred thousand dollar payoff to
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:21.280]  keep quiet after that happened they declassified in the last year of those
[03:14:21.280 --> 03:14:26.920]  audio tapes from that trial Burma's has clips of it and the upcoming film
[03:14:26.920 --> 03:14:33.040]  Invisible Empire by the way I mean this is some damning damning information we
[03:14:33.040 --> 03:14:36.360]  have operation Northwood's the US government stage terror attack documents
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:41.880]  was declassified three weeks ago at the State Department dot gov that Bobby
[03:14:41.880 --> 03:14:47.680]  Kennedy wanted to blow up US embassies in Latin America to invade Honduras and
[03:14:47.680 --> 03:14:54.160]  other countries and his brother said no I mean this is just standard operating
[03:14:54.160 --> 03:14:59.320]  procedure and for the media to say these crazy nut lunatics think we should
[03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:02.920]  look at the government at least allowing this to happen when you have the
[03:15:02.920 --> 03:15:07.720]  hijackers trained at US military bases I mean these are facts that cannot be
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:15.040]  ignored any longer now I want to get into the most important story of the day
[03:15:15.040 --> 03:15:24.760]  I want to play a video clip coming up when we come out of the next segment the
[03:15:24.760 --> 03:15:30.400]  federal government under Tom Ridge in 2003 admitted that the airport security
[03:15:30.400 --> 03:15:34.240]  you see will be nationwide they're now putting on homeland security videos
[03:15:34.240 --> 03:15:38.920]  showing mobile trucks where they're gonna body scan you brain scan you the
[03:15:38.920 --> 03:15:43.480]  machine supposedly tells if you're lying to get into football games at
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:48.200]  highway checkpoints no judge no jury no nothing and of course the machine's a
[03:15:48.200 --> 03:15:52.440]  quack fraud just like lie detectors were proven to be a fraud in millions of
[03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:55.320]  people that were sent to prison hundreds of thousands who were innocent
[03:15:55.320 --> 03:16:00.480]  it's just made up oh but the machine says you're lying we're gonna show you
[03:16:00.480 --> 03:16:07.240]  some homeland security video of that coming up but the bigger issue here for
[03:16:07.240 --> 03:16:15.160]  everyone to understand and for everyone to be clear about is that section 802 of
[03:16:15.160 --> 03:16:19.720]  the USA Patriot Act states that all misdemeanors are acts of terrorism and
[03:16:19.720 --> 03:16:23.960]  last week we read articles where it's being used against homeless gun shops
[03:16:23.960 --> 03:16:28.040]  people that supposedly don't pay their income taxes no due process they're
[03:16:28.040 --> 03:16:32.800]  being arrested under the Patriot Act John Warner Defense Authorization Act of
[03:16:32.800 --> 03:16:37.680]  2007 states the feds are here and North Comer here to take over the states the
[03:16:37.680 --> 03:16:41.200]  Mayak Homeland Security documents of last year internal documents law
[03:16:41.200 --> 03:16:44.080]  enforcement gave us mainstream media confirmed they were real says gun

[03:16:48.520 --> 03:16:53.080]  Ron Paul supporters in the Fedders tax protesters are what Homeland
[03:16:53.080 --> 03:16:57.480]  Securities really for it's not for the radical Arabs that the CIA runs nine
[03:16:57.480 --> 03:17:05.560]  times out of 10 and now they admit with this Adam Godin that he wasn't arrested
[03:17:05.560 --> 03:17:11.960]  it was all fake as usual again they tell you they're resting then they tell you
[03:17:11.960 --> 03:17:16.120]  hours later they did in a bottom footnote that's how stupid they think
[03:17:16.120 --> 03:17:19.320]  you are to lend credibility to this Adam Godin guy and when he's making videos
[03:17:19.320 --> 03:17:23.000]  again in a month the media won't retract that he was never arrested this is
[03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:28.960]  scyop mind control dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents this

[03:17:49.800 --> 03:17:53.640]  dissenting political opinion is a lightly domestic terrorist they should be
[03:17:53.640 --> 03:17:58.120]  celebrating the fact that a new bill would allow the government to detain
[03:17:58.120 --> 03:18:02.760]  such people as enemy belligerents indefinitely and without trial based
[03:18:02.760 --> 03:18:07.680]  on their suspected activity that's a quote suspected no trial no nothing

[03:18:27.880 --> 03:18:31.880]  interrogation and trial of suspected enemy belligerents who are believed to
[03:18:31.880 --> 03:18:36.600]  engage in hostile activities against the United States by belligerents who are
[03:18:36.600 --> 03:18:40.200]  believed to have engaged and it goes on requiring these individuals to be held
[03:18:40.200 --> 03:18:44.280]  in military custody interrogated for their intelligence value and not
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:50.600]  provided with Miranda warning writes the Atlantic's mark and binder read the

[03:34:03.080 --> 03:34:07.480]  have these and now they want blood samples to
[03:34:07.480 --> 03:34:11.480]  get a driver's license bill clinton signed an executive order in 1994 to do
[03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:14.600]  that my first film america destroyed by design shows
[03:34:14.600 --> 03:34:17.880]  executive order now they're trying to implement it
[03:34:17.880 --> 03:34:22.200]  they're training you to accept anything like a pimp breaks a whore
[03:34:22.200 --> 03:34:26.600]  okay they're breaking your will it's it's so sick to see my fellow
[03:34:26.600 --> 03:34:31.080]  countrymen and others globally being turned into nothing but slaves
[03:34:31.080 --> 03:34:35.880]  let's go ahead and finish up with this chilling clip from homeland security
[03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:41.160]  the unique low floor trailer design ensures accessibility for all
[03:34:41.160 --> 03:34:44.680]  inside the screening mobile module a suite of real-time
[03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:49.880]  non-invasive sensors measure behavioral and physiological indications of mal
[03:34:49.880 --> 03:34:52.840]  intent oh it's not about back it up
[03:34:52.840 --> 03:34:58.040]  it's not invasive we don't stick anything up your rear down your throat
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:02.440]  brain scanning people body scanning people
[03:35:02.440 --> 03:35:06.600]  biometrically recording you at malls or on the highway
[03:35:06.600 --> 03:35:10.600]  or to go into a sporting event and the public schools are already little
[03:35:10.600 --> 03:35:13.400]  prisons but the illegal aliens at 800 cities are
[03:35:13.400 --> 03:35:16.680]  above the law every day they run into somebody and kill them in central
[03:35:16.680 --> 03:35:19.400]  texas and the media never talks about how they're illegal aliens but they
[03:35:19.400 --> 03:35:23.720]  throw the book at us the scumbag dumb citizens that's how we're seen
[03:35:23.720 --> 03:35:27.480]  i guess we deserve it back to the clip a suite of real-time
[03:35:27.480 --> 03:35:32.360]  non-invasive sensors measure behavioral and physiological indications of
[03:35:32.360 --> 03:35:36.760]  mal intent or the intent or desire to cause harm
[03:35:36.760 --> 03:35:41.560]  as sensor technology evolves the screening mobile module can be easily
[03:35:41.560 --> 03:35:45.480]  reconfigured with movable partition walls
[03:35:45.480 --> 03:35:50.200]  the screening mobile module can be configured to support primary screening
[03:35:50.200 --> 03:35:56.040]  secondary screening observation areas or multiple screening lanes for higher
[03:35:56.040 --> 03:36:00.200]  subject throughput anchor track on the walls
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:05.400]  ceiling at floors provide a secure and easily reconfigurable means of
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:08.760]  installing equipment throughout the screening unit
[03:36:08.760 --> 03:36:12.760]  new screening centers can be easily integrated into the screening mobile
[03:36:12.760 --> 03:36:15.080]  module
[03:36:15.640 --> 03:36:20.040]  the command unit provides local supervision and management of screening
[03:36:20.040 --> 03:36:25.000]  operations during a security event multiple screening units can be
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:28.200]  wirelessly networked to a single command module
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:31.560]  minimizing the resources needed to manage large events
[03:36:31.560 --> 03:36:36.440]  and providing a cost-effective means of providing on-site security operations
[03:36:36.440 --> 03:36:41.240]  at a large event climate control data processing areas and both mobile
[03:36:41.240 --> 03:36:46.200]  modules provide ample space for on-site data processing and analysis
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:50.040]  equipment the mobile modules are secured by a
[03:36:50.040 --> 03:36:54.600]  these are mobile that protects the equipment it costs these are mobile
[03:36:54.600 --> 03:36:58.440]  interrogation brainwashing units skip ahead to the very end because we're
[03:36:58.440 --> 03:37:01.640]  running out of time at the very end they show actual
[03:37:01.640 --> 03:37:06.120]  subjects being asked of their terrorist skip ahead the last minute or two shows
[03:37:06.120 --> 03:37:10.360]  it i mean
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:14.440]  they just engage in outrageous behavior in front of everyone
[03:37:14.440 --> 03:37:21.400]  did you find it go ahead developing innovative screening technologies
[03:37:21.400 --> 03:37:25.720]  here's some examples step forward and stand on those footprints on that map
[03:37:25.720 --> 03:37:28.520]  step forward what i want to have you do is can you put your
[03:37:28.520 --> 03:37:31.960]  your purse in your pocket or just to the side there
[03:37:31.960 --> 03:37:35.080]  i'm gonna have you look in my direction um just keep your
[03:37:35.080 --> 03:37:38.840]  your hands kind of to the side and try and refrain from
[03:37:38.840 --> 03:37:46.120]  from movement okay i'm just trying to remain as close here that prisoner
[03:37:46.120 --> 03:37:52.280]  did you show your id to the first start to the guard
[03:37:55.240 --> 03:38:04.280]  are you attempting to smuggle an explosive device into the expo today
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:11.080]  are you from the local area
[03:38:11.640 --> 03:38:16.680]  are you attempting to smuggle a recording device into the expo today
[03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:21.160]  uh that's enough and then notice they widen it oh you're going into the expo
[03:38:21.160 --> 03:38:24.840]  center to see a rock and roll concert are you attempting to smuggle a
[03:38:24.840 --> 03:38:27.800]  recording device because that's the same as an explosive see
[03:38:27.800 --> 03:38:31.480]  first are you trying to smuggle an explosive in are you from the local
[03:38:31.480 --> 03:38:34.840]  area are you trying to smuggle a recording device in
[03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:38.920]  see because they know there's no real terrorist
[03:38:38.920 --> 03:38:42.920]  and so and then they go on and on and when i watch the marines
[03:38:42.920 --> 03:38:48.440]  playing the part of taking over oakland interrogating the mock terrorist
[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:51.880]  you're in a militia where are you from where'd you get the helmet
[03:38:51.880 --> 03:38:57.000]  and they're doing the same thing you live in feluja now folks and if you let
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:01.240]  these sickos naked body scan you you already let them take your shoes off and
[03:39:01.240 --> 03:39:04.920]  all these acts of submission now in the last hour of flights they say you can't
[03:39:04.920 --> 03:39:08.520]  talk and put your hands in your lap can't have a blanket because you all
[03:39:08.520 --> 03:39:12.120]  might be terrorist the only group we can trust that's not terrorist
[03:39:12.120 --> 03:39:16.680]  is the government run by big banks stealing tens of trillions of dollars
[03:39:16.680 --> 03:39:20.600]  and lying about wmds and killing over a million iraqis
[03:39:20.600 --> 03:39:24.280]  and leaving our borders open and building giant prisons everywhere
[03:39:24.280 --> 03:39:28.760]  and sneaking in narcotics that's the only group we can trust but people trying
[03:39:28.760 --> 03:39:32.680]  to get into an expo center have got to see a rock concert have got to be asked
[03:39:32.680 --> 03:39:38.360]  of their terrorist and ask if they have a recording device and brain scanned
[03:39:39.800 --> 03:39:43.560]  you know i'm out of time i wanted to play the fox news piece with herald
[03:39:43.560 --> 03:39:47.240]  trying to demonize 911 truth at the start of the clip it's up on
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:51.400]  prisonplanet.com and info wars dot com it's been the news and feature on the
[03:39:51.400 --> 03:39:53.480]  front page of youtube all day if you want to see it
[03:39:53.480 --> 03:39:57.320]  it's another easy way on the front page of youtube
[03:39:57.320 --> 03:40:02.360]  haroldo said oh this guy's a 911 truth or does this discredit your movement
[03:40:02.360 --> 03:40:05.640]  it didn't seem to discredit the tea party so the tea party guy flew into the
[03:40:05.640 --> 03:40:08.920]  building when he wasn't tea party
[03:40:10.280 --> 03:40:13.640]  and i pointed out the government has staged terror in the past that's the
[03:40:13.640 --> 03:40:17.720]  information that gets looked at not some patsy showing up and doing this
[03:40:17.720 --> 03:40:20.360]  out of the blue
[03:40:21.320 --> 03:40:25.240]  and haroldo didn't know what to say and then his co-host basically said
[03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:29.880]  that i was making outrageous claims saying gulf of tomkin and other events
[03:40:29.880 --> 03:40:33.880]  were staged and haroldo had to admit no no no it is staged now i've been telling
[03:40:33.880 --> 03:40:36.840]  you they're going to stage terror attacks and blaming on burthers
[03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:41.480]  on truthers and on tea parties and they're now
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:45.240]  doing it and i told you because out of the blue with burthers truthers and tea
[03:40:45.240 --> 03:40:49.320]  parties engaged in no violence ever out of the blue
[03:40:49.320 --> 03:40:53.000]  all their talking heads started saying truthers are going to kill obama
[03:40:53.000 --> 03:40:55.960]  they're going to attack the military they're going to attack police
[03:40:55.960 --> 03:41:00.760]  you watch that's them preparing the public and then it
[03:41:00.760 --> 03:41:03.480]  happens and then you look at the case underwear bomber
[03:41:03.480 --> 03:41:07.000]  family warned state department ordered him let on the plane had him let on the
[03:41:07.000 --> 03:41:10.920]  plane now confirmed kurt haskel confirmed all of it proven the eyewitnesses
[03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:16.200]  correct fb i'd miss they lied but no investigation
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:18.680]  the ford hood shooter for two years talked about what he was going to do
[03:41:18.680 --> 03:41:22.440]  thought he was emailing al qaeda turned out it's this top al qaeda guy who works
[03:41:22.440 --> 03:41:26.520]  for cia who runs all the major patsy's
[03:41:26.520 --> 03:41:29.880]  in every other case this guy's family warned him
[03:41:29.880 --> 03:41:34.040]  months and then weeks before and nothing was done
[03:41:34.040 --> 03:41:38.040]  they're not releasing the surveillance footage operation northwoods talks about
[03:41:38.040 --> 03:41:41.960]  grazing or wounding troops at u.s military basis
[03:41:41.960 --> 03:41:48.120]  in dc in miami and at guantanamo bay with people dressed up like cubans and
[03:41:48.120 --> 03:41:53.240]  even folks they just repeat the same thing over and over again
[03:41:53.240 --> 03:41:57.240]  they're at a key juncture why are they so afraid of 911 truth
[03:41:57.240 --> 03:42:02.440]  why are they hell bent on demonizing 911 truth
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:06.840]  because they can't stage terror attacks anymore
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:10.680]  to launch new wars because we have educated the public about false flag
[03:42:10.680 --> 03:42:13.640]  terror we've taken one of their favorite mechanisms
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:19.080]  of frame up a false flag and we've exposed it and so southern poverty loss
[03:42:19.080 --> 03:42:24.520]  center adl fox cnn msnbc scores of other publications time
[03:42:24.520 --> 03:42:28.040]  newsweek all particularly naming alex jones
[03:42:28.040 --> 03:42:31.560]  i mean the london guardians said that i'm like a black hole of evil in creating
[03:42:31.560 --> 03:42:35.240]  mass psychosis they are really angry right now
[03:42:35.240 --> 03:42:38.120]  and that's because they want to launch new terror attacks but they know we're
[03:42:38.120 --> 03:42:41.640]  going to be here exposing them so they think if they discredit us before they
[03:42:41.640 --> 03:42:46.840]  stage new terror no one will listen but that's flawed logic the idea of looking
[03:42:46.840 --> 03:42:50.120]  for the stage terror is now there that's why kurt haskell the lawyer and his
[03:42:50.120 --> 03:42:53.640]  wife and others saw them lead the underwear bomber on the plane
[03:42:53.640 --> 03:42:57.960]  saw them protecting without a passport get him on saw the man videotaping him
[03:42:57.960 --> 03:43:01.640]  part of a drill found the other bomb on the plane once they got off
[03:43:01.640 --> 03:43:06.040]  the then they lied about that all that since has come out to be true
[03:43:06.040 --> 03:43:09.800]  but there's no investigation because haskell and his wife
[03:43:09.800 --> 03:43:13.960]  were nine eleven truthers we've got people everywhere
[03:43:13.960 --> 03:43:17.880]  some polls are in the mid thirties thirty six percent the lowest
[03:43:17.880 --> 03:43:21.080]  some polls eighty four percent believe nine eleven's an inside job angerson
[03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:26.120]  read new york times two thousand six they are panicking
[03:43:26.120 --> 03:43:30.200]  because we've got our people everywhere who are going to record and remember
[03:43:30.200 --> 03:43:32.440]  what happens and we know what to look for now
[03:43:32.440 --> 03:43:35.480]  i now go to webster griffin tarpoli a doctorate of history
[03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:40.280]  and economics author of nine eleven synthetic terror made in the usa a great
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:43.000]  book on nine eleven that we sell it info wars
[03:43:43.000 --> 03:43:48.280]  dot com webster i wanted to get you on with some of the past pat c ops versus
[03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:52.760]  provocateur or purely staged ops to look at what's happening with this
[03:43:52.760 --> 03:43:56.040]  latest event and see if you concur with me you were on three weeks ago when i
[03:43:56.040 --> 03:43:59.240]  said they're going to stage terror and blame it on nine eleven truth because i
[03:43:59.240 --> 03:44:03.560]  saw the pre-programming going on from their mouthpieces webster tarpoli
[03:44:03.560 --> 03:44:07.240]  yes certainly there are many indications that this indeed is a staged
[03:44:07.240 --> 03:44:11.800]  operation with a pat c and i guess the people before we get to the pat c part
[03:44:11.800 --> 03:44:14.760]  i guess the starting point is always is there something fishy is there
[03:44:14.760 --> 03:44:18.120]  something that is suspicious something that doesn't add up and i would say in
[03:44:18.120 --> 03:44:20.840]  this case according to abc news there's a second
[03:44:20.840 --> 03:44:25.160]  individual taken into custody at the shooting briefly detained and then
[03:44:25.160 --> 03:44:28.120]  released after they said that he had nothing to do
[03:44:28.120 --> 03:44:31.960]  with the incident and the two cops are not being allowed to talk
[03:44:31.960 --> 03:44:35.320]  to the press yeah that's an african immigrant yeah go ahead the two people
[03:44:35.320 --> 03:44:38.520]  who are slightly wounded well we think it's the african immigrant but we don't
[03:44:38.520 --> 03:44:42.520]  know that could be a cover for some other person that was actually there
[03:44:42.520 --> 03:44:47.320]  then we have his family warning in detail right but just in terms of this
[03:44:47.320 --> 03:44:52.040]  now uh... the the guy i i have to be very brutal about him in the tragic case
[03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:54.520]  but this is someone who's mentally ill
[03:44:54.520 --> 03:44:59.160]  he is a psychotic he is criminally insane and we have the testimony of his
[03:44:59.160 --> 03:45:04.760]  psychiatrist dr j michael nelson says that the bedel has bought a pad bio
[03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:08.360]  bipolar disorder which he could have controlled with medication but instead
[03:45:08.360 --> 03:45:13.000]  he refused his medication and instead turned to marijuana and i think that
[03:45:13.000 --> 03:45:15.720]  this is the key to it because in order to be a pat c
[03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:19.720]  it helps to have cognitive impairment and that's that's what we find in this
[03:45:19.720 --> 03:45:23.880]  case he's been institutionalized many times over the years his parents
[03:45:23.880 --> 03:45:27.640]  essentially begged to have the police institutionalized him
[03:45:27.640 --> 03:45:31.480]  hospitalized him in that sense there's a direct parallel to mutala where the
[03:45:31.480 --> 03:45:32.280]  parents
[03:45:32.280 --> 03:45:36.040]  also say that the kid is he'd also been talking to the pentagon for five years
[03:45:36.040 --> 03:45:39.000]  about some of his inventions and had talked about traveling
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:42.040]  to meet with them there so he could have just been a mentally ill person they
[03:45:42.040 --> 03:45:44.920]  had they shoot a few of their people kill him
[03:45:44.920 --> 03:45:48.840]  right now the the question of nine eleven truth i think this is complete
[03:45:48.840 --> 03:45:51.960]  red herring because what i see about this that this is a kind of a throwaway
[03:45:51.960 --> 03:45:54.200]  line a chance comment
[03:45:54.200 --> 03:45:58.360]  four or five years ago he's interested in this save our case but
[03:45:58.360 --> 03:46:01.320]  he's not really interested in nine eleven if we look at him in terms of
[03:46:01.320 --> 03:46:05.000]  action rather than rhetoric action for him means
[03:46:05.000 --> 03:46:10.120]  narcotics he is devoted to narcotics he wants a society based on narcotics he
[03:46:10.120 --> 03:46:13.480]  wants marijuana to be the basis of the currency
[03:46:13.480 --> 03:46:16.680]  he wants billions and billions of marijuana plants
[03:46:16.680 --> 03:46:20.600]  and of course then it gets into his arrest record and i think this is where
[03:46:20.600 --> 03:46:22.920]  you also see this question of the pat c
[03:46:22.920 --> 03:46:27.000]  the pat he gets away with murder uh... that were he gets away with things that
[03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:30.120]  the average person never could and uh...
[03:46:30.120 --> 03:46:34.120]  that would be in jail there in this case in two thousand and six he's arrested
[03:46:34.120 --> 03:46:38.280]  in california for growing marijuana plants now he may have a medical
[03:46:38.280 --> 03:46:40.440]  marijuana card and that may get him off
[03:46:40.440 --> 03:46:43.720]  but he's also in there for resisting arrest
[03:46:43.720 --> 03:46:47.240]  in california then we haven't picked up in texas
[03:46:47.240 --> 03:46:51.640]  uh... in january for speeding but also with a marijuana pipe and the state
[03:46:51.640 --> 03:46:54.600]  police officer called his parents and said he seems like he's out of his mind
[03:46:54.600 --> 03:46:57.880]  well i'm sure we know that he fits the m o the pats on that front
[03:46:57.880 --> 03:46:59.880]  the reason i wanted to get you on though
[03:46:59.880 --> 03:47:03.560]  was to go over some of the history of other type mental deficients they've
[03:47:03.560 --> 03:47:06.680]  used where it's turned out it was provocateur actions
[03:47:06.680 --> 03:47:11.320]  yeah well again the reno Nevada cases also i think significant he's got pipes
[03:47:11.320 --> 03:47:15.080]  he's got these driving under the influence of of marijuana he's driving
[03:47:15.080 --> 03:47:19.240]  well drugged and nevertheless he's able to go on what is described as a six to
[03:47:19.240 --> 03:47:22.280]  eight week driving spree
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:25.800]  where did he get the money and then he shows up at the pentagon where was he
[03:47:25.800 --> 03:47:28.760]  during the six to eight week period now
[03:47:28.760 --> 03:47:34.680]  the parallels uh... major hassan uh... is someone who worked at the uh...
[03:47:34.680 --> 03:47:36.840]  walter read army hospital here in
[03:47:36.840 --> 03:47:41.160]  in uh... washington dc was active at the buffet the naval medical center
[03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:46.360]  so he's a shrink among shrinks and he had we have these these memo memos from
[03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:49.400]  his colleague saying this man is a psychotic
[03:47:49.400 --> 03:47:53.160]  but he talks about islam but basically his problem is that he's a
[03:47:53.160 --> 03:47:55.640]  psychotic and nothing happened
[03:47:55.640 --> 03:47:58.920]  uh... similarly with mutala the parents in this case
[03:47:58.920 --> 03:48:01.640]  with uh... with bedel and beg the police
[03:48:01.640 --> 03:48:05.480]  to take him into custody nothing happened so we look at the bell
[03:48:05.480 --> 03:48:09.880]  he's got four or five things going for me's got marijuana convictions feeding
[03:48:09.880 --> 03:48:12.000]  convictions his parents
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:15.360]  uh... put in a missing persons report they think maybe on
[03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:16.560]  maybe dangerous
[03:48:16.560 --> 03:48:18.200]  nothing happened
[03:48:18.200 --> 03:48:21.640]  it seems to me you've got two sides if you want to call anybody to account
[03:48:21.640 --> 03:48:23.560]  let's call in george soros
[03:48:23.560 --> 03:48:27.720]  and ask him about the implications of marijuana and narcotics
[03:48:27.720 --> 03:48:28.880]  for this case
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:32.120]  rather than put it on nine eleven i don't think you can really use these cases
[03:48:32.120 --> 03:48:37.080]  dependent on anybody but in this case there is a direct role of marijuana in
[03:48:37.080 --> 03:48:38.960]  the guy psychosis which
[03:48:38.960 --> 03:48:41.760]  prepares him for the role that he's been okay we know you have marijuana
[03:48:41.760 --> 03:48:46.000]  webster that's great my issue is i want to get you on because you're
[03:48:46.000 --> 03:48:48.480]  very uh... researched on
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:50.360]  all the other patsy's
[03:48:50.360 --> 03:48:54.560]  from miami and in and in the bronx
[03:48:54.560 --> 03:48:59.000]  and just over and over again where they go and set up these patsy's
[03:48:59.000 --> 03:49:02.000]  i think that the most recent one that we should we should keep our mark of
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:03.000]  horizon is
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:06.160]  again major hotline because he's somebody who
[03:49:06.160 --> 03:49:10.760]  behaves in a very erratic and uh... outrageous way with in the case of major
[03:49:10.760 --> 03:49:11.800]  hotline
[03:49:11.800 --> 03:49:14.400]  the fortwood shooter this is also somebody who's got
[03:49:14.400 --> 03:49:18.760]  a secret level clearance because by virtue of being a major in the u.s. army
[03:49:18.760 --> 03:49:19.880]  he's got this
[03:49:19.880 --> 03:49:23.440]  clearance and that would put him normally under special and he's emailing
[03:49:23.440 --> 03:49:28.080]  this top al-qaeda guy who's who runs all the other patsy's over and over again
[03:49:28.080 --> 03:49:31.720]  and they and they declare national security all his emails right so he
[03:49:31.720 --> 03:49:33.640]  shaped it so essentially
[03:49:33.640 --> 03:49:37.280]  if we look back again if we look at the fort hood
[03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:39.640]  uh... if we look at the fort
[03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:41.560]  six if we look at the
[03:49:41.560 --> 03:49:42.720]  uh... miami
[03:49:42.720 --> 03:49:43.880]  patients
[03:49:43.880 --> 03:49:45.560]  these other cases that we've had
[03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:47.960]  we can see that the the idea of a
[03:49:47.960 --> 03:49:52.920]  trouble but subject to put the subject with mental illness
[03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:56.720]  cognitive impairment you can also see it in the the alleged attempt to blow up
[03:49:56.720 --> 03:49:57.800]  the uh...
[03:49:57.800 --> 03:50:01.480]  that the fuel lines going into kennedy airport on the part of a
[03:50:01.480 --> 03:50:04.680]  a kind of a street vagrant who also had a history of
[03:50:04.680 --> 03:50:07.320]  of mental disease so you see this again and again
[03:50:07.320 --> 03:50:09.440]  it means that these individuals
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:13.760]  are susceptible to manipulation and again i would like to know
[03:50:13.760 --> 03:50:18.560]  what was the bill doing during the time from about january eighteenth
[03:50:18.560 --> 03:50:21.520]  when he seems to have gone back to his home for a short time
[03:50:21.520 --> 03:50:23.720]  and uh... this past uh...
[03:50:23.720 --> 03:50:28.320]  past week when he said i'm gonna skip this break this is a network break
[03:50:28.320 --> 03:50:31.120]  so it's ours for the stations out there we're gonna skip
[03:50:31.120 --> 03:50:33.280]  the genesis break right now
[03:50:33.280 --> 03:50:36.280]  uh... finish up with the patsy background
[03:50:36.280 --> 03:50:39.720]  but then let's expand on why are they
[03:50:39.720 --> 03:50:41.160]  running
[03:50:41.160 --> 03:50:44.960]  these operations now why within an hour and five minutes
[03:50:44.960 --> 03:50:48.600]  was all the national international news saying he was a nine eleven truth or
[03:50:48.600 --> 03:50:52.240]  why are they wanting to demonize nine eleven truth now
[03:50:52.240 --> 03:50:55.560]  we've seen this concerted six month ramp up
[03:50:55.560 --> 03:50:56.880]  to this
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:51:02.040]  i think it's a it's an exercise in neo mccarthy at hysteria it is similar to
[03:51:02.040 --> 03:51:04.760]  old demagogue senator joe mccarthy
[03:51:04.760 --> 03:51:07.760]  and the red scare of the nineteen fifties this time that the names of the
[03:51:07.760 --> 03:51:08.920]  targets are
[03:51:08.920 --> 03:51:10.080]  are different
[03:51:10.080 --> 03:51:10.840]  uh...
[03:51:10.840 --> 03:51:15.000]  the immediate setting and we should be aware of this is a worldwide revolt
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:19.280]  against wall street and bankers and the international monetary fund and the
[03:51:19.280 --> 03:51:20.840]  power of bankers
[03:51:20.840 --> 03:51:23.000]  the three examples
[03:51:23.000 --> 03:51:26.920]  the uh... goldman fax attacks greece is a way of getting at the euro
[03:51:26.920 --> 03:51:30.320]  and now the the people in greece are told that their health education welfare
[03:51:30.320 --> 03:51:32.080]  social safety net wages
[03:51:32.080 --> 03:51:35.920]  are all going to be destroyed because goldman fax and and george soros again
[03:51:35.920 --> 03:51:38.000]  are attacking the currency so they've had
[03:51:38.000 --> 03:51:41.120]  one general strike uh... ten days ago they're gonna have another general
[03:51:41.120 --> 03:51:41.840]  strike
[03:51:41.840 --> 03:51:43.360]  this week to their fighting
[03:51:43.360 --> 03:51:45.440]  ice land on saturday
[03:51:45.440 --> 03:51:46.480]  the referendum
[03:51:46.480 --> 03:51:48.220]  will iceland pay
[03:51:48.220 --> 03:51:51.640]  six billion dollars to the british and the dutch it's the equivalent of a
[03:51:51.640 --> 03:51:55.000]  hundred and thirty dollars per person per month
[03:51:55.000 --> 03:51:57.480]  for the next six to eight years
[03:51:57.480 --> 03:51:59.000]  uh... depending on the interest
[03:51:59.000 --> 03:52:02.800]  but they think no ninety two percent of iceland is no
[03:52:02.800 --> 03:52:06.640]  we will not pay the bank we will not be slaves of the bank
[03:52:06.640 --> 03:52:09.640]  in this country something that i think is very very significant
[03:52:09.640 --> 03:52:12.800]  we've had on a hundred campuses in thirty three states
[03:52:12.800 --> 03:52:16.860]  an upsurge of student activism saying no to tuition cuts
[03:52:16.860 --> 03:52:18.520]  no to increase payments
[03:52:18.520 --> 03:52:20.760]  especially in cases like california
[03:52:20.760 --> 03:52:22.400]  were part of the money
[03:52:22.400 --> 03:52:25.240]  is going to go straight into the hands of wall street bankers
[03:52:25.240 --> 03:52:29.080]  as a result of the bond it's hard for the media to demonize them is evil
[03:52:29.080 --> 03:52:30.880]  right wing tea party people
[03:52:30.880 --> 03:52:31.480]  uh...
[03:52:31.480 --> 03:52:34.680]  certainly and and and their program is also quite different and i think their
[03:52:34.680 --> 03:52:36.600]  program makes a lot more sense
[03:52:36.600 --> 03:52:39.840]  than at the end of these other programs for the students are essentially
[03:52:39.840 --> 03:52:42.880]  trying to defend their right to an education
[03:52:42.880 --> 03:52:45.880]  you can't get together from greek i don't think i have a right to it but they
[03:52:45.880 --> 03:52:47.520]  paid for it we know that
[03:52:47.520 --> 03:52:50.280]  the big universities take most money invested in derivatives like the
[03:52:50.280 --> 03:52:53.360]  university of texas so they do have a right to not be ripped off
[03:52:53.360 --> 03:52:56.960]  yet with the uh... the large schools i mean look harvard yale that might be
[03:52:56.960 --> 03:53:00.720]  printed all the rest of them have lost between one quarter and one third
[03:53:00.720 --> 03:53:04.120]  of their endowment because of derivatives that has some lost more but
[03:53:04.120 --> 03:53:08.000]  yes another time is summer is up at harvard played a big role
[03:53:08.000 --> 03:53:11.520]  what you see i think is the beginning of a mass strike period but that i'm a
[03:53:11.520 --> 03:53:12.440]  real one
[03:53:12.440 --> 03:53:13.280]  in other words
[03:53:13.280 --> 03:53:15.720]  real economic self-defense
[03:53:15.720 --> 03:53:17.000]  as the bankers
[03:53:17.000 --> 03:53:19.840]  turn the screws and demand more austerity
[03:53:19.840 --> 03:53:22.800]  take away your social security take away your medicare
[03:53:22.800 --> 03:53:26.080]  take away your unemployment benefit they're going to stage events to
[03:53:26.080 --> 03:53:27.200]  demonize
[03:53:27.200 --> 03:53:30.840]  all of their political opposition but i don't see this working webster
[03:53:30.840 --> 03:53:34.840]  uh... i don't i think that this depends on all of us uh...
[03:53:34.840 --> 03:53:38.240]  it seems to me that uh... it's it's a complete red herring and that this is
[03:53:38.240 --> 03:53:39.740]  completely outrageous
[03:53:39.740 --> 03:53:42.120]  that they want to take some four-year-old
[03:53:42.120 --> 03:53:44.160]  scrap of a quote
[03:53:44.160 --> 03:53:45.320]  characterized this
[03:53:45.320 --> 03:53:47.720]  this mentally ill criminally insane
[03:53:47.720 --> 03:53:50.760]  i was i don't mean but that's more evidence of it being staged and we're
[03:53:50.760 --> 03:53:52.720]  ready with an hour and five minutes
[03:53:52.720 --> 03:53:55.600]  to run with this and go after yours truly
[03:53:55.600 --> 03:53:57.880]  and i think let's look at the other side of it now
[03:53:57.880 --> 03:54:00.400]  let's look at the obama white house who do we find
[03:54:00.400 --> 03:54:02.920]  we find this odd couple i would say
[03:54:02.920 --> 03:54:03.560]  cast
[03:54:03.560 --> 03:54:05.920]  sunstein who is the regulations
[03:54:05.920 --> 03:54:06.960]  car
[03:54:06.960 --> 03:54:08.320]  and his wife
[03:54:08.320 --> 03:54:10.440]  his new wife of about a year
[03:54:10.440 --> 03:54:12.520]  and that's samantha power
[03:54:12.520 --> 03:54:16.480]  you remember her foul mouth interventions during the primary campaign of
[03:54:16.480 --> 03:54:17.800]  cursing artillery
[03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:18.520]  clinton
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:20.280]  in uh... in the british interview
[03:54:20.280 --> 03:54:24.160]  cast sunstein and samantha power samantha power is now the director of
[03:54:24.160 --> 03:54:26.520]  by of multilateral relations
[03:54:26.520 --> 03:54:30.080]  at the national security council sunsteen's calling for provocaturing
[03:54:30.080 --> 03:54:33.280]  nine eleven truth right and therefore we can we can say
[03:54:33.280 --> 03:54:36.760]  the sunstein is obviously a left totalitarian
[03:54:36.760 --> 03:54:40.160]  thinker obviously somebody who hates the first amendment can't stand normal
[03:54:40.160 --> 03:54:42.520]  political he says that he says ban freedom
[03:54:42.520 --> 03:54:43.280]  he says
[03:54:43.280 --> 03:54:46.800]  he wants to catch conspiracy theories this is unbelievable
[03:54:46.800 --> 03:54:50.200]  uh... this is this is this is an absolute crackpot
[03:54:50.200 --> 03:54:53.040]  but you see this is a power couple inside the
[03:54:53.040 --> 03:54:54.440]  the obama regime now
[03:54:54.440 --> 03:54:58.600]  when we look at these things that uh... but there was a ledge to upset
[03:54:58.600 --> 03:55:00.720]  how do we know that
[03:55:00.720 --> 03:55:03.140]  computer postings on the internet
[03:55:03.140 --> 03:55:06.320]  uh... really from the delton way for those that don't know you're not just
[03:55:06.320 --> 03:55:08.800]  saying this cast sunsteen a year and a half ago
[03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:10.000]  at chicago
[03:55:10.000 --> 03:55:11.280]  uh... law school
[03:55:11.280 --> 03:55:15.160]  uh... in the conjunction with harvard wrote we will go out on the internet
[03:55:15.160 --> 03:55:19.080]  we will pose as nine eleven truthers and say horrible things we will infiltrate
[03:55:19.080 --> 03:55:21.280]  their groups and try to create violence
[03:55:21.280 --> 03:55:23.520]  i mean so you say you're saying it looks like
[03:55:23.520 --> 03:55:26.760]  well yeah i mean cast sunsteen's probably involved in this week we don't know
[03:55:26.760 --> 03:55:29.320]  in other words it is real folly
[03:55:29.320 --> 03:55:32.840]  to take the ratings of a psychotic in any case but ratings of a psychotic
[03:55:32.840 --> 03:55:34.320]  posted on the internet
[03:55:34.320 --> 03:55:35.440]  which could be anybody
[03:55:35.440 --> 03:55:39.240]  this could be an intelligent agency my gosh the national security council can
[03:55:39.240 --> 03:55:40.040]  certainly do these
[03:55:40.040 --> 03:55:44.440]  well in closing separately adam gadan this adl guy they claim they capture
[03:55:44.440 --> 03:55:46.680]  him yesterday and announce all we didn't capture him
[03:55:46.680 --> 03:55:49.320]  i mean this is this is just like a three weeks ago when they claim they
[03:55:49.320 --> 03:55:52.960]  captured number two in taliban the next day so they didn't do it that's an
[03:55:52.960 --> 03:55:55.600]  intelligence op where they throw it out
[03:55:55.600 --> 03:55:57.260]  and then set the precedent
[03:55:57.260 --> 03:55:59.280]  that they can just lying it away with it
[03:55:59.280 --> 03:56:01.680]  well maybe they want to remind us of this character is
[03:56:01.680 --> 03:56:05.160]  all i can say with this adam gadan is that his story is
[03:56:05.160 --> 03:56:08.480]  very fishy and it seemed to me to be fishy for the last
[03:56:08.480 --> 03:56:12.080]  several years uh... maybe they'll get their story together
[03:56:12.080 --> 03:56:15.400]  but it seems like they want to remind us who he is so that if they do claim to
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:16.480]  have captured him
[03:56:16.480 --> 03:56:19.600]  it won't be home it will be all of the most wanted
[03:56:19.600 --> 03:56:22.440]  adam gadan so i don't know about that but
[03:56:22.440 --> 03:56:26.320]  uh... in particular i don't know why are they so scared of nine eleven truth
[03:56:26.320 --> 03:56:27.320]  right now
[03:56:27.320 --> 03:56:31.040]  i think it's because they want to use this to to launch a situation of the
[03:56:31.040 --> 03:56:33.920]  new mccarthy i demonization
[03:56:33.920 --> 03:56:36.920]  of any kind of critical or opposition
[03:56:36.920 --> 03:56:37.680]  thinking
[03:56:37.680 --> 03:56:40.480]  and again i think it has to do with the fact that we're going into some kind
[03:56:40.480 --> 03:56:42.000]  of a mass strike period
[03:56:42.000 --> 03:56:45.200]  you could see the american labor movement now
[03:56:45.200 --> 03:56:46.480]  returning to life
[03:56:46.480 --> 03:56:49.560]  because if the students can come back to life after decades
[03:56:49.560 --> 03:56:52.080]  of the campuses being political graveyard
[03:56:52.080 --> 03:56:53.720]  but the uh... labor movement
[03:56:53.720 --> 03:56:57.760]  all barma has just gone through his pat co moment remember when ronald reagan
[03:56:57.760 --> 03:56:58.440]  broke
[03:56:58.440 --> 03:57:00.920]  and destroyed the air traffic controllers union
[03:57:00.920 --> 03:57:03.840]  last week we had the school in in road island
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:06.680]  were a bunch of uh... teachers were fired
[03:57:06.680 --> 03:57:10.260]  outrageously fired by the administration and obama and his
[03:57:10.260 --> 03:57:13.840]  secretary of education arnie duncan come out and say that's great
[03:57:13.840 --> 03:57:17.000]  that's what we should do fire the teachers bus the union
[03:57:17.000 --> 03:57:19.080]  uh... reagan did it with pat co
[03:57:19.080 --> 03:57:23.000]  obama is now having his reagan moment he's channeling reagan and you said
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:26.320]  that that would be you said that would be his specialty
[03:57:26.320 --> 03:57:30.000]  as this bill melinda gates ford foundation funded many and
[03:57:30.000 --> 03:57:32.960]  fake left cover his job in chicago
[03:57:32.960 --> 03:57:37.400]  was breaking up uh... the unions we can even tell about this family business
[03:57:37.400 --> 03:57:38.400]  is busting
[03:57:38.400 --> 03:57:42.320]  the teachers union so he he was able to bust the united auto workers by
[03:57:42.320 --> 03:57:43.520]  forcing their
[03:57:43.520 --> 03:57:47.480]  wages down to the end of the unions hate them they're destroying any way we
[03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:51.360]  can politically organize that these are the mass organizations that would be
[03:57:51.360 --> 03:57:54.960]  important for any kind of resistant everything must go to the bankers
[03:57:54.960 --> 03:57:57.640]  wall say this webster i believe they're getting ready to stage more terror
[03:57:57.640 --> 03:58:01.000]  attacks and blame on nine eleven truth more to blame the tea party

[03:58:55.120 --> 03:58:58.200]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[03:58:58.200 --> 03:59:02.560]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[03:59:02.560 --> 03:59:03.920]  or triple your electric bill
[03:59:03.920 --> 03:59:08.200]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[03:59:08.200 --> 03:59:09.680]  company allows you to have
[03:59:09.680 --> 03:59:13.800]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[03:59:13.800 --> 03:59:15.320]  technology is coming
[03:59:15.320 --> 03:59:18.920]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[03:59:18.920 --> 03:59:23.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[03:59:23.040 --> 03:59:27.400]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[03:59:27.400 --> 03:59:30.920]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[03:59:30.920 --> 03:59:35.000]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[03:59:35.000 --> 03:59:38.280]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by
